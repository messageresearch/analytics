[0:02] just a little late sometimes someone was
[0:06] buying very violent not it had to go at
[0:10] that time policy were very very bad and
[0:14] drove all the way from Michigan sheriff
[0:18] to call and so forth that they were very
[0:19] very bad now let's sort of be alright
[0:25] nothing cool everything's under control
[0:27] and select fine when the lord comes in
[0:30] everything's under control he didn't he
[0:33] is so good to think of his goodness and
[0:37] his mercy but what he means to uh how
[0:41] precious is his crazy well we tried to
[0:47] start saying that we would take the
[0:50] first three chapters of the book of
[0:54] Ephesians I think we got the first three
[0:57] words or the first three something they
[1:00] have we didn't get very far
[1:02] but maybe tonight we can bitch'll along
[1:05] a little further now I want to say that
[1:10] I am NOT a Bible student by long ways
[1:14] and a long way from being a theologian
[1:16] but I love the Lord and I love deserving
[1:22] and
[1:31] someone just emergency said just before
[1:34] we go on now a little girl and the
[1:38] hospital in lowland all the best
[1:40] specialist has given her up she's dying
[1:42] now and asked requests for this child as
[1:48] Christians it's our duty to though our
[1:50] heads now for prayer our gracious Lord
[1:56] is not only our duty but it is our
[2:00] privilege and it is our desire that we
[2:05] bow our heads tonight as a church as a
[2:09] group I've called out believing people
[2:13] here tonight to teach thy word
[2:16] positionally placing us into the body
[2:19] that were we belong and where we can
[2:23] work fitly together as members of the
[2:27] body of Christ and now it is called upon
[2:32] us to go immediately to God and each of
[2:38] us father's think set of what if that
[2:40] was our little girl how arts would burn
[2:46] and hurt within and we would call to the
[2:52] churches to immediately have prayer and
[2:55] some Father's heart is burning aching
[3:03] Lord made that great person all the Holy
[3:07] Ghost come just now to that Father's
[3:10] heart take away every shadow of doubt
[3:14] and every ache and let him know that our
[3:19] God and there's no disease can stand in
[3:23] our presence when dodgy buying
[3:26] Commission has been carried out by the
[3:29] church and our people and as through the
[3:35] week we praying senseiess Sunday I have
[3:39] taught on these ways
[3:41] are these means of prayer we do not have
[3:47] very much of a weapon as far as it looks
[3:51] to the world but this little slingshot
[3:54] is deadly when it's held in the fingers
[4:00] of faith o Lord may our prayers like
[4:06] home that death yonder thats hanging
[4:10] over that child and may it be shattered
[4:15] the darkness gloom voice in the bedside
[4:18] of that infant - that baby or child
[4:20] little girl may the great light of God's
[4:25] presence shine upon it may it come from
[4:29] that hospital of well child God we know
[4:35] just across the river our loved ones
[4:38] wait and it is glorious but we love our
[4:41] little ones and we pray Lord that for
[4:44] your glory that you'll spare the life of
[4:47] that child we as your church rebuke that
[4:51] death and say stand still yonder and you
[4:55] can't take that child because we claim
[4:57] it's right for the kingdom of God Satan
[5:02] grant these things Lord to go straight
[5:05] to the mark as we direct them in the
[5:08] name of Jesus Christ our Savior amen
[5:16] can we believe
[5:19] I don't know what I could do if I wasn't
[5:31] a Christian I just wouldn't want to stay
[5:35] any longer
[5:37] there's nothing to live far only to get
[5:41] other stains is the best that I know now
[5:46] tonight we want to just start a little
[5:48] background of our previous lesson and I
[5:53] will try to read the cause the entire
[5:58] chapter if I can tonight so Sunday
[6:00] morning I'll have to maybe push in both
[6:03] Sunday morning at night
[6:06] all right to try to get in this setting
[6:12] of what I want the church to see oh it's
[6:17] glorious to find your position and no
[6:21] one can do anything unless you know
[6:24] properly what you're doing what if you
[6:29] were going to be a have an operation and
[6:34] that was a young doctor that had just
[6:36] come from school that you had never had
[6:39] an operation before yet he was young and
[6:41] handsome and his hair was combed slick
[6:43] he was dressed very fine Natalie and
[6:46] everything and he said I've sharpen the
[6:49] knives and Oscar Isaac all the tools and
[6:52] things but you'd have a little funny
[6:54] feeling about that I really have an old
[6:58] doctor
[6:59] went through that operation many times
[7:01] before before I want to be cut on I want
[7:05] to know somebody not just out of school
[7:07] I want somebody with some experience and
[7:11] the best experience wanted I know to
[7:13] call on tonight is the Holy Spirit he's
[7:19] God's great physician and great teacher
[7:24] and is back drowning my message tonight
[7:28] still from Sunday sermon that yeah
[7:32] is they rejected Samuel with the word of
[7:38] the Lord and accepted Saul the son of
[7:42] quiche and rejected
[7:45] Samuel which represent the Holy Spirit
[7:47] because he only spoke as a spirit led
[7:51] him to speak and when he called their
[7:54] attention to it he said remember I've
[7:56] never said nothing to you in the name of
[7:59] the Lord but what the Lord brought it to
[8:01] pass
[8:02] neither have I walk misbehave early
[8:05] before you and no one can accuse me of
[8:09] sin I Jesus said it we can condemn me of
[8:12] sin he and he said again that I have not
[8:17] come to you and begged you for money and
[8:21] so forth I've tucked nothing from you
[8:23] but all that I have said has been for
[8:26] your good that I brought to you from the
[8:28] mouth of the Lord and all the people
[8:31] give witness that's true all that's true
[8:34] but still we want to have a king we want
[8:39] to be like the rest of the world now
[8:42] tonight our scripture is dividing the
[8:48] book of Ephesians is the book of Joshua
[8:52] of the New Testament
[8:55] it's dividing up and setting in order
[8:58] the overcome one hour just a background
[9:03] for a few minutes to get a place before
[9:05] we start reading beginning with the
[9:09] third verse now we find life Sunday
[9:14] night that the God in the Old Testament
[9:19] had made Israel a promise of a land of
[9:24] rest because they had become Pilgrims
[9:29] and wanders and they were in a land that
[9:34] wasn't theirs God had promised to
[9:37] Abraham that his soul journey his seed
[9:41] would sojourn for 400 years and a
[9:43] strange people be mistreated but boss
[9:46] and he had bring them out into a goodly
[9:50] land that was flowing with milk and
[9:53] honey and now when the time of the
[9:57] promise drew nigh God raised up someone
[10:01] to bring them to that land I mean into
[10:09] place not who that one watt knows who
[10:11] that one was Moses notice a very very
[10:19] real type of our one that was given to
[10:25] bring us to the promised land Christ now
[10:30] we have a promise because who our
[10:33] promise is spiritual rest where there's
[10:37] was physical rest and so they was coming
[10:43] to a land that they could say this is
[10:46] our land we are no more wanders we
[10:53] settle down this is our land and here we
[10:58] have rest we'll plan our car our
[11:02] vineyards and we'll eat from our
[11:05] vineyards then when we pass home we'll
[11:07] leave it to our children
[11:08] oh how we could go into the land of it
[11:11] there are laws of inheritance like the
[11:15] OMA Ruth Boaz bring all that back how a
[11:20] brother in Israel how did he must
[11:23] anything that he had lost must be
[11:27] redeemed by a kinsman oh how beautiful
[11:32] it would take weeks and weeks and weeks
[11:34] and weeks we'd never leave this chapter
[11:36] you're going to it we just tie the
[11:38] entire Bible right into here right into
[11:41] this one chapter and all I just love to
[11:46] study it we used to take it and take it
[11:49] for a year and a half but never leave a
[11:50] boat just stay right with it now but it
[11:56] was such a great thing that's the inn
[12:00] how it was that an inheritance in the
[12:03] land that no one else but a close
[12:07] kinsman could redeem that inheritance
[12:11] now let me just jump over a little token
[12:14] here that I touched on in the night to
[12:17] you mother how many of these prayed for
[12:20] your loved ones lost all right there you
[12:25] are again see your inheritance think
[12:31] Paul told the Roman said believe on the
[12:34] Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house
[12:39] shall be saved
[12:41] you've got faith enough for your own
[12:44] self to be safe have faith enough no
[12:46] matter how wayward that four years of a
[12:48] girl is they'll be saved anyhow God
[12:50] somehow if he has to lay him on their
[12:53] faculty in your hospital dying they'll
[12:55] be saved God promises the inheritance
[13:01] when they shall be there said Isaiah oh
[13:04] they're all Springs with them they shall
[13:10] not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
[13:11] mountain saith the Lord all got a little
[13:15] spot I hope I can get you tonight for
[13:18] you just burning in our oh that comes
[13:22] back to that but now on forward then did
[13:27] you notice Moses that great miracle
[13:31] performer that's brought down Israel
[13:34] down through the land and brought him up
[13:37] to the promised land but did not place
[13:41] their inheritance to them he did not
[13:46] give them their inheritance he led them
[13:49] up to the land but Joshua divided the
[13:56] land to the people that right and Christ
[14:01] brought the church up to the place the
[14:05] were their possession
[14:07] made to them was given to them just the
[14:13] Jardin to cross but the Holy Spirit is
[14:17] the one who sets the church in order the
[14:22] Joshua of today putts the church in its
[14:25] order giving to each one gifts places
[14:31] position and he is the voice of God
[14:36] speaking to the inner man that Christ
[14:39] has saved the Holy Spirit how do you get
[14:43] that much of it
[14:44] now we're getting over into the book of
[14:46] Ephesians how the same way he's
[14:48] positionally placing the church where
[14:51] they blow a Josh we placed them in the
[14:55] natural and now the Holy Spirit is
[14:59] placing the church positionally in the
[15:02] land that's a in the position that they
[15:05] belong in their inheritance now the
[15:08] first thing he starts off here he
[15:11] addresses his letter Paul which we're
[15:15] going to find out H allows that all this
[15:18] mystery was revealed to him not in a
[15:22] seminary not by anything audience but it
[15:28] was a divine revelation all the Holy
[15:32] Ghost
[15:34] that God gave Paul knowing that the
[15:42] mystery of God he said that have been
[15:44] here since the foundation of the world
[15:46] had been revealed to him by the Holy
[15:50] Spirit and the Holy Spirit amongst the
[15:53] people were setting each one in order
[15:57] setting the church in position now the
[16:01] first thing Paul starts out here to tell
[16:04] the people is to get all the remember
[16:08] this is to the church not to the
[16:14] outsider it's the mystery and riddles to
[16:18] a man never able to understand goes over
[16:22] the top of his head he does no more know
[16:23] about it - nothing but to the church
[16:27] it's honey in the rock it's joy
[16:31] unspeakable it's a blessed assurance
[16:36] it's an anchor of the soul it's our hope
[16:42] and say it's a rock of ages' out of man
[16:47] oh it's everything that is good or
[16:52] heavens and earth will pass away but
[16:54] God's word shall never pass away but the
[16:58] man outside of Canaan knows nothing of
[17:01] it he's still wandering not saying it
[17:05] he's not a good man I don't say that I
[17:08] don't say the man even in Egypt's not a
[17:10] good man buddy
[17:12] until he has come over into this
[17:15] procession and the procession that the
[17:20] promise that was given to the church is
[17:23] not a natural iron but a spiritual and
[17:28] for we are a royal priesthood a holy
[17:34] nation
[17:37] then in this royal priesthood a holy
[17:42] nation a peculiar people called out
[17:46] elected chosen set aside the whole world
[17:51] is dead on the outside and we are led by
[17:56] the spirit sons and daughters of God are
[18:01] led by the Spirit of God not a man but
[18:07] by the spirit all in love the whole
[18:12] thing is bundled up out this has been
[18:15] tried to be taught on many times no
[18:17] doubt what great theologian says struck
[18:20] a lot deeper than I could but the thing
[18:23] I want to try to get to you is this that
[18:27] a man that is in Christ with the Holy
[18:30] Ghost can bear with the man when he's
[18:33] wrong long-suffering gentle patient he's
[18:40] sweet humble faithful filled with the
[18:45] spirit never negative always positive
[18:49] he's a different person not just the man
[18:53] that we once had it if we shall if we
[18:55] had a US Methodist or when we shout if
[18:59] we was in the land that's good it's
[19:01] alright hopefully that's you then the
[19:04] Pentecost will come along speaking with
[19:05] tongues they had everyone spoke of towns
[19:08] had it I'll be there too
[19:10] but still we found out there's a lot
[19:13] didn't have it yet outer we are now
[19:18] coming to this great history that's been
[19:23] hidden since the foundation of the world
[19:25] and now being revealed in the right
[19:28] stage to the sons of God
[19:32] you believe that to be true that sons of
[19:37] God are manifested before we even go
[19:40] anywhere let's turn over to Roman's
[19:43] eighth chapter just a minute let me read
[19:44] you something see if this is this coming
[19:51] up to what I'm speaking of you now we go
[19:53] get Romans eight the nineteenth verse of
[19:56] the of the eighth chapter of Romans for
[20:02] the earnest expectation the creation
[20:07] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[20:10] sons of God with earnest expectations
[20:21] the whole creation is waiting for the
[20:27] manifestation see the manifestation what
[20:33] is the manifestations making known the
[20:38] whole world
[20:39] the Muhammad's over here they're looking
[20:42] for all right we're here these people we
[20:49] dad's up through had a mighty rushing
[20:51] wind we've had thunders lightnings with
[20:55] at all blood we've had all kinds of
[20:59] things but we fail to hear that little
[21:03] still small voice that attracted the
[21:06] Prophet the rest are all browning them
[21:08] walked out said here my lord see how the
[21:13] whole creation is groaning and waiting
[21:17] for the manifestations are the sons of
[21:21] God now Paul is going to first place the
[21:26] church exactly work its belong now just
[21:31] to get the background let's read again
[21:33] all an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[21:36] will of God to the Saints
[21:39] that's just sainted ones which are at
[21:44] Ephesus and the
[21:45] faithful in Christ Jesus I so the class
[21:49] won't forget it how do we get in Christ
[21:53] do we join the church to get in Christ
[21:56] do we make your profession to get in
[21:59] Christ do we be immersed in water to get
[22:02] in Christ how do we get in Christ first
[22:07] Corinthians 12 chapter for by one spirit
[22:14] one capital SBIRT which is holy spirit
[22:20] we are all baptized into the promised
[22:25] land in this promised land everything
[22:30] belongs to us in the promised land seed
[22:36] for the Cullens think everything in the
[22:40] promised land when Israel crossed over
[22:42] this Jordan into the promised land fall
[22:47] down everything I remember in this
[22:50] promised land that don't mean that
[22:53] you're immune from sickness that don't
[22:56] mean that you're immune from troubles
[22:57] but it does spell this oh thank you it
[23:04] says this that it's your just rise and
[23:10] take it
[23:12] what and remember the only way that
[23:17] Israel is the man is what's in got the
[23:22] camp that's the only way we can ever
[23:25] lose a victory it's for seeing to get
[23:28] into camp something wrong somewhere
[23:32] when Athens stole that where Jeanette
[23:34] Babylonian garment scene that's in the
[23:37] camp and the battle went wrong you give
[23:42] me this father's Church tonight this
[23:44] group of people perfectly perfectly in
[23:49] the promise of God with the Holy Ghost
[23:53] walking in the spirit
[23:56] I'll challenge any disease or any of
[24:00] fiction or anything this area's ever Joe
[24:05] Lewis there is in the country with all
[24:08] of these infidelity and all the
[24:10] unbelievers that there is to bring any
[24:12] sickness or affliction in this storm
[24:14] it'll walk out of here perfectly old yes
[24:19] sir
[24:19] God gave the promise all these stain of
[24:24] unbelief can keep it away now we're
[24:28] going to get down to what this little
[24:30] stand is after awhile now that are in
[24:34] Christ Jesus grace be unto you and peace
[24:36] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
[24:38] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[24:41] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[24:44] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[24:46] places in Christ is a Christ when we are
[24:57] in Christ we have spiritual blessings
[25:03] outside of Christ we have sensations in
[25:09] Christ we have positive blessings
[25:15] not make bleach not shams not put on but
[25:21] as long as you're trying to say that
[25:23] you're in the promised land or not your
[25:27] sins will find you out and the first
[25:30] thing you know you'll find yourself
[25:32] thrown in and all as we call it in the
[25:36] world gone down you'll find out that you
[25:40] haven't got what you're talking about
[25:43] but when you're in Christ Jesus he's
[25:47] promised you heavenly peace heavenly
[25:52] blessings heavenly spirit everything is
[25:58] yours you're in the promised land and in
[26:02] full possession of everything a man how
[26:09] beautiful all let us study according as
[26:15] he has chosen us now here's where the
[26:19] church stumbled so bad according as he
[26:23] has chosen us in him in whom Christ we
[26:33] find out not a vacuum and Genesis added
[26:36] revelations revelation 17:8 that he
[26:40] chose us in Christ before the foundation
[26:44] of the world
[26:47] now the word Amira's a Nixon foundation
[26:51] of the world that we should be holy and
[26:54] without blame before him having
[26:57] predestinated us now I want to stop on
[27:01] that word of predestination now
[27:06] predestinated isn't safe I'll choose
[27:08] from there I won't choose brother
[27:13] dealers that isn't it it's the
[27:17] foreknowledge of God that node which one
[27:21] would be right and which one wasn't
[27:23] right
[27:24] so about for knowledge God knowing what
[27:29] he was going to do he predestinated by
[27:35] his foreknowledge to make all things
[27:39] work together for the good to them that
[27:42] love God that he might in the e age that
[27:46] is to come in one which is Christ Jesus
[27:55] let me draw you a little illustration
[27:57] here it's good we go back I bet I talked
[28:04] on a little bit Dylan I just struck it
[28:06] in Genesis the first chapter 126 when
[28:11] God called his name the Lord God it's in
[28:14] the Word of L Li Elohim which means this
[28:20] self existing one there was nothing else
[28:26] existed for him there was no air there
[28:31] was no light there were no war sighs
[28:33] there was no world there was no nothing
[28:36] else it was God and God alone hello Li L
[28:42] owe him now he made that inside all that
[28:50] was attributes which means that he was a
[28:55] inside of this great l li elohim was on
[29:02] after viewed r8 so you know what an
[29:06] attribute is all right let me say it
[29:08] like this or the nature that's oh the
[29:12] little feller will forget it
[29:14] I'm one of the little feller that get it
[29:16] that way
[29:20] inside of him was the nature to be a
[29:25] father but he self-existence dream
[29:32] nothing for to be a father by and now
[29:36] down inside of that was something else
[29:39] that he was God and a God is an object
[29:44] of worship but he was self-existence él
[29:49] ella ella ella him so there was nothing
[29:55] to worship him inside of that he was a
[30:00] savior
[30:02] there's nothing lost to be saved inside
[30:08] allowed he was the healer now do you get
[30:22] the picture
[30:23] so his attributes his nature
[30:29] Purdue's what is today some people say
[30:32] well why did God to stop it in the
[30:33] beginning
[30:34] he's a cruel-hearted a brute said Joe
[30:37] Louis that's wanted condemned Joe are
[30:40] jackhole think that he's just a crew
[30:43] heart and brute there's no such a thing
[30:44] is gone if there was such a thing you'd
[30:46] be a oh I just told him all kinds of
[30:48] names see but it's just because he might
[30:52] have a lot of knowledge up here but he
[30:53] ain't got nothing down here
[30:55] that's resetting this word tells it
[30:58] years and he's hid it and these
[31:01] mysteries has been hidden now remember
[31:03] the Bible said since the foundation of
[31:06] the world
[31:07] waiting for the manifestations of the
[31:10] sons of God to display them to the
[31:14] church you get it down I stopped on the
[31:23] story just a little bit or I'll bring
[31:26] I'll go to my next stop till get this I
[31:29] remember all through the ages of Moses
[31:33] back to the ages of the Prophet back to
[31:37] all ages they've waited until this
[31:41] latter days for these things to be
[31:44] displayed according to the scripture
[31:47] drive for it to be revealed to the sons
[31:51] of God why from the lost until like the
[31:57] pier maidens I have said building kosher
[31:59] closer closer as I've often made this
[32:04] remark and said God made three Bibles
[32:09] the first one he put it in the sky the
[32:12] zodiac Jefferson's zodiac
[32:15] what is the first figure in the zodiac
[32:18] the Virgin wopsle a sticker in the
[32:22] zodiac Leoline he come the first time to
[32:26] the Virgin he comes a second time as the
[32:28] Lion of the tribe of Judah in a sea he
[32:32] made the next one in the pier means back
[32:35] in the days of Enoch on the major
[32:38] pyramids and they major my don't
[32:40] understand it but to the wars where
[32:43] these stupid to all their needs for so
[32:45] long and could major the distance of the
[32:46] wars you're one of the major to now come
[32:49] across the King's Chamber and as this
[32:53] spear made went up we could not build it
[32:56] with everything that we got today we
[32:57] couldn't build it it's built right up
[32:59] like this to a point and the stone on
[33:04] the capstone never was found they never
[33:11] did put a cap on top of the pyramid I
[33:13] don't know whether you know it or not
[33:14] the big peer made of Egypt had never had
[33:16] a top stone on why the capstone was
[33:20] rejected
[33:21] Christ the headstone thing was rejected
[33:26] but as we grow from the Lutheran age
[33:30] Baptists age Methodists age Pentecostal
[33:35] age will right up to the capping stone
[33:38] now waiting and longing for that tapping
[33:43] stone to sit down the building's
[33:46] complete and not you ready to scripture
[33:49] the stone was rejected course we realize
[33:51] that was talked to the Solomon's Temple
[33:53] but the rejected stone has become the
[33:56] chief of the corner but I'm saying this
[33:58] only to make a picture to you now and in
[34:04] the Bible we're living in the last days
[34:07] the top of the pyramid the cross species
[34:11] of the cancer age in the zodiac in the
[34:16] time of the coming of the over line in
[34:20] the capping stone and in the days all
[34:24] the manifestations all the sons of God
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:29] you what we're at we're right at the end
[34:33] time how many's gonna read the paper
[34:35] this week what fruits all Sam said yeah
[34:38] well they're ready so are we oh really
[34:51] draw a day if the Christians could only
[34:54] realize the day that we're living in
[34:57] mine why do you think the writer of this
[35:00] book that's seen it and see where it
[35:03] would be manifested in the last days
[35:05] waiting and groaning for those sons of
[35:07] God to rise in the last days without
[35:10] power of the Holy Ghost at the index
[35:12] page they'll reveal the secret things
[35:15] for the foundation of the world to bring
[35:17] it up now let's go back into the
[35:20] foundations of world again you get a
[35:22] revelation to see if we were riding on I
[35:25] hope I don't make myself sacrilegious by
[35:28] calling God Papa but I want to say it
[35:32] that way showed you understanding pop
[35:35] Papa wanted some children so what did he
[35:40] do he said let there be angels and they
[35:43] come around me oh that's fine
[35:46] they worship him then he was God the
[35:49] attributes never he was el y el Ella
[35:54] Elohim self-existence nothing but he him
[35:59] the first thing come around with angels
[36:03] that angels could do to more than
[36:06] worship it couldn't be lost so they
[36:12] couldn't be sick
[36:13] they were mortal bees so he couldn't
[36:16] display his healing power
[36:18] he couldn't displayed salvation so then
[36:23] before that after that he said we'll
[36:28] make something tangible so he made her
[36:32] earth and when he made the earth he made
[36:35] all the creatures of the earth and then
[36:39] he made man everything that come up out
[36:42] of the earth starting off with a a
[36:44] Polliwog or jellyfish just the form of
[36:48] flesh floating on the water
[36:51] starting from there to from that to a
[36:54] frog which is the horse type of life
[36:57] that we can find the claim as the Frog
[36:59] high type is human being from the Frog
[37:02] who started to the lizard from the
[37:04] lizard on and on and on and every pond
[37:06] the Holy Ghost begin to breathe life
[37:11] come again great life and the first
[37:16] thing something come up in the image of
[37:19] God that was a man nothing has ever been
[37:25] never was never will be created any more
[37:29] anything higher than a man because a man
[37:32] is in the image of God
[37:35] see then man when he made his first man
[37:41] now when he made his angelic piece he
[37:44] made man created either a male and
[37:47] female all in the same unit he was both
[37:51] man and woman fiendish and masculine
[37:54] when he made Adam and put him in flesh
[37:57] remember in Genesis 1 he made man and
[38:00] woman and in Genesis 2
[38:02] there was no man yet to till the soil
[38:04] flesh man the old man that could take a
[38:08] hold of anything and till the soil that
[38:11] yet there was a man in His image and God
[38:14] is a trying see he made the first man
[38:20] mantasy they have created Heat
[38:22] damn now when he made the first man I
[38:26] remember all together he had it in his
[38:30] mind and Sunday night I went to that of
[38:33] our word is a thought expressed God
[38:40] thought how he could be God how he could
[38:44] be worshiped how he could be a healer hi
[38:46] could be his Savior and his soon as he
[38:48] spoke the word it was finished forever
[38:51] Oh
[38:53] if these sons of God master good holy
[38:57] lay hold of that word like that
[39:00] when God speaks the word is absolutely
[39:06] he might awaited chronology says that
[39:09] our archaeologist and all they claim it
[39:12] may be the world with millions and
[39:14] millions of minute I don't know we're
[39:15] part of in trillions and trillions of
[39:17] years I don't know how long it was God
[39:19] does not exist in time even he has not
[39:24] one minute less time than he did when he
[39:26] spoken today he is still guarded there
[39:31] so cavity I never knew that like that so
[39:35] the other night another morning rather
[39:38] eternal no yesterday no tomorrow it's
[39:42] all now German or war I am NOT a lodger
[39:46] I will be it's eternal I am always now
[39:53] but he wanted to put things in time he
[39:56] had to make something to worship so his
[39:59] attributes produced this then he made
[40:01] the man then in this man he looked
[40:05] lonesome so non to show now his great
[40:07] mine why he had a picture of the Christ
[40:10] in the church he tough not a different
[40:15] piece of clay and made a woman but he
[40:18] took from the side of Adam a rib and
[40:22] took from the spirit of Adam the
[40:25] feminist and put it in the Sharia when
[40:30] you see a man that acts like assistant
[40:33] is something wrong and when you see a
[40:37] woman would act like a man there's
[40:40] something wrong
[40:42] there's something wrong they are two
[40:45] different spirits all together but
[40:49] together they make one unit
[40:52] these two are wrong so he made woman and
[40:58] man and they never wash to be old never
[41:03] die never get grave never they eat they
[41:08] drank they slept just like we do but
[41:11] they never know what's in love now I
[41:14] bought a pass right here for another
[41:16] lesson sometime on the seed of the
[41:18] serpent which they asked me to recall
[41:21] that let me see somebody come show me
[41:25] something different but I will know now
[41:29] well then after all this then when since
[41:33] idioms what takes place way off yonder
[41:38] above a million hundred million miles
[41:42] there's a space that be and that is
[41:45] perfect a gobble love every time you
[41:49] make a step this way it narrows an inch
[41:53] and you know how little it would be time
[41:57] it got to the earth it's the shadow of
[42:00] the shadow of the shadows that's what
[42:04] you have that's what I have a shadow of
[42:09] shadow of shadows of a Gothel love
[42:12] there's something in you there's
[42:15] something in every woman the other past
[42:17] twenty and something that ever man in
[42:21] your past twenty that was long to remain
[42:25] you've only got five years that's from
[42:27] fifteen to twenty after twenty you start
[42:30] dying but from 15 you're just an
[42:34] adolescent child so there and then you
[42:37] mature it up to your 20 and 8 to 20 or
[42:39] you said this is good a man you just say
[42:42] that but you're not you're dying and
[42:45] you're burning away no matter what you

[42:49] God made you up let age but then you're
[42:51] going to die now what happens now you
[42:55] start

[42:59] you that says I want to be 18 again I
[43:03] wanna ask you something what if you was
[43:08] born five hundred years ago and you
[43:12] remain 18 years old until today if you
[43:15] would be an antique well your ideas are
[43:22] 500 years ago before the Pilgrim Fathers
[43:27] ever come over here and you were a young
[43:29] lady with that kind of idea why you'd be
[43:32] better off just went ahead and got over
[43:34] there five hundred years
[43:36] see there's something wrong you say well
[43:39] right now I feel pretty good for the
[43:41] family

[44:16] there's everything's uncertain you don't
[44:20] know where you're standing but yet you

[44:32] remain there and never be sick and never
[44:33] be you'll have to have other people with
[44:35] you because you'd outgrow it see people
[44:38] go on in other ages and you'd be an
[44:40] antique you'd be worse than you would be
[44:43] if you went or with them but there's
[44:46] something you call us ready to be there

[44:52] shadow that makes you something about
[44:55] here now the other night or the other
[44:59] morning at 7 o'clock when the Holy
[45:02] Spirit by His goodness and His grace

[45:09] I believe yes or no I don't say and
[45:13] entered into that land and saw those
[45:18] people and they were all young and I've
[45:24] seen the prettiest people I ever seen in

[47:02] against its mother's best and begin to
[47:05] nurse if it didn't do that the milk

[47:16] tells it walks right around to some
[47:18] other such route around and starts
[47:20] nursing ah ah

[57:34] old smoke so sick at your stomach is
[57:37] turning the inside out after taking
[57:39] castor oil
[57:40] see just as thick as you can be and rats
[57:43] running all over you're trying to eat on
[57:45] you that's the best of life and then
[57:48] somebody reach down and pick you up and
[57:51] you're a real old and can't help
[57:53] yourself and just pick you up and turn
[57:55] you to an 18 year old boy that's up on
[57:59] top of the mountain a very blue hell ma
[58:03] breath of fresh air like would you ever
[58:08] go back to that
[58:10] [Music]
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:13] dump again now that's what it means
[58:19] pretty much that's what that vision or
[58:23] translation whatever a vision I'll say
[58:25] vision cause I'm afraid that would hurt
[58:27] somebody to say translation that's what
[58:29] it was
[58:30] now there's when God what God did to
[58:34] bring sons and daughters chena who are
[58:37] these people
[58:39] how did they ever what do these people
[58:41] do to merit this how did they ever do it
[58:45] God at the beginning before angel was
[58:48] ever made how many noses in the night he
[58:53] is he is God so God in His infinite
[58:58] mercy he saw that Lucifer would do that
[59:02] if he created this he has put him on a
[59:05] free moral agency that basis and you're
[59:08] still there trying the tree of right and
[59:12] wrong set before every one of it did you
[59:14] make your choice and Lucifer was the
[59:17] first one to take the wrong road and you
[59:20] begin to draw a dream home trying to
[59:24] take all free self
[59:26] try to override somebody else and that's
[59:31] where it started
[59:32] now listen to this that's where sin
[59:37] begins God in His infinite mind saw that
[59:42] and saw the only way
[59:44] are you Trinitarian brother and I'm not
[59:46] willing to hurt you but how in the name
[59:50] of the good word of God could you ever
[59:53] place Jesus being a separate person from
[59:56] God himself
[59:59] if Jesus could take another person and
[1:00:03] make him go and die to redeem this
[1:00:06] person here he would be an unjust beam
[1:00:10] there's only one way a God could ever do
[1:00:14] it but beasts take the place himself and
[1:00:19] God became flesh that he might taste the
[1:00:22] pain of death to take the stand away
[1:00:26] from us
[1:00:29] that's why you be so worshiped Jesus was
[1:00:34] a man sure he was he was a man in the
[1:00:38] end born of the Virgin Mary but the

[1:14:27] Testament went on what a child was born
[1:14:32] in a family he was a shy when he was
[1:14:38] born because he was born of his parents
[1:14:40] he was a son all the family and heir of
[1:14:43] all things now but this son was raised
[1:14:50] by tutors the Galatians if chapter 72

[1:14:58] - razor teachers now for instance divide
[1:15:03] a son born now say I'm the father
[1:15:06] and that's reasoning that King James
[1:15:08] come and ever thought that riddle for
[1:15:10] funny in the King James Version said in

[1:50:33] human half of divine Healy's all right

[1:50:37] say well I'll be better bands a prophet
[1:50:39] but let me tell you something as long as
[1:50:42] the Spirit is on him and he's discerning
[1:50:44] he's the Lord servant but his teaching
[1:50:46] is right it's no good whoever heard of
[1:50:48] such tommyrot
[1:50:50] [Applause]
[1:50:53] either God or is no God these are all
[1:50:58] God a nun God that's way it but how you
[1:51:02] gonna head Manassas won't keep his
[1:51:05] grounding if it won't keep Israel the
[1:51:09] multi pens down they're all run out here
[1:51:11] with the bliz scenes and all but we have
[1:51:16] been born by the Holy Ghost all of us is
[1:51:18] that nice
[1:51:19] why don't we be born to predestinated an
[1:51:22] edge of these born we are predestinated
[1:51:24] unto the adoption to be placed in the
[1:51:30] body of Christ you see what I mean what
[1:51:36] is the body of Christ
[1:51:37] some are apostles some are prophets some
[1:51:43] our teachers some are evangelists and
[1:51:45] some are pastors is that right
[1:51:48] we're taught to others get some tongue
[1:51:53] interpretation of tongues wisdom
[1:51:56] knowledge miracles working and miracles
[1:52:00] all these different gifts and I wasn't
[1:52:03] do they practice that a little bit one
[1:52:05] let it run loose just like I don't know
[1:52:07] one one raise up speak in tongues daily
[1:52:10] we're talking
[1:52:12] preacher be free to make all the calls
[1:52:14] of our is that if the preacher hands you
[1:52:19] all with his message be annoyed then it
[1:52:21] beats it all back sire Steve is because
[1:52:24] you're not talk about the spirit of the
[1:52:28] prophets are subject to the property God
[1:52:30] is the author of confusion I'm standing
[1:52:34] here on our ministry or the dawning of
[1:52:37] God no matter how much you want to speak
[1:52:39] with tongues you hold your pjs God
[1:52:40] spinachy-- there you speak with tongue
[1:52:45] it can't be just some repeating of
[1:52:47] scripture called God said don't use vain
[1:52:48] repetition but it's a message directly
[1:52:51] to somebody asked me one time put your
[1:52:56] finger on one time that's the Holy
[1:52:58] Spirit every round of the discernment
[1:52:59] told somebody repeat the scripture over
[1:53:01] and over it told him something that was
[1:53:03] wrong with them and something they have
[1:53:04] done and something that they must do or
[1:53:06] something had to happen or something
[1:53:08] like that is that right
[1:53:09] so is speaking in tongues and
[1:53:11] interpretation if there's one in the
[1:53:13] church that speaks with tongues another
[1:53:14] interpretive
[1:53:15] let us say this will raise up and speak
[1:53:18] with tongues and this brother you're
[1:53:19] giving interpretation then God's with
[1:53:34] you but how are we going to do it this
[1:53:37] way see it's just half hazard in point
[1:53:41] no placing at all now that's the
[1:53:44] Ephesians are trying see they miss that
[1:53:47] these are innocent
[1:53:49] we are predestinated unto the adoption
[1:53:53] of stuff imagine we're born in the
[1:54:00] Spirit of God sure and see the Holy
[1:54:01] Ghost we cry Abba Father hallelujah door
[1:54:04] that gobblers I try for children but we
[1:54:06] can't get no word we can't whoop
[1:54:08] duplicity look at Billy Graham stand
[1:54:11] over here that Muhammad is grooving look
[1:54:16] at that go
[1:54:16] stand down you're nuts eight years at
[1:54:18] Church of Christ shaking hands with
[1:54:20] baby is down there and take his hand I
[1:54:22] supposed to be a Christian and shaking
[1:54:24] hands with the devil like Joe Louis's a
[1:54:27] free thinker and even cussed God and
[1:54:29] said there wasn't such a thing is there
[1:54:31] God any how to begin with and things I
[1:54:33] get in a church they called himself a
[1:54:35] Church of Christ shaking hands with him
[1:54:37] and taking it sides of it's better Jack
[1:54:41] goal and the Pentecost was many a
[1:54:47] McGinty will never preacher our lamp
[1:54:51] order stood toe-to-toe with him said
[1:54:53] jump
[1:54:54] bend down your power there we are where
[1:54:58] it can't be played Ephraim don't want to
[1:55:01] stay I'm gonna do a car oats is your
[1:55:21] part to raise you just for third sheep
[1:55:24] when you're supposed to herd cattle God
[1:55:27] wants to place the church tell the thing
[1:55:33] about still got that goatee nature but
[1:55:36] but but but but but but thanks you can't
[1:55:38] tell him that's right
[1:55:41] is not true then you can't place the
[1:55:45] church see the church is forced to be
[1:55:48] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:55:51] children where on man God can take a man
[1:55:55] and adopt him into the family
[1:55:57] give him something at first try that and
[1:56:01] see if it's right the Bible said tribe
[1:56:03] experience this man claims a certain
[1:56:06] things try and see if it's right if it's
[1:56:09] the right move right with them and say
[1:56:11] Lord send us something else
[1:56:13] keep moving see just keep moving never
[1:56:16] taking claims then you're going to see
[1:56:19] the Church of God beginning gets place
[1:56:21] then when the Philistines will go to
[1:56:23] pack enough
[1:56:25] the shorts of wall Carroll go down
[1:56:28] phases of the wars the guards will be
[1:56:31] missing that's right when the church
[1:56:34] begins getting to its mighty power when
[1:56:35] we have an Ananias and Sapphira you'll
[1:56:40] see we had a holy church stands together
[1:56:42] into this power positionally place the
[1:56:44] sons of God opted into the family of God
[1:56:48] powerful church standing areas glory
[1:56:51] that's what he's coming for see how far
[1:56:54] we are all brothers you can't even get
[1:56:57] together on scripture any man any man
[1:57:04] that tasty water baptism in the Bible in
[1:57:08] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:09] he's either blind or something and
[1:57:15] that's where the big five oh I'll tell
[1:57:18] any person that will bring me any
[1:57:21] scripture where anybody was ever
[1:57:24] baptized in any other name besides the
[1:57:27] name of Jesus Christ in the new church
[1:57:29] are these bad guys then the other way
[1:57:31] you had be baptized over again in the
[1:57:34] name of Jesus Christ to get the Holy
[1:57:35] Ghost you come show me there's not go
[1:57:39] such there's no such a commission when
[1:57:42] Jesus said over there go ye therefore
[1:57:44] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[1:57:46] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:57:50] father son Holy Ghost neither one's a
[1:57:53] name none of them Peter turn right ten
[1:57:56] days later said repent be baptized every
[1:57:58] one of you name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:58:00] remission sins and everywhere in the
[1:58:02] Bible and then here was someone baptized
[1:58:05] down there some other way but John just
[1:58:07] some to repentance Paul said you got to
[1:58:09] be rebaptised again you got coming in
[1:58:12] alright we did that times are great holy
[1:58:14] man Johnny baptize Jesus I this is the
[1:58:17] gospel
[1:58:19] this is a fear of God person to be
[1:58:21] revealed to me I'm an apostle of the
[1:58:24] Lord and about angel from heaven comes
[1:58:27] and preaches anything else I me read
[1:58:30] that the Bible said if an angel Paul
[1:58:33] said if an angel from heaven said
[1:58:35] anything else
[1:58:36] Bishop Archbishop Pope overseer whatever
[1:58:40] he may be if he preaches anything else
[1:58:43] besides this that I preached unto you
[1:58:45] let him be accursed
[1:58:47] there's no we have no such custom to
[1:58:50] that culture you just is just no such
[1:58:53] thing you wait and then fancy why is it
[1:58:57] people can't see that why is it people
[1:58:59] won't don't believe that see somebody
[1:59:03] hears it
[1:59:05] predestination exactly
[1:59:08] oh the father has given me come to me
[1:59:17] hi exactly all the father has given me
[1:59:21] will come that will come to me what's
[1:59:23] about me trying to find here here we all
[1:59:27] right let me just read this first and
[1:59:31] then I'll tell you about all the things
[1:59:32] this is the very message on preach
[1:59:34] tonight here's what Paul said on
[1:59:35] predestination for water baptism Jesus
[1:59:38] name the Holy Ghost baptism the setting
[1:59:40] in the church and so forth here's what
[1:59:42] he says
[1:59:43] I'm Marvel telling these Galatians that
[1:59:45] you're so soon move from him they called
[1:59:49] you under grace cry I am so ashamed in
[1:59:53] other words that you let somebody come
[1:59:56] here twist you away from that aren't you
[1:59:59] another gospel which is not another but
[2:00:03] there be some that trouble you and would
[2:00:06] pervert the gospel of Christ
[2:00:08] prevents the real gospel of Christ but
[2:00:11] what I remember it was Paul that
[2:00:15] constrained every person that had not
[2:00:19] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:00:21] Christ to come and be bad guys over
[2:00:22] again in the name of Jesus Christ I mean
[2:00:24] over
[2:00:25] I adore this Paul that said these
[2:00:29] secrets have been incidents the
[2:00:30] foundation the world had been revealed
[2:00:32] to him that we were predestinated to be
[2:00:35] the sons in the other was Paul look at
[2:00:38] what he said but though we are angel
[2:00:41] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[2:00:44] you than that which we have preached
[2:00:46] unto you let him be a curse just don't
[2:00:50] say I don't agree with you mysteries let
[2:00:52] it be a curse
[2:00:53] let me read the next verse as we said
[2:00:56] before so say I now again if any man
[2:01:00] preach any other gospel unto you than
[2:01:02] that we have already received let M be a
[2:01:07] curse right now brother sister if it was
[2:01:15] God the other day and I say that hoping
[2:01:19] not a river that taken me to see this
[2:01:22] little I get excited I don't get to get
[2:01:25] inside I just get blessed preaching I
[2:01:28] get to beside myself not keeping your
[2:01:30] tone oh you're sleepy and tired but o if
[2:01:34] you if you could only know how I want
[2:01:36] you over there
[2:01:37] and when I once I say this again when I
[2:01:42] only said I said it would do he said
[2:01:45] would you like to see what the end is
[2:01:46] and I'll look back and see myself laying
[2:01:49] there on the bed surely you've known me
[2:01:52] long enough to know that I'll tell you
[2:01:54] the truth I want to ask you something is
[2:01:57] Samuel said before the annoyance on have
[2:01:59] I ever told you anything in the name of
[2:02:01] the Lord but what was true is that right
[2:02:02] always have I ever come begged you for
[2:02:06] money or anything like that never have
[2:02:09] have I ever did anything but tried my
[2:02:12] best to lead you to cry exactly now they
[2:02:15] want to say I'm a mental telepathy you
[2:02:17] know super sentient perception is of
[2:02:20] course them things has got to ride the
[2:02:23] Bible said they would as Jamison Jamis
[2:02:26] whispered Morgan they did further the
[2:02:28] same thing Moses is so they come to a
[2:02:30] showdown
[2:02:32] but remember jammies and jammies could
[2:02:34] not heal they could not heal make a
[2:02:37] brain plagues but not take them away see
[2:02:40] all right now God is the healer God's
[2:02:43] Word remains true I have tried to be
[2:02:45] honest with you I've tried to tell you
[2:02:47] the truth for about 31 years I've stood

[2:03:17] my heart I attend you with all my heart
[2:03:21] I believe I preached to use a true
[2:03:23] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[2:03:26] believe that you should be baptized

[2:03:40] gentleness patience faith and the other
[2:03:44] day what happened to me on that horny I
[2:03:47] don't know I can say yes whether I was
[2:03:50] here at my body and you see the vision a
[2:03:52] were lost
[2:03:53] taking away from here over there I don't
[2:03:55] know I can't say all the thing I know
[2:03:58] that I I was always afraid of dying that
[2:04:01] little place of thing but not phrases
[2:04:03] Jesus would come get me now I weren't
[2:04:05] afraid of that
[2:04:06] well I didn't feel that but if I bleach
[2:04:09] and just be a little missus flying out
[2:04:11] to the hair but I see now and I've seen
[2:04:15] those people they were real yeah and
[2:04:17] they were people who once associated me
[2:04:19] here on earth even to my first wife she
[2:04:23] wasn't my wife she was my sister she
[2:04:28] never called me her husband
[2:04:29] she called me her darling brother
[2:04:33] there was no sex no feelings of that
[2:04:35] type it couldn't be it was perfect it
[2:04:38] was sweetness it was perfection
[2:04:40] I'm wondering I don't know I'm wondering
[2:04:45] is that what she sees before she left
[2:04:49] the earth when she was young in a
[2:04:51] hospital when I call her and she said
[2:04:54] Billie you had breached it you talked
[2:04:57] about it but she said you don't know
[2:04:59] what it is
[2:05:00] she said I have no more desire I wonder
[2:05:05] if that's what it is is that godly
[2:05:06] saintly old man of FF Bosworth who stood
[2:05:09] in this moping who's preaches me around

[2:10:58] dollars I believe to be three attributes
[2:11:02] absolutely I do that with all my heart
[2:11:05] Father Son Holy Spirit but they are not
[2:11:07] three God they're just three after our
[2:11:10] other three offices of God God lived
[2:11:13] once the fatherhood sonship and now the
[2:11:15] Holy Ghost it's the same God in three
[2:11:18] offices and they have and Father Son and
[2:11:21] Holy Ghost is not a no-name of God God
[2:11:25] has one name and his name is Jesus the
[2:11:29] Bible said the family in heaven is named
[2:11:31] Jesus and the family earth is named
[2:11:34] Jesus
[2:11:35] that's right so God had one name human
[2:11:39] name he was had a name called Jehovah
[2:11:41] Jireh Jove Arriba that was his titles of
[2:11:44] deity but he had one name Jesus that's
