[38:36] amen amen
[38:40] as we're still standing
[38:43] let's open our bibles
[38:46] [Music]
[38:49] we're going to read a very familiar
[38:51] scripture
[38:54] in hebrews 11.
[38:58] we'll
[39:13] of the cell connector
[39:17] now faith is the substance of things
[39:20] hoped for
[39:21] the evidence of things not seen
[39:29] for by it the elders obtained a good
[39:32] report
[39:35] let's also turn to the book of james
[39:40] james chapter 1
[39:45] i'll let brother billy read directly
[39:53] we'll read verse 2 to 4 he said my
[39:56] brethren
[39:57] count it all joy when you fall in
[40:00] diverse temptation
[40:02] knowing this that the trying of your
[40:04] faith worketh patience
[40:07] but let patients have a perfect work
[40:09] that ye may be perfect
[40:12] and the entire wanting nothing
[40:15] good
[40:18] lord bless the reading of his word
[40:20] you may have your seeds
[40:26] i believe we're happy to be in the house
[40:27] of god tonight
[40:34] the lord is placed on my heart this
[40:36] little thought
[40:38] [Music]
[40:41] that i i i
[40:43] i took after after the reading of the
[40:45] book of james
[40:50] proved i want to entitle it that the
[40:54] trying of our faith
[40:56] worketh patience
[41:03] this
[41:04] subject just came to me
[41:07] literally this afternoon
[41:10] when i was meditating
[41:18] i i was thinking about something that
[41:20] that happened to me uh the day before
[41:23] yesterday morning
[41:29] i was sitting and i was hearing from the
[41:31] computer
[41:33] [Music]
[41:36] only believe only belief
[41:39] lord i believe lord i believe lord i
[41:41] believe lord i believe
[41:46] i i i'm told to myself i think that's a
[41:49] preaching that's going on
[41:53] i i wanted to know what sermon it was
[41:58] and it was towards the prayer he was
[42:01] basically uh participating in a prayer
[42:04] lord
[42:10] yeah the computer was on screensaver
[42:12] okay
[42:14] and
[42:25] so i didn't know what message what that
[42:27] was playing
[42:34] i thought maybe my wife often time
[42:36] before she goes to bed she will play a
[42:38] message and she'll just let it play all
[42:40] the time
[42:45] i looked at the the messages that she
[42:48] was been playing the day the night
[42:49] before
[42:53] and i brought it towards the end i'm
[42:54] fast forwarded to to hear the the songs
[43:02] and when i got to the end it was a
[43:03] different song it was thinking it was
[43:05] sing uh singing take the name of jesus
[43:07] with you
[43:10] foreign so i just believe that god
[43:13] wanted to speak to me about only belief
[43:19] and uh last night around 1am in the
[43:21] morning my pharmacist
[43:24] is
[43:26] my wife was not feeling well and she
[43:28] said she wanted to go to the living room
[43:30] and listen to a sermon
[43:33] and when i was still in the bedroom
[43:38] i heard the same song play while she was
[43:40] listening
[43:43] and then i came out to see what what
[43:46] message it was
[43:50] and then i saw it was a message
[43:52] greater than solomon is here
[43:56] and as i was thinking about that this
[43:58] afternoon
[44:02] the lord had placed on my heart to speak
[44:04] a little bit about faith
[44:06] la foreign
[44:10] faith we know is the very foundation of
[44:12] christianity
[44:16] because the bible tells us that all that
[44:18] comes to the lord dwells
[44:36] so the main thing that god is asking us
[44:40] is to believe it that's what to have
[44:43] faith
[44:44] may perform who knows that person did
[44:46] you but sometimes we come to god
[44:48] awakening uniformental with some mental
[44:51] faith
[44:54] sometimes we suppose we have faith
[44:57] but what the temptation comes
[45:00] difficulty
[45:01] when when when difficulties arises no
[45:04] faison we fail
[45:09] we forget that we have confessed that we
[45:12] have faith in our country
[45:15] and as we read in the book of hebrews
[45:22] the faith as the bible says it is a
[45:25] substance of things hoped for
[45:30] and the evidence of things that are not
[45:32] seen
[45:35] it means we have a firm assurance
[45:40] even when the world around us doesn't
[45:43] see the thing
[45:50] we have a firm assurance that that thing
[45:52] exists
[45:56] as long as our five senses
[46:10] that something exists because we heard
[46:12] it tell tasha that this bastard
[46:15] something exists because we've touched
[46:17] it
[46:18] [Music]
[46:20] some something exists because we've
[46:22] smelled it
[46:24] or because we have tasted of it
[46:38] [Music]
[46:40] that
[46:44] that it only takes for god to promise
[46:47] something
[46:49] for us it exists
[46:52] for us that thing is real
[46:54] it's a set
[46:56] and it's that kind of faith that god
[46:58] wants us to have
[47:02] and sometimes when we believe that
[47:05] we can have a superficial faith
[47:08] we come
[47:22] that
[47:37] that you have come to the stage
[47:41] that it's god that you know
[47:44] he's he's faithful
[47:47] that nothing is impossible to him
[47:51] that if you only believe you set it to
[47:53] the moment all that he's asking you to
[47:55] do
[47:57] is only to believe quite unique only
[48:00] belief
[48:03] the the remaining things is not
[48:18] but the devil will not truly you will
[48:20] not let you just believe
[48:23] that he will try all things to put
[48:26] obstacle in your presence
[48:29] he will do everything to try to
[48:31] discourage you
[48:40] but for god to bring your faith higher
[48:44] it has to bring you to trials
[48:50] if you have never come to trials
[48:53] you're not uniform you only have a
[48:55] mental faith
[48:57] you suppose you have faith
[49:00] you
[49:14] is to believe
[49:26] we see in the bible the patriarch uh job
[49:31] the scripture says job was an honest
[49:33] person
[49:35] job went to church
[49:41] and he knew according to the
[49:43] of freedom
[49:44] that he had to offer a sacrifice
[49:48] for his own sin
[49:50] and for the sin of his children
[49:53] he had the habit of doing it
[49:56] he was doing it by faith
[50:00] but his faith was never trialled
[50:06] but one day the devil realized that job
[50:09] was going to church
[50:24] the devil
[50:48] [Music]
[50:51] the devil said well he loves you because
[50:53] you blessed them
[50:56] he he loves you because he's quiet
[50:58] everything is quiet
[51:01] he loves you because he's never gone
[51:03] through difficulties let's
[51:06] let me touch him just a little bit
[51:11] and we'll see if he really has faith
[51:15] in one day
[51:17] look job lost everything that he had
[51:20] sure
[51:21] he lost his children kelly proof what
[51:24] what a trial
[51:25] jury proof what what the strong trial
[51:30] it was difficult for job
[51:33] but by faith
[51:42] [Music]
[51:48] blessed be the name of the lord
[51:51] he remained firm
[51:55] but the devil didn't stop there
[51:57] he went back to god
[52:00] just said that
[52:03] and you look at the trial that job was
[52:06] able to withstand that
[52:08] this great temptation
[52:11] his faith was trial
[52:14] and he showed that he had faith
[52:29] he said i want to share something i
[52:32] wanna touch his health
[52:36] and god said you can touch his health
[52:40] but i put the limit around him
[52:42] don't touch his life
[52:48] when god allows for the temptation to
[52:50] come to us
[52:54] the bible tells us in the book of
[52:55] lamentation chapter three
[53:09] the highest that these things come
[53:11] through
[53:27] we have to know that everything that
[53:28] comes to us the jerky donor is god who
[53:32] gives permission
[53:34] and when he gives permission
[53:38] it means he wants to show something
[53:40] behind godzilla
[53:43] because god does nothing for nothing
[53:51] he was he was he was a hit
[53:54] dude
[54:06] he says you continue to go to that
[54:08] church message
[54:16] don't you realize that the god of that
[54:18] message doesn't love you
[54:22] tell me in this country
[54:27] have you ever heard about somebody who
[54:29] suffer like you did
[54:33] how can you how can this god who's whose
[54:36] definition is a good god
[54:39] a god who loves his children
[54:43] he can allow that you find yourself in
[54:45] such a state
[54:48] it says uh curse god and die is
[55:07] and when they tried when the faith of
[55:09] job was trialed
[55:13] when god showed that i saw that job had
[55:16] patience
[55:17] is
[55:20] he was under the impression that god was
[55:22] no longer hearing him
[55:26] it says oh if i can know and knock at
[55:28] his door
[55:31] job began to look for the door where he
[55:34] can find god
[55:36] [Music]
[55:37] he comes to us sometimes
[55:41] you have the impression that god is no
[55:43] longer hearing your prayers
[55:45] but be certain my brother year for
[55:47] myself be sure to my sister
[55:51] that god is never far
[55:55] he's only been getting to try your faith
[55:59] to give you patience
[56:02] so you can have more confidence in him
[56:06] and when job stood firm
[56:09] god came on
[56:12] in his time
[56:20] [Music]
[56:36] he was no longer caring about his own
[56:38] life he had the memphis
[56:40] they're twisting
[56:41] the worm eat the flesh
[56:45] even if this sickness takes me away
[56:49] i know i will see god
[56:52] it will not be the eyes of another
[56:55] but it will be my own eyes
[57:21] he didn't even know that god was going
[57:23] to return a hundredfold
[57:50] what god promised was real
[58:00] and god blessed job and he gave him more
[58:03] than what he had
[58:04] another patriarchy
[58:07] another another patriarch that god
[58:09] trialled abraham abraham
[58:12] the father of faith
[58:15] abraham
[58:17] abraham at 75 years old safam so
[58:20] sonsenko his wife 65.
[58:24] past menopause many years ago
[58:28] they stayed as a couple for years and
[58:30] years
[58:32] sarah couldn't conceive
[58:34] abroad
[58:38] abraham was not even longer thinking
[58:40] about having a child with with with
[58:42] sarah abraham
[58:45] abraham was an idolater empire he was a
[58:48] pagan
[58:50] like you and i we were me
[58:53] but he found grace before the lord
[58:58] in those all of those that came from
[59:00] mesopotamia
[59:02] abraham found grace jerusalem god said
[59:06] come out of your country
[59:08] come out of your house
[59:11] go to a place that i will show you
[59:16] abraham only
[59:17] only followed he only obeyed
[59:20] he believed
[59:22] that the one who spoke to him
[59:25] was faithful
[59:29] abraham went to a a foreign land
[59:34] for me
[59:35] but he knew that someone promised him a
[59:37] place
[59:38] abraham went
[59:41] abroad
[59:43] he had multiple experiences with god
[59:47] abraham knew god
[59:50] and then one day god visited visited
[59:52] abraham
[59:55] and then he told him
[59:57] you will have a child
[1:00:30] let him leave us alone with us that
[1:00:32] story
[1:00:35] abraham can go and have his son with a
[1:00:38] child with agar
[1:00:40] judi
[1:00:54] it was god himself
[1:00:59] god said to abraham
[1:01:04] but
[1:01:05] abraham believed
[1:01:08] abraham testified
[1:01:12] that he would have a child with his wife
[1:01:14] sarah
[1:01:17] and every day we'll ask sarah
[1:01:20] you say something
[1:01:22] no
[1:01:33] and he waited for the promise for 25
[1:01:35] years
[1:01:40] god tried the faith of abraham for 25
[1:01:44] years
[1:01:47] and abraham continue to believe that god
[1:01:50] will do something
[1:02:12] and then one day god himself
[1:02:15] he came and he makes himself known as el
[1:02:18] shaddai
[1:02:30] to the point that sarah who was an old
[1:02:32] woman the brother catholicism of more
[1:02:35] than 80 years old
[1:02:40] was going to be a light by a young king
[1:02:45] to the point that he wanted a young king
[1:02:47] wanted to marry here
[1:02:49] why
[1:02:52] because god made them young
[1:02:56] she brought so he could work on her body
[1:03:00] so she can be ready to have a child
[1:03:02] jacob
[1:03:04] god is able to do everything
[1:03:07] when he makes a promise
[1:03:10] he may not tell us how he's going to
[1:03:12] bring it apart
[1:03:14] but all he's
[1:03:40] the same god who likes to try the faith
[1:03:43] abraham he says abraham
[1:03:46] i want you to offer me your son don
[1:03:48] unique your only son
[1:03:51] kelly proof what a trial
[1:03:53] of what office get offer me your child
[1:03:57] your only child
[1:04:00] the one that you i waited for a hundred
[1:04:02] years in my family
[1:04:04] and my that my wife had had her at eight
[1:04:07] years old
[1:04:09] you want me to give it to you just give
[1:04:10] up
[1:04:11] what is going to be left of me
[1:04:16] someone else could have said
[1:04:20] will sarah be able to have another child
[1:04:24] he came one time but will he do it the
[1:04:27] second time
[1:04:28] but abraham knew because
[1:04:32] that's the one who fulfilled this
[1:04:33] promise two second demons all that he's
[1:04:36] asking
[1:04:37] i will do it
[1:04:49] what will happen after the sacrifice
[1:05:04] he took everything that was needed for
[1:05:06] the sacrifice
[1:05:08] the wood the food the fire
[1:05:10] they went together
[1:05:13] they came to somewhere
[1:05:16] he asked the servants to remain behind
[1:05:18] he didn't
[1:05:20] exactly he says my son and i isaac lose
[1:05:23] the lord we're gonna go worship
[1:05:26] and we will come back
[1:05:29] he didn't say i will come back
[1:05:33] even though he knew he was going to
[1:05:35] sacrifice the child
[1:05:37] what i said will go
[1:05:40] but we will come back
[1:05:43] abraham knew
[1:05:46] that he was still a trial
[1:05:48] above the left
[1:06:03] and as we're going together
[1:06:08] isaac began to send something
[1:06:10] he says father
[1:06:12] here's the word
[1:06:14] yes the fire
[1:06:16] where's the sacrifice
[1:06:20] abraham by revelation
[1:06:22] it says god himself
[1:06:25] will provide a sacrifice for himself
[1:06:29] it is just a proof
[1:06:31] that god will provide a sacrifice for
[1:06:33] himself
[1:06:37] abraham never hesitated in his trial
[1:06:40] that let's just go buddha to continue to
[1:06:43] go to the end of what god had asked him
[1:06:45] to do
[1:06:47] is he tied isaac
[1:06:50] and isaac all obediently obedient
[1:06:54] he knew that his father was a servant of
[1:06:56] god
[1:06:58] he was a prophet of god
[1:07:00] that all that he was doing
[1:07:02] it was the will of god
[1:07:05] he he let his hand be tied behind
[1:07:09] he placed isaac
[1:07:13] and as he was getting ready to
[1:07:14] accomplish what god asked him to do
[1:07:17] the voice of god came out
[1:07:20] abraham
[1:07:23] now i know
[1:07:26] i tried your faith
[1:07:28] i know that you love me
[1:07:30] you just said that you are confused i
[1:07:32] know that you have confidence in me
[1:07:36] and because of this that posterity your
[1:07:39] prosperity
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:06] the bible said the seed of abraham will
[1:08:09] will possess the gates of the enemy
[1:08:13] is a temptation or trial coming before
[1:08:16] you tonight
[1:08:19] he says trump coming before you tonight
[1:08:22] according
[1:08:23] because of the faith of abraham
[1:08:26] god is telling you tonight
[1:08:29] that you may possess that gate
[1:08:32] like the most of them regardless of what
[1:08:34] the what the dimension of the door is
[1:08:52] and god is going to try your faith too
[1:08:57] god wants to be sure
[1:09:00] that this is my child
[1:09:04] regardless of what happened to him
[1:09:07] he will keep his head high
[1:09:10] he will keep the faith
[1:09:13] he will always be have confidence
[1:09:19] another testimony of the trying of the
[1:09:22] faith
[1:09:23] the three hebrew children
[1:09:26] we know the story
[1:09:29] they were in
[1:09:31] in a strange land a strange country
[1:09:47] that memphis they even uh uh i tried to
[1:09:50] to to uh uh
[1:09:53] uh
[1:09:55] mph
[1:09:56] yeah
[1:09:57] they trapped them they tried to trap
[1:09:59] them okay offers all us that you deliver
[1:10:02] prophet in making a statue of the
[1:10:04] prophet daniel daniel he allowed the
[1:10:07] mother and they asked him to worship him
[1:10:13] they said god told us
[1:10:16] that the worship comes to him himself
[1:10:19] only him
[1:10:21] we know that that's a servant of god
[1:10:23] surely
[1:10:24] god uses him
[1:10:28] but we're not going to worship his
[1:10:29] stature
[1:10:31] we're not going to worship him
[1:10:36] because according to the word that he
[1:10:39] himself brought to us
[1:10:42] we have to believe
[1:10:54] regardless of the fanta
[1:10:56] fanaticism that comes forth
[1:11:01] it comes that god may use a man of god
[1:11:04] in a powerful manner
[1:11:08] that the fanatics around him they begin
[1:11:11] to lift him up
[1:11:14] sometimes we even bring him where he
[1:11:16] becomes a god
[1:11:19] to receive the honor that only belongs
[1:11:21] to god
[1:11:23] but according to the word of god
[1:11:30] regardless of what a man of god can do
[1:11:34] it's god who's using him
[1:11:39] and the glory only comes back to god
[1:11:44] look at jesus
[1:11:48] the scripture says he didn't think it
[1:11:50] robbery to be equal with god
[1:11:54] but he humbled himself
[1:11:58] these three hebrew children isabella
[1:12:00] they had faith
[1:12:03] they knew they knew in whom they had
[1:12:05] believed
[1:12:21] the king called them
[1:12:23] he said i love you very much
[1:12:27] i don't want to lose you
[1:12:29] i'll do it
[1:12:31] just worship the statue
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:34] they
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:13:03] they didn't know how god was going to
[1:13:04] deliver them
[1:13:06] but they had faith be quiet they were
[1:13:08] believing
[1:13:11] that god was able to deliver them
[1:13:32] it says fear is the greatest uh uh
[1:13:37] curse that could exist on the believer
[1:13:42] it's the greatest curse and quality
[1:13:59] when this animal was making a noise
[1:14:02] he was going back
[1:14:03] and the animal was getting bigger
[1:14:05] he makes a noise
[1:14:07] he goes back
[1:14:08] the animal gets better
[1:14:10] and that animal get got
[1:14:12] bigger complement and he understood
[1:14:15] there's something that's not going right
[1:14:18] when the animal makes a noise
[1:14:20] he says he makes choice he makes blue
[1:14:22] whoa
[1:14:24] the animals go down
[1:14:26] he
[1:14:40] it says that's the devil but when he's
[1:14:42] just exist he's just looking
[1:14:46] i will feel
[1:14:47] to scare you
[1:14:50] and when you have fear
[1:14:52] he takes most steps
[1:15:08] so if you can believe that the devil can
[1:15:10] manipulate you
[1:15:12] he will do it very well message you has
[1:15:15] to fail but if you stand firm
[1:15:19] believing that god is faithful get your
[1:15:21] feet you are a son of god
[1:15:24] regardless of the trial
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] god will defend you
[1:15:31] god will hold on you i'll offend you at
[1:15:34] the end of the trial
[1:15:49] the greater the testimony
[1:15:54] the trying of our faith
[1:15:58] will produce patience
[1:16:02] it will produce confidence in god
[1:16:19] there is a testimony
[1:16:22] that god does nothing for nothing
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:26] but talks about the child who was born
[1:16:30] it says why was this child born blind
[1:16:43] to let this child testify in the middle
[1:16:46] in the midst of the sacr uh of the high
[1:16:49] priest and all of them
[1:16:53] when god allows something to come
[1:16:56] as believers
[1:17:00] we have to believe that he will manifest
[1:17:02] his glory satan from there this child
[1:17:05] who was born blind
[1:17:07] he met jesus
[1:17:11] jesus opened his eyes
[1:17:13] he let a little one he went to testify
[1:17:15] let's sacrifice
[1:17:17] the the priest to high priest
[1:17:23] they wanted him to deny his testimony he
[1:17:26] defended you it says bless god set up my
[1:17:29] temperature this man is a sinner
[1:17:32] ready
[1:17:33] he said sinner
[1:17:35] i don't know
[1:17:38] but i know that god doesn't listen to
[1:17:40] sinners
[1:17:42] he says what happened it did two seconds
[1:17:44] you said i said all that i know
[1:17:47] it's that i was blind they're meant to
[1:17:48] know and now
[1:17:50] i see
[1:17:52] ricky
[1:17:53] and it's him who open my eyes
[1:17:56] cannot
[1:18:17] what's the testimony of your child
[1:18:20] he says
[1:18:24] he's old enough to speak for himself
[1:18:27] that he let him speak for himself
[1:18:30] because they didn't live that testimony
[1:18:35] their their own faith was not tried
[1:18:38] performing
[1:18:40] sometimes we only speak of testimony of
[1:18:42] ours
[1:18:45] god wants that every single one of us
[1:18:47] has his own testimony
[1:18:51] but we cannot have a testimony
[1:18:54] if we are not tried
[1:18:57] no no
[1:18:58] we cannot have a testimony
[1:19:01] if we have not fought
[1:19:07] [Music]

[1:20:33] what permanent faith is faith can get me

[1:25:16] 66 years sitting on a wheelchair
[1:25:22] god knew it
[1:25:29] and when he was about 85 86 years old
[1:25:33] he comes in a meeting of buddha
[1:25:36] and god gives a vision to barbara's
[1:25:51] all the way to the end of his life
[1:25:55] 66 years
[1:25:58] but god knew it
[1:26:01] god could have healed him all the time
[1:26:05] don't you thought but god waited 66
[1:26:09] years
[1:26:11] to bring him his healing
[1:26:14] the time time belonged to god
[1:26:18] but he wants to try our faith
[1:26:21] and to know if we are faithful
[1:26:25] he could try us as young young ones in
[1:26:28] school
[1:26:32] to get into the conversations that are
[1:26:33] not good at in school
[1:26:38] but god wants you to testify that you
[1:26:40] are a christian
[1:26:42] that you may testify that you are a
[1:26:44] christian
[1:26:47] that you may hold regardless of the
[1:26:48] trial
[1:26:50] god is going to try you you focus but he
[1:26:52] wants you to stand firm evocation he
[1:26:55] wants you to have faith
[1:27:01] god tries our faith
[1:27:05] and it's when our faith is tried
[1:27:08] that we have patience
[1:27:11] that we have the testimony
[1:27:14] that we have more assurance
[1:27:22] second time it becomes a little bit
[1:27:24] easier let's give mr vanquish
[1:27:26] because we know that that same god
[1:27:28] who had done the last time
[1:27:30] he's
[1:27:42] i believe in him
[1:28:00] and here not long ago a lady came into
