meditate upon the words that we've heard this morning and what god has made us in him there is a power in the bride of jesus christ in the end time to speak the word and you can have a faith in what you speak because if your heart is aligned with the word of god and your desires according to the word then you can have what you ask [Music] i believe it's the desire of god that your family would be sealed you start thinking about that loved one or that one that's sick and whatever it is on your heart god is wanting to use you to be that vehicle to bring forth his word to pass let's just go before him heavenly father we love you with all of our heart lord because you first loved us we're thankful lord that you've provided us a little place to gather together and we have such wonderful brothers and sisters a precious like faith that we can sing the songs of zion and be able to worship you lord in spirit and in truth and now as we come to the preaching of the word lord [Music] i know there's nothing to myself that i could do but lord we invite you to come lord that you would be the one to turn the pages and break the bread of life to your people we're needy tonight lord we know that we have a long ways to go but we're thankful that you've brought us a long ways we're thankful that we're in your hands lord so we just commit this service to you the people the preaching of the word and ask all these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord you'll turn in your bibles to mark chapter chapter 11 verse 20. and as you're turning there uh we just want to remember our pastor in prayer um he's not feeling well he's in the back uh taking in the service but i just remember him in prayer amen we'll be reading uh mark 11 verse 20 through 25. amen how's everybody feeling tired those things seem to happen after a big weekend but by the grace of god we can just enter into his presence for a little bit and feast on the word of god mark 11 verse 20 says and in the morning as they passed by and saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curseth is withered away and jesus answered and saith unto him have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you why don't you go ahead and put your name in that as we read that again god is speaking to somebody tonight therefore i say unto matthew what things so ever ye desire when you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses amen we just ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated man i just want to speak to you uh this evening maybe if we're just to carry along the same lines of what we spoke a few services ago to you on have faith and what you are and as a subject i'd i would like to um maybe have a subject accepting god's challenge and by god's grace if we get to that part but i want to read this out of perfect faith it says now faith is based on forgiveness then and we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger amen is that your heart's desires to see apostolic times moving amongst us that is what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want to see it such a flow it'll be a help to us us flow out to others remember jesus as we had a lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for just reading that portion again jesus he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for if if if that's what jesus power was for others then we should know that in our own selves as we've received the holy ghost and the power that is laying within the believer it's not just for ourselves to live an overcoming life but god has has placed something inside of you that could be used for others and last time as we spoke we we spoke about advancing our borders and going after lost loved ones and and seeking lost souls and using the power of god in your life for the benefit of others amen do you do you believe god can do that in the individual do you believe that that's god's desire god wants to use you he wants to use your life to go after others and to have an effect and as i thought about that i was reminded about that story brother branham tells how how they during one of the meetings there was a young mother and she had her baby and the baby just kept uh fussing and it couldn't quiet down and she knew something was wrong and and there was this uh older mother there and she she saw this young one and and saw the struggle and something came upon her heart and she said you know i just want to go pray for the baby but see something in her heart kept telling her who am i to do that she's like my she she has a prayer card and and she's going to go up and have the prophet pray for who who is little old significant me that i would go pray for this baby uh when she has the opportunity to stand before the prophet and and she just kind of she she kind of quenched the still small voice has anybody ever quenched the still small voice god is putting something on your heart something that god is wanting you to do he's trying to move you a certain direction but what do you do you start to reason within yourself is that really the voice of god to me is is that really what god wants me to do and you start to wonder and then you start to think of your how insignificant you are in your abilities and who am i to be able to say or to do something like that and before you know it if you're not careful you let that opportunity pass you by but but god here put that burden back on this mother's heart and she said you know i just can't get away from it i i i just go over to her and i tell you a lot of times it's in the approach if you could just find the right approach she she found in her heart the way that she could approach this young mother and she came to her and said oh you look i know that that you you may have a prayer card and the prophet is going to pray for you but if you could just for my sake too just to appease this burden that i feel upon my heart that i might be able to pray for your baby and the young mother said oh sure that would be wonderful go ahead and pray for the baby and and as the story goes this young mother now she's going through the prayer line and as she's going through the prayer line also the prophet goes into a vision and he says look that baby i see you were standing up there and there was another mother there and she saw the condition of the child and there was something on her heart god put a desire on her heart to pray for that baby and when she prayed for that baby your baby was healed look uh no doubt that if that woman wouldn't have heeded the call of god for her to go through that baby i believe the permissive will would have been because it's god's will that we are healed it's god's word that we are healed by his stripes we are healed but god wanted to use that woman god wanted to use that mother as the vehicle to bring the word into manifestation and she surrendered to the still small voice and she carried out the word of god and it took a profit there to stand there in a vision and say look this one she was obedient to the still small voice and she prayed for that baby and that baby is healed i don't need to pray for that baby it's already healed do you believe god can do that with you in your life if you'd become conscious of the still small voice and who you are and what god made you that's what we want to speak about a little bit tonight is who you are what god made you we want to have faith in what we are in the promises of god and what he's made the bride of jesus christ in the end time that we have the power of the spoken word that we can take god at his word we can go out and lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well i know i get excited and i get amped up and i scream a little bit but look past the veil a little bit let's let god speak to our heart tonight that helps me maybe to get past my insecurities and my inabilities and things like that i know i might say that a lot but oh we're not here just to play church tonight we're here to enter into the presence of god we're here to look past the veil this evening we're here to look god in his face and look into the book and see the pages opened up to us that we might realize who we are in christ jesus that we can do the greater works that we can't speak the word that we can't say to this mountain it shall be moved oh glory to god there's a perfect faith that is rising up in the believer in the end time by the spoken word of god that has been unveiled by the prophet of the hour oh he goes on to say in perfect faith he says you're a christian you have a right to any redemptive blessing that jesus died for it's all yours it's all yours is it too loud for y'all out there is it perfect for me up here i can hear myself it's all yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it and know that it is yours and you can possess it oh that's conquering faith no oh my jesus said destroy this tabernacle and i'll raise it up in three days because there was a prophecy under jonah as jonah was in the belly of the well for three days jesus christ knew who he was so he could speak the word knowing who he was and that's exactly where the bride of jesus christ is in the end time we know who we are because a vindicated prophet has come the son of man has been revealed and he's spoken words of life into the bride of jesus christ and she's told you who you are then if you know who you are can you not speak the word concerning yourself come on now so many times we're afraid and we shrink back to speak the very words that was spoken to you i think of abraham the father of our faith god spoke to abraham and he said you're going to have a son and in the face of all obstacles in the face of his disability and in no ability within himself to bring forth the promise abraham the father of faith stood right there and said i'm going to have a son why because it wasn't abraham's word it wasn't what abraham can do it was what god told abraham how much more can the bride of jesus christ stand here and declare the words that we've heard by a vindicated prophet when he stood there and and unveiled the mighty god unveiled before us proving he was the same yesterday today and forever discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and he would stand there and tell you you never did it in the first place you are justified oh i tell you you can stand with the revelation tonight and know that you are the sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ not because of any ability you have not because of something that you've done but because god said so and he did more than saying it he vindicated it and he proved it he come down and became a kinsmen redeemer and he took all of your sins to calvary it is finished why can't we stand up then and declare what christ has done for you oh come on there ought to be a liberty in the house of god to set you free from all the condemnation set you free from the things that you're palin set you free from your inabilities and the times you've fallen and you failed time and time again and you've got all this condemnation heaped up in your life and you're just wondering if you're ever gonna make it oh why don't you say what the word says god said you're gonna make it you're going to make it you're an overcomer you're the very manifested word of the hour why don't you have faith in what god has made you oh hallelujah i get excited about that because i know what i was i know what i was capable of i know the sins that i used to do i know how bad it was for me oh i didn't have a chance in the world everybody counted me out or even my own family could have counted me how they tried to kick me out they tried to do it because they knew something was wrong oh but god didn't count me out god knew that i'd place something on the inside of the man that it was his own seed a gene seed of god that it would never fall it would never fail because it was a part of god himself oh praise god when you get a revelation of that oh let all hell rage let the trials come let the persecution come let all the faults and failures be brought up before you you'll be like that woman at the well said come see a man yeah i might have made a lot of bad decisions i made it i might have done a lot of bad things but come see a man who discerned the thoughts and intents of my heart oh he told me where i come from he told me where i'm going he told me all about it and i am so free i'm so delivered oh come see in the hand who told me where i came from come see a man that told me where i'm going come see a man that told me i am not defeated i am an overcomer that i am victorious that i'm part of the word of god i'm bone of his bone and flesh of the flesh oh come see a man who's told me all about it oh hallelujah oh that ought to stir up a victory in the heart that'll stir up a shout in the camp of the living god tonight to know who you are oh but we have such a problem of having faith in that we were so challenged in our mind in the carnal mind and all of the reasoning but we want to move into a perfect faith jesus could say that about himself because he knew who he was he would say the prophet of god would go on to say he knew it would happen before he could predict that it would happen because he knowed it would happen and whatever he predicted come to pass now why because christ knew who he was so then he could speak the word and knowing who he was that he was a messiah how much more can the bride of christ speak i can say hey i'm going in a rapture i i'm going to be changed this mortal body is going to be changed and going to put on perfection you can stand there with a sure confidence by revelation and speak the word concerning yourself because it's thus saith the lord you don't have to wonder about it you don't have to worry you don't have to guess if you're going to manifest it no you're going to manifest it because it's the spoken word of god that's why we don't fear death we don't fear sickness we don't fear any of the things that come upon the believer because the only thing that it's doing is it's it's giving you character it's giving you a gold that's tried and fire so when the sicknesses come and the persecution comes that's why the believer can joy hallelujah he can joy in the midst of his trial he can joy in the infirmities when the devil's pouring it on oh a believer knows where he's standing because he knows who he is and say oh if i lose my loved ones if those that go from around me if i don't see the manifestation of my healing in this natural party if i go by the way of the grave there's a perfect healing for me because i know when this tabernacle is dissolved i already have another body waiting for me put me in the grave scatter me out over the ocean i don't care what you do i'm going in a rapture i'm going in the resurrection if i go by way of the grave or if i'm standing on this earth and the dead in christ are raised first one thing i can tell you i can stand here and declare to you i am going in a rapture i don't have to doubt it i don't have to fear it i don't have to wonder if it's going to pass it shall come to pass just as jesus could stand there and say destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again now watch whatever he said god honored what he said think of that whatever jesus said god brought it to pass so he knowed his words were god's words he knowed god's words he knowed his words were god's words now look the same scripture comes right back into us again all right come on now oh hallelujah look that same scripture comes right back into us again if you say to this mountain oh no no we we we always can recognize the word and the prophet we can always recognize the word and brother branham we can always recognize the word in peter and john we could always recognize the word and abraham and elijah and even in the hebrew children oh we can look into all the patriarchs and we can always see the word in them but when it comes to that word which was christ which was god himself and abraham it was god in the hebrew children it was god and elijah it was john and john the baptist and jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that he poured into christ he poured out into the church then i say when that holy ghost has come to that predestinated seed of god then it's god in you oh if you say to this mountain that same scripture comes right back into us again if you say to this mountain oh my now when the same god comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you okay brother matthew you're going a little too far i i can't accept that if you only knew my faults and my failures and how many times i've tried to follow this message no let's get our eyes off the cardinal now let's put our spiritual thinking cap on this is we we're not playing church this isn't brother matthew's words this is it this isn't a man speaking to you oh but if by faith you can catch that god himself is speaking to the predestinated seed that he planted to receive the very spoken word that he spoke whoo now when the same god comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you please to honor your word what your decision is what was joshua's decision stand still son and it stood there amen sure what was moses decision held his stick over the river like that then called for it to open and it opened seat whatever you ask and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt see in your heart but believe that you'll have what you said will come to pass you can have what you said that puts you back in the word now that's not some skim milk there see that puts you back in the word look the prophet of god said real genuine faith will catch that this this promise puts you back in the word well if you are in the word what you are the gene seed of god you are the word why does it put you back in the word because you are the word so when you hear the word what faith cometh by hearing the word then if he said it it's producing a perfect faith and the believer to take the word and manifest it oh don't shrink short of that look if joshua could stand there and say son be still if if moses could stand there and say be still and know of the the the that i am god in the waves and the ocean would open up god is trying to bring us to a perfect faith in this hour by the opening of the word and the third pool that is now in the bride that you have the power of the spoken word what did the prophet of god say and looked away to jesus in december 12 29 he said look i now know what the third pull is and i know what it does i want to tell you that the opening of the word does something it goes into action it goes and uses its power for others look we are the final voice to the final generation where is the voice of god now oh no no no no don't don't don't don't lose me now but where is the voice of god if god is in you is greater than is he that is in you then he that is in the world if god is veiling himself in the bride then i want to ask you who should it be that is speaking through you it should be none other than god it should be god's voice that is speaking it should be god's hands that are reacting it should be god's feet that are walking god wants to use your body just as he would call a couple brothers in our church to go down to the hospital and say a prayer what was it it was god and two disciples going on down the road to walk into a hospital and by divine promise and say look if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's not a man's word and that wasn't a man's will that was the will of god and it was god in the man and god will back up his promised word every time if you have faith in who you are you can stand upon the word of god and you can speak the word and god is duty-bound to back it up every single time i'll stand and declare the gospel if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover try god i want to tell you he is not a liar and if you have had hands laid on and you're believing to be healed i want to tell you thus say the lord you are healed i have authority by the divine word of the hour to tell you why because the word says it oh brother matthew what are you talking about even the prophet didn't do it well i know i'm not trying to get fanatical and go out there i understand in this mortal realm that we get sick in our body but god allows sickness to come that he can prove that he's a healer he wants to express those attributes uh so beautifully our pastor going through those things look god god allows these things to happen and because we don't see it manifested the way we think of does not change god's program that's where we get ourselves in trouble is because we get into how we believe it should happen your duty bound to the word of god and if god puts it in your heart you speak the word and let it be according to the word that you've spoken because it's not your words it's not your words it's his word every time the prophet of god would talk about the third poll and he would say uh it wasn't what i spoke it was what he spoke he said let it be squirrels and you would say he spoke it every single time and you look how you go well what do you mean brother random you keep saying you're the one that spoke it but but but you you said it but but every time you refer back to it you say you said it was he that said it why because there's a union it's a uniting time where the bride and jesus christ are becoming one and if the pride is saying it christ is saying it if christ is saying it the pride is saying it why because they become one flesh they have the same mind they have the mind of the word of god let this mind pee in you which was also in christ jesus the spirit and the pride say come oh i say there ought to be a cry in the heart of the pride of jesus christ in the end time that are saying come oh why don't you come gather around the carcass of god's word where the eagles are gathered oh why don't you feast upon the body where's son of man there has been a word that has opened up that we should be inviting some to come and feast upon the word of the hour oh well i live for it hallelujah oh god help us help us lord jesus oh that same god comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you please to honor your word that's not skim milk please to honor your word what your decision is think about that what your decision is i believe there's a place that we can come to where we're so died out to our own thoughts and died out to our own ideas to where our thinking is his thinking where thy word have i hid in my heart you're meditating upon the word day and night you're listening to the prophet's message you're reading the message books looking as you're feeding upon that word and those thoughts look that that's you know the the the your mind is the womb of the spirit why do you think many times we manifest uh uh things when sin is conceived what happens when you start to to entertain the things of the world and you start to look at the things of the world and the internet and and all the all that i don't want to go down that route but you know all the entertainment and the and the social platforms and the tech talks and the the instagrams and all those things look if if you're constantly feeding on those things then it's going to produce fruits because those things are constantly sowing seeds and then you wonder why you get into a test or into a trial and you fail to overcome it it's because you haven't been feeding on the word which is your strength and you find out why have i found my place in a weakness where all of a sudden you're scrolling on the internet or you're doing something and you find that your fingers are faster than your mind and you're like why did i even click on that and now you feel defiled and you're wondering why in the world did i give in to that and you're feeling defeated well all you have to do is plead the blood of jesus christ and say satan you got me there i give you that one but i ain't gonna let it happen again i'm going to plead the blood of jesus christ and if he set a trap for me are you fooled me that time but i'm going to gird up the loids of my mind now i'm going to refrain from going into those traps of the devil i'm going to start reading my bible i'm going to start staying away from the things of the world because if i'm feeding on the word of god and planting the seeds of the word into my mind i know that as it's watered it will drop down into my heart and i will produce a perfect faith in me to produce the word no longer producing the things of the world no longer producing the lust of the flesh but now you're producing the fruits of the spirit in your life because you're feeding on the word and faith comes by hearing that word and now that that word has found fertile ground it can spring forth the newness of life and produce none other than jesus christ and flesh again oh hallelujah oh that our decisions he would be pleased with our decisions hallelujah stand still son oh real genuine faith catches that that puts you back in the word oh hallelujah i want to read this quote here we this was our uh just really the crux of our inspiration he says speaking of jesus paragraph 64 perfect faith he said he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and they was in him and he gave he and that give him faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was all right we we all we all can accept that now let god speak to you therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer now look at our text here he says here in our text he says uh who is he speaking to when he says if you say to this mountain this ain't a blanket statement for all christianity and just whosoever will like you think no god is speaking to a special class of people he is speaking to an elect lady he's speaking to the bride of jesus christ he's speaking to a group that in the face of all adversity in the face of all uh all trial and tribulation that will stand upon the promised word no matter what comes their way and they'll say what the word says oh well you know you you you you stood up and you testified that that you were healed and you're having the same symptoms that you said you were delivered from oh he starts to war against your mind oh you got back from camp and you testified and look how many times that you've fallen since you've gotten back from camp well okay maybe he's right he's the one that set the trap that's what hunters do they go out and set a trap and you know what they do they go check it the devil got all these traps set up everywhere you can turn and look in school work internet your complexes your personality at church in the parking lot in the parking spot you gotta break you gotta park down at the baptist church and i just can't believe this there's traps that are set up in your mind and trust me the devil's going around and checking his traps to see if you fell into one of them because he wants to become a snare to you and he wants to keep you from making it into the house of god he wants to keep you from coming into the what the word spoke that you were because you're more than a conqueror in jesus christ you are an overcomer i want to ask you what are you overcoming you're overcoming satan's eden you're overcoming every single trap you're overcoming every single trip to a trick you're overcoming every single demon all those demons that were loosed at the river euphrates have now directed their their guns toward the bride of jesus christ and that's what you are overcoming but i want to tell it it's not you in your own self that's overcoming it it's christ that is in you and the devil is trying to set snares and traps to keep you from coming into the potential that god has spoke you to be because once you do that you will be a mighty invincible army you'll draw that sword and say where is that devil i'm going after my brother i'm going after my sister where is the sick let me lay hands on them they shall recover i'm going to use the power that god has placed to me that holy ghost power which is none other than the life of jesus christ and i'm going to battle where is my lost sons where is my lost daughters where is the prodigals oh glory to god i'm telling you what i feel like fighting a fight i i feel like drawing my sword i feel like doing battle who's with me who's on the lower side who wants to go get our prodigals who wants to go get the sons and the daughters of believing moms and dads in this building and say devil you can't have them i'm going after them i'm gonna get on my knees i'm gonna get into prayer i'm gonna get on the airplane i'm gonna do whatever i can do why because just like my father abraham he beat his brushes and plows and his hearts and he went after him why because he knew who he was oh hallelujah who's on the lord's side who's ready to do battle who's ready to take the power that god has placed in you and use that power for others oh yeah i know some of us are shrinking back because we're having a hard time living a victorious life in our own self that's why many of us ain't going after others it's okay don't be condemned those i love i rebuke i chase them i'm letting you know that there's higher heights for you there's deeper depths for you there's a real true overcoming life where the world doesn't have the pull on you like you think it always should just because brother branham said you know a lot you know this sticky nature i think one place maybe it said fish hooks in your elbows or something like that oh we we we want to use so many times it's so convenient for us to use quotes and things in the word to justify our sinful condition let's look at the other side be there for perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect why did he say that because that perfection is in you it just needs the trials it just needs the adversity to produce the character that's hidden in the seed but you would never know that character or that life that was in the seed unless you die out to yourself don't you realize a seed has to rot unless a seed goes into the ground and rot it abideth alone but you got to die out to yourself that the life that is in the seed can spring forth and what does it do when that seed comes to full maturity what does it do it comes back to seed again oh glory to god we're in the seed time we're in the bride time look you're an overcomer i want to tell you if you're falling down just get back up just repent it's for you that's why he died it's for you this message is for you you are an overcomer i don't care if i fall one trillion times i'm gonna get up one trillion and one times why because it's not me that's getting up it's christ in me that's getting up oh if it was left to my own abilities if it was left in my own life i'd have been died and gone a long time ago i would have fallen in the ditch and i would have never got it out oh but god rich in mercy he was looking out for me he saw me they said oh my son come out of there i love you i died for you i paid the price for you you don't have to stay down there anymore you don't have to do pentax you don't have to do woe as me and and beat yourself up i know son that's okay i died for you i paid the price for you it's all settled it's all finished what about the prodigal son he was there in the the pig pen he was wrestling with over a corn husk with another pig and all of a sudden he came to myself he said look the servants in my father's house live better than i do and what did he come back i say just come back oh come with a repent of heart come to the altar repent in your seat right there and you think you're going to have to do all these penta and everything no you'll say oh my son my daughter that was lost come home he'll put a robe he'll slay a fatted calf why because that which was lost has come home i want to tell you there's such love of god in this message there's such a love to be shed abroad towards you why don't you just receive the word why don't you just receive what god has for you why don't you receive what god has spoken of you that you are an overcomer revelations 3 21 would say to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me and my throne even as i also overcame and has set down with my father in his throne look this isn't guesswork you think god said to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me and my throne i'm wondering who that's going to be i mean you know i'm going to throw out this test i'm going to have this great adversary and we can just see who makes it through the gauntlet and all of a sudden somebody's gonna pop out on the other side like oh well how many how many how how many are gonna make it no that's not how it works you think he's wondering what you're gonna turn out to be you think he's wondering if you're gonna make it no look the spoken word is the original seed the earth god in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth what was in the earth there was spoken word seeds laying in the earth and all they were waiting for was light but there was darkness and confusion that was covering the earth and it wasn't until god said let there be light and the darkness and confusion rolled away and when that light started to hit that ground and that dirt around that seed something was quickened and that seed came to life now god's not in the end time just wondering when he revealed the seven seals and said it shall be light in the evening time when god said let there be light in ladies come on now there was gross darkness upon the people gross darkness upon the earth there was such darkness and chaos but god said let there be light it shall be light in the evening time let there be light and when the light started to shine and god loosed the seven seals and he revealed the son of man and the mighty god was unveiled before us and the light started to shine down in the age it struck the predestinated seed that he had planted the very spoken word that is the original seed that god spoke to be here in ladies that is sitting right here in this tabernacle in bedford texas that has received the light of the word in the end time he knows exactly what you're going to produce oh i get excited about it hallelujah oh glory to god to him that overcometh you know when you have reservations at a restaurant or maybe you buy your airplane tickets or maybe you've pre-paid for an automobile you went up there and you paid the the price on it and it's yours and they say look i'm just gonna i'm just gonna buff it and i'm just gonna detail it look here's the title here's the keys it's sitting right here in the parking lot come back up in an hour and you can pick it up you don't have to when you get home and you tell the families hey i just bought a new car here's the keys here here is here here's the title to it and i want to tell you do you want to go for a ride with me well come on down i know exactly where it's sitting they're just putting the final touches on it you don't have to be driving down the road and and your friend's going are you serious you you really got a lamborghini parked up there at the lot you don't have to be like well you know what i don't know now that i think about it i mean i do have the title and i do have the keys but no you know you know that you paid the price you know that you made the reservations you know that it's going to be there look when god said to him that overcometh i will grant to sit with me in my throne don't you realize there's a name tag on that seat don't you realize there's a seat right there that if they were walking through glory they would be walking through them like oh no that seats for brother andrew that sees for sister haley that sees for brother peter that's the oh don't you realize that it's all numbered and there's not gonna be one that doesn't make it every single one everyone's name that was written on the lamb's book of life christ jesus died for you he paid the price for you and he's made a reservation you don't have to wonder if it's going to be there to him that overcometh that's you you are an overcomer your place is reserved in glory oh glory to god there's the power of the blood the purchasing power of the blood of jesus christ that's here tonight what do you have nida your seat has its name on it how can i overcome well by god's grace we're speaking to somebody so we'll just continue lord let my son set on one side and my other son set on the other there's a mother's desire for her son but watch that place jesus said was predestinated this position was not in existence at the time why notice it will be granted to them who it was meant for what the one to set on the right hand and the other closest to him was yet an overcomer see it was still it was still and i i don't don't grant i can't grant this but it was given after the trial comes think of this now it's given after the trial comes amen see i can't give this buddy but after the trial comes they said on the side uh right hand and on the left there's a predestinated seed waiting out yonder for that it will be given to the ones that it's promised to it'll be given there but the test hasn't come yet there hasn't been an overcomer yet you see so here you are you're now living in the hour of the test and trial because you're the overcomer that that seat was reserved for and now the trial has come and as you're going through the trial look don't be discouraged just realize that this trial that you're going through is because you are an overcomer and there is a seat reserved for you in glory and just to make sure you don't fall short it's not you that's overcoming the trial it's christ in you that's overcoming the trial so you're guaranteed not to miss it oh that just makes me want to shout that makes me want to get excited because where i've fallen and where i fail to make god to meet god at his word god has always made up the difference for me he's always been there with loving arms to to to take me back oh to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome that's what the test and trial is for i i want to tell you that the prophet of god speaks of these things that you are predestinated to meet the challenge there's a good chance oh just for a little drama there when job would say oh the lord speaking where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy oh is it possible there was a group of people as they saw the plan of god and say you know there's going to be a time and at the very end it's going to be the most wicked and the most darkest and matter of fact my prophet will even make the statement i can't even see past 77 it's going to be such gross darkness such evil on the earth but i need somebody to go down and stand in the evil day with a boldness and declare the word of god is there somebody that is willing to go and manifest my heart's desire and i believe there was a group of people maybe that were over on the other side lord i'll go but do you really know what you're signing up for there's something called spiritual amnesia i'm gonna let you bypass your theophany you're gonna go down there when you show up on the other side down there you're not even gonna know where you came from you're not even gonna know where you're going but don't worry about it i'm going to put something inside of you i'm going to put a part of my own self called a predestinated seed that no matter what happens no matter what happens you'll find yourself all the way back here standing at my side again you won't have to worry about a thing in that case lord i'll take you out your word go ahead if that's your heart's desire lord send me on down there until ladies i will manifest your word and now that the trials and the testings are coming you are that overcomer that has a seat at the right hand of god oh hallelujah glory to god oh hallelujah you're predestinated to meet the challenge of the age what is going to stop you from manifesting the word what's going to stop you is there anything going to stop you when david was anointed to be king what was going to stop david from being king over israel was it going to be a lion was it going to be a bear was it going to be a goliath what was going to stop david from manifesting the spoken word of the prophet nothing now i was just reading the scripture today and we we referred to it many times romans 8 35 and we we've referred to it a lot of times to say what shall separate and you know this is very simple but i need simple because i'm a simple thinker it says but really when you read it says who shall separate us from the love of christ now you know i wanted to dive in there and maybe see if i could get some some some greek out of this word who and and maybe i would get some something that something more deep about it but that word who is used as what so uh the the translations uh right it says what or who but it just struck me when it says who shall separate us from the love of christ it struck me that of who is somebody and i started to think about that no it no matter whoever the who is and that who includes you it might sound simple but i started getting excited who shall separate us from the love of god oh that who is you too you can't even do anything to mess this up your own self can't mess this up all your faults and all your failures and all your missteps look you can't miss it yourself you can't even mess god's program up you might have to go through some heartache you reap what you sow you might find yourself on on a hospital bed crying out to god and saying god lord forgive me god might have to take you home early god forbid that but we have a reassurance as the scripture says who shall separate us from the love of christ is tribulation going to do it distress persecution famine nakedness peril sword he says for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things that come no height no depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in jesus christ our lord oh glory to god no nothing no complexes no depression no drug addiction come on now some of us are battling some really serious things and we're allowing it to condemn us in our mind because we think i'm a believer i shouldn't have to be battling this why am i going through depression why am i going through condemnation why am i battling this lust spirit why is this thing after me and it seems i get prayed for it and i have victory for three or four or five months and all of a sudden i find myself being drawn back and it just seems like this feeling or this anointing comes over me and i can't even control my own actions look don't you realize that nothing shall separate you from the love of god god will constantly woo upon your heart and call upon your heart and call you to repentance till you come to that place of the baptism of the holy ghost and you are set free from those things and you are delivered look no matter what in all these things you are more than conquerors through jesus christ and i that that's what god might all my heart is to have faith in what you are you're not the failures that's not who you are oh i want to just move a little bit faster first john 5 4 says for what whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith you have been born from god you came from god you can no more die like david there david was anointed and spoken to be the the king of israel that bear didn't have a chance that lion didn't have a chance goliath didn't have a chance that depression don't have a chance hallelujah that prodigal son oh they ain't going to stay gone that much longer that prodigal daughter ain't going to strongly stay gone that much longer why because there is a promise to the bride of jesus christ that has faith in who she is that will manifest the word that was spoken of her nothing can stop that now the prophet of god would go on to say this jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word i think we ought to read that again and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if ye abide in me and my words in you my words which this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you've said then you shall have what you said don't doubt the identity crisis look i want to tell you don't doubt it that identity crisis should be over the confusion should be over the struggle should be over you keep struggling and wondering if you are the bride you keep struggling and wondering if the message is for you look you need to get past all of those things get past the struggle let's go into battle now let's be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and i'll draw our swords and go to battle let's start winning victories let's broaden our borders look let's get our let's get our minds and our lives sanctified in our home life and our jobs let's get it all buttoned up church let's quit messing around let's quit flirting with the things of the world and entertaining things of the world let's get down to business let's get our knees let's get in prayer let's invite the holy ghost into our homes and into our bedrooms and into the places where you go and do the secret things in the world why don't you reconsecrate your life and say lord this used to be a place that i i may be snuck off and i did this or that but now i'm coming to to claim this space for you lord i'm going to sanctify my heart i'm going to sanctify my life i'm going to sanctify my car i'm going to sanctify my phone i'm going to sanctify the radio i'm going to sanctify my ears i'm going to sanctify my tongue i'm going to sanctify my eyes oh god by the baptism of the holy ghost sanctify my life lord that i can be a vessel that's so cleaned out and so filled with the holy ghost and fire that i'll be like apostolic times i'll start busting out of the upper room speaking in tongues laying hands on the sick and then recovering doing the greater works speaking the word and seeing these signs following believers oh that ain't too much to ask that's thus saith the lord i say oh god let it be this is a lengthy quote but it's worth reading this is brother branham preaches how can i overcome in the morning service to perfect faith he says see as i said in the beginning you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated well maybe you just got some answers that's why you're always struggling you're born that way that's what you signed up for you signed up for spiritual amnesia to show up defeated but that was god's perfect plan he wanted you to be here allowed you to show up defeated and you're in a defeated world amongst defeated people amongst defeated creeds defeated denominations you've got to come to victory some way oh i love this message i love it so much the prophet's not about to go to some mystic far out algebraic equation and trying to tie all of this with that and make some big pompous show and say oh if you could do all this well i love it so much she says you got to come to victory somewhere it's just like a lily oh thank you lord where is a lily i think it's one of the prettiest flowers that there is i'm very fond of those great cali lilies and pond lilies i think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big pawn lily call it a water lily how's it's radiance now where does it come from now if you realize what happens right here i just maybe i'll just throw that out there for somebody that doesn't know but the prophet's talking about you so so as we continue realize the prophet is talking about you he says now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy mucky pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then when it's in that mud but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something it's black it's dirty it's mucky it's slimy and that slime that it's living in yet it presses its way through the mud the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time i think that's an overcomer that once in sin once did the things that was wrong don't worry about it now now god's talking to somebody listen to the prophet he said don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then now why look back into the pond again see look you have god by his predestination has brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light and now on top of all that it has overcome see it doesn't express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither did you in your sin in adultery and everything you lived in you didn't express nothing oh hallelujah thank you oh thank you lord jesus you didn't express nothing when you were out there in sin but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into light and now you're in the presence of jesus christ with the sunlight it brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what i mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily look god has brought you out of the muck admirer he's brought you out of those things giving you victory look don't worry about what you did in the past don't look back to the pond again paul said in ephesians 4 22 he said that you put off concerning the formal conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind i'll just invite the musicians to come that might perk some people's interest he says in that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness as i've made a habit of i'm not done preaching yet but now listen to what the prophet says and he that is in you so we just read that look it's that predestinated seed coming to life you didn't express anything when you were out there in sin you didn't express anything when you're out there in the muck and mire he says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what is in you that's greater what is in you that is greater now we're believers right we have we we want to have faith in what god has made you greater is he that so so what is in you that's greater it's christ the anointed god that was in christ in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world then if he is in you it's not you any more living it's him living in you see it's not your thinking what you would think about this it's what he said about it then if he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said when brother branham preaches how can i overcome i i thought it's so profound so what what we're illuminating here is that god has done something in your life it's christ the anointed that is in you he is the one that is willing he is the one that has caused you to believe he is the one that has given you victory he is the one that's picked you back up he's the one that's wrought that marvelous victory in your life he's the one that delivered you at camp he's the one that spoke to your heart at church it's christ that is in you that predestinated seed when the word strikes that seed it brings it forth to life there's a life of christ now blooming forth in you it's christ in you the hope of glory greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and when brother branham starts to preach how can i overcome it it's a striking statement he goes i want to preach on how can i overcome uh this is my subject and the reason i want to preach that because we're living in an age where i think we should never let the spirit of revival die i thought my that's that's a striking statement that it seems maybe not even tied to his what his text and what he's going to say but he said this is my subject how can i overcome because i think it's an age that we should never let the spirit of revival die don't you realize that's why the devil's after you young people you had a revival a spirit of revival break out in your life at camp and the devil has been after you every time since trying to quench that spirit of revival that's in you why because the spirit of revival is the spirit of christ that's living inside of you and the devil is doing everything he can to quench the fire of god in you because we're living in an hour that we should never let the spirit of revival die oh i say oh god if god sent a vindicated prophet that said we're living an hour that we should never let the spirit of revival die then i say oh god let me do everything in my power to stay constantly revive and no no no i'm not talking about so just okay when camp's over where's the revival brother random tells the story about those clergymen they wanted to go see the west revival oh i'm gonna fly out and see what this big thing was and what cost where is this welsh river where is the bride's revival where is this louisiana camp revival where is this young people's camp i want to go see what it's about well go ahead and drive down to dry creek louisiana ain't nothing there the lights are shut off there ain't no lights on in the building if you go looking for the revival the revival wasn't in the building the revival wasn't a people and some of those people have come back to bedford texas and they're gathered together in the house of god that's where the spirit of revival is just like that man that cop was there he was twirling that really baton and they come up said oh sir i want to ask you a question where is the welsh revival he said you're looking at it you want to know where the pride revival is i'm looking at the prize revival the bride's revival has gathered together around the revealed word of the hour never let the spirit of revival die why because it's christ the anointed word of the hour taken on flesh in you oh let's all stand oh hallelujah oh my well please start playing something oh glory to god you know many times you might go experience a ball game or you go experience something as a spectator i don't want to be a spectator i want to be a participator it's it's fun watching sports [Music] it's it's fun going and being a spectator at times but i don't want to be a spectator i can't i ain't a streamer no way look i remember when i uh went to brother ron peterson's church and that they were facing the same exact problems we had what no way in the world i was gonna be in the back no way if it meant getting up three and i drove an hour and a half i know what i'm talking about i knew if i didn't get to church 45 minutes early i was gonna be sitting in the back well i wouldn't be sitting in the back i'd be sitting in the back of the church and i didn't want to sit in the back of the church i wanted to sit in the front of the church so i knew if i wanted to sit in the front of the church i better get there 45 minutes early and if i got there 30 minutes early and i was a little wait late because early is on time and on time is late and late is unacceptable where are these things coming from but that's all right that's how i was i just wasn't going to let it happen i just i just wanted to be there i wanted to be there on time so i realized look i had to leave early to get there on time there was something in me i just wanted to be in the house of god i wanted to be in his presence i wanted to be i wanted to be a participator i don't want to be a spectator i don't want to be all at home watching on the screen but praise god we have that ability if you can't be here then at least it's something but oh god i want a true experience i don't want to be a spectator watching god move in your life and god move in your life oh i'm thankful for it i'm glad that god's moving into your lives but i see oh god moving my life i want to be a participator pour your holy ghost out upon me that i can have faith in what you've made me oh i gotta read this it's just too good glory to god [Music] we have some preaching to do yet is that all right hey i've been standing for about an hour you could all right hallelujah look so so we want to let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus right the prophet of god would say this look it god so look like when you go and pray for somebody you apologize say oh mr devil would you please move over here and let me faith has muscles and hair on his chest when it speaks everything else shuts up don't go in and say oh mr devil you move out get out of here no i'm a son of god i'm commissioned of god leave them alone that moves you don't have to apologize to the devil nothing to do with them not ashamed of the word of god not ashamed of your commission not ashamed of who we are oh hallelujah you don't have to be ashamed of you are and you don't have to be ashamed of this gospel for this gospel is the power of salvation to him that believeth oh glory to his wonderful name let's just sing this well greater is he that is in me oh greater is he that is in me oh greater is he that is in me than he that is in
