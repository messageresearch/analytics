[5:06] she'd like to hear him again and she'd
[5:08] like for me to
[5:10] have him again so
[5:13] i thought that was good now not that she

[8:18] and of course all of you that
[8:20] homeschooled i know you graduated at the
[8:22] top of your class
[8:24] and i think that's wonderful but uh
[8:27] lord richly bless you this is kind of a
[8:30] graduation
[8:31] weekend across the country but um
[8:36] this was the weekend that we could get
[8:38] brother john so we took it i know
[8:40] there's other people that are
[8:42] graduating in the marriage across the
[8:45] country this weekend too so
[8:47] we certainly congratulate them
[8:50] before we start service i'd just like to
[8:53] say
[8:54] a few things to our young people here
[8:57] that we have this meeting for our young
[9:00] people
[9:01] plus inviting their friends
[9:04] and fellowship around the word of the
[9:07] lord
[9:08] but we we spoke a scripture
[9:12] out of mark which we refer to
[9:16] as the great commission and brother
[9:19] branham said these
[9:20] words in a message called the
[9:23] influence of another he says what the
[9:26] church needs tonight
[9:28] is first to be reverent
[9:32] next thing to be humble
[9:36] then get yourself in
[9:39] action yes sir
[9:43] and you know no army
[9:47] ever will be able to sustain itself
[9:51] without new recruits
[9:54] the very law of attrition
[9:58] and the very
[9:59] [Music]
[10:02] effects of battle will cause
[10:05] an army to deplete itself and
[10:09] to diminish just
[10:12] by time itself and if there isn't
[10:15] new recruits
[10:19] or new people entering the battle
[10:23] their numbers cease and
[10:26] we have a day that the enemy is
[10:30] growing larger and larger
[10:33] by the day he's come to the place where
[10:38] he's now taking over the conversation
[10:41] of the country politically educationally
[10:45] and everything and if there's ever an
[10:48] hour that we need people to join
[10:50] in the commission and that's what i
[10:54] wanted
[10:55] for our young people here
[10:58] that this weekend would put a burden on
[11:02] your heart
[11:03] to take up the commission we need people
[11:06] that
[11:07] pray for the sick we need people
[11:10] that go into all the world
[11:13] and witness this gospel
[11:17] the enemy has moving down in its rank
[11:22] for to younger and younger and younger
[11:25] ages he's attacking and
[11:29] there's no way now that we can cover
[11:33] all the ground that needs to be covered
[11:36] the harvest is great but the laborers
[11:41] are few and after this
[11:44] weekend i hope especially the people
[11:48] that are fellowshipping here and
[11:52] laboring in this part of the country
[11:55] and our young people that you'll feel a
[11:58] burden on your heart
[12:00] to go into all the world to go into your
[12:04] world
[12:05] the people that you come and contact the
[12:07] people that you know
[12:09] and so let your light shine amongst men
[12:12] that your good works might glorify
[12:16] that your father in heaven so i hope to
[12:19] the young people here the
[12:21] the ones that labor here i hope that
[12:24] this weekend
[12:25] stirs your heart to get into action
[12:29] and that you will take up your cross
[12:32] that you'll follow him
[12:34] and that you'll become ministers
[12:37] of this gospel to your friends to your
[12:40] loved ones to your homes
[12:42] to all your workplaces and everybody
[12:46] that
[12:46] you come in to contact with so let's
[12:50] just stand together as we say a word of
[12:52] prayer and
[12:53] turn the service over to brother billy
[12:56] but
[12:57] i hope that this service tonight
[13:00] will set your hearts on flame to be
[13:04] a great warrior for it they
[13:08] once again they have some sandwiches
[13:13] planned for you for after service and
[13:16] so we'd like to say that first of all
[13:19] we'd like
[13:20] all our guests and young people first
[13:24] our guests in our chaperones and our
[13:26] visitors
[13:27] to be the first to eat and then after
[13:30] that
[13:31] what's ever left over is for the local
[13:34] people
[13:35] because they can always go home i don't
[13:37] mean local like
[13:39] like like a local cabeza you know i mean
[13:43] like
[13:44] the local people who most of them are
[13:47] local
[13:48] but we love that so you want to just
[13:50] let's just approach the lord
[13:52] and we ask god in your heart to remember
[13:55] you

[14:00] flame in your heart

[1:03:29] streaming tonight and we heard right
[1:03:31] after the service
[1:03:33] from africa and new zealand and there's
[1:03:35] a lot of people that are streaming these
[1:03:37] meetings there's a lot of hunger
[1:03:40] globally for what god's doing and i
[1:03:43] found out there's young people and
[1:03:44] believers all over the world
[1:03:46] they they can't gather together like
[1:03:48] this some of them are locked down they
[1:03:50] don't have
[1:03:51] the opportunity and they just want to be
[1:03:53] with you
[1:03:55] and i think that's wonderful we can't
[1:03:57] see them
[1:03:58] but they can see you so just i want
[1:04:02] every person
[1:04:03] to understand that there's needs in this
[1:04:05] building
[1:04:06] but there's also needs around the world
[1:04:09] and god could lay it on somebody's heart
[1:04:11] just to be tapped in tonight
[1:04:13] and can we include them and just say god
[1:04:17] minister to them
[1:04:18] talk to them along the road may our
[1:04:20] hearts burn within us
[1:04:23] youth with passion and youth on fire
[1:04:27] acts chapter 1 is the acts of the holy
[1:04:29] spirit
[1:04:30] and what he was working in verse 1 it
[1:04:32] was the apostle
[1:04:34] luke that wrote this
[1:04:37] he was a physician acts 1 1 did i say
[1:04:40] something else
[1:04:43] did i say another chapter okay
[1:04:46] acts 1 1 this was luke that wrote this
[1:04:50] that's why he said the former treatise
[1:04:52] have i made o theophilus theophilus was
[1:04:55] thought to be a roman man he was writing
[1:04:58] of all that jesus began both to do and
[1:05:01] teach
[1:05:01] until the day in which he was taken up
[1:05:05] after that he threw the holy ghost
[1:05:09] had given commandments unto the apostles
[1:05:12] whom he had chosen
[1:05:16] to whom to the apostles
[1:05:19] also he showed himself alive after his
[1:05:22] passion
[1:05:24] by many infallible proofs being seen of
[1:05:27] them
[1:05:27] forty days and speaking of the things
[1:05:32] pertaining to the kingdom of god
[1:05:35] now i believe the lord had this weekend
[1:05:37] pre-planned
[1:05:39] and uh yet last night yesterday happened
[1:05:42] to be the 40th day
[1:05:45] from easter till last night this is
[1:05:48] saturday
[1:05:50] so if we would go back 2 000 years ago
[1:05:53] we're all in the upper room
[1:05:55] let's call ourselves upper room youth
[1:05:58] tonight
[1:05:59] can we do that you know the superstar
[1:06:03] ascended up into heaven
[1:06:05] on the 40th day and here here we all are
[1:06:08] is
[1:06:08] us but he promised he'd come back
[1:06:13] so here we're the upper room youth
[1:06:17] and on verse 3 it talks about
[1:06:20] his passion now tonight this is going to
[1:06:24] be something you've
[1:06:25] just i'm going to turn it for you and
[1:06:27] it's going to be a different kind of
[1:06:28] passion
[1:06:29] maybe you you know maybe you've never
[1:06:32] heard it like this before but
[1:06:34] jesus went through his passion the time
[1:06:36] of that week
[1:06:37] and when we speak about youth with
[1:06:39] passion it's different than maybe what
[1:06:41] might be in your mind right now so hold
[1:06:43] this
[1:06:44] in your thought verse 4 and being
[1:06:46] assembled together with them
[1:06:48] commanded them that they should not
[1:06:50] depart from jerusalem
[1:06:52] but wait let's all say wait
[1:06:55] for the promise of the father which
[1:06:58] saith he
[1:06:59] ye have heard of me for john
[1:07:03] john the baptist truly baptized with
[1:07:05] water
[1:07:06] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[1:07:09] ghost
[1:07:10] not many days hence
[1:07:13] they therefore were come together they
[1:07:15] asked of him saying lord will thou at
[1:07:17] this time
[1:07:18] restore again the kingdom to israel and
[1:07:21] he said unto them it is not for you
[1:07:23] to know the times or the seasons whom
[1:07:26] the father hath put in his own power
[1:07:29] his own power but ye
[1:07:33] shall receive power now
[1:07:36] this is a young people's weekend
[1:07:39] and so i'm focusing our attention and
[1:07:42] our focus on you
[1:07:45] not one amen hallelujah
[1:07:49] so i know there's older ones and there's
[1:07:51] helpers and
[1:07:53] there's different ones that have made it
[1:07:55] possible
[1:07:56] and are we thankful for that pastor
[1:07:59] david mcgarry sister leslie the assembly
[1:08:01] and the workers
[1:08:02] some are right behind me tonight brother
[1:08:04] trevor spoke
[1:08:06] but this is for the young people
[1:08:10] ye shall receive dynamics
[1:08:14] the dynamo after that the holy ghost
[1:08:17] is come upon you and ye shall be
[1:08:20] witnesses unto me
[1:08:22] both in jerusalem and in all judea and
[1:08:25] in samaria
[1:08:26] and in dallas and in new york
[1:08:30] in phoenix arizona hallelujah
[1:08:33] and in africa and china and india and
[1:08:36] under the uttermost part of the earth is
[1:08:38] that okay
[1:08:39] hope i'm not adding to the word but when
[1:08:41] he had spoken
[1:08:43] these things while they beheld he was
[1:08:45] taken up
[1:08:47] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:08:49] sight my who would have liked to have
[1:08:51] been
[1:08:52] there and while they looked steadfastly
[1:08:55] toward heaven as he went up behold
[1:08:59] two men stood by them in white apparel
[1:09:01] we're all looking up in the sky saying
[1:09:03] where's jesus we need jesus we where are
[1:09:06] you going
[1:09:09] and these angels said unto him ye men of
[1:09:12] galilee why stand you gazing up into
[1:09:14] heaven
[1:09:15] this same jesus which is taken up from
[1:09:19] you into heaven
[1:09:20] shall so come in like manner as ye have
[1:09:23] seen him go
[1:09:25] into heaven so what did these believers
[1:09:28] do
[1:09:28] after jesus said go and wait and tarry
[1:09:32] verse 12 they went into jerusalem and
[1:09:35] they waited on the lord for how many
[1:09:37] days does anybody know
[1:09:40] bible trivia he went up 40 days
[1:09:43] how many days did they wait in the upper
[1:09:45] room 10 days
[1:09:48] hallelujah they waited and they tarried
[1:09:50] god bless you you can have your seats
[1:09:53] tonight there's no need to wait
[1:09:56] there's no need to tarry the tearing
[1:10:00] days are over
[1:10:06] so let's be upper room youth that can
[1:10:09] recognize this is our day this is our
[1:10:12] hour
[1:10:13] i shared my title with a pastor in
[1:10:16] europe
[1:10:17] this afternoon and he said we pray that
[1:10:20] it would be more than a sermon
[1:10:22] that the lord would make this a reality
[1:10:25] and we're in this room here tonight in
[1:10:27] bedford
[1:10:28] dallas fort worth texas but i pray the
[1:10:30] holy ghost would come and fill all of us
[1:10:33] hallelujah we're living in another book
[1:10:35] of acts
[1:10:37] you are youth with passion and your
[1:10:40] youth on fire
[1:10:42] say well i don't feel it i don't see it
[1:10:45] i don't know about it but you just let a
[1:10:47] good fire take place
[1:10:49] you get around somebody that's on fire
[1:10:52] just get it close to him you're right
[1:10:56] where you need to be
[1:10:58] tonight might you might not even know
[1:11:00] what's happening to you
[1:11:02] you might not even be in the spirit
[1:11:06] but you're in the right place for that
[1:11:08] fire just to consume you
[1:11:10] and you don't even know what's happening
[1:11:13] the bible says while they yet heard the
[1:11:15] word
[1:11:16] they were filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:19] there's other times in the book of acts
[1:11:20] they laid hands on them
[1:11:22] and they were filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:24] it doesn't matter
[1:11:25] how you receive the holy ghost but i
[1:11:28] want to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:30] i believe you can be healed sitting
[1:11:32] right in your seat
[1:11:34] i believe demon spirits can be cast out
[1:11:36] of you while you hear the word
[1:11:39] there's some people that talk bad about
[1:11:41] young people's meetings and gatherings
[1:11:44] let me just share with you what a
[1:11:46] prophet said
[1:11:47] is that okay last night we spoke on lord
[1:11:51] remember me
[1:11:52] he said this in phoenix in remembering
[1:11:54] the lord
[1:11:56] he said he had just heard a young man
[1:11:58] preach there
[1:11:59] in uh the phoenix meetings and he said
[1:12:02] that certain
[1:12:02] young man got up and was talking about
[1:12:04] the young people's rally
[1:12:06] see back in the 60s they called them
[1:12:08] rallies
[1:12:09] youth rallies we have young people's
[1:12:12] meetings or
[1:12:12] meetings for the youth and brother
[1:12:14] branham said the young man was talking
[1:12:16] about the young people's rally
[1:12:17] and i told my daughter now brother
[1:12:20] branham was a father
[1:12:22] and he had uh children and one of them
[1:12:25] was rebecca
[1:12:26] she was a teenager and she was in the
[1:12:28] meetings and brother branham told his
[1:12:30] daughter said now you want to make it
[1:12:32] your business
[1:12:33] to get in there he's talking about the
[1:12:36] youth rally the youth meetings
[1:12:38] make it your business so don't be down
[1:12:41] at the mall
[1:12:41] don't be you know at starbucks don't
[1:12:44] make it a social media night
[1:12:46] i'm kinda sick well now make it your
[1:12:48] business
[1:12:50] to be in the youth meeting but she said
[1:12:52] maybe what we've all felt things like
[1:12:55] i don't know nobody in there you know
[1:12:58] it's kind of a
[1:12:59] strange place it's a different church
[1:13:01] and different things you know
[1:13:03] i don't know nobody in there i said
[1:13:05] you'll know somebody
[1:13:07] or somebody will know you just go on in
[1:13:11] anyhow say well nobody knows me
[1:13:14] but somebody might know you well the
[1:13:17] lord knows you
[1:13:18] just go on in there then he said this he
[1:13:22] said i'm praying that she receives the
[1:13:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:26] during this rally up there so brother
[1:13:29] branham supported youth meetings
[1:13:31] he loved youth meetings and then is that
[1:13:34] that was early in 63
[1:13:37] before um february
[1:13:40] and then march you remember the sword
[1:13:43] came down in brother branham's hand
[1:13:44] there was a great blast in the mountain
[1:13:46] how many remember that my brother daniel
[1:13:49] andes is in tucson and he was just there
[1:13:51] today
[1:13:52] i got photos of him there on pulpit rock
[1:13:55] there
[1:13:55] where the sword came down and so just a
[1:13:58] few months
[1:13:59] after that in june uh rebecca
[1:14:02] and one of her friends i think her name
[1:14:04] was marilyn was graduating
[1:14:06] and so they had brother branham come and
[1:14:08] speak like to some young people
[1:14:11] and uh this is an amazing quote because
[1:14:14] it really ties back
[1:14:15] to to tonight brother branham is praying
[1:14:19] on june the 1st
[1:14:20] 1963 and he said lord jesus we are
[1:14:23] grateful for this time
[1:14:25] and and we're grateful we know that
[1:14:27] we're assembled here the young
[1:14:29] and the old and the middle aged and we
[1:14:32] have assembled this side of eternity
[1:14:34] once more to speak about
[1:14:35] you and about the things that pertains
[1:14:38] to everlasting life
[1:14:40] and these young ones sitting in here

[1:14:45] some have already graduated but i
[1:14:48] realize
[1:14:49] lord he's praying i realize lord
[1:14:52] something that happened just a few
[1:14:54] hours before that great shock or that
[1:14:57] great blast
[1:14:58] had taken place in the mountain north of
[1:15:01] tucson
[1:15:02] when the angels of the lord came down i
[1:15:05] remember what was said
[1:15:06] and especially about the young people
[1:15:11] incredible we talk about the seals
[1:15:15] the third pool the mysteries of god and
[1:15:18] brother branham is talking to young

[1:15:56] so stay with us tonight a prophet is
[1:15:59] remembering
[1:16:00] what happened in the mountain and what
[1:16:02] was said about young people
[1:16:04] i'd like to know what was said about
[1:16:05] young people
[1:16:07] i'd like to know what god has for for
[1:16:09] this generation
[1:16:12] so tonight let's just go right away in
[1:16:15] acts chapter one here back to verse
[1:16:18] three
[1:16:20] this service tonight is just for you
[1:16:24] but i want to come from another a
[1:16:26] perspective
[1:16:28] and that is verse 3 when jesus was
[1:16:30] showing himself alive to
[1:16:32] his disciples acts one verse three
[1:16:36] he showed himself alive after his
[1:16:38] passion
[1:16:40] by many infallible proofs being seen of
[1:16:42] them forty days
[1:16:45] jesus had walked through a week of
[1:16:47] passion
[1:16:49] the greatest week of all the year and
[1:16:52] that was easter is coming
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:56] you know when we talk about passion
[1:16:58] youth with passion
[1:16:59] and youth on fire sometimes the word
[1:17:02] passion it would come into your mind
[1:17:05] and especially today it's thought of so
[1:17:07] many different things your mind could be
[1:17:09] going in a lot of
[1:17:10] directions about fire and about passion
[1:17:14] passion has to do a strong desire
[1:17:17] and it has to do with fire that has
[1:17:20] strong urges i'm speaking to adults
[1:17:24] tonight
[1:17:25] young adults and young people youth with
[1:17:28] passion that means
[1:17:30] they are fervent they are ardent they
[1:17:33] are
[1:17:34] zealous when we speak about youth with
[1:17:37] passion
[1:17:38] you're you're obsessive and you're not
[1:17:42] normal
[1:17:43] anybody wanna anybody wanna join the
[1:17:45] club amen
[1:17:47] they were gathered in one mine and one
[1:17:48] accord we can't be looking around
[1:17:51] talking about each other's sandals and
[1:17:53] our hair
[1:17:56] amen oh lord it's in the fire
[1:18:00] just now upon all of us just
[1:18:04] y'all are sitting really nice you know
[1:18:06] really comfortable but if the fire alarm
[1:18:08] would go off here
[1:18:10] fire we would get your attention that
[1:18:13] would arouse you
[1:18:14] but we're talking about when a person
[1:18:16] has passion
[1:18:18] that they are obsessive they have
[1:18:21] spiritual
[1:18:22] desire and a hunger spiritual thirst and
[1:18:25] an
[1:18:25] appetite and a craving for more of god
[1:18:29] not just for more meaning they don't
[1:18:32] have it
[1:18:32] they want more of what they got when we
[1:18:35] read the book of acts and we hear what a
[1:18:37] prophet said about
[1:18:39] this end time that my i have so many
[1:18:42] things in front of me we won't even have
[1:18:43] time to share but
[1:18:44] there are promises that lay in the word
[1:18:47] for the end time
[1:18:48] and there will be people alive and
[1:18:50] remain to the coming of the lord
[1:18:53] and i don't believe they're going to be
[1:18:54] backslidden and half in the world
[1:18:57] there's going to be some youth that have
[1:18:59] some passion
[1:19:02] they're on fire
[1:19:05] do we all believe that tonight so
[1:19:07] passion tonight is not for sinful
[1:19:10] worldly things i'm moving some of your
[1:19:12] thoughts away from
[1:19:13] from that that thing that would be
[1:19:15] sinful or worldly but
[1:19:17] passion for christ passion for god
[1:19:22] fire of the holy ghost put that in me
[1:19:25] lord
[1:19:26] put something in me it's kind of like a
[1:19:29] person that
[1:19:30] has drink uh drunk a lot all right
[1:19:33] and they're they're totally uh drunk
[1:19:36] they're sauced
[1:19:39] and you talk about them you tell jokes
[1:19:41] about them and they're just falling on
[1:19:42] the ground and
[1:19:43] they're buying everybody drinks and they
[1:19:45] just want to share and they're happy
[1:19:47] you know and they they they just you
[1:19:49] know go out
[1:19:50] they just go out and you kick them you
[1:19:52] kick them no response i mean they're
[1:19:54] totally
[1:19:55] under the influence that's what i'm
[1:19:57] talking about
[1:19:58] youth with passion and youth on fire
[1:20:03] and i'm going to get into it just a
[1:20:04] little bit later but we are going to be
[1:20:06] passionate for christ in spite of our
[1:20:10] failures
[1:20:12] in spite of your past you will be
[1:20:16] passionate
[1:20:20] and if you're not tonight we're just
[1:20:22] gonna give you some time
[1:20:24] like jesus gave peter and thomas and all
[1:20:26] the disciples that ran
[1:20:28] in the garden they were cowards and the
[1:20:32] scripture we read tonight
[1:20:33] was a bunch of people in a room that
[1:20:35] were cowards they were afraid
[1:20:38] but you just give them a few days
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:45] now peter was cussing and swearing and
[1:20:47] saying i don't even know the man
[1:20:49] but you just give him a few days
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:53] thomas was saying well unless i put my
[1:20:55] hands in his side and unless i see his
[1:20:57] nail prints
[1:21:00] just give him a few days don't you worry
[1:21:03] sister
[1:21:04] don't you worry brother jesus is going
[1:21:07] to appear to you
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:10] hallelujah say well i'm not going to
[1:21:12] move you know
[1:21:13] i'm not gonna move i'm not gonna respond
[1:21:15] i'm not gonna
[1:21:16] you just let somebody put fire under
[1:21:18] that person
[1:21:24] but you put a willingness in a person to
[1:21:26] say lord whatever you say
[1:21:28] and whatever you do i want to move
[1:21:31] now that's god changing our attitude
[1:21:33] he's already changed some of your
[1:21:34] attitude
[1:21:35] in the last five minutes because i said
[1:21:37] passion and you already
[1:21:39] down some other trail somewhere that's
[1:21:41] just what the world has done to all of
[1:21:43] us
[1:21:46] brother branham said every generation is
[1:21:49] 10 times worse
[1:21:52] how many know he said that
[1:21:56] brother john had that on my uh wall of
[1:21:58] my office
[1:22:00] um so that i saw it every day
[1:22:03] that our children have it 10 times worse
[1:22:06] than we ever had
[1:22:08] so we have to have respect for one
[1:22:10] another and recognize that every
[1:22:12] generation has it 10 times worse
[1:22:15] and brother john was young before and
[1:22:18] we've had three children and now we have
[1:22:20] three grandchildren
[1:22:21] that if my children had it ten times
[1:22:24] worse my grandchildren gonna have it ten
[1:22:26] times worth that's a hundred times more
[1:22:29] so i have a lot of respect for you
[1:22:30] tonight i mean brother billy brother
[1:22:32] andrew brother steve brother
[1:22:34] matthew our our ministry and leaders
[1:22:37] here brother
[1:22:38] david and brother trevor and anyone that
[1:22:40] works with young people
[1:22:42] it should always be with whatever we got
[1:22:45] to do
[1:22:46] to reach their heart and i don't believe
[1:22:49] in beating the turtle
[1:22:52] i don't believe in beating the turtle
[1:22:54] with sticks and throwing it in the
[1:22:56] in the river to try to get him to move i
[1:22:58] believe a real fire of god
[1:23:00] will cause anybody to move but you know
[1:23:03] what's really up to us
[1:23:04] you older ones if you've been there and
[1:23:06] done that well let's show that by
[1:23:08] having some pull tonight and having some
[1:23:10] fire ourselves
[1:23:12] let's give the new generation young
[1:23:14] people something that they want what we
[1:23:16] got
[1:23:17] not be a dead church you want passion
[1:23:20] well
[1:23:21] it's got to take some things to get
[1:23:22] there
[1:23:24] hallelujah if you want to see the fire
[1:23:26] of god move and
[1:23:27] the breath of god and see people under
[1:23:30] the impact of the holy ghost that's not
[1:23:32] just always everybody doing what they
[1:23:34] want to do and then oh wow at the end
[1:23:35] it's just going to explode
[1:23:39] i want it to be real on monday tuesday
[1:23:43] next wednesday wherever you go and
[1:23:46] wherever you're going gonna be i'll be
[1:23:47] in another state
[1:23:48] preaching for somebody else but i want
[1:23:51] you to have something that you can
[1:23:53] have that's real
[1:23:56] do you want that
[1:24:00] so let's look in acts chapter 1. you can
[1:24:02] put that back up brother parks thank you
[1:24:04] for working with us tonight
[1:24:06] to whom also acts 1 verse 3 he showed
[1:24:09] himself alive after his passion
[1:24:12] the only time this word in the english
[1:24:14] is in the whole bible
[1:24:16] in the greek and hebrew it's also
[1:24:18] mentioned but
[1:24:20] this word passion has to do with his
[1:24:23] suffering
[1:24:25] he was afflicted he was vexed
[1:24:29] he felt the pain i'm going back to
[1:24:33] a week of of his passion
[1:24:36] that you know mel gibson made a big
[1:24:38] movie about in hollywood
[1:24:41] of the passion and that was just the
[1:24:44] inspiration that someone in the world
[1:24:46] that's not even a believer tapped into
[1:24:50] that even people in the world can cry
[1:24:52] and get all emotional about
[1:24:54] but if you and i are the bride of christ
[1:24:56] we've got to go deeper than that
[1:24:59] what did that passion do for mel gibson
[1:25:03] what did it do for hollywood i don't
[1:25:06] really care whether you saw the movie or
[1:25:07] not
[1:25:08] it doesn't matter we need to see the
[1:25:10] same lord jesus
[1:25:12] in our day he went through a time of
[1:25:15] passion
[1:25:17] so young people tonight being raised in
[1:25:20] a very soft soap
[1:25:22] easy age social media
[1:25:26] and a world that is just not even real
[1:25:29] it's fake
[1:25:30] trying to grab our hearts you're being
[1:25:32] introduced to another passion
[1:25:36] and that is jesus after his
[1:25:39] passion and after his suffering he was
[1:25:43] afflicted he was
[1:25:44] vexed he felt the pain he experienced it
[1:25:47] that week
[1:25:48] are we all together he underwent this
[1:25:51] episode
[1:25:52] for you in mind
[1:25:55] he was torn apart and blood and i could
[1:26:00] have started that way tonight
[1:26:01] the blood and the screaming
[1:26:05] and them ripping off his garment and
[1:26:09] now he's all his friends are gone
[1:26:13] and they put a crown of thorns on his
[1:26:15] head and they hit on the thorns that
[1:26:17] drove down into his brain
[1:26:20] they spit on him some of us can't even
[1:26:24] hardly take a text or an email we get
[1:26:26] all bent out of shape
[1:26:27] they spit on him they railed him
[1:26:32] they accused him of things if you're the
[1:26:34] christ all these things and now
[1:26:37] it's come down to them taking off his
[1:26:38] coat and now there's that man that was
[1:26:40] trained that roman
[1:26:44] to give him whips on his back it was for
[1:26:47] criminals
[1:26:48] does anybody know how many stripes he
[1:26:51] received for you
[1:26:53] 40 save one 39
[1:26:57] and they were trained they were trained
[1:26:59] to rip apart the flesh and
[1:27:01] go down to the bones and the roman that
[1:27:04] was trained like that
[1:27:05] had done it many times and as he's
[1:27:09] whipped on jesus and took that whip upon
[1:27:12] his back
[1:27:13] right up from the top of his head it
[1:27:15] would come down and just strip
[1:27:17] anybody have ever had back problems
[1:27:19] nerve problems
[1:27:21] sciatic nerve whatever it has no it's
[1:27:23] not even a touch to what jesus went
[1:27:25] through
[1:27:27] blood's going everywhere

[1:29:07] want to we just want it easy though
[1:29:09] brother john no passion
[1:29:11] is different than just some pleasure
[1:29:14] it's more than satisfying yourself or
[1:29:17] going to a party where you can
[1:29:19] satisfy somebody else or get satisfied
[1:29:22] i'm just going to go there bisexual
[1:29:25] things of this world

[1:29:33] garden it'll just tantalize you
[1:29:36] and play with your mind and torment your
[1:29:39] spirit
[1:29:40] i'm speaking about youth with passion
[1:29:42] and youth that are on fire for god
[1:29:46] they desire the word of god but it was
[1:29:48] sad
[1:29:49] when he was beaten when he was torn when
[1:29:51] he was bleeding
[1:29:52] and he bore your shame he bore your sin
[1:29:56] and he felt every single pain and
[1:29:59] suffering

[1:30:25] felt no virtue
[1:30:26] this was his job this is what he did for
[1:30:28] a living
[1:30:29] and when it got to 39 times he just you
[1:30:32] know washed his hands you know and
[1:30:34] went home to his wife and put his
[1:30:36] garment up there there was no power in
[1:30:38] him
[1:30:39] there was no virtue brother steve and
[1:30:41] that roman soldier
[1:30:42] he didn't realize what he was doing in
[1:30:45] those last few minutes of that
[1:30:46] through that action there was going to
[1:30:48] be a group of believers
[1:30:55] there might be somebody here tonight

[1:31:24] hymn of his garment and be
[1:31:26] healed it's your approach
[1:31:29] it's the atmosphere's got to be right
[1:31:32] everything's got to be ready i'm going
[1:31:35] to say it again

[1:31:45] room and not feel anything
[1:31:48] and somebody else is just trembling just
[1:31:50] trembling it's just coming from the top
[1:31:52] of their head to their bottom of their
[1:31:54] feet

[1:31:57] passion

[1:33:44] took a shower got all dressed brushed
[1:33:47] her teeth
[1:33:51] but now we're making ourselves ready to
[1:33:54] be passionate with the king
[1:33:58] now some of you know what passion is and
[1:34:01] the fire you know um
[1:34:06] if you looked it up on instagram or
[1:34:08] twitter
[1:34:10] or facebook you know everybody's
[1:34:12] interested in being liked you know
[1:34:13] they're just so liked
[1:34:16] there's actually syndromes today of
[1:34:18] people that they get a
[1:34:19] a negative or they get 16 negatives you
[1:34:22] know and they just go into depression
[1:34:25] because the world has created this
[1:34:27] environment you don't even need to be
[1:34:29] real you can just have your pajamas on
[1:34:31] and so
[1:34:32] you know post all kinds of stuff and
[1:34:33] then you're getting all this and that
[1:34:35] and like that and then
[1:34:36] people go into depression young people
[1:34:39] commit suicide
[1:34:41] i'll say this publicly in the last 14
[1:34:44] months that we've gone through
[1:34:46] this uh bleeply bleep do y'all remember
[1:34:49] that
[1:34:50] we're not going to give no glory to no
[1:34:52] bleeply plea
[1:34:54] you all know what i'm talking about we
[1:34:55] talked about it last night we're not
[1:34:56] going to talk about it
[1:34:58] but for the last 14 months and the
[1:35:01] things that have gone on and messaged
[1:35:02] churches and globally two
[1:35:04] shutdowns and all the things we've gone
[1:35:06] through had to be distanced from one
[1:35:08] another
[1:35:10] i'm more concerned about people dying
[1:35:12] spiritually
[1:35:16] i've seen more believers of the message
[1:35:18] get cold and indifferent and
[1:35:20] lose their spiritual breath and oxygen
[1:35:24] level go to almost zero
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:27] than to those that have been taken from
[1:35:29] us in our churches and
[1:35:32] you know i know of churches i know of
[1:35:34] one uh
[1:35:36] in the united states where at least 14
[1:35:38] believers died
[1:35:41] they passed away so it's not just
[1:35:44] it's not just something funny and i know
[1:35:47] for young people and
[1:35:49] young adults it didn't really hit that
[1:35:51] age group
[1:35:54] it was maybe a lot of older ones or
[1:35:56] people that had pre-existing
[1:35:58] we understand that but i'm more
[1:36:00] concerned about the spiritual death
[1:36:03] and the lethargy and the spiritual
[1:36:05] leprosy that's all over and
[1:36:08] spirits that have come in and what have
[1:36:09] you been doing with your downtime you
[1:36:11] that
[1:36:11] used to go to school and university and
[1:36:14] college and now you've been in front of
[1:36:16] a zoom and then
[1:36:17] you've been in front of a monitor even
[1:36:19] churches have
[1:36:20] resorted back to that when they couldn't
[1:36:23] gather and
[1:36:24] and it was shut down you know it seemed
[1:36:26] like a monitor or screen
[1:36:28] are we gonna get together and stream it
[1:36:30] became their church
[1:36:32] and we can become people where we don't
[1:36:34] respond
[1:36:35] because it's just a screen
[1:36:39] it's just a number out there that we
[1:36:41] it's just something
[1:36:42] in another state it's happening in india
[1:36:46] it's a wave
[1:36:46] it's a whatever they want to say but
[1:36:49] let's just turn spiritually
[1:36:52] where that wave would come and take
[1:36:54] hundreds of thousands of people's lives
[1:36:56] that
[1:36:56] we didn't even know about this thing
[1:36:58] months ago
[1:37:00] and it has literally shut down global
[1:37:02] economies and
[1:37:04] not just churches it shut down sports
[1:37:06] teams
[1:37:08] it shut down malls it shuts down
[1:37:10] restaurants
[1:37:12] there's a spiritual something behind all
[1:37:14] of that
[1:37:16] how's your spiritual life where's the
[1:37:19] fire of god on the altar
[1:37:22] where's the power of god moving i
[1:37:24] believe god is showing that in spite of
[1:37:26] all this
[1:37:27] global nonsense and fear that there's
[1:37:30] young people and youth
[1:37:32] that are being set on fire with the same
[1:37:35] holy ghost that was in the bible
[1:37:37] the same holy spirit that brother
[1:37:39] branham had the same holy spirit that
[1:37:41] was on the book of acts
[1:37:43] same holy spirit that was on those
[1:37:45] brother trevor
[1:37:46] that gave their lives under that
[1:37:48] anointing is in this building tonight
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:55] hallelujah it's like the waves of the
[1:37:57] ocean it comes in
[1:37:59] and then it goes out then it comes in
[1:38:02] again
[1:38:02] and then it comes out and if they're
[1:38:04] surfers here and
[1:38:05] you that have been to hawaii or in
[1:38:07] california you know people that love
[1:38:09] surfing
[1:38:10] and they're waiting for the wave they're
[1:38:11] waiting they're just getting excited
[1:38:13] they'll come down there with their big
[1:38:15] boards and everything
[1:38:16] and it's in their blood
[1:38:19] it's just it's some it's a passion
[1:38:22] they're surfers
[1:38:23] they want to be part of the move they're
[1:38:26] not staying at home and
[1:38:27] getting all stuffy and i'm not
[1:38:31] glorifying that
[1:38:32] i've never done it in my life but
[1:38:34] there's something about waves there's
[1:38:36] something about something that comes in
[1:38:38] and then goes out and god puts a hunger

[1:44:25] services our brother
[1:44:26] trevor did good today let me tell you a
[1:44:29] little something about that
[1:44:31] do you remember the picture brother
[1:44:33] trevor had up on the screen
[1:44:35] at the very beginning of the lions
[1:44:38] coming out and
[1:44:39] all the believers that were in the cat
[1:44:41] they were in the
[1:44:42] coliseum do you all remember that
[1:44:44] brother john looked at that exact same
[1:44:46] picture
[1:44:47] in my office minutes before coming to
[1:44:49] the service
[1:44:53] the same photo on my computer not
[1:44:56] because i also had that photo on my
[1:44:58] office
[1:45:00] because it's an amazing picture of
[1:45:04] a group of believers that this is the
[1:45:07] last moments of their life
[1:45:09] and there were old people there were
[1:45:11] middle age and there were young people
[1:45:13] there and little children
[1:45:15] and they were just getting ready to be
[1:45:16] eat by the lions they had just let the
[1:45:18] lions loose
[1:45:19] it's called the martyr's last prayer
[1:45:22] because some are kneeling some are
[1:45:23] standing
[1:45:24] and they're in that posture they're not
[1:45:27] worried
[1:45:28] about somebody's sandals
[1:45:31] and somebody hurt my feelings in the
[1:45:33] youth group
[1:45:34] or i'm fee i'm feeling a little sick
[1:45:36] tonight you know
[1:45:37] i can't worship because i'm feeling a
[1:45:40] little sick
[1:45:43] well if you knew what they had said
[1:45:44] about me on their instagram and my
[1:45:46] facebook and
[1:45:48] my twitter and we get all twisted up
[1:45:52] and our cell phones can be a device that
[1:45:54] we are addicted to
[1:45:57] and i don't want to hurt your feelings
[1:45:58] some of you are addicted to it
[1:46:01] and somebody tell you you're addicted to
[1:46:03] it you get offended no i'm not i'm not
[1:46:05] you're addicted
[1:46:09] do you know that do you know that words
[1:46:11] in the book of acts addicted
[1:46:13] there were people that were addicted to
[1:46:16] the saints
[1:46:17] and to the work of the ministry god help
[1:46:19] us to be more like that
[1:46:22] and they just let the lions loose
[1:46:26] what would be your last prayer i'm just
[1:46:30] kind of
[1:46:31] going slow because
[1:46:34] it needs to sink in we can be shouting
[1:46:37] and screaming
[1:46:38] yes yes and all standing but i wanted to
[1:46:41] sink in
[1:46:43] what would be your last prayer
[1:46:46] if the lions are just let loose
[1:46:50] this is serious this is this is bringing
[1:46:53] the coming of the lord
[1:46:54] present tense so that none of us are
[1:46:57] without excuse
[1:46:59] do you know that brother branham said in
[1:47:01] more than one place that there will be
[1:47:02] people coming
[1:47:04] to the altar after the bride is gone
[1:47:07] thinking they're getting saved
[1:47:09] how many know he said that there will be
[1:47:12] meetings going on when the bride is gone
[1:47:15] it's called a tribulation
[1:47:17] and people are gonna be coming forward
[1:47:19] thinking they're getting saved
[1:47:21] and they don't even realize the holy
[1:47:23] ghost is already lifted
[1:47:25] he's already gone the young people that
[1:47:27] were ready to go
[1:47:28] are already gone there's going to be
[1:47:30] some say to hold jesus oh jesus
[1:47:36] coming to an altar and crying out and do
[1:47:39] you know what
[1:47:39] that shows all of us whatever they had
[1:47:42] before the rapture
[1:47:44] wasn't real because it didn't get them
[1:47:48] in the rapture
[1:47:49] so then whatever crying and sign is
[1:47:52] going to go on
[1:47:53] is it is it what we need in this
[1:47:55] building tonight
[1:47:58] we need a real godly repentance that
[1:48:00] will cause a
[1:48:02] change i don't care if it's one person
[1:48:06] there ought to be 99 of us saying lord
[1:48:08] help that brother
[1:48:10] help that sister lord i'm willing to get
[1:48:13] in the harness i'm willing to get in the
[1:48:15] saddle
[1:48:16] and ride this out and it's not even for
[1:48:18] me
[1:48:19] it's for my sister it's for my brother
[1:48:22] it's somebody that came here with all
[1:48:23] kinds of ideas
[1:48:25] and god's getting their attention you're
[1:48:27] passionate about the wrong thing
[1:48:29] you're going in the wrong direction
[1:48:31] somebody going down for the last time
[1:48:33] but jesus heard their cry and he pulled
[1:48:36] them out of that
[1:48:37] and we had meetings in dallas and it was
[1:48:41] for one
[1:48:41] sheep
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] georgie carter and we might not never
[1:48:48] know
[1:48:50] sister leslie we might not never know
[1:48:54] on this side that that sister was
[1:48:57] delivered
[1:48:58] we might not never know that brother
[1:49:01] that he was set free
[1:49:04] but god was dealing with him he became
[1:49:07] passionate
[1:49:08] she turned the corner may that happen in
[1:49:12] these meetings
[1:49:14] that god put a further flame and a godly
[1:49:17] fire in our souls
[1:49:20] and give us a greater desire
[1:49:23] because let's just take the negative for
[1:49:26] a minute
[1:49:27] the world has passion for their
[1:49:29] immorality
[1:49:32] they are not ashamed to show their
[1:49:34] nakedness
[1:49:36] and it's getting worse and worse and
[1:49:38] worse
[1:49:39] they're skinned down they're ungodly
[1:49:42] when brother branham saw the vision
[1:49:44] it was the modern church of usa
[1:49:47] that was rocking and and dancing to the
[1:49:50] beat of rock and roll music
[1:49:52] it was not hollywood and it wasn't paris
[1:49:55] it was the church it was people that
[1:49:58] thought they knew
[1:49:58] jesus it was people that thought they
[1:50:01] knew the lord
[1:50:02] and they were passionate you look at it
[1:50:04] i could show you videos
[1:50:06] on the screen of people with earrings
[1:50:08] and makeup and they're just they're just
[1:50:10] moving and swaying they are under
[1:50:12] something
[1:50:14] there's some anointing i struck the
[1:50:16] earth
[1:50:19] they feel the pull of the hour they feel
[1:50:21] the pressure
[1:50:24] you see it when there's a natural a
[1:50:26] national catastrophe or something
[1:50:28] you see it on all their billboards pray
[1:50:30] pray pray and
[1:50:31] churches are filled up we don't need
[1:50:32] that kind of uh
[1:50:34] pull as believers that's emotion
[1:50:38] and a few a few months go by and they're
[1:50:40] right back out in the world
[1:50:41] too busy too busy church is secondary
[1:50:45] serving the lord is whatever god give us
[1:50:49] a power of holiness that would just drop
[1:50:51] down into our lives we
[1:50:53] we don't need to be screamed at and
[1:50:55] yelled at and told this and that
[1:50:57] we just need god to come in our lives
[1:51:00] and the earrings come out automatically
[1:51:06] you spend so much time with jesus and
[1:51:09] crying in tears it would mess up your
[1:51:11] makeup so bad
[1:51:12] even just naturally say i don't need
[1:51:14] that no more
[1:51:17] i'll just say this publicly to all of
[1:51:20] our sisters
[1:51:22] you don't need makeup to be beautiful
[1:51:26] we just think you're fine
[1:51:30] well brother john it would probably
[1:51:32] scare you all if you knew what i really
[1:51:34] look like without this makeup no

[1:53:37] music
[1:53:39] the number one and number five and
[1:53:41] number 10 in america
[1:53:43] is not going to be a song written by
[1:53:45] believers

[1:53:50] just make sure
[1:53:52] it's what we heard about last night that
[1:53:53] it's something you'd be proud to be
[1:53:55] played through heaven
[1:53:58] and it's amazing we said we quoted that
[1:54:00] last night and i heard it today
[1:54:02] because i've listened to about five or
[1:54:03] six messages since last night
[1:54:05] brother branham said your thoughts are
[1:54:07] heard louder in heaven
[1:54:08] than your words are on earth
[1:54:12] so just be mindful whatever music you
[1:54:14] think is in
[1:54:15] for you that it's it's fine to be played
[1:54:18] in heaven
[1:54:19] where there's holy angels and seraphim
[1:54:22] singing holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:54:26] don't don't be forcing the angels to be
[1:54:28] rushing over to the volume switch and
[1:54:30] say okay i'll
[1:54:31] i'll give her the next 30 minutes you
[1:54:33] know she's not where she needs to be

[1:54:49] little bit of his passion of his stripes
[1:54:51] that any person in this building are
[1:54:54] suffering from a sickness

[1:54:58] it right now

[2:00:29] influenced
[2:00:31] on palm sunday they're doing that
[2:00:34] hosanna hosanna taking off their clothes
[2:00:36] and throwing it down
[2:00:38] by thursday night and friday the same
[2:00:40] people are saying
[2:00:41] crucify him crucify him
[2:00:44] our opinion changed the majority rules
[2:00:48] he's a loser that's what the bible says
[2:00:54] so they're all yes yes he's coming in
[2:00:56] the name of the lord hosanna
[2:00:59] blessed me and by friday the crucifying
[2:01:05] it happens today something happened on

[2:01:10] denouncing
[2:01:12] god fill us with the holy ghost give me
[2:01:15] power
[2:01:16] give me power
[2:01:21] let's go to matthew chapter four
[2:01:25] i've been commissioned tonight to ask
[2:01:27] for reinforcements
[2:01:29] and recruits to join the lord's army
[2:01:34] not just initially what some of you
[2:01:37] thought
[2:01:38] because probably most of you have given
[2:01:40] your heart to the lord
[2:01:42] probably most of you matthew chapter 4
[2:01:45] verse 18
[2:01:47] are saved
[2:01:51] i'm taking it to the next level part two
[2:01:54] part two i'm going to the next level
[2:01:58] you want to go with me
[2:02:00] [Applause]
[2:02:01] you say come follow me come be a
[2:02:04] christian
[2:02:05] be baptized most of you have already
[2:02:08] followed
[2:02:09] and you're serving the lord and whatever
[2:02:11] level you are
[2:02:13] so i'm not talking about that but if
[2:02:16] you're not saved
[2:02:17] and you haven't given your heart to the
[2:02:18] lord and you've never repented or been
[2:02:21] baptized
[2:02:22] this is a good time to consider that
[2:02:28] and in your right mind and in your
[2:02:31] senses
[2:02:32] say i choose to follow this kind of
[2:02:35] jesus
[2:02:36] that said i'll never leave you nor
[2:02:38] forsake you
[2:02:39] and it's not because brother john it's
[2:02:41] not because i have a bunch of people
[2:02:43] in this room saying yes yes yes it's
[2:02:46] because in my heart
[2:02:47] i have made a decision and i want to see
[2:02:50] god come behind it
[2:02:53] and put fire in my heart now let's go
[2:02:56] back
[2:02:56] now i'm going rewind to matthew 4
[2:03:00] 18 when jesus was walking by the sea of
[2:03:04] galilee and seeing two brothers simon
[2:03:06] called peter and andrew his brother
[2:03:09] casting a net
[2:03:10] into the sea for they were fishers and
[2:03:12] he saith unto them
[2:03:14] what's the next two words follow me i'm
[2:03:17] called this is the call
[2:03:19] of peter and andrew follow me
[2:03:23] and i will make you fishers of men
[2:03:26] and they just put their arms like this
[2:03:28] and said who do you think you are
[2:03:31] telling us to leave our business our
[2:03:33] father and who are you
[2:03:36] i don't even know you no that
[2:03:39] this is the call
[2:03:43] and they followed him straightway right
[2:03:45] away they left their nets
[2:03:47] and followed him going on from fence he
[2:03:51] saw
[2:03:52] other two brethren james the son of
[2:03:54] zebedee and john his brother
[2:03:56] so it's james and john and a ship with
[2:03:58] zebedee their father mending their nets
[2:04:01] and he called them

[2:16:36] their eyes were open the way he broke
[2:16:39] bread is what he did before
[2:16:41] it's the same jesus it is the lord
[2:16:45] he was there all the time he was walking
[2:16:48] with us
[2:16:49] for these last hours and we were so
[2:16:51] caught up in our
[2:16:53] past and our downtrodden and our
[2:16:56] thoughts
[2:16:57] but by the more he talked about the word
[2:17:00] our hearts burn within us and now we're
[2:17:03] all saying
[2:17:04] it is jesus
[2:17:07] hallelujah let's all say jesus
[2:17:12] young people that are passionate and on
[2:17:14] fire say jesus
[2:17:16] do you know there was a little boy
[2:17:18] laying in the womb of a mother for six
[2:17:20] months hadn't moved
[2:17:22] [Applause]
[2:17:25] and a teenager a teenager a young girl
[2:17:30] about 15 years old to 18 had a
[2:17:33] a visit from an angel and before she
[2:17:37] even took a pregnancy test
[2:17:39] before she even felt any movement mary
[2:17:42] ran
[2:17:42] to elizabeth and started to confess the
[2:17:45] word
[2:17:46] and while she gave the testimony and
[2:17:49] said are you
[2:17:50] serious you're pregnant well you're not
[2:17:52] even married elizabeth
[2:17:53] said to mary you're you're not even why
[2:17:56] didn't you invite me to the wedding no
[2:17:57] no no no we've never been married
[2:17:59] it was the angel it was the word that
[2:18:02] said i'm this
[2:18:03] the word said i'm passionate
[2:18:05] [Applause]
[2:18:06] [Music]
[2:18:08] well what are you going to call him i'm
[2:18:09] sure his name shall be
[2:18:11] jesus and all of a sudden instead of
[2:18:14] elizabeth
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:20] they weren't talking about the movie and
[2:18:24] somebody done somebody wrong song
[2:18:27] they were talking about the words they
[2:18:30] were talking about isaiah's prophecy
[2:18:33] joseph and mary didn't have a carnal
[2:18:35] relationship
[2:18:37] before they were married she was a
[2:18:38] virgin
[2:18:41] hello wake up everybody we're talking
[2:18:43] about being passionate
[2:18:45] a young lady was passionate about the
[2:18:48] word
[2:18:49] and at the very name of jesus
[2:18:52] she was friends with her with elizabeth
[2:18:55] that was of the older generation
[2:18:58] hallelujah elizabeth was barren too
[2:19:01] we're not going to go into the whole
[2:19:03] story but even the high priest got
[2:19:05] struck
[2:19:06] dumb because he didn't believe how was
[2:19:08] these things going to be
[2:19:09] and god said because you didn't believe
[2:19:12] i'm striking you dumb
[2:19:14] boy that'd kill some of us wouldn't it
[2:19:17] hello
[2:19:18] you can't talk for nine months
[2:19:21] that'd be horrible wouldn't it zechariah
[2:19:23] was the high priest
[2:19:25] well mary said almost the exact same
[2:19:27] words if you go back to the
[2:19:28] how is these things going to be but it
[2:19:30] wasn't unbelief
[2:19:32] so someone that should have known better
[2:19:34] said well how is this going to be you
[2:19:36] know
[2:19:36] and mary says well how is these things
[2:19:38] going to be god didn't strike her dumb
[2:19:41] it shows how a young person can just be
[2:19:43] asking questions and it's not ungodly
[2:19:46] it's just the lord needs to reveal that
[2:19:48] in the next few minutes she's telling
[2:19:50] elizabeth
[2:19:51] of the promise and life is coming
[2:19:55] that's why i said let's all say jesus
[2:19:58] because we don't know what's happening
[2:19:59] in this room right now we don't know
[2:20:01] what god could do right now
[2:20:03] somebody that's been dead and even
[2:20:06] lazarus
[2:20:07] is asleep and all of a sudden
[2:20:11] he heard the name stinking
[2:20:14] rotten his nose falling in grave clothes
[2:20:18] wrapped around and
[2:20:19] all of a sudden he hears his name
[2:20:22] he's way out there somewhere in paradise
[2:20:25] and his name is called
[2:20:28] what am i supposed to do brother billy
[2:20:29] well go back there
[2:20:31] brother branham said there was so much
[2:20:33] power in his voice that if he would have
[2:20:35] said rise
[2:20:37] every person that was dead would arose
[2:20:39] from the dead
[2:20:40] but he said lazarus come forth
[2:20:44] tonight tonight the holy spirit is
[2:20:46] calling your name
[2:20:48] he's speaking to you come forth
[2:20:52] and you feel that little something you
[2:20:54] feel that little quickening
[2:20:56] you feel that little life mary didn't
[2:20:58] run and get a pregnancy test
[2:21:00] she was confessing the word before she
[2:21:02] saw any physical
[2:21:04] signs i'm quoting to you some of you
[2:21:06] thought well brother john why'd you
[2:21:08] bring that ipad so many quotes of
[2:21:09] brother branham
[2:21:10] well if you know the message i've been
[2:21:11] quoting brother branham
[2:21:13] throughout this whole weekend brother
[2:21:15] branham said before she even was
[2:21:17] positive
[2:21:19] she's confessing the word do you know he
[2:21:21] also said that about the upper room
[2:21:24] before they even received it they were
[2:21:26] confessing it

[2:21:30] terry in jerusalem
[2:21:32] i i called you tonight the upper room
[2:21:34] youth yes
[2:21:36] before you even feel it before you even
[2:21:39] see it
[2:21:40] before you even it strikes your emotion
[2:21:43] something strikes your soul
[2:21:45] [Applause]
[2:21:50] so now we're getting back to john 21
[2:21:52] excuse me for the delay
[2:21:56] and we're going to skip verse 18
[2:21:59] but verse 19 it's a good verse 18 but
[2:22:04] this signifying by what death he should
[2:22:06] glorify god jesus talking to peter
[2:22:08] sorry john 21 19. then he says these
[2:22:11] other two words
[2:22:13] that i'd like to speak about for a few
[2:22:15] minutes to some
[2:22:16] somebody here and the rest of you can
[2:22:19] just listen
[2:22:22] when he had spoken this or maybe it's
[2:22:25] somebody on the internet
[2:22:28] the lord wants to talk to him a little
[2:22:30] or her a little bit do you all have time
[2:22:33] welcome to the service
[2:22:36] you've been a disciple for years
[2:22:39] you've given your life to the lord
[2:22:41] before
[2:22:43] but now he's saying in verse 19
[2:22:46] he said unto him follow me
[2:22:50] well lord we've already been following
[2:22:51] you i've been your disciple

[2:22:57] taking you to the next level
[2:23:00] follow me peter and knowing him
[2:23:04] because peter's a type of the church he
[2:23:06] probably got a little upset and
[2:23:07] frustrated
[2:23:08] uh verse 17 said peter was grieved
[2:23:12] why you keep asking me this
[2:23:15] peter i'm going to go away in a few days
[2:23:18] and i know your nature and i know you

[2:23:56] middle of this
[2:23:58] season put away your sword that's not
[2:24:01] how it's going to happen
[2:24:02] jesus reached down on the ground that
[2:24:05] definitely wasn't sanitized
[2:24:07] he didn't get out the bottom one squirt
[2:24:09] squirt squirt and
[2:24:10] put it back on he just picked it up

[2:25:05] broken and jesus is here to say
[2:25:09] i'm here to heal the wounded in heart

[2:26:15] and they asked john because he was close

[2:32:06] of you
[2:32:07] ten of you or a hundred of you or

[2:32:50] including to death
[2:32:53] will you take up your cross and follow
[2:32:56] me
[2:32:57] all the way how many know history says
[2:33:00] when peter came to the time he was going
[2:33:03] to be put on the cross
[2:33:08] he remembered back there
[2:33:11] when he said i don't even know the man
[2:33:15] it stayed with him his whole life he
[2:33:18] denied the lord
[2:33:22] saul became paul always remembered
[2:33:25] when stephen was there the first
[2:33:28] murderer
[2:33:29] and and he was such a coward saul was he
[2:33:32] just said
[2:33:32] i'm not going to throw the stones i'm
[2:33:34] just going to sit over here everybody
[2:33:35] put your garments around me and
[2:33:37] everybody's throwing and bastion
[2:33:38] in stephen and saul's over there saying
[2:33:40] i got another one of those guys
[2:33:43] and for the rest of his life paul
[2:33:46] remembered that
[2:33:47] and that's why he said i am the chiefest
[2:33:49] among you
[2:33:50] sinners i persecuted i killed your
[2:33:54] mother i killed your brother i killed
[2:33:56] the song leader
[2:33:57] of that church the pastor of that i i
[2:33:59] signed his death warrant
[2:34:01] and sister so and so whenever that
[2:34:02] brother comes to preach at the church
[2:34:04] she's always like this you know why
[2:34:07] because you killed my husband
[2:34:10] three of my children that i bore and
[2:34:12] burnt you killed them
[2:34:14] i'm not going to receive bless god no
[2:34:17] you need to get out of the way that was
[2:34:18] a different person
[2:34:20] that was saul this is paul but do you
[2:34:23] all understand
[2:34:25] saul paul remembered that forever that's
[2:34:27] why he said i'm more passionate
[2:34:29] i'm more ardent than anyone
[2:34:33] and now peter's at this time of death
[2:34:36] and he said
[2:34:37] i'm not worthy to die like my lord
[2:34:41] and they hung him upside down god give
[2:34:44] us

[2:35:00] so much you ought to give the rest of
[2:35:03] your life for him
[2:35:06] no sob stories no whimpering
[2:35:09] if nobody ever shakes your hand
[2:35:13] if you're a pauper and live under the
[2:35:15] the bridge
[2:35:16] where you live but you go to heaven and
[2:35:19] you're part of the bride

[2:35:30] been forgiven much
[2:35:32] i'm going to serve the lord with
[2:35:33] gladness
[2:35:36] but some of you that's been raised in
[2:35:37] the message and i have been too
[2:35:40] we ought to just say from our hearts
[2:35:42] because the lord
[2:35:43] has saved me from much i love him much

[2:36:38] hands in his side and listen and you
[2:36:40] know what jesus did
[2:36:42] he didn't say because you did that
[2:36:44] you'll never do anything for me
[2:36:46] the next time thomas was in the room
[2:36:49] jesus comes in and he says
[2:36:51] oh by the way thomas
[2:36:58] do you all know why because thomas was
[2:37:01] the son of god
[2:37:03] he didn't say all because of your
[2:37:04] unbelief and because you're no good and
[2:37:07] just because you didn't see you don't
[2:37:09] believe no no
[2:37:11] he said thomas here i am i'm trying to
[2:37:13] make myself known to you

[2:44:13] ashamed if you knew my past life
[2:44:16] isn't it amazing that the god that knows
[2:44:19] all of our private lives
[2:44:20] is still preaching to us like this
[2:44:23] turning the corner saying
[2:44:26] it's time to go to the next level it's
[2:44:28] time to move on now

[2:44:58] come and cap off this evening
[2:45:00] service with the supernatural
[2:45:03] and vindicate that what brother john has
[2:45:06] spoken
[2:45:07] was your mind and your will
[2:45:11] as soon as we walked into the gym this
[2:45:13] morning
[2:45:14] and saw that picture that brother trevor
[2:45:16] had on the screen
[2:45:18] that was enough witness of what i just
[2:45:21] saw a few minutes before in my little
[2:45:23] motel room there's a mind of god for
[2:45:27] this
[2:45:28] there's a pre-planning for all of this
[2:45:31] what you laid on brother david's heart
[2:45:33] sister leslie's heart and this assembly
[2:45:36] to invite us and to come all of us this
[2:45:39] weekend and all the
[2:45:41] expense and all the labors was for our
[2:45:43] good it was to
[2:45:45] give a reflection of god's grace and
[2:45:47] mercy
[2:45:50] that means there's some that are here or
[2:45:52] will
[2:45:53] stream this service or is watching right
[2:45:56] now that is saying in their hearts
[2:45:58] lord make me more passionate
[2:46:01] give me a love and a fire
[2:46:05] in my bosom that i won't even be able to
[2:46:07] contain it
[2:46:08] let it be fire in my bosom
[2:46:13] would you do that lord for us tonight
[2:46:16] would you confirm your word with signs
[2:46:18] following
[2:46:19] would you cast out the evil lord if
[2:46:21] there's any sin
[2:46:23] among us that we've taken some time of
[2:46:25] these precious people's time
[2:46:27] and their energy to spend in a service
[2:46:30] but we'd much rather be here
[2:46:32] we'd much rather be a door keeper in the
[2:46:35] house of our god
[2:46:36] than to dwell in the tents of the wicked
[2:46:39] [Music]
[2:46:42] we'd much rather one of our sisters be
[2:46:45] simple and humble
[2:46:46] and homely among us
[2:46:50] than to be a cheerleader for the dallas
[2:46:52] cowboys or a dance
[2:46:55] flaunting her virtues
[2:46:58] for some lustful eyes some spirit of the
[2:47:02] enemy
[2:47:02] trying to choke out the life
[2:47:06] breathe on us breathe on this
[2:47:08] congregation
[2:47:10] and teach us how to breathe again teach
[2:47:13] us how to
[2:47:14] breathe in breathe out

[2:47:23] let us be thankful let there be
[2:47:25] spontaneous
[2:47:26] praises as the young lady that was 18
[2:47:29] years old
[2:47:30] it wasn't an ordinary service it was a
[2:47:32] time of the
[2:47:33] young people gathering that she
[2:47:36] stood up in the meeting and said lord
[2:47:38] jesus i love you
[2:47:40] with all of my heart and the power of
[2:47:42] god fell in that meeting
[2:47:45] and over a hundred thousand souls were
[2:47:47] one to christ
[2:47:48] in the welsh revival but it started with
[2:47:51] a group of young people
[2:47:54] that became passionate and on fire
[2:47:58] and didn't care what everybody else
[2:48:00] thought about them
[2:48:01] but they said lord they were praying
[2:48:03] they were praying and a young man
[2:48:05] 22 years old coming out of the coal
[2:48:07] mines and other brothers and sisters
[2:48:10] earl roberts and others that
[2:48:11] if i showed their pictures maybe some
[2:48:13] would even laugh maybe a little bit
[2:48:15] their mustaches or their
[2:48:16] little dresses but they became they
