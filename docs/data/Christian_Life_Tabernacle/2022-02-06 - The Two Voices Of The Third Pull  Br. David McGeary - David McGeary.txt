Description:
The Two Voices Of The Third Pull
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: February 6, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

this morning as you invite brother mike for so i'm reading we welcome our visitors this morning god bless you you know jesus said in well he was speaking to the people in what we call the sermon on the mount he made a statement in matthew chapter five and verse five it said this just a short simple statement it says blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth you know it's such a simple statement but how significant that is the meek shall inherit the earth the earth not by effort not bought with riches but inherited you know that word inherit means this to come into possession of or to receive especially as a right or a divine portion jesus said that somebody inherits receives as a gift the earth you know i was thinking about how you look out at the world today and how everybody seems to struggle and fight for their little piece of the earth you know they working as hard as they can gathering as many riches as they can obtaining as many possessions as they can you know fighting with one another for control and for ownership and for accomplishment and you know when things don't go their way or when they see another person as an obstacle to what they'd like to get they get all stirred up they get angry they get frustrated they they attack one another they kill themselves trying to obtain what is going to be given away as a gift you know and no matter how hard the world works to obtain their little piece the earth it's already spoken for it's going to be given away you know when you read that the meek shall inherit the earth it causes this at least caused me to think kind of two things first of all it's probably not worth any time at all worrying about what you're gonna get or gather or accomplish or save up just gonna be given away anyway but second of all it makes me wonder who's the meek who are these ones that are going to inherit the earth what does it mean to be meek you know that's not another word that's not used in the scripture very often meek you know i think it's half maybe a dozen times it's mentioned but you know moses is mentioned in in numbers as being the meekest man on the earth but what is the meek what does it mean to be meek who are the meek well as we look at psalm 37 this morning this psalm talks about the me and you know what's interesting is jesus said in mark 8 36 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul and yet he describes there being someone who inherits the earth i'm going to read about that in psalm 37 this morning it speaks about those who inherit the earth five times it uses the phrase inherit the earth that's a phrase that's really not used anywhere else other than when jesus said it and then here in psalm 37 so in this chapter are the keys to the meek and how to inherit the earth in its very first verse the very first statement the very first characteristic don't fret no matter what's going on around you fret not thyself don't allow yourself to get stirred up by what's going on around you what's happening around you the meek shall inherit the earth you know it's uh what's interesting is three times in this chapter it cautions us to fret not you know among the many things that brother branham taught us when the scriptures repeat themselves we should pay attention in fact it goes on in verse 10 for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be fret not thy so here's another key verse 3 trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed trust in the lord in fact it says in verse 25 i have been young and now i'm old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread trust in the lord the meek shall inherit the earth here's another one verse 4 delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart well if your desire is him then he'll give you your desire here's another one verse 5 commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass it says in verse 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way there's that word again verse 24 though he fall he shall not utterly be cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand the meek shall inherit the earth seems like an odd way to inherit all things gets better verse 7 rest in the lord and wait patiently for him and then once again a reminder not to fret verse 34 it says wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it here's another one verse eight cease from anger and another reminder not to fret not to fret thyself in any wise in fact it says in verse 8 that doing that he calls that doing evil you know it turns out that the keys to inheriting the earth are not outsmarting out fighting out working out spending out thinking it's resting it's trusting it's committing yourself to him it's not fretting it's not being angry the meek shall inherit the earth you know as we read psalm 37 this morning it's a bit of a longer chapter but i think it's important that as we read this we consider that the meek shall inherit the earth and this is the key to that inheritance trust in him commit your ways to him i've never seen the righteous beg bread he commits the steps of a good man let's read that together psalm 37 starting in verse 1 fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noonday rest in the lord and wait patiently for him for it not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of an upright conversation their sword shall enter their own heart and their bows shall be broken a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked but the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now em old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell forevermore for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide the wicked watcheth the righteous and seek it to slay him the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace but the transgressors shall be destroyed together and the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him amen amen god bless you have your seats oh yes i spent in vanity and pride oh care and heart my lord was [Music] for me [Music] [Music] me [Music] is

you took wouldn't be in vain that we claim that healing lord we know our our rest is coming eternal rest the lord we want to rest this side of the river you said you enter into your rest lord so we just want to claim the promise this morning lord [Music] lord and just believe it as peter left that ship and said lord if that's you did me to come and you said come he began to walk on the water lord he defied science all the things that were around lord because he had his eyes on you but when he saw the wind was boisterous he began to sink [Music] the lord he knew where his strength lied he called immediately on you and you stretched forth your hand and you saved him so lord this morning there may be those thinking amongst us lord may they call fervently on your name lord and may you

oh oh oh oh [Music] [Music] amen our gracious father [Music] you did not give man the vocabulary to describe your greatness [Music] lord or the mind to comprehend you for he said the kingdom of god is within you that you can neither know the beginning or the end of it lord your majesty is laid before us in all the things we see around us for the invisible things of god are clearly seen in the invisible things about us lord we just appreciate you this morning we thank you for the wonderful testimonies that we've heard father our hearts leap with joanne to see so many more wonderful things that are going to come to pass we ask you to help us this morning forgive us our trespasses father may your word stand in its solemn place father because it's of its own merits we ask you to bless us now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles this morning so we're going to go into a little something this morning and it may take a little while so you only have one service today so i'm going to use the technique of my friend to the east he just has one service but it's long but i hope you'll enjoy the word brother mike certainly spoke to me this morning i'm one of those kind of people you know i'm a presser and i push and i press and you know it comes with your nature you know he comes with your name you know i i'm named david you know i like killing giants and i i like getting things done you know brother graham says that's one thing about about a leader nobody likes them much you know so i've heard that they hate it when i walk through the door at the city but you got overcome you know so everybody's got something he's got to overcome and there's nothing that helps you overcome like the word of god so we just take the word of god we take it to heart we ask for his grace and mercy to give us the strength to be uh in that rest that he has you know but i certainly know what it's like to be bought from the sheepfold i wasn't exactly brought from the sheepfold i was bought from the hippie fold and so but god's wonderful to us but i i want to share something with you this morning and if i had a title for it i'd call it the two voices of the third pull the two voices of the third pole and i hope it's a blessing to you this morning brother ben makes the statement in perfect faith he says i believe we're mature enough out of the church to go into some deeper things so we certainly want to do that so let's turn in our bibles to hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th verse the fourth chapter and the 12th verse of hebrews this morning and and we just trust that this will unfold we're going to listen to like 10 minutes of a sermon this morning to set up where that we're going and why we're going there and it says for the word of god is quicker and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit now that's pretty deep so we know that the word of god will press deep into our hearts even to the separating of the soul in the spirit if i could say that to the separating of what is god's and what is man's so that's what the word of god does it separates what is god and what is man the word of god will separate what is your flesh and what is your spirit because these two things war against each other and you have that battle within you and and so it says dividing us under the soul and the spirit and the joint in the marrow as in a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open un to the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen so nothing's here he knows us right this today and yet he still loved us and he still went to cavalry for us and he still forgave us let us bow our heads as we pray our father we asked this morning that you would help us bring this thought that you put on our heart may the people be very uplifted by it father may they realize where we are and what's transpiring and have a vision of the hour they live in recognize the day and their message father give us i savv this morning that we might see i ask you to forgive me of all my shortcomings father my weaknesses father but your word stands above any man any personality father it's true like the song says your god no matter where i am you're still the great creator we ask you to touch the people's hearts today in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated this came upon my heart last week as we preached a sermon last sunday many of you are here and we were talking about the battle that's going on for our mind and we realize there's a great battle for our thinking going on that's where the battle is the greatest battle that was ever fought was in our mind and we as we read that and as we preached on that we came to the conclusion by reading the statements that our messenger made that the word of god is not made to be reasoned with it's only made to believe and that's like you can if i was to take you out into the lot next door and get a piece of rebarb you know rebarb is a thin metal steel bar that's used to reinforce concrete and say eat this well you would respond to me it's not made to be eaten it's not what it's made for well the word of god is not made to be figured out it's not made to be reasoned with it's not made to be logical that's the kind of god we serve we he does he does he's an unexpected god doing things in unexpected ways his ways are what beyond finding out god has no reasoning but his own reason and he's not obligated to share that with us but what he has done for us is he's placed something within us to believe and that's how the word of god is it's accepted it's believed it's just like forgiveness of sins he's forgiven your sins but it will never do you any good till you accept that forgiveness and act accordingly one day you've got to lay down the regret you've got to lay down the memories you've got to lay down the past draw a line in the sand with the blood of the lord jesus christ and not walk back past it you know what i mean and he did that for you while you were yet a sinner he died for you so the gospel is not what saves you the gospel brings you the news of that salvation so it's good news and if you can believe it and accept it and tape it as your possession then you work according to what that you have peter worked according to what he had silver and gold have i none but i have got something i was in a room a parent the other day and the pillars of fire came in licks of fire and his holy spirit came down his presence the same one i walked with and i talked with and i knew the one that called me out upon the water to walk upon the water and bid me to come i knew his spirit i knew his nature and i we were in this room praying and all of a sudden rushing mighty wind came and that same person that same nature that same spirit came and it dwelt in me and you know that promise is for you and for your children and as many as our are far off and as many are called the indwelling presence of the lord jesus christ the baptism of the holy spirit the evidence of it is jesus christ made known personally to you or in you and so he he was there and he began to to to speak of these great things that god did so he had it it's a possession so the word of god is always preached but it but it's always to the ears of the hearer let them who hear these things to him who hath ears to hear and that is a blessing that you should always thank god for that you have ears to hear that's why god put certain of you in certain homes because that would be the way that you would hear others come other ways amen i would love to have been raised up in a message home i was raised up in a catholic home you know and there was things that were but it led me to go astray but i'm so thankful that the good shepherd he doesn't forsake his own and so i always want to encourage you about your children they're part of your inheritance they're part of your reward if you live for god god will reward you with your children and and i i i will hold true to that with all my heart i'll stand with any parent any uh person that's holding on for a loved one never ever let that slip from you so we as we begin to preach last week i begin to mention to you about the sermons that were being preached dear in 61 and 62 and the 60s and that time frame in there the prophet of god talks about there was a period between his uh ministry so we know brother bram's ministry was based in three parts right or three polls he tried to explain it he he had a vision and many of you you know that the lord dealt with the prophet by vision he would catch him up he would show him things and then he would reveal to him things he would correct him by visions and speak to him by vision and a prophet god speaks to audibly lip to ear and everything that god does is based in prophecy okay everything that god does is based in prophecy because god can do nothing unless he first reveals it to his servants the prophet you you think that you might think when you go back and read the book of genesis but that was written by a prophet in sun-dried times and by diverse manners the spirit of god moved upon the prophets and they wrote scripture so everything that we do is based in prophecy because the spoken word is the original seed so the before it was recorded it was spoken so command's interpretation many times get mixed up that's why god doesn't rely on interpretation of man he relies on revelation amen i remember aaron shared with me something and it really struck me in his heart there was a great court proceeding going on and in the court there were two attorneys one attorney is a well-known professor and the other attorney and the one attorney looked to the judge and he said your honor i believe when the man that wrote this piece of legislation and this law i believe this is what he meant and the other attorney stood up and said your honor i'll tell you exactly what i meant when i wrote that you know what i mean so i don't want somebody telling me what he meant i want him to tell me what he meant and that's what he built the church on is revelation and so everything is based within prophecy okay so this morning we are living what was spoken of us to live you understand that you we think that we are uh we think that we have so much of our own way but the word of god says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord so let me put this in another context for you the footsteps of the righteous are prophesied by the lord that's how god orders things is by prophecy this is what it'll be this is what it'll be this is what it'll be because everybody's taught from the earthly standpoint and the religious standpoint is that people preach a bunch of rules and a bunch of guidelines and it's like you follow it like a road map and you keep these creeds and dogmas and and you have these experiences and you get to heaven no he knows where point one started he knows where it's again he's alpha and omega the beginning to end and he's bringing things to pass we are foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them for the purpose of his will and so understanding that these things are brought forth in prophecy we understand that brother brown's ministry he had a vision explained it in three polls the first poll was the taking of the hand he would take his left hand and take it to a person's right hand and he would feel the vibrations and through these vibrations he would know i don't know how he know but i knew he was ordained to know it was a gift in fact he would take his watch off because of the things that would take and i think i'm correct with the left to the right but if i'm not just forgive me but so the this pull was um it went on for a while the praying for the sick and and laying on hands and then he said there was a period of time in where he rested and he went off the field through the water and then there was a second poll or a second part of his ministry and i want to talk about that just for a second this morning and again this is like a sunday school and i hope that i can stay calm and precise and and and practice a little meekness but you know i'm pretty excitable so if i get excited just hold on for me would you because people think i'm against running around but i'm not i just think you need the right purpose to run around okay he said he said this he said the second was rebuking the organizations and prophesying what they had done what they were and what was coming what is what was what will come and what was what is and will come that's what he done is that right so that's the second pull well when i began to look last week and i began to say let's look at some of the sermons that he was preaching during the second pulse that caught my attention you know what he was doing and sure enough i came back and found it in the souls that were imprisoned now exactly him explaining what went on in his third poll how many that knows the two ministries ran exactly parallel that's because that's what that's what he he said he would do he said i wonder if his ministry climbs out the same way in the last days as it was as the father sent me so i send you the works that i do shall you do also so the prophet cut that his ministry went the same way okay the second part of his ministry was rebuking denominations that's why he said go back and read the titles forsaking all presuming you know warning then the judgment he's all these sermons that he was a preaching was this second poll rebuke it was the discerning of the heart remember that's what a second poll was was discerning of the heart but don't just leave that in the carnal realm because we think second poll oh you're mrs jones you know you're mrs smith or turning his back you're from here that you're from there and and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart no what the second pull was was the sharp two-edged sword okay and it was discerning act as we as we uh as we read in hebrews here it was discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and separating the soul and the spirit well what happened in you as your soul you you you found out oh i'm just a sinful man i've got all these lust in my life and everything but then a word came along and let you realize that there was another part of you that was the seed of god it it be what what was the intent of your heart so when you heard the word of god you you were brought to repentance because you said lord i never i didn't want to be this way i'm sorry for what i've done that's not my heart not really what i am you know you were brought under conviction what was that you were under the discernment of the sword of the word of god that that's what that's what it was he he told people what their sins were what was right what was wrong that that that second book but it was also doing something it was separating sheep from goat the second pool was was discerning those that were separating those out to hear the word of god so what was going to follow was the third pool now i don't understand all the third poll and i am not trying to explain all of the third poll but i believe that we are in that third poll may i read this statement to you but you can't kill the ministry it lives on you can put the messenger to sleep but you can't put the message right he lived on and noticed when the third pole of his ministry comes and he talks about the first was healing so you can't you the messenger can go to sleep i love how he uses that word to sleep but the message will live on so after there came there came a time where brother brahm had the ministry of the third poll and there's a period of time where he goes through questioning is this the third pole could this be the third pole is this the third pole but then he comes to an experience okay where it becomes more vivid to him what it is so he's been preaching against denominations where they come from the great harlot reasoning creeds dogmas he preaches where they came from what they are and what they will be amen world council of churches organization further away from the word of god what was it prophecy he was prophesying so at the same time that he's prophesying he's telling what's going to come so now we're going to pick this up and and i wanted to play more of it but if you go back and read the first seventy six paragraphs of souls that are in prison we're going to pick up a paragraph 77 just to explain the vision but brother brown talks about the time when he was 14 years old that his good buddy friend jim pool shotgun went off and shot him in the legs and he explains the compassion of the sisters that stood by his bedside and how that the ku klux klan and and different people people helped him out with this hospital bill and the doctor and and how he went through all that suffering and then later on they couldn't get all the shotgun wad and the clothing out of his leg it's so compassionate you know and i i think sometimes that i have it hard and and then i i think of people like my brother who lost two children and other people that have suffered you know and i i thought you know i really don't have much to say in the line of suffering i think my greatest suffering is suffering with myself and with my nature and that i pray every day that the love of god would be shed abroad in my heart by the holy spirit and that's one thing i believe is that i have a pure heart but he talks about how he descends and what a time it was so brother ram is going to go back now and tell us of the vision he had when he was 14 years old and descended into hell it's only 10 minutes but there's nobody that can tell it like the person to whom it happened god bless you may you enjoy these next few moments and um now now in this i tell you what happened in the vision that i had i'll go back because i brought that the two visions in to show you about one of them i used to be out west i've always longed for that and now the purpose of the message this morning is to post the church and everything that he'll let me post the church to as far as i know until the uh as i go along and this struck me so i wanted to post the church now this is to this tabernacle only see here now and in this vision the first one here's what taking place after the vision struck me and i was so weak and i lost all that blood and once i thought i was sinking into a endless eternity many of you heard me tell this before and and sinking into an endless eternity first i was going through like clouds and then through darkness and sinking on down down down and the first thing you know i got into the regions of the lost and in there i i screamed and i looked and there just everything there was no foundation to it i can never stop falling for eternity look like i was going to fall there's no stopping nowhere and then what a difference it was from the vision i had you're not long ago of being in glory with the people the contrast but in this as i was falling i finally i screamed for my daddy of course being just a kid that's what i would do i screamed for my daddy and my daddy wasn't there i screamed for my mother somebody catch me there was no mother there i was just going i screamed then to there was no god there there was nothing there and after a while i heard the most mournful sound that i ever heard and it was an office feeling there's no way even a literal burning fire would be a pleasure to decide of what this was now those visions has never been wrong and it was just one of the most horrible feelings i ever had and what did i heard a noise sound like some kind of a a haunted affair and when it was i looked coming and it was women and they had green stuff yes you just see their face and they had green stuff under their eyes and their eyes looked like run back like uh the women today paint their eyes run back like that and just their eyes and face they were going oh oh my i just screamed out oh god have mercy upon me have mercy o god where are you if you'll only let me go back and live i promise you to be a good boy now that's the only thing i could say now god knows and at the day of judgment he'll judge me for that statement that's what i said lord god let me go back and i'll promise you i'll be a good boy and when i got shot i had told lies i had done pretty everything there was to be done only one thing that i said i might as well just clean it out while i'm right here now and when i looked down and seen i was half loading two almost i said god have mercy on me you know i never did commit adultery that's the only thing that i could say to god i never accepted his pardon and all these things i just said could say i never did commit adultery and then they've taken me out there and then in that i cried god be merciful to me i'll be a good boy if you'll only let me go back for i knew there was a god somewhere and so help me those weary creatures all around i'd just been a new arrival most hideous horrible ungodly feeling in that look like great big eyes the big eyelashes out like that and run back like a cat like back like this and green stuff and like it cankered or something and they were they're going oh what a feeling now when i then in a moment's time i'd come back to natural life again that thing has bothered me i thought oh let it be that i'll never go to a place like that no other human being will ever have to go to a place like that seven months later i had the vision of standing in the west and seeing that gold cross coming down upon and i i knew that there was a regence of the damned somewhere now i never noticed it too much until about four weeks ago the wife never thought of it in this terms about four weeks ago the wife and i went down to tucson to do some shopping and while we were setting the wife we went downstairs and and there was a bunch of like boys had their hair red did you know like the women does and and bangs combed down here in front and these real high trousers on i guess a beet next or what you call them and they were in there and everybody's looking at them their heads is that big like the women it wears easier a water head hair cut you know and they were down there and a young woman come by and she said what do you think about that i said then you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you can think of that i said he had just as much right to do it as you do neither one of you have a right so i went upstairs and i sat down and when i did there's an escalator it was a jc penny store and that escalator bringing the people up well i really turned sick at my stomach uh seeing those women come up there young old and indifferent wrinkled young and everyway with little bitty shorts on their filthy body and those sexy dressed women were those great big heads like that and here they come and one coming around that escalator is coming right up like that where i was sitting back in a chair sitting there in my head down and i turned and looked and one of them coming up the steps was saying spanish speaking to another woman she was a white woman speaking to the spanish woman and when i looked all over once i was changed there i'd seen that before her eyes you know how the women are doing now paint their eyes just recently like cat you know put it up like this and wearing cat glasses and everything you know with eyes up like this and that green stuff under their eyes there was that thing i seen when i was a child there was a woman just exactly and i just got numb all over and began to look around and there was those people mumbling you know going on about the prices and things in the building and i just looked like it i just changed for a moment and i look i thought that's what i saw in hell there they was that canker i thought because they were in hell what made him that way a greenish blue under their eyes and here was these women painted with greenish blue just the way that vision said about 40 years ago okay about 40 years ago it's what it's been i'm 54 i was 14. so about 40 years ago i and that's the the that's the number anyhow of the judgments you see now there was i've seen that and i couldn't even speak to my wife when she come she's over there trying to get a sarah and a kid some kind of a dress or something for school and i i couldn't even i couldn't even speak to her she said bill what's the matter with you i said honey i'm i'm almost a dead man and she said what's the matter you sick i said no something's just happened now she don't know she's waiting for this tape to return i've never said it to nobody i thought i'd wait as i promised bring it to the church first bring it to the church that's my promise and you'll realize that you're tonight reason i'll try to keep my promise in i thought then as i noticed them hankered looking eyes on them women there were the spanish the french and indian and white and all together but that great big heads you know bushed up without combs where they comb it back way big and then comes out you know you know how they do it fix it in the like and then them canker looking eyes and the eyes with a paint that run back like a cat's eye and then talking and there i was again standing there at j.c penney's store back in hell again [Music] i i got so scared i thought lord surely i haven't died and you've let me come to this place after all and there they were making just around like at a in that vision like you could just barely hear it with your ears you know just the mumbling going off people and then women coming up that escalator and walking around there and there's them green and funny-looking eyes mournful wife come up and i said just let me alone i mean honey i said if you don't mind i i want to go home and she said are you sick i said no let's go ahead honey you've got any shopping to do she said no i'm finished and i said let me take it but see i walked i said what's the matter i said meaty i i something happened up there and while i was under that i thought this what day are we living in could this be the third pool i've got so i want to take it from there he had descended in in basically in the vision he had descended into hell is that right god gave him two visions he's talking about one was when he was out west with the cross coming down you know that's where he got saved it's also where he descended up in to the heaven and was caught up i was like paul said i was caught up into the heavenlies caught up into the third day so he descended into hell and when he was there he saw this vision and that's when it came back to him and he said i'm in hell again he says is this the third poll so i want to talk first to you about the first voice of the pope now it's not a different voice you know maybe instead of using the word voice i might use the word message but the voice went to two different classes of people so let's just take a moment if i i could and you could turn uh with me if you wanted to to um the back of that same book around paragraph 277 now remember because we're speaking in our day we just quoted that the messenger can go to sleep but the message continues on so the voice of the first pull still continues on in fact everybody's trying to impersonate it a lot of people have vibrations in their hands they have discernment they they they do all those things but the trouble with an impersonation is it is an impersonation so the the original has moved on so they're left back in another day you you don't think impersonations are amazing i always thought it was amazing of them building an ark in kentucky i used to always think of that when i was a kid i'd like to build that ark again i bet you i could sell tickets now i guess you pay 50 bucks to go into a boat-shaped barn but it's it's a day gone by what a rebuke what a what a sign because you know the prophet of god said you know that that god why did abraham marry hagar you know not just because sarah wanted to god said sarah's telling you to do the right thing because there had to be an ishmael there had to be a contrast there had to be something that showed that the air is not joint air with the bonds woman and also jacob i've loved esau i've hated so the revival there's always been two strains there's always been a jesus and a judas a canaan and abel a jesus and a judas there's there's always been to that that strain esau and a jacob every revival has twins there's two vines there's two things so the third pole has two sides to it it's got two voices a voice to one and a voice to the other it's one voice but people hearing two different things from the same voice now the question is today that you've got to you've got to ask yourself because we preached that last week i didn't even know why i preached it last sunday and now i was absorbed up into that that second pull and the titles of those sermons and we kept talking about the voice trying to get to your mind the voice of reasoning to the this voice that goes out because there's a voice of the third pole and that voice is to the lost and that's what he said i'm in hell could this be that third pole and that's why he said you could kill a ministry uh but but you uh you can't jesus's ministry was when he healed the sick he was a wonderful young prophet of galilee why he makes the blind to see and even rapes the dead oh we got three cases of it he actually raised the dead but one day he turned around and said you generation of vipers you make the outside of the platter clean but you appear to be holy but inside of you you are nothing but a bunch of snakes you appear to be holy but inside you you're nothing but a bunch of snakes oh when that prophecy went forth condemning that organization then it changed it turned against him that's right and finally rejected him they crucified him how many does the thought come to your mind of the message that brother brown preached the indictment everything is so perfect in god's word and he says but you can kill the ministry it lives on you can put the messenger to sleep but you can't put the message right he lives on and notice when the third pull of his ministry to come the first poll was healing the sick this paragraph 277 second poll was the rebuking of organizations and prophesying hebrews 14 12. we just mentioned it and what they what it was what it was where it come from uh it says he says prophesied what they had done what they were what was coming what is what is will come and what was what is and will come that he done that right right so that was the second poll it was brother branham's second poll two because he he said now the third poll was when he preached to the lost that couldn't no more couldn't be saved no more they were down there where them big painted eyes was preaching to the souls in hell they did not accept mercy but were eternally separated from the presence of god but let they had but yet they had to recognize it what he was because god made him there now the third poll was to the lost now the same time brothers now brother braham is now going into his third poll we'll get to this in a second so he he says is this the start of the third bull in other words i'm going to be preaching to the lost to people who can't be saved so many people misunderstood this message many you are you are younger brother tim might be old enough when he was a younger boy so many people begin to sing nobody's saved there's nobody what about our children our children once you understand this that question never comes to you again because there's another side of the third pole and we'll go to that side here in a moment but once we want to establish this third pull is to the lost so he's preaching to people that are not going to be saved and part of that is is because they come to the place where they blaspheme the ministry of the son of man and there's no forgiveness for that sin in this life or the life to come they rejected brother abraham not because of the healing they knew that the prophecy and the rebuke about him was true but they rejected him when he claimed to be the seventh angel and opened the seals no you take too much upon yourself but let us just read if i i could i don't know if it's my eyes that are blurry or my glasses probably both oh i wonder if his ministry combines out the same way in the last days the loss could never be saved they had rejected mercy that was his third pull now is there any question his first paul healing is sick is that right the second ministry he was prophesying the third ministry is preaching to the eternal lost three mountains and so forth he's talking about the peaks and things like that because he's inclining a bunch of different messages here together he says noah's ministry all ministries done the same noah preached that exactly right he went into the ark and when he went into the ark there was seven days that nothing happened his testimony was preached to the doomed sodom and gomorrah jesus referred to both of them as coming before the coming of the son of man shall be like in the days of noah it she be like in the days of sodom so in the coming of the son of man there's a portion of the ministry that's to the lost he's preaching to him but they're not hearing it they're preaching to but it's having no effect that's no wonder he got to that place he said i come back here year after year after year and you get worse and worse oh capernaum oh los angeles city of the angels you exalt yourself into heaven but you shall be brought to the lowest hell he could knows the same way solomon jurors referred to both of them noah had three poles and his three pulse was to the lost after the door was shut god let it sit right there where nobody could enter or go out they were inside for for this seventh mountain the highest mountain that where he settled the ark mountain is that right so i mean i i don't have time to go back over the peaks and the poles and the peaks and how the seventh peak represented his ministry and what had he said settled on that seventh peak the ark the place of safety for the believer now we're just going to i'm going to read a little bit read along with me because we i think this we're old enough to accept these things he says in the days of paraguay and dave of uh sodom first poll was to righteous lot and the bible said the sins of sodom have vexed his righteous soul daily how them women acted and done you remember as it was in the days of noah what they were doing eating drinking giving in to marriage see what was it in the days of sodom and the first message was lot they laughed him to scorn then he sent another messengers two of them and they went down that was the second poll sodom right now this is where we want to uh make the turn right here so if you understand that there's a portion in brother branham's ministry that was to the lost it didn't mean everybody was lost it just means that now he was preaching to people who were never going to receive it so he said it i i could we could pull quote after quote after quote they don't have anything in them to believe with so now the third poll is now going to take on its second voice and that's the message to the elect so the the seals come that's the opening of the book the second part of his vision the first part is he descended into hell and jesus descended we didn't read that scripture but he descended into hell and preached to the lost so he descended in hell and preached the lust now verb said this is the third pole it's here it's on the third pole i'm going to go preach to a bunch of people that never will be saved they never will accept it they're lost but now there's another part he points out and this is we're going to just go into this part of it because it's the part that i i want you to grab a hold of this church will never amount to anything as long as they get this idea that we're all christians we are not all christians we are direct descendants of the kinsmen we have the gene seed of god in us we have a gene just like brother brandt preaches it over and over again but it means more to me this morning he said you got your gene like your father your mother same thing with god amen that's right you are direct descendant so now he starts his ministry to the lost but now there's another voice that's to the elect to a certain group of people that's going to be able to understand a certain language because they're made not to reason but to believe it amen now let's read this next paragraph so i want to understand we saw this part that's still going on you're preaching to the lost how many people do you share it with them it's right so bold flesh plain to them and you're trying to get it in their mind but there's somebody else battling for that mind the minute you leave there's somebody else there there's somebody that's going to bring that temptation that's going to walk in with that six-pack it's going to walk him with that drugs that's going to you know give you free movie tickets or whatever you know what i mean because there's a war going on there's a battle going on and then brother ben preaches a sermon called the uncertain sound what's he doing he's separating he's separating those that won't accept it and separating those that will hear it because people are dropping like flies in the second poll he can't even find a place to preach the businessmen have got rid of them if it wasn't for carl williams he'd hardly have anything then in phoenix a few of the pentecostal churches still wanted to have them because they were so dead and so we had so little works and so little power of the holy spirit moving that they wanted him in his midst so he's preaching to the lost that's what he said i'm back in hell again isn't my ministry just the same as his i'm going to be preaching to the lost and everybody said oh my kids aren't saved nobody's saved no because they didn't hear the second voice that's what he said he first came to bind up the brokenhearted but the second part of his meme was to bring judgment you notice he said 40 years that's the time that's the number of judgment so now i'm here to bring judgment so now he's here he's opening the seals now from the seals there's a voice the third pole the other side of the third pole the other voice of the third pole and that's to the elect now let's read this beautiful paragraph before we move on but look at the one that went last amen there's no more no more and more mercy it was all over then all over at that time that third messenger went down there the third pole what was he what kind of ministry did he have he sat with the elect and told them what was taking place behind him that's right so the other part of the third poll was sitting with the elect and that's what we want to move to now i want you to totally understand that from that time on the church world had rejected him he was his message was not being received by the multitudes his days of being the good rabbi with the healing was over he finally took the whoop out he finally called them a snake of the vipers he finally started cleaning out their churches telling me what was to come in that you're going to move away from the word of god you're going to move into total apostasy you're going to organize you're going to take creeds and dogmas and you're going to take the mark of the beast all the third paul that ministry's still going today but let's look just for a few moments this morning just think you can go home and take a nap let's just read a few very few statements to the elect at the end of christ the mystery of god revealed brother abraham's preaching now we're looking back at some of this from history but we're looking back at the source of prophecy okay so just like jesus said search the scriptures so we're looking back at the prophecy so we can see why our footsteps have been ordered to this time and this place and this understanding of god's word now today you've got you guys have got to decide whether you're a part of this message or not but let me tell you about your careers i think the brother mike brought it into this thing it'll all be taken away it's all going to perish the only thing that lasts is what's eternal i don't know why god put it there but he put eternal life in me in the beginning your name is put on the lamb's book of life nothing can put it on nothing can take it off now there's a message a voice of the third pull to the elect i'm going to just read i know i'm not a good reader but i hope this is a blessing this is in why christ speak paragraph 32 from the source that i took it from but not all the things that are published have the same paragraph numbers but he says what a lesson what a lesson oh my at this stage of the journey where we're standing look where we're at now yes sir at the third poll notice we're right here at the door of the coming of the lord he was anointed for the job and still waited for thus saith the lord god must have had enough of it he said don't cry anymore speak i send you now he says we're just at the door or we've just come to the third pool so there's going to be a change right he's now he's asked to do something he's asked to accept what god made him he's asked to accept the authority that god had given them and to move on with it it's going to cost them everything right he said i got to the place i could watch people go off at the cliff and then god dealt with them he understands i'm preaching to the lost but he also knew there was somebody else that he had to give the message of the third pull too because he's getting it and remember in everything happens in prophecy before you can get it it has to be revealed to his servant the prophet first and then he gives it out in a way that can't be understood only believed he gives it out in a way in fact his mouth was even shaped in a way that he could speak the words the way he spoke them that only the elect could receive it that's how special you are praise the lord he who have ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches so now he's experiencing it now he had the vision when the seventh seal was opened he refers to it and now he's coming back he understands i'm preaching to the lost but he knew there was another group he knew that his voice now was only going to those whose names were written on the lamb's book of life who understood his language because they were direct offsprings i was at brother lynette stefan's the other day and i accused him of trying to turn me into a romanian because he feeds me so much romanian food you know i i drive down the road and my truck automatically pulls out in front of his house because i know when you go through those doors you're gonna eat well you are what you eat right so now he's got third pool food for the elect because he's going to turn them in to something. let's just read on he was anointed for the job don't christ speak oh what this church ought to be this morning with god's perfect vindication with the pillar of fire and the signs and wonders and everything just like it was in the days of sodom he said it would return back just like it was when the gospel was being preached to the law and we could go down and read i'll just skip down to the paragraph 239 speak to the people and let's go forward amen we've got an objective that's glory let's move to it we're heading to the promised land all things are possible to them that believe speak to the people haven't i proved it haven't i even had my picture made among you and everything else and done everything that could be done to prove that i am with you how many of us are going forward in life knowing that god's with us and if god be for us who can stand against us doesn't the magazine just a few weeks ago packed the article when you said they're at the pulpit it would take place out here and three months beforehand and went and taken place and vindicated even the science knows about it every they've done you're still waiting we're still waiting waiting for what waiting for a revival waiting for an infilling waiting for a move of the spirit and we get ministry after ministry trying to pump us up no there's a voice of the third pole to you they rejected it but he kept preaching he kept going in there he kept healing their sick he kept doing signs and wonders he preached the rapture he preached things that are to be he preached so many fabulous messages in those churches in those in those full gospel businessmen at home where in jeffersonville he was preaching but he knew one thing the last part of his ministry was to the lost you say well what about us you were part of the opening of the seventh seal because your name was on that book of life and when he took that book that's why john wept because nobody could open that book all of god's elected were in that book and were revealed at the time of the opening of that book in seven seals no matter when your baby's born congratulations because god's what eternal and if you had eternal life you always had eternal life so what what what so the third pole now becomes he's preaching to the lost that can't be saved now the third poll becomes him preaching to a people so that they could come to the revelation of their eternal part they can come to the revelation of their eternity he says he speaks of it he says speak to the people and go forward to your objective and here's that quote brother tim you must not have read this too long ago god give me courage to take that sword of the word that you put in my hand 33 years ago and hold it and march forward to the third pull is my prayer so now the the third poll is now the the the third poll is something that now is going to take place in brother phantom's ministry that he's now going to deliver to the elect that because they're the only ones that are going to be able to take possession of this message another the third pole message is not a history lesson it's the revelation of an inheritance that the elect is elected to possess and have the same spirit that was in christ jesus dwelling in your mortal body but it's going to take something and the third poll is given to create that something within us may i read a few more statements are you okay just think of your bed in an hour now i'm looking for something to happen to start that third pull in the mark and maybe next sunday morning healing service may it produce that i don't know so he's looking for this third pull to start a different attitude a different revelation a different take on the word of god why because it had come a whole brand new book to him this is something that they've all rejected you notice i just think it's so thin the third pull in the mark you know prophets don't say things mark of the what this third poll is going to take place within the mark of the beast it's going to take place not in churches it's in people he goes on this paragraph 29 of humble thy cell he says no yes he says i think for us to do would be to tell your people get the sick people now for healing service we got to concentrate on sick people get your sick people and get them here early next sunday say about 8 30 and we'll let them give them prayer cards and come in the door however they do it and and then we'll have a prayer line and pray for the sick and just see what the holy spirit will do i believe you'll do wonders if we will just believe him but we've got to believe him for that now with all our hearts i think that the great hour has arrived that when god in so much as we was speaking this morning and show us so much and brought us to a certain just up to a spot just to push us over the hill and that's all we need then away it goes it's going just like it was the same thing with the sermon the same thing with the prophetic so he's saying i just preached this and it's it's brought up we're up to that place now so you realize that you may have come into this message at different times that's because god's new you and when he gave you the message he didn't give you a new message he didn't give you a second hand message he stored up the food for you personally and if you're not listening to it and you're not reading it and you're not studying it and you just come here to get a little temporary stimulation i pity you i pity you because you're living below your privilege to be fortified with the saith the lord is what the believer lives for this is also from now we're pulling it together now as the elect i was thinking here of one little illustration this is paragraph 74 of humble thyself if our paragraphs line up i don't know if they can find that or there it is right there beautiful i was thinking here of one little illustration to back up what he said now we look at this watch to find out what time it is let this sink in church unless every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other you'll never know the correct time is that right and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pull really do something for god it's coordination with every one of us together to humble ourselves before god and confess our wrongs and pray and believe for these things i'd like to read further paragraph 76 and there's there's many things in between but i don't want to i do want to keep you as long as i can honesty is the first sign my honesty gets me in trouble you know it's hard for me to have someone lie to me and me not say you're lying i'll say it sweet but it still gripes them and god can only operate as we let him operate now okay now get it get it he's offering us the third poll all right that's what he's doing he's offering us the third poll he understands part of it's to the lost but now he understands that there's another charge of faith coming and this bride is going to have to be con coordinated together he preaches a message called uniting time and sign they're uniting their organizing they're taking the mark of the beast but there's a bride an elect lady who's going to take the word or take the third pull message there's two voices one to the lost one to the elect same message one produces doubt and damnation jesus said then that belief shall be saved then that don't believe are damned all ready only only as we let him operate and there are so many wonderful things that i say you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what what goes with it the way up is down always you want power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than a man that runs all over the building and makes a lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself who is your own worst enemy conquering yourself is always the struggle lord help me with my unbelief and commit yourself to christ you'll see to humble yourself before him that's real power show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogant a church that sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has favor and power of god in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us you don't have to make a lot of noise let's move on and then of course you know that he he goes on to speak here i'd like to read this statement may there come forth a revival this is the indictment paragraph i believe it's 3 90 1 or 2. may they come forth a revival of the just and a great power come among the church just before it's going it's hard to pray that because you promised it it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and lord looking lord for that third pull that we know that will do great things for us in our midst now that's to the elect this is the other side of the voice the third pulls to the lost he's preaching to the people that have no chance of being saved the only people that have a chance of being saved are those who are saved already but they don't know it they don't accept it they don't accept their election they don't accept who they are they don't accept their forgiveness they let the world tempt them in everything they have worldly pursuits seek ye first the kingdom of god and god will add everything to you this is from christ the mystery of god reveal not knowing of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this god knows it but if you turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the end of the second pull the third pole is at hand so we're saying this because there's a part of the third pole that's for the elect and that's what we want to get what is it we're going to close up here in just a second how can i overcome he says he said now if you know any people around anywhere that's sick and wants to be prayed for bring them here tonight if you have to bring them anyway get them here that's the main thing bring them here tonight we all meet together it's hard to make calls go places after place then you leave off someone there's hard feelings but if you can get them all in one place then i could pray for them now if the people want to be prayed for you say will that you say will they oh certainly they'll be prayed for bring them on in the lord willing we will pray for everyone because i feel that third pull is beginning to move you see within me i want to pray for everybody so he's going through now he's sensing what the third pole is it's something that's going to move within him people we they went through because in the early stages of it when he had the vision he saw the tent he saw the room he saw the pillar of fire and he he he still couldn't quite get it because it's got to be revealed to him it's got to be unfolded to him he begins to see the seals and the opening of that word and then he begins to attach that to the vision of the third pole and then he moves past that and he talks about something that's taking place something that's happening something that's moving something that's going to be uh uh really for the individual and then let us just read these last few statements to you to see if we can grab a greater understanding i think i'll go ahead and go back this is perfect faith paragraph 64. now brother ben is going to tie these quotes in to the third paul at the end of the book so there's a part of this voice that's to you you can have this faith you can have this power you can have the ability to know who you are know that you possess the word and know that the word will do exactly what it promised to do we are partakers of divine nature by exceedingly great and precious promises so when a believer can take the promise know he has the authority to have that promise no that promise is to him a possession and he's not sitting there waiting for thus saith the lord so to speak because he's already got the saith the lord because it's the word and he can take that word because he's got the character to take that word and he can perform the functions of that word that was committed to him as a son and daughter of god or her oh just think of where we are we're sitting down studying in the message and not making it flesh we're looking back at everything brother madam random seconds that it's vindicated because he did it he vindicated that he had the possession of it there are certain parts of his ministry that are particular to that ministry but faith and believing every promise of god's word is for every believer and that's what he came to do he came back to restore the word of god amen thank you lord so it's the whole purpose of the third pull the lost weren't going to receive it but it was going to be made flesh in the elect now let's read here if we could and let's start at paragraph 63. now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power i give you power and they had power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them now we're talking the third poll we're talking about the part that's to the elect if they have the faith if they have the power the word they have the faith in he says they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them notice this pentecost always is talking about getting the power getting the power getting the power it's a revival of an idea they have in their mind of an old power that the church had that power was not given because the pillar of fires has they were endued with power from on high but what that power was was christ in them that's what they got in the upper room i will not leave you comfortless but i'll be with you even in you that's how they knew the power was there because they knew he was there and oh how we could go into the teaching of the anointing being the outside and the ring falls oh you just start seeing everything that brother brahms saying you you just go wow okay they didn't have effect that was in them you see what i mean but jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen oh bring them here how long will i suffer with you now jesus had what faith this haunted the people brother brown was preaching to because they think he's a pre-existing second person they don't understand he's a man that received a baptism and that you could be baptized with the same baptism hang in there younger people this is just an old fellow he said he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing myself why he relied upon what he was he relied knowing that he was the word and he that had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and they was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and there every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was now third poll therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god made us as believers now so this is what so now brother graham's coming back he gets this revelation and why christ speak i'm made this way i'm not going to doubt anymore i'm going to go forward i'm not going to let those unbelievers bring me down anymore i'm not going to let them talk me out of it i'm not going to let them criticize my ministry i'm not letting me be jealous of my nature i'm done letting them affect me i'm going to have faith in what god made me i'm going to go deliver the third pool to the elect because they're lost and you can put the messenger to sleep they all said oh god took him no he went to sleep because he had delivered the third pool to the elect that was going to transform them if he did that then can't we rely upon what god made us as believers these signs shall fall then that believe had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you're a believer if you've got faith in god the bible said over here if our hearts condemn us not then we have faith but if our hearts condemn us then we we have faith we have confidence towards god if you want to read that follow in john 3 21 the scripture is written down so he's talking about this beautiful wonderful third poll i gotta find out where this is at here i got a paragraph mark down here i don't know if it's necessary yes go to paragraph 114 perfect faith and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ now we're getting into bride material see we're getting in to rapturing condition so you so the third pole has a substance to it or if i could say this a revelation that's going to empower the church to get them in to rapturing condition they're not trying to reproduce an age gone by i read the quotes we're on a journey we've got something to accomplish we've got a goal in mind we're working towards a rapture speak to the people and move on so now the third pull if you could tie it into another message the third exodus it's a message calling the people out of the unbelief into the reception of the power of the resurrection not manifested in a bunch of noise but manifested in a perfect faith in the heart that they are those whose name is written on the lamb's book of life hard to believe it isn't it brother the old mind just and why did he choose you i don't know i would have never picked you but he did he didn't have to but he did wait a minute i look he did i did he did who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect because the seed of god remaineth in him he's god's it's his gene he said that your first husband calls you to do that he's totally divorced he's dead in other words i killed him i mean substitute he's isolated from the entire world because he's a new teacher in christ there is now you're getting into bride material you're getting in a rapturing condition that means for he says that means for each one of us not just the pastor now deacons trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone that's a tough cookie to swallow because we love groups we love protection we love sitting under popular ministries because we feel there's a safety there but this third poll empowers you as an individual you're baptized into a kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god see he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you're walking right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are mistakes to others my note there says the third poll now paragraph 177 i see just how advanced my church is on what we believe in see just how advanced the people are how they're they're ready to take the sword and walk out in front line and say i challenge you satan i challenge you you can't make me disbelieve anymore what are what are these things done for so the people will believe it's the word it's where that shows that i am preaching to you the truth the word the word was made flesh made flesh in you made word made live in you made life in you made life in me that's the voice that's the other voice one voice is to the lost the other voice is to you and he finally draws this in conclusion on paragraph 84 and this is what he says this is coming into that third poll he gives all these explanations of perfect faith and he says now this is that coming in to the third pole this is what it is it's that perfect faith that's accepting who you are is accepting that you're elected it's understanding that this voice that's rejected by the world even those that use the feast with us has gone out from us and they've become spots and wrinkles on our feast but you know it's to you i totally accept that this message was for me why did he say that the other voice of that third poll was to the unbeliever and they're totally lost so you would quit listening to them don't listen you're special you're elected how beautiful shall we neglect such a great salvation i'm pleading with you this morning take courage saints get on fire understand who you are understand how important you are understand what you possess let's don't be defeated this is that this is coming into the third poll he just preaches perfect faith he says this is coming in to the third pole i'm believing it now i want to ask you sincerely a question you that pass through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that there is something happened in you since you've had hands laid on you raise your hand there it is that's what we've waited for this is just the start starting to bloom now just start this is for a purpose i did this for a purpose i'm working out something i'm taking this charge of faith and going right back to the beginning and come in see a kind a to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before not faith but perfect faith built up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword discerning the thoughts of the of the heart what were coming now into the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into perfect rapturing faith i'm looking for it it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god a wonderful understanding that we're in the third poll really what it is really what it was it was brother branham coming to the place where he had to receive a new faith a perfect faith a perfect understanding of his ministry then he could go forth and say it's not for everybody why would he look at a people and say they don't have anything in them to believe with you know why he knew he was preaching to the lost but he knew you were there he knew you would hear and he knew if you were one of his that there was another voice in the third poll that was to you that was going to empower you with not a bunch of noise but with a solid peace in god's word that every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line i feel different i feel i've got life i feel i have the word of god living in me i'm not what i was i'm not what i want to be but i'm not what i used to be and i know that the word of god is working in me bringing me to perfection because i've heard the second voice or i've heard the other voice of the third poll to the elect you have a wonderful afternoon and enjoy your day no service tonight communion next sunday and we'll be back on our regular schedule pray for the meetings coming up we have a few guests coming and and uh you know so we know we can tighten up a little bit if we have to believe it or not we've taken four pews out of the sanctuary so we'll do something but anyway pray god's moving he's accomplishing very very many things and i'm looking forward to hearing more testimonies like we heard today and that quiet way that god works remember he said the third poll wouldn't be a show it's that mystic place where he meets the believer in there with that word and that believer takes that promise and they know it's his and they live by it and nobody can talk them out of it don't be ashamed of a lost world he preached to him they know his message they twist his message they say it means this they say it means that they say he was taken for this reason he was taken for that reason but isn't it amazing he says they can put me to sleep but my message is going to live on my third pull is going to be manifested it'll be manifested in the lost and it will be manifested in the elected settle it in your heart your election settle it quit fighting that fight it's already been one for you if you've heard the elect voice of the second poll it's because you're elected if you disbelieve it it's because you're an unbeliever the voice to the lost the voice to the elect choose this day which voice you will serve as for me and my house will serve the voice of the elect god bless you qff oh there's never been a day like this [Music] this glory [Music] this

branham would talk about lord how the eagle flew over the chicken yard lord when we think about each of us that we're in of the world or maybe dibbling dabbling out in things lord and you felt the need to send the message forth lord there's even been one some of us lord that have had a testimony that the person that witnesses to us maybe was just a carrier maybe not even serving the lord maybe not even having a full revelation of what this message was lord but you saw fit to bring it by our way lord i thank you for dealing with brother david the way you dealt with him today lord we know there's always two voices pulling on us lord and lord one is lifting us up and showing us the things in the word and showing us this message and revealing it to our heart lord and there's another one that's speaking to a dying world that's cast in judgment though we pray that we may be lifted up lord in your word and we'll see what you have fit for us lord may we be maybe those that are studying this word lord those that are seeking what you have for us lord you use the the voice of the prophet to speak to us the lord behind the scenes and give us revelation of the things that we have need of lord may it not just maybe not look at it as a miss and dismiss it when you're dealing with our hearts and speaking things to us may we give our whole life to this message and to this word we thank you for we commit all things into your hands we ask these things in jesus name amen amen don't forget about the youth choir practice right after service and also to get with one of the deacons and if you'd like to help with either hosting or or getting the casserole ready so please make sure you let one of the deacons know amen oh every promise in the book is mine [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is
