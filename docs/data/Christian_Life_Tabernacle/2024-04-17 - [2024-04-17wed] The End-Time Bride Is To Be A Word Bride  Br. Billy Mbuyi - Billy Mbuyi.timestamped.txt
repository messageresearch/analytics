[39:34] going to open it in Zachariah we're
[39:37] going to read a a scripture in Zachariah
[39:50] 14 um let's start from verse 5 and it
[39:53] says and ye shall flee to the valley of
[39:57] the
[39:58] mountains for the Valley of the
[40:01] mountains shall reach unto AEL y ye
[40:05] shall flee as ye flee from before the
[40:10] earthquakes in the days of usza the king
[40:12] of
[40:13] Judah and the Lord my God shall come and
[40:18] all the saints with thee it shall come
[40:21] to pass in that day that the light shall
[40:24] not be clear nor dark
[40:28] but it shall be one day which shall be
[40:31] known of the Lord neither day nor night
[40:35] but it shall come to pass that at the
[40:38] evening time it shall be light and it
[40:41] shall be that in that day that Living
[40:45] Waters shall go out from Jerusalem half
[40:49] of them towards the Eastern Sea and half
[40:52] towards the hinder sea in the summer and
[40:55] in the winter shall it be and the Lord
[40:57] shall be king over all the Earth in that
[41:02] day and in that day shall there be one
[41:05] Lord and and his name one our gracious
[41:10] father we ask that you bless your word
[41:11] to us in the name of Jesus Christ we
[41:13] pray amen God bless you may have your
[41:15] seats
[41:31] just want to speak for a moment TR
[41:34] say we don't have a clock like we used
[41:36] to be
[41:39] so um but we're going to make sure we
[41:42] don't take too long and just ch as much
[41:44] time probably need to buy a clock and
[41:46] put it in the
[41:50] bag
[41:52] um just want to speak for a moment is
[41:55] just a thought that was was on my heart
[41:58] that I've been looking at
[42:00] and um and I want to title it for the
[42:04] sake of just framing our mind and and
[42:06] getting us into one mind uh the end time
[42:10] bride is to be a word bride the end time
[42:14] bride is to be a word bride but will
[42:19] speak and in Zachariah as we read it
[42:22] says in that day it shall be day or
[42:25] night neither day neither night uh but
[42:28] Ram says it's going to be a foggy day he
[42:30] calls it uh which we can understand from
[42:35] the description that is given in the
[42:38] scripture about the time that we live in
[42:41] it would speak about a day of confusion
[42:44] a day of deception where uh even things
[42:48] that people say don't really hold the
[42:51] wait you know it used to be a time where
[42:54] someone if someone said I'm a Christian
[42:56] it me something it meant something now
[42:59] everybody's a Christian it's just been
[43:02] so watered down it doesn't mean much
[43:04] anymore and it's a time we live in as we
[43:08] speak we look at the scripture I I was
[43:11] even thinking about it this afternoon
[43:13] the day of artificial intelligence what
[43:16] we call AI you you see a picture of
[43:19] someone but it's a fake
[43:21] person that person doesn't exist at all
[43:24] is a is a computer made of of someone's
[43:27] imagination of how they like the person
[43:30] to look you see a a a picture of someone
[43:33] online you're like and then you met the
[43:35] person they nothing compared to what you
[43:38] saw online why because everybody's fake
[43:42] nobody is real nothing is real
[43:45] everything is fake uh it says it's not
[43:48] so much what you claim to be to say you
[43:51] are because everybody can claim anything
[43:55] uh people that have no job experience
[43:57] you go online my goodness they have a
[43:59] resume that's filled a 100 pages and
[44:02] they are a CEO of a company that only
[44:05] him and his wife
[44:06] run it's it's a day that just doesn't
[44:09] make any sense as the scripture will say
[44:12] so much confusion so much uh fakeness
[44:15] just being projected and and the Bible
[44:18] will say it's a day of a fallen away
[44:22] where many will live even the very Faith
[44:25] a day where the condition of men is such
[44:28] uh they are so lukewarm and they're
[44:31] mixing and there's a day where it's hard
[44:34] to find something that's actually
[44:36] original to find people that are
[44:38] original that are who God made them to
[44:41] to be and uh people that that are
[44:43] satisfied with just being what they
[44:46] are everybody's trying to add to what
[44:49] they are everybody is trying to change
[44:51] what they are men are wanting to be
[44:53] women women are wanting to be
[44:55] men nobody is satisfi with what was in
[44:58] the original to begin with there's so
[45:01] much fakeness people really and and you
[45:04] look in the church realm uh it seems yet
[45:08] we are on Wednesday night and and you
[45:11] think about the numbers that was here
[45:13] Sunday morning you wonder where is
[45:17] everybody the the the the enemy it is
[45:21] such about with destruction and and and
[45:24] so much uh uh busyness of life you got
[45:27] to get this done you got to get that and
[45:28] that done and he it's so saturated
[45:32] there's not a moment that you you don't
[45:34] have anything that needs to be done
[45:37] every moment is
[45:39] occupi if you have 10 minutes there's
[45:41] enough to do in 10 minutes if you only
[45:44] have five the devil has got enough for
[45:46] you to do in that five
[45:49] minute it's the age where people have a
[45:53] passive attitude we would say where they
[45:56] they just seem to be uh uh just relaxed
[45:59] and there's no fervency or need and now
[46:02] remember the BAM speaks about they say
[46:05] it says what what we are waiting for
[46:07] it's not for God to do something more
[46:10] God is waiting upon you and I to get
[46:12] ready for the
[46:15] Rapture in fact it speaks about it I
[46:18] believe in the uh uh evangelism in the
[46:21] end time the end time it says the end
[46:23] time message is not so we can have great
[46:26] great campaign and have so many field
[46:29] the building and all of those things no
[46:31] the end time message and the end time
[46:34] evangelism is the Gathering of the stone
[46:37] that were
[46:38] predestinated the Gathering is the
[46:40] chipping is the the will say it's the
[46:43] forming of the stone that would fit the
[46:45] building that God has been
[46:49] building so we find out it's a lukewarm
[46:52] time and he would say the prophet will
[46:54] say and we know that Civilization travel
[46:57] from east to west the older civilization
[47:01] we know we have is China and it says
[47:04] civilization has traveled from east to
[47:07] west it says it's become uh uh because
[47:10] it follows the Sun and now we have
[47:13] gotten all the way to the West Coast and
[47:16] if we go further we'll go back again
[47:18] East see so we are at the end of the
[47:22] road so now that's something we need to
[47:25] be uh uh brought to at this same time
[47:28] that we are living in this is the end of
[47:30] the road there's not another age to come
[47:33] in fact it says one place it says if you
[47:35] look at civilization when it started off
[47:38] it came and as it was traveling all
[47:41] across what it did is it picks up all
[47:44] the scene along the path that when
[47:46] civilization get at the very end it's
[47:49] worse than when it
[47:52] started it said America they used to go
[47:55] to Europe and them and to get uh models
[47:58] and and and and and all the kinds of
[48:00] things and fashion now it's at the it's
[48:02] at the West that they come to find
[48:05] it and you find out it's the same and if
[48:08] you look at it it's the very type of the
[48:10] church yes's the church is started off
[48:12] on fire and everything andam says the
[48:15] first thing that went out was the love
[48:17] that they had they forgot the first love
[48:19] and then you come at the end time Christ
[48:22] is found on the
[48:25] outside so we are at the end we can't
[48:28] keep going in the same direction that we
[48:30] are going and it says and here is the
[48:33] world in its condition and there's
[48:35] Nation it says there's a nation and it
[48:38] and its condition there's a woman in its
[48:41] condition there's a man in its condition
[48:43] there's the church in its condition
[48:45] there's everything the elements the
[48:48] signs flying flying sourcers and
[48:51] everything in the sky and all kinds of
[48:53] mysterious things they says they are um
[48:57] sea roaring and and tide waves and men's
[49:00] hearts are failing and fear and perplex
[49:03] of time and distress between nations and
[49:06] churches are
[49:08] failing that's the world that we live in
[49:12] that's the condition that Zachariah is
[49:15] saying that it shall come a time where
[49:17] there will be no day it's not going to
[49:19] be a day or night and it's going to be a
[49:22] dismal day it's going to be a foggy day
[49:24] it's going to be all kind of time but he
[49:26] says but in the evening time there shall
[49:28] be
[49:29] light that day is only known of the Lord
[49:33] but in the evening time of that day they
[49:35] shall be
[49:37] light and butam will say in the message
[49:41] the Seas is not air with a shack it says
[49:43] the world is in Sodom condition and the
[49:46] church has went into Sodom with it with
[49:49] lot and his wife and I say there's an
[49:53] elected church somewhere in the world
[49:56] that's pulling out set aside from those
[49:59] things and the manifestation of God has
[50:02] attracted his attention we are in the
[50:04] last day oh I want to say I'm thankful
[50:07] because the manifestation of this light
[50:11] the manifestation that is talked about
[50:13] has attracted my attention I'm here
[50:15] because my attention has been attracted
[50:18] by a prophet messenger I have heard the
[50:21] evening I have seen the evening light I
[50:23] have heard the evening messenger that's
[50:25] why I'm sitting here tonight
[50:27] I'm not here by help and chance I'm not
[50:29] here because I wanted to be here I'm
[50:31] here because there's a seed word of God
[50:33] in my life that's calling for me to come
[50:36] out of the lysia come out of the things
[50:38] of the world come out of all those
[50:40] things and come unto me my
[50:44] people he says the Shar has given forth
[50:47] his strength into the seed it says they
[50:50] went out it was a good shock but it
[50:53] served its purpose see the word Bride of
[50:57] the word groom I like that it's just not
[51:01] any bride it's the word prde of the word
[51:04] groom if the groom is the word the bride
[51:07] has to be the word otherwise they cannot
[51:10] be a union if the bride cannot is not a
[51:13] full word it cannot have a union why
[51:16] because the the bridegroom or the
[51:18] bridegroom is a full word so has to be
[51:21] the
[51:23] bride and I love this in evening
[51:27] messenger I want you to hear this this
[51:28] is the prophet speaking paragraph 81 he
[51:32] says this is this this is repeating each
[51:36] time through the Bible we find out that
[51:39] it's in the sacred scripture all the way
[51:42] through that just at the ending of all
[51:45] of an old age that the new one comes in
[51:49] so now the prophet is trying to uh uh
[51:51] show us even when you you you you line
[51:54] up the ages he will say so one age will
[51:58] end and it's not a an Abrupt end but it
[52:01] says it is into another one but and then
[52:05] he says but in at every End of the Age
[52:08] the messenger doesn't come at the
[52:09] beginning but it comes at the end of
[52:11] every age so it says at every age uh we
[52:15] find out that a sacred scripture all the
[52:17] way through that at the end of the old
[52:19] age the new one comes in it says that
[52:22] age Fades out into the new age comes in
[52:25] and God sends a message
[52:28] messenger now listen to this it says and
[52:33] and and and as always every time that
[52:36] messenger comes it always comes back it
[52:39] always it's always a call back to the
[52:42] word never fails remember this is the
[52:46] complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:48] there cannot be nothing added to it or
[52:51] taken from it it's a complete revelation
[52:54] of Jesus Christ the only way
[52:57] that we can ever be sure says if
[53:00] anything Rises Among Us that's contrary
[53:04] to the Revelation then it's wrong see
[53:07] it's back to the word and it's always
[53:11] calling back oh I thought about it I
[53:14] said in every age thank you yes God will
[53:17] send when when he's sending his word to
[53:20] his people it's always the call to come
[53:22] back to his word why why people fail
[53:25] because they walk away from the word why
[53:27] are we in the condition that we are in
[53:29] because we walked away from the word the
[53:31] first age walked away from the word when
[53:34] the messenger comes is only one thing
[53:36] come back to the word it's not a secret
[53:39] it's not magic it's the same program of
[53:42] God and God's word is the program of God
[53:46] it's always returned back to the word I
[53:48] want to say this this morning if you
[53:50] have a need to this tonight you got to
[53:52] come back to the word I'm sick come back
[53:55] to the word I I don't feel right come
[53:58] back to the word why because the word is
[54:00] the answer to
[54:03] everything God has never changed his
[54:05] program from the first CH Church age
[54:08] till now why he only got one program The
[54:11] Promised word for your age what the
[54:13] moment you recognize the promised age
[54:16] that the promised word that is given for
[54:18] your age the better you are off why
[54:21] because you would understand that in
[54:23] that promised word God has given
[54:25] everything that you have have need
[54:27] of amen that's good you bet slide come
[54:31] back to the word you need a job come
[54:34] back to the where what's going to save
[54:36] us from our challenges God has provided
[54:38] a word that can bring us out of those
[54:43] challenges so he says it's come back to
[54:47] the word it's back to the world is
[54:49] always it says is and always calling
[54:54] back that's the promise the promise was
[54:57] that there shall be light in the evening
[54:59] time oh my God God's way of doing things
[55:05] is always to send a prophet
[55:09] messenger we we heard it from our pastor
[55:12] last
[55:13] Sunday it said
[55:16] God as it's written in Amos he cannot do
[55:20] anything unless he Reveals His secret to
[55:22] his Prophet the servant the prophet and
[55:26] oh my I don't I don't I don't even think
[55:28] I have enough time to go this if we can
[55:30] just look at what a prophet is and what
[55:33] it represent we we just don't have
[55:35] enough time but I want to just say this
[55:38] what because God we chose by the way of
[55:43] a prophet for him to bring forth his
[55:45] word the prophet says this in the in the
[55:48] evening messenger says now God always
[55:51] uses a prophet
[55:53] aen and if you use a bunch of men you
[55:56] get different
[55:58] ideas I like
[56:01] that I like that you know a man can have
[56:05] a vision if I don't see that Vision
[56:08] there's two things I can do I can either
[56:11] argue with him and say it's not true or
[56:13] I can line up and just believe that God
[56:15] spoke to him and I'll
[56:17] follow there's only two way out of it so
[56:21] God doesn't use a group of people that's
[56:24] why I I I Marvel people come and they
[56:27] get into the message and they begin to
[56:29] tell you exactly how to position what
[56:31] the prophet said and how that the
[56:34] prophet changed and evolved and how that
[56:36] the prophet it was God that spoke to him
[56:39] he didn't speak to you and if there was
[56:41] anything that God wanted to change he
[56:43] was going to use that same Prophet to
[56:45] change it it was not going to come to
[56:47] you well and and let me say this it's
[56:50] the way of God of doing things to reveal
[56:53] his word to one man yes it's always been
[56:56] one in the day of Moses he used one man
[56:59] in every age God uses a man by which he
[57:02] would reveal himself to and let me say
[57:04] this when God calls that one man that
[57:07] man is Vindicated by God
[57:12] himself and and I was just thinking
[57:14] about it when we speak about vindication
[57:17] now remember the prophet tells us that
[57:19] the way of a true Prophet is always to
[57:22] remain with God's word with the word so
[57:24] when he he says if what speaks is the
[57:27] word of God then you believe
[57:30] him so in order for you to do that you
[57:33] have to have a record by which you can
[57:35] judge
[57:36] him right but now there's always there's
[57:39] also another way that the prophet said
[57:41] he would recognize a true prophet he
[57:44] says if what he speaks come to
[57:47] pass then you know he's speaking on
[57:50] behalf of God if what he speaks come to
[57:53] pass you have to say that this man is
[57:55] sent of God
[57:57] right he speaks and he says two men it
[58:00] says never did two major never did he
[58:03] have two major prophet on Earth at one
[58:06] time it takes one so that the other one
[58:09] can take its place for another day it
[58:12] says another messenger he never has two
[58:15] he has one at any
[58:18] time he says and the infinite God never
[58:22] changes his program we he says he must
[58:26] always stay with that stay with what he
[58:30] started with and the reason the and it
[58:33] says that's the reason we have
[58:35] confidence in what he says he cannot
[58:37] change he says if he save a man on the
[58:41] basis of his faith in God the next man
[58:45] will have to be saved the same
[58:50] way he stays with the
[58:53] word and and I in the moment just give
[58:56] you a moment as I'm laying my Foundation
[58:58] I think it's very important that the end
[59:02] time Bride is a word bride sure that's
[59:05] right and and we'll get to that in a
[59:07] moment it's very important so in order
[59:10] for God God's program to continue in the
[59:13] end time he has to send a prophet
[59:15] messenger and without and let me say
[59:18] this many hearers and said well I hear I
[59:23] don't believe he's a
[59:24] prophet now let me just said this when
[59:28] God sends a prophet it's a predestinated
[59:32] prophet for a predestinated
[59:37] people all it means is it's not your
[59:40] prophet he was not sent for
[59:43] you because only the elect remember a
[59:46] prophet is only sent to the elect he not
[59:49] sent to the whole world the whole world
[59:51] will hear him but some will deny some
[59:53] will reject him why would they deny
[59:56] because they don't have an instrument
[59:58] within themselves to receive the word of
[1:00:01] God by a prophet they think they have
[1:00:03] enough intelligence for them to open the
[1:00:05] Bible and they go go why because they
[1:00:08] they have been deceived by Lucifer they
[1:00:11] have been deceived by the devil that
[1:00:13] they can get a word without the
[1:00:16] prophet but those of the seed of God
[1:00:19] they have one understanding in fact they
[1:00:21] have been built in a way that when they
[1:00:24] hear the prophet when they hear the
[1:00:26] prophet he answers the questions in
[1:00:28] their
[1:00:29] life when they are in trouble they play
[1:00:32] the prophet he answers the question in
[1:00:34] their life when things don't go right
[1:00:36] all they need to do is hear the prophet
[1:00:39] yes and that settles
[1:00:41] everything because they know that God
[1:00:43] who spoke to that Prophet that same God
[1:00:46] is able to come and vindicate the things
[1:00:48] which you are
[1:00:50] hearing it's not because they have it
[1:00:52] figured out not because they can put two
[1:00:55] and two together they have one
[1:00:58] understanding that my heart longs to
[1:01:00] hear for this
[1:01:03] person they know within themselves that
[1:01:06] there is something that just calls for
[1:01:08] that word the more I hear it the more he
[1:01:12] just makes my life clear he makes the
[1:01:14] trouble that I'm going through just wor
[1:01:17] it everything I'm going through my the
[1:01:19] word of God just makes it worth it every
[1:01:22] time I'm in the challenge I go I read
[1:01:24] and I hear that Prophet messenger he
[1:01:26] speaks to me and I get an
[1:01:30] answer to
[1:01:32] others they'll find all kinds of errors
[1:01:35] all kinds of mistakes well he said two
[1:01:37] over here he says three over there he
[1:01:39] says five over there yeah but to the
[1:01:42] others to the elect the ears are tuned
[1:01:45] to only hear what God wants them to hear
[1:01:49] they don't see no fault they have an
[1:01:52] understanding heart everything it says
[1:01:54] makes sense to them even though they
[1:01:56] can't explain
[1:02:03] it
[1:02:05] so so the
[1:02:07] messenger this Prophet messenger that
[1:02:10] God
[1:02:11] sends is the only
[1:02:14] one
[1:02:16] responsible to calling the
[1:02:21] elect is the only one responsible in
[1:02:25] gathering ing the elect why because God
[1:02:29] knows that when he begins to sound of
[1:02:31] his message he says in in that time it
[1:02:35] says when the seventh angel messenger
[1:02:37] when he will begin to sound forth his
[1:02:40] message it says then there shall be time
[1:02:43] no more and he knows that when he begins
[1:02:45] to sound this message it's like that
[1:02:47] story that brother bam talks about the
[1:02:49] Gees they are here and when time comes
[1:02:51] for them to fly out he said all of the
[1:02:53] sudden one of them stands up all all of
[1:02:56] a sudden one of them in the group stands
[1:02:57] up and he began he says it's far
[1:03:01] away it's naturally impossible for him
[1:03:05] to know where he's going he was born
[1:03:08] there he was born there he's never been
[1:03:12] where he going but all of the sudden
[1:03:14] something rise up within him why because
[1:03:17] God is calibrating his life and God is
[1:03:19] molding him to be a leader and all of
[1:03:22] the sudden he hears the word of God and
[1:03:24] all of the sudden he's quick by the
[1:03:26] power of God and it begins to fly and
[1:03:28] all the rest of them they follow right
[1:03:32] you're like this is Perfect Insanity
[1:03:34] come on the leader doesn't know where
[1:03:37] he's going and everybody is following
[1:03:39] him why it's God's program of the
[1:03:43] nature God shows you in the nature so
[1:03:46] you can understand in the spiritual
[1:03:47] realm God is doing the same thing am
[1:03:51] true and it's only those that are
[1:03:54] predestinated to follow
[1:03:56] those will follow it's not made for
[1:04:00] everybody the message that is the
[1:04:03] prophet that that is to the prophet that
[1:04:06] a prophet has given has the food and the
[1:04:10] ingredient to call the elected people to
[1:04:13] others is foolishness to to them it's
[1:04:16] the food that their soul
[1:04:18] need it's the manner it's the fresh
[1:04:22] manner that they feed upon when they
[1:04:24] hear the word of God it satisfies the
[1:04:27] soul they hear they are in tune with the
[1:04:31] message they hear the message and it
[1:04:34] satisfies their soul why because their
[1:04:37] souls have been aligned to hear the word
[1:04:39] of God his voice answers the
[1:04:43] questions to what they have need of his
[1:04:46] voice is a satisfying voice his voice is
[1:04:50] the answer to all the trouble his voice
[1:04:53] makes more sense than anything
[1:04:56] his voice is the very word of God to the
[1:04:59] his music to their ears they want to
[1:05:02] hear it all the
[1:05:04] time why because they are a word
[1:05:10] bride because they are a word bride if
[1:05:14] they are not a word
[1:05:15] bride they'll be attracted to
[1:05:19] everything some will be attracted
[1:05:21] because of the energy in the
[1:05:24] building because of the music and the
[1:05:27] emotion and all of that but the word
[1:05:29] bride listens to that
[1:05:32] word and when they hear the word
[1:05:35] something just satisfy they come in with
[1:05:38] a burden and they go out free they come
[1:05:41] in with sin and they go out clean they
[1:05:44] come in with all kinds of stuff but they
[1:05:46] go all the burdens are lifted off why
[1:05:48] because I have heard from God I have
[1:05:51] heard from a prophet
[1:05:53] messenger let me say this the word word
[1:05:56] is the only relationship that exists
[1:05:58] between us and the
[1:06:00] prophet it's the only connecting element
[1:06:04] because we he's the word and we are the
[1:06:06] word therefore we are in
[1:06:12] relationship but whatam says
[1:06:15] this in the evening messenger paragraph
[1:06:18] 97 it says now we find out that God
[1:06:22] vindicates his
[1:06:23] word the prophets word and if he is a
[1:06:27] prophet then he's speaking according to
[1:06:29] the word it says and the Bible says in
[1:06:33] one place it says if they speak not
[1:06:36] according to the law and the prophets
[1:06:38] there's no light in
[1:06:42] them then call he
[1:06:45] says this is the messenger call out and
[1:06:48] the call out ones listen to this and the
[1:06:51] this is the messenger calls out the call
[1:06:54] out the called out ones he is right he
[1:06:59] is right by the word of God proves that
[1:07:03] is
[1:07:05] right he not proven by himself he proven
[1:07:09] by the word of God God proves that he's
[1:07:13] right I want to say
[1:07:15] this the
[1:07:17] revealing of the son of man Pam says
[1:07:22] this and specifically focusing on the
[1:07:25] time time that we live in we we
[1:07:28] understand in the scripture in Luke
[1:07:29] 17:26 to30 if we could read it quickly
[1:07:33] it says and as it was in the days of
[1:07:36] Noah it shall be and it says and it
[1:07:39] shall be also in the days of the son of
[1:07:42] man they did eat they drank they married
[1:07:45] wise and they were given into marriage
[1:07:48] until the day that Noah enter into the
[1:07:50] AR so that is one of the promises one of
[1:07:55] the characteristics of the time when the
[1:07:58] son of man will come it's compared to
[1:08:00] the time of Noah and then it says and
[1:08:03] then came the flood and destroyed all
[1:08:05] and then on 28th it said likewise also
[1:08:08] as it was in the days of lot so there's
[1:08:11] the time of lot and the time of Noah
[1:08:14] that's put together for the same age for
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:17] time it says they did eat they did they
[1:08:21] drank and they bought and they sold and
[1:08:23] they planted they build it it says
[1:08:25] but the same day that lot went into uh
[1:08:29] went out of Sodom it rains fire and
[1:08:31] brimstone from heaven and Destroy them
[1:08:33] all even thus shall it be in the days
[1:08:37] when the son of man is revealed but
[1:08:41] whatam say this in paragraph 101 of the
[1:08:43] evening messenger says there's three
[1:08:48] destructions want you to follow this
[1:08:51] close one of them when Noah went into
[1:08:54] the ark the second time when lot went
[1:08:57] out of Sodom so this is parallel
[1:09:00] speaking of the scripture we just read
[1:09:02] watch Jesus referred to them as it was
[1:09:05] in the day of Noah and as it was in the
[1:09:08] days of lot so shall it be in the time
[1:09:11] the in the coming of the son of man it
[1:09:13] says watch one went in the other came
[1:09:18] out and the next goes
[1:09:24] upall I want you to get that one goes in
[1:09:29] the other goes out the next goes up goes
[1:09:34] in comes out and goes up now that's the
[1:09:38] order of the Lord Jesus referred to them
[1:09:40] as two Prophet as it was in the day of
[1:09:42] Noah as it was in the days of L Abraham
[1:09:45] being the prophet and then so shall it
[1:09:47] be in in the in the in the days of the
[1:09:49] coming of the son of man see it refers
[1:09:52] back to them I want to say this we we we
[1:09:55] are the group that will go
[1:09:59] up we we we we we have we have come out
[1:10:02] of
[1:10:03] denominations we have went into Christ
[1:10:06] now it's the time to go up now we
[1:10:08] remember remember now now it was Enoch
[1:10:11] who lived at that time who went up there
[1:10:15] was those that went out and there was
[1:10:17] those that came in but that went into
[1:10:19] the ark but it was those that were
[1:10:22] promised that they will go up and I want
[1:10:24] to say this we say this there's not
[1:10:26] another age to come after us there's not
[1:10:29] another age that is to follow after us
[1:10:32] so therefore it's very important when we
[1:10:34] receive the evening messenger we have to
[1:10:36] know what was he sent to do butam says
[1:10:40] the evening message is to prepare you
[1:10:43] for
[1:10:45] Rapture the the evening message is not
[1:10:48] sent so we can go back in Pentecost the
[1:10:51] evening message is to send to move us
[1:10:54] forward yes to push us into the Rapture
[1:10:57] to push to move us to take us from this
[1:11:00] earth into the presence of God why the
[1:11:03] whole program of God is not so that he
[1:11:05] can keep people on Earth forever the
[1:11:07] main program started with God when men
[1:11:10] sin down and he came down on Earth God
[1:11:13] wanted to restore his people back into
[1:11:15] the Garden of Eden so he kept going and
[1:11:18] going and the purpose that he was
[1:11:20] working on is so that at the end he can
[1:11:22] restore people at the rightful place
[1:11:27] he says in the invisible union he
[1:11:33] says I'll skip some for the sake of
[1:11:37] time it
[1:11:40] says paragraph 10 uh 190 says and then
[1:11:44] the life that came out of denomination
[1:11:47] goes into the
[1:11:49] grain then what happened the grain began
[1:11:52] to grow paragraph 190 of the invest
[1:11:55] visible Union they began to go to get
[1:11:58] bigger and then he so he came to cover
[1:12:00] over something denomination pulled away
[1:12:02] from it he said you you said we we ain't
[1:12:06] get we ain't got a denomination out of
[1:12:09] this they never will he says it's the
[1:12:12] grain it can't go no further he says we
[1:12:16] are at the end time so what does it what
[1:12:19] what does it have to do now it says lay
[1:12:22] in the presence of the son to be ripen
[1:12:26] that's exactly he says the word to be
[1:12:29] ripened into your heart to bring forth
[1:12:32] and live what you are talking about yes
[1:12:35] sir it says then you are no longer you
[1:12:38] are you then you will have no more doubt
[1:12:40] if you let the Holy Spirit reveal it to
[1:12:43] you like the queen uh like the queen
[1:12:46] said unto about about Daniel it says so
[1:12:50] can we be thankful as Pilgrim like
[1:12:52] Abraham separate ourselves from the
[1:12:54] things of the the world and and all of
[1:12:56] our association Abraham was a pilgrim
[1:12:59] God separated God separated us from all
[1:13:03] the dead denomination I'm speaking
[1:13:05] Across the Nation now all dead
[1:13:09] Creeds and to what separate us to and
[1:13:13] open open to us a new land a new message
[1:13:17] for this day Pentecostal dried up listen
[1:13:21] to this Pentecostal dried up and die
[1:13:24] Luther Wesley and the rest of them it
[1:13:27] says no one none of it says it's no more
[1:13:31] it's no more than a bunch of of of
[1:13:33] churches pulled together God go it says
[1:13:36] good people in there but yet they've got
[1:13:38] to come out it says what did he what did
[1:13:41] he what did he do he open he opened up
[1:13:44] the Seven Seals of the last message he
[1:13:46] says you notice that the Seven Seals
[1:13:49] which all the mysteries of the seven
[1:13:51] Church Ages were sealed with the Seven
[1:13:54] Seals the reformer didn't have time to
[1:13:56] do in their days they didn't live long
[1:14:00] enough but this blessed revelation of
[1:14:02] the seven Sals it's open to us in this
[1:14:05] last day from a prophet that went forth
[1:14:09] from
[1:14:10] Arizona oh my we know where he came from
[1:14:14] we know what time that came about so we
[1:14:17] know it's in the age and the time that
[1:14:19] we are living in and let me skip a
[1:14:21] little bit for the sake of time
[1:14:22] paragraph 3:24 it says the word that
[1:14:25] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[1:14:28] work in this
[1:14:31] day paragraph 12 1
[1:14:34] 124 he says the word that fail on the
[1:14:38] day of Pentecost will not work in this
[1:14:40] day no sir that was for Pentecost this
[1:14:45] is for the
[1:14:46] bride oh my God comes in this evil age a
[1:14:51] time where there's all kinds of
[1:14:52] distraction and all kinds of confusion
[1:14:55] and all the thing and the churches look
[1:14:57] warm and everything he says in the
[1:14:59] evening time there shall be light in the
[1:15:01] evening time and in revealing the light
[1:15:04] in the evening time God is gathering to
[1:15:07] himself a group of people in this lysan
[1:15:11] church ages he's moving them from a
[1:15:13] church age into the bright age he's
[1:15:15] moving them from the leadership of man
[1:15:18] into the leadership of God
[1:15:21] himself listen to this growing on
[1:15:25] he says going home of the pride he says
[1:15:29] we got something different the
[1:15:30] Pentecostal it says that the Pentecostal
[1:15:34] represented that again we are in the
[1:15:37] bright age no more it says that word of
[1:15:41] Noah would not work in the day of Moses
[1:15:44] no more than Moses law would have worked
[1:15:47] in the time of Paul here he says he
[1:15:50] tries to he tries to tell them you are
[1:15:53] dead to that and you cannot heaven right
[1:15:56] let me say this it's very important that
[1:15:59] we recognize the day and the message
[1:16:01] that we are living under so it's
[1:16:03] important as we come to church to know
[1:16:06] I'm here because I have been moved out
[1:16:09] of the
[1:16:10] denomination out of all the things of
[1:16:12] the world I have been brought into the
[1:16:15] bright
[1:16:19] age oh
[1:16:23] my in the message the anointed ones at
[1:16:26] the endend
[1:16:28] time but whatam says paragraph 160
[1:16:32] says but
[1:16:34] remember that Pentecostal Church in the
[1:16:38] last day was that
[1:16:43] Lan and Christ was turned out and
[1:16:49] Colonel the wheat itself when he dried
[1:16:54] remember
[1:16:56] when he tried to manifest himself to the
[1:16:58] church he was taken
[1:17:02] out
[1:17:03] now remember when he got when he was
[1:17:07] taken out of the
[1:17:09] church where the church got to where
[1:17:12] they would rather enjoy what they were
[1:17:15] doing they would rather have the Spirit
[1:17:18] Fall have gifts in the church and they
[1:17:22] take away they took away the word word
[1:17:25] from the pulpit they will come and they
[1:17:27] will rejoice and say there's no need to
[1:17:30] preach because the Spirit Fall where
[1:17:32] they will come to a place where the word
[1:17:35] never had no more preeminence in them
[1:17:37] where they would not care or have a care
[1:17:40] about the word of God coming forth from
[1:17:42] the pulpit they came a time where they
[1:17:46] rejected this message was revealed to
[1:17:49] the
[1:17:51] Pentecostal remember whatam said he went
[1:17:54] to that uh h a meeting where he went and
[1:17:57] people were speaking in tongue and all
[1:17:58] of that he said God sent him to go
[1:18:02] there he came and they came and yeah
[1:18:05] they are they gathered up against the
[1:18:07] word they said we we don't have a
[1:18:09] problem with you Healing The Sick we
[1:18:12] don't have a problem with you and you
[1:18:14] know doing all the things that you are
[1:18:15] doing but the only problem we have is
[1:18:17] the things you're
[1:18:18] speaking they don't make any sense so
[1:18:21] they would rather they would rather have
[1:18:25] the gifts and the manifestation of all
[1:18:27] the things and reject the word
[1:18:30] forgetting that it's the word that
[1:18:32] produced all of those
[1:18:35] things who have you heard say that if if
[1:18:38] what I say is not the word if what I say
[1:18:42] is the word of God then let him come and
[1:18:44] vindicate it to
[1:18:47] you what was he doing he was presenting
[1:18:50] the word so by believing the word you
[1:18:53] will receive everything with it
[1:18:56] but if you receive all the other things
[1:18:58] without the word then you were under
[1:19:00] deception that's
[1:19:03] right now he
[1:19:05] says but here is the word Christ himself
[1:19:10] that's the anointed word which was which
[1:19:13] which which shall come uh for the rest
[1:19:15] of the Body for the rest of his body the
[1:19:18] bride the anointed of of the same water
[1:19:23] and now watered the wheat
[1:19:25] and we talk about also the water that
[1:19:27] water the tear anointed one he says one
[1:19:31] elected and predestinated will be able
[1:19:34] to detect the difference between them
[1:19:36] Ephesians 5 and one tell it says tells
[1:19:40] us so about about about it about what it
[1:19:44] was about how it was in the rising of
[1:19:47] the son the prophet
[1:19:49] says as Jesus paragraph 94 it says as
[1:19:54] Jesus was the first
[1:20:02] one as Jesus was the first one to raise
[1:20:05] from all the prophet and so
[1:20:09] forth it says although typed in many
[1:20:12] places he was the first fruits for those
[1:20:15] that slept in the bride coming of Christ
[1:20:19] Hallelujah in the bride coming of Christ
[1:20:22] coming out of the church there were be a
[1:20:25] sheave wave again in the last day now
[1:20:29] listen to this waving the sheave what
[1:20:33] was the Sheep the first one that came to
[1:20:37] maturity the first one that proved that
[1:20:39] he was wheat to prove that he was a
[1:20:42] sheave Hallelujah I'm sure you you see
[1:20:46] what I'm talking about it was the W it
[1:20:49] was it was waved over the people the
[1:20:51] first time he says the first time they
[1:20:54] came forth for the bright age for a
[1:20:56] resurrection out of the dark
[1:20:58] denomination will be a message uh to for
[1:21:01] the full maturity of the word has to
[1:21:04] turn back again into its full power
[1:21:08] being wave over the People by the same
[1:21:10] sign and wonders as he did back then let
[1:21:13] me say this why this is
[1:21:15] important God could not do this in
[1:21:18] Pentecost because Pentecost has stopped
[1:21:21] in fact it says if Pentecost has
[1:21:23] progressed then were going to be into
[1:21:25] the bride so what happened is God was
[1:21:28] moving forward with the goal of
[1:21:30] achieving a full maturity and that's why
[1:21:32] the scripture says that all that God was
[1:21:35] he poured into Christ but whatam says
[1:21:38] that in the end time he says that all
[1:21:40] that Christ was he will pour into his
[1:21:43] church why because he promised that in
[1:21:45] the last age there will be a
[1:21:48] manifestation of Christ not not just a
[1:21:51] partial a full manifestation of
[1:21:54] everything that he was why because
[1:21:56] everything that he was the bride has to
[1:22:00] be everything that Christ was the bride
[1:22:03] has to be not a different not a small
[1:22:06] portion
[1:22:07] [Applause]
[1:22:09] everything if Jesus saved the bride can
[1:22:12] save if Jesus healed the bride can heal
[1:22:15] if Jesus raised the Dead the bride can
[1:22:17] raise the
[1:22:21] dead that's why it's such a deception
[1:22:24] when people hang on to just little
[1:22:27] things or oh I just want to do this and
[1:22:29] speak in tongue and I just no God wants
[1:22:32] to fill you every fiber of your being
[1:22:35] with his own
[1:22:39] presence he wants you to be a full word
[1:22:44] bride I'm getting to my message I feel
[1:22:47] like I just need to jump in there I'm
[1:22:49] just trying to be
[1:22:52] patient a full thir
[1:22:56] bride he says I have heard but now I
[1:23:01] see he
[1:23:14] says he
[1:23:16] says the critics
[1:23:18] say why wouldn't God have mercy
[1:23:24] he could open up the Red Sea and stand
[1:23:27] and stand and let the
[1:23:28] poor Christian be beaten by lion and
[1:23:31] bird and burn and and all kinds of
[1:23:34] things and and and it just he laughed
[1:23:36] about it the poor ignoramus did did he
[1:23:40] not know except the corn of weed falling
[1:23:43] to the ground he abides alone it says
[1:23:47] and he dies and he die and and and and
[1:23:49] and dies through those ages those Dark
[1:23:52] Ages like one of the Corn of wheat that
[1:23:54] went underneath the Earth and to be
[1:23:56] buried to bring forth the First Reform
[1:23:59] Reformation of the two blades Luther and
[1:24:02] the and the star and it was to come
[1:24:04] forth in the West Land it says out
[1:24:07] yonder to bring forth the pollen and the
[1:24:09] tassel and and the great missionary age
[1:24:12] and it was to come forth in the
[1:24:15] Pentecostal for the restoration of the
[1:24:17] gift he says almost to deceive the very
[1:24:22] elect look like a wheat again he's
[1:24:25] speaking about the Pentecostal the last
[1:24:28] the very closest look like the wheat
[1:24:30] grain open it up it says there's no
[1:24:33] wheat you open it up there's no wheat in
[1:24:35] there at all it's only a shock but back
[1:24:39] it says but back there then they begin
[1:24:43] to reform to form the Oneness
[1:24:45] organization the trinitarian the Trinity
[1:24:48] organization the tunist organization the
[1:24:50] Church of God organization and the organ
[1:24:54] and they all organized and and just just
[1:24:58] death exactly and now what happened but
[1:25:02] it's sheltered for the wheat but it's
[1:25:05] but it's a shelter for the wheat it's
[1:25:08] been growing through all through it all
[1:25:11] that time now listen it's began to pull
[1:25:16] away the wheat begin to see to be seen
[1:25:21] this is not the Pentecostal age this
[1:25:24] this is the latter day age this is the
[1:25:27] bright age this is the evening light
[1:25:30] this is when malachite 4 must be
[1:25:32] fulfilled to grow God's pattern of Luke
[1:25:35] this is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled this
[1:25:38] is the second and Jeremiah and and all
[1:25:42] the rest of
[1:25:44] them that Joel has spoke of these days
[1:25:48] this is that day I have heard of the
[1:25:51] Lord I was it says and he was coming but
[1:25:54] now I see with my eyes what are you
[1:25:58] seeing with your eyes what are you
[1:26:01] seeing with your eyes tonight are you
[1:26:03] just seeing a bunch of people that's
[1:26:05] gathered and and they just come to
[1:26:07] rejoice and then go back home and do the
[1:26:09] same things over and over are you seeing
[1:26:11] a bunch of backslide and people that
[1:26:13] don't believe the message and uh come
[1:26:20] on people that coming day in and day out
[1:26:24] to they are not changing all of those
[1:26:25] things no let me say this in the midst
[1:26:28] of all of this God is bringing forth the
[1:26:31] promise of restoration and the promise
[1:26:33] of restoration remember God says to
[1:26:36] restore is to bring in its original
[1:26:39] state Amen to restore is not to exchange
[1:26:43] to restore is not to replace to restore
[1:26:47] is the man the same man that fall in the
[1:26:49] Garden of Eden God in the end time
[1:26:52] message is here to Resto that man to
[1:26:55] bring him in that same Authority that he
[1:26:57] had in the beginning that's right that's
[1:27:00] what the end time messages come to
[1:27:03] do don't sell yourself short of anything
[1:27:07] whatever God was you are today whatever
[1:27:11] Adam was you are today why because it
[1:27:14] has to be a full
[1:27:17] word not a partial word a full word
[1:27:22] manifestation what Jesus was we are
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:28] today but yet we are
[1:27:30] and our hearts are turned towards how am
[1:27:34] I going to pay my bills
[1:27:37] and now did Jesus Wonder or have times
[1:27:41] where difficulties arose
[1:27:45] yeah if you go
[1:27:47] read they came a time where they needed
[1:27:50] to pay taxes
[1:27:54] but whatam says there came a time where
[1:27:57] he came and he had a
[1:27:59] headache he had to go rest
[1:28:02] and and he got tired he had to sit
[1:28:08] and but he didn't rely on his Man part
[1:28:13] to solve his
[1:28:18] trouble he didn't rely on that body that
[1:28:22] got tired he knew knew that he was
[1:28:25] predestinated to be there to lay his
[1:28:28] life down he knew the purpose that he
[1:28:31] was sent for he knew that he was there
[1:28:34] to fulfill God's word that part of the
[1:28:37] word that was given for him to bring to
[1:28:39] pass and let me say this it's not
[1:28:41] different than you sitting here tonight
[1:28:44] the problem is we rely on our men part
[1:28:46] our intellect and our abilities when God
[1:28:49] is wanting us to rely on what he's made
[1:28:52] us to be
[1:28:55] am but what I'm says in in in in uh
[1:28:59] perfect faith it says he relied on what
[1:29:03] God made him to be he RI on the word
[1:29:07] that was made him to be he believe he
[1:29:10] was the word and he rely on what the
[1:29:13] word was supposed to do at that
[1:29:16] time he says can't we
[1:29:19] also rely on what God has made us to be
[1:29:23] he's not made us to go work for Pharaoh
[1:29:25] every day he's not made us to go and
[1:29:27] rely on the economy of pharaoh he's made
[1:29:30] us to be people that can bring them the
[1:29:33] kingdom people that can pray and things
[1:29:35] will happen and people when they find
[1:29:38] difficulties can say I'm a child of God
[1:29:41] and things will
[1:29:44] happen I I was thinking
[1:29:49] about butam talks about the story the
[1:29:52] story of the slave from Africa
[1:29:54] and I I just thought about it so hard
[1:29:59] and
[1:30:01] and yeah he was
[1:30:05] and and perhaps you will find yourself
[1:30:08] in a similar situation or worse
[1:30:10] and I want you to
[1:30:13] imagine that he had things he couldn't
[1:30:16] do perhaps you know lack of certain
[1:30:21] abilities and I don't imagine was the
[1:30:25] strongest of the
[1:30:26] bunch I don't imagine because I think
[1:30:29] when we think about that story we make
[1:30:31] him like stronger we make him perfect in
[1:30:34] every
[1:30:35] way but there was something a
[1:30:37] characteristic about him that the
[1:30:40] prophet
[1:30:40] mentioned is that he did the best that
[1:30:46] he knew how
[1:30:48] to don't you to think about
[1:30:51] that I don't believe every Rock that was
[1:30:54] big that they asked him to makeig it was
[1:30:56] able to pick it
[1:30:58] up but he had a connection somewhere
[1:31:01] there it is where he was he knew PR says
[1:31:05] that he knew that where they came from
[1:31:08] that his father was a king and he said
[1:31:11] he relied on that that was the source of
[1:31:14] his strength in a situation that he
[1:31:16] would find himself if he find himself he
[1:31:19] couldn't do anything if he find himself
[1:31:21] he was weak or if he find himself at
[1:31:24] work and he was so tired he couldn't
[1:31:26] even lift up his hand he reminded
[1:31:28] himself who's your father where did he
[1:31:31] come from how did you get here yeah I'm
[1:31:34] a slave but I don't forget where I come
[1:31:38] from so just the reminding of him of
[1:31:41] where he came from give him the strength
[1:31:43] to do whatever was before
[1:31:46] him and that's what attracted the
[1:31:49] Master's attention
[1:31:55] sometimes we feel like we got to be
[1:31:56] perfect in every way to no just remember
[1:31:59] who you
[1:32:00] are you sick just remember who you are
[1:32:04] you don't have a job just remember who
[1:32:06] you
[1:32:07] are if you remember who you are and you
[1:32:09] have a connection with your father
[1:32:11] something will rise up within your heart
[1:32:13] and you say I've had enough of this I
[1:32:16] can stay this way even let me say this
[1:32:19] if the prodal son could remember where
[1:32:22] he came from and remember that in my
[1:32:25] father's
[1:32:27] house if the prodical son just the
[1:32:30] memory of where he came from was enough
[1:32:32] for him to stand up and walk away how
[1:32:35] much more
[1:32:37] we in whatever circumstance you find
[1:32:40] yourself tonight just stand up and walk
[1:32:42] away just speak the word and say my
[1:32:45] father can do this there's nothing too
[1:32:48] big for him there's no challenge too
[1:32:50] great for him you whatever circumstance
[1:32:53] I find myself yes sir if I can't do it
[1:32:56] my father will do it for
[1:33:00] me if I don't have food my father will
[1:33:03] give me
[1:33:05] food if I can't have this my father will
[1:33:09] give it to
[1:33:13] me that's your word
[1:33:15] connection that's what makes you the
[1:33:17] word bride I I think I'm running out of
[1:33:20] time I'll just say
[1:33:22] it oh word
[1:33:27] bride butam said
[1:33:31] that when we recognize who we
[1:33:36] are
[1:33:38] right we'll become an invincible
[1:33:44] Army
[1:33:47] true but Ram also
[1:33:50] said that the bride
[1:33:54] under her Messenger will be the final
[1:33:57] voice to the final
[1:33:59] AIDS but all of that comes by the word
[1:34:02] yes sure
[1:34:03] it it's not because we dream ourselves
[1:34:06] big and we go and we sing loud like the
[1:34:10] armies of bail and then we think we're
[1:34:12] going to become the no it's the
[1:34:14] obedience to the word that takes us to
[1:34:16] that place in other words the word is
[1:34:19] the only let me say this the only weapon
[1:34:22] yes come on that actually makes you an
[1:34:26] invincible Army by taking the word you
[1:34:29] are becoming an invincible Army by
[1:34:32] walking away from the the word you are
[1:34:34] walking away from being an invincible
[1:34:39] Army think of that we go and we take our
[1:34:43] own understanding and we drum it up and
[1:34:46] we think oh now we are an invincible
[1:34:48] Army no it can only be by the word why
[1:34:52] because the word is the only thing that
[1:34:54] never fails if God spoke it it will come
[1:34:58] to pass so our protection is to be
[1:35:00] behind the word yes we have to eat it we
[1:35:05] have to drink it we have to talk it we
[1:35:08] have to sleep on it we have to do
[1:35:10] everything by
[1:35:15] it why would the prophet said never have
[1:35:19] a negative
[1:35:20] thought never speak negative never do
[1:35:24] all of that because by doing that you
[1:35:27] are giving yourself to negativity and
[1:35:29] therefore you are being defeated why
[1:35:32] would he say always be positive always
[1:35:34] speak the word it says the word is near
[1:35:38] thee even in thy
[1:35:40] mouth but guess what it feels good to
[1:35:47] complain think about
[1:35:49] that so it feels good to weaken yourself
[1:35:53] uh
[1:35:54] it feels good to belittle yourself I'm
[1:35:57] no good I can't do this I'm too sick I'm
[1:36:01] to that I'm to
[1:36:04] this what says I'm happy I'm glad I have
[1:36:10] God in my heart everything is well
[1:36:12] listen that woman when she came to
[1:36:15] Elijah she had a lot to complain about
[1:36:18] she had a lot to complain about but when
[1:36:20] he asked him it says all is well
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:33] the
[1:36:36] word we become an invincible Army by
[1:36:40] partaking of the word if John is the
[1:36:44] type of the Bride then we have to be the
[1:36:47] bride itself that eats of the word we
[1:36:50] have the bride that loves the word we
[1:36:53] have to fell in love with th this word
[1:36:56] is us this is
[1:36:58] not sometimes I think our approach is oh
[1:37:02] I'm going to go and read and and find
[1:37:04] things I never heard before you're not
[1:37:07] doing yourself a
[1:37:09] favor come
[1:37:11] on I would rather read one chapter and
[1:37:15] live the rest of my life to make sure I
[1:37:17] become that
[1:37:22] chapter it's it's your book it's your
[1:37:24] message you eat it you become it amen
[1:37:29] when you go out you say I want the
[1:37:31] author of this word who called me to be
[1:37:34] an overcomer who called me to be an
[1:37:37] invincible Army who called me to stand
[1:37:40] against the army of the Satan who called
[1:37:42] me to cast out demons who's called me to
[1:37:45] manifest his very life to this
[1:37:47] generation who's called me to be the
[1:37:50] very representation of who is who he is
[1:37:53] to this world I want him to make his
[1:37:56] word
[1:37:58] true but what says if Jesus came by the
[1:38:02] word of the Prophet The Bride will come
[1:38:05] by the
[1:38:09] same because the same word that calls
[1:38:11] for Jesus the same word is called for
[1:38:13] the
[1:38:14] bride it's no
[1:38:17] different if the musician could come
[1:38:26] we'll continue another
[1:38:34] time and this becomes important because
[1:38:39] remember only the word bride will go in
[1:38:43] the
[1:38:46] Rapture only a word
[1:38:50] bride our emotions are not going to get
[1:38:53] get us in the
[1:38:54] Rapture our singing is not going to get
[1:38:57] us in the Rapture though we love to sing
[1:38:59] and we could jump up and down that's not
[1:39:02] the requirement for the Rapture
[1:39:05] right we can do all that we want to
[1:39:09] do but it's not until we become the word
[1:39:13] we take our position in the word the
[1:39:18] position that the word has given us
[1:39:21] remember we didn't give ourselves this
[1:39:22] position the word has called us to be
[1:39:25] this only when we do
[1:39:29] that we'll become an invisible
[1:39:33] Army but whatam says
[1:39:37] this year is the most evidence evidently
[1:39:41] set forth that the perfect manifestation
[1:39:44] of God in his ins son was by indwelling
[1:39:48] spirit manifesting in word and works
[1:39:53] that is exactly what we have been
[1:39:55] teaching all along when the
[1:39:58] rde will get back to being a word bride
[1:40:08] Hallelujah I I read it and it just
[1:40:10] ringed
[1:40:12] different when the bride when the bride
[1:40:16] will get back to being a word
[1:40:20] bride I realize there's something we
[1:40:23] need to do there's something we need to
[1:40:26] pay attention
[1:40:28] to we don't come to just jump oh I'm
[1:40:31] save I'm I'm called to be part of the
[1:40:33] Bride yeah we everything we talked about
[1:40:36] is true but it's only by the
[1:40:39] word that we enter in is only by
[1:40:43] Believing by the
[1:40:45] word being a word bright meaning I
[1:40:49] recognize what the word is saying about
[1:40:51] me and I'm staying in the presence of
[1:40:54] that word so I can mature to what that
[1:40:56] word has called for me to be not my
[1:41:00] enthusiasm by being a word bride again
[1:41:04] she will produce the very works that
[1:41:06] Jesus produced the word the word is God
[1:41:11] the spirit is God they are all one one
[1:41:14] cannot work apart from the other if one
[1:41:18] has truly the spirit of God he will have
[1:41:21] the word of God
[1:41:24] that is how it will be it will be it
[1:41:28] will that how it was with the prophet he
[1:41:30] says they had the indwelling spirit of
[1:41:33] God and the word came to them this is
[1:41:36] how it was with Jesus Christ in him was
[1:41:39] the spirit without measure and the word
[1:41:42] came to him Jesus both began to do and
[1:41:45] teach my Doctrine is not my own but the
[1:41:49] father that sent
[1:41:51] me it says in another places
[1:41:55] out now let us go on a step but before
[1:42:00] we do let us review our case thus far
[1:42:04] first we must all know more we must know
[1:42:07] more assuredly that the purpose of God
[1:42:11] stands in
[1:42:12] election it was purposed in himself that
[1:42:16] he was going to purpose to bring forth a
[1:42:19] people liken unto
[1:42:21] himself the purpose of God was to
[1:42:24] reproduce
[1:42:25] himself it's not so we can just come and
[1:42:28] say praise God for what you've done no
[1:42:32] but when I'm Compares it says the idols
[1:42:34] of the word of the world is those that
[1:42:38] they have statue where man has to
[1:42:40] constantly come and pray to and offer
[1:42:42] sacrifice and do works for the for the
[1:42:45] God so that God can bless him but says
[1:42:48] but the god that we serve when he comes
[1:42:50] to you he says he makes you and I Idol
[1:42:54] what does he do he he takes himself and
[1:42:57] he dwells within the worshiper
[1:43:01] himself hallelujah what kind of God do
[1:43:03] we serve it if you pray to him tonight
[1:43:07] if you believe him tonight if you
[1:43:09] believe his word tonight what it does
[1:43:12] for you is not just send you what you
[1:43:14] have need of and say Yes healing yes
[1:43:17] that no at the end he himself he himself
[1:43:22] let me say this he's the same in power
[1:43:25] he's the same in substance he's the same
[1:43:28] in everything he's the same in attribute
[1:43:31] he himself he comes and he becomes one
[1:43:34] with the very
[1:43:37] worshipper tell me another another God
[1:43:39] that can do
[1:43:40] that tell me another one that I can go
[1:43:43] worship that does
[1:43:47] that we are such a privileged people we
[1:43:51] are such a privileged people
[1:43:53] oh if we can only come to that
[1:43:56] understanding he he tonight not another
[1:43:59] night tonight within your heart you can
[1:44:02] raise your hand and say Lord I believe
[1:44:04] your word I want the manifestation of
[1:44:07] your word your word is life to me he
[1:44:11] will come he will come according to the
[1:44:14] scriptures according to the promise of
[1:44:16] your time let me say this if you've
[1:44:19] walked along and it doesn't work I
[1:44:21] invite you to take the seed of the word
[1:44:24] tonight and plant it into your heart and
[1:44:27] say God I heard your word and I'm
[1:44:30] planting your seed in my heart and I
[1:44:32] want you to take that word and let it
[1:44:35] just bring forth into my heart whatever
[1:44:38] you have need of he will give it to you
[1:44:41] why because that's the kind of God We
[1:44:43] Serve by
[1:44:45] predestination he predestinated before
[1:44:48] you came the prophet was predestinated
[1:44:51] the people that is calling forth are
[1:44:53] predestinated all we doing is coming
[1:44:56] together according to that great
[1:44:58] manifestation that he had purpose within
[1:45:01] himself
[1:45:02] yes why you believe because you were
[1:45:05] predestinated to believe that's it why
[1:45:07] you sitting here trust me it's not by
[1:45:10] accident it's not because you said well
[1:45:12] I have to go no outside of all of those
[1:45:15] things there's a seed of manifestation a
[1:45:19] seed of predestination playing a role
[1:45:21] somewhere why because because if God
[1:45:24] predestinated a bride to be here there
[1:45:26] has to be a bride nothing can stop
[1:45:31] it so I say let's go back to being a
[1:45:36] word bride again God bless you let us

[1:51:39] not they're all mixed up and confused
[1:51:42] and you know it struck me as he was

[1:51:46] of the tactics in maybe war or or they
[1:51:49] throw what they call a flashbangs or
[1:51:51] percussion grenades and it disorients

[1:52:03] that story of the slave is he wasn't
[1:52:05] disoriented if anybody had a reason to
[1:52:08] be disoriented it was him he had been
[1:52:11] captive he'd been taken a slave he was
[1:52:13] away far from his country but even
[1:52:16] though he was in that condition he was
[1:52:18] I'm a son of a king I'm a son of a king

[1:52:30] they want to be some athlete they want
[1:52:32] to be some movie star they want to be
[1:52:34] this or that and then God sends a
