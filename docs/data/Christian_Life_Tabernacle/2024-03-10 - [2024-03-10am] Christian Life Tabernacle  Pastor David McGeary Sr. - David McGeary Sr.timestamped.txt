[4:19] Upon Our

[4:27] dark in a dark time father Lord we thank
[4:31] you for this another time to gather
[4:33] together Lord to hear from you Lord we
[4:37] pray that you would speak to each one of
[4:39] us according to your
[4:41] word Lord are the very bread of life
[4:44] that we depend upon feed upon Lord we
[4:48] pray Lord that your presence would be
[4:49] here as you promised it would Lord may
[4:53] all things be done according to your
[4:54] will Lord I pray that you would meet
[4:57] every need Lord Lord that you would make
[5:00] yourself
[5:01] known Lord that the service would be
[5:03] done according to your will we pray
[5:06] these things in Jesus name amen you may
[5:09] be
[5:12] seated I'm going
[5:14] to read in Psalm 70 this morning if want
[5:18] to go ahead and turn
[5:20] there I don't know about you but
[5:24] uh as you listen
[5:26] to you know the messages that brother
[5:28] Brandon preached preached over the
[5:31] years you begin to
[5:34] recognize you know the patterns for how
[5:36] he did
[5:38] things now I'm
[5:42] sure some of you have picked up on that
[5:44] as
[5:45] well you know the manner in which he
[5:48] worked the way he handled
[5:52] something maybe the spirit in which he
[5:55] would perform
[5:57] something you know and just as the Lord
[5:59] used his
[6:02] words the words that he spoke to
[6:04] minister
[6:06] life you know the spirit of the Lord
[6:09] that was in him caused him to do things
[6:12] in a certain way to demonstrate that
[6:15] life at
[6:18] work you know one of the things which
[6:21] brother brandham
[6:22] did nearly 200 times over the course of
[6:26] his ministry that as we have it
[6:31] recorded was there would be times he
[6:33] would begin to
[6:35] pray and he would just simply
[6:39] say in the name of Jesus Christ the son
[6:43] of
[6:44] God I take every spirit in
[6:48] here under my control for the glory of
[6:53] God how many of you remember
[6:57] that you know often this was before he'd
[6:59] be a prayer line
[7:01] when you know he would be facing all
[7:04] kinds of infirmities or Spirits burdens
[7:07] that people
[7:10] had you can go and listen to yourself I
[7:13] I counted nearly 180
[7:17] times but you have one that
[7:20] stood and put things in their
[7:24] place you know as I listen to this you
[7:27] know the
[7:28] question
[7:30] that we should
[7:32] ask was this a prophet
[7:38] exercising a prophetic gift and taking a
[7:42] position that only a prophet can
[7:45] do
[7:47] or was this a Son of God doing what a
[7:51] grown-up Son of God should be
[7:56] doing you know there are certainly
[7:58] things that brother brandom did which
[8:01] were part of his
[8:03] office that his commission is a prophet
[8:07] things that belong to that
[8:10] role but the life which he was
[8:14] demonstrating was son
[8:17] life a mature
[8:19] son taking that
[8:23] word putting it to his lips and putting
[8:26] it to
[8:28] work
[8:30] in the name of Jesus Christ the son of
[8:34] God I take every spirit in here under my
[8:40] control for the glory of
[8:43] God you know Jesus said something toward
[8:46] the end of his ministry it was in
[8:48] Matthew 28:18 he said this all power is
[8:54] given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[9:00] all power in Heaven and
[9:03] Earth that means that nothing
[9:07] else and no one else has any
[9:13] power except to Those whom he gives
[9:19] it and then in Luke
[9:23] 2439 he instructs his disciples
[9:26] behold I send the promise of my father
[9:29] upon you but tar ye in the city of
[9:32] Jerusalem until ye be endued with power
[9:38] from on
[9:41] high in John 14 he calls this the
[9:45] comforter and that when he the comforter
[9:48] shall
[9:49] come verse 20 at that
[9:53] day ye shall know that I am in my father
[10:00] and ye in
[10:02] me and I in
[10:07] you and in Luke 10 he tells his
[10:09] disciples behold I give unto
[10:13] you not just my
[10:15] prophets Power To Tread on serpents and
[10:20] scorpions and over all the power of the
[10:25] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[10:30] hurt
[10:32] you and then we had one
[10:35] come and show us the
[10:38] approach how to do
[10:41] that very
[10:43] simply in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:46] Christ the son of God I take every
[10:51] spirit in here under my control for the
[10:55] glory of
[10:57] God you know this was on my my mind as I
[10:59] was reading Psalm 70
[11:02] there's you know as with many other
[11:04] Psalms David is in prayer asking for the
[11:08] help of the Lord but as he's praying say
[11:11] very makes an interesting statement in
[11:13] verse two he says this let them be
[11:17] ashamed and
[11:19] confounded that seek after my
[11:22] soul let them be turned backward and put
[11:26] to
[11:27] confusion that desire My
[11:30] hurt and
[11:33] notice this is not a question he's not
[11:37] asking let them
[11:41] be you know two things stuck out to me
[11:44] as he prayed
[11:46] that first he's speaking to them that
[11:49] seek after his
[11:51] soul not there not his body not his
[11:55] finances not his job not his physical
[11:58] condition but
[11:59] all those
[12:01] enemies that are coming after his soul
[12:04] to try to take
[12:07] that something we all have aimed at us
[12:10] each day as
[12:12] Believers but the second thing that
[12:14] struck me was what he prayed
[12:18] for not just Lord help me and deliver me
[12:22] but he took it a step
[12:24] further may all those that seek my soul
[12:30] be put to
[12:31] shame may they be
[12:35] confounded turn them back and put them
[12:38] to
[12:41] confusion you know I thought of James in
[12:43] James 4 as I was reading that and he he
[12:46] was instructing us ye ask and receive
[12:51] not because ye ask a
[12:53] miss that you may consume it upon your
[12:56] lusts you know and certainly
[13:00] it's a clear instruction not to be in
[13:01] prayer for carnal fleshly
[13:05] things but beyond that I wonder how
[13:09] often when I
[13:11] pray I'm focused more on my fleshly
[13:15] outcome than on the spiritual
[13:20] reality Lord help my body to feel
[13:24] better give me the
[13:27] strength help my work to be
[13:30] successful help my words to be a
[13:33] blessing help me to overcome this and
[13:37] have strength for that help me to be
[13:40] more faithful good things but
[13:42] still fleshly
[13:46] things but I wonder how many times
[13:48] instead if I would
[13:50] pray Lord let those
[13:53] things which are coming after my soul be
[13:57] confounded
[14:00] May their efforts be confused turn them
[14:03] back frustrate the work that they would
[14:07] try to do against
[14:11] me
[14:12] or in the name of Jesus Christ the son
[14:17] of
[14:18] God I take every spirit in here under my
[14:23] control to the glory of
[14:27] God I wonder if there are things I
[14:30] should be asking
[14:32] for that I'm
[14:35] not am I living below my
[14:38] privilege am I asking a
[14:43] Miss are there things I struggle
[14:47] with waiting in faith for
[14:50] deliverance where I could instead be
[14:53] praying May that thing that seeks my
[14:55] soul be turned
[14:57] back may it be
[15:00] confounded May its efforts be confused
[15:03] and put to
[15:06] shame that the efforts of the enemy in
[15:09] my life would be
[15:14] frustrated notice David wasn't asking
[15:17] here he was declaring let this
[15:22] be you know often when we think about
[15:25] you know taking control of spirits in
[15:28] prayer
[15:30] we often think of great prayer
[15:33] lines that it requires Great labor and
[15:36] great
[15:37] effort and intense
[15:40] prayer that if we can have the right
[15:42] number of
[15:43] preachers pray long enough and hard
[15:47] enough that we can
[15:49] have
[15:52] deliverance and there are times for
[15:56] that but when an example of mature
[15:59] maturity was set before
[16:02] us a
[16:04] simple statement of faith standing on
[16:07] the
[16:09] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:13] Christ I take every Spirit under my
[16:17] control to the glory of
[16:22] God and he wasn't
[16:25] asking he was
[16:27] declaring
[16:29] which frankly is what prayer of faith
[16:31] looks
[16:33] like let's go ahead and stand this
[16:38] morning you know certainly we do need
[16:41] the Lord's
[16:42] help you know and then we'll read here
[16:44] in verse 5 as David says I am poor and
[16:47] needy make haste to help but there's a
[16:50] declaration here that the work of the
[16:52] enemy against him would be frustrated
[16:55] would be confused would be turned back
[17:01] you know I wonder if it's a
[17:02] underutilized tool in our
[17:07] Arsenal that if we're not careful we
[17:10] defer that to the ministers and the
[17:12] prophets to do instead of taking that
[17:15] for
[17:17] ourselves you know but if all power is
[17:20] given unto
[17:22] him and then he has endued us with power
[17:26] from on high then every believer
[17:29] to whom the comforter has come can make
[17:32] that same
[17:35] declaration and like
[17:37] David like brother
[17:39] brandom we're not
[17:42] asking all right let's go ahead and read
[17:44] Psalm 70 together this morning make
[17:47] haste oh God to deliver me make haste to
[17:51] help me oh Lord let them be ashamed and
[17:54] confounded that seek after my soul let
[17:57] them be turned back Ward and put to
[17:59] confusion that desire My hurt let them
[18:02] be turned back for a reward of their
[18:04] shame that say aha
[18:10] Aha and let such as love thy salvation
[18:13] say continually let God be magnified but
[18:17] I am poor and needy make haste unto me
[18:19] oh God Thou Art my help and my deliverer
[18:23] oh Lord Make No ter
[18:27] amen
[18:31] amen I trust you happy to be in the

[40:46] INR amen The Living Hope let's approach
[40:50] him this
[40:51] morning just turn your heart to him and
[40:55] if you have a desire desire on your
[40:57] heart and need in your
[41:01] life might seem
[41:03] impossible but with him all things are
[41:08] possible if you can just believe take a
[41:12] moment in your heart to just think that
[41:15] he's all
[41:16] powerful he's the creator of Heaven and
[41:20] Earth there's nothing that is impossible
[41:24] for him
[41:28] and just commit it into his hands and
[41:31] believe that he hears you this morning
[41:34] our precious
[41:37] father we come to you this morning
[41:40] because we believe that you
[41:42] are and that you're a rewarder of them
[41:45] that diligently seek
[41:48] you we've come here this morning Father
[41:52] there's certainly other places we could
[41:55] be
[41:58] but there's a hunger in our heart for
[42:01] eternal
[42:04] life a hunger in our heart for joy and
[42:08] peace that
[42:10] surpasseth
[42:12] understanding there's a desire in our
[42:14] heart for the words of eternal life that
[42:17] you alone
[42:19] possess so we've come this morning
[42:22] though we love one
[42:23] another though we long to fellowship
[42:27] with one another but father this morning
[42:30] we've come that we might feel your
[42:33] presence and hear your
[42:36] voice that we might be blessed in
[42:39] contact the
[42:41] Supernatural and Lord only you can grant
[42:46] that we could work as hard as we could
[42:48] work we could work it up we could do
[42:52] everything but father you alone are in
[42:54] control of your presence
[42:57] you go where you want to
[43:00] go and so we're calling on your name
[43:03] that you might walk in our presence this
[43:06] morning that you might touch our needs
[43:09] this morning Father that we could walk
[43:12] from this place with joy in our heart
[43:15] and truly say he
[43:17] lives he's the same yesterday today and
[43:20] forever and I've touched the Hem of His
[43:23] Garment I alone personally can testify
[43:27] that he's risen from the dead may be
[43:31] that be each of our portion this morning
[43:34] we ask it in Jesus precious name we pray
[43:39] amen amen God bless you this morning
[43:42] let's turn in our Bibles uh like to
[43:45] welcome any visitors that we have this
[43:48] morning may the Lord be your portion
[43:50] this morning and and uh we just want to
[43:54] try not to be long but uh also just try
[43:58] to uh touch on the Simplicity of the
[44:02] Gospel how many believes God's hidden
[44:05] Simplicity amen the more complicated it
[44:08] gets the farther away you're getting
[44:10] from God you know conspiracy theories
[44:13] and and all these uh things that man
[44:16] always tries to come up with they're
[44:18] trying to put all the pieces of the
[44:20] puzzle together and the puzzle is very
[44:23] simple it's the word of God amen amen
[44:27] and and by his grace he's allowed the
[44:31] scriptures to be printed but man could
[44:34] come up with all kinds of
[44:36] interpretations but his presence and his
[44:39] Spirit interprets the word to you so
[44:42] that's what our our great hope is this
[44:44] morning that each of us will have a
[44:46] personal touch let's turn to the gospel
[44:49] again and Paul writing to the
[44:54] Corinthians 1 Corinthians
[44:56] the 13th
[45:01] chapter and we also have been
[45:04] reading uh this chapter along with uh
[45:09] the gospel of St John the 17th chapter
[45:13] The Lord's
[45:15] Prayer in the garden for his church and
[45:20] and so we just want to think over these
[45:22] things again and and as we read these
[45:25] and you know I'm not a very good reader
[45:27] so you fill in the blanks for
[45:30] me but this is what you want to be
[45:34] asking yourself as each one of these
[45:38] characteristics are
[45:41] are read or being spoken ask yourself do
[45:46] I possess that okay do I have this is is
[45:50] this alive in my life and then if it's
[45:56] not we'd like to raise the question do
[46:00] you want this to be in your
[46:04] life and that and then the next question
[46:08] would be how do I get this
[46:12] in my life and so uh without trying to
[46:16] be complicated this morning and and and
[46:20] um we just want to read very simply and
[46:23] this is uh Paul
[46:26] going and we talked a little last week
[46:29] how the church started
[46:32] emphasizing on the wrong thing not the
[46:36] thing that they were emphasizing was
[46:40] wrong but they were putting too much
[46:44] emphasis and therefore moving it out of
[46:47] its proper place so you understand what
[46:50] I'm saying something can be right and
[46:54] good and and stand alone but if it gets
[46:57] moved out of its proper place or it gets
[47:01] more evidence and recognition put on it
[47:06] than what it was given to be put on it
[47:10] then it becomes out of
[47:12] balance and that's our desire is to
[47:15] really be in balance as
[47:17] Christian so he says here's though I
[47:20] speak with the tongues of men and
[47:24] angels
[47:26] and have not
[47:28] charity I am become as a sounding
[47:32] brass or a tinkling symbol so it wasn't
[47:37] the speaking in
[47:39] tongues that was wrong but if it isn't
[47:42] in its right place and with the right
[47:46] motivation it becomes
[47:50] noise and though I have the gift of
[47:54] Prophecy
[47:56] and understand all
[48:00] Mysteries and all
[48:02] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[48:07] that I could remove
[48:09] mountains and have not charity I am
[48:13] nothing so one is measured by God and
[48:17] one is measured by
[48:19] man amen one gives God the glory the
[48:23] other gives man the glory so he says and
[48:27] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[48:31] poor and though I give my body to be
[48:36] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[48:40] me nothing now those are some pretty
[48:43] strong
[48:44] things I mean we would think that every
[48:47] single one of these would be momentous
[48:51] in itself and worthy of great admiration
[48:55] ation and uh a great acknowledgment of
[48:59] God I laid my life down I was burned at
[49:02] the stake I prophesied I know all things
[49:05] you know and we think that that should
[49:07] account for something Paul says without
[49:10] love it accounts for nothing it's
[49:13] nothing if it's not placed right and
[49:16] motivated
[49:19] right and he says now he's going to
[49:22] explain because you could have all these
[49:25] things up here that we just talked about
[49:27] and not possess the virtues that
[49:30] follow charity suffereth long and is
[49:35] kind charity envieth not charity vth not
[49:41] itself is not puffed up amen does not
[49:45] behave itself
[49:48] unseemingly seeketh not her
[49:52] own is not easily Prov voked thinketh no
[49:58] evil rejoiceth not in
[50:01] iniquity but rejoiceth in the
[50:05] truth beareth all things believeth all
[50:10] things hopeth all things endureth all
[50:15] things wow I've just heard seven eight
[50:17] nine things I need to work
[50:20] on charity never
[50:23] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[50:27] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[50:31] they shall cease whether there be
[50:34] knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[50:38] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[50:43] when that which is perfect is
[50:47] come then that which is in part shall be
[50:51] done
[50:52] away when I was a child I I spake as a
[50:56] child I
[50:58] understood as a
[51:00] child I thought as a
[51:04] child but when I became a man I put away
[51:10] childish
[51:12] things for now we see through a glass
[51:15] darkling but when face to face now I
[51:20] know in part but then shall I know even
[51:25] as also I am
[51:28] known now abideth faith hope charity of
[51:32] these three but the greatest of these is
[51:35] Charity may the Lord add his Blessing to
[51:38] his word in jesus' name we pray amen God
[51:42] bless you you may be
[51:50] seated I I certainly believe that
[51:54] there's
[51:56] uh something about being a Christian or
[52:01] why that we're Christians or even that
[52:05] we have the name Christian is because
[52:09] there's an
[52:11] association with being Christlike amen I
[52:16] I would I would uh take that that would
[52:20] be the whole uh motivation of why that
[52:26] we're here this morning uh I mean I I
[52:30] know we're a a a a poor people if you
[52:33] would look across the land today uh we
[52:36] would be considered uh what would be
[52:38] referred to as a a poor congregation you
[52:42] know I walked through the lot and I
[52:45] didn't see any brand new Mercedes I
[52:48] didn't see you know any uh uh lotuses or
[52:54] or you know know nice uh hot cars uh I
[52:58] saw a few cars that are a few years old
[53:01] you know but but we don't put our
[53:04] emphasis on that I mean the value of our
[53:08] wealth is is not measured by worldly
[53:12] things the value of our wealth is
[53:16] measured by our
[53:18] faith amen so where God's come to the
[53:21] poor of this world who are rich in faith
[53:26] who who who be believes in a God that
[53:29] can do all things that nothing is
[53:33] impossible for him we're not relying on
[53:37] a uh intellectual conception or relying
[53:42] on our understanding of mysteries and
[53:45] knowledge to be what uh allows us to
[53:51] become Christlike so you can't know your
[53:55] yourself into becoming
[53:57] Christlike you you can't gather enough
[54:01] knowledge to make you live like the Lord
[54:04] Jesus and isn't that our goal we want to
[54:08] be Christlike we want to be like him he
[54:12] he when we read his story when we see
[54:15] the things that he's done we see the
[54:17] Miracles that he he uh performed we see
[54:21] the way that he reacted with Sinners how
[54:24] that he discerned the thoughts and
[54:26] intents of the heart in other words how
[54:28] he got right to the heart of the
[54:31] matter how he dealt with people where
[54:34] that they were really at and and he
[54:37] wasn't deceived or moved by
[54:40] pretentiousness or or by outside
[54:43] appearance he he he was there was
[54:45] something about him that that really
[54:48] caused him to really care about the
[54:52] people that he came in contact with we
[54:54] can could go through story after Story
[54:57] and Parable after Parable and every
[55:00] single one of the stories the the I love
[55:02] the story of the Good Samaritan and and
[55:06] we know that's a reflection of him and
[55:09] how that he's dealing with Sinners and
[55:11] how that the people that came down the
[55:14] road how each one of them discerned uh
[55:17] the situation here was a man beaten on
[55:20] the road and one man just drove by he
[55:23] was busy and another man didn't want to
[55:25] get involved with the situation but here
[55:28] came one that everybody else would
[55:30] consider a sinner and he
[55:34] stops and not only does he stop and
[55:37] render aid but he he goes the extra
[55:42] mile and he takes him to an end and he
[55:46] gives the man money and says take care
[55:49] of this man and I'll stop by on my way
[55:54] back
[55:56] and if I owee you anything I'll take
[55:59] care of it now he didn't know that
[56:03] man that man didn't know him there was
[56:07] nothing that he would gain at
[56:10] all from helping that
[56:13] man there was no motive there was no
[56:16] objective there was nothing uh uh uh
[56:20] there to to uh cause him to do that
[56:25] except that there was something inside
[56:27] of him that wanted to do right and
[56:31] wanted to do good and and at the bottom
[56:34] line of that what that man possessed was
[56:38] charity he possessed love he saw a need
[56:43] he knew he could do something about it
[56:45] and he went the extra mile oh look the
[56:48] story that we often hear uh about the
[56:52] the lady that was in the funeral
[56:55] possession for with her son and the that
[57:00] possession came down and she was wailing
[57:03] and crying it was her only son it was
[57:06] all that she had and she came across the
[57:09] path of of of the Lord and death and
[57:13] life came in Conflict they they came
[57:17] there and he was moved upon and and he
[57:21] stopped the posession and and he his
[57:25] desire was to her and her need I'm sure
[57:29] he saw the whole circumstance like I'm
[57:32] sure he saw the future I'm sure he saw
[57:34] the past and and he he was motivated by
[57:39] something that was inside of him to stop
[57:43] that possession and to look upon that
[57:46] lady and said daughter would thou like
[57:48] to receive thy son and and he raised her
[57:52] up and and he and the Lord Jesus brought
[57:56] her son back to life
[58:00] amen you know you never hear the rest of
[58:03] the
[58:04] story what that man went on how his life
[58:08] went on what she went on you know the
[58:11] whole story but I would say that their
[58:14] life was
[58:16] impacted their life was changed now
[58:19] we're all drawn to those
[58:20] stories and when when a man hears those
[58:24] stories Ries and he hears those works
[58:27] that Jesus did feeding the 5,000 feeding
[58:31] the
[58:32] 3,000 meeting the woman at the well
[58:35] talking to Nicodemus in the tree casting
[58:38] out Devils going to the pool of Bethesda
[58:41] isn't there something inside of you that
[58:43] says I'd like to be like
[58:46] that I'd like to have what he
[58:50] had that's the kind of that's the kind
[58:54] kind of person that I want to be and
[58:58] then when you hear his
[59:00] teachings and he says you know when
[59:04] someone smites thee in the cheek turn
[59:06] also to another if somebody offends you
[59:10] uh and even to 70 times in one day
[59:15] forgive them 70 times and can you you
[59:20] you realize that he is preaching a life
[59:25] amen that we don't have that's
[59:29] right there's a sharp
[59:32] contrast between this
[59:34] man and
[59:37] Mankind that's there was something if I
[59:41] could say this
[59:43] Supernatural amen about
[59:47] him that there was a
[59:50] difference about
[59:53] him I mean
[59:55] the
[59:57] kindness the the love the charity the
[1:00:01] meekness the
[1:00:03] humbleness uh uh
[1:00:06] just how he
[1:00:09] himself was moved upon that he wept when
[1:00:14] his friend died that that when he T when
[1:00:17] that Centurion came to
[1:00:19] him he he never vanished himself he
[1:00:23] never looked uh at himself and raised
[1:00:27] himself up that Centurion came to him he
[1:00:29] said
[1:00:31] master I I control many
[1:00:34] men I can say you go here and you go
[1:00:38] there and they do
[1:00:40] it now Jesus didn't
[1:00:43] say
[1:00:45] yes I'm like
[1:00:49] that right on
[1:00:53] brother no why
[1:00:56] him he says Master just speak the
[1:01:00] word and look what he did he never took
[1:01:03] the glory for that he said I've never
[1:01:06] seen such faith in all
[1:01:09] Israel he lifted that man up he gave
[1:01:13] that man the acknowledgement he gave
[1:01:16] that man the praise it was his faith
[1:01:18] your faith has done
[1:01:20] this you know that's marvelous I I I
[1:01:23] haven't even seen this in Israel and
[1:01:26] this is a Roman
[1:01:29] soldier and and and it moved
[1:01:33] him and and what was it that he
[1:01:40] possessed that allowed
[1:01:43] him to be like
[1:01:46] that now you say well he was God I I I
[1:01:51] want to stop a moment and remind you
[1:01:53] that he was a man like in US tempted in
[1:01:57] every way that we're
[1:02:03] tempted I I I would say
[1:02:07] that he was what he was because he was
[1:02:11] the love of God God so loved the world
[1:02:15] that he gave his only begotten son he
[1:02:18] was a the gift of God to us he he was
[1:02:23] there to
[1:02:25] to show us the
[1:02:29] way and we know that there was a sharp
[1:02:34] contrast between human
[1:02:37] nature and the nature of
[1:02:41] God I would say that this was the the
[1:02:45] first time though there was shadows and
[1:02:50] glimpses of this life through prophet
[1:02:54] prophecy there was a prophet one time
[1:02:57] that was a great
[1:02:59] prophet and one day some children came
[1:03:04] and and mocked
[1:03:07] them and called them old
[1:03:11] Baldhead you know and mocked what he did
[1:03:16] and made fun of them you know why they
[1:03:18] were doing that because that's what they
[1:03:19] heard at home that's what they saw their
[1:03:22] parents was doing that's the things that
[1:03:24] they were saying and going on you know
[1:03:27] one one thing you might say things but
[1:03:29] I'll tell you something your children
[1:03:30] will tell on
[1:03:33] you it'll show up in their attitudes
[1:03:36] it'll show up in the way that they do
[1:03:37] things it'll show up in uh in a lot of
[1:03:40] things and so here they come up to this
[1:03:43] prophet and they start mocking him and
[1:03:45] the prophet curses
[1:03:48] him and a she bear comes and slays them
[1:03:52] now a lot of people says oh that was God
[1:03:54] no that was an angry
[1:03:56] Prophet God honored his prophet's words
[1:04:00] just like he honored Moses's prophet's
[1:04:02] word so we saw glimpses and
[1:04:06] shadows of this
[1:04:09] nature in men that sought after God all
[1:04:14] down through time men were hungering for
[1:04:18] God they were trying to be Christlike if
[1:04:21] I could say that or please God through a
[1:04:24] set of rules through a law don't do this
[1:04:28] don't do that don't do this don't do
[1:04:30] that we were fellowshipping the other
[1:04:33] day my boys and I and and uh the
[1:04:36] scripture was brought up that if Israel
[1:04:39] would have kept the law and done
[1:04:42] everything that the law said to do the
[1:04:45] outside kingdoms would have looked at
[1:04:48] Israel and accounted that to them for
[1:04:53] wisdom that's right they would appear to
[1:04:56] been very wise very orderly very smart
[1:05:01] and and they would have gained the
[1:05:03] respect so we saw that we've never had a
[1:05:06] nature like
[1:05:09] this walking in the presence of men in
[1:05:16] flesh you understand that this this was
[1:05:20] a a uh uh the works that he did
[1:05:24] the words that he
[1:05:26] spoke not just his Works he even said if
[1:05:30] you can't believe my words believe me
[1:05:33] for my works for they testify of who
[1:05:37] that I am so the very works that he was
[1:05:40] doing was showing that the things that
[1:05:43] he was speaking was truth amen and
[1:05:46] people marveled and so no man ever spoke
[1:05:49] like this
[1:05:50] man could you imagine been there when he
[1:05:53] gave the message on the uh The Sermon on
[1:05:57] the Mount we've call it I've been to
[1:06:00] that place where they say that this is
[1:06:02] where he sat and spoke and there's a
[1:06:05] hill that goes out and down at the
[1:06:08] bottom of the hill was the trading route
[1:06:11] that they took and down along the Sea of
[1:06:13] Galilee and and he sat up on that hill
[1:06:17] and he began to teach the the things
[1:06:19] that he taught blessed are the meek
[1:06:23] blessed are The
[1:06:26] Peacemaker people are hearing these
[1:06:28] things what are they hearing they're
[1:06:30] hearing somebody
[1:06:32] preach a different
[1:06:36] nature they're hearing
[1:06:39] Supernatural
[1:06:42] thinking they're they're hearing
[1:06:45] thinking and a way a man can
[1:06:49] think if he's free from
[1:06:52] sin and free from
[1:06:55] unbelief how a man can
[1:06:58] act how he can treat
[1:07:02] others if he's free from the
[1:07:07] nature that he was born
[1:07:12] with so we're
[1:07:15] told that we're shaped in
[1:07:19] sin born in
[1:07:21] iniquity and come into the world
[1:07:24] speaking
[1:07:26] lies you will lie when the truth sounds
[1:07:30] better you're nature will lie children
[1:07:33] will
[1:07:35] lie for no
[1:07:39] reason you know I mean they could have
[1:07:42] cookie on their face and a Oreo cookie
[1:07:45] in their hand and mama say Johnny did
[1:07:50] did you did you get a cookie no Mommy
[1:07:56] well who did it I don't
[1:07:59] know I don't know there used to be a
[1:08:03] cartoon when I was a kid it was called I
[1:08:05] don't know it was you know this I don't
[1:08:08] know person that's doing all this stuff
[1:08:11] you know taking the toys out of the
[1:08:14] closet who took the toys out of the
[1:08:16] closet I don't know did
[1:08:20] it and and it's in our
[1:08:22] nature
[1:08:25] so this is what I I want to just
[1:08:28] establish for a moment this morning we
[1:08:31] have a
[1:08:33] nature by
[1:08:36] birth that's contrary to
[1:08:41] God and that's why we have the
[1:08:45] terminology and Jesus said you must be
[1:08:50] born
[1:08:52] again
[1:08:59] and it's a
[1:09:02] necessity if I could say it this way for
[1:09:06] uh that
[1:09:09] nature our human
[1:09:11] nature our carnal mind and our carnal
[1:09:16] reactions that's got to
[1:09:20] die
[1:09:22] and we know and I I want to try to keep
[1:09:26] it simple to to reach as many levels of
[1:09:30] Christianity as I can this morning but
[1:09:34] we know that we got that nature that
[1:09:37] that wasn't the nature that Adam and Eve
[1:09:40] had in the
[1:09:43] beginning in the beginning Adam had the
[1:09:46] same
[1:09:47] nature that Jesus had amen he was a son
[1:09:52] of God so he got his nature from his
[1:09:58] father is that right I mean that pretty
[1:10:02] basic I know the world tries to teach
[1:10:06] everybody that it was an
[1:10:09] apple you know well if people realize
[1:10:13] that they're
[1:10:15] naked by eating an apple I say let's
[1:10:19] start passing out apples instead of
[1:10:22] Bibles
[1:10:26] you know it's
[1:10:28] absurd but if if they they didn't come
[1:10:31] to this realization and we talked about
[1:10:34] this and I won't go into this in depth I
[1:10:36] hope you try to listen to the sermons as
[1:10:38] they come and build it in your own life
[1:10:42] but we understood by the law of the seed
[1:10:44] that everything has to come forth of its
[1:10:46] own kind and if Satan was going to build
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:52] kingdom he had to have something that
[1:10:55] would reproduce itself that's right you
[1:10:58] understand because there there there was
[1:11:00] a law that every seed would come forth
[1:11:04] of its kind so he knew that he had to
[1:11:08] somehow interject his
[1:11:11] thinking his
[1:11:13] nature his seed into the human race in
[1:11:19] order for the human race to bring forth
[1:11:22] after his
[1:11:25] kind and so if if Satan would have never
[1:11:29] fallen and Adam and Eve would have never
[1:11:32] left the garden we all would have been
[1:11:35] born into the garden that's right that's
[1:11:39] we wouldn't have civilization out here
[1:11:42] we wouldn't have downtown Dallas and la
[1:11:45] and and the Eiffel Tower and the and all
[1:11:50] these what great things that man calls a
[1:11:53] Chie ments no we would have been born
[1:11:56] and grew up in the
[1:11:59] garden now can you think of
[1:12:02] that and because we're the Sons and
[1:12:05] Daughters of God that's where we're
[1:12:07] wanting to go back to is Back to Eden we
[1:12:11] want to go back to where we belong and
[1:12:14] where we came from and we're in a
[1:12:17] terrible
[1:12:18] detour down
[1:12:21] here and that detour was caused by sin
[1:12:26] it was caused by Eve
[1:12:31] allowing that seed of
[1:12:34] Satan to come into her life thinking
[1:12:41] that she would gain power and knowledge
[1:12:44] to become like
[1:12:46] God she believed Satan's lie as God's
[1:12:51] truth therefore she was
[1:12:55] beguiled and and and and she said well
[1:12:58] the Satan Satan lied to me and then when
[1:13:02] she brought this to Adam Adam had a
[1:13:05] choice he could have divorced her right
[1:13:09] then and she would have
[1:13:11] perished but Adam had that attribute in
[1:13:15] him you understand cuz he was a Son of
[1:13:19] God and and Eve was
[1:13:22] his you understand Eve was his it was
[1:13:25] bone of his bone flesh of his body it
[1:13:28] was a part of him his feminine part now
[1:13:31] was in her and there was a part of him
[1:13:34] that couldn't forsake
[1:13:37] her couldn't leave her he had so when
[1:13:41] when when when the when the death
[1:13:44] sentence was upon
[1:13:46] her because the there the day you eat
[1:13:50] thereof is the day you
[1:13:52] die
[1:13:54] so he knew that the death sentence was
[1:13:57] upon
[1:13:59] her but because that was
[1:14:05] his he had a
[1:14:08] promise he said I'll put enity between
[1:14:11] thy seed and the Serpent's Seed and it
[1:14:14] was based on that promise that he went
[1:14:17] out knowing that God would redeem
[1:14:22] him and now he was going forth and we
[1:14:25] begin to see the pollution of the seed
[1:14:29] there was Cain and
[1:14:31] Abel Abel was Adam's son Cain was
[1:14:35] Satan's
[1:14:39] son
[1:14:41] twins every Revival produces
[1:14:45] twins produces two kinds two
[1:14:50] natures and there it was there she was
[1:14:52] laid out out there and Adam trusted that
[1:14:57] that one day that enity would come
[1:15:01] between those
[1:15:05] natures and finally that one that was
[1:15:09] free from that nature showed
[1:15:14] up and it was Jesus Christ the second
[1:15:18] Adam amen the Son of God we could follow
[1:15:22] all the history I don't know why it took
[1:15:26] God so long but it wasn't long to
[1:15:31] God a day like a thousand years is but a
[1:15:35] day to
[1:15:36] God be patient on God he's always on
[1:15:41] time so it it he comes down to the great
[1:15:44] this great spot and all of a sudden he
[1:15:47] shows
[1:15:48] up the second
[1:15:50] Adam free from sin
[1:15:55] now
[1:15:56] tempted but
[1:16:01] free he didn't have the
[1:16:04] nature that man
[1:16:07] had he had the nature of
[1:16:10] God he had the love of God because God
[1:16:14] is
[1:16:16] love so that that's what he
[1:16:21] possessed he possessed a pure
[1:16:25] unadulterated Divine love
[1:16:30] amen in fact the scripture itself
[1:16:33] expresses it that God so loved the world
[1:16:37] he gave his only begotten son and the
[1:16:40] son himself said I do nothing unless the
[1:16:44] father reveals it to me I only do that
[1:16:48] which the father tells me to do these
[1:16:51] are not my works
[1:16:53] but they're The Works of the father that
[1:16:56] dwelleth in me who among you can find
[1:16:59] any evil in me or sin in me show me what
[1:17:03] I've done and when they finally came to
[1:17:06] the very thing that they thought that he
[1:17:09] had done that was worthy of death it was
[1:17:13] that he said that him and the father
[1:17:16] were
[1:17:19] one you
[1:17:21] blaspheme because you say before Abraham
[1:17:24] was I
[1:17:26] am oh Hallelujah there was that life
[1:17:30] back with us now that's what we want
[1:17:35] just to go down this morning just a
[1:17:38] little bit with you on some
[1:17:43] ABCs what is ABC always believe Christ
[1:17:47] we also refer to that as basic simple
[1:17:51] things that are the foundation for
[1:17:56] everything because you can get way off
[1:17:59] Way Off
[1:18:02] Track and religion you've got to
[1:18:04] remember religion is a
[1:18:07] covering religion covers up what you
[1:18:11] don't
[1:18:14] possess you've got to wrap yourself in
[1:18:17] something so nobody can see what's
[1:18:21] really on the inside
[1:18:24] but we're not interested in fixing the
[1:18:27] outside God works from the inside out we
[1:18:31] want to fix that
[1:18:32] heart we want the mind to be in us that
[1:18:36] was in Christ Jesus we want to think
[1:18:39] like he thinks we want to walk like he
[1:18:42] walks we want to talk what he how he
[1:18:44] talks and then the question is how can
[1:18:47] we become like
[1:18:51] this I'm I am stuck with n by
[1:18:56] Nature with desires of the
[1:19:02] Flesh in fact the scripture said that
[1:19:05] this nature that I was born with that I
[1:19:08] got from Adam and Eve it rules this
[1:19:12] member that's
[1:19:14] right so much so I do things that I
[1:19:17] wouldn't even want to
[1:19:20] do as you know uh that as I grew up I I
[1:19:25] I had a
[1:19:27] temper and and an out of control temper
[1:19:31] is a form of
[1:19:35] insanity where I would get so
[1:19:38] mad at the littlest things that I would
[1:19:42] become
[1:19:44] irrational I would say things do things
[1:19:47] throw things yell scream break things
[1:19:51] you know I'd break you if I could
[1:19:55] just you you just sit back and say this
[1:19:58] kid's
[1:20:00] insane but it was in my nature I don't
[1:20:03] know how it came there well I could I
[1:20:05] could track it all the way back to the
[1:20:11] devil I could honestly say the devil
[1:20:14] made me do it though I will say this a
[1:20:17] lot of us do stupid things that Satan
[1:20:20] wouldn't take any credit for
[1:20:29] but I'm I have this
[1:20:33] nature that it's
[1:20:37] uncontrollable it's Springs
[1:20:40] up it causes me to go after things do
[1:20:44] things say things repeat things uh that
[1:20:48] are totally totally unedifying don't
[1:20:53] help anybody don't even help
[1:20:57] me you know gossip never helps
[1:21:00] anybody but you know who gossip hurts
[1:21:03] more than the person that's being talked
[1:21:06] about is the person that's
[1:21:09] gossiping you gossip you lose all
[1:21:16] credibility you you you you lose the
[1:21:19] trust of those that are around you you
[1:21:22] you lose the respect of those that are
[1:21:25] around
[1:21:27] you and it takes one word the tongue is
[1:21:31] an unruly member and bitter and sweet
[1:21:34] can't come forth from the same
[1:21:37] Fountain no matter how much you're
[1:21:40] pressed to talk about
[1:21:42] somebody or to State your
[1:21:44] case or to make sure that everybody
[1:21:47] knows your side of the story may I say
[1:21:51] this peace be be still be still God will
[1:21:56] fight your battle if you're right God
[1:21:59] will take care of it truth will prevail
[1:22:03] you don't have to defend
[1:22:06] yourself you don't you don't have to put
[1:22:08] such a great effort out to for everybody
[1:22:12] to hear your side of the
[1:22:14] story because I guarantee you you invite
[1:22:18] you give your side of the story you're
[1:22:21] inviting somebody else to give their
[1:22:23] side of the story and when they give
[1:22:25] your their side of the story you won't
[1:22:28] look so Rosy
[1:22:32] pink they will slander you they will
[1:22:36] cover you with mud they would point out
[1:22:39] faults that you didn't think anybody
[1:22:41] else saw don't get into
[1:22:47] it don't fall for
[1:22:51] it don't don't don't become instant
[1:22:53] marriage counselors and instant
[1:22:57] financial
[1:22:58] counselors believe me you're basing
[1:23:01] everything and every decision that
[1:23:04] you're making on
[1:23:07] hearsay if you would take it back to
[1:23:09] this 13th
[1:23:11] chapter and the scripture says speaketh
[1:23:14] no
[1:23:15] evil vanishes not takes no re doesn't
[1:23:19] rejoice in iniquity you would stop in
[1:23:22] your tracks right there say I'm sorry
[1:23:25] friend I'm not going to go down that
[1:23:27] road that's my brother that's my sister
[1:23:30] God knows God will take care of
[1:23:36] it he's in
[1:23:40] control so we find out we've got a
[1:23:44] nature and we definitely
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:49] need a nature change praise the Lord
[1:23:53] and therefore Jesus says You must be
[1:23:59] born
[1:24:03] again
[1:24:05] and what we refer
[1:24:08] to many
[1:24:11] times
[1:24:14] is as being borned again as receiving
[1:24:18] the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:20] Spirit now there's two types of
[1:24:25] Christians there's the Christian that
[1:24:28] believe reads this
[1:24:30] word believes what it
[1:24:33] says and with everything in him tries to
[1:24:38] keep and obey the
[1:24:42] rules you say brother McGary is there a
[1:24:45] reward for that I would say
[1:24:50] yes it's a good way to live
[1:24:53] live and it produces
[1:24:57] benefits and then there's a Christian
[1:25:00] that does that but is Born Again
[1:25:04] hallu is Born
[1:25:07] Again words there's a Christian that
[1:25:10] has received the Holy
[1:25:16] Spirit and and I I just want to tck on
[1:25:20] this
[1:25:21] fundamentally real quickly this morning
[1:25:23] I've already already been longer than I
[1:25:26] wanted but we know there's a need for us
[1:25:30] to be
[1:25:32] free from the nature that we
[1:25:37] have okay so being a Christian isn't
[1:25:40] controlling your
[1:25:42] nature though we do all that we can to
[1:25:45] bring our body and subjection we do that
[1:25:48] by
[1:25:49] wisdom in other words if you touch the
[1:25:53] fire what happens you get burnt you
[1:25:57] should be able to know that without a
[1:25:59] move of the
[1:26:00] spirit that's
[1:26:03] right you should know the Bible says two
[1:26:06] don't walk together unless they
[1:26:08] agree that we don't keep company with
[1:26:14] Sinners right we don't have the
[1:26:16] appearance of
[1:26:17] evil all those things you can do and we
[1:26:21] should
[1:26:22] do and it's our reasonable service to do
[1:26:26] those
[1:26:27] things and that gives the appearance of
[1:26:31] Christianity but it doesn't mean that
[1:26:34] you've been born
[1:26:36] again it means that you recognize what's
[1:26:39] right and you're doing everything you
[1:26:42] can to bring yourself under subjection
[1:26:45] to the word of God and be a good person
[1:26:49] that's
[1:26:51] admirable
[1:26:52] and I believe if a person does that that
[1:26:57] will it will lead them to the New
[1:27:03] Birth because they'll get
[1:27:06] thirsty and they'll come to the point
[1:27:08] one day they'll find out though I want
[1:27:10] to do that which is good I do evil
[1:27:13] that's right when I do what I want to do
[1:27:17] that's right I do what I don't want to
[1:27:20] do and they find them
[1:27:22] eles in that
[1:27:26] place and the Lord knew
[1:27:29] that so he said I'll not leave you
[1:27:32] comfortless but I'll come again and I'll
[1:27:35] be with you even in you I'd like to read
[1:27:40] a statement if you don't
[1:27:43] mind and this is from what is the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost and it simply says this
[1:27:52] upon this place we wish to approach the
[1:27:56] subject which I think is the outstanding
[1:28:01] subject of today amen and I think it's
[1:28:05] become a great
[1:28:07] confusion in the church what the Holy
[1:28:11] Ghost is and what the evidence of it is
[1:28:17] and what how we know that we have it
[1:28:24] and so if it's a
[1:28:26] requirement then naturally we want the
[1:28:30] requirement and our human nature would
[1:28:33] be to produce the requirement
[1:28:44] ourself so if you know it's like if I
[1:28:48] could say this it's like coming up with
[1:28:50] a fake ID
[1:28:55] you've all been raised right but I
[1:28:57] wasn't so if I wanted to go to a concert
[1:29:00] I'd Forge a
[1:29:02] ticket you know we get fake driver's
[1:29:05] license and everything what would we
[1:29:08] have to do we'd have to fake our
[1:29:12] identity we'd have to pretend we knew
[1:29:15] something we
[1:29:18] didn't you know come up well I'm with
[1:29:21] the band
[1:29:23] or I'm with the
[1:29:26] team I pulled up one place and the guys
[1:29:28] thought we were the ESPN broadcasters
[1:29:32] they open the gate for me and they
[1:29:33] parked me in the spot and open the door
[1:29:36] and I'm up with
[1:29:38] ESPN wo this is pretty good and
[1:29:40] something inside of me said liar liar
[1:29:43] pants on
[1:29:47] fire so I simply walked out of there
[1:29:50] before I showed up on Nation
[1:29:54] TV and went to my little place to watch
[1:29:57] the person that I wanted to talk
[1:30:02] to we don't want
[1:30:06] fake okay we don't want religion we
[1:30:10] don't want a false front we we don't
[1:30:13] want everybody to think we are something
[1:30:15] we're
[1:30:16] not we want to be real we want to be
[1:30:20] genuine so it's a great subject of today
[1:30:24] how many would say it's a a great
[1:30:25] subject of today a
[1:30:28] question and in every generation comes
[1:30:32] up to this
[1:30:33] question so I mean you know I'm 75 years
[1:30:38] old this year October 27th so you don't
[1:30:45] forget I've battled all these
[1:30:48] questions do you think they go away
[1:30:52] every time that I do something I don't
[1:30:55] want to do you don't think Satan's right
[1:30:57] on my shoulder saying you don't have the
[1:30:59] Holy
[1:31:03] Ghost well I I settled
[1:31:06] it I just simply say to him ABA father
[1:31:12] amen right he's faithful and just if you
[1:31:16] sin you confess your sin it goes before
[1:31:19] you we cry ABA father because he's just
[1:31:23] and faithful to forgive us I don't go
[1:31:25] rebuild my Christianity over one mistake
[1:31:28] I settle
[1:31:30] it I settle
[1:31:33] it the flesh Wars against the spirit the
[1:31:37] spirit Wars against the flesh these are
[1:31:39] two country he
[1:31:42] says upon the the I think the most
[1:31:45] outstanding subject of today of the word
[1:31:49] what is the Holy Spirit
[1:31:53] now listen to this because this is very
[1:31:57] beautiful what is
[1:32:01] it is it an
[1:32:05] anointing that falls from the
[1:32:08] sky and gets on
[1:32:12] you and you feel
[1:32:15] it and it causes you to uh dance or
[1:32:21] speak in tongues or
[1:32:26] prophesy Paul stopped for a moment and
[1:32:30] he said you can do all these things
[1:32:32] that's
[1:32:34] right and it's nothing that's
[1:32:37] right so the holy spirit is
[1:32:41] something you understand it's not a myth
[1:32:44] it's not an anointing it is a
[1:32:47] substance it is a reality it is a POS
[1:32:51] possession it's something you can know
[1:32:55] that you've
[1:32:59] got it has an
[1:33:02] everlasting
[1:33:04] effect that's why in the scriptures it's
[1:33:07] re referred to as a
[1:33:09] seal until the day of your Redemption
[1:33:13] when you've got the Holy Ghost you've
[1:33:15] got it it don't come it don't go it
[1:33:19] don't leave now you may grieve it away
[1:33:22] but I'll guarantee you it'll be on that
[1:33:25] limb calling to you calling to you
[1:33:28] calling to you to come under repentance
[1:33:30] it'll make you so miserable you'll find
[1:33:33] a closet someday and you'll beg for its
[1:33:36] return
[1:33:40] Hall cuz you can't live without
[1:33:44] it you can't live without it amen amen
[1:33:48] so what we're just going to
[1:33:50] Simply
[1:33:52] say these few little things I have taken
[1:33:56] the subject in line like this you cannot
[1:34:01] come and receive the Holy Spirit unless
[1:34:07] you know what it
[1:34:13] is a lot of people want the Holy Ghost
[1:34:18] they go to a meeting the preachings of
[1:34:22] Evangelistic everybody's there they're
[1:34:24] fired
[1:34:25] up and the presence of the Lord sweeps
[1:34:29] through the
[1:34:31] place and people start falling out in
[1:34:35] the spirit I'm not against any of those
[1:34:36] things I've done those things I've
[1:34:38] probably spoken tongues more than you
[1:34:41] all that's a
[1:34:49] quote and you want that that you say I
[1:34:53] want
[1:34:55] that well that's not what it
[1:34:59] is it may be an effect of it it may be a
[1:35:02] result it may be a rain falling it may
[1:35:06] be
[1:35:08] momentarily but it's not what it is to
[1:35:11] be born
[1:35:14] again it's not what it is to have the
[1:35:18] Holy
[1:35:19] Spirit so can until you know what it
[1:35:23] is you can't receive it unless you know
[1:35:26] what it
[1:35:27] is and you cannot receive it if you know
[1:35:31] what it is unless you believe it's given
[1:35:37] to
[1:35:40] you so even after you know what it
[1:35:43] is you've got to know it's given to
[1:35:48] you A lot of people want it
[1:35:52] but they're still wai in the balance of
[1:35:54] whether it's for them whether they're
[1:35:57] worthy whether they should get it what's
[1:35:59] it going to do they know it's real I
[1:36:02] know what that
[1:36:03] is and I believe I know what it is but
[1:36:06] you can't receive it until you think
[1:36:09] it's for you most
[1:36:12] people that's where he stops
[1:36:14] them and that's why we spent such a a
[1:36:19] time last week expr in to you
[1:36:23] justification until you totally realize
[1:36:27] you've never did it in the first place
[1:36:29] you will not be able to go on with God
[1:36:32] until you know your sins are forgiven
[1:36:35] and that Jesus Christ paid the price for
[1:36:37] your sins and the chastisement of of
[1:36:40] your peace was upon him and by his
[1:36:43] stripes you're healed you must know
[1:36:49] it for those you that this is paragraph
[1:36:54] 22 it says unless you know what it is
[1:36:58] and you canot receive it if you know
[1:37:01] what it is unless you believe it's given
[1:37:03] to you and it's for
[1:37:08] you so it can be
[1:37:11] offered until you accept that part of
[1:37:14] it and
[1:37:16] then you cannot know whether you've got
[1:37:20] it or not unless you know what results
[1:37:26] it
[1:37:29] brings think of
[1:37:33] that I wondered why the prophet of God
[1:37:36] so
[1:37:39] early built this Foundation into his
[1:37:43] ministry now I personally believe it's
[1:37:45] the wisdom of God that that Ministry was
[1:37:48] totally in
[1:37:49] the hands of God and God was building a
[1:37:54] message he was laying it Brick by Brick
[1:37:57] Stone by Stone he was introducing to the
[1:38:01] church F storing food in the storehouse
[1:38:05] knowing that it would be called upon
[1:38:07] according to
[1:38:11] need so there there's there there's milk
[1:38:15] in this doorhouse
[1:38:18] there's meat in the storehouse
[1:38:22] you can't always be preaching T-bone
[1:38:24] steaks your babies will
[1:38:30] die you know you got to have a full
[1:38:33] gospel and the scripture says unless you
[1:38:36] become like Little Children You shall
[1:38:38] not enter the kingdom of God some of us
[1:38:41] neglect the child in
[1:38:44] us the youth in US of the word of God we
[1:38:48] we come to some imagination that were
[1:38:50] theolog and we understand all Mysteries
[1:38:53] and and and we know the seals and we
[1:38:56] know predestination and we know the
[1:38:59] great Union and and we studied it all
[1:39:03] and then the very Simplicity of Charity
[1:39:06] and good works and laying a pattern of
[1:39:09] Good Works in our life is gone and what
[1:39:12] are we we're tinkling symbols we're
[1:39:14] sounding brass and what we've got
[1:39:16] vanishes away in other words it vanish
[1:39:19] away means there Comes A Time is not
[1:39:26] useful can you imagine walking up to a
[1:39:30] person lying sick and say I want you to
[1:39:34] know the first horse
[1:39:39] rider
[1:39:41] no I like that Soldier remember that
[1:39:46] little boy you know when the lightning
[1:39:47] was flashing and and and Mama coming in
[1:39:51] the room and the boy was all scared and
[1:39:54] he he he and she says oh son don't worry
[1:39:57] she says Jesus will take care and he
[1:39:59] says mama I I like Jesus In the
[1:40:06] Flesh you know the guy that was dying on
[1:40:09] the
[1:40:10] battlefield and the chaplain come up and
[1:40:13] the old Catholic chaplain come up and
[1:40:15] knelt down he said hell Mary uh Mother
[1:40:19] of God full of grace and he said wait a
[1:40:22] minute he says I'm dying I don't want no
[1:40:27] secretary Hallelujah get me to the main
[1:40:39] guy is that when un let you know the
[1:40:42] results it brings so if you know what it
[1:40:45] is and who it is and what action it
[1:40:50] brings when it it comes then you'll know
[1:40:53] what you've got when you got it see
[1:40:59] that's just would settle
[1:41:04] it
[1:41:06] right he says now I said brother
[1:41:09] jeffes if you sent me down to turn off
[1:41:13] your oil well and I didn't know nothing
[1:41:16] about it I'd probably blow it up I might
[1:41:20] turn the wrong key and or start the
[1:41:23] wrong motor I'd have to know how to do
[1:41:27] it before I did it and that's the way
[1:41:31] with receiving the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:41:33] to know what you're coming for and how
[1:41:36] to receive it and what it
[1:41:47] is I want just going to read a few
[1:41:49] things I just want to settle this kind
[1:41:52] of Simply this
[1:41:54] morning this is paragraph 53 now before
[1:41:58] we read it i' just like to say a
[1:42:01] few uh commenting words here what is the
[1:42:05] Holy Ghost it's a
[1:42:08] seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:42:13] covenant it's an agreement hallelujah
[1:42:16] it's a covenant it's a
[1:42:18] seal so it's all these things
[1:42:21] right what is the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:42:27] sign it's a sign it's a seal it's a
[1:42:31] covenant you can study each one of those
[1:42:34] things
[1:42:35] out what is the Holy Ghost then it's the
[1:42:41] spirit of Jesus Christ in
[1:42:49] you
[1:42:51] that sums it up amen it's not an
[1:42:54] anointing
[1:42:59] outside and with the presence of Jesus
[1:43:03] Christ comes everything that Jesus
[1:43:07] is he's
[1:43:09] unchanging he's a
[1:43:11] deliverer he's a
[1:43:14] savior he's he's a a a a a a Healer and
[1:43:19] a counselor he's the Prince of Peace
[1:43:21] he's the Mighty God so where he is all
[1:43:25] his attributes
[1:43:28] are
[1:43:30] hallelujah it's not one little
[1:43:32] outpouring here and one little
[1:43:35] outpouring here the holy spirit is the
[1:43:38] spirit of Jesus Christ in you now what
[1:43:43] does that Spirit do what did we just say
[1:43:46] it was it's a
[1:43:48] nature it's the nature natur of God it's
[1:43:52] the personality of God it's God
[1:43:57] himself was in human form in Jesus
[1:44:00] Christ he paid the price of Calvary he
[1:44:05] went and told them go in the upper room
[1:44:08] until you're endued with power from on
[1:44:11] high what was Jesus's power it was his
[1:44:19] nature
[1:44:21] it was the love that he possessed for
[1:44:25] the world
[1:44:27] Amen it was his recognition of Satan at
[1:44:31] every one of his
[1:44:32] tricks you say his power no his power
[1:44:35] was in the word it is written it is
[1:44:38] written it is
[1:44:43] written his power was his nature right
[1:44:47] true and that's why Paul says you can do
[1:44:49] all kinds of mirac Miracles you can do
[1:44:51] all these things but if you don't have
[1:44:53] the nature of Jesus Christ it's
[1:44:58] unprofitable there's people that heal
[1:45:00] for
[1:45:06] money you want to get in certain
[1:45:08] people's prayer
[1:45:10] lines let's say you wanted brother Benny
[1:45:13] Hinn to pray for you you say do people
[1:45:15] get healed in his ministry of course
[1:45:17] they
[1:45:19] do
[1:45:21] when they fall out is it real sure it
[1:45:26] is but they're not going to let you walk
[1:45:28] up on that
[1:45:31] platform unless you're
[1:45:35] invested unless you're expecting
[1:45:37] something to
[1:45:38] happen that's
[1:45:40] right you get
[1:45:44] pre-qualified so they come and they talk
[1:45:46] to
[1:45:47] you and they want you to give a seat
[1:45:55] offering are you willing to give $10,000
[1:45:58] to this ministry or $5,000 to this
[1:46:02] ministry or 2,000 or are you willing you
[1:46:05] believe enough in
[1:46:07] this that you would plant something in
[1:46:12] it and and
[1:46:14] sure they they've given they're
[1:46:17] expecting they they've they've covered
[1:46:19] their bases
[1:46:21] and they go up and they get touched or
[1:46:23] they fall over or they get healed and
[1:46:25] what does it do it profits them
[1:46:35] nothing what
[1:46:37] good does it do if a man gains the whole
[1:46:42] world and loses his
[1:46:44] soul what is the prophet and I'm not
[1:46:48] talking prophetic prophet as in a
[1:46:51] prophet messenger I'm talking Prophet as
[1:46:54] in a a
[1:46:56] gain what is the prophet of
[1:47:00] Christianity it's the
[1:47:03] resurrection it's the
[1:47:08] Rapture what good does it do you if you
[1:47:11] miss
[1:47:14] that if your body's not
[1:47:19] quickened well what if you have all the
[1:47:21] recognition and all the spirituality and
[1:47:24] everybody thinks you're great and
[1:47:26] everybody loves your personality and and
[1:47:30] and and you you you you've you've laid
[1:47:33] hands on the sick and you've done all
[1:47:35] these great things and and he'll come
[1:47:38] and say I never knew
[1:47:40] you in other words there was no
[1:47:44] identity of myself in you praise the
[1:47:47] Lord there was nothing I could connect
[1:47:50] with
[1:47:51] you did all these things but you did
[1:47:53] them on your own
[1:47:54] valtion you did them by your own
[1:47:58] understanding and and you say well I got
[1:48:01] results you know what he'll say to you
[1:48:03] I'm true to my word that's right
[1:48:07] amen God's already healed if someone
[1:48:10] gets you to accept your healing you've
[1:48:13] accepted your healing you can give that
[1:48:15] man all the credit you want but the
[1:48:17] credit goes to
[1:48:19] Calvary
[1:48:23] amen that's where the credit
[1:48:26] goes cuz it's a finished
[1:48:35] work he said a little while said Jesus
[1:48:39] and the world seeth me no more yet ye
[1:48:42] shall see me for I will be with you even
[1:48:46] in you till the end of the world
[1:48:50] and and so we we find out that we we
[1:48:53] fail to stay with the
[1:48:59] basics the holy spirit being born again
[1:49:04] is a change of nature you got a nature
[1:49:09] from your natural
[1:49:12] birth I don't care how saintly and godly
[1:49:17] your parents
[1:49:19] are
[1:49:21] Lesley is one of the most Godly women
[1:49:23] I've ever
[1:49:25] met she just she she remembers people's
[1:49:29] birthdays you know she reminds me every
[1:49:32] day this is this brother's birthday this
[1:49:33] is this brother's birthday I'm sitting
[1:49:35] in my heart saying what do I
[1:49:39] care the old guy's just getting older
[1:49:43] and we're all going to die anyway and
[1:49:44] what difference that
[1:49:47] made she no no you this guy's been
[1:49:49] faithful to you you you call them and
[1:49:51] let him know you
[1:49:52] know and and you
[1:49:57] know and and if she reads her Bible
[1:50:00] Every Morning has her devotions sits
[1:50:03] down listens to a tape gets out in the
[1:50:06] backyard probably knowing she has to
[1:50:09] pray me through so if I don't do
[1:50:11] something
[1:50:15] disastrous and as Godly as she
[1:50:19] was she produced three Renegade
[1:50:30] boys I'm a witness if you if you want me
[1:50:34] to vindicate that statement I got to
[1:50:36] list this
[1:50:40] long so we find out that it's not
[1:50:45] something that's passed
[1:50:48] on okay it requires a what a
[1:50:55] birth a
[1:50:57] birth to be born again means to have a
[1:51:03] change of
[1:51:06] nature how do you know you have it what
[1:51:10] is the
[1:51:11] result of the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:51:16] coming in
[1:51:17] you it changes your
[1:51:22] nature it changes the way you think it
[1:51:26] changes the way you treat people it
[1:51:29] changes the way you talk and you notice
[1:51:35] it you know the
[1:51:39] difference it takes the
[1:51:42] tempter from the inside dwelling to the
[1:51:47] outside trying to get back in
[1:51:52] to where you did things
[1:51:54] by the the Natural Spirit of man
[1:51:59] instinctly you just do it you wouldn't
[1:52:02] think it through there was no check in
[1:52:05] you you just did it you didn't like
[1:52:08] somebody you just did it you cursed you
[1:52:10] cursed you told lies you you done you
[1:52:13] lusted after this you lusted after that
[1:52:15] you had
[1:52:17] you no regard
[1:52:20] for your
[1:52:24] soul and then maybe a word come by you
[1:52:28] or the spirit begin to call on you and
[1:52:30] all of a sudden you started to realize
[1:52:32] there's something wrong with this guy
[1:52:34] and this isn't taking me nowhere maybe
[1:52:36] you even heard the wages of sin as
[1:52:40] death and maybe you became conscious of
[1:52:42] a life after however God dealt with you
[1:52:46] there came a time that you begin to
[1:52:48] realize the life in the nature you were
[1:52:51] living was
[1:52:55] terrible
[1:52:57] hu and you wanted to be
[1:53:04] different and you wanted to
[1:53:07] receive something different so what is
[1:53:11] it that you want to receive so we know
[1:53:14] this by teaching I'm just not going to
[1:53:15] go into it but you can have the
[1:53:18] anointing of the Holy Spirit and never
[1:53:20] have your nature
[1:53:25] changed you can have the Holy Spirit on
[1:53:27] you every day of your life and still go
[1:53:30] to
[1:53:32] hell it's not the anointing that we're
[1:53:35] interested it that comes and go as God's
[1:53:38] permits but it's the nature change that
[1:53:41] we must
[1:53:44] have we must become new creatures in
[1:53:48] Christ Jesus
[1:53:54] we start putting away carnal things we
[1:53:57] put away the carnal mind we put away
[1:54:00] carnal thinking we bring this flesh
[1:54:03] under subjection we have a new nature a
[1:54:07] new spirit there's something else living
[1:54:10] inside of us and it's summed up in a
[1:54:13] very simple
[1:54:14] scripture two scriptures would would you
[1:54:17] turn to uh John 13 I think it's verse
[1:54:22] 6 and I'll turn this down and the the
[1:54:25] the scripture is simply if the same
[1:54:30] spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell
[1:54:34] in you it will Quicken your mortal
[1:54:40] bodies thank you Lord now we all want to
[1:54:43] go forward with God isn't really what we
[1:54:46] want to become into that Perfection when
[1:54:49] that which is perfect is come we we
[1:54:51] wanted we want to that's where we're
[1:54:54] what we're going to we can study the
[1:54:57] church all the way down Through the Ages
[1:55:00] can't we and and and we can we we follow
[1:55:05] the spirit up through Luther up
[1:55:09] justification up through sanctification
[1:55:12] up to the Holy Ghost and now we're
[1:55:14] coming to a
[1:55:15] Capstone and he says this he said in
[1:55:18] paragraph 4 now the spirit of God has
[1:55:22] worked under
[1:55:24] justification it is in the last days
[1:55:28] performing and doing the very same
[1:55:30] things that it
[1:55:32] did when it was in Christ what is it the
[1:55:37] church in Christ has
[1:55:40] become
[1:55:43] one that's right the bride and the
[1:55:47] bridegroom have become one amen their
[1:55:50] natures and desires have become one what
[1:55:53] is the whole secret of
[1:55:56] marriage it's the wife's desire is
[1:56:00] towards her
[1:56:04] husband not towards social living not
[1:56:08] towards Freedom not towards being the
[1:56:11] kind of wife that she wants or what she
[1:56:16] thinks her her desire now becomes
[1:56:20] towards your
[1:56:22] husband they become
[1:56:25] one that's what she's made
[1:56:29] for now she got a different program that
[1:56:33] guy's better off on the
[1:56:38] roof because there'll be no
[1:56:41] peace can you imagine a
[1:56:45] church this desires not to him
[1:56:50] it's not to be like him it's not to be
[1:56:53] for
[1:56:55] him but it it comes to teach their
[1:56:58] Doctrine to teach their Creeds to teach
[1:57:01] their do dogmas to collect their money
[1:57:03] to further their program to get more
[1:57:06] members to build bigger buildings to
[1:57:09] have greater
[1:57:10] influence to have some great big show
[1:57:13] that makes it look like God's with us
[1:57:15] look at all this God's with us God's
[1:57:17] here God's there no
[1:57:20] one thing counts one thing only you must
[1:57:25] be born again I didn't say
[1:57:29] Anointed The Mystery of this day is how
[1:57:33] you can receive the nature of Jesus
[1:57:36] Christ without
[1:57:41] sensation your nature
[1:57:44] changes all the things that you were all
[1:57:47] of a sudden you don't want to be
[1:57:50] did did your outside body change
[1:57:54] no it's going to get
[1:57:57] changed but your Nature's changed your
[1:58:00] outlooks changed your thoughts have
[1:58:02] changed you're a new creature in Christ
[1:58:05] Jesus you live by the word your ear is
[1:58:09] inclined to his word you pray if you
[1:58:12] start down the same road that Spirit
[1:58:16] that's in you Christ in you he checks
[1:58:18] you

[1:58:22] to him who's within you he that is in
[1:58:25] you is greater in the world
[1:58:28] Lorden we first of all got to break this
[1:58:31] idea that the holy spirit is something
[1:58:33] that's on the outside it's something
[1:58:36] that's in US it abides in US it lives in
[1:58:40] us it's him Christ in US is the hope of
[1:58:46] glory and if the same spirit that was in
[1:58:49] in him the same nature that was in him
[1:58:52] being you it will also Quicken your
[1:58:55] mortal body

[1:59:35] unbelief it leads you and guides you
[1:59:37] into all truth and righteousness you

[2:04:06] sanctification a little deeper shadow of
[2:04:09] it the Holy Ghost by baptism of it a
[2:04:14] deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost by the
[2:04:17] restoration of its very person being in
[2:04:27] here that's when it's perfect

[2:04:52] jump jump to
[2:04:54] it but I I'll see if I can find
[2:05:00] it the one I'm looking for is simply
[2:05:03] this it says I give you a new
[2:05:15] commandment I used to know all these
[2:05:17] scriptures by heart I just can't believe
[2:05:19] that I'm I'm failing the scripture says

[2:05:24] commandment yes here it is St John

[2:05:36] this a new commandment I give unto
[2:05:41] you that ye love one
[2:05:45] another as I have loved you

[2:07:11] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[2:07:15] father before the beginning the same as

[2:08:45] time and I've probably been down more
[2:08:48] wrong roads than
[2:08:53] right if all the times I had to tell the
[2:08:55] Lord I'm sorry it would fill this room
[2:08:58] and the building next door and ever and
[2:09:02] ever there's never one thing I'll
[2:09:06] forget I'll never forget the
[2:09:09] chains that I was
[2:09:11] in when I was in that hippie State under
[2:09:16] the influence of drugs and under the
[2:09:18] influence of Satan and the
[2:09:22] bitterness and the hatred that I had in
[2:09:25] my
[2:09:26] heart I was so full of
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:31] hate I could slit your throat and not
[2:09:34] drop a
[2:09:37] tear you might not see that in me
[2:09:42] now but I wanted to join the Hell's
[2:09:47] Angels defi
[2:09:52] Society one
[2:09:56] day he
[2:09:58] came he didn't seek me I didn't seek Him
[2:10:02] He sought me one day he
[2:10:07] came I never read a book The Bible I was
[2:10:11] raised a Catholic we didn't read the
[2:10:13] Bible and I open this book to Romans
[2:10:16] chapter 1

[2:10:28] that are
[2:10:30] good man with man woman with woman doing
[2:10:33] those things with ours and I'm sitting
[2:10:35] there and and that was my
[2:10:39] condition I was all those things I was
[2:10:41] in terrible shape I was running with
[2:10:44] perverts and drug addicts and and I had
[2:10:48] no no control over my life I totally
[2:10:50] lost it I was under the bondage of
[2:10:56] addiction I couldn't find a drop of love
[2:10:59] in my
[2:11:00] heart for
[2:11:03] anybody I found myself hours and hours
[2:11:06] and days and days living in a house with
[2:11:09] my shades drawn
[2:11:12] dark listening to every kind of
[2:11:15] perverted music I could find to find
[2:11:18] some sort of meaning in
[2:11:24] life and I remember
[2:11:27] when those guys were all there I was in
[2:11:30] this room and I had
[2:11:34] the iron Horsemen Hell's Angels rock
[2:11:38] musicians and everybody in that room and
[2:11:41] the big garbage party you could think
[2:11:46] of and they were all inv inviting me to
[2:11:48] join him and something come over
[2:11:52] me and I remember I just shook there
[2:11:57] shaking with
[2:11:59] chills the the evil that was surrounding
[2:12:02] me I I could see demon faces on
[2:12:06] people and I remember I got so cold I
[2:12:10] had an old gas oven and I I I uh put
[2:12:14] down the oven door and I turned on the
[2:12:17] oven and I got up on top of it trying to
[2:12:20] get the warmth from the oven to get me
[2:12:24] warm and I remember I stepped off and I
[2:12:27] walked into my
[2:12:29] room and I fell on my knees and I said
[2:12:32] God help
[2:12:34] me I don't know what I am but I'm not
[2:12:41] this that's all I said I'm not this this
[2:12:44] is not what I am it's not what I want to
[2:12:48] to
[2:12:48] be cuzz I didn't know where to
[2:12:52] go and a guy out of
[2:12:55] mockery told me why don't you read the
[2:13:00] Bible and I did and I read Romans
[2:13:04] chapter
[2:13:07] 1 and I Heard a
[2:13:10] Voice and a voice started
[2:13:13] reading that chapter to
[2:13:15] me and I sat there and I read it and I
[2:13:19] listened to this voice read every word
[2:13:21] to
[2:13:23] me and I bowed my
[2:13:26] head and I said I want this Spirit
[2:13:30] Lord to come into my
[2:13:36] life now remember I'll never forget a
[2:13:39] little
[2:13:40] girl was riding her bike down the
[2:13:44] street down this little Hill and she
[2:13:46] lost control
[2:13:50] and 10 minutes earlier I had have
[2:13:52] laughed called her a stupid little
[2:13:55] bratty snot-nosed kid you got exactly
[2:13:58] what you
[2:13:59] deserve and all of a sudden I sprung up
[2:14:04] I cared for
[2:14:06] her I ran off the jump down and ran up
[2:14:09] to her bike and my hair's all long and
[2:14:12] curly I got beard my eyes are Beady you
[2:14:15] know and I said dark are you all
[2:14:20] right like the scared her to death but
[2:14:24] something
[2:14:26] happen you know he gave me a promise
[2:14:29] that he'd never leave me nor forsake
[2:14:35] me and I've had one goal ever since and
[2:14:39] that's that John
[2:14:42] 1334 you put it up
[2:14:46] again
[2:14:53] a new
[2:14:54] commandment I give
[2:14:58] you a
[2:15:02] Commandment that you love one another as
[2:15:05] I have loved
[2:15:08] you and I remember how he loved me am
[2:15:13] and I'm never going to forget
[2:15:15] that if I fail
[2:15:18] he's never forsaken
[2:15:20] me he's never left
[2:15:24] me am I perfect
[2:15:27] no do I want to be
[2:15:31] yes do I want to
[2:15:34] overcome yes because it's given to the
[2:15:39] Overcomer but I don't want to forget the
[2:15:41] very
[2:15:44] ABC is that he gave me an opportunity to
[2:15:48] have a new
[2:15:50] nature and too many of us are walking
[2:15:52] away from that nature for
[2:15:55] Doctrine for
[2:15:59] theology I don't want to be at battle
[2:16:01] with the world I don't want to be at
[2:16:03] battle with anybody else in this message
[2:16:06] there's only one thing I long for
[2:16:09] anybody that they can know the
[2:16:11] joy of having Jesus Christ come in their
[2:16:16] heart and life
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:20] there's nothing like
[2:16:22] it let's stand this
[2:16:28] morning with every head
[2:16:32] bowed every heart to the
[2:16:35] Lord you ask yourself this
[2:16:39] [Music]
[2:16:44] morning what's ruling in my

[2:19:49] Lord and you paid a price at Calvary
[2:19:51] that I could have this
[2:19:54] spirit and I believe Lord that you died
[2:19:57] for
[2:19:59] me and that this spirit is for
[2:20:04] me it fits the desire of my heart it is
[2:20:08] for
[2:20:09] me it was given to make me
[2:20:13] whole I was designed to receive it

[2:20:21] fit the person I am it's for
[2:20:25] me and Lord I know I could live happier
[2:20:30] and Freer with that
[2:20:32] Spirit living in

[2:20:39] morning without
[2:20:42] sensation without some outwardly thing
[2:20:45] for the whole world to see
[2:20:49] but that you would
[2:20:51] come and dwell in
[2:20:55] me Lord and I'm sorry for the things
[2:20:58] that I've done and
[2:21:01] said the things that I'm watching the
[2:21:04] things that I'm
[2:21:06] reading the things that I'm listening
[2:21:10] to and Lord I know that if you would
[2:21:14] take your abod in my
[2:21:16] heart that I would lose the desire for
[2:21:19] those
[2:21:20] things my old man has a desire for those
[2:21:24] things Lord but I'm asking
[2:21:26] today that I could become born
[2:21:30] [Music]
[2:21:36] again that you would give me the
[2:21:39] birth of your
[2:21:45] nature and Lord if I could just walk in
[2:21:50] that maybe down life's Road I'd be
[2:21:53] worthy of a gift or
[2:21:55] two but let me start on the foundation
[2:21:59] which can none other can be laid than
[2:22:02] that which is laid which is Christ
[2:22:05] Jesus in this last day living in
[2:22:10] people father I ask that you would grant
[2:22:13] that for those that have asked
[2:22:16] it
[2:22:17] I'm not ashamed father to admit that I
[2:22:20] need more of
[2:22:22] you I get wore down and grumpy
[2:22:27] and and I don't want to be like
[2:22:31] that Lord I get
[2:22:36] forgetful and maybe I hurt
[2:22:42] people Lord I don't want to be like
[2:22:46] that
[2:22:48] but if you renew yourself in
[2:22:52] me make me more
[2:22:57] aware of the importance of your
[2:23:02] presence in my daily and hourly
[2:23:06] and present tense
[2:23:10] actions that Christ could
[2:23:14] live and radiate
[2:23:18] and the love of God could be shed abroad
[2:23:20] in My Heart by the Holy Spirit I ask
[2:23:24] that for myself and for all those that
[2:23:27] raised their hand this
[2:23:29] morning that we could return back to
