Description:
Trail of the Serpent
Br. Danny Stemen
September 01, 2023
2023 Labor Day Youth Meetings
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Jeremy already said even when we come with no expectations you better start expecting something because God came to move I'm sure certainly looking forward to this weekend uh what I'd like to call our first uh anniversary Labor Day meetings it's geared towards the youth and we've so honored and privileged to have brother Danny and his wife sister Michelle with us in Fellowship it's great honor and privilege to be able to have them and I'm just looking forward to what God is going to do amen we just wanted to make a few announcements as you know we've we've tried to gear this towards the youth and certainly sometimes we're limited with spaces or things that we can do and we realize that we may be doing something outside in this weather we might not have to show up so we we've tried to make some arrangements um I've I've opened up my home for the Youth some of the host families and and helpers out of town guests my home will be open for you after the service and then also for after the

so why don't we just stand as they play something softly we'll say a prayer over the tithes and offerings I don't believe there was any request turned in um but one thing I do know we have a lot of needs and maybe as they begin to play maybe just start forming something in your heart that you want God to do why don't we just start to form an expectation Maybe the family member or loved one maybe somebody wants to stand in the cab tonight why don't you lift your hand for that loved one yes foreign Heavenly Father what an amazing opportunity to be able to stand in your presence [Music] to know that there's been a blood that's been shed that we could be forgiven Lord or do we want to start out the meeting by asking or they they forgive us for all of our sins Lord for our unbelief Lord where we failed you our iniquities lordly we need the blood Lord and we know there's still power in that blood we know that we can be Washed by the Water of the word Lord so we're we just want to lay down all of our cares Lord all of our iniquity our sins our failures Lord we just plead the blood that was shed Lord that we could be forgiven Lord Jesus now Lord we can approach you with a boldness knowing that it's finished that we have been forgiven Lord we can stand in the gap for our brothers and for our sisters and for our children and those that are in need Lord and we can stand upon your word you said Lord that whatever we would ask in your name that you would do it Lord we formed an expectation in our heart and now our faith anchors in your word Lord knowing that you will perform that which you've promised Lord these hands that were lifted for unspoken prayer requests Lord there's some great needs that are represented here some that are in bondage and they need Deliverance Lord I'm so thankful they've come to the house of God because this is where that need will be met by your grace Lord we ask a blessing over the tithes and the offerings we commit the rest of this

praise the Lord I mean say that your desire this evening amen because it's his faith Amen brother Branham said that we do all that we can of the mechanics Follow Him in everything that you know you followed him in baptism you you've repented you've come the way he said you follow him in the mechanics of the word then the Dynamics of The Words which is his faith will come into you and it anoint you to do what his word has said that's what I want I don't want it to be about me I want it to be about him and that's his promise so amen we're in a place for that amen amen so God bless you this evening I just want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and I wanted to say what a privilege it is this is geared to the youth but I see a lot of Youth in the back too with gray hair and I have to say that because I'm getting there myself so but I just want to say it's a real privilege to be here and I want to thank Brother David and sister Leslie for their invitation and they've been just went Above and Beyond in their kindness and their love they showed to us in the in the McGary family we just appreciate them and this opportunity to be here you know we're all Brothers and Sisters in Christ and we probably would have never met except for what we have in common because we've come from all over the world all walks of life all kinds of different paths but God rich in Mercy with his great love say great love his great love wherewith he loved us he gave us his word that's what we have in common together and so it's a privilege to be here and I'm thankful to be here with my wife amen and bring greetings to you from the Saints back home in Sarasota Florida so we're looking forward to what God will do in these Services he knows who would be here and I believe that he plans these things and he lays these burdens upon the ministry's hearts and then he has a harvest of that burden and he's going to see that in your life I believe that amen let's bow our heads if we can Heavenly Father together we want to say Lord that we love you and we want to thank you Father for this evening that you have prepared Lord bring your people together Lord no matter what their condition may be you have brought them together father Lord the songs have been sung the hearts have been prepared now Lord may you magnify yourself through your word get me out of the way and anoint my lips I pray anoint the ears of the year Lord whatever the needs may be sickness Deliverance filling of the Holy Ghost whatever it is you're the same yesterday today and forever we believe you father we commit ourselves to you we want to give you our strength I want to give you our minds Lord we want to give you all that we are father to this service tonight that you would have complete control bless this church I pray in their desire for this meeting May you bring fruits and harvest of it Lord in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you this evening if you turn in your Bibles over to the book of Isaiah the 14th chapter I'm going to read to you very familiar portion of scripture and we have more than one service um this week so we may carry this thought a service or two with the help of the Lord but this is very familiar Isaiah 14 and verse 12. how art thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for you have said in your heart I will Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God I will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I'll Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet you shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider these saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble they did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners notice the prophet Isaiah he is speaking of a great person a man who has had great influence and perception a conception of what he is and you can see as he's saying these things how the perception is changing and so we want to speak on this this evening you can be seated I appreciate once again Brother David to be here and and I've appreciated the fellowship we've had today with all the brothers around the the best pork chops in the world according to brother Matt amen everything's bigger in Texas and I appreciate amen the the opportunity to come but we don't come just to meet one another we come because we're going to have services and and there's a burden that's here that that's that's beyond me amen but it's the Lord's burden I believe he knows our hearts and and sometimes and this is just me uh as a minister you know it doesn't get any easier in the sense of of uh of ministering because it's always a nervous place for me and it's not that we lack something to say because we have more material and more access now than at any time in history but God knows the heart so it's to the need that that we want to speak hi brother John amen and and and God knows that need and so for a minister it's it can be it can be a shaky place because he doesn't want to come and and project himself but but he wants it to be amen the mind of God Amen that's being spoken and I had I had been I had been reading these certain statements that brother Branham was making and it attracted me to it and and he said that he wanted to preach on this subject of the trail of The Serpent and uh and I'm obviously nobody to replace a prophet for speaking on a subject we realize that he said I want to go home and I want to speak on this it'll be about a four-hour sermon amen I'll probably take about the same amount of time but not all at once amen and and uh but but but I am not I'm not going to this evening try to say well this is what he really meant or this is who he was speaking to but I just want to use the outline of what he said because I remember as a young Minister it's kind of hard for me to say that anymore because I I used to enjoy being the young Minister I'm not there anymore it's been many years but when I started ministering my my wife's grandfather who was a pastor he's went on to be with the Lord he began to tell me he said you know when you're dealing with people and their their bound with sickness or some kind of thing he said the first thing you have to deal with is the fear that's upon them before you ever deal with a disease with the situation you have to deal with the fear because what accompanies anything that Satan tries to bring to you is going to bring a fear with that fears of hopelessness and a worthlessness and and and I can't be delivered type of thing but but you know what what the prophet did is he came and he exposed the enemy amen this is the purpose of God Amen to expose him amen this is why the prophet said he hates the Book of Revelation and he hates the Book of Genesis the Book of Genesis shows how he came into the human race how how he deceived the human race amen and the Book of Revelation shows how he'll be destroyed and he hates to be exposed if he hates to be exposed on any level he hates to be exposed on a corporate level come on he hates to be exposed on an intimate level he hates exposure why does he hate exposure because if he is this all-powerful if he is this person that doesn't open up the house of his prisoners if he is this person who has seemingly so much power over the human life why does he hate exposure so we want to expose him and the only way we can expose him is the Vindicated way and the Vindicated way is the word I listen I'm a person that believes in experience but that experience must be rooted in the word of God that experience cannot take you back to the word it's not going to hold but if it can come back to the word there is nothing Satan can do to take it away from you because you have what he Lacks I don't tell you the youngest person in here can have what Satan Lacks I just want to encourage you Satan can't get healed he can't get delivered he can't get free amen all these feelings you get come from him they're not yours there is come on church amen Satan knows he cannot be free he knows he's lost his first estate he cannot get it back but this is the hour of Redemption where God is redeeming those bringing them back to the original well this is a dangerous place whoo we just might as well go to work amen hallelujah praise the Lord I'll preach myself out in 15 minutes amen so so now I want you to think he is speaking to this great being it's only time we seem called by his original name but he is actually addressing the Babylonian power it's what Satan has hit himself and worked through you want to see that that the scripture will rarely give you a physical description of what he looks like but he'll tell you what he sounds like he'll tell you his characteristics because this is how you're going to know it he's not going to look the same as he did back when Isaiah said this amen but you'll know him the prophet said by his characteristics is that right amen and so so now as he's addressing this this man Lucifer and he's saying amen you're not in your original position you have fallen from heaven you used to be the son of the morning amen but now you've been cut down to the grounds your influence has weakened the Nations what power that he would weaken the Nations weakness to keep them from their potential to keep them from what they were meant to be he would weaken them until the power that was supposed to be displayed through them would come to nothing amen and he said the reason you've been cut down is you lifted yourself up and you lifted yourself up to a place that was not yours you are not content with where God had placed you so you begin to desire something that was not given to you amen you looked upon your talent and you looked upon your gift and you looked upon the Perfection of your beauty amen but you didn't realize you never got that by yourself it was something that God gave to you amen and you thought that what you were would cause you to ascend into this place hey man you said that you would be above the stars of God Amen you said you would sit upon the mount amen of the congregation in the sides of the north you said you would Ascend to the heights of the clouds and I'll be like the most high you have said this in your heart that you would be like God amen you thought you could stay there and the Prophet come along and he said and he's had great success because amen Isaiah says yet you'll be brought down to Hell so he he brings him to this place of you have risen you have come to this place that you have risen to but you'll be brought down now he never told him he wouldn't rise there but he told him he would be brought down now I want to read out of second Thessalonians 2 and you can you can turn with me if you will laughs and I believe I believe to our young people amen we can preach the full word of God amen of our young people if our young people can go into the depths of sin and go into the the depths of the world and Hey listen most of you young people here probably know far more than me about Electronics or anything else your minds you're set in a place where Brilliance and and smart and intelligent and somehow we come to the word we think oh we got to be dumb we can't understand the word see that's Satan because he doesn't want you to know he wants you to think that you can't know you can second Thessalonians 2 verse 1 now I read to you out of Isaiah is it was Isaiah because it was out of Isaiah amen now second Thessalonians Paul he's writing another prophet but there costs been hundreds of years later now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that in be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither my spirit you know by word or by letter as from us even if it's attributed to us a letter from US as at the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there cometh of Falling Away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition notice he said he'll be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God you understand now the reason I'm reading this don't just just don't don't sit here this evening and say well well I've heard that before I I've read that before so I I understand I understand that no he is saying I exalt myself above all so he's exalted himself above your experience he has exalted himself above your walk with the Lord he is telling you it is not strong enough I will take you and I will turn you hell yeah I'll let you sit in this church a Christian Life for a while but I'll get a hold of you because my strength is stronger than yours oh but God did not send you down into this age Amen to be lost he sent you down into this age to be saved Amen to prove that that attribute of God is still the same yesterday today and forever I'm the one that believes is that way tonight well how do you know brother Danny because I've experienced him I found out this with God when he speaks to you it's going to be from his word if it's not from his word it's not God you cannot base where you are with God on anything else but the word of God because if he tells you anything it's going to come from here 's the difference now amen Jesus said Satan or brother Branham said about Jesus that said that he said Satan has no part in me and I have no part in him Satan would like to prove that difference so he'd like to prove that he has a part Hallelujah did somebody be revealed so he exalteth himself above all that is called God or or that is worshiped so that he has God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God what a fake what a liar what a Deceiver sitting in a place of worship being worshiped as God and he's not the one amen they think they're worshiping right what a deception hold out to grab our hearts to think that something can be so deceiving people would look and say well here's God and he would deceive them that way but God said I reveal him I reveal him you'll find out he's not God he's a son of perdition him and remember you not when I was yet with you I told you these things it says there's a thing with a prophet he'll tell you he'll tell you what is happening he'll tell you how Satan is deceiving he'll tell you how he sounds amen and know you know and you now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now I'm just reading those things and I'm taking my time because I feel too much at home amen but Satan's purpose amen from Eden amen was to make his own self in Eden right his own place amen where what happened in Eden it was a place of Fellowship it was a place amen where God came down and he fellowship with this man his men and his people had a commandment from God to keep it and preserve it to guard it he desired that place because it's the highest intimacy that there could be between God and man and he's looking at this and says I'll make myself a needle amen and I'll exalt myself above the stars of God so that their worship me Sons would worship me I don't I can't think of anything more degrading than sons of God worshiping the wrong one here Prophet stands in our age he says he's absolutely carried it out it's what he's done and he's brought it to the church amen he said and that's exactly the hour we're living in and as Satan has done it he's done it through educational programs he's done it through a better fit what is a better fit a better fit is something that is more to my likes I find a church I find a place of worship that that more lines up with how I think worship should be amen so he Satan will provide that for you if you want all inclusion he'll be all inclusive if you're if you're a legalist here be a legalist he'll be whatever you want to be you find that taste for you amen and so he said it's a better fit it's better this it's better that and not knowing all the time walking right into death oh we're a blessed people tonight amen blinded leading the blind blind leaders of Nations blind leaders of science blind leaders of the church let me say it again blind leaders of the nation blind leaders of science blind leaders of the church Jesus said let them alone they're falling the ditch he said you notice now two eat and so close together till they almost deceive the very elected so don't sit here and think okay amen I've got this figured out and and I can read what has been said and so I will not be deceived almost deceive the very elected there'd be only one thing that will stop you from not being deceived and that is called election thank you you understand that this is also what exposes Satan because Satan himself he hates amen the revelation of election because he's never been able to overturn it he has sent he has seen men and women go so far that he begin to relax amen and Danny election amen begin to have a voice book of redemption was still being read I want you to know tonight the book of redemption is still being read and there's still people that God Amen is pulling into his kingdom am I yelling too loud Brother David you know in the Mennonite church we didn't get the opportunity to do this I'm taking opportunity to do it you know everybody's on YouTube today even the church we came out of I don't know why they would put it on because there's well somebody will like it Hallelujah better fit amen so now amen this is what Satan hates he hates election because he knows it'll expose him brother man said amen here we notice two types of Eden so close together till almost deceive the very elected Matthew 24 24 said it would be that way and he identified that that's exactly the hour we're living in now is Matthew 24 24. he said but I want us to stop and consider these two Edens one thing especially how the Bible tells us that God's word did produce that Eden and how God warns that that other Eden would come so there's got to be another Eden oh we know this is where we're at the Baptist Church the Catholic Church the denominational world not one of them produced a Satan's Eden message none of them preached that amen but God's voice preach Satan's Eden and now brother Branham proceeds to read the scripture we just read to you II Thessalonians 1. and he said or two verse 1 and on down he said now you think of it now Isaiah 14. the prophet said he saw Lucifer in his heart through a vision under inspiration of God saying he would do that and in Isaiah 800 years before Paul or approximately but now 800 years later Paul sees him come to that position and it heads up his scientific Aiden with his scientific world with a scientific bride a scientific Church all under the word of knowledge and they'll tell you that knowledge is the word great seminaries great degrees educational programs you notice Satan's not called the god of any other age but this age so it took him with all that ambition to come to this last age and be called that all the way to the end he has come to the desire of his heart to be God into heaven Eden and and the prophet stood in this generation and said he's got it he has that Eden amen amen that was his ambition to be worshiped like God you know as we talk about the trail of the serpent but you'll find that his Trail will lead always very close to the election he's always wherever the election is because he knows where the election is there's life you see in him he wants that life amen he is desired to be worshiped now he's being worshiped he's desired to have his church he has his church he desires to have his Eden he has his Eden but that's not his full desire I'll be above the stars of God I will sit in the Mount of the congregation I will Ascend into your place he desires the positions of sons of God now Satan is cruel the Bible says he don't open the house of his prisoners he will not provide an escape I've never seen an age it's so Afflicted it was prophesied that men's Hearts would fail with fear and we've seen it it's afflicting our young it's afflicting our old this country is is probably the most medicated country a number of years ago I read that out of 300 and something million people in America over 120 million of them are our men are impaired through drugs through some kind of condition where they're trying to to medicate a position medicate a problem something they can't escape we've come to that age we've come to the age where amen amen we wrestle with with great problems of of nervous breakdowns and depressions and Suicidal Thoughts it's coming from his scientific Eden right it never that kind of thinking never came from God's even it comes from the the scientific Eden because the human mind was not made to live in that even we're not made we're not conditioned to live in the Eden that Satan makes he doesn't create it he perverts it so we're not made to live in that right and so it keeps us all restless and and you know I'm saying oh I'm identifying it it keeps us it keeps us Restless unsatisfied oh he's looking for for for something to to grab our attention that's why people can hardly sit in church anymore because they have to be entertained and they don't they can't say it's still long enough to call on God and and to pray to have their own time with God it's got to be sass it's got to be I got to be able to see it I got to quickly see what somebody thinks about me or oh did they like my pose and holy you know it's always rush rush rush Satan knows if he can keep you out of the sound of the voice of God amen because he knows what a prophet preached about first a deep call into the deep he knows that Jesus stood there and said amen if you hunger and thirst after righteousness you'll be filled he knows what he said so he's trying to get your attention if I can get it tonight look at that crazy preacher up there what does he think he's doing jack God you actually think to you I'm going to get something out of this service it does look foolish doesn't it there's word for that amen by the foolishness of preaching souls are saved amen and so God he's trying to get your attention and so Satan he's keeping you running we have young people that have given up because in their mind they went too far there's no hope and I can't be free brother Danny I've had uh hopelessness and torment I speak to you as a man I understand I understand what it's like to have those kind of feelings I want to tell you something here tonight help of the Lord you can take this home with you those feelings you feel they're not yours that torment that hopelessness that's his he's the one on the verge of a nervous breakdown because he's sitting in a position he can't handle that's right that's good he wasn't made to be worshiped by everybody come on come on imagine being that popular with people you're not made to be there you can't handle it it's going to bring you down Satan's on the verge of a nervous breakdown he's full of nervousness he's tormented in his nights you can't sleep but he can't sleep good there you go it's his because I want to tell you something else young people if Satan could have took you and killed you he'd already done it but I find out by the word of God he has to have permission for everything what kind of King has to ask permission oh you might as well help me preach now I said what kind of King has to ask permission Amen to come against your life it's a king who is a liar he's lying about his position over you Jesus said when he speaks anything it's a lie so that means anything he tells me I can't be saved I'm not a part of God I can't get the Holy Ghost I cannot be healed amen he is a liar it is my job to stand up and say Satan you're a liar thank you good job the reason I can get the Holy Ghost it's not because you told me I could get it it's because God has destinated my hour to receive he has I want to preach to you this evening he has sent me to this age Amen to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever he wants to live in me to show the enemy his deed and has no power position of the son of God I'm not asking you Amen to do anything but believe [Applause] that's all I'm asking you to do all I'm asking you to do is when the word again to identify I want to say something else Amen brother Billy God wrote this word and this is my Bible this is my word it was meant for me it was designed for me it was promised to me he even said when I come into Christ I'm joined Heirs of God all that God is I am because I'm a part of him well then Satan come on come on come on shake my hand come on Satan is under my feet what kind of King is under the feet of the people in his Eden all that means his lust can't hold you up his lies can't hold you drugs can't hold you nothing the enemy has designed against you can hold you in this house [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord Satan likes to Triumph he likes to flaunt his victories yeah he likes to parade amen The Lost Ones before the people especially friends so-called Believers people that have fallen he likes to parade them I got news for you I read in the Bible amen where the enemy took the heads of Saul Jonathan and Sons of Saul and they pinned him to the walls but there are some people that Saul had been good too we need Brothers like this you know I'm not trying to pin anybody's head to the wall but the devils amen and then men went up by night and said we're not going to allow those heads to stay up there as a trophy and they recovered those trophies from the enemy they took him back and gave him Proper Burial now the enemy has done that with some of ours you see there's something called a Roman Triumph or help me everybody looking everyone everybody beside you and say help brother Danny thank you I haven't even started my message this is a bad place to be amen brother David's praying there's a thing called a Roman Triumph in the time when Rome was at their height of their Glory and their generals would be out in their campaigns this was not the time of social media it'd take years sometimes to hear get all the news back of everything that's happened and there's a Roman Triumph where they'd have a great Victory maybe maybe this General is out there he's fighting for Rome and he's he's overcome Britannia or Germania or somewhere and he a certain tribe and he takes captives and the Roman Triumph is when they've sent word ahead that we've won the battle now these people worshiped these men these were their Stars and they would come back and if it was a big campaign it might took years they said the Roman Triumph could take two to three days of them parading All The Spoils of War down the Main Avenue of Rome showing them the great Victory they had and they would bring these carts carts of weapons that they had recovered from the battlefield the weapons that that their enemy had used and they would put all these on the cart and show show they're people their weapons weren't good enough then they'd bring behind them the captives leaving the highest ranks the captains the generals the Chiefs the leaders bring them in Chains it's quite a spectacle bring all these Vanquish people for this great power and they were showing that they're the masters of the world and appearing at the last would be the general he would be in his carriage and everybody would be screaming and hollering and screaming and adoration for this great champion and he would be in his best clothes he'd be in gold and the people would be screaming worshiping and they knew that that worship could get so high that that man would begin to think he's something he's not so they'd put a Slave right behind him and he'd be whispering in his ear through the whole procession remember you too are man because this man would think because I have vanquished his people and had such a successful campaign I could be God oh we've come to an age where he is paraded he has paraded failure before the people he's paraded friends people you know people that held the same Bible you held the same weapons same weapons of war that we use same message it didn't work it didn't work and oh how Satan loves to pile up their words and their some of these folks could give good testimonies and he loves to pile it up and parade it before you that's right you see it isn't going to work it isn't going to work here's this General it could be God look at this war I've won I could be God I just want to be that guy behind him here stands up Isaiah and said now listen is this the man right come on this guy's nothing but a man all right he has acted in this age like he's he's uh invincible he's acted like his arguments are actually right he actually wants to tell you that the Vindication was not real well you know it wasn't real he man he's got so many bruises you know how many prayer lines he's been cast out of yeah brother Branham lined him up it goes down the road boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom call them by name and that was minor that's right brother said Divine Healing was minor that's right those those things were minor and this minor saying so I'm the winner I'm the winner Here Comes The Miner right right come on now come on you live on so and so and your name is so and so and you've been thinking this and you have this problem and you got that problem oh and this Spirit over here is called out it's got the same problem over here I want to tell the devil this evening you are just a man you don't have the power you think you have your Trail is of the serpent it's not God he said why are you preaching like that brother Danny you just you're just trying to be emotional you're trying to get me stirred up well you know sometimes getting you stirred up is half the problem amen because you know very rarely anymore do people come half hour ahead of time and begin to pray and begin to read their Bible we rush in and we rush out and then we're not sure if we actually heard God or not and if somehow the message would touch on your life amen the enemy would say well that way they want you well he is a liar and praise the Lord huh it's his hopelessness Jesus said when he speaketh Allah he speaks of his own for he is a liar and he is the father of it now brother Graham said in Satan's Eden that he's had great success what is his success in this hour explaining right he is a good talker he knows how to explain away the value of the word and his explanations are so good they seems so anointed but I found I found that in every Exodus God taught his men how to handle snakes right I want to speak about one for just a moment and I'm going to ask you if this is all right let's speak about one brother Batman said that amen The Exodus the first Sexes that happened down there in Egypt he said it came at a specific time in history right God has set times yes set times of Deliverance and it came at a set time and that was what he had told Abraham you're be in this country he said then after 400 years I'll call you out with a mighty hand so he said it's a set time and then he said and even more specifically when the people cried for it when they cried for deliverance when their attitude was set toward it when they got tired of slavery and then on the other end God was working because he knew their desire so he would be working on the other end because there's a deep calling to the deep and he told a backslidden prophet he had been preparing him for many years in the in the wilderness and he told him I've heard their cry you know you forgive me as I as I talk about this but God has a way of training his people to get ready you know God is not like historians that are come from a certain country and they try to make the country look the best in the world and give you all the good details God is a different kind of historian he tells you everything about that person and a lot of it doesn't it doesn't look good I mean you wouldn't like to be told that you know ah yeah he lied you know brother Danny lied who like you would you like that to be told about you brother Andrew is Andrew Andrew you know he got under come here Andrew I love you brother yeah you know here he doesn't he look good he's in church and you got to type you know he told a lie he got in so much pressure well that was Abraham got in so much pressure he told a lie caused his wife to tell one thank you brother Andrew look just like Abraham and and uh and then God turned around told that King go ask him to pray for you it's just unusual it's uncomfortable yeah you know Moses he was one of the smartest men That Ever Walked the Earth we can read that in the Bible brother uh cosmon that he was learned in all the wisdom and and you read history about him he was learned in science he was a scientist he was he was learned in in uh in their religion he was learned at everything very smart he was mighty the Bible said in word and deed he just wasn't ready for an exodus he was equipped to meet the challenges of the world but not the challenge of the word he had every ability he had it but he wasn't ready he wasn't ready so because he tried to do it through his own understanding and he ends up on the backside of a desert for 40 years he left when he was 40 and he's over in the desert for another 40 years and brother Branham he has a sense of humor in fact he said God must have a sense of humor he said he said Moses problem was he had a temper and he said so God married him to a woman who had a temper as bad as his I know this don't seem like the trail of the serpent to you and he said it must have been something on the back side of the desert when both of their tempers got out of him oh I don't know a thing about what that's like can you imagine prophet and his wife needing therapy the man said it must have been something you know he said that was God's school has that ever felt like school to you well some of you young folks you don't you ain't gonna know this he called that God School he was schooling into the mind of Moses the program of God that is not your ability I need it's you I need yeah yeah not your ability it's you and he said it must have been something back there when he's arguing I can imagine he's arguing you know Moses he's a shepherd and he's he's got the sheep and he comes in and you know they're hot they're tired he's dirty his sandals are dirty she screams at him take his shoes off you're getting the rugs dirty in here and all this kind of thing and then people going by outside listening to him fight and it was God getting his Prophet ready for an exodus it don't even seem like it's possible that man is is getting so he's so far from God that brother man said all faults of Freedom were gone he thought God had forgot about him his place in The Exodus was gone he's not going to be a part of it God's going to raise someone else up God hadn't forgot him he's just patient say it again God hadn't forgotten he's just patient and you know we think we know God can use us when I'm at my best and God says I can use you because I'm always at my best go ask Abraham come on yeah right I had to get him when he finally had lost his own abilities that's when I could use him when he gave up and said God I can't do it anymore here's his Mighty Man a word indeed and he gets him in that place and Moses for 40 years that's a long school I think anybody in here has ever took school that long School of a prophet's longer than you know to be a doctor or something after 40 years he's just tottering around out there in the wilderness and he sees a bush burning up on a mountain he says to himself I'm gonna say I ain't never seen a burst burn before and it's not consumed so he goes over there and as he gets closer a voice speaks to him Moses take off your shoes he's heard that before he's had 40 years he's had 40 years to hear it from another voice is he married he's had 40 years hear someone else tell him take his shoes off now it was so important that he took him off the prophet said if he did not respond to it he'd never spoke to him again you know that's amazing to me that God be so patient with the person for 40 years and then you say this is your change and I'm going to make it plain to you that it's me I want to show you something that it'll burn and it will not consume it you're going to know it's God you're going to know it's not going to be an imagination come on and I'm going to give you an experience Moses after that experience you can go tell someone else too about it and lead them back to the same place it's a place that you don't imagine God it's a place that you don't walk away and wonder if God talked to me it's a place that if you come into His presence you'll never be the same again in five minutes right come on stand up Moses take your shoes off well I love this guy he I don't think he kicked him toward the bush amen amen um I'm gonna take you to school Matt now Moses had learned obedience by the things he suffered do you think Moses was enjoying his school in that hot you know if God is going to deal with the temper please lead him to the north give him some snow but he takes him to Dallas takes him where it's hot scorching living in tents The Prince of Egypt living in tents I used to speak to multitudes no only time I speak is hey and they go ah prophet deliver Prince I can barely be a husband but I have learned to take my shoes off something little simple to show reverence that when I take off my shoes I'm no longer walking under my own power what I've walked in I'm not walking in anymore and I'm approaching a voice it's going to tell me what to do now I already got the equipment in me to be a deliverer I just not been lit but my first step toward being lit is I took my shoes off yes and I approached this service like it's my last one and God I found out when he began to speak he said I have heard the Cry of Egypt and I have come down and Moses I have not forgot you yes I am sending you Hallelujah me it can't happen I can't do it I I I I I oh I oh I they won't believe me well you got in your hand Moses yeah throw it on the ground oh it turned into a serpent into something that God wants to train you right to how to deal with serpents and I love the scripture the Bible says he fled imagine a prophet running for his life I'd love to see it in your socks he ran in his he the Bible said he fled you know God is so unusual he'll teach you certain things that and you know here's Moses he he's he has been totally equipped in his own mind before to just live this message I didn't tell you to sat down I read this message I can do it I can do it I want you to know there's not one of you equipped in your own ability to overcome the enemy and produce what this message says there's not one of you can live it the way the message calls for with your own ability no matter how you're dressed how clean you look how much you worship you do not have the ability to withstand the serpent you see the serpent amen was the representation of the power of pharaoh and so God says you take this Dead stick throw it down and it turns into a serpent and the Bible says Moses ran for his life he wouldn't say for his life he fled from it okay he fled I would have loved to seen that because fled means he'd kind of lost function he's running he's not controlled he's out there and God says come back I'm back Moses comes back praise the Lord praise the Lord and stealing his socks there's that snake said and Lord you are you're you're showing out that's something I've been carrying that thing for 40 years I didn't know it could do that and God said I'm not done now you pick it up God knows how to deal he knows how to deal with every fear [Music] hey man I'm going to give you power over the serpent he's not asking you to go pick up snakes he is telling I'm going to deal with your complex I'm going to deal with your fear Moses amen I'm going to get you to a place you're going to be able to walk as an old man into the presence of the superpower and believe what I have said it's the kind of fire god a lot in you that you know that when you approach that superpower it can't stop you it can't hold you he's going to work on your behalf and the word you say is what he has taught you to say amen amen pick it up now the Bible doesn't tell us how long it took but if it's like you oh and sometimes you're in sometimes you're out God is passionate go pick it up yeah Lord can I just come to church and not be challenged I said pick it up come on I'm wanting you to deal with it Lord I know I don't like I don't like snakes I said I want you to deal with it well can I can I just come and worship I said pick it up come on I don't know maybe the Lord let us see one day brother Andrew Billy was like would you like to pick up a snake it may be a gardener amen Moses didn't even let anybody to show off to God I'm challenging you take your fear and pick it up and it'll become a stick again it'll be inanimate right I'm gonna use it to show the devil my first step in Victory yes somehow he got to it and he'd done it and then God gave him a disease put his hand in come out lepers shown in the signs you know after all that God showed him of his Supernatural God says now you go and you tell them it's time for The Exodus and Moses said I can't go I'm not gone and the reason I'm not going is I can't speak now from the time of 40 years old at the time of 80 he developed a stutter he used to be a man Mighty in word indeeds but you know them marriages when you argue I don't know why I'm looking you don't know you do the stutter was developed from not being able to get a word in now I and he had lost such confidence that in the presence of God he said I can't do it that's right and I'm closing this is strange I had to wrestle to get here tonight but God knows who I'm talking to and God said I am the one who has made men's mouth I will teach you what to say God can be with you just like he was with Moses and a prophet stood in this generation says if there's ever a time to speak it's now what are you going to speak you are going to speak as the Oracles of God you are going to say what God tells you to say because what you say is not going to work but what God puts in your mouth will be just like God speaking it when it comes from a burning bush amen now I'm speaking to Sons and Daughters of God people whose positions Satan cannot Ascend above unless they let him right do you understand the elect is the last people that Satan's not above even in socks amen Hallelujah you're a good Moses you look like him amen little Charlton Heston there God said I'll be with your mouth I'll tell you what to say why do we keep speaking back to him and tell him I can't do it I can't overcome I can't I can't do this finish this work I I can't I can't be a part of this Exodus God said I am with you you are going to reveal me in fact your enemy is going to say I've never heard of of Jehovah but by the time Moses got done talking to him not only did they know who Jehovah was he had ruined their Nation they were no longer a superpower they could not hold their families anymore they could not stop their worship they could not stop their children that's the God I serve oh that was just in the first Exodus God exposed the trail of the serpent all right all right it says you pick him up show him he has no power no I'm speaking to Sons and Daughters of God Satan has said I'll Ascend above these here in Dallas I'll send above these kids there be my trophies this meeting's not going to have an effect upon them I let him get stirred up a little bit and then they're going to go back and they're going to go right back to the same habits and the same things they're doing but I want to say this if God lays a burden on somebody's heart God will have a harvest because he does not call a man to preach he doesn't call a church to come to an area without God calling and having a harvest he will have a harvest from this meeting here is going to be young people and he'll raise up like he did Moses no you won't be the prophet but you'll be the prophet's expression Hallelujah you'll be who he saw in this age you'll be those ones Walking In step to the gospel yeah brother thank you you say well what about my life what about where I've been what about what I've done what about my sin what about the trail of the serpents being exposed and he cannot hold you there because I found out that when Isaiah said he don't open the house of his prisoners I can come right down and read in the Bible where amen my Jesus went to that prison and opened it up and took the keys of death and Hell so the word tells me that that prison doesn't have a lock on it anymore right so if you choose to stay Bound in that lust in that pornography in those things you're dabbling in if you choose to stay there you're in a prison with no lock you chose it but my God is here this evening to tell you that the god of the burning bush is the same Pillar of Fire that has come in this hour and he is speaking to this I wrestle to get to this service amen but God rich in Mercy knew who would be here and he knew the serpents hold you gotta pick it up and let it know it has no power over you come on Moses come on Moses pick up that serpent come on Moses he cannot stop you I'm going to show you there's an exodus coming what about you Elders out there come on Moses pick it up you can stay up coward somebody lost all the ability and thoughts of freedom it came rushing back I'm still called because of God who had called him had rejected to him he would not be God because God has said in his word I'll not lose one and I'm here to talk to that one tonight yes I said I'll not lose you now I want you to know this we're taught by a prophecy you come to God you come to him amen telling him his promises don't come to him telling him how bad you are he already knows it you just tell him you're sorry for that condition and you begin to say and you said in your words come now let us reason together though your sins are a Scarlet they'll be as white as snow God has not forgot one word that he said he'll back it up I went too far brother Danny come now yeah you come to him speaking his words not yours to get his attention because you're saying Lord I believe that's you that is speaking to me I believe that's you and you've got his attention he respond back you're not hopeless you're not so far out he cannot forgive you he has promised to the worst conditions in scripture he sowed I'm God over it when when the person we get so far from God that religion says give them up God says you haven't met me yet I'm the god that takes a woman found in adultery I'm the god that's the god that's here that's the god who's speaking through me that's the god who's responding from you he's that God you take off your shoes now reverence him you tell him I believe you see people don't wait for God to speak back to him we all want to feel him we all want to Rejoice we all want to shout will you let him speak to you yes he will I remember when he called me to the ministry 37 years ago he called me and I was in prayer do you know you'll find God In Prayer you'll find him in prayer and I was in prayer and God spoke to me he says you're going to preach and I said no you know that we're human I said no I don't I don't want to do it I don't want to do it I was 17 years old and he only spoke to me two scriptures he said acts 5 19. he's gone I want to say if God does anything for you 'll find it in the word if it's God it'll be in the word I didn't know what that scripture was you know it's not that I hadn't heard it just when he said it to me I didn't know what it was can I tell you it because I'm just trying to encourage you that he'll give you a word experience and you'll find out that it was God speaking to me and when it's God because you need it when it comes to those times Satan's going to question everything about you you've got to turn and say but it was him it was him that called me it was him and so I didn't know what this what the scripture was and I turned back to it and it said here in Acts 5 19 but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life his word turn my no into a yes the difference is it hasn't made it easy but he's with me and he never promised that your road would be easy right but he promised I'd be with you yes and you just remember when God come and spoke to you tonight that it was him that was speaking to you and you can turn into the enemy and say you can't take that from me amen do you know you know we sing the song Oh taste and see that the Lord is good do you know when that song was written David wrote that song after he came out of the the city of philistia where he had joined himself to the Philistines because he was on the run from Saul he joined and he's there and some of the princes they're getting ready to go to war with Israel and some of them princes look at him says now is not this that man that they sang songs about is this not the one that they sung he's killed his thousands and David began to fear for his life because he was not supposed to be down in philistia he is supposed to be there in Israel where he's he's born where he's elected to be king and you're not supposed to be in Felicity either he looks at you like aren't you supposed to be over here and David changed himself into a Madman and scrambled on the door let me out of here and spit running down his face because he was afraid for his life and they sent him out and he went up to the caves and he wrote this song Oh taste and see that the Lord is good she realized God had spared his life and I want to just say young people God Gave You hunger not to go satisfied on anything else but he gave hunger to you to take you further into the Realms of God Take You Higher and take you higher hunger that's dimensional Take You Higher and Higher into the things of God oh taste and see that the Lord is good we get too heavy we lie too many things to pull us down and you can come and have a good service and you go right back out heavy and go right back to the same habits let those things go now and let him give you everything give you everything stand with me everybody stand with me I wonder if we have a Moses here tonight want to lift a hand say God you spoke to me might not have been a burning bush but it was through a preacher you spoke to my heart there's a lot of hands went off you mean that amen you believe that's God to spoke to you well if he did he didn't speak to you to leave just to leave what's now just talk to your heart let him speak forgiveness let him speak love don't think about what the enemy has done now think about his love let's close our eyes and bow our heads our heavenly father you've led me in this way tonight that I I was not wanting to go this way but you're rich in Mercy Lord you make it uncomfortable for preachers because she loved your children so much do you want to reach a heart Maybe they've listened to the LIE of the enemy he and me told them you can't be free they've raised their hand tonight and say I believe I pray now in the name of Jesus Lord you'll come to that heart father if they want to step out and and ask for prayer they're welcome to do so they also Lord can receive you right there at their sheep can make their heart an altar tonight Lord they say Lord will you create in me Lord a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me O God Lord I'm thirsty for you I'm hungry for you Lord I'm asking you to fill me Lord you don't call me to a burning bush to be silent you call me there to speak to me Father Lord in five minutes time your Prophet said that Moses amen knew more in five minutes than he did in 80 years oh God because it was you Lord and I pray Lord that you're moving these young peoples with such an experience lord they're no in the name of Jesus Lord that it's you dealing with their hearts Lord and the things of the world Amen will fall off of them in Jesus name father may they Lord come with a true repent against the Lord with the Zeal to repent a Zeal to be clean a Zeal to be filled oh God and may it be anchored in your word O Father I speak to the bound one here tonight that the enemy is held and says you can't be free I this word says you can be free don't you know that that that prison door just push it push it Hallelujah it don't have a lock on it hey you know that Jailer he's a liar he said you couldn't walk out of that she said you couldn't be restored them are his thoughts them aren't God's thoughts the book of redemption still being read tonight and it's reading your name

called you to express him tonight will you express it will be expressing Lord expose the enemy may they be free in Jesus name for the glory of God hear the son is set free is free indeed I believe there's liberty here tonight not just this ain't just a young people's meeting this is for all of us this is for me this is for you can you play that song Oh taste and see that the Lord you know that here hallelujah amen do you love him amen this is the first night let's put the enemy under our feet let him know here in Dallas I believe I'll be with your mouth I'll be with you in school amen I'll

every day [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] forever he's worthy to be praised he's teaching us how to fight he's teaching us how to tread on serpents that thing that you've been afraid of the thing that you feared all your life he's teaching you something tonight he's saying you don't have to run anymore you can pick that thing up what was the scripture he said then shall that Wicked be revealed who the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth you put the word in your mouth you speak the word say devil I don't know you you you you you pushed my face down in the muck in the mire in the mud long enough you've held me an anxiety you've held me in pornography you've held me in lust you you've held me in depression you've held me in all of these things but I've heard a word tonight that there's no lock on this prison you've been in a jail cell and there's no luck and all you do by faith you just gotta reach out and push that door open whom the son has made free is free indeed a Roman Triumph [Music] parading around all that had been defeated I got a little inspired I think there's such thing called a bride Triumph cause I know what I was I know when I was in bondage too I know the sin I know the alcohol I know the drugs I know the lust I know the pornography but I heard my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life and it says son I've given you the victory over every one of those Devils if you'll just take me at my word you're my son you're my attribute you're more than a conqueror cause I've made you an overcomer [Music] I'm teaching you how to fight take that thing no longer devil I'm tired of it you don't have to leave here tonight still in bondage look don't don't leave tonight still in bondage don't wait for Saturday night Saturday night might never come but what you do have it's right now and maybe something inside of you says I want to have a bride Triumph that devil that's been trying to ruin my life trying to exalt himself above the stars of God trying to put him in himself in a position that's not given to him you know what has been given to the bride is to put that devil under your feet yeah it starts with a little humility taking off your shoes and saying Lord I'm in the presence of God and now what did he start to do he started to listen to what he was saying what is it that's in your hand what is it in your hand I don't know what it is but whatever's in your hand you give it to God you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a song leader you don't have to you don't have to have position you don't you don't have to have some some something where people are looking you don't have to all you have to have is to know that you're a son and daughter of God and you take that faith because what did he say he said election predestination exposes it exposes the wicked one well what does that mean brother Matthew your election brought you to the house of God tonight it's exposing the devil because he didn't want you to be here but something predestinated you to be here tonight exposing the devil he can't keep you he can't have the victory over you now what are you gonna do you have a choice to mate are you gonna stay in that prison cell are you gonna push it open I say before we leave here let's give God chance what you you you you've you've you've given the world so much of your time and so much of your effort what has it done for you I say give them a chance tonight walk out of that prison don't be afraid fear not it is I so we sing this song again let's not let this moment pass you by if you have a need and you want to walk out of that prison cell take off your shoes and just start walking Lord here I am I can't do it I can't do it Lord tried over and over again

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] God glory [Music] great is our God sing with me [Music] today [Music] friends that is [Music] all right I pray [Music] and it's greatness I believe the Lord certainly spoke test didn't it you know we were told about a devil that shuts his prison doors and that the brother spoke that in brought my heart to a scripture found in Luke in the fourth chapter in the 17th verse and it says there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written yeah the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the Brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are birds you know our brother made a statement to my tonight could you play that song There is a blood Julia you know that song [Music] he made a statement tonight no matter how hard you try you can't do it no matter how hard the preachers pray [Music] no matter how [Music] much they lay their hands on you the difference is the blood [Music] the difference is because one came and he paid a price for your deliverance [Music] and the prison door may be unlocked but sometimes you're just too bruised to open it [Music] but he came and it's him yes thank you Lord that's what's so beautiful about it all I know what it's like to be so lost you can't find your way to be so imprisoned and so addicted that there was nothing that I could do [Music] but I was purchased by a blood and I wouldn't want to go tonight wonderful for the believer to be delivered it's wonderful for those who know him and are not where they're supposed to be to rededicate their life but it's something totally different for them who don't know him who are on the outside and they're lost only he can do that and I don't know tonight if there's one here that doesn't know him they they know that he's not dwelling in them not that you know him and you haven't done or you've done wrong maybe someone that doesn't even know what wrong and right is [Music] but they know they're not with God and they know they're not right with God and they know they're lost [Music] those little ones I wanted to tell you tonight there's a blood there's something that made it possible for you to walk out those doors it's not by will not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord there was a price paid and he said I'll meet you there I'll meet you under that blood [Music] so if you go out tonight and you've determined in your mind that you're not going to do it you've done you've made up your mind tonight's been different when that enemy comes back and starts to suck you back into it I want you to remember one thing there's a blood there is a blood there was a price that was paid there was a life laid down for you and you can look to that person and say Lord I need you I need your help I need you to do this for me I want to be free but I can't go free Lord you purchased me there's a blood and that's what makes the difference tonight that's blood is what allows his Spirit to come unto you because it cleanses you from all unrighteousness just want you to donate [Music] if you know that you're away from him all you can simply do is say Lord I know I'm away from you I know I need you I've got to have you in my life I want you in my life I don't know how to pray I don't know how to act I don't know what to do [Music] but there is three words just three little thoughts that made all the difference in my life I said God to help me God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this [Music] from that point on it was up to him I could do nothing and we can't do nothing without him so I want to close tonight with this song and I want you when you leave this [Music] place tonight I want you to know that there was somebody that went to Calvary he had Nails driven in his hands he was scourged and his side was pierced so that door could be open and you owe everything [Music] to him and he loves you [Music] that's why he died for you no greater love hath than man than to lay down his life and God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so as we go tonight rejoicing in the word of God knowing that we've been set free let's not forget what set us free it wasn't our ability to push that door open and it wasn't our ability to walk out it was that there was a price paid and a power given the gift of God blessed any man should boast the wonderful love [Music] all can you imagine when we can reach the Lost Lord help us reach the loss May that blood shine in our life into the person that I'm talking to and they know I'm talking to them I want you to know that there's a blood there's a Jesus that died and that's your only hope it's your only strength it's the only thing that can help you don't be afraid to ask him to touch you [Music] there is [Music] lies [Music] that's why we're here tonight [Music] in my life [Music] all right daddy says [Music] alive [Music] it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] my soul [Music] I am [Music] before tonight everybody's eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] I want to Proclaim to you he's coming back God bless you you're invited to Matthew's house all those that he mentioned young people host families and things if you want to have Fellowship but you don't have to run away if you want to sit and pray you praying so I wanted to Proclaim that to you that he's alive he dries the tears he's saves he's the same yesterday today and forever let us pray father God what a wonderful words of life tonight Lord that those prison doors became unlocked because of the blood of calvary you turn the key Lord and now it's just a lie that holds us because you've forgiven us of all of our sins [Music] and Lord we ask this evening that you because you're real and you're alive and you're a person that you would come by and touch those that don't know you tonight father that you would bring them into the Sheepfold that they may grow in the blessings of your loving kindness that they might know the riches of your mercy and the power of your grace for father it's our hearts desire that no soul would be lost but all would come to the knowledge of you Lord Jesus that little soul tonight father I believe you're going to work a great work of redemption because we've spoken in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you are just this could you please stay for those that would like to stay those who that need to go God bless you you're free to go tonight amen [Music] not to know what time it is [Music] and bodies families restored because we stay here yeah foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I never wanted to live my heart is [Music] in your presence [Music] [Applause] in your presence [Music] yes I want more Jesus I want more I want more I want more I Want More Jesus I want more so I will stay where else could I go my heart is burning [Music] so I will stay I don't want you to go [Music] in your presence alone [Music] I don't want you to go oh no oh Lord heartburns in your presence alone
