[34:17] let's turn to exodus the
[34:21] 23rd chapter and read the
[34:24] 20th 21st and
[34:28] 22nd verse and then we've been studying
[34:31] this message called who is this
[34:33] melchizedek
[34:35] and we have 37 minutes left
[34:38] in the book so we're going to just
[34:41] listen to those 37 minutes
[34:43] and then we're going to do a little
[34:46] something at the end of
[34:48] service and so it'll it won't
[34:51] take us very long just 37 minutes so
[34:53] let's
[34:54] read here in 23 20.
[34:57] it says behold i send an
[35:00] angel before thee to keep thee
[35:04] in the way
[35:08] and to bring thee into the place
[35:11] which i have prepared amen isn't that
[35:15] our heart's desire
[35:16] we need something to keep us on the path
[35:20] and we need something to bring us to the
[35:22] prepared place
[35:24] amen isn't that what the lord said i go
[35:27] to prepare a place for you
[35:29] amen and then he sent the spirit there
[35:32] to
[35:33] lead us he said beware of him and that's
[35:36] in other words that's a
[35:38] way of saying respect him don't be
[35:40] afraid of him
[35:41] but to be aware of his presence in other
[35:44] words be
[35:45] be timid and and
[35:52] aware and and always be
[35:55] sensing his presence in other words that
[35:58] this angel
[35:59] is in your life and he's by you beware
[36:03] of him
[36:04] and obey his voice provoke him not
[36:08] for he will not pardon your
[36:10] transgressions
[36:11] for my name
[36:14] is in him but if thou
[36:18] shall indeed obey his voice
[36:22] and do all that i speak
[36:25] then i will be an enemy
[36:28] unto thy enemies and an adversary
[36:32] unto thy adversaries amen how many love
[36:35] heaven god on
[36:37] your side amen just think if god be for
[36:41] you
[36:42] who can be against you amen and
[36:45] when he's on your side i don't care
[36:48] where your
[36:48] place is in your life or how far you
[36:51] might be away
[36:52] from things he's just got a marvelous
[36:54] way of making things work out
[36:57] he certainly can take the the
[37:00] person that's in the depth of sin and
[37:03] wash them and make him whole so
[37:05] he's a great god that can really do
[37:07] marvelous wonderful things
[37:09] we're just going to play this 36 minutes
[37:12] i know you might
[37:13] not be used to listening but if you
[37:16] could just
[37:17] tune your ear and enjoy the things that
[37:20] are spoken
[37:21] as we finish this a great study and
[37:26] i i do know also this weekend that

[37:47] the van

[38:20] amazing stuff if you can catch the
[38:22] revelation so have your seat
[38:24] god bless you enjoy this 37 minutes
[38:29] one day i was told a story
[38:32] of peter and andrew's brother
[38:36] they were fishermen and
[38:39] their father jonas was a great old
[38:42] believer one day they said he sit down
[38:45] on the side of the boat
[38:47] he said sons you know how we prayed
[38:50] when we needed fish there's commercial
[38:52] fishermen
[38:54] he said we've trusted god jehovah
[38:57] for our living i'm getting old now i
[39:00] can't stay with you boys much longer
[39:02] and i've always as all true believers
[39:05] have looked for the time when that
[39:06] messiah will come
[39:09] we've got all kinds of falsehoods but
[39:11] there's coming a real one someday
[39:14] he said when this messiah comes i don't
[39:16] want you boys to be deceived
[39:18] this messiah will not be just a
[39:21] theologian
[39:23] he will be a prophet
[39:26] for our prophet moses of whom we follow
[39:30] he said now any jew will believe he's
[39:32] prophet he's taught to know that
[39:34] and if the prophet says anything it's so
[39:37] then that's true but god said if there
[39:38] be one among you spiritual or prophet
[39:40] how the lord will make myself known to
[39:42] him and what he says comes to pass and
[39:44] hear him
[39:44] and fear him but if it don't then don't
[39:47] hear him at all see
[39:48] so that was a the vindication of the
[39:51] prophet
[39:52] so moses was truly a vindicated prophet
[39:55] and he said the lord your god shall
[39:57] raise up among you
[39:59] out of your brethren a prophet like unto
[40:02] me and all that won't hear him will be
[40:04] cut off from the people
[40:05] he said now children remember that as
[40:08] hebrews
[40:09] we believe god's vindicated prophets
[40:13] now listen close don't miss it
[40:17] and he said when the messiah comes you
[40:19] will know him for he will be
[40:21] a prophet messiah i said it's been 400
[40:25] years
[40:26] we haven't had a prophet since malachi
[40:29] but he'll be
[40:31] one day after his death a few years
[40:36] his son andrew was strolling along down
[40:39] the bank
[40:40] and he heard a wild man out of the
[40:42] wilderness saying
[40:43] that messiah is standing among you now
[40:47] that big eagle it raised up over the
[40:49] wilderness and flew over there
[40:51] said the messiah is among you right now
[40:53] we don't know him yet
[40:54] but he's standing among you i know him
[40:56] because i see a sign
[40:58] coming from heaven one day he said
[41:01] there behold is the lamb of god that
[41:04] takes away the sin of the world
[41:06] away went when this man defined his
[41:10] brother said simon
[41:11] i want you to come over here we've done
[41:14] found the messiah
[41:15] all gone andrew you know better than
[41:18] that
[41:18] oh i know but that this man is different
[41:21] where is he
[41:22] where'd he come from jesus of nazareth
[41:25] that little
[41:25] wicked city well it couldn't come from a
[41:28] wicked dirty place like that
[41:30] you just come and see finally persuaded
[41:32] him to come down one day
[41:34] so when he come in the front of this
[41:35] messiah jesus standing there speaking to
[41:38] the people
[41:38] when he walked up in front of me said
[41:40] your name
[41:41] is simon and you are the son of jonas
[41:47] that did it he got the keys to the
[41:51] kingdom
[41:52] why he knowed that
[41:56] that man did not know him
[41:59] and how did he know him and that about
[42:01] the old fatherhood
[42:02] taught him how to believe the messiah
[42:05] there was a man standing there by the
[42:07] name of philip oh he got really excited
[42:10] he knows another man had been studying
[42:11] the bible with away he went around the
[42:13] hill
[42:14] and he found him out there in his uh
[42:17] olive grove
[42:18] he was kneeling down praying that had
[42:20] lots of bible lessons together
[42:22] so he come out there and he said after
[42:24] he got to praying he said
[42:26] um come see who we found
[42:30] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph he's
[42:33] the messiah we're looking for
[42:34] now i can hear nathaniel say now philip
[42:37] you ain't one off on the deep end are
[42:39] you oh no
[42:40] no now let me tell you you know we've
[42:42] been studying the bible together
[42:44] and what did the prophet say the messiah
[42:46] would be he'd be a prophet
[42:47] you remember that old fishman you bought
[42:49] the fish from it didn't have enough
[42:50] education to sign his name
[42:52] called simon yep he'd come up
[42:55] and you know what this jesus of nazareth
[42:58] told him and his name was simon
[43:00] changed his name to peter which is
[43:02] little stone and told him who his daddy
[43:04] was
[43:06] well he said he said i don't know could
[43:09] anything good come out of nazareth he
[43:11] said let's not talk about it just come
[43:12] on and see
[43:14] that's a good idea come and see so here
[43:16] come philip
[43:17] bringing up nathanael and when he got
[43:20] walking up jesus probably standing
[43:22] speaking
[43:23] probably praying for the sick and the
[43:24] prayer line and when he
[43:26] come up to where jesus was jesus looked
[43:28] around at him and said behold an
[43:29] israelite in whom there's no god
[43:33] now you say well his way is dressed oh
[43:35] no all easterners dressed the same
[43:38] you could have been a syrian or been
[43:39] anything else
[43:41] beard garment he said behold an
[43:43] israelite
[43:44] in whom there's no god and otherwise an
[43:46] honest sincere man
[43:48] well that kind of deflated nathanael and
[43:50] he said
[43:51] rabbi which means teacher rabbi
[43:55] when did you ever know me how did you
[43:58] know i was a jew
[43:59] how did you know i was honest no god
[44:02] he said before philip called you when
[44:05] you were under the tree
[44:06] i saw you amen
[44:10] 15 miles away the other side of the
[44:13] country
[44:13] the day before what did he say rabbi
[44:17] you are the son of god you are the king
[44:21] of israel
[44:22] but there's to those priests there
[44:24] self-styled self-starts
[44:26] that this man is beelzebub a fortune
[44:29] teller
[44:30] jesus said i'll forgive you for that
[44:32] remember they never said it out loud
[44:34] but they said it in their hearts and he
[44:36] perceived their thoughts
[44:39] that's right what the bible says
[44:43] call it telepathy if you want to but he
[44:46] he perceived their thoughts
[44:48] and he said i forgive you for that
[44:51] but someday the holy ghost is going to
[44:54] come and do the same thing
[44:55] after he's going speak a word against it
[44:58] will never be forgiven in this world the
[44:59] world to come
[45:00] is that right oh that were jews
[45:05] then one day he had need to go to
[45:08] samaria
[45:09] but just before we do that we found the
[45:12] woman
[45:12] or the the man as he
[45:16] went through the gate call beautiful
[45:18] that he was healed and jesus known his
[45:20] condition
[45:21] and told him to take up your bed and go
[45:23] on home and he did it
[45:24] he got well then we find out the jews
[45:29] some of them received him some believe
[45:31] it some didn't
[45:32] why did they believe it it was not
[45:34] ordained to lie
[45:36] they wasn't part of that attribute i
[45:38] remember them were priest and great man
[45:41] and jesus think of those theologians and
[45:43] priests
[45:45] man that you couldn't find a flaw in
[45:47] their life jesus said
[45:48] you are of your father the devil
[45:52] and his works you do said if you'd be of
[45:54] god you'd believe me
[45:56] if you can't believe me be believe the
[45:57] works that i do they testify who i
[46:00] am now
[46:03] the bible said that jesus is the same
[46:05] yesterday today and forever
[46:08] jesus said the works that i do shall he
[46:11] that believeth on me
[46:12] do also that right
[46:16] notice that was a real melchizedek now
[46:19] i notice again there was only three
[46:22] races of people
[46:25] you heard me say i was a segregationist
[46:28] i
[46:28] am all christians are segregationists
[46:30] not segregation of color
[46:32] but segregation of spirit a man's color
[46:36] of his skin has nothing to do with it
[46:38] he's a child of god by birth
[46:41] but a christian god said separate me
[46:43] come out from among him and so forth
[46:45] he is a segregationist a filth between
[46:48] right and wrong
[46:50] but notice they had a segregation and
[46:53] a racial segregation which was the
[46:56] samaritans
[46:57] and there's only three races of people
[46:58] on the earth
[47:00] if we believe the bible that is ham
[47:03] sham and japan's people that's the three
[47:06] sons of noah we all sprung from there
[47:09] right that makes us all back from adam
[47:12] which makes us all brothers
[47:14] the bible said of one blood god created
[47:17] all nations
[47:19] we're all brothers to
[47:23] the blood stream a colored man to give a
[47:25] white man a blood transfusion or vice
[47:27] versa
[47:28] the white man can give the the japanese
[47:30] yellow man or the indian the red man or
[47:32] what more
[47:34] or japanese or whatever
[47:37] he could give him a blood transfusion
[47:39] because we're all the same blood
[47:41] the color of our skin where we lived had
[47:43] nothing to do with it
[47:44] but when we're segregated it's when we
[47:46] come out of the world
[47:49] like he brought israel up out of egypt
[47:52] that's when we're segregated from the
[47:53] things of the world
[47:55] now there was a hand sham and james
[47:59] people
[48:00] and if we had time to run the
[48:01] genealogies back you could see the
[48:03] anglo-saxon where he come from
[48:05] now that was the jew the samaritan which
[48:08] was
[48:08] half jew and gentile that married in
[48:10] with the gentiles
[48:12] at balaam's doings
[48:16] and moab they were samaritans
[48:20] and there was jews and gentiles
[48:23] now we anger saxon had nothing to do
[48:26] with any of it we didn't believe any
[48:28] messiah
[48:28] or nothing else we wasn't looking for
[48:30] one we were brought in afterwards
[48:34] jesus came to his own and his own
[48:37] received him not
[48:38] and he said to his disciples don't go in
[48:40] the way of the gentiles but go rather to
[48:42] the lost sheep of israel
[48:44] and he went only to the lost sheep of
[48:48] israel
[48:49] and watch he manifested himself as son
[48:51] of man
[48:52] before the jews they turn it down now
[48:55] the samaritan being half jew and gentile
[48:58] they believed also and was looking for a
[49:00] messiah
[49:02] we wasn't we were heathens with clubs on
[49:04] our back worshiping idols
[49:06] the gentiles but now one day saint john
[49:09] 4
[49:10] he had need to go by samaria on his road
[49:13] down to jericho
[49:15] but was went up around samaria and while
[49:17] he was going up there
[49:19] he sat down on the well outside of a
[49:21] city called psycho
[49:23] and the well if you've ever been there
[49:25] it's a little panoramic about like this
[49:27] year
[49:27] and there's a public spring there a
[49:29] water where they all come and
[49:31] women come up the morning get their pots
[49:32] of water and put it on their head and
[49:34] one on each ship
[49:35] walk with it just as straight as it can
[49:36] be never spill or drop talk to one
[49:38] another
[49:39] so they were the people come out there
[49:41] so this is about 11 o'clock today
[49:43] so he sent his disciples into the city
[49:46] to buy some fiddles
[49:49] food and while they were gone there was
[49:52] a woman which was ill-famed
[49:55] oh we'd call her today a red light woman
[49:57] or prostitute
[49:59] she had too many husbands so while jesus
[50:02] is sitting there
[50:03] this woman come out about 11 o'clock see
[50:05] she couldn't come with the
[50:06] virgins when they come in the morning to
[50:09] get their wash water
[50:10] she had to wait till they all they
[50:11] didn't mix like they do now
[50:13] she was marked so then she come out to
[50:16] get some water
[50:17] so she just tucked the old window and
[50:19] put the hooks over the jar
[50:21] and started to let it down she heard
[50:23] somebody say woman
[50:25] bring me a drink i remember
[50:28] this is melchizedek this is jesus
[50:31] yesterday
[50:32] the son of man and she looked around and
[50:36] she saw a jew
[50:38] so she said uh sir it's not proper
[50:42] for a jew to ask the samaritan for
[50:44] anything i'm the woman of samara
[50:46] so you have spoken out of your place you
[50:49] shouldn't have asked me such a thing is
[50:50] that we have no dealings with one
[50:52] another
[50:52] he said but if you knew who was talking
[50:54] to you
[50:55] you would ask me for a drink she said
[50:57] are you gonna draw it the whales deem
[50:59] you have nothing to roll with
[51:00] he said the water i give is water of
[51:02] life springing up in the eternal life
[51:05] he talked to her until he found what her
[51:07] condition was
[51:09] and that's what watch what he said to
[51:10] her now go get your husband and come
[51:13] here
[51:15] and she said i have no husband he said
[51:18] you've said the truth
[51:20] or you've had five and the one you now
[51:23] are living with is not yours
[51:25] so in this you said the truth what's the
[51:27] difference between that woman and that
[51:29] bunch of priests
[51:31] she know more about god and that whole
[51:33] bunch of priests did put together
[51:36] she said sir i perceive that you are a
[51:39] prophet
[51:41] she said we haven't had one for 400
[51:43] years
[51:44] now we know that the messiah is coming
[51:47] and when the messiah comes
[51:48] that's what he's going to do
[51:51] that was the sign of the messiah for he
[51:54] was the son of man
[51:57] he said that's what he's going to do
[51:59] when he comes you must be his prophet
[52:01] he said i am he
[52:05] nobody else could say that she dropped
[52:08] that water pot and run into the city
[52:10] and said come see a man who told me what
[52:13] i've done
[52:15] isn't this the very messiah
[52:18] now remember he promised to do that
[52:21] same thing at the end of the gentile
[52:24] race
[52:26] the jews that had 4 000 years
[52:29] to look for that messiah four thousand
[52:32] years of teaching he was coming
[52:34] and what he would do when he got there
[52:35] and they failed a scene or fail to
[52:37] recognize it
[52:39] and when he made himself known in the
[52:41] very bible terms that he said he would
[52:43] when he'd been a theophany and then
[52:45] become flesh and dwelt among
[52:47] them they failed to sin and call these
[52:50] works the works of the devil
[52:54] now we've had 2 000 years of teaching
[52:57] coming down to the roman catholic church
[52:59] answer the apostles
[53:01] then we come down to the roman catholic
[53:02] the greek and so forth on down to
[53:04] luther's age and wesley
[53:06] what more 900 different organizations
[53:09] coming down they had all these ages
[53:10] teaching now he promised
[53:12] just before the end time would come
[53:16] that this picture of sodom and gomorrah
[53:18] would again as it was in the days of
[53:20] sodom
[53:21] so shall it be in the coming of the end
[53:24] times
[53:24] the son of man will reveal himself again
[53:28] yet a little while and the world won't
[53:30] see me no more
[53:32] yet you shall see me for i am
[53:35] a personal pronoun i will be with you
[53:38] even
[53:39] in you to the consummation the end of
[53:42] the world
[53:43] i'll be with you he's the same yesterday
[53:46] today and forever
[53:50] you see you see
[53:54] the samaritan was actually from my last
[53:57] night's sermon
[53:58] was anger see a perverted type
[54:02] the jew was sarah or was
[54:05] saranike but the gentile is of mary the
[54:09] royal seed
[54:10] abraham's royal sea now it's promised
[54:12] that in these last days
[54:14] that this same god
[54:18] the same christ would come back here and
[54:22] reveal himself
[54:23] as son of man why he's the same
[54:26] yesterday there forever
[54:27] and if he let those jews go by with
[54:30] and give them that messiah sign
[54:34] and then come to the end of the gentiles
[54:36] teaching and let them miss going on
[54:38] theology
[54:39] he would be unjust he's
[54:42] got to do the same thing because the
[54:44] bible said in 13
[54:45] hebrews 13 8 he is the same and he's
[54:49] promised in malachi 4 and all the
[54:52] different scriptures that
[54:53] the last days the church would be
[54:55] setting just exactly like it is today
[54:57] and the world would be
[54:59] look at the world today look at the
[55:02] solemn condition
[55:04] look at the earthquakes and divers
[55:06] places and the things that's taking
[55:07] place
[55:08] look at the church in the mess it's in a
[55:09] babbler
[55:11] look at the messenger to it on oral
[55:14] roberts
[55:14] and a billy graham g-r-a-h-a-m first
[55:18] time we ever had a messenger
[55:20] to all the churches that his hand name
[55:22] ever end in h.a.m like abraham
[55:25] a-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters
[55:28] g-r-a-h-a-m is six letters
[55:33] where's he at to the world six is man's
[55:35] number man was created on the sixth
[55:37] eighth
[55:37] but seven is god's number
[55:41] now look at them down there in solomon
[55:44] and there is
[55:44] our messengers down there speaking to
[55:47] him amen
[55:48] but then where's that seed of abraham
[55:51] amen
[55:52] amen where is their sign that is that as
[55:55] it was
[55:57] in the days of silence that god came
[56:00] down and was manifested in human flesh
[56:05] and told what sarah was thinking back in
[56:08] her heart
[56:08] in the tent behind him the last sign
[56:11] before the gentile world was destroyed
[56:13] by fire
[56:15] the church has got its last sign before
[56:18] the whole world is going to be destroyed
[56:20] this gentile kingdom be destroyed
[56:23] by the fire and wrath of god you believe
[56:26] that
[56:27] that male casualty was fleshy
[56:31] representing himself in a human body
[56:34] and then later he was made flesh
[56:38] and now tonight he's the same yesterday
[56:40] today and forever
[56:42] do you believe it who is this
[56:44] melchizedek man
[56:47] that's the same yesterday never had no
[56:49] father
[56:50] never had no mother he never had no
[56:52] beginning of
[56:53] days he never had any in the life
[56:56] and he met abraham and what kind of a
[56:58] sign did he perform
[57:00] then when he was made flesh he said it
[57:02] would repeat again just before the end
[57:04] time
[57:05] you believe that i believe it
[57:10] let's pray dear god
[57:16] i believe the scriptures
[57:19] that you have said you was the same
[57:21] yesterday and forever
[57:23] and as sincerely in my heart lord i know
[57:26] that something's fixing to take place
[57:30] i cannot strictly identify i'm afraid to
[57:32] say anything lord
[57:34] thou knowest the heart of your servants
[57:38] and how many times down to the age when
[57:41] you sent things
[57:42] people fail to get it man is constantly
[57:45] praising god for what he did
[57:48] and saying what great things he's going
[57:50] to do but ignoring what he's doing
[57:53] so has it been through the age why did
[57:55] the roman church
[57:57] fail to see st patrick as god's prophet
[58:00] why did they kill joan of arc when she
[58:04] was a
[58:04] a prophetess burner as a witch
[58:09] father it's always past you hide it from
[58:12] the eyes of the wise and prudent
[58:13] no wonder you said to them priests you
[58:16] garnish the
[58:17] tombs of the prophets and you're the one
[58:19] that put them in there
[58:20] after they're gone they see their
[58:22] mistake they always
[58:24] persecute you lord in whatever form you
[58:26] come in
[58:27] i pray tonight god just one more time
[58:31] tomorrow we're scheduled to be to go to
[58:34] tucson other parts of the world other
[58:37] cities
[58:37] we must preach in but dear god there
[58:40] might be strangers here tonight
[58:42] that never has they've heard words
[58:44] preached but never seen it made manifest
[58:47] as i asked you at the beginning
[58:50] when those disciples theopis and his
[58:54] friend
[58:54] coming from emmaus was walking along the
[58:58] road
[58:58] and you stepped out of the bush and
[59:00] began to talk to him after the
[59:01] resurrection
[59:02] preached to them why said fool slow of
[59:05] heart
[59:06] don't you know that christ should suffer
[59:07] these things and enter into his glory
[59:09] but still they never recognized it all
[59:11] day long they walked with you and still
[59:13] didn't know you
[59:14] but one night night come they
[59:17] constrained you to come in
[59:18] when they went into the little end and
[59:20] closed the doors then you did something
[59:22] just the way you did it
[59:24] before your crucifixion and they
[59:26] recognized that it was the risen christ
[59:28] in a few moments he is behind the
[59:30] curtains and gone quickly they run
[59:33] and told the disciples the lord is risen
[59:35] indeed
[59:36] father god i believe that you're still
[59:39] alive
[59:41] i know you are and you've proved it to
[59:44] us so many times
[59:45] could you just do it once more for us
[59:47] lord
[59:48] if we found grace in your sight let it
[59:50] happen once more
[59:52] i am your servant these are your
[59:54] servants in here
[59:55] lord all that i've said wouldn't mount
[59:58] to just one word from you would be more
[1:00:01] and i've said in these five nights
[1:00:04] or five messages it would be more just
[1:00:07] one word from you won't you speak lord
[1:00:09] that the people might know that i've
[1:00:11] told them the truth
[1:00:13] granted god i asked it in jesus name
[1:00:16] this once more amen
[1:00:21] now
[1:00:24] i don't know you i know some people i

[1:01:06] now it would be totally absolutely
[1:01:10] totally impossible for me to know
[1:01:12] anything about you
[1:01:13] otherwise then have to come from some
[1:01:15] revelation of spirit
[1:01:16] and being i've told you all these nights
[1:01:19] and tonight
[1:01:20] that he is not dead he's here and
[1:01:23] promised to do the same thing
[1:01:24] and promise that there would come a time
[1:01:27] in the last days according to malachi
[1:01:29] 4 and according to saint luke that he
[1:01:32] would appear again
[1:01:33] in human form among his people and do
[1:01:36] the same things and reveal the same
[1:01:38] thing
[1:01:39] the same the psych side how many knows
[1:01:41] that you bible readers knows that's a
[1:01:42] true say amen
[1:01:45] must all be bible readers now i know
[1:01:48] it's
[1:01:49] foreign to the people today but still
[1:01:51] it's the truth
[1:01:52] that's the reason they didn't know jesus
[1:01:54] of nazareth they know their church
[1:01:55] creeds
[1:01:56] but they didn't know him but he come
[1:01:58] just the way the bible said
[1:02:00] not a theologian not a priest
[1:02:04] he come as a prophet
[1:02:08] and his own received him not now if god
[1:02:11] will keep his word
[1:02:13] and if i happen to it happens to fall on
[1:02:15] someone that i know
[1:02:17] then i'll get someone else say i want
[1:02:20] somebody
[1:02:21] and i don't know and i want you to pray
[1:02:25] now look there's a little woman one time
[1:02:27] had an infirmity
[1:02:29] she spent her money for the doctors they
[1:02:32] could do her no good
[1:02:33] and she said within her heart if i
[1:02:36] can touch that man's garments i'll be
[1:02:40] made well you remember the story
[1:02:42] and so all of them tried to get her to
[1:02:44] stay back but she pressed through
[1:02:46] until she touched his garment went back
[1:02:48] and sat down
[1:02:51] now listen close and then when he did
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:54] when she did that
[1:02:57] jesus turned around and said who touched
[1:02:59] me
[1:03:00] why peter the apostle rebuked him
[1:03:03] he might have said something that lord
[1:03:05] don't say a thing like that
[1:03:07] the people believe there's something
[1:03:08] wrong with you because when you ask them
[1:03:10] to eat your flesh and drink your blood
[1:03:13] they already think there's something
[1:03:14] wrong and you say who touched me
[1:03:16] well the whole crowds are touching you
[1:03:18] he said yes
[1:03:19] but i perceived that virtue went out of
[1:03:22] me
[1:03:23] that was a different kind of touch and
[1:03:25] anybody knows that virtue is strength
[1:03:28] i got weak virtue
[1:03:31] left me and he looked around on the
[1:03:34] audience
[1:03:36] until he found the little woman and told
[1:03:39] her
[1:03:40] about her blood issue and she felt in
[1:03:42] her body that that
[1:03:44] bloody issue had stopped is that right
[1:03:46] and he said
[1:03:47] thy faith has saved me now the greek
[1:03:51] word there is sozo
[1:03:52] which absolutely means say physically or
[1:03:54] spiritual just the same you say
[1:03:56] he is your savior now
[1:03:59] if that was him yesterday and the way he
[1:04:02] acted to prove that he was among the
[1:04:04] people
[1:04:04] the messiah promised and that's the way
[1:04:07] he identified himself and promised with
[1:04:09] the bible
[1:04:10] he'd do the same thing now wouldn't he
[1:04:12] wouldn't you have to do the same thing
[1:04:14] you say did he say it about healing the
[1:04:18] sick
[1:04:19] yeah the hebrews
[1:04:23] the bible had just read from said that
[1:04:26] jesus christ now
[1:04:27] is our high priest that can be touched
[1:04:30] by the feeling of our infirmities how
[1:04:32] many knows that's true
[1:04:34] the bible said that he's a high priest
[1:04:36] now
[1:04:37] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:04:38] our infirmities then if he's the same
[1:04:40] high priest
[1:04:42] that he was then how would he act now
[1:04:45] he'd have to act the same way he did
[1:04:47] then
[1:04:48] if he's the same high priest now you
[1:04:51] might
[1:04:51] i'm not your high priest you might touch
[1:04:54] me and just be like touching your
[1:04:55] husband or your
[1:04:56] brother or what more a man but you let
[1:04:59] your faith touch him
[1:05:01] and watch what happens now
[1:05:05] if i be god's servant and have told you
[1:05:08] the truth
[1:05:10] god will vindicate that to be the truth
[1:05:13] and that would prove that jesus christ
[1:05:16] is the living tonight standing here
[1:05:22] is that right now you have faith
[1:05:25] this one side of time
[1:05:29] one side you have faith out there
[1:05:32] i better stay at the microphone here
[1:05:33] because you can't hear me
[1:05:36] somebody just look up to god
[1:05:40] and say god that man don't know me
[1:05:43] he knows nothing about me i'm a perfect
[1:05:46] stranger to him
[1:05:51] let my faith touch you lord and
[1:05:54] you know what's the matter with me lord
[1:05:56] you know all about me you know who i am
[1:05:58] the same as you know who peter was
[1:06:03] same as you know nathanael as you know
[1:06:06] what was wrong with the woman with the
[1:06:07] blood issue
[1:06:09] and this man tells me
[1:06:12] that you're the same yesterday and
[1:06:13] forever then lord let my faith touch you
[1:06:17] if he'll do that and then fallibly prove
[1:06:21] himself here
[1:06:22] how many of you will believe him with
[1:06:23] all your heart if you're doing at least
[1:06:25] one or two or three people for a witness
[1:06:28] god bless you
[1:06:30] now father god this is totally out of
[1:06:33] the hands of any man
[1:06:36] it'll have to be supernatural phenomenal
[1:06:40] so i pray that you'll help me now lord
[1:06:42] i'm in your hands
[1:06:44] do with me as you see fit
[1:06:48] in jesus name amen
[1:06:54] uh don't be nervous just
[1:06:57] humbly reverently say lord i'll serve
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:01] and that'll be a truth that if i can
[1:07:03] touch your garment
[1:07:04] then you speak back through that man
[1:07:07] that will prove to me that what he said
[1:07:08] is the truth
[1:07:11] that right
[1:07:15] how many ever seen a picture of that
[1:07:16] light it's all over the country
[1:07:19] everywhere
[1:07:20] science is talking examine it never work

[1:07:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:38] he's the same
[1:07:49] now there's a woman

[1:07:55] happening that light's hanging right
[1:07:56] over

[1:08:07] strangers to one another
[1:08:10] that is right
[1:08:13] do you believe that god your your need
[1:08:16] of something
[1:08:18] and you believe that god can reveal to
[1:08:21] me what your trouble
[1:08:22] is and if he does then you know
[1:08:26] it'll have to be a supernatural power
[1:08:29] because i don't know you
[1:08:31] it'll have to come through supernatural
[1:08:33] depends on what you think it is
[1:08:35] you can take your side with the priest
[1:08:37] call it the devil
[1:08:38] or you take the side of the believer and
[1:08:39] call it god every which you believe
[1:08:41] that's where your reward will come from
[1:08:44] if god will reveal to me your trouble
[1:08:46] will you accept him as your
[1:08:48] your atonement for that trouble i don't
[1:08:51] know what the trouble
[1:08:51] is but i know and you know that
[1:08:54] something's going on

[1:15:53] that's it amen hallelujah
[1:16:08] jesus christ
[1:16:22] now you know who melchizedek is
[1:16:26] amen it wasn't the flesh man
[1:16:30] it was the god the same god that dwells
[1:16:34] in you
[1:16:35] if you have his spirit because remember
[1:16:37] if it's the same
[1:16:38] spirit that was in jesus christ dwell in
[1:16:42] you
[1:16:42] it will also quicken your mortal body
[1:16:46] what spirit was in him the word
[1:16:49] that word spirit was the spirit of god
[1:16:53] amen it's just quite a blessing but
[1:16:57] anyway we'll we'll go into some more
[1:17:00] of things later i won't be here i won't
[1:17:02] preach next sunday
[1:17:04] i'll try to grab the wednesday in
[1:17:06] between and then i have to go to
[1:17:08] missouri and help that church
[1:17:10] until they get a pastor i promised my
[1:17:13] friend
[1:17:14] before his death that i would do that
[1:17:16] for him
[1:17:17] and then we're going to cover some uh
[1:17:20] questions
[1:17:21] that we have about the son of man about
[1:17:24] melchizedek
[1:17:25] one of the great questions that's there
[1:17:27] it's a good question
[1:17:29] and is and the question is did the
[1:17:31] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:17:34] dwell in brother brown and we're going
[1:17:36] to cover that
[1:17:37] and we could show you why it dwelt in
[1:17:40] jesus
[1:17:41] and then we'll lay it right down there
[1:17:44] right down the line the word of god
[1:17:46] there's got to be a word answer for
[1:17:48] every question
[1:17:50] there's no question that's not good
[1:17:54] you understand sometimes the question is
[1:17:58] just the key issue that kept
[1:18:01] keeping you from breaking in to
[1:18:05] a revelation and then as a pastor if
[1:18:08] people are talking about it in the
[1:18:09] parking lot and
[1:18:10] talking in my congregation then i know
[1:18:13] all
[1:18:13] uh a good answer for all the sheep both
[1:18:16] for the people that have the question
[1:18:19] uh people that that uh uh are wondering
[1:18:23] and then that's what brings us into
[1:18:25] unity in christ jesus because we all
[1:18:28] have one word
[1:18:29] and the word of god is based on
[1:18:31] revelation and so what we saw tonight is
[1:18:34] we saw that there was a promise in the
[1:18:36] scriptures
[1:18:37] for something to happen and the
[1:18:40] scripture
[1:18:41] promise was fulfilled but like in
[1:18:44] every age it's not doesn't always come
[1:18:46] according to man's teaching
[1:18:49] so it takes divine revelation and so you
[1:18:52] know if there's a question
[1:18:54] in your heart about the things that are
[1:18:56] said
[1:18:57] and you love the lord then ask god
[1:19:02] just pray ask him for a revelation
[1:19:05] and he he he loves you he
[1:19:09] he just didn't die for the people that
[1:19:11] are in this church
[1:19:13] or or the people that have the
[1:19:14] revelation that you have
[1:19:16] he died for the muslims he died for the
[1:19:20] hindus
[1:19:21] he died for the sheiks and the jains
[1:19:24] he died for the heathen you know his
[1:19:27] blood sacrifice
[1:19:29] is there for anybody and god will heal
[1:19:32] anybody that believes in him healing is
[1:19:36] not
[1:19:36] specific to one ministry there's
[1:19:39] many men that pray for the sick
[1:19:42] we should pray for the sick because
[1:19:45] jesus commanded us to go into all the
[1:19:47] world
[1:19:48] preach the gospel lay hands on the sick
[1:19:51] and they shall
[1:19:52] recover so also he wants more of him
[1:19:56] and understanding his spirit tonight
[1:19:59] i just wanted to take a moment this is
[1:20:03] brother adrian's uh uh last sunday with
[1:20:07] us
[1:20:08] uh he's going on a little journey before
[1:20:10] he returns back home
[1:20:12] and so we've been uh we're gonna
[1:20:15] do a little something for him and just a
[1:20:17] little way
[1:20:18] but right now i'd like him to come are
[1:20:20] you in here brother you've got to be
[1:20:21] here somewhere
[1:20:25] oh go get him he's not he's not escaping
[1:20:31] he's got his baby blanket that's good
[1:20:33] you don't need the baby banker brother
[1:20:35] just feel
[1:20:36] but anyway come on up and i just want
[1:20:38] you to tell the people
[1:20:40] uh to say what's on your heart tell the
[1:20:42] people about the vision you have and
[1:20:44] why the lord's doing with you in your
[1:20:46] life and and to just say a few words and
[1:20:49] then
[1:20:50] we want to uh
[1:20:57] we it's it's really hard for us to say
[1:21:01] goodbye um but um we believe
[1:21:05] that the lord is leading us in a
[1:21:07] different town
[1:21:09] and uh it's hard to leave family and to
[1:21:12] leave good friends and
[1:21:13] brothers and sisters behind but
[1:21:17] the word of the lord has been working on
[1:21:18] our heart and
[1:21:20] we believe that um you know the lord's
[1:21:24] leading us to a different city
[1:21:26] to minister to the people that um
[1:21:29] you know are in that place and um
[1:21:32] as brother david said you know we're not
[1:21:34] sure for how long
[1:21:35] and we're not sure what the lord has in
[1:21:37] store for us but we believe that that's
[1:21:39] the plan
[1:21:40] that the lord has for us and our family
[1:21:42] and uh
[1:21:43] like i said the word of the lord has
[1:21:44] been dealing with our hearts
[1:21:47] and uh you know made us feel guilty that
[1:21:51] we have such a good church
[1:21:53] and uh you know uh you know the lord
[1:21:57] spoke to my heart and you know
[1:21:58] in a way said what about the ones that
[1:22:00] are in the dark what about the ones that
[1:22:03] you know um they're hungering for the
[1:22:06] same thing that we have
[1:22:07] and uh we have such a great message
[1:22:11] that i believe sometimes we get a little
[1:22:13] bit too comfortable with this message
[1:22:16] but it's such a great message it's a
[1:22:18] message that needs to be shared
[1:22:20] and you know that sometimes means
[1:22:23] putting your family out there and we
[1:22:26] believe that the lord's gonna guide us
[1:22:27] and show us
[1:22:28] what to do but we wanna thank you
[1:22:31] everybody
[1:22:32] and uh the support and you know we're
[1:22:34] gonna stay in touch and uh
[1:22:36] you know we're not again sure what the
[1:22:39] lord has for us but we believe
[1:22:40] we just want to be a light in a
[1:22:44] little town this town that we're moving
[1:22:46] to is not a very
[1:22:48] big town but we believe that the lord
[1:22:50] can
[1:22:51] work in this little town and
[1:22:54] you know pretty soon we might call some
[1:22:56] brothers to help us out there if the
[1:22:58] lord
[1:23:00] finds a way to bring you know people to
[1:23:02] to him
[1:23:03] and and to the message so we want to
[1:23:05] thank you everybody for all the support
[1:23:07] please keep us in prayer we're going to
[1:23:09] need a lot of prayer
[1:23:11] we're going to need all the support we
[1:23:13] can't do it but ourselves
[1:23:16] that's one thing that i told brother
[1:23:17] david is we need your support
[1:23:20] we're going to be praying and fasting
[1:23:22] and and we just want the lord to guide
[1:23:24] us
[1:23:25] our hearts desires to be in his perfect
[1:23:27] will
[1:23:29] and that's what we are praying for and
[1:23:33] again thank you for everything may the
[1:23:34] lord be with you guys and uh
[1:23:37] we hope to maybe see you come and visit

[1:24:27] but it's it's it's cold there so i

[1:32:24] eternal life
[1:32:26] father in the visitation of your spirit
[1:32:30] in our generation
[1:32:33] to do the same sign that you did to the

[1:33:43] that
[1:33:46] people won't even know what kind of
[1:33:48] human being they are
[1:33:53] it's not even the choice that you made
[1:33:57] for us but we can just turn you aside
[1:34:00] and make our own choices
[1:34:03] father you said the hour would come
[1:34:05] where man would no longer
[1:34:07] retain you in their conscious or their
[1:34:10] mind
[1:34:11] and you would turn them over to a
[1:34:12] reprobate mind
[1:34:15] father we're living in that darkness now
[1:34:18] but i thank you father that there was
[1:34:20] light
[1:34:21] in the light shined in the evening time

[1:34:26] seals father and
[1:34:28] revealed to us the unadulterated word of
[1:34:31] god the truth
[1:34:32] of the godhead and many great mysteries
[1:34:35] we're thankful for that now father our
[1:34:40] one of our family members is going on a
[1:34:42] journey

[1:34:50] and lord when you're done and finished
[1:34:53] with that work

[1:34:58] send them someplace else
