[34:27] we just want to give you an update on
[34:30] our services
[34:32] we heard several weeks ago that if we
[34:35] had a few
[34:36] cases show up in the church and so what
[34:38] that we
[34:39] did is we we closed it down for a few
[34:42] weeks because
[34:44] we didn't know who those people had come
[34:46] in contact with
[34:47] but all that cycle has
[34:51] run its course and all those people have
[34:53] got well
[34:54] and they're not contagious anymore and
[34:58] so we had like 65 people show up sunday
[35:01] and we're grateful that we
[35:02] had that many and we have some more
[35:04] tonight so
[35:06] for those of you that are in good health

[35:14] a fellowship if if you feel that way if
[35:16] you don't then
[35:17] uh we hope that uh you know you have a
[35:21] reason but

[35:24] motivation you know

[35:28] that healeth of all our diseases
[35:30] and they've made this sickness
[35:34] so big you know the prophet of god said

[37:47] grateful to be in that
[37:49] called out group by the grace of god
[37:51] we'll just get right into the word here
[37:53] we're going to turn to a couple passages
[37:54] of scripture
[37:56] uh first jeremiah chapter uh
[38:00] well actually let's start first in
[38:01] romans chapter eight and then we're
[38:02] going to turn to
[38:03] jeremiah chapter 29.
[38:15] in romans chapter 8 we'll start at verse
[38:18] 18.
[38:26] in verse 18 in romans chapter 8 says for
[38:29] i reckon
[38:30] that the sufferings of this present time
[38:31] are not worthy to be compared with the
[38:33] glory which shall be revealed in us
[38:35] for the earnest expectation of the
[38:37] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[38:39] of the sons of god
[38:40] for the creature was not was made
[38:42] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[38:44] reason of him who hath subjected
[38:46] the same in hope because the creature
[38:48] itself also shall be delivered from the
[38:50] bondage of corruption
[38:51] into the glorious liberty of the
[38:53] children of god for we know that the
[38:55] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[38:57] and pain together
[38:58] until now and not only they but
[39:01] ourselves also which have first fruits
[39:03] have the first fruits of the spirit even
[39:05] we ourselves grown within ourselves
[39:07] waiting for the adoption to wit
[39:09] the redemption of our body amen let's
[39:12] turn to jeremiah
[39:15] chapter 29 and we'll read verses 11-13
[39:20] i believe we know these scriptures very
[39:22] well
[39:26] and let's let's start at verse 10 and
[39:28] read through 13.
[39:32] it says therefore fear thou not o my
[39:35] servant jacob saith the lord
[39:37] neither be dismayed o israel for lo i
[39:40] will save thee from afar
[39:42] and thy seed from the land of their
[39:43] captivity and jacob shall return
[39:47] and shall be in rest and be quiet and
[39:49] none shall make him afraid
[39:51] for i am with thee saith the lord oh you
[39:53] know i'm sorry i'm in verse chapter 30.
[39:55] forgive me
[39:57] i was wondering why that didn't sound
[39:58] quite right
[40:01] amen all right let's start at verse 10
[40:03] here though as well and we read through
[40:04] 13
[40:05] for for thus saith the lord that after
[40:08] 70 years be accomplished at babylon i
[40:10] will visit you and perform my good word
[40:12] towards you
[40:13] and causing you to return to this place
[40:16] for i know the thoughts that i think
[40:17] towards you saith the lord
[40:19] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[40:22] give you an expected end
[40:24] then shall you call upon me and you
[40:26] shall go and pray unto me and i will
[40:27] hearken unto you
[40:29] and you shall seek me and find me when
[40:30] you shall search for me with all your
[40:32] heart
[40:34] amen let's just have a word of prayer
[40:35] heavenly father as we just come once
[40:37] again
[40:38] lord not to hear from a man or any kind
[40:40] of man's expectation or reason they can
[40:42] come up with lord for that
[40:44] wouldn't profit us lord anything but
[40:47] lord we've come to hear directly from
[40:48] your throne that your holy spirit would
[40:50] speak to the hearts of every believer
[40:51] that would be here
[40:53] lord and if there would be anybody that
[40:55] would have need of anything lord god you
[40:57] could
[40:58] you could minister to that need even now
[40:59] by your word father we have that promise
[41:01] lord that
[41:02] that you would give us the things that
[41:04] we had need of the lord
[41:06] jesus we just come before you lord and
[41:09] are asking that your perfect will be
[41:10] done this evening may you anoint
[41:12] me lord speak only thy word lord jesus
[41:15] and anoint the hearers lord that they
[41:17] would be able to open up and receive the
[41:19] word of god
[41:20] lord for that's that's our very life
[41:22] lord it's our sustenance and
[41:24] the the very thing that we live by lord
[41:26] we just pray that
[41:27] you would have preeminence in the
[41:28] service this evening lord in the name of
[41:30] jesus christ we pray
[41:31] amen amen you may be seated
[41:37] this evening we just want to speak uh
[41:40] ted
[41:40] brother david asked me in the back uh
[41:42] the song you know maybe this thing on
[41:44] came up here and it's you know i don't
[41:47] usually
[41:48] not really good at always just thinking
[41:49] of the song right there on the spot
[41:51] always but
[41:52] this song had kind of been on my heart
[41:53] because it's the only the only song that
[41:55] i could think of that had the word in it
[41:57] but
[41:57] the word the word that the lord kind of
[41:59] gave me to minister on in my heart was
[42:01] culmination
[42:03] and uh so we just sing that song we are
[42:05] the chosen generation
[42:07] the culmination and the word culmination
[42:12] if you look up the definition
[42:14] it's it says it's the highest or
[42:16] climactic
[42:17] point of something and i really like
[42:19] this part when i look up the definition
[42:21] it says it's especially as attained
[42:23] after a long time
[42:26] and you know we're living in that season
[42:28] where we had our you know
[42:30] elections going on and everything and
[42:32] that's certainly a culmination of a lot
[42:34] of things that have been going on for a
[42:35] long time
[42:37] you know but it may not be the
[42:38] culmination we're looking for but
[42:40] the rest of the world always in such
[42:42] anticipation for it and even now they're
[42:43] just waiting with baited breath to find
[42:45] out
[42:46] what's going on and all these things
[42:48] that are happening and we understand
[42:50] that in our age that we're in is such a
[42:53] it's an
[42:54] impatience that we have you know it's
[42:56] always desiring to have something right
[42:58] now and
[42:59] but we you know even in the natural form
[43:01] we understand
[43:02] you know i i remember you know you
[43:04] always told as a child i remember being
[43:06] told as a child that the
[43:07] the great the some of the greatest
[43:08] things are those things that you got to
[43:10] wait for you know when
[43:11] when you have a promise of something to
[43:13] come and then you receive it
[43:14] it just means so much more to you when
[43:17] it comes and
[43:19] you know and we're looking right now
[43:21] that in the time that we're at we know
[43:23] we're in the very last days you know we
[43:26] we may not know exactly the exact time
[43:28] frame but we know that the coming of the
[43:30] lord is
[43:31] is even at the door that that we're in
[43:34] the process of the rapture
[43:35] even now we we and we've been speaking
[43:39] so much on you know we were talking i
[43:41] think the last time
[43:42] we spoke on uh the the different
[43:45] channels that we have open to us and one
[43:47] of those biggest channels we've been
[43:48] talking about is that reasoning and
[43:50] the nature of our age is is that
[43:52] scientific age where we want to know
[43:54] everything we want to know how
[43:55] everything works and
[43:56] we want to be able to break it down to
[43:58] the very molecule and
[44:00] understand why exactly this is happening
[44:02] and why exactly that is happening
[44:04] and and but god has not called us to
[44:07] that
[44:08] in everything you know god wants us to
[44:10] live by a
[44:11] faith in in and there's there in order
[44:14] to have a faith
[44:16] there there there's by necessity a lack
[44:19] of natural understanding you know so
[44:22] many times we want to understand
[44:24] oh why exactly does this have to be this
[44:26] way why
[44:27] you know people at the i just i guess i
[44:29] can only compare it to now because it's
[44:30] the
[44:31] right now the time we're at with the
[44:32] elections and everything everyone wants
[44:34] to know
[44:34] why is everybody in such an uproar why
[44:36] is everybody
[44:37] under such pressure about this and that
[44:39] and by
[44:40] faith we understand the reasonings
[44:43] behind it is because
[44:44] the age that we're in is literally hell
[44:47] pressing itself into manifestation on
[44:49] the earth
[44:50] morality of man is completely gone
[44:53] reasoning of man
[44:54] even in the natural is completely gone
[44:57] doing things
[44:58] that they don't even understand why they
[45:00] would do it you know we understand the
[45:02] scripture says
[45:03] they would not even like to retain god
[45:04] in their knowledge
[45:06] and because of that god gave them up to
[45:09] reprobate minds
[45:10] i believe that scripture even says in a
[45:12] place that they would even do things
[45:14] that were inconvenient
[45:15] things that and by that it's things that
[45:17] don't even make sense
[45:20] but what is it it's all bringing us to a
[45:22] place
[45:23] see too many times as christians the
[45:25] devil is right there to be in our ears
[45:28] always trying to tell us that things are
[45:30] out of control
[45:31] that things just kind of feel like
[45:33] they're speeding speeding towards
[45:35] something and it
[45:36] and we there's no control to it and in a
[45:38] sense he is correct
[45:39] because in and of ourselves we don't
[45:41] have control
[45:43] as christians as a believer in knowing
[45:46] the word that we have in this hour
[45:47] i don't want to be in control when when
[45:50] you receive the holy ghost
[45:52] you you made you gave something unto the
[45:55] lord
[45:55] where i gave up control of my own life
[45:59] i gave up my own decision-making process
[46:02] i gave up my own natural thoughts of
[46:05] what i want to happen
[46:07] or what i think things should be and i
[46:09] gave it over to the lord jesus
[46:12] and too many times we want to be in
[46:14] control of the situation
[46:16] we want to know oh what's happening so
[46:18] we feel like oh lord
[46:20] are things just speeding out of control
[46:21] but nothing's out of control with god
[46:25] no matter what we look at in the
[46:27] political realm no matter what we look
[46:29] at
[46:29] in the natural realm no matter what we
[46:31] look at in the spiritual realm
[46:33] in the church realm god is in complete
[46:36] control
[46:37] of every situation
[46:42] if brother branham could say that that
[46:44] he could count
[46:45] how many times that little fleet batted
[46:47] his eyes
[46:50] if if the lord could say to pharaoh for
[46:53] this purpose i raised you up
[46:58] why did we fear about another natural
[47:01] pharaoh we could call it president
[47:04] or whatever word you want to give it
[47:06] because god the scripture says
[47:08] he setteth up kings and he taketh them
[47:11] down
[47:12] so we we we got to get it out of our own
[47:15] mind
[47:15] that that we need to be able to just
[47:18] understand
[47:19] because there's only one thing i need to
[47:21] understand and that is my god is in
[47:23] control
[47:24] uh there's only one thing i need to
[47:26] understand is that before the foundation
[47:28] of the world
[47:29] god knew exactly what color clothes
[47:32] you're going to be wearing right now
[47:33] he knew i was going to choose this tie
[47:36] to wear this evening
[47:38] and you have to understand that there is
[47:40] nothing that happens
[47:42] without significance paul said there's
[47:44] not a sound made
[47:46] without significance just because you
[47:50] don't understand it
[47:52] doesn't mean god doesn't have it in
[47:54] control
[47:56] and too many times in our mental ability
[47:59] remember this is an intellectual super
[48:02] age
[48:03] beyond anything we could have even
[48:05] comprehended brother branham even if you
[48:08] weren't even the natural
[48:09] i mean he probably saw a cell phone in
[48:11] one of those visions or something
[48:13] i don't know but you imagine that a
[48:16] hundred years ago
[48:17] they couldn't even comprehend
[48:20] what's happening right now they say they
[48:23] say according to the natural
[48:25] our intellectual knowledge doubles
[48:28] every day it's just a geometric
[48:32] exponential growth of intellectual
[48:34] knowledge
[48:35] and look what's followed it an
[48:37] exponential growth of sin
[48:39] right behind it because it can't help
[48:43] that that when satan moves into the
[48:46] place
[48:47] and brings his intellectual power that
[48:49] they start to reason god out of
[48:51] everything
[48:53] they start to reason god out of the
[48:55] schools they reason them out of the
[48:57] government
[48:58] everybody worries about the government
[48:59] the government think we know why
[49:01] it is the way it is it's because they
[49:03] kicked god out a long time ago
[49:08] and we know it's true because we had a
[49:10] prophet come and indict that generation
[49:14] so how else could we expect it to
[49:16] prosper
[49:17] oh sure i believe the lord can have
[49:20] grace and give us
[49:21] a space of time i believe that
[49:24] as he did if he could do it for ahab
[49:27] surely he could do it for his bride if
[49:28] she needed it
[49:31] but we got to understand that that we
[49:34] know who holds tomorrow
[49:38] we and there is something god is letting
[49:41] god allows these things to happen
[49:44] everything that we think oh the lord's
[49:45] not in control
[49:48] if the lord who created the heaven and
[49:50] the heavens and the earth
[49:52] you don't think that if he wanted to
[49:55] just like the lord
[49:56] did not the lord say no you know i could
[49:58] call legions of angels
[50:00] and my father would send it god could do
[50:03] whatever he wants to do
[50:05] if he allows these things to be the way
[50:08] they are
[50:08] they are for a purpose and as we've been
[50:11] hearing
[50:12] you know i've so enjoyed the message i
[50:14] believe brother david
[50:16] our pastor preached probably about a
[50:17] month ago now but it just stuck with me
[50:19] and i've been incorporating part of it
[50:21] into my sermon so much
[50:23] is that we were brought into this time
[50:27] for such a specific purpose in so much
[50:30] that god
[50:31] put the attributes of himself in you
[50:35] so they could meet the need of the hour
[50:38] they were specifically placed in you
[50:41] because a deep is calling to a deep
[50:46] and now the deep lieth in you
[50:49] when the holy ghost comes in it makes us
[50:51] a bow
[50:52] now that deep that someone on the street
[50:55] is calling for
[50:56] you can meet that need you were called
[51:00] to fulfill that as much as
[51:03] moses by god himself was called and said
[51:06] i've come to deliver them
[51:08] but now i sent you why he had placed in
[51:12] moses an attribute
[51:13] of deliverer and now he says moses
[51:16] i come down i put it in you and now it's
[51:19] time to manifest that attribute
[51:24] so it is with the people of god the
[51:26] bride of jesus christ right now
[51:29] you we me brother david brother billy
[51:33] all
[51:34] that are called bride are the
[51:36] culmination
[51:38] that the climactic point
[51:41] of everything that god has been working
[51:43] for since the garden of eden
[51:46] and the devil would love to steal that
[51:48] from you by making you think that
[51:50] god's not in control of the situation
[51:55] god everything that god is doing
[51:58] is for your benefit every situation
[52:03] even when you mess it up
[52:07] even when you do your best to bury it
[52:11] even when you do your best to throw the
[52:13] wrench into the gears and break it all
[52:15] up
[52:16] it is working for your benefit
[52:20] because my scripture tells me that the
[52:22] footsteps of the righteous
[52:24] are ordered by the lord and then just to
[52:27] support that point
[52:29] we had a prophet that came and said even
[52:31] if you choose his permissive will
[52:33] he will work it for his perfect will
[52:36] so how can you lose you can't
[52:40] lose god had called you to be pride he's
[52:43] called you
[52:44] to manifest the culmination of all these
[52:47] things
[52:50] and as much as we fight against it it's
[52:53] going to happen anyhow
[52:56] it's going to happen anyway there ain't
[52:57] no abdicating this throne
[52:59] there's no just giving it up you can't
[53:01] do it it was called
[53:02] because you know what as much as
[53:04] sometimes we beat our heads into the
[53:06] wall
[53:07] the lord chose you because he knew he
[53:10] couldn't
[53:10] his first choice was the choice he stuck
[53:13] with
[53:14] he chose you brother branham said he
[53:17] can't
[53:17] switch from his first choice because if
[53:19] he did it means he made a mistake
[53:22] and god doesn't make mistakes so you are
[53:24] not a mistake brother and sister
[53:26] you are not called to this truth you are
[53:29] not
[53:30] called in this hour for a mistake
[53:35] jesus at the wedding in canaan remember
[53:38] what he said
[53:39] he's remember what he told him when he
[53:40] drank the wine that jesus turned water
[53:42] into wine he says
[53:43] he says you saved the best for last
[53:46] everybody else puts the good stuff out
[53:48] first
[53:48] you know that's how it is you go in for
[53:50] a job interview usually you throw out
[53:52] all the good stuff first
[53:53] and then you try to hide you know maybe
[53:55] you had a poor job performance you try
[53:56] to hide that later
[53:58] you try to blind them with all the the
[54:00] good stuff up front get them
[54:01] get them all happy about it and then you
[54:03] oh yeah you know i had this reprimand
[54:05] here whatever it might be
[54:06] not so with god god saved the best for
[54:09] last
[54:11] he said you for last you are
[54:14] the best that god's got to offer
[54:17] and this now that we don't that's not to
[54:19] build us up and to be prideful
[54:21] but the point is is to recognize who you
[54:24] are
[54:26] because see how the devil we've been
[54:28] talking about it last time how the devil
[54:30] he plays both sides of the argument
[54:32] right he's always there to play both
[54:36] sides
[54:37] so the whole time he's fighting you
[54:38] saying you there's no way you could be
[54:40] bride
[54:41] there's no way you could be bribed
[54:42] there's no way you could be bright
[54:44] and then and then you reckon god made me
[54:47] this i'm making a rapture
[54:49] and now he says well you know you're not
[54:52] that's not that can't really be true
[54:53] because
[54:54] you know look at you look at what you
[54:56] did look at this and look at that if you
[54:57] were bride then this
[54:59] see now he starts to agree with you well
[55:01] yeah you say your bride
[55:02] but what about this see he's never gonna
[55:04] let you go
[55:06] so the point is is we have to completely
[55:08] you have to ignore it
[55:10] it's hard to ignore when that man right
[55:13] in front of you in the mirror every day
[55:15] looking at you you wake up with your own
[55:17] failures you see all those things
[55:18] but it's time we blinded ourselves
[55:21] to our own failures and looked only to
[55:24] jesus christ
[55:26] see it's not about he's made us more
[55:28] than conquerors
[55:30] more than conquerors and it has nothing
[55:32] to do with your ability
[55:34] absolutely nothing to do with your
[55:36] ability the point
[55:38] is is that god has given you grace
[55:42] to where you can accept his ability to
[55:45] do it
[55:46] that's the difference that is the
[55:48] difference is to be able to
[55:50] accept what god has done for you
[55:54] you can accept his word or reject it
[55:56] that's what cain couldn't do
[55:58] he could not accept what god was saying
[56:01] it's time we accepted that god has
[56:04] called us
[56:05] to this hour for this moment
[56:08] and he didn't just put you here to be a
[56:11] fifth wheel
[56:12] you are part of it brother and sister
[56:14] you are a you are an important
[56:16] piece you can we can't make it without
[56:19] you
[56:20] if you're struggling out there thinking
[56:22] well nobody cares about me
[56:23] nobody cares you're just this
[56:25] insignificant part of the body
[56:27] i tell you what we all have bodies
[56:30] i i don't care if it's the skin on the
[56:33] bottom of my foot
[56:34] if i scraped it and part of it came
[56:36] scraping off and i'm bleeding
[56:38] i'm gonna feel it i'm not gonna enjoy it
[56:41] i want it back i want it healed
[56:44] so even if you feel like you're the most
[56:46] insignificant little part
[56:48] remember the scripture says if one part
[56:50] of the body hurts
[56:51] we all feel it
[56:55] so it's been too many times we're so
[56:58] busy trying to
[56:59] put our own spin on what it means to be
[57:02] the bride of jesus christ
[57:03] but the bride of jesus christ is just
[57:06] called to manifest the word
[57:08] that's all it is we've tried to make it
[57:12] well our minds can reason out of the
[57:14] message
[57:15] but all it is is living the life of god
[57:19] every day
[57:23] living the life of god every single day
[57:26] and just when you fail you get back up
[57:29] and you keep going
[57:31] and you acknowledge lord thy word is
[57:34] truth
[57:35] i desire to walk in every bit of it lord
[57:38] give me grace
[57:39] that when i fall down to get back up
[57:42] lord help me to love
[57:43] my brothers and sisters help me to love
[57:45] my neighbor you see we've
[57:46] over complicated things right
[57:51] we think remember we talked about this
[57:53] before but works
[57:54] is not just the miracles it's not it's
[57:57] not just the supernatural
[57:59] it's the supernatural life expressing
[58:02] itself through the believer
[58:05] not always in a supernatural way of a
[58:08] miracle
[58:09] but insomuch as james says true religion
[58:11] undefiled
[58:13] visiting the widows and orphans doing
[58:16] the things that are necessary
[58:18] but we so many what did jesus tell the
[58:20] pharisees he said you left the one done
[58:22] when you should have done it and you let
[58:25] that go and did the other
[58:27] so many times we're so busy building up
[58:29] in our minds
[58:30] oh well in order to be part of the bride
[58:32] i got to be laying hands and
[58:34] miracles got to be happening but how
[58:36] many people are out there
[58:37] out of a true love unfeigned love out of
[58:40] the heart
[58:41] are out there visiting the sick and the
[58:42] widows
[58:45] did not brother branham talk about what
[58:47] about the sighing and crying
[58:49] for the abominations when he said that
[58:51] was the sign
[58:53] that was the sign of the seal lord help
[58:56] me
[58:57] i need i need more of that but we've
[59:00] over complicated it
[59:01] and the devil is right there to say see
[59:03] because you're not living up to this
[59:05] and what that is is just a fabricated
[59:09] reasoned image of what you think the
[59:11] bride is
[59:14] well if that was it then john sure
[59:16] missed it
[59:17] john the baptist because he didn't do no
[59:19] miracles
[59:20] had a ministry that lasted six months
[59:23] and didn't seem to hardly have any
[59:24] converts because of it
[59:26] and jesus called him the greatest man
[59:27] born of a woman
[59:29] see what god calls great man calls
[59:32] foolish
[59:35] and what we call what what god what man
[59:38] calls foolish god calls great
[59:41] oh the the hills will melt like wax
[59:44] and the the mountains will skip like
[59:46] little rams not knowing
[59:49] that it was it's not lawful for you to
[59:51] have her talking to herod
[59:53] bringing the word back to the truth and
[59:56] it wasn't some great natural thing
[59:59] even a great what it looked to be
[1:00:00] supernatural from the outside
[1:00:02] but it was supernatural nonetheless
[1:00:04] because it was the very god of heaven
[1:00:06] fulfilling his word
[1:00:10] the word fulfilled is supernatural
[1:00:14] when when you overcome the tiredness
[1:00:18] when you overcome the feelings in the
[1:00:21] flesh
[1:00:23] and you get down on your knees and pray
[1:00:25] for someone that offended you
[1:00:28] with a sincere heart not because you
[1:00:30] know you ought to do it
[1:00:32] but when something moves on you and say
[1:00:34] i love that brother or sister i love
[1:00:36] this person
[1:00:37] i'm gonna pray for him i'm not gonna
[1:00:39] stew i'm not gonna sit there and hold on
[1:00:41] to a grudge or whatever it might be an
[1:00:42] art that's supernatural
[1:00:47] when you can overcome this flesh that's
[1:00:50] supernatural brothers and sisters
[1:00:52] because that is literally the spirit
[1:00:54] supernatural
[1:00:55] overcoming the flesh the natural
[1:00:59] even supernatural itself will go
[1:01:01] intellectual
[1:01:02] is a compound word super above natural
[1:01:05] it's above
[1:01:06] the natural so when you put the spirit
[1:01:09] the super
[1:01:10] above the carnal the natural that is
[1:01:13] supernatural
[1:01:18] the miracles are going to come why
[1:01:21] because he promised it
[1:01:24] no matter remember brother branham had
[1:01:26] to say it all the time because he was
[1:01:28] preaching to pentecostals
[1:01:29] that went over the edge into into
[1:01:31] sensualism
[1:01:33] and all about feelings
[1:01:36] they went so far over the edge they had
[1:01:38] to reign them back
[1:01:41] by the grace of god they're the only
[1:01:42] ones that accepted him for a while but
[1:01:44] then he had to reign them back
[1:01:46] and say look you got you got so far into
[1:01:49] to what you call manifestations into
[1:01:52] what you call feelings
[1:01:53] into what you call supernatural that now
[1:01:56] you'll accept someone with blood coming
[1:01:58] out of their hands instead of the word
[1:02:02] why because they miss that the word
[1:02:04] being fulfilled
[1:02:05] is supernatural
[1:02:10] so we're called to be the culmination of
[1:02:13] all these things
[1:02:14] see god works in ways so far
[1:02:18] beyond your reasoning
[1:02:21] you're gonna look and sing to the world
[1:02:23] you might as well just get used to it
[1:02:24] you already do
[1:02:25] you showed up here when kovin's raging
[1:02:29] you already look crazy since just the
[1:02:32] truth
[1:02:33] if if they saw us right now held the
[1:02:35] part whenever they'd come in and say you
[1:02:36] guys are nuts
[1:02:37] maybe we should start arrested people or
[1:02:39] something i don't know you don't think
[1:02:40] it'll come to that i don't know it may
[1:02:42] probably will at some point may not be
[1:02:44] coveted but it might be covet 35 i don't
[1:02:46] know
[1:02:48] but it's coming because it always comes
[1:02:52] down to that that government's always
[1:02:53] trying to
[1:02:54] push itself down and make itself
[1:02:58] but we got to get out of our own
[1:03:00] thoughts because i just read this i have
[1:03:02] a few quotes here
[1:03:04] one from the power of god in 1955. i
[1:03:06] love this
[1:03:07] he says don't try to outwit god
[1:03:11] god works in mysterious ways his wonders
[1:03:13] to perform
[1:03:15] pharaoh the hard-hearted demon-possessed
[1:03:18] man
[1:03:18] was killing every jewish baby because
[1:03:20] the devil had anointed him
[1:03:22] brought the king of them in raised him
[1:03:25] educated and fed him
[1:03:27] and besides that brought his mother over
[1:03:29] for a nurse for him
[1:03:31] amen that's what faith will do
[1:03:34] the mother saw that by faith she saw
[1:03:36] that that's the reason she went down
[1:03:38] there and stood and waited for her
[1:03:39] daughter to come
[1:03:40] call her to be the nurse see she already
[1:03:42] had it in her mind because god had
[1:03:43] revealed it
[1:03:44] if god reveals to you tonight that your
[1:03:46] sickness has gone through the atonement
[1:03:48] just as that revealed to that mother
[1:03:50] it's finished
[1:03:51] amen the power of faith she placed her
[1:03:54] baby right in the jaws of death
[1:03:56] think about that think about all the
[1:03:58] alligators that had to be in the river
[1:04:02] so the natural mind would say you're
[1:04:05] going to take it from one death and put
[1:04:06] it in the hands of another
[1:04:09] but that's what faith will do it doesn't
[1:04:11] look at reasoning it doesn't try to
[1:04:13] figure it out
[1:04:16] placed him right smack in the jaws of
[1:04:18] death i like this he says
[1:04:20] sometimes trials are brought upon us
[1:04:22] thank you brother praise the lord
[1:04:26] he says sometimes trials are brought
[1:04:28] upon us people say oh
[1:04:29] i wished i didn't god if i'm a christian
[1:04:32] why'd this happen brother branham
[1:04:34] god let that come upon you so he could
[1:04:37] show you
[1:04:38] show his love to you so he could prove
[1:04:40] to you i am the resurrection and the
[1:04:41] life
[1:04:43] death says i got a right the king's
[1:04:45] commission is to drown all the babies
[1:04:47] put them in the ocean
[1:04:48] she said i'm putting them in the ocean
[1:04:50] or in the waters
[1:04:52] under this by revelation i have prepared
[1:04:54] a way of escape
[1:04:55] amen and she laid him in death and faith
[1:04:59] brought him out and made him the son of
[1:05:02] pharaoh's daughter
[1:05:03] and made her the nurse see how god did
[1:05:05] god
[1:05:06] altogether was working to his own glory
[1:05:09] and just putting it right under satan's
[1:05:11] nose and saying
[1:05:12] i just want to show you how blind you
[1:05:14] are satan put the baby right under his
[1:05:16] face
[1:05:17] and made satan feed him and take care of
[1:05:19] him and nourish him up
[1:05:21] for the very man he was going to destroy
[1:05:23] the whole nation
[1:05:24] and lead the people to victory
[1:05:25] hallelujah oh our god is marvelous
[1:05:28] have faith stronger than death certainly
[1:05:31] faith is stronger
[1:05:32] than death i want you to think about it
[1:05:35] next time you're thinking about that
[1:05:37] loved one you got in the world
[1:05:38] oh don't worry pharaoh's just raising
[1:05:40] them up to destroy them
[1:05:43] you think you think it's out of god's
[1:05:45] control no god knows exactly what he's
[1:05:47] doing
[1:05:48] god knows exactly what he's doing i've
[1:05:50] seen bro
[1:05:51] brother sisters there's a brother i know
[1:05:54] that
[1:05:54] he's been in the world for like 10 years
[1:05:56] now knows this message
[1:05:58] you talk to him even after he's just out
[1:06:00] there doing whatever he wants
[1:06:02] and he knew he knows the message is
[1:06:04] right he'd still witness to people
[1:06:07] he's still bringing he would still be
[1:06:09] bringing people to church
[1:06:11] pointing them to the church when he
[1:06:13] himself wouldn't go
[1:06:14] you don't think god knows what he's
[1:06:16] doing yeah it may look
[1:06:18] a little rough from the outside but i'm
[1:06:20] going to tell you what
[1:06:21] god is in control you don't have to
[1:06:25] know how it's going to work but god is
[1:06:27] going to do it
[1:06:29] he's going to do it he promised he would
[1:06:32] so that's all for the bride that ought
[1:06:34] to be enough
[1:06:36] come what may it doesn't matter because
[1:06:38] why because
[1:06:39] this is that culmination time this is
[1:06:42] that climax we're working towards
[1:06:44] it's just see god he's a great he's a
[1:06:47] great drama artist
[1:06:49] see all these they put the movies out
[1:06:51] there with the superheroes
[1:06:52] and the things that they do you know
[1:06:53] they always talk about the three acts of
[1:06:55] a
[1:06:55] of a thing you have the the i can't
[1:06:58] remember what they are now but there's
[1:06:59] something it's like conflict in their
[1:07:00] resolution or however they do it and
[1:07:02] there's always that point where
[1:07:04] the hero's standing up against
[1:07:05] unspeakable odds
[1:07:07] and then they overcome who do you think
[1:07:09] was doing at first brothers and sisters
[1:07:12] see the lord loves to make to make it
[1:07:15] look
[1:07:16] like all is lost why because he's
[1:07:18] showing his glory
[1:07:20] he's showing his humility that just so
[1:07:22] he so he can raise himself up and show
[1:07:25] this is who i am i am the great
[1:07:27] conqueror
[1:07:28] i am the mighty conqueror i am the
[1:07:31] healer i am the deliverer
[1:07:34] see it's all about jesus christ he is
[1:07:37] lifting himself
[1:07:38] up and he wants to use you to do it
[1:07:42] so don't worry about if it looks like
[1:07:43] your back's against the wall
[1:07:47] don't worry if it looks like all the
[1:07:49] odds are stacked against you that's
[1:07:51] right where god wants it to be
[1:07:54] why do you think gross darkness upon the
[1:07:56] people
[1:07:57] the world's getting darker and darker
[1:08:00] many many many more are the children of
[1:08:04] the bonds woman
[1:08:05] than the children of the free many many
[1:08:08] more
[1:08:08] and it's getting smaller all the time
[1:08:12] why god knows how to set it up just
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:16] he set it up did he not set it up with
[1:08:18] the lord jesus
[1:08:20] it's him against see the whole world to
[1:08:24] the point where no man stood with him at
[1:08:25] the end
[1:08:26] only one john from afar watching
[1:08:30] and he died alone it looked like
[1:08:34] oh but then he raised up on the third
[1:08:36] day and you know what you want to know i
[1:08:38] was just thinking about this
[1:08:39] i never thought of this you know nobody
[1:08:41] saw
[1:08:42] the actual supernatural event of the
[1:08:45] resurrection
[1:08:47] that's how humble god is didn't need to
[1:08:50] show a big show
[1:08:51] just roll the stone away let the angel
[1:08:53] sit there with the clothes the one you
[1:08:54] seek for is no longer here
[1:08:56] he's no longer dead but he is alive
[1:08:58] glory to god
[1:08:59] see the lord knows how to do it just
[1:09:01] right see even in his greatest moments
[1:09:04] god shows his humility oh my
[1:09:06] you think about think about moses we
[1:09:09] just brother branham was dramatizing it
[1:09:10] just a little bit there
[1:09:11] but look at how insane it looked
[1:09:16] all these things look at look at how
[1:09:17] many times it looked
[1:09:19] like moses might have had it figured out
[1:09:21] no doubt he'd sit there in pharaoh's
[1:09:23] military schools
[1:09:25] no one god raised me up to be a
[1:09:26] deliverer i've been taught i know i'm a
[1:09:28] proper child
[1:09:29] i know who i am see he even knew who he
[1:09:32] was
[1:09:34] and had confidence in it at least enough
[1:09:36] enough
[1:09:37] natural confidence that he tried to
[1:09:38] fulfill it himself
[1:09:40] and then he falls flat and goes to
[1:09:43] running from his own commission
[1:09:45] and it looks like it's all lost now what
[1:09:48] will our hero do now
[1:09:51] you know that what will he do
[1:09:54] it looks crazy
[1:09:57] but god is in control see
[1:10:00] like brother bram said he had to beat
[1:10:02] out all of those years
[1:10:04] of carnal teaching that's what he's got
[1:10:07] to do to his children a lot of times
[1:10:09] is get all of yourself out of the way so
[1:10:12] you can realize
[1:10:13] it has nothing to do with you it's all
[1:10:16] about him
[1:10:17] it's all about him the lord jesus
[1:10:19] manifesting himself in you
[1:10:24] that's what he wants that's what he's
[1:10:25] doing right now all these things going
[1:10:27] on this coveted 19
[1:10:29] this election process riots happening
[1:10:31] all over the place it
[1:10:32] is perfectly designed
[1:10:35] for the people of god for the bride of
[1:10:38] jesus christ
[1:10:39] to be manifested all of these things
[1:10:42] are designed and bringing us to a place
[1:10:46] where the the climax the culmination of
[1:10:49] all of these things can be fulfilled
[1:10:51] for all these years we read that
[1:10:54] scripture in romans
[1:10:55] the the whole creation is groaning
[1:10:58] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:11:02] who in here is the son or daughter of
[1:11:04] god creation
[1:11:06] is groaning for you
[1:11:09] creation is groaning for me
[1:11:13] the world doesn't even know that the
[1:11:15] reason
[1:11:16] they're rioting that the reason they're
[1:11:19] in an uproar
[1:11:20] that the reason they have no peace is
[1:11:23] because they're waiting
[1:11:24] for you and for me to manifest god
[1:11:28] to this world they don't even know it
[1:11:33] but they're anointed
[1:11:37] well you think about it you even think
[1:11:40] about daniel and the lions dead
[1:11:42] darius loved daniel
[1:11:46] but something anointed him to put out
[1:11:49] this ridiculous decree
[1:11:51] because he was hearing voices from from
[1:11:54] his advisors
[1:11:55] to put this decree forth to worship
[1:11:59] why it looked it didn't look sensible
[1:12:03] but he did it anyhow and daniel says i'm
[1:12:06] not giving into that
[1:12:09] i'm not giving into that garbage i know
[1:12:12] who i believed
[1:12:14] i know the word that i believed i'm not
[1:12:17] going to bow down to some system
[1:12:19] i'm not going to bow down to some man or
[1:12:21] some creed
[1:12:24] brothers sisters that's the place we're
[1:12:25] at because i don't know i don't know
[1:12:27] what form it's going to take
[1:12:29] but you're going to get pressed even
[1:12:30] more than you are now these are just
[1:12:32] light afflictions
[1:12:34] these are just light afflictions and
[1:12:36] that's not to scare people
[1:12:38] that's not the point but to realize that
[1:12:41] we need to have peace
[1:12:43] we need to have comfort and confidence
[1:12:45] in god
[1:12:46] knowing that no matter that government
[1:12:48] can come and tell you to shut down right
[1:12:50] now it doesn't matter
[1:12:51] oh what was this why is this happening i
[1:12:53] know exactly why it's happening
[1:12:54] it's to bring out the seed of god that's
[1:12:57] in you
[1:12:58] it's to bring out that manifestation
[1:13:00] those hard times got to come
[1:13:03] they gotta come you know what the with i
[1:13:05] was
[1:13:06] i thought about this when i first moved
[1:13:08] to texas and we bought a house
[1:13:10] i never had a house before so i'm
[1:13:12] learning about how to take care of my
[1:13:14] lawn
[1:13:14] and all those things but see i grew up
[1:13:16] in the north and in the north in the
[1:13:18] winter time
[1:13:19] everything dies but not so in texas
[1:13:24] you got to be on that lawn 365
[1:13:28] because i blinked and my whole lawn was
[1:13:31] just a weed jungle
[1:13:33] i was like oh my goodness weeds never
[1:13:35] sleep in texas
[1:13:37] and then i realized later it's because
[1:13:38] you guys that we don't have hard freezes
[1:13:39] here that kill everything
[1:13:42] so what'd it do i had to go and i had to
[1:13:43] pluck them all up i had to put the
[1:13:45] chemicals on there trying to kill them
[1:13:46] all and it took forever
[1:13:47] and my first year and a half that my
[1:13:49] lawn was there it just looked it looked
[1:13:50] diseased
[1:13:52] it was i felt bad for my neighbors
[1:13:54] because it looked so bad
[1:13:56] i had the hoa putting notes on me
[1:13:58] telling you gotta fix your lawn
[1:14:00] and i'm like you're telling me you think
[1:14:02] i wanted to look like this
[1:14:05] but the lord showed me a lot of things
[1:14:07] through that because
[1:14:09] we're like a garden of for god
[1:14:12] and you've got to tend to it
[1:14:15] we got to tend to it you got to pluck
[1:14:18] out the weeds when they spring up
[1:14:20] you got to keep it you got to keep it
[1:14:22] nourished you got to keep it watered
[1:14:25] but the one thing i found out is there's
[1:14:28] a few things that i thought were really
[1:14:29] interesting
[1:14:30] number one weeds do not like the sun
[1:14:33] they thrive in in ideal conditions
[1:14:37] when the temperature is really nice and
[1:14:39] mild and they get a little bit of sun
[1:14:41] but not too much
[1:14:42] it's not too hot they get a little bit
[1:14:43] of rain that's like that kind of like
[1:14:45] that hotbed plant
[1:14:46] that needs to be pampered all the time
[1:14:48] that weed it's it's really easy for
[1:14:50] weeds to spring up when things are easy
[1:14:52] because we get lacks we get we get a
[1:14:55] little bit lazy
[1:14:56] we're not as we're not as vigilant
[1:14:59] you know when you when you're at war
[1:15:02] someone's on guard and it's wartime and
[1:15:05] they're out there in a post
[1:15:06] to watch over the base and they know
[1:15:09] it's wartime
[1:15:10] oh their eyes are peeled they're like a
[1:15:12] hawk they're like an eagle just
[1:15:13] scanning the horizon they're ready to go
[1:15:15] they're a real watchman
[1:15:16] but you get them in a time of peace oh
[1:15:19] we haven't had a tax for here in a long
[1:15:21] long time
[1:15:22] you'll catch them sleeping on the job
[1:15:24] and that's what we got to be careful of
[1:15:26] we've had it so easy in the natural
[1:15:30] most of us we have places to live we got
[1:15:33] plenty of food to eat
[1:15:35] some of us too much i know i can say
[1:15:38] that because i've been there
[1:15:40] you know we have vehicles to drive we we
[1:15:43] have
[1:15:44] jobs god has blessed us so abundantly
[1:15:47] but it's just like the scripture says
[1:15:48] when gesture and wax fat he kicked
[1:15:51] and we have to be very careful to guard
[1:15:53] against that
[1:15:54] so what happens if you fight when weeds
[1:15:56] start to grow so you know what you got
[1:15:58] you got
[1:15:58] you got pesticides to take care of the
[1:16:00] weeds but that's not always pleasant
[1:16:03] why because sometimes it puts stress on
[1:16:04] the real good grass and you know that's
[1:16:06] how it is sometimes when the pastor's
[1:16:08] got to get up here
[1:16:09] with a real pesticide and start smacking
[1:16:11] around those devils
[1:16:12] that he can that watchmen can see and
[1:16:15] sometimes the other people
[1:16:16] all the other brothers and sisters are
[1:16:18] kind of it kind of hurts a little bit
[1:16:20] but it's for the good you got to get
[1:16:22] those weeds out of there
[1:16:24] and then that you know what they don't
[1:16:25] like too is they don't like that hot
[1:16:26] texas sun
[1:16:28] you know as soon as that hot texas scum
[1:16:30] sun comes in it starts to burn all those
[1:16:32] weeds out
[1:16:33] they are starting to wither and die thus
[1:16:35] those trials
[1:16:36] that's those tribulations that we just
[1:16:39] got a little bit of that going on right
[1:16:40] now
[1:16:41] don't let it wilt you don't don't you're
[1:16:44] not
[1:16:44] weeds you are you are pure
[1:16:48] you're those lilies you're you're like
[1:16:50] reverend lily you thrive in that sun
[1:16:53] you you soak it up why because it's
[1:16:55] bringing you to a ripening
[1:16:57] it's bringing you to a fulfillment it's
[1:16:59] bringing you to that place
[1:17:01] but it gets dry and those weeds see god
[1:17:03] puts us through those trials
[1:17:05] and those hard times to burn out those
[1:17:07] weeds
[1:17:08] to start clearing to start figuring out
[1:17:10] lord what's going on
[1:17:12] but i tell you what i found out in all
[1:17:14] my research they said the best way to
[1:17:16] take care of weeds in your lawn
[1:17:17] is to have a healthy lawn to have a
[1:17:20] healthy lawn
[1:17:22] if you have a healthy lawn that grass
[1:17:24] will just
[1:17:25] it'll grow so thick weeds can't even get
[1:17:28] there
[1:17:28] that's what i want to be i want to be so
[1:17:31] healthy
[1:17:32] so so thick with the spirit of god when
[1:17:35] that little
[1:17:36] those little roots of bitterness try to
[1:17:37] spring up that holy ghost just quashes
[1:17:39] it right there
[1:17:41] it just chunks out everything the devil
[1:17:42] throws at you
[1:17:44] so how do you do it first you got to get
[1:17:46] in the sun
[1:17:47] you got to soak up the sun soak up his
[1:17:49] presence get in the presence of the sun
[1:17:51] get in prayer then what is it then you
[1:17:54] got to get some water
[1:17:56] you got to get a little washing of the
[1:17:57] water by the word
[1:18:00] you got to you got to soak up that water
[1:18:02] soak up this word
[1:18:03] soak up the teachings that are coming
[1:18:06] from from the prophet that are coming
[1:18:08] from your pastor
[1:18:10] soak them all up and then what do you
[1:18:12] got to do every once in a while you got
[1:18:13] to throw a little fertilizer on there
[1:18:15] sometimes those trials are going to come
[1:18:18] yeah it doesn't necessarily
[1:18:19] mean you did anything wrong like brother
[1:18:20] branson sometimes god just wants to
[1:18:22] show something to you sometimes he just
[1:18:24] wants to express something to you
[1:18:26] he wants to reveal a little bit more of
[1:18:28] himself in you
[1:18:30] that you didn't even know was there but
[1:18:31] he knew it and just like we talked about
[1:18:34] he has to he has to tease out he has to
[1:18:37] he has to draw out that attribute from
[1:18:40] you
[1:18:41] that you might not even know what's just
[1:18:43] way deep down inside
[1:18:45] but sometimes it takes those deep trials
[1:18:47] you know and that was the other thing i
[1:18:48] found out too
[1:18:49] is that another way that they clean out
[1:18:51] those lawns is they scalp them
[1:18:53] they mow them down to about a nub like a
[1:18:56] quarter inch
[1:18:57] and what does that do it strips all
[1:18:59] those weeds down to nothing
[1:19:01] and the weeds can't live like that and
[1:19:03] the sun comes and scorches them
[1:19:04] but the grass can persevere how many
[1:19:07] ever been scalped by god before
[1:19:08] i've ever been mowed down really low
[1:19:11] where god needed to get some things out
[1:19:12] of you
[1:19:13] i've been there god will mow you down
[1:19:15] sometimes
[1:19:16] you say lord why am i here he says it's
[1:19:19] about time you came to me
[1:19:20] i'll tell you all about it
[1:19:24] but it's all for a purpose god isn't
[1:19:26] just doing things willy-nilly
[1:19:28] the world wants to paint a picture of
[1:19:30] god to be
[1:19:31] just some doty grandfather
[1:19:35] perverted thing that is just playing
[1:19:37] with humans like they're just little
[1:19:38] play things
[1:19:40] that's the world's new version of god
[1:19:43] that's this cruel
[1:19:44] well why would god allow these things
[1:19:46] why does he do this and we've understood
[1:19:48] through the preaching and do different
[1:19:49] things it has to be because god has to
[1:19:51] have a contrast to work on
[1:19:54] has to have that contrast but he god
[1:19:56] isn't doing things
[1:19:57] just to be cruel to you he's not
[1:20:00] allowing things in your life
[1:20:01] just to just to because he enjoys
[1:20:04] suffering
[1:20:05] but because he's got to build character
[1:20:07] in you because he's got to root some
[1:20:09] things out
[1:20:10] because he wants to express himself to
[1:20:12] you so that you can express
[1:20:13] him to the rest of the world
[1:20:17] that's what he's doing it's not without
[1:20:19] a purpose
[1:20:20] it's not without a cause he wants to see
[1:20:23] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:20:26] and in order to do that sometimes he's
[1:20:28] got to lay it low sometimes
[1:20:30] he's got to bring you high but it's all
[1:20:32] for a purpose
[1:20:34] that's why paul can say he said whether
[1:20:36] you be a slave or a free
[1:20:38] free man he said use it rather if you're
[1:20:41] a free man
[1:20:41] be a free man for god if you be a slave
[1:20:44] be a slave for god
[1:20:46] so it doesn't matter what situation
[1:20:48] you're in
[1:20:49] you can rest assured that god is using
[1:20:52] it for your good
[1:20:54] well it's because it's all working to a
[1:20:56] culmination it's all working to that
[1:20:58] climax
[1:20:59] it's all working to a rapture to a body
[1:21:01] change
[1:21:02] all of it is working and working all
[1:21:05] these things are driving towards
[1:21:06] a singular point the coming of the lord
[1:21:10] a rapture to taking away of his bride
[1:21:14] so with that goal in mind persevere
[1:21:19] you can take chastisement as a child
[1:21:24] and not as a bastard why because
[1:21:27] we know we have a revelation that our
[1:21:30] heavenly father
[1:21:32] doesn't chastise the way the world
[1:21:34] chastises
[1:21:36] the world chastises because they want
[1:21:38] their child to shut up
[1:21:40] because they're tired of hearing the
[1:21:41] whining because they want this or they
[1:21:43] want that
[1:21:45] but not so with god whenever god gives
[1:21:48] you a little spanking
[1:21:49] when he puts you in a situation it's for
[1:21:51] a cause and for a purpose
[1:21:54] lord give us the faith and the assurance
[1:21:58] and the love to be able to rest in that
[1:22:01] assurance
[1:22:02] because he's got it in control
[1:22:06] and you know what that's what the devil
[1:22:07] hates more than anything
[1:22:09] when you can sit there and the devil's
[1:22:11] just battering against your life
[1:22:13] because god's allowed a trial to come
[1:22:15] and you just put your hands up and say
[1:22:18] let it lord giveth and the lord taketh
[1:22:20] away but blessed be the name of the lord
[1:22:23] why because you have rest assured that
[1:22:26] he has got it all in control there's
[1:22:28] nothing out of his
[1:22:29] there's nothing out of his hands every
[1:22:32] time you're rejected
[1:22:33] every time the trials buff at you every
[1:22:35] time you fail every time you succeed
[1:22:38] god has got it in control it doesn't
[1:22:41] matter
[1:22:41] and it's all working towards something
[1:22:46] listen this from
[1:22:49] i think this was the quote i was looking
[1:22:51] for
[1:22:54] from the message look
[1:22:57] see because we're so busy looking for
[1:22:59] our own we're looking
[1:23:01] for our own ideas of what we think is
[1:23:02] coming but lord if we could just humble
[1:23:04] ourselves
[1:23:06] and accept the word in whatever way god
[1:23:09] decides to deliver it to you
[1:23:12] we get caught up in our own ideas but i
[1:23:15] like this
[1:23:16] brother abraham says it's not a joint
[1:23:18] church shake hands and a million more in
[1:23:19] 44
[1:23:20] a new church a new building or a new
[1:23:21] something it was a new life
[1:23:24] that come by a supernatural move that
[1:23:26] they were looking for to happen
[1:23:28] how many of you are looking for
[1:23:29] something to happen we are an
[1:23:31] expectation
[1:23:33] but we can't like expectation
[1:23:36] morph into where we only ex we only
[1:23:38] expect it
[1:23:39] in the way our minds have gotten it see
[1:23:42] that's where the pharisees got to
[1:23:44] they could say we were looking for a
[1:23:46] messiah but when he didn't come
[1:23:49] how they thought he should come that's
[1:23:51] where they got in trouble
[1:23:54] and it proved they weren't really ready
[1:23:55] to accept it anyhow
[1:23:57] but see the child of god the bride of
[1:24:00] jesus christ
[1:24:00] says lord even if i don't understand it
[1:24:04] i'm going to accept your word even if i
[1:24:06] don't understand the situation
[1:24:08] i'm going to trust that you're in
[1:24:09] control and you're working all things
[1:24:11] together for the good of them that love
[1:24:12] god
[1:24:14] he says it was a new life that come down
[1:24:17] by a supernatural move that they were
[1:24:18] looking for to happen
[1:24:20] they knowed every certain season then
[1:24:22] come down and they waited
[1:24:23] he says now if it isn't going on all the
[1:24:26] time
[1:24:27] and we're on top of the house jumping
[1:24:28] around we feel well we'll leave this
[1:24:30] church it's cooled off
[1:24:32] what a nonsense how we can't wait
[1:24:35] abraham didn't wait he didn't think god
[1:24:37] had cooled off
[1:24:39] he waited 25 years then he seen the hand
[1:24:42] of god move
[1:24:43] they waited at a sheet gate for month to
[1:24:45] month for whatever it was
[1:24:46] for that one supernatural moving but
[1:24:48] they looked for it
[1:24:49] oh my they were looking for it and i
[1:24:51] really like this he says we find
[1:24:53] elijah kept looking until he's seen
[1:24:56] just the size of a man's hand now
[1:24:59] unbelief
[1:25:00] would have caught that right quick if
[1:25:02] that's the best you can do
[1:25:04] see how many oh my
[1:25:07] is that the best you can do that's what
[1:25:09] the devil's right there
[1:25:10] you feel that little tug on your heart
[1:25:12] god's gonna do something and the devils
[1:25:13] is that the best god can do
[1:25:15] surely he would have come down in some
[1:25:17] great sweep
[1:25:19] for the brother brandon can say that
[1:25:21] something from your heart caused you to
[1:25:22] lift your hand to defy all the laws of
[1:25:24] gravity
[1:25:25] shows there's something in you and yet
[1:25:28] we're looking
[1:25:29] always for these great things that we
[1:25:31] call great
[1:25:34] great things that we call great what was
[1:25:36] it the welsh revival
[1:25:37] one man where's the world's revival i am
[1:25:40] the welsh revival
[1:25:41] the welsh revival's in me god calls that
[1:25:45] great
[1:25:46] that's right but we want a million more
[1:25:49] in 44 we don't say it that way but
[1:25:50] that's
[1:25:51] the carnal mind thinking of it
[1:25:55] he says i love that he said now unbelief
[1:25:56] would have caught that right quick
[1:25:58] if that's the best you can do if that's
[1:26:00] all you can do well take it back
[1:26:03] but what was it he was looking for the
[1:26:05] supernatural
[1:26:07] oh he knowed only the hand of god could
[1:26:09] do it
[1:26:10] and when he saw that hand j-e-s-u-s he
[1:26:13] had f-a-i-t-h
[1:26:15] yes and when he saw it he said i hear
[1:26:17] the sound of abundance of rain
[1:26:20] what was it he accepted the first move
[1:26:23] oh my oh my that's what he's looking for
[1:26:27] is when he moves you grab it don't have
[1:26:30] to understand it
[1:26:31] don't have to come the way you thought
[1:26:32] it should but you jump on it
[1:26:36] when he comes by and he stirs the waters
[1:26:38] jump on it
[1:26:40] he's right there to give you what you
[1:26:42] have need of he's right there and that's
[1:26:44] what his
[1:26:44] brother brothers and sisters we think
[1:26:45] the rapture is going to be
[1:26:47] you know i i was thinking you know we
[1:26:50] sing i think there's the song you know i
[1:26:52] will run through a troop i'll jump over
[1:26:53] a wall all these different things
[1:26:55] well that's the way they said about john
[1:26:57] the baptist too wasn't it
[1:26:58] mountains will skip like little rams the
[1:27:00] hills will melt like wax and look what
[1:27:02] it produced
[1:27:03] if that's the case what's the what's the
[1:27:05] latter going to produce
[1:27:07] i'm not saying that's exactly what it
[1:27:09] will be i'm not sitting here trying to
[1:27:10] do that
[1:27:11] my point is get us out of our carnal
[1:27:13] expectations
[1:27:14] and have an expectation of only one
[1:27:17] thing and that is that god
[1:27:18] will fulfill his word that's the only
[1:27:22] expectation i want to have
[1:27:24] and not only that i'm going to be
[1:27:25] looking for it i'm going to be waiting
[1:27:27] for it
[1:27:27] and when it does come i'm just going to
[1:27:29] say lord give me a revelation to catch
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:31] and he will because he promised it he
[1:27:34] promised you
[1:27:35] that he would give you that revelation
[1:27:36] that the gates of hell couldn't prevail
[1:27:38] against it he'd build his church on that
[1:27:40] revelation
[1:27:43] he's going to do it he is doing it even
[1:27:45] now
[1:27:46] you may not see it but he's working
[1:27:49] israel didn't see all that was going on
[1:27:52] in pharaoh's house
[1:27:53] during those 40 years and they surely
[1:27:55] didn't see
[1:27:56] what was going on in the backside of the
[1:27:58] desert for the other 40 years
[1:28:00] but god was moving the whole time he was
[1:28:02] working the whole time
[1:28:04] so is it now oh we don't see this and we
[1:28:07] don't see that
[1:28:08] just because you don't see it doesn't
[1:28:10] mean it ain't happening
[1:28:12] because god is always working his
[1:28:14] purpose is going to be fulfilled
[1:28:15] unbelief is not going to hinder the
[1:28:17] promises of god
[1:28:18] doesn't matter he's going to do it
[1:28:20] anyhow it's going to happen he's
[1:28:21] bringing it to pass because he promised
[1:28:23] it
[1:28:23] he said the word has gone forth from my
[1:28:25] lips it shall not return to me void
[1:28:28] shall not return to me void he said i
[1:28:31] have called me a bride
[1:28:32] without spot wrinkle he said in the
[1:28:35] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:28:37] that last trump's gonna sound i'm an
[1:28:40] expectation for it i'm looking for it
[1:28:43] and when it comes i'm going to jump
[1:28:45] right on it why because he promised me
[1:28:48] he pro i believe he promised you amen
[1:28:53] hey man let's just stand won't keep you
[1:28:57] too long here
[1:29:00] he's building up to this culmination
[1:29:04] it's been all these times you look at
[1:29:07] brother branham
[1:29:08] surely nobody thought malachi 4 was
[1:29:10] going to be a hillbilly from kentucky
[1:29:12] you couldn't barely speak right
[1:29:15] which i still think is kind of funny
[1:29:16] because some of the words he still uses
[1:29:19] is better than our seventh grade
[1:29:20] education today you know
[1:29:22] but you think about it what it was back
[1:29:24] then you think about the intellectualism
[1:29:25] now
[1:29:27] it's not about that brothers and sisters
[1:29:29] god chose
[1:29:30] disciples that couldn't even sign their
[1:29:32] own name
[1:29:34] couldn't even sign their own name and we
[1:29:37] think unless you can recite every
[1:29:39] message
[1:29:40] every word and have an intellectual
[1:29:42] understanding
[1:29:43] no god will reveal it by his spirit
[1:29:47] he will show you listen to it that's why
[1:29:49] faith comes by hearing and not always by
[1:29:50] just reading i say thank the lord
[1:29:52] i think that what was that what was i
[1:29:54] think that was the story where he said
[1:29:56] he said i believe that he said i can't
[1:29:57] read it but i'll believe the cover
[1:29:59] he said the cover said holy bible he
[1:30:01] said i believe that
[1:30:03] if god can do that
[1:30:06] what's he gonna do for us he's doing it
[1:30:09] now
[1:30:10] he's fulfilling his word you
[1:30:13] you just stand at your position you
[1:30:14] stand at your post of duty
[1:30:17] he said if you'll be faithful and little
[1:30:19] you'll be faithful and much
[1:30:21] so if it's if it's a little thing now it
[1:30:23] seems like a great thing it may be a
[1:30:24] little thing now
[1:30:25] just to come to church and get in your
[1:30:27] position here
[1:30:28] be a soldier this is the barracks get to
[1:30:31] the barracks
[1:30:33] getting to hear the orders from
[1:30:34] headquarters
[1:30:37] we need that five-fold ministry for the
[1:30:40] perfecting of the church and he's doing
[1:30:43] it
[1:30:43] through the word through the holy ghost
[1:30:46] manifesting that word
[1:30:47] and quickening that word
[1:30:50] so be at your post and then when the
[1:30:53] orders come to move then we move
[1:30:56] he's making it happen i'm an expectation
[1:30:59] that he's bringing us to the climactic
[1:31:01] point
[1:31:03] and i love how brother david said it you
[1:31:05] know we had our candidate
[1:31:08] i made my vote for that candidate long
[1:31:10] time ago
[1:31:12] i only had to vote once and thank the
[1:31:14] lord i voted once and he reigns forever
[1:31:16] in my heart
[1:31:18] i love that the perfect candidate we
[1:31:21] don't have to worry about what this
[1:31:22] world's got
[1:31:23] what they're thinking of because my
[1:31:24] thoughts aren't with this world
[1:31:27] i'm looking beyond that whatever the
[1:31:29] lord gives us in this world
[1:31:30] he says use it rather for the glory of
[1:31:33] god
[1:31:34] if he's made you rich in lands or
[1:31:36] whatever it may use it for the glory of
[1:31:37] god
[1:31:40] amen he's doing it i believe it how many
[1:31:42] believe that how many can
[1:31:44] rest knowing he's got it all in control
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:47] why because he's called you the bride of
[1:31:49] jesus christ to be the culmination
[1:31:51] of this age to bring us into a rapture
[1:31:55] that has nothing to do with being a
[1:31:57] prideful thing it ought to actually make
[1:31:58] us the most humblest people
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] to say oh lord and to tell people tell
[1:32:04] people
[1:32:04] the lord has called me to get out of
[1:32:06] this place
[1:32:08] but he's given you the opportunity to if
[1:32:11] you can accept it
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:13] they are to be so humble and so sweet
[1:32:16] and loving
[1:32:17] let's just trust the lord relax in that
[1:32:20] sense
[1:32:21] although we're pressing that battle we
[1:32:23] can relax i was telling i was telling
[1:32:24] some people
[1:32:25] it's a paradox we're constantly pressing
[1:32:28] to the mark
[1:32:28] of the high calling but at the same time
[1:32:30] we're totally relaxed
[1:32:32] it's we're a paradox to the world
[1:32:35] constantly
[1:32:36] bearing a burden for souls and yet at
[1:32:38] the
[1:32:39] same time completely confident that the
[1:32:40] lord's got it all in control
[1:32:42] that's why the devil hates you because
[1:32:44] no matter how much
[1:32:45] he could maybe see you get in that
[1:32:47] prayer closet and come out crying and
[1:32:49] and and burdened for things and then
[1:32:52] just get go about your business saying
[1:32:53] onward christian
[1:32:55] soul and the devil says i don't
[1:32:57] understand that yeah he can't understand
[1:32:59] it
[1:32:59] because he's not a partaker he can't be
[1:33:02] partakers of that
[1:33:03] as a paradigm i love that paradox the
[1:33:06] lord is faithful he that begun a good
[1:33:08] work in you is faithful to complete it
[1:33:12] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:33:14] of prayer heavenly father lord
[1:33:17] lord we just lift up the name of the
[1:33:18] lord jesus father you've called us to be
[1:33:21] a manifestation in this last hour
[1:33:23] to manifest your attributes to the world
[1:33:25] lord god to be a culmination
[1:33:27] the the climax of all these things oh
[1:33:29] god how you've
[1:33:30] manifested in small ways throughout the
[1:33:32] ages
[1:33:34] lord i believe it in the scripture it
[1:33:36] says that in the in the olden days you
[1:33:38] spoke through your servants the prophets
[1:33:39] but in these last days you revealed
[1:33:41] yourself
[1:33:41] by your son and now even even now you're
[1:33:44] revealing yourself
[1:33:46] in your people to the world and the
[1:33:50] scripture says that the light shine in
[1:33:51] the darkness and the darkness
[1:33:52] comprehended it not
[1:33:54] so lord we don't get discouraged when
[1:33:56] the world doesn't understand us
[1:33:58] when it seems like everybody rejects us
[1:34:00] and our trials get rough sometimes
[1:34:03] because lord we know that we're abiding
[1:34:05] in that light as you are in the light
[1:34:07] and we can have fellowship lord with you
[1:34:09] in that light
[1:34:10] lord and we're resting in the light of
[1:34:12] this hour we're resting knowing that
[1:34:14] you've given us a word lord that we can
[1:34:16] hold fast lord a revelation that the
[1:34:18] gates of hell can't prevail against lord
[1:34:20] jesus
[1:34:21] i pray oh god that you would just lord
[1:34:24] give us
[1:34:24] courage lord jesus to continue fighting
[1:34:27] the good fight of faith
[1:34:28] to stand for truth oh god when all the
[1:34:31] world is going insane oh lord
[1:34:33] may we just stand firm lord on that rock
[1:34:36] of revelation knowing oh god that you've
[1:34:38] lord you're bringing it to pass
[1:34:41] lord and like the three hebrew boys even
[1:34:43] if you don't deliver in this manner we
[1:34:45] know he's more than able
[1:34:47] lord and we know that at the end here
[1:34:49] our greatest deliverance is to be
[1:34:50] delivered from this body of flesh
[1:34:52] into your presence lord at that wedding
[1:34:54] supper lord we glorify you
[1:34:57] we just ask that you would give strength
[1:34:58] to your people and let us go from this
[1:35:00] place lord and
[1:35:01] magnify the holy name of the lord jesus
[1:35:03] christ and in the name of the lord jesus
[1:35:05] we ask
[1:35:06] amen
