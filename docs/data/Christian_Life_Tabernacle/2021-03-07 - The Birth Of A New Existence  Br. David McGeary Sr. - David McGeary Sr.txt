Description:
The Birth Of A New Existence
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service: March 7,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

so i'm reading this morning amen god bless you good morning it's good to see everyone here this morning it's getting a little harder to get up here quick because of the people that are here and that's a good thing praise the lord for seeing everyone this morning you know in first samuel chapter 9 we read about how the prophet samuel found saul and approached him with the message that he would be king would anoint him to be king you know his response was am i am i not a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribes of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou to me and what's interesting is it's only four chapters later it's hard to believe that his kingdom is being taken from him because he moved from a place of humility to being to a place that he would have found himself or thought himself greater than god's word and it's then in first samuel 13 that we first hear this statement when the samuel speaking to saul it says but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people and we know the story david was ultimately the one who was identified with the scripture but it was at this moment the very same place where we first hear the testimony that he was a man after god's own heart it's the very same place that david began to be the target of so much attack we're going to read in psalm 7 this morning and there's an interesting footnote at the beginning of the chapter in the king james it says this it's a shigeon of david which he's saying unto the lord concerning the words of cush the benjamite now we don't know exactly what these words were you know scriptures don't reference that but we do know this we know that among the many challenges that david had to deal with was the constant attack of the accuser he was constantly doing battle with accusations that were being leveled against him and he had a complicated relationship among other things with the benjamites see it was saul that had been chosen the people's king out of the smallest tribe the benjamites and they never got over that when the throne was taken from him and given to someone else david was constantly being targeted by accusations that he had usurped the king you know that he had stolen the throne that he didn't have the rightful rulership even though the lord put him there he was constantly facing the attack of the accuser even though the lord had positioned him he had to deal with this accuser you can read about it in the scriptures the story of shimyai you can you know we wonder even if saul's own father was one he was a great man that potentially accused him but regardless it was a daily battle that he had to face and that's one of the one of the struggles that we have on a daily basis is constantly dealing with the accuser having someone there always pointing their finger at us trying to find a fault with either something we did or even something we didn't do but it's interesting how david responds to this in chapter seven whatever this accusation is it's in verse 3 he goes before the lord and he says oh lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my hands if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me and in verse 5 it says then let the enemy persecute my soul and take it i don't know about you but that's not the first thing i pray when i get accused of something but it's a reflection of a man after god's own heart his first response is it me have i done this you know as he said search me and know my heart try me and see if there be any wicked way in me and then the very next thing he does is he commits himself into the hands of the righteous judge in verse 8 the lord shall judge the people judge me oh lord according to my righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me that was the earmark of this man that was after god's own heart even when he did sin we know the story of him of bathsheba his response was i just commit myself into the hands of the lord and to his mercy that he would do with me as he would the the reaction to accusation the response to the accuser that a man after god's own heart had you know what's interesting is outside of this footnote cush is never mentioned again here he just went before the lord and said if i have done this then let me be persecuted by my enemy by my accuser and yet there's no record that he ever was instead he committed himself into the hands of the lord and the righteous judge did not hold him accountable it's like he never did it in the first place there is no mention of cush anymore he has no mention in scripture as far as the lord's concerned whatever the accusation was he never did it in the first place when he committed himself into the hands of that righteous judge you know and so i was encouraged by that because here's an example of a man after god's own heart and here's the answer to the accuser the accuser that we face every single day him and all of his acolytes that would come to accuse us of things we've done to accuse us of things we haven't done we have the answer if i've done this then i commit myself into the hands of the righteous judge and the end result is cush is never seen again it's as if he never did it in the first place so you know as we read psalm chapter seven together you know it just was encouraged by the fact that we have that example and we have that place of rest where we can respond to the accuser let's read that together psalm chapter 7 o lord my god in thee do i put my trust save me from all them that persecute me and deliver me lest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while there is none to deliver oh lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my hands if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay mine honor in the dust selah arise o lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded so shall the congregation of the people come past the above for their sakes therefore return thou on high the lord shall judge the people judge me o lord according to my righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the trust for the righteous god trieth the darts and reigns my defense is of god which saveth the upright in heart god judgeth the righteous and god is angry with the wicked every day if he turn not he will wet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it ready he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood he made a pit and digged it and has fallen into the ditch which he had made his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pace i will praise the lord according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high amen amen god bless you and have your seats or do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] how it is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] by the water of the never having to look back [Music] [Applause] [Music] no [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] according to the lord [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh

set me free [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Applause] oh jesus amen amen aren't you glad you know where you're going amen he set us free amen so we could be part of his kingdom amen are we thankful for that amen he meant brother kyle is a testimony for us this morning and many of you can come at this time lord bless you i just wanted to start with uh reading this short quote here it's from i have heard but now i see brother branham says but first you see your motives and objectives has to be right you have to have reasons for this god don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of god see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling god what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see there's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of god and then when the faith is revealed to you and god by a sovereign grace places that faith in there then it's over um i'll just be brief but a couple weeks ago i started having some swelling and pressure in my right eye just decided to have it checked out the eye doctor said everything was fine but you want a a ct or an mri i was kind of like well what should i do what do you want me to do and he said well let's get a let's get a ct scan and i kind of didn't want to do it but i talked with my wife and we decided to go ahead and do it um got the ct done i got a call the following day and they said um we think it could be one of three things one is kind of like a malformation of a vessel in your brain and it can be kind of dangerous it's something that a lot of times you have to have surgery for to get fixed then another one was more of like a developmental thing that's pretty normal most people have them and or a lot of people have them and don't know that they have it and then the third they said but less likely was you're having an isolated hemorrhage in your brain and that's when it gets real and your flesh starts to take on all the symptoms diagnosis everything that the doctor is trying to throw at you but something inside me was just like you know take god at his word do the things that he says to do so i i had my folks pray for me my wife prayed with me uh i reached out to brother david sister leslie other friends i wore a prayer cloth for a couple days almost full time so i was like i'm going to do my part and the lord will then go do his part and they wanted the mri done pretty quick so when got that done and i got a call on my way home because everything was set up to be urgent because it's your brain and all that kind of stuff so um they called me on the way home and the doctor said um you know it looks like you have kind of like the second one i was telling you about the the pretty normal occurrence where you have just kind of a weird vein in your brain that can cause headaches or something like that and it may have bled at some point but it doesn't seem to be too big of an issue and they want me to see some specialists going forward but it was like even just knowing that was you know off the table with the surgeries and all those different things and and it was like the lord followed through exactly it was i i did my part he did his part and i just i want to thank him for that the healing that he performed i'm looking forward they they scheduled me for appointments but they're a month out so nothing's you know super serious or anything i'm just continuing to trust it it's all going to be well and all good and i thank you all for your prayers and everything so appreciate that amen it's the present helping them of need amen amen certainly thankful for that amen we have a couple of requests you want to bring before the church um there was an email sent out that the if you want your photo taken or updated for the directory this morning uh please just see sister rebecca right after service this morning also communion and food washing is tonight also a reminder don't forget about the funds matching for the building for the building account i believe there's a match for everything that the church will give so they can match it i believe up to 50 000 so we certainly want to keep that in our hearts amen brother but andrew writes please pray for brother juan he wants to be in service today and he's feeling very bad needs a touch from the lord man is certainly just going to lift our brother up in prayer this morning amen that the lord will go by his way and just touch him and i believe when you you hear the word amen it just brings that presence of god in the room so he could touch and heal you man if you're having it upon your heart just lift your hand up to him the brothers that are taking the offering see if he can come at this time amen but a cousin if you could just come and take distance before the law [Music] [Music] let's pray heavenly father lord jesus lord just like we heard a testimony this morning lord lord you're changed not lord jesus lord you're the same lord i just ask that you just increase our faith lord to just be able to walk by faith and not by sight lord we might not understand that we might not see it immediately lord and maybe sometimes we might be impatient the lord you know all things from the beginning lord and just like your prophet said lord what's the reason we want to be healed lord we want to be healed because we want to manifest that attribute of feeling within our bodies lord jesus lord we want to testify to the people that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord that's our reason lord to live a life of christ that

desire this morning i just really trust this morning that the lord will be our portion this message this morning has really been on my heart we just trusted for those that want a new spirit amen our heavenly father lord we're overwhelmed at the wisdom of your word father i'm moved by what that you've stored in the storehouse for us father you said you could do nothing unless you first revealed it to your servants the prophet and lord you chose to place in a a river of wealth and and blessings for your church you send it in the form of a message delivered by the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 and luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7 the scriptural fulfillment of your word and you left with your church a message that would be stored and brought forth to them in the hour of need and your holy spirit would make it alive just like the bible father it's been stored up to the prophets and the great writers and we can still open it today and see you living and speaking to our hearts once again this morning father we need you to break the bread of life we need you father to make it personal to each person according to their individual need lord we ask that you give them enlightenment that they can understand the great process of how that you've chosen to do things and that we could become subject to these things we ask for your great presence this morning in your wonderful and beautiful name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning let's go right into the word by opening our bibles this morning we'll be ministering from the message called birth pains we're not going to really play a portion today but we do are trusting that uh the word of god will be a blessing to you as we read uh portions of it so we're gonna read in saint john the 16th chapter the 19th through the 21st verse 19 through the 20th first verse this message is the message where uh if you have your bibles these two these two pages of the bible were stuck together brother branham we got a brand new bible and these pages were stuck together and so when he went to 16 and he turned the page he went over and it wasn't the same verse and this is the the message where the catholic priest came up and said here read it from mine and you know brother branham was very gracious and he turned around he said thank you brother you know and i that's just the love of god that spilled out of that great prophet's heart but um but then you know the lord spoke to him why that that was but i can't even begin to touch into this message how deep it is but there's a certain part that i wanted for us and i'm not trying to re-preach the message to the world if you understand that i i'm not looking at any audience outside of the ones that's sitting here and those that are part of our congregation so you know i don't believe this message needs any further vindication and i'm not capable of vindicating it but i am interested in going into what that he said and bringing it to us our local assembly for our needs and so i just want you to understand that that i can't go into the great depths of this because it's beyond my ability but let's just read here as we read in john 16 19. and jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye inquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you father bless your word in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated this morning if i was to title this message this morning i would entitle it the birth of a new existence the birth of a new existence um we preached a little bit last week i believe from broken cisterns and we said that the tooth existed sins that man did and we talked about that man has a natural way of doing his own thing he hewed for himself out his own cisterns his his own plan that we call them catches that's what he said his sister and does and when something's man-made it catches everything and it attracts everything stagnant water he said that's not living and not flowing attracts lizards and frogs and wiggle tails and and pollywogs and all those things it's a an attraction that comes from being stagnated and still and uh we've we find that a lot of times that when we're not moving forward with god that in our lives kind of come into a stagnant place that it seems like things of the world start being attracted and i we were fellowshipping on that last week so this sermon is to continue on to that and add to that because i believe our desire is to have that living water flowing and and to move up to higher ground the brother come to me and he said now brother that's so true what you said i kind of just got a little stale at work and just kind of gotten the routine and i wasn't really on fire for god he said pretty soon the baptists were fellowshipping with me and they came over and were sitting at the table with me and eating lunch and all of a sudden i was everybody's buddy he says but the lord kind of dealt with my heart and i was reading a message and god dealt with me and i got a revelation he said the next time they were there i was saying wow look at what's in god's word isn't it wonderful he said next lunch day there was nobody there so you you understand that there's got to be a desire in our heart to move forward with god okay don't don't think just because that you've been given the revelation and the understanding that god sent a vindicated message that we have a picture of the pillar of fire that led the children of israel that was the same way that god appeared in the pillar of fire that's what he did he appeared in the pillar of fire by day he appeared as a cloud by night and these two vindications of god leading the children of israel both of those have been manifested in our day and but you've still got to go forward on the journey you know okay in other words they couldn't sit in the desert and say we've got a pillar of fire we've got a cloud they had to continue the the travel and the travail to go to that promised land that place that they want to be now we have a lot of promised lands in our lives places that we we want to be i would call it a higher ground and so we want to talk about what what takes place in that journey so each of us can understand as an individual what uh what we're going to what's going to trans transpire in our lives to move from captivity to promise and jesus spoke these words to the disciples and uh he that you know you will have sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned to joy he spoke that to his disciples because he knew that the birth of christianity was coming into existence so we we don't want to look at it historically as the birth of christianity coming into existence but we want to look at it as the birth of a christian coming into existence and we all is anybody in here want to be a better christian oh okay so we you haven't arrived yet you know but you know he's arrived and he's with you and in you so he's going to take you there so he was going to take the church so he's telling the church and he's laying it out to the the church knowing that the cr the birth of a christian church was going to take is going to come into existence and that's why i call this message the birth of a new existence so we're talking about what it takes and so we know that the natural birth and that's what jesus refers to here he says a woman when she's in travail and in other words there's a suffering there's a struggle there's a travail to bring forth a new life and uh so he says he says now you're going to have sorrow he says now the world will be rejoicing you know i mean i you know there can be a a hundred uh a hundred accidents a day out here where somebody gets hurt but you let a preacher get in an accident you know it'll be on the news okay you let somebody slip or somebody makes an accusation whether it's true or not it'll make the front page you know and that because that's what the world does it it rejoices and so uh he knew that in christianity that at the birth of christianity was going to be a birth it was going to be a sorrowful very uh a very a struggle for that church to be born and he said but don't go through the struggle because the joy that's going to come cannot be taken away from you and so i want this this morning to take this to our personal lives i started reading this message i was led to this message i thought oh lord this is just for me to preach and then the more i got into it and the more god done it i thought man he's talking to me this is where i'm at this is what i'm going through and then i had a lot of doubts about coming here and preaching it you know what i mean but i'm we're no big eyes or little yous so we're just all going through something together and i've heard the cry of the people i've heard the sermons of the brothers i've i've heard the desires in their hearts and i believe everybody here is wanting higher ground [Music] and so we know that if the natural birth is that way the prophet of god says he says the natural birth types the spiritual bird all things of the natural is a type of the spiritual all things of the natural birth is a type of a spiritual birth so if you want to have a spiritual birth you've got the ability to sit back and look and know well what is the type of that what what transpires and then we can understand that those things same things will transpire within us as an individual so that's what he says he says that that it it it the natural birth type the spirituals and all things of the natural birth is the type of the spiritual birth and we find out if we look out here on the ground and see a tree and the earth growing is struggling for life you see what he says see look the natural they type the same so look at it it's struggling for life and it and it goes to show that there is a tree somewhere that doesn't die because it's crying out for something so that's what we realize is that if we if if the spiritual birth now we get to the idea there's one spiritual birth if there's one spiritual birth you're one year old you understand it's it's a birth we're we're talking this morning about our our desire to to go up and to uh to go up to higher ground and and it goes to show that there's something crying out so if you you find out that there's something in your heart crying out in other words you know you're stagnant you know there's frogs and lizards in your life or you just realize that day after day you're you're you're in the same place and so uh it you you uh you understand that there's something within you that's crying out now in a natural birth uh in a natural birth when a a baby is uh uh born can and uh it's going through its struggles and it's it's trials we find out in that birth that sometimes that baby needs a a little spanking or a little shake something to shock it and sometimes the birth itself will cause the the shocking or or the shaking act and so you're looking at yourselves today and it's so it's not the birth of christianity as a whole but it's the birth of christianity in me you understand that i'm the one that's trying to go to higher ground i'm the one that god is trying to form into the image of his son and and sometimes the potter's got to take the clay and completely break it down to remold it again the way that he can use it so i i we look at ourselves here and we we understand that we're not looking at something outside of ourselves what we want to be is examine and understand the process that god uses and to realize that that's his choice and so he says that sometimes it takes a uh something to shock it you know what i mean to shake it in order for it to catch that breath of life now we just said the natural is a perfect type of the spiritual the things that takes place in the natural birth takes place in the spiritual birth as well so when somebody is going to to get moved from one place to another place be ready for a little a shock in your life something all of a sudden you realize what you've done or you realize where you're at it's like your light comes on you says my goodness i'm in a trash can or i'm in a stagnant pond i'm dwelling with frogs and with lizards and with horny toads and all kinds of things like that nothing against the horny toads you know i love them but uh it just uh it it's just a realization do you understand so if you're in a place in your life then be ready for a shock from god amen you know ask god for the shock but that what it takes so we understand in this birth that that if god laid this plan down then there's no way that it's going to go outside of god's plan without being hybrid in other words without being a man-made system that all the water leaks out but he said if if you that that sorrow is turned to joy that is a joy that no man can take from you and if the living well springs up within you that's not a well that no man can stop up it becomes real and it becomes living amen and so we read that as we kind of go into this understanding of this morning it says he says i think a baby is born by stillbirth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby okay and it says that's what's the matter with the church today the system we've got too many stillborn children that's right folks we don't want to be stillborn you understand we want to have some passion about what we believe we want to have some emotion about what we feel we want to have a sense of life if i could say this essential possession you want to know what you possess it's like a man that looks in the field and finds a great treasure you know he's uh he's he's found something of great worth and uh so i don't know what that was but i'll tell you brothers when i want you to post something thank you it says it says that's what's the matter with the church today the system we've got too many stillborn children that's right they need a gospel spanking you see and and so to wake them up to bring themselves so that god can breathe the breath of life into them now we find that's so true it's crude theology but it's the truth anyhow so that's what god chose is the foolishness of preaching so he says what it takes in our life sometimes is to to bring forth a life to put a breath of life in you well when you're stagnant you're laying in the same condition and you're in that day in and day out and everything what do we even call that in the natural world it needs a breath of life what do we call it a breath of fresh air it needs some freshness to it it needs some zeal back into it it's restore unto me the joy of my salvation cast me not away don't take your spirit from me that's that crying out because you cry out because you know that there's another life there's a better life there's something missing and you're hungering for it then you're thirsty and you desire it in your heart so if you're there then it's a good it becomes a time where you need to understand what the process is of getting from a to b and it takes a it takes a a gospel spanking it takes a shock in other words not just something carnal okay but it takes something spiritual to strike you the spirit something in the spirit world something in the spirit realm because something that's not natural but supernatural so if you're going to be moved to the supernatural it's got to be something supernatural that shocks you and moves you no man cometh unto me except the father draws him so he's saying that that in order to to have this great uh a great uh revival within your life a great a drink from the fountain something that brings brings the breath of life into them it's going to take something supernatural to shock them okay so which one so notice in a seed's birth now i i don't really need to and want to know a whole lot about a sunflower seed but i have a seed okay so he's not talking about a sunflower seed s-u-n he's talking about an s-o-n-c so when we talk about us and what's one of the things that we always say we have the seed of god in us we're the seed of god god planted a seed in me there's a we have a seed before the foundation of the world god knew we'd be here and he put a seed in us so now he's saying in a seeds isn't that in a seed's birth so now i what seed am i interested what seed am i interested in coming to life it's the seed that's in me the seed's birth that's my seed's verse not just a seed's birth but it's my seed's birth in a seed's birth in my seed's birth it says the old seed must die before the new one can be born amen now we're gonna go now let's don't take this keep taking this back to the sinner this is beyond salvation this is this is on our life's journey so we're not just going back and talking about the process of coming from being in the world to being a christian we're not talking about the process of being a non-believer of the word of god for the hour to becoming a believer in the message that god sent you this is talking about what we go through personally he said you notice in a seed birth the old must die so before look the old seed must die before the new one can be born so therefore death is hard any time death is hard any time so not just one time any time or many times death is hard so it's painful it's distressful birth is the same because you're bringing life into the world and it's painful so there there's a a struggle there's a birth and so that's that's what he's telling us here that there's going to be a birth and a birth has a process if it's the way that it is he says and it's painful jesus said that this word was a seed that the sower went forth and sold now we're all acquainted with that and what i want to teach this this like a sunday school lesson because it's sunday notice then this word being a seed but remember the seed is only brings forth a new life when it dies in other words it's only going to bring forth a new life when it goes through the pains of birth it's not going to bring forth a new life without the struggle without the distress without the pain the baby is not going to come from the womb or the place that it is into a new breath of life without a travail without a process and now many times we're in that process and we don't even realize it we don't have an understanding of what's taking place within our our own selves he says he says so we we uh we look at this and we we begin to see that it's got it's got to die it's got to go through the pain and so he says now notice that now we notice that it's always my thought now to you it takes pain distress discomfort look at how the pharisees died to that law through pain distress discomfort but it must be it must be so look at when you want to go to higher ground and you want to go to a higher place you've got to come out of the place or the condition you're in and it takes a struggle a a fight a pain a birth from the old to the new so you can be just i'm not so we're not talking about people that aren't christians we're not talking about people that aren't doing right but this morning what we're saying is if you find that you are in a place in your life because god you have a sense of being shocked by the spirit whether it's prophecies coming to pass that you see the messenger talking about the purple dress and and you see it right before your eyes you see the quote about masks and people hiding you see these things before your eye it's a shock it it's supposed to uh create the desire for a breath of fresh air and life to come into you but he doesn't want you to be ignorant of the fact that that's going to take pain and distress and struggle so even to move from one spiritual condition to another spiritual condition is going to take a birth it's not an easy thing to go from one place in your life to another place when god wants to change your life he wants to change the way that you are and so we we see that that that's it that's the way it must be okay and there's a reason why that is and if we just follow with me this morning he says now we find that rain which brings forth fruit upon the earth is born as the poet said in the fields of thunder in ragged jagged skies but if we didn't have the thunder and the ragged jagged skies the little distilled drop of rain that's been lifted from the sea and distilled from the salt it would not be born now listen what he keeps saying he says that that's what happens you're being lifted if i could say that from whatever sea you're in you're going to have to go through the jagged thunders of the sky to be distilled to take this the salt out of you act as a type you know the process takes things out of you it causes a change he's saying here as a type as an understanding it's it's drawn now we'll get to this part of it but it's drawn by the sun it's put through the process of the jagged thunder skies and then it's dropped off as a soft petal of rain it in it it brings forth the soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring forth birth it takes dying and as the cloud dies rain is born have you ever seen those dark clouds the rain all pours out of it and all of a sudden they're not dark no more because the cloud had to die but it had to go through the thunder the jagged the struggles the the discomforts of it to go from from the one place to the other he says in the cloud he says they bring forth he says and as the cloud die the rain is born because rain is part of the cloud so you understand that it's part of the birth it's part of coming from the thunder dark spot you're in now it might not be dark to the world but it's dark to you just where you are in your life as an everyday christian you've been doing good all your life you've been keeping the word you've been going to church you've been paying your tithes you've been visiting the sick you've been doing everything that is on the books but all of a sudden that life becomes dark to you and it's supposed to we're not campers we're going beyond the camp [Music] this world is not our home we're just traveling through amen we're looking for a a city we're looking for a kingdom whose maker is god it's not made by hand and so he says he says and one has to cease so the other one can exist one's got to cease no matter how good it is right no matter how comfortable it seems god makes it dark because he's wanting you to move may i say it like this he has a place he's going to meet you and it ain't where you're at all right so he's got a process to get you there and so you've got this desire to to have higher higher ground so you've got to come out of the place you are the condition you're in uh the the state of mind you're in so it takes a struggle and and a fight a pain a birth from the old to the new because one has to cease for the other to exist so you might like everything about your life but when that becomes dark and god's trying to move you on this it's got to cease in order for the new to exist and and to get to that place is going to be a struggle full of distress full full of pain and a wonderment and battle in your mind so you you just get there and and that's what he is and he's he's he's talking here he says he jesus says consider the lily brother ben brought us to the part about the pond lily and and and he uses this many times but i thought it was again i'd like just to say it's fork you know about the pond lily now we know the pond lily is down in the seed of that lies down in the bottom of the muck we're not using it this morning for those that are in the muck right okay we're talking this morning about us when god wants to move us to higher ground and and we realized when he wants to move us that many times he makes where we are very uncomfortable i'm not talking about going getting a new mattress topper that's right i'm talking about you get spiritually uncomfortable you run to your bank account and there's plenty of money there you'll go ask your boss is there still work here you know pretty soon you you can't even find comfort in the carnal security that you're built in my car starts my tires have got tread my radio works i probably should take it out all these things are there but yet there's a seed that wanting to birth and that was where so many people have failed and the prophet they got stillborn and they queued for themselves out of cistern and it got stagnant amen because they were comfortable without the water flowing but if you're of his yes you understand now he's drawing you to a place or a condition of rapture in order to do that he's got to take you from where you are to a new life and he said this that this was given to the church because he knew christianity was going to come into birth now i could go right now through all the seven church ages to the four horse riders and everything that the church went to to come to where we are today so now we see that that so we understand that he is the great s-o-n and he's drawing you no matter where you are if you're in high school if you're in college if you're an old man like i am you know you i would have thought that after all this time god i've arrived i can lay down and i can i've labored 50 years 45 years here and now it's time to coast god don't got no coast god don't got no neutral god don't got no reverse he ain't got that stuff and if if you sit down and you become stale and you become stagnant the gospel is going to come along and shock you and god is going to draw you from that condition and you are going to go through the birth pain process he said he said this little pond lily look at where it comes out dirt muck mud muddy water dirty water it pressed its wake through all of that this little germ of life now what did he call it the seed's birth and what are we saying the birth of a new existence so this pond lilies down in the muck and that's what i'm trying to tell you this morning sometimes the very place you are becomes muck and you can't keep looking back at old experiences that's how people make up evidences you know you can't look at a corpse and say it once lived at once talked at once breathed no you've got to realize that the life has passed out of it and if we become spiritual corpse then we need a breath of life a breath of new life and a breath of new life takes a birth and the birth is a process it's a struggle it's a pain it's something you go through because little german life working itself from the bottom of the pond where the frogs and things are at and then brings itself up through all of that it brings itself up so if you understand when god's starting to move on you all of a sudden your life starts to become a struggle you're dismayed you're distressed you're perplexed what's wrong i should be the most happy person in the world why do i feel this way can you find out something's taking place there's a birth taking place there's something happening it's there it's time to move you start crying out if you start wondering what's going on why am i going through this okay i you know look at and you you go back over your theology i believe the message of the hour i believe the pillar of fire i believe the seals are open i believe in the church ages you talk to people you say i'm the seed of god and and you talked about it and you talked about all the revelations and we pat one another on the back and say you're okay i'm okay but the reality of it is you are in a birth and the sooner you realize it the quicker that it takes place that's right amen so from the bottom the frogs and brings forth through all that but when it gets into the presence of the sun it's born now listen close the little seed burst open into life it cannot do that until it goes through all the processes now remember what a man-made cistern is you get all you get in this place where god's trying to bring you up to higher grounds in a higher place and if you don't go through the process you go hue for yourself a cistern a catch you come up with an answer i've seen it all my life i've seen people get this comfortable they get distressed that they're going through i know that god's trying to find a birth form i know that god's trying to to do something in their lives i'm not a prophet i don't know what it is but i've been around a christian enough to recognize the hand of god on somebody's life and it's in that time that i see people make the worst decisions for their life that they could ever make they break the process they heal for themselves their own catch their own answer because they don't want to complete the pain the struggle the distress they don't want to go through it they find a better pastor a better church a better job a better this a better that but all they've done is delay the delivery because they'll find the same place the same problem that's one good thing i love about the lord if you fail he'll give you another chance you will find yourself right back at the same birth until you go through the process and are born and i'm not talking about the new birth i'm talking about the next step in a christian life a child doesn't get from one step to the next step without struggling right i love watching a baby go up and then i like i love watching them figure out how to get down because that's part of the birth growth with struggle now let's just read he says until it goes through the process it's got to come through that that's what makes it you understand that do you you want to be a better christian you want to be more read your bible you want to pray more you want to listen to more tapes you've got all these wonderful ideas okay but the very fact that you want those things ought to tell you you're in the muck and when you're there and you're doing all those things and they're not satisfying you then you've got to understand that there's something that's drawing you to higher ground and you're going to have to go through the process and understand the process we'll talk about it just here in a second he says that's what makes it it's because that the sun itself is what's drawing it and when it gets fully above all the dirty water and muck and so forth then it's so happy it just gives out its life out freely and if it's a beautiful life when it gets into the presence of that which is drawing it up so understand that so you're in a place and now the sun s-o-n is trying to draw you up but in order to get there you're going to have to go through the struggle of going through the water that you're in the state of mind that you're in and everything that you're in you're going to have to go through all those things so all of a sudden you find yourself in a mental battle what's wrong with where i'm at what's wrong with what i'm doing why ain't i happy why have i been just like i am for so many years you got a gospel shot and now you want to go up because he's the one that's drawing you but he can't draw you through anything but birth pains you can't bypass that he's got to draw you through that you ever like where all of a sudden you're going out there one good sign of going through birth pains is you find fault in everybody everybody that made you happy don't make you happy no more you get a 20 hour raise and you hate your job you're dissatisfied you're not dissatisfied by yourself god's doing that to you because he wants to bring you through the birth veins because that's what makes you and that going through the birth pain is what brings the joy then you forget what you've been through you forget the travail all of a sudden you have a new peace you have a new joy you have a new understanding and you're hallelujah and the beautiful thing about that is is that joy cannot be taken from you but you can't fall apart when you're going through the pain the birth and there's not just one birth in christianity it's a birth of faith the birth of revelation he says that's what makes it what it is he says i think that's a beautiful type of christian life oh that tells me a lot when he's going through this he says this is a christian life this is the christian life that's what transpires in a christian life the son drawing us from one place to the other and we've got to go through the birth struggle mentally spiritually the pressures of life all those things are happening on us and we're going through all these things and we don't know why it is sometimes it may not even because it doesn't mean there's some belief in your life it doesn't mean there's sin in your life it just means that this great son is drawing you to a resurrection into a rapture i think it's a beautiful type of christian life when something is drawing you out of the world until one day you're born right into its presence by the holy spirit how beautiful if you try to help it you'll kill it if you try to take a drug if you try to take a song if you try to build a catch if you try to run to a place of comfort and peace you're running from the presence of the lord i don't want to sit there and say lord i don't want to go through birth pain i'm not mentally strong enough as it is you know i want to have some say in the matter i'll take care of this discomfort no you won't i've watched myself put it off for a month or two i got just the answer it's a vacation fly off someplace look at as much stuff as i can keep as busy as i can land at the airport and step out and grab my bag and it's all over me again vacations don't do it no there's only one thing that does it is breaking into the presence of the one that's drawing you how beautiful if you try to help it you kill it now he brings he brings another type in here like a little chicken when it's being born you know if you ever notice that little fella right at the top of this little beak or any bird that's born from an egg it's got its maturing so that's what it's doing the birth process is a maturing if it's not that where you're at it's bad it's but that he wants you to mature and in order to mature you've got to go through it what i want you to catch this morning is that in your life your daily life you'll start to have mental battles you'll start to have uh you'll notice it even in your flesh you'll notice it about your life there's a discontentment there's an unhappiness there's a dissatisfaction you can't put your finger on it you look and you see everything about my life i'm doing good i i've kept all your commandments lord but there's one thing that lacketh die to where you're at and come follow me and i don't think we realize that struggle yet i'll try to hurry but it's maturing you you understand i feel that that's been the cry of our congregation is we want to mature we want to start seeing the signs and wonders we want to start seeing the loss we want to start seeing people baptized we want to start seeing people delivered we want to start seeing the evidence of our confession so we're wanting to mature you want to mature get ready for the birth pains [Music] not just as a natural but the church is made up out of individuals so if god's going to take the church he deals with the church he deals with the world and he deals with the individual in the same manner the church has been going through births the world's going to go through a birth and each individual as it matures goes from birth to birth to birth to birth it's maturing this old egg shell the old inner part of the egg has to rot away so what's happening your very inner part is starting to wrap everything that gave you peace and comfort seems to be drying up because you've got to mature you're in the shell of your existence of your present state existence you're in the shell of that but that seed that's inside of you wants to mature it's trying to mature so the old shell the inner part of the egg has got to rot that's you that's the personal you this old eggshell and it has to take this little beak and scrape back and forth until it breaks the shell out or it breaks out of the shell we call it pippin way down in kentucky where i come from pivot's way out they haven't found a better way see why it's god's provided way it's god's provided way for you to crack the shell because if that bird don't crack that shell that eagle if it don't crack that shell it'll die in the existence that it's in because it's got to mature and the only way it can mature to fly the sky fly out of here is to break the shell that it's in no better way see it's god's provided way you try to help him you'll kill him pick the shell off of him he'll die he's got to labor and strain to break forth we don't want that part of it but that's where we are we are not going to advance as a body until each of its members starts laboring and straining to get out of their shell and this is what he says you can't ca you know it's god's provided way you don't go in in by book or shaking hands and joining pumping up or pulling down there's just it's not an outward revival it's something that's happening within you personally you just simply have to get away from the old shell notice no better way has they ever found and it it's it's the only way to get there it is it is just uh is is just to go through it listen as we just read a a another verb that's the same thing in new birth so if you're talking about a new birth you look at your life where you're at and you're going to have to leave that amen you have to break the shell whether it's the shell of comfort whether it's the shell of fellowship whether it's the shell of of the social existence that they're in which i think the kids were talking about that the other day about this social shell that they're in and this uh devil app that's 100 inspired by the devil and i believe personally this isn't the word of the lord that if you're on there you've got a spirit the one where you girls take pictures of yourself 30 pictures of yourself and you stick it for every boy to look at i saw one the other day someone brought to my attention they said come look at this this girl she's a beautiful good christian girl she's in the message she's got 415 lusters i think they call them followers if you really i want to make a rule but it's not my place to do it but if you're on there you can't come to those doors till you get born again that's how strong i feel about it don't post yourself out there for some devil let me tell you what the prophet of god said they came to a christian man and asked if they could take his daughter's picture and put it on a box of candy and he said that old guy rose up out of that chair and liked to smoke those guys saying you want to turn my daughter into a prostitute and that was on a box of candy and now we throw ourselves out their daddies you need to sit down with your girls get their phone out and find out on that if they're on that instant possession program i got off track it's the same thing with the new birth we never go back but we go forward when you're born again right so you don't go back you don't come and build a camp in an egg but you go forward so when you want to go forward you got to break that shell you've got to come out of the place you're in you've got to mature you've you gotta die to all the comfort of it all the the knowledge you've gained in it all the security you have of being in that shell but if you're gods you're going forward we go forward when you're born again and that's why i think today we have not so many rather genuine new births it's because the seed maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they're in they don't want to come out of it okay that that's what they they don't want to do they don't want to come out of it they still try to hold on to the old system the and claim it this but the old system age must die rot in order to bring forth the new one they still want to cling they they they still want to hold on to parts of it maybe you've got a certain prestige in the church and you've got a certain recognition and you've got people telling you how wonderful you are and how good you are and and everything and yeah and you you've got this nice little uh existence and this nice little system we got systems but but you're just in there and and the battle is it is you you want to cling and god wants you to have a birth and you don't want to leave where you're at like the eagle in the nest lord i'm pretty comfortable here i it took me a long time to get here finally they call me brother you know they're glad to see me in fact the world even likes me for a change and god's saying fine i gave you that i blessed you it's all of me but now son follow me sell that existence out sell that existence change where you're at change your existence again that's the battle is they want to cling we want to add instead of come out he says and and he may say he said but you see the thing of it is it's so hard for many men when they look at it and believe it and see it so identified by god in the word yet it's hard to rot away from that thing you've been in see we want to cling to it it's hard to rot away from the thing we've been in now we're not talking about denomination we're talking about where we are this morning like i said mike messi mike i'm not trying to re-preach brother branham's message but all i can do is go to it and and and have the spirit break a portion of the manna that's in there to us and bring it to whomever is hungry but not only is he talking about i'm just talking about the individual process of us moving to higher ground that it takes a birth and a go to a struggle he's talking about the church he's talking about the world he's talking about my goodness how the world wars fit in and i'm just trying to say lord i'm just trying to get up the next rung he's preached from the bottom of the ladder to the top of the ladder from genesis to revelation from before the stars were ever created all the way into eternity but lord let me eat the meal that you've put before me because if i can eat this meal and accomplish this portion of it i will take a step up the ladder and that's all i want to do i want to move from one step to another step and i don't want to clean the thing that you've been in what would i do what would i do if i left where i'm at where would my meal come from will god's your meal it's the thing you're in whether it's the state of your mind whether it's the pattern of your life the routine or your spiritual condition see they they they want to cling because they don't want to give up something you don't want to break out of an old habit so it's hard to break away it's hard not to cling that's the birth the birth and the struggle is breaking the cling is taking your hands off of what you're holding on it's the comfort you have in your mind is talk to all what you're going through i always think of what must be going through the mind of a potential bride i'm i'm going to put myself into this guy's hands i mean that mental battle must be crazy i thank god i didn't have to go through it he said this is your wife you're going to marry or whether you like it or not because she's going to try to make you better okay you know my testimony i needed that but it it's a great it's uh i to me that's just another struggle that you go through when you make that decision you've got to battle the questions in your mind you've got to come to a conclusion you weigh it out you pray about it you pray about it you cry out until you get peace you know and you got to get rid of the idea he's going to pull up in a chariot and on a white horse and you know and the slipper is going to fit so that that's what it's hard to believe he to to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all else will be added on to so it's hard to give something up so it's even hard when you want to add something to your life you go through the battle and the birth to to get come out of something you go through the birth the struggle the pain and you may some of you may find yourselves in that right now because god's trying to transform you in to more of a person a greater thing and you're trying to fit your business your job your work your wife your kid everything you're going through this great struggle but you can't help yourself because there's something drawing you out and so it's hard until you cling to old things old habits and it takes a birth to come out of the old habits but it also takes a birth to add a new habit to add something into your life where is that going to fit what's the effect that's going to have but don't you seek and i'll read this to you in a second because it it just meant so much to me but i believe with my heart that this ride to get further and closer to god to get to the rapturing condition that we need to be in there's going to be a birthing process of that church that what we felt over these years that we've been in the message we felt the draw and the pull we even sing the song do you feel the pull but now the process of birth of dying of really letting him mold our nature and our personality not clinging to the old ways some of the ways we've been taught some of the rapes we've been raised up in from other ways we've been told the truth but he wants to add a more breadth of life he wants to add deeper and greater understandings and you can help it along in other words a preacher can't give it to you by pulling by jumping by getting you to come to the altar no it's an internal struggle of the inner man maturing the dying out of the life that he's in and the breaking from the old shell into the new because the new cannot exist with the old you cannot have two laws at the same time brother branham uses a word that uh uh i don't even i can't even even say the word you know what i mean but he's he's just talking about this great maturing and this great thing he calls it like a zephora or something something to do with computers and i think my goodness it's a law of what causes one thing to act i'll show it to you some of you technological brothers you go to wikipedia and wikipedia explains it as a as some sort of a programming thing that keeps two things from existing together at the same time don't tell me bill brown couldn't skip dimensions and go into time why did i thought why did he drop that word in there he dropped that word in there so we could know that this works for us and so if if you did that then you you find out that this struggle is built in to the birth of christianity and i'm going to just finish this morning i know i guess it's been really long and you've really been patient but for those of you that come back for communion will just have communion it'll be very short but i hope this sums it up for you and speaking of the church and where we are now she's in the worst stage that according to the scriptures she's ever been we're in the lady you'll see in church age a rich blind church age that don't know it and that's why i thought it's good to understand what you're going through if god's calling you to higher ground you're going to go through a birth there wasn't nowhere in the bible that christ was ever put out of the church but the lady of cnh she's in the worst age she's in the rottenest she ever was i said i said as a queen having need of nothing and don't know that you're naked miserable blind poor and don't know it yes sir i said i counsel thee to come by eye salve from me that thou might open your eyes that will certainly the eyes have of god will certainly bring light to the church if it wants to open its eyes to what god has said this gospel this morning will bring light to you if you really want to understand what you're going to have to go through to be a higher class or i don't want to use the word class a higher matured christian notice quickly and this this is the part i just want to let set into us notice quickly now she is in that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt we're in the ladies in church age now her messenger is promised in malachi the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be the messenger was to bring you to the birth process so it burns you and you go through a birth process and then the message brings you to another birth process and another perk because it's drawing you into the presence of his rapture the birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth according to malachi 4 5. she's to be delivered another according means by the church world today is in two systems of working now listen real close i want you to see if you're going to say amen on this there is two systems working in the church today and i'm going to get this off my shoulder and then i have it over with we all know that that's the word of god and the denominational system and we talked that last week called it a what a one-man denomination it's the system within yourself the egg that you're in working just as there was jacob and esau one after the spirit the other after the flesh and what is it esau and jacob was fighting in the womb of the mother even to the time they were born the struggles within you coming out and the separation and the denominational and the word fighting one against the other they have been since luther first brought it in in reformation i hope that's simple enough that you can understand it it's that struggle that jacob and esau the world you take your religion you take your belief you're going in the world and pretty soon you take what you believe all your things and you join it to the world you're in and all of a sudden you're going to find out you've got a jacob and esau struggle going in you because that becomes a womb you're in and now he wants to break out of that womb and give you a birth and move you up well we're in such an age now we're so padded and pampered and hot house plant that we don't want to go through no struggles we don't want to leave we want to cling to what we've got we want to bring it with us wouldn't you love to get to the place that somebody without you even knowing it just said i know this brother here i'll just take you and we'll just stand and when he walks by us if his shadow touches us we'll feel the presence of god i love patrick's testimony i don't know if patrick's here but there was a brother that was backslid used to go to our church and he's on the job and patrick says i'm going to kill myself i can't stand it i can't sleep i haven't slept in days this spirit won't leave me alone i can't take it no more i'm going to kill myself and this backslid brother says you need to go talk to brother such and such over at this church so he's brought over and we talk with him and we tell him and we pray for him as i said brother when you get out in your car you just give him a so brother patrick went out in the car and there was three books sitting there and he said just pick one of these books he picked demonology so all of a sudden i see he's at church coming walking across the parking lot and i said padre i says how are you doing oh brother david i just can't sleep i read these books i just stay up all night i just can't get enough of them i just can't sleep god's blessing me so much isn't it time we start writing some testimonies in our lives we start having converts and but that's going to take a birth because that jacob and esau fight that's in us and he says there's an esau just a man of the world very religious he's all right good fellow clean moral so far as i know but he didn't know nothing about the birthright or the birth process he's born that way he's shaped that way and jacob i don't care what he is he wants that birthright he's the spiritual one that's you this morning and so i as your friend i just want you to understand that god's calling us the higher ground and it's not just a simple process of him pouring more oil on you or more rain on you he's got to kill where you are and the comfort of that place because even though you're very spiritual where you are now cannot exist at the same time with where he wants to take you so i pray father i pray for the birthright that's mine and i know it's already 12 30 but i forgot i had a baptism so what we'll do is we'll stand and be dismissed and brother billy can lead us in song and if jemima and brother john would come we're going to go baptize one but i hope this morning that at least this brings an understanding to you that when you find yourself in these great places that you will realize it's god trying to birth you and make you more than what you've ever been before do you love them this morning let's stand together god bless you brother billy thank you in your presence [Music] that's where i am strong in your praises oh lord my god go in your praises [Music] touching your grace in your presence oh when i want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me where my feet are hungry oh when i want to hide with the case of this world cannot choke me in [Music] oh that's where i am oh that's where i [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] when i want to [Music] when i want to hide where the schemes of darkness cannot touch me oh in your presence [Music] in your praise [Music] [Applause]

[Music] [Applause] oh [Music] amen god bless you you may be seated i certainly have appreciated uh kyle's testimony when he said i did my part now i'm just trusting god will do his part and sister jamina comes this morning and she said brother david you know i i i don't know what it is i i'm kind of nervous and i'm kind of and anticipation and and i thought oh there's that struggle there's that discomfort there's that birth pain but she's doing her part and that's repent everyone and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin now god's part is the promise of the holy spirit and if you do these things you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit let's read that again as we turn in the book of acts to the second chapter and the 36th verse therefore let all the house of bedford knowing assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ amen didn't he indict this generation for the second greece addicted now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and within many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up towards generation and that's what our sisters come today she's come to save herself from where this world is going and all the spirits that are in it she wants the gift of the holy ghost our sister it's our privilege to fulfill the great commission to go into the world and baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and with the keys to the kingdom that the lord gave peter peter by divine revelation knew that that name was the lord jesus and according to the promises of god's word and in accordance with keeping the word and the word of god for the hour we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] amen let's all stand this morning amen let's sing joey is the flag as our dismissal this morning [Applause] is god [Music] from the castle [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do
