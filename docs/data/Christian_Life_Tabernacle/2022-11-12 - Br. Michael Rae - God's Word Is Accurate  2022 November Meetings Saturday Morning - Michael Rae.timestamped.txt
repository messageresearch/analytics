[16:10] place Lord
[16:12] you said in your word seek ye first the
[16:14] kingdom of God
[16:15] Lord and then you would take care of
[16:17] everything else
[16:18] sometimes lord it's hard to do that with
[16:20] our finance and our giving but Lord
[16:23] you've never failed to back up your word
[16:26] it's one of the things Lord you said try
[16:28] me
[16:30] it's never failed Lord we thank you for
[16:32] your provisions
[16:33] so we pray your blessings upon it Lord
[16:36] there was no written prayer request this
[16:39] morning
[16:40] but Lord we're
[16:43] mindful of the needs that sit amongst us
[16:46] we see the uplifted hands that are
[16:48] represented
[16:51] Lord we're encouraged to know that you
[16:52] care
[16:54] so much so that while we were yet
[16:56] sinners you died for us
[16:58] before we even knew we had the need Lord
[17:00] you'd already paid the price
[17:02] before we were
[17:04] ever sick in our body you were bruised
[17:06] and you were smitten
[17:09] Lord what a confidence we have this
[17:11] morning to know that you've taken care
[17:12] of it all
[17:13] and as we heard last night Lord if that
[17:16] Spirit of unbelief can just be broken
[17:19] we sit right now in the Realms where all
[17:21] things are possible if we can just
[17:24] believe Lord
[17:25] father as the word went forth and was
[17:27] ministered the bride's moment
[17:30] Lord May that not Escape us may we
[17:32] refocus to realize this is our moment
[17:36] Lord I'm reminded of when brother Ed
[17:39] made that call to brother Ron he said
[17:42] it's my turn
[17:43] this is my turn I need a blessing I need
[17:46] a prayer I need a moment Lord that's
[17:48] captivated my thoughts Lord to realize
[17:50] that this is my turn this is my moment
[17:53] this is our hour Lord father that you
[17:56] could come and just move amongst us Lord
[17:57] and and you could minister to our hearts
[18:00] and to the needs Lord and Lord we'll be
[18:03] careful to give you all the glory all
[18:04] the honor and all the praise so we just
[18:06] commit the ministering of the word
[18:09] to you and everyone into thy hands in
[18:13] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen

[32:57] just go to the word this morning
[32:59] Heavenly this heavenly father we are so
[33:02] thankful
[33:03] that Lord we can we serve a living God
[33:06] Lord may that be such a reality this
[33:09] morning
[33:10] so many indeed serve different gods Lord
[33:13] in the times of the Bible it was Stone
[33:17] maybe some wood and clay
[33:19] and Lord so many serve their gods of
[33:21] entertainment and fashion
[33:24] so many different things but Lord we
[33:26] serve a God that can meet the needs of
[33:29] his people Lord can feel the very
[33:31] desires of our heart can heal our bodies

[33:47] with it now we invite you you Lord you
[33:50] are the welcome to guest this morning so
[33:53] we commit the word and what will be
[33:55] spoken may you take it Lord and anoint
[33:57] it we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:01] amen good morning hope you had a good
[34:03] sleep
[34:04] you're ready for a full day amen
[34:08] we all return to our Bibles thank you
[34:10] musicians
[34:11] thank you brother David for an
[34:13] opportunity to be here this morning I
[34:15] don't take it lightly
[34:17] and all to be standing at
[34:19] a Pulpit of a pastors it's a real honor
[34:22] and appreciative the McGeary family's
[34:24] been real close to our family for many
[34:26] years so we're just thankful we can be
[34:28] here
[34:29] sojourn with you and put our shoulder to
[34:31] the wheel
[34:32] amen mark 11.
[34:35] I have
[34:37] I really just wrestled to not go here
[34:39] this morning I studied for another
[34:42] direction for quite a while and was
[34:45] pushing against the wall it seemed to
[34:46] try and find a different way
[34:49] but for some reason
[34:51] this is where we're going just just uh
[34:55] maybe it's for one
[34:57] and the Lord Lord put uh
[35:01] well when the Lord threw me into
[35:04] Ministry I should say and pushed me that
[35:06] direction it was for one I said Lord for
[35:09] one I'll do it for one
[35:11] so here that's I say that every time
[35:13] lord if it's maybe just for one because
[35:15] it's worth ten thousand worlds so it's
[35:17] worth everything amen
[35:19] so
[35:20] maybe you just need to pull maybe it's I
[35:22] don't know who it's for but you pull on
[35:24] the word and may that one at least one
[35:26] Soul be a grip this morning Mark 11 11.
[35:30] very
[35:32] another familiar scripture
[35:35] and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and
[35:37] into the temple and when he looked round
[35:39] about upon all things and now the even
[35:41] tide was come he went unto Bethany with
[35:44] the twelve and on the moral when they
[35:46] were come from Bethany he was hungry and
[35:48] seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves
[35:51] he came and happily that he might find
[35:54] anything thereon and when he came to it
[35:56] he found nothing but leaves and for the
[35:59] time of figs was not yet
[36:01] Jesus answered and said unto it no man
[36:04] eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever
[36:07] and his disciples heard it
[36:09] off they went and we'll skip down verse
[36:11] 20.
[36:13] in the morning as they passed by us
[36:16] they'd some time has passed they passed
[36:18] by and they saw the Fig Tree dry it up
[36:20] from the roots
[36:22] and Peter Colin do you remembered saith
[36:24] unto him Master behold the Fig Tree
[36:25] which thou cursest is withered away
[36:29] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[36:31] have faith in God
[36:33] amen you shouldn't have been of
[36:35] revelation God had spoken
[36:38] and it was going to happen to my it's
[36:41] it's withered of course it's withered
[36:42] Peter I spoke I'm the master I'm the
[36:45] Creator and whatever I say is going to
[36:47] come to pass amen why don't we just uh
[36:50] skip a little ways back into the
[36:52] scripture of First Kings 22
[36:57] it would help us tie these together a
[36:59] little bit
[37:00] First Kings 22 34
[37:17] it's a good sound Paige is turning
[37:21] amen First Kings 22 34 says
[37:25] oh still a few pages turning
[37:28] quite a few pages turning all right we
[37:30] got there Kings Kings Chronicles
[37:31] Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah it's way back
[37:33] there
[37:34] all right verse 34 says a certain man
[37:38] drew a bow
[37:40] had a venture
[37:42] amen we'll stop it right there
[37:45] a certain man I know there's the
[37:46] remaining scripture but we'll just sit
[37:48] down and we'll get right into it that's
[37:51] it here we go you have your seats
[37:53] you're waiting for the rest
[37:56] nope we're gonna stop right there a
[37:58] certain man drew a bow that Adventure
[38:02] amen
[38:04] Adventure
[38:06] it's kind of something you just do
[38:09] we could say willy-nilly
[38:12] use that word down here no all right
[38:16] just just per chance it's gonna kind of
[38:18] throw it out there on a venture actually
[38:20] the the the definition would be kind of
[38:23] out of luck you know an event that's
[38:25] it's I can't see foresee what's going to
[38:27] happen but it's perchance that I'm gonna
[38:29] I'm gonna venture out there and and do
[38:32] such and such a thing and uh maybe to
[38:35] give you a better idea a couple examples
[38:37] that I had in my notes was anybody been
[38:39] on anybody that's gone on a journey that
[38:42] you've never been on before you have no
[38:44] clue what the the future holds about it
[38:46] anybody ever done that kind of Journey
[38:48] you're just like I'm going have no clue
[38:50] what's going to happen anybody ever do
[38:51] that yeah okay
[38:53] you're from like the old Pioneer world
[38:55] you know back in the old 1800s it's like
[38:57] I'm just heading west
[38:59] all right what's happening I don't know
[39:01] filling up the wagon and off we go he
[39:03] was a venturer going on an adventure he
[39:07] had no clue what was ahead of him it
[39:08] could have been wild beasts it could
[39:09] have been you know who knows what was
[39:11] coming ahead of him in the West in the
[39:12] old wild days but uh he just kind of
[39:15] took it for chance
[39:17] made sure he got lots of bullets in his
[39:19] gun
[39:19] and off he went on adventure into the
[39:23] unknown
[39:23] that was a venture he did now nowadays
[39:26] the current version of that is the
[39:28] venture capitalist who he's not going on
[39:31] an adventure into the unknown he's just
[39:33] throwing his money into the unknown and
[39:35] so he just says well I can't do it but
[39:37] my money can and so he throws it out
[39:39] there to do whatever he thinks it can
[39:41] happen high risk High Gain and so he's
[39:45] he throws his money so he's on a venture
[39:47] to hopefully capitalize on something
[39:49] that's going to give him some gain right
[39:51] so it's it's just kind of like yeah
[39:53] maybe okay so unless you have lots of
[39:55] money I suggest you don't do that right
[39:58] unless it's burning there and you have a
[39:59] hundred grand to do absolutely Zippo you
[40:01] have nothing better to do then and only
[40:03] then be the venture capitalist all right
[40:06] because there's high possibility that
[40:08] it's going nowhere
[40:10] it's high risk and so that not
[40:12] everybody's like that though most
[40:14] probably most people most people are not
[40:16] quite like that mostly because they
[40:18] don't have the deep pocket not because
[40:20] they don't like the risk so but there
[40:23] are people that don't they don't like
[40:24] Risk they they shy back from that and
[40:27] they hesitate maybe they they take kind
[40:29] of the the more
[40:31] reserved route you know and there's the
[40:33] they they like to plan or it's maybe
[40:36] that middle ground Zone they're bounced
[40:38] you know a little bit of risk a little
[40:40] bit of conservative you know aspect but
[40:41] but there's people that uh that they
[40:45] have no they have no desire for risk
[40:47] they have no desire for the unknown they
[40:50] hate the unknown and they want
[40:52] everything to be very precise and very
[40:54] you know very
[40:55] um planned out for them and and so those
[40:59] are those are people that that can be
[41:00] what we would maybe call a perfectionist
[41:02] that they they they they plan it all
[41:05] exactly how they want something to come
[41:08] out you know it's accurate it's it's
[41:10] thought out and they to get there and
[41:12] they're driven to ensure that it becomes
[41:15] exactly what's in their mind right
[41:16] that's the perfectionist anybody know
[41:19] anybody like that
[41:23] you chuckle
[41:24] they're important people you know
[41:27] because they get things done
[41:29] I know it can be frustrating sometimes
[41:31] but there it's good it's a good trade if
[41:34] you can work through the other parts of
[41:35] those of the other side of it you know
[41:37] but uh and and I get it because we all
[41:41] maybe even have some a little bit of
[41:42] that in us you know there's certain
[41:43] areas that we like to we're driven to
[41:45] make sure it's done right but some
[41:46] people are just that's all that consumes
[41:48] them I told uh when I if I look it up
[41:51] the the probably the highest highest uh
[41:55] perfectionist comes up on any Google any
[41:57] Google search for Perfections it does
[41:58] come up at Steve Jobs unfortunately
[42:00] that's who it is that comes up as a
[42:02] perfectionist heavy duty perfectionist
[42:03] but he drove people insane in his work
[42:05] because he was still driven it had to be
[42:07] so exact you know and I mean good grief
[42:09] if you've ever seen any of their uh any
[42:11] of the Apple Keynotes I mean just even
[42:13] how they describe things it's like dear
[42:15] goodness how many adjectives can you
[42:16] throw into a presentation because it's
[42:19] just perfection you know the metal the
[42:21] curve the cuts you know the fine tuning
[42:23] of it all and they're driven to ensure
[42:25] it's exactly what was in his mind
[42:28] is on the screen and so he's got
[42:30] thousands and thousands of people all
[42:32] moving in the right direction to make
[42:34] sure that that iPhone or iPad or airpod
[42:36] or something is exactly what it was in
[42:39] his brain mind you the airport wasn't
[42:41] there he was he died long before that
[42:43] so scratch that one from the record
[42:47] if I go to the let's no so every
[42:51] every brain of maybe what they're trying
[42:53] to to achieve and so they they put
[42:56] something there something's formulated
[42:57] and even brought now they have a little
[43:00] bit of a competition and so uh if you
[43:02] can put the first slide on the screen
[43:03] and I guess then I can use my arrows
[43:05] here
[43:08] do I click it there we go so he he was
[43:12] an image that was placed before somebody
[43:14] they said here make this and they're
[43:17] like all right you know here was
[43:19] perfection
[43:20] that was Perfection on my left on your
[43:23] yes yours as well and uh but whoever was
[43:25] attempting it they didn't it didn't
[43:28] quite manifest into the into the way
[43:30] that they were Desiring it to to happen
[43:32] and so it just didn't it didn't come to
[43:34] pass and uh again another another image
[43:38] was put not even an image actually the
[43:40] actual uh reality was placed in front of
[43:43] a in front of somebody and they said
[43:45] okay I'll go for it I'm gonna I'm gonna
[43:47] hit it I'm gonna hit the mark
[43:50] um and they attempted it
[43:52] and they didn't even I don't think they
[43:54] I think they're 100 miles from the mark
[43:57] same thing Mr Scrooge was placed in
[43:59] front of them actually if back to back
[44:00] Scrooge and and he was he was put in
[44:03] front of the front of the uh the masters
[44:05] of the cake and uh and they attempted to
[44:08] bring to reality what was in front of
[44:11] them
[44:12] not a perfectionist didn't nail it one
[44:16] bit that they just they missed the mark
[44:18] did they not
[44:19] now
[44:22] foreign
[44:27] and be very accurate which they were not
[44:30] in these last few slides they were far
[44:32] from accurate or even precise and and
[44:35] accurate and precise are trying to
[44:36] achieve that they're actually very
[44:38] different uh very different words you
[44:40] might use them we use them synonymous
[44:42] but they're very different any school
[44:43] teachers here I know I know there's at
[44:45] least one
[44:49] his sister Amy Johnson or was this Jamie
[44:51] Johnson here
[44:53] he's here a teacher fantastic so I'm
[44:57] going to help any students that are in
[44:58] here on accurate and precise in science
[45:00] because accuracy refers to how close a
[45:03] measurement is to the true or actual
[45:05] Target you learned this in science in
[45:07] high school it's very important as you
[45:09] get into a into you know your your
[45:11] experiments and such so students listen
[45:12] pretty closely accuracy how close the
[45:15] measurement is to the true actual Target
[45:17] value Precision is different Precision
[45:20] refers to how close measurements are to
[45:22] the same or to each other okay so you
[45:25] can be extremely precise and so we're
[45:27] going to show you we're going to say
[45:28] here someone low accuracy low Precision
[45:31] all over the map boom boom boom boom
[45:34] they got they're not accurate whatsoever
[45:36] but and they're not precise whatsoever
[45:39] either
[45:39] the next person threw some Arizona
[45:41] Target he was super precise he was all
[45:44] his arrows I mean he was a ProMaster at
[45:46] not hitting the target he was way off
[45:49] Target but he was dead precise okay so
[45:51] that's precise for you
[45:53] high accuracy is I'm I'm throwing it and
[45:56] I'm in the zone I'm I'm kind of there so
[45:59] I'm accurate but I'm not all there I'm
[46:02] not precise I'm just accurate okay but
[46:05] the last and final he's highly accurate
[46:08] and high Precision okay so he's he's
[46:11] right on the target every time and his
[46:14] grouping is is perfect amen not quite
[46:16] splitting arrows but he's perfect and
[46:18] then God's word just to give you
[46:21] visualization God's word isn't the first
[46:23] one it's not the second one nor is it
[46:26] even the third one it is the fourth one
[46:28] it is always highly accurate highly
[46:31] precise right to the Target every time
[46:34] in fact God's word splits arrows
[46:41] now
[46:43] the devil
[46:44] he he he's he even creates a whole lot
[46:47] of targets he wants you to feel like
[46:49] you've nailed it all the time in fact
[46:51] those cake people that's what they're
[46:53] supposed to do they're supposed to nail
[46:54] it brother Matthew they're supposed to
[46:56] nail it and they did not nail it but the
[46:58] devil he wants you to he wants you to to
[47:00] try and Achieve or make you feel like
[47:02] you you've nailed it and so he's he's
[47:04] always constantly uh putting up targets
[47:07] for you or making you feel in humanity
[47:09] what you're supposed to attain and so
[47:11] there's a pressure to attain what the
[47:13] current social uh you know aspect is or
[47:16] the current economics or the current
[47:17] culture that you're trying to attain
[47:19] something here's the target reach for it
[47:21] you know this and you compare yourself
[47:23] am I am I hitting the target you know
[47:25] and it's a terrible thing because if
[47:27] you're trying to shoot at the devil's
[47:28] Target you're off Target way off Target
[47:31] right we don't we don't judge ourselves
[47:33] and balance ourselves by what the world
[47:35] is doing because the world is slowly not
[47:38] slowly very quickly going farther and
[47:40] farther away and if you're trying to say
[47:42] well I'm still quite a bit of a distance
[47:44] is off off that I mean I'm a good look
[47:46] at what they're doing what I'm doing and
[47:48] you just slowly kind of move and keep
[47:50] this this parameter away from the world
[47:52] you have moved yourself because the
[47:55] world the devil is moving the target all
[47:57] the time moving Target
[48:02] we live in Changing Times
[48:05] things have changed they're constantly
[48:06] changing what you can say is changing
[48:09] but you could say 20 years ago you can't
[48:11] say now
[48:13] it's like my brother went and went to he
[48:15] was in a business meeting and they gave
[48:16] him this honkins honking slide of words
[48:18] you can't say no more
[48:20] it's like wow you know because it
[48:23] changes the world is changing and so you
[48:26] can see so sometimes when you have even
[48:28] because some you have an image in your
[48:30] mind of what you're trying to achieve
[48:32] time and pressures and the world changes
[48:35] that over time I'll give you an example
[48:38] last slide
[48:40] is it still active
[48:42] this was a self-portrait
[48:45] of Picasso painted of himself at age 15.
[48:49] this is what his image was and he he
[48:51] would have looked at himself somehow and
[48:53] Drew a self-porch and said yeah I nailed
[48:56] it that's me it's exactly who I am then
[48:59] he did that at 18 and he was you know
[49:02] got a little older and so he did another
[49:04] self-portrait and he started to to to
[49:06] you know that's exactly what I look like
[49:08] and so as he worked his way older and
[49:12] older oh something happened there we go
[49:16] 20 years old 25 he was nailing it every
[49:20] time 56
[49:22] 83
[49:24] 99
[49:26] years old
[49:28] that's me that's exactly what I look
[49:30] like poor Picasso His image of what he
[49:34] thought it was was changing he thought
[49:36] he was hitting the target it's like yeah
[49:38] that's that's what I look like sorry
[49:39] Picasso you did not look this way at 90
[49:42] years old
[49:44] terrible but that's what he thought
[49:47] he thought he was high precision and
[49:49] high accuracy on his self-portrait poor
[49:52] Picasso and so it changes over time all
[49:56] right thank you builders for the slides
[49:57] just to give you a little bit of a
[49:59] little bit of help there this morning
[50:02] so what I'm saying is don't line
[50:03] yourself with the trajectory of the
[50:06] world because it's changing the
[50:08] trajectory is is way off don't match up
[50:10] it's only the word of God that is going
[50:13] to be unchanging I am God and I change
[50:16] not that's what we want to align with
[50:18] amen
[50:20] better brother Brian says when you see
[50:22] when you start wrong you just keep going
[50:24] on wrong right if we're you're off
[50:27] Target at the beginning you're going to
[50:28] be way off Target at the end we ought to
[50:30] ensure that we're dead on high Precision
[50:32] high accuracy on our life Joy lined up
[50:35] with the word or way off brother says if
[50:38] a bullet supposed to be directed to a
[50:40] Target and you just jerk that Barrel one
[50:42] one thousands off he says you're at 100
[50:46] yards you're four or five inches off
[50:48] you've missed the target actually
[50:50] you would have missed the bullseye right
[50:52] just by that one little bit one man says
[50:55] and so you actually need to count the
[50:58] cost of a decision count the cost of
[51:00] what what's the consequence am I am I
[51:03] dead on Target when I when you're
[51:05] looking at charting the course of your
[51:07] life uh one person said the best math
[51:09] you can learn is how to calculate the
[51:12] future cost of current decisions
[51:15] think about that you could learn two
[51:17] plus two it might do you some good you
[51:19] might learn quadratic equations might
[51:21] you do might do most of you not good
[51:23] because you'll never use it again but
[51:25] the best math he said is you can learn
[51:27] is how to calculate the future cost
[51:31] future cost of current decisions a
[51:35] decision you're setting a course you're
[51:37] setting a trajectory for the next five
[51:39] years the next seven years are you right
[51:41] on target
[51:43] very vital very vital
[51:47] but I'll tell you the word of God it
[51:49] never veers off course it never goes off
[51:51] Target it don't matter what happens come
[51:54] what may it's never haphazard neither
[51:56] it's not as the scripture says a certain
[51:58] man on a venture threw an arrow out
[52:01] there so we're going to go into that
[52:02] list a little bit First Kings 22 it says
[52:05] and it came to pass when the captains of
[52:07] the Chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they
[52:10] said surely it is the king of Israel and
[52:12] they turned aside to fight against him
[52:14] and Jehoshaphat cried out now let's just
[52:17] give you some a little bit of background
[52:18] to the story this is Jehoshaphat joined
[52:21] himself up with Ahab Ahab said please I
[52:23] need you to fight with me Jehoshaphat
[52:24] says absolutely my horses are yours my
[52:27] chariots are yours here I am bad move he
[52:30] didn't learn the math of your decisions
[52:32] and the consequences of it Jehoshaphat
[52:34] should not have been doing that but here
[52:35] he was because Ahab was in it was in a
[52:37] position that he didn't know of Ahab
[52:39] thought hey we should go up to Raymond
[52:41] Gilead it's our land God's given it to
[52:43] us so here we go Jehoshaphat says yeah
[52:45] we're God's people he says our this is
[52:47] our possession and so they decided to
[52:50] make this this joint effort in battle
[52:54] the prophets speak to saying yes it's
[52:56] it's yours Micaiah comes and he says I
[52:59] don't I don't see this happening and we
[53:00] can go in the back story of that and so
[53:03] here through all of that Jehoshaphat now
[53:05] is in battle Ahab has said Jehoshaphat
[53:07] uh you know what you go looking like a
[53:10] king I'm gonna disguise myself and not
[53:12] look like a king to me that would have
[53:14] been surely the first thing that said
[53:16] what's up with that why am I going
[53:19] looking like the hot spot and you're
[53:20] going in looking disguise it should have
[53:22] been really it should have been a red
[53:25] flag waving in the middle of the air but
[53:27] Jehoshaphat says sir okay I'll do that
[53:29] and so off he goes and that's why he was
[53:31] he was sought after all the all the 35
[53:34] or so chariots from the I think the
[53:36] syrians or such were saying hey that's
[53:38] uh that's the king go and get him
[53:40] jehoshaphats he's going around in his
[53:42] Chariot and he cries out and he says oh
[53:45] my Joe Hasselbeck cries out and it says
[53:47] the next verse that came to pass when
[53:48] the captains of the Chariots perceived
[53:49] that it was not the king of Israel that
[53:51] they turned back from pursuing him and
[53:53] so this was this is a good thing he said
[53:55] they're off my back and so the next
[53:58] scripture which she read and a certain
[54:00] man drew a bow at a venture he drew a
[54:04] bullet Adventure here's a man that is in
[54:06] battle he's he is in the thick of it
[54:09] there's there's people fighting all
[54:10] around him swords and Spears are
[54:11] clanging and clashing the din of war is
[54:14] there there's cries and and people are
[54:16] crying and dying and it's terrible
[54:18] terrible Time battle would have been as
[54:20] you're all around I mean you're just
[54:21] trying to stay alive and so somehow this
[54:23] fellow got maybe a breath at least he
[54:26] had some space and he's like man I
[54:28] should just throw an arrow in the air I
[54:30] should just maybe just for good for good
[54:33] luck here throw an arrow up there
[54:35] because that's what it says a certain
[54:36] man drew a bow at a venture and so hey
[54:40] there's nobody around me and he's got
[54:42] the bow you know only certain people had
[54:43] the bow so he throws the bow up notches
[54:46] and arrow kind of wings it out there
[54:48] he's like yeah wow
[54:50] yeah why not let's just throw an arrow
[54:52] out there you never know what could
[54:54] happen and so he here he is in the Roar
[54:56] of battle throwing out there and throws
[54:59] a a an arrow out there he you know he
[55:02] didn't have any uh perceived conception
[55:04] was going to happen he was hoping hoping
[55:07] his Arrow would hit a mark somewhere
[55:09] okay
[55:10] follow and officero went
[55:13] it just starts to go who knows he could
[55:15] have gone straight up he could have gone
[55:16] like this I know what his trajectory was
[55:18] but just at Adventure he threw it out
[55:21] there okay make it happen
[55:23] so now this arrow is it's cruising
[55:25] through the air we have to we have to
[55:28] think and sit back a little bit into
[55:31] First Kings and go where the word of the
[55:33] Lord came to Elijah and it said arise
[55:36] and go down and meet Ahab king of Israel
[55:39] which is in Samaria he said behold he is
[55:42] in the vineyard of naboth the arrows in
[55:44] the air think about it now any now we're
[55:47] going to go back hang that there he said
[55:49] he's in the vineyard of naboth with her
[55:50] he's gone down to possess it and thou
[55:53] shalt speak to him saying thus saith the
[55:56] Lord hast thou killed and taken
[55:58] possession and thou shalt speak in him
[56:00] saying thus saith the Lord in the place
[56:03] where the dogs lick the blood of
[56:05] neighbors shall dogs lick thy blood even
[56:08] thine this is what a prophet spoke to
[56:13] Ahab all right Ahab oh my goodness he
[56:16] took that he actually rented his clothes
[56:18] and he walked as the scripture says
[56:20] softly I don't really care how softly he
[56:22] walked the word of the Lord had been
[56:24] spoken Ahab the dogs are going to lick
[56:27] your blood walk as Softly As you want so
[56:30] he don't know where that's going to
[56:31] happen so he disguises himself in battle
[56:34] I don't know if it's Weighing on the
[56:35] back of his mind he's saying this is a
[56:36] dodgy place I don't want to be the the
[56:38] prime the prime target so I'm going to
[56:40] disguise myself it could and just try
[56:42] and you know keep keeping the back I'm
[56:44] sure that that kept there in the back of
[56:47] ahab's mind all the time the dogs are
[56:49] going to lick your blood Ahab dog's
[56:50] gonna lick your bloody hell
[56:54] and a certain Archer
[56:59] good luck on adventure through an arrow
[57:02] out into the air
[57:04] and the word of God that had been spoken
[57:07] just a few years before was hanging out
[57:10] in the air as well because it had gone
[57:12] out from the mouth of a prophet and
[57:15] grabbed a hold of the arrow I don't know
[57:17] what that fella was singing but it was
[57:19] on a venture but the word of God is
[57:21] never on adventure it's gonna go out and
[57:23] get his Target exactly high accuracy
[57:26] High precision and it took a hold of the
[57:29] arrow from adventurous Avengers booming
[57:32] and took the arrow and said uh-huh
[57:34] you're going exactly where I intended it
[57:36] which is right into these straps of Ahab
[57:39] which is exactly where it went
[57:43] hey man
[57:45] you ain't gonna try you're not gonna
[57:47] defeat or or the word of God gonna go
[57:51] off course if it was spoken it will
[57:53] happen
[57:55] in the air the poor Archer not poor
[57:57] Archer the Archer he had no idea the
[57:59] prophecy was there he didn't know he's
[58:02] like well I'll just throw an arrow
[58:04] that's all he was thinking not knowing
[58:07] that the word of God had been spoken and
[58:09] it was going to take that arrow and make
[58:11] sure just like it took a stone and made
[58:14] sure it landed in the exact spot it had
[58:16] to to drop a giant
[58:21] amen and it smote the king of Israel
[58:24] between the joints of the harness
[58:26] wherefore he said unto the driver of his
[58:28] Chariot oh turn my hand and Carry Me Out
[58:30] of the host so he's wounded for I'm
[58:33] wounded and the battle increase and the
[58:35] King stayed up in the Chariot against
[58:36] the syrians and he died at even and the
[58:39] blood ran out of the wound into the
[58:41] midst of The Chariot think about it
[58:42] think about it
[58:44] God's word don't venture
[58:47] the prophecy was spoken
[58:49] the arrow flap hits its Mark and now the
[58:53] word of God starts to unfold it was no
[58:55] Venture and here now their Proclamation
[58:58] went out the sun went down every man to
[59:01] his City the king died and brought to
[59:02] Samaria and the King died and was
[59:04] brought to Samaria they buried him there
[59:06] and one washed the Chariot in the pool
[59:08] of Samaria and he's starting to throw
[59:11] the bucket of water on the chair and
[59:13] started washing it out and little did he
[59:15] know God's arrows
[59:17] are nailing the Target because his word
[59:20] was spoken that Ahab the dogs are going
[59:23] to lick that and here just in fellow
[59:25] just
[59:26] just just washing out the chair but
[59:28] God's word is coming to pass exactly how
[59:31] it was decreed
[59:38] how much more
[59:40] if this was just a simple little Bowman
[59:44] out in a battle and he took his little
[59:47] simple bow and threw an arrow in the air
[59:50] just per chance how much more a son or
[59:54] daughter of God that has the word of God
[59:57] inside of them you say well I'm just
[59:59] simply I'm just going to come down I'm
[1:00:01] just going to get on my knees this
[1:00:02] morning maybe I'm just going to say a
[1:00:03] simple prayer to God maybe I'm just
[1:00:05] going to sing out a song you know I'm
[1:00:07] not really putting all of it into it but
[1:00:09] just I'm just going to sing it there how
[1:00:11] much more
[1:00:12] on adventure even his Arrow met the
[1:00:16] target how much more would your target
[1:00:17] how much more would the word in your
[1:00:19] mouth didn't hit the target
[1:00:23] you got a bow
[1:00:25] you got a bow use it
[1:00:29] send forth an object
[1:00:31] of Destruction
[1:00:34] to the enemy put the word on your lips
[1:00:37] it will land on its Target the word of
[1:00:40] God can just be like way over here way
[1:00:43] over there it's exact every time put it
[1:00:45] on your lips and may you be a Bowman but
[1:00:48] not on adventure
[1:00:52] God don't venture
[1:00:54] never will
[1:01:00] sometimes I wonder
[1:01:02] if you know that Soldier he didn't know
[1:01:04] his I don't think I think he probably
[1:01:06] died he might have died he might have
[1:01:08] gone home he had no clue what his Arrow
[1:01:10] did he had no idea that just it flew in
[1:01:14] the air and it actually was bringing the
[1:01:15] word of God to pass that a prophet had
[1:01:18] spoke
[1:01:18] he had no idea
[1:01:20] how often maybe you don't know that you
[1:01:23] came up and you sang a song and it just
[1:01:25] ministered and an arrow struck someone's
[1:01:28] Soul you had no idea you go home and
[1:01:30] like ah I bombed that verse no but
[1:01:33] actually something happened in the
[1:01:35] Eternal realm you came up and you said a
[1:01:37] prayer or a minister came up and said a
[1:01:38] word he goes home oh man I just didn't
[1:01:41] feel like I really really got got what
[1:01:43] was on my heart across but no he doesn't
[1:01:45] know that it actually reached the soul
[1:01:47] it reached the heart of a son or
[1:01:48] daughter of God the heroine in the air
[1:01:50] God's word doesn't venture
[1:01:54] amen thank you man
[1:01:58] scripture says so shall my word that go
[1:02:01] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:02:04] return unto me void but it shall
[1:02:06] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:02:09] shall prosper in the thing where unto I
[1:02:12] sent it
[1:02:13] amen so God's word is never going to
[1:02:15] return void yeah I'm sorry but if you're
[1:02:18] on if you're putting the word on your
[1:02:19] heart and your your heart is pure and
[1:02:21] you're singing a love song to Jesus
[1:02:23] you're Desiring to be a blessing to
[1:02:25] somebody it's not going to return void
[1:02:27] unto God
[1:02:28] not ever
[1:02:33] you know
[1:02:35] God's word
[1:02:38] God's word is extremely long range
[1:02:41] I love how long-range God's word is amen
[1:02:46] long-range weapons are a big deal
[1:02:48] I don't know if you know that recently
[1:02:50] but you know everybody's concerned about
[1:02:52] long-range weapons them the
[1:02:54] Intercontinental ballistics everybody's
[1:02:56] worried about the nuclear you know these
[1:02:58] bombs can reach me because these are
[1:02:59] long range and they're wanting to make
[1:03:01] sure that it's super accurate because
[1:03:02] they don't want to send off a nuke and
[1:03:04] be like oops it hit California instead
[1:03:07] of New York or you know vice versa they
[1:03:10] that'd be brutal and so they they ensure
[1:03:12] that it can be they can drop it straight
[1:03:15] on top of a little teeny building and
[1:03:16] they'd be exactly where that needs to
[1:03:18] land
[1:03:19] all right okay and if it gets out of
[1:03:22] line or out of trajectory that also is a
[1:03:24] problem as we talked in the beginning
[1:03:26] now and just to give an idea in Nassau
[1:03:29] they're shooting off some some uh
[1:03:31] Rockets up to the Moon to go and see the
[1:03:34] moon they want to look at it before they
[1:03:36] try and send somebody up there pretty
[1:03:37] good move to make sure that you know all
[1:03:39] the checks and balances are out there
[1:03:40] but before they throw a body but they
[1:03:42] have so many instruments that ensure the
[1:03:45] trajectory doesn't shift it actually
[1:03:48] circulates around the Moon they take the
[1:03:50] gravitational pull of the earth it does
[1:03:51] almost like this figure eight business
[1:03:53] going around in their in their planning
[1:03:55] and it's constantly shifting because
[1:03:57] it's it's getting adjusted by the by the
[1:04:00] you know the atmospheres and such to
[1:04:02] make sure it doesn't move off course
[1:04:04] God's word is so long range and never
[1:04:07] needs an adjustment of its trajectory
[1:04:10] what he said at the beginning is going
[1:04:12] to be all the way to the end he doesn't
[1:04:13] be like oh oops that was a little off I
[1:04:15] got to adjust that a little bit that's
[1:04:16] not how God's word works
[1:04:19] but man is always desired to make sure
[1:04:22] that they got some some long-range
[1:04:23] aspects in fact I did some looking up
[1:04:26] you know because I tell you I'll tell a
[1:04:28] story of myself I was hunting one time
[1:04:30] and I shot at a at a moose and it was
[1:04:34] not that far from me it was like 150
[1:04:36] plus yards maybe 175 Max man I was it
[1:04:40] just wasn't going down
[1:04:41] and I'm like man I missed him I was so
[1:04:44] upset I said I ain't going hunting again
[1:04:46] until I'm a sniper period so it happened
[1:04:51] I'm going to be able to shoot 700 800
[1:04:53] 000 yards shot and it don't really
[1:04:54] matter how far that moose is I'm nailing
[1:04:56] them done and I hung up that gun I
[1:05:00] haven't shot it again
[1:05:03] I'm not a sniper yet neither
[1:05:04] but you know you can actually get a
[1:05:07] scope
[1:05:08] go onto a certain gun and it actually
[1:05:11] you don't have to be a sniper you don't
[1:05:13] have to go through the training you
[1:05:14] don't have to do Zippo because people
[1:05:16] desire long range without all the effort
[1:05:19] and so you can actually just hit a
[1:05:22] button and put a dot on something you
[1:05:24] don't have to have any training first
[1:05:26] shot you just put it on the target you
[1:05:28] hit a button and then all you do is pull
[1:05:30] the trigger and and wait till the the
[1:05:32] Red Dot lands on that spot you marked
[1:05:34] and it'll then initiate the bullet and
[1:05:37] and it's already computed all of the
[1:05:39] issues in the wind and all the stuff
[1:05:41] that you got to deal with and make sure
[1:05:43] it hits it just just like that yeah it
[1:05:46] costs a whole ton of money but it's
[1:05:48] there
[1:05:49] it's there out of my range so I'm not
[1:05:51] hunting with it in the next short time
[1:05:53] ever actually ever but it's there
[1:05:55] because because man desires to have a
[1:05:57] long-range accuracy without but it's
[1:06:00] it's a lot of work but God don't need
[1:06:02] that he don't need no scope on his word
[1:06:04] to be like ah you know how do I get
[1:06:06] there and I need all these different
[1:06:07] factors it's high accuracy High
[1:06:09] Precision every time
[1:06:12] but sometimes it's so long range that
[1:06:16] we're wondering is it even there it's
[1:06:18] flying but you're like wow is it really
[1:06:21] happening for me
[1:06:23] Eve was there he was there brother Brown
[1:06:25] said she couldn't she she wouldn't wait
[1:06:27] she didn't have patience to wait for the
[1:06:30] spoken word to fulfill its promise to
[1:06:32] create a word seed
[1:06:34] Eve couldn't wait it was out there
[1:06:37] now he says you see the seed that she
[1:06:39] was holding and would have finally
[1:06:41] become a mother by the will of God
[1:06:44] through his spoken word
[1:06:46] she would have finally become a mother
[1:06:47] but she couldn't wait
[1:06:50] foreign
[1:06:52] God might have spoken something
[1:06:54] it knew he has something in plan for you
[1:06:56] you just need to wait sometimes it's
[1:06:59] coming to pass but she got impatient and
[1:07:02] disbelieved the word of God and didn't
[1:07:04] wait long enough brother Brown says
[1:07:05] that's what Christ found he's speaking
[1:07:07] about Adam and found he said he couldn't
[1:07:09] wait he said that's the matter with the
[1:07:11] people today they can't wait for the
[1:07:12] really real Holy Spirit to take the
[1:07:14] church in possession and they're trying
[1:07:16] to manufacture something individual
[1:07:18] initial evidence speaking in tongues get
[1:07:20] more members in the church and he said
[1:07:22] all this Tommy rot instead of waiting
[1:07:24] upon the Lord for the real manifestation
[1:07:26] of the resurrection of Christ making
[1:07:28] himself known among the people and this
[1:07:31] is what Eve did she did not he said what
[1:07:33] did she do she went out became pregnant
[1:07:35] with denominationalism first was
[1:07:37] Assemblies of God then a Oneness then
[1:07:39] came what more after that the so-called
[1:07:42] bride is pregnated with all kinds of
[1:07:43] Tommy rot disgrace because they couldn't
[1:07:46] wait for the real manifestation of God
[1:07:48] to come into the church and so this is
[1:07:51] Brother Brown typing it to Eve
[1:07:53] and here Eve at the beginning the
[1:07:56] serpent came in he started to speak a
[1:07:58] different word from what God had spoken
[1:08:01] you know he was pretty pretty precise in
[1:08:04] what he wanted to say you know he was he
[1:08:06] was he was calculated
[1:08:09] even maybe through a couple arrows
[1:08:10] fairly On Target talking to her but you
[1:08:14] know it sounded right God said to
[1:08:16] multiply and replenish the Earth you
[1:08:18] know you have a body that was given to
[1:08:20] do that you were made for this but he so
[1:08:23] he started to throw some things in there
[1:08:25] but then he threw in one Arrow so far
[1:08:29] off Target but you shall surely not die
[1:08:33] and so isn't that just how Satan can
[1:08:35] work he can throw a lot of different
[1:08:37] reasoning at you like well that kind of
[1:08:39] sounds about writer you know that kind
[1:08:40] of sounds but he's gonna throw in a
[1:08:42] Zinger always it's going to be offward
[1:08:44] and you've got to be waiting for that
[1:08:46] aspect because that's the devil's tactic
[1:08:48] get enough we're like well that kind of
[1:08:50] sounds about there but it's not all
[1:08:52] there it's not all high accuracy all
[1:08:55] high precision
[1:08:57] what happened to Eve hybrid it she bred
[1:09:00] it what did it do it turned to death now
[1:09:03] here it stays the word just the same
[1:09:05] here's the word laying there just the
[1:09:06] same he says now what happened he says
[1:09:08] here's the word God spoke to multiply
[1:09:11] and replenish the Earth he says but it
[1:09:14] couldn't find a place to land God spoke
[1:09:18] it
[1:09:19] and it's like oh man there's nowhere for
[1:09:22] it to land oh there's no target well
[1:09:24] let's take that out of the air God spoke
[1:09:27] it it will come to pass there's no way
[1:09:30] it's going to just just lay there and
[1:09:32] fall off in the out of the atmospheres
[1:09:34] he said so it was sitting there finding
[1:09:37] a place to land god knew
[1:09:39] exactly where it was going and so it was
[1:09:42] sitting there waiting because it's long
[1:09:45] range it's far out it wasn't just right
[1:09:48] there years now had to transverse of
[1:09:51] time as that word went forth and that
[1:09:53] Arrow not drones like yeah way out there
[1:09:56] no God had high Precision he drew that
[1:09:58] word back and let her fly and said oh
[1:10:01] that's okay I got the longest Rings
[1:10:03] known to man outside of all the manly
[1:10:06] man thoughts and he just let that Arrow
[1:10:08] fly and it started to go Abraham into
[1:10:11] Moses and all through the generations
[1:10:13] through the prophets of Jeremiah and
[1:10:16] Isaiah
[1:10:17] it just kept sailing it didn't need any
[1:10:20] work to deviate it back on the line oh
[1:10:22] that's just off course a little bit no
[1:10:23] it just kept going exactly the way he
[1:10:25] said it at the beginning and it just
[1:10:27] started sailing
[1:10:29] butter Brenham says finally
[1:10:32] finally this word caught in the womb of
[1:10:36] a virgin caught in the womb of somebody
[1:10:38] and says I'm going to believe it all
[1:10:40] it's exactly what God Said Isaiah spoken
[1:10:43] a virgin shall conceive and she held
[1:10:46] that in her heart and there the word of
[1:10:47] God went and then finally what
[1:10:50] Gabriel showed up and he spoke to Mary
[1:10:53] says there are handmaiden blessed are
[1:10:57] you highly favored among women and there
[1:11:00] she is oh she's hearing the Angels speak
[1:11:02] to her the words of what had been spoken
[1:11:04] what had been in God's mind from the
[1:11:06] very beginning of time and here she's
[1:11:07] like uh-huh well how can this be it
[1:11:09] wasn't doubting how can this be that you
[1:11:12] shall conceive of the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:14] she's just saying oh be it unto me
[1:11:15] according to Thy word it's because it
[1:11:18] caught in the womb of a sense the
[1:11:20] daughter of God a seed of God he says I
[1:11:22] don't just believe none of that and the
[1:11:24] arrow of God's word came and smoothed
[1:11:27] her
[1:11:29] and caught in her womb
[1:11:31] he said but a virgin born brother
[1:11:33] Branham says not a hybrid he says now
[1:11:36] through this I'm giving this life that
[1:11:39] if that if you by faith accept what the
[1:11:42] father all the prophets all the word of
[1:11:44] God I'll pour this life down upon you
[1:11:47] and you you can't do nothing else but
[1:11:49] produce the same thing that I am amen
[1:11:52] that was the beginning of creation
[1:11:54] because God his life he put his life
[1:11:57] into a womb and says okay this is the
[1:11:59] beginning this is what I had in my mind
[1:12:01] I spoke it and I was waiting for a seed
[1:12:04] to believe my word
[1:12:07] yeah
[1:12:09] and he said that bride is going to be in
[1:12:11] my likeness
[1:12:13] and receive what Eve did not
[1:12:19] Abraham says but the word of God has
[1:12:20] been sowed and when the spirit of God
[1:12:22] begins to fall the word of God will live
[1:12:24] in the people and that false bride he
[1:12:27] said is committed adultery out there
[1:12:28] brought herself into Creed sold her
[1:12:30] birth bright birth rights and will reap
[1:12:32] what he said a confederation of churches
[1:12:34] he says but where the word has been
[1:12:36] sowed into the people's heart amen where
[1:12:39] the word has been sowed it wasn't on
[1:12:41] adventure God's not well I hope I've got
[1:12:43] a bride out there I hope someone's going
[1:12:45] to believe my word no he threw an arrow
[1:12:47] every single time he says I know exactly
[1:12:49] where there's going to be a bride I know
[1:12:51] exactly where there's going to be a soul
[1:12:52] he says and then when it will reap a
[1:12:55] bride of Christ as certain as I'm
[1:12:58] standing here he says end time sign
[1:13:02] amen it's an arrow not a no Venture
[1:13:06] threw it out there he knew exactly where
[1:13:08] you are he knew that you'd be walking
[1:13:09] here right today he knew that you'd
[1:13:12] receive his word right today and so he
[1:13:14] threw an arrow out
[1:13:15] billions and billions and billions of
[1:13:17] years ago before the foundation of time
[1:13:19] he says I know I know there's going to
[1:13:21] be a Son of God and I'm going to throw
[1:13:23] my arrow because there's going to be an
[1:13:24] ordained moment that you're here on this
[1:13:27] Earth and what nail dudes whoa
[1:13:30] what happened
[1:13:32] it's called eternity struck you because
[1:13:35] you were he said it will reap a bride of
[1:13:37] Christ as certain as I'm standing here
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:43] he said that we progestinated
[1:13:46] will hear
[1:13:47] and will make ready
[1:13:49] for the countdown the Royal seat of
[1:13:52] Abraham's Faith Like Him holding to the
[1:13:55] word of God regardless for he was
[1:13:58] predestinated
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:03] you know
[1:14:05] again hard sometimes to see that those
[1:14:09] word the word of God is traveling
[1:14:11] through eternities through time to reach
[1:14:14] its Mark and there was those if you can
[1:14:17] imagine back in Jesus day when Jesus was
[1:14:20] on Earth and he was doing manifesting
[1:14:23] the very scriptures before them and he
[1:14:25] was Healing The Sick and he was he was
[1:14:27] Discerning the thoughts of their heart
[1:14:29] and calling different ones to follow him
[1:14:31] and and here then suddenly you know the
[1:14:33] power of God was moving amongst all the
[1:14:35] people
[1:14:36] and he said now and then suddenly but
[1:14:38] Abraham says now the man was now with
[1:14:40] Roman soldiers that wrapped a rag around
[1:14:41] his face and couldn't see it and was
[1:14:43] hitting him on the head with the sticks
[1:14:45] and Anna tell us if you're a prophet
[1:14:46] tell us who hit you and and now they're
[1:14:48] looking at a man that looks weak
[1:14:50] defeated
[1:14:51] seemingly he says but Abraham says it
[1:14:54] actually broke their faith
[1:14:56] it should not have but it did he says it
[1:14:59] does yet he said we see a man who called
[1:15:01] a dead man from the grave and who we
[1:15:03] could do all these wonderful Miracles
[1:15:04] and see him hang on a cross now great
[1:15:06] spittle all over his face his beard and
[1:15:08] his face is bleeding the soldiers where
[1:15:11] it jerked his beard out he said I wonder
[1:15:13] if we're thinking the same thing today
[1:15:19] you know where's the promise of his
[1:15:22] coming
[1:15:23] you know people just say well you know
[1:15:25] is it really is a Rapture really coming
[1:15:26] I've heard this for so long you can get
[1:15:29] to a point but Abraham says where their
[1:15:30] faith was broken this moment he says I
[1:15:33] wonder if we're thinking the same thing
[1:15:34] he says do you think of it that way but
[1:15:37] Jesus here they were you can imagine how
[1:15:40] depressed that moment could have been
[1:15:42] those few those hours after the
[1:15:45] crucifixion and everything was in pure
[1:15:48] dismay
[1:15:49] they didn't know they had been told as
[1:15:51] we said last night they were told what
[1:15:53] was going to happen
[1:15:54] but he said it broke their faith and
[1:15:56] they forgot that there was a word that
[1:15:57] was
[1:16:00] spoken Outlet I'll never let his soul go
[1:16:03] into hell neither him see corruption
[1:16:05] it's not going to happen a word had been
[1:16:07] spoken out there but they're all
[1:16:09] dismayed how can this be he or he was
[1:16:12] healing the lame and healing the blind
[1:16:14] and raising Lazarus from there can you
[1:16:16] imagine Lazarus came out of the Tomb he
[1:16:19] was dead for days can you how come he
[1:16:22] can raise Lazarus and here we just
[1:16:23] buried him in a tomb
[1:16:26] they're walking in Emmaus they're pretty
[1:16:28] down
[1:16:29] I mean put yourself back in the days
[1:16:31] they do some incredible moments I mean
[1:16:34] the crowds were following just trying to
[1:16:36] get to the Hem of a garment of Jesus
[1:16:38] Christ and here now he's he I mean he
[1:16:41] watched on most of them fled away but
[1:16:43] some of them would have looked on and
[1:16:44] see seen their lord just beaten and
[1:16:46] whipped and a crown of thorns and then
[1:16:48] crucified and
[1:16:50] I I just how can this be
[1:16:54] but then one stepped up
[1:16:56] and join them along the way
[1:16:59] and he started to speak to them a little
[1:17:00] bit he saw they were pretty down and
[1:17:03] pretty discouraged he says well let's
[1:17:04] just talk a little bit and he just
[1:17:06] started to speak to them about the
[1:17:08] scriptures he started to talk to them
[1:17:09] about some arrows that had been let
[1:17:11] loose a long time ago he says well I
[1:17:14] just want to tell you right from the
[1:17:15] beginning there was something said back
[1:17:18] in Genesis that happened he said there
[1:17:20] was someone going to come that was going
[1:17:22] to crush the head of a serpent his heel
[1:17:24] would be bruised but the head would be
[1:17:26] crushed do you not remember those
[1:17:28] scriptures and who that was speaking of
[1:17:30] yeah yeah yeah yeah we do and so they
[1:17:33] started to talk about all the scriptures
[1:17:35] did you know there's a prophet gonna
[1:17:37] rise up like unto me as Moses spoke and
[1:17:39] so he just started to encourage them and
[1:17:41] start to let them know don't you know
[1:17:43] there were some arrows in the air don't
[1:17:45] you know that something was gonna this
[1:17:47] was gonna happen and he was trying to
[1:17:49] tell them my word is accurate my word is
[1:17:52] precise why are you dismayed right now
[1:17:55] look at who I am but their eyes were
[1:17:56] still not quite open there
[1:17:59] I can imagine
[1:18:00] if you think of those last moments what
[1:18:04] what the the repercussions or the
[1:18:06] concussions in hell as God's words
[1:18:09] started to come to pass as brother Brown
[1:18:11] said even those last seven minutes of
[1:18:13] time the prophecies have started to be
[1:18:14] coming fulfilled don't you think the
[1:18:16] devil didn't know about those things he
[1:18:17] didn't know those prophecies were out
[1:18:19] there and they started to happen like
[1:18:20] this happened like that happen like this
[1:18:22] fulfilling exactly who the Messiah was I
[1:18:24] can imagine hell every time one of them
[1:18:26] words landed on target Hill Pool what
[1:18:29] just happened oh one of God's words one
[1:18:31] of the prophets he's just became
[1:18:33] fulfilled are you kidding me whoa what
[1:18:36] just happened another one just became
[1:18:38] fulfilled it rattled hell rattled hell
[1:18:41] yeah and then it really rattled hell
[1:18:43] when he stepped down into hell he said
[1:18:45] all right you bet oh okay you got what
[1:18:48] we got you oh you think you got me you
[1:18:51] had a champion Called Death that's who
[1:18:53] you thought got me but I'm going to tell
[1:18:55] you right now I am the Creator and I've
[1:18:58] come down to if I feel all my word amen
[1:19:06] the Rebecca says he began to explain to
[1:19:08] them the need of the fulfilling of the
[1:19:10] scripture that the prophets had said
[1:19:13] I feel really religious right now amen
[1:19:16] he says you know what I'm speaking of
[1:19:18] would we be so thought slothful and
[1:19:20] foolish of mine to confine ourselves to
[1:19:22] a book of Creeds and lay aside the Bible
[1:19:24] and say the days of Miracles was passed
[1:19:26] when Jesus said I'll be with you even in
[1:19:28] you to the end of the world he said how
[1:19:30] could we be so slothful and Jesus
[1:19:32] rebuked him he said you should have
[1:19:34] known the scriptures
[1:19:36] my don't be dishearted
[1:19:39] don't be dishearted like I said well
[1:19:41] isn't the promise of his coming I know
[1:19:43] some you know we talked about last night
[1:19:44] you know people drift away and doing
[1:19:46] certain things don't don't be dishearted
[1:19:47] oh he's just so wicked you know it's
[1:19:49] it's layout of seeing age I mean the
[1:19:51] pressures of it don't be disheartened
[1:19:53] it's scripture it's script that must be
[1:19:56] fulfilled that should take heart I mean
[1:19:58] like it's happening this is a wicked day
[1:20:01] it is Sodom and Gomorrah it's scripture
[1:20:03] the arrow went up it's happening
[1:20:06] yeah he said wow they're so lukewarm how
[1:20:08] come they can't be fervent it's
[1:20:10] scripture it must come to pass
[1:20:15] now
[1:20:17] God's expression
[1:20:19] through you
[1:20:21] when that Arrow
[1:20:23] that went out not on no Venture with
[1:20:26] precise accuracy and struck you don't
[1:20:29] you think if God can be that highly
[1:20:32] accurate and that highly precise to
[1:20:34] ensure that his word is fulfilled when
[1:20:36] it hits you do you not think that it's
[1:20:38] going to then fulfill exactly what he
[1:20:41] has in mind for you
[1:20:43] has to if he can have that high accuracy
[1:20:46] that high Precision it's going to come
[1:20:48] to pass what he desired that Arrow to do
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:52] that's right that Abraham says because
[1:20:53] you know he goes you know we have a he
[1:20:56] talks about a strain in the family
[1:20:58] not not a not a uh
[1:21:01] a difficulty not that kind of string but
[1:21:04] a strain of a gene in the family he says
[1:21:07] he says you know we have you ever heard
[1:21:09] of a strain that will kind of
[1:21:11] impersonate his father or mother and
[1:21:14] anybody ever you know that you can have
[1:21:16] little children and you're like wow well
[1:21:18] he's got your ears dear he sure got your
[1:21:20] nose you know because there's a strain
[1:21:22] there that is representative of who he
[1:21:26] came from and so it looks like it acts
[1:21:29] like it talks like whatever it is it's
[1:21:31] because there's a connection in the gene
[1:21:33] code that's exactly who I am and so it
[1:21:37] it it impersonates brother Brown says
[1:21:39] his father or mother or grandfather or
[1:21:41] grandmother he says that strain in the
[1:21:43] family he says you heard of it haven't
[1:21:44] you yes he says that's the same thing in
[1:21:48] predestination you are supposed to be
[1:21:51] here the right way at the beginning but
[1:21:53] being that you come the way you did
[1:21:55] you're subject to the fall but being
[1:21:57] that you're predestinated you hear the
[1:21:59] word and it brings you right back to
[1:22:02] where you predestinated God put a gene
[1:22:05] in his seat of God in you a gene of God
[1:22:07] and it's got an exact coating and it's
[1:22:09] got to make itself come out to be it's
[1:22:11] not going to be like well I'm going to
[1:22:12] throw that piece out and forget the utga
[1:22:15] and all that way I'm going to kind of
[1:22:16] create my own thing a gene is going to
[1:22:19] code itself and it's going to manifest
[1:22:21] exactly what the gene has in mind
[1:22:25] who here knows genetics all right yes
[1:22:28] thank you sister Amy exactly because
[1:22:30] it's impossible as it goes through and
[1:22:32] it tries to to to build out the building
[1:22:34] blocks it will manifest exactly exactly
[1:22:38] now in the human yes we can have these
[1:22:40] little mutations or something happen but
[1:22:42] not God's Gene it's perfect it's high
[1:22:44] accuracy High precision and so when he
[1:22:47] put a gene in you it will come out
[1:22:49] exactly what his mind is so when he sees
[1:22:52] you receive the word of God and you're
[1:22:54] hearing the word and it strikes your
[1:22:56] soul some of you 40 years ago some of
[1:22:59] you 15 years ago some of you today it is
[1:23:01] striking you and it's God saying that's
[1:23:04] exactly what I had in my mind look at my
[1:23:07] daughter she is manifesting exactly what
[1:23:10] I put inside of her
[1:23:13] isn't that beautiful if God could step
[1:23:15] back and be like oh that's what I had in
[1:23:18] mind
[1:23:19] oh isn't that beautiful why because his
[1:23:21] word Goes Forth and it isn't going to
[1:23:23] deviate ever it's impossible actually
[1:23:25] for a son or daughter of God to deviate
[1:23:28] from what he had in mind
[1:23:29] that should give you a lot
[1:23:32] a lot of
[1:23:37] and he could step back and he could say
[1:23:39] Matthew
[1:23:40] I nailed it
[1:23:43] that's what God can say he said he
[1:23:45] nailed it it was no cake it's like
[1:23:47] that's way off Target no God's going to
[1:23:50] be able to step back and say
[1:23:51] Perfection
[1:23:53] because she's part of me
[1:23:56] and I'm perfect
[1:23:58] so are you
[1:24:00] he's perfect not me I'm perfect through
[1:24:02] him
[1:24:04] amen had to clarify that right there
[1:24:08] brother Brown says well then what's the
[1:24:09] use of preaching about around him
[1:24:11] he says well you know if it's
[1:24:12] predestinated in all happy he says
[1:24:14] what's the use of preaching he says I'm
[1:24:15] just doing
[1:24:16] the sainting he says I'm throwing out
[1:24:18] the net I'm just throwing it out I'm
[1:24:20] throwing the word out there he said I'm
[1:24:21] throwing out there to see where it goes
[1:24:23] he says maybe there's some muck in the
[1:24:25] world denominations they throw it off he
[1:24:27] says they just can't absorb it but he'll
[1:24:29] turn the Son and Daughter of God just as
[1:24:31] sure as the world Amen because she is
[1:24:33] predestinated amen it'll find this place
[1:24:36] by the preaching of the gospel and it's
[1:24:38] going to hit its Target exactly because
[1:24:40] God is not going to let it Con void you
[1:24:43] know I was thinking I was thinking was
[1:24:44] it brother Henry walner that had uh 25
[1:24:47] jobs
[1:24:48] yeah 25 jobs
[1:24:51] we had a brother in our church he just
[1:24:52] just recently passed away and he went
[1:24:55] through that many jobs
[1:24:58] do you know how discouraging discouraged
[1:25:00] he was
[1:25:01] how discouraged was he very discouraged
[1:25:04] 25 jobs plus minus a job or so because
[1:25:07] he just couldn't keep it
[1:25:09] because God had an arrow
[1:25:11] that went out on his word and he had
[1:25:13] something in mind he had actually a
[1:25:16] predestinated seed in mind and so then
[1:25:18] he had another Son of God going from job
[1:25:21] to job to job to job I won't say it 25
[1:25:25] times it's a lot of times and he's hired
[1:25:27] and fired hired and fired who's been
[1:25:29] fired once twice I want to ask if you've
[1:25:31] been fired it's a terrible probably a
[1:25:33] difficult moment he was hired and fired
[1:25:35] or let go or just said you know we don't
[1:25:36] need you anymore that many times 20 plus
[1:25:38] times 25 times and he's like what am I
[1:25:40] doing wrong he didn't know that God had
[1:25:44] shot a word out on a bow not on
[1:25:46] adventure but with high accuracy because
[1:25:48] there was a seed of God at his 26th job
[1:25:50] that he was going to land there and
[1:25:53] going to witness to him he doesn't know
[1:25:55] this so we're walking as Sons and
[1:25:57] Daughters of God you can get oh
[1:25:58] discouraged what's going on but God
[1:26:00] threw it out he said uh-uh I need to
[1:26:02] move you this many times because I need
[1:26:05] you to get there it's high accuracy High
[1:26:08] Precision it's not 27 jobs enough 24
[1:26:10] jobs he was 25 so that the 26th he'd
[1:26:15] find his seat
[1:26:19] far beyond our ideas you couldn't say
[1:26:22] well I'm going through something
[1:26:23] difficult maybe it's 25 jobs
[1:26:26] you're going through something you don't
[1:26:27] know but you're a son and daughter of
[1:26:29] God led by the spirit of God God's gonna
[1:26:31] find its Mark whatever it may be
[1:26:38] letter Brandon says that's the reason
[1:26:39] God could work his Works to Jesus he was
[1:26:41] predestinated son he was a lamb slain
[1:26:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:26:44] before a hundred billion trillion
[1:26:47] million years ago just do the math on
[1:26:50] that that he said Genesis 1 1 spoke of a
[1:26:52] while ago he was right then predestined
[1:26:55] to take its place and every one of the
[1:26:58] sons that will have the same
[1:27:00] manifestation that the ones that was
[1:27:02] predestinated amen
[1:27:04] amen if he was so are you
[1:27:09] he says predestinated he was makes word
[1:27:11] seed flesh and you he says the reason
[1:27:14] they hold on to it
[1:27:17] God's people don't let go
[1:27:19] and I'll give her up you know they'll
[1:27:21] give up
[1:27:22] because something he was driving you
[1:27:24] I can't let go of this
[1:27:26] he said they don't back up he said then
[1:27:28] don't back up when you get your
[1:27:30] tradition he says stay right with the
[1:27:33] word now moving fast Mercy
[1:27:38] really fast
[1:27:40] scripture says the word of God is
[1:27:42] sharper more powerful than any two-edged
[1:27:45] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:27:48] asunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:27:50] it's a penetrator the word of God is a
[1:27:52] penetrator
[1:27:53] I haven't been that long have I I'm just
[1:27:55] kidding
[1:27:58] Satan's bow
[1:27:59] he's of Interest Satan does venture all
[1:28:03] right God don't Venture Satan Ventures
[1:28:05] he does indeed he has a big quiver he's
[1:28:08] got constant reloads coming in
[1:28:10] reinforcements throwing in giving him
[1:28:12] new quiversary because he's just firing
[1:28:13] him out there he's just throwing arrows
[1:28:15] at you all the time he's hoping that
[1:28:17] they'll land somewhere in your mind
[1:28:19] somewhere that you can will take hold
[1:28:21] he's like yeah just maybe throw
[1:28:22] something out there or maybe temp so and
[1:28:24] so with this such and such a thing and
[1:28:26] like really that you know try again he
[1:28:30] did he's just adventurous he's like I'm
[1:28:31] hoping maybe it'll hit its Mark or
[1:28:33] something like that that's the Devil
[1:28:35] he's adventurous and he throws it out
[1:28:37] there but God's word no venturer and it
[1:28:40] pierces much deeper than what the devil
[1:28:42] can handle the devil unfortunately he's
[1:28:44] got a training bow he doesn't really
[1:28:46] have the bow that God has and so he he's
[1:28:49] got to throw more arrows out hoping that
[1:28:51] something's going to happen if he you
[1:28:53] know we did a little thing for our camp
[1:28:55] this year and we did bows and arrows for
[1:28:57] uh some of the kids and we put these
[1:28:59] little rubber tips on them we took the
[1:29:01] the target tips off we put the rubber
[1:29:04] tips on they didn't last too too bad in
[1:29:06] fact you pretty much shoot it at
[1:29:08] somebody it wouldn't even hurt them more
[1:29:09] or less we tried so I know
[1:29:13] you know that's like the devil's arrows
[1:29:15] they've got rubber tips on it sometimes
[1:29:17] it can only go so far you might even try
[1:29:19] to upgrade and put the training tips on
[1:29:21] but it only Compares just so far into
[1:29:24] your mind you can't go any deeper than
[1:29:26] that he's trying to get as far as he can
[1:29:28] but he's Limited in his barrel and its
[1:29:31] capacity amen but I had a we have a
[1:29:34] principal at the school and he had bow
[1:29:35] he brought it we were doing an outdoor
[1:29:36] thing with the students and he brought
[1:29:38] some some arrows in and he showed me an
[1:29:40] arrow tip that he had on one of them and
[1:29:42] I said dear goodness that thing is
[1:29:44] lethal it was anyway it had crazy uh you
[1:29:47] know metal all around it but actually
[1:29:49] had these Circle these flutes that went
[1:29:52] down the arrowhead because when that
[1:29:53] Arrow went into a into some game it
[1:29:56] actually created holes straight all the
[1:29:58] way through that it is bled sorry maybe
[1:30:00] too much information but but it was a
[1:30:02] deadly Arrowhead and just for the just
[1:30:05] for example's sake God's arrowheads are
[1:30:08] far worse than that amen they can
[1:30:10] penetrate so deep the scripture says
[1:30:12] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:30:14] piercing and dividing between Soul and
[1:30:17] Spirit so when God sends his word out
[1:30:20] there he's put onto whatever capacity he
[1:30:23] needs he says this this son of God
[1:30:25] they've got a little bit too much a
[1:30:27] little bit of heavy crust on their outer
[1:30:29] layer I need to get deep into their soul
[1:30:31] I need my word to get a little deeper
[1:30:33] Satan's like well I've been working at
[1:30:35] him and he's just hitting in their
[1:30:37] Spirit realm he's Landing in their mind
[1:30:38] he might even afflict you so it hit in
[1:30:40] your flesh but God sends his Arrow of
[1:30:42] his word out he said I'm going deeper
[1:30:45] than that I'm going all the way I'm
[1:30:47] going to penetrate I'm going to drive
[1:30:49] through all them layers and I'm gonna
[1:30:51] pierce the soul of my daughter I'm gonna
[1:30:54] pierce the soul of my son and it's gonna
[1:30:56] grab a hold and anchor deep that's his
[1:30:59] word
[1:31:02] intended place it reaches it and it
[1:31:06] penetrates all the way that's why when
[1:31:09] Jesus could speak to the tree as he read
[1:31:11] at the beginning when he could say his
[1:31:14] word and he could then say
[1:31:16] no more no more fruit from you brother
[1:31:19] Branham said he said he wasn't speaking
[1:31:21] to the leaves he wasn't even speaking to
[1:31:23] the branches he said he wasn't even
[1:31:25] speaking to the roots
[1:31:28] why because the word of God is sharper
[1:31:30] and it can Pierce and divide between
[1:31:33] Soul and Spirit and so when he spoke he
[1:31:36] said he said now watch the tree died
[1:31:37] from where the roots he said the Bible
[1:31:39] said it was withered from The Roots he
[1:31:40] said in the root was the tree life in
[1:31:44] the roots was the life and so the word
[1:31:46] of God went forth out of the Creator and
[1:31:49] he spoke to the life of the tree he said
[1:31:52] he didn't speak to them leaves he spoke
[1:31:53] to the life and the life left the tree
[1:31:57] he didn't say all leaves with her and
[1:31:59] the leaves with her but you know still
[1:32:00] the trunk and everything was kind of
[1:32:02] still functioning he went straight to
[1:32:04] the source straight to the core of it
[1:32:06] past the roots right to The Germ of life
[1:32:08] he said how much more when the word of
[1:32:11] God Is Spoken that it can't go to the
[1:32:13] life of a disease to the life of a
[1:32:15] cancer to the root of the cause to this
[1:32:18] to a tumor or to somewhere somebody's
[1:32:20] eyesight whatever it could be God's word
[1:32:22] speaks right to the source of it
[1:32:25] it hits the exact Zone where something's
[1:32:29] going to happen
[1:32:32] that's why when there's a new birth
[1:32:34] something changes because the life was
[1:32:38] penetrated not just something on the
[1:32:41] surface oh the spirit of God comes oh
[1:32:43] you know you're just dad you know it is
[1:32:44] a really affecting Spirit no no when the
[1:32:46] word comes and it penetrates right to
[1:32:48] the soul the life has changed if the
[1:32:50] tree had died but a son or daughter of
[1:32:52] God when life comes into the soul realm
[1:32:54] it lives it's a new creation he says now
[1:32:58] would be any harder why would it be any
[1:32:59] harder for Jesus to speak to cancer he
[1:33:02] said what you say not me what I say you
[1:33:05] say believe that it'll come to pass and
[1:33:08] the life will leave it
[1:33:10] amen God's word speaks to the very Life
[1:33:13] Source
[1:33:14] that's why when you could brother Brown
[1:33:15] speaks so often the woman at the well
[1:33:17] and she said he says the light struck
[1:33:20] the seed amen it was the word of God
[1:33:22] speaking to the life right to the source
[1:33:25] of it that's why she got up and said ho
[1:33:26] ho and she ran into the city said I'm
[1:33:29] going to tell you about a man who told
[1:33:30] me everything that I was because it
[1:33:33] spoke to the source
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:40] now
[1:33:42] might just go through a little part here
[1:33:43] quickly
[1:33:46] you know Deuteronomy says but the
[1:33:48] prophet
[1:33:49] which shall presume to speak a word in
[1:33:51] my name
[1:33:52] which I've not commanded him to speak or
[1:33:54] that shall speak in the name of other
[1:33:55] gods even that Prophet shall die
[1:33:57] so God is very he's very keen to ensure
[1:34:00] that don't say nothing in my name that I
[1:34:02] didn't tell you
[1:34:03] or you die
[1:34:05] so it was it's not a small thing
[1:34:08] to be a prophet of God
[1:34:10] laying that down
[1:34:12] and if you say in thine heart how shall
[1:34:14] we know the word which the Lord has
[1:34:16] spoken
[1:34:17] okay so maybe you've asked that question
[1:34:20] how do I know it's the word of the Lord
[1:34:22] he says when a prophet speaketh in the
[1:34:24] name of the Lord if that thing follow
[1:34:25] not nor come to pass that is the thing
[1:34:27] which the Lord hath not spoken okay the
[1:34:30] reverse would apply if it did come to
[1:34:33] pass he says I say this in the name of
[1:34:35] the Lord and it comes to pass then it
[1:34:37] would say and prove that it was
[1:34:38] something that the Lord hath spoken but
[1:34:40] the prophet hath spoken it if it doesn't
[1:34:42] come to pass the prophet spoken
[1:34:43] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[1:34:46] of him or you won't stand in awe whoa
[1:34:48] that's a prophet you won't do that
[1:34:49] because it didn't come to pass his
[1:34:51] presumptuous
[1:34:52] and there's a lot of prophets in the
[1:34:54] scripture
[1:34:55] and they spoke they said thus saith the
[1:34:57] Lord thus saith the Lord there you can
[1:34:59] you can walk all the way through
[1:35:00] scripture I won't take too much time I
[1:35:02] don't care if it's Moses or Elijah or
[1:35:03] Isaiah or Jeremiah or as a different
[1:35:05] ones they would they would speak in the
[1:35:07] scripture different different Amos and
[1:35:09] different ones would say certain things
[1:35:10] the Virgin shall conceive or or you know
[1:35:12] they told Israel they're going to have a
[1:35:13] yoke of iron upon their neck or Mount
[1:35:16] Carmel Showdown you know and it wouldn't
[1:35:18] matter but these prophets would have
[1:35:19] spoke the word of the Lord and it came
[1:35:22] to pass and so then the people feared
[1:35:24] them or stood in awe because that's what
[1:35:25] scripture says and so they believed it
[1:35:27] said this is a prophet of God he said
[1:35:29] thus saith the Lord and it came to pass
[1:35:32] this is the prophet of God that's why
[1:35:33] they can Revere Moses he's a you know
[1:35:35] incredible Prophet because God spoke
[1:35:37] through him and it came to pass I can
[1:35:39] tell you if Moses said he says thus
[1:35:41] saith the Lord Pharaoh let my people go
[1:35:42] and it never happened guess what
[1:35:44] the people wouldn't they're like you're
[1:35:45] a false prophet
[1:35:47] but that's not what happened and so it's
[1:35:49] very straightforward in the scripture a
[1:35:51] prophet said thus saith the Lord it
[1:35:53] happened that's a prophet
[1:35:55] some distilled to believe can you
[1:35:57] imagine again Ahab he was told you're
[1:35:59] going to die thus saith the Lord this is
[1:36:01] going to happen
[1:36:02] you know what he he did believe
[1:36:04] something he didn't like Micaiah he
[1:36:06] always speaks evil of me you know but
[1:36:08] they knew he didn't want him to come
[1:36:09] don't say anything because it was going
[1:36:11] to come to pass I don't want to hear it
[1:36:12] almost
[1:36:13] they believe they believe but you know
[1:36:15] what let's just skip up a little bit
[1:36:16] because we've had a prophet in this day
[1:36:19] that he said thus saith the Lord many
[1:36:21] times there's actually over 400 times in
[1:36:23] the Old Testament in the in the uh in
[1:36:26] the message it's over it's over 1600
[1:36:29] times that it's actually brother Brown
[1:36:30] says thus saith the Lord not all in that
[1:36:32] context so there's hundreds and hundreds
[1:36:34] of times that brother Branham actually
[1:36:35] says thus saith the Lord okay why is it
[1:36:39] so hard I I just I'm just asking the
[1:36:42] question for for whomever we're all
[1:36:43] believers here but I just can't
[1:36:45] understand how it's so hard if people
[1:36:47] can believe thus saith the Lord and hear
[1:36:49] which they don't even have any proof
[1:36:51] that actually happened they say well I
[1:36:53] just believe Moses did said that and and
[1:36:55] the Red Sea parted I just believe Moses
[1:36:56] said darkness in the comments and it
[1:36:58] happened he said thus said the Lord and
[1:37:00] I believe it of course because it's in
[1:37:01] the Bible but then a prophet can come in
[1:37:03] this day and say thus saith the Lord and
[1:37:05] it happens again and again and again and
[1:37:07] again why is it so hard to believe it
[1:37:09] that this is a prophet of this day I
[1:37:12] don't understand this I asked the
[1:37:13] question I I give you some examples even
[1:37:15] Congressman Upshaw it's a simple example
[1:37:17] he said in the service he's talking to
[1:37:19] him he was and he says he saw a vision
[1:37:21] he says do you own a brown suit I'm just
[1:37:24] I'm just paraphrasing for time and he
[1:37:26] says because you've been reverent and
[1:37:27] you've honored the Lord he's rewarding
[1:37:29] you so that these latter years you can
[1:37:31] have a happy ladder years thus saith the
[1:37:34] Lord Lord Jesus the Christ has healed
[1:37:37] you
[1:37:38] okay this is pretty prominent thus said
[1:37:40] the Lord the Lord has healed you
[1:37:41] Congressman Upshaw says when
[1:37:45] he says right now
[1:37:48] right now can you imagine he's been in
[1:37:50] his wheelchair for a lot of years he
[1:37:52] says thus said the Lord Christ has
[1:37:54] healed you he says when right now guess
[1:37:57] what he did he got up and he started
[1:37:59] walking how just even in that one
[1:38:02] instance get someone to say well that's
[1:38:04] a prophet he spoke thus say of the Lord
[1:38:06] it happened before my eyes that's a
[1:38:09] prophet of God but no it had to happen
[1:38:11] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:38:13] time and still
[1:38:15] they disbelieve
[1:38:19] I had an example and we know of Isaiah
[1:38:22] and Hezekiah I I won't go through it in
[1:38:25] in its entirety but if you read about it
[1:38:27] Isaiah gave has said thus saith the Lord
[1:38:30] you're going to die and uh Hezekiah went
[1:38:32] and prayed and then he Lord told Isaiah
[1:38:34] to go back and tell him thus saith the
[1:38:35] Lord's going to live a little longer you
[1:38:37] know that scripture good
[1:38:39] so just to prove that the god of the
[1:38:42] Bible is the god of today
[1:38:44] God ordained an instance in the
[1:38:47] prophet's time to to show that again he
[1:38:50] says that I am the same Hebrews 13 8 how
[1:38:52] often brother Branham spoke this message
[1:38:54] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:38:56] and forever because God's word must come
[1:38:58] to pass and so he's proven again this is
[1:39:01] my word I'm going to have it happen
[1:39:02] again so if you go into scripture or in
[1:39:04] the message brother Brown talks about a
[1:39:05] situation where he uh someone came to to
[1:39:09] have him come and pray for somebody and
[1:39:11] he knelt down and pray for them and he's
[1:39:13] waiting for the fellow to come he was
[1:39:15] going to come and he said I was just
[1:39:16] there and he said a world of wind
[1:39:18] started to to blow he says wow it's
[1:39:20] getting ready windy out there you know
[1:39:23] how often how many times the Lord came
[1:39:24] to brother Branham and still a little
[1:39:27] Whirlwind to start he said oh it's
[1:39:29] really windy out there but no it was the
[1:39:31] moving of the Lord he was coming into
[1:39:32] the room
[1:39:33] and he says don't go over there his
[1:39:36] Angel Lord spoke to him don't go over
[1:39:37] there his time has come
[1:39:40] and so brother Brian the brother came he
[1:39:41] said you know uh uh you're going to come
[1:39:44] and pray for the sick but Abraham he
[1:39:46] takes his coat back off that he'd put on
[1:39:47] and he says no he says for thus saith
[1:39:49] the Lord the man's going to die
[1:39:51] you can imagine what that did to the
[1:39:53] fellow his friend and such than that and
[1:39:54] he said oh my well you know please come
[1:39:56] and pray and I said no no it's not going
[1:39:57] to happen you can call me tomorrow
[1:39:59] morning and uh you know uh don't call me
[1:40:01] tonight but you just tell me how it how
[1:40:03] you know just how how he passes it when
[1:40:05] he passes and he rolls out the door on
[1:40:07] my buddy my poor buddy he's just you
[1:40:09] know in distress and and really saddened
[1:40:10] thus said the Lord the man's gonna die
[1:40:14] skip forward
[1:40:15] a little bit
[1:40:17] he said brother Brandon then reads the
[1:40:18] Bible he goes to sit down he reads the
[1:40:20] Bible and his Bible opens to Hezekiah
[1:40:21] and he starts to read about how God
[1:40:23] spared him and then he says the phone
[1:40:25] the phone rings and uh he says brother
[1:40:29] this is the next morning and it's and
[1:40:30] it's his brother and he has he's like
[1:40:32] well you know what kind of news are you
[1:40:33] gonna you know what what's happened and
[1:40:35] he says well it's just it's just really
[1:40:37] the last few minutes of before before he
[1:40:39] dies it's just any time now and then
[1:40:41] brother Branham
[1:40:44] I'm just going too fast I missed a part
[1:40:46] he said call me in the morning and the
[1:40:48] next morning before this phone call
[1:40:50] better Bradham has a vision
[1:40:52] and he sees a lady sitting in his
[1:40:54] sitting in his room and he actually
[1:40:55] wakes up on his bed he looks over and he
[1:40:57] sees a lady in his room and he's a
[1:40:58] little bit shocked because he couldn't
[1:40:59] figure how she even got in his room but
[1:41:01] then he realizes this is a vision and
[1:41:04] she's kind of looking sad and she's
[1:41:05] dressed a certain way then he sees a man
[1:41:07] in a light suit with a red tie and he's
[1:41:09] kind of looking sad and then they kind
[1:41:11] of look at each other and then they kind
[1:41:12] of they kind of smile at each other and
[1:41:14] then he sees himself preaching better
[1:41:15] Branham on on a stage of some sort and
[1:41:18] then he sees the the man and the woman
[1:41:20] kind of look each other's smile and kind
[1:41:22] of Nod it and not at brother Brown him
[1:41:23] and then it fades away he says oh that's
[1:41:25] kind of weird maybe that's somebody I'm
[1:41:26] going to see today is what he says so
[1:41:28] the next morning he gets it up in the in
[1:41:29] the uh in the morning he reads the
[1:41:31] scripture and God points him to Hezekiah
[1:41:32] and then the phone rings and he says you
[1:41:34] know what's been happening he says well
[1:41:36] it's a it's about ready he's about ready
[1:41:39] to pass and then brother Brown says it
[1:41:40] Dawns on him what that Vision means
[1:41:43] and he says what he says is the does the
[1:41:45] wife wear certain clothes he describes
[1:41:47] it he said sure he says does the man
[1:41:49] wear a light suit with a red tie a man
[1:41:52] says all the time he says tell the wife
[1:41:54] to come to the phone so the wife comes
[1:41:56] to the phone and he's like but you know
[1:41:58] she's he's gonna die any moment here he
[1:41:59] says get her on the phone and so he she
[1:42:01] comes to the phone he says sister are
[1:42:03] you ready now
[1:42:05] and she says what do you mean
[1:42:07] he says I said thus saith the Lord your
[1:42:10] husband shall live
[1:42:13] this is just to give you confidence that
[1:42:15] this word still stands he says thus
[1:42:18] saith the Lord your husband shall live
[1:42:19] do you believe that I didn't hear no
[1:42:21] answer I says I couldn't hear no answer
[1:42:23] like someone was carrying on and said oh
[1:42:25] she'd fainted and so she but her Kenny
[1:42:27] came to the phone and said what's the
[1:42:28] matter he says the woman fainted I said
[1:42:30] well I told her thus saith the Lord her
[1:42:32] husband's going to live he said what let
[1:42:34] her brand and then heads he's in he said
[1:42:36] well I'm going to come so he heads there
[1:42:37] because I walked in a sister his this
[1:42:40] lady this man's sister is walking down
[1:42:41] the hall and she's like the very idea
[1:42:43] this holy ruler preacher around here and
[1:42:45] she just scored in it she said I think
[1:42:46] it's a disgrace brother Brown says that
[1:42:48] didn't matter one one bit to him he says
[1:42:50] the Devil Couldn't send enough imps out
[1:42:53] of hell to stop what's going to happen
[1:42:55] he said there's nothing that's all he
[1:42:57] said that's been done said thus said the
[1:42:59] Lord he goes oh you just don't know how
[1:43:01] I felt he's walking down the hallway he
[1:43:03] knew exactly what was going to happen
[1:43:05] because he's a prophet of God and God
[1:43:07] had spoke through his mouth so he walked
[1:43:09] in that room he said is there anybody in
[1:43:10] there there was some Doctor Who said he
[1:43:12] sent the doctors out they're all looking
[1:43:13] a sarcastic at him he said so I told I
[1:43:16] held his hand and she said the wife was
[1:43:19] looking like she was going to faint
[1:43:19] again he says now don't worry
[1:43:21] he says Dear God you who spoke to me
[1:43:24] this morning in a vision I know these
[1:43:26] people are to meet me in Jonesboro
[1:43:28] Arkansas in the service for I was
[1:43:30] standing on the platform and this is the
[1:43:32] man and the woman now let the angel of
[1:43:35] God speak and I felt the vibrations
[1:43:37] start to leave he said I just kept on
[1:43:39] praying I fell to grit my hand I know
[1:43:41] life was there he said I felt him grab
[1:43:42] my hand I just waited there a little bit
[1:43:44] and directly I began he began to wet his
[1:43:46] lips he had some dry lips in there and
[1:43:49] so he was she was still down at the foot
[1:43:50] of the bed crying I just waited a little
[1:43:52] bit directly I seen him look over and I
[1:43:54] said do you know me
[1:43:56] she raised up real quick and she looked
[1:43:58] at me she's seen him raise his head like
[1:44:00] this and on his hand like this he says
[1:44:03] and I said you know me he said yes it's
[1:44:06] brother Branham
[1:44:07] she said my she just Dove through the
[1:44:09] oxygen tent here like she said oh Dad
[1:44:11] Dad Dad like that and grabbed him up
[1:44:13] around like that and just went hugging
[1:44:15] and everything and he goes I just got up
[1:44:16] and slipped right out of the room just
[1:44:18] like that he didn't have no doubt he
[1:44:20] wasn't wondering what was going to
[1:44:22] happen oh God are you going to meet me
[1:44:23] here no because God had spoken thus
[1:44:25] saith the Lord he is going to live just
[1:44:28] so you could have another perfect
[1:44:30] pattern of scripture before you that
[1:44:32] said Isaiah spoke to Hezekiah I got a
[1:44:34] prophet in this day that had the exact
[1:44:37] same thing happen so that you have no
[1:44:39] excuse to believe my word
[1:44:42] Hallelujah
[1:44:45] where where and how do these challenges
[1:44:48] of the message even find footing to even
[1:44:50] speak against it when over and over and
[1:44:53] over again and even brother Branham said
[1:44:55] at the end of these 17 days if what I
[1:44:57] said don't come to pass put false
[1:44:59] prophet on my back you don't think there
[1:45:01] was a Challenger back then it was like
[1:45:02] oh yeah okay I'm going to look for every
[1:45:04] possible area that I can just critique
[1:45:07] and say no you're wrong you're a false
[1:45:09] prophet you don't think they were there
[1:45:10] oh they were there of course they were
[1:45:12] there brother Brandon even talks about
[1:45:13] another instance where there was another
[1:45:15] one he said a woman who was dying with
[1:45:17] she had cancer and he said in three days
[1:45:19] she'll be on the street
[1:45:20] and the guy laughed at him
[1:45:23] he said such a disgrace you imposter put
[1:45:26] that woman under false thoughts like
[1:45:28] that I said it wasn't me it was him
[1:45:33] and he said well you know that woman
[1:45:34] will be dead in the next six hours said
[1:45:36] she's been unconscious now for 24 hours
[1:45:37] she's going to go into time I said if
[1:45:39] she's not in the Street Shelton in 24
[1:45:41] hours I'll tell you what I do I put a
[1:45:43] sign on my back it says false prophet
[1:45:44] she's going to shout or I'm a false
[1:45:47] prophet and I'll go out there and put a
[1:45:48] sign on my back he says you get your big
[1:45:50] Cadillac and drive me around
[1:45:54] can you even imagine the guy standing
[1:45:56] there like okay where's this going well
[1:45:59] it's going here because if she is on the
[1:46:01] street and she is shouting then let's
[1:46:03] put a sign on your back that says crack
[1:46:04] doctor is what brother Branham said to
[1:46:07] him
[1:46:08] guess what
[1:46:10] there was no brother Branham going
[1:46:12] around on the Cadillac with false
[1:46:13] prophet it didn't happen and I don't
[1:46:16] know if he held up his end of the deal
[1:46:18] and put crack doctor on the back I don't
[1:46:19] think that happened either because it
[1:46:21] was thus saith the Lord it must come to
[1:46:25] pass because God don't Venture in his
[1:46:27] words
[1:46:28] foreign
[1:46:30] what confidence that can give us in the
[1:46:33] word of God of the hour
[1:46:36] amen Amen Let Us close
[1:46:44] I'll just go through this last little
[1:46:45] part here
[1:46:47] brother Branham
[1:46:49] I'm just
[1:46:51] when you can when there's a people Sons
[1:46:54] and Daughters of God that can receive
[1:46:57] the word of our day
[1:46:59] very few didn't know his day
[1:47:02] if you didn't take it in Moses day
[1:47:04] you died in the Passover firstborn
[1:47:07] if you didn't get a nose the message in
[1:47:08] those day you didn't get on the ark and
[1:47:11] you died but there was a reward
[1:47:13] for those that believed the accurate
[1:47:17] precise word of their day if you
[1:47:19] believed it in Noah's day you got on an
[1:47:20] ark and there was safety and there was
[1:47:23] safety in an ark amen so there's a
[1:47:25] there's a reward in in believing the
[1:47:27] truth of your day there's there's many
[1:47:29] but just I just want to focus on a
[1:47:31] little bit on one here a little bit
[1:47:33] brother Branham talks about
[1:47:35] the squirrels that he spoke into
[1:47:37] existence because the Lord spoke to him
[1:47:39] and it happened a couple times first
[1:47:41] time three times and then the next time
[1:47:43] it happened and the Lord spoke to him
[1:47:44] and says three squirrels and and so he
[1:47:46] spoke it I'm not going to go into in
[1:47:47] detail you can go in to speak to this
[1:47:49] mountain if you want to get and my
[1:47:51] present Ministry if you want to go and
[1:47:52] read it all but he spoke to him and uh
[1:47:55] if you read it there's three squirrels
[1:47:57] he shoots and he places him in different
[1:47:59] areas they appear he shoots them he says
[1:48:01] no no vision because they bled and he
[1:48:04] ate them and uh but then there's a
[1:48:06] fourth appeared and he and he and it he
[1:48:09] didn't shoot it he couldn't get it he
[1:48:10] said of course because the Lord said
[1:48:11] three so it had to be three but then he
[1:48:13] comes back and speaks to to the group of
[1:48:15] people then brothers that were there and
[1:48:17] they they start praying and one of the
[1:48:19] brothers there Praises this is wonderful
[1:48:20] testimony he said they had some shouting
[1:48:21] and praising and then he said you know
[1:48:23] Lord uh you know if brother Branham if
[1:48:25] he what he told us was the truth would
[1:48:27] you help him find that for a squirrel
[1:48:30] and brother Brandon was really smitten
[1:48:32] because he had just told him what God
[1:48:34] had told what God had told him to do and
[1:48:36] speak to the squirrels and God the
[1:48:38] spoken word had spoken and it had
[1:48:40] happened but then someone's like wow you
[1:48:41] know if you're telling the truth that
[1:48:43] four squirrel should should you know you
[1:48:45] should find it the next day and he's
[1:48:47] like he said no butter Tony in his mind
[1:48:50] he's saying you know you the Lord had
[1:48:52] dealt with his wife she was on the floor
[1:48:53] She God had saved her and he's like how
[1:48:55] are you doubting this ministry and he
[1:48:58] just said you know it even kind of went
[1:48:59] to the brothers there and so this is how
[1:49:01] they received it they received it in
[1:49:03] this way and it was just kind of a
[1:49:04] wonderful time and if you go to the end
[1:49:06] of the story brother Brown does indeed
[1:49:07] find the the four squirrel giving it
[1:49:09] seven a completion and it won't go into
[1:49:12] that aspect but then after that he's
[1:49:14] actually with sister Hattie Wright's
[1:49:16] family
[1:49:17] at the Wright family home and he's
[1:49:19] telling about this account to her and
[1:49:21] and to the family there and he's just
[1:49:22] saying you know I said you know Lord he
[1:49:25] says what bothers me is on those
[1:49:26] squirrels he says I we're supposed to be
[1:49:28] good hunters and he's talking to brother
[1:49:29] wood who's there and he said I can never
[1:49:30] figure it out you know just standing all
[1:49:32] over the grounds there he said there
[1:49:33] shall be a squirrel here and and I've
[1:49:35] been sitting there 45 minutes and no
[1:49:37] more that took my finger down there's a
[1:49:38] squirrel he says if the Lord was
[1:49:40] confirming my Ministry to let me know
[1:49:41] what was going to he's going to help the
[1:49:42] people he says then that same Jehovah
[1:49:45] Jireh I was in need of a squirrel as
[1:49:47] Abraham was in need of a ram he said I
[1:49:49] believe Jehovah Jireh places that there
[1:49:51] his same spoken word he said it wasn't
[1:49:54] me because I didn't know what I was
[1:49:56] saying he said it himself so it must
[1:49:58] come to pass and so they're just sitting
[1:50:01] in the home there's there's eight of
[1:50:03] them actually there in in the home and
[1:50:04] now he's this is the same account he
[1:50:06] just told to the the brothers that had
[1:50:08] been there you know they didn't believe
[1:50:10] one of them surely didn't believe he
[1:50:11] said well you know let's let's hope you
[1:50:13] find it and then we'll believe you kind
[1:50:14] of thing but now he's he's now in a
[1:50:16] different sphere a completely different
[1:50:18] environment and they're just listening
[1:50:20] to him and they're just they're just
[1:50:21] talking you know just a nice little time
[1:50:23] and little old sister Hattie Wright
[1:50:25] she's sitting back there mother Brown
[1:50:28] says she'd never say nothing she's a
[1:50:29] quiet little thing and she's got her
[1:50:31] little dust Bonnet on it like the
[1:50:32] country woman wear there and she put on
[1:50:34] a little clean dress to come over and
[1:50:36] she's just helping her mom cook she's
[1:50:37] just kind of in the background butter
[1:50:38] Brown's at the table she's kind of you
[1:50:40] know not really right there and it's not
[1:50:42] an extremely emotionally charged moment
[1:50:44] they're just they're chatting and she
[1:50:46] just has a little clean dress on and and
[1:50:48] she says she's sitting with her hands
[1:50:49] like this she said and she said that's
[1:50:52] nothing but the truth
[1:50:55] that's nothing but the truth this is a
[1:50:57] completely different response now than
[1:50:59] what had happened just a little bit ago
[1:51:01] and she's just sitting there and she
[1:51:03] says that's nothing but the truth I
[1:51:05] thought my isn't that no different than
[1:51:07] a little humble bride that is receiving
[1:51:09] a word of her hour and she's just humble
[1:51:12] she isn't nothing much she's just simple
[1:51:14] little thing got our little Bonnet on
[1:51:16] just believing the whole word and we're
[1:51:17] just listening in we're just listening
[1:51:19] in and say huh oh that's wonderful
[1:51:20] that's a good word is that right and she
[1:51:22] says listen to that wow that's exactly
[1:51:24] that's the exact accurate word of God
[1:51:26] that's not off trajectory at all I
[1:51:28] believe that 100 I might not understand
[1:51:30] that she could have just been pondering
[1:51:32] all this like you have been pondering
[1:51:33] all this and then she just sits there
[1:51:34] and she says that's nothing
[1:51:36] but the truth
[1:51:39] do you know what happened to that moment
[1:51:40] yeah
[1:51:41] you know what happened in that moment
[1:51:42] brother Brown said she said the right
[1:51:45] thing
[1:51:46] you believed the right thing he said
[1:51:49] here's my Bible as a servant of God I
[1:51:51] say this here she said the right saying
[1:51:53] the word in her answered back to the
[1:51:56] word is what happened the spoken word
[1:51:58] went out she says oh that's exactly the
[1:52:01] truth I believe every word of that and
[1:52:03] it went straight back oh I must have
[1:52:05] just struck the heart of God when a
[1:52:07] little little sister dear little
[1:52:09] daughter God said I believe every word
[1:52:11] of that it just must strike strike the
[1:52:13] heart of God when his word Goes Forth
[1:52:15] and you're listening to it he said Lord
[1:52:16] I believe that that is nothing but the
[1:52:18] truth I ain't doubting none of that it's
[1:52:21] everything in me it's saying yes Lord
[1:52:23] yes Lord oh it just smites me says um he
[1:52:26] spoke back to his Prophet spoke back
[1:52:28] into the prophet and he said the spirit
[1:52:30] of the Lord said to me tell her ask what
[1:52:33] she will and you give it to her
[1:52:36] this is the reward now of believing the
[1:52:39] pure accurate word of God here she
[1:52:42] didn't have no hesitation she didn't
[1:52:44] just trust the word of a prophet he says
[1:52:46] what you've said has come to pass that's
[1:52:48] thus say of the Lord I believe it he
[1:52:50] says I couldn't even speak he says that
[1:52:52] room everybody felt stranger said sister
[1:52:54] Hattie she said yes but around him I
[1:52:57] said thus saith the Lord speak anything
[1:53:01] you desire I don't care what it is if
[1:53:04] you want to know that God gives this
[1:53:05] ministry speak anything you desire thus
[1:53:09] saith the Lord if you'll speak it I'll
[1:53:12] speak it behind you and you'll have it
[1:53:14] right here can you imagine what was
[1:53:16] happening at that moment the spoken word
[1:53:18] was now being spoken for then God is
[1:53:21] demonstrating my word must come to pass
[1:53:24] you believed it now I'm going to honor
[1:53:26] you with her award she she wanted to
[1:53:28] give her little two mites her little
[1:53:29] twenty daughters brother Brandon said
[1:53:31] God had something bigger in store for
[1:53:32] her so here she is you say it I'll speak
[1:53:35] my word behind it and it'll come to pass
[1:53:37] right here eight people standing there
[1:53:39] looking at this situation now better
[1:53:41] Brands he said Brother Brad what shall I
[1:53:44] say
[1:53:46] he said it's up to you
[1:53:48] what are you gonna say
[1:53:50] what should I say Lord
[1:53:52] when you move on the scene you're
[1:53:54] speaking to me what do I say what's on
[1:53:56] our heart what's on the bride's heart
[1:53:58] what's on your heart you know it was on
[1:54:00] her heart
[1:54:01] she said there's said a crippled sister
[1:54:03] her aged father she was poor she could
[1:54:05] ask for money she could ask for anything
[1:54:07] she asked anything that's in your heart
[1:54:09] and you'll have it I said thus saith the
[1:54:12] Lord I'll speak behind you she said
[1:54:14] the salvation of my two boys
[1:54:18] I said you have it
[1:54:20] in the name of the Lord those two two
[1:54:22] modern teenage sniffle fits boys that
[1:54:25] hated the very cause of Christ grabbed
[1:54:27] one another and began to screen the
[1:54:28] blessings of God he said Hattie screams
[1:54:30] the two blocks could hear he's in the
[1:54:32] whole building trembled the power of God
[1:54:34] struck that place Banks fell to his
[1:54:36] plate I don't even know what happened
[1:54:37] for 10 minutes why because the power of
[1:54:39] God fell because a little sister a
[1:54:42] little bride said that's not saying the
[1:54:44] lord it's nothing but the truth and I
[1:54:47] believe it and God knew exactly what she
[1:54:50] was going to ask for he knew it she was
[1:54:52] gonna ask for so he could place that
[1:54:54] power in her and say what are you going
[1:54:56] to have what are you asking for I'm not
[1:54:58] looking for fame I'm not looking for
[1:55:00] Glory I'm looking for riches I'm looking
[1:55:02] for a life I'm looking for salvation and
[1:55:05] God says that's exactly what's in my
[1:55:07] heart because back at the beginning of
[1:55:09] time my spoken word was gonna go forth
[1:55:11] and create an original seed and so I'm
[1:55:14] going to prove that this day my word
[1:55:17] will speak life back into a people
[1:55:22] that's your reward
[1:55:24] that's the reward of this age
[1:55:26] you can speak it this word has power to
[1:55:30] bring life back into a dead child back
[1:55:34] into a dead spouse it happened for
[1:55:36] Hattie right it can happen again today

[2:10:34] but your scripture said that the father
[2:10:37] knows what you have need of
[2:10:39] even before you ask

[2:11:26] they care one for another

[2:11:32] knowing that they're not alone
[2:11:35] but they're surrounded of like Precious
[2:11:37] minds and like Precious faith and may
[2:11:41] their hearts rise in expectation and
