[29:56] s to the wind of
[30:01] Faith praise the lord we just wanted to
[30:03] come out a little early and worship a
[30:05] little with you our hearts are just
[30:07] burning for the things of God and we're
[30:09] thankful to be in the house of God
[30:11] gathered with the Saints if you take
[30:13] your Bibles and turn with
[30:16] me going to take a short reading and
[30:18] then have you be seated and then we'll
[30:21] proceed through the scriptures
[30:24] um just be in prayer for me we thankful
[30:28] that the Lord allowed us to come into
[30:29] his house tonight the Lord had seen us
[30:31] just in the past two weeks it seems
[30:33] maybe two and a half things evolved
[30:35] pretty quickly and we'll testify maybe a
[30:38] little of those things just to get
[30:39] started and and jump in But First
[30:42] Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[30:48] 9 a reading that we're familiar
[30:52] with uh as you find your place
[30:56] there
[30:59] but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor
[31:02] Ear heard neither has it entered in the
[31:05] heart of man the things which God hath
[31:07] prepared for them that love him God
[31:11] bless you you may be
[31:14] seated and I wouldn't want to leave you
[31:17] there because that's not the end of the
[31:19] story um Paul as he's reading there he's
[31:22] referencing Isaiah it's it's Isaiah 644
[31:26] and it would read a little different it
[31:28] says for since the beginning of the
[31:29] world men have not heard nor perceived
[31:32] by the ear neither hath the eye seen oh
[31:35] God beside thee for what he hath
[31:38] prepared for him that waiteth for
[31:41] him now the good news is what Paul would
[31:45] say next in the 10th verse but God hath
[31:48] revealed them unto us by his spirit for
[31:51] the spirit searcheth all things yay the
[31:54] Deep things of God so you're going to
[31:57] see how here's a scripture it's laid up
[31:59] it's the word of God you all scriptures
[32:02] given by God and yet here's a anointed
[32:06] man of the hour that's going to come and
[32:09] then further the reading of this word
[32:12] and and and give you the secret of how
[32:14] this word is going to be imparted is by
[32:16] Revelation by the spirit of God and God
[32:19] hasn't changed his
[32:21] way he's the same yesterday today and
[32:24] forever if he did it that way if a man
[32:25] of God could come and take the the book
[32:27] of Isaiah one of the most notable
[32:29] Oracles of God one of the most profound
[32:31] prophets of the Old Testament and come
[32:33] to him and say hey it's by the spirit
[32:37] these things are revealed the the spirit
[32:39] of God searches the Deep things and
[32:42] they're revealed unto you and to the who
[32:44] loves him then that's a a pattern that
[32:48] God's still following today praise the
[32:49] Lord and we're the beneficiaries of that
[32:53] look God will set forth a prophecy that
[32:56] impacts the entire world to bless one
[32:58] person to to cause his word to come to
[33:01] pass for one person it it doesn't matter
[33:04] if the makeb believer gets blessed it
[33:06] doesn't matter if the unbeliever gets
[33:07] blessed he will bless them so the Cup's
[33:11] flowing he he's not going to if your
[33:13] Cup's going to overflow and bless the
[33:15] unbeliever he I'm sorry he doesn't say
[33:17] well my son I'm not going to have your
[33:20] cup overflow because the hypocrite next
[33:22] to you just might get a little blessed
[33:24] that that's not our god he's a God that
[33:27] looked at ishmail while he's crying
[33:29] underneath the tree and heard the cries
[33:31] of the lad that's my God he he's a he's
[33:35] a good God don't despise the riches and
[33:38] the blessings of God on anybody
[33:42] ever amen um the things that had moved
[33:46] upon our heart and that we wanted to to
[33:49] jump into were was actually from what
[33:51] our pastor had said and um the Lord had
[33:54] just kind of been dealing with my hard
[33:57] on something it seemed it it took a turn
[33:59] and we're going to read in Matthew
[34:01] chapter 7 and we're going to talk about
[34:05] what what has been revealed and our
[34:07] pastor would re reference this scripture
[34:09] it says the light of the body is the eye
[34:11] if therefore thine eye be single thy
[34:13] whole body shall be full of light and
[34:16] you know our pastor as you continue to
[34:18] remember in prayer he he suffered about
[34:20] of blindness in his eye and I do believe
[34:22] while we're here the Lord allows things
[34:24] to transpire Because by the things which
[34:27] we suffer and the things we experience
[34:29] God is taking those things which are
[34:31] invisible the things that are unseen and
[34:33] declaring them here in the natural and
[34:36] we are as his children going to have a
[34:39] portion of things that in this flesh we
[34:41] endure so that we can understand the
[34:44] nature of God in a more perfect way but
[34:49] as you know Brother David lost Vision in
[34:51] his eye many of us were up here working
[34:52] when it happened and and he began to see
[34:55] out of his one eye as he mentioned in
[34:56] the Serv Serv and this scripture he was
[34:58] mentioning it with a passion and it
[35:00] struck me in my heart the light of the
[35:02] body is the eye if therefore thine eye
[35:04] be single thy whole body shall be full
[35:06] of light if you back up it Jesus Christ
[35:10] is is teaching on where your Treasures
[35:13] are laid up he says in in verse 19 lay
[35:16] not up for yourselves Treasures upon the
[35:18] Earth where moth and rust do corrupt and
[35:22] where thieves break in and steal but lay
[35:24] up for yourself Treasures in Heaven
[35:27] where neither moth nor dust or rust do
[35:30] corrupt where thieves do break
[35:33] through where thieves do not not break
[35:37] through nor steal for where your
[35:39] treasure is there will your heart be
[35:42] also and the the heart is really I think
[35:46] the conduit that the Lord's dealing with
[35:48] me on if we're going to see the Deep
[35:50] things if you're going to see the
[35:51] Revelation if you're going to see
[35:53] something there's a place that God is
[35:55] knocking to come in and S with you and
[35:57] eat the evening meal and to break the
[35:59] bread of life and that's the heart if
[36:01] those things are not being opened up to
[36:04] you then the heart has not opened all
[36:06] the doors all the rooms and your
[36:07] treasures and the things that you fixed
[36:09] your eyes
[36:10] upon believe it or not you're there's
[36:13] there's been a deception there's been
[36:16] something that's keeping you from being
[36:17] able to Feast at the table there's
[36:20] something that's caught your eye because
[36:22] your eye has to be single now the single
[36:25] a lot of you instantly thought of your
[36:27] social media status the single's not a
[36:30] social media status I may have lost a
[36:33] lot of you right there and it was like
[36:36] what what did I leave my status at was
[36:38] my status single um you know I think
[36:40] somebody was laughing somebody had set
[36:42] their status to married and they're like
[36:44] there's no way that person's married I
[36:45] think it was a you know but we but our
[36:49] status is married right we're married to
[36:51] Christ Our our heart is single you know
[36:54] you just thinking of it the scripture
[36:55] admonishes us those those who are
[36:57] married you know cares for the th you
[36:59] know cares for the things of the world
[37:00] but there's a spiritual aspect there
[37:02] when it's talking about how a man may
[37:04] please his wife how a wife may please
[37:06] her husband well as we're married to
[37:07] Christ what is what is our what are we
[37:10] focused on right how we may please
[37:12] Christ um there's only one thing that
[37:15] should be consuming our eyes so in in
[37:17] verse 23 it says If thy eye be
[37:20] evil thy whole body shall be full of
[37:23] Darkness if therefore the
[37:25] light if the light of thee be Darkness
[37:28] how great is that darkness no man can
[37:31] serve two masters for either he will
[37:33] hate the one and despise the other you
[37:36] cannot serve God in Mammon amen that's
[37:40] the Paradox I find you know brother
[37:42] brandom would never stop you
[37:45] know admonishing the believer to examine
[37:49] themselves to check up to make sure they
[37:51] knew the things that were in their lives
[37:53] and where their hearts were at um we're
[37:56] going to
[37:58] just try to dive into that because you
[38:01] know the the things I'm ministering to
[38:03] you are where I'm at I I want there's
[38:05] things that you know I want to see if
[38:08] you even go
[38:10] through in that in that chapter a
[38:13] precious verse me and my wife hold this
[38:15] over us it's verse 33 but seek ye first
[38:18] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[38:21] and all these things shall be added unto
[38:23] you and if we're not seeing the pro the
[38:26] the being added then it then there's
[38:28] nothing wrong with God's promises amen
[38:32] we just have to step back and know that
[38:34] everything that we have need of has been
[38:36] provided within this message it is a
[38:39] word that's to dress a bride and it's
[38:42] going to produce what God sent it to do
[38:44] because every seed has to produce of its
[38:46] kind I thank God for that that we can't
[38:50] get away from the law of God that each
[38:53] seed has to produce of its kind um in
[38:57] things that are to be in in uh chapter
[39:02] 138 paragraph
[39:05] 138
[39:09] um just uh give me a moment I did
[39:11] actually want to read a scripture before
[39:14] I jump to
[39:15] there it's uh 2
[39:18] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse
[39:22] 18 so there's something we do want our
[39:25] eyes to be focused on uh we do know it's
[39:27] the word of God it's the anointed word
[39:30] for our day 2
[39:32] Corinthians 3:
[39:35] 18 but we all with open face beholding
[39:38] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[39:40] changed into the same image from glory
[39:42] to glory even as the spirit of the Lord
[39:46] and I do believe we have on there the
[39:48] Amplified Bible I'm going to read from
[39:50] it because it kind of expounds I like to
[39:52] sometimes go over to this Onin Amplified
[39:54] and and read sometimes scripture so
[39:56] that's uh same same
[40:00] verse thank you and in all of us as with
[40:05] unveiled face because we continue to
[40:09] behold in the word of God as a mirror
[40:12] the glory of the Lord are constantly
[40:14] being transfigured into his own image in
[40:18] every increased Splendor and from one
[40:21] degree of Glory to another for this
[40:23] comes from the Lord who is the spirit
[40:26] amen don't you enjoy that as you behold
[40:30] the word of God as you're reading it it
[40:32] is transforming you into what it's
[40:37] declaring you know Matthew as he said
[40:39] what are you looking at right if you're
[40:42] emulating the reason why we're showing
[40:45] forth influences and showing forth and
[40:48] declaring things is because what we're
[40:49] looking at you know you cannot there's
[40:52] you
[40:53] cannot deny the law of influence upon
[40:56] you birds of a feather flock together
[40:58] you know that the shepherd around the
[41:00] Sheep starts to laugh like a sheep you
[41:03] know there's a there is going to be an
[41:05] effect by the things you look at that
[41:08] it's going to have upon you you you may
[41:11] think you're insulated from it but you
[41:14] do it enough you associate with
[41:17] something enough you start to parot it
[41:19] whether you like it or not hang you know
[41:22] you young men you hang around the wrong
[41:24] crowd you do the wrong vocabulary and
[41:26] all of a sudden you know you pick up
[41:29] these little ticks that other you know
[41:31] the group you're in
[41:33] has you know and you just you're
[41:35] behaving like the crowd you're
[41:37] in that's okay but the good news is is
[41:40] that you can be so impressed by the word
[41:43] of God because you're beholding it that
[41:45] you start to look and be at and reflect
[41:49] what's in there because there's
[41:50] something in you I guarantee you as a
[41:51] Son of God uh there's something in you
[41:54] crying for manifestation
[41:56] it reads the word of God and it says
[41:58] that's me that's me and it's crying for
[42:01] manifestation and there's a formula and
[42:03] we just want to be faithful to follow
[42:05] that
[42:07] um paragraph
[42:10] 138 look in your Looking Glass tonight
[42:13] and see which way am I headed is Jesus
[42:16] preparing a place for me a body that
[42:19] body is perfect that body walks orderly
[42:23] it's a son a daughter before God and I'm
[42:26] in birth pains in here I'll pick the mic
[42:29] up so you I uh notice a little feedback
[42:32] I'll do a little I I using the hand mic
[42:35] because I'm not sure where my voice is
[42:36] going to be and if it's going to go out
[42:39] but uh you just pray for us the body is
[42:41] perfect the body walks orderly it's a
[42:43] son a daughter before God and I'm birth
[42:46] pains here to be born into that body
[42:48] there if I still love the world it shows
[42:51] me that I'm not I have no body there I'm
[42:54] a church member I wasn't a germ of God
[42:57] I'm not he is not my father he said if
[43:01] you cannot stand
[43:03] chastisement that's what you're getting
[43:05] now then you're a bastard children and
[43:07] not children of God you're getting that
[43:10] now amen okay I if you're here in this
[43:13] flesh you're getting chastisement don't
[43:16] despise the chastisement be thankful
[43:18] that you're on the Potter's will Lord
[43:20] you care you know when we were in
[43:22] athletics if the coach didn't say
[43:24] anything to you he did he didn't care
[43:28] you're off the team but if he's telling
[43:31] you if he's giving you a hard time if
[43:33] he's knocking you upside the helmet if
[43:34] he's telling you do better it's because
[43:36] the potentials are there he's not
[43:38] wasting his time the P potential is
[43:41] there to do better as a Son of God if
[43:43] there's a if there's something in you
[43:45] that's
[43:46] thirsting there's a there's an answer to
[43:49] it I just don't want to be guilty of
[43:52] quenching The
[43:54] Thirst and that's that's my conviction
[43:57] I'm I'm standing before you saying Lord
[43:59] where are those other thirsts taking me
[44:02] where do they end up what's the wisdom
[44:04] of God because those I'll tell you the
[44:05] end of them it's death there is no other
[44:08] end of any other thirst outside of the
[44:11] thirst of God that's anywhere else but
[44:13] death we were over at the Bohanan in in
[44:17] little Abigail he was there to write
[44:21] something she said she had to write an
[44:23] essay on Eternal separation I'm like
[44:27] you
[44:28] what you know that's quite you must have
[44:30] some Christian curriculum well we' we've
[44:33] got we've got an Insight that no one
[44:36] else has into what it means to be
[44:39] predestinated what eternal life is what
[44:41] the life of God is and that you to have
[44:44] eternal life had to always have eternal
[44:47] life and the things that don't have
[44:49] representation are in essence eternally
[44:52] separated from God oh even a woman that
[44:54] liveth in sin is dead while she liveth
[44:57] if you don't have eternal representation
[44:59] your time is
[45:02] time your time is time and when it's
[45:05] time it's
[45:07] time you know brother brandham talks
[45:09] about that that sensation of falling he
[45:12] visited hell and he talks about nothing
[45:15] was there he said a consuming fire would
[45:17] have been better than that you know
[45:20] because we know that burning fire is the
[45:21] Holy Fire of God it's an unquenchable
[45:24] fire and it'll have its work but we
[45:27] don't believe in eternal
[45:28] hell you know okay this we we we're
[45:32] walking in a beautiful light Saints it's
[45:34] a it's a beautiful light
[45:39] um where was
[45:41] I bible say that amen amen if you cannot
[45:44] stand the chastisement of God when you
[45:47] see the scripture lining up and you say
[45:50] oh I don't want to hear that stuff I'm a
[45:53] Christian I do all right go ahead see
[45:56] it's one sure evidence you're not a
[45:58] child of God but a real child of God is
[46:00] hungering and thirsting why is there
[46:03] something in your heart telling you you
[46:05] want it and needs it yes Lord
[46:10] amen it shows there's something pul
[46:13] Satan trying to pull you there there's a
[46:15] body
[46:23] there let's pray the Lord keeps on
[46:25] motion
[46:26] there's a body there and this one a type
[46:30] of here what are you using this one
[46:37] for Saints this is you know I'm I I'm
[46:41] this is inditing me okay I didn't come
[46:43] up here with quotes to throw at
[46:50] anybody to glorify the devil and the
[46:53] world and the Fashions and things are
[46:56] you looking towards
[46:58] heaven and there's something up there
[47:01] you're glorifying god with your
[47:10] life you know there there's a suffering
[47:13] sometimes that we go through and I
[47:16] believe we're going through that as
[47:17] children of God you know no chastisement
[47:20] is Pleasant I'd like to rejoice in the
[47:23] things of God what I wanted to do is get
[47:25] up here and read this and talk
[47:29] about how Heaven's waiting you know the
[47:33] Lord showed brother Brandon beyond the
[47:36] curtain of time what it was like to see
[47:38] that crowd and that group of people run
[47:41] to him and there's something in me that
[47:43] says I don't want to miss that for
[47:48] anything and that's our reward I believe
[47:51] that's absolutely part of the treasure
[47:54] that our hearts should be set upon it
[47:56] should be saying I don't want to miss
[47:58] that the a prophet's message has come
[48:01] it's come to reveal the secret things
[48:03] the Deep things and it's it's ministered
[48:06] in entrance and if you despise those
[48:08] things it just it you know the the
[48:11] approach people have towards this
[48:12] message is a little scary sometimes it's
[48:15] not just an inspirational it's not
[48:18] another uh what do they call those
[48:21] things you know I I you read it I I
[48:25] recommend this doswald Chambers you know
[48:28] it's it's not just another in inspir uh
[48:30] inspired reading that you do you know if
[48:33] devotional this is not another
[48:36] devotional this isn't just a collection
[48:38] of men who you know been able to go
[48:41] through the Bible and combine things but
[48:43] this is a thus sayith the Lord message
[48:45] that is to prepare a bride and dresser
[48:47] and you have to have the wedding garment
[48:49] on there's not another one dressing the
[48:52] bride out this message is dressing the
[48:54] bride this is the dress way
[48:56] and so if he says to dress a certain way
[48:59] and to have your character shape a
[49:00] certain way and you're not then you're
[49:03] not dressed in the dress wear and part
[49:06] of the there's several things that are
[49:08] going to stunt the growth right the
[49:09] conditions the heart so brother brandom
[49:12] in one place he he was talking about how
[49:14] when he's he's seen a a stock of corn he
[49:17] said there was creepers that come in and
[49:19] they cuz Satan can't uh do anything but
[49:21] pervert okay if he and he can't keep the
[49:25] seed from producing after its kind it's
[49:27] a law of God so the only thing you could
[49:30] do is prevent it from being quickened
[49:32] and then start to stunt its growth and
[49:34] then try to pervert it when it starts to
[49:36] grow to prevent it from manifesting what
[49:39] the intended life that it's to do so
[49:41] what does he do is he sews creepers and
[49:43] that creeper comes in and it could be
[49:45] the cares of life it could be other
[49:47] things it could be and that's where
[49:48] we're at now right so we're we're every
[49:52] single one of us has a care of life if
[49:54] you didn't make it here then you
[49:56] probably didn't do you know what you
[49:59] have to tend to the things of this world
[50:02] I mean we're not so spiritual that I
[50:03] mean did anybody here not drive and just
[50:07] teleported here it's scriptural I mean
[50:09] you can come here but most of us had to
[50:11] tend to Something in the natural to get
[50:13] here right so while we're having to tend
[50:16] to Natural Things that is all the
[50:18] potential Satan needs to start to choke
[50:21] out the potential the manifested the
[50:23] manifesting of the Son of God because
[50:25] you have a carnal mind and the carnal
[50:27] mind's at iny to with God and I'm sorry
[50:29] but going and getting gas isn't
[50:31] necessarily a spiritual
[50:32] Endeavor but we do all you know I didn't
[50:36] mean to go there but I I want to mention
[50:38] this I was at the gas station yesterday
[50:41] and a and a Gentleman uh there andy you
[50:46] know a gas pump isn't a place that
[50:49] normally you expect this I don't even
[50:50] know how the conversation started I
[50:52] don't believe I see him here but he
[50:57] uh in just short order we start we
[51:00] started talking about the Lord and he'd
[51:02] been he'd done five tours he'd been in
[51:05] Afghanistan and he'd been in Iraq he was
[51:07] a Gunner he said he'd seen everything
[51:09] he'd seen a lot of things and he had
[51:11] just buried a friend and I and I
[51:14] reminded I said we're on the short side
[51:18] here you know this isn't this isn't what
[51:21] we're living for and uh we started
[51:25] Fellowship about the Lord and my heart
[51:28] goes to men that have done this country
[51:30] service you know I feel as Christians
[51:33] we're not living the way we are there's
[51:35] a lot of people paying higher prices for
[51:38] a lot more temporal things when we've
[51:41] have the Kingdom of Heaven set before us
[51:44] and we're not even putting the skin in
[51:45] the
[51:48] game you know men like
[51:51] that and we won't hit our
[51:54] knees
[51:59] Lord help me you don't understand the
[52:01] price that guy
[52:08] paid we're fools to think of ourselves
[52:10] more than we
[52:12] are we need
[52:18] God pardon me I don't know where I was
[52:24] at
[52:26] I'm going to just read this there's
[52:28] something in US calls us to live and
[52:30] there's something in US calls to do
[52:32] right then God will call somebody to the
[52:34] platform or to the pulpit that will
[52:37] preach the absolute truth we're thankful
[52:40] for that it shows you then that if
[52:42] you're a real child of God you begin to
[52:43] cry out God take it away from me
[52:45] circumcise me from this take these
[52:48] things away from me why it's needed for
[52:50] your heavenly home that you're going
[52:53] there he's gone to prepare you you you
[52:55] got a real word bride of
[52:59] Christ
[53:01] amen but uh I I feel that just I to read
[53:06] this this was really upon my heart to do
[53:09] I'm going to do it there's other things
[53:10] but I think this is part of the the
[53:13] tempering right I said as the as the the
[53:15] cares in the life would choke you out
[53:17] that was the creeper right and I just
[53:21] and I think what I meant to say is you
[53:22] know there's many just cares right as a
[53:26] soldier uh and the things he did I would
[53:31] you know those are things that in some
[53:33] ways were a lot of necessary you know
[53:35] something has to pay a price in order
[53:37] for us to have freedom and other for
[53:39] families to be preserved and the
[53:41] ultimate price of that is the lives that
[53:43] are laid down for others that others
[53:44] might live and enjoy the benefits we
[53:46] live but those cares of Life are not uh
[53:51] meant to have those influences on a
[53:53] Believer but we give all things to
[53:55] Christ and I you know in my backyard we
[53:58] had a a creeper on a plant and I seen
[54:00] how it deforms I could that that plan of
[54:03] mine could never produce the what it was
[54:05] intended to I believe it's a Indian ha
[54:08] uh
[54:09] um it's a some sort of blooming plant
[54:13] and it we've had it for over 10 years
[54:15] and it's finally coming into maturity
[54:16] but as it was starting to get finally
[54:18] hit a stride we had uh I believe it was
[54:21] a either a morning glory or 5:00 it's a
[54:24] Vine that has some BL moms and it
[54:25] started to to creep around this thing
[54:28] and completely canopied it and had
[54:30] suffocated it and now it would be pretty
[54:33] it's pretty going along the fence post
[54:35] and I I think what they say is a a weed
[54:37] is a uh is someone's flower Mis
[54:40] misplaced and and cares need to be in
[54:43] their proper place if they're in the if
[54:46] they get if they're given the
[54:47] preeminence over something that
[54:49] something's not going to flourish the
[54:51] way it should you have to pull it back
[54:53] you have to trim it back you have to
[54:55] keep it off and you know some flowers
[54:57] are good in some places and not others
[55:00] so you know if if that little creeper or
[55:03] that little boy or the girl that let if
[55:05] that's someone else's flower let it go
[55:07] ahead and go somewhere
[55:09] else you
[55:11] know there you
[55:16] go someone can use
[55:19] that you know a flower
[55:21] misplaced as someone else's creeper
[55:29] don't put fertilizer on
[55:33] it choke it
[55:36] out
[55:46] Amen brother Brandon preceding this
[55:48] paragraph It's paragraph
[55:51] 115 he's laying it in pretty heavy he's
[55:53] talking about depart from me ye that do
[55:55] iniquity I never knew you but 115 he
[55:57] says see what I mean oh little children
[56:00] do you feel the need of that vitamin
[56:02] tonight that something there's a body
[56:04] waiting Yonder there's a body waiting to
[56:07] be received people don't be deceived
[56:10] don't be deceived the Devil is a
[56:12] deceiver even the wedding garment you
[56:15] must wear it it must be now we at the
[56:19] evening time the Earthly body is now
[56:22] ready to be dissolved and we're prepared
[56:25] to enter the Heavenly and we now feel
[56:28] the strange call of God to go to the
[56:30] Eternal great e to that to this great
[56:33] Eden and before we were born here our
[56:36] little bodies cried for something and
[56:38] that had to be provided or we'd be
[56:40] afflicted children so think of
[56:43] that
[56:45] if if the mom didn't provide the right
[56:47] nurture to the child then it would be an
[56:51] Afflicted child and if we're not in the
[56:54] Right image that we need to be in it's
[56:56] because we're not getting the vitamin
[56:59] brother brandom's giving us a key here
[57:01] the pull for that vitamin is from the
[57:04] Heavenly it's from that Eternal being
[57:06] your ey should be single upon it because
[57:09] that's going to draw you to the
[57:10] necessary vitamin

[57:42] you're in me and sister Julia were in uh
[57:45] Switzerland we had taken a a a train and
[57:49] on our way up I mean we had the opper
[57:51] you know it's kind of like while we're
[57:52] here let's go to the top
[57:55] and uh you know it's like man the price
[57:57] is tripled it's like but I'm not going
[57:59] to have this chance
[58:01] again and we're on the train and this
[58:04] this local lady she's there she's like
[58:06] what are you guys doing where you from
[58:08] where you going she's real friendly
[58:09] until we told her we were going to the
[58:11] top and then she looked at us like we
[58:13] were
[58:15] idiots what are you
[58:17] doing and
[58:19] uh okay you know she gets off and she
[58:22] has her walking sticks it's green she's
[58:24] got her walking shorts on and off she
[58:26] goes beautiful day 70° weather there she
[58:30] goes well we started to go up and up and
[58:34] up and all of a sudden we were in the
[58:37] clouds and all of a sudden it was really
[58:39] really cold and all of a sudden we were
[58:41] just in a bunch of snow and we got off
[58:44] at the station at the top and we read
[58:46] the sign and it was like pictures of how
[58:49] they could have a basketball court up
[58:50] there and how they had the highest
[58:52] altitude basketball game in the world
[58:54] and you're looking around like oh they
[58:55] did all this up here they had an ice
[58:58] tunnel to go from one place to the other
[59:00] there was nothing up there it was the
[59:02] wrong
[59:04] season okay you get your head in the
[59:08] clouds in the wrong season they ain't
[59:10] nothing for you there you need to come
[59:13] back down a little bit get out of the
[59:16] clouds let our heart start to be molded
[59:21] and shaped so we can receive the things
[59:23] of the Lord that he has for because what
[59:25] he wants is your heart at the end of the
[59:27] day it's your character and what's
[59:29] knowledge
[59:30] do it puffs up so do you think as the
[59:33] wide Ste as wise as he is is he just
[59:36] going to go pour it all on you when you
[59:38] don't have the character if you want
[59:40] knowledge get ready for the character
[59:43] and get ready for it on the front
[59:47] end okay everybody praying for
[59:50] Revelation
[59:52] now I mean I am I I don't mean that
[59:56] wrong but you know it it's it's not
[59:59] we're not here to to beat people up with
[1:00:01] what we know right we want to have the
[1:00:05] life that's salty and that can convert
[1:00:07] and change things and most of all we
[1:00:09] want a presence he's willing to be
[1:00:12] around right we want the Lord to to drop
[1:00:15] in and and talk to
[1:00:17] us and uh if if our hearts are not in
[1:00:20] the place to do that then you you're not
[1:00:23] taking a body change cuz that was what
[1:00:25] Enoch did as he walked with God but I
[1:00:28] want to remind us of what brother
[1:00:29] Brandon would see in paragraph
[1:00:32] 118 it's a short reading I'm but I'm
[1:00:34] going to it's not not maybe the shortest
[1:00:36] reading was what I mean to say but in
[1:00:38] really context it's short for what we
[1:00:39] can see he says but that morning when I
[1:00:43] felt something come over me and I
[1:00:45] thought usually like a vision comes and
[1:00:47] I looked and I looked I thought my what
[1:00:50] is this and I looked a great Green
[1:00:53] Hill
[1:01:00] and young woman was coming from
[1:01:02] Everywhere by the tens of the thousands
[1:01:05] hundreds of
[1:01:06] thousands and they were all coming long
[1:01:08] hair hanging down their back white robes
[1:01:10] on barefooted screaming hollering our
[1:01:12] brother I thought now that's strange
[1:01:15] turned back around and looked and there
[1:01:17] I laid there and there was my wife
[1:01:20] laying there in the bed and I said now
[1:01:22] you know what I died
[1:01:26] he's describing how this wasn't a
[1:01:28] typical
[1:01:29] Vision I said that that's what happened
[1:01:34] I've died and I said I might have had a
[1:01:36] heart attack or something I've died the
[1:01:39] lay there lays my body and I was just
[1:01:41] laying there with the hands back like
[1:01:43] that and just stiff and I thought that's
[1:01:45] not 20 ft from me and there I was
[1:01:48] looking I thought that there's my wife
[1:01:50] there and there's everything and there's
[1:01:52] my shirt hanging there on the bed post
[1:01:53] there and I thought here I am and I
[1:01:56] looked around again and these women were
[1:01:57] all coming and they were looking coming
[1:01:59] this way and they were coming my
[1:02:00] brothers oh they're genuine all of them
[1:02:03] looked to be young men they were
[1:02:05] screaming our precious brother oh I
[1:02:07] don't
[1:02:11] know what to think I thought this is
[1:02:14] strange I looked back and I wasn't an
[1:02:17] old man I was young I thought this is
[1:02:19] strange thing I thought is this a vision
[1:02:22] I'd bite my finger I thought no this
[1:02:24] ain't a kind of vision I've had then
[1:02:27] there something began to talk to me up
[1:02:29] here and said you've entered with your
[1:02:31] people and I thought with my people are
[1:02:34] they bandoms he said they're your
[1:02:37] converts to Christ and these
[1:02:41] women Saints that's our
[1:02:45] prize that's what should be the
[1:02:48] singleness of our heart and the
[1:02:49] singleness of our
[1:02:51] mind
[1:02:52] um and there's a necessity that our
[1:02:55] heart be in the condition to receive the
[1:02:59] message
[1:03:04] because we don't want to miss
[1:03:07] it and we are on this side where there
[1:03:10] is
[1:03:12] chastisement and a bastard child doesn't
[1:03:15] withstand the
[1:03:18] correction and there's besides the now
[1:03:21] that's when the seed's growing okay
[1:03:24] there's a there's a calling to
[1:03:26] repentance uh and that's a conviction
[1:03:29] that leads to a conversion to a new
[1:03:31] heart but don't think that you know the
[1:03:34] once you're converted once you're
[1:03:36] serving God that the need for the
[1:03:39] corrective pruning of God goes
[1:03:43] away you know that's that's the danger
[1:03:47] of religion and that's and that that's
[1:03:50] message religion too you know that's the
[1:03:53] danger of we get results don't we the
[1:03:57] presence of God is with us if you're not
[1:04:00] being
[1:04:01] corrected you're a bastard
[1:04:04] child thank God for the
[1:04:07] correction I if really you've arrived at
[1:04:10] a place where there's no
[1:04:16] correction I mean Lord forgive me there
[1:04:18] may be somebody there
[1:04:21] I you know please tell me how you got
[1:04:24] [Laughter]
[1:04:27] there you know but I I see it as my life
[1:04:31] personally has to be shaped by this word
[1:04:34] yes and um I see that there I need
[1:04:38] there's a greater calling for me in to
[1:04:42] have the uh The Inheritance that's ours
[1:04:45] I hope by putting the prize of crossing
[1:04:48] over puts that out there for everybody
[1:04:51] cuz I feel that if you're still here
[1:04:53] then that should be at least the if
[1:04:55] you've climbed the pentacle of the
[1:04:57] stature of the perfect man and you're
[1:04:58] sitting at love and you can the guy cut
[1:05:00] you off at traffic and you uh you bless
[1:05:03] them and you know there's and if you've
[1:05:07] arrived then all then you still have a
[1:05:11] something to have a singleness of heart
[1:05:13] upon you can set that the vitamins of
[1:05:16] that body should still be such a pull on
[1:05:19] you that it's causing a desperation that
[1:05:21] says Lord oh I want to run up to my bre
[1:05:24] brandom and say my precious brother I
[1:05:27] want to be with that with all those
[1:05:29] Saints I want to be in that redeemed
[1:05:31] body Hallelujah I mean I'm looking for
[1:05:35] it and the more you the more you pile on
[1:05:38] this body the more I'm looking for it
[1:05:42] see Satan's C tooken his own snare the
[1:05:46] very things he thinks is going to
[1:05:47] accomplish something he's going to
[1:05:49] discourage you just pushes you closer to
[1:05:51] God the very things that he thinks he's
[1:05:54] going to well I'm going to get him with
[1:05:55] this
[1:05:56] one what what he's thanking God in the
[1:06:00] storm I know the master of the wind what
[1:06:03] what's going on here that must be a oops
[1:06:06] he done stuck the Stinger in the wrong
[1:06:08] one
[1:06:10] again you know
[1:06:14] Hallelujah you know it the uh don't let
[1:06:17] the Scarecrow take your blessing I don't
[1:06:20] care what the tactic is of the enemy
[1:06:22] let's expose it yes sir and and for me I
[1:06:25] want to get I think part of the the
[1:06:27] tactic of the enemy is he's he's you
[1:06:29] know a single eye you know let's think
[1:06:31] about just even the definition of single
[1:06:33] it's the whole right so
[1:06:36] if may may not make any half of you are
[1:06:39] not going to get this
[1:06:41] joke there's and this wasn't the joke
[1:06:44] there's and there's no place for jokes
[1:06:46] all
[1:06:47] right we'll just move
[1:06:50] on but it it it helps prove the point
[1:06:54] point but it's not
[1:06:57] necessary the light of the body is the
[1:07:00] eye if therefore thine eye be single thy
[1:07:03] whole body shall be full of
[1:07:05] life right that's what we're taking of a
[1:07:08] a text from so Psalms in Psalms 9:1 it
[1:07:12] says I'll praise thee Oh Lord with my
[1:07:14] whole heart I will show forth all of thy
[1:07:17] marvelous works the whole that we're
[1:07:19] speaking of here is is is is at not in
[1:07:24] part or the single is is a whole or not
[1:07:27] in part so if your I be single means
[1:07:30] that it's not
[1:07:31] divided you know in things and Jesus
[1:07:34] makes it very clear it says you can't
[1:07:35] serve two masters or you're going to
[1:07:37] despise one or the other and brother
[1:07:39] brandom I have the quote in here
[1:07:41] somewhere it's so beautiful he says
[1:07:42] that's the problem with us we've got one
[1:07:45] eye on the world and one eye on Calvary
[1:07:49] and we're
[1:07:50] not you know you got just enough
[1:07:53] religion to make your s miserable and
[1:07:55] you're not going to produce the fruits
[1:07:56] that are necessary your heart has to be
[1:07:59] wholly given to him and in order for him
[1:08:02] to have the work that he that he wants
[1:08:04] to to have
[1:08:07] um I do
[1:08:10] have I did think I was going to go in a
[1:08:13] totally different direction but the Lord
[1:08:14] just W really impressed upon my heart
[1:08:18] that heaven's waiting on
[1:08:21] us
[1:08:22] and
[1:08:24] but in order to do that we have to keep
[1:08:26] our hearts with all
[1:08:29] diligence you know the the message and
[1:08:32] the and part of the the Turning of the
[1:08:33] heart it is the Mysteries that turns the
[1:08:36] heart but really the condition that the
[1:08:38] heart had to be in to even receive the
[1:08:40] truths you have to recognize the the
[1:08:44] authority of the prophet's message
[1:08:46] because otherwise you think that you
[1:08:49] you're going to presumptuously think
[1:08:51] that some of it is
[1:08:55] uh I it's incredible but this is not a
[1:08:59] new tactic of the enemy he uses the same
[1:09:02] tactic against the Bible but he'll say
[1:09:04] it was out of it it's out of its season
[1:09:07] you know that was brother brandom just
[1:09:08] being influenced by by the the political
[1:09:11] climate of the age well they say the
[1:09:14] same thing about the scripture when it
[1:09:16] says I suffer a woman not to teach or
[1:09:18] Ser authority over man that she should
[1:09:19] be silent in the congregation well that
[1:09:21] that's not an inspired word that that
[1:09:23] was just a word that was you know that
[1:09:26] should be seen in the light of its age
[1:09:28] and you your eyes is not single you've
[1:09:30] set your eye on you're hearing some
[1:09:32] other
[1:09:33] voice you don't realize it but you're
[1:09:36] already starting to garnish your garment
[1:09:38] with something else and it isn't the the
[1:09:41] dress wear that Christ is taking a bride
[1:09:44] in so it would behoove you to understand
[1:09:48] that there's only one way that God wants
[1:09:52] his dried bread his bride
[1:09:55] dressed
[1:09:56] amen um and you have to be wholly given
[1:09:59] to
[1:10:01] that and the and wisdom is ultimately to
[1:10:04] be able to consider the end of the
[1:10:06] matter okay and if you understand that
[1:10:11] all those efforts are vain all those
[1:10:14] efforts are going to perish they're not
[1:10:16] the Garment that God's been given Then I
[1:10:19] then I hope that would give you the
[1:10:20] wisdom to say then Lord take it from me
[1:10:23] whether it's the cares of the world or
[1:10:25] false religion or anything like that
[1:10:27] what we want is to have the will of God
[1:10:29] in our lives
[1:10:33] um and be moved and used by
[1:10:41] him ask the musicians if they would
[1:10:52] come
[1:11:22] for
[1:11:52] for
[1:11:57] Saints I hope that the word has dealt
[1:12:00] with your hearts I pray for me I I
[1:12:02] desire the Lord would have a a greater
[1:12:04] portion for me as we read this
[1:12:07] quote it's not believe the Lord
[1:12:11] can take us higher I believe he has a
[1:12:14] greater portion for
[1:12:17] us you're willing to say I accept Jesus
[1:12:19] as my personal savior I'll quit my bad
[1:12:22] habits but come down to the Jordan where
[1:12:25] you have to die out where all the things
[1:12:27] of this world all your friends and
[1:12:29] everything has forsaken you keep your
[1:12:32] eye on him
[1:12:33] alone then what he
[1:12:36] said I'm going to go with you right
[1:12:38] through Jordan amen I like that why I'm
[1:12:41] going to be a witness of this and he
[1:12:44] passed through Jordan notice here it is
[1:12:46] I want you to get it after he crossed
[1:12:49] Jordan he said what will you that I do
[1:12:51] for you that's what Christ wants to know
[1:12:54] of the church tonight after you're
[1:12:56] separated from the things of the world
[1:12:58] after you become a new creature in
[1:13:00] Christ Jesus after you're born again
[1:13:03] filled with the Holy Ghost crossed over
[1:13:05] Jordan all the things of the world is
[1:13:07] dead behind you now ask what can I do
[1:13:10] for you I like this he said that a
[1:13:14] double portion of your spirit come upon
[1:13:17] me that preacher knowed what he was
[1:13:20] talking about a double portion because I
[1:13:23] want to witness that much more he said
[1:13:26] you've asked a hard thing but if you see
[1:13:29] me when I go away it shall be what you
[1:13:32] ask you shall have my brother you talk
[1:13:35] about a preacher watching another one he
[1:13:37] was really watching them that's what the
[1:13:40] church ought to be doing tonight for a
[1:13:42] double portion of the spirit is watching
[1:13:44] Christ watching the Holy Ghost the way
[1:13:47] it moves notice he said you've asked a
[1:13:51] hard thing but he couldn't keep one eye
[1:13:53] on the the world and one eye on Elisha
[1:13:56] he had to put both eyes straight on
[1:13:58] Elisha and follow
[1:14:00] him
[1:14:02] amen the trouble of it is tonight we got
[1:14:05] too many Christian people profession
[1:14:07] Christians got one eye on the world and
[1:14:10] the other one on the cross you'll fall
[1:14:13] as sure as the world let your eye be
[1:14:15] single let your heart be single let your
[1:14:19] thoughts be single amen God bless you
[1:14:25] go play something

[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:17:03] there was a quote I I didn't find it I
[1:17:06] had a lot in it a lot that spoke to me
[1:17:09] brother brandom said a young girl come
[1:17:11] up to him she had warts on her legs and
[1:17:14] I could imagine if she was even in that
[1:17:16] audience when he was saying that there
[1:17:18] was an embarrassment there was an
[1:17:19] approach to that said he picked her up
[1:17:21] and he' prayed with her he said the Lord
[1:17:25] was wanting to get her before the cares
[1:17:28] of the world that hardened her heart and
[1:17:30] choked it out I thought oh lord it's
[1:17:32] such a tender age you wanted there was a
[1:17:35] necessity to get there and make sure
[1:17:37] that your spirit was able to touch the
[1:17:40] child and have her get to know you
[1:17:42] before the cares of the life what effect
[1:17:45] has this world had on me that I'm not
[1:17:47] aware
[1:17:48] of what has the cares done what are the
[1:17:51] things that I've seen caused that I I
[1:17:54] don't even know of David even prayed for
[1:17:56] the iniquity he knew not but Lord I'm
[1:18:00] convinced that there's a greater reality
[1:18:02] that body's calling there's a reflection
[1:18:03] of you I've got to manifest and if it's
[1:18:06] because there's been the devil sprayed a
[1:18:09] little pesticide on me he stunted the
[1:18:11] growth Lord you're the one who can cure
[1:18:13] it I want my heart to be single Lord I
[1:18:16] want to be purified by you I want to be
[1:18:18] found in your
[1:18:19] image I just fellowshipped with you
[1:18:23] those things you know the Lord dealt
[1:18:26] with my heart I thought I was going
[1:18:28] through a sickness that could have even
[1:18:30] been terminal um just even a week ago I
[1:18:33] was losing my strength and would uh
[1:18:36] almost faint didn't have the the
[1:18:39] strength that it would just they put me
[1:18:40] on antibiotics and things are better
[1:18:43] they're still wanting to do imaging and
[1:18:44] things like that you know they found in
[1:18:46] the process of trying to find why David
[1:18:49] was acting so weak

[1:19:30] eye to be single pray for our pastor and
[1:19:33] uh God bless you
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:40] all
[1:19:42] amen amen isn't that
[1:19:45] wonderful that's our heart's
[1:19:47] desire you
[1:19:49] know the word of God is given us to us
[1:19:53] for us to overcome with it it it's not
[1:19:56] something that's given to scare us or
[1:19:59] it's something that we we can enjoy and
[1:20:02] partake of it and know that we're going
[1:20:04] to have Victory you know I was thinking
[1:20:06] even as our brother was speaking I the
[1:20:09] the scripture
[1:20:11] speaks in Psalm 17 and verse1 15 it says
[1:20:16] as for me I will Behold thy face in
[1:20:20] righteousness I shall be satisfied when
[1:20:23] I awake in thy
[1:20:26] likeness you you you keep looking at it
[1:20:29] you keep partaking of it you keep
[1:20:33] standing there every moment every hour
[1:20:36] your eyes Focus to it it will bring
[1:20:39] about the change that's no question
[1:20:43] that's not something you can Wonder you
[1:20:45] stay with it with the word and it will
[1:20:48] you know I was thinking in in the
[1:20:50] technology world we have this word we
[1:20:53] say this word is called a sprit a split
[1:20:56] brain condition and that happens when
[1:20:59] one part is doing one thing and another
[1:21:01] part is doing
[1:21:03] another as Christians we can't we can't
[1:21:06] be like that we can't we can't try to
[1:21:09] please the world and I mean it's amazing
[1:21:12] the scripture is so plain but every day
[1:21:15] that's the fight we fight to try to mix
[1:21:17] them both and try to make the world work
[1:21:20] and try to make Christianity work and I
[1:21:22] mean we feel like there's somehow a way
[1:21:25] we can combine the two and get it
[1:21:27] working while the scripture says you
[1:21:30] cannot do it it's not going to
[1:21:33] produce Oh I thought just just to just
[1:21:36] come with the singleness of heart if the
[1:21:39] word of God is true and the only way we
[1:21:42] prove it to be true is when you put
[1:21:44] everything in
[1:21:46] it yes it's not when you come testing it
[1:21:51] and trying to find well well if if it's
[1:21:53] true then I'll go no it's when you have
[1:21:56] cut out everything you have no other
[1:21:59] option it's either the word or I die
[1:22:02] that's when it
[1:22:04] works it's not when you know you're
[1:22:07] probing and trying to figure out God he
[1:22:09] wants all of you he wants all of us he
[1:22:12] wants everything he wants every part of
[1:22:14] us he wants us to believe they until
[1:22:18] every unbelief in US is taken away and
[1:22:21] it's not to us for us to go take it away
[1:22:24] his word takes it away out of
[1:22:27] us but the way is to stay there to
[1:22:31] continually partake of the word of God
[1:22:33] and let it cleanse us let it wash us let
[1:22:36] it bring us into the image of the
[1:22:39] perfect son but if we are here today we
[1:22:42] go partake here tomorrow we do if
[1:22:44] there's no singleness of hearts and
[1:22:46] singleness of eye to be able to make
[1:22:48] sure thy eye is single th heart is
[1:22:50] single to the word
[1:22:54] is not going to produce what it promised
[1:22:56] it will be like what our brother talked
[1:22:58] about something is choking it causing it
[1:23:02] not to produce
[1:23:03] 100% my heart desire is if I'm producing
[1:23:06] 10% Lord let me produce 20 let me move
[1:23:10] up to 30 let me move out until I get to
[1:23:13] 100% because your word can do more than
[1:23:16] I can even think or imagine and if we
[1:23:19] can partake of it it's here to produce
[1:23:22] what it promise there's going to be a
[1:23:24] bride in the last day there's nothing
[1:23:26] that's going to stop that if God said
[1:23:28] there will be a bride there's going to
[1:23:29] be a bride whether we want it we don't
[1:23:32] want it whether we believe it we don't
[1:23:34] believe it somebody is going to produce
[1:23:36] that why because it's the word of God
[1:23:38] it's the reality of God our gracious
[1:23:41] father we're so thankful for your word
[1:23:43] oh God
[1:23:44] and Father you truly spoke to
[1:23:49] us Lord Jesus every once in a while it's
[1:23:53] we like to just do our own inventory and
[1:23:56] just weigh ourselves oh God and to see
[1:24:00] if we getting lacks or if we we are
[1:24:04] being drained or being taken away or a
[1:24:07] detour by the things of the world or our
[1:24:10] Focus gets taken away a little bit Lord
[1:24:13] father we want to focus on you Lord and
[1:24:17] and as our brother said Lord your word
[1:24:20] is here to give us everything we have
[1:24:22] need of Lord we don't have to look at in
[1:24:25] somebody else's field or to look away
[1:24:28] somewhere far father father we Look to
[1:24:30] You Lord the author and the finisher of
[1:24:33] our faith and the one who said that he
[1:24:35] that started the work he will finish it
[1:24:38] and the one who said that I'll be with
[1:24:40] you even in You Until the End Lord
[1:24:43] there's no condition to difficult
[1:24:45] there's no situation to complicated the
[1:24:48] enemy is try is the one who tries to
[1:24:50] throw all those complications into to
[1:24:52] the mix but father we know that you have
[1:24:55] a word that can come and make a way
[1:24:57] clean and and and take unrighteousness
[1:25:00] that we were in and take us out of it
[1:25:03] and make it righteous oh God and and
[1:25:05] make a way so we could come and worship
[1:25:08] you so we can come and and and be
[1:25:10] partakers of your divine nature and be
[1:25:12] changed in the image of your perfect son
[1:25:16] Lord we desire that more than anything
[1:25:18] Lord and that your word may do the work
[1:25:21] in US Lord your your scripture says that
[1:25:24] your word has the power of
[1:25:26] transformation that it will come and and
[1:25:29] and and it will bring out of us the
[1:25:31] things which you have promised it will
