[45:27] go out of here at different people Lord
[45:29] and you said that rapturing Faith was is
[45:32] was in this message and we believe it
[45:35] Lord and not only that but you said that
[45:37] every Divine promise Lord that you made
[45:40] Lord was in your word that we could
[45:42] partake of it and never be the same want
[45:45] to commit this Gathering into your hands

[45:51] you be with them oh God and we commited

[45:56] way and speak to us we love you and we
[45:59] ask those things in the name of the Lord
[46:00] Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you
[46:04] let's turn our
[46:05] Bibles uh for scripture reading amen I
[46:10] trust you enjoy the word this morning
[46:13] amen it
[46:15] certainly uh I was telling with Matthew
[46:18] in the back I said this is the promise
[46:20] for our time in fact I feel like it
[46:22] would just fit very well with the same
[46:25] things we were talking about about
[46:27] possessing our Promised Land Deuteronomy
[46:30] chapter 1 let's read verse 6 and 7 and 8
[46:34] um and then you'll be
[46:36] seated it
[46:38] said the Lord Our God has spoken unto us
[46:42] in
[46:43] horb
[46:45] saying ye have dwelt long enough in this
[46:53] mount it says turn ye and take your
[46:56] journey
[46:58] and go to the Mount of the amorites and
[47:02] unto the place n unto there unto in the
[47:06] plains in the plain and in the hills and
[47:09] in the valley and in the South by the
[47:11] sea to the land of the Canaanites and
[47:14] unto the unto Lebanon unto the Great
[47:18] River and the river
[47:20] Euphrates it says behold I have set I
[47:24] have set the land before you go in and
[47:28] possess the land which the Lord swear
[47:30] unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and
[47:33] Jacob to give unto them and their seed
[47:36] after them we ask for the lord to bless
[47:39] his word you may have your
[47:45] seats I was reflecting on some of the
[47:47] things that were saiding this morning
[47:52] and and I'll just mention a few because
[47:55] I feel like when we say possessing our
[47:57] Promised Land what is it exactly that
[48:00] we're trying to Pro
[48:01] possess and this the end time message is
[48:05] our Promised
[48:06] Land it it
[48:08] really uh tells us what is it that
[48:12] belongs to us and in fact I was thinking
[48:16] about it if you really think it's not a
[48:19] new word but it's the original word it's
[48:23] not a new message but it's the very
[48:25] original message that God intended from
[48:28] the very beginning the prophet will say
[48:31] that the hardest thing that God has ever
[48:35] had to do is to get one model to believe
[48:40] another you you you think about that
[48:44] and guarding the human flesh has always
[48:47] been a
[48:48] controversy it's easy to believe God in
[48:51] heaven because everybody does that it's
[48:54] easy to believe that God was in Jesus
[48:58] Jesus we could see by the works that he
[49:01] did but the prophet will take it and he
[49:04] will say but if you were there in that
[49:06] time you wouldn't believe the same as
[49:09] you believe today in other word if you
[49:12] think you're going to believe him just
[49:14] because you read the text if you saw it
[49:16] face to face it was going to be a
[49:18] challenge for you
[49:20] too so it's easy for us to come today
[49:24] and in fact the scripture will say be
[49:27] behold I lay in Zion and stumbling block
[49:29] in a rock of offense and he will say
[49:32] bless is is he that is not offending me
[49:35] every time that the word of God takes
[49:37] flesh is always an offense for
[49:40] people people always misunderstood it
[49:43] because every time it never comes in the
[49:46] way like we heard it this morning that
[49:48] people expect it to come and I'll say
[49:51] this it's only given to the elect to see
[49:55] God in flesh
[49:58] amen it's only given to the elect the
[50:02] ability to see God in flesh when God
[50:05] makes a
[50:07] transition when he changes from one form
[50:10] to another when he turns the corner
[50:14] people are left
[50:16] behind people get caught in the
[50:18] tradition they get caught in the way the
[50:21] old way of doing things and I wouldn't
[50:23] even say this yet we are sitting here
[50:25] tonight saying oh we believe this
[50:27] do we really see it for what it is and I
[50:30] think that's a question we have to ask
[50:31] ourselves we can say thank God we've
[50:33] seen God In the Flesh and we seen God in
[50:36] the man yeah but remember the promise
[50:38] was not so we could just sit here and
[50:40] talk about how God was in the
[50:46] messenger because the goal was that what
[50:49] he did he was going to do it in you the
[50:52] promise was what he did there because
[50:54] remember the prophet didn't just come in
[50:56] lay all of this foundation work and all
[50:59] of this and so we can know how God can
[51:02] use a man and all of those things no God
[51:05] was
[51:05] condescending God wanted the says God
[51:09] desire from the beginning he wanted to
[51:11] be flesh he wanted to be in a human
[51:17] flesh if we can see it in the prophet I
[51:19] think that's wonderful and I think we
[51:22] should because with the vindications
[51:24] that we have seen with this message
[51:26] there's no no way you couldn't see
[51:28] that but do you see him in you do you
[51:31] see him in your neighbor do you see him
[51:34] in the person sitting next to
[51:36] you that's where the offense comes
[51:39] because now we the prophet we could read
[51:43] based on the text we read and we know
[51:45] some of the things he done and we are
[51:47] happy about it and we see oh my what
[51:50] that's wonderful but if you were to go
[51:52] to bed with that person and wake up with
[51:55] them and know all of the fault and
[51:56] everything would you still believe that
[51:59] God is in that
[52:04] man you know you ask Paul you know in
[52:07] the scripture says you know some of the
[52:10] people that were with him just woke up
[52:11] and say I don't know about
[52:14] ask they had
[52:18] questions so God has always set it that
[52:21] way so that only the elect will see the
[52:25] disciples stood there and he came butam
[52:28] says they came there were so many of
[52:29] them they came and over they came and he
[52:32] said if you don't eat my flesh and drink
[52:34] my blood
[52:35] oh it says well help all the
[52:38] intellectuals they left because it
[52:40] didn't make any sense to eat somebody's
[52:43] flesh and drink the blood unless you a
[52:47] vampire and then there was some 80 that
[52:49] was left and then he will say some more
[52:52] until there were the 12 and then he
[52:54] looks at them and says why don't you go
[52:56] also why are you here I tell you they
[52:59] didn't stay because of any human
[53:01] knowledge they had because he had
[53:04] already wipe all of them out they looked
[53:07] at him they said we don't understand but
[53:09] one thing we know is you have the words
[53:12] of eternal
[53:13] life and if you're going to follow this
[53:16] gospel you have to come to the same
[53:18] conclusion I don't understand everything
[53:20] I don't know how is God going to be made
[53:22] flesh I don't know what he's going to do
[53:24] I don't know how he wants to do but one
[53:27] thing I know is this is the word of
[53:29] eternal
[53:33] life so when he turns a
[53:37] corner to worship the god of history is
[53:40] not a
[53:42] problem we nobody has ever been offended
[53:45] if you talk to them about Jesus 2,000
[53:47] years
[53:49] ago they'll gladly receive
[53:52] him but to talk about Jesus today that's
[53:56] that's where the offense comes but I
[53:58] don't want to say this the the most
[54:01] important part then becomes a god of
[54:04] history is not really relevant until
[54:08] that God can be this God today to
[54:11] believe a god of History it would not
[54:13] help
[54:14] you unless that same God can be the God
[54:17] today unless it's the same God who can
[54:20] touch you and heal you today unless it's
[54:22] the same God who can deliver you unless
[54:24] it's a God you can call upon so what
[54:27] makes him the same is the fact that what
[54:29] he did yesterday he can do
[54:31] today so we don't want to just gather
[54:34] and talk about God in the sense of a
[54:37] history of what he did without the
[54:40] understanding that is here doing the
[54:42] same
[54:48] thing but when I'm speaks it says in the
[54:52] message proving his word
[54:57] paragraph
[55:01] 135 he says now we say he's raised from
[55:05] the dead it says I didn't say that the
[55:07] word say the word here says it they said
[55:11] he raised from the he raised from the
[55:13] dead and is the same yesterday today and
[55:15] forever he says you believe that he's he
[55:18] says he's promised these things to
[55:20] happen in the last day the the same son
[55:23] of man will be manifested it says now
[55:26] now
[55:28] remember he says now remember this is
[55:31] the one preach on 08:16 proving his word
[55:35] 64816 it says paragraph 136 it says now
[55:40] remember that was not Jesus talking to
[55:44] Abraham there now I thought this was so
[55:47] wonderful that was not Jesus talking to
[55:49] Abraham there it says it says that could
[55:52] discern the thoughts of Sarah's mind
[55:54] behind him it says that was not Jesus it
[55:57] says he had not yet been born but it was
[56:01] a man in a human flesh and let me say
[56:05] this because this becomes very important
[56:07] because every time people every time
[56:09] they we talk about the son of man people
[56:12] have the imagery of the person of Jesus
[56:15] Christ who walked the Flesh and
[56:17] everything and every time you do that
[56:19] it's going to get you
[56:21] confused because he's saying that this
[56:23] person this human he says he came in the
[56:27] time of Abraham it wasn't Jesus because
[56:29] he was not born yet but there was that
[56:31] person that came to Jesus we call him
[56:34] MDC he came and he was manifested and I
[56:37] say MDC came and he was in the time of
[56:40] Jesus he said he became Jesus Christ but
[56:42] he was talking about that person of the
[56:44] word it says it was not Abraham called
[56:47] him Elohim the great Almighty showing he
[56:51] said and and Jesus said as it was in the
[56:54] days of Sodom now watch closly in the
[56:57] day of Sodom so will it be in the coming
[56:59] of the son of man when the son of man is
[57:01] being revealed it says it says uh not uh
[57:06] not no more as a church see not no more
[57:10] the bride is called it says in the day
[57:13] the son of man will be revealed what to
[57:16] join the church to the Head unite the
[57:21] marriage the marriage of the Bride the
[57:24] bridegroom called will come right
[57:28] through this remember that the son of it
[57:31] says the son of man will come down and
[57:34] and it said it will it will come down
[57:37] and come in a human flesh to unite the
[57:40] two together the church has to be the
[57:44] word he is the word and the two United
[57:47] together and to that it will take the
[57:50] manifestation of the revealing of the
[57:53] son of man now because why is it so
[57:56] important that we know about the son of
[57:58] man because it's the time for the union
[58:02] the son of man is coming the
[58:03] manifestation is so that we can become
[58:06] one with the word is so we can be United
[58:09] with the word is so the bridegroom can
[58:12] come and be manifested because he saying
[58:14] that it's a time for the union together
[58:16] he said not a clergy I don't know he
[58:18] says do you see what I mean it's the son
[58:21] of man Jesus Christ will come down in a
[58:24] human flesh Among Us and he will make
[58:27] his word so real that he will unite that
[58:30] he will unite the church and him as one
[58:34] the
[58:35] bride Jesus Christ making his word so
[58:39] real telling you about where you came
[58:41] from telling you about how you got here
[58:44] making it so real that in your mind you
[58:46] wouldn't have any question that you will
[58:49] be United with him that the part of you
[58:51] as will say in the time where flesh is
[58:54] becoming word are you uniting with the
[58:57] bridegroom so you can be
[59:00] one and then she will go home with a W
[59:04] to the wedding supper amen he saying
[59:07] that she's already United see we go to
[59:10] the wedding supper not the marriage it
[59:13] says fill your flesh it f said the Flesh
[59:17] of of Mighty Man it says cause the
[59:19] marriage of the Lamb has come but but
[59:22] but the Rapture is going the Rapture is
[59:26] going to the wedding supper when the
[59:28] word oh I love this the word it says
[59:32] when the word here unites with a person
[59:35] and they to become one and then what
[59:39] does that do what does that do then in
[59:42] manifest the son of man
[59:47] again the word in the prophet son of man
[59:51] the word in you son of
[59:55] man you know there are days where I woke
[59:57] up I you know I stretch I say man the
[59:59] son of man have a lot of work to do
[1:00:01] today you know my wife laughs at me you
[1:00:05] know we are the son of man it's you the
[1:00:09] son of man it's God in you makes you the
[1:00:12] son of man why it's the word uniting
[1:00:15] with you it's you uniting with that part
[1:00:18] of you that was in the beginning so you
[1:00:20] can become one it's new it's you knowing
[1:00:23] what you were made for what you were
[1:00:24] created how you got here it's you going
[1:00:28] back to the original position that God
[1:00:30] intended for you to be it's not a
[1:00:32] mystery and it's not something that we
[1:00:34] have to be scared of this is us this is
[1:00:44] you but when I'm will say in the
[1:00:50] breach he yeah he was there was a
[1:00:53] promise that he would be coming as a son
[1:00:55] of man
[1:00:56] and he came to the
[1:00:59] Jews and we understand that as a Son of
[1:01:03] God that was throughout the church ages
[1:01:06] because Son of God is spirit so
[1:01:09] throughout the seven Church ages and but
[1:01:12] the next coming that was in line was for
[1:01:14] him to come as son of David King but he
[1:01:17] said but in between the son of the the
[1:01:21] Son of God and the son of David that he
[1:01:24] was to come again but this time it was
[1:01:27] to specifically come for the Gentile
[1:01:30] because they didn't get access when it
[1:01:32] came the first time but we promised what
[1:01:35] he did for the Jews that he was going to
[1:01:36] do to the Gentile so we can come and see
[1:01:40] that same manifestation but to do what
[1:01:43] the same thing that he did when he came
[1:01:45] to Abraham he's doing with
[1:01:49] you why is he doing that so we don't sit
[1:01:52] here and just talk about stories so we
[1:01:55] can know the real God who is he from the
[1:01:58] beginning what did he created us for why
[1:02:00] are we sitting here for how did we get
[1:02:02] here he's here to bring you back in our
[1:02:05] orinal
[1:02:15] condition he says in the rising of the
[1:02:17] sun paragraph 93 says
[1:02:21] Now who is the son of man
[1:02:28] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:02:31] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:02:36] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:02:39] Among
[1:02:41] Us the word made flesh is the son of
[1:02:45] man the word when the word unites with
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:50] individual you are partaking of that
[1:02:52] same promise oh I love this that's why
[1:02:56] we can't come here and just lay it on
[1:02:58] the prophet and just say well he was a
[1:03:00] prophet he was born with a gift you know
[1:03:02] the say it said that God took the word
[1:03:06] and when Jesus came and said he was the
[1:03:08] most gifted person that there was but he
[1:03:11] knew that not all of us will be as
[1:03:13] gifted as he was so he takes and he does
[1:03:16] it by the word so we can do it by the
[1:03:21] word and I want to say this this is what
[1:03:24] we are partaking of this is when when I
[1:03:27] speak about our promised land this is
[1:03:29] what we are talking about it's the
[1:03:31] revealed message of the yah and I want
[1:03:33] to say this I know as we sit here
[1:03:36] without a doubt we could certainly say
[1:03:37] that God has revealed himself in this
[1:03:41] message this message is not the message
[1:03:43] of brother brandham this message is God
[1:03:46] himself we we could certainly say that I
[1:03:49] don't believe that we have any questions
[1:03:51] about this being God we we again we've
[1:03:54] passed those stages there could be those
[1:03:56] that are doubting that's fine but as we
[1:03:59] sit here tonight I believe that whatever
[1:04:01] the question is whatever you are
[1:04:03] whatever your situation is you do not
[1:04:06] question that this message came from
[1:04:10] God we we we can certainly say that we
[1:04:14] we have look we are looking at the
[1:04:16] promise that God made becoming a reality
[1:04:20] in our
[1:04:22] midst we we we can certainly say that
[1:04:25] The Works that were done by the
[1:04:28] manifestation that was God that did it
[1:04:30] it was God who Vindicated his Prophet
[1:04:33] it's God who sent the message and is God
[1:04:35] here making his message
[1:04:39] true we we can look at it and say this
[1:04:43] message was not given in the form of or
[1:04:46] for us to form some religious community
[1:04:49] to just have another church and say oh
[1:04:51] we are the message Believers we we are
[1:04:54] here uh you know we don't belong in a
[1:04:56] denomination but we have our own group
[1:04:58] we're going to C ourselves message belie
[1:05:00] no it wasn't given for that intent but
[1:05:02] this is the message that as as John will
[1:05:06] say that which was in the beginning that
[1:05:09] which our hands has handled that which
[1:05:11] we knew from the father this is it that
[1:05:13] we're talking
[1:05:17] about it brought to us the reality of
[1:05:20] the Living God who God is how to
[1:05:23] approach him how did go operates in our
[1:05:27] relationship with him it's the the
[1:05:30] prophet will say it's the perfect came
[1:05:33] to tie the loose hands so it could
[1:05:35] present to us the perfect
[1:05:39] picture of what God intended from the
[1:05:52] beginning Joshua will say in Joshua 1
[1:05:57] the scripture will
[1:06:12] say now after the death of Moses my
[1:06:20] servant after the death of Moses the
[1:06:22] servant of the Lord it says it came to
[1:06:25] pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the
[1:06:27] son of num it says Moses uh Moses
[1:06:31] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:06:35] now therefore arise and go over this
[1:06:38] Jordan it says that that that that thou
[1:06:41] and all the all these people and unto
[1:06:44] the land which I I do give to them even
[1:06:48] the children of Israel every place that
[1:06:51] the soul of your foot shall thread upon
[1:06:54] I have given it unto you and as I as I
[1:06:58] said unto Moses from the Wilderness from
[1:07:01] the Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto
[1:07:04] the Great Rivers the river Euphrates and
[1:07:07] all the lands of the heads sites and
[1:07:09] unto the great sea towards the uh the
[1:07:11] going down of the sun it says shall be
[1:07:14] your Coast it says there shall not a
[1:07:19] man listen to this there shall not any
[1:07:23] man be able to stand before thee
[1:07:28] all the days of thy life and as I was
[1:07:32] with Moses so will I be with thee I will
[1:07:35] not fail thee nor forsake thee oh I I
[1:07:39] could just take this and interpret it in
[1:07:41] quotes after quotes after quotes after
[1:07:43] quotes didn't brother Ram says the my
[1:07:46] ever never failing presence will always
[1:07:48] go before you behold I have sent an
[1:07:51] angel before you what did he do all of
[1:07:53] that so we can know the L is real why
[1:07:56] did Brother manifest the things that we
[1:07:59] say all of the things that we have seen
[1:08:01] so we know that the land is real and let
[1:08:03] me just jump ahead when he sent the
[1:08:05] spice to go over the purpose was not to
[1:08:08] go examine and see how hard the land was
[1:08:12] the scripture says that go and taste of
[1:08:15] the land and see if it's real it wasn't
[1:08:18] to go and say what the Giants that were
[1:08:20] in the land were it was for them to
[1:08:23] taste of the fruits to taste of the
[1:08:25] healing of the land to test of the
[1:08:27] Salvation of the land to test of the
[1:08:30] goodness of the land and say the land is
[1:08:32] real and if the land is real the rest is
[1:08:34] up to
[1:08:36] God but guess what they go and some all
[1:08:40] they saw was the
[1:08:42] challenges well didn't he say I have
[1:08:44] given you the land so if there are any
[1:08:47] challenges if there is sickness and if
[1:08:49] there's anything isn't he the one who
[1:08:51] gave you the land and you tasted it and
[1:08:53] you say it was good isn't it capable of
[1:08:56] taking care of those
[1:09:01] challenges we we we tend to become very
[1:09:04] intellectual with this
[1:09:07] message and and my heart desire and I
[1:09:10] want to just say it I I I if I could
[1:09:14] just live by what I know
[1:09:16] today if I could just live a life that's
[1:09:19] worthy of what I know now that will be
[1:09:22] enough for me
[1:09:26] we know God Is A Healer we know God is a
[1:09:28] provider we know all of those thing but
[1:09:31] yet we are challenged when the challenge
[1:09:33] comes we run off and we try to provide
[1:09:35] for ourselves we try to do all those
[1:09:37] things yet the word is here it says I
[1:09:39] Told You Be not Afraid don't run off
[1:09:42] stay with it stay with it stay with me
[1:09:45] well I I said it and I will bring it to
[1:09:47] pass
[1:09:56] so as you read this one of the things
[1:09:59] you understand that God never really
[1:10:02] changed what the purpose of the
[1:10:04] commission was so what he's telling what
[1:10:07] he's telling Joshua to do is the
[1:10:10] continuation of what he told Moses so
[1:10:12] when he comes he's saying and he's not
[1:10:14] telling him well Moses is gone now I
[1:10:17] want you guys to take a different
[1:10:21] direction and that's what's happening in
[1:10:23] this message the prophet is gone now
[1:10:26] everybody has their own Doctrine now
[1:10:28] everybody has their own way of seeing
[1:10:30] it everybody becomes all of the sudden
[1:10:33] the next
[1:10:35] Prophet everybody all of the sudden gets
[1:10:38] a revelation that it's no longer the
[1:10:40] prophet it's
[1:10:42] them it there was nothing that changed
[1:10:45] because the message was not the message
[1:10:47] of Moses the message was the meage
[1:10:50] message of God he says as I was with
[1:10:54] Moses so will I be with you now remember
[1:10:57] if you read further down whether the
[1:10:59] condition was that this book of law will
[1:11:02] not depart from thy mouth so you repeat
[1:11:05] what Moses said you do what Moses did
[1:11:07] and as I was with him so will I be with
[1:11:10] you you abandon Moses God is no longer
[1:11:13] with
[1:11:17] you we're not making a new way we
[1:11:21] following the same way we're not going
[1:11:24] in our own Direction we're following the
[1:11:26] Holy Spirit we're not making new
[1:11:29] discoveries no the word is unfolding
[1:11:32] before us what was promised is what we
[1:11:34] are seeing if what we're seeing is not
[1:11:37] what was promised we're not going to go
[1:11:39] in that
[1:11:43] direction but one them will say in the
[1:11:45] message the great warrior uh uh Joshua
[1:11:49] paragraph 38 it says now when Joshua oh
[1:11:52] I love this it says when Joshua was over
[1:11:56] over there talking uh walking around and
[1:11:59] and walking around and here he crossed
[1:12:01] over Jordan he says he began to eat some
[1:12:04] old corn he says and I can imagine
[1:12:07] Joshua that morning after having that
[1:12:10] great vision it says of the Lord saying
[1:12:12] I'll be with you just as I was with
[1:12:15] Moses so will I be with you it says
[1:12:17] called him out one night and said now
[1:12:21] look Joshua he says they give him a
[1:12:23] vision and said now my servant Moses is
[1:12:26] dead rise and go over Jordan it says
[1:12:29] Thou and the host of Israel and the Lord
[1:12:32] thy God thy God will be with thee he
[1:12:35] says no man shall stand before thee all
[1:12:38] the days of thy life as I was with Moses
[1:12:41] so will I be with you only be of be good
[1:12:44] courage and do not uh uh be discouraged
[1:12:47] just keep moving on I'll be with you it
[1:12:50] says in every place you set your soul of
[1:12:53] your fi is your Poss uh uh your feet as
[1:12:56] a possession for you it says footprint
[1:12:59] means
[1:13:01] Possession It says brother what the
[1:13:04] church needs today what the church needs
[1:13:07] tonight is some
[1:13:09] Footprints over here in this land I said
[1:13:12] hey man what we need is just footprint
[1:13:16] what we need is just to know what did
[1:13:18] malachite 4 said about the bride in the
[1:13:20] end time what did God promise about this
[1:13:22] end time and take footprints on it and
[1:13:25] just go stand on it and just begin to
[1:13:27] stand on it he says don't hang around
[1:13:30] the Jordan too long let's get out of
[1:13:32] here and see what we got all right he
[1:13:36] says every time that he had to make a
[1:13:38] footprint he says every time that he he
[1:13:41] footprinted on it was a possession it
[1:13:44] says I can see Joshua after he had had
[1:13:47] the vision it says now gather all Israel
[1:13:50] and Stand Down by the by the Jordan
[1:13:53] sanctify yourself watch your clothes it
[1:13:56] says and come down to its banks in the
[1:13:58] morning and I will show you what what
[1:14:01] I'll show you what the glory of God is
[1:14:03] amen he had a
[1:14:05] vision what we like is a
[1:14:09] vision oh if God can give us a vision of
[1:14:12] what this message is if we can come and
[1:14:15] take the vision of this message if we
[1:14:18] can know that the God the same God who
[1:14:20] created heaven and earth is the one who
[1:14:22] send this message to us if we can know
[1:14:25] this message is the vision of the Lord
[1:14:27] regarding your life this message is God
[1:14:30] showing you his vision what he intends
[1:14:33] to do with you how that he brought you
[1:14:35] out of sin all of those things if we can
[1:14:37] just see it's his vision being made
[1:14:39] manifest to
[1:14:41] us because the moment Joshua understood
[1:14:44] that he had no
[1:14:46] fear he stood there you know the Lord
[1:14:50] with me the god of Moses the one who
[1:14:52] parted the Red Sea the one who did those
[1:14:55] great signs and wonders he says if he
[1:14:57] the same God with me I'm going oh I tell
[1:15:01] you God is looking for the same people
[1:15:03] tonight he's looking for people that
[1:15:05] said the God that was with Malachi 4 The
[1:15:09] God Who came and opened the seals The
[1:15:11] God Who came and Vindicated himself and
[1:15:14] he did all the sign and wonders his ear
[1:15:16] is looking for people to say if it's the
[1:15:19] same God I'm walking with him
[1:15:25] God told him in his
[1:15:29] word and he says the word said I have
[1:15:33] given you the land it's
[1:15:35] yours it's your
[1:15:39] possession oh
[1:15:42] my you
[1:15:44] know one of the things before somebody
[1:15:47] can sell you something they have to sell
[1:15:49] you a
[1:15:51] vision if you ever go and somebody Nam
[1:15:55] on you go to those car salesman my
[1:15:58] goodness they're going to let you know
[1:15:59] that you need every function every
[1:16:01] button every feature in that car oh this
[1:16:05] over here is just the seat the memory
[1:16:07] seat so you press it it just
[1:16:09] automatically does that you're like oh I
[1:16:11] need that this over here when you press
[1:16:14] it it does this oh yeah I need that this
[1:16:17] over here you can flip over here and it
[1:16:19] will do this oh I need that and you
[1:16:21] could buy a car and never use any of
[1:16:23] those features
[1:16:28] right but yet we are given a book full
[1:16:31] of pictures everything that you have
[1:16:33] need of it's in here everything that you
[1:16:36] whatever you going to encounter in the
[1:16:38] way it's in here but yet we are we not
[1:16:40] using the
[1:16:42] features it says I have given you the
[1:16:45] land it's yours whatever you desire and
[1:16:48] let me say this if God made a promise
[1:16:51] God is able to keep his promise
[1:16:56] but when I'm talks about Peter cwright
[1:16:58] he was sent over to go and have a
[1:17:00] Revival service and so he goes over and
[1:17:04] he's fixing the place and yeah he is
[1:17:06] working at the place and and then the
[1:17:08] bully of the Town shows up he says who
[1:17:11] ask you what are you doing here he says
[1:17:13] well I'm cleaning up so I can have
[1:17:14] service he says who told you you're
[1:17:17] going to have service here he says God
[1:17:19] told me we says well before you can have
[1:17:23] service over here you got to come
[1:17:24] through me you got to have to pass over
[1:17:26] me he says well if that's what I need to
[1:17:29] do that's the next thing I'll do he
[1:17:32] stood up and he folded his shirt and he
[1:17:33] went and he stum and he beat the guy up
[1:17:36] and he said the Lord will strengthen me
[1:17:38] and he stood up and he says is that
[1:17:39] enough he said yes and the shook hand
[1:17:41] and the guy got saved why that's someone
[1:17:44] who knew that God sent him
[1:17:47] somewhere I love that story because when
[1:17:50] he began to talk to him he didn't move
[1:17:53] he continued to scrub and butam goes in
[1:17:56] detail he continue to do what he was
[1:17:57] doing it's only after he said that you
[1:18:00] couldn't do that you have to come
[1:18:02] through me then he said okay I'm here to
[1:18:06] have a Revival and if you are on my way
[1:18:08] of Revival then I'll take care of you
[1:18:11] why because God told me I'm going to
[1:18:13] have a Revival meeting and I will have
[1:18:15] it and nothing will stop it so what we
[1:18:17] need as children of God is when God has
[1:18:20] given you a promise when God told you
[1:18:22] that I have healed you when God tells
[1:18:25] you I have delivered you when God said
[1:18:27] I'm your provider it's for us to look at
[1:18:29] the Devil and say okay now if you come
[1:18:31] on my way then it's time for me to kick
[1:18:34] you because I'm not going any way God
[1:18:36] has given me
[1:18:39] that it's easy to Proclaim great
[1:18:46] promises but yet we don't live by
[1:18:52] them but says God
[1:18:55] created men to depend on
[1:18:57] him I love that I tell you I never
[1:19:01] understood that every day I read it I
[1:19:03] get a new revelation about
[1:19:05] that God made you so you could be
[1:19:09] dependent on God on
[1:19:13] him now the world looks at that they
[1:19:16] says that's childish but God says he say
[1:19:19] that's
[1:19:21] wisdom you wake up in the morning how am
[1:19:24] I going to have my bread doesn't come
[1:19:26] from the strength of my hand my bread
[1:19:29] comes from
[1:19:31] him my good health doesn't become
[1:19:35] doesn't come from how many vitamins I
[1:19:37] take my good health comes from
[1:19:41] him my food comes from him my he's my
[1:19:45] provider in
[1:19:46] everything what the devil wants you to
[1:19:49] do is well you know I educated you you
[1:19:52] went to school you got a degree so it's
[1:19:55] by your knowledge that you get your
[1:19:57] bread from it's really not by
[1:20:03] God and says where man fails is when
[1:20:08] they're trying to achieve things without
[1:20:11] God when they go and they try to do it
[1:20:14] by themselves if he can raise the little
[1:20:18] of
[1:20:20] fish you think he doesn't know what you
[1:20:23] have need of
[1:20:26] in fact veram says when he says when he
[1:20:28] talks about that he says it shows you
[1:20:31] that he did that to show you that he
[1:20:34] cares about everything even the little
[1:20:47] things he
[1:20:51] says it says what we need I like this
[1:20:56] what we need he says you got to go you
[1:20:59] got to go do some
[1:21:01] fighting you got to go do some fighting
[1:21:04] not some not some feast and after he
[1:21:07] talks about pyra not some Feast but some
[1:21:10] but the power of God with your testimony
[1:21:14] that's how you overcome by the blood of
[1:21:16] the lamb and by your testimony tell the
[1:21:19] Devil he's got no string tied to you
[1:21:23] you've got to put this dis disase on me
[1:21:25] you you you've put this disease on me
[1:21:27] but Jesus delivered me from it he
[1:21:31] promised it to me he continues on he
[1:21:34] says brother footprint is possession
[1:21:38] ministering brother don't be afraid to
[1:21:41] put Footprints where God has told you to
[1:21:44] put them amen it's your possession he
[1:21:47] told Joshua everywhere the salt of your
[1:21:50] feet set it's yours amen paragraph 38 32
[1:21:55] sorry he says we don't back up we don't
[1:22:01] back up we take what God said that's the
[1:22:05] truth no matter what the opposition is
[1:22:09] how great it seems how difficult it is
[1:22:12] God said so it's yours it says when he
[1:22:16] give when he gave it to Joshua he never
[1:22:18] said I'll take all the Hat sites the
[1:22:21] Philistine and give it to you Joshua had
[1:22:24] to fight for every inch of ground but
[1:22:27] God was with
[1:22:31] him who's with
[1:22:34] you you know we act as if we were left
[1:22:38] alone God said okay I have giving it to
[1:22:41] you I I'm going to sit here and you just
[1:22:44] go I'll be watching from
[1:22:49] distance we live in the day where he
[1:22:51] says at that day you shall know
[1:22:55] just as I was in Christ and Christ and I
[1:22:58] I'll be in you and you in me the
[1:23:05] oness we we sing that song there's never
[1:23:08] been a day like this day
[1:23:13] what oh I tell you if the there could
[1:23:16] just be a fire within our hearts to see
[1:23:18] that this message is real if they could
[1:23:21] and let me say this not that I'm not
[1:23:23] saying that we don't believe it is real
[1:23:25] because let me say this each one in this
[1:23:27] building is a testimony of Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ how you sitting here today it's
[1:23:33] not by Your Own Strength it's a
[1:23:35] testimony of Jesus Christ oh how we can
[1:23:38] recall the joy that was when God came
[1:23:41] and took us out of sin and how he came
[1:23:43] and he paid the price for us how we open
[1:23:45] our eyes to see the things we are seeing
[1:23:48] we can never forget that every time we
[1:23:51] think about it it brings the joy in our
[1:23:53] heart because we know know we didn't
[1:23:55] make ourselves believe in everything and
[1:23:57] let me say this if he started in Joy he
[1:23:59] doesn't want to end in misery it's it
[1:24:02] starts in joy and he end in
[1:24:05] Joy he cannot do today and tomorrow he
[1:24:08] let you down no he said I'll be with you
[1:24:12] I'll continue to be with you he says
[1:24:14] just be of good courage continue to walk
[1:24:17] continue to prosper continue to go
[1:24:19] forward why as I was with Moses so will
[1:24:22] I be with you as I was with the Prophet
[1:24:24] so will I be with
[1:24:40] you and God keeps his word brother bam
[1:24:44] says paragraph 141
[1:24:56] it says if it's for re if it's for
[1:24:59] salvation if it's for Divine Healing if
[1:25:02] it's for more blessing if it's for peace
[1:25:05] if it's for
[1:25:07] anything it's it's God promise it says
[1:25:11] make footprint amen every place that the
[1:25:15] soul of your feet set that I have given
[1:25:18] it to you God promised it God keeps his
[1:25:23] word
[1:25:25] am God promised it God keeps his word it
[1:25:29] says God's word is Everlasting truth I
[1:25:34] believe it you believe it brother it's
[1:25:37] time for us to make fruit prints he says
[1:25:40] you don't stay right here and you don't
[1:25:43] stay right here in the same camp it's it
[1:25:46] the fire's moving on let's move on from
[1:25:49] the glory to glory from from from from
[1:25:53] the Bible experience to Bible experience
[1:25:56] let's unfold and open up our hearts
[1:25:58] raise up our hands to God keep saying
[1:26:02] stay in the Bible don't get outside of
[1:26:05] it stay right
[1:26:07] there he's telling you and and the
[1:26:10] reason I read this is the the trick of
[1:26:13] the enemy is for you to try to go do it
[1:26:16] on your
[1:26:17] own he will either do two things one he
[1:26:20] will say well you don't qualify for it
[1:26:24] yes the promise is real but it's not for
[1:26:27] you why is it not not for you I don't
[1:26:30] know I mean he will find anything that
[1:26:32] he can convince you by if it's what you
[1:26:35] did yesterday or what you did 10 years
[1:26:37] ago he will go dig it up well you did
[1:26:40] this so that means you don't qualify for
[1:26:43] the promise you did this that's what you
[1:26:45] don't qualify for the promise you say
[1:26:47] well the promise I'm not saying the
[1:26:49] promise is not real but it's just not
[1:26:50] for you
[1:26:57] and we fail for it every time how do we
[1:26:59] fail for it something happened W is me
[1:27:02] it must have been something I
[1:27:05] did it must be that thing I did 10 years
[1:27:08] ago it's still hunting
[1:27:12] me we do that we go back and you know we
[1:27:18] we we we we go back on everything we've
[1:27:21] ever done wrong where God said it's in
[1:27:23] the sea of forgiv
[1:27:25] foress because remember forgiveness is
[1:27:28] part of the
[1:27:29] promise it's part of what the promise is
[1:27:32] God said if you come unto me I will
[1:27:34] forgive you so if he a forgiven you it's
[1:27:37] not up to you to go dig it up or try to
[1:27:39] find out what it
[1:27:42] was he he's doing all of this to cause
[1:27:46] us to move
[1:27:48] forward he doesn't want us to stand
[1:27:50] still at one place and to continue to to
[1:27:53] stay at one place no he wants us to be
[1:27:56] moving forward in him the same God who
[1:28:00] came and took you out of sin the same
[1:28:02] God who saved you the same God is the
[1:28:04] same god pushing you and saying go
[1:28:06] forward go forward by promise the thing
[1:28:09] about it is we try to get it by
[1:28:10] knowledge we started with the promise
[1:28:13] now we want to get it by knowledge we
[1:28:15] started with Revelation now we want to
[1:28:17] add some knowledge to
[1:28:22] it he says
[1:28:26] we've got the prophet of God we've got
[1:28:29] the word of God speaking about the
[1:28:31] children of Israel we've got the angel
[1:28:33] of God he's leading this church just
[1:28:37] exactly like he led them he led in them
[1:28:40] days he says that's exactly right the
[1:28:43] word of God is before us the prophet of
[1:28:46] God the prophet of God is the Holy Ghost
[1:28:49] is the Holy Spirit the angel of God is
[1:28:52] leading the church we are moving into
[1:28:55] the pillar of fire in glory it says in
[1:28:58] the glory of God sitting together in
[1:29:02] Heavenly places in Jesus Christ now we
[1:29:04] are sons of God it says and that great
[1:29:07] Revel and the great revelation of the
[1:29:09] word of God the Holy Spirit sinks it
[1:29:12] into our hearts and bring us and uh
[1:29:15] bringing forth the tree of
[1:29:18] salvation of Salvation righteousness
[1:29:21] living love joy peace and love long
[1:29:24] suffering goodness gentleness and
[1:29:26] patience sure it
[1:29:33] is and so if that's the case then it's
[1:29:38] very important
[1:29:40] that when we have challenges that we are
[1:29:44] reminded that we have a
[1:29:49] promise the way that God wants us to
[1:29:52] come and and and get this land is to
[1:29:55] stand upon on the promise that he has
[1:29:57] given us is to stand to say that this is
[1:30:00] mine you have given me you have given me
[1:30:03] my children you have given me my family
[1:30:05] you promised that you will be with me
[1:30:07] you promised that you will walk with me
[1:30:09] here I am full of challenges God here I
[1:30:12] am he wants you to pray about it he
[1:30:14] wants you to approach it to go find in
[1:30:17] the Bible the promise that he has made
[1:30:19] and come stand upon it and claim
[1:30:22] it it has doesn't want you to go and
[1:30:25] wander and and on your own and try to
[1:30:27] figure out a way to do it no he wants
[1:30:30] you to take it and stand upon the
[1:30:32] promise and put your footprint on it and
[1:30:35] say this is mine and I'm claiming
[1:30:40] it but what I'm will say is the hypress
[1:30:43] of our confession when you do that
[1:30:45] you're giving him something that he can
[1:30:47] work with when you do that then you giv
[1:30:50] him it says that the holy spirit is the
[1:30:53] enforcer of the law when you stand up on
[1:30:56] the word of God which represented the
[1:30:58] law then the Holy Spirit has the power
[1:31:00] to go and take it for you in fact even
[1:31:03] in the fighting it's not you taking it
[1:31:05] out it's him taking it for you
[1:31:24] he
[1:31:32] says oh I love
[1:31:35] this in the rising of the
[1:31:39] sun paragraph 1 one uh
[1:31:47] 3:21 it says no wonder he says he no
[1:31:51] wonder he said fear not
[1:31:56] for now
[1:31:58] notice we are Redeemed by
[1:32:03] him and now not in the future raise and
[1:32:09] now risen with him that's what EO means
[1:32:14] to the people risen with him notice it
[1:32:18] says now we have his spirit in us the
[1:32:23] the abstract deed fully
[1:32:26] paid listen to this now he says no you
[1:32:31] don't say well I hope I make it you've
[1:32:36] already made
[1:32:39] it you don't say well I'm going to
[1:32:42] overcome you've already
[1:32:45] overcame you're not going to say well
[1:32:47] I'm going to get healed you are already
[1:32:50] healed so when you go to the very sourc
[1:32:53] of it God doesn't want you to approach
[1:32:56] it with some hop so with some uh I don't
[1:33:00] know if it's going to happen let me say
[1:33:02] this Abraham waited 25 years for the
[1:33:05] promise and the prophet said that every
[1:33:08] time the years went by Abraham Faith
[1:33:10] grew stronger why because he knew he had
[1:33:14] an understanding that God if God said he
[1:33:17] was going to have a child he will have
[1:33:19] it and the more that he will die in
[1:33:21] himself the more God will have to
[1:33:23] produce that
[1:33:26] child is that what the Bible say so what
[1:33:30] what about us if God made us a promise
[1:33:33] if God told us that we are healed if God
[1:33:36] told us we are delivered if God told us
[1:33:38] he will take care of us I don't care how
[1:33:41] long it takes the children of because
[1:33:43] remember the word was to Abraham and his
[1:33:46] seed after him the Seed of Abraham in
[1:33:49] the end time are identified as those
[1:33:52] that will look at the promise and say
[1:33:55] it's mine and I got it it's mine and
[1:33:58] there's nothing that will stop me from
[1:34:00] having it that's right they have no
[1:34:03] doubt about it there's nothing that can
[1:34:05] change the outcome because they know God
[1:34:07] already gave them so now he says you've
[1:34:10] already made it not that I will make it
[1:34:13] you've already made it I it says I never
[1:34:17] made it he made it for me oh I love that
[1:34:22] he made it for for me see not me him
[1:34:27] well brother bam say I don't care what
[1:34:30] you say there he says there he made it
[1:34:33] for me it says that's all I want it says
[1:34:37] I'm caring about I'm caring about he
[1:34:40] says I just want to see him manifested
[1:34:43] how can he do it he says call him he
[1:34:46] says call him down he says he is he is
[1:34:49] in you and he is see he is in you well
[1:34:53] then Lord he says if I can get myself
[1:34:56] out of the way you can manifest myself
[1:35:00] he said how can you do it because you
[1:35:04] ordained it
[1:35:07] so all that the father had given me will
[1:35:12] come Glory it says notice
[1:35:18] Glory the challenge we have is we try to
[1:35:21] make it
[1:35:22] ourselves if he said says you already
[1:35:24] made it it's like the disciples yeah
[1:35:27] they are
[1:35:30] and the boat is just rocking goodness
[1:35:33] and
[1:35:35] just the waves just bringing it up and
[1:35:38] down and
[1:35:40] everything you know so that they're
[1:35:44] like
[1:35:47] now how is it possible that they were
[1:35:50] going to die and he was not going to die
[1:35:52] if the Sheep went over
[1:35:57] you know if there were if if Naturally
[1:36:00] Speaking he should have been scared just
[1:36:02] as they
[1:36:04] were yeah they are caring not that we
[1:36:07] perish well if it's if they going to die
[1:36:11] obviously he was so supposed to be
[1:36:13] concerned about him
[1:36:15] dying so he stands up
[1:36:18] and he looks at them
[1:36:21] and puts his hands up and he speaks and
[1:36:24] the wave stops and everything comes down
[1:36:26] and everything
[1:36:28] and calls them ye of little faith and
[1:36:32] they looked at him they just
[1:36:35] astonished and brother bam said the word
[1:36:37] with with them was with them and they
[1:36:39] didn't even know
[1:36:46] it how many times he's with us we don't
[1:36:49] even know
[1:36:52] it he said oh we need to do is just
[1:36:54] raise him up say master I there's just a
[1:36:59] circumstance right now that I I just
[1:37:00] don't know how to deal with it there's
[1:37:03] just things happening now I don't know
[1:37:04] how to take care of it is this can you
[1:37:07] just help can you just work up I tell
[1:37:10] you says God wants to bless you more
[1:37:14] than you want to be
[1:37:16] blessed that's the quote he wants to
[1:37:19] give you the Holy Spirit more than you
[1:37:22] wanted
[1:37:24] sometimes we feel we act like we the one
[1:37:27] that really wanted and he doesn't
[1:37:30] want that's the that's Satan that's
[1:37:32] trying to make print that picture for
[1:37:34] you but the real God that we serve he
[1:37:37] wants to save you he wants to do more
[1:37:39] for you more than you can ever think
[1:37:43] because he gave his own life for you he
[1:37:45] has invested so much in you that he
[1:37:48] never want to see you perish thank oh if
[1:37:52] we can only understand the love of God
[1:37:55] that is in Jesus Christ what he had done
[1:37:58] for us we certainly will be a different
[1:38:01] people if the musician could
[1:38:19] come he says
[1:38:32] oh I love
[1:38:41] this the same Holy Spirit that's leading
[1:38:44] the church today it's the same this
[1:38:46] that's the same Holy Spirit that's
[1:38:47] leaving the church
[1:38:49] today the only thing you have to say is
[1:38:52] well is say well God tells God tells me
[1:38:56] in my heart that Jesus heals me he says
[1:39:01] this is my possession I take it and I go
[1:39:05] on it's
[1:39:06] mine and I said that's what you just
[1:39:08] have to say in your heart it says well
[1:39:11] then just go on the Holy Spirit just
[1:39:14] keeps leading you no matter how you are
[1:39:19] feeling I like
[1:39:21] that no matter how how you are
[1:39:25] feeling if you
[1:39:28] go if you go to your
[1:39:31] feelings then you are certainly going
[1:39:34] to you're going to go back you're going
[1:39:36] to go back to that every time you have a
[1:39:40] negative testimony every
[1:39:43] time that you look at your
[1:39:46] symptoms then you are falling right
[1:39:50] then there's no Christian in here here
[1:39:53] no matter how solid you are in
[1:39:58] faith if right now that you say
[1:40:02] something has happened to get a hold of
[1:40:06] you and tell you that you are not a
[1:40:09] Christian and you start out
[1:40:12] testifying well you're not a Christian
[1:40:15] no
[1:40:19] more oh I tell you and I say this this
[1:40:23] this is to show you how simple it is
[1:40:26] that you have it it's not to scare you
[1:40:28] for what you don't have but it's to show
[1:40:30] you how simple it is that you have it
[1:40:33] yes so all I need to do is just work up
[1:40:37] and testify I read the promise he told
[1:40:40] me I'm Healed the Holy Spirit told me in
[1:40:42] my heart I'm heal and that's all I'm
[1:40:43] going to go saying if he didn't tell me
[1:40:46] anything different how many times did
[1:40:48] have said well you know they they asking
[1:40:50] me to see Visions they asking me for
[1:40:52] this he said says I can't say it if it
[1:40:54] didn't tell
[1:40:58] me it says pray for the sick do this it
[1:41:01] says I can't if if God didn't show me
[1:41:04] anything I can't say it it says my own
[1:41:06] mother was dying right God didn't show
[1:41:10] me anything and I couldn't speak
[1:41:12] anything the problem is we speak our own
[1:41:15] imagination we speak what the devil is
[1:41:17] wanting us to speak no if God didn't
[1:41:20] show me I'm not going to speak it
[1:41:24] I'm only going to speak what the word
[1:41:26] tells me the word says I'm well I claim
[1:41:29] I'm well the world tells tells me that
[1:41:32] I'm good I I claim I'm good whatever the
[1:41:34] word tells me is my testimony my
[1:41:37] testimony is the word of God now
[1:41:40] remember in Leviticus the promise it
[1:41:42] says the land shall never be sold
[1:41:45] forever so in other words it doesn't
[1:41:47] matter how many circumstance will come
[1:41:50] upon you it doesn't matter how much
[1:41:52] trial will come upon you God is said
[1:41:55] that so nothing will last
[1:41:58] forever the devil can pile it up on you
[1:42:01] today I I want you to just walk and say
[1:42:05] the devil you piling up on me I might as
[1:42:07] well start rejoicing today why are you
[1:42:10] rejoicing because I know there's nothing
[1:42:12] that the devil can do that will last
[1:42:14] forever everything that he does is
[1:42:16] temporary and I have a God who does
[1:42:19] permanent things and if it tells me I'm
[1:42:22] Healed then I'm permanently
[1:42:28] healed you go today they measure
[1:42:30] everything that tell you oh you're going
[1:42:33] to
[1:42:35] die you go you take the medicine and you
[1:42:37] go and then you measure it says oh you
[1:42:39] well you come back again and said oh
[1:42:42] it's back no it's not back that's just
[1:42:46] your meters if God heals me he heals
[1:42:50] forever
[1:42:54] if God Saves you he saves you forever
[1:42:58] the devil can try to pull it back on you
[1:43:00] but the healing is not based on how I
[1:43:02] feel the healing is not based on my
[1:43:05] manal in fact says that's why it's so
[1:43:07] important we have the right manal
[1:43:09] attitude he says the right manal
[1:43:11] attitude towards any any promise will
[1:43:13] bring it to pass oh Church of the Living
[1:43:17] God let's not fa short of our commission
[1:43:20] and the things that God has given us
[1:43:22] let's not fell short of the things that
[1:43:24] God wants us to live
[1:43:30] by the scripture speaks about the men of
[1:43:33] old when God has spoken to them
[1:43:36] something you couldn't turn them
[1:43:39] otherwise all right every day when they
[1:43:42] woke up come on is this it the day is
[1:43:45] this the manner of choosing that God is
[1:43:47] going to do they didn't even have the
[1:43:49] clear picture the whole full picture all
[1:43:51] they knew is God told them but says when
[1:43:54] God told Simeon that you shall not die
[1:43:57] until you see the
[1:43:58] sun I'll tell you every day he went in
[1:44:01] the temple just singing today is the day
[1:44:05] today is the day and it didn't matter
[1:44:07] how many babies were around he touched
[1:44:09] them he knew oh Simeon you're getting
[1:44:12] old it didn't matter to him one thing he
[1:44:14] knew that God told me that I'm not going
[1:44:17] to go in the grave until I see the
[1:44:19] Promise one day he woke up he went
[1:44:23] Temple just the same way as he did he
[1:44:25] went to prayer the same as he did but
[1:44:28] that day was the day that God promised
[1:44:30] was going to come to pass and as he walk
[1:44:32] in he walk across and says there were so
[1:44:35] many babies he just came and there was
[1:44:38] one in a swaddling clo in this little
[1:44:40] girl holding him and all of the sudden
[1:44:43] the same God who gave the promise the
[1:44:45] same God leads him to the promise and he
[1:44:48] gets in he says my eyes have seen the
[1:44:51] promise of the glory of the coming
[1:44:53] coming of the Lord why he s the baby God
[1:44:56] promised it it didn't matter how old he
[1:44:59] got he didn't die until he saw the
[1:45:02] promise God promised you Rapture you
[1:45:05] going into the Rapture God promised that
[1:45:08] he will be with you even in you he's not
[1:45:11] going to let that God promis you will
[1:45:13] provide for your daily need that same
[1:45:15] God will be with you you're not going to
[1:45:18] die he promised he'll be with you and
[1:45:20] he's going to be with you let us
[1:45:37] stand he says
[1:45:40] this now remember when they got to
[1:45:44] Kadesh Baria butam calls it the Judgment
[1:45:48] seat because this is really where they
[1:45:50] had to make their
[1:45:51] decisions after the spies came and they
[1:45:54] brought all the reports yeah they are
[1:45:59] like I said a while ago the this spies
[1:46:02] were only there's no place where they
[1:46:05] told them go in there and count how many
[1:46:08] hammerites they have how many malachit
[1:46:11] there are in there how many heads sites
[1:46:13] and tell us the size that they are tell
[1:46:16] us the size of the arms and everything
[1:46:18] and then come report everything no all
[1:46:21] that they were told was go in there and
[1:46:24] come back with a report whether the land
[1:46:26] is good or
[1:46:27] not not bad good or not in other word go
[1:46:33] examine the land it says it will be
[1:46:35] flowing with milk and honey it will be
[1:46:37] all just go look and tell us if the land
[1:46:40] has those things my brother my sister we
[1:46:42] have come into this
[1:46:45] land is this the is this land exactly as
[1:46:49] the prophet said it is this exactly as
[1:46:52] the prophet promised is it exactly
[1:46:55] everything that was told us does it have
[1:46:57] any healing does he have Deliverance
[1:46:59] does he have all the things that he
[1:47:01] promis it does don't number one don't
[1:47:04] let the devil tell you it's not yours
[1:47:06] because it's yours and number two don't
[1:47:09] focus on the giant focus on the
[1:47:13] land how is it that I'm going to go in
[1:47:15] the
[1:47:16] Rapture goodness I don't have enough
[1:47:19] faith for a Toof
[1:47:23] how am I going to hit faithful Rapture
[1:47:25] now that's your giant right
[1:47:30] there I'm struggling with this how am I
[1:47:32] going to go in the Rapture it's none of
[1:47:34] your
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:38] business you're not going to go in a
[1:47:40] Rapture because you did so many good
[1:47:42] works and God compiled it and said oh
[1:47:45] then you can
[1:47:48] go I I think with the principle of
[1:47:51] Christianity I feel like we have been so
[1:47:54] much
[1:47:55] indoctrinated with denomination it's
[1:47:58] it's so hard to perceive it because we
[1:48:03] we have this understanding that works
[1:48:06] equals to
[1:48:10] acceptance the more works I do the more
[1:48:12] God likes me no Jesus was beloved but
[1:48:16] didn't he go to the Cross to Die the
[1:48:19] very beloved of the father but whatam
[1:48:21] says he was so perfect like like that
[1:48:24] statue the the the statue we talk about
[1:48:27] God smote him the very perfect
[1:48:32] one oh sorry I was just going to go let
[1:48:35] me let me just read this so he says this
[1:48:37] I liked it so cish B so they had to
[1:48:40] choose it says this is where they fell
[1:48:42] because they
[1:48:44] listened to the bigger percentage of
[1:48:47] them men that came back and said so
[1:48:50] their understanding and their judgment
[1:48:52] was
[1:48:53] well there's 10 over here but there's
[1:48:56] only two who you going to listen
[1:49:01] to now we we think this is a reality now
[1:49:06] if you were put there now you can all
[1:49:08] put your spiritual caps right now say I
[1:49:10] would I no I want you to really think
[1:49:12] about it there is 10 that came from the
[1:49:17] same place as two 10 of them are saying
[1:49:21] it's not good well well you know the
[1:49:23] part that they said was good was good
[1:49:25] but there's more than that that we got
[1:49:27] to watch out for but there's only two on
[1:49:29] this side that are saying the land is
[1:49:32] good and we can take it so listen to
[1:49:35] what it said why they look like
[1:49:39] grasshoppers it says why we look like
[1:49:42] grasshoppers up there and then it says
[1:49:45] they were looking at the symptoms when
[1:49:47] Joshua called when Joshua when Joshua
[1:49:50] and Caleb was looking to what God Said
[1:49:52] said it says I give you the land no
[1:49:56] matter how big the cities how big the
[1:49:58] Giants God bigger than
[1:50:02] all my brother my sister your God Is
[1:50:05] Bigger Than all your God Is Bigger Than
[1:50:09] all he said God is the one that made the
[1:50:12] promise he's bigger than all and he's
[1:50:14] the one who made the promise so if you
[1:50:17] met if your giant is Big then God Is
