last [Music] day something that struck deep deep with in each of us and we felt a pull yes Father and we followed that voice and it led us to a life and father we're trusting that it will lead us home this morning we ask that you would help us as a body of Believers grow in your ways in your your will and your word and we ask this morning Father that we would find strength and comfort that you're mindful of us and that we stand true on a promise that you would never leave us nor forsake us but that you'd be with us even in us until the end father we covet your correction father for it's not punish ment Lord but it's to lead us in a Higher Ground we ask now that you would help us bring forth your thoughts this morning and that we would be kind and gentle one to another we ask these things in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you if you have your bibles if you would open uh with me to Ephesians uh the uh second uh chapter I believe of Ephesians and the 10th verse and so we're just going to uh use this kind of as a launching board and a premise this morning for where we want to go it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them our gracious father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus name we pray pray amen God bless you may be seated uh we ask you to bear with me this morning um as you've probably heard maybe through prayer request and and uh different uh channels that I've lost the vision in my uh right eye uh it's not a a Dreadful thing by any means it's just more pressure that my whole body be the light that was scripture uh but uh uh it happened on my left eye earlier and now it's my right eye so they'll go back and do the procedure on my right eye uh they will go in there and they will stick three little probes in my eye a camera a laser and I guess some sort of suction tube and they'll suck all the blood out of my eye and all the fluid out and then they'll take the laser and they'll seal up all the leaks and then they'll and they have a camera in there and then they'll reinsert new fluid in my eye and I then I hope they take everything out and uh my I'll be able to see again so that's the process and we trust the doctors and and what they see of course I'm open for a miraculous healing at any moment and I believe for that but I believe if this is the path that the Lord takes me I will have the same success cuz he's the great physician um when it comes to all so if I my head kind of goes all kinds of different places and and cuz uh sometimes I you know I peripherals not all good and every but I can still drive safe so uh that's good I I I normally drive like this but I'm going to try not to squint too much this morning but the we're not here uh you know really we're here for the word of God this morning and and and these um these thoughts have started on my heart um probably in the early part of last year um when my desire was really what pleases the Lord and really what what is he looking for in his church and and so much time has always been spent on the individual and so we would always labor about who are you and and uh how that you're predestinated and how that you're elected and how that you're chosen and we we spend a lot of times and basically that was a lot of concentration on ourselves you know if I could say it this way uh trying to be comfortable uh I think the world terminology is to be comfortable in your own skin I think is how they put it I hope that's a uh uh okay to say and so people try you know trying to be comfortable you know uh knowing who you are and I think that we spent enough uh time on those things and and it came to my heart and my thought okay now you know I know who I am I know that I've been chosen I I know that I'm not in danger of losing my election because it was done while I was yet a inner I I'm not in danger of failure if I could say it that way because my name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life and nothing can put it on and nothing can take it off so uh I look at all those things and I I'd say in my heart okay when is this finally going to be uh settled you know what I mean where I don't have a a reaction or an action or I I don't get go down the road and maybe lose my cool a little bit with somebody pulling in front of me that every time I have a small failure that I have to go back and rebuild my Foundation you know that in other words okay I make mistakes we all make mistakes but that doesn't change who that I am we refer to our children you know there's a lot of times that you wish they weren't your children and then there's a lot of times you're proud that they are your children and so you just go through those stages but they're still they're yours and we're his so as I begin to think uh on those things is is you know what what does the Lord want me to accomplish or do or what is the Revelation and realization that God has chosen me before the foundation of the world and well I was a yet a sinner he died for me and that he made me a promise that if he started a work in me that he would finish it till the end and that nothing could pluck me out of the pal of his hand and that my sheep uh know my voice and another they won't follow and I I was established in my heart uh beyond the shadow of a doubt that William Mary and brandom was the man that God chose to Veil himself in and he was the voice of God to this generation that he had a message for us and uh and the message was necessary because there were other voices that had entered into the world and some were saying he's here and some he was saying that he was there and they were looking to this movement and that movement and and maybe this teaching or that teaching and there need to be a voice that came back and spoke to us that said God is in his word amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and that word is unchanging and God is unchanging it and trying to bring us uh back to the Faith of Our Fathers if I could say it that way to the Revelation that was first delivered to our fathers from the word himself and that's what he was trying to bring us back to and so there was a place that we were trying to get back to and as we started up that Journey eat within ourselves we all followed the same pattern we came to justification sanctification we came to receive the spirit of God and and move on in to Perfection and come to the revelations and the realizations of who that he is and what is our relationship with him as joint hirs okay not not as separate entities but in this age our relationship was to be one of Fellowship joint air we refer to it in many ways as the invisible Union of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom that there was supposed to be uh something transpire in this age that the church had been working to through Seven Ages at and at this time in history when lady OA uh came to the conditions of Sodom and glamora in the world came as it was in the days of Noah and Man became blind miserable poor wretched and naked and didn't know it and came to the place that they felt that they had need of nothing or that they could accomplish and solve what their needs were to be and they began to make great strides in science and and in education and in technology and and uh and so we we find ourselves all in this condition and we've for the years and years we've went over the Mysteries and and and the understanding of what had taken place in our generation and clearly we've come to a full knowledge according to Luke 17:30 uh that the Lord Jesus was to return in our day in other words he was to make an appearance uh or a manifestation a coming however that you would want to express it or whatever terminologies you choose to that the image fits best in your understanding but that the Lord Jesus was going to come and Veil himself in a human being and and as he did to the Jews he would also do to the Gentiles and that the same works that Jesus did so when when God came down in human flesh in Jesus he came as the son of man which meant a prophet so he was a prophet and and he had certain signs that Vindicated him that he could say if you can't believe me for my words believe me for my works and because they testify of me and so now we found out that that challenge was given to the Jews and the Gentile Church would also have to face the same challenge they would be given something to believe that was incredible but could only be received by Revelation so if God doesn't open your eyes to it it's it's impossible to to grasp and so many people have been able to follow it along intellectually but eventually your intellect will break down that's right and eventually voices will come and explanations will come and the tempter will come and intelligence will come where you can no longer trust in your mind and that's wonderful thing about a true Revelation it's so embedded in your heart that it rules over your mind and when there's a conflict between your Revelation and your mind your mind is wrong God's word is true and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you didn't receive this from men and he designed it this way that the church would be built on that that would become the foundation and the Chief Cornerstone of the church was that the church would be built on divine revelation Flesh and Blood have not revealed this to you in other words it wasn't taught to you it wasn't intellectually explained to you but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed it to you and and you can go along I we have many people in our congregation that for years they walk with their spouse they came to church they love the fellowship but one day they came upon the Revelation and received it for themselves and and that's what we want every individual in here to be able to say and to experience it's not Grandpa's it's not dad's it it's not Grandma it's not my brothers my sisters but I personally have received from the father and and that's what he want chose to build his church on what was the Revelation so there there's no comparison you can't compare yourself uh with anyone else because it's your Revelation and the best way ever to explain a revelation is just the way that he gave it to you and most every Revelation I've ever received was given to me by the word of God so God so loved the world he go gave His only begotten son if you have the revelation of that all you can say is God so love the world I mean there's just no way that describes it better than the word that gave it to you and so knowing that we were built on those things and and in our day the Lord made a appearance and he made a call and he was calling out the elect for this day he was separating The Believer from the unbeliever uh he was going out and gathering in the Sheep uh that were scattered in many different folds in many different religions in many different labels and Brands and yet his great goal was was to unite them and bring them together as one and as I thought on those things and I begin to look and I said father we have these great Revelations and and uh we have these truths and we have an absolute we actually have something that we all believe and so you must have had a a a great purpose uh you've granted to me all these truths and this wonderful knowledge and you called me out of California just a a hippie uh uh someone running in the wrong crowd and yet you found your way to me and and and brought me to this with and you did it in in such a a unique way that maybe personally that's the way I needed it to be but when I finally came down to it I began to say what is it that he wants us to do and become with all that he hath given us and we could go through Parables and about the the gifts and that was given and how some buried it and some you know did different things with it and they were afraid and that we were held accountable um for what is it that you've done with what that he's given you and and so uh my heart began to go in in in those ways and uh even to the point that I I begin to see that that maybe we've been trying to draw the wrong picture and uh trying to fit ourselves into a complete different mindset and I know the mindset of God's word was delivered to us in this day the word of God is the thoughts of God expressed and and I know our messenger gave many many doctrinal truths and facts that were uh outstanding but yet he also had if I could say this an overlying theme in everything that he brought and and that was the coming together of unity and fellowship and love one for another and that he he with the men and the spirits and the teachings that broke down Fellowship between people that was in fact it was referred to as the Antichrist spirit that would divide the Brotherhood and and what his heart broke for was here that God actually manifested himself using human flesh so I could say it this way he manifested himself in the flesh in our due day doing the same signs and same wonders but yet because of man's PR Pride their ego their goals and everything they rejected the very one thing that would have have brought them all together and that I believe was honestly a pure heart's desire uh if they could all be in one Accord and just serve the Lord and everybody's motive and objective would be right and it would be pure and they'd be sold out to the gospel sold out to the Lord Jesus Christ they would be in love with them and and they would be his servants and and they would love one another and and I I I I felt that and I thought well we've labored on the people so much but you know have we really moved any closer to the unity that we're promised I know there's a lot of teachings today and a a a lot of uh uh movements if I could say that and through the time uh in the years that I've been following this message I can honestly say this in all the time I've been following the message the tapes haven't changed the word hasn't changed and the spirit on those tapes hasn't changed but I've seen men and go and seem to pull something out and and run with it and present it as this this thought is going to be the thought that changes things and and different uh uh different seems like uh anointings and different excitements and different actions and different worships and and you you know just after you see so many of them and they fail because they they take a portion but you've got to take it all that that's where the beauty of the message is it's well balanced it's put together um I don't want to use the I I don't have a word in my vocabulary to say it correctly but it coordinates itself I don't want to use the word corrects itself but but it it it actually Engineers itself that these statements will eventually fit with these statements at where you don't understand one thing wait a while it'll get put in its proper place and man's always got out ahead of God trying to explain things and and uh we found that out it's just like and in our terminology started to come in and we started developing languages and terminology you know a lot today you hear a a lot about uh the bride coming of Christ you know and and people sit back and think well here's a people and now God the Lord's coming and making another appearance and another coming in in a bride and people just get so excited about that but that go Listen to Invisible Union it's very simple it's kind of the same thing but really it was the bride coming to Christ she's finally going to come to him and Unite with him and be like him and she's going to be in him and and he and her because that's what he prayed for in John 17 father may they be one as we are one may they love you and love them as you have loved me and may they love one another and uh he he he it's a beautiful thing but for some reason man has such a a drive to read something in the scripture and then feel he has to manufacture it or he has to fill in the blanks and but with God everything has its timing and so uh th this is kind of the background of if you want to know my heart and to where it is the sermons that I've and the message I'm trying to bring to you is something that I feel I see within the message and that's why I like to try to play tapes when I can so you can see at least from where that I feel I'm getting what I'm hearing from and you're always welcome to correct me uh because that's the heart's desire but one of the things I begin to is to see and desire for the individual Believers to be successful and I didn't want us to hide how many know what religion is religion's a covering that's what the prophet of God says it's something that you can put on and it hides you kind of like uh at the wedding feasts they used to all dress the same the purpose was so that the rich wouldn't stand out from the poor that was the general purpose of it because so a man can invite his business friends which might be a different class of people from his relatives you know what I mean so it was a way to make his relatives look socially uh fit you know so and also allowed him to pretend and hide of where that he come from so if I come from a little town and my daddy was a shepherd and everything and I went to the big city and now I'm hanging around with big businessmen well if they dress the same when my shepherd daddy comes and he's you know he dresses the same then it really it it's hiding me and that's what religion does is it hides you it allows us to hide ourselves within the framework of a large group of people and therefore you have people that can come they can make the appearance of being a Believer and there's no real evidence one way or the other and our messenger addressed that and it it was striking when I begin to see these things in the light that the Lord's allowing me to walk in at this time that he said there's three kinds of Believers in every group and I well I you would think that they would be very identifiable no they're not there's Believers there's make Believers and I and I'm not going to say that the make believer doesn't believe if you would allow me to use another word the unengaged believer the nonparticipant believer the show up the one that's there to fulfill the obligation uh I was raised a Catholic so you had to go to mass on Easter and you had to go to mass on Christmas and you'd see people on Easter and Christmas and that's the only only time you ever saw and we have people that are like that they make a an occasional appearance just to find out if you're still here and to let you know that they're still here and so I'm not saying they don't believe the message they don't believe in the Lord Jesus but they're unengaged they're they're nonparticipants and uh and then you have the unbeliever which is whom we invite to church we don't want to have people come from one church because they're unhappy there because the more they get to know you the more unhappy they'll be with you you know and we're no different than anybody else we're people with three kinds of Believers and if you're looking for that you'll find it and we want the unbeliever to come we want people to come to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that the burden of sin can be lift from their lives and the indwelling spirit can come on their lives and fill them with joy and peace and love and that is actually something that gives you such a sense of well-being that you can weather Every Storm whether the winds toss you to and fro uh it doesn't matter your Anchor Holds and and your eyes are set on things above that if if my ship sinks I will rise again again it's just a peace and we want uh we want everyone to come to that we don't want them to put on a wedding garment so they look the same we want them really to know that the Lord Jesus Jesus is real he's real and he loves you and he'll walk with you and forgive you and take you by your hand and do so many things and look I don't know if it's really warm in here this morning or not is it hot in here yes okay I just didn't want to know if it was wasn't me and U so I'm going to take my coat off but I'm afraid I'll pop a button so um so with that being said uh I begin to approach it last week by talking about the success of an individual what makes individuals successful and we found out that the reason that individuals were successful because God made us to succeed and so we read here in Ephesians and we wanted this to uh these certain parts of this it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus so we're his workmanship so he put in man all the elements and the things that man should do to be successful and then we went out and we found the psychologists and the psychiatrists and the performance coaches and the athletic coaches and we went out and we found all these characteristics that they've identified as things that a person must do in order to be successful and then come to find out we could go right back into the scripture and find every single one of them in the word of God the difference was there were two different measures of success one person measures success by a trophy or a title or uh uh uh some Financial goal and therefore they took the practices that were scriptural practices took chapter and verse off of them and then presented them to man as being steps and meters of success and they worked and then Satan kind of flipped one on us and said oh if you practice that then then you're of the world no Satan stole them but we can do those same things I went over just dozens of them we can do practice those same things and be successful as a Christian have fruits have Works have accomplishments if we are able to practice the disciplines do the things that were spoken of in the scripture and the things that we could find in the scripture that were practicing practiced by the great Patriarchs in the word of God and so we found that those things were uh stolen from the scripture because the word of God's Eternal this same word existed before it was printed the spoken word was the original seed so it was spoken so now that it finally got written and we can read it and reference it uh but before it was passed from lip to ear by the leadership of the Holy Spirit men under the influence of the holy spirit in diverse times and Sous manners God spoke to our fathers by his spirit and that was communicated and practiced and the result would come so we talked just a little bit last uh week about the success of the individual now I I want to go to another step of that and I want to point out again that these principles that the world uses were not created by the world they were perverted by the world the scripture says we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so we understand that God had a plan so he put all these characteristics of success in a man that a man could fulfill what it is that God wanted him to do and be successful at it then religion came around and substituted success with Doctrine with teaching with belief belief without works belief without action belief without light belief without the desire or a pattern of good works so P men now could believe in God and do nothing and other words the commission had totally gone void from the Church go into all the world preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover he so all that got substituted with man thinking that they could believe in their head have some sort of sensation and then they could go forward holding on to to what that they believe and not be able to see any fruit and and then man kind of solved that so they just did fruits amongst their buddies so you know and they took a scripture you know it says you know do these things but especially at the household of faith well they just took the household of faith because they knew that if they did this they would get it in return and Jesus says don't do it that you might receive it again so obviously he knew that these things would go so that we're for ordained and we're and and so it it was before ordained so we understood and this is what I hope that you can I can expressed to you this morning in my limit of vocabulary that that God had a plan he had something he wanted to accomplish in you as an individual he wanted you to be an ambassador a representative he wanted your light to shine he wanted it on the hillside he wanted your good works to glorify the Father which is in heaven he he he he he he wanted the uh in fact his love was so perfected one of my very favorite scriptures that here in his love made perfect that as he is so are we in this world so that's what his goal and but he gave us the tools to do it so a man that obtains a high level in corporate what we would call corporate American success a Christian can do the same things and be a successful Christian and be be a officer in in the spiritual realm above a corporate and him have eternal rewards instead of a building named after him I want a street in glory I don't want a building you know what I mean or a freeway how have you ever been on LBJ Freeway every time on LBJ Freeway I hate that freeway then makes you want to hate the guy it's named after who never wanted a road named after him that Bumper to Bumper all the time man's warped and I is one so I know what I'm talking about so we so God instituted this it was part of his plan so now I'm going to take it if you would bear with me for a few moments from the individual because you have to have individuals when we talk about making the picture puzzle picture every individual piece is important to the picture there's no big pieces or little pieces without all of the pieces you don't have the picture that's how important you are as an individual that's how important it is that you develop your individual Christian spiritual success and that you find your calling and that's where we want to go this morning if you would uh be be with me for a few moments is they call it the success of the team team success there's certain characteristics that any successful team has football teams basketball teams baseball teams corporate teams development teams management teams whatever it is whatever it comes business teams the military teams Medical Teams there is certain characteristics and things that have to be in place in order for that team to work and be successful they call it teams what do we call it body a body we are a body of Believers it was addressed in the Scriptures it was addressed by our messenger and so we want to start just if you would to turn with me to Corinthians the 12th chapter and we're going to read this chapter and I want you to understand now here's God has ordained this and instituted the body okay this was it wasn't something that just was came up with just like God ordained and instituted your personal success he's ordained and instituted the success of the body in other words the individuals working together uniting together as a body in fact there was a sermon preached called uniting time and sign how that the world and all these different things are uniting together in other words these characteristics and attributes of a team of a union are starting to fall in place and again they were stolen from us we're the original team we're the original body we have the original plan God had the first Eden Satan took every instrument that God had because he couldn't create and perverted it to make civilization and education what we have today and Satan's been trying to mix religion and civilization and education together the biggest deception that there ever is so you can have both but you can't come out from amongst them and be ye separate how can two walk together and L they agree you'll either serve one master or the other you'll either be hot or cold so we're coming to that time and I'm saying this because you can't sit back dormant you can't remain in your religious stuper unengaged not participating not fulfilling not advancing in character not being nonf fruitful the word says you'll be up you'll be hewed you'll be trimmed you'll be cast down you'll be cut in the fire oh Don't Preach that side of the Gospel but you can't get in on religion you can't get in on self-belief you must be born again by the spirit of God and if you're born again then the spirit will be in you and the spirit will do those foreordained good works all those things I preached last week are the character worth of success they're all good works and there's good works of a body so let's just read so if I miss a word or two it's I'm not used to reading with one eye now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you be ignorant you know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as ye were LED wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration but the same Lord so these things were institut Ed by God and there are diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so we you you begin to see the picture he put something now this is not to be manufactured or it isn't fill in the blanks so the scripture says some are given tongues so someone says oh we've got to have tongues we're in other words we're going to fulfill that scripture we're going to fill in that blank it's not how it works it's it's the profit with all it has nothing to do with personal Glory it has to do with the team the body the surgical team everybody's got to work together he said for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretations of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man several as he will now so we see that these are things that are done by the spirit so the gifts are in the church not necessarily solely to the individual that's why he told us don't seek after the gift seek after the giver and if he so chooses if it's according to his will if it's un needful then those are available to the Believers that are filled with his Spirit they are not to be manufactured they they are not to be filled in the blank someone would come here and say who speaks in tongues who interprets who does that so how would you answer that we all do we all have the self-same spirit we're all born by one Spirit Redeemed by one spirit filled by one Spirit we live live by his Spirit but man has always Tri to manufacture something the the we'll read it here in a moment the scripture says firstly there was Apostles you know then prophets and then this and then that evangelist you know prophets evangelist teachers and and and so man automatically says first apostles so that means number one highest on the list right so now man's got this whole desire it in his heart to have some sort of hierarchy and they do it with the gift some sort of hierarchy hierarchy there's no hierarchy there's no big eyes there's no little use you say well why was it first apostles because that's what it starts with one being sent one going out and then people begin to speak and and and tell things of how that things are and this was that and they they begin to speak and then the Evangelist comes in and stirs it up and then the teacher comes in and then eventually the pastor comes in there's no big ey there's no little you there's no one great that's why you go these guys are so oops I was going to say something I'm trying to overcome thank you Lord you find on so many of these churches they have Apostle you know Apostle JJ Brown well that's high of the ladder I've made it to Apostle there's no there's no higher authority I just like to be able to say I'm born again and the love and the light of Jesus Christ shines within my heart yes sir Wherever I Go it the love of God is shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Spirit but that that's this humanism because Satan took our means of success and stole it and that we're supposed to possess the gates of our enemies so this is what he says so now qu so they I'm going to read some things in a moment so they call it a team right has anybody been on a sales team some of you have a surgical team I know Ron's back there he's been on surgical teams can you imagine a guy working and some other guy coming on to the side and he's going to do something different when they operate on my eye I want everybody in that team to be on the same page it always scares me to death when they walk in and they ask you what I what do you mean what I you don't know and then they put a big on your forehead how you really yeah well that you know what there's a reason for that and when it's all over you're glad that they didn't work on the wrong one so now let's look we're talking now let's take the word team and insert body God instituted the body he gave you the characteristics of success and now he positionally places you in a body this is just Sunday school we'll get through it for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether we be Bond or free and have been all and have all been made to drink unto one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body it is therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body it is therefore not of the body if the whole body were and I where were the hearing if the whole were the hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as H hath pleased him that ought to raise a great big question where have you been placed are you a part of the body or are you not part of the body we don't even consider these things anymore but they're part of the Eternal part of God God wants his team his body it's a body he foreordained it it was his will it was his plan that the church would work as a body and every member in that body had a role to play had a part to play every piece of the puzzle was important to the puzzle but if you are in the religious realm you just belong to the message you just believe the message and this church is just a place you go to fulfill your message message and you go live your life well don't be surprised when the day comes that you find out you're not part of the body because you never made yourself part of the body you never contributed to the body you never joined yourself to the body you never bore the burdens of the body you never prayed for the body you were a churchgoer god has a body and that's our problem in the message we've all joined the message but we haven't joined the church the body the bride body of the Lord Jesus we're not connected we don't hook up with one another we don't participate with one another we don't care with one another Well if you really want the best Sunday religion I suggest you go join the Catholic Church you show up on Sunday they have a little schedule and then if you do something wrong you go in the Box tell the priest he wipes your sins off and you go do them again quite a program but I don't want to be a part of something that's not God if God has a bride which is referred to as his church which is referred to his body I want to be a part of it I want to know my place I want to know my role I want to know what it is and it comes natural to my heart I don't have to go fill in the blank I have to get in my prayer closet I have to be in Union with the spirit the Holy Spirit the footsteps of the righteous are led by the Lord I have to be able to become tender to the holy unction but if you don't care about the spirit you don't get in the spirit you don't pray in the spirit you don't get alone with God you're not seeking a job you're not seeking a part you're not seeking a place you're not seeking anything well then good luck because it's a body that's being Resurrected but now God has set the members every one of them in the body now God has set the members every one of them in the body let me say that again God has set the members in the body that ought to invoke some sort of responsibility and [Music] self-examination you know I I we're here to go to heaven we can't take a failed method of denominational religion to denominational theories and approaches to the scripture we can't be doing what everybody else has been doing in the name of the message do the same thing and think we're going to get a different result that spiritual insanity and this is not going to every all the message people every every Pastor is responsible for their own church and I feel my responsibility is to the word of God and the message of the hour and what the prophet of God taught it and I would be I would be a myth of my due diligence if I didn't tell you these things because I don't want you if I go there I don't want you to be gnawing and chewing on me so he say so there he says so so God has said as it pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members but but yet one body and the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of thee nor the head to the feet I have no need of thee so you can't say that you don't have need of the body that you don't have need of one another right you can't make it on your own and I'm I'm I'm I'm saying these things this morning because I want you to start considering them because I think this is where God's taking the church to a uniting with his word n much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable unto these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comonly parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lackthe [Music] another he's the boss he's the leader you know you know and you know and a lot of times people think they're working for me do you know what I mean you're not working for me because I wouldn't have you right I mean that's how we we are but we're not working for we I didn't build this church you built this church I might have called you but you didn't do it for me you didn't get my reward you got his reward everything we did around here that you you put in you gave it to him you gave your time you gave your effort you give your thing you didn't do it for me you did it for him and if it's in your mind that oh we're working for him and he's a slave driver I'm a slave driver you know what I mean I trying to get as much done in my lifetime as I can I want to give every scent I've got I want to burn my Wick down to the bottom when you find my candle all I want you to have left that little silver thing at the body where's McGary he's all gone he's spent I'm what Reserve something for what everybody say why don't you just sit around and lay around really and do what I don't know what it's like you know what I mean let's work well it's day let's do something for the kingdom we build this let's fill it up amen then I'll go with rest with my fathers and you can build another one if the Lord carries you're a part of it that there should be no sisms in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffereth all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular you have to find your peculiarity and God hath set some in the church first upon Apostles secondary prophets third teachers after that Miracles Gifts of healings helps governments diversity of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak in tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way and that's why you can't separate Hebrews 13 from Hebrews 12 so you understand God's in God instituted the team right every team that you see out there sales team production team a research team uh development team medical team every single team came from the word of God just God's in control seven characteristics of a team if I could say it this way seven characteristics of the body number one Trust I also made aide no meaningful purpose you have to trust that what you're doing that you got to trust one another I I've got to believe that you're here for the same reason that I'm here I have to believe that we're in this together I have to believe that nobody has alternative motive and objectives we're not here you're we're you're not here to dig up dirt on one another you're not here to see what somebody's wearing you're not here to get the latest uh Buzz you know or who child did this or or or who got kicked out of school and who got on a fight in the playground and who likes who and which boy is the dream boat of the day and which girl is the is looking so sweet right we trust one another of a team works together I I like you know one of the things that uh you hear different things in the Sports World they they say they say Stars wins games but teams win championships one guy can do it all for by himself for a little while but it takes everybody to do it every day and you've got to trust that that person next to you is part of your team is part of the body you can't be saying this one's not a Christian you that's a number one issue they say is you have to have trust the second is clear communication you've got to be able to communicate a clear Communication in other words the same rules for everybody if church starts at certain time everybody makes it to church at a certain time if the rule if the if the our absolute said to be here 30 minutes early then it would seem that we would trust one another that this is all what we believe to be the messenger for the day the absolute and what he said you say is that a a law no it's a guideline it's something that you make an effort to obtain I'm trusting you that you will get here and be prayed up I I it's hard to build a body when you'll be at work at 8:00 and come to church 30 minutes late what does that say to the body it says I have no trust in you I have no respect in you I'm really not a part of you you can come when you can come and I can come when I can come I can do what I want you do what you want welcome that's lady oia that's people's rights you know it's fine for us to have a nice group and have Fellowship PA have a pavilion but we're not talking about that we're talking about making it to Glory we're talking about what God sees when he looks at our life now does he see a member of the body does he see a hand does he see a foot does he see an eye does he see an ear does he see somebody that's participating in the body or are you torn and I just feel in my heart these are some of the things the Lord wants us to start to become more mindful of it's going to make us better Christians clear Communications you have the same codes the same dress codes the same entertainment codes the same value system you know what I mean uh you you you have the same you you have clear Communications yay be yay and NB nay you you you you you a good body or a good team they communicate they have good let the Comm let no bitter or foul communication come out your mouth and I could give read scripture after scripture I got a lot of them but I'm going to move quickly because of time so you have that uh clear communication leads to what they call a culture when people start letting things slip and it no matter matters and this don't matter then the standard goes down anybody been in a company when all of a sudden the standards go down you know the doors don't get locked the toilets don't get flushed the the baskets don't get emptied you know what I mean let that go on for two weeks everybody knows the same everybody knows to take their diapers home home don't leave your diapers here till Wednesday when I come in the church Wednesday morning and I think my goodness I want to call the Exterminator right I think something died in here because nobody took their diaper home you say oh brother McGary I thought this is religion this is religion at its finest amen this is Christianity at its best you care just like we asked you not to stand in the in the driveways I almost took out a girl the other day you notice if you're wearing false teeth we have speed bumps and if people keep speeding through the parking lot I'll put more of them up but if you're not going to care for the little ones and you're not going to care we're too crowded anyway if you don't want to communicate and be part of the program please feel free I'll give you a list of other churches that believe these things but we cannot go on leaving sloppy Christian lives with no regard for the church for its leadership for its offices and just think that we can come and go as we please you say oh brother MC I I show you the quote where brother Pam said if you can't keep your kid behave leave them home he said it and I'm not saying I love as nicely as brother random loved but anyway clear communication we dress the same wives teach the younger women how to be good wives sisters watch one another's dress watch the high heels watch the tight clothes maybe you don't know these things but somebody's got to say them so that's a good team a good body everybody communicates we have an absolute the word of God we follow what our messenger said we study to show ourselves approved there's things that we do here's a the they they put it third some people put it first defined and definite roles and responsibilities definite roles and responsibilities mothers are responsible for your children young sisters you that are teenagers watch out for the young ones help the mothers be a body be taking care of one another communicate one another Know Where Your Children Are you say oh brother McGary I want to hear about the Mysteries the Mysteries aren't doing us any good our lives are are out of order we're in chaos we're in confusion there's no discipline there's no discipline at home there's no discipline in church there there's there's no discipline in our lives and and it's fine but do you understand the squeeze has coming it's getting more narrow it's getting more shaken down it's going to take more diligence more discipline more dedication you you can't we just got to pull it together I'm preaching to myself we have roles and responsibilities we pray without ceasing we study to show ourselves approved we lay for ourselves a pattern of Good Works we've got responsibility to one another you got the responsibility to sing and join In Worship sing put your spirit into it put your heart into it worship it's a we're responsible to lift one another up I've got a role I play I come to church to raise my hands to praise God to sing at the top of my lung to let me say well I don't sing the song in your own language but don't sit there like a prune or a grape you know get involved be a part the scripture says let us lift up holy hands let us make melody in Psalms and hymns let us exhort one another these are all necessary things you have to have engaged leadership let all things be done decently and in order we we got def we have to have a collective goal what's our Collective goal rapture so brother MC man I've never heard you preach this hard in in my whole life chew everybody out I want you to make the Rapture it's about the Rapture and Satan is like a roaring lion going about seeking him or devour absolutely putting Amnesia on the church I've watched it in young people I've watched churches where their young people get more worldly more worldly they spend more time at the gym and in church they're all starting to wear high heels their dresses are as close to their knees as they possibly can be they they got more blush on and ey Shadow and and eyelash stuff and and you know more lower this and sleeveless and all that's going on in the church and and we have a simple thing our Prophet said you know you know we know how the sheep got out but how did the goats get in and it's like and and all you just wrap it up well they'll come to Christ eventually that's not even scriptural you sometimes you got to lay down lawn I know what it's like to fight with teenagers you know tooth and nail day in and day out tell them they're not doing right and them not doing right but I tell you you have a promise if you raise them in the way they go they'll return back to it but if you just get in some place where there's no standards and it's all because Jesus is Love Love's corrective love is the truth the truth is what set you free and you just can't you can't go on and think that youve you that and and then let alone claim any representation to the message and don't we all love the message isn't that what our another Collective goal is the rapture is to try to really let this message Shine for what that it really is a spirit of love a spirit of unity a spirit of peace the power in the church where every member loves one another where a body fitted and joyed together every member in particular supplying the needs of the other all this stuff is starting to slip away and it was his intention to have a team to have a body to have people in one Accord and in one Spirit loving and caring one for another mindful of one another a collective goal self-awareness and dependability self-awareness every person taking heed to themselves that they've got the beam out of their eye before they remove the sliver aware of their actions aware of their time table aware of their hygiene ooh hygiene time shower clean deodorant not too much perfume be aware you know and if you got a good friend of yours and you're friend in up and and you can smell them down on the other end of the Pew go to them and say hey friend you're a little ripe or or or or sister that perfume is it smells good but it's so strong brother mcgary's eyes are watering hey we're all in here together you know what I mean I mean I could we could go back into the law man they washed and did everything there was all kinds of rules they had to keep things clean do you know in the Old Testament if you touched a dead body you had to bathe and wash you couldn't enter into the it it defiled the house of God but couldn't we take that into the spiritual real and have a Revival but there's a self-awareness there's a Dependable you've got to be able to depend on one another people got to do what they say depend on one another you you know it breaks my heart when I see somebody waiting outside for an Uber you know and we should be mindful Maybe help one another so all these things are important dependable and then this you I can find I got scriptures down for all these a whole list of scriptures right there just all kinds of scriptures for every single one of these and the seventh thing that they say is you've got to have impact or result a team doesn't want to work on something that doesn't produce any results you don't want to go to a develop something and work on it and have meetings and all this and it absolutely performs no function you ever had one of those Mike no it it it's no good for nothing nobody wants to be in that team what are we what are we doing we want to see results right we want this pool we want people telling people about the gospel going to all the world preaching the gospel fulfilling the commission unashamed we want to have impact impact is a body that's why I was so pleased with Matthew's trip to India it had impact it wasn't going from one message Church to another message Church to another message church and everybody sitting back that was a nice sermon that was a nice sermon oh I really like the way that brother preaches and and nothing happening but man when you get 26 Pentecostal preachers amen get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the front of a whole bunch of other preachers that are battling and now they're saying we want you back in March we want you back in March that's why I told I said Matthew don't give this away God called you to do it let them use you there's something that they relate to you you can't give your circle of influence away have you injected the light of your life into the influence of the circle you're in just you know Matthew was in bed the other day had a bad back we're praying for him but he had a a doctor a surgeon and the minute that Matthew testified you know I believe the Lord Jesus Christ is going to make me well they cut him off good luck how many want to go to that doctor I like the doctor that prays for you ahead of time but one that believes in the Lord I let my doctor he comes out all he wants to know is he starts sharing his problems with me one doctor to the other doctor of the body doctor of the Soul it works in harmony you got to have results you're not going to be a part of something that's has a result now if we and let's go back to personal success are you having personal results in your life let's have some amen amen I I'm sorry I I I was trying to be more intellectual this morning but I just wasn't in me to do it maybe I got singleness of sight this morning just a few scriptures as we get ready to close the musicians can come Romans 121 through 18 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a live in sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service dependability and be not conformed to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that that is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say though through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think so soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all the members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one Member One of another having then gifts differently according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the portion of Faith or Minister let us wait on our Ministries or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation Arbor that which is evil cleave to that which is good and we could continue to read on from there I just wanted you to be aware of the body Ephesians also in Ephesians 2 2 and 20 and now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitteth and framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple of the Lord in whom ye also are built together for the inhabitation of the Holy Spirit and again also you're real familiar with Hebrews 10 and 24 and 25 it says let us consider one another to Pro to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the Assembly of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhort one another so much the more as you see the day approaching we just wanted you to be aware and as I gave my heart to you I really believe that God's Desiring us to grow as individuals and us to unite and care one for another as a body and each in your own heart I know we're a very diverse congregation with different languages different backgrounds different Customs different tastes all sort of differences but what we have in common is greater than our differences for he that is in you is greater than he who is in the World by one Spirit you are all baptized into one body One Faith and one Lord One Faith one baptism one Lord of us all the word of God so don't count yourself little count count yourself great don't count yourself unneeded we can't make it without you every single person in here this morning is what makes it work and we never want to be so big that people can come and go unnoticed let the Lord speak to your heart concerning one another Reach Out Lord one another love one another the scripture we just read said let us care one for another let us provoke one another under good works
