hearts we thank you you Lord may this be a place that you can do great things for people that are in need that they know the resurrected savior our lord Jesus still lives we ask you to bless us now in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated this morning this morning before we do anything um I want to play a portion of um from the sermon called God in Simplicity or God's revealed in simp uh hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same and it is is the portion of the tape where brother Brenham dedicated um the Tabernacle uh they remodeled the Tabernacle they rebuilt it they added on to it they totally changed it and he took the first few minutes uh thanking all the people that worked on it and and I'd like to do the same and uh our sound system is much better I've never heard myself preach before until this morning morning and and um and you know brother Mike and brother Billy and Brother David and Neville and Billy uh number two and all of them worked so hard to uh get our sound going and through the construction brother Tommy brother Andrew many of the brothers helped work many of you put a lot of effort into uh making this happen and and it's done for you so we'd like to thank all of you that labored it was uh your giving uh that made it your your offerings and your tithings have brought uh made this possible this morning so we certainly want to thank all of you in your effort we it's here to serve you I suppose we could have kept cramming into the other building but I don't know are the pews more comfortable amen I hope you're more comfortable uh I hope the air conditioning is good there might be a lot of little things that we don't know but we trust that as uh we go along we'll make adjustments and there's probably plenty of adjustments that need to be made but uh we're we're thankful for this this morning so let us and then right after we listen to this portion of tape we'll start our first service so uh I know people are still probably coming in and we're going to have to do a little better on that but listen now to as our messenger begins to speak to us about how that we should conduct ourself and what the purpose of the house of the Lord is so the first person I wanted to preach in this church or to speak in this church was God's seventh angel messenger the prophet of Malachi for so God bless you this morning as we listen God bless you Brothers now in the building I think that we ought to have in this if it's been dedicated or going to be dedicated in a few minutes to the worship of God we should keep it that way we should never buy ourselves in the building we should never uh do any business in this Auditorium here it should never be done in here that is such as permitting ministers that come in and sell books and everything no matter what it is there's other places to do that water we we shouldn't buy and sell in the house of Our Lord it should be a place of of of worship holy consecrated for that purpose let give us a nice place let's dedicate it to him and dedicate ourselves with it to him and now this may seem a little rude but it's not a place to visit it's a place of worship we should never even murmur a word inside of here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary we should never rally around we should never run through the building or let our children run through the building and so doing this feeling not long ago that of doing this we constructed it so we could take care of all of it now we have this set here of course many people are strangers the Tabernacle folks know this that the building is going to be dedicated to the service of the almighty therefore dedicating ourselves let's remember when we enter that Sanctuary keep still to one another and worship God if we want to visit each other there's places we may visit each other like that but never walking around where you can't hear yourself think and some person come in and they just don't know what to do see it's so much noise and things it's just humanly and I've seen it in churches until it has made me feel real bad because we do not come into the sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other we come here to worship God then go to our homes this Sanctuary is dedicated to worship when stand outside talk anything you wish to as long as it's right and holy go to one another's homes visit one another places but when you enter that door be quiet you come here to talk to him see and let him talk back to you the trouble of it is we do too much talking and don't listen enough then when we come in here wait on him now in the old Tabernacle there might not be one person present this morning that was there the day of the dedication when major olry played the music and I stood behind Three cross is here to dedicate the place I would not permit anybody the Usher stood at the door to see that nobody talked when you're done your talking outside you come in if you desire to silently you come to the Altar and prayed silently you walk back to your seat opened up the Bible what your neighbor done that was up to him you had nothing to say if you want to talk to him say I'll see him outside I'm in here to Worship the Lord you read his word or set quietly then the music sister Gertie I don't know where she's here this morning or not sister Gibbs the old piano I'll be set back in this corner the best of my remembrance and she would play softly down at the cross where my savior died some real sweet soft music and and then until it come time for the service and the song leader got up and led a couple of congregational songs and then if they had some outstanding solo they sang it but never just a bunch of carrying on and then the music continually played and then when I heard that I know it it's my time to come out when a minister walks into a Congregation of people praying and the anointing of the spirit you're bound to hear from Heaven that's there's no way to keep from it but if you walk into confusion then you you're you're so confused and the spirit's grieved and we don't want that no we want to come here to worship we have lovely homes and I'm going to speak about just in a minute and so forth at home where we visit our friends and take them this is the house of the Lord now there's little children now little babies now they don't know no different they the only way they can get what they want is cry for and sometimes it's a drink of water sometimes they need attention and so we have by the grace of God dedicated a room it is called on the list a cry room but uh it's right straight in front of me it's other words where the mothers can take their Bab babies now it's never bothers maybe me here at the pull pit maybe I won't even notice it being anointed but these other people sitting near and it bothers them see and they come here to hear the service so the mothers is your little baby starts whimpering you can't help that well sure it's a you should you ought to bring it a real mother wants to take her baby to church and that's thing you should do and we've got a room there that where you can see every corner of the building all the auditorium and a speaker there to where you can control the volume any way you want to with a a little toilet in the end and water basin and everything just exactly for the mother's convenience with chairs and things you can sit down place to change your baby it needs to be changed and everything setting there it's all fixed and then many times teenage children and sometimes adults or get the you know young people of past notes or cut up or something in church now you're old enough to know better than that see you should know better than that see you shouldn't come here if you expect to be a real man someday and raise a family to the kingdom of God then start it off in the beginning you see and and act right and do right and now of course now the ushers stands at the corners of the buildings and so forth and if any carrying on they they're ordained as their Duty and set here in the front that in a case of someone getting misbehaving there are commissioned to ask the person to keep quiet then if they don't have that respect it would be better that uh someone else had to seat because there's somebody that wants to hear there's somebody come for that purpose to hear and that's what we're here for is to hear the word of the Lord and so everybody wants to hear it want just as quiet as they can be just as quiet as they can be that is not a bunch of talking and carry on or somebody worshiping the Lord that's expected that's what it should be that's what you're here for is to Worship the Lord just if you feel like praising God or shouting just go right on see because that's what you're here for see but is to Worship the Lord in your own way of worshiping but there's nobody worships the Lord while you're talking and passing notes and you're helping somebody else to get away from the worship of the Lord see so we feel that that that would be wrong and we want to make that a ruling in our church that in our congregation that to this building this church will be dedicated to the kingdom of God and to the preaching of the word pray worship that's the reason you should come here to worship man and then another thing when service is over usually the people in churches I don't I don't think it share because I'm always gone see because I get away usually even in preaching other services anointing comes and Visions happen and I'm wore out and I step off into the room and maybe Billy or some of the man there take me on uh to home and let me rest a while till I get out of it because it's a very much of a stream and then I have seen churches old that where the children were permitted to run all over the sanctuary and and uh the adults standing and holling across the room to one another that's a good way to ruin the service coming at night or whatever time it is see as soon as the service is dismissed leave the auditorium you're through in the worship in they go out and talk to one another whatever you want to do if you got something you want to talk to somebody um to see you go with them or to their home or whatever it is but don't do it in the auditorium let's dedicate this to God Amen see this is his meeting place where we meet with him see and the law goes forth from the sanctuary of course and um I I believe that that would be pleasing to our Heavenly Father and then when you come and you get to find out that gifts are beginning to fall among now usually it I trust it'll never be here but when people have a new church the first thing you know the congregation get starchy you never want that to be after all this is a place of worship this is the house of the Lord and a spiritual gifts begin to come among you I understand that since I've been gone that people has moved in here from different parts of the country to make this your home I'm thankful grateful to God that I believe that the morning when I dedicated and laid that Cornerstone there as a young man I prayed for it standing to see the coming of Jesus Christ and when I did ow thousands of dollars and that you could take up an offering in a congregation this size and get 30 40 cents and our obligation was somewhat $15 $200 a month how could I ever do it and I noted I was working and I would pay it off I 17 years of pastoral without taking one cent but giving everything that I had myself outside my living and all that come into the little box on the back to the kingdom of God and people prophesied and predicted that within a year's time it would be turned into a garage Satan tried to take it away for one time in a flaw and a fraud of a lawsuit some man claim to hurt his foot while he's working on it and then let it go and then and sued and wanted to take the Tabernacle and for weeks I stood at the post but in spite of all the misunderstandings and the predictions and what they said she stands today is one of the prettiest auditoriums and the finest churches there is in the United States right from here as went the word of the Living God around the world around the world is constantly taking his circle around the globe from every nation under Heaven as far as around and around the world let us be thankful for this let us be grateful for this and now that we have a place to dwell in a roof under our head a clean nice Church to set in let's dedicate ourselves elves newly to the test and consecrate ourselves to Christ and brother Neville our Noble brother real Pastor servant of the Living God as far as that man knows the message he holds with it with all he's got that's right he's a gentle person he's a little uh afraid to not afraid I don't mean that but he's so so awful gentle he's just doesn't speak out you know like to to say a thing that's sharp and cutting or sit down or keep still I I noticed that listen to the tapes behind it but it so happens that I can do that so I uh I want you to remember my words this evening and this is all being taped see everything is taped and please let every Deacon stand to his post of Duty and remember that you're under a commission from God to hold that post sacred ever truste the same Pastor is to bring forth it isn't the pastor's place to have to say that it's the trustees are I mean the deacons for they are the police of the church that is if young couples come on the outside and blow horns and you know how they usually do or something like that meetings or get out there and mother sends her girl down here and she takes off out with some uh Renegade kid and run out there in a car and her mother thinks she's in church like that Deacon or seat of that you either come in here and sit down or I'm going to take you in my car and take you home to your mother see you must do that remember love is corrective always genuine love is corrective so you must be able to stand the correction and mothers know now that there's a place there for your babies you young kids know different than to run around over the village see and uh you had El know different than to talk and carry on your conversations in the auditorium see don't do that it's wrong it isn't pleasing to God Jesus said it is written my house shall be made a house of worship prayer out call the House of Prayer by All Nations and they were buying and selling and he platted ropes and ran the people out of the auditorium and we certainly don't want that to happen in this Sanctuary here so let's dedicate Our lives our church our task our service and everything we have to the kingdom of God now now I want to read some scriptures before we have the dedicational prayer and um and then it's just a rededication because real dedication happened 30 years ago now and uh then um then as we uh we read this scripture and talk on it for a few minutes I trust that God will bring his blessings to us and now uh there was another thing I was going to say yes where we used to have a recorders and so forth we got a regular room there where those who wants to take recordings there's special hookups and everything there that comes directly from the main m in there there's rooms robes everything for baptismal service and then one thing many people has always uh felt bad at me many people who really didn't know the scripture about having a crucifix in a church I remember one time oh something happened here about that I had a three crosses and a brother got All Shook Up because he heard another denomination say that a crucifix meant Catholic I want some student or somebody or some born again Christian to say the Catholics has got the option on the crucifix crucifix of Christ doesn't represent Catholicism that represents God the kingdom now Saints represent Catholicism we believe there's one mediator between God and man and that's Christ but Catholics believe in all kinds of mediators thousands of women and man and everything any good Catholic almost dies becomes an intercessor now crucifix of Christ represents Jesus Christ did you know the early Christians according to the the ancient history of the early church They Carried crosses on their backs wherever they went to signify and identify themselves as Christians now the Catholics claimed that with them of course they claimed they was the first ones but the Catholic Church wasn't even organized then but Christians packed the cross on you've heard people say crossback you refer that to Catholic it is the real Catholic the universal Holy Ghost Church of the world Amen correct we are Catholic we are the original Catholic the Bible believing Catholic see they are the church Catholic the organization we are free from that we are the continuation of the doctrine of the Apostles we are the continuation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all the things that the early church stood for and the Catholic church has none of them so they placed the crucifix here it was brought that was hued out of Olive Tree under where Jesus prayed that's a crucifix Tak years and was given to me by brother arganbright and I want to dedicate it with this church and how appropriate that every who hung it there I don't know who it was and hang it here to my to my left he pardoned the thief to his right that's me and another thing it represents as his head is bowed as you see is suffering any persons who are is looking over the Altar and he's expecting you he sinner he'll be looking down upon you later they'll have a little light sitting here that when the alar call is being made a light will flash on to that that when people are here to you say why do you need that you shouldn't have an image well then the same God that said don't make yourself any in images the same God said build two chons and tip their wings together and put them at the mercy seat where the People Prayed you see it's it's without understanding so that is inspired and directly hung in its right place and I'm so thankful to be the one at the right side I trust that he has forgiven me for I as far as literally stealing anything as I know I never did in my life but I've so misused this time till it stole that way and I done many things that I shouldn't do and I'm grateful to God this morning that he has forgiven my sins and now I want to read out of the book of 1 Chronicles 17 and just speak for about five minutes on dedicational service pray and then we're going into the message now in first Chronicles the the 17th chapter night came to pass as David set in the house that David said to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedar but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord remaineth under curse then Nathan said unto David do all that is in thine heart for God is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying go and tell my servant David go and tell David my servant brother thus sayeth the Lord Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel until this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one Tabernacle to another whereas I have walked with all Israel spake i a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to Feed My People saying why have you not built me a house now therefore thus sh shalt thou say unto David thus sayith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the Sheep coat even from falling the sheep that thou should us be ruler Over My People Israel and I have been with thee wh soever thou has walked and have cut off thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of great man that are in the earth I would like to say at this place that that David saw the same thing that we saw David said it is not right that you people have built me a house of Cedar and the Ark of the the Covenant of my God is still under curtains that was skins that have been solded together of sheep and animals he said it isn't right for me to have a nice home and the Ark of the Covenant of my God remaining in a tent so God put upon his heart to build a tabernacle but David being a man of of love and consecration to God yet he had shed too much blood so he said David speaking this in the presence of the prophet of that age which was Nathan and Nathan knowing that God loved David he said David do all that's in your heart for God is with thee what a statement do all that's in your heart for God is with you and that same night showing the consecration of David to the love of God and then to see the same night knowing that he was in the era that he was not permitted to do it God was graceful enough to come down and speak to Nathan I always like these words go tell Nathan my go tell David my servant that I took you from the Sheep coat just you wasn't nothing I I'd like to apply that here just a minute I took you from nothing and I I I give you a name you got a name like great name that's in the earth and I'd like to apply that in a in a confidential yet in a a way of making a point I was thinking that a few years ago I standing down in the city here and nobody cared for me nobody loved me I love people but nobody loved me because of the background of the family no disregards to my precious mother and father how I wish that Mama could have lived to walked in this Sanctuary this morning many of the oldtimers who plac their money to help build it here maybe God this morning let look over the banister but the family of brandom didn't have a very good name around here on account of drinking nobody had nothing to do with me I remember telling my wife not long ago just remember that I I couldn't get anyone to talk to me nobody cared for me and now I have to hide to get a little rest and now the Lord has give us this great place and and these great things that he's done and he give me a besid a bad name he give me a name liken to some of the Great Men and he's cut off my enemies wherever I went never been nothing standing before wherever it went but and how grateful I am for that and how would I ever know as a little ragged kid up here two or three blocks in her to the iner bille school one I was a laughing stock of the school from being so ragged skate on an Old Pond how did I ever know know that down beneath that pond laid the seed of a Lily that could bloom like this and how do I ever know that no one talking to me and yet he would give me a a name that would be honored amongst his people and now they David was not permitted to build a temple he could not do it but he said I'll raise up from your seed and he will build the temple and that Temple will be an everlasting Temple and upon your son the son of David will be an everlasting Kingdom he'll control Solomon David's son in the natural from his natural strength built a house unto the Lord a temple but when the real seed of David come the son of David he told him there would come a time that there wouldn't be one stone left upon the other of that Temple but he tried to Point them to another Temple John the Revelator over in the Book of Revelations he saw this Tabernacle Revelations 21 he saw the new Temple coming descending down from heaven adored as a bride was adored for her husband and a voice out of the temple said behold the Tabernacle of God is with man and God shall be with them and they'll wipe all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more hunger and no more sorrow no more pain or death for the former things have passed away then the true son of David as we're going to see in this lessons coming on in this week well then come to his Temple the temple of God the real Tabernacle which he has gone away to construct now for he said in John 14 in my father's house are many mansions and I will go what did he mean by that is already for ordained and I'll go to prepare a place for you and will return back to receive you to myself and of course we know that'll be in the great age to come and the true seed of David will take the throne which is Jesus Christ and there will reign over the church as his bride in the house with him and over the 12 tribes of Israel throughout all eternity amen and these little places as David could not build the true Tabernacle of God because he wasn't prepared to do it there was nothing he could do he was a Marl and shed blood so is it today to us we are not prepared to build the true Tabernacle of God there's only one can do that and it's being in its construction now but this little Tabernacle along with the temple it's Solomon building and along with the others are only temporarily places of worship until the time comes when the real Tabernacle will be set up upon the Earth and righteousness shall rain from Sky to Sky and there will be no more sorrow there will be no funerals preached in that Tabernacle there'll be no more weddings for the wedding will be one great wedding for eternity what a time that will be but let us purpose in our heart today that in commemoration and waiting for that Tabernacle to come that we will so characterize ourself by his spirit that we will worship in this place as if we were in that other place waiting for that place to come now let us stand to our feet and as I read the Holy script I saw new heavens and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth was passed away and there were no more seed I John saw the holy city of the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adored for a husband and I heard the voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with man and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself self shall be with them and be their God let us bow our heads now our heavenly father we stand in awe we stand in respect and in holy reverence and we ask you Lord to accept our gift that you've given us Grace money to prepare for a worship place for you there's nothing or no place that we could prepare upon the Earth that would be worthy for the the spirit of God to dwell in but we offer this to you as a token of of our love and feelings toward you Lord and we thank you for all the things that you have done for us and now the building and the grounds being dedicated long ago to the service and we thank you for memories of what has been and now Lord God as a vision broke to years ago expressing this that I seen an old buildings that the people once was in and they had been repaired and made new and I was sent back across the river now Lord God creator of heavens and earth we stand as the people of thy f we stand as the the the the people of thy kingdom and with myself and the pastor and the church the people we dedicate this building to the service of the almighty God through the name of Jesus Christ his son for the service of God and for reverence and respect of God and may the gospel so flow from this place tell it will cause the world to come from the four corners of the globe to see the glory of God going forth from it as thou H has done in the past May the future be many times greater father we now dedicate ourselves to the service to the [Music] word with all that's in US Hallelujah Lord the congregation and the people they dedicate themselves this morning to the hearing of the word and we as ministers dedicate ourself to the preaching of the word to be instant in season out of season reproving rebuking with all longsuffering as it's written there in the Cornerstone from 30 years ago you said the time would come when people would not endure sound Doctrine but would heat for themselves teachers having itching ears and be turned from the truth to Fable Lord as we have tried hold out the word to the people may we be inspired and strengthened with a double effort Lord as a double potion of the spirit strikes upon the place May the Holy Spirit as it was in the day of the dedication of the temple when Solomon prayed the holy spirit in the form of the pillar of fire and Cloud came in the front door rolled up around the cherin went over to the holy place and there took its resting place oh God Solomon said If thy people be in trouble anywhere look to this holy place and pray then hear from Heaven Lord May the holy spirit this morning come in to every heart every consecrated Soul that's in here and the Bible says that the glory of God was so great unto the ministers could not even Minister for the glory of God oh Lord God let it repeat again as we give ourselves to thee with the church and dedication for Serv and it is written ask then you shall receive and we commit ourselves with our offering of the church this morning to you for service for the latterday lights for the evening time lights that we might bring consolation and Faith to the waiting people that's waiting for the coming of the bridegroom the dress a bride in the gospel of Christ for the Lord Jesus to receive this we dedicate myself brother Neville and the congregation to the service of God in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen am you may be seated God bless you this morning I think that couldn't be said any better I don't think there was a better prayer to dedicate us this morning so if the musicians would come we'll have our first service now that we know

that you're worthy you're the King of Kings you're the Lord of lords we praise you as Creator and maker of all heavens and earth all things that were made were made by you and nothing that was made father there's nothing that's made that was not made of you you are Lord You Are God we have not words to describe your majesty and your glory but we praise you this morning Father now we've come that you might speak to us that you might deal with our hearts father that our lives might turn from Darkness to light father that we might come running to you that the backslider might re-examine his position father that we may re rededicate it this morning we ask you to move in our midst and speak to our hearts we ask it in jesus' name we pray amen may God bless you may be seated it's nice to have everybody here with us this morning I think they told me that we ended up with a little over 400 people here this morning and that's a nice crowd uh this evening we'll have communion with the Believers uh at Communion now that's when the real Church comes out you have the Sunday church and then you have the real church and uh you know there's a lot of things that you know brother brah said that uh uh he was one of those guys that can sit down and and well I'm one of those preachers that can say what we need you know what I mean so I we're not trying to win friends but we're trying to serve God Amen and so we we we just encourage you another thing I'd like to encourage everybody to do is I'd like you to treat Church like work how many comes late to work a half hour and 45 minutes late you know I really think it it's a tremendous insult to the Lord that we make it the church our work on time to get something that's carnal and yet we roll into the house of God 35 45 minutes late and expect his Spirit to move amen so I want to say that because I I I want to share with you this morning what I stand for and what it is that I preach from this pulpit and and I'm not perfect you know I'm late occasionally myself in fact brother brm said that he was always they said that they called him the late William Brandon but that was because he was about God's business you know have an interview or have a vision or be praying for somebody you know about God's business sometimes I I I wonder what it is that we hold dearest you know what our priority is and what it is that we we hold dear to ourselves and I think that reflects a lot sometimes and so try to police everything as we heard brother brm said they're the policemen uh of the church and it it's very difficult for them uh when everybody's comes late and comes pouring in late and of course many of you that know me I don't believe in culture you know what I believe I don't I don't believe there's cultures that allow anybody to break the word of God I I I'm a I'm a firm believer of that that culture's taught right and the reason people are late because they're taught to be late you know the reason people don't work is because they're taught not to work you know they were're taught those things but we're not here today we're here to only for one purpose and that is to be taught by the word of God this is our our our preeminence this is what everything is we stand for and I'm I'm trying to look out you know there's always certain people I look for so and my congregation's kind of moved all over the place so uh you know I'm trying to find many of you and U to fellowship with you but um the prophet of God made a statement he said when the church is in order and everybody comes in and they're praying and they they've came in and they've read their Bible he says and the minister comes out he says God's fixing the move and so it's real important so uh that's why I I I'm saying that's important to uh come into your posted Duty and be there that God could really do something and and it's like anything that's new there's all kinds of little um what do they call that that word tweaking is that a correct word where you you have to adjust this a little and adjust that a little and pretty soon we'll get it all together uh We've started now to uh work on our fellowship hall next St so until that's ready uh we're going to use it for foot washing for the Sisters but uh we just advise everybody just to probably stay out of that part of the church if you could and and and do the best you can to uh adhere to the things that our Prophet told us this morning Amen Let Us stand this morning we let's turn in our bibles if we could to the gospel of St John in the first chapter and the first verse and we'll read a couple of verses here this morning and it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him all things were made by the word word yes nothing came into existence until it was spoken all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was in and and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word your precious name we pray amen God bless you we certainly uh welcome any visitors and those of you that have come this morning to share our first service with us when we were reading and listening this morning there was a statement that made that kind of uh stood out to me uh especially and I I will read it to you uh he says let's dedicate this to God this is his meeting place where we meet with him now this is a statement that struck me and the law goes forth from the sanctuary of course and I believe that that would be pleasing to our heavenly father and he made that statement and I I I it struck my heart in a different way because we have such a uh certain ideas in our mind of what words mean and of what uh uh we categorize things if I could say it that way and so a lot of times when we hear the word law the prophet of God says the law goes forth from here so the law of God goes forth from the pulpit from the word of God he says this is where we come to meet him and this is where the law Goes Forth but a lot of times in our heart we think the law automatically means uh that it's a set of rules or it it it's the Old Testament it it it's uh the way that they used to worship and it was the things they used to do the washing of hands the uh the not working on the Sabbath all the different ways that they dressed in everything and so the minute we we hear the word law we think oh something that is a uh uh put upon us you know and we talk about it in the scripture the law of sin and death and that man didn't know what sin was until the law came and and so our our thinking is of the law is Thou shalt not Thou shalt not commit adultery a man didn't know he could run after Maybe by his nature he would go and maybe uh run uh and freely but then the law came and said if you're married then you don't do these things outside the holy Covenant of marriage you don't commit adultery now to break that law to him then became sin you know a lot of people maybe they would find something on the road or they would find something or they saw something that they felt that they needed and somebody else didn't need and so they would go take it from them and they could say okay and they didn't they didn't know they every man lived un himself self according to his own measure according to his own righteousness and so I might take something and I didn't know that was wrong until the law came and said Thou shalt not steal and then you and maybe you wanted what somebody else had and then the law come and says Thou shalt not covet you know so the law began to govern so there there was a the law of sin and death is the law law that governed sin so the law governed sin it kept man's actions into a place that he wouldn't sin so the law of sin and death that law of God was uh the the law of sin or the law of death it it governed the sinful nature of Man by law and and that was necessary but there's another law and I would just if I could uh just share with you this morning maybe uh from my own thinking uh there's another law that goes forth and and there's the law of the word and you say well what's the law of the word well the law of the word is it never fails and it never changes that's a law that it never that that's something that you can live by and that's how we stay in order in society as we live by laws and rules and we know those laws and rules and therefore we know what to expect and and then we have people that that uh uh police those laws and rules and if someone is Breaking the Rules and Breaking the laws and then we apprehend that person and and uh we try to end the disruption and uh and so we have a disruptor as Christians how many knows who our disruptor is it's the devil you know that's all he wants to do is disrupt the order of God and disrupt the word of God that's what he does that's the whole thing that Satan wants to do is he wants to discredit the word of God he wants to make the word of God of none effect he doesn't want all of us to ever come to the realization that the word is unchanging and it's always true there's one thing you can count on is you can count on the word of God yeah if you read it 50 years from now it'll say the same thing if you if the people that were reading it a hundred years ago we reading the same thing so it doesn't change and God doesn't change he doesn't change so we know that that's a the a law a law of God that he's an un changing God if he ever does one thing one way he'll continue to do it the same way every time you can count on that that's why testimony is so important for a Believer is because it allows them to hear what God did for somebody and then that person can say if that person did that if God did that for them he can do that for me because he's the same and when that person says I I read This Promise in the word of God and I stood on this promise and I believed this promise and that promise comes to pass you can sit back and know that there's hope in the camp there's life in the camp because there's the word of the camp and where there's word there's life because this is the light of men and it's the life of men and the word of God is the life of men okay and so we have that law so what goes forth from the house of God is the law but it's not the Ten Commandments law it's not the law of that the children of Israel lived under it's the Gentile law of Grace and that law is that we have the word we have an unfailing promise that God keeps his word and if we live by that word and we walk in that word that word promises us it will produce word and so we can rest there it's a resting place for the believer that it it doesn't change with time it it doesn't change with morals it it as the World falls apart the believer doesn't have to fall apart in fact that's a time that the believer needs to take the word of God and cling to it ever so more because it's the the word of God and so that's a law that is brought forth and there's another law that we've been talking on the law of the seed but and we we know the law of the seed so when God created heaven and earth and he said let there be he created it by his word the heavens and earth were framed by the word of God so there was nothing in the beginning but God God had thoughts and then God expressed those thoughts and he said let there be light and there was nobody knew what light was if we were on the other side of it this is part of the law of the word that God is his own interpreter he interprets the word so if I said let there be light well you wouldn't know what I was talking about or what light was until light appear That's right so for example if you have never seen a piano or you had never seen an organ you you have no idea in fact that word hadn't even registered in your mind that you could make an association and I said let there be a piano and organ well you would have to sit back and wait for what that I spoke to materialize and manifest before before you could make the interpretation and have the revelation of what it is the trouble with men is God says something and then they all start piping in their two cents this is what I think an organ is and we got one guy walking around here saying organ organ piano piano another guy's going piano piano piano but God's his own interpreter and God chose to reveal his word by Revelation and that's the law right I can't change that a group of men can't get together and come up with a definition and say we will decide it means this or we will decide it will mean this or I think this is what the people can understand let me tell you a child can understand the word of God the word of God doesn't change God reveals the word of God and God interprets his word by bringing it to pass that is a law that is the law that we want to preach from this Pulpit is the law of God the law of the word of God the law of the seed of God is that everything is going to bring forth of its own kind when he created the TR trees he said let there be trees Let There Be fruit and let the seed be in it he had a way that he was going to bring things to pass or bring things into existence so he spoke them into existence and after he spoke them into existence the way that they were going to procreate themselves or continue was by seed the apple tree drops its seed into the ground the every thing I don't know all the different ways that it comes forth but we've all come forth by seed by the plan of God by the plan of M so we know that there's a law of the seed and that seed is that everything brings forth of its own kind lies don't breed truth lies breed more lies lies produces lies you might Dress It Up up a little bit and make it look pretty and and and put a tuxedo on it and a top hat on it and give it a a a set of spats and you might say it but it's a lie nonetheless and the reason it was a lie because it come from the lie and Satan is a liar he's the father of all lies and there's no truth in them and anything that's contrary to the word of God is of the devil I don't care if you put a robe on it I don't care if you uh put a crown on it I don't care if you wrap a church around it I don't care if you wrap music around it I don't care how that you present it you can put a religious covering on it but if it's not the word of God is still the lie that's the law of the seed that will come forth of its own kind it'll produce its own kind it it'll it'll come out it and we also know that within the law of the seed is the law of reaping and sewing so all these things are laws that come forth because the law of God comes forth from the house of God that's what our M was trying to tell us that's what our messenger was trying to tell the church ages that you just can't go make your own religion and think you're going to get to heaven you've got to come God's provided way there's no way around that so it behooves us to examine ourselves and find out what law that we're living on are we living under the law of self-righteousness are we living under the law of our own conclusions are we living under the law of our own intelligence a man told me one time I'm going to examine the message and see if it's right I said God the law of God is that I I'll build my church upon Revelation not conclusion not education when you get a revelation from God be true to it if you're true to it and there's air in it God will correct correct the air by the word he'll not let you go astray if your heart is pure so we we know that that's a law and we've been talking on the law of the Sea The Law of the sea and again this morning I I'm explaining to you where I stand in the gospel what my vision is what it is that I preach and why that I preach it I want you to have a full understanding a full disclosure to you why that I play tapes why that I do the things you ought to know you have a right to know those of you that support the ministry and those of you that put your money into building this building as our messenger mentioned he he said you have a right to know what is it that brother McGary believes what's the the core heart of what he stands for and how he thinks and what he believes and why he goes the direction that he goes and I'm going to be honest with you this morning okay and share it why so there there's a a a law of revelation we find it in Amos 3 and 7 and I'm putting these laws together to give just a little moment before I share with you my heart and this is a law that I sincerely believe for I'll do nothing unless I reveal it to my servants the prophet That's the Law of Revelation that's how God chose to get a message to his people that he would reveal that prophets spoke to God lip to ear that's how they spoke to God God spoke to them and then they spoke and and so in understanding those laws I and I'm not here to speak of myself this morning but I I I I want to share my heart with you of what I think and where I think that we are as a people and where I think that we are in the plan of God and uh you are entitled to completely different viewpoints there's many people that believe that we're on the midst of a a great Revival I don't believe that okay I don't believe there's a great big gigantic Revival coming to the church our messenger told us the Revival's over so we're not looking for what swept this country in the 30s 40s 50s and through the 60s because there came a time when this country rejected the word of God and he said that on every corner they're crying Revival Revival God's going to send a Revival God's going to raise up this nation oh that just re reminds me when and the the Prophet come him up mik he says oh take these horns and go out and drive him from the land and he said isn't there one other yeah but that guy we don't want to hear for him he said I saw Israel scattered his sheep you know and because he'd prophesied so how's there going to be Revival when the seventh CH age messenger said it was over that America had their Revival but most people thinks the Revival is going back to G glic I don't want to go there so we're we're not looking for that but we are looking for something yes sir that I think it's the greatest opportunity that man has ever had and I'd like to illustrate that in my own little way to morning and have you place yourself within this illustration so we know that God has a word and when God speaks his word it will come to pass law of the word right it will not fail it will come to pass we also know that God never speaks anything unless he has an intention and a reason for doing it there's no vain words in the gospel there's no vain sentences in the message of the hour there's no vain stories you might think well those are corny stories they're not corny for somebody that's laying on their deathbed they're not corny for someone that's so desperate they can't find a way out there's they're not corny to somebody that doesn't even uh is so far away from religion and association with preachers that they have no hope yet God knows what he's doing every word was spoken just for a reason and for a purpose you can count on that there's and and the the wonderful part about the word of God is you take the whole of it you don't take part of it man doesn't live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so that that's what we live by so when God spoke his word he put it in seed form and we know that he said that he that maybe some will plant it and water it he says but that he would plant it he would water it and he would raise it up by his Spirit sayith the Lord so we know that God it had planted a seed and not only did he plant a seed in the natural sense he planted a spiritual seed all of you that are here this morning are here because there was something in you that called you you say well I was just invited to hear no you receive that invitation because something inside of you uh connected you might you might dress it up and call it curiosity uh you might try to put your you know your shades on your sunglasses on that you might be identified you know oh I just come because I was curious no you came because there's something inside of you that's moving on you cuz God's moving and God wants to take you from where you are to where that he wants you to be that's what God does that's what he wants God is not against us God's for us amen amen if you're out in sin he doesn't want you to live in sin he wants you to know the joy and Liberty that we have in Christ Jesus he wants you to know the the the joy of Salvation and and what it means that that that's what his heart his heart is toward you he loves you his thoughts are good he said oh if man could just understand the thoughts that I have for them that they're good they're Pleasant they're they're blessing so God does not want us to die in the Trap Of Satan and Satan appears as an angel of Light Satan comes in a religious garment Satan comes spewing lies out of his mouth and misinterpreting the word of God and no matter how blessed you might feel that it is and what a great sensation it is God is obligated to his word that's the law and God provided it away and man can't come up with another way to get to God they can't dress it better they can't speak it better they can't put it together better God's provided the way it was his word and he provides the way to man I don't have a right to change it no matter how smart that I think I am I don't have a right to go in here and put these scriptures together to make it say something it doesn't the law of the word is God interprets his word and brings it to pass but also the law of the Church of lady oia is I counsel thee to th eyes have that thou might see that you might see this word that's manifesting and coming to pass in this age we're at the end time Iraq fire fires missiles at Israel you talk about unstable you don't know who's going to push what button it it's it's a time to be sincere so knowing these laws it's important to see how that God works and it's it's very obvious right in front of us our messenger said God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same so he it's very simple what he does it's so simple that it's happening right in broad daylight amen right before our eyes it's coming to pass and if if if we don't have eyes Sab that we might see in other words we you you put s Sab in your eye to clean out all the stuff that's blocking your vision to to make your eye see clearly to so that you can focus so he says I give you eyes have that you can get the junk out of your eyesight that you can get the confusion out of your eyes that that your vision might come clear and you might be able to see what it is that I'm really doing how many wants that I do I I want to know what he's doing if I could place this in here I'll do nothing unless I reveal it first to my servant the prophet excuse me I believe a prophet came in this age Vindicated proved now you might say there's no way that you can't say he wasn't a prophet now you can say he was a false prophet that's your own opinion if you would like to do that you can't say it wasn't a prophet he saw things from behind he saw things in the future and he saw things present there's only one person I know that's omnipresent like that and that's God and God does nothing until he reveals it first to his servant the prophet and we know that this messenger came to this age there was a certain time in the calendar of God it with a certain condition and a certain events to take place on this Earth that this Prophet would arrive in amen I we could go into the Book of Revelations and talk about the Four Winds and the four corners and the angel starting that but it it was all in this time that this messenger was to arrive on the scene and we know the biggest signpost or flashing red light of the sign of this prophetic coming of this visitation by the Lord Jesus Christ to his church through a prophet messenger was the condition of Lady oia he says as it was in the days of Lo ladyo uh I mean as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man as it was in the days of Sodom so we understood that the signpost or the flashing red light to the believer to catch their attention to apply the isav is that when this world begin to get in a Sodom condition and I hope I don't have to go through the that are taking place in our country [Music] now to let you know you're in a Sodom condition but that isn't for us to have an agreement oh we're all in a it's for us individually to consider our position in the kingdom of God at the time and moment that we're in that's what we got to con consider I know what it's like to be a teenager and run with your buddies and uh you know the hot rod down the road and to drink and to smoke and you know get high and listen to music and life's just a whirlwind you know the wages of sin is death but God's got a gift for you and is eternal life and you don't want to walk away from that I imagine there's people right in here that could testify this morning that God dealt with their heart they're walked away and now they're thankful this morning to be [Applause] alive so okay it's and it's an individual Affair and I hope this morning that you could you will purpose in your heart to dedicate your life amen to what is going to allow you to pass from this realm this corrupt realm of this corruptible flesh old wrinkling bone aing body that's going to go into the ground and step over into an eternal body one that will live forever cu the gift of God's eternal life Hallelujah I want to do that I want to make that transition I I want to come to that place that I can be raptured that I can be translated and may I use another word in relation to the seed that I could be harvested cuz we know that the seed is harvested when it's mature and when it's ripened and I'm going close now in the next few moments to with what that I want to speak and I I would like to use my favorite prop uh Beno been w i i commission you to stand right there and now you're a prophet okay all right so I know Beno doesn't look like this person on the outside but I'm wanting him to look like that person on the inside okay but this is for our illustration brother Brenham had a seed in him he had to have a seed in him because of the law of seed you say well he was a prophet he was born to prophet he had all the characteristics of a prophet but yet that seed had to be brought to a certain place first of all he had to get his attention how many know the price that the prophet of God paid PA for God to get his intent because of the work he had he lost family members he lost wife he was at the edge of a fall when he got down on his knees he said God if you give me a chance to live I'll never disobey you again when you think he was breaking up about and crying in that tape as he thought back to that day the price he paid losing his daughter losing his wife but yet the consolation that God gave him by seeing him on the other side that's the kind of God we serve so here's this little raggy kid we talked about that ended up having a name amongst all the saints of of God throughout the world the elected the lady of seean age and the lady o seean bride knew that this Prophet was their angel messenger that he was an angel sent from God to deliver a message to them right okay no other voice no other way a Onan Invasion God could have had a committee but God don't do it that way he has a law I will do nothing till I first reveal it to my servants the prophet now I've got to take this role in this little skit because I'm the narrator okay but in this skit I'm the word of God okay now here's my Prophet servant William brandom that Ben represents now I've got a job for him to do I've got a message for him to deliver because in my mind I knew what he was in the beginning but yet he's still in which form seed form so we know that the word of God must first come to a prophet so here's our our messenger and the word of God starts coming to him it comes to him in a burning bush it comes to him in a shed it come it keeps coming to him in different ways what's that word doing it's transforming him right into what that I had in mind for him now there's only one thing that's going to transform him and that's what the word the word's the only thing that can bring him into what it was that was spoken right you know many times I say this and people just sit back and look at me but Jesus was a part of the Bride right right how else could he be a kinsman redeemer the only difference was he wasn't born in sin shaped in iniquity and he didn't come into the world speaking lies but yet he was tempted every way that we're tempted he was tempted he was a man but yet God dwelt in him and even he learned obedience by the things he suffered I want you to understand God can't break his line okay so Jesus made this statement right I do nothing until the father First shows me amen okay he was the prophet of all prophets he was the prophets that they all looked to and he spoke lip to ear with the father him and the father were one we're a little lower than that I know some people don't think they are but reality is we're way lower than that so as God begin to speak and show his prophet and reveal things to his Prophet the godhead water baptism right remember the vision he he wondered about the rain falling on the just and the unjust he was going through all this and then he he he remembered and he saw the back of God and he he he saw the things raise up all those things that he's sharing with you were things that God was sharing with him right and the things that God was sharing with him we're transforming him into what that he was going to be I think our illustration set now so now so now the word of God is coming it comes to the prophet can now we find out that the there came a time he was going to open the seals right right we so we have the revelation of the godhead the revelation of serpent seed all these Revelations were first coming to him and transforming him and making him into what that he was he he didn't bypass the word to do it but because of the law of the law of Revelation that God could do nothing unless he revealed it first to his servant before he could get it to you he had to give it to him right wonder and it had to have the same effect on him that it would have on you else it's not the law of the word so you understand so here he is he's living his life and God's opening him his door here he took him to a camp meeting didn't he excuse me to show to show uh one guy speaking in tongues and another guy and one being honest and one being this and and and he was going through all those things right and all those things were maturing him bringing him into the ministry forming him into that son of man forming him in to that wave offering that first seed that came to maturity how many understands that that by the word yes that was brought to him it brought him to maturity and then that sheep offering was waved over the people now so the same word that's coming to him is now because of the law of Revelation we're not getting the word secondhand and it's not secondhand word and it's not manhandled word the same word that was spoken to him he turned around and spoke it to us the same word that brought him to maturity is the same word that's to bring the bride to maturity it's the same word it's the same message now when when that flock is that that thing in the Harvest in the Wheats in the Harvest and he used those things for a purpose you know the wind would come has anybody ever seen the wind blow across a grain field and how it all just folds down and pretty soon it looks like waves just going across it's a magnificent sight and the wind would come and the rain would come and they would and and the wind was a type of the move of the spirit and the move of the spirit would come and it would move and the rain would come it would be blessings but that wasn't what brought the seed to maturity it was the word that brought the seed to maturity it was the word that he was seeing every day that was being revealed to him and transforming him to where he learned you can't do God a service without it being his will all the sermons you hear that he's preaching were the very things that made him what he was he didn't live apart from his word if you will allow me that's why you can't separate the messenger from the message he becomes the interpretation of the word amen because now his life is a reflection of what God had in his mind this is how I want my Believers to live this is how I want my Believers to this is how I want my Believers to know me I want them to know I'm not three Gods I want them to know there's only one provided place of worship I want them to know the the things that that I've showed you I want you to speak them back to them that they too might become yes Sons and Daughters of God it's not the wind that does does it and it's not the rain that does it though when the rain falls praise God but I don't want a major unra the wind is wonderful it causes roots to grow but we don't want to Major on the Wind there's one thing that matures the bride and that's the same word not a handled word not a secondhand word God gave it to his Prophet The Prophet gave it to us God did not pick a Ministry a five-fold Ministry any Ministry anywhere to step in between you and that voice and say this is what he meant this is what he was trying to explain let me tell you what he was getting at the word will do it by itself it's the word that matures and that's where I believe that the church is cuz we were told that what does she have to do now she has to lie in the Sun and ripen she's got to come to maturity she she's got to come to that place now we know the word word doesn't Quicken it's the spirit that quickens so God speaks his word and the Spirit by Revelation comes and makes that what does Quicken mean to bring to life to make alive the spirit comes to make the word alive in you not the rain alive in you not the wind alive in you but to make the word alive in you that's what it does the spirit is not even to speak of itself but to bring you into remembrance of all things that I said to me that's one of the best scriptures of a expl explanation of Revelation that there is I will I will reveal it to you yes all of us in here are on equal footing in equal ground because we all can hear the same voice and the same word there's no big eyes there's no little use the word will have the same effect on you yes amen that it has on everybody don't matter where you come from doesn't matter if you grew up eating rice or you grew up eating tortillas or you grew up eating uh weeds or whatever you call it it don't matter right don't matter what you ate didn't matter where you slept didn't matter when the word strikes the seed yes that seed will bring forth of its kind my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow oh you say Brother David what it is that's why I want you to know why my heart is so set on making that voice Available to You am why it's so important that you listen to the word of God for the age amen because it's not secondhand word it's the same word that he spoke to the prophet to take him from the Sheepfold as he typed himself to where that he almost had to hide because his gift was so great he just spoke it to us it was lying right there in what we listened to he said he did that his word did that his word came to me and kept me from running down this road running down that road he preached it to us in the way of a true Prophet a prophet stays with what the word what word was he staying with not man's interpretation of word not the historical Bible teachings of other ages not the not the conclusions that denomination made he was taking the word that was given to him from God lip ear Hallelujah that was the word that transformed him am where there wasn't Devils that could stand in front of them that could sit there and say I take every spirit in this building in my control in the name of Jesus Christ oh I love that that head go back he's here yes you can't hide now you think he popped out of bed one morning no he sat under that word yes that word he sat in that presence he let that word mold them he let that word bring to maturity he let that word just take every ounce of his own desire out of them until he was molded into a Son of God so much so that he could stand up in our presence and say who is this meis EDC who is this God in this form amen standing in front of you today doing the same signs and the same Wonders that were manifested before you what caused that the word the same word that's on those tapes the same word that God gave him he turned around and gave us and by the law of the word if that word produced that son that same word has to produce Sons and Daughters of God if it doesn't it breaks every law of God if it doesn't have the same effect on you that it had on him it breaks every law of God if if it doesn't bring the seed fruit to maturity that was in that seed then and it doesn't bring the seed that's in you to maturity then the law is broken and that's one thing that Satan can't do is he can't break the law of God amen you say Brother Davis what's the the desire of your heart I don't desire Fame I can honestly say that to you I don't desire popularity and I don't desire money but the desire of my heart amen is that every one of you comes to the full maturity as brother James Hayes shared this scripture with me at a very crucial time in my life he said herein is the love of God manifest that as he is so are we in this world that's what I want for our lives that's what I want for the congregation those of you who has recently joined us I don't want nonsense I don't want other people's teachings I don't want the way other people do things I want us to listen yes learn and transform that's as simple as I can put it because I heard a messenger say you're little Messiahs you're little Gods The Works that I do you will do also and I asked myself how did you do those Works brother Brandon he did those works because he sat under that word he was corrected he he he he was so public with us about his mistakes about his shortcomings about his battles why because he wanted you to know the word that God was giving him would do the same thing for you if you would listen to it and you would believe it it will transform you and harvest you and make you into a harvest Harvest of theable grain and that's what it's about it's not about going in and out of sin and in and out of the world it's not about all your mental battles being one day up and one day now that's all humanism but if you stay in that word that word will mature you if you stay with that word it will take the greenness out of you if you stay with what he said and you have an absolute of that word in your life it will produce a Rapture in you and I don't know any other way to explain it to you this morning I'm not an elegant preacher I know that I don't have the energy I had as a young man to run from one side of the stage to another that's never produced anything it's what said not how it said and I believe God showed us how it was to be said by how he spoke it to us so we're here to mature in the revealed word of the hour as it was revealed to God's servant the prophet William Mariam random that word is our doctrine that word is our truth that word is our example and you can't separate the messenger from the word amen I never meant brother brand the privilege of meeting his sons and his daughters his children many of his Associates and managers you know as much as I've enjoyed those times none of them can ever do for you and to you other than what's on those tapes you say why do you preach then because on the tapes he said to do it that's and obedience is better in sacrifice in closing I'll say this the word of God is what positions you amen nothing else positions you but the word because the word and each of you he tapes whatever seed God planted in you whatever it is that God wants you to be the word is the only thing that can bring that into maturity when men leave the voice and the word to do the maturity they are positionally placing themselves right yeah the scripture warned against lording over God's Heritage they want to take a position of leadership they want to take a position of example amen they want to they they they want to position the church where they think it should be positioned amen I have no idea amen of what God's going to do I'm not looking for chair wheelchairs to come down this aisle though they may I'm not looking for anything to happen but what he's got planned yes and I know there's only you can't produce it a sheep doesn't produce it Bears wool a sheep made to do what eat grass bear wool what's the Bride made to do eat word bear word not produce it not make it happen we're not trying to make a Revival we're not trying to fill buildings we want to mature we want to Bear wool and that's my stand that's what drives me that's what makes me live cuz if I could identify myself if you would allow me I was a ragged long-haired drug addict Tippy sitting on a rooftop just left the Catholic church after trying to study to be a priest so despondent so away from God that I was on the verge of joining a motorcycle gang and becoming a Hell's Angel and if it wasn't for the grace of God I probably wouldn't even be alive today but he came into my life and he came into my life by a voice within my spirit not lift the ear but within my spirit within my Consciousness and within my imagination he he read to me Romans chapter 1 and saved me and changed me amen then a few years later I sat in a a little home in San Diego with the hippie comune that gathered up because I went to street preaching and and different people on the street came and they lived with us maybe my friend Bill L is listening this morning if you are brother Bill God bless you and we gathered together and we put on a little message called Christianity versus paganism and there was that voice and I knew that was the voice of God I knew it was the voice that transformed me and I knew it was the voice that was going to take me all the way I believe it and I listened to another tape and it was called the love of God or when love projects and then I knew that though that tape condemned me me and I didn't think that maybe I wasn't saved after all then that voice came to tell me that God loves me and I can say this morning I'm not worthy but God loves me I couldn't tell you why I've given him no reason to but he does and I'm appreciative and then I listened to a tape called choosing of the bride and I packed my bags and I moved to Montana and lying in my bed in Montana God told me that I'd preach the gospel in Texas I didn't know if it was one time or not it took me several years to get here and we got here had my children with me for the whole journey my wife sister lesie who I think is a model of a pastor's wife am an example of a real Christian lady my boys may be Renegades but my daughter is always going to be my sweetheart and I'm here today to stand for this message to preach this message and to play these tapes to you I ask you to endure with my fleshly side and my human side because I'm working on that too yes sir but that's not the part that does you any good there's only one thing that does you good and that's the voice of the word of God for this day let's stay with that voice amen God bless you amen it's on S this morning aren't you thankful we have the word of God Amen there's no weapon that can defeat the Devil except the word of God amen amen father I see that we were drawing a line in the S and I want to be standing by your oh and your oh and let your
