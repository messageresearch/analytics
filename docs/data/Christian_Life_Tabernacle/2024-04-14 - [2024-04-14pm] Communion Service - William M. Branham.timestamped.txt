[48:35] worship amen father that's what we come
[48:38] to
[48:39] you we've set
[48:42] this house aside this
[48:46] morning as we played the voice of our
[48:51] Messengers father dedicating this place
[48:54] to
[48:55] worship along with dedicating ourselves
[48:59] father we thank you for your goodness to
[49:04] us we ask you to bless us this evening
[49:07] in Jesus precious
[49:09] and holy name we pray amen amen let's
[49:15] turn in our Bibles today this morning
[49:19] to
[49:21] um Isaiah
[49:23] 53 and read in the scriptures found
[49:27] there amen now this is more like
[49:31] it you know I like being assembled with
[49:34] the real
[49:35] believer amen well you say well how can
[49:38] you say that Brother David well the
[49:40] prophet of God said you won't be there
[49:42] if you don't take communion and foot
[49:44] washing I can't change
[49:46] that you know I wish I
[49:49] could uh I think if the word of God
[49:52] wasn't so plain I would be a
[49:55] Universalist
[49:57] you know what that is don't you where
[49:59] God's so good he's saving everybody in
[50:01] the universe at one time it's called
[50:05] universalism and uh it it it's a uh good
[50:11] maybe Doctrine to live by but it's a bad
[50:14] Doctrine to die by you know so uh we we
[50:19] we certainly don't want to be that but
[50:22] we we we trying to encourage people uh
[50:26] maybe
[50:27] in a little different approach but to
[50:30] just examine ourselves and I think the
[50:33] terminology I think they use uh amongst
[50:36] the young people and everything and
[50:38] athletes is to step up your game and I
[50:41] think that's what they say right you got
[50:42] to step it up you got to move it to a
[50:45] higher level you know and that's what
[50:48] we're wanting the Lord to do we're want
[50:50] his Spirit to stimulate us to move us to
[50:54] a higher level I noticed in the uh tape
[50:58] this morning that brother Ram talked
[51:00] about young people and every thing
[51:01] passing notes well don't say no I don't
[51:04] pass notes I send
[51:06] text you know what I mean or I snapshot
[51:11] or uh Zip Zap and whatever you call it
[51:17] you know uh it's all the same you know
[51:20] the bottom line was pay attention right
[51:23] so and and we'll grow in the Lord
[51:27] so uh uh there's a lot of adjusting
[51:31] going on and I think the bigger
[51:33] adjustment is for us on this hand I
[51:36] think that all of a sudden you can't
[51:38] even see everybody in the back and and
[51:41] you're tying trying to focus and uh so
[51:46] it's pretty overwhelming plus it
[51:49] was uh I don't know how to say it but
[51:51] when they started setting out folding
[51:53] chairs I thought oh my
[51:57] you know what have we done you know and
[52:00] so I I mentioned to somebody I said I'm
[52:02] just going to have to start really
[52:04] preaching hard he said the harder you
[52:06] preach the more they'll come so one
[52:10] brother come up to me and he said oh I
[52:12] can't wait till you get that over there
[52:14] ready because we're going to fill that
[52:16] up by the end of the
[52:18] year and uh I was looking at Billy and I
[52:22] saying are you ready to pass her yet or
[52:24] you know any anybody want this job uh uh
[52:29] because you just can't you know the
[52:32] hardest part is you just can't know
[52:35] everybody you know and I've always been
[52:39] a person because I grew up with so many
[52:42] complexes that I always had a tight
[52:45] circle of friends I knew everybody I
[52:49] hung around with you know and if I
[52:52] didn't like somebody I didn't just
[52:55] didn't have nothing to do with them well
[52:57] that's hard to do as a pastor you know
[53:00] you can't you can't pick your sheep you
[53:02] know what I mean whoever and God changed
[53:05] my heart you know and uh and now I want
[53:08] to know everybody you know and I don't
[53:11] have the ability and and plus I could go
[53:13] into all my uh weaknesses you know that
[53:17] I have facial recognition disorder and
[53:20] I've got Ada you know attention deficit
[53:24] disorder and I got all these disord ERS
[53:26] so and all God just says you can't use
[53:29] your
[53:31] excuses so you can't use your excuses
[53:34] and you can't
[53:36] use anything
[53:38] that ability you have so I guess we're
[53:43] just and we'll talk about that here in a
[53:45] minute I guess we're just stuck with the
[53:48] word of God Amen that's a good thing to
[53:51] be stuck with is it let's read this
[53:54] uh scripture here you know this is um
[53:58] this is a very good scripture
[54:02] and we want to read it just a few verses
[54:06] maybe down
[54:08] uh through the uh sixth verse and and
[54:13] then maybe you could read it later most
[54:15] of you probably know the rest of it it
[54:18] says who hath believed our
[54:21] report and to whom is the arm of the
[54:25] Lord revealed
[54:26] amen for he shall grow
[54:29] up before him as a tender plant and as a
[54:35] root out of the dry ground he hath no
[54:39] form nor
[54:41] comeliness and when we shall see him
[54:45] there is no beauty that we should desire
[54:50] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[54:55] man of sorrow and acquainted with grief
[54:59] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[55:04] he was
[55:05] despised and we esteemed him
[55:08] not surely he hath borne our griefs and
[55:12] carried our sorrow yet we did not but
[55:16] yet we did esteem him
[55:20] stricken smitten of God and
[55:24] Afflicted but he was was wounded for our
[55:28] transgressions he was bruised for our
[55:31] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[55:35] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[55:40] we are healed we all like sheep have
[55:43] gone astray we have turned everyone to
[55:48] his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[55:52] him the iniquities of us all and let's
[55:56] turn over to
[56:02] Matthew and we and I'd like to read
[56:13] uh and then it says here in the 16th
[56:17] verse it
[56:22] says but wherefore shall I liken this
[56:27] generation it is like unto children
[56:31] sitting in the market and calling unto
[56:35] their
[56:35] fellows and saying we have piped unto
[56:40] you and and ye have not danced we have
[56:45] mourned unto you and ye have not
[56:49] lamented for John came neither eating
[56:53] nor drinking and they say he hath a
[56:57] devil the son of man came eating and
[57:01] drinking and they say Behold a man
[57:04] gluttonous and a wine bibber a friend of
[57:08] publicans and sinners but wisdom is
[57:12] Justified of her children now we'll skip
[57:15] to the um 25th verse and it
[57:20] said and at that time Jesus answered and
[57:25] said I thank thee oh
[57:29] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[57:34] thou Hast hid these things from the wise
[57:38] and prudent and hath revealed them unto
[57:42] babes even so father for it seeth good
[57:47] in thy sight Heavenly Father we ask you
[57:50] to bless your word your precious name we
[57:52] pray amen you may be seated this morning
[57:56] evening thank you very
[58:01] much just a
[58:04] small excuse me just a small
[58:07] thought before uh
[58:10] communion uh tonight that uh we'd like
[58:15] to speak on I I think I probably ran off
[58:19] and left my notes in my office but we
[58:21] won't worry about it um we're not going
[58:25] to be long
[58:27] anyway I'd like to read something that
[58:29] the prophet God said he used these
[58:31] scriptures
[58:33] in God hidden
[58:35] Simplicity and uh he said God hides
[58:39] himself in Simplicity and reveals
[58:42] himself in the same and you know Isaiah
[58:46] is such a beautiful
[58:49] scripture uh that expresses that here
[58:54] it's absolutely prophesied and if you
[58:56] continue reading the Scripture it talks
[58:59] about whom he was numbered with and whom
[59:01] he was buried and it it
[59:05] describes
[59:08] uh in great
[59:10] detail the
[59:13] uh the crucifixion and the unfolding of
[59:16] the ministry of the Lord yet it totally
[59:20] went
[59:22] unrecognized and the scripture said like
[59:25] who would believe report you know whom
[59:28] is the arm of the Lord revealed and I
[59:31] love this scripture here when Isaiah
[59:33] says this a great thing he he it
[59:38] says he says he says uh surely he hath
[59:43] borne our grief in so here he was he was
[59:48] a a appeared to be a a a man that
[59:53] carried a great burden and a great great
[59:56] load um no doubt he found himself in the
[1:00:02] scriptures how many believe the Lord
[1:00:04] found himself in the scriptures in other
[1:00:07] words even at 12 years old as think of
[1:00:11] him as a child uh and we many times we
[1:00:18] take the scripture uh he learned
[1:00:20] obedience you know by the things he
[1:00:23] suffered but it it was wasn't that he
[1:00:26] was a bad boy and mommy and daddy were
[1:00:30] spanking him that's our natural Trend
[1:00:35] but here's a young man born of God the
[1:00:39] spirit of God's in him in fact he is the
[1:00:43] word of God made flesh at very young age
[1:00:48] he goes and begins to sit in the temple
[1:00:52] and he begins to hear the psalm readings
[1:00:57] and they're talking about the Messiah
[1:01:01] they're talking about the sacrificial
[1:01:03] lamb the word of God is being open to
[1:01:07] him as he sits there and and the more
[1:01:11] that he hears it the more he knows for
[1:01:14] this cause I have come into the world in
[1:01:18] other words he knew what laid ahead of
[1:01:21] him he could read in the scripture and
[1:01:25] his parents would no doubt shared with
[1:01:28] him maybe they had something in their
[1:01:30] home and and and he as a young boy he'd
[1:01:33] asked what was this and and they would
[1:01:37] say well that's when your father and I
[1:01:41] uh
[1:01:42] fled to
[1:01:45] Egypt and he would think about the
[1:01:48] scripture about how the children were
[1:01:51] slaughtered and Rachel wept for her
[1:01:55] children
[1:01:56] and that was a part of
[1:01:59] him and and and he bore
[1:02:02] that you understand he he understood it
[1:02:05] he the those scriptures
[1:02:08] resignated with him you say oh I I don't
[1:02:12] think he he did that at 12 years old
[1:02:16] he's sitting in the temple with the
[1:02:19] scribes and the scholars of the teachers
[1:02:22] and he's confounding them
[1:02:26] with the scripture so even at that age
[1:02:31] he could go out and look in the word of
[1:02:34] God and the word of God was unfolding to
[1:02:37] him it was unfolding his future to him
[1:02:40] and and and what what do you think that
[1:02:45] when he he realized who that he was and
[1:02:49] the part that he had to play think of
[1:02:52] the
[1:02:53] burden that he was under
[1:02:56] under think of what
[1:02:59] Revelation was really doing to him and
[1:03:03] yet when man looked at them they they
[1:03:07] they they spoke a truth in a way but not
[1:03:12] from their understanding they they
[1:03:14] thought he was afflicted he was stricken
[1:03:16] of God in other words this man's
[1:03:20] cursed you know what did they say he's
[1:03:24] got a what he's got a devil it's be
[1:03:28] elab I mean they're totally
[1:03:31] missing they're they're blind totally
[1:03:35] blind to the fact that this man not even
[1:03:39] 33 years old he he isn't he's not that
[1:03:42] he do he's not happy but he knows that
[1:03:45] he's carrying the sins of the world he's
[1:03:49] got
[1:03:50] discernment you know beyond the measure
[1:03:53] that we could even perceive that he knew
[1:03:56] what the thoughts and intents of their
[1:03:58] heart
[1:04:00] were you might think oh I'd like to have
[1:04:03] that no you don't how would you like to
[1:04:06] know what people really think of
[1:04:10] you you know you'd probably go jump off
[1:04:12] a bridge or something you know what I
[1:04:14] mean I maybe I shouldn't have said that
[1:04:17] but
[1:04:19] but what I'm trying to point out is how
[1:04:23] man misses
[1:04:24] it how he misses it so every time he
[1:04:28] heard he heard the scriptures and they
[1:04:31] were unfolding to him he was now
[1:04:35] learning The
[1:04:37] Obedience that he was going to have to
[1:04:41] obey to carry out the will of the
[1:04:44] father and that's why he would could
[1:04:47] easily turn and say I do nothing till
[1:04:50] the father reveals it to me I believe
[1:04:53] the father spoke to him through the
[1:04:56] scriptures I believe that he he he he
[1:04:59] read because he was able to say it is
[1:05:02] written it is written when he was
[1:05:04] tempted by Satan he he didn't act like
[1:05:08] he had some other sword or some other
[1:05:12] weapon against Satan he had the same
[1:05:15] weapon that God gave you he used the
[1:05:19] word he used the word so this this
[1:05:23] sorrow and this stricken that
[1:05:27] we that we laid upon him the the the
[1:05:30] grief that he had was for our
[1:05:34] behalf it it it was for it was for us
[1:05:39] that that they've seen it and here's the
[1:05:42] word of God uh uh coming to pass right
[1:05:47] before their eyes and they missed
[1:05:49] it and that's what he said who has
[1:05:52] believed our report who has believed
[1:05:55] what what that I've been preaching and
[1:05:58] what that I've been saying in other
[1:06:01] words they should have been able to
[1:06:02] recognize them by the very things that
[1:06:06] they
[1:06:07] believed but we know that they were
[1:06:10] blinded for our
[1:06:13] sake that's what they were they were
[1:06:16] blinded for so we as
[1:06:19] Gentiles could receive this
[1:06:22] gospel if if it would have unfolded
[1:06:26] and Israel would have believed and all
[1:06:29] God's people would have came back to him
[1:06:31] he could have taken re leadership right
[1:06:33] then and the Millennium would have been
[1:06:35] on right him Lord of Lord King of Kings
[1:06:38] Israel
[1:06:40] restored tell me that wouldn't have been
[1:06:43] something no it wouldn't have been
[1:06:45] something cuz we wouldn't be here but he
[1:06:50] did it for us cuz he knew he had a
[1:06:53] gentile bride amen and he was doing so
[1:06:56] when when you see these scriptures and
[1:06:59] you begin to see them unfold you also
[1:07:01] begin to see here's man looking at
[1:07:04] something totally
[1:07:06] wrong totally missing it because he hid
[1:07:11] himself in in such a humble man such a a
[1:07:16] young boy such a uh something that had
[1:07:19] no Beauty in him that would be desired
[1:07:22] his personality his nature wasn't one
[1:07:25] that was uh full of so much
[1:07:28] Charisma that uh people were just drawn
[1:07:32] to him he very humbly uh sat back he was
[1:07:38] Meek you know he was likeing UN MOS he's
[1:07:41] a Meek man he was a he he he was a a
[1:07:44] softspoken man but when he did
[1:07:48] speak the world Stood Still never was
[1:07:52] there a man that spoke like this man in
[1:07:55] fact he even told his mother at the
[1:07:59] Feast of Canaan he said they they've ran
[1:08:02] out of
[1:08:04] wine and and you you know he looks at
[1:08:07] her and he says
[1:08:09] woman what's that to
[1:08:13] me you know what do what do I care they
[1:08:16] ran out of
[1:08:18] wne you know I don't you
[1:08:20] know it's it's nothing to me you
[1:08:24] wouldn't uh
[1:08:26] you you know I I don't know how that you
[1:08:30] think he might have said it but he kind
[1:08:32] of tell then he look he say it's not my
[1:08:35] time my time hasn't come yet you know
[1:08:39] what I mean but here's the mother that
[1:08:42] raised him and she says do whatever he
[1:08:45] says to
[1:08:47] do you know something was fixing to
[1:08:52] happen there was a Creator sitting in
[1:08:55] their midst and it was completely gone
[1:09:00] unnoticed and he went and filled the the
[1:09:03] they did as they said and they filled
[1:09:06] the the vases full of water and they
[1:09:10] brought water in there and then he tells
[1:09:12] them go take it to the steward and and
[1:09:15] have them draw from the
[1:09:18] water and I can just see the guys now
[1:09:22] taking this big old bucket of water this
[1:09:25] big clay thing of water over there they
[1:09:28] know it's
[1:09:30] water and they said Mary told us to
[1:09:33] bring you this water her son did you
[1:09:37] know Jesus over there you know my cousin
[1:09:40] or my my you know friend or whatever and
[1:09:44] they didn't wer expecting nothing to
[1:09:46] happen and the Stewart goes in there and
[1:09:49] he drinks it he says what's this how
[1:09:52] come they save the best wine to last
[1:09:54] I'll guarant a man has never tasted wine
[1:09:57] like
[1:10:01] that never
[1:10:03] again but we will again amen are you
[1:10:07] looking forward to that time amen and so
[1:10:12] yeah so what is
[1:10:13] transpiring there's something
[1:10:15] transpiring but it's totally
[1:10:18] hid it's it's going on but it it it's
[1:10:23] totally hid uh from all all the wise and
[1:10:29] and all the prudent and all the people
[1:10:31] that should have known the word of God
[1:10:34] and should have known what was going to
[1:10:35] take place it it's it's totally
[1:10:38] bypassing them here's a man in their
[1:10:41] midst that just turned
[1:10:44] water uh into wine and it it's
[1:10:48] absolutely going to be explained away
[1:10:51] the first thing is oh they just saved
[1:10:54] the best last because we know everybody
[1:10:58] has taken their fill this is in the
[1:11:00] scripture right normally you bring out
[1:11:02] the good wine first and then after
[1:11:05] everybody's taken their fill then you
[1:11:07] give them the bad wine because they're
[1:11:09] not going to
[1:11:11] notice now they're saying this oh they
[1:11:14] saved the good wine to last so we
[1:11:18] wouldn't drink as much and they'd have a
[1:11:24] bunch that's that's the way our minds
[1:11:27] work it's hid from the wise and The
[1:11:33] Prudent and it's revealed unto babes if
[1:11:38] it's hid and so our messenger makes this
[1:11:41] statement I thought it was pretty
[1:11:43] tremendous he says it's strange to think
[1:11:46] how that God does such a thing as that
[1:11:50] God will hide himself in something so
[1:11:53] simple that will cause the wise to miss
[1:11:57] it millions of miles and then turn right
[1:12:02] back around some simple thing in the
[1:12:06] Simplicity of his way of working and
[1:12:10] reveal him self right out
[1:12:15] again it it it it's hid it's it it's so
[1:12:19] revealed it's like let's just compare
[1:12:22] tonight to this morning
[1:12:25] everybody think wow the building's
[1:12:27] packed out you know we got 400 and some
[1:12:31] people we're packing chairs everywhere
[1:12:34] wow this is God no this is
[1:12:41] God the Simplicity of obeying the word
[1:12:45] of
[1:12:46] God man's always looking for God in
[1:12:49] great things and big numbers and big
[1:12:52] movements and some way that
[1:12:55] he can measure it in some way that he
[1:12:59] can see it but even even the Lord taught
[1:13:02] the prophet he heard the Thunder roaring
[1:13:06] and then he and the lightning flashing
[1:13:08] and he said God wasn't in that and he
[1:13:11] wasn't in the blowing but he was in that
[1:13:14] still small
[1:13:17] boid that's still still Small Voice that
[1:13:21] brought you back to the house of God to
[1:13:24] have communion
[1:13:26] I mean that's greatness to
[1:13:29] God you know you never measure a church
[1:13:33] you never you
[1:13:35] never measure a a a church by their
[1:13:40] crowd measure a church by communion
[1:13:44] service that's the best way to measure a
[1:13:48] church that's the best way to to see
[1:13:52] those that are willing to stand up it
[1:13:55] communion and take the communion test he
[1:13:58] who eateth of this cup
[1:14:01] unworthily and drinketh of eth this
[1:14:04] bread and drink of this cup unworthy
[1:14:07] drinketh
[1:14:09] damnation to
[1:14:12] themselves now now you're
[1:14:16] talking you know what I mean now you're
[1:14:18] standing up in the presence of the word
[1:14:21] of God and measuring yourself to the
[1:14:25] scriptures and examine yourself and if
[1:14:28] and the scripture tells us if if a man
[1:14:30] has so done wrong he said then then let
[1:14:34] him repent of that and then let him take
[1:14:39] communion let him make himself right in
[1:14:41] his heart and and and make the decisions
[1:14:44] and the dedication to uh uh to have a
[1:14:48] transformation in his life uh to to do
[1:14:52] better and to reach out higher and to
[1:14:55] serve God greater and and that's what
[1:14:58] communion does for you it brings you to
[1:15:00] a place it's a measuring post it's a
[1:15:02] place that you can sit and commune with
[1:15:05] him and talk it over with you and he can
[1:15:07] talk it over with
[1:15:10] you you know I always thought of that uh
[1:15:14] of
[1:15:15] that a wife that could married a boy and
[1:15:19] our messenger tells us the story and he
[1:15:22] says to uh they get married and she says
[1:15:26] to her husband I think in the story he
[1:15:29] might use the the name John he says John
[1:15:33] I know that you have a problem with
[1:15:37] drinking he said if you ever go out for
[1:15:41] some reason and stumble and fall he said
[1:15:46] you don't stay
[1:15:48] away you come right back here and we'll
[1:15:52] pray through it
[1:15:55] I love you and I'm here to battle that
[1:15:58] enemy with you that's the kind of God we
[1:16:01] serve he doesn't want us to stay away
[1:16:05] you you know what I mean and and uh it's
[1:16:09] just like the uh I don't remember the
[1:16:11] message that our uh brother Brandon
[1:16:14] brought this out in but it's always
[1:16:16] stuck with me the thing that he said it
[1:16:19] may have been Jesus with dirty feet or
[1:16:22] or or or one of those sermons he said
[1:16:24] but when that
[1:16:25] woman The Prostitute that that had uh
[1:16:31] seen Jesus at the feast and she
[1:16:35] took noticed that nobody had washed his
[1:16:38] feet and so she went and she bought some
[1:16:43] oil and and and anointing to anoint him
[1:16:49] with and to wash his feet with and the
[1:16:52] messenger said that she stood back and
[1:16:55] she watched and in her
[1:16:58] mind she thought well he'll know where I
[1:17:02] got the money to buy
[1:17:05] this and and he and and and uh what's he
[1:17:10] going to say what happens if he rejects
[1:17:14] me can you imagine the Mind
[1:17:17] battle
[1:17:20] that she went
[1:17:22] through but brother R said she finally
[1:17:25] came to the
[1:17:27] place where she knew he was the only one
[1:17:31] that could help
[1:17:34] her that's finally what drove her down
[1:17:38] there and she fell at her feet feet and
[1:17:41] begin to weep and
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:46] uh expressing sorrow for the life she
[1:17:49] lived it's not the way that she wanted
[1:17:52] to be she wanted to be free and he
[1:17:55] washed her his feet with her tears and
[1:17:59] wiped his his feet with her hair and and
[1:18:03] and he he he sat and and everybody else
[1:18:07] was
[1:18:09] missing what's going on here's God
[1:18:13] revealing his nature to Fallen man right
[1:18:19] in front of their eyes and here's such a
[1:18:23] simple woman of no regard of no respect
[1:18:29] uh of no
[1:18:32] prominence
[1:18:36] whatsoever and here's the church
[1:18:39] world all
[1:18:42] around and they're and they're pointing
[1:18:44] a finger at him and he says Simon he
[1:18:47] says nobody washed my feet nobody met me
[1:18:52] here nobody
[1:18:56] gave me any respect because they wanted
[1:18:59] to mock
[1:19:00] them and then he just speaks these great
[1:19:03] words
[1:19:05] daughter your sins which are
[1:19:08] many are all
[1:19:12] forgiven go and sin no
[1:19:18] more I
[1:19:20] mean what greater
[1:19:23] words could be SP
[1:19:26] spoken can you imagine how free she
[1:19:29] leapt and walked from that place you
[1:19:33] think she cared what anybody thought no
[1:19:36] she was different and I'll guarantee you
[1:19:39] the rest of her life was a testimony
[1:19:42] that she was
[1:19:44] different many believe that she
[1:19:46] continued to follow the lord and
[1:19:50] Minister uh to the
[1:19:53] ministry but a great thing was put on
[1:19:58] display right before their eyes and they
[1:20:01] couldn't catch it they couldn't catch
[1:20:04] the reality of
[1:20:06] it and I think that's so important the
[1:20:09] word of God is coming to pass all around
[1:20:12] us by the
[1:20:16] minute like like I say the world is
[1:20:19] falling apart there's Wars there's
[1:20:22] rumors of wars there's there's all kind
[1:20:24] of things happening and and the greatest
[1:20:29] thing that can happen for us is that we
[1:20:33] could have a revelation of the reality
[1:20:37] of what is
[1:20:39] transpiring in our generation and in the
[1:20:42] time that we're living not a long time
[1:20:45] ago not in the future but
[1:20:49] now not last week but this week today
[1:20:53] that's right what is is God showing what
[1:20:56] is he uh what is he trying to unfold
[1:20:59] what is he trying to say to the church
[1:21:02] how is his Spirit moving what what is in
[1:21:05] that
[1:21:07] Storehouse that God is uh uh speaking
[1:21:11] out to us that he wants us to to uh put
[1:21:16] the isav on of God's word that we might
[1:21:20] see that we could take the word of God
[1:21:22] and closee that our nakedness wouldn't
[1:21:26] appear that we could by gold tried and
[1:21:29] fire the the
[1:21:32] character of The
[1:21:35] Gospel that's the reality that we want
[1:21:38] to catch that's what communions about
[1:21:42] communions about catching the reality of
[1:21:45] the spirit of God and the unfolding of
[1:21:48] God's word in its present tense
[1:21:54] not
[1:21:55] theology not
[1:21:57] Doctrine not Bible teaching but the
[1:22:01] reality of the word of God coming to
[1:22:07] [Applause]
[1:22:09] pass he
[1:22:12] said and he he talks if I could go say
[1:22:15] on and he was he makes a statement about
[1:22:18] the Seven Seals it's pretty tremendous
[1:22:22] he says
[1:22:24] he says
[1:22:29] God he says now man has their own idea
[1:22:34] of what God ought to be and what God is
[1:22:38] going to do and I have have made the old
[1:22:44] statement many times that man Still
[1:22:48] Remains man man is always giving God
[1:22:52] praise for what he he did do and always
[1:22:57] looking forward to what he will do and
[1:23:01] ignoring what he is
[1:23:04] doing so you say what is it that we need
[1:23:07] to catch more than anything what's he
[1:23:10] doing what's God doing what's his intent
[1:23:14] what's his purpose what is it that he's
[1:23:17] trying to do with
[1:23:20] us excuse
[1:23:22] me what kind of maturity
[1:23:25] is he trying to bring us to what kind of
[1:23:28] greenness is he trying to bake out of us
[1:23:33] what what what's he trying to do to our
[1:23:35] minds that the mind of Christ might be
[1:23:38] in us that that we might be uh Washed by
[1:23:44] the washing of the water of the
[1:23:48] word and and and our our whole uh uh
[1:23:53] continents
[1:23:55] might uh change that we might change the
[1:24:00] atmosphere around us we we we get into
[1:24:04] that same
[1:24:05] stuper does everybody know what a stuper
[1:24:08] is right okay I don't know if everybody
[1:24:12] knows that but you know a state of
[1:24:18] stupidity I made that
[1:24:21] definition but
[1:24:25] that that things you
[1:24:27] know that we we don't we just we we just
[1:24:31] think that everything's fine and
[1:24:33] everything's going to just happen what's
[1:24:36] happening and and and there there's no
[1:24:39] part that we play and one day God's
[1:24:42] going to do what he can do no we don't
[1:24:44] want to be there so he goes on to say
[1:24:47] this he
[1:24:49] says that's the way they miss it they
[1:24:53] look back and see what great things he
[1:24:56] done but they failed to see what a
[1:24:59] simple thing he used to do it
[1:25:02] with and then they look forward and see
[1:25:06] a great thing coming that's going to
[1:25:09] happen and nine times out of 10 it's
[1:25:14] already happened right around them and
[1:25:17] it's so simple that they don't know
[1:25:23] it and and so you if if if
[1:25:28] if if the
[1:25:31] messengers has it on his heart to bring
[1:25:35] that out to us he's trying to make us
[1:25:38] aware that that's our
[1:25:42] tendency it's our tendency to
[1:25:46] myth what he's doing
[1:25:48] now and
[1:25:50] certainly that's what the isav is for
[1:25:54] amen it it's not for Doctrine by no
[1:25:57] means you know what I mean it it's it's
[1:26:01] it's
[1:26:02] for present
[1:26:04] tense Revelation and then he makes this
[1:26:08] statement I'd like to read this
[1:26:11] also because if you look at the days of
[1:26:16] Jesus what a political turmoil that
[1:26:22] was there was a great political turmoil
[1:26:27] wh why do you think Herod and the
[1:26:29] scribes and the Pharisees rose up
[1:26:32] against Jesus you think it was because
[1:26:35] of of of maybe his Doctrine they might
[1:26:39] have said it was blasphemed but they
[1:26:42] knew everything he said was
[1:26:44] true it was a power
[1:26:48] struggle they had they they were lording
[1:26:51] over God's people they they sat in the
[1:26:54] Feast of of uh uh at at prominent table
[1:26:58] they they singled themselves out above
[1:27:02] men they they claimed to be the teachers
[1:27:05] of of of the word of God they they they
[1:27:07] wanted to have the preeminence amongst
[1:27:10] the people and here comes this
[1:27:13] Carpenter guy from Nazareth no Beauty in
[1:27:17] him you know what I mean he's he he's
[1:27:20] got the burden of the world upon him
[1:27:24] and and and yet everywhere he goes
[1:27:28] demons are being cast out and people are
[1:27:31] being delivered and the lame is walking
[1:27:34] they've never seen nothing about it they
[1:27:36] they they don't have that power and you
[1:27:39] know what they're enraged dri or enraged
[1:27:41] with nothing but pure
[1:27:45] jealousy they got to put an end to this
[1:27:48] guy else they're going to
[1:27:51] lose their position
[1:27:55] because the buzz of the people was not
[1:27:59] praise God the messiah's
[1:28:01] here no they believed that there was one
[1:28:04] there that was going to deliver them
[1:28:07] from the Romans and restore back the
[1:28:10] glory of
[1:28:12] Israel and we find that on the road to
[1:28:15] EMAs they said oh what are you such a a
[1:28:18] stranger in these parts not to recognize
[1:28:22] what's happened
[1:28:25] and he's looking at them and saying you
[1:28:31] fools what what happened to you isn't it
[1:28:38] written in the
[1:28:40] scriptures that the Messiah should come
[1:28:43] he should be
[1:28:44] despised and and he he took him through
[1:28:47] the
[1:28:49] scriptures and laid out to them the
[1:28:53] reality of what was really taking place
[1:28:58] and here man was looking down the road
[1:29:00] and looking back and we thought this was
[1:29:03] this and we thought this was going to
[1:29:05] happen and what did they do they missed
[1:29:08] God sitting right in their
[1:29:10] mid they missed that their stripes that
[1:29:15] the chastisement of their peace was upon
[1:29:17] them they missed that he bore their
[1:29:20] iniquity he missed that they took their
[1:29:22] shame
[1:29:24] everything that he was doing at that
[1:29:27] time the Deliverance of man from Death
[1:29:31] the deliverance from sin the paying of
[1:29:34] their price the washing of their souls
[1:29:37] the absolutely the taking the curse of
[1:29:41] death off of them they totally missed
[1:29:47] it could you
[1:29:49] imagine how many's looking for a
[1:29:51] resurrection and a rapture
[1:29:54] how many has got an idea in your mind
[1:29:58] how it's going to
[1:30:00] happen well you might as well count on
[1:30:03] one thing is probably
[1:30:11] wrong if you want to catch the Rapture
[1:30:14] you've got to catch what he's doing
[1:30:19] today you got to ask God to be unveiled
[1:30:23] not not in this building not in this
[1:30:26] ministry but what God's doing in his
[1:30:29] word you've got to find him in the
[1:30:32] assembly you got to find them in the
[1:30:34] gospel you got to find them in your
[1:30:37] brothers and sisters you you've got to
[1:30:39] know him and I say it over again in his
[1:30:42] present tense
[1:30:46] reality that's what you need I have I
[1:30:49] have that you might
[1:30:51] see see him
[1:30:54] open it up to me Lord let me let me come
[1:30:57] in
[1:30:57] contact I I don't want to be
[1:31:01] led like the blind leads the
[1:31:04] Blind and through all that great
[1:31:07] political turmoil that was going on here
[1:31:12] he
[1:31:13] was freeing
[1:31:16] man ending the
[1:31:19] grave for his children and for all his
[1:31:23] kin
[1:31:25] all those that were kin to him from
[1:31:29] before and in the presence there he was
[1:31:32] the great kinsman
[1:31:35] redeemer standing there in the form of
[1:31:39] sin appearing to be shaped in
[1:31:46] iniquity no
[1:31:48] Beauty no
[1:31:50] nothing but yet the chosen
[1:31:54] Lamb of
[1:31:56] God every man everybody else would have
[1:31:59] chose a
[1:32:00] general they would have chose something
[1:32:03] big something that appeared to be
[1:32:08] happening somebody that
[1:32:10] had uh some sort of
[1:32:15] command over the English language but
[1:32:19] yet God chose it not to be that way
[1:32:25] Paul even had to say I didn't come to
[1:32:27] you with great enticing
[1:32:30] speech you know I didn't come to you in
[1:32:32] the wisdom of men with Excellence of
[1:32:36] speech and and great big sermons he said
[1:32:40] I came to you in the power and the
[1:32:43] demonstration of the
[1:32:46] Resurrection I came to you to that you
[1:32:49] might recognize that he's real and he's
[1:32:54] alive I've came not to build something
[1:32:57] I've came to put you into contact with
[1:33:00] him
[1:33:01] personally that you might know him the
[1:33:04] scripture says in the power of his
[1:33:07] resurrection that that's the knowledge
[1:33:10] that you might know him not know about
[1:33:12] him not know what he did not know what
[1:33:16] he's going to do but you might know him
[1:33:19] in his present tense
[1:33:21] power that he has the power now and is
[1:33:26] present now to change
[1:33:29] things I'm going to close with this
[1:33:32] statement before
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:35] communion and it's a striking statement
[1:33:39] now remember God hides
[1:33:41] himself in simple
[1:33:45] things you you might never know why God
[1:33:47] ever chooses somebody but the choosing
[1:33:50] is
[1:33:52] his you know there will be people that
[1:33:54] are more
[1:33:55] qualified uh more knowledgeable they
[1:33:59] have everything about them they seem
[1:34:01] like they have all the uh qualities and
[1:34:06] education and
[1:34:09] abilities and God never chooses that
[1:34:13] guy man chose
[1:34:15] Saul God chose
[1:34:18] David David was a
[1:34:21] Shepherd as we heard this morning God
[1:34:24] told
[1:34:25] him I raised you up you were a Shepherd
[1:34:28] I made you King who did that God did
[1:34:33] that that's the kind of
[1:34:36] God that we
[1:34:38] serve and he says this in in closing
[1:34:42] this is I don't have paragraphs here
[1:34:44] brothers and I'm sorry for
[1:34:47] that he
[1:34:49] says a man was made to rely
[1:34:55] completely upon
[1:34:59] God now I want you to see how simple
[1:35:02] this
[1:35:04] is but yet how hard it is to grab a hold
[1:35:10] of man was made to rely completely upon
[1:35:15] God that's the reason we're likened unto
[1:35:20] Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead
[1:35:24] himself he has got to have a leader and
[1:35:28] the Holy Spirit is supposed to lead us
[1:35:32] so man is made that way and God made all
[1:35:36] of his works so
[1:35:39] simple that the simple could understand
[1:35:43] it and God makes himself so simple with
[1:35:47] the simple in order to be
[1:35:51] understood by
[1:35:54] the
[1:35:58] simple let's be
[1:36:02] simpletons in your life let's see how
[1:36:05] simple can you make
[1:36:08] things you know there just might be a
[1:36:11] reason behind everything that's
[1:36:13] happening to
[1:36:17] you if we'd stop a
[1:36:20] moment and not be presumptuous
[1:36:24] in any way but just stop and say
[1:36:28] Lord give me eyes set where are
[1:36:33] you maybe it's it's okay that this
[1:36:37] happened or that
[1:36:40] happened I'm in your
[1:36:43] hands nothing can pluck me out of your
[1:36:47] hands what what what happens if the
[1:36:49] world comes to the end I go to heaven
[1:36:53] you say oh brother mcar you're making it
[1:36:56] so
[1:36:57] simple I can't make it simple
[1:37:00] enough salvation's a gift of God L any
[1:37:04] man should boast we didn't even earn
[1:37:08] it well we were yet a sinner he died for
[1:37:11] us he didn't wait for us to clean up he
[1:37:13] cleaned us up he cleaned us up before we
[1:37:17] got cleaned
[1:37:20] up he threw it in the sea of God's
[1:37:23] forgetfulness to be remembered no more
[1:37:27] amen I mean I'm the worst of getting
[1:37:30] frustrated at this
[1:37:34] world and it it's maybe it's Pride maybe
[1:37:38] it's ego you you you know what I mean
[1:37:40] sometimes you get to the place you think
[1:37:42] how could this world run with so many
[1:37:45] incompetent
[1:37:50] people you know you you get waited on
[1:37:53] and and you just you don't get it you
[1:37:58] think what going on in your
[1:38:02] mind you
[1:38:04] know could I have
[1:38:07] a water with no
[1:38:10] ice so I get a glass of ice with no
[1:38:15] water I
[1:38:19] think did I say that
[1:38:26] you know but why not just stop and say
[1:38:28] you know something there's a reason I
[1:38:30] got this glass with
[1:38:33] ice maybe somebody needs that
[1:38:39] glass that's
[1:38:42] simple but the simpler you make your
[1:38:45] life the more un complicated you get it
[1:38:50] the problems that you make so big really
[1:38:53] aren't very big at
[1:38:58] all you say I don't know what I'm going
[1:39:00] to do I can't pay my rent well you know
[1:39:04] what big
[1:39:08] deal God said he won't see the righteous
[1:39:11] beg
[1:39:13] bread you think well how how would you
[1:39:15] approach that then well I might look
[1:39:18] like if I'm not paying my bills and I'm
[1:39:20] not uh you know making my things right
[1:39:25] maybe I'm lacking
[1:39:31] righteousness always bring it
[1:39:35] home always make it
[1:39:37] simple because that's where God is he
[1:39:41] speaks in simple things he the our
[1:39:44] problems are
[1:39:46] simple they're Satan's making this big
[1:39:50] outrageous thing you know how simple is
[1:39:53] we're made to rely on him if we rely on
[1:39:57] him and he made us that way don't you
[1:40:00] think that he made us that way so he
[1:40:02] could take care of
[1:40:05] us that's pretty
[1:40:08] simple he can do it and you say well
[1:40:12] what happens if I lose my life wait a
[1:40:14] minute if I lose my life I go to
[1:40:19] heaven that's pretty
[1:40:21] good Paul finally said
[1:40:23] death or Peter I forget which one right
[1:40:25] now in my mind but he said
[1:40:29] death where's your string grave where's
[1:40:33] your
[1:40:34] Victory I've ran a good race I fought a
[1:40:36] good fight I I go to receive the crown
[1:40:39] that's laid up for me you the the
[1:40:42] simpler you keep it the simpler it is
[1:40:46] the the more you bring it back home the
[1:40:49] more you'll find out God's a lot more
[1:40:51] around us than we really
[1:40:54] you say how is that true because he said
[1:40:56] he would be he said wherever two or
[1:40:58] three gather together I'll be there in
[1:41:00] his midst wouldn't that be fabulous if
[1:41:03] you could look around this evening and
[1:41:04] see him standing in our midst but he'd
[1:41:07] be so
[1:41:11] simple we'd be so
[1:41:14] simple I was moved this morning when
[1:41:18] when
[1:41:20] Enrique came up for prayer
[1:41:25] and he knows that God dealt with him to
[1:41:29] get baptized and he put it
[1:41:31] off and then he came up to the front and
[1:41:34] he says I want to thank
[1:41:38] God for sparing my
[1:41:41] life and giving me a
[1:41:43] chance to serve
[1:41:46] him I'd like him to heal me so I can get
[1:41:51] baptized
[1:41:56] simple but that was
[1:42:00] God that was God moving right in our
[1:42:03] midst and it goes completely
[1:42:06] unnoticed how many times when somebody
[1:42:08] comes up for prayer it's just another
[1:42:11] person coming up for prayer your
[1:42:14] antennas ought to go up your spiritual
[1:42:17] antennas your eyes ought to get filled
[1:42:20] with IAB and you start looking for the
[1:42:24] spirit of God
[1:42:25] moving God's here be tender to the
[1:42:29] presence of the
[1:42:31] Lord somebody's come for
[1:42:34] prayer the word of God says in no wise
[1:42:37] will he cast them out the word of God
[1:42:39] says ask the Elders of the church to
[1:42:41] pray for you anoint you with oil and you
[1:42:44] shall be
[1:42:47] healed so many things have got so common
[1:42:50] to us
[1:42:53] that we've fallen into that trap one day
[1:42:56] we're going to go to
[1:42:57] heaven that's not what we're
[1:43:00] promised you say oh yeah we are no we're
[1:43:03] promised to sit in Heavenly places with
[1:43:06] Christ Jesus
[1:43:09] now could you imagine let me put it this
[1:43:11] way to you just to share a little light
[1:43:14] around you maybe to stimulate our
[1:43:17] thinking if you're sitting in the
[1:43:19] presence of Jesus
[1:43:21] now right
[1:43:23] you're you're sitting in high places in
[1:43:25] Christ Jesus right if the same spirit's
[1:43:28] in him wouldn't it be amazing if you
[1:43:32] stayed where you
[1:43:33] are and the world fell away from
[1:43:40] you we always think oh we're going to
[1:43:43] out of this world how about if all the
[1:43:46] world around you just
[1:43:49] dissipated and there you
[1:43:51] were sitting in his presence with none
[1:43:55] of else of this
[1:43:58] around oh that seems like heaven to
[1:44:04] me it's a Time
[1:44:09] Church to
[1:44:11] wash our
[1:44:13] minds the renewing of our minds by the
[1:44:17] washing of the water of the
[1:44:21] word and examine and how we're
[1:44:25] thinking what's attracting us what's
[1:44:29] important to us and I tell you if you do
[1:44:32] those things you'll find out this life
[1:44:36] is not as difficult as the devil tries
[1:44:41] to make it out to

[1:44:47] roaring lion amen do you believe that

[1:46:21] your sake it says those for I have
[1:46:23] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:46:26] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
