be believe for from The Impossible we'll see a miracle God we believe God we believe for man as they continue to play maybe you just start meditating on what he said we we sing the song you said it well what did he say maybe maybe something he said's real personal to you maybe when he found you that day that you were in need and something became a reality and there's an anchor there and there was something that was spoken to your heart and you know that heavens and earth will pass away but but that'll never pass away you might have gone through some trials and you've gone through some heartaches and you might have fallen down and but he's picked you back up and and maybe we just want to say Lord you said it I'm going to I'm going to sing this song Lord I don't want it to just be a song but I want it to be a reality I want it to be a revelation Lord and and there's many things you said father right now I just want to start asking I want I want a greater revelation of it Lord I want to be able to believe it I I want to see the manifestation in I want to go forward I I I want to see the word that you've spoken be a reality not just in my life I want to see it a reality in your life and my brother's life because there's going to come a time I need you I I might get into a valley and and I'm going to need my brothers and sisters to gather around and say brother I'm reaching out for you tonight you said I believe just think about it now I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you by my stripes you are healed I'll be with you even in you until the [Music] end I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you if I go and prepare a place for you I will come and receive you unto myself that where I [Music] am God we believe God We Believe for from The Impossible we see a miracle God we believe God we believe for Lord Jesus we just come to you now Lord we believe father because you plac something in us to believe with for that Lord we want to say thank you Lord thank you for that seed that you placed inside of us that would even be able to believe you and to be able to take you at your word Lord and that's why we've gathered here tonight Lord is that we believe you we believe your word Lord and it's it's not something that we did it's because you loved us Lord and we love you because you first loved us Lord when we were unlovable you sought fit to die for us while we were yet a sinner Lord you made a way for us before we even knew we needed a way made and that's why we've come here Lord that we might be able to tell you that we love you and sing a few songs and and thank you for what you've done for us now Lord we come to this portion of the service where we would look to you to come Lord and take your word and start to minister to the hearts and the conditions and the places in people's lives where they're living where the word just goes far beyond some type of theology or some type of religion but it starts to discern the thoughts and the intents of the Heart Lord and we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever we believe that you are present here right now your word says the angel of the Lord in camps around them that fear you Lord then by faith we know that you're standing here in our midst also in our midst Lord our needs in the body there's some people that are riddled with complexes and fear there's some people that are wondering what their mistakes and failures are going to make them become but Lord that's when you come in and you start to whisper Your Love secrets to your bride and start to let us know that everything's going to be all right that you already knew all these things and that you made a way for us out and that if we'll just trust you Lord I want to trust you tonight Lord I was just thinking in my heart as the heavens opened up and the rain started to pour out I thought oh God why not in the Supernatural tonight Lord that the windows of Heaven would open up and there'd be such a a move moving of your Holy Spirit into people's hearts and their lives they'd be so changed Lord not just a a temporary change Lord but an eternal change where your word becomes a reality to them Father Lord that's the God we serve so we look to you now Lord you know in ourselves we've just tried to for a moment look into your word and find something Lord that'd be a blessing to your people but if it ain't for your grace and your mercy and your Holy Ghost to come and take the word and break it to the people Lord then we've come in vain so we surrender to you asking all these things in your lovely name the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles my just such a wonderful atmosphere here in the house of God Amen I was just thinking you know if uh if we were in some great sporting event or some concert you know when it was your favorite artist or your favorite team playing those seats wouldn't be empty I mean I was just kind of thinking if brother Brandon was here those seats probably wouldn't be empty you know and that's cuz sometimes we just get caught in a routine you know we kind of get stuck in a routine but they're still open you know I would imagine if I was at a Ranger game or something like that and I saw them seats up there they were empty and I was in the nose bleeds I'd prob start you know Brother David that first second third fourth inning sixth inning say nobody's been up there well there we go Hallelujah we got one coming up hey you know brother brandham said sometimes we got to get out of order long enough to get saved we just get in such a routine where we got our seat in our place we got our job well why don't we just have church tonight we got plenty of Elbow Room tonight I mean we we even got room to run Hallelujah well why not Church you know me I'm just a little backwards so I I I just get too moved by what God did for me because I know how crazy I was out there in the world I was a nut and if you think I was a nut my brother was even even a bigger nut but but but but that's what sons and daughters are of God are we're extremist we we we if we're going to give ourselves to something we're going to give it all to it and it's pretty much that it was that way out in the world well if we're going to serve god let's just serve God with all of our heart you know I'm I'm you know brother random says don't don't jump any higher than you live well well why ain't you jumping is that how low you're living all right well we'll get somewhere Romans 4 chapter 17 I guess you got to pass today David I was looking for your wife but oh okay all right he's he's leading by example we're stretched way back there I can hardly see some of you I'm sorry that's just a pet peeve of mine I guess you know somebody's going to move up closer though I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to watch it happen it maybe we'll start preaching may maybe the fire of God will get to moveing so big and so bright people just forget where they are they'll find themselves at altars you know one time there's a picture of a brother Brandon was sitting on top of the pulpit I mean hey it happens right so all right let's just see what the Lord does tonight I've kind of hopefully broken you out of your routine and we all feel feel all awkward and funny now so let's get moving Romans chapter 4 verse 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving Glory unto God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform you may may have your seats I want to speak uh this evening by the help of God if I if the Lord would just Quicken this this uh uh little thought to us and uh we certainly need his help and his grace to come and and magnify and and illuminate but I want to speak on an aspect of faith if I could say an action of Faith or something that Faith does and you know we've we've heard the the phrases of um well praise the Lord we've heard the phrases of you know uh uh perfect faith and common faith and we've we've heard phrases of uh of of um rapturing Faith right we've heard all these kind of things have we not but I want to say that there there's there's there's faith has to become a reality right faith has to be become something that is real to you faith has to become something that when it's revealed to you no matter what the the the circumstances are no matter what happens no matter what comes your way that faith is such a revelation that when all of the symptoms and everything shows up there's an anchor that is in your soul that regardless of what you're looking at that heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away is that right come on there has to there has to be a reality there has to be something that is in your soul something that is so anchored that when the Devil comes and he tries to buff at you when the Devil comes and he tries to start uh uh telling you you're not who you are there's something in you that is anchored there's something in you that is anchored that regardless of what the devil would try to say regardless of what the devil would try to do there's something that's more real to you than the five senses amen I've never had this happen so I could just preach without notes I've I've done it many times but let me see if I can get this straightened out but we're we're we're reading out of Romans chapter 4 and we're just speaking on the aspect of faith in our text Abraham called those things were which were not as though they were right so so maybe it maybe just think about a promise or something in your life that that maybe that you're believing for and it seems like you haven't received it come on maybe maybe you feel like you haven't received the promise of God and and and it's something you're believing for and it doesn't seem like it's in your possession but I want to say if you have faith and you believe that God has given you the promise then by faith you do possess the promise and then what you do is you start calling those things which are not right you start calling those things which are not as though they were so then you start speaking it right Abraham was strong in faith given Glory unto God so what was he doing he was speaking the word are you with me amen so Something That Came Upon My Heart Is as we just think about all these uh all these uh you know Common faith and perfect faith and rapturing faith and all these things I I want to just uh bring out maybe another way of saying it uh uh and speak to you of a conquering Faith a conquering Faith now I'm getting I'm getting excited because the devil's fighting and he he didn't just start fighting this evening he started fighting earlier today and and I've learned one thing when the devil starts fighting you just might as well start getting excited you know when when you when you got Wednesday night church a a and man you're finally ready and it's early I'm finally going to get to church early and and the baby dumps out a whole bowl of spaghetti on your your dress shirt and you're like you got to be kidding me that's when you might as well say hey you know what something good is going to happen something good is in store if if things are happening like this and I I'm starting to get upset that maybe maybe the devil's just trying to cause some problems so I want to talk to you as a subject conquering Faith but but if I can maybe just gather myself for a moment Abraham called those things my title this evening is When Faith speaks When Faith speaks and I just was I I I had I had opened up perfect faith and I was reading this quote here and uh brother brandom would say in perfect Faith paragraph 146 he says you're a Christian you have a right to any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for you it's all yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it not imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can possess it oh that's conquering Faith now I was just I and this is just you know God deals with ministers Hearts different ways and and sometimes maybe a specific way more often than others and as I was just pondering that conquering faith I just felt the Lord speak to my heart and say faith that speaks or the voice of faith faith has a voice Faith speaks and that's what we want to talk about in minister to you on tonight is When Faith speaks and as a subject conquering faith and so just continuing on in this quote brother brand says he knew it would happen before he could predict that it would happen because he knowed it would happen and whatever he predicted come to pass now watch whatever he said God honored what he said think of that whatever Jesus said God brought it to pass so he knowed his words were God's words that's what you got to know is what you're speaking is God's words not just speaking what you think you want but you got to be speaking the word of God by a revelation now look that same scripture comes right back into us if you say to this mountain now I I just want to distinguish something really quick because it says if you say to this mountain and and and that's what I love this thought of where our pastor's taking us to the path forward look we're moving forward if you say to this mountain not the guy in the mirror not that guy you wake up in the morning and you're looking at the mirror and you're going if you say that guy in the mirror let you down but not the you in the mirror the you in the word there's a difference there's a difference between the youu in the mirror or the youu in the word so the guy in the mirror is your worst enemy if you haven't figured that out yet you will when you start fighting against it and wanting to do things for the Lord you'll find out you got to bring that thing under subjection you got to let it know something if you say to the mountain and so just a moving on brother Brandon would say and why Christ speak he says uh in paragraph 176 he says Moses with his faith never did fear Pharaoh see he didn't care what Pharaoh said he cared not about Pharaoh no no more than his mother and his daddy cared about their threats when Moses was confirmed to him and he was that person that was to deliver Egypt or lead Israel out of Egypt he never cared what Pharaoh said he wasn't scared of him now would say if there was anybody to be scared of it would have probably been Pharaoh class participation I mean he was the most mightiest man in the world by by the natural Senses at the time he said there's no fear in faith faith knows about it Faith as I've always said it gots great big muscles and hairs on its chest Faith said shut up and everybody and everybody shuts up that's all I know where I I'm talking about faith speaking I think it's time for us to allow the faith in us to start speaking start speaking the word faith said shut up and everything shuts up that's all I know where I'm at the rest of them say well then maybe he does see but you've got to stand up and show your muscles that's all Faith does it so faith has a voice Faith speaks Faith stands up and flexes its muscles come on faith speaks out Faith flexes its muscles or faith shows its muscles that's what Abraham was doing Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving Glory unto God what was he doing he was standing up in the face of the critics he was standing up in the face of the doctors he was standing up in the face of all the theologians and everybody that told him look there's no way that you can do it but what was Abraham Abraham was persuaded do you know what it means to be persuaded Abraham was persuaded that the one that gave him the promise some of us just need to get persuaded some of us just need to get convinced then you get concerned some of us you you're persuaded that if you show up to work on time you're going to get a check on Friday you're persuaded of it but I tell you what you're putting your faith in the wrong thing cuz that company could go belly up look look out in La people had a job and overnight the fire come through and burnt everything to the ground I I'm sure their Persuasions gone but if you're persuaded by faith heavens and earth will pass away but there's one thing that won't pass away and that is the word of God I say it's time we be persuaded by the word of God he was persuaded what God would God would perform what he promised and I like how he says that that that he didn't fear Pharaoh he didn't fear what Pharaoh could do to Moses he wasn't fearing that thing because he knew that God had called him right to lead the children out of Egypt he said you'll come back to this mountain and worship me therefore there was nothing that pharo could do to stop the word of God now remember we want to put ourselves in the story you said it I believe it well by God's grace we'll get down to the word and what he has spoken concerning you brother Brandon would talk about Peter and he would talk about Peter how how you know they were out on the boat and it looked like some spooky figure came came out there on the water and they started to wonder my goodness what what is this and all of a sudden Peter's like Lord if that be you bid me come a prophet of God said Peter was doing all right until he got scared Peter was doing all right before he got scared he said Lord if that be you bid me come I don't know what's if you can turn this screen on right here because it's a lot of stuff going on the back here um he said Peter was doing all right until he got scared but Lord if that be you bid me come he said come on God you told me to come on your word says for me to walk then I'm going to start walking you think about that until that time I from all I know that was you know there was a man walking on the water and his name was Jesus and second later by faith Peter stepped out of the boat there was two men walking on water a man that didn't even have the Holy Ghost think of it now but enough Faith because he always was a Son of God he always was predestinated there was always the power of transformation in him there was always something there he believed God he took him at his word he stepped out on the boat and he started walking but when he got to looking at the symptoms now I I want to uh uh remind us we're talking about going forward we're we're talking about moving beyond the conditions and maybe moving into a higher height and into a greater realm than where we have been living where we come to a place that by faith we accept what God has done for us we believe what God has made us we believe that he has a purpose and a plan for our life we know that we're called we know that we're Justified there is therefore now no condemnation come on if there's condemnation in your life then you're you're you're missing something because there's a place that you can come to where you meet the Lord and all the condemnation is gone that your past is turned into a testimony you're just like the woman at the well now those things that once enslaved you now those things that once had you in bondage now those things that used to torment you become the tools that you can use to witness of his grace and His glory oh Hallelujah I like that so we we're having a revelation of who we are no more condemnation we know that we're anointed for the job why Christ speak the word yes but I point this out what the prophet of God said in perfect Faith speaking of Peter he said what he feared happened if you're afraid of losing your job watch out we had a brother that preached here a long time ago and he was so scared a deer was going to jump out in front of his car he got anxiety over you know what happened a deer jumped out in front of his car Satan will try to put something in your life and cause you to fear fear and the prophet of God is saying but I want to say just as easy it is to fear look at this he said what he feared happened what he believed happened when he believed he could walk he walked when he believe when he when he believed and got scared in his belief then his substance left him see he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance I say isn't that the picture of many of the Believers today one day you're walking on the water Hallelujah bless God I'm going in the rapture we had a wonderful service we had a some wonderful meetings praise God I'm victorious in the next minute Lord I'm drowning I'm going down I can't stay above water Lord help me come on it ain't ought to be that way what one minute you're up the next minute you're down that's that's okay that it's quiet cuz many of us are in that condition and you shouldn't be and if that's where you're starting off I want to tell you there's higher Heights you ain't got to stay like that if you're up and down at least you're up and down at least you're calling out to the Lord and the Lord's there to save you the Lord's there to help you that's all right if you're going down say Lord help me the Lord wants to pull you up but he don't want to pull you up so you go back down if you go back down he'll pull you back up but I want to tell you that there's been a word that has been opened up to the bride of Christ in the end time that he'll pull you up out of the mck and mire and he'll set you upon the rock of Revelation that you can never go down again Hallelujah you're called to be victorious one day Sanctified the next day you're struggling one day you're wearing your dress long and the next week you're rolling it back up again one one one year you're growing your hair long and then and then you cut it off and you got to grow it again that's all right you're struggling you're up and down you're up and down but there is a revelation and the Lord is here wanting to pull you into higher Heights we're going on faith knows no defeat feet isn't an option yes sir Moses didn't fear Pharaoh when David met Goliath fear and doubt what did what did Goliath tell David he said you're just but a youth see the symptoms and the opposition tells you well you're just a young person or you haven't been serving the lord that long or or or you're not a real Warrior you know uh you you you don't have any schooling or education or what real battles have you gone through you you've just grown up in the church on the Pew and and your parents have applied the token you've never really overcome anything now that's what the devil's saying that that's maybe what the doubt in the unbelief is saying but I want to say there's another voice there's a voice of the word I want to tell you that speaks back that's right Faith told Goliath said look when I was out there tending my father's sheep there was a lion that came and I slew that lion well there was a bear that came and I slew the bear and I want to tell you oh Goliath you're going to be just the same as them for the god that justified me the god that Sanctified me the god that filled me with the Holy Ghost is the same God that's going to take your head off Goliath Goliath you're going down what was it that was Faith speaking back so why are we being quiet Church why cist speak Faith spoke back I was thinking about that brother brandom he tells uh a story about a brother came to him and told him about a dream he said brother gram I had this dream and and in this dream that the the devil came to me you know almost like a ghost the Spirit came to me the devil was there and the devil kept going up to me and saying boo and I jumped back and you say boo and he jumped back again and he said every time the devil said boo and I jumped back he got bigger and bigger and bigger and he realized I'm going going to have to face this thing come on maybe something's been telling you boo boo it's been coming after you maybe you feel like you get the victory for a season maybe you feel like you get the victory for a month but that thing comes back and says boo I'm back and you jump back and you oh what am I going to do what am I going to do and the Temptation starts to grow and you feel like you can't turn your head anymore and you you're you're starting to you feel that thing coming over and all a sudden before you know you're giving in but what did he say he said I realized I had to face that thing eventually so I looked around he said and the only thing I knew I took my Bible and when that spirit said boo he said boo back and when he took the word and said boo he noticed that it got smaller and so he took the word of God and said boo and it got smaller and he kept taking the word of God and said boo devil prophet of God said that's what you need to do he said you don't need to tell the devil boo he said but take the word of God and say thus saith the Lord boo devil and that thing that's been tormenting you that thing that's giving you problems I want to tell you when the voice of Faith Rises up according to the word of God go ahead and speak the word boo devil back up I'm a Son of God I come to do battle on a Wednesday night yeah on a Wednesday night you mean when half of the church is gone yeah when half of the church is gone you mean when the pews look kind of yeah that's when God shows up boo devil When Faith speaks now I'm not talking about a hope so I'm talking about knowing that God promised it and that settles it that's what you have to do Church take the word it's thus saith the Lord one time there was a sister in the scriptures she had a blood issue I believe for over 25 years she had spent everything she had done all she could do insurance dried up no more money no more resources the doctors and everybody said that's just going to be the way it is and you just might as well die in that condition everything was pointing to a hopeless case but from somewhere something rose up inside of her and said it was a voice something spoke in our heart if I can just touch the hym of his garments I want to tell you though when Faith speaks it don't stand still Hallelujah When Faith speaks it don't stand still it puts you into action and something in her heart said well I've tried all the doctors I've tried everything out but there's something in my heart that's saying if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment oh he she started pressing her way she moved from the back of the church up into the front of the church because she was tired of being a lukewarm believer she said oh my I spent all my living but if this God be God if I can just touch the hym of his garden I will be healed Faith went into action I say that's where we're moving moving into church is faith that gots hair on its chest faith that has action behind what it believes and what it says who touched me Lord what do you mean this is a different touch oh I wish we could see into the supernatural realm right now the Lord is passing through this building oh come on brother Matthew you're being a fanatic he's here right now that's another scene just like in the scriptures he's walking through and I wonder if he'll stop this evening and say who touched me look over and somebody's going to say it was me have a need Lord faith faith is rising up Faith is speaking out tonight I'm claiming something matter of fact it's not the me and the mirror it's the me and the word if you say to the mountain this was not just a man speaking this is deity speaking because the word is in me anointed by the Holy Ghost and that is deity talking who touched me thy faith has made thee whole Faith rose up and said if I can Touch the Hem of His Garment see when Faith speaks it don't sit around Faith goes into action I would just want to clear something up maybe help somebody if something in your heart says I'll go up for prayer and be healed now not just a wondering not a hoping so but with a perfect Faith according to the word now a lot of people if you're not careful you stop at paragraph 42 in perfect faith when brother brandom says look if you have if you have faith why you standing in the prayer line and all of a sudden you start to feel like well well well what am I going to do but why don't you just go all the way to the end of paragraph 179 and brother brandom says now if you have if you feel like you got perfect Faith come into the prayer line but if you don't feel like you got perfect Faith don't come in the prayer line because you're just taking somebody else's time and you sit back and say I'm confused brother brand no no there there's no confusion here because remember we we have the phrase common Faith it's rapturing Faith perfect Faith conquering Faith what faith comes by hearing the word and faith is a revelation a revelation of what a revelation of the word so then faith if faith is speaking in your heart according to the word you know what I'm going to go get uh prayed for uh call for the elders and they're going to lay hands on me and I will be healed then that's Faith speaking if you're sitting right there and and in your are you inspired you say you know what by his stripes I'm already healed I don't need to go through the prayer line then that is Faith speaking one doesn't take away from the other it's all a revelation of the word it's all the word speaking back you can be a a mature son or daughter of God my and and and and and you're living real close to God and God just put it on your heart why didn't you go up and be prayed for that need to be healed and then you're like well I don't Lord I don't need to you said by your stripes I'm Healed but maybe he wants to manifest that portion of word in your life maybe it's not for you at all maybe it's for somebody else to say you know what if God can do that for brother brother Matthew he can do it for me the important thing is that you're being obedient to the word of God you're being faithful to what the word says Do Lord you said Lord you said if you've met God's requirements come on some of you believing for the Holy Ghost you've turned over every Rock every stick you've done all you know to do well then I say stand if you you repented of your sins and you're living a Sanctified life the best way that you know how and you're believing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you say Lord I've gone to the water I I I I've repented of my sins I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you said Lord if you've met God's requirement there's no need to fear there's no condemnation if you've prayed and God seems silent Faith doesn't waver Faith just stands brother Bron said faith thinks positive thoughts one year goes by three years go by five years go by 20 years go by Abraham we're going to have a baby positive thought think positive thought that ain't psychology that's not theology that's the voice of faith in in The Believer speaking out Faith anchors in the rock of of Ages brother Rand said Faith gots hair on its chest when it speaks everything else shuts up everything stops cuz he's the boss well you got faith am I in the wrong place tonight do you have faith go ahead why don't you exercise it why don't you go ahead and exercise your faith muscles you got to start somewhere you know all them big old uh muscle and bodybuilders they didn't roll

I'm flexing my muscles come on somebody just needs to start flexing right that's the proph said he was showing his muscles the reason is out in the world you want to know why some people ain't flexing

word says what do you have to fear oh Hallelujah first John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God over the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now we me some of the brothers had some fellowship on this so we'll just move through it a little bit and see uh where it'll go but brother random says and faith is our Victory he says if you need any any need whatsoever that God has promised in the Bible he's here tonight to meet that need no need seeking further his presence is here his spirit is here and he's willing and ready and longing to give to you that what you are seeking for why would you wait any longer when you come to him don't come as a floater brother Brandon would tell the story about this this guy he was he was at the house and some guy come by and and knocked on his door and said hey can I can I get can you can I get a sandwich and brother brand thought well all right why why you go come on in and brother brand thought well I I'll do more for him in a sandwich I'll just try to find something here in the house and and fix it up for him and he he fixed him up something to eat and he said so where where are you going he said oh nowhere oh okay where where are you coming from nowhere oh okay I see he just kind of how how long's it been this way oh about 20 years he said oh just wherever I hang my hat I guess brother brandom got to thinking about that you know he had no purpose in his life you can't come to God with no purpose he said oh but when you strike Heaven it'll give you purpose purpose to pray purpose to go to church he said but here this guy said he got he got me to think and he said he was just kind of like old Driftwood just floating along just just Driftwood just get caught up in the trash pile and get caught up in the weeds you know and and it would just be get all tangled up and become a mess he said but you know there's something interesting about Driftwood it could be all piled up there in a heap of trash but then there all a sudden come a a big boat just cruising by he said is it something that the Driftwood and the boats made out of the same material but one has been taken into the Master's hands one has been taken into the Master's hands is is it being molded and being shaped that it can be used are are are you ready to get into his hands some of us need to wake up maybe we should do reps do do jumping jacks we'll do laps around the church get some spiritual reps in does anybody here have a need why why don't we start believing God to meet that need amen take that need like this little piece of Driftwood and let it be into the hands of the master he'll take it he'll shape it he'll form it it'll be like bits in the horse's mouth he's just what is he doing he's just accomplishing his perfect will in your life oh when you when you have a faith like that say God you promised you said so I know you're working out everything for all let Faith start speaking back lord you said all things work together for the good for them that love God and are called according to your purpose that means Good's coming I don't care how bad it looks Good's coming why it's thus sayith the Lord boo devil Goods coming Goods around the corner don't come like a Drifter don't come like a floater why don't you just allow God uh to take you into his hands and to mold you and to shape you don't come as a floater I'll go up and try and see if it works you'll never get nowhere but when you come with this kind of determination that you've sold out Lock Stock and Barrel when you're tired of the world and sin there it is some of you just ain't tired yet you kind of like the worldly music you kind of like the the the pool of the world you kind of like looking fashionable you kind of like the Fashions and the way the people do things and so you're doing it and and you're sounding like it and you're looking kind of like a little you ain't tired of it but when you get tired of it and you're sold out lock talking Barrel you get tired of this world and sin and unbelief and frustrations and doubt and come to the Living God with an anchor surely Titan in the rock of Angel and the Holy Spirit is is here to pull you into the presence of a living God that will give you a faith that'll overcome anything there is in the world sickness disease and even death itself oh how I'm talking about a church that has Faith you say you said death brother brandom yeah that's what I meant death you say uh uh uh what was it not Lazarus who was laying dead in the ground and already corruption setting in when Jesus said to Martha where have you buried him and if you won't doubt you shall see the glory of God did not I tell you not to doubt he said to jaras that night or that day if you'll only believe you can see the glory of God then Faith overcomes death faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over the world we're talking about conquering Faith tonight Faith conquers it all and I want to tell you when you get that kind of Revelation why don't you let your faith start speaking back yes you say John when you wrote that he didn't have to go through my troubles he did not have to deal with the folk that I deal with he did not have to go through the things that I do that's right he may not had to deal with the same folk he might not had to overcome the same thing but he never excluded them for he said this the faith is the victory that overcomes the world the whole thing how is it get Faith in it hey that's some of our problem you just need to get Faith in it get faith in your job get faith in your car get faith in your life get Faith in it without faith it's impossible impossible to please him right without faith it's impossible to please God it overcomes everything let me find that really quick get Faith in it but he never excluded it the faith is the victory that overcomes the world the whole thing how is it get Faith in it ride above it when we have the written word of God laying before us and the holy spirit is here performing and showing the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with the Divine promises written here that whatsoever things you desire when you play you believe it you shall receive it you shall have it what do you have to do then have faith not just floating faith not just floating faith not just make believe Faith but real Faith now Faith is a conqueror I I would maybe want them to pull that up cuz I really want them to be able to see this faith is a conqueror we got that pulled up we're in uh faith is the victory it says now Faith is a conqueror me try to get back there myself praise the Lord little technical difficulties here but that's all right see if I can find that says whatsoever things you desire when you play believe that you receive it and you shall have it what do you have to do then have faith not just floating faith not just make believe Faith but real faith faith is a conquerer faith is an overcomer it's just isn't a Peacemaker see that's the problem some of y'all just want to make a deal with the devil you just want to make peace with the problems in your life you ain't called to make peace with it you ain't called to cope with it you ain't called to just abstain from it and it'll never bother me anymore you are called to conquer that thing you are called to overcome it you are called to put that devil under your feet oh it's not a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith what is to conquer conquer and victory is the same now I want to see this happen tonight to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw in prison it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you whipped it you are greater than it is oh I feel religion oh where are you at Old Devil you think you had me when you pulled one over on me but I got faith and faith is the victory that overcome boo devil I said boo devil it is written by his stripes I'm Healed I shall lay hands on the sick and they shout devil you done done got whipped again complexes you done got whipped again fear you done got whipped again my faults and fail they don't bother me anymore why because they're in the sea of God's boo devil step back I like this which was first remember we're turning a corner being a little Evangelistic right now but we're going somewhere which was first a sinner or savior a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin which was first the Healer or the sickness couldn't be a Healer unless he was over the sickness It Is A Healer it can conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil you mean even the one in the Garden of Eden yeah that one because this bride has perfect faith and you know where we're going we're going back to Eden we're fulfilling the three-fold purpose of the Lord Jesus Christ what was the first purpose to manifest himself in Christ Jesus what was the second full purpose to have preeminence in the bride what was the third purpose to go back to Eden and this perfect Faith gives us victory over Every curse of the devil and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is the victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it overcomes the world when you climb into God by prayer until you see that thing conquered unto you there is something there there is nothing that can hurt you then you've overcome you got 50 miles of Elbow Room you're selling free then it sounds like he was talking about us tonight I think we got 15 miles of Elbow Room I say when you've climbed up into Heavenly places you've climbed up into that atmosphere and you found out I am an overcomer I got the devil whipped every single devil every single sickness every single fear every single complex is under my feet devil I got you what poo devil I think I need to hear Faith start to I know it's just a Wednesday night and it's just little old brother Matthew up here but why don't you break past the veil and see that you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and start speaking the word what are we here to play around or we here to have church let's have church let's get the devil on the Run hey I want to see the supernatural faith is the victory why wait any longer Peter step out the boat come on Church why wait any longer why don't you climb up a little higher come up higher John there's an entrance that has been ministered unto you come up higher you don't got to keep bouncing down around here with nip tucks and breakdowns why are you still living in the horse and buggy age you ever been going down the the road you see the Amish coming down the road if they would just get past their tradition they could get where they were going a lot faster he like you go somewhere fellowship with some people you're coming back is that is that the same are they are they still on their way wh why why why would you live down there huh why would you live below God's privileges it's time to rise up into higher Heights in the Heavenly places that God has opened up to you it's time to speak to the mountain faith is your victory ictory I don't know I could be out on a limb here somebody here needs their Joy you know like that joy that you first experienced when the Lord come around you and you had the burden of sin and you were so beat down you didn't know what to do with your life and he grabbed and wrapped his arms around you and you felt the presence of the Lord and the burden of sin lifted oh and you felt like were in Heavenly places you were just so happy and free you had to tell your mom you had to tell your dad you had to tell your neighbor you didn't even have to tell people they could just look at your face because there were something on your countenance they knew that you had been glory in the presence of the almighty God there's somebody that needs that kind of Joy back in your life I don't want to tell you that Joy is here for you right now every Redemptive blessing of God is here right now somebody just needs to take it backen [Music] why don't you speak the way Satan give it back I take my joy I take my victory I take my praise I take my worship some of us need to start I seen how y'all Worship in Africa I don't know what happened is God different here or were you a hypocrite were you just worshiping back there because your buddy was or did you really love God I'm sorry I went there but I've seen those people over there before church service they're all in one Accord sounds like a voice of waters praying presence of God so thick in there the eight-year olds the nyear olds and the 10 year olds are really entering into prayer but we've gotten so stuffed shirt and so Starry we don't even know what the move of God is and we're the bride we're going in a Rapture what are you embarrassed I don't think maram was embarrassed I don't think she cared all she knew is her Taskmaster was dead That Old Devil he done whoop me for the last time he ain't going to whoop me no more I don't whipped it [Applause] Satan's trying to come on strong trying to fight me in the Pulpit right now I rebuke that devil you try to bring on sickness in the flesh but my soul's already been raptured I'm already seated in Heavenly you want to wonder know why I shout why I dance why I get excited cuz the devil can't foil God's plan I've already made it I'm already over there Hallelujah why wait any longer Church why wait any longer other brandom later in that message you start to talk about a sister y'all just lift me up in prayer he start to talk about a sister who was in bondage to cigarettes she come up for prayer brother Brandon prayed for her oh she would she would pray and it seemed like it'd be good she come back around he said the cigarette smoke like to knock you down God gave her gave him a vision and said I see a cloud over you Troubles Down the Road and she went on she she she was professing but she had no substance with what she was professing now what the prophet said she got down the road a little bit and all of a sudden she went to the doctor and the doctor said you got cancer prophet of God said then she got down to business see when the doctor comes and says it's all over you're going to die he said Why didn't it overcome notice what he said he didn't say she Why didn't it overcome when I was praying for her she was just fluttering around see there was something there that she could tap to remember the pastor's talking about untapped resources there was something lame there but the prophet of God said she was just fluttering around but when the doctor says you got cancer and you're going to die she got down to business he goes on to say why wait that long why not get down to business on a Wednesday night with more than half the church out and Jesus walking down the aisle why don't you just go ahead and get down to business tonight why wait any longer why do we got to wait for desperation to set in where you're crying out for your baby girl or you're crying out for your son or your health is so bad you're on your death why wait any longer why don't you get down to business right now say oh God I want to go in a Rapture I want to come in behind the veil I want it to drop down I want to live in your sh glory Lord where soundproof and the only thing I can hear is your word the only thing I can hear is your love Secrets whispering to me and I'm whispering love secrets back to you oh I just want to be in that presence I want to get down to business [Applause] amen why wait we're going forward Church we're not waiting for some Calamity we're not waiting for some bomb to drop he's here why don't you have a conference with him look you ain't fooling the Holy Ghost we all know where you're living we see the way you carry yourself we see the way you dress we see the way you respond we we we feel the conversations sometimes it's not discernment sometimes it's your own thoughts but when you're in love with him the prophet says your life shows it we can see you ain't full of nobody so why don't you just be like Mar him look I ain't talking about running and shouting around the building if you get that kind of Revelation and victory in your life look we've turned the corner we ain't worrying about being Pentecostal we're not worrying about getting worked up we're not worrying about being identified with this movement we're not worried about being identified with that movement you come to the wrong guy I'm going to scream I'm going to shout I'm going to run if I feel to scream shout and run I'm going to cry I'm going to lay in the presence of God at the altar if that's what the spirit's moving on me to do because one thing I'm sure not afraid of is being identified with the Holy Spirit no matter how it wants to move in the church service if it wants to be a victory dance and a victory march let it come if it's Sovereign and laid out on the altar in the presence of God let it come all I want to say is Let It Come why don't the he Windows of Heaven open up Let the spirit of God start moving through the audience why don't you get down to business and meet God Amen yes Lord why wait any longer let's get down to business with God right now all my technical devices are failing me I don't know how long I've been but I don't think it matters what matters is if your Soul's right what matters if you if you've met him and just trying to turn the corner here let's get down to business with God right now every Redemptive blessing is yours right now now I just want to say this not just so you can be blessed see that's the Trap you go to church you get blessed you go back out in the world and you get beat down you come to the church and you're blessed you go back on the world and you're beat down that is not the cycle God has called you to live and God is Not Just blessing us just to be blessed sometimes he does you go to church and he'll he'll pour out the blessings on nonseed and seed and we'll all have a great wonderful time and a few ticks of the calendar you can't even remember when it was or if it ever happened and that's all right I love it when the Lord blesses you so much you can't even remember what where and when and how it was we should live like that we're the children of God but not just to be blessed but that you can have faith in what he has accomplished through Redemption and be what he made you and do what he called you to do all right so now now we're moving forward all right we're delivered we're set free we we we mean business with God we're living a Sanctified life let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus what did Jesus say I sanctify myself for their sake you want to know why I'm a fanatic and I'm conservative with my music because I'm sanctifying myself for their sake you know what I'm a fanatical and I'm conservative with my entertainment because I'm trying by God's grace to sanctify myself for their sake you know why I want my wife and my kids to dress conservative for the glory of God because we must sanctify ourselves for their sake why are we trying to get so close to the edge what happened but there ought to be a love affair and a love relationship oh God I wouldn't want to do something that displeases you I'm going to stay as close as I can to the mountain I'm going to stay as close to the rock as I can Lord does this outfit please you Lord oh if there's a question I stay away from it if you can't do it in Jesus name you stay away from it principles faith has spoken to your heart through the Malachi 4:5 behind everything there's a spirit motive and objective you know why I stay away from this music out there that's sung by all the churches and denominations because behind everything there's a spirit motive and objective and if they believe in a trinity and Devils travel in those titles and you're listening to their music what has happened to the church do you think brother brandom would listen to that nonsense that rock and roll I didn't mean to go here we're going forward we're going to go forward I'm moving past that stuff right we I'm sorry I'm sorry we've already we've got down to business we've thrown out all the new age denominational Christian music we've deleted the Christian radio in our car you know I remember times growing up people got so serious with God they got rid of their radio they got rid of their music cuz they were getting down to business they were sanctifying their life and you find out when you get the Holy Ghost and it gives you power over that thing then you got that thing whooped Marvels to me when you go into a restaurant and you see a Believer tapping their foot to the worldly music looks like it still got the hook in them but we're moving on why because God has a plan and a purpose for your life just as Jesus had come with a specific purpose to fulfill what was spoken of him each one of you in Eternal thought of God now made flesh in this decree season is now fooling the purpose that God intended for you to fulfill so what he did as a forerunner he went ahead of you and removed all the obstacles that would prevent you from becoming what he called you to be like I said it was rigged are you hearing me just a few more moments are you hearing me everything the devil would try to throw in your way God has already given you the victory over it so all you got to do is take your faith and speak to the mountain you know what you ought to do if you got a really big trial in front of you because you know little trial a little Victory right that's why in sports you know they want to be the champion well if you g to be the champion what do you got to do you got to beat the champion so if you got a great big obstacle in front of you just say man praise God he knew I could handle this cuz he said he'd never give you more than you could bear why don't you just start being like Caleb be like boy look at all them long necks on my Mountain I'm going to cut their head off you might as well start getting excited are you hearing me you might if you got a big trial in front of you that means you got a big victory coming amen it's about time you say Bo devil back up it is written thus sayith the Lord I'm going through I'm going to speak to my Mountain brother brandham says this in perfect Faith he says talking about Jesus said therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are you mean I'm supposed to have faith in what I am you're supposed to have faith in what you are what are you I am a believer what does a Believer do it doesn't believe the five senses and that's what drives the devil and the world crazy because you have something they don't have you have something that's looking at something they can't see you have faith he goes on in paragraph 68 maybe five more minutes he says now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are so we we're putting this to bed all right you're you're saved you're Sanctified you got the Holy Ghost and there's therefore now no condemnation amen now I want to tell you how easy it is if somebody is sitting here right now and you're condemned and in your heart you know what you've done is wrong and you want to make it right right now in your chair you say Lord I made a horrible mistake and I really didn't mean to do it and I never want to do it again Lord I want to identify with a sacrifice Lord you went to Calvary and I don't mean just lip service say Lord I'm sorry I'm turning away from it I'm going to walk away from it Lord I'm going to walk away from that relationship I've been doing things I shouldn't be doing I know it's embarrassing but you just repent he's just TR and faithful to forgive you and it's thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness you don't have to do penants you're free you're free that that's how easy that was maybe somebody right now you just got the victory you're free from that Old Devil been trying to tempt you and hold you down now you're free you ain't got to come to the altar your altar is in your heart you say Lord I am sorry I I've definitely done things I shouldn't have done Lord I plead the blood now let let he's forgiven you that you can start to have faith in what he's made you he's made you an overcomer he placed you in the ladyo and age that you would fulfill the word that has been spoken by Malachi 4:5 not just a word of justification or you would have been born in the days of Luther not just a message of of uh uh we said justification now not just a message of sanctification under Wesley or you'd have been born in that age not just an outpouring of the gifts or you've been born back in the early 1900s but God has reserved you for now that you would fulfill all the word of God that has been spoken and opened up to the bride through the revelation of the Seven Seals that that Revelation now would be manifested in you what was being opened up through that third pool what was it speak the word speak to the mountain where we saw a man stand on the earth positionally once again just like Adam he spoke to the storm he said storm go back to where you were what was it it was an Eden condition even so much the deer started to come around and say Adam is that you they weren't scared they weren't running around and what he was changed back to a young man again th this is the thoughts of God for for you because that was a first one to maturity amen and now you are now coming into that same matur that's the purpose and plan for your life not not to just just just be struggling every day and oh I'm a sinner now I'm saved I'm a sinner no we're we're now we're going forward to walk into all these things that have been opened up to us that you can have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are now that that would take a lot of a lot of time there but if I can just say this that's why God sent a prophet to tell you who you are you didn't know who you were just like Eve didn't know who she was but God brought her to Adam and Adam said you're bone of my bone and your Flesh of My Flesh God sent elaser come on Malachi 4:5 to introduce you to the bridegroom and the bridegroom looked at you and said you are now bone of my bone you're Flesh of My Flesh your life of my life your power of my power is that not what the word says you are then have faith in what he's not in the guy in the mirror we're going past that right have faith what the word says you are as Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all them speak of him and say I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in my s do nothing but it is my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you uhoh here's where we all shrink back not me what's he trying to do he's showing how Christ manifested the word and because of what Redemption has accomplished now he wants to produce the same overcoming life in his bride and he says and when the word word of God comes in you it's manif made manifest for you are a Believer now we're trying to come towards a close quickly brother bandam goes on and says says this so just pointing that out we have to have faith in what the word says we are and when you start to have that kind of faith and I'm not talking about a hop so faith but if I could say it like this a faith that speaks where you start speaking the word confession is made under salvation the scripture says life and death is in the power of tongue you got to start putting the word on your mouth and speaking the word if you say to that why cry Moses if you're in the line of duty speak the word and go forward paragraph 93 said Jesus had perfect Faith now this is where we're just honing down to a close he says and he had Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it come because he was the word is everybody okay are right y'all ready for the final stretch we're coming to a close some people love that like finally the sky is coming to a close you said that 30 minutes ago we're we're we're we're on the last lap here okay okay here we come he says Jesus had perfect faith and it it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word oh Hallelujah you become the word as you receive the word that's why he could say in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he he said as the I was in the father and the father in me he said at that day that's this day when this Revelation when the seventh seal has been revealed at that day then it's no longer I and him and him and me but now it's I and you and you and me oh Hallelujah the word declaring not only who he is but declaring who you are you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words in you this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done unto you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you have said then you shall have what you've said when you say to the mountain he said that puts you right back in the word so then who is it speaking it's the god in you it's the attribute of the word that you are in you speaking back the word that's already been spoken to you because you're becoming the word as you receive the word so you might as well start speaking the word if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt if the musicians would come I I just want to say this when your calling becomes your calling you might be called to do something but when you become the word that's calling you if I can say that your life starts to speak out the word it's one thing to be called to do something but when you start to fulfill that calling you become what you were called to do it brings the realities of the supernatural into your life just one moment so I I just really want you by faith right now to start speaking the word I am a son and daughter of God I can do the Greater Works I can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I will possess this vessel in sanctification and honor I will show my love to the Lord by the way that I carry myself I will show my love to him by the way that I treat others I will show my love to him by my conduct I will show my love to him by the way that I I will show my love to him by how I use my time come on you are the word let's start being what God made us is this is this two is this two ABCs for you don't don't worry I I got a sermon I want to preach called now I know my ABC's so we can go on to algebra because that's where we're heading how can I teach them algebra when they won't learn their ABCs but praise God we've learned our ABCs brother Billy we're going forward it's time to start being what God called us to be brother Brandon said and why Christ speak he said did you know you can be so completely surrendered to God that the devil don't know what to do with you is that what he said who's going to be that person I

read this brother brandham said in perfect Faith he said now watch he has appeared to us in the same form that he did to them in the Old Testament and in the same as he did in the New Testament and showed by the same word the same Christ and I declare you that Christ is the Holy Ghost the word Christ means the anointed one just a person that's anointed that is the Christ the anointed one how many knows that's true the anointed one there would be a man that would be anointed Anointed with what the Bible said in Acts 2 that Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God Anointed with the Holy Ghost went about and done great works and things see the god manifested proved that he was in this man and now we become Anointed with the same Spirit anointed Messiah Messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he's not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestations remember this there's nothing left for us to do but believe it and believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect Faith that's what he said about you now while we see sing this I'm saying I believe it I'm saying you said it and as you believe it and receive it you become it and as you become it start speaking it speak to the mountain I've heard Faith speak tonight I'm going to look for the manifestation of it I heard it I'm believing for
