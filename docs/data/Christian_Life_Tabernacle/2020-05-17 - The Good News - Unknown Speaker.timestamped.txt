[34:31] minds could comprehend all that you've
[34:35] done and all that you are father we just
[34:41] like to fellowship with you this evening
[34:44] and talk about you and invite your
[34:48] presence closer that we might touch the
[34:54] hem of your garment and receive from you
[34:59] we are needy and we are incapable of
[35:08] even offering the praise that you're
[35:11] worthy of
[35:15] but Lord though you know your own work
[35:18] and that's what we rely on we ask you to
[35:23] bless us this evening
[35:25] in your precious name we pray amen
[35:29] and they I mean God bless you let's turn
[35:33] into our Bibles and and just turn over
[35:40] to st. John we're just gonna have just
[35:44] just a nice time in the word I certainly
[35:47] enjoyed that special amen now that is
[35:53] just the kind of singing and song and
[35:55] that I like that was just really
[35:57] wonderful the st. John the 21st chapter
[36:04] when I had my talk with my doctor the
[36:10] one that's going to do my little
[36:12] procedure on my hand you know I told
[36:18] them that they you know that I fish you
[36:23] know and I like to fish and and so he
[36:27] said well I'm a tournament bass
[36:29] fisherman so Leslie asked me if I liked
[36:32] him I said yeah he's a fisherman I like
[36:35] him you know he's good but I also liked
[36:39] he told me he said you said now as soon
[36:43] as you get your cast off he said you can
[36:45] go fish and you'll have a brace on he
[36:47] said but you can fish with it he said I
[36:49] would and I thought yeah you know so
[36:55] before he does the operation I'm going
[36:58] to bring him some pictures of the fish I
[37:00] caught so that he'll know that he's
[37:03] doing this operation for a worthy cause
[37:06] right you know you always want to give
[37:08] person a reason for doing something you
[37:11] you you know how true that is brother
[37:13] brems says you've got to have a reason
[37:15] why you want to be healed you cannot
[37:17] have a reason for it something you got
[37:19] to have a motive something that you're
[37:21] looking forward to that mean something
[37:24] to you so how many of you guess the
[37:27] scripture just by
[37:29] that story okay let's turn the 21st
[37:31] chapter in the third verse and Simon
[37:35] Peter said unto them I go a-fishing then
[37:41] they said unto Him we also go with thee
[37:45] they went forth and entered into the
[37:48] ship immediately and that night they
[37:53] caught nothing
[37:55] but when the morning was now come Jesus
[37:59] stood on the shore but the disciples
[38:03] knew not that it was Jesus amen
[38:09] and I love this story then jesus said
[38:13] unto them children have you any meat and
[38:17] they answered him no and he said unto
[38:22] them cast the net on the right side of
[38:27] the ship and ye shall find
[38:30] they cast there for now they were not
[38:35] able to draw yet for the multitude of
[38:39] fishes
[38:41] therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved
[38:44] said unto Peter it is the Lord and when
[38:50] Simon Peter heard it it was the Lord he
[38:54] Girt with his fishing coat unto him for
[38:58] he was naked
[38:59] indeed cast himself into the sea
[39:03] Heavenly Father we asked you to bless
[39:05] your word and your precious name we pray
[39:08] amen amen god bless you you may be
[39:11] seated
[39:16] it certainly was something that story in
[39:27] itself is such a wonderful story but
[39:33] Jesus stood on the bank and they didn't
[39:37] know it was him
[39:39] and and I think that's
[39:42] sad apart when he can be with us even
[39:48] amongst us sometimes and we don't
[39:50] recognize him you know then he goes
[39:52] unrecognized and that certainly a great
[39:58] heartbreaker and a great thing to to
[40:02] realize that he can be he can even be
[40:07] present with us and we not realize that
[40:11] he was all there for us and that and the
[40:15] beautiful part of that is that he was
[40:18] resurrected and there he was they they
[40:22] they watched him you know be buried but
[40:27] now they couldn't recognize him in his
[40:31] resurrection and you know it kind of
[40:34] brings to the the story of you know the
[40:39] good news you know and that's what the
[40:42] gospel is it's the good news you know
[40:46] they tell of the time during the
[40:48] emancipation and the problem
[40:52] emancipation proclamation and that was
[40:55] that at a certain time when the Sun has
[40:58] risen that every person that was a slave
[41:03] to go free and the story goes as you
[41:08] know that the people that were able to
[41:13] climb up to the hills into the mountains
[41:17] they climbed up and then as the Sun rose
[41:22] they began to see it and I'd like to
[41:25] pick up the story and read it to you and
[41:30] it says in the days when the slaves when
[41:34] they were in bondage and they were
[41:37] slaves here in the States
[41:39] when Abraham Lincoln died to free the
[41:43] colored man and give him to write not to
[41:46] be a slave any longer they were freed at
[41:51] sunrise and I like he puts here too
[41:56] you were free that sunrise - comparing
[41:59] to the resurrection and they were so
[42:02] happy about it knowing that they were
[42:05] going to be free as soon as the Sun rose
[42:09] some of them that was healthier better
[42:13] physically fit
[42:15] they claimed way up on the mountain some
[42:18] could not go all the way to the top
[42:21] some halfway up and some all the way
[42:25] down and as soon as the Sun began to
[42:29] keep up the great strong ones was on the
[42:33] top
[42:34] I like that today the great strong
[42:36] Christians who rise up into the spheres
[42:40] of the Holy Spirit those who just come
[42:44] along the road under justification those
[42:48] who are all the way down in the valley
[42:51] of confusion they raised up and as soon
[42:55] as the ones that was high could see it
[42:59] first way off when they seen the Sun
[43:03] arising they screamed at the top of
[43:06] their voice - the ones below them saying
[43:09] we are free we are free the minute
[43:14] they've got a glimpse of it they they
[43:18] begin to testify that were free now I
[43:22] love this as we just talked about it for
[43:24] a moment we are free and then those got
[43:29] it and they let out a shout and scream
[43:32] down to the others we are free and the
[43:36] others down below that explained to the
[43:39] others we are free so the first one that
[43:44] was free shouted out we are free we are
[43:47] free and it just kept coming down coming
[43:50] down coming down we are free we are free
[43:53] now look those up on the hill could see
[43:59] the Sun so they were free but as soon as
[44:04] the news came to that fellow in the
[44:08] valley
[44:09] he was just as free as he would ever be
[44:15] whether the Sun was up or not you see it
[44:20] and alls he had to do this received the
[44:24] news Christ come to set the captive free
[44:29] you don't have to be bound down with
[44:33] habits halfway Christian life God don't
[44:37] want you to be that way he wants you to
[44:41] be free
[44:42] god anointed christ to preach freedom to
[44:47] open the prison doors and every time
[44:52] that's what he wants he wants us to be
[44:56] free just think of it you know we were
[45:00] such a people that adapt you know it's
[45:05] easy to go into denial and just adapt
[45:08] and just accept things and it's the way
[45:12] it is and I just accept it and this is
[45:15] how I'm going to have to live that's not
[45:18] what he wanted he didn't want that for
[45:20] us he didn't want us not to be a people
[45:23] without hope he doesn't want us to come
[45:26] to the acceptance that that oh well this
[45:29] is just the way they're gonna be all
[45:31] their life no that's not the kind of God
[45:34] he is that's why we pray because prayer
[45:37] changes things prayer can change things
[45:40] that's what's the beautiful part about
[45:42] asking you shall receive so prayer
[45:45] changes things so that's what he wanted
[45:47] and say you're sitting in there and he
[45:52] said hip he says god anointed christ to
[45:57] preach freedom and to open the prison
[45:59] doors say you're setting in there and
[46:03] your death sentence is on you and the
[46:08] first thing you know they're fixing to
[46:11] take you out and hang you or execute you
[46:14] in some way and the first thing you hear
[46:18] somebody come down the street saying
[46:21] hold it
[46:23] I've got a pardon you don't have to die
[46:29] now you don't have to wait till you're
[46:33] out of prison
[46:34] you're just as free right then as you
[46:38] will be when you're out now that that's
[46:44] a such a beautiful thought it has when
[46:47] you're out of that prison you're just as
[46:52] free right then as you will be when
[46:56] you're out so the man can just be as
[47:00] happy sitting in prison as he would be
[47:05] out of prison as long as he knows his
[47:09] pardon is signed
[47:11] oh my there's so much in that I would
[47:18] really like to be in me you know I don't
[47:22] have to respond to the results but I can
[47:26] be happy with the promise I can be just
[47:29] as happy accepting the promise as
[47:32] accepting the pardon as when the pardon
[47:35] and the promise comes to pass I can be
[47:38] just as happy sitting in that prison
[47:40] cell knowing that I free and knowing
[47:43] that the pardon has come and the days
[47:45] coming that I'll be out don't you feel
[47:48] that way about this old prison pest
[47:50] house right here that we're in the
[47:53] prison of this flesh we've got a promise
[47:56] that we'll be set free from this we
[47:58] should be just as happy in this old
[48:00] flesh as as we will be when we're free
[48:03] amen he says he says that's the way it
[48:08] is this morning here it is
[48:11] to every man or woman that has a hungry
[48:15] heart to come out of prison cell this
[48:19] morning the good news of the gospel is
[48:23] preached and no matter if you're still
[48:26] sitting sick if you're still sitting
[48:29] bound you can be just as free because
[48:33] the news has come to you
[48:36] you are pardoned Christ rose some
[48:39] nineteen hundred years ago this morning
[48:41] and set every prisoner free open the
[48:45] prison doors and let them come out oh
[48:48] what a marvelous thing you can be just
[48:53] as free because you heard the news and
[48:56] when that Sun come up that person that
[48:58] heard the news was just as free as the
[49:03] person who saw it
[49:06] because it was the good news and you
[49:09] know that's what's amazing is that work
[49:13] that's our Commission to go into all the
[49:18] world and give them the good news
[49:21] and and and what is the good news not
[49:27] it's not only that were pardoned because
[49:32] what good would the pardon do if we
[49:36] never had life the pardon is from death
[49:42] that's what the pardon is the pardons
[49:45] from the curse of sin the day you eat is
[49:48] the day that you die that's what the
[49:50] pardons for me it's the status that
[49:54] we've been set free and we know that
[49:57] death we were set free from death
[50:00] because he conquered death hell in the
[50:03] grave he conquered the curse of sin the
[50:07] curse of sin was put on him he took the
[50:10] curse of sin he took death he didn't he
[50:15] didn't he did they didn't take his life
[50:19] he laid his life down
[50:21] he was the resurrection in the life they
[50:24] didn't take it he laid his life down he
[50:27] gave his life there was no sin in them
[50:31] and if there was no sin in them there
[50:35] was no death in him because sin is what
[50:40] caused death death was the attribute of
[50:43] sin death was the attribute of unbelief
[50:47] she didn't believe the word of God and
[50:49] there was death now he didn't believe
[50:52] the word of God who can accuse him of
[50:54] unbelief there was nobody that me to
[50:57] kiss him of unbelief he would have never
[51:00] died but he laid down his life I lay
[51:05] down my life and I take it up again
[51:08] why did he lay down his life he laid
[51:11] down this life for us that's the good
[51:13] news he laid down his life for us so
[51:16] that he could impart to us eternal life
[51:20] and so that that's that was the the
[51:23] Great Commission is that he's risen
[51:27] think of that that that's that's what
[51:31] that our testimony is that's what our
[51:34] gospel is that's what our Commission is
[51:37] our Commission isn't to be history
[51:40] teachers and the history's good if it
[51:49] was just history it would be a wonderful
[51:53] story but it's more than history it's
[51:59] the good news that he's risen he's
[52:02] conquered death hell in the grave he
[52:04] what good would it have done if he he
[52:08] didn't rise we should say that he died
[52:12] but but that's not the news the news is
[52:15] that he's he's alive he's risen and and
[52:20] I like this statement here that is
[52:22] spoken he says and the resurrection is
[52:25] just as vital today and just as real to
[52:31] every human heart that believes it as it
[52:34] was to Mary Magdalene in them who stood
[52:38] at that grave that morning and who's
[52:40] seen him the fact that he's alive it is
[52:46] just as vital to us today as it was to
[52:52] them when they've seen him just be he
[52:55] was they when he set them free were just
[52:59] as free
[53:00] hearing the Word of God just as vital
[53:06] just as free as Mary Magdalene and he
[53:09] says he stood at the grave here he is
[53:13] and there here he is and there her name
[53:19] called Mary and she she looked around
[53:23] and said rabboni or master that's just
[53:26] as real to every heart this morning
[53:29] that's born of the Spirit of God by the
[53:33] resurrection power as it was to the
[53:36] woman standing there that grave in the
[53:39] morning that's the good news is that
[53:41] he's he's resurrected now why is that so
[53:46] good because what good would had done if
[53:48] he was resurrected but he wasn't the
[53:50] same if he was different if he arose
[53:58] somebody that was different if he arose
[54:01] somebody that that didn't have the same
[54:06] care or didn't have the same heart that
[54:10] wouldn't be a very good
[54:12] what gospel would we have but that's our
[54:15] gospel that's what we're commissioned
[54:18] that that's what that what it means to
[54:22] us and that's what he said is he sent us
[54:25] to go tell that he's alive so if he's
[54:30] alive and he's the same then the gospel
[54:34] is he's here doing the same works that
[54:38] he did 2,000 years ago he hasn't stopped
[54:42] he's still in party life he's still
[54:46] doing the same things that he always
[54:50] does and that's the good news is that
[54:52] he's not only resurrected but he's here
[54:59] the church got away from that the church
[55:05] began to worship Him historically they
[55:08] begin to lay down the Commission the
[55:11] Commission just wasn't to go into the
[55:14] war
[55:14] world and talk about the history but the
[55:20] the Commission was to goand in the world
[55:23] and lay your hands on the sick and they
[55:25] shall recover to cast out demons too to
[55:29] do the works that I do you shall do also
[55:32] it was the proof of the resurrection in
[55:36] the believer and when the church got
[55:39] away from that and they were no good
[55:44] they no longer were preaching a present
[55:48] tense just they deceive me he's present
[55:54] tense
[55:56] he said if two or three of you gathered
[56:01] together in my name I will be there I
[56:04] will be in your mess I mean it goes
[56:08] unrecognized
[56:10] that's why lady Asiya needed eyesalve
[56:14] that they could see they needed
[56:17] something to bring us back to the
[56:20] reality that Jesus Christ the same one
[56:24] that was veiled in flesh 2,000 years ago
[56:27] and walked on the shore of Galilee that
[56:30] same person is here present doing the
[56:36] same things that he did then the church
[56:42] got so far away from it that God
[56:46] promised when this world caught in a
[56:49] labial got seeing condition when it got
[56:52] in the condition as it was in the days
[56:55] of Noah and it was in the days of Sodom
[56:57] he would again make a visitation to us
[57:03] to show the Gentiles that he still life
[57:10] if it wasn't a new Jesus it wasn't a
[57:16] Jesus that came down from heaven
[57:20] it was the Jesus that was here that had
[57:25] gone so
[57:27] and the works that he did were no longer
[57:31] being done they weren't talking about
[57:36] him the same yesterday and today and
[57:42] forever they were talking to him about
[57:46] yesterday they were preaching of Jesus
[57:49] of yesterday you know sometimes we get
[57:53] kind of like that with the message of
[57:55] the hour we preach a yesterday's message
[57:58] it's not a yesterday message it's the
[58:01] eternal Word of God and the message was
[58:03] is that that he was going to to become
[58:07] one with us
[58:10] that there's a union going to take place
[58:13] there was a people that he was going to
[58:15] unite himself in and become one with and
[58:19] they were going to become like him
[58:21] that's how they started to preach a
[58:24] historical Jesus and when you just
[58:27] preach a historical Jesus you're not
[58:29] preaching a resurrected Jesus they
[58:35] preaching to Jesus that's gone to heaven
[58:39] but that's not what he promised he said
[58:42] I'll be with you even in you till the
[58:44] end I will not leave you comfortless but
[58:48] I personal pronoun will come again oh
[58:54] you know we would get so far away from
[58:57] the understanding that our very purpose
[59:01] is to magnify the Lord that that's what
[59:08] our our hearts desire is to demonstrate
[59:12] the resurrection that Keith he's here
[59:16] he's risen that that's the news that we
[59:20] preached the good news is he's alive and
[59:23] he's the same and the power of the
[59:29] Resurrection is present and that's what
[59:32] our testimony is you hear the gospel
[59:36] just like they heard the news and you
[59:40] accept it in your heart and pain and you
[59:44] believe it and you repent of your sins
[59:49] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[59:51] Jesus Christ and that resurrection takes
[59:57] its abode in you now you possess
[1:00:02] resurrection I really believe that I
[1:00:06] just burns in my heart I can't help it
[1:00:09] and then so just think that he's
[1:00:13] Commission's us and sends us out to
[1:00:19] share this news the news of this message
[1:00:25] was more than brother Branham was a
[1:00:28] prophet this message woke it was a
[1:00:32] demonstration to show that Jesus Christ
[1:00:36] was the same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:39] and he was present with us veiled in
[1:00:43] flesh doing the same signs and wonders
[1:00:46] that he did 2,000 years ago that the
[1:00:50] faith of the believer would be restored
[1:00:55] it was a restoration that when Peter in
[1:01:04] them stood on the shore they they did
[1:01:07] they didn't recognize him but when that
[1:01:11] net was full when the sign he did the
[1:01:18] same works that he did he you know
[1:01:23] that's one thing I like about the Lord
[1:01:26] he's the creator of the solution a man
[1:01:31] he don't need to use things he's the
[1:01:34] creator of the solution when Abraham
[1:01:37] needed an offering not created and
[1:01:40] offering when the children were hungry
[1:01:43] he created fish and loaves when they
[1:01:47] tarried all night
[1:01:49] he created the solution he's resurrected
[1:01:55] he can create our solution he doesn't
[1:02:01] use things made by hand he can but also
[1:02:08] he can create ah I just see it so much
[1:02:13] even in my own life I'll need something
[1:02:16] from God and I'll create the way that he
[1:02:19] can do it Lord if you'll just follow my
[1:02:24] advice and do this and do that you know
[1:02:30] if you get such-and-such to lend me this
[1:02:33] money and you again you'll give me a and
[1:02:37] this guy hires me and I make so much an
[1:02:40] hour and oh if you could just get all
[1:02:43] this lined up then everything will be
[1:02:46] well he's the creator of the solution I
[1:02:51] remember I was driving one day and I'd
[1:02:53] cashed my paycheck and I set it on the
[1:02:56] seat next to me and I was driving down
[1:02:58] the road didn't have much
[1:02:59] air-conditioning pulled the windows down
[1:03:02] a little bit and my paycheck flew out
[1:03:04] the window and I got out and tried to
[1:03:09] find it and the wind was blowing and I
[1:03:11] just so heartbroken and everything but I
[1:03:13] wasn't in my heart I thought you know
[1:03:15] there's somebody down the road praising
[1:03:17] God you know what I mean thank you Jesus
[1:03:21] my dentist bill I didn't know how I was
[1:03:23] gonna pay this and God I believe God
[1:03:25] might just created the solution you know
[1:03:28] he sees God more amen those aren't the
[1:03:33] things we need to worry about we need to
[1:03:35] worry about testifying to his presence
[1:03:40] that's what we need to go to we need to
[1:03:42] go to him like I said this morning he's
[1:03:45] here that you got to have a conference
[1:03:47] with them that's the whole point of the
[1:03:49] resurrection is that he's gonna walk us
[1:03:52] all the way through they he didn't he
[1:03:57] said I won't leave you comfortless but
[1:04:01] I'll go with you I'll be there I'll be
[1:04:03] present tense
[1:04:05] oh my you think that if we
[1:04:08] could start living daily with the
[1:04:11] present tense Lord what kind of
[1:04:15] atmosphere would be around us what kind
[1:04:18] of good news would come out of our mouth
[1:04:20] what kind of hope would we be telling
[1:04:22] people people gives you just a real sad
[1:04:25] sort sob story you see man that's
[1:04:27] terrible I really feel for you but the
[1:04:31] only good thing I can say is Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ is here and he's the same
[1:04:36] yesterday today and forever and he can
[1:04:39] create a solution he's still a healer
[1:04:43] and that's what he did he sent us out
[1:04:47] into the world now listen to what Jesus
[1:04:49] said he says the father that sent me is
[1:04:52] with me oh my what a decoration what a
[1:04:58] word the father that sent me comes with
[1:05:03] me it's not I that does the work it's
[1:05:07] the father that's in me that does the
[1:05:10] work I know as the father goes with me
[1:05:14] and in that that was what it was like he
[1:05:19] said listen as the father sent me so do
[1:05:23] I send you he don't only send you but he
[1:05:30] goes with you I'll be with you even in
[1:05:34] you till the end of the world and that
[1:05:38] was in God all that was in God he poured
[1:05:43] into Christ and all that was in Christ
[1:05:46] he emptied out into the believer the
[1:05:51] church God is with you though I am with
[1:05:55] you always even until the end of the
[1:05:59] world
[1:05:59] that's the declaration of God's Word
[1:06:03] that's what the Bible says that's what I
[1:06:06] believe that's what we believe you know
[1:06:12] I thought of that statement he said
[1:06:15] there was another conference which way
[1:06:18] was they going to do this church where
[1:06:22] going to put the new Church into the
[1:06:24] hands of a man having a Pope and
[1:06:33] Cardinals and bishops and end things
[1:06:38] were they going to put it in an
[1:06:40] affiliation another denomination
[1:06:43] something that we could join and be a
[1:06:46] part of he say he said no oh they all
[1:06:51] found this church I will come again and
[1:06:54] I'll be with them and I'll be in them
[1:06:58] and I personal pronoun the Holy Spirit
[1:07:01] is not a third person it's not a second
[1:07:05] person it's not a separate person it's
[1:07:07] the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:07:10] return back to the believer in the form
[1:07:13] of the Holy Spirit to lead and guide him
[1:07:16] the Holy Spirit is him in spirit form
[1:07:21] with us he didn't leave us and if he
[1:07:27] sent to us he said as the father hath
[1:07:32] sent me so do I send you oh my that's
[1:07:40] something that grab hold of that that's
[1:07:44] something to hang onto that something to
[1:07:50] that that's so real and to the believer
[1:07:54] you know that that he says yoked herself
[1:07:58] up with him for my yoke is light and my
[1:08:02] burdens are easy don't yoke up with the
[1:08:06] things of the world
[1:08:07] don't yoked up in different societies
[1:08:10] and organizations yoke yourself singly
[1:08:15] with the Lord Jesus in order that you
[1:08:19] can do it and and see the resurrection
[1:08:29] just to see the resurrection that was so
[1:08:33] beautiful
[1:08:35] in in the discernment lines and and in
[1:08:39] the lane hands on this of the sift and
[1:08:42] of taking of the hands what we witness
[1:08:45] was the resurrection we resin we saw a
[1:08:51] resurrected Jesus demonstrating that
[1:08:56] resurrection life and the power of that
[1:08:59] resurrection life to an age that had
[1:09:02] gone totally dark in other words someone
[1:09:07] on the mountain saw the rising of the
[1:09:09] Sun and cried out and said we're free
[1:09:13] the works that I do shall you do also I
[1:09:18] wonder why we don't look at ourselves
[1:09:20] like that it's always so easy to believe
[1:09:26] it in somebody else instead of accepting
[1:09:32] it for ourselves
[1:09:35] what a great what a great Commission
[1:09:38] that was given you know to yoke
[1:09:42] ourselves up and and to realize that
[1:09:47] we're ambassadors because isn't that
[1:09:50] what we testify to is that we heard we
[1:09:55] heard about him faith cometh by her
[1:09:58] hearing they heard they were free and
[1:10:02] you heard about the Lord and the spirit
[1:10:08] convicted you of sin it's a wonderful
[1:10:15] thing to feel conviction it's not
[1:10:19] present at the time it's not pleasant it
[1:10:24] doesn't make you feel real wonderful if
[1:10:27] you're min-seok convicted you just feel
[1:10:29] like you're vibrating you know and it
[1:10:33] just seems like you're burning you're on
[1:10:36] fire I mean it's it's beyond
[1:10:39] embarrassment you just feel so exposed
[1:10:43] you just feel so
[1:10:47] I liked what somebody asked a brother
[1:10:52] George the other day Smith he said how
[1:10:55] was it when you meant brother branham
[1:10:59] for the first time having been talking
[1:11:02] to his daughter he said well I I could I
[1:11:06] could tell he was reading the hard drive
[1:11:08] you know it's like why not let him read
[1:11:16] it he knows it anyway
[1:11:19] why not let him you know bring us under
[1:11:23] conviction why not know he's president
[1:11:28] Lord your presence your real put me
[1:11:31] under conviction show me my life let me
[1:11:33] take a look at myself show me what I
[1:11:36] have Nita I know you're here I know
[1:11:39] you're walking with me not only doesn't
[1:11:43] he send you but he goes with you he says
[1:11:48] the father says I said so I send you not
[1:11:51] only does he send you but he goes with
[1:11:53] you I'll be with you even in you till
[1:11:57] the end of the world I'll be with you
[1:12:02] he's right here
[1:12:05] what a time to come and fellowship with
[1:12:08] him he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:11] forever that's what he wants us to bear
[1:12:14] witness dude he wants us to bear witness
[1:12:17] to a resurrected Jesus not a historical
[1:12:20] Jesus but one that's the same yesterday
[1:12:22] today and forever that can do the same
[1:12:25] things in other words a God that still
[1:12:27] can create the solution he creates the
[1:12:35] deliverance
[1:12:37] someone just delivered it wasn't man
[1:12:40] that did it it wasn't a program that
[1:12:44] does it I've seen people choose shoes
[1:12:48] Nicorette or whatever that stuff is like
[1:12:51] in cigarettes
[1:12:56] true that went up what are you doing I
[1:13:00] quit smoking you chew gum you know I'm
[1:13:05] not saying that gums nasty habit it's
[1:13:08] just a little nasty of a habit but it
[1:13:11] ain't terrible but daddy he creates the
[1:13:16] solution he's alive he's a creator he
[1:13:20] still does the supernatural if he can't
[1:13:23] work in the natural realms the carnal
[1:13:26] mind can only see carnal but the
[1:13:29] spiritual mind sees spiritual and that
[1:13:33] that's the beauty of the resurrection he
[1:13:37] says and he's the same yesterday today
[1:13:39] and forever that's the scripture that's
[1:13:42] what we believe to be the truth that's
[1:13:46] what we accept to be the truth he's same
[1:13:50] in principle he's same in power he's the
[1:13:55] same in love he's the same in every way
[1:13:59] that he was then now he has come with
[1:14:04] the church as God sent him he went with
[1:14:09] him as he sends us and Commission's us
[1:14:14] he goes with us in the same love the
[1:14:17] same power the same principle now why is
[1:14:21] this resurrection so important to it why
[1:14:26] is the fact that he sent us so important
[1:14:30] to us and that he went with us why is it
[1:14:33] so important to us and I thought it was
[1:14:37] so beautifully summed up he said and God
[1:14:41] raised him up if God hadn't been with
[1:14:48] him he would have never raised him up on
[1:14:52] the third day so the father that sent
[1:14:55] him is always with him and with him and
[1:15:01] went with him to the grave and raised
[1:15:05] him up the third day
[1:15:08] and as God sent me he said so do I send
[1:15:14] you I'll be with you why is that if that
[1:15:18] same resurrection is in US isn't that
[1:15:21] what this is all about if the same
[1:15:23] spirit that was in Christ Jesus
[1:15:26] dwell in us it will also raise our
[1:15:30] mortal bodies isn't that what the good
[1:15:32] news is that he rose and that what
[1:15:35] raised him from the dead was that there
[1:15:38] was no sin in him
[1:15:39] he laid his life down he laid his life
[1:15:42] down at Calvary he took his life because
[1:15:44] what was that it was the God that sent
[1:15:47] him in him that's what raised him up
[1:15:52] what was in him he knew that the God
[1:15:56] that sent him was in him now if we know
[1:16:00] that the God that it was that was
[1:16:04] resurrected that same Christ that was
[1:16:06] resurrected if he sent us oh he sent us
[1:16:11] he sent you by putting your name on the
[1:16:15] Lamb's Book of Life he sent you by
[1:16:17] predestinated you to be to this age you
[1:16:22] were sent before the foundation of the
[1:16:24] world his workmanship Christ Jesus for
[1:16:28] deigned unto good works that you should
[1:16:30] walk in them if he sent you he comes
[1:16:35] with you and if he's in you and with you
[1:16:39] he goes to the grave with you and if he
[1:16:43] goes to the grave with you he raises you
[1:16:46] up because he is the resurrection he is
[1:16:50] the life oh he says he said through the
[1:16:56] end of the world
[1:16:57] he says when our Easter comes he'll be
[1:17:01] there just the same as God was on that
[1:17:04] Easter morning raising him up from the
[1:17:07] dead now in symbol of that he has
[1:17:10] brought this before there can be a
[1:17:12] resurrection there has to be a death and
[1:17:15] it has to be one thing then go anyway
[1:17:19] and
[1:17:21] and he says for that has to be one thing
[1:17:24] then go away and then come back to be a
[1:17:29] resurrection it means to be brought back
[1:17:33] and before a man can be raised up in the
[1:17:36] resurrection with Christ he has to die
[1:17:39] out to himself he has to die out to all
[1:17:43] of his worldly associates die out to all
[1:17:47] the worldly habits die out in everything

[1:18:45] it you can walk up and down the beach
[1:18:48] you can go on the boardwalk but you
[1:18:51] can't go in the water now is that thing

[1:19:31] thing that saying is
[1:19:33] the Word of God the whole world the
[1:19:35] prophet of God said has gone in saying
[1:19:42] like I said earlier they shut down
[1:19:46] restaurants in everything but they let
[1:19:48] everybody go in Home Depot like they
[1:19:54] knew if they're gonna be at home they
[1:19:58] better they're gonna fix things you

[1:20:23] Furniture piled up clothes filed up
[1:20:27] everything piled up I guess they didn't
[1:20:30] get the memo nobody could come out and
[1:20:32] buy it
[1:20:33] they shut goodwill down and the people
[1:20:36] still kept dumping their stuff all day

[1:21:11] what I mean people couldn't live without
[1:21:13] it
[1:21:14] necessity closed churches leave liquor
[1:21:18] store open I mean we need something that
[1:21:27] that's what we're testifying to we've
[1:21:29] got somebody to lead us we got somebody
[1:21:31] that's present we've got a present tense
[1:21:34] God what's he gonna do he'll create the
[1:21:38] solution if he has to we don't have to
[1:21:41] worry about that we have to keep our
[1:21:43] eyes on him we've got to be yoked up
[1:21:45] with him we've got to be visibly and
[1:21:49] spiritually and mentally conscious of
[1:21:53] his presence because this is the time
[1:21:57] heaps most real to us this is the time
[1:22:02] he said I'll be a present help in the
[1:22:05] time of trouble I'll not leave you I'll
[1:22:08] be there with you
[1:22:09] a walk through it all the way with you I
[1:22:12] won't separate Mike myself from you I'm
[1:22:17] not living in in in the past tense I'm
[1:22:22] in the present tense and I want to
[1:22:25] worship Him in the present tense I would
[1:22:30] love for our conduct to be like him how
[1:22:35] many would be late for dinner if Jesus
[1:22:37] was the guest forget forget just the
[1:22:42] president the United States was coming
[1:22:44] to your house oh you'd sweep it up clean
[1:22:48] it up and get it all ready you know all
[1:22:50] the television cameras are going to be
[1:22:52] flashing onion everybody's house is
[1:22:55] going to be there you wouldn't be late
[1:22:58] president of the United States standing
[1:23:00] there all the cameras and everything you
[1:23:02] come tooling up about 20 minutes late
[1:23:06] and your work clothes and hey how are
[1:23:09] you I voted Democrat
[1:23:13] No No
[1:23:16] but yet we treat the presence of the
[1:23:18] Lord like that just think if his word is
[1:23:23] true the first time the first two
[1:23:26] believers comes into the house of the
[1:23:29] Lord he's there not he don't dwell in
[1:23:34] buildings or things made with hands he
[1:23:37] dwells in his word and when two
[1:23:39] believers come together believing and
[1:23:42] agreeing on any one thing he's there so
[1:23:46] the next person that walks in walks into
[1:23:48] his presence and walks into his present
[1:23:51] and it were a conscious people of the
[1:23:55] resurrection the resurrection is just as
[1:23:58] vital to us and it's real to us as we
[1:24:01] saw it and when those disciples sat on
[1:24:04] that shore and when he said cast a net
[1:24:07] and they pulled out the net and John
[1:24:09] said it's the Lord Peter girded themself
[1:24:14] up and swam to the shore and when he got
[1:24:17] there he took of their catch and he had
[1:24:20] bread and fish upon the fire and he said
[1:24:25] come and dine that's what he's telling
[1:24:28] us come and dine on all my promises all
[1:24:32] my riches all the things I'm here I'm
[1:24:35] here to do for you exceedingly and
[1:24:37] abundantly above what you can ask for
[1:24:40] thing you don't have to run off I'm with
[1:24:44] you well I'm not too clean though he
[1:24:46] come reason with me come talk with me
[1:24:49] though your sins be like scarlet
[1:24:51] I'll make them white as snow I'm
[1:24:53] resurrected I'm here I'm doing the same
[1:24:56] things that I did 2,000 years ago I'm
[1:24:59] alive for you I'm not gonna leave you
[1:25:01] I'm gonna go with you I'm gonna keep you
[1:25:05] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[1:25:08] my hand I'm going to finish the work
[1:25:10] than you that I started if we don't we
[1:25:16] take this message and turn it into a
[1:25:18] denomination we let it drift back to
[1:25:24] days gone by
[1:25:26] and stories come by he said what would
[1:25:32] follow this message is another book of
[1:25:34] Acts another testimonies of the real
[1:25:38] resurrected Jesus doing the supernatural
[1:25:41] in our presence giving God the glory for
[1:25:47] the things he's done in our life I would
[1:25:50] hate to think that he's gone
[1:25:52] unrecognized that day he's like a
[1:26:00] Wallflower
[1:26:01] and he's put off to the side and he's
[1:26:07] not considered that we know he we know
[1:26:11] that he was and we know that he will be
[1:26:18] but he didn't say I
[1:26:20] I was the was and I will be the will be
[1:26:27] he said I am I'm the I am I'm the
[1:26:33] present tense God and I just thought
[1:26:36] thought in my heart oh if we could just
[1:26:39] come to the place where that resurrected
[1:26:43] Lord is so real to us it's about him our
[1:26:48] words glorify him our lives we act like
[1:26:51] he's sitting right next to us
[1:26:54] boy that was peep you know that's the
[1:26:58] only reason prophet of God said that
[1:27:00] men's sin is because they feel they're
[1:27:03] out of his presence they don't feel he's
[1:27:08] there but he said he'd be there so he's
[1:27:12] there and that when that conviction came
[1:27:15] in your life and you asked him in his
[1:27:18] heart and you became one with him he
[1:27:22] still today keeps his word and really
[1:27:28] you
[1:27:29] when our prophet came that's what he
[1:27:33] kept saying over and over and over again
[1:27:38] he's the same
[1:27:40] yesterday today and forever the works
[1:27:46] that I do shall you do also because I go
[1:27:50] to the Father I will not leave you
[1:27:53] comfortless but I will come again and
[1:27:56] I'll be with you even in you as the
[1:28:00] father hath sent me so have I sent you
[1:28:05] also such a beautiful thing that we're
[1:28:09] built on and I'll just in my heart for
[1:28:13] our church and I don't know if we'll
[1:28:16] ever be back to normal
[1:28:19] you know we've had people that come
[1:28:23] 20-30 minutes late and they just kind of
[1:28:27] drift in and maybe they come in and they
[1:28:30] sit on this pew and and I don't blame
[1:28:33] them for falling asleep I'm not a very
[1:28:35] you know deep emotional preacher but
[1:28:42] just the revelation of his promise to be
[1:28:48] here and if we could look to him he
[1:28:53] would do the same not only for us but
[1:28:56] for the loved ones and the people that
[1:28:58] we present to him how many would you say
[1:29:03] if you knew Jesus real well and and when
[1:29:06] of your friends came along you'd say
[1:29:08] Lord which here would you I'd like to
[1:29:09] introduce you to my friend bill and bill
[1:29:14] he's got a needy daughter and well I'm
[1:29:18] asking you if you would touch him you
[1:29:20] think he's alive to do that I do I think
[1:29:24] he's really a live Church and I think he
[1:29:27] really loves us and I think he our love
[1:29:30] I think he's looking for that respect
[1:29:34] and that love as a bride to her husband
[1:29:38] as a relationship that he's home and
[1:29:44] he's one and he's here and I vowed to
[1:29:48] serve them and be with them and and in
[1:29:52] that great fellowship
[1:29:54] would enter into our heart so I just
[1:29:56] asked as we go forward maybe as a church
[1:29:59] and we are waiting what the Lord has for
[1:30:02] us and you know like I said we used to
[1:30:08] have three rows down the middle and
[1:30:11] people in the bathroom
[1:30:12] everyone scrunched together do you like
[1:30:15] the spacing between the pews better
[1:30:17] maybe just pray those unbelievers don't
[1:30:20] come back all right we'll only have a
[1:30:26] church a one kind of believer right no
[1:30:29] make believers no one but he was just
[1:30:31] believers whew I wonder how many of us
[1:30:35] really meet that qualification let's
[1:30:39] just strive to go forward but I don't
[1:30:43] know but the one thing I know is
[1:30:46] whatever lies ahead I want to go with
[1:30:50] him whatever lies ahead I want him to be
[1:30:54] there whatever lies ahead I want to look
[1:30:58] to that leadership I want to be
[1:31:00] conscious of his promise and I want to
[1:31:05] see the resurrection because when I see
[1:31:09] the power of the resurrection it
[1:31:10] confirms to me that I possess
[1:31:14] resurrection and I want it to be real
[1:31:18] especially now I want to have my ticket
[1:31:20] in my hand I want to have the token
[1:31:24] applied I want to be at the train
[1:31:26] station ready to go I want to have an
[1:31:32] awareness about me like I've never had
[1:31:35] before
[1:31:36] and I just thought of that little
[1:31:39] message that we read from tonight proof
[1:31:42] of the resurrection the proof of the
[1:31:46] resurrection is his presence that proves
[1:31:51] he's alive because he's here doing what
[1:31:57] he said he would do and that's how I
[1:31:59] know he's alive and he's here because I
[1:32:03] see the effects of his presence in our
[1:32:07] lives god bless you brother billy if you
[1:32:09] come let's stand together we ask you to
[1:32:17] pray for me in fact maybe i could ask
[1:32:21] some of the brothers to come and and
[1:32:23] just lay your hands on me and pray for
[1:32:25] me for my my surgery i i i i just feel
[1:32:33] that this is the way to go it's not
[1:32:35] something that is so pressing that i
[1:32:41] just feel that this is what god's
[1:32:43] provided i believe god uses doctors you
[1:32:46] understand the doctor told me that
[1:32:48] there's nothing we can do you know i
[1:32:51] mean it just there's nothing that we
[1:32:54] have we have no medicine we have no help
[1:32:56] for you then i would be asking you to
[1:32:59] play hands on me that my faith i could
[1:33:01] have a miracle but it's a simple
[1:33:04] solution that they have for a problem
[1:33:07] that will allow me to be able to hold
[1:33:10] the glass again in my hand and turn my
[1:33:12] car keys i accept that that healing
[1:33:15] comes from the Lord and that he uses men
[1:33:19] so anyway if we've seen this song maybe
[1:33:24] some of any other brothers they'd like
[1:33:26] to pray for me if you just come up and
[1:33:28] lay your hands on me I'd be happy to
[1:33:31] have you pray for me that God would
[1:33:34] would do abundantly for me all that he
[1:33:38] promised he'll do and that he's really
[1:33:41] the physician that'll be present so hey
[1:33:45] man Thank You brothers I believe we have
[1:33:50] the Jesus that hears your prayers don't
