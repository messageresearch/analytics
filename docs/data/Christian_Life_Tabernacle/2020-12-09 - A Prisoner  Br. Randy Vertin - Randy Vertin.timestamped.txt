[41:46] want to surrender all to him
[41:48] amen amen everybody feel happy
[41:51] this evening you should because you're
[41:53] in the presence of the lord
[41:54] and the scripture says that in his
[41:56] presence his fullness of joy
[41:59] so you're going to fulfill the word amen
[42:00] and we're going to be full of joy this
[42:02] evening
[42:03] let's turn in the scripture if we could
[42:05] to first corinthians chapter 7.
[42:19] i'm going to read a couple of uh three
[42:20] different verses here
[42:22] first corinthians chapter 7
[42:28] and then we're going to go to matthew
[42:29] chapter 6
[42:32] after that
[42:38] and we're going to read first
[42:39] corinthians chapter 7 verses 32 to 34.
[42:49] verse 32 says but i would have you
[42:52] without carefulness he that is unmarried
[42:55] care
[42:55] for the things that belong to the lord
[42:57] how may be how he may please the lord
[43:00] but he that is married careth for the
[43:02] things that that are of the world how he
[43:03] may please his wife
[43:05] there is difference also between a wife
[43:06] and a virgin the unmarried woman careth
[43:08] for the things of the lord
[43:10] that she may be holy both in body and in
[43:13] spirit
[43:13] but she that is married care for the
[43:15] things of the world
[43:17] how she may please her husband amen
[43:19] let's turn to
[43:21] matthew chapter six
[43:24] and then the last verse we're going to
[43:26] go to is the book of philemon
[43:37] matthew chapter 6.
[43:46] verse 24
[43:52] no man can serve two masters for either
[43:54] he will hate the one and love the other
[43:57] or else he will hold to the one and
[43:58] despise the other
[44:00] ye cannot serve god and mammon
[44:04] and then the book of philemon if you're
[44:06] looking for it because it's so tiny it's
[44:08] the book directly before hebrews
[44:16] and we'll just read
[44:20] the first two verses paul
[44:23] a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy
[44:26] our brother
[44:27] unto philemon our dearly beloved and
[44:29] fellow laborer
[44:31] and to our beloved affia
[44:35] and archips or archipus
[44:38] our fellow soldier and to the church in
[44:41] thy house
[44:42] we'll just read verse three as well
[44:43] grace to you and peace from god
[44:46] our father and the lord jesus christ
[44:48] amen
[44:49] let's just power our heads in a prayer
[44:50] heavenly father lord as we just opened
[44:53] your word this evening
[44:54] lord we can open up the the natural
[44:57] pages lord but it takes the holy ghost
[44:59] lord your very life to reveal it to the
[45:01] to the soul of a man or
[45:04] a person lord and we just ask right now
[45:05] that your spirit would just be amongst
[45:07] your people this evening
[45:08] to speak to the hearts of the believers
[45:11] lord may you draw us closer to you lord
[45:12] may you anoint your people anoint
[45:15] the service by your grace lord that your
[45:17] perfect will be done and that you get
[45:18] glory to yourself
[45:19] we just lift up the name of the lord
[45:21] jesus this evening and we do it all
[45:23] according to you by your grace and and
[45:26] your will we ask it lord in the name of
[45:28] jesus christ we pray
[45:29] amen amen you may be seated
[45:34] maybe a couple of verses that maybe seem
[45:37] a little
[45:40] discordant in the way they kind of go
[45:42] together but i just trust
[45:44] the way the lord put it on my heart i
[45:46] trust you know he'll make a way to
[45:48] open it to you the way he revealed it uh
[45:50] to me
[45:52] um when in the the book of philemon
[45:55] there in the first verse i was really
[45:58] taken by the message brother branham
[45:59] preached on a prisoner
[46:02] and uh i guess if you want to title it
[46:04] that's kind of what i would title it you
[46:05] know what
[46:06] uh the age that we're living in we
[46:09] understand we're in that end of the
[46:10] laodicean age and
[46:12] you know we we use all the terms that we
[46:14] like to use but we talk about that
[46:15] transitioning period we've been
[46:17] smitten out of that age we're in a
[46:19] bright age now and yet we're still
[46:20] living in a layout to see an age
[46:22] we're definitely in that blending over
[46:23] time and the thing that really
[46:26] just strikes my heart about it is the
[46:28] lord doesn't show it
[46:30] us any of these things without a purpose
[46:32] and we understand the age that we live
[46:34] in laodicea
[46:35] uh brother branham typed it as that was
[46:37] a woman
[46:38] it's a woman's name and and we
[46:40] understand it's definitely a woman's age
[46:42] we see the the age of the woman
[46:44] and and what they call women's liberty
[46:47] or the different the feminist
[46:49] movement and all the things that they're
[46:50] doing and
[46:52] but we also understand that the very
[46:54] meaning of that word was people's rights
[46:57] and if there's any hour that we're
[46:59] seeing it more and more manifest
[47:02] the how the natural man can become
[47:05] twisted in their if they're trying the
[47:08] blind leading the blind won't they all
[47:10] fall into the ditch
[47:11] and we're seeing it to be perfectly
[47:14] honest we're seeing it on all sides
[47:16] you know and i can't help you know we
[47:18] have to maybe make reference as much as
[47:19] we don't like to make reference to the
[47:21] political realm of things going on
[47:22] because we're living in the world
[47:24] we're living in the world where we're
[47:26] not of the world we're from above
[47:28] by the grace of god thank you brother
[47:30] sorry
[47:31] and the world that we live in is
[47:34] certainly possessed by that spirit i'm
[47:35] sorry brother i was probably juking you
[47:37] out a little bit i apologize
[47:38] this is going i don't even know didn't
[47:40] even know i was doing it but
[47:41] i appreciate that brother um but we're
[47:44] in that age of people's rights
[47:47] and and we understand that it's a spirit
[47:49] that is completely
[47:51] taken over the age and so much that
[47:54] if you really were to actually boil down
[47:57] on a natural scale the two sides of the
[48:00] argument we see now
[48:02] between what we call conservative or
[48:05] liberal or whatever they want to name
[48:07] names they want to give themselves
[48:09] we find one they would both boil down to
[48:12] the same idea
[48:13] they want their rights just just goes to
[48:16] show you that a natural man
[48:18] with a natural mind in a natural world
[48:21] with a natural spirit is gonna lead them
[48:24] straight into a ditch
[48:26] because on one side we have one that
[48:28] says well i wanna i'm gonna do
[48:29] everything i can for
[48:30] our what we call our constitutional
[48:32] rights and no doubt to an
[48:34] extent that's a wonderful thing we're
[48:35] grateful for it and the freedoms we
[48:36] still have
[48:37] and on the other side they say well i
[48:39] want to have my rights to
[48:40] call myself whatever i want to call
[48:42] myself to behave however i want to
[48:44] behave
[48:45] and i'm just putting that nicely but we
[48:47] understand what these things are in this
[48:49] age
[48:50] but we see they both boil down to what
[48:52] they want their rights
[48:54] i want to be able to do what i want to
[48:56] do i want to be able to live the way i
[48:58] want to live
[48:59] i want to be able to act the way i want
[49:00] to act
[49:02] but this the bride of jesus christ has
[49:05] been called to something greater
[49:07] than to be caught up in all the little
[49:09] things that are going on in this world
[49:11] it's a whirlwind brothers and sisters
[49:13] that's going on right now
[49:15] no doubt i was i talked to people at
[49:16] work in different ones
[49:18] it's like can you believe it in just a
[49:20] couple short months
[49:21] it's already going to be a year since
[49:23] all this madness began
[49:25] it was march of this year when they
[49:27] started locking everything down i told
[49:29] my wife lindsey i said i remember it's
[49:32] one of those odd things
[49:33] you know they said back you know back in
[49:35] the day they said do you remember where
[49:36] you were when jfk was assassinated
[49:38] do you remember where you were with 9
[49:39] 11. i remember exactly where i was
[49:42] when i was listening on the radio
[49:43] interested in what was going on and i
[49:45] heard
[49:46] california and locked down i was sitting
[49:48] i was in the kitchen making dinner
[49:50] cutting up some peppers or something
[49:52] like that i remember where i was
[49:54] why because the the whirlwind and the
[49:56] things that are happening
[49:58] the the world and that's it's moving
[50:01] we're living in prophetic times
[50:03] we are living in the fulfillment of the
[50:06] word of god
[50:07] in this age we're seeing these things
[50:09] come to pass
[50:10] and if we're not careful the bride has
[50:13] been called to be so much higher
[50:15] than all these little things that we so
[50:17] many times concern ourselves with
[50:20] we worry about oh what about my
[50:22] retirement plan
[50:23] oh i work people worry about well what
[50:26] about my job
[50:27] i would people worry about these things
[50:29] and those things and i think we
[50:30] ministered it before but worry is such
[50:32] an evil thing
[50:34] it's it's a virtue sucker there's no
[50:37] virtue in worry
[50:38] it's a perversion of love
[50:42] the devil tries to get people to think
[50:44] that you care by worrying
[50:46] the devil's always chirping in the ears
[50:48] of the people oh
[50:50] you don't care for that person because
[50:51] you're not worrying about them
[50:53] well it's because i do care that i don't
[50:55] have to worry because i can bring my
[50:57] prayers before a loving heavenly father
[50:59] and knows he hears my prayers he knows
[51:02] what's best for me
[51:03] he knows what's coming down the line i
[51:05] don't have to fear anything
[51:06] because you know we know what lies ahead
[51:10] for us
[51:11] we're given an expected end i don't know
[51:14] we worry so much about the in between
[51:17] all i know
[51:18] is that he that begun a good work in me
[51:20] is faithful to complete it
[51:22] and i know that the end of the work that
[51:24] he's began in me
[51:25] is a come up hither is it a moment in
[51:28] the twinkling of an eye
[51:30] how is it going to happen i don't know
[51:33] quite frankly i don't care
[51:35] as long as i'll be there and i know i'll
[51:37] be there because he promised i would be
[51:41] so we see the world so caught up in an
[51:44] idea
[51:44] everybody's fighting for their rights
[51:48] but in this day god has called a people
[51:51] to give up their rights the whole rest
[51:54] of the world is fighting
[51:56] for what's mine well this is mine i have
[51:59] a right
[52:00] to this job i have a right to this
[52:02] standard of living
[52:03] i have a right to have this and i have a
[52:05] right to have that
[52:08] left up to our own devices the only
[52:10] right that the p that a man has
[52:12] is a one-way ticket to hell because they
[52:16] came into this world speaking lies
[52:18] born and shaped in iniquity and without
[52:21] the grace of the lord jesus christ
[52:23] to cleanse us from unrighteousness
[52:26] that's the only right that you have in
[52:28] the natural
[52:30] everybody wants to fight for those
[52:31] rights the only right i want to fight
[52:34] for
[52:36] is my right to serve my god and i'm not
[52:39] going to even fight for it necessarily
[52:41] naturally
[52:42] i'm looking because i i'm above we are
[52:45] above those things brothers and sisters
[52:47] these if we're looking at we're looking
[52:49] for a city whose builder and maker is
[52:51] gone
[52:53] we're not looking to live up for
[52:55] ourselves treasure here
[52:57] we're not looking to build a kingdom on
[52:59] this side
[53:01] but i want to be a prisoner
[53:04] of jesus christ i really started
[53:07] thinking about this idea of a prisoner
[53:09] what is
[53:10] what is a prisoner and i started going
[53:13] through
[53:14] and and i and i noticed when i wrote it
[53:16] down and then i went and listened
[53:18] to that message of prisoner it was like
[53:20] the lord had put me right in sync
[53:22] with what the with the holy ghost was
[53:24] speaking because the first thing i wrote
[53:26] down is
[53:26] when you go to prison what's the first
[53:28] thing that happens you are stripped
[53:31] of everything that was yours
[53:34] they take all your clothes they take all
[53:37] your possessions
[53:38] they take all of your things that would
[53:41] have identified you as you on the
[53:43] outside
[53:45] you become a prisoner
[53:49] and you're given a jumpsuit whatever it
[53:51] might be
[53:53] most of the time they're gonna cut your
[53:54] hair they're going to buzz all the hair
[53:56] off for the
[53:56] you know the guys and everything and
[53:58] they're going to what are they doing
[54:00] they're taking away that identity of who
[54:03] you are
[54:04] and they're putting you into a place
[54:06] they're stripping away everything that
[54:08] you were
[54:10] because you're a prisoner you're a
[54:13] prisoner
[54:14] they bring you in there they say get rid
[54:17] of your you got to get rid of
[54:18] everything you're wearing you got to
[54:19] take your keys out of your pocket you
[54:21] got to
[54:21] throw your wallet over here it doesn't
[54:23] matter that doesn't belong to you
[54:25] anymore
[54:25] you forfeited that right and now you're
[54:28] a prisoner
[54:29] i want you to think spiritually because
[54:32] and so many times
[54:34] brother branham said it i didn't get all
[54:35] the quotes written down but you can
[54:37] listen to it as a short message you can
[54:39] listen to it he said so
[54:40] we don't people don't want to be
[54:42] stripped
[54:44] of who they are they don't want to be
[54:47] stripped
[54:48] of their own ideas they don't want to be
[54:50] stripped
[54:51] of their own devices their own desires
[54:55] they don't we don't so many times we
[54:56] don't want to be stripped
[54:58] of our own our own wants and what we
[55:00] think that we need
[55:02] and what did it come back it circles all
[55:04] the way back to what we've been
[55:06] ministering on about those
[55:07] channels that get clogged up why because
[55:10] we clog
[55:11] it up here for a desire to hold on to
[55:14] maybe a memory of what we used to be
[55:16] we we hold on to a taste of something we
[55:19] used to like when we were in the world
[55:21] we hold on to some kind of affection
[55:24] when jesus said
[55:25] set your affections on things that are
[55:27] above
[55:28] not the things that are here in the
[55:29] world we're called to be a prisoner
[55:32] to take away that doesn't mean look
[55:35] according to the natural we're all
[55:36] different god's got a variety
[55:38] this isn't what so many people would say
[55:40] is a cult
[55:41] to to to the extent where we're all
[55:44] going to sit here and
[55:45] we're going to wear the exact same
[55:47] colors and all these different because
[55:48] we're not looking at the natural
[55:50] we're looking at the spiritual brothers
[55:52] and sisters it's a time
[55:53] for the people of god to come into
[55:55] conformance not with a man's ideas
[55:58] but to come in conformance with the word
[56:00] of god
[56:03] because the people of god are a prisoner
[56:06] to the world
[56:08] we can't do anything outside of that
[56:10] when you go into a prison
[56:12] you got bars you got walls what is that
[56:15] i'm not going to go beyond this word
[56:18] you don't have to you don't have to go
[56:20] there but in the book of numbers
[56:23] chapter 35 it talks about the cities of
[56:25] refuge
[56:26] and when a man would be guilty of an
[56:28] accidental
[56:30] manslaughter we caught it was an
[56:31] accident he didn't mean to do it
[56:33] and he goes and flees into the city he
[56:35] could be free in that city of refuge and
[56:38] safe
[56:39] as long as he remained in the city
[56:43] but if the moment he left that city
[56:46] that slayer of blood would be waiting
[56:48] for him ready to strike at any moment
[56:51] ready to kill him and take him down why
[56:54] because he said he wasn't content
[56:56] to dwell in the place that god had
[56:59] provided for him
[57:01] i wonder how many times we get
[57:03] discontented
[57:04] with what the bars that god has set up
[57:08] for us
[57:09] did we not hear the prophet saying they
[57:10] say the song says
[57:12] we let down the bars we let down the
[57:14] bars we stopped
[57:16] we stopped fighting against sin we let
[57:19] down the bars
[57:20] the sheep got out but how did the goats
[57:22] get in he said why you let down the bars
[57:25] see the world looks at you
[57:28] and thinks that you're a prisoner to
[57:30] some kind of cultish
[57:32] mental conception but they don't even
[57:34] know just like the johnny crow
[57:36] that they're the ones that could be set
[57:39] free but refuse
[57:41] to live in the liberty of jesus christ
[57:47] the rest of the world i tell you it's
[57:50] just like
[57:50] going to a zoo forgive me for using it
[57:53] this expression but it's the way
[57:54] simplest way that's the being the
[57:56] believer
[57:58] it's like having the freedom to go to
[57:59] the zoo
[58:01] and you look at the lion and you say wow
[58:04] look at that lion
[58:05] but you don't dare go in there because
[58:06] they'll kill you
[58:08] and that lion looking at you and you'd
[58:11] say oh poor lion
[58:12] he's confined to that area and it's just
[58:15] the people of the world look at you like
[58:17] the lion looking out
[58:20] and like in santa they're saying oh poor
[58:21] human they're so confined to
[58:24] to their out there whatever it is
[58:27] because they can't without a revelation
[58:30] you can't even have a concept of the
[58:32] liberty of jesus christ
[58:34] for the believer the
[58:37] freedom from sin where i don't have to
[58:40] stress
[58:41] about where i'm going i don't have to
[58:43] stress
[58:44] about what my life and we stress because
[58:47] we don't believe
[58:49] we stress because our lack of faith
[58:52] we worry because lack of love remember
[58:55] love is a perversion of worry
[59:00] you worry because love is not perfected
[59:03] yet
[59:05] because if love was perfected how could
[59:07] you worry
[59:08] god hold jesus christ holds all things
[59:11] in his hands
[59:12] we sang that song as little children
[59:14] he's got the whole world
[59:16] our faith ought to go back to that place
[59:19] where we could say he's got the whole
[59:21] world
[59:22] in his hands
[59:27] it's so it becomes such a simple thing
[59:30] that we over complicate by mental
[59:33] conceptions
[59:34] and a desire really going it has to be
[59:38] this way
[59:38] because if we avoid and forgive me for
[59:41] explaining in a natural way but this is
[59:43] how my mind works i visualize things
[59:45] i've always looked at it like the way
[59:48] god has done things it was like that we
[59:49] called it that loop right
[59:51] we're in this loop of time that broke
[59:54] out of eternity
[59:55] and we broke out in the garden of eden
[59:58] they broke out let's go downwards
[59:59] because it was a downward spiral
[1:00:01] going down towards hell and then jesus
[1:00:03] christ came and we're back on an upward
[1:00:05] spiral
[1:00:06] an upward spiral going into eternity and
[1:00:08] in order to do that
[1:00:09] we're re-treading these grounds we're
[1:00:12] fighting old deal
[1:00:13] i was talking with brother brother david
[1:00:15] in the back talking about those two
[1:00:17] hundred thousand thousand demons out of
[1:00:19] euphrates
[1:00:19] brother branham said those were ancient
[1:00:21] demons and to deluvian devils
[1:00:24] what was it we've got to come face to
[1:00:27] face
[1:00:28] with exactly what eve struck in the
[1:00:30] garden of eden
[1:00:31] only this bride will defeat it
[1:00:36] and it's not because i am anything it's
[1:00:39] not even because the bride's anything
[1:00:41] because i will keep all the praise of
[1:00:43] the lord jesus christ
[1:00:45] and it isn't even because of william
[1:00:46] branham he brought
[1:00:48] the message to show us that the truth of
[1:00:51] jesus christ in this word
[1:00:53] has already finished the work
[1:00:58] he pointed away
[1:01:03] i don't cling just to the signpost but i
[1:01:06] follow it
[1:01:07] i follow onward
[1:01:10] when he said behold the lamb of god
[1:01:13] that taketh away the sin of the world
[1:01:18] i believed it do i understand it
[1:01:21] no i don't understand all of it
[1:01:24] couldn't explain it if i could it's no
[1:01:27] longer faith
[1:01:30] if i could brother i brought believe
[1:01:31] brother matthew was preaching that very
[1:01:33] same
[1:01:33] if you could explain it it's not faith i
[1:01:35] think brother brother billy said the
[1:01:36] same thing
[1:01:37] if you could explain it see but that
[1:01:39] what is that
[1:01:40] that's that demon that's that devil it's
[1:01:43] satan himself
[1:01:44] that eve fought in the garden brother
[1:01:47] branham said
[1:01:48] i believe it was satan's eden it was
[1:01:50] satan's eating their souls that
[1:01:51] imprisoned one of those
[1:01:52] but he talked about eve he said what
[1:01:54] happened he said she lusted
[1:01:56] for knowledge and that's what the bride
[1:01:59] is struggling with right now
[1:02:01] because we're looking at ourselves and
[1:02:03] we see failure
[1:02:04] we're looking at our churches and we see
[1:02:06] failure
[1:02:07] we're looking at our own lives we're
[1:02:09] looking at our families and we're seeing
[1:02:11] destruction
[1:02:12] we're seeing devastation we're seeing
[1:02:14] failure
[1:02:15] we're seeing no way out and the devil's
[1:02:18] whispering
[1:02:18] how's it going to happen he said it
[1:02:21] would but how
[1:02:22] he said it would but you got to
[1:02:24] understand how it's going to happen
[1:02:26] i don't got to understand anything
[1:02:28] except he
[1:02:29] said it would happen
[1:02:33] abraham and sarah didn't have to
[1:02:35] understand one bit
[1:02:37] except he promised a son
[1:02:40] through sarah and he promised
[1:02:44] a son jesus christ to be part of this
[1:02:46] bride
[1:02:47] in this hour
[1:02:50] so quit trying to figure it out
[1:02:56] i believe paul said or peter talking
[1:02:59] about those things he said
[1:03:00] and paul i think it was peter because
[1:03:02] he's talking about paul
[1:03:03] he said these things have been spoken
[1:03:05] hard to be understood
[1:03:07] he said and they that wrestle with
[1:03:08] wrestle it to their own destruction
[1:03:12] try to figure it out
[1:03:16] try to try to understand it all that is
[1:03:18] a look
[1:03:19] i have no problem with understanding the
[1:03:20] scripture says get to the understanding
[1:03:23] we want understanding we want spiritual
[1:03:25] understanding
[1:03:27] we want supernatural understanding
[1:03:33] you're telling me that that there were
[1:03:36] disciples
[1:03:37] who saw this crazy man on the on the
[1:03:40] on the bank of the river jordan
[1:03:42] screaming out to another man who was
[1:03:44] supposedly illegitimately born
[1:03:46] behold the lamb of god and he's the only
[1:03:49] one that saw the dove
[1:03:52] he's the only one that saw it
[1:03:56] and we're talking about angels and
[1:03:58] pillars of fire and cloud that was for
[1:03:59] him anyway for the most part
[1:04:01] i i was te and forgive me for even
[1:04:03] saying it this way
[1:04:05] i am grateful for the ministry of
[1:04:06] brother branham and the miracles and
[1:04:08] those things i believe all of them
[1:04:10] i believe it but i didn't live back then
[1:04:14] i have believed and yet not seen
[1:04:17] so there's a greater blessing first of
[1:04:20] all
[1:04:21] that was a condemnation to that
[1:04:23] generation
[1:04:24] because it was right in front of them
[1:04:26] could you imagine if it was right in
[1:04:27] front of them now
[1:04:29] i mean they already think you're nuts
[1:04:30] it's okay but that was for
[1:04:32] that was for that i believe it but
[1:04:35] there's a reason why we don't get
[1:04:36] videotapes to see all the miracles
[1:04:39] because i was called to believe the word
[1:04:44] i believe the miracles absolutely
[1:04:48] but i don't believe this message because
[1:04:50] of anything else other than the word of
[1:04:51] god that was quicken in my heart
[1:04:55] and that's all i'm going to say on that
[1:04:56] matter only because i
[1:04:59] i'm that's not my that's not my
[1:05:00] intention i just know that
[1:05:02] it's by faith it's not by sight
[1:05:10] praise the lord
[1:05:13] he the lord wants a bride
[1:05:16] that is completely surrendered
[1:05:20] given up all the rights remember that
[1:05:22] brother brandon always typed that land
[1:05:23] that lamb just gives up its rights
[1:05:25] it just gives just it can't do anything
[1:05:28] else
[1:05:29] oh you're just uh you're just a dumb
[1:05:32] message believer
[1:05:33] person thing whatever they want that's
[1:05:35] great that's fine
[1:05:36] i don't want to be smart anyway because
[1:05:39] not many wives
[1:05:41] not many powerful not many wealthy
[1:05:44] according to the flesh are called
[1:05:46] so i don't mind being in the group that
[1:05:49] that's a little simpler
[1:05:51] that can that can have the faith of a
[1:05:52] child and say you know what
[1:05:54] i don't understand all the other stuff
[1:05:56] but i believe the word of god
[1:05:58] can i explain it no you know what a
[1:06:01] theologian probably wrapped me in knots
[1:06:02] about certain things
[1:06:03] you know what and and you know what that
[1:06:06] why would that move me
[1:06:09] god doesn't play for anybody oh well the
[1:06:12] lord surely would come down and give
[1:06:13] give you what you need to say to tie
[1:06:15] that guy in a knot well not necessarily
[1:06:18] i mean just might not be the hour
[1:06:21] who are you who are you to judge how
[1:06:24] many times
[1:06:25] how many times have all of us wanted to
[1:06:27] be able to stand up
[1:06:28] and see the power of god come down to
[1:06:31] prove somebody
[1:06:32] wrong and not for our even our own
[1:06:33] selfish desires but just because we're
[1:06:35] tired of seeing our lord jesus
[1:06:37] trodden under feet and say lord how we
[1:06:40] wish
[1:06:41] sometimes i wish i could say lord
[1:06:44] something you know you would will it
[1:06:47] to happen because our desire
[1:06:50] is to uplift jesus christ and to show he
[1:06:53] is alive
[1:06:55] but it wouldn't work anyway because if
[1:06:58] they're not called to believe
[1:07:00] they won't we're in a gleaming time
[1:07:03] brothers and sisters
[1:07:04] we are in a gleaning time few and far
[1:07:07] between
[1:07:09] and it's only preparing us for preaching
[1:07:10] to the lost you think it's bad now when
[1:07:13] witness witness witness witness and one
[1:07:15] comes in every 10 years
[1:07:17] wait till you know that everything's
[1:07:19] done and everyone you witness to
[1:07:21] can't take it i'll take divine love then
[1:07:25] it'll take absolute divine love but
[1:07:28] people don't want to be stripped
[1:07:29] when they go into this prison of
[1:07:31] everything that they are
[1:07:33] it's the only way to come into christ
[1:07:35] paul said i had to forget everything i
[1:07:37] knew
[1:07:38] everything that i was i count is dumb
[1:07:41] garbage trash
[1:07:44] that i might win christ
[1:07:48] and so many times we're holding on to
[1:07:49] little things here little things there
[1:07:51] little things here little things there
[1:07:52] when it's time to examine ourselves and
[1:07:55] realize
[1:07:56] this is this is the hour this is a
[1:07:59] gethsemane time
[1:08:00] this is a try this is a pressing time
[1:08:03] our sins we want our sins to go before
[1:08:06] throw them out there
[1:08:08] lord i you know i tell you what i listen
[1:08:10] my uh
[1:08:11] lindsay and i listen to this audiobook
[1:08:13] that a brother told me from ohio on uh
[1:08:16] charles chinoquie called 50 years in the
[1:08:18] church of rome
[1:08:19] if you never heard of it i would suggest
[1:08:22] listening to it because i tell you what
[1:08:23] is an eye-opener
[1:08:25] to show on just the you see
[1:08:28] the perversion the lord allowed a man to
[1:08:31] literally stay in that church for 50
[1:08:33] years from the time he was a child
[1:08:35] a priest for like 25 or 26 years and
[1:08:39] always had a poll that the word that's
[1:08:41] what so encouraged me is this man lived
[1:08:43] in the time of wesley the wesleyan age
[1:08:45] but there was something burning in his
[1:08:47] heart
[1:08:48] that it was the word of god he said he
[1:08:50] would always look around throughout the
[1:08:52] entire book
[1:08:53] it would always come down to why do i
[1:08:55] see these things in the word
[1:08:57] and yet this church is pressing so hard
[1:08:59] against it
[1:09:00] he said should we not cherish the word
[1:09:02] of god to see that same
[1:09:04] spirit in someone that many hundred a
[1:09:06] hundred something years ago
[1:09:08] it's so encouraging but the lord
[1:09:11] delivered him from that
[1:09:12] and what happened he became a prisoner
[1:09:15] of not a church
[1:09:16] but of jesus christ and that's what we
[1:09:19] have
[1:09:20] a lot of is we have so many prisoners
[1:09:23] to other things other than jesus christ
[1:09:27] you know and it's only natural you know
[1:09:30] anybody that would amount
[1:09:32] to anything in something that they love
[1:09:35] has to become a prisoner to it you think
[1:09:38] lebron james
[1:09:40] you know what great is one of the
[1:09:41] greatest basketball players ever
[1:09:43] grew up basketball in his hand all the
[1:09:44] time what was he he's a prisoner
[1:09:47] to the game of basketball he you know
[1:09:49] why
[1:09:50] you know what he does with the game of
[1:09:51] basketball
[1:09:53] he wakes up and he thinks about
[1:09:55] basketball
[1:09:56] then he goes and does a practice about
[1:09:58] basketball
[1:10:00] he eats meals specifically designed to
[1:10:03] help him to play basketball
[1:10:06] he trains in such a way specifically
[1:10:10] for the game of basketball then he goes
[1:10:12] to film study sessions
[1:10:14] to understand better the game of
[1:10:16] basketball
[1:10:18] that's just a natural thing even paul
[1:10:20] said
[1:10:21] does not if you strive for the masteries
[1:10:24] in timothy he said he said no man
[1:10:27] entangleth that's called to be a soldier
[1:10:29] entangles himself
[1:10:30] with the affairs of the world so that he
[1:10:33] can please him
[1:10:34] who has called him to be a soldier and i
[1:10:37] look at someone like a lebron james or
[1:10:39] all these different great what the world
[1:10:41] would call great people
[1:10:42] and they're great at what they do no
[1:10:44] doubt and what is it
[1:10:46] they've they've forsaken all the other
[1:10:49] things
[1:10:50] while the rest of the you know you think
[1:10:52] about i remember because lebron james is
[1:10:54] almost exactly like my age i think
[1:10:56] born like a year or two later or
[1:10:58] something so when i was just coming out
[1:11:00] of high school i think he was like a
[1:11:01] year or two behind because he came out
[1:11:02] right after that
[1:11:04] and he was right down the road like
[1:11:05] three hours away in akron ohio and i
[1:11:07] thought
[1:11:07] now i look back i think that guy was in
[1:11:10] high school
[1:11:12] and he was so committed to what he was
[1:11:14] doing he was such a prisoner
[1:11:16] to the idea of being the best basketball
[1:11:18] player
[1:11:19] that his entire life revolved
[1:11:23] around that one goal when he was in high
[1:11:26] school
[1:11:27] when i was in high school i was just
[1:11:28] wanting to be done
[1:11:31] this guy was so focused but you see what
[1:11:34] it will produce
[1:11:35] when someone will sell out everything
[1:11:39] they got
[1:11:40] and put their entire life around it so
[1:11:43] what happens when you go into a prison
[1:11:45] what happens they take everything away
[1:11:46] from you
[1:11:47] and then what starts happening you get
[1:11:49] the standard issue
[1:11:51] prison garment then
[1:11:54] what do you do you eat the same meals
[1:11:57] you all get the same food
[1:12:01] you all live in the same place you dwell
[1:12:04] in the same place
[1:12:07] oh i love it kind of sounds almost like
[1:12:08] a wedding supper doesn't it
[1:12:10] but see the world looks at you like
[1:12:12] you're crazy
[1:12:13] like the lion looking out feeling sorry
[1:12:15] for the human
[1:12:17] see because we have to go beyond what a
[1:12:19] natural prison is
[1:12:22] see we may the world looks at us like
[1:12:24] we're in this confined little space
[1:12:26] according to the flesh and we are
[1:12:28] because i want to confine this flesh to
[1:12:30] a box six feet underground every day
[1:12:33] right dying to this flesh every day
[1:12:37] i want to be confined according to the
[1:12:39] flesh
[1:12:40] every day for the lord jesus i want to
[1:12:43] sell all that stuff out
[1:12:44] because it profits nothing and i want to
[1:12:47] be sold out in the spirit
[1:12:52] what are they doing they're all eating
[1:12:53] the same food
[1:12:55] they're all wearing the same thing and i
[1:12:59] like this too
[1:13:00] i said they got they have guards
[1:13:03] they have wardens the scripture might
[1:13:05] call them watchmen
[1:13:07] upon the towers always just call them
[1:13:10] out
[1:13:10] if they start to wander outside the
[1:13:13] outside the gates and try to get out and
[1:13:15] make it make an escape the watchman's
[1:13:17] right there get back in
[1:13:19] get back in line
[1:13:24] but we one thing they're always looking
[1:13:25] for that holy ghost is always going
[1:13:28] through looking for is a contraband
[1:13:30] in the prison kind of like aiken
[1:13:34] took a babylonious garment little gold
[1:13:36] wedge
[1:13:37] maybe you're holding on to that little
[1:13:39] that little uh animosity that you had
[1:13:41] for someone over there
[1:13:43] maybe you're holding on to these little
[1:13:44] i know brother matthew's been preaching
[1:13:46] on it a lot and it's sure enough the
[1:13:47] truth
[1:13:47] about those cell phones and the games
[1:13:49] and all the little things that seem okay
[1:13:53] and then they just it becomes more and
[1:13:55] more it's a little fox
[1:13:57] and it's gonna spoil the vine it's the
[1:13:59] world that we live in
[1:14:00] you might as well get used to it i was
[1:14:02] discussing it with uh with a guy i
[1:14:04] worked a midnight shift last night
[1:14:05] actually i worked
[1:14:06] until about 6 30 in the morning this
[1:14:08] morning and i was talking with him we
[1:14:10] were just kind of got a discussion about
[1:14:12] having children because he's been he
[1:14:13] just got married a few months ago and
[1:14:15] we were talking about that i said you
[1:14:16] know i i'd have a hard time
[1:14:18] even giving my children a cell phone
[1:14:22] and i was trying to think of an age and
[1:14:23] i was like ever
[1:14:26] i i i just i and he looked at me like
[1:14:30] i was like i was like really think about
[1:14:31] it i told i said i grew up
[1:14:34] and it's really to the young people
[1:14:36] especially because i can't even fathom i
[1:14:38] grew up in the era
[1:14:40] right when the internet was coming in i
[1:14:42] was in the
[1:14:43] weird kind of day where if you use the
[1:14:45] internet the phone didn't work anymore
[1:14:48] and the evil that was accessible then
[1:14:51] and now they put it
[1:14:53] right at your fingertips a hundred
[1:14:56] hundred thousand times more powerful
[1:14:59] than what sent people to the moon
[1:15:01] in the fingertips can access information
[1:15:04] from
[1:15:05] anywhere it is literally a tree of
[1:15:08] knowledge of good and evil
[1:15:10] in the palm of your hand and
[1:15:13] people think that it's not dangerous
[1:15:16] it's you ever heard the story of the
[1:15:19] they say it's like the little old wives
[1:15:20] tale
[1:15:21] of the frozen serpent the woman that
[1:15:24] found the serpent
[1:15:25] and it was frozen and she picked it up
[1:15:28] and she said oh poor serpent you're
[1:15:29] frozen
[1:15:30] and he says please help me so she holds
[1:15:32] it to her bosom
[1:15:33] and starts warming and says i'll help
[1:15:35] you because i care about nature i want
[1:15:37] to help
[1:15:39] so then she's warming up the serpent she
[1:15:41] goes home
[1:15:43] and the serpent bites her after it wakes
[1:15:45] up out of this little
[1:15:47] frozen thing and she looks at the
[1:15:48] serpent says why'd you bite me
[1:15:50] he looks at her like are you crazy you
[1:15:53] knew i was a serpent when you picked me
[1:15:55] up
[1:15:56] that's my nature and we walk around
[1:16:00] and we understand these things we've
[1:16:03] been preaching i've heard brother david
[1:16:04] preach and i've heard brother matthew
[1:16:06] brother billy and everybody else
[1:16:08] we know the nature of the tree of
[1:16:10] knowledge of good and evil
[1:16:11] and yet we invite it into our lives and
[1:16:14] then we wonder why we get bitten
[1:16:19] did not the lord say if your eye offend
[1:16:21] you pluck it out
[1:16:24] if your hand offends you cut it off
[1:16:28] i think we got to do a lot more cutting
[1:16:29] and plucking
[1:16:31] you yeah you say you look crazy you know
[1:16:33] i would rather look crazy
[1:16:35] trying to invite the lord into my life
[1:16:37] and not have any obstacles there
[1:16:40] because then he say would it not be
[1:16:42] better for you to go into glory
[1:16:44] halt or lame or blind than to enter
[1:16:47] fully into the into hell so which is
[1:16:50] better
[1:16:52] i'll leave the question to you we've got
[1:16:54] to start cutting brothers and sisters
[1:16:56] we've got to start if we want to see the
[1:16:57] spirit of god manifested in our lives
[1:17:00] we got to start cutting i think about
[1:17:02] joshua joshua lost
[1:17:03] one battle and he called a halt to
[1:17:06] everything
[1:17:07] and he said hold up a second my god
[1:17:09] doesn't lose
[1:17:10] and if you lose it if we lose it has
[1:17:13] nothing to do with him because he's
[1:17:14] perfect
[1:17:15] he never lost a battle so if we're
[1:17:17] losing somewhere
[1:17:19] there's something wrong here it's me oh
[1:17:22] lord it's me o lord standing in the need
[1:17:24] of prayer
[1:17:24] that doesn't mean we start cold pointing
[1:17:26] fingers because what's the next verse in
[1:17:27] the song
[1:17:28] not my brother not my sister but it's me
[1:17:30] oh lord
[1:17:31] standing in the need of prayer see it
[1:17:33] sounds simple
[1:17:34] sounds childish but if we don't have the
[1:17:35] faith of a child
[1:17:37] that's how we're going to enter in how
[1:17:39] do you think brother branham did it
[1:17:42] it looked insane to get off that plane
[1:17:43] in memphis and just started walking
[1:17:45] looked crazy you're going to miss your
[1:17:47] plane well the lord told me
[1:17:49] i just he had that child-like faith
[1:17:52] he had a child-like attitude when it
[1:17:54] came to the things of god
[1:17:55] why because he trusted him he'd been
[1:17:58] through the ringer
[1:18:00] we're all going through the ringer and
[1:18:02] we're going to come out like gold
[1:18:05] because you are gold you just don't know
[1:18:07] it yet
[1:18:08] it's there you're a gold nugget that the
[1:18:11] lord's just polishing
[1:18:13] he's just polishing sometimes he's got
[1:18:15] to take the hammer sometimes he's got to
[1:18:17] take the heat
[1:18:17] sometimes he's got to take the sandpaper
[1:18:19] sometimes it's rough
[1:18:21] sometimes it's smooth but he's just
[1:18:23] polishing that nugget
[1:18:25] getting ready to put it in the treasury
[1:18:27] and you got a nugget
[1:18:29] you will be here if that wasn't there
[1:18:33] but he's calling it right now i don't
[1:18:35] want to keep us too much longer
[1:18:37] but you know we've got to be into a
[1:18:40] place
[1:18:42] you know i i guess just we'll just tie
[1:18:44] it in here and we'll just close with
[1:18:45] this
[1:18:46] because i don't want to keep us late
[1:18:49] that verse in in corinthians paul says
[1:18:54] the the man that is unmarried careth for
[1:18:56] the things of the lord how
[1:18:57] he please the lord he that is married
[1:18:59] careth for the things of the world how
[1:19:01] he pleases his wife
[1:19:02] now i want you to take that anti-type to
[1:19:04] the spiritual
[1:19:07] because so many times we find ourselves
[1:19:10] caring about the things of the world
[1:19:12] when we ought to be married to christ
[1:19:15] and caring about the things that would
[1:19:17] please him
[1:19:19] see paul's talking about the natural but
[1:19:22] we can take that into the spiritual
[1:19:24] could we not say he that is married to
[1:19:26] christ
[1:19:28] careth not for the things of the world
[1:19:29] but how he may please the lord jesus
[1:19:32] but he that isn't married he may they
[1:19:34] may care a little bit more for the
[1:19:35] things of the world
[1:19:36] how many how many they might get their
[1:19:38] career a little bit better
[1:19:40] how might they get a little better
[1:19:41] standing at their job how how might they
[1:19:44] look better to the people that they're
[1:19:45] around every day
[1:19:46] how they maybe they'll move up in the
[1:19:47] church oh i want to do this or i want to
[1:19:49] do that looking to the natural things
[1:19:51] maybe maybe we got to be more married to
[1:19:54] christ
[1:19:55] and and i i really enjoyed how brother
[1:19:57] billy put it on sunday
[1:19:58] how if we're married to christ like that
[1:20:00] let's be like the woman at simon's house
[1:20:03] and concern ourselves with the things
[1:20:05] that would please our lord
[1:20:07] washing his feet worship prayer
[1:20:11] all these things that the world would
[1:20:13] look at you and say you're crazy
[1:20:15] yeah but you don't see i'm married i'm
[1:20:17] married to him
[1:20:18] so i don't concern myself with the
[1:20:20] things of the world anymore
[1:20:22] i concern myself with how i may please
[1:20:24] my husband
[1:20:26] and my husband isn't a natural husband
[1:20:28] he's a spiritual husband
[1:20:30] the scripture says that the government
[1:20:34] when it's speaking of christ in the old
[1:20:35] testament says the government would be
[1:20:37] upon his shoulders
[1:20:38] you know that comes from the old jewish
[1:20:39] marriage where when they would be
[1:20:41] married
[1:20:42] the woman would take off her veil and
[1:20:44] wrap it around the shoulders of the man
[1:20:46] and what was it it was indicating she
[1:20:48] has given headship
[1:20:51] unto her husband and she is coming
[1:20:54] underneath that headship that's what
[1:20:56] christ wants from us
[1:20:59] to be underneath the headship of jesus
[1:21:02] christ who is the word
[1:21:05] the world looks at you like you're crazy
[1:21:07] but but paul
[1:21:08] said i'm a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:21:12] and when he would want to do things he
[1:21:14] said we
[1:21:15] we wanted to go into this place but the
[1:21:17] spirit did not suffer us
[1:21:20] so i didn't go he didn't do a balaam
[1:21:23] and kept going lord can i please go lord
[1:21:26] can i please go lord can i please go
[1:21:30] we saw what would happen brother branham
[1:21:33] even showed us what would happen in
[1:21:34] africa
[1:21:36] we said lord can i go he said yeah you
[1:21:37] can go but you're going to suffer
[1:21:40] i'm you know i'm great and we've we
[1:21:42] could be a witness to that how many of
[1:21:44] you have suffered
[1:21:45] maybe for pushing against the door a few
[1:21:46] too many times and the lord was trying
[1:21:48] to hold it closed
[1:21:49] and he said lord i really want to go
[1:21:51] through the door and you would fall
[1:21:53] right off the ledge the lord said i told
[1:21:54] you
[1:21:55] not to go through the door see
[1:21:58] it's it seems simple but it's the
[1:22:01] hardest thing
[1:22:03] because what is it it's dying to this
[1:22:05] flesh
[1:22:06] it's putting this flesh see you got to
[1:22:09] put the flesh in the prison box
[1:22:12] put it under the ground so that your
[1:22:14] soul
[1:22:15] can live in liberty to jesus christ
[1:22:18] and that's the only way your greatest
[1:22:21] enemy is yourself
[1:22:22] so lock them in a prison there's you're
[1:22:25] gonna be a prisoner no matter what
[1:22:27] let's turn to the book of romans chapter
[1:22:31] oh i didn't write down i'll find it
[1:22:50] uh
[1:22:53] i i i i'm not very good at remembering
[1:22:55] chapters and i only wrote down the
[1:22:56] verses
[1:22:59] so uh if any of you find it before me it
[1:23:01] would be the scripture where he speaks
[1:23:03] of
[1:23:04] not being uh you'll be servants to them
[1:23:06] who
[1:23:07] you yield yourselves to obey and i
[1:23:10] i'm not very good with remembering
[1:23:12] chapters i remember verse is okay but
[1:23:14] forgive me
[1:23:18] six
[1:23:23] praise the lord thank you thanks so
[1:23:25] thank the lord so we'll just read verse
[1:23:26] 12 through 23 i want you to listen to
[1:23:28] this
[1:23:31] we'll start at verse 11. likewise reckon
[1:23:34] ye you also yourselves to be
[1:23:36] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god
[1:23:40] through jesus christ our lord
[1:23:42] let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:23:45] mortal body
[1:23:46] that ye should obey it and listen to the
[1:23:49] words he's using
[1:23:51] that you should obey it in the luster of
[1:23:53] what what did james say he said every
[1:23:55] man is tempted when he's drawn away of
[1:23:56] his own lusts
[1:23:59] and many times we don't want to look
[1:24:00] that in the mirror and realize
[1:24:02] that when there's something pulling it's
[1:24:05] expressing
[1:24:06] the lord's using it as an opportunity to
[1:24:08] expose the devil
[1:24:11] when you look into the mirror of the
[1:24:12] word and you
[1:24:14] see something that isn't right the lord
[1:24:18] is giving you an opportunity to expose
[1:24:21] that devil
[1:24:22] and lay the axe to the root so
[1:24:25] we get so worried or we get so we get so
[1:24:28] prideful i guess maybe the word or
[1:24:30] we just want to be willfully ignorant oh
[1:24:33] well i'm okay this and that well i'm
[1:24:35] just chosen yeah you are chosen
[1:24:37] i believe that but we've got to get down
[1:24:39] to a point of reality
[1:24:41] of lord if there's something wrong is
[1:24:44] this pulling me
[1:24:45] i see this thing pulling
[1:24:48] because i can't the lord doesn't tempt
[1:24:50] you he's not putting that there
[1:24:53] that's the devil so especially you young
[1:24:57] people
[1:24:57] are going through changing to life and
[1:24:59] different things in the world that we're
[1:25:01] in that i couldn't even fathom now
[1:25:04] when you see things pulling recognize
[1:25:07] that the lord
[1:25:08] is giving you an opportunity to expose
[1:25:11] the devil
[1:25:12] because the devil he's not good at
[1:25:14] hiding
[1:25:15] when when you start shining the light of
[1:25:17] the word oh that devil can't hide
[1:25:20] he can't hide when you're honest with
[1:25:22] yourself he can't hide
[1:25:25] he's going to try but brother the reason
[1:25:27] brother branham preached that message
[1:25:29] door
[1:25:29] door and the door door to the heart
[1:25:32] all these little doors this time you
[1:25:34] know what it's time for a spring
[1:25:35] cleaning
[1:25:36] time to go through start flinging open
[1:25:38] the door say lord clean it all out
[1:25:41] he says he says verse 13 neither
[1:25:44] yield ye your members as instruments of
[1:25:46] unrighteousness unto sin
[1:25:48] but yield yourselves unto god as those
[1:25:51] that are alive from the dead
[1:25:53] and your members as instruments of
[1:25:55] righteousness unto god
[1:25:56] amen amen i want you to understand this
[1:25:59] do you hear any words of god just
[1:26:02] shoving you forward no he's saying yield
[1:26:04] yourself
[1:26:06] it is it's a free moral agency
[1:26:09] you've got to be willing to place it out
[1:26:11] there
[1:26:12] the lord will help you but you've got to
[1:26:14] be willing to put it on the altar
[1:26:16] and say lord take this from me lord i'm
[1:26:20] struggling
[1:26:21] with this i'm struggling with with uh
[1:26:23] with drunkenness or
[1:26:25] i'm struggling with with cigarettes or
[1:26:27] whatever it might be or gambling all
[1:26:29] these things that we talk about
[1:26:30] lust or all the things in the world that
[1:26:32] are out there today
[1:26:33] put it on the altar call of sin out
[1:26:38] and say lord i want to yield myself as
[1:26:41] an instrument of righteousness
[1:26:43] i want to come underneath your headship
[1:26:45] i want to come underneath this word
[1:26:50] he said for sin shall not have dominion
[1:26:53] over you
[1:26:55] yes sir that's a promise right there
[1:26:59] sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:27:02] i don't know if you listen to the
[1:27:03] election stuff i've listened to some of
[1:27:05] you here they talk about the dominion
[1:27:06] election systems
[1:27:07] there's a reason why these words get
[1:27:09] thrown out there because we're seeing
[1:27:11] what's happening in this world i'm just
[1:27:14] telling you
[1:27:15] i'm looking at it spiritually naturally
[1:27:18] the lord sets up kings he taketh down
[1:27:20] kings
[1:27:20] he does what he will you go through the
[1:27:22] old testament and see how the lord will
[1:27:24] raise up a righteous one raise up an
[1:27:26] evil one raise up a righteous one raise
[1:27:28] up and eat why
[1:27:28] he's got his purpose i don't i don't
[1:27:31] have to worry about it the lord's got
[1:27:32] that in control he didn't
[1:27:34] thank the lord he didn't call me to be a
[1:27:35] politician or something like that
[1:27:38] i always heard a joke i shouldn't joke
[1:27:40] but they said politicians you know a
[1:27:42] math
[1:27:42] poly a polygon poly means many and ticks
[1:27:44] are blood sucking little creatures
[1:27:46] politics lots of little blood sucking
[1:27:49] little creatures
[1:27:50] you got to be careful so for sin
[1:27:53] shall not have dominion over you
[1:27:56] for ye are not under the law but under
[1:27:59] grace so praise the lord for grace
[1:28:01] thank the lord for a capstone that came
[1:28:04] with a double portion
[1:28:05] crying grace grace i'm in need of a
[1:28:08] double portion brothers and sisters
[1:28:10] because the scripture says with much
[1:28:11] knowledge comes much sorrow and you know
[1:28:14] what when that gospel light
[1:28:16] of this word that we received in this
[1:28:17] day came shining down
[1:28:19] and even to this day shines down in my
[1:28:21] life you see just how short you come
[1:28:23] every day every day
[1:28:28] thank the lord for a double portion of
[1:28:29] grace because i need it
[1:28:31] if you don't need it i'll take your
[1:28:33] portion that's all right because i know
[1:28:35] i need it
[1:28:37] said what then shall we sin because we
[1:28:39] are under the law but under grace god
[1:28:41] forbid
[1:28:42] no ye not now listen that to whom you
[1:28:45] yield yourself servants to obey his
[1:28:48] servants
[1:28:49] ye are to whom you obey so
[1:28:52] you're gonna be a servant to something
[1:28:55] that's the kind of the crux of the whole
[1:28:57] matter this evening if i could boil it
[1:28:58] down
[1:28:58] because what do we say in the beginning
[1:29:00] all the sides in the natural are crying
[1:29:02] out people's rights
[1:29:04] i want a right to do this i want a right
[1:29:06] to do that i have this right
[1:29:08] i have that right they don't even
[1:29:10] realize
[1:29:11] that they're all serving something
[1:29:15] every single one of them everybody oh i
[1:29:17] was i was free
[1:29:19] i would i am free man i have this
[1:29:21] freedom and this and that and
[1:29:22] what what not you know paul said one
[1:29:25] time
[1:29:26] when he was taken in custody and they
[1:29:27] beat him and he said
[1:29:29] and the lord gave him wisdom and he said
[1:29:31] he said you're beating a roman
[1:29:32] and that soldier stopped he said wait a
[1:29:34] second i thought you're a jew
[1:29:36] he said no i'm a i'm a roman he said
[1:29:39] with a great price i achieved this
[1:29:40] freedom and i liked what paul said said
[1:29:42] yeah but i was freeborn
[1:29:44] i was born free yes sir i was
[1:29:47] born free in the name of jesus
[1:29:51] he christ but you're free they all think
[1:29:53] that they're free according to the flesh
[1:29:54] but yeah they may be free according to
[1:29:56] the flesh because they'll just let those
[1:29:58] lusts of the flesh do whatever they want
[1:29:59] to do
[1:30:00] but in the spiritual they're chained
[1:30:03] brother branham called them souls that
[1:30:04] are in prison now
[1:30:06] don't even know they're in prison just
[1:30:08] like the lion caged up
[1:30:09] oh poor human if only they knew how much
[1:30:12] freedom i had in this
[1:30:13] in this little cage world that i got i
[1:30:16] got to hold 30 feet to go back and forth
[1:30:19] the people come in every day and give me
[1:30:21] all the meat that i want to eat
[1:30:23] i don't have to worry about anything
[1:30:24] that's what the devil tricks the people
[1:30:25] with
[1:30:26] because those guys in the zoo they don't
[1:30:28] have to worry about nothing they're just
[1:30:30] giving everything they need
[1:30:31] they're just we're giving everything we
[1:30:33] need too the lord just lets it look a
[1:30:35] little bit lumpier
[1:30:36] sometimes because we live by faith not
[1:30:38] by sight but they'll just live this nice
[1:30:40] easy life
[1:30:41] the lord the lord jesus said verily
[1:30:43] verily they have their reward
[1:30:45] they have their reward but we want to
[1:30:47] live in obedience
[1:30:49] to the lord jesus he says know ye not
[1:30:51] verse 16
[1:30:52] know ye not that to whom you yield
[1:30:55] yourself servants to obey
[1:30:57] his servants ye are to whom you obey
[1:30:59] whether of sin unto death
[1:31:01] or of obedience unto righteousness but
[1:31:04] god be thanked
[1:31:05] that ye were the servants of sin but ye
[1:31:09] have obeyed
[1:31:10] from the heart oh amen thank the lord
[1:31:13] for a seed that could be awoken thank
[1:31:16] the lord
[1:31:16] for a light that could shine down it
[1:31:19] only takes an instant
[1:31:21] it only takes an instant for that light
[1:31:22] to strike the seed
[1:31:24] and then no matter what is in front of
[1:31:26] that seed it's going to grow
[1:31:28] it's going to go it's got to as someone
[1:31:30] who just bought a house a few years ago
[1:31:32] i could testify and see that grass that
[1:31:34] grows up the side of the concrete
[1:31:37] it grows up there it doesn't matter just
[1:31:39] like the lily oh it just needs a little
[1:31:41] bit of light to hit the seed
[1:31:42] and that lily's going to push its way up
[1:31:44] but you bebade from the heart
[1:31:46] that form of doctrine which was
[1:31:48] delivered to you being then made free
[1:31:50] from sin
[1:31:51] you became the servants of righteousness
[1:31:54] see this is what i love
[1:31:55] it's because when you have a revelation
[1:31:57] oh well you're just you just live
[1:31:58] according to all these rules no
[1:32:01] i'm a love slave i'm bound
[1:32:04] the scripture says i i i i want to say
[1:32:07] it was hosea maybe
[1:32:08] he called it he said i drew you with
[1:32:10] bands of love
[1:32:12] i i'm i'm wrapped in bands of love
[1:32:15] that's what i want to be i'm a love
[1:32:17] slave for the lord jesus
[1:32:19] now i don't care about my own ideas you
[1:32:21] know the world makes
[1:32:23] looking at it like a marriage because we
[1:32:24] understand the world
[1:32:26] makes marriage now i remember growing up
[1:32:30] when i was watching tv when i was a
[1:32:31] child and they had all the sitcoms and
[1:32:33] all the television shows
[1:32:34] and they always made marriage look like
[1:32:37] the most burdensome
[1:32:39] horrible thing oh i gotta go
[1:32:42] what are you doing tonight jim oh i
[1:32:44] gotta go out with the wife again i gotta
[1:32:46] hang out with the family you know and
[1:32:48] everybody would laugh and it would be
[1:32:49] all hilarious
[1:32:50] and what what has it done it's sowed
[1:32:52] seeds
[1:32:53] and now we see a world that couldn't
[1:32:55] care less about family
[1:32:57] couldn't care less about raising
[1:32:59] children according to any moral compass
[1:33:02] let alone the scripture
[1:33:05] we know that's true we see the insanity
[1:33:08] in the world
[1:33:09] but they make it look so burdensome why
[1:33:11] because from the very beginning
[1:33:13] marriage was the natural pinnacle
[1:33:16] of expression of what god wanted to have
[1:33:19] as a relationship with his people
[1:33:22] and from the very beginning satan
[1:33:25] weaseled his way in there
[1:33:26] and destroyed the very first marriage
[1:33:28] and he's been working at it ever since
[1:33:30] but what is it god's called us i don't
[1:33:33] when i live with
[1:33:34] sister lindsey i when i go home i'm
[1:33:36] grateful to go home to to see my wife
[1:33:38] i'm grateful to to be able to spend time
[1:33:41] with her
[1:33:42] and and to be able to eat dinner with
[1:33:44] her and and we have coffee most every
[1:33:46] mornings and different things
[1:33:47] that's and how much more god
[1:33:50] the lord jesus wants to fellowship with
[1:33:53] his bride
[1:33:55] how much more does he want you to to
[1:33:58] love
[1:33:58] coming to the house of god to love
[1:34:01] getting in that prayer closet
[1:34:02] to love to think about him and just if
[1:34:05] we could get back
[1:34:06] to the joy of our salvation when that
[1:34:10] band a predestination was put on there
[1:34:13] and that first that betrayal of the holy
[1:34:16] ghost giving you the down payment
[1:34:18] just led you so in love with him
[1:34:21] you hear it all the time in the natural
[1:34:23] oh i wish we could get back to the
[1:34:24] honeymoon phase
[1:34:27] we can in jesus christ live in the
[1:34:30] spirit
[1:34:31] if you find the love waxing a little
[1:34:34] cold you got to stoke the fires
[1:34:38] fall in love with the lord jesus again
[1:34:41] remember how he brought you out of sin
[1:34:44] start remember if you can't even think
[1:34:45] of anything how'd that fire get lit
[1:34:48] where did you come from where are you
[1:34:50] going what is he making you
[1:34:52] don't look it right now look at what
[1:34:54] he's done for you
[1:34:56] how far he's brought you what he's
[1:34:58] delivered you from already and if he's
[1:35:00] done it before
[1:35:01] he'll do it again there's a psalm that
[1:35:03] says he'll do
[1:35:04] it again for you
[1:35:07] he'll do it again he'll do it again
[1:35:12] we've seen that song all the time that
[1:35:14] uh that i would not be denied satan said
[1:35:16] my lord was gone and would not hear my
[1:35:18] prayer
[1:35:18] see you can't take it away from me now
[1:35:20] devil praise the lord the work is done
[1:35:23] it's already done you can't take once
[1:35:26] you realize
[1:35:26] a revelation is so powerful
[1:35:30] once everything is revealed it can't be
[1:35:32] unrevealed
[1:35:34] and they it and it shows in this age
[1:35:36] because they have the saying that goes
[1:35:38] around
[1:35:38] they said once you see they have the
[1:35:40] little things that pop up say once
[1:35:42] you've seen it you can't unsee it
[1:35:45] you ever seen those little things they
[1:35:46] do little catch phrases like it'll be
[1:35:48] like
[1:35:48] maybe an optical illusion let's say once
[1:35:49] you see it you can't unsee it
[1:35:52] why it's a carnal version of a
[1:35:54] revelation
[1:35:55] because once the veil is torn between
[1:35:58] you and your god
[1:35:59] between you and your husband and you see
[1:36:02] jesus christ
[1:36:04] in you there's nothing that could take
[1:36:06] that away
[1:36:08] can't take it away you can't tell me
[1:36:11] that this bible isn't black
[1:36:14] you could come and torture me
[1:36:18] you could threaten me you could do
[1:36:20] literally everything you wanted
[1:36:24] and i may even in the natural say it's
[1:36:26] blue
[1:36:27] you know in the natural kind of i just
[1:36:29] want the pain to end whatever
[1:36:31] but a real revelation you could never
[1:36:35] they could never be anything else but
[1:36:36] black because it is what it is
[1:36:40] so is it for the bride of jesus christ
[1:36:42] it's been revealed
[1:36:43] to you and just like they proved
[1:36:46] throughout the dark ages
[1:36:47] just like they proved today no manner of
[1:36:50] of tribulation
[1:36:52] no manner of trial can wrench a
[1:36:54] revelation
[1:36:55] from the heart of a believer it cannot
[1:36:59] be done
[1:37:00] go read fox's book of martyrs a little
[1:37:02] bit and see how much it can't be done
[1:37:06] and think in the spiritual you're going
[1:37:08] through worse than that even in this day
[1:37:10] every day the devil just pounded away
[1:37:13] trying to
[1:37:13] trying to rip it away and we see the
[1:37:16] shakings going on even now
[1:37:18] but praise be to god it's anchored deep
[1:37:21] it's anchored on revelation that's why
[1:37:22] that's the rock
[1:37:24] because you can't take it away it can't
[1:37:26] be taken away
[1:37:28] being then made free from sin you became
[1:37:30] the servants of righteousness i speak
[1:37:31] after the manner of men
[1:37:33] because of the affirmative your flesh
[1:37:34] for as you have yielded your members
[1:37:36] servants to uncleanness
[1:37:38] and to iniquity unto iniquity even so
[1:37:40] now yield your members
[1:37:42] servants to righteousness and holiness
[1:37:45] for when you were the servants of sin
[1:37:47] you are free from righteousness
[1:37:50] wow that's an interesting way to put it
[1:37:53] i was free from righteousness when i was
[1:37:55] in the world that sounds like a horrible
[1:37:57] thing
[1:37:58] i was free from holiness i was you you
[1:38:01] know when you were in the world
[1:38:02] you were free from peace
[1:38:06] you were free from healing oh man
[1:38:09] wouldn't you like to be freed from
[1:38:10] healing
[1:38:11] no i want to be bound up in healing
[1:38:14] i want to be bound up in peace if that's
[1:38:17] what being a prisoner
[1:38:18] is is being at peace is being in
[1:38:21] righteousness
[1:38:22] it's being in holiness i want to be a
[1:38:24] prisoner
[1:38:25] to those things i want to be locked up
[1:38:28] in it so much that it's inseparable
[1:38:31] amen thank the lord amen
[1:38:36] but now being made free from sin and
[1:38:39] become
[1:38:39] servants to god you have your fruit unto
[1:38:42] holiness
[1:38:43] and the end everlasting life
[1:38:46] for the wages of sin is death but the
[1:38:49] gift of god is eternal life through
[1:38:51] jesus christ our lord
[1:38:53] amen let's just all stand i've always
[1:38:56] enjoyed that scripture
[1:38:59] romans 6 23 the wages of sin is death
[1:39:02] but the gift of god there's such a
[1:39:04] contrast there
[1:39:05] because what's the difference between
[1:39:07] wages and a gift you got to work for one
[1:39:09] of them
[1:39:13] thought it was a simple thing when
[1:39:14] brother branham said a man has to fight
[1:39:15] his way to hell
[1:39:17] but you have to fight the grace of god
[1:39:20] paul that's why paul would say i don't
[1:39:22] frustrate the grace of god i don't want
[1:39:24] to frustrate the grace of god
[1:39:25] i don't want to fight against these
[1:39:26] things lord help us to be
[1:39:29] submissive
[1:39:33] we're getting married the marriage
[1:39:36] supper of the lamb
[1:39:38] the marriage between the bride of jesus
[1:39:40] christ and the bridegroom
[1:39:44] we got to put the government on his
[1:39:46] shoulders for our lives
[1:39:49] we've got to become submissive to him in
[1:39:51] all things
[1:39:54] the world's gonna look at you crazy it's
[1:39:55] all right they already do
[1:39:58] you know what sometimes the people
[1:39:59] around you look crazy
[1:40:02] you know they agrippa said paul much
[1:40:03] learning doth make me mad
[1:40:05] i said no i'm not crazy i'm just a
[1:40:08] prisoner
[1:40:10] i'm just a prisoner to jesus christ i
[1:40:14] i can only speak for myself but knowing
[1:40:16] what i've been through
[1:40:18] since the lord revealed this word to me
[1:40:21] this message in the hour that we've
[1:40:23] come to receive and the the truth of the
[1:40:26] the word of god
[1:40:28] and the absolute perfection of jesus
[1:40:30] christ in his word
[1:40:33] there have been times i've tried to run
[1:40:34] away
[1:40:36] unsuccessfully because no matter where i
[1:40:39] would go
[1:40:40] there's a witness that would always cry
[1:40:43] out
[1:40:45] because it was anchored i couldn't you
[1:40:47] can't unreveal it
[1:40:49] you can't do it moses tried to run
[1:40:53] and you know he did he only ran right
[1:40:55] into the plan of god in the end
[1:40:58] he only ran right where god needed him
[1:41:00] to be at the moment
[1:41:02] that abraham he tried this and he tried
[1:41:05] that he only got himself right where he
[1:41:06] needed to be
[1:41:07] jacob tried doing this tried doing that
[1:41:10] only got himself right where he needed
[1:41:11] to be so maybe
[1:41:12] as we just don't bow our heads this
[1:41:14] evening
[1:41:16] i'm just going to raise my hands if you
[1:41:19] want to raise your hands you can just
[1:41:20] say lord i want to be a prisoner to you
[1:41:22] lord jesus
[1:41:24] maybe you've been running from the lord
[1:41:26] jesus maybe you've been
[1:41:28] maybe there's something in your heart
[1:41:29] that's crying out this word is the truth
[1:41:32] i believe it but i just i don't know if
[1:41:35] i could be a prisoner
[1:41:36] you can be a prisoner
[1:41:40] you can be a prisoner if you just lay it
[1:41:41] all down he said if you just yield
[1:41:43] yourselves remember yield your members
[1:41:45] unto him
[1:41:46] yield yourself unto the lord jesus it
[1:41:48] may not happen
[1:41:49] everything overnight the way the natural
[1:41:51] mind would see but that's where the
[1:41:52] devil would get you is trying to make
[1:41:53] you to understand it
[1:41:55] lord how is it going to work how is this
[1:41:56] going to happen but just like he told
[1:41:58] the children of israel when it came to
[1:42:00] the promised land he said little by
[1:42:01] little
[1:42:02] you'll possess the land little by little
[1:42:06] you'll take it you're going to get
[1:42:08] little by little
[1:42:09] you'll see these things fall you'll see
[1:42:11] this other thing fall
[1:42:13] maybe you've been looking at this this
[1:42:14] problem that you've had for so long
[1:42:17] and you've been so focused on that you
[1:42:18] didn't even see that the lord got rid of
[1:42:20] that temper that you used to hold on to
[1:42:23] because the devil's got you focused over
[1:42:24] here but just let the lord have his
[1:42:27] perfect work in your life
[1:42:29] i just want to raise my hand say lord i
[1:42:30] want to be a prisoner to you i want to
[1:42:32] i want to give up all of my rights lord
[1:42:35] i want to put on the wedding garment
[1:42:36] i want to eat the food that you supply
[1:42:38] me lord i want to i want to live the way
[1:42:41] you would have me to live i want to
[1:42:42] surrender myself to you let's just have
[1:42:45] a word of prayer lord jesus
[1:42:48] lord i believe the cry of everyone's
[1:42:49] heart this evening oh god is to be
[1:42:52] completely surrendered unto
[1:42:53] you lord jesus to come under the
[1:42:55] headship of our bridegroom
[1:42:57] to come under the headship of our
[1:42:58] husband lord
[1:43:00] we don't want to be carried about by the
[1:43:02] cares of the world
[1:43:03] or but we want to be married to you and
[1:43:05] only caring about the things that would
[1:43:07] please our husband
[1:43:09] lord and everything that we would say
[1:43:10] and do our attitudes the way we act and
[1:43:12] think the way we treat our brothers and
[1:43:14] sisters the way we treat those around us
[1:43:16] oh god may it be in such a way that we
[1:43:18] could say lord
[1:43:20] it was pleasing to you because i seen it
[1:43:22] in your word that
[1:43:23] you gave divine love in our hearts to
[1:43:25] love
[1:43:26] those that don't love us lord that we
[1:43:28] could love the unlovable
[1:43:30] lord because lord no doubt that
[1:43:33] sometimes we looked at ourselves and we
[1:43:34] thought we were unlovable oh god but
[1:43:36] your love came down and
[1:43:37] scooped us up out of the pit of hell and
[1:43:40] lord you've raised us
[1:43:42] into the joyous presence lord of
[1:43:45] of your son the lord jesus we just thank
[1:43:48] you o god for your grace and mercy
[1:43:50] lord if there be any barriers any
[1:43:52] hindrances i pray o god that your
[1:43:54] anointing would go and break the yoke of
[1:43:56] the enemy
[1:43:57] lord that the holy ghost would minister
[1:43:59] to your people this evening

[1:46:40] for the show
[1:46:55] amen amen story need prayer we're going
[1:46:57] to pray for our sister lord
[1:47:00] you know tonight i would just like to
[1:47:02] ask as
[1:47:04] you heard the gospel go forth and i
[1:47:07] don't think it was a gospel of
[1:47:08] condemnation at all
[1:47:10] i felt it was a gospel of invite to
[1:47:14] just come up a little higher and i'm
[1:47:17] sure that as the gospels preach certain
[1:47:20] things in your life
[1:47:22] came to mind certain things in my life
[1:47:24] came to mind that
[1:47:26] i need to work on that or i need to go
[1:47:29] do it let those things that
[1:47:31] that were quickened to you
[1:47:34] go out and bring them to pass in your
[1:47:36] life by
[1:47:38] by addressing them and and you know
[1:47:41] maybe you sat there and said
[1:47:42] you know i don't read my bible as much
[1:47:44] as i should
[1:47:45] that then then you know just don't be
[1:47:48] hearers of the word but make a positive
[1:47:51] action and you know
[1:47:54] take the seed of the word and plant it
[1:47:57] in your life
[1:47:58] and then watch the fruit of it grow and
[1:48:00] and
[1:48:02] we do it for the lord but remember he
[1:48:04] said if
[1:48:05] they'll know you are my disciples
[1:48:09] if you're loved you have one for another
[1:48:12] and and we were told that jesus would
[1:48:15] rather have us
[1:48:16] love one another then love him
[1:48:19] so remember the life that you start
[1:48:21] dedicating to christ
[1:48:23] is also for everybody in this room that
[1:48:26] all of us can move up higher
[1:48:28] and i just think it's a beautiful gospel
[1:48:30] just to dedicate our lives
[1:48:32] move up a little higher get a little bit
[1:48:35] more of the world out
[1:48:37] take it step by step and see if we can
[1:48:39] rise up
[1:48:40] and then if we do that when someone
[1:48:42] comes in our midst
[1:48:44] and has a prayer request or a need
[1:48:47] then we're ready to step up
[1:48:50] aren't we so we're going to pray brother
