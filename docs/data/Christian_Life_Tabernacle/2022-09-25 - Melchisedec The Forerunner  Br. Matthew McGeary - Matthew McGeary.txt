word oh you talk about a wonderful mystery that's been made plain to the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time when men are probing at and wondering what those seven Thunders are what the Mysteries are all about God has come down in the cool of the evening now we could have communion with them and we could have Fellowship when the whole world is in chaos there's a bride who's been gathered away from it all and the veil has dropped down behind her and she's having communion with her Lord what a privilege what a wonderful hour that we're in when people are groping in darkness and groots darkness and chaos is upon the Earth and upon the lamb we have received a message as our eyes and shine thy light has come in the evening time it shall be light Shalom good morning oh I'm excited to be living in this hour Heavenly Father our hearts Rejoice At The Mention Of Your Name at the revelation of the message of the hour that has brought us out of Darkness that has resurrected us from

that you broke to us Lord and now we come once again to the communion table Lord ask him that you break the bread of life to us as only you can Lord we love you now we commit ourselves to you Lord and ask all these things in your wonderful name the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Hallelujah my it's just good to be in his presence amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles just turn in our Bibles to Revelations chapter one just read the first six verses there Revelations 1 reads the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that is loved and washed us from our sins and his own blood my what what an amazing start and then to think the words that comes in with this great expression that we're reading this great expression of Christ and then verse 6 and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated if you can also turn over in your Bibles to Genesis chapter 14. read Verse 18 through 20. and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God now just hold that in your minds remember we've been made Kings and Priests but here in the Scripture it says the Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and he blessed and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all we know that David would also mention Melchizedek in Psalms 11 4 he would say the Lord has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek just for a title tonight by the grace of God I'd like to speak to you a little bit Melchizedek the Forerunner Melchizedek the Forerunner and notice here in the Scriptures it says he was the priest of the most high God but if you if you notice that here in the scripture when you read this here Abraham is and now this one appears unto him uh Melchizedek and he says I am the priest of the most high God this is the first time that priesthood or anything of priests is actually even mentioned in the scripture this is the first time that you would actually even see this word even used that here comes one that says that I am a priest of the the most high God and and if you look into the scriptures uh there there wasn't even anything in the scriptures pertaining to a priesthood the levitical priesthood wasn't even in order here he's appearing uh on onto Abraham and saying I'm the priest of the most high God but you know this is before the levitical law this is before there was ever an order of a priesthood and he's saying I am the priest of the most high God you know what is a priest a priest is somebody who who is authorized or somebody that is qualified to carry out the religious duties of the church he's he's able to carry out the order of the sanctuary and when you look into the the Old Testament you look at the levitical law there would be a high priest and and he was ordained and he was the one that could go in behind the veil and he could he could take the blood of the red heifer and he could sprinkle The Mercy Seat and he would sprinkle it seven times and you know representation that there would be seven Church ages in my you look and look through these things but here this priest of the most high God that appeared on Abraham he appeared before there was any institution of a law he appeared before there was any law given pertaining to a priesthood something to ponder who was this Melchizedek that appeared unto him on the plains of memory but we know that all of these orders that the priest when it was instituted under the levitical law under the aaronic law that everything that they were doing was just all in representation of one that was to come when they would they would make the sacrifice of the red heifer and they would they would take the blood and they would go back into the holiest of holies and there they would sprinkle the mercy see that was only a testimony that there was a sacrifice that was going to come and that high priest that would take that blood and go back there it was just a type and a shadow of foreshadowing that there was coming one that would lay down his own life there was coming one it was a type of our great high priest Jesus Christ who would shed his own blood for our sins and Paul would write this in Hebrews 6 verse 19. he would say which hope we have an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast in which inereth into within the veil wither the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made in high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek oh Jesus Christ the Forerunner after the order of Melchizedek has entered in within the veil for you atoning for your sins he was the first one he was the Forerunner he was the one that went in on your behalf is the prophet of God would say in Melchizedek the great Prince and King you would say whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus the Forerunner of what the Forerunner of our salvation physically and spiritually for he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the Forerunner of our Salvation has already entered in the Assurance already entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek now we're coming to where we want to get this text right quick and get into all these great promises we bottle it down to one thing that Jesus our Forerunner who was the Seed of Abraham through the Holy Spirit has called us to this blessed hope that we now have an anchor of the Soul steadfast and sure anchored within the veil this Jesus being made a forerunner who was in the order of Melchizedek my isn't that wonderful what beautiful words and I just want to maybe uh make this illumination here that in this scripture that we read it says Jesus Christ the Forerunner who has entered into the veil you know this is the only time the word Forerunner is mentioned in Scripture the only time you will read this word and if you even take it to the Greek it's the only time this word Forerunner is even stated in the scripture if you just do a search on it put in Forerunner try to do four Rand one that four run this is the word that speaks of it it's a forerunner and Jesus Christ is the Forerunner who entered in behind the veil and he was a priest made after the order of Melchizedek now I would just like to tell you a little bit about what a forerunner is maybe a definition a forerunner is one who is sent before now this this definition we're given we can see types down through the Scriptures it says a forerunner is one who is sent before to take observation or act as a spy or a scout a light armed Soldier so this this Forerunner is one who goes before you know that makes me think of Joshua and Caleb you know when they had come up to kadish barnia the prophet of God said I want you to go on over into the promised land and you know uh Joshua means Jehovah savior he says I want you to go on over into the promised land and what did Joshua and Caleb do they went on over into the promised land and they went over into the promised land as a scout as one that four ran they were a first one that was entered into that promised land with the children of Israel in the wilderness and they came back packing the goods and saying look it's a good land it's everything that God said it was the fruits of the spirit there there's rejoicing there's Victory there's healing oh it's a land flowing with milk and honey the Holy Ghost is there it's present if you want it come on over but everybody else looked at the well they would have to do they'll say you know what I would have to fight for it I would have to lay down my life for it you know I would have to go to battle I would I would have to die out to my own thinking I'd have to die out to these ways I don't think I want to do that in the people started to murmur they started to complain because the way looked too hard for them they said I know you've come back with the fruits I know you've come back and it testifies exactly what God said it was God said it was a good land God said it was flowing with milk and honey God said I give you this land and here they're presenting the fruits and say it is a good Land look what God Said here is the manifestation of it but the people didn't want to lay down their lives they didn't want to take God at their word they didn't want to fight for it oh my but there was Joshua and Caleb oh oh uh Jehovah savior will say look it's there for us it's there come on over let's go I've made a way for you I've already foreign I've already entered in I've already gone into the promised land if you'll just follow me if you'll just go with me it's a good land it's flowing with milk and honey but are you ready to die are you willing to die are you willing to lay down all of your thoughts are you willing to lay down all your thinking are you willing to get out of the way hey are you willing to let the presence of God move upon your life oh he was a forerunner that had entered in Joshua Jehovah's savior packing the evidence of a good land back showing to them that it was a good land I say Lord let's go I want to fight whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes to enter into a body change whatever it takes to Manifest this message whatever sacrifices I need to make Lord Lord I want to I want to be willing and able and ready Lord Jesus to follow you over I want to possess all things I want to enter into my inheritance are you willing to die out tonight are you willing to lay it all down and cross over into the Promised Land Hallelujah also what this would mean a forerunner it also means one who comes in advance to a place where the rest are to follow well that's enough for shouting grounds right there a forerunner is one who comes in advance to a place where the rest are to follow oh talk about this Forerunner Jesus Christ who for around he is the Waymaker he is the Trailblazer he is the Forerunner when Adam had lost everything and couldn't go back into the presence of God what did Jesus do he said I'm going to come down God said I'll take on sinful flesh and I'll be a forerunner I'll go back into the presence God where man could never come back in Fellowship again I'm going to forerun and I'm going to come back into the presence of God I'm going to manifest the word I'm going to manifest the promises I'm going to be the first one to come into that place of maturity I'm going to be that sheath wave I'm going to be the first fruits of them that slept Oh Glory to God he was a forerunner when he rose there on that third day he was the first fruits of them that's not he was the first one that rose from the dead but after that all those that slept they rose up after him in a great Resurrection he led captivity captain and he ascended on high to the right Throne of God into the presence of the heavenlies oh my what a forerunner Hallelujah Paul would say this in Hebrews chapter four we might do quite a bit of reading of scripture I'm trying to gear down a little bit my transmission might be broke though Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was all in all points tempted like we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of need Melchizedek oh who was this Melchizedek Melchizedek we know that he was the theophany of Jesus Christ it was a word body a prophet of God would say a theophany is something that you cannot see he would say you would point it out you know you think about this one that appeared on the plains of mammary this one that appeared to Abraham the prophet of God said that that was actually the theophany of Jesus Christ that appeared oh my where does that put us at it was the theophany of Jesus Christ that appeared unto Abraham but he said you see a theophany is something that you can't see it's just like TV it's just like radio waves that are going through here but but you see you can't you can't see it you can't pick it up the prophet of God would say this he would say he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he and more face himself into his servants and proves himself now here he is in the form of a spirit and then he comes in the form of amorphy now he appeared to Abraham in morphe when Abraham was returning from the slaughter of Kings here come Melchizedek and talk to him so this theophany of Jesus Christ was formed into an image where Abraham could see him where Abraham could have fellowship with him where Abraham could have communion into this theophany of Jesus Christ formed himself down into a body and he appeared unto Abraham who is this Melchizedek who is this one that appeared down to Abraham on the pla in the place of Mayor who is this one that appeared to Abraham after the slaughter of the Kings and he served him communion and what did he do he blessed them after the slaughter of the Kings there and our text here come melchized at king of Salem which would later become Jerusalem they would say here here come a Melchizedek and he served him Bread and Wine he served him communion and the prophet would say now after the battle was over Melchizedek served as Victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here in type here in view the communion so think of this now here here here we see one appear unto Abraham who's a high priest after the most high God there's not even a word in the Bible there's not even anything to show Abraham a pattern of it but here's this high priest appearing here's this High preserving communion communions not it's not you look in for Bread and Wine and communion Abraham has nothing there there's nothing communion isn't going to be instituted for another 2 000 years right after the battle he gave himself because he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ so I just want to read that again in type here and view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of Christ become part of this being you get it Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him that's right battled for life battled for life and after the battle is over then God gives you of himself that is his true communion this little bread wafer just represented you shouldn't take it lest you've wrestled it out and become part of God how we could preach on that for a little bit but it's a battle for life where you get so desperate my we've been fellowshipping around the token if you notice brother Brandon preaches there I believe in September he preaches the token but what does he preach in the evening time he preaches desperation because if you want the token you better get desperate it's one thing to walk around and say oh this is the token the token the Holy Ghost the token is the token life the token is the message I believe the message but oh have you ever came down to a battle for life because if you have it you're going to come to a battle for life at some point the devil will come upon you life situations will come upon you something will work upon you in such a way where you come to a place of desperation he said I'm tired of being the way that I am I want to live an overcoming life and you look into the word and you see the promises of the word God gave Abraham a promise and according to that promise he knew he could go to battle and there's a group of people that are gathered together in the house of God that have received a promise and you can go to battle I don't care if you got him to get into desperation I don't care what it takes if you got to get on your knees if you got to come to the altar I'll tell you what I don't want to wait till I'm on a hospital bed I don't want to wait till it's a life or death situation and the blood is eeking out of my body that I finally realized you know what God I think I'll finally get down to a battle for life I say oh God let me get down to business now let me get into desperation now Lord let me make my calling and my election sure tonight Lord I want to battle it out right now Lord I want to have communion with you I want to receive a part of yourself he served Abraham Bread and Wine now just think of these patterns in this order that is being shown here to Abraham when none of these things have even been patterned or shown in the scripture there's no high priest there's no priest there's no religious duties to even carry out there is no communion so here's this one appearing unto Abraham Melchizedek and he's the priest of the most high God and he's serving Bread and Wine and he's servant communion exactly what Jesus would do in Mark 14 he would say look he would say this if we'll just look at that Mark 14 verse 22 he said and they did eat and Jesus Took bread now think of this 2 000 years prior to this Melchizedek appeared unto Abraham and served him communion now two thousand years later we see this communion being instituted and as they did eat Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many no it's not a it's it's it's it's a type when Jesus stood there and said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life oh my they they stumbled at it because they couldn't understand it when he says I'll have communion with you I will give you my flesh to eat now my blood is my flesh is meat and do it was so hard to understand what he was talking about but what he was showing he was showing a type of how he was going to have communion and give up self because the word was made flesh it's the word that you're feeding on that's our communion is the word of God that we have received that is the communion of the believer in the end time that we have received the body word of the son of man and that is what we are feeding on the prophet of God would say this he would say and this same Melchizedek said and the next verse would read like this in Mark 14 verse 25 but I'm catching this quote because the prophet of God is saying and this same Melchizedek said I will take no more of the fruit of the vine until I drink it Anew with you in my father's Kingdom after the battle's over when the victory is won so here the prophet of God has pointed out this is Melchizedek this is Melchizedek and notice the type here he says after the battle is over this is a great type where Melchizedek has appeared unto Abraham and he's serving him communion he's serving them Bread and Wine and what is it it's after the battle the prophet of God shows us and in the scripture as Jesus would would say there in verse 25 he said I drink I will drink no more of the fruit of Vine until that day that I drink in Anew with you in the kingdom when it's all over when it's all over we're going to meet him in the air oh we're going to be gathered at that wedding supper and that one we've longed to see that one we've we've heard about that one we've been looking for the one we've long to see oh that day will come where we sit down at that great supper table stretched for miles and we see all of our loved ones and the ones that have crossed the port or we see ones in our family that we didn't know if God's mercy would would breach that strand oh he's a god of Mercy he's a god of compassion and on that day oh we'll see all of our brothers and sisters and the ones that have gone before and there we'll have communion at the wedding supper with our Lord what a day what a glorious day that will be when the battle is over and we come to that place but I just want to labor here for a little bit on Melchizedek if we'll turn in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 7. as Paul would pick this up now referring to our text in Genesis 14 and as Melchizedek would appear again later unto Abraham in the scriptures Hebrews 7 1 would say for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first be an interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even even the patriarch Abraham gave the teeth of the spoils consider how great a man this was the prophet of God would read that and then he would say that's the question who is this Melchizedek consider how great a man this was men have proved that who is this Melchizedek down Through the Ages and and they've they've debated and they've said well it was just a priesthood it was just more of an office it wasn't a real person and other people would say oh it's just a myth some people say it was just mythology it wasn't even there but oh watch what the prophet of God would say and who is this Melchizedek now notice praise God for these opening seals is my prayer to know these things now he's preaching this in 1965 February 21st in the evening time now he says now paragraph 95 now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view so at the opening of The Seven Seals the revelation of Melchizedek comes into view what he was God the word before he became flesh God the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see I had father and mother you did two Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father but this man had no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't well let's see we were talking about desperation some of us need a revelation of the godhead and I pray God give me more Revelation with the godhead if we ever come to the place we think we figured out God something wrong and I think that's what some of our problems and I'll raise my hand included some of our problems we think we got God we think we got the message we think we got Melchizedek we think we got the son of man we think we just got it the coming of the lord we got it all figured out we ain't got to get it do anything I think it's time to have a battle of life I think it's time to get in desperation I think it's time to pray for Revelation I think it's time to get serious about what we believe and say oh God why don't you reveal these things to me if the revelation of Melchizedek came in the plain view at the revelation of the seals Lord give me that revelation I'll try to gear back down for the interpreters now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view what he was God the word before he became flesh God the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see I had father and mother you did too Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't Jesus gave his life this man couldn't Jesus because he was life and it's the self same man all the time I hope God reveals it to you the self same person all the time notice his titles king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 2 King of righteousness and king of peace he is two kings now watch Hebrews 1 7 2 King of righteousness also the king of peace he is two kings there now since he has come in the flesh and received his body up in Revelations 21 16 he called the king of kings he's all three of them together see King God King theophany King Jesus he is the king of kings it's all men just like soul body and spirit all comes to make one oh that makes me think of Hebrews 4 12. the word is sharper than any two-edged sword oh why because he's all of them his body's Soul and Spirit he knows all about it and it's just like soul body and spirit all comes to make one also he is which was the first son in the Holy Ghost of the spirit king of righteousness the spirit attribute theophany King peace theophany and In the Flesh he was King of Kings same person now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view what do you say I hope God reveals it to you what did he say this Revelation came at the opening of The Seven Seals now I just maybe want to be admonished by Brother Paul for a little bit if you can receive anything I believe we can receive it from Brother Paul let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews 5 verse 9. Paul would write and be and made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of God and the high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are Duel of hearing well Dole means slow or sluggish and I thought you know Lord forgive me open my understanding that I might pray for revelation because many times we hear phrases and we hear things in the word and we got a little tally book and we just put a little check mark But Here Paul is saying look there's many things that I want to say about Melchizedek but you're slow to understanding and to think the prophet would pick that up and say look the revelation of Melchizedek could only come after the revelation of the Seven Seals to think that we're now sitting in the seat to where these very things that people have probed at and they're here Paul is saying look I have many things to say about Melchizedek but you your Dole of here and you you won't be able to receive that now uh because this is strong meat he would go on to say for when the time would you ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again with which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as need of milk and not a strong meat you know this really just you know pierced my heart when I was reading it and I was studying over it and I just thought oh God forgive me a time that we should be teachers out of all people who have sat under the message and we sit under a pastor who's preached it in almost 50 years and and we got the table and we we have all of the message at our disposal and if anybody should be able to be teachers if anybody should be able to be teachers of this message is those that have come out and been gathered under the voice of the seventh angel messenger where the book has come open and it's become a new book and the revelation of Melchizedek has now been made plain to the Believers and he Paul is admonishing us and say look you should be teachers but you have need that one teach you again I say Lord forgive me father may I get down to the Battle of life may I start crying out earnestly for more Revelation that God might reveal himself to me because you need one preach uh teach the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as of need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil you hear a word like that from Paul a time that you should be teachers but you needeth one to teach you that's a that's a solemn warning to me I think that's a solemn warning to the church say you know what when we come across these subjects and we come across these things laying in the word you know I I I want strong meat I praise God for milk I praise God uh for the milk for babes because we all need those things and that that's what Paul would go on when he would come into chapter six he would say let us go on to Perfection he say therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on under Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith towards God oh but let us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus I say oh God that's what I want Lord I want to have that mind I want to have that word I I want to be a student of the word if if that means if I can be unskillful if I'm just requiring milk and I'm requiring a teacher and I need somebody to walk me through it every time you know what that's a sign of it's a sign of lack of Revelation because when something is revealed to you it becomes a part of you you can work the problem backwards and forwards it's not just a memory card it's not just uh something that you've memorized like I told many times about my daughter one time I was I was reading her a book you know and and and and and and she she started reading the book and I thought my goodness my daughter's the youngest reader ever she she can actually read and I was like this is incredible you know I can't believe I I can't remember how old she was maybe four years old and and as she's reading the book and I'm like man all right praise the Lord now I'm I'm gonna get another book and I'm going to going to prove that she can read but what I found out is all she had done was memorize what she was seeing all she had was the ability to rehearse what she had been told so when the question would be asked who is this Melchizedek because he had been told to her she could rehearse what she had been told but not have an understanding of what she was saying oh God I don't want religion I don't want to just be able to to to to to to know the answers intellectually that won't do it Church just because you can listen to a message and do a book report on it doesn't do you any good there's many people that I've done a lot of book reports and preached a lot of sermons but when it came down to the Battle of Life they walked away from this message because they never received a part of God into themselves they never actually had communion they never actually met him on the planes of mammary and recognized who it really was that Melchizedek came to serve you Bread and Wine and to give you a part of himself that you could feed on that word and not just feed on that word that you could become a part of that word then when it's a revelation Let The Trials come let the questions come let the Devils line up Let the Sea Billows roll and they come to question you is this message real was brother Branham a real Prophet or a false prophet and they line up all their guns they line up all their ammunition and you say look if you want to take amen my Prophet you take aim at me if you want to take aim at the message of the hour you take aim at me if you take out the aim at me you take aim at my Lord why because it's all one flesh this is the body of Jesus Christ this is the word of God made flesh in the evening time Glory Hallelujah praise His wonderful name we are having communion with him let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so back to Hebrews 7 . consider how great a man this was I think it's worth thinking about obviously worth preaching about foreign not myself the prophet because the prophet preached it we have something to preach glory to God without this message we ain't got nothing to say I'm sorry about it I ain't got nothing to say without Malachi 4 5. I might as well just be a good Baptist might as well just be a good Methodist might as well be a good Pentecostal with no life in it just a bunch of rituals rules and regulations trying to come up with some sermon to tickle the ears of the people with itchy ears but oh God has descended in the evening time and opened the book and he's opened our understanding and he's put his words into a heart that we might have something to Fellowship around that we might have true communion oh thank you God for this message I'm glad we got something to talk about you can talk about something that's behind a form you can guess all day long you could throw a sheet over this and you can everybody you can talk about all you want and you can come up with all your ideas of what you think it is well if you see that angle coming up like that well I tell you what that that angle coming up like that I'm telling you it must be a Steinway they're the only ones that make it this way you throw a blanket on that one that must be a I tell you you see it sticking up on back that might be a 57 Chevy and everybody's just going to probe what is under the veil what is under there well I tell you what I think it is I think that's a sculpture from Michelangelo but what everybody's just presuming everybody's just uh wondering what it is but then God by Divine promise he came in the evening time Melchizedek has come again to serve you Bread and Wine and to have communion with the bride of Jesus Christ and he reached over and he grabbed the veil and said you want to know what's behind it and he took the valley away and said that's what it's been all the time this is me it's the same life I am Melchizedek I am the one that appeared on the planes of marriage Abraham I am the one that formed myself a body and I became your high priest after the order of Melchizedek I am the one that came in the evening time to break the Seven Seals Glory Hallelujah I'm happy about it verse 11. Hebrews 7 11. if therefore perfection now we're gonna really jump into what is this order of Melchizedek foreign Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek what was this hoarder what are you talking about brother Paul and not be called after the order of Aaron for the priesthood being changed change from the priesthood of Aaron changed from the levitical priesthood changed to the order of Melchizedek changed to our high priest Jesus Christ for the priesthood being changed they're made of necessity a change also of the law so so what Paul is saying here remember what a priest is it's somebody who's authorized to carry out the religious duties now the only ones that were authorized to carry out the Priestly duties was if you were born a levite so so Moses had given the law the tribe of levite was chosen to be the levitical priesthood and the law was given and because of the law there was an order for those priests to serve under right so then they the the priesthood was after the order of Aaron but you see this priesthood that was instituted these priests were men like me and you sinful men who also had to make a sacrifice for themselves they not only had to to make a sacrifice for the people but they had to make a sacrifice for themselves and then that high priest could make a sacrifice for the people and for himself and then he could go back behind the veil and they did all of that according to the law that's what gave them Authority that's what gave them the place that's what gave them the order but what Paul is saying if now Jesus Christ has become our high priest if these priests were after the order of Aaron by the law by the latter then if Jesus Christ is our high priest he has come then there has to be a word concerning that priesthood we are not under the law of sin and death oh Hallelujah he would go on to say for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth now now we take our time here just try to read it it says for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe so remember the tribe was Levi that was chosen to carry out the levitical priesthood right but now Paul is pointing out uh speaking of this order of Melchizedek speaking about this priesthood that has come in by Jesus Christ he's saying for of he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar only the try believe I did that where this man came from it's not even mentioned for it is evident that our Lord's praying out of Judah of which the tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment you see the levitical priesthood was made after a law of a carnal commandment but this Melchizedek your high priest Jesus Christ was not made after the law of a carnal commandment but he was made after the power of an endless life for he testify it thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek oh my Melchizedek the high priest for he testified thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek not after the law of sin and death but this is a new high priest this is a new order this is not under the old carnal commandment under men where where you pay tithes to a man and that man dies that's what Paul is saying in the book of Hebrews look there there was a priesthood here and you would pay tithes to the priest and that priest would die and there would because because death would continue and there would be a high priest and there would be priests and there'd be priests after Levi but this one that that Abraham paid tithes to this one that appeared unto Abraham the one Abraham paid ties to this one didn't have a beginning this one didn't have an end and this one will never die that is the order of Melchizedek your high priest Jesus Christ he didn't have a beginning he didn't have an end oh don't get your godhead mixed up now who was it that formed that body God was able to take his own word and form it into the womb of a virgin and bring forth a Word Flesh and he would come and live in that body to fulfill his own law oh what a high priest oh they had need to sacrifice from themselves but look that law was to be done away with but now this high priest was Jesus Christ with it now we're taking an exodus out of law and into Grace we're taking an exodus out into the law under a carnal commandment to the power of an endless life remember you've been made Kings and Priests so then under the law everybody was subject under the law of sin and death but now we are under the power of an endless life we have been made Kings and Priests after the order of Melchizedek Jesus Christ our high priest glory to God what are we talking about a power of an endless life what could defeat him this high priest the devil could have went back and said I took every single high preached out but this high priest was made after the power of an endless life there was no Jacob No Grave no hell no sickness this high priest had power to lay his life down and take it up again that's the order of Melchizedek one who had no beginning of days one who had no ending of life that is our high priest Jesus Christ oh the Forerunner has entered in on your behalf think of this now as Jesus would stand there maybe then priests would be looking at him and Jesus would stand there and say before Abraham was I am they wanted to Stone him for it I am the one who served communion Abraham I am the one that came to Abraham after the slaughter of the Kings and I served them Bread and Wine I am oh they wanted to Stone them I am the one that appeared unto Moses in a burning bush I am the one that parted the Red Sea I am the rock that was in the wilderness that was smitten I am the pride that's coming down out of Heaven I am Melchizedek I am the Forerunner I am your high priest and I will give you a new covenant oh Hallelujah I will give you a new covenant I will put my word in your heart I will put my words in your mind I will give you a new covenant the prophet of God will say there was a woman which was ill-famed and would call her today a red light woman a prostitute she had too many husbands so while Jesus was sitting there this woman come out about 11 o'clock see she couldn't come out with the virgins and they they would come in the morning to get their water their wash water she had to wait they didn't mix like they do now she was marked so then come out to get some water she just took the old window and put the hooks over the jar and started to let it down she heard somebody say I don't know about you but I was that woman friends it gots to be a revelation oh if you ever hear him call your name if you've ever heard from your theophany if you've ever heard from home then your situation doesn't matter anymore what you're facing doesn't matter anymore how bad it looks doesn't matter anymore here was a woman with an unfixable problem unfixable there was no law there is no priest there is no place she could go to fix her situation has brother Billy said this morning pointing to the scripture you have not chosen me I have chosen you and what did the son of man come to do he came to identify the woman at the well and tell her your identification is not your condition your identification is not your condition I am your identification I am the word I have been made flesh I am Melchizedek I am the Forerunner I have descended in the evening time I have come to say give me a drink I want to have communion with you your situation doesn't Define who you are your problems doesn't Define who you are that is not your description that is not your identification your description is the word of God that is your identification your identification isn't your problem your identification isn't your past your identification is that Melchizedek has descended in the evening time to tell you you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you didn't choose me I chose you your problems they're not your problems anymore bring all of your problems to me I'm the Waymaker I'm the Trailblazer I'm the Forerunner I am Melchizedek I am the Forerunner I am your high priest come unto me all ye who are heavy laden and I will give you rest give me a drink she heard somebody say woman bring me a drink now remember this Melchizedek his words that was the prophet's words now remember this Melchizedek this Jesus this Jesus yesterday the son of man and she looked around and she saw a Jew so she said sir is not profit proper for Jew to ask a Samaritan for anything I'm a woman of Samaria so you have spoken out of your place you shouldn't have asked me such a thing as that we have no dealings with another he said but if you knew but if you knew who you was talking to you had asked me for a drink I would ask you what do you see when you look she saw a Jew when she looked she saw a Jew there what do you see when you look at the message what do you see when you look at the prophet what do you look when you see a cloud up there what do you see when you look she when she looks she saw a Jew but just a few more moments in the presence of the son of man in the presence of Melchizedek as he started to discern the thoughts and intents of her heart all of a sudden it sounded like home to her she said when Messiah comes he will tell us these things and all of a sudden the veil that was over her eyes God pulled it away and she said this is him this is him this is the Messiah and now she ran back and said come see a man come and see oh Hallelujah glory to God what did what did uh Nathaniel say when he came into his presence behold an Israelite who there's no guile rabbi how do you know me before Philip called you when you're out there doing drugs when you're all mixed up in the world when you ran off out there without a boy over there when you got yourself and all that family problems when you were born into a situation you thought there was no way out that's when I saw you while you were yet in sin I died for you why because I'm Melchizedek I'm the Forerunner I'm your high priest I knew everything that you would go for I knew everything that you would go through Rabbi when did you know me yeah I knew you I knew you back then when you were under that tree I knew when you were going through all those problems I knew all those things the the that the reason why I knew them so I could bear them to Calvary because I'm the Waymaker I'm the Trailblazer I'm the only one that could take your sin I'm the only one that could take your problem I'm the only one that could take your weakness upon my back and nail it there to Calvary that you might be forgiven that you might be set free I am Melchizedek Hallelujah oh black I just why don't the musicians just come I don't want to belabor while the presence of God is Rich amongst us that's what Paul is saying in Hebrews 7 he's saying if the law could have produced perfection a new order wouldn't have been needed he said in Hebrews 8 7 he says for if the first Covenant have been faultless then should no place have been sought for a second for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah just give me a moment just a few moments before we play brother Cosman listen to The Prophet say these words by God's grace and his help will we'll try to capitalize on where we're sitting Christ revealed in his own word like in Hebrews there when Paul wrote it he is God Jesus Christ yesterday of the Old Testament he is Jesus Christ today manifested in the flesh and he's Jesus Christ forever in the spirit to come see saying yesterday today and forever and he ever lives to make his word live what it said it would do for that age he is alive he was alive in the Old Testament manifested I just want to let you see a little something here if you can stand it watch when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament as we believe it now you preachers out there you can argue with it do whatever you want do what you think see when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament in a theophany and the person of Melchizedek not a priesthood but the person the man see for this man had not yet been born but he was in a theophany so he had no father no mother he was God himself he was manifested in the form of a man called King of Salem which is king of peace and King righteousness see he was Melchizedek he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of Life see it was Jesus in a theophany in the form of a man could you go that all right then he was made actually human flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ born the Virgin Mary he come in the form so he could die and went back into heaven but now in the last days he's promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh conspiracy for it was as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man oh don't you realize the same one that appeared unto Abraham after the order of Melchizedek because this was a spiritual priesthood this was for the Royal Seed of Abraham this same Melchizedek has now by Divine promise has come in the end time and he took on flesh again that he might serve you communion that he might serve you Brandon what who is this Melchizedek I want you to consider how great a man this was not the man William Branham the life of God that came and borrowed that vessel he said I was just once standing near he said man's words will fail man my words will fail I just was one that could surrender myself that he could take my voice and use my voice and speak out to the bride you're not feeding on the words of a man his words will fail you're feeding on the body word of the son of man you are having communion with Melchizedek you are having communion with the Lord the great Forerunner Melchizedek has come and made a way for you in the evening time bless his wonderful name why don't we just stand just start to play something softly brother maybe the Revelation song I was enjoying that Peter says this wherefore laying aside first Peter 2 1. we'll first laying aside on malice and Argyle and hypocrisies and envies in all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere

change being a McGarry I was born in McGeary nothing I can do can change that and you were born a son and daughter of God because God chose you your situation doesn't Define you your troubles don't Define you but God knew all of your trouble he knew all of your heartache so he said look I'll be the one I'll be the one to enter in behind the veil I'll be Melchizedek I'll be the Forerunner I'll for run on your behalf I'll come to the place of maturity first because if I come to that place first as a forerunner then that means all of you can follow after him what is a sheath wave it's a first one that come to maturity then oh give me one moment just as they lightly play who is this Melchizedek [Music] the prophet of God and who is this Melchizedek he would say now father God this is totally out of the hands of man there was one in our generation that fulfilled laughs when Jesus prayed and said father I pray that they would be one even as We Are One [Music] there came a man who stood on the earth in the end time who came into that Oneness and that Unity that where when he spoke it was deity speaking he was the first one that came to maturity that was Melchizedek appearing

going to manifest in you now father God this is totally out of my hands of any man it would have to be supernatural phenomena so I pray that you'll help me now Lord I'm in your hands do with me as you see fit what was it that wasn't the order of a man [Music] that was at the order of under a priesthood that was a higher order that was after the order of Melchizedek God coming to tell you who you
