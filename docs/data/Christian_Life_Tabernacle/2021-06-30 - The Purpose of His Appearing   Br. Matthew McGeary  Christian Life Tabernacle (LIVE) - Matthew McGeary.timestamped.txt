[39:32] preaching of the word
[39:33] it all plays a part in god's great
[39:35] economy amen
[39:37] it's reading out of acts chapter 26
[39:40] we'll be reading verse 13
[39:43] up to verse 19 maybe we'll start with
[39:45] verse 12. it says
[39:47] whereupon as i went we're just picking
[39:49] up here where uh
[39:52] uh i believe paul is testifying here to
[39:55] a king agrippa
[39:56] and he's telling about he's given his
[39:58] testimony and he says in verse 12
[40:00] whereupon as i went to damascus with the
[40:02] authorities and commission from the
[40:03] chief priest
[40:05] at midday o king i saw in the way a
[40:08] light from heaven
[40:10] above the brightness of the sun shining
[40:13] around about me
[40:15] and them which journeyed with me and
[40:18] when we were falling to the earth i
[40:20] heard a voice
[40:20] speaking unto me and saying in the
[40:22] hebrew tongue saul saul
[40:24] why persecutest thou me it is hard for
[40:28] thee to kick
[40:29] against the pricks and i said who art
[40:31] thou lord
[40:32] and he said i am jesus whom thou
[40:34] persecute us
[40:35] but rise and stand upon thy feet for i
[40:38] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[40:40] to make thee a minister
[40:41] and a witness both of these things which
[40:43] thou hast seen
[40:45] and of those things in which i will
[40:47] appear unto thee
[40:48] delivering thee from the people and from
[40:50] the gentiles unto whom
[40:52] i send thee to open their eyes and to
[40:55] turn them from the darkness to light
[40:58] and from the power of satan unto god
[41:01] that they may receive forgiveness of
[41:03] sins
[41:04] and inheritance among them which are
[41:07] sanctified
[41:09] by the faith that is in me amen we just
[41:12] pray a blessing upon the reading of the
[41:13] word you may be seated
[41:19] just want to pull for a a little thought
[41:22] here from verse
[41:23] 16 it says for i have appeared unto thee
[41:27] for this purpose
[41:28] and i want to just speak to you a little
[41:30] bit on the purpose of his appearing
[41:33] says to make thee a minister and a
[41:35] witness both of these things
[41:37] which thou has seen and of those things
[41:40] in which
[41:41] i will appear unto thee you know a
[41:43] minister and a witness
[41:45] is not for themselves only but there's
[41:48] another part to the equation
[41:50] he says i'm going to make the a minister
[41:53] and a witness and so it's not going to
[41:55] just be a minister
[41:56] and a witness for paul's sake but god is
[41:59] now apprehending paul because he has a
[42:01] work for him to do
[42:03] god is going to send paul unto the
[42:05] gentiles and he's going to bring them
[42:07] the faith and the word
[42:08] and i just even think of the scripture
[42:11] you know in
[42:12] in malachi says behold i send you
[42:15] elijah it doesn't say behold elijah
[42:18] but he says behold i send you elijah so
[42:21] the very purpose of elijah appearing on
[42:23] the scene
[42:24] was he had a specific work that god was
[42:27] wanting to use him for
[42:29] and so just last time we we spoke we we
[42:32] mentioned
[42:33] speaking about unlocking your potential
[42:35] and just looking at what potential is
[42:38] it's this
[42:38] it's it's potential means something that
[42:41] can develop
[42:42] or become actual we we want this word to
[42:46] become a living reality
[42:49] when paul was struck down on the road to
[42:51] the
[42:52] damascus what what he when he was
[42:55] persecuting the christian church there
[42:58] and now here he's struck down by the
[43:00] pillar of fire and he says paul it's
[43:01] hard to get
[43:02] kick against the pricks and he said who
[43:04] are you lord
[43:06] this very uh uh lord jesus that he was
[43:09] persecuting the church for
[43:10] who he he thought was an apostasy he
[43:13] thought he was a false christ
[43:14] he he his motive and his objective was
[43:17] to kill everybody
[43:18] that was professing the name of jesus
[43:20] christ because he believed that jesus
[43:23] was a false prophet
[43:25] that's what was in his thinking was but
[43:27] something transpired to paul
[43:29] where this very jesus that he did not
[43:32] believe in and the very people that were
[43:34] giving their lives
[43:35] they were willing to lay down their
[43:37] lives and say no i believe in jesus
[43:39] christ
[43:40] because there was a reality something
[43:42] had been quickened to them
[43:44] and now paul has come to this place to
[43:46] where he has met
[43:47] the lord jesus christ in the pillar of
[43:49] fire and so this jesus
[43:52] who they were calling the lord and
[43:54] savior and they were calling him the son
[43:55] of god
[43:56] this thing that seemed to be a a mystic
[43:59] or something that was
[44:00] false became a reality to him where he
[44:03] knew it for himself
[44:04] so that pillar of fire appeared for the
[44:06] purpose and what was that purpose he
[44:08] said i
[44:09] appeared unto you for this purpose
[44:11] because i'm going to make you
[44:12] a minister and a witness
[44:16] but we want this word now to become a
[44:18] living reality
[44:20] and as i was thinking about there's a
[44:22] lot of people
[44:24] that profess the word but the word is
[44:26] not a reality in their lives i was
[44:29] i was even thinking about that story in
[44:31] in uh
[44:33] where the two ladies are laying claim to
[44:36] one child
[44:37] and they end up before solomon one was
[44:39] an imposter
[44:41] one was faking it one was having a false
[44:43] claim
[44:45] but then in god's wisdom and in his mind
[44:49] he allowed a situation or an
[44:50] hour or something to present itself to
[44:53] where
[44:54] when solomon said all right if if y'all
[44:57] both are arguing over it
[44:58] then go ahead and cut the child in half
[45:01] but because there was a mother there
[45:03] that she wasn't faking it but it was a
[45:05] reality to her that was her child it
[45:08] brought
[45:08] something outside of her there was
[45:11] something
[45:11] in her that wasn't a put on there was
[45:13] something in her
[45:15] that wasn't fake she was a real true
[45:17] mother so when her baby come into harm's
[45:19] way something just
[45:21] hollered i said no don't don't hurt the
[45:23] baby it was something that other lady
[45:26] that was being being a make-believer she
[45:28] didn't possess
[45:30] something in her she was just faking it
[45:32] she was just making a false claim
[45:34] and that's exactly what we're starting
[45:36] to see in the hour that we're living in
[45:38] as things are tightening up and as
[45:40] things are getting more severe
[45:42] and that's the squeeze as you would say
[45:45] is coming on
[45:46] and it's just getting a little bit
[45:47] harder to live this message
[45:49] and people are starting to challenge
[45:50] people on what they believe
[45:52] they're starting to find out they don't
[45:53] have what they thought they had
[45:56] but that's okay for the true believer
[45:59] these things
[46:00] has to happen because if the word is a
[46:02] reality to you
[46:04] it's only an opportunity for that life
[46:06] that is then the seed
[46:08] to continue to grow and to continue to
[46:11] manifest
[46:12] and all of those attributes that god has
[46:14] placed on the seed inside of you
[46:17] all of the situations and everything
[46:19] that you're going through is just an
[46:21] opportunity for that word seed to be
[46:24] birthed into manifestation
[46:28] so we there has to come something that
[46:30] is going to pull
[46:32] that potential out as we think about the
[46:35] seeds you know you look at the flowers
[46:36] and you
[46:37] you look at the trees and you start to
[46:39] talk about the seed you start to talk
[46:40] about the seasons
[46:42] you know you might look at that flower
[46:43] and arrow it's basking in the glory of
[46:46] the sun and it's waving back and forth
[46:48] but there comes a season and a time and
[46:50] a fall and a winter
[46:52] where that glory and that beauty that
[46:54] you saw it goes into the ground
[46:56] but is that the end of the life of that
[46:58] seed is that the end of the life of that
[47:00] flower
[47:01] no because god has pus put his word into
[47:05] nature
[47:05] and there is a cycle there for that seed
[47:08] as it lays there in the earth
[47:10] all of us something something striking
[47:12] starts to happen
[47:13] in the deadness of winter and the cold
[47:16] and and the snow blankets the ground but
[47:18] oh
[47:18] as the earth turns and the seasons turn
[47:20] and that sun comes out
[47:22] and it starts to warm that earth
[47:24] something starts to happen
[47:26] laying under in that ground there's a
[47:28] seed with all of that potential
[47:30] to resurrect back to the fullness of the
[47:33] glory it had in the beginning
[47:35] oh and that's the purpose of the rising
[47:37] of the sun
[47:38] is to bring those seeds that have been
[47:40] sown into the earth
[47:42] into full manifestation of what they
[47:44] were intended to be
[47:47] if the sun never rose the seed could
[47:51] never serve its purpose
[47:53] you realize if we did not see the
[47:55] resurrection of the word in our day
[47:58] if we didn't see the rising of the sun
[48:00] if malachi 4
[48:02] 5 didn't come if luke 17 30 didn't
[48:04] appear and manifest the word
[48:06] then there would be no way for that word
[48:08] seed that was buried inside of you to
[48:10] come to manifestation
[48:12] but let me say it like this the purpose
[48:14] of his appearing
[48:15] was to sow that word into your heart and
[48:18] to be
[48:18] bringing into manifestation without the
[48:21] word we would have nothing to manifest
[48:24] as our pastor said we'd be looking back
[48:27] there somewhere
[48:28] trying to pull up something from an age
[48:30] gone by and trying to resurrect
[48:32] something from another age
[48:34] and if we're not careful we see people
[48:36] trying to do that today
[48:37] trying to resurrect some some
[48:39] manifestation from an age gone by but
[48:41] we're right
[48:42] here where god wants us to be living in
[48:45] the hour that he's called us to be in
[48:47] and he has sent his quickening power to
[48:50] manifest that seed
[48:52] amen that's where we're at we're living
[48:55] right in the time of the manifestations
[48:57] of the sons of god
[49:00] thank you lord we spoke a little bit
[49:02] about unlocking your potential and that
[49:04] definition is if you
[49:06] you unlock your potential you're
[49:09] locking the secrets of someone you
[49:12] release them
[49:13] i was just thinking my down there in
[49:15] egypt you had a joshua and a caleb
[49:18] you had a prophet who failed and had ran
[49:20] back on the back side of the desert
[49:21] here were all these sons of god who had
[49:24] a big part to play in god's economy
[49:27] here was here was moses he was supposed
[49:29] to be the prophet of the hour
[49:33] he doesn't even know what he's doing
[49:34] he's he's back there on the back side of
[49:36] the day he's done run away from his
[49:37] responsibility
[49:39] he's like i tried to do it i tried to be
[49:41] a son of god i tried to live this
[49:43] message
[49:43] i tried with everything that was in me
[49:45] and i wasn't able to do it
[49:47] i heard i was raised from a baby saying
[49:49] that i was a deliverer
[49:50] saying that was an i was an overcomer
[49:52] that i could run through a troop and i
[49:53] could leap over a wall
[49:56] but when i tried to do it on my own
[49:58] ability i tried to not utterly fallacy
[50:00] that's the problem
[50:01] we keep trying to manifest the message
[50:04] with our intellect
[50:05] and our own ability and it'll never work
[50:08] and there was a joshua and a caleb there
[50:10] they were there buried in the mud pits
[50:12] of egypt but when it came time for the
[50:14] hour of manifestation
[50:16] what did god do he appeared unto his
[50:18] prophet
[50:19] in a burning bush the pillar of fire
[50:21] came on the scene
[50:22] why because it was time for him to
[50:24] manifest the word of promise
[50:26] and to take his children in an exodus no
[50:29] different from the hour we're living in
[50:30] that's exactly why he appeared in this
[50:32] hour was to take us in an exodus
[50:37] i say as long as you're down there in
[50:39] the muck
[50:40] and mine of sin you're not serving your
[50:44] purpose
[50:48] we could go in and all to all the
[50:49] avenues of the way you can live in sin
[50:53] and you might be surprised living in sin
[50:55] doesn't need you
[50:56] need to be out there in the world
[50:57] running around
[51:00] you can be living you can be living in
[51:02] sin staring at a brick wall
[51:07] you're living in sin when you were born
[51:10] if you never committed one sin you're
[51:11] living in sin
[51:14] you could be born death dumb and blind
[51:16] and you're living in sin
[51:18] but oh god rich in mercy where with that
[51:21] great love wearing if he loved us he
[51:23] predestinated you
[51:25] and he elected you and he called you not
[51:27] to live down there in the muck in the
[51:29] mire
[51:30] but god has personally appeared to you
[51:32] to bring you out of that condition
[51:35] oh my are we thankful for that maybe
[51:38] we'll just read a scripture first peter
[51:40] 2 9.
[51:45] it says but ye are a chosen generation
[51:48] a royal priesthood and a holy nation
[51:52] a peculiar people that ye should show
[51:55] forth
[51:55] the praises of him who have called you
[51:58] out of darkness
[52:00] into his marvelous light oh
[52:03] praise god thank you lord jesus for
[52:06] calling me out of the darkness
[52:08] that i should show forth praises of you
[52:10] who called me out of that darkness
[52:12] into this marvelous glorious light
[52:16] oh my i don't know about you i'm so
[52:18] happy about it
[52:20] if this message is getting stagnant and
[52:22] you've you've gotten
[52:23] bored with it and you're just you're
[52:25] just kind of towing along and you're
[52:27] trying to put the quotes and everything
[52:28] together i'm telling you
[52:30] something is wrong something is wrong
[52:32] you need to meet the lord jesus christ
[52:34] personally for yourself you need to get
[52:36] the easter seal that quickening power in
[52:38] your heart
[52:39] and in your life and to set you on fire
[52:42] oh it's like fire shut up in your bones
[52:44] when you meet the lord jesus christ
[52:46] you're never the same and i'm not
[52:47] talking about some meeting at a
[52:48] campground
[52:49] i'm not talking about some experience at
[52:51] the altar all of those things are good
[52:53] but when you meet the resurrected lord
[52:55] jesus christ on those sacred sands
[52:58] oh something changes old things pass
[53:00] away
[53:01] all things become new oh the whole world
[53:04] can line up and take their shot at you
[53:06] try to make you doubt it try to make you
[53:08] give it up
[53:09] all the devils in hell can come and try
[53:11] to torment you and show you
[53:13] that this message is wrong the whole
[53:15] church can walk away
[53:16] your pastor can walk away but there's an
[53:18] anchor
[53:19] that's driven so far down back to
[53:21] eternity
[53:22] you can't get away from this message if
[53:24] you wanted to
[53:26] you are the message you are the very
[53:29] manifestation of what was spoken by
[53:31] malachi 4 5.
[53:36] oh thank you jesus hallelujah
[53:42] john 14 90 says yet a little while
[53:46] and the world seeth me no more
[53:52] but ye see me because i live
[53:56] ye live also what is it
[54:00] because you have recognized
[54:04] because you have recognized the
[54:06] resurrection of the word of this day
[54:10] behold a little while the world
[54:13] is not going to see me anymore they're
[54:16] not going to see
[54:18] a jesus of nazareth walking around but
[54:20] you will see me
[54:22] because i live ye live also i'll be with
[54:25] you
[54:26] i'll be even in you until the end i say
[54:29] where is this lord jesus christ
[54:31] he's living in you oh i'm so glad about
[54:35] it to be quickened from the dead what
[54:38] does he say there in the rising of the
[54:39] sun he goes what a resurrection that was
[54:42] what a resurrection this is to be
[54:44] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[54:46] in jesus christ by that
[54:48] quickening power
[54:51] oh if you have an experience that i
[54:53] invite you to
[54:55] it'll take away all your doubts it'll
[54:57] take away all your fears
[54:59] all your unbelief and all your problems
[55:01] and everything that just seems so hard
[55:02] to get over
[55:03] oh and they just keep rolling in and you
[55:05] don't know how you're going to make it
[55:07] oh but when you have a friend that
[55:08] sticketh closer to a brother
[55:10] when you have the the creator of heavens
[55:12] and earth living on the inside of you oh
[55:14] it produces a peace that passes
[55:16] understanding
[55:19] oh praise god he would say in john 12 24
[55:22] verily verily i say unto you
[55:25] except the corn of wheat fall into the
[55:27] ground and die it abideth alone
[55:31] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[55:34] fruit if that same spirit
[55:39] that raised christ from the dead dwell
[55:42] in you
[55:43] what will it do it will
[55:46] quicken your mortal body it will bear
[55:50] the same fruit that our lord jesus
[55:52] christ bore
[55:53] it'll bear the same fruit that paul bore
[55:56] it'll bear the same fruit of our
[55:57] pentecostal fathers
[55:59] it'll bear the same fruit of the
[56:00] messenger of the hour why because it's
[56:03] christ the word
[56:04] living in you i wonder if we're
[56:07] hungering and
[56:08] thirsting for the manifestation of the
[56:11] message in your life
[56:13] i wonder if we've gotten complacent and
[56:15] we're just
[56:16] satisfied with the little bit of
[56:18] knowledge and understanding
[56:20] and maybe the little revelation that we
[56:22] think we have that we just got enough to
[56:24] make us happy
[56:25] we got just enough to get excited at the
[56:28] church meeting
[56:29] we got just enough to give us a little
[56:30] victory throughout the day
[56:32] but we're not hungry and thirsting for
[56:34] the deep things of god
[56:36] i think maybe a lot of us are just
[56:38] packaging packing around a little
[56:39] message
[56:40] baby bottle feeder we're we're just
[56:43] drinking message milk
[56:45] it's good don't get me wrong i i like it
[56:49] i like all the word of god
[56:51] but strong meat belongeth to those that
[56:53] are seasoned in the word
[56:55] i want some strong meat lord break the
[56:58] bread of life to me i want to feed on
[57:00] the deep things of god lord jesus
[57:01] i want to go all the way with you lord
[57:03] all that you have for me i want it
[57:06] i don't want to be satisfied and
[57:08] complacent with where i'm at but
[57:10] something is hungering
[57:11] and thirsting for more i want to take
[57:13] that next step and one more step
[57:15] and soon and very soon we're going to
[57:17] take that next step right into our
[57:18] theophany and be gone
[57:21] but you better be thirsting for it you
[57:24] better be hungering for it
[57:25] you better be looking for it you better
[57:27] be expecting it
[57:30] oh let's start expecting the word
[57:34] to be fruitful in our life
[57:40] then when the word then when the world
[57:42] asks you
[57:43] why you live the way you live why you do
[57:46] the things you do
[57:48] why you believe the way you believe
[57:53] because you've been quickened
[57:56] because something has taken place
[57:59] and typically the reason why they're
[58:00] inquiring with to you is because they
[58:03] know
[58:03] something's different about you and then
[58:06] we can say as jesus said when his mother
[58:10] and joseph come to him there in the
[58:11] temple say we've been looking all over
[58:14] for you
[58:16] where have you been the prophet says
[58:20] watch the word correct the air
[58:25] the prophet said she she even ruined her
[58:29] own testimony
[58:31] by showing up in the synagogue and
[58:33] saying to jesus your mother and father
[58:35] have been looking for you
[58:37] knowing that that was not joseph's son
[58:41] the prophet of god said that she she was
[58:44] ruining
[58:45] and speaking against her own testimony
[58:47] but he said
[58:48] watch the word correct the air
[58:51] he looked at her and said i must be
[58:54] about my father's business
[58:56] oh if there could be a people today that
[58:59] would be
[59:00] walking and breathing this message and
[59:03] walking in the sunlight of the s-o-n
[59:05] saying
[59:06] i must be about my
[59:09] father's business
[59:14] well i want to be about the father's
[59:16] business
[59:18] you know what the father's business is
[59:21] deliverance
[59:23] healing the salvation of your family
[59:30] a sanctified life a holy life a
[59:34] consecrated life
[59:36] possessing your vessels in
[59:37] sanctification and honor
[59:39] that's being about the father's business
[59:43] you know what the father's business is
[59:44] it's the holy ghost
[59:47] if you want to be about the father's
[59:48] business we want to get into a place
[59:50] where we're hungering and thirsting for
[59:52] the spirit of god to be moving in our
[59:54] life
[59:59] oh i i i say god help us
[1:00:03] i think sometimes we we got a little too
[1:00:06] good
[1:00:12] we need to be crying out for the spirit
[1:00:15] when jesus gave the parable there and he
[1:00:18] talks about the
[1:00:18] the seed being sown he said some uh fell
[1:00:21] on stony ground and it sprung up
[1:00:24] or some seed was sown and it sprung up
[1:00:26] but he said it lacked moisture
[1:00:28] you know a lot of the times the reason
[1:00:30] why you're not being fruitful in your
[1:00:31] christian life is because you lack
[1:00:33] moisture
[1:00:35] when's the last time maybe just ask this
[1:00:38] to yourself personally
[1:00:41] when's the last time at your own home
[1:00:45] you got into the presence of god now
[1:00:48] let's just be real
[1:00:50] all right let's just be real
[1:00:53] if we're going to be a book of acts
[1:00:54] church and if another limb has ever put
[1:00:56] forth and we're going to have
[1:00:57] uh uh i'll and the days of ananias and
[1:01:00] sapphira and we're going to be in such a
[1:01:02] unity
[1:01:02] where if sin tried to walk through them
[1:01:04] doors it would be called out
[1:01:06] i imagine there would be some some of us
[1:01:08] on a wednesday night telling our boss
[1:01:10] look you don't understand i got to get
[1:01:12] home i want to get into the presence of
[1:01:14] god just for a little bit
[1:01:15] let me get 15 minutes let me get five
[1:01:18] let me just get into the presence of god
[1:01:20] for 20 minutes
[1:01:21] five minutes lord before i show up to
[1:01:23] the church house because i want to do my
[1:01:24] part
[1:01:25] i want to get into the presence i need a
[1:01:27] little moisture i need a little spirit
[1:01:29] i want to bring something to the house
[1:01:31] of god
[1:01:33] oh but everybody's showing up with empty
[1:01:35] buckets that's okay because god gots
[1:01:37] enough to go around
[1:01:38] but i think we've come to a place where
[1:01:40] we're mature christians where we can
[1:01:41] show up with a little bit of something
[1:01:44] we got a little bit of something to
[1:01:45] throw onto the fire you see a little far
[1:01:47] i'm just going to throw a little bit on
[1:01:49] there
[1:01:49] you see somebody getting on fire
[1:01:51] starting to raise up and praise a little
[1:01:53] bit i've been praying for that brother
[1:01:54] i've been i've been wanting to see that
[1:01:56] brother get the victory and you're right
[1:01:58] there behind him you're rejoicing
[1:01:59] you're praising the lord we're getting
[1:02:00] in an atmosphere we're getting in the
[1:02:02] spirit we're getting a little moisture
[1:02:04] in our lives
[1:02:06] god help us to live a victorious life
[1:02:08] and live in the spirit
[1:02:12] the prophet of god would say and until
[1:02:14] you come in behind the badger skin
[1:02:17] until you get out of your old skin your
[1:02:20] old thoughts your old creeds and come
[1:02:21] into the presence of god
[1:02:23] then the word becomes a living reality
[1:02:26] to you
[1:02:26] oh god let that word become a living
[1:02:28] reality to me
[1:02:30] then you're awakened glory to god then
[1:02:34] you're awakened to the shekinah glory
[1:02:36] then the bible becomes a new book jesus
[1:02:39] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:02:41] forever you're living
[1:02:42] in his presence eating the show bread
[1:02:44] that's only provided
[1:02:47] provided that day for believers
[1:02:50] a priest
[1:02:54] a priest only and we are priests a royal
[1:02:56] priesthood
[1:02:58] a holy nation a peculiar people given
[1:03:00] spiritual sacrifices to god
[1:03:03] but you must come in behind the veil
[1:03:07] to see the unveiled god oh god that's
[1:03:10] what i want
[1:03:11] until you come behind the badger skin
[1:03:14] until you're awakened into the shekinah
[1:03:16] glory do you know i i think a little bit
[1:03:18] like paul would say to the galatians
[1:03:20] there in galatians 3 1
[1:03:22] he would say oh foolish galatians who
[1:03:24] hath bewitched you
[1:03:26] you know you know the devil's trying to
[1:03:27] be with you
[1:03:30] he's trying to charm you he's trying to
[1:03:32] entertain you
[1:03:34] he's trying to offer you some
[1:03:35] substitutes oh foolish galatians
[1:03:38] who who has bewitched you
[1:03:41] from obeying the truth
[1:03:46] trying to keep you from serving your
[1:03:47] purpose
[1:03:49] but he he's so clever and crafty on how
[1:03:52] he can entertain
[1:03:52] us he might get you entertaining surfing
[1:03:55] other churches
[1:03:58] surfing other people's church services
[1:04:00] and and feeding on other church sites
[1:04:01] and stuff hey
[1:04:03] that's all right you do that all you
[1:04:04] want just don't be neglecting
[1:04:07] your responsibilities to your own group
[1:04:10] don't be neglecting your
[1:04:11] responsibilities to your family
[1:04:13] don't be neglecting your responsibility
[1:04:15] to your brothers and sisters here
[1:04:20] we have a responsibility and many times
[1:04:24] we can
[1:04:25] we we could be bewitched or we could be
[1:04:27] charmed that we get ourselves involved
[1:04:29] in things where we begun in the spirit
[1:04:32] oh things started out really good but he
[1:04:34] says oh foolish galatians who hath
[1:04:36] bewitched you
[1:04:37] he says are you so foolish having begun
[1:04:41] in the spirit that
[1:04:42] you are now made perfect in the flesh
[1:04:45] look the letter killeth it's the spirit
[1:04:47] that giveth life
[1:04:49] it saved will offer you position in the
[1:04:51] church he'll offer you a tradition
[1:04:54] he'll offer you a routine he'll offer
[1:04:56] you something to
[1:04:57] quench that hunger and that thirst for
[1:05:01] the spirit of god in your life
[1:05:03] he will give you responsibility that's
[1:05:05] good responsibility
[1:05:07] now let me taper that back and say god
[1:05:09] can give you that responsibility but if
[1:05:10] you're not
[1:05:11] careful you'll let that responsibility
[1:05:13] quench
[1:05:14] that hunger and that thirst for more of
[1:05:16] god in your life
[1:05:18] i can give a personal testimony that
[1:05:20] that i could say one thing when god
[1:05:22] called me to the ministry i said lord
[1:05:24] may i never let the work in the ministry
[1:05:28] and the calling to the ministry to
[1:05:30] quench that hunger
[1:05:31] and thirst for lost souls
[1:05:35] god never let me never be so uh uh uh
[1:05:38] to a place to where i don't have a heart
[1:05:41] and a
[1:05:41] longing to continue to witness and seek
[1:05:44] out those that are lost
[1:05:46] and preach the gospel out in the
[1:05:47] community and if we're not careful we'll
[1:05:50] let the church group
[1:05:52] and we let the church house and we let
[1:05:54] the church order
[1:05:55] and we allow the church routine to be
[1:05:57] that very thing
[1:05:59] that is quenching that fire of god in
[1:06:01] your life that's wanting to burst forth
[1:06:03] out in the community and win souls to
[1:06:05] god
[1:06:08] well it can happen that's a reality but
[1:06:12] we want that spirit of god
[1:06:14] moving in our life
[1:06:17] paul would say in romans 8 14 for as
[1:06:19] many as are led by the spirit of god
[1:06:22] they are the sons of god galatians 5 16
[1:06:26] this i say then walk in the spirit
[1:06:30] and you will not fulfill the lust of the
[1:06:32] flesh
[1:06:34] i like this little sometimes i call them
[1:06:37] one-liners
[1:06:37] brother branham said get in the spirit
[1:06:40] and when you get in the spirit
[1:06:42] then you see the vision then you're
[1:06:45] about
[1:06:46] the father's business i was i was really
[1:06:49] moved
[1:06:51] sunday when our pastor was speaking
[1:06:54] about
[1:06:55] you know the president's word and and
[1:06:58] saying that you're not missing out
[1:07:01] we're not missing out on anything i got
[1:07:04] to thinking about david
[1:07:07] here here here was david he's out there
[1:07:09] tending to his father's sheep and all of
[1:07:11] his brothers are down fighting a war
[1:07:14] and he's he's he's over there he's like
[1:07:16] you know what
[1:07:18] i've had an experience i've heard from
[1:07:20] the prophet
[1:07:21] he actually anointed me why am i out
[1:07:24] here
[1:07:26] just out here doing errands
[1:07:29] what am i doing anyways wha why why did
[1:07:32] god even call me
[1:07:34] why did god even anoint me
[1:07:39] why is this the position he has me in
[1:07:42] you know david probably felt like he was
[1:07:43] missing out
[1:07:45] saying all my brothers they're down
[1:07:47] there in action and all i'm doing
[1:07:50] is i'm just timing my father's sheep but
[1:07:53] you know he was out there while he was
[1:07:54] tending his father's sheep
[1:07:56] it was out there when he was going to
[1:07:57] school it was out there when he was in
[1:07:59] his home life
[1:08:00] it was out there that when he was just
[1:08:02] doing the things that seemed mundane it
[1:08:04] was out there when maybe he was just
[1:08:05] doing the dishes or
[1:08:06] doing the laundry or doing what your
[1:08:08] homemakers do it was when he was just
[1:08:10] doing the routine things that the spirit
[1:08:13] of god
[1:08:14] moved upon david and he slayed a lion
[1:08:17] and he slayed a bear
[1:08:22] so here david is he's feeling like maybe
[1:08:24] he's missing out a little bit and his
[1:08:26] father
[1:08:26] calls him and says hey david i want you
[1:08:30] to run on down and take some cheese and
[1:08:31] bread down down to your brothers and to
[1:08:33] the captain down there in the army
[1:08:36] so maybe david's feeling you know all
[1:08:38] right you know
[1:08:40] yes father i i'll do that and here he is
[1:08:42] i may be
[1:08:43] i don't know he's packing a little uh a
[1:08:46] a bread basket down the way and maybe
[1:08:48] there's some
[1:08:49] some other reinforcements coming in
[1:08:51] they're running in with with
[1:08:52] shields and spears and swords and
[1:08:54] they're looking at this guy like hey man
[1:08:57] where are you packing a bread basket to
[1:08:59] the battle
[1:09:00] like well i'm just about the father's
[1:09:02] business oh you're wearing us
[1:09:04] you're wearing a long skirt and
[1:09:06] unbroided hair and you're not putting
[1:09:08] all them
[1:09:09] fancy stuff in your hair to look like
[1:09:11] the world and and you're wearing it long
[1:09:12] and you ain't wearing those high-heeled
[1:09:14] shoes
[1:09:15] uh you're walking the king's highway yep
[1:09:17] i'm just about the father's business
[1:09:19] oh you look so humbly you don't you you
[1:09:21] don't blend in with the world you look
[1:09:22] old-fashioned you
[1:09:24] you look like little house on the
[1:09:25] prairie oh if you want to call me little
[1:09:27] house on the prayer
[1:09:28] if you want to tell me i'm old-fashioned
[1:09:30] whatever you want to call me just
[1:09:32] just call me about the father's business
[1:09:35] just call me being about the lord's
[1:09:36] business just call me be in the word
[1:09:38] being manifested
[1:09:40] i'm just doing what the father bit me do
[1:09:42] and here dave
[1:09:43] goes on down the road and he draws into
[1:09:45] the battle
[1:09:47] gets close there and there's all the
[1:09:48] israelites and he he
[1:09:50] he's going to uh uh make haste to do
[1:09:52] what his dad asked him to do and so
[1:09:54] he brings the bread and cheeses over and
[1:09:56] and he kind of gets a little
[1:09:58] uh uh uh a view of what's going on and
[1:10:00] he
[1:10:01] he hears about this champion making his
[1:10:03] boast
[1:10:07] and dave was like huh did i did i hear
[1:10:10] that right
[1:10:11] what what what did he say
[1:10:17] did i hear that right so so
[1:10:20] he said that if if anybody can beat him
[1:10:23] then they'll serve us and if if they
[1:10:25] beat us we'll serve them
[1:10:26] who is this guy to find the armies of
[1:10:29] the living god
[1:10:31] oh david was was willing
[1:10:35] to stand for what he believed but then
[1:10:38] his own brothers in in the church said
[1:10:41] who do you think you are
[1:10:43] come on you the only reason why you've
[1:10:46] come down here today
[1:10:49] is because you just wanted to be a
[1:10:51] little ornery and you just
[1:10:52] wanted to come spy on the battle
[1:10:56] you just wanted to get away from your
[1:10:58] regular uh uh
[1:10:59] routine and get away from your your
[1:11:01] regular duties and you just wanted to be
[1:11:03] a little mischievous
[1:11:05] and come on down here and just peek in
[1:11:07] on the battle and get a little
[1:11:08] entertainment
[1:11:09] but what they didn't realize david
[1:11:11] wasn't a bystander
[1:11:13] david wasn't a warmer matter of
[1:11:15] fact david was the main character in the
[1:11:16] story
[1:11:18] they didn't realize that he had been
[1:11:19] anointed by god but
[1:11:21] david was just going about his normal
[1:11:24] regular day he was
[1:11:26] just doing the dishes doing the laundry
[1:11:29] doing what his father
[1:11:30] paid him to do and it was in him doing
[1:11:33] the normal things
[1:11:34] that brought him into a place where god
[1:11:36] could use them in the big things
[1:11:40] and here he is there his brothers are
[1:11:42] telling them oh no
[1:11:44] you're just down here to to uh
[1:11:47] to spy on the battle and and you're
[1:11:50] you're not here to do anything he's like
[1:11:51] no
[1:11:52] no no if i heard it right this guy is
[1:11:55] defying the armies of the living god
[1:12:00] what will be done unto the man
[1:12:04] that will kill this guy oh he'll he'll
[1:12:06] give houses and lands and his father's
[1:12:08] land will be free in the house of israel
[1:12:09] and he'll even get the
[1:12:10] the the daughters you get the king's
[1:12:13] daughter
[1:12:14] david said sign me up
[1:12:18] not because the reward because he was
[1:12:22] not willing that someone would defy the
[1:12:24] word of god
[1:12:26] and i wonder if we've gotten so coward
[1:12:28] and so backboned
[1:12:29] and so scared of the socialist injustice
[1:12:31] this day
[1:12:32] that when people are pressuring you to
[1:12:35] pick a side
[1:12:36] people are pressuring you to take up the
[1:12:38] causes and the injustice
[1:12:40] and asking you how you feel you're too
[1:12:42] coward to let them know where you stand
[1:12:45] because you're afraid of these social
[1:12:48] injustices turning their guns on you
[1:12:53] oh i don't i don't want to really i
[1:12:56] don't really want to say that i'm a
[1:12:57] christian
[1:12:58] i don't really want to start uh
[1:12:59] testifying that god said he when he
[1:13:01] created
[1:13:02] uh he created a male and female or if i
[1:13:05] start to speak the word of god
[1:13:06] i'm gonna get these social injustice
[1:13:08] pointed it's gonna ruin my career
[1:13:10] it's gonna ruin my social standing at
[1:13:12] high school i'll never get the job i
[1:13:14] want
[1:13:15] oh don't worry life is about a vapor
[1:13:17] here he said if you're going to be
[1:13:18] ashamed of me
[1:13:19] i'll be ashamed of you i don't need no
[1:13:21] job on this earth
[1:13:22] i don't need anything this world can
[1:13:24] offer all i want is what he's offered me
[1:13:27] and that's eternity nothing can take
[1:13:29] that away
[1:13:32] oh a tent or a cottage i don't care
[1:13:33] whatever it be on this side lord
[1:13:35] let me stand for you
[1:13:42] so then he says no so he gets to the
[1:13:44] king
[1:13:46] saul there and saul's like man david
[1:13:50] david you're just a young person
[1:13:55] you're just in the youth group
[1:13:58] come on man you're you're just you're
[1:14:00] just
[1:14:02] you're too young to get baptized
[1:14:05] you're too young to live a victorious
[1:14:07] life
[1:14:10] look david was just a young person
[1:14:11] packing a bag ice to the youth meetings
[1:14:16] david was just a young person that said
[1:14:18] hey i'll bring coke
[1:14:21] david was like just a young person say
[1:14:22] what can i do to help out
[1:14:25] david was just a young person going
[1:14:27] about his father's business
[1:14:29] and here he's testifying
[1:14:32] no no king saul no when i was out there
[1:14:35] at school the other day
[1:14:36] i actually witnessed to my friends and i
[1:14:38] stood up against all the stuff they were
[1:14:40] trying to push on me and i said jesus
[1:14:42] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:14:43] forever
[1:14:45] oh you might not be slaying a physical
[1:14:47] line you know it might be
[1:14:48] slaying a physical bear but there is
[1:14:50] young people that god is raising up
[1:14:52] right now
[1:14:53] that are willing to stand for this
[1:14:55] message
[1:14:56] you might not be slaying a physical line
[1:14:58] or a physical deadline but you're
[1:15:00] slaying demons
[1:15:01] you're standing in the face of ladies
[1:15:03] and say my god it's real
[1:15:08] people probably standing around like
[1:15:10] david
[1:15:12] he says he killed a lion and a bear he
[1:15:15] says he's justified and sanctified and
[1:15:17] god's the holy ghost
[1:15:18] i highly doubt it but you know what i
[1:15:21] love about this story
[1:15:23] god gives us an opportunity to prove
[1:15:25] what we got
[1:15:28] don't be afraid of it welcome it yes
[1:15:32] if you've got god on the inside god's
[1:15:34] going to let you come into a trial or
[1:15:36] come into an hour
[1:15:37] that you can prove that god's on the
[1:15:39] inside
[1:15:41] and they started looking at dave like
[1:15:42] yeah this guy did you hear what he said
[1:15:44] he said he killed a line with his bare
[1:15:45] hands
[1:15:46] he said he killed killed a a a a a a
[1:15:50] bear in a lion just just just ripped
[1:15:52] them apart really this guy said that
[1:15:54] and here's the that's all the brothers
[1:15:56] and the people in the camp
[1:15:57] and here's his own king saying you know
[1:15:58] what
[1:16:01] david you're just a youth and this guy's
[1:16:03] been a man of war from his youth
[1:16:08] you think that wavered david david said
[1:16:10] nah
[1:16:13] the same god that was with me at school
[1:16:16] the same god that helped me keep an
[1:16:18] atmosphere in my home the same god
[1:16:20] that's kept me all this year
[1:16:22] he's the same god that's going to keep
[1:16:24] me in this trial
[1:16:28] he said i'll go and saul said all right
[1:16:30] well
[1:16:31] why don't why don't you try this why
[1:16:34] don't you try out my armor here
[1:16:36] why don't you uh uh put on this helmet
[1:16:39] and put on this
[1:16:40] uh uh a little vest here
[1:16:45] he started to put on all this armor and
[1:16:47] everything dave's like no uh i can't do
[1:16:48] it
[1:16:50] i haven't proved it i don't need this
[1:16:52] intellectual garbage i don't need this
[1:16:54] ecclesiastical outfit
[1:16:56] i'm just gonna go in the way that god
[1:16:58] called me and i'm gonna run out to the
[1:17:00] battle
[1:17:03] and all of the people that were doubting
[1:17:05] them
[1:17:06] were saying yeah i i i bet he i bet he
[1:17:09] never even
[1:17:10] i bet he never even killed a lion or
[1:17:12] killed a bear
[1:17:14] well they were they were about to find
[1:17:16] out whether he knew what he was talking
[1:17:17] about
[1:17:21] you say you got the holy ghost you say
[1:17:22] you were blessed in the meeting
[1:17:25] i want to say it this way you know what
[1:17:29] what david had at home he brought to the
[1:17:30] church meeting
[1:17:36] hey man and i'll say this maybe you feel
[1:17:38] like you didn't show up with anything
[1:17:40] that's okay get something and take it
[1:17:43] home
[1:17:46] but i promise you something if you say
[1:17:48] you got something
[1:17:50] you're gonna be tested to see if you got
[1:17:51] it or not
[1:18:00] we read in the easter seal where brother
[1:18:03] branham made that
[1:18:04] statement about believers confessing
[1:18:08] but we want to be believers in
[1:18:09] possession
[1:18:11] that was the difference about david
[1:18:15] david possessed his confession
[1:18:18] and we want to get to a place where the
[1:18:20] spirit of god is so moving
[1:18:22] in our lives that we're in possession of
[1:18:25] what we're
[1:18:26] confessing the prophet of god would say
[1:18:29] this he
[1:18:30] he said
[1:18:34] what's the matter the church is
[1:18:35] manufacturing herself
[1:18:38] something just like eve tried to do
[1:18:41] see what happens if david would have
[1:18:43] stood there and said you know what
[1:18:46] that's true you're right saul i'm just a
[1:18:48] youth
[1:18:49] and it was a different terrain and
[1:18:51] everything and i was just being a
[1:18:52] shepherd out there watching after my
[1:18:54] sheep
[1:18:54] but you know what go ahead and give me
[1:18:58] all this army and i'll try to go out
[1:18:59] there
[1:19:01] david would have been trying to be a put
[1:19:03] on he'd have been trying to manifest
[1:19:05] something that he wasn't called to be
[1:19:08] he'd be trying to manufacture a warfare
[1:19:11] that god didn't call him to
[1:19:13] and the prophet of god is saying that
[1:19:15] right here he goes what's the matter the
[1:19:16] church is manufacturing herself
[1:19:18] something just like eve tried to do
[1:19:20] she tried to have more light to
[1:19:22] manufacture something he says we've done
[1:19:24] the same thing
[1:19:25] trying to make something in ourselves
[1:19:28] keep your hand off of it
[1:19:30] let god do it take his word
[1:19:33] and believe it hold it in your heart
[1:19:36] and when the rain begins to fall life
[1:19:39] will take hold
[1:19:40] and the word will manifest itself
[1:19:44] you just keep doing what god's called
[1:19:46] you to do
[1:19:47] do it with all your heart you might not
[1:19:49] feel like you're
[1:19:50] you're in the limelight and you're doing
[1:19:52] all the big things and maybe you feel
[1:19:53] like you're like david you're just
[1:19:54] tending the sheep or you're
[1:19:56] you're just packing some food down the
[1:19:58] road a little bed basket while
[1:19:59] everybody's out there
[1:20:00] uh fighting in the army of god but you
[1:20:03] got to do your part
[1:20:04] you know something that struck struck me
[1:20:06] in my heart as i was thinking about this
[1:20:08] is that was david was commissioned by
[1:20:10] his father to take the bread and the
[1:20:12] cheese down to the battle
[1:20:14] but you know i say the person who
[1:20:16] actually made the bread and the cheese
[1:20:18] had a part in the story too
[1:20:22] from the time however the grain was
[1:20:24] harvested and ruled out
[1:20:26] to that mother that was in there and
[1:20:28] baking that bread and making that
[1:20:30] she had a part in cutting off goliath's
[1:20:32] head
[1:20:33] because that was part of the reason
[1:20:34] david was down there and many of us
[1:20:37] you have a part to play if it's if it's
[1:20:39] at home in your prayer closet or which
[1:20:41] it's making a phone call you got a great
[1:20:43] part in all of this
[1:20:45] don't let satan belittle your part in
[1:20:47] the economy of god
[1:20:49] every single part is the purpose of that
[1:20:52] seed that god has placed here that has
[1:20:54] to play out its part
[1:20:55] it has to serve its purpose and i want
[1:20:58] to encourage you that you're serving
[1:20:59] your purpose
[1:21:02] just move on a little bit here reading
[1:21:04] out of the easter seal he says now
[1:21:11] it is the spirit that quickens it's not
[1:21:14] the word that quickens
[1:21:16] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[1:21:19] or gives the word
[1:21:20] life gives it wings to fly
[1:21:23] gives it access it's the spirit that
[1:21:26] does that
[1:21:28] now the weed alone is just a wheat
[1:21:32] but when the quickening life gets into
[1:21:34] it
[1:21:35] listen to this now he's talking about
[1:21:37] you
[1:21:40] this ain't some fancy story for somebody
[1:21:42] else
[1:21:43] okay you're the wheat seed that god has
[1:21:46] planted in lady osea
[1:21:48] you were predestinated to be here
[1:21:52] for this hour for this time for this
[1:21:54] service
[1:21:56] and god has called you to get the
[1:21:57] quickening life quickening power
[1:22:00] into that wheat seed now the wheat alone
[1:22:03] is just wheat but when the quickening
[1:22:05] life gets into it into the wheat
[1:22:07] then it gives it life and we which were
[1:22:10] once dead made in the image of god
[1:22:12] and yet dead in sin and trespass there's
[1:22:15] some way god
[1:22:16] had to get this quickening life into
[1:22:18] your mortal bodies
[1:22:20] i'm talking about your body
[1:22:24] he's talking about your body all right
[1:22:27] you're the main character of this story
[1:22:28] tonight
[1:22:30] why don't we all just raise our hand
[1:22:32] everybody in here raise your hand
[1:22:35] oh man everybody's not participating
[1:22:38] you're the main character of this story
[1:22:40] right now all right
[1:22:42] god's talking to you
[1:22:46] god is wanting to get that quickening
[1:22:47] life into your mortal bodies
[1:22:49] he says now jesus was the word you
[1:22:52] believe that don't you
[1:22:54] in the beginning saint john 1 in the
[1:22:55] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:22:57] with god and the word was god
[1:22:59] and was made flesh and dwelt among us he
[1:23:02] goes on into uh
[1:23:04] paragraph 56 and he says that jesus was
[1:23:06] predestinated
[1:23:08] he was the predestinated word he was the
[1:23:11] word that was
[1:23:12] quickened for that hour so if jesus was
[1:23:16] the predestinated word and he was the
[1:23:18] word made manifest and he was the word
[1:23:20] quickened for that hour then what are
[1:23:22] you
[1:23:24] you also are the predestinated word
[1:23:28] that god has placed here at this time
[1:23:31] in this hour that you also would be the
[1:23:35] word that's quickened for this hour
[1:23:40] i'll just move a little bit further here
[1:23:45] brother branham strikes on
[1:23:46] predestination here referring to romans
[1:23:48] 8 30. he says
[1:23:50] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:23:53] he also called on whom he called them he
[1:23:55] also
[1:23:55] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:23:58] also glorified
[1:23:59] i just want to grab a few quotes out of
[1:24:01] the spoken word as the original seed
[1:24:04] he says well that's the same thing from
[1:24:07] predestination
[1:24:09] you were supposed to be here in the
[1:24:11] right way
[1:24:12] at the beginning but being that you come
[1:24:15] the way
[1:24:16] you did you're subject to the fall but
[1:24:19] being that you're predestinated
[1:24:21] you hear the word it brings you right
[1:24:25] back
[1:24:25] where you were predestinated amen never
[1:24:28] saw that before
[1:24:30] all right rewind let's let's read this
[1:24:32] again i mean the prophet says i never
[1:24:34] saw that before it makes me go what
[1:24:38] but being that you're predestinated you
[1:24:40] hear the word
[1:24:41] it brings you right back where you were
[1:24:44] predestinated
[1:24:45] amen never saw that before what what
[1:24:48] makes you believe the word of god
[1:24:50] and turn down these other things
[1:24:54] there is something in you
[1:24:59] well we might as well come unglued and
[1:25:01] run laps around the church
[1:25:04] there's something in you you can't even
[1:25:07] help it
[1:25:11] okay you keep wondering if you're gonna
[1:25:12] make it
[1:25:14] you keep wondering if you're the bride
[1:25:16] you keep wondering if you're elected
[1:25:18] you keep wondering if you're pre-that's
[1:25:20] why you're here
[1:25:22] there's something in you it's
[1:25:26] keeping you
[1:25:30] you're predestinated to it
[1:25:34] there is something in you way back
[1:25:38] yonder
[1:25:40] what you are made to live here forever
[1:25:45] oh i want a scripture for that preacher
[1:25:46] all right here it comes all that he
[1:25:48] foreknew
[1:25:50] glory he called all that he has called
[1:25:53] he has justified
[1:25:55] and all he has justified he is already
[1:25:58] glorified i was just thinking of the
[1:26:00] scripture he says all
[1:26:02] that he is already glorified it made me
[1:26:04] think of what what jesus says there i
[1:26:06] believe in john 17 5
[1:26:07] it says lord glorify me with what
[1:26:11] the glory i had with you in the
[1:26:13] beginning
[1:26:16] if the brother branham would say that
[1:26:18] jesus was the only man that lived on the
[1:26:21] face of the earth that knew where he
[1:26:22] come from
[1:26:23] he said his mind wasn't darkened to that
[1:26:26] that he could stand there and say to the
[1:26:28] father lord glorify me
[1:26:30] with the glory i had you with you in the
[1:26:33] beginning
[1:26:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:26:36] word was with god and what does the
[1:26:38] scripture say
[1:26:39] the same was in the beginning oh what
[1:26:41] did he what did he say he says let us
[1:26:43] make man in our image
[1:26:44] do you realize you were there with him
[1:26:48] oh and i love how he sees that jesus
[1:26:50] thought it not robbery
[1:26:52] he said let this mind be in you that was
[1:26:54] also in christ jesus
[1:26:56] thinking and not robbery that he would
[1:26:58] be equal with god
[1:26:59] oh we're now living in the hour that the
[1:27:02] very intelligence of god
[1:27:04] the very unveiling of god has come down
[1:27:06] and he's telling you look
[1:27:08] i'm taking you right back to where you
[1:27:10] came from
[1:27:12] oh he's wanting us to catch that
[1:27:14] revelation oh i think we can say now oh
[1:27:17] god
[1:27:18] glorify me with the glory i had with you
[1:27:20] in the beginning
[1:27:21] that's why he has come in this hour as
[1:27:24] he's wanting to take us back to eden
[1:27:27] he wants to take us back to the
[1:27:28] beginning again
[1:27:31] oh that makes me happy
[1:27:34] that gets me excited has nothing to do
[1:27:37] with your works
[1:27:40] no matter how fast you run how high you
[1:27:42] jump how much you shout
[1:27:44] how many pews you can scale doesn't
[1:27:47] matter
[1:27:48] how good you can sing doesn't matter how
[1:27:51] many specials you do
[1:27:53] doesn't matter how good you can play the
[1:27:55] piano how bad you can play the piano
[1:27:59] doesn't matter that you you sound like a
[1:28:01] cricket when you try to sing songs
[1:28:06] you know what matters there's something
[1:28:10] in you uh
[1:28:13] if you if you can't get excited about
[1:28:15] that
[1:28:16] i don't know but when i get into some of
[1:28:18] my darkest hours when i get into some of
[1:28:20] the biggest trials
[1:28:21] when it when it gets when the when the
[1:28:23] going gets really tough
[1:28:25] and you want to talk about job the
[1:28:26] prophet got to a place
[1:28:28] where it was so tough that he had buried
[1:28:30] his wife and now he's holding his little
[1:28:32] baby girl there
[1:28:34] and the black sheep has come down and
[1:28:37] he's just about ready to give up because
[1:28:38] the devil's telling him
[1:28:39] he wasn't there for your dad he died
[1:28:41] your brother died your wife died
[1:28:43] now your baby girl's gonna die oh he
[1:28:44] said he couldn't tell me that god wasn't
[1:28:46] real
[1:28:46] i'd seen way too much but what he will
[1:28:49] do is he'll tell you that god don't love
[1:28:51] you
[1:28:51] you don't think he's trying the same
[1:28:53] thing tonight he keeps trying to tell
[1:28:55] you that nobody loves you
[1:28:56] that nobody's interested into you that
[1:28:59] you don't have any friends in the church
[1:29:01] that you're not important he's trying
[1:29:03] the same tactic to you
[1:29:05] to try to discourage and have you throw
[1:29:07] in the towel and some of you are sitting
[1:29:09] here this night
[1:29:10] and you're just wondering how much
[1:29:12] longer you're gonna hang in there
[1:29:13] but i want to tell you there's something
[1:29:16] in you
[1:29:17] it's holding you it's keeping you you
[1:29:20] can't fail
[1:29:21] you're predestinated not to fall
[1:29:25] and in that darkest hour when he was
[1:29:27] ready to throw up his hands oh that
[1:29:29] anchor caught
[1:29:30] though he slayed me yet i'll serve him
[1:29:33] oh we're talking about quickening power
[1:29:36] oh god let that life be quickened in me
[1:29:40] that in the face of all adversary in the
[1:29:42] face of all trial
[1:29:44] i can stand there and not waver and
[1:29:46] profess that you're the same
[1:29:48] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:51] might have loved ones that are sick you
[1:29:53] might have lost loved ones
[1:29:55] you might feel like god didn't answer
[1:29:56] your prayer oh praise god there's
[1:29:59] something in you
[1:30:02] you want to know what that something is
[1:30:07] you think david killed goliath
[1:30:11] it was the word anointed in david
[1:30:16] that killed he had been anointed to be
[1:30:19] king over
[1:30:20] israel the spirit of the lord was upon
[1:30:22] him you think
[1:30:23] you think goliath could have killed
[1:30:24] david no chance
[1:30:27] if goliath could have killed david he
[1:30:29] would have killed the word
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] you think the devil can kill you you
[1:30:35] think he can put you down
[1:30:37] you think the devil can overcome you no
[1:30:39] for you the word
[1:30:41] he can't overcome you are more than an
[1:30:43] overcomer
[1:30:44] you're more than a conqueror in jesus
[1:30:46] christ oh
[1:30:48] hallelujah praise god
[1:30:55] praise god doesn't have anything to do
[1:30:57] with your works
[1:31:00] though we know james comes around and
[1:31:01] says all right well you say you got
[1:31:03] faith i'll show you my faith by my works
[1:31:08] david went there confessing right
[1:31:11] i got faith killed a lion killed a bear
[1:31:15] well guess what prove your faith by your
[1:31:17] works he did it
[1:31:20] a young a young boy a youth who was just
[1:31:23] packing a bag of ice to the youth
[1:31:25] meeting
[1:31:26] went on down there and cut off goliath's
[1:31:28] head he started a revival in the church
[1:31:31] that's what we need we need some young
[1:31:33] people we need some old people
[1:31:35] we need some people that say oh god
[1:31:37] restore unto me
[1:31:38] the joy of my salvation restore unto me
[1:31:42] that first love lord oh like that first
[1:31:45] meeting i had with you
[1:31:46] oh god where my wings were set i was
[1:31:48] soaring above the clouds
[1:31:50] i was soaring above all the all the
[1:31:52] troubles lord but the storms come lord
[1:31:55] it pressed me down into the valley i got
[1:31:57] i got little scales over my eyes
[1:31:59] i got some film that's filmed over my
[1:32:01] beak i feel like i can't even eat the
[1:32:03] word of god
[1:32:04] oh that the church house has gathered
[1:32:06] together the spirit of god is here
[1:32:08] to take off that film off your eyes to
[1:32:11] break the scale off your beak
[1:32:12] that you can feed on the body words ton
[1:32:14] of man oh
[1:32:16] hallelujah i'm so glad about it
[1:32:19] oh i might look a little crazy up here
[1:32:21] but i know what i'm talking about
[1:32:22] i've been in a valley once or twice i've
[1:32:24] been pushed way down by a storm
[1:32:26] i thought i'd never get down get out of
[1:32:28] there all the god rich and mercy
[1:32:31] by his holy ghost coming lifting me out
[1:32:32] of the valley
[1:32:35] oh if you ever been there you got
[1:32:37] something to talk about
[1:32:39] you got something to shout about you
[1:32:41] ain't afraid to testify a word
[1:32:44] he would say to them all people are
[1:32:46] trying to say they got it
[1:32:48] because of their works jesus would say
[1:32:50] many will say to me in that day
[1:32:54] lord have we not done many great mighty
[1:32:56] works with thy name
[1:33:01] he's going to say no well depart from me
[1:33:04] i never knew you
[1:33:06] you were not with me in the beginning
[1:33:12] they'll cast out more devils than you
[1:33:15] they'll have more church revivals than
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:17] they'll have more uh pantries open more
[1:33:20] more food banks
[1:33:21] you think you can compete with
[1:33:23] denominations
[1:33:26] yes get that out of your thinking i can
[1:33:29] take you to a few places
[1:33:31] their food banks are 10 times bigger in
[1:33:33] our church
[1:33:36] some of their food banks and their
[1:33:38] program help places
[1:33:40] with the real estate they're sitting on
[1:33:41] down over there
[1:33:44] i mean some of that stuff where most of
[1:33:46] our houses put together
[1:33:49] we're not here to compete with the
[1:33:50] denominationals we're not here to
[1:33:52] compete with the pentecostals
[1:33:53] we're not here to compete with anything
[1:33:55] we're here to defeat the devil
[1:34:00] many will come to me and say lord have
[1:34:02] we not done many great mighty things
[1:34:04] in your name you'll say depart from me
[1:34:05] you does of iniquity
[1:34:07] but it's those that were with him in the
[1:34:09] beginning those
[1:34:10] that were with him in his thoughts that
[1:34:13] are eternal
[1:34:14] just moving towards a close really quick
[1:34:16] the prophet would say
[1:34:19] all right well if it's all predestinated
[1:34:22] posing a question just maybe dramatizing
[1:34:24] a little bit coming off of this him
[1:34:26] talking about predestination
[1:34:28] i wonder if you've ever heard this
[1:34:30] before well then what's the use in
[1:34:32] preaching
[1:34:36] well you know if it's all predestinated
[1:34:38] and
[1:34:39] i really can't miss it then
[1:34:43] really doesn't matter what i do
[1:34:47] oh my listen to that devil
[1:34:50] oh my goodness he wants to talk you
[1:34:53] right out of your salvation
[1:34:55] and if you start listening to him you'll
[1:34:58] find yourself in a whole lot of trouble
[1:35:01] and because there's something in you
[1:35:03] you're going to be so miserable over
[1:35:04] there wearing the clothes of the world
[1:35:06] and going to their movie
[1:35:07] things in their theaters and following
[1:35:09] all their stuff and doing all that
[1:35:11] you're going to feel so defiled and so
[1:35:13] lost and so helpless one day
[1:35:14] that you're finally going to cry out
[1:35:16] because god is faithful to you and he
[1:35:17] said if you call in the name of the lord
[1:35:18] you shall be saved
[1:35:19] and he will rescue you but you can the
[1:35:22] prophet said you can save god a lot of
[1:35:24] trouble in yourself a lot of trouble
[1:35:26] if you just surrender to him i say god
[1:35:28] help us to surrender what's the use of
[1:35:30] preaching brother branham
[1:35:31] he said he said there is a crop out
[1:35:34] there
[1:35:34] only thing i'm doing is saying i'm just
[1:35:37] throwing it out there and see where it
[1:35:39] goes
[1:35:40] if they're are repellent the grease of
[1:35:42] the muck of the world and the
[1:35:43] denominations throw it off i can't help
[1:35:45] it
[1:35:45] but if there's one out there that can
[1:35:47] absorb it
[1:35:49] he'll turn to be a son and daughter of
[1:35:51] god just as sure as the world amen
[1:35:54] because it's predestinated he said i'm
[1:35:57] just
[1:35:58] fishing i'm just throwing out the line
[1:36:00] i'm just sowing the
[1:36:01] sowing the gospel net yeah you get a lot
[1:36:03] of fun you cashed out a net in the ocean
[1:36:05] you know people might be out there
[1:36:06] trying to catch crab or they're out
[1:36:07] there trying to catch tuna or something
[1:36:09] they do those huge staining nets and
[1:36:11] they pull them all in you think the only
[1:36:12] thing they got in the nets is just a
[1:36:14] bunch of well-cleaned
[1:36:15] ready fishes there's a bunch of seaweed
[1:36:19] seaweed and muck and critters in there
[1:36:22] and
[1:36:22] and i mean some some some some creatures
[1:36:25] that look you know
[1:36:26] pretty funny some ones that'll hurt you
[1:36:28] some that are pretty great but that's
[1:36:30] what the gospel net does
[1:36:32] that's what brother brandon would always
[1:36:33] say you have three types of believers
[1:36:34] make believers unbelievers and true
[1:36:36] believers in every
[1:36:37] a group of people just moving along he
[1:36:40] says that's the reason that god could
[1:36:41] work his works through jesus
[1:36:43] we're speaking a little bit about
[1:36:44] predestination we're moving towards a
[1:36:46] close quickly
[1:36:48] he said that's the reason god could work
[1:36:50] through jesus
[1:36:51] he was a predestinated son now i want to
[1:36:54] read this because i want you to
[1:36:55] recognize
[1:36:56] yourself in the word right jesus was our
[1:36:59] example
[1:37:00] he was the word made flesh we're bone of
[1:37:02] his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:37:04] she is him so then what he did the bride
[1:37:07] does
[1:37:08] so then we need to identify ourselves in
[1:37:09] the word that was the purpose of the
[1:37:11] teaching right oh when our
[1:37:12] pastor started he said i've got about an
[1:37:13] hour an hour in me boys
[1:37:15] go along with it that's what brandon
[1:37:18] says we just want to be able to get
[1:37:19] there but brother branham and the spoken
[1:37:21] word is the original seed he says all
[1:37:22] these people saying
[1:37:23] oh i'll pour out my spirit upon all the
[1:37:25] flesh and all the manifestations of the
[1:37:27] latter rain
[1:37:28] he said they're saying all that he said
[1:37:29] it's nonsense
[1:37:31] he said you can't have the latter rain
[1:37:32] until you have the spring rain the
[1:37:34] teaching rain
[1:37:35] because it's the teaching rain that sows
[1:37:37] the seed
[1:37:38] he said in the end time side seed he
[1:37:40] says the denominational seed has been
[1:37:42] sown
[1:37:43] the pentecostal seed has been sown but
[1:37:46] the word seed has been
[1:37:48] sown but there has to come a harvest
[1:37:50] time
[1:37:51] there has to come a harvest rain or a
[1:37:54] rapturing
[1:37:55] faith oh my
[1:37:58] oh my now we start to get into the
[1:38:00] purposes of is appearing in the opening
[1:38:02] of those seals and that word
[1:38:04] that was broke open it was to bring this
[1:38:08] this church into manifestation because
[1:38:10] without that
[1:38:12] we don't have this oh glory to god oh
[1:38:15] that ought to make you shout right there
[1:38:17] hallelujah that's the reason god could
[1:38:20] work
[1:38:21] work his works through jesus he was the
[1:38:23] predestinated son
[1:38:25] he was the lamb slain before the
[1:38:26] foundation of the world
[1:38:28] before a hundred billion trillion years
[1:38:31] ago
[1:38:32] that we said genesis 1 spoke of a while
[1:38:34] ago he was right
[1:38:36] then predestinated to take his place
[1:38:40] when was jesus christ predestinated take
[1:38:42] his place
[1:38:45] then when were you predestinated to take
[1:38:47] your place
[1:38:49] and you think and you and you're worried
[1:38:52] if you're ever going to take your place
[1:38:54] and you're worried if you're ever going
[1:38:55] to come to adoption and you're worried
[1:38:57] if you're ever going to fulfill your
[1:38:58] purpose
[1:38:59] you were predestinated to fulfill your
[1:39:02] purpose and lady
[1:39:04] odyssey before the world was ever
[1:39:06] created
[1:39:07] he was right then predestinated to take
[1:39:09] his place amen that's the reason
[1:39:11] the the will of the father he did he was
[1:39:13] the word made manifest
[1:39:15] and every one of the other sons will
[1:39:18] have
[1:39:18] the same manifestation and that's the
[1:39:22] ones that was
[1:39:23] predestinated before a hundred billion
[1:39:26] trillion years you were predestinated to
[1:39:29] take your place
[1:39:30] he says right here he says and here we
[1:39:33] are
[1:39:35] we come along and what happens
[1:39:40] i love this we believe it
[1:39:47] that's all brother matthew yep
[1:39:52] yep you come along and while the world
[1:39:55] has nothing
[1:39:56] in them to believe with there's not
[1:39:59] something
[1:40:00] in them like is in you you hear the most
[1:40:03] crazy
[1:40:04] outlandish word that you're eternal with
[1:40:07] god
[1:40:08] before the world was ever formed you
[1:40:10] were predestinated to take your place
[1:40:12] in this church house on a wednesday
[1:40:14] night in june yes
[1:40:17] yes and you come along
[1:40:20] here you are and you say
[1:40:23] amen i believe it
[1:40:27] he says that if you by faith will accept
[1:40:30] what the father all the prophets all the
[1:40:32] word of god he said i will pour this
[1:40:34] life down upon you
[1:40:37] and you can't do nothing else but
[1:40:39] produce the same thing
[1:40:41] that i am now i want to finish right
[1:40:44] here
[1:40:46] oh i love this
[1:40:49] here you are you come along
[1:40:55] the spoken word is the original seed you
[1:40:57] know you're a spoken word
[1:41:00] oh you were with the logos in the
[1:41:02] beginning the very eternal thoughts of
[1:41:05] god
[1:41:06] that were formed into the logos
[1:41:10] you were there and you were
[1:41:13] predestinated
[1:41:15] to take your place in ladies
[1:41:19] where were you job when i lay the
[1:41:21] foundations of the world
[1:41:22] oh when the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:41:24] you were there
[1:41:27] out of the samurai church age the
[1:41:29] prophet of god would say
[1:41:31] as the eternal logos of god was
[1:41:33] manifested in the sun
[1:41:35] he's speaking about jesus the eternal
[1:41:39] logos manifested in jesus christ being
[1:41:41] predestinated
[1:41:42] he says even so we eternal
[1:41:46] in his thoughts in our turn became the
[1:41:49] many members spoken word seed
[1:41:51] manifest in flesh and those eternal
[1:41:54] thoughts
[1:41:55] now manifested in flesh are the sons of
[1:41:57] god
[1:41:59] i want to read that portion as the
[1:42:01] musicians come
[1:42:04] he says even so we
[1:42:08] eternal in his thoughts in
[1:42:11] our turn became the many members spoken
[1:42:14] word seed
[1:42:17] look abraham had his turn
[1:42:23] elijah had his turn
[1:42:26] david had his turn
[1:42:30] they were the very thoughts of god the
[1:42:32] very spoken words of god
[1:42:34] made flesh and their hour
[1:42:38] and their day they had their turn
[1:42:42] brother branham had his turn but i want
[1:42:45] to tell you
[1:42:46] it's our turn now it's your turn
[1:42:50] you are predestinated to be here in this
[1:42:53] hour to manifest the word of god oh it's
[1:42:56] your turn
[1:42:57] it's bride time it's eagle age it's
[1:43:00] rapture age
[1:43:01] it's harvest time it's going home time
[1:43:04] it's in a twinkling of a moment tonight
[1:43:06] you'll be change time
[1:43:07] let's all stand to our feet oh
[1:43:09] hallelujah
[1:43:13] glory to god hallelujah
[1:43:16] oh praise god the prophet of god said
[1:43:20] maybe my faith
[1:43:23] won't climb where enoch climbed
[1:43:26] but he said i certainly wouldn't stop
[1:43:28] and get in anybody's way who thought
[1:43:30] they could climb there
[1:43:32] i say maybe we need to stop doubting one
[1:43:34] another
[1:43:36] and start believing in one another and
[1:43:38] say you know what brother you're
[1:43:39] believing to be healed if you can play
[1:43:41] something softly
[1:43:42] i'm going to believe with you i think a
[1:43:44] lot of times we're shrouded with doubt
[1:43:46] of one another
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:50] i think we're just wondering and we're
[1:43:51] doubting and i wonder if they really are
[1:43:53] bordering i wonder if they really got an
[1:43:55] experience i wonder whether i wonder if
[1:43:57] they're sanctified i wonder if they're
[1:43:58] living in a holy ghost field i will quit
[1:43:59] wondering
[1:44:00] why don't you keep believing for them
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:04] the problem you're doubting so much is
[1:44:06] because you're probably hung up with the
[1:44:08] same doubt in your life
[1:44:09] that's the reason you ain't got to pray
[1:44:10] your life
[1:44:12] that's the reason you're so caught up
[1:44:14] with news and entertainment and the
[1:44:15] things of the world
[1:44:16] because you ain't got no victory in your
[1:44:18] life you're trying to look at somebody
[1:44:19] else that don't have victory to make you
[1:44:21] feel a little better
[1:44:22] uh-oh where did that come from i'm
[1:44:26] talking about quickening power
[1:44:27] i'm talking about uh if if this branch
[1:44:31] if this vine never puts forth another
[1:44:33] branch it'll be like the original
[1:44:36] but it's our turn it's our time
[1:44:42] i say out of my way devil
[1:44:46] it's my turn my time
[1:44:49] david wrote a mighty work in israel he
[1:44:52] cut
[1:44:52] goliath's head off he served his purpose
[1:44:56] i can see all the bible characters down
[1:44:58] through time they serve their purpose
[1:45:00] what about me lord here i am
[1:45:03] is there somebody here that will say
[1:45:04] lord i want to serve my purpose
[1:45:10] that's the purpose the word has been
[1:45:11] manifested in this hour that's the
[1:45:13] purpose of his appearing
[1:45:14] is to bring forth the potential that's
[1:45:17] in your life
[1:45:23] this is a present tense message
[1:45:26] an on-time message all right now message
[1:45:32] i end with on this thought here our
[1:45:35] pastor read this
[1:45:36] at the end of the morning service out of
[1:45:38] the easter seal he said it's the hour
[1:45:40] that
[1:45:41] is what makes the creation in you
[1:45:45] you think of abraham and sarah
[1:45:48] abraham had been believing all those
[1:45:50] years
[1:45:52] he'd been believing all those years the
[1:45:54] word
[1:45:55] he'd be believing all those years for
[1:45:57] the promise
[1:45:58] and it seemed like when the time came
[1:46:00] where it was too late
[1:46:05] looked like they missed their
[1:46:06] opportunity i wonder if you feel that
[1:46:09] way about something
[1:46:11] maybe you feel it's too late and you've
[1:46:12] missed your opportunity
[1:46:17] there abraham and sarah they had
[1:46:18] received the word they believed the word
[1:46:21] and they never wavered on that word
[1:46:24] imagine how abraham felt and how sarah
[1:46:27] felt
[1:46:29] lord you said you gave me the promise
[1:46:34] but god allowed it to get so dark
[1:46:38] where their trial seemed like an
[1:46:40] impossibility
[1:46:42] but you know what i love about that
[1:46:44] story
[1:46:46] their impossibility was god's
[1:46:47] opportunity
[1:46:50] and of all of a sudden though the planes
[1:46:52] of memory
[1:46:55] sarah's womb dried up abraham was too
[1:46:59] old
[1:47:01] they were believing the promised word
[1:47:02] but there was just seemed like all hope
[1:47:04] was lost
[1:47:08] but there come elohim there come
[1:47:11] melchizedek walking up to him in the
[1:47:12] tent door
[1:47:17] where's your wife abraham
[1:47:22] according to the time of life you're
[1:47:24] going to have a son
[1:47:29] he stated the purpose of his appearance
[1:47:31] he said i'm going to visit you
[1:47:33] according to the time of life
[1:47:36] saints do you realize the lord has
[1:47:38] visited us in this generation
[1:47:40] and every promised word that you read in
[1:47:43] the message and in this bible
[1:47:45] it's your turn to manifest that word
[1:47:49] that's the purpose of the rising of the
[1:47:52] sun that's the purpose of the unveiling
[1:47:54] of god
[1:47:55] is to bring the seeds that were sown in
[1:47:57] lady aussie
[1:47:58] in the manifestation let's just pray
[1:48:02] heavenly father we just approach you at
[1:48:04] the end of the service
[1:48:11] lord we just want to tell you that we
[1:48:12] love you
[1:48:15] that we thank you for your grace we
[1:48:17] thank you for your mercy
[1:48:19] lord sometimes we make the message so
[1:48:21] complicated
[1:48:24] sometimes we make it so difficult lord
[1:48:26] and we
[1:48:28] try to run out on every limb trying to
[1:48:30] understand everything and we forget lord
[1:48:33] that you just want to have communion
[1:48:36] sometimes lord we're busy with things
[1:48:39] that are right and
[1:48:40] we're busy with the church house we're
[1:48:43] busy with family but
[1:48:45] there you are lord with dirty feet
[1:48:49] lord may we get back to the
[1:48:53] the reality of this message
[1:48:57] lord back to the love relationship with
[1:49:00] you
[1:49:01] back to the very purpose you unveiled
[1:49:03] yourself in this hour was
[1:49:05] that you could be united together with
[1:49:07] your bride
[1:49:09] lord we let the cares of this world and
[1:49:11] we let things
[1:49:13] choke the spirit out of our lives
[1:49:17] maybe lord there's somebody here that
[1:49:19] wants to lift their hand up and say lord
[1:49:21] jesus
[1:49:24] i want that love relationship back lord
