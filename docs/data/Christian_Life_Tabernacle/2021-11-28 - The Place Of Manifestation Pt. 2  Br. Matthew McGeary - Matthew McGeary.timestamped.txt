[26:24] to thank you for your grace
[26:26] [Music]
[26:28] lord if we started to think back
[26:32] at what we could have been
[26:35] maybe where we would be today if you
[26:37] didn't come by our way lord
[26:41] oh god our minds don't even like to go
[26:44] there
[26:46] the lord you met us in our time of need
[26:50] and we're so thankful tonight to be able
[26:52] to rejoice and to tell you that we love
[26:54] you
[26:55] that we thank you that we appreciate
[26:57] your god
[26:59] lord we just want to take a little time
[27:01] now to
[27:03] look into your word and ask that you
[27:04] would just come by this evening lord
[27:08] just whisper
[27:09] little love secrets into the
[27:12] ear of your bride that they might be
[27:13] encouraged tonight
[27:15] or maybe we can
[27:17] speak back to you lord in our heart as
[27:21] maybe the thought would come forward
[27:23] that we could start to rejoice
[27:26] and we can start to thank you for your
[27:28] great love that you've loved us with we
[27:30] pray
[27:31] lord we just ask now
[27:33] you take complete control of the service
[27:35] and jesus christ's name we ask it
[27:38] amen hallelujah
[27:41] praise the lord
[27:42] amen thank you musicians
[27:46] amen we'll just turn in our bibles to
[27:48] deuteronomy 16.
[27:52] once again i say bear with me
[27:55] i'm a little hoarse but
[28:02] i don't imagine being too long tonight
[28:04] but
[28:05] we just maybe want to look in here and
[28:07] see if something can be said that would
[28:09] encourage you
[28:10] i believe if you've come expecting just
[28:13] in the reading of the word or a reading
[28:15] of a quote god can god can speak to you
[28:19] and so we're thankful for that and
[28:21] uh just to continue
[28:24] um
[28:25] along the lines of where we were just
[28:27] reading in deuteronomy 16 and we'll just
[28:30] read verse 5 and 6 it says thou mayest
[28:33] not sacrifice the passover with any of
[28:35] thy yeats
[28:36] which the lord thy god giveth thee but
[28:39] at the place
[28:40] which the lord thy god shall choose
[28:43] to place his name there shalt thou
[28:45] sacrifice the passover at even and at
[28:47] the going down of the sun
[28:49] at the season that thou camest forth out
[28:52] of egypt amen you may be seated
[28:54] and maybe just to uh try to launch from
[28:58] a little of what we spoke on before
[29:01] we read this quote here out of god's
[29:03] provided place of worship says but we
[29:05] must find
[29:07] where he put his name
[29:09] for it is it is
[29:11] his only provided gate amen glory watch
[29:14] where did he put his name in his son
[29:17] and skipping down he says jesus said i
[29:20] come in my father's name and you receive
[29:22] me not you want the scripture on that
[29:25] saint john 5 43 i came in my father's
[29:28] name and you received me not then the
[29:30] father put his own name which is jesus
[29:34] in the sun
[29:35] and he's the way
[29:37] he's the door
[29:39] he's the house
[29:40] he's where god chose to put his name god
[29:44] never put his name in me
[29:46] never put it in the church he never put
[29:48] it in methodist baptist catholic but he
[29:51] put it in christ the anointed emmanuel
[29:54] immanuel means god with us he put it in
[29:57] christ emmanuel god with us and so we
[30:01] know that we're living in an hour that
[30:03] god has come amongst us and he has
[30:05] manifested in his presence amongst the
[30:07] bride
[30:08] amen god has come amongst us and has
[30:11] manifested his presence amongst the
[30:14] bride as as i'm reminded just in saying
[30:17] that there was a time where the devil
[30:18] was buffeting at the prophet and he
[30:21] there was a demon standing there in his
[30:23] room and he was telling him you're
[30:25] nothing but a bluff
[30:26] he was he was telling the prophet of god
[30:28] who had seen mighty works that was
[30:30] walking with the angel of the lord he
[30:32] was uh one that god was using to
[30:34] interpret his word and there the devil
[30:36] was coming against him and telling him
[30:38] he said nothing of a bluff well i'm
[30:40] encouraged by that because i see how the
[30:42] devil tries to do the same thing against
[30:44] me when i'm trying to make a stand upon
[30:47] the word of god and and i'm looking into
[30:49] the bible and i'm looking into the
[30:50] promises and i'm looking into the
[30:52] message where it speaks of a bride and
[30:54] an overcomer and somebody that's rising
[30:57] up in the end time that's eating the
[30:59] book and taking this message and that's
[31:00] running with it into the the catching
[31:02] away of the bride and and all of these
[31:04] great things that have been spoken and
[31:06] we saw one come to maturity we saw a
[31:09] sheath wave offering come with the power
[31:11] of the spoken word and and dominion over
[31:14] the earth a son of god coming into his
[31:16] position again and that speaks to my
[31:18] heart something in me says that that is
[31:20] me that's what i'm called to be if that
[31:22] was a first one that coming to maturity
[31:25] then i was planted in the same field
[31:27] that good ground that god had placed his
[31:29] seed word in and as i seen the first one
[31:31] what was the chief wave offering it was
[31:34] the first one that come to maturity and
[31:36] so just as we saw jesus christ a first
[31:39] one that came to maturity that was waved
[31:41] over the people away back to them over
[31:43] at pentecost he come into maturity and
[31:45] now we see one amongst us again
[31:47] according to divine promise in the end
[31:50] time that god said that he would restore
[31:52] all things living in an age of
[31:54] restoration not to just restore us back
[31:57] to an age of pentecost there at the
[32:00] beginning of the church ages but god had
[32:02] come back to restore us all the way back
[32:04] to eden all the way back to what adam
[32:07] had lost back to that title deep book of
[32:09] redemption back into the hand of man
[32:11] again back into a place and a position
[32:14] where he had full control and dominion
[32:17] that he could speak the word and it was
[32:19] no longer the man speaking but it was
[32:21] god speaking that is what god is trying
[32:23] to tell the bride of christ tonight that
[32:26] you're coming back into full authority
[32:28] you're coming back into that position
[32:30] you're coming into a maturity that we
[32:32] saw of that first one that came in
[32:34] maturity and something in your heart
[32:36] wants to believe it something in your
[32:38] heart is saying yay and amen to the word
[32:41] something then you say lord i believe it
[32:43] but the but the devil's trying to come
[32:45] and buff it at your flesh and tell you
[32:46] you're nothing but a bluff
[32:48] or where is the mighty works seen in you
[32:52] oh he's trying to tell you but oh i'm
[32:54] i'm so thankful
[32:56] as the prophet of god oh god help me
[32:58] tonight that he would start to preach
[33:00] the breaking of the seals he would start
[33:02] there and preaching god hiding himself
[33:04] in simplicity but what was he speaking
[33:07] of he took the scripture there said
[33:08] despise not the day of small things
[33:11] there was a time where the temple had
[33:13] been torn down and they had come back to
[33:15] rebuild the temple and the men of all
[33:18] that had saw the former tabernacle they
[33:20] wept there because they settled the new
[33:22] tabernacle is not like the old one but
[33:25] he said oh no don't despise the day of
[33:27] simple things we're living in an hour in
[33:30] the third pool where it's not a public
[33:32] show it's not some big dispensation
[33:34] running out and raising the dead and if
[33:36] you're out the hospitals and some big
[33:39] united states revival with all of these
[33:41] evidences and so many things to point to
[33:43] for some type of vindication but there's
[33:46] been a people that have been cut away
[33:48] into a secret place in that third pool
[33:50] where he said i will meet you in there
[33:53] there's something happening there's a
[33:55] change happening just like abraham and
[33:57] sarah had received a promise and day by
[34:00] day they were walking according to the
[34:02] promise because they had met jesus
[34:04] christ they were in the presence of the
[34:06] revealing of melchizedek there and he
[34:09] said according to the time of life and
[34:11] now the bride is walking under the same
[34:14] dispensation by divine promise looking
[34:17] for the day in the hour that your bodies
[34:20] are going to be changed oh and the
[34:22] devil's trying to look at you he's
[34:24] trying to point to you he's trying to
[34:25] tell you you're nothing but a bluff
[34:27] nothing's really happening what's going
[34:29] on in your life oh you you think you're
[34:31] somebody
[34:35] oh where's the mighty words oh oh yeah
[34:37] he come on now he tries to tell you oh
[34:39] that that you shall do the greater well
[34:41] where are the greater works in your life
[34:44] where's the manifestation of the things
[34:46] of god in your life you say you believe
[34:49] the message where's the message in you
[34:52] and he'll start to to corner you
[34:55] into such a way where you start to look
[34:57] at your faults and failures but i'm not
[34:59] so much interested in us looking at
[35:01] maybe our faults and failures but do you
[35:04] believe the message
[35:07] is there something in you despite your
[35:09] failures
[35:10] is there something in you despite your
[35:12] faults is there something in you that
[35:14] you can look at yourself and rush you
[35:16] know i'm not that really good i don't
[35:18] really measure up that well i realize
[35:20] there's so much more i want to do but
[35:22] when you lay it all down is there
[35:24] something in you says lord i don't
[35:26] understand it but i believe it
[35:29] lord i'm looking for the day of the
[35:31] manifestation of these things that you
[35:33] have spoken in my life and i might fall
[35:35] one time two time a million times lord
[35:38] but there's something in me that can't
[35:40] give up there's something to me that
[35:42] can't stop why because it's not you it's
[35:45] god and you he's not willing to to just
[35:48] as he was not willing to suffer to see
[35:50] his holy one see corruption he's not
[35:53] willing to see you see corruption either
[35:55] he's not willing to leave you down and
[35:57] out like that but god wants to lift you
[35:59] up he wants to raise you up he wants to
[36:01] bring you into all of the manifestation
[36:03] of what he spoke
[36:06] but we're faced with the faults we're
[36:08] faced with the failures
[36:10] we're faced with the devil buffeting of
[36:12] us
[36:13] and say you're nothing but a bluff
[36:15] but oh i like that story because i'm
[36:17] reminded that they're in that place
[36:20] that the prophet said satan i rebuke you
[36:24] in the name of jesus christ i rebuke you
[36:26] and that's what we need to do saints
[36:29] if it's contrary to the word don't take
[36:32] it
[36:34] let's make this simple tonight
[36:36] what did god say about you
[36:40] that's all that matters
[36:41] have you considered my servant job
[36:45] what'd he say he was a perfect man
[36:48] upright in his generation there's nobody
[36:50] like him
[36:52] oh oh you you could you could uh take
[36:54] the same approach and him say have you
[36:56] considered my bride and he was saying
[36:58] she's perfect she's without spot she's
[37:01] out with out without regular there's not
[37:03] even a blemish in her and the devil
[37:05] would try to come and tell him say well
[37:06] now wait a second now
[37:09] wait a second lord what are you talking
[37:11] about just the other day
[37:15] but i'm so encouraged
[37:17] that if you've pled the blood of jesus
[37:20] christ if you have taken your faults and
[37:23] your failures and you have pled the
[37:25] blood of jesus christ look the prophet
[37:27] would even admonish the people that were
[37:29] coming into the prayer line he would
[37:31] tell him look
[37:32] if you have something you need to make
[37:33] right
[37:35] and you don't want the public to know
[37:37] because i'm not in control but if you
[37:39] come up here with unconfessed sin in
[37:41] your life it'll be exposed and it might
[37:43] just be told out there what your problem
[37:45] is is what you're facing
[37:47] but if it's under the blood of jesus
[37:49] christ there your your own accuser the
[37:52] devil could try to say well now you say
[37:54] she's perfect
[37:56] but i got a different record
[37:59] i got a different book that i'm looking
[38:01] at and he would start to tell the lord
[38:03] well they did this
[38:05] and they did that
[38:08] and they did this over this time do you
[38:10] remember that and if you have pled the
[38:12] blood of jesus christ i'm so encouraged
[38:14] to know that god would stand there and
[38:16] look at the devil the all-knowing god
[38:19] who knows all things
[38:22] and could look at that devil and
[38:24] truthfully
[38:26] not lying but truthfully say
[38:29] i don't know what you're talking about
[38:32] what sin
[38:34] oh you talk about a grace you talk about
[38:37] a thanksgiving so let's not look at your
[38:39] faults let's not i know we say this many
[38:42] times but i believe that we are limited
[38:44] so much in our freedom of worship we're
[38:46] limited in so much that we will step out
[38:49] by faith because we're limited by this
[38:51] this these five senses and these gates
[38:54] of our flesh
[38:56] but oh we're to possess the gate of our
[38:58] enemy we're to possess these gates we're
[39:01] not worried about those gates the only
[39:02] gate i'm worried about is faith that
[39:04] that one that takes root in the word of
[39:06] what god said
[39:08] what did god say about you tonight
[39:12] so even i love how it is because even in
[39:14] a service you know satan will bombard
[39:17] your mind and try to distract you and
[39:18] try to point all of these things out and
[39:21] you know i've heard this before and but
[39:23] you know let's if we've heard it before
[39:25] if it's the word of god why don't you
[39:26] take sides with jesus tonight
[39:29] and say amen to the word
[39:32] and say you know what
[39:34] if that was a first one to maturity if
[39:37] this is what the word said that i'm a
[39:39] believer so i'm going to take sides with
[39:41] jesus
[39:43] i'm going to keep walking with him
[39:47] i'm going to walk with him in this
[39:49] message until the change of my body
[39:54] i can't do nothing else that's what i
[39:56] was called for that's what i was placed
[39:58] here for
[40:00] and then something coming to the room
[40:02] after we rebuked the devil and just to
[40:04] maybe reiterate that some of us just
[40:05] need to rebuke the devil tonight
[40:07] that's okay why don't you take some time
[40:09] to do it those little thoughts and those
[40:11] little persecutions and those little
[40:12] things he's been trying to do to you and
[40:14] trying to tell you you're never going to
[40:15] be delivered you're never going to be
[40:16] able to make it this is the way you're
[40:18] going to be your whole life you're just
[40:19] never going to get the victory why don't
[40:21] you just go and say oh devil i rebuke
[40:23] you in the name of jesus christ i rebuke
[40:25] you in the name of jesus christ you're
[40:26] trying to tell me i won't have my family
[40:28] you're trying to tell me i won't have my
[40:30] joy you're trying to tell me i won't
[40:31] have my victory you're trying to tell me
[40:33] i'll never be delivered you're trying to
[40:34] tell me i'll never add up you're trying
[40:36] to tell me i'll never be successful
[40:38] you're trying to tell me i'll never be
[40:39] accepted you're trying to tell me i'll
[40:41] never fit in you're trying to tell me
[40:42] i'll never have a place in the body
[40:44] you're trying to tell me that god's
[40:45] never gonna pick me up and you saying i
[40:47] rebuke you
[40:48] in the name of jesus christ i rebuke you
[40:51] you're not welcome here you're not
[40:52] welcome in my thoughts you're not
[40:54] welcome in my mind you're not welcome in
[40:56] the church i rebuke you
[40:59] oh i pray just as that manifested there
[41:02] in the room of that prophet it can
[41:04] manifest here in the tabernacle tonight
[41:07] he said all sudden there's a sweet
[41:08] presence that come over the building
[41:11] also there was a sweet presence that
[41:13] come in the room and it was the holy
[41:15] ghost
[41:16] and he spoke to him a mature son of god
[41:19] he said don't fear to go anywhere
[41:23] don't fear to do anything
[41:26] for the never failing presence oh
[41:28] emmanuel hallelujah god with us emmanuel
[41:34] don't fear to go anywhere don't fear to
[41:37] do anything for the never failing
[41:39] presence of jesus christ is with you
[41:42] wherever you go i want to ask you what
[41:45] do you have to worry about tonight
[41:48] the never failing presence of jesus
[41:50] christ is with you
[41:54] if you're walking with him what do you
[41:56] got to worry about
[41:58] what we need is illumination in our
[42:00] heart to know what we're walking with i
[42:02] think a lot of us don't even know what
[42:04] we got
[42:07] you you you're in a fight you're in a
[42:09] fist fight and you're loaded with guns
[42:11] and ammo and all this ammunition
[42:14] and some of us don't even know how to
[42:15] use it
[42:17] i mean we got the revealed word of the
[42:19] hour the unveiled uh the unveiling of
[42:22] god god has come and made himself know
[42:24] what we need to do is pray for
[42:26] revelation
[42:27] lord show me how to use this show me how
[42:29] to fight the warfare show me how to
[42:32] fight the good fight of faith or show me
[42:33] how to stand upon the promised word of
[42:36] this hour that i might know who i am as
[42:38] a son and daughter in jesus christ that
[42:41] i might stand in my position that i
[42:43] might stand with liberty that i might be
[42:45] able to wield the sword of faith and and
[42:48] and chase the enemy back
[42:51] we're not retreating come on
[42:54] all the stuff that's going out in the
[42:56] world don't scare me the bride is christ
[42:59] says bring it on
[43:01] i was born for this
[43:03] you ever hear people say that oh they
[43:05] were born for that uh they're a natural
[43:08] you're a natural overcomer you were born
[43:11] for this
[43:12] this is the purpose god placed you here
[43:15] was to be here in the most wicked age
[43:16] that you would prove to satan that
[43:18] you're not like that eve
[43:22] you are that one that's coming into
[43:24] maturity now that when we've seen a
[43:27] first one there's something in you that
[43:28] wants to say i believe it
[43:32] yes it might be the day of simple things
[43:34] it might be the day of small things it
[43:37] might not be in your understanding of
[43:39] what you're hoping it to be but if
[43:41] you'll continue to labor to pray and get
[43:44] into the presence of god and continue to
[43:46] pray for revelation that this word would
[43:48] be revealed to you oh and if you're
[43:50] walking with him then the word is being
[43:53] interpreted in you god is speaking
[43:55] through you he's manifesting his word in
[43:57] you because you're the provided place
[43:59] that god wants to manifest this word
[44:02] amen
[44:05] oh he said but he put it in christ the
[44:08] anointed emmanuel and the name is
[44:11] in the word because he is the word amen
[44:15] what is he then
[44:16] the word interpreted
[44:19] is the manifestation of the name of god
[44:21] and he plays the name in his son
[44:24] what is the name it's the lord jesus
[44:26] christ so what was it the interpretation
[44:29] of the word
[44:30] the word interpreted is the
[44:32] manifestation of the lord jesus christ
[44:34] that's what we're excited about
[44:37] because we're living in the hour that we
[44:40] have seen the interpretation of the word
[44:42] we've seen prophecy being fulfilled we
[44:46] can recite all the scriptures but we all
[44:48] know them so that's what we've been
[44:50] gathered together by
[44:52] is that the word has been interpreted in
[44:54] our generation and it was none other
[44:56] than the manifestation of the lord jesus
[44:58] christ
[44:59] but he came for the purpose that he
[45:01] would continue his work in and through
[45:03] the bride you are now the place of
[45:06] manifestation we look back into the
[45:08] history books we look back into the
[45:10] bible we can look back into the church
[45:12] ages we can look back into abraham and
[45:14] into noah and to moses and we can see
[45:16] god how he was manifesting himself in
[45:19] the patriarchs we see how god manifested
[45:22] himself in elijah we see how god
[45:24] manifested himself in the prophet john
[45:26] and in our lord jesus christ and then
[45:28] peter james john matthew bartholomew and
[45:30] those disciples we can look back there
[45:33] and see how god was manifesting himself
[45:35] and those but this is now the hour of
[45:38] the bride in the end time that has now
[45:40] accepted the word and the revelation
[45:42] under the seventh angel messenger and
[45:44] just as he fulfilled his part just as he
[45:47] played on his part he was the
[45:49] interpretation of the word
[45:51] but i'm reminded in the bible in ezekiel
[45:54] when the lord asked the prophet he said
[45:56] can these bones live
[45:58] he said thou knowest
[46:00] thou knowest if these bones kill he told
[46:02] what he didn't tell he told the prophet
[46:04] to prophesy and then when the prophet
[46:06] prophesied it was the word that the
[46:09] prophet prophesied that brought those
[46:11] dry bones in the valley to life and
[46:13] that's none other that's what's happened
[46:15] in our day and age that god has
[46:17] vindicated his word by a prophet coming
[46:20] on the scene and god has spoken through
[46:22] the lips of the prophet saying there
[46:23] will be a bride in the end
[46:26] time and what was it the prophet played
[46:29] his part he fulfilled his part but the
[46:32] word of god that was spoken has now been
[46:35] going forward and what is it doing it's
[46:37] catching into the heart of the bride of
[46:39] jesus christ that was predestinated here
[46:42] in the end time to fulfill that spoken
[46:44] word that was promised don't you realize
[46:47] you're living in the hour that the third
[46:49] pool is coming at the manifestation in
[46:51] you
[46:53] not history
[46:56] i'll meet you in there and there that's
[46:58] what's happening right now
[47:03] oh that might not excite you
[47:06] that might be familiar and common to you
[47:10] but that's what i'm thankful for
[47:13] that's what i'm rejoicing about
[47:16] that's what i'm living for
[47:18] that's what excites me in the morning
[47:20] that's what gives me hope that's what
[47:22] well that's what that's what it's all
[47:23] about
[47:25] because without this message what do i
[47:27] got
[47:28] let me ask you what do you got without
[47:30] this message
[47:32] a bunch of creeds a bunch of drugs a
[47:34] bunch of out what do you got
[47:36] because the message
[47:38] what is the let me just say it like this
[47:41] what is the message he says it right
[47:42] here he says that the interpretation of
[47:45] the word the word interpreted is the
[47:48] manifestation of the name of god the
[47:50] word interpreted is the manifestation of
[47:53] the lord jesus christ the message
[47:57] is the manifestation
[48:00] of the lord jesus christ but it can't
[48:02] stay on the books it can't stay on the
[48:05] tapes it can't stay in the past so where
[48:09] is the message being interpreted where
[48:12] is the message being manifested it's
[48:14] being manifested in a people that have
[48:17] gathered themselves together on an eve
[48:19] sunday evening in bedford texas is where
[48:22] the message is living it's where the
[48:24] message is alive it's where the never
[48:26] failing presence of jesus christ is in
[48:29] our midst i ask you then why don't you
[48:31] just reach out and claim what you have
[48:33] need of oh we've heard it so many times
[48:36] but he is passing by your way tonight
[48:40] oh that's what i'm living for that's
[48:42] what i'm thankful for without this
[48:44] message i got nothing
[48:47] without this message i'm just like isaac
[48:50] laying on an altar waiting to die
[48:54] certain death
[48:57] no hope
[48:59] oh but what did abraham say
[49:02] what did he say there in verse 5 he said
[49:06] god had told abraham
[49:09] hey go up to a place where i showed you
[49:12] and offer thy only son
[49:14] but watch god speaking
[49:17] watch god speaking through abraham
[49:20] and verse 5 it says if you read it with
[49:22] me
[49:26] we all keep pulling like this we might
[49:28] be in trouble i don't even got anywhere
[49:30] yet
[49:31] and i didn't have much to go with
[49:33] god help us
[49:35] but he said oh take thy only son isaac
[49:38] whom now love us and get thee into the
[49:39] land of moriah and after him there offer
[49:42] him there for a burnt offering upon one
[49:44] of the mountains which i will tell thee
[49:46] of so here is that place that god has
[49:48] spoken to abraham i'm going to show you
[49:50] a place where something's going to
[49:51] happen there's going to be a
[49:52] manifestation and what abraham has in
[49:55] his mind is only what god has told him
[49:58] that i'm going to this place
[50:00] and this place that god has chosen is
[50:02] where i'm going to offer my son the only
[50:04] thing he knows to do is to be obedient
[50:06] to the word and so now in obedience to
[50:09] the word he's walking by faith but oh
[50:11] listen to this faith seed speak here in
[50:14] verse 5 he was traveling there with his
[50:16] son and they had some mules and and some
[50:18] other helpers that would with them and
[50:20] then they were in verse 5 he was saying
[50:22] abraham said unto his young men forgive
[50:23] me if there's people interpreting i got
[50:25] to learn how to
[50:27] i'm trying to find it different gears
[50:30] forgive me
[50:33] and abraham said unto his young men in
[50:35] verse 5
[50:36] abide ye here with the ass and i and the
[50:40] lad
[50:41] will go yonder and worship
[50:44] but he didn't stop there
[50:48] and come again to you
[50:52] oh what is this what is this profound
[50:55] speech
[50:56] that you're saying abraham
[50:58] god told you to go up there and offer
[51:01] your only son but there's something
[51:03] that's speaking through abraham there's
[51:05] a revelation there's something that that
[51:08] is caught in abraham that he's been
[51:11] through something he's been through some
[51:13] trials he didn't have abra he didn't
[51:15] have his son isaac in the first place
[51:17] isaac was dead to him in the first place
[51:19] he never had the son he could never
[51:22] bring the sun forth so the very sun that
[51:25] god was asking him to sacrifice it was
[51:27] god gave him that son
[51:32] he did not procreate that son in his own
[51:34] ability he had no ability
[51:38] it was impossible
[51:41] for abraham and sarah to have a son so
[51:45] the very son that he had was the very
[51:49] work of god in their life that he
[51:51] fulfilled the promised word that he told
[51:53] abraham you will have a son
[51:55] and so he received isaac from the dead
[51:59] and he knew
[52:00] by revelation that if i already received
[52:03] him from the dead once
[52:06] i can receive him from the dead again so
[52:09] he could speak by faith and say i can go
[52:12] up to that mountain and the same god
[52:15] that gave me a promised son that was
[52:17] dead to me is the same god when i go up
[52:20] on the mountain and i sacrifice my son
[52:23] he's the same god that can raise him up
[52:25] again
[52:27] oh there was a revelation in the father
[52:29] abraham he knew something about faith
[52:33] he knew something about walking with god
[52:35] he knew something that there was a god
[52:37] of all situations there was a god of
[52:40] impossibilities
[52:43] there was a god no matter how hard your
[52:46] child got you are walking with the never
[52:49] failing presence of jesus christ what do
[52:52] you have to fear
[52:54] oh he said right here
[52:58] we will go yonder in worship
[53:01] and come again unto you
[53:03] and the prophet of god would say this he
[53:05] would say
[53:09] and he said now you wait here
[53:12] i like this of abraham he said to his
[53:14] servant said
[53:15] you ain't here with the mules
[53:17] and i will and i and my son will go
[53:20] yonder to worship
[53:22] and we shall return
[53:24] how is he going to do it
[53:28] when he went up there to kill him
[53:32] god told him go up and take his life
[53:35] but what did the bible say in romans 4
[53:36] abraham knew that he'd received him as
[53:39] one from the dead
[53:40] and was fully persuaded there it is
[53:43] saints
[53:44] he was fully persuaded
[53:46] i wonder if we're fully persuaded this
[53:48] evening of the message
[53:50] are we fully persuaded are you all in
[53:54] are you all in look saints you can't be
[53:57] halfway in and halfway out you can't be
[54:00] hot and cold you can't be living for god
[54:02] one day and not living for god the next
[54:04] god is trying to show you something that
[54:06] you can come to a place where you're
[54:09] fully persuaded that in the face of your
[54:12] friends in the face of the enemy in the
[54:14] face of your adversaries that you are
[54:17] fully persuaded to take god at his word
[54:22] amen
[54:24] that he was fully persuaded
[54:26] that god was able to raise him up from
[54:29] the dead
[54:30] from where he received him as a figure
[54:32] see said you wait here
[54:35] how's it going to do now watch this
[54:37] think about yourself for a little bit
[54:39] how's it going to do i can't tell you
[54:42] can you think of that sister with your
[54:44] baby in your arms
[54:46] and mother sitting in the wheelchair
[54:48] a little boy there over here a daddy i
[54:52] don't know how he's going to do it
[54:55] i just don't know how he is going to do
[54:57] it
[54:58] but he is going to do it because
[55:02] he promised he
[55:04] would
[55:06] on the basis you would believe it
[55:10] he does it to others see
[55:13] this boy and i the lord and i will
[55:16] return
[55:18] see you wait here and we'll go worship
[55:20] there was something in abraham that was
[55:22] speaking out god was speaking out
[55:25] through abraham abraham had uh works is
[55:28] faith expressed
[55:30] look you say you believe the message
[55:32] well let me look at your works and see
[55:34] if you really believe the message
[55:36] i think we've gotten to a place where
[55:38] we've been in this message so long that
[55:40] we we we've it's like
[55:43] that's what's happened to humanity there
[55:44] used to be decency and common decency
[55:47] amongst the women in america but we see
[55:49] the perverseness where it's got to and i
[55:51] want to say this it's the same thing in
[55:53] the message there used to be a holiness
[55:56] dress there used to be a way that the
[55:58] sisters carry themselves there used to
[56:00] be a music that the bride would listen
[56:02] to but we've been around this so long
[56:04] it's like the needles move where we let
[56:06] in any kind of music we let in any kind
[56:09] of dress and all of a sudden what we
[56:11] have today yes it might not look like
[56:13] the world but if you compared what we
[56:16] had today with the message 30 years ago
[56:19] our sisters would be ashamed of
[56:21] themselves
[56:22] i believe that to be the truth not our
[56:24] godly sisters god bless you god's proud
[56:26] of you we love you we're so thankful of
[56:28] of the standard and the holiness but i'm
[56:31] speaking to those that are not fully
[56:33] persuaded
[56:35] i'm not speaking to our godly god bless
[56:38] you sisters god bless you men that are
[56:40] fully persuaded and you believe this
[56:42] message and you're a true example i
[56:44] commend you
[56:45] but i'm speaking to that son and
[56:47] daughter of god that's on the fence and
[56:49] you know better
[56:51] you know you're hot and cold and in and
[56:53] out
[56:54] you know you dress different in the
[56:56] world than you do when you come to
[56:57] church
[56:59] we're not condemning you we've all many
[57:01] of us have been there
[57:04] but god by his love and grace he's just
[57:06] telling you there's more for you
[57:08] you don't have to struggle look servant
[57:11] god is not a struggle
[57:13] oh if i could say that to your young
[57:15] people and somebody that's just
[57:17] struggling to serve god if you can just
[57:20] take god at his word come to a place of
[57:23] full surrender when you completely die
[57:25] out to your own thoughts and your own
[57:27] ability and you come to calvary and
[57:30] you're weak your way at the cross and
[57:32] you're forgiven of your sins you're
[57:33] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[57:35] christ and you receive the baptism of
[57:38] the holy ghost oh there's nothing like
[57:40] it i was i was baptized and filled with
[57:43] the holy ghost back in december 1999
[57:46] i've never been the same since i have
[57:48] not struggled to serve god
[57:51] have i had struggles i've had my
[57:53] struggles have i had my ups and downs
[57:56] i've had my ups and downs but since that
[57:58] day saints
[58:00] i've been fully persuaded i am not
[58:03] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[58:06] i'm not in and out i'm not up and down
[58:09] but i'm seated in heavenly places with
[58:11] christ jesus
[58:14] i know in whom i have believed and i am
[58:17] persuaded that he is more than able to
[58:19] keep that which i've committed unto him
[58:21] to that day
[58:24] i'm not afraid
[58:26] i'm not scared
[58:28] i'm not worried
[58:30] why
[58:31] that's why abraham wasn't afraid
[58:33] he wasn't worried he's like i didn't
[58:35] have a son in the first place
[58:38] the devil's trying to make you afraid
[58:40] and worried that you're not going to
[58:41] make it
[58:43] you should just say devil you're so
[58:45] stupid forgive me for using the word but
[58:47] he is
[58:48] i wouldn't be here
[58:50] if it wasn't for the grace of god in the
[58:52] first place
[58:54] oh how many times saints you got to go
[58:56] back to the word when you get in
[58:58] discouragement maybe you've done
[58:59] something you shouldn't do and you just
[59:01] remind yourself he who be going to work
[59:04] is just and faithful to finish it
[59:07] oh my i've gotten there many times i
[59:09] look back and there that devil is he's
[59:11] rebuking me he's telling me you're
[59:13] nothing but a bluff and i'm looking at
[59:14] my works i'm looking at my life and i'm
[59:16] like man
[59:17] i thought i should be way up the road by
[59:19] now
[59:21] i thought i should be a lot more mature
[59:22] than this how in the world am i battling
[59:24] with these things why am i facing these
[59:26] types of problems
[59:28] why am i going through these things
[59:30] right but then you realize
[59:33] look it's not me i didn't start the work
[59:36] he started the work
[59:38] and if he started the work then he will
[59:41] finish the work
[59:43] and i'm fully persuaded of that just as
[59:46] abraham was fully persuaded that lord
[59:49] you told me
[59:51] i would be a father of many nations so
[59:54] you can take my only son but one thing
[59:57] you cannot do you cannot fail your word
[1:00:02] he promised it he said it then quit
[1:00:05] listening to the devil go ahead and take
[1:00:08] god at his word tonight why don't you
[1:00:09] just go ahead and rebuke the devil and
[1:00:11] take god at his word and what god said
[1:00:14] and be fully persuaded tonight that he's
[1:00:16] more than able
[1:00:18] oh hallelujah i might be screaming and
[1:00:21] spit up here but at least i'm doing it
[1:00:23] for god
[1:00:25] i might be a wreck i might be sick my
[1:00:27] voice might be gone but oh
[1:00:29] i would have done it for so i would have
[1:00:31] done it for another kingdom
[1:00:33] i about killed myself out there in the
[1:00:35] world drinking and drugging and doing
[1:00:36] all the things for for the devil oh you
[1:00:38] just you just stick around a little bit
[1:00:40] i get excited i'm sorry about it if i
[1:00:43] was that way in the world for something
[1:00:45] that was death if i was that way in the
[1:00:47] world for something that was trying to
[1:00:49] kill me oh what about when you're living
[1:00:51] for god who's preserved your life he
[1:00:54] saved you he's baptized you he's filled
[1:00:56] you with the holy ghost he's giving you
[1:00:58] victory
[1:01:00] oh my
[1:01:01] we got something to scream about we got
[1:01:03] something to shout about i got something
[1:01:05] to stop my feet and snort about
[1:01:10] come on somebody
[1:01:13] some of us did some crazy things when
[1:01:15] we're out there in the world
[1:01:18] we start to think back on some of those
[1:01:19] things
[1:01:21] my goodness you talk about thanksgiving
[1:01:24] i don't even know if time will have time
[1:01:26] to get there but
[1:01:27] i thought that'd be nice to maybe stroll
[1:01:29] down memory lane a little bit thank god
[1:01:31] for what he's brought us through
[1:01:36] oh so they'd get up there
[1:01:39] dad
[1:01:42] we got the altar
[1:01:46] where's the lamb
[1:01:47] son
[1:01:50] my son god will provide himself
[1:01:52] a burnt offering
[1:01:55] the prophet would go on to say abraham
[1:01:57] laid him up there
[1:02:00] can you imagine
[1:02:02] taking his little curly hair
[1:02:05] and rolling it back out of his face
[1:02:08] and his little brown eyes
[1:02:11] looking up like that
[1:02:13] and his lips quivering
[1:02:16] see that big bladed knife
[1:02:19] come out of his
[1:02:20] father's
[1:02:22] think of it
[1:02:23] think of that father
[1:02:26] laid his
[1:02:27] little head back
[1:02:29] and pulled his throat back
[1:02:32] so he could stab him through the throat
[1:02:35] with his knife
[1:02:38] all in obedience to god
[1:02:41] no matter
[1:02:42] what it looked like he said
[1:02:44] i received them as one from the dead
[1:02:48] god is able to raise him up
[1:02:51] he raised back the knife
[1:02:54] and started
[1:02:56] and the holy spirit caught his hand and
[1:02:58] said abraham
[1:03:01] here am i
[1:03:04] oh praise god
[1:03:06] just at the right time
[1:03:08] just at the right hour
[1:03:10] i'm so thankful
[1:03:12] that he's the same yesterday
[1:03:15] today and forever you might have been
[1:03:17] believing for something a long time you
[1:03:19] might have been believing for healing in
[1:03:20] your body you might have been believing
[1:03:22] for a family member you might have been
[1:03:24] believing for something so specific but
[1:03:26] i want to encourage you that if you're
[1:03:28] fully
[1:03:29] and you're taking god at his word god
[1:03:32] will not fail his word
[1:03:35] it was just at that time that god spoke
[1:03:38] a ram into existence oh and how you
[1:03:40] could go down that type that it was a
[1:03:42] ram it was a he
[1:03:43] it was a representation of the lamb
[1:03:46] jesus christ that he was going to
[1:03:48] provide jehovah jireh the lord will
[1:03:51] provide for himself a lamb
[1:03:54] the prophet of god would go on to say
[1:03:56] this he would say
[1:03:59] god had a certain place he met abraham
[1:04:02] and there abraham worshipped i was
[1:04:05] thinking about this
[1:04:08] he told them last to stay there we will
[1:04:10] come again with you did you imagine the
[1:04:12] worship
[1:04:14] after god vindicated and manifested
[1:04:17] himself in that place of jehovah jireh
[1:04:20] could you imagine i i am i can you
[1:04:22] imagine the emotions
[1:04:25] father were you really going to do it
[1:04:27] well son
[1:04:29] the lord told me to say i didn't want to
[1:04:32] but father he you were right he did
[1:04:34] provide a ramp yes son yes
[1:04:37] could you imagine all the hugging and
[1:04:40] the weeping and how they must have
[1:04:41] rejoiced and and all the emotions and
[1:04:44] the fluttering and and him going back in
[1:04:46] his mind and and thinking of when he met
[1:04:48] melchizedek and said i'll visit you and
[1:04:50] i know he was just oh and when he
[1:04:52] changed his name and all of these things
[1:04:54] and there everything was coming back
[1:04:56] kind of like you know when when when
[1:04:58] tragedy strikes or when something uh so
[1:05:01] uh there's a scare in your life you just
[1:05:02] think back and the only things that
[1:05:04] matter really really stand out you're
[1:05:06] not worried about all the fluff you're
[1:05:08] not even worried about your job you're
[1:05:09] not you're not worried about all the
[1:05:11] little things that used to bother you
[1:05:12] just thankful to be alive
[1:05:14] and all in that moment it could just be
[1:05:16] oh thank you thank you for your grace
[1:05:18] thank you for your word lord thank you
[1:05:20] thank you that your jehovah jireh i can
[1:05:22] imagine there as they they wept there
[1:05:25] and they hugged and they went back
[1:05:27] oh there was a worship
[1:05:29] there was a thanksgiving
[1:05:31] i say what a thanksgiving it must have
[1:05:33] been that god had provided himself a
[1:05:35] lamb
[1:05:39] he said god met him in a certain place
[1:05:41] and they worshipped
[1:05:43] and his promised word will be
[1:05:44] interpreted in you by him
[1:05:47] did you get that
[1:05:48] the word that he promised to fulfill in
[1:05:51] the day that you're living in oh thank
[1:05:54] you god the word that he promised to
[1:05:56] fulfill and the day that you're living
[1:05:59] it the the word that he promised to
[1:06:01] fulfill in the day that you're living in
[1:06:04] the word that pertains to the bride
[1:06:06] you're the one that's going to fulfill
[1:06:07] it
[1:06:10] you're the one
[1:06:11] you're the chosen place you're the
[1:06:13] chosen vessel
[1:06:14] quit listening what the devil's saying
[1:06:16] listen to what the messenger is saying
[1:06:17] listen to what the prophet's saying
[1:06:19] that's the very word that is speaking
[1:06:21] into your heart that you might manifest
[1:06:23] what was spoken
[1:06:25] the word that he promised to fulfill in
[1:06:27] the day that you're living in you will
[1:06:29] be written epistles of god read of all
[1:06:31] men not what you claim but what god does
[1:06:34] through you will speak out louder than
[1:06:36] anything you could claim god said these
[1:06:38] shine stuff all of them that believe
[1:06:40] that speaks through you
[1:06:44] so god was speaking through abraham and
[1:06:48] manifesting his word and god is doing
[1:06:50] the same thing he's manifesting in his
[1:06:53] word and the bride and that is speaking
[1:06:55] through you
[1:06:57] you are written epistles read of all men
[1:07:01] that they might see your good works and
[1:07:03] glorify god the only god that the only
[1:07:06] real true god the only lord jesus christ
[1:07:09] that people are going to see in this
[1:07:11] world is the bride that is manifesting
[1:07:13] the word
[1:07:15] where else are they come on
[1:07:17] where else
[1:07:18] are people
[1:07:20] gonna come in contact with the
[1:07:22] manifested word of the hour
[1:07:25] even if they find it
[1:07:27] on a tape
[1:07:28] or some technology
[1:07:30] or they read it it still has to be
[1:07:33] quickened in them for that word to
[1:07:34] become material
[1:07:37] that's how god ordained it to be
[1:07:40] so the message of the hour is being
[1:07:42] interpreted in you
[1:07:46] well god wants to pour his blessings out
[1:07:48] upon you
[1:07:50] uh you know i'm kind of tired of living
[1:07:51] below my privileges
[1:07:54] i'm kind of tired of
[1:07:56] of of of shrinking back this ain't a
[1:07:59] time to shrink back church this is a
[1:08:01] time to go forward with god
[1:08:04] man maybe
[1:08:06] we said we wouldn't be long but we're
[1:08:08] getting close to
[1:08:10] leaving that behind huh
[1:08:14] well praise god are y'all feeling all
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:18] praise the lord god is good amen
[1:08:22] the prophet of god would say this can't
[1:08:23] you see where we're standing
[1:08:26] life is in the grain again what is it
[1:08:28] just exactly like the same grain that
[1:08:31] went into the ground

[1:09:23] just as jesus christ was the word made
[1:09:26] flesh and dwelling among us now there is
[1:09:29] a bride that the word has been spoken by
[1:09:32] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10
[1:09:36] 1-7 there has been an unveiling of god
[1:09:39] and a word that has been spoken
[1:09:41] concerning a bride in the end time and
[1:09:43] you are the one that is manifesting that
[1:09:46] spoken word oh i know i say it over and
[1:09:48] over again but i need to hear it over
[1:09:50] and over again you can't tell me enough
[1:09:53] because i'm being bombarded enough by
[1:09:55] the things of the world i can't even
[1:09:57] drive down the street i can't even turn
[1:09:59] on my phone i can't even go into the
[1:10:01] supermarket that the whole world is
[1:10:03] puffing up my flesh and pulling on the
[1:10:05] five senses and trying to hold me down
[1:10:07] but praise god there was an eagle that
[1:10:10] spread its wings and flew in this
[1:10:12] lady'll see it age and called out my
[1:10:14] name and said come up higher oh you said
[1:10:17] how do i get there just jump just start
[1:10:20] flapping your wings
[1:10:22] so when you hear the quote
[1:10:25] just jump
[1:10:27] just start flapping your wings quit
[1:10:30] wondering how you're going to manifest
[1:10:32] it and just say i know
[1:10:34] i'm going to manifest it not because
[1:10:36] what i can do but because he said it and
[1:10:39] i'm fully persuaded that the lord jesus
[1:10:42] christ will bring his word to pass in me
[1:10:46] oh that's a revelation are you fully
[1:10:48] persuaded tonight bride
[1:10:51] oh just exactly the same grain that went
[1:10:54] into the ground the same jesus in
[1:10:57] form
[1:10:58] the same power
[1:10:59] same church same thing same word
[1:11:03] you are that same word
[1:11:07] oh glory to god
[1:11:10] oh thank you jesus
[1:11:12] what did the prophet of god say look it
[1:11:15] speaks through you
[1:11:17] the bride has thus saith the lord
[1:11:20] or she stands still
[1:11:23] they
[1:11:24] know listen they know do you know
[1:11:28] tonight
[1:11:29] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:11:32] doing the works
[1:11:33] fulfilling his own word
[1:11:35] he did not complete all his work while
[1:11:38] in his earthly ministry
[1:11:42] so now
[1:11:45] so the word made flesh and dwelt among
[1:11:47] us emmanuel
[1:11:48] did not complete
[1:11:52] all his works while in his earthly
[1:11:56] ministry
[1:11:58] his earthly ministry
[1:12:01] well you know where he's at now he's in
[1:12:03] his
[1:12:04] her earthly ministry
[1:12:06] what are you talking about brother he
[1:12:08] did not fulfill everything while in his
[1:12:10] earthly ministry but now
[1:12:13] he says so now he works in
[1:12:16] and through the bride
[1:12:19] so now that same word that was made
[1:12:21] flesh and dwelt among us emmanuel what
[1:12:24] did he say back there he said that he
[1:12:27] said that it was emmanuel he said
[1:12:30] not in the methodist church baptist
[1:12:32] church but he put it in christ the
[1:12:34] anointed emmanuel god with us don't you
[1:12:38] realize bride that you are the anointed
[1:12:41] pride you are the anointed word
[1:12:45] oh you can't fail you can't miss it but
[1:12:47] what we need to do is reach out by faith
[1:12:49] and claim it and be fully persuaded of
[1:12:52] it
[1:12:52] that's why we live so far below our
[1:12:55] privileges
[1:12:57] praise the lord
[1:13:00] oh my the same power
[1:13:03] the same word
[1:13:04] maybe we'll just end right around here
[1:13:06] because i'm on the brink of preaching a
[1:13:07] regular service i thought we'd be
[1:13:09] really short but
[1:13:11] but i i just maybe would dwell on this
[1:13:12] for a moment here we've heard this many
[1:13:15] times but let's just read romans 8 19.
[1:13:28] i kind of wonder if i sound like a
[1:13:29] little like smith wigglesworth i heard
[1:13:31] he was a
[1:13:32] grunting and kind of starting and hard
[1:13:35] to listen to i i mean god bless you for
[1:13:37] having to put up with this
[1:13:39] romans 8 19.
[1:13:42] listen to this now he says for the
[1:13:44] earnest expectation
[1:13:47] of the creature
[1:13:48] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:13:51] sons of god
[1:13:53] now as i just thought on those things if
[1:13:55] you think about the original creation
[1:13:57] the earth was the chosen place of
[1:13:59] manifestation for the word seed to bring
[1:14:01] forth so then god he separates the light
[1:14:04] from the darkness the sun comes out and
[1:14:06] and all these seeds come forth to life
[1:14:07] and there's all of the fish and all the
[1:14:09] animals and there's a paradise of god on
[1:14:12] the earth
[1:14:14] and as long as adam is in his position
[1:14:17] and has dominion over the earth as a
[1:14:20] miniature god everything is running
[1:14:22] along just fine
[1:14:23] everything is in perfect harmony
[1:14:27] right but then when adam fell from his
[1:14:30] position everything went on to chaos
[1:14:33] death set in the curse set in and now
[1:14:35] death was set into the human race and
[1:14:37] into all the world
[1:14:41] so then now
[1:14:42] what has happened that man has fell from
[1:14:45] his position
[1:14:47] now the whole creation is groaning and
[1:14:50] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:14:53] sons of god that they might come back
[1:14:55] into the position that adam was once in
[1:14:58] in the beginning
[1:15:00] right so then if we look at that word
[1:15:03] manifestation that word also means
[1:15:05] revelation so the whole creation is
[1:15:08] groaning for the revelation of the sons
[1:15:10] of god
[1:15:12] oh my don't you realize that that's
[1:15:14] what's taking place at the unveiling of
[1:15:17] god as christ has unveiled himself to
[1:15:19] the bride it's actually revealed who the
[1:15:23] sons and daughters of god are it's
[1:15:25] actually revealed who the bride of jesus
[1:15:27] christ it's actually the revelation of
[1:15:30] the sons of god that death will be
[1:15:32] swallowed up in victory that the your
[1:15:35] bodies will be changed that you are
[1:15:37] going to come back into that position by
[1:15:40] adoption into that place of
[1:15:42] manifestation that god's called you to
[1:15:46] that's what you're coming back to that's
[1:15:48] what the whole creation is groaning for
[1:15:50] is for you to come back into that place
[1:15:54] back into that position
[1:15:57] look this is the dispensation if you
[1:15:59] will of adoption
[1:16:01] this is where sons and daughters of god
[1:16:03] are coming back into position again
[1:16:07] what are you talking about brother
[1:16:08] matthew i'm talking about a son of god
[1:16:10] back in his position again
[1:16:12] like it was in eden
[1:16:16] this is the place
[1:16:18] i just maybe want to say this one more
[1:16:20] time
[1:16:21] the place of manifestation of the word
[1:16:23] of god
[1:16:25] in his bride
[1:16:26] that's where this word is materializing
[1:16:29] that's where these things are coming and
[1:16:31] maybe we can just end
[1:16:33] somewhere around here you know the word
[1:16:35] says but if you walk in the light
[1:16:37] as he is in the light i was just looking
[1:16:39] at that word there the light that
[1:16:41] actually means to shine or to make
[1:16:43] manifest
[1:16:45] so then it was light
[1:16:47] by the revealing of the word in our day
[1:16:49] that brings these sons of gods into
[1:16:51] manifestation
[1:16:54] without the message
[1:16:56] there's no manifestation of sons
[1:16:59] without the message there's no adoption
[1:17:03] without the message there's no
[1:17:05] perfection
[1:17:07] because the message is christ the word
[1:17:11] and you are part of that word what is it
[1:17:15] it's the same word it's the same power
[1:17:20] but it's in bright form
[1:17:23] oh my
[1:17:24] we got something to praise god about we
[1:17:27] got something to be thankful for
[1:17:30] oh the prophet of god said in uh the
[1:17:33] same message god's only provided place
[1:17:35] of worship he said we are flesh
[1:17:38] and bone of him
[1:17:40] as long as we are the bride of christ do
[1:17:43] you believe that all right he died for
[1:17:46] us
[1:17:47] and we died to ourselves and were buried
[1:17:49] in his name
[1:17:51] that we would no more be of the world
[1:17:54] but in him
[1:17:55] by which both the family in heaven is
[1:17:57] named after jesus christ
[1:17:59] that's ephesians 1 21 for both heaven
[1:18:02] the family now listen to this now this
[1:18:04] this really pulls many things together
[1:18:08] remember our even our opening text the
[1:18:10] place that he chose to put his name
[1:18:12] right
[1:18:13] we're seeing a type there in the old
[1:18:15] testament but now the prophet is going
[1:18:17] to just pull everything right together
[1:18:19] here he says
[1:18:20] he says
[1:18:22] now
[1:18:24] of which both the family in heaven is
[1:18:26] named after jesus christ
[1:18:29] that's ephesians 1 21 for both heaven
[1:18:32] the family in heaven what's the family
[1:18:35] in heaven named
[1:18:38] jesus
[1:18:39] what's the family on earth named well
[1:18:43] that's the house
[1:18:45] of god where the blood's at
[1:18:48] oh my i got excited about that when i
[1:18:50] read that today i started to think about
[1:18:52] how people get all uh confused and
[1:18:54] worried and start wondering about the
[1:18:55] mercy seat and if there's no more blood
[1:18:57] on
[1:18:59] come on
[1:19:03] we're bathed in it we're washed in it
[1:19:06] we're cleansed it you want to know where
[1:19:07] the blood is follow that bleeding bloody
[1:19:09] word
[1:19:11] amen
[1:19:13] he said well that's the house of god
[1:19:14] where the blood's at is that right
[1:19:16] that's the door that's the gate
[1:19:19] that's the place he put his name
[1:19:23] follow that again right let's back up
[1:19:24] there
[1:19:26] what's the family honor where's the
[1:19:27] family on earth
[1:19:30] where's the house of god on earth
[1:19:32] a body that has prepared me
[1:19:35] written epistles read of all men
[1:19:38] where's the kingdom of heaven don't go
[1:19:40] looking out there
[1:19:42] where is the kingdom of heaven
[1:19:43] it's in you
[1:19:45] it's in you where is god today
[1:19:47] where is the pillar fire where is those
[1:19:49] licks of the pillar it's in you
[1:19:52] it's in you so what is he saying here he
[1:19:54] says what's the family on earth named
[1:19:57] well that's the house of god where the
[1:19:59] blood said is that right that's the door
[1:20:01] that's the gate that's the place he put
[1:20:04] his name and the word
[1:20:06] was made flesh
[1:20:09] and dwelt among us
[1:20:13] it's the word reflecting and sparking
[1:20:17] off the age that you're living in
[1:20:21] it's the word sparking in you
[1:20:25] it's the word being manifested in you
[1:20:27] and i want to say that god is duty bound
[1:20:30] to his word
[1:20:33] oh praise his name i'll just invite the
[1:20:34] musicians
[1:20:37] but god is duty bound to his word
[1:20:39] remember there in the morning service we
[1:20:42] talked about how when moses he turned
[1:20:44] aside to see what this great side site
[1:20:46] was with the the the pillar of fire
[1:20:50] there on the mountain he said oh moses
[1:20:53] take off thy shoes for the ground that
[1:20:55] you're standing on is holy ground well
[1:20:57] it wasn't so much the it wasn't so much
[1:20:59] the mountain or the ground that was holy
[1:21:01] but it was because that pillar of fire
[1:21:04] because the presence of god was there
[1:21:07] that's what made it holy
[1:21:09] and the prophet of god would say it like
[1:21:11] this
[1:21:12] he would say there's no holy man there's
[1:21:14] no holy church it's the holy ghost not a
[1:21:18] holy church a holy people it's a holy
[1:21:21] ghost among a people that's what it is
[1:21:25] see not a holy mountain where peter and
[1:21:26] them stood the mountain wasn't holy but
[1:21:29] it's a holy god on the mountain that
[1:21:32] made it holy not a holy person it's the
[1:21:35] holy ghost used in that person what
[1:21:39] makes it all you are a holy people a
[1:21:42] chosen generation a royal priesthood
[1:21:45] where the word is being manifested and
[1:21:48] the presence of god is abiding right
[1:21:50] here in this group of believers here
[1:21:52] this evening
[1:21:54] oh my
[1:21:55] the place wherein you're standing
[1:22:02] i'm not so much interested
[1:22:05] in the church building
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:09] i've gone and been able to seem
[1:22:13] me and brother andrew we went down i
[1:22:14] believe
[1:22:15] maybe it was in dallas or another city
[1:22:17] name but brother branham preached some
[1:22:19] services here and there's a picture with
[1:22:21] a pillar of fire
[1:22:23] settled down on his shoulder you can
[1:22:25] even go there today and you can walk up
[1:22:28] to that door
[1:22:29] and i don't know there's just something
[1:22:30] about standing there and just to think
[1:22:33] my
[1:22:35] 60 years ago
[1:22:37] the prophet stood here
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:43] the pillar of fire
[1:22:45] was right here
[1:22:47] many times we want to go to sabino
[1:22:49] canyon
[1:22:52] we want to go over here and
[1:22:54] sometimes we wonder oh if
[1:22:57] maybe if i can just go back to when i
[1:22:59] first met the lord
[1:23:01] maybe you think to a place and maybe
[1:23:03] sometimes in our minds we start to think
[1:23:05] well if
[1:23:06] maybe if i could just go to some place
[1:23:08] and sometimes i feel like
[1:23:10] we're cast down and a little sad and
[1:23:13] there jesus is drawing nigh and saying
[1:23:16] what are you so sad about
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:18] what are you so sad about you're like oh
[1:23:21] are you a stranger from around here
[1:23:24] we're looking back in the past at
[1:23:26] memorials and relics
[1:23:29] and failing to recognize
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:32] that you're the manifestation of the
[1:23:34] word in this hour
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:38] that's a god in history
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:43] that's history
[1:23:44] but where is god tonight
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:47] he's in you
[1:23:49] where is the message of the hour
[1:23:52] you are the message
[1:23:55] you are the place of manifestation
[1:23:58] so i'm not so much interested
[1:24:00] in the history
[1:24:02] but i'm interested
[1:24:04] in that word
[1:24:06] i'm interested in that holy ghost i'm
[1:24:08] interested in that pillar of fire
[1:24:11] as i thought on these things you know so
[1:24:13] many people
[1:24:15] you know they they're they're
[1:24:18] they're they're maybe looking for
[1:24:22] prophecy to be fulfilled in the future
[1:24:25] and as i thought about this you know
[1:24:27] some people are are concerned with with
[1:24:31] maybe this move over here and that move
[1:24:33] over there and and maybe they're looking
[1:24:35] for some big revival and some people you
[1:24:37] know they're looking for the prophet to
[1:24:38] return
[1:24:40] some people are looking for a tent
[1:24:42] vision
[1:24:45] some people are looking for some further
[1:24:47] manifestation of the word to bring them
[1:24:49] into their position
[1:24:52] but you know as i thought about that
[1:24:55] you know when the prophet was there he
[1:24:56] had that tent vision
[1:24:59] and he was standing there in that
[1:25:00] cathedral-like tent and he said there
[1:25:02] was a platform and there's a little
[1:25:03] wooden building over there
[1:25:05] and he said that pillar of fire the
[1:25:07] angel lord that was standing with him it
[1:25:09] moved from over there over the top of
[1:25:10] that little building
[1:25:13] and it went in there
[1:25:15] and he said i'll meet you in there this
[1:25:18] is the third pool
[1:25:24] he said i'll meet you in there that is
[1:25:26] the third pool well that was the pillar
[1:25:29] of fire that went into that little place
[1:25:32] and said i'll meet you in there that is
[1:25:34] the third pool well many people are
[1:25:36] looking for a future manifestation but i
[1:25:39] want to tell you the pillar of fire is
[1:25:41] here tonight in this room
[1:25:46] oh you say brother matthew what are you
[1:25:47] talking about i don't believe it you

[1:25:52] know i sat in the pew as a skeptic
[1:25:53] myself i heard brothers stand in the
[1:25:56] pulpit and they would say the angel the
[1:25:57] lord is here and i thought in my
[1:25:59] righteous indonation who gives you the
[1:26:01] authority to say that
[1:26:03] who where what are you trying to make
[1:26:05] yourself
[1:26:06] who are you trying to make yourself out
[1:26:07] to be
[1:26:10] but by god's grace something in me
[1:26:13] gave a man a benefit that a doubt and
[1:26:15] i'll say you know what
[1:26:18] maybe there's something in there what
[1:26:20] would give them the authority you know
[1:26:21] what gives a man to say give gives the
[1:26:23] man that authority the word of god
[1:26:26] he said the angel of the lord and camps
[1:26:29] around about them that fear his name as
[1:26:32] there are people that have gathered
[1:26:34] themselves together on a sunday evening

[1:27:57] you don't have to wait for some tent
[1:27:58] vision

[1:28:02] in there
[1:28:04] tonight
[1:28:05] you don't have to wait any longer

[1:28:12] holy ghost but if you go in there
[1:28:17] i'll meet you in there
[1:28:19] see i'm not so much interested in the
[1:28:22] little building
[1:28:24] i'm not so much interested in the
[1:28:25] mountain
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:27] it was that pillar of fire
[1:28:30] that moses was in the presence of
[1:28:33] that's what changed him that's what
[1:28:35] commissioned him
[1:28:37] and it was that god that spoke to him
[1:28:39] and said
[1:28:40] he said to him
[1:28:43] in exodus 3 12
[1:28:45] he said certainly i will be with thee
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:50] well god had commissioned moses to take
[1:28:52] his children in an exodus
[1:28:54] god has commissioned you to fulfill this
[1:28:56] word
[1:28:57] but he's telling moses he said certainly
[1:28:59] i'll be with you and this shall be a
[1:29:01] token unto you
[1:29:04] that i have sent thee when thou hast
[1:29:05] brought forth the people out of egypt
[1:29:08] you shall serve god upon this mountain
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:13] moses knew right there
[1:29:17] no matter what from this day forward
[1:29:20] he could go down to egypt the most
[1:29:22] mighty nation in the world
[1:29:24] on a donkey with a stick
[1:29:28] but he knew thus saith the lord
[1:29:30] i'm going back to that mountain
[1:29:33] and nothing can stop that from coming to
[1:29:36] pass
[1:29:37] and moses when he went down there and
[1:29:39] fulfilled the commission of god
[1:29:42] there was a day
[1:29:44] he came back to that mountain
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:48] and he could turn around to those people
[1:29:49] and say this day
[1:29:52] this scripture
[1:29:54] is fulfilled
[1:29:56] maybe i could say it like this
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:00] we've heard a message
[1:30:02] said there will be an invincible army
[1:30:06] said there would be a bride without spot
[1:30:07] or wrinkle
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:11] said that she would rise up in the last
[1:30:13] day that should be predestinated not to
[1:30:14] fall
[1:30:16] i can look out upon the congregation
[1:30:21] there's scripture that says in a moment
[1:30:23] and a twinkle of an eye you'll be saying
[1:30:25] there's people
[1:30:26] sitting here
[1:30:28] with that promised word in their heart
[1:30:30] there is a people a perfect
[1:30:33] that have caught the revelation of this
[1:30:35] message and you know what i can stand
[1:30:37] here and say
[1:30:38] this day
[1:30:40] this scripture
[1:30:42] is fulfilled heavenly father how we love
[1:30:46] you lord you're so gracious to us
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] to think oh god that you have
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:57] you've shared your
[1:31:00] your whole mind
[1:31:02] you've shared your whole plan
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:06] lord i thought tonight we would take a
[1:31:08] moment of thanksgiving
[1:31:11] on a thanksgiving holiday weekend
[1:31:15] to just thank you lord
[1:31:18] for calling us
[1:31:19] thank you for electing us
[1:31:22] thank you for choosing us lord
[1:31:26] i thought how maybe we would think back
[1:31:28] to maybe when we were teenagers and
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:31] maybe before we knew you and
[1:31:33] just start to go down memory lane and
[1:31:36] to think of what would have come of us
[1:31:38] if you didn't call our name
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:41] the lord we're here tonight
[1:31:44] oh god if you didn't intervene
[1:31:47] i would either be dead or in prison
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:52] i just want to tell you thank you lord
[1:31:56] thank you for your grace
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:31:59] lord you spoke a word concerning me
[1:32:01] before i even ever came on the scene
[1:32:05] and to think no devil in hell can stop
[1:32:08] that
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:09] god may there be a faith rise up in us
[1:32:12] tonight that we'll be fully persuaded to
[1:32:15] go from these doors
[1:32:17] knowing who we are more than ever
[1:32:19] knowing that we are the manifestation of
[1:32:22] the sons of god that we've received a

[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:35] if you could come dismiss us
[1:39:41] maybe i can leave you with this
[1:39:46] i thought i might
[1:39:49] have gotten to
[1:39:51] a thought of what a thanksgiving
[1:39:54] you know brother branham preached
[1:39:57] invisible union of the bride of jesus
[1:39:59] christ
[1:40:00] on 11 25.
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:03] you know that was
[1:40:04] that's the anniversary of my mom and dad
[1:40:07] and
[1:40:08] brother branham said it's if he could
[1:40:10] have chose any age to live and as he
[1:40:12] starts to talk about this message i
[1:40:14] would have lived in this age because it
[1:40:15] it's a golden age and i thought i hear
[1:40:18] my pastor my mom and dad they're
[1:40:19] celebrating their golden anniversary and
[1:40:22] they were married on that same day
[1:40:23] invisible union and i just thought
[1:40:26] as i come to service maybe we'd have a
[1:40:28] time to reflect and be thankful
[1:40:30] for what god's done
[1:40:32] because the prophet would say there in
[1:40:34] that message you would say
[1:40:36] god slipped the wedding band of
[1:40:38] predestination onto your finger
[1:40:42] and i started to think about that he
[1:40:44] said oh what merited grace
[1:40:46] oh what unmerited favor
[1:40:49] he said oh what a thanksgiving
[1:40:53] and i started in my mind to think about
[1:40:56] that predestinated wedding band
[1:40:59] and started to think about all them
[1:41:01] years
[1:41:03] that i was out there in sin i was
[1:41:04] wearing that wedding bag
[1:41:11] he was never gonna lose you
[1:41:14] you were always
[1:41:16] his i was talking to brother jackson
[1:41:22] oh we were teenagers
[1:41:24] we were out in the world
[1:41:26] we should have been dead or in prison
[1:41:30] but you know what kept you brother
[1:41:32] jackson
[1:41:34] you're wearing a wedding band of
[1:41:35] predestination
[1:41:37] do you want to know why you're here
[1:41:38] tonight
[1:41:41] because he slipped that wedding band of
[1:41:42] predestination on your finger
[1:41:46] he said she's mine
[1:41:48] he's mine devil you can't have her
[1:41:51] you can't have him take your hands off
[1:41:52] of them
[1:41:55] but he was waiting for that day
[1:41:58] that you would turn your heart and say
[1:41:59] lord
[1:42:02] i need you
[1:42:04] i need your lord
[1:42:06] and ever since then
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:09] oh what a thanksgiving
[1:42:12] to thank god for what he's done for us
[1:42:14] brother darien
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:25] what a privilege it is for us
[1:42:27] just thank you for all that you are the
[1:42:30] reality of who you are
[1:42:32] not just in letter form not just in
[1:42:35] pages in the message or
[1:42:37] the voice of brother branham but lord
[1:42:39] god in a reality to our souls today
[1:42:42] not another age as we just heard
[1:42:45] the age the best age for the bride to
[1:42:48] manifest you lord jesus not of our own
[1:42:50] ability but by your divine grace
[1:42:55] what and
