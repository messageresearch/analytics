special you deserve the glory [Music] you deserve the glory [Music] is [Music] there [Music] is no one [Music] um uh quick testimony um back in nigeria you know it's easy to speak about the message of the howard to people because i don't i wouldn't be worried about being fired at work or talking about what i believe but coming to the states is a little different when your job will tell you you know you don't speak about religion or what now you don't i mean that's one of the things that would give you in the handbook and whatnot like you got to be careful you know to speak on what it is that you believe because some people might just take offense and whatnot and so you know it's something that usually brought in my mind because i like to speak about it i like to talk about it i like to say things you know like our women don't put on pants and it sounds weird to to them like what do you say we don't women don't put on things that pertain to a man and things like that just talk about some you know the core beliefs that we we have that stands out from them so they it attracts them they want to hear more but but you know at my place of work you know i've just been going in this you know and it's been disturbing me that you know how am i living my life have they seen something that looks a little different and would want to ask the question but i've been struggling with that because nobody asked me the question i just look like i'm the same with them so okay and i was like okay i think that's just number on friday they would sit down and they say happy hour they want to they want to drink they they have it stuck in the fridge they just want to have a good time and so you know i'll show up there and i'll just say water might seem you know feel a little good if you guys drink water and i step out i'll just go home and so all of a sudden um i think on monday i got to work and then my assistant told me and said oh there was a blow up at work i was like what do you mean and he said uh well the hr with some of the person was having a problem about vaccine taking vaccine or not taking vaccine and one of them took the vaccine one of them wouldn't take the vaccine because of religious reason and then there was a scream they were going at each other and screaming and then um i think she sat down and now asked if all the people and say what is it about mark david what is just different don't you guys notice something different about that dude that guy is he is he muslim is he what what is something special about him and my coach my colleague said well we think he's a christian he you know when we sit down here and drink on friday he doesn't drink with us you know you have he comes and you know talk to us and just leave um and so she personally came to my office and i'm talking about the hr person and walked in my office and said i just want to ask you a question i hope it's it's not going to be weird why what is different about you what do you believe you know i have a religion that i believe i don't want to take the vaccine but people are just looking at me like i'm weird and so we sat down for almost an hour just talking about the message just talking about the message to her and she just look she said i've been going around looking for something that can satisfy my soul me and my family and my husband and you know i haven't just heard anything but you were telling me something that i haven't heard before just even going back to the garden of eden and i talked about what happened in the garden of eden she was amazed my boss walked in and said i need you in two minutes i was there almost 30 minutes after that two minutes just talking to her and so i i was very happy and i said you know for someone to just call out and say what is different i want to know something about i want to know what he knows what is different about him and it wasn't like anything was distinct about me at work um and so but just to see that uh i was just very happy about that and i said god oh lord i want to do more i want to speak more about your word um so that's the first spot sorry to talk too much now my family this week there's a lot of birthday my wife's birthday was this week i want to thank god for another life for another year my mom's birthday is today i want to thank god for that as well and my daughter's birthday is this weekend so i want to thank god for that my eldest sister's birthday is the same day as my daughter so yeah i hope you know what that means uh um so we we we when we sing happy birthday to ourself uh we usually like to also sing this song where we will never grow old um you know knowing fully well that if the law tarries you know one day we'll be you know with the saints that once you know left before us but then even before then i just want to appreciate you know we appreciate ourselves and just sing and be happy and celebrate ourself and so i sing that song this evening i have heard of a land on the far away strength there's a beautiful home of the soul built by jesus a night there will never shall die this a land where we never grow home never grow old never grow in a land where we'll never grow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] we never shut down [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] and our voices will blend with the love once you've gone on before [Music] well [Applause] [Music]

of the lord jesus christ i believe it's a great privilege for us to be gathered in the presence of the lord [Music] uh let's open our bibles don't leave the mark we're going to start in the book of mark osha to this chapter 10. um verse 17 to uh 27-30 17-26 that's your test then say that one two three 27-30 thank you god bless you we mark this event jesus and jesus looked unto them and said with men it is impossible but not with god pierce was i'm sorry for with god everything is all things are possible then peter said unto him lo we have left all things and have followed and that followed [Music] and jesus answered and said unto and said verily i say unto you there is no man that had left house house and or brothers or sisters and fathers or mothers or wife or children or land for my sake and the gospels but i will i shall but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time in this time a hundredfold now in this time houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and land and and with persecutions with the world to come eternal life uh let's turn to uh the book of john chapter 14. chapter 14 and verse 1 to 3. it says book of john chapter 14 verse 1 to 3 says let not your heart be troubled believe me in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mentioned and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare you a place i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you if i come again i will receive you unto myself that where i am that ye may be also. lord jesus be in your course bless his words once again in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen from the few scriptures that we read [Music] the lord i put on my heart to speak on this little title prepared when i was getting ready for the subject i had written it as a title i reckon pants then as i was getting ready to come to church something kind of just started rising up in my heart and there's a story that brother branham tells that came to my heart [Music] but i'm telling the story about a ship captain pondokin la vigue as he was navigating the capitol someone who could read something in the bible for him hey there's this young child that came all happily willie preet and it was called willie pruitt and he opened the bible in isaiah 53. [Music] he started reading the book of isaiah [Music] he was reading in isaiah 50 53 yeah one two five 53 from one through five it says uh who had who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed yeah he said to unto the arm of the lord revealed it says and he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the the root out of the dry ground he had no form no comeliness when he shall when we shall when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and the in and and we hit his we hid as it were our face from him he was it was uh despised and and this and the steam and they steam him not surely he had bore our griefs and our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed and this young men read this portion of the scripture to the captain and he said to the captain that's how it's written in the bible but i'll try to read to you like my mom used to read to me how my mother taught me how to read the bible when my mother was reading this bible it is there he she was saying [Music] he was wounded for the transgression of willy pruitt he was bruised for the iniquity of willy pruitt the chastisement of of peace that was upon him was for willy pruitt and with his stripes that's why willy pruitt is here and not touch the heart off the captain and and captain said oh young man can you read it again now putting my name in it and he took again the bible he was wounded for the iniquity of john quartz the chastisement of peace that fall upon just uh the apollo that fall upon him it was for john paul [Music] and it was by his stripes that john paul john court was healed and the captain by listening to this he had sufficient faith and he was healed he don't confess that so when i read that as i was coming by studying i came across that every one of us put their names in it because it shows the group that there may not be something of just a group question that it may not be some a collective something because you're considering but that i may consider that what jesus said it's for me that he said what he promised as recompense it's for me that he promised a creature when we read the scripture of mark chapter 10 when you read the story you go up a little bit you read the story you start from verse 17. we see that it's a story of the rich young ruler who came to jesus he came to jesus did he vomit he said good master referees what shall i do to inherit the king the eternal life he says jesus said why do you call me good that's a justin there's only one good and that's god he said you you know the commandment you're not going to kill you know fully up you won't steal you know that you won't commit adultery if you're up on the foot you're not going to give wrong testimonies and this young man told jesus he said i i i observe all this since my youth like i said particularly it was a particular young man i couldn't tell him that i lived all the ten commandments since my it says i see that you're lacking something eat the mocking shoes they you're lacking when this young man looked at all the riches that he had and to think about everything that he had when the bible talks about riches he looked at the consideration that he had among people and follow these people that everybody is criticizing the young men looked at all it is riches he he said it's it's it's it's easy for the camel to go to the eye of the needle than it is for the rich to a rich man to enter the kingdom of god it's the last condition and that was is something hard for the disciples that's goddamn that was difficult for them the countries don't distribute vacations and when they talked with jesus jesus said what is impossible to man it's possible to god and brother branham adds because possible that what's impossible to men nepal solomon possibly and that's where peter asked the question and said everything that we live in our lives sometimes we ask ourselves a question what is our recompense what is it paid what is what are we gaining by living this different life and jesus looked at them he said no one who because of me who has left his family his house that farm his wife his children everything that he has to follow he said the recompense that i will give him don't associate with prison i will give him a hundredfold the amazon the house the lambs the fair the brothers the the sisters hear jesus our master not with senior our lord he's telling us that if we follow him and we'll have a recompense on the other side that's why when we read that loop say we can think of listen that means that everyone who follows the lord we'll have a lot of money i'll have good houses we'll have a lot of languages because jesus said because it's jesus who promised it messenger he knows what to give to his children jesus knows every single one of us because you connect and limit the second jesus knows everyone's limit jesus separated jesus knows because you don't offer jonathan that if i give to brother jonathan and below the dollar of the sales person a million dollar salary per week he's very selfish that he can he will he will serve me with her he'll ever do that he will give him it he said and he knows that the teacher don't afraid paul that if i give to brother paul a million dollar person a thousand dollars a week if i'm abundant he will leave me he will not do that so he won't give it to me pascal is second should kill me because he knows that he wants you to follow him your value donation then in what i will give him it's not going to be for him to be okay it's not for him to be lifted up that he may know the lord in it look at peter and john the devil in in front of the get called beautiful if god gave them money he's always donated they would have given money to that person jesus didn't give them money but when they presented themselves to him they said we have no money we have no kids they didn't have it stand up and walk god gives us a recompense here on earth that's terrible we've done the mirror shots certainly god gives us gives us good things here on earth everything that god gives us is good job god can give me a little donut please and give more to another brother but everything that he does is beautiful the same way he says in genesis country like creative shows when he created something he said that was good forever and everything that god does is good two seconds everything that he wants take a new demo that we may abide in his word can we continue that we continue to follow him says when this young man laughed he prospered even more prosperity that which means the prosperity was not a sign that god was with him as i don't even have enough places to store all of this the the scriptures is the the god told him uh fool your soul will be required this night and the bible says this young this this this uh rich man died and the lazarus who was poor also died he thought that his recompense was only on earth he just thought that his recompense was only the goods or the riches he realized that he found himself it was in the lost land he continued and when he when he looks up don't say tomorrow in the tormentary wars if while a prophet understands he sees lazarus on the other side on the bosom of abraham he said oh father abraham the one that lasted the plungers used to do i don't know if you can ask lazarus to just put his finger in the water and just to to drop a drop of a droplet of water on my tongue it was it was negotiating just for a drop of water to him who had everything when he was on earth but he rejected eternal life he was conscious that he didn't have eternal life he knew he didn't have it he had he had the opportunity within this life because of material riches the father abraham tells him it says there is a chasm between us and you yeah no way for glazer to even cross over to do anything he said oh father abraham i understand because you suppose that i'm lost but i have five brothers that they may they may accept this double recompense the recompense here on earth and the recompense on the other side lasher stole them to them the word of god the same way that you had the opportunity to listen to the gospel and you rejected them also god is giving them the same opportunity to hear the word yet if they reject you they will follow the same road but god promises the recompense recompense the scripture says it's a rewarder of all of them that diligently seek after yeah it's the best boss that ever existed because we want to compare ourselves with the world because we want to compare ourselves with somebody else but he said you if you miss it he said uh uh mr evil that you are that you are you are able to give good things to your children how much more your heavenly father is he will always give us the good recompense they don't think which means when we agreed to become a christian we knew the acceptance of civilization when we accept to follow the lord accepted when we agreed to to follow the word we have to be conscious the proof of election that that temptation and uh tests and persecutions are not components it's part of our reward it's part of the bonus of our salary and the bible says that the the trying of our faith the project can get to the mail that's what produces something good god uses trials and temptations so he can make us perfect fulfill the veritas defeated to make us true sons and daughters to him when he was talking about the beatitudes a wrong or a false testimony for you on you because of me if you can't confess when they do that because of my name you have to be happy you shouldn't be sad efficient church didn't jesus say blessed are you when you are persecuted for righteousness he never said to start getting formal he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for they persecuted the prophets which were before you elijah he said that he said that that was in the beatitude in matthew chapter 5 blessed are you why you have a people that make fun of you that make fun of you because you love the lord jesus it is sachin benedict it is a blessing just to have them say it kill the existence that they may just say it lost benedict when they are cursing you they are bringing god's blessing down unto you when people curse you when people persecute you back up with them because you love the lord in the forecast benedict's under justice they're just attracting the blessings of god on you so when you have persecutions god brings the blessings that's his recompense he said be happy be exceeding every time somebody is mocking you because you are a christian yeah he brings the they're backfired on them when they try to make fun of you for being a christian it backs fires on them and god gives you the blessings because because blessed are you when ye shall be persecuted for my name's sake according you have the impression that god is quiet are you under the impression that god is no longer listening we develop a prayer jeff without the under the impression that god forsake you but he can never forsake you he's waiting at what time to bring his blessings they got the job look at job settlement this man who was uh perfect to him to a man to whom god wanted to bring a testimony to the devil achieve him did you see my servant there's no man there's no perfect man like him of it and god knew because that god job had all these reaches they telling me that he could have he should have loved him and to look to serve him with all of that and he knew that even if god was to take all of that that god could not he could not forsake the lord and if god knows that you don't approve that he gives you a little bit of what god is giving you as recompense here on earth be in exceedingly gladness for what god has given you because that's what he feels is good for you he stayed firm the job he came to take his health job he didn't see what was happening between god and satan he didn't know even when god told satan i give you i give you the authority to touch him measure my unlimited but i get i put a limit no douchebag don't touch his life job didn't he said oh if i can go and knock at his door put how far can we move forward with him job stayed firm and when jobs stayed firm the recompense came to follow gave him the vision of the resurrection oh come to your earliest job when god talked to job that day wrong job was different as you said he still had the boils on him it says even in this body it's destroyed i don't care if this body goes i don't care but i know my redeemer live it just say i know because that i will see him it's not going to be the eyes of somebody else it was a revelation an individual revelation himself to him personally he understood that his persecution it was a recompense and because of that god give him back his health that the persecution legend the prostitute woman who went to simon says he came to the feet of jesus and she started crying at the feet of jesus and she cried jesus jesus was quiet she didn't know what was going to happen but what she did she was doing something for the lord she said the lord lord i will do this for you lord i i i i forsake my sacrifice i forgive me for my prostitution jesus i'm tired i want to i'm in the middle of all these pharisees but perhaps they will they will throw stones at me she didn't ask yourself a question what am i doing is it i'll continue to i'll continue to follow him and she took everything that she was preaching the hair and i feel like she started wiping the hair the feet of jesus she took the most expensive perfume she put on jesus face the neck allah found himself it's only until the service ended that jesus said yes i'm happy with you it says woman they're not working for the pharisees that were there they take them and blaspheme it was like a blasphemous who's this man i'll just take an example like that yeah they think there was one who owed five thousand dollars and the others oh a hundred dollars possibility and both of them they didn't have the possibility to pay the credit now the one who they owe the money to forgive all their debts which of the two would have been more thankful [Music] except the even though the lord seemed to have been quiet continue when you continue our voice continue to go forward continue to walk that benedict the blessing way of recompensing us and we know that we always have to hold firm because you will notice that every time that god spoke to the messenger through the church ages there was always a message of encouragement for the believers pull exactly to exalt them so they can always be victorious basketball to you answer because you always say to him that overcometh you should do nearly i will give i shall be given to him that overcometh don't suck casually in every a church age on a palliative ankle it spoke of overcomers you cannot have overcomers don't kill yet the battalion without the battle sunken yet to come back without the fight they don't say no so if we want to be overcomers let's let's consider that we have a recompense the persecution the persecutions let the proof the the trials it's part of the recompense but one of them says don't lose in the message we have seen his story and i've come to worship him and he says and sometimes we think that our burden is it says that i might inject this right here it says that we think that our burdens are so heavy sometimes that there is nothing like it in the world do you know that all those things are for your good for you sorry do you know that all those things are good for you they are all they are all to mold you i will fascinate to make you the prophet elisa prophets and sages was molded on the backside of the desert and the persecution in the hot sun in the blazing sun through tribulations and trials and persecution in in persecutions and these things that we have today there's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other christians before us other christian has had to stand in the hour of darkness like this and even be fed to lions for their testimonies and then we take down a little pristi a little prestige and sometimes we think we are epia you should it says well well i belong to so and so uh this certain church uh you know it says i'm afraid i'll bring reproach if i need [Applause] don't be afraid of your testimony for jesus christ shed forth is your light position stand for your convictions to you that he is the son of god you need a visit to well mr it says and this is not a night for chris crinkle uh for crinkle or chris crinkle but it's the birth of jesus christ we are celebrating and we see that god promises a reward or recompense that we have to be able to act to access that recompense but how is god helping us to access this recompense god is helping us access this reward in giving us his faith in giving us his power and if my word abides in you demon ask what you will and that will be given unto you it means when we keep the word of god when we follow the word of god everything that we ask him is he will give it to us but i tell you concealer that if the thing is for you to be lost he will not give it unto you but he's giving us all his power says he says when he was crucified he gave us access to all the blessings that he gave access to our pardon for our sins he gave access for the for the salvation of our souls it says amen cut every obstacle for from human being that they might be connected like in the garden of eden it says i was i i was going to to choke it but i'm going to say it love it man is omnipotent [Music] it says you don't believe that but a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent they don't circumcise what god is asking us said that separate my pleasure access to everything that we have need of it they did not say in mark 11 and 22 that whatsoever things you say don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass what happened when two omnipotence myths when god and man come together something it's got to shake whatever whatever whatever whatever you would say to that creative power of the omnipotent god for me knowing that is promised ella nonsense and he said it in his word speculation it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings the thing to pass the shots come sensitive things that are not it makes them those answer the word because two omnipotent power have met the last opposition there he stands oh nothing foreign and most time we don't recognize our position we don't recognize our reward or our recompense we're not we're not claiming our recompense to but there was not where i we have a body as theophany body kidnapping that has to influence this mortal body this natural mortal body that cannot inherit the kingdom but what we know regardless of how we leave the earth but i know there's a body this is the day this body drops that body will take place and he said he's preparing us a place that where he is that we may be also but god is preparing us here that's why he told he sent us a wonderful message the bible says the one who receives the prophet receive the rewards of the prophet what is different from us and the denomination to have the natural blessings mr massage as shoot but this message is added through the
