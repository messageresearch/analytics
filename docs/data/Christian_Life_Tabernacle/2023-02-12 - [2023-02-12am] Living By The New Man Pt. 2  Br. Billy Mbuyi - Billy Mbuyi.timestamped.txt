[10:19] Matthew to come and just open our
[10:21] service in prayer this morning before we
[10:23] get started if he just comes at this
[10:25] time

[10:48] [Music]
[10:51] we're looking to you Lord we want to
[10:53] look past the veil of man
[10:58] and see you standing here Lord in the
[11:00] midst of your church in the midst of
[11:02] your congregation
[11:04] Lord we know that we've come
[11:07] assembled under
[11:10] the great promise that you are with us
[11:12] not only are you with us but you are in

[11:22] Calvary we thank you for the blood we
[11:24] thank you for the sacrifice Lord
[11:27] we just want to be in one mind and one
[11:28] Accord this morning so we just ask for
[11:31] the Forgiveness of our sins Lord
[11:34] where we failed you in our iniquities
[11:36] where we've come up short
[11:38] but we're thankful there's a blood
[11:39] sacrifice to atone for our sins this
[11:41] morning we know in ourselves we're
[11:44] unworthing we know that there's nothing
[11:46] that we could do to Merit the grace
[11:48] there's no works that we could perform
[11:50] that would make us worthy to go in
[11:52] behind the veil this morning but because
[11:55] you climbed a Hill Called Golgotha you
[11:58] spread forth your arms and you said it
[12:00] was finished and you shed your blood to
[12:01] atone for our sins once and for all and
[12:04] you've said there's therefore now no
[12:05] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[12:08] Jesus Lord we identify with the promise
[12:11] this morning we identify with the word
[12:13] this morning Lord that we are forgiven
[12:15] Lord and if then we've been forgiven and
[12:18] we've been Justified Lord there should
[12:20] be a freedom in the house of God lord

[14:00] right by the mic at this time for a
[14:01] Psalm reading
[14:05] thank you
[14:12] foreign
[14:26] you know we over the last few weeks at
[14:28] work we've been uh it's been a
[14:30] significant amount of reorganization
[14:31] going on where uh
[14:34] you know new leadership coming in new
[14:36] ideas new organizations and
[14:39] you know we're going through this parade
[14:41] of being reintroduced to new Executives
[14:44] who all show up and want to declare how
[14:46] they're going to make our lives better
[14:48] how they're going to make our customers
[14:50] happier
[14:51] you know all the appropriate noises that
[14:52] you expect from a leadership team when
[14:55] they come in
[14:56] and um you know we were pulled into one
[14:58] of these all hands meetings this week
[14:59] and
[15:00] the sales leader got up and
[15:04] as part of introducing himself and the
[15:06] priorities for the year he
[15:08] presented his personal life plan
[15:13] and they're in front of hundreds or
[15:15] perhaps a thousand people
[15:18] he described in great detail
[15:21] his uh values his mission statement his
[15:26] plan and it was pretty comprehensive
[15:29] I mean it took a while to really absorb
[15:31] this thing
[15:33] um
[15:34] you know he had broken down his values
[15:36] into 10 things
[15:38] you know and he had built what he called
[15:40] a blueprint for his life
[15:43] and it uh it defined the life purpose he
[15:47] had established for himself 20 years ago
[15:51] and uh you know who he wants to be
[15:53] it laid out his mission statement
[15:57] um those are his words
[16:00] um of where he wanted to focus and then
[16:01] every year he reviewed and adjusted a
[16:04] personal
[16:05] one two I wrote this down I mean it I
[16:08] can't even think this make this up his
[16:09] personal one three five ten and 20-year
[16:13] plans as well as
[16:16] inking every year his rest of Life Plan
[16:22] he had a life coach
[16:24] he uh defined five daily practices that
[16:27] he maintains to keep himself disciplined
[16:31] his five core beliefs that sort of
[16:34] services goal post
[16:36] reading all of this
[16:38] you know at the bottom laying at the
[16:40] foundation of all of this
[16:42] was the this was all in a presentation
[16:45] was laying what I pretty quickly
[16:48] recognized
[16:50] were the attributes of the stature of
[16:52] the perfect man
[16:56] bill so I was looking at that and I
[16:58] thought for my first reaction was
[17:01] wow
[17:03] I am a worm
[17:05] and no man I mean I can barely make it
[17:07] through the lunch line and I mean he's
[17:09] got
[17:11] he's got everything laid out and my
[17:14] you know my second was that you know I'm
[17:17] a complete waste you know I've been
[17:19] failure but then I thought how
[17:21] exhausting is that
[17:24] I mean imagine how much time he spends
[17:26] keeping himself lined up with his 38
[17:29] point plan that he's been managing for
[17:32] the last 20 years
[17:35] you know but I thought about that as
[17:37] here he was he had it all figured out
[17:40] right
[17:42] this was his plan
[17:45] for how his life
[17:47] was going to go
[17:50] how he was directing himself
[17:53] looked good it looked amazing
[17:56] looked exhausting
[17:58] but you know as he was going through
[18:01] that the scripture came to my mind from
[18:03] Matthew 6.
[18:05] that said which of you
[18:07] by taking thought
[18:09] can add one cubit to his stature
[18:14] you know it it looks amazing but no
[18:16] matter how comprehensive up of a plan he
[18:19] may have
[18:21] he can no more govern or guarantee his
[18:24] future
[18:25] than anyone else
[18:30] you know here was his great plan sitting
[18:33] upon the stature of the perfect man
[18:37] you know I walked away from that and I
[18:39] thought you know there is only one
[18:41] perfect man
[18:45] and by the grace of God he's put us in
[18:47] contact with that blueprint
[18:52] you know the perfect man continues in
[18:54] Matthew 6 31 therefore take no thought
[18:58] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[19:01] we drink
[19:02] or wherewithal shall we be clothed
[19:05] verse 32 for your heavenly father
[19:07] knoweth
[19:09] that ye have need of all these things
[19:13] but seek ye first
[19:15] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[19:18] not my plan
[19:20] not my blueprint
[19:22] not my mission statement
[19:25] and all these things shall be added to
[19:27] you
[19:29] verse 34 take therefore no thought
[19:33] for the morrow
[19:35] let alone 20 years
[19:38] for the morrows shall take thought for
[19:40] the things of itself
[19:43] you know this business executive may
[19:45] have a great plan
[19:47] a compelling mission statement
[19:50] but I have another blueprint
[19:53] straight from the perfect man
[19:56] and you know he may have these thousands
[20:00] of things that he wants to attain to but
[20:03] this blueprint has one bullet point
[20:07] David says it in Psalm 27 4 One Thing
[20:11] have I desired
[20:13] and that will I seek after
[20:16] that I may dwell in the house of the
[20:18] Lord all the days of my life
[20:24] you know you want to talk about a
[20:26] blueprint for the perfect man we're
[20:27] going to read Psalm 132 this morning
[20:32] and we're going to read around you know
[20:34] Lord willing
[20:36] his blueprint his plan
[20:40] his mission statement
[20:43] you know the scriptures say that David
[20:45] was a man after God's Own Heart
[20:49] he had a heart just like that perfect
[20:51] one the perfect man
[20:55] you know what was his life plan
[20:59] we'll read it here in Psalm 132 it
[21:00] started he starts out with Lord remember
[21:02] David in all his afflictions how he
[21:04] swear unto the Lord and vowed unto the
[21:06] Mighty God of Jacob
[21:08] but then notice verse 3.
[21:11] surely
[21:12] I will not come into the Tabernacle of
[21:15] my house
[21:16] nor go up into my bed
[21:19] I will not give sleep to mine eyes nor
[21:21] Slumber to my eyelids
[21:23] until
[21:25] here's the goal
[21:27] here's the plan
[21:29] until I find out a place for the Lord
[21:33] inhabitation for the Mighty God of Jacob
[21:38] one thing have I desired
[21:41] and I will pour all my efforts into
[21:46] that will I seek after
[21:49] that I may find that place of his
[21:52] habitation
[21:54] that I may enter into that dwelling
[21:57] place with him
[21:58] and be found in his presence all the
[22:02] days of my life
[22:04] that's it that's the plan that's the
[22:06] mission statement
[22:11] verse 13 for the Lord has chosen Zion he
[22:14] hath desired it for his habitation
[22:17] this is my rest forever
[22:19] here will I dwell for I have desired it
[22:24] I will abundantly bless her provision
[22:27] I will satisfy her poor with bread
[22:30] I will also clothe her priests with
[22:32] salvation and her Saints shall shout
[22:36] aloud for joy
[22:39] our blueprint our mission statement not
[22:42] our 20-year Life Plan
[22:45] one thing have I desire
[22:47] that I may dwell in his house in his
[22:50] presence all the days of my life
[22:55] so let's read Psalm 132 together
[23:00] as much as I appreciate the more
[23:02] comprehensive business plans and
[23:04] personal goals that might be seen this
[23:06] is my prayer that this business plan
[23:09] that this mission statement if you will
[23:10] be found in my life
[23:12] let's read that together Psalm 132 Lord
[23:14] remember David and all his afflictions
[23:17] how he swear unto the Lord and vowed
[23:20] unto the Mighty God of Jacob surely I
[23:23] will not come into the Tabernacle of my
[23:25] house nor go up into my bed I will not
[23:28] give sleep to mine eyes or Slumber to
[23:31] mine eyelids until I found out a place
[23:34] for the Lord and habitation for the
[23:36] Mighty God of Jacob Lo we heard of it at
[23:39] Ephrata we found it in the fields of the
[23:42] wood we will go into his Tabernacles we
[23:45] will worship at his footstool arise O
[23:48] Lord into thy rest thou and the Ark of
[23:51] thy strength let thy priests be clothed
[23:53] with righteousness and let thy Saints
[23:56] shout for Joy for thy servant David's
[23:59] sake turn not away the face of thine
[24:01] anointed the Lord hath sworn in truth
[24:03] unto David he will not turn from it of
[24:07] the fruit of thy body will I set upon
[24:09] thy Throne If thy children will keep my
[24:12] Covenant and my testimony that I shall
[24:14] teach them their children shall also sit
[24:17] upon thy Throne forevermore for the Lord
[24:20] hath chosen Zion he had desired it for
[24:23] his habitation this is my rest forever
[24:26] here will I dwell for I have desired it
[24:29] I will abundantly bless her provision I
[24:32] will satisfy her poor with bread I will
[24:35] also clothe her priests with salvation
[24:37] and her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy
[24:40] there will I make the Horn of David to
[24:43] Bud I have ordained a lamb for mine
[24:45] anointed his enemies will I clothed with
[24:48] shame but upon himself shall his crown

[41:31] prayer request before the church this
[41:33] morning
[41:34] we're also going to invite the brothers
[41:36] to take the ties in the offing at this
[41:37] time
[41:39] brother Joel Avila has a
[41:41] request year for
[41:44] um
[41:47] brother Fausto Nieto he says he has
[41:49] cancer in his throat so just wants to
[41:52] remember him before the church this
[41:54] morning
[41:55] brother
[41:57] Benoit has a request for his father he
[42:01] says please keep my dad in prayer the
[42:04] doctor said that he has a pinched nerve
[42:07] and to be precise it's a sciatic nerve
[42:10] which is causing pain from his lower
[42:13] back all the way down to his legs and so
[42:16] he says we're believing for a miracle
[42:18] amen
[42:19] amen
[42:22] there's also prayer request here it says
[42:25] please pray for Mr Lewis
[42:27] he's an elderly homeless man in Dallas
[42:29] that he's received his apartment he says
[42:33] to get off the streets so he's been
[42:35] waiting for an apartment since December
[42:37] and so I believe we can have a heart for
[42:40] Daddy man

[55:49] also this morning we'll have a baptism
[55:53] sister Jeanette lulia will be baptized
[55:56] so we'll get ready right after uh
[55:58] service this morning let's open our
[56:01] Bibles in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 17.
[56:16] the scripture will say this therefore
[56:19] this I say therefore it says and testify
[56:23] in the Lord that ye
[56:25] henceforth walk not after the Gentile
[56:29] walk in the vanity of the minds it says
[56:32] having the under the understanding
[56:34] darkened being alienated from the life
[56:37] of God through the ignorance that is in
[56:41] them because of the blindness of the
[56:44] heart whom being passed uh past feeling
[56:48] have given themselves over
[56:52] untolessness to walk
[56:55] all uncleanness with greediness by ye
[57:00] have not so learned Christ I want you to
[57:03] think that now is is drawing a contrast
[57:06] between how they Gentile walk and how
[57:09] you should be walking it says if so be
[57:12] that ye have heard him and have been
[57:16] taught by him as the truth is in Jesus
[57:20] that ye put off concerning the former
[57:23] conversation the old man which is
[57:25] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[57:29] it says be renewed in the spirit of your
[57:33] mind
[57:34] that ye put on the new man he was
[57:38] wanting you to know how you're going to
[57:41] have a successful walk is by putting on
[57:43] the new man the former conversation the
[57:46] former thinking the way of doing things
[57:49] and the way of of approaching situations
[57:51] and saying I want you to put that off
[57:54] and you put on the mind of the new man
[57:58] and then he says which is after God is
[58:00] created in righteousness and true
[58:02] Holiness wherefore putting away lying
[58:05] and speaking every man truth with with
[58:08] his neighbor for we are members one of
[58:12] another let second Corinthians chapter 5
[58:15] and verse 17 we read it last time he
[58:18] says therefore If any man be in Christ
[58:22] he is a new creature old things will
[58:26] pass away behold all things are become
[58:29] new
[58:31] all things are passed away behold all
[58:35] things will become new in other words
[58:37] there is no correlation between what the
[58:40] old man was and what the new man is
[58:41] there is no something that could be
[58:44] brought over he said well this was good
[58:45] let's take it over now the old things
[58:48] will pass away everything has become new
[58:50] the thinking is new the way of approach
[58:53] is new the way of doing things is new
[58:55] let's also open and uh turn to Romans
[58:58] chapter 12 verse 1 it says I beseed you
[59:03] therefore brethren
[59:05] by the mercies of God that ye present
[59:08] your bodies a Living Sacrifice so is is
[59:13] exalting as he's praying is admonishing
[59:15] us to present our body as a Living
[59:18] Sacrifice a Living Sacrifice that we
[59:22] take our body we make it a victim
[59:27] you you make your body a victim you take
[59:30] your body you bring it under subjection
[59:33] you take your body you make it a slave
[59:35] you take your body you subject it to
[59:38] something
[59:39] and then it says holy uh uh sacrifice
[59:43] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[59:47] your reasonable service
[59:50] it says it says and be be not be not
[59:55] conformed old-fashioned according to the
[59:58] world it says
[1:00:00] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:00:04] it says that ye may prove what is good
[1:00:08] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:00:13] now think about this now what he's
[1:00:15] saying here be not conformed so don't
[1:00:18] follow Fashion After just following and
[1:00:20] trying to do it says but be it
[1:00:23] transformed in other words is to be
[1:00:25] changed from one form to another form
[1:00:27] when there's no trace of the old form at
[1:00:30] all there's a complete transformation by
[1:00:33] the renewing of your mind that ye prove
[1:00:36] that ye may prove that what is it what
[1:00:39] it what is that good and acceptable and
[1:00:41] perfect will of God let's just bow our
[1:00:43] heads our gracious father we're so
[1:00:45] thankful to be gathered in your presence
[1:00:46] Lord we ask that you speak to our hearts
[1:00:49] oh God father we we we so much gathered
[1:00:52] here for your word oh God and and know
[1:00:55] that we have needs and we have desires
[1:00:57] and all of those can only be fulfilled
[1:01:00] Lord by by being in your presence and by
[1:01:03] Your Word speaking to our needs oh God
[1:01:05] and we pray this morning that you may
[1:01:07] come just by our way Lord and speak to
[1:01:09] us as we look upon you and we wait upon
[1:01:12] you we ask those things in the name of
[1:01:14] Jesus Christ amen you may have your
[1:01:16] seats
[1:01:19] I want to say this and and just by way
[1:01:22] of introduction we said it last time and
[1:01:25] I think
[1:01:26] as we live our life in order for for us
[1:01:30] to get to where we we get uh we become a
[1:01:34] successful Christian or in order for us
[1:01:36] to even be called Christian we have to
[1:01:39] understand that we we cannot live by the
[1:01:42] old man we have to live by the new man
[1:01:44] we we have to come to a place where we
[1:01:47] understand that we were not made to just
[1:01:50] be the smaller people that walk around
[1:01:53] and eat and and drink and do all of
[1:01:55] those things we have to come to the
[1:01:57] understanding that we were made to live
[1:01:59] by the word of God the the we were made
[1:02:03] to live by the promises of God we were
[1:02:06] made as the scripture says men men
[1:02:08] cannot live by bread alone by by every
[1:02:11] word that comes out of the mouth of God
[1:02:13] we have to come to a place where you
[1:02:15] understand that your job is not what
[1:02:18] directs you your environment where you
[1:02:20] live is not what governs you whatever
[1:02:23] you do every day is not what governs you
[1:02:25] what governs you is the word of God if
[1:02:28] you understand that your life will be
[1:02:30] different but if you are always subject
[1:02:33] to what your boss is telling you or what
[1:02:35] your job is saying oh oh the the you
[1:02:37] know the we we are now in a time where
[1:02:40] there's a bunch of layoffs and there'll
[1:02:42] be companies they're dumping people left
[1:02:43] and right and all those things if you
[1:02:45] are affected by that then you're living
[1:02:47] by the old man but if you're living by
[1:02:50] the new man you will not be affected by
[1:02:52] that you know Satan always tries to draw
[1:02:55] a picture that this is what you are
[1:02:57] stuck with oh that it's your job that
[1:02:59] provides for your rent it's a job that
[1:03:01] provides for your food it's a job but a
[1:03:04] Believer comes to a place where you say
[1:03:05] I'm not living by the provision of the
[1:03:08] devil I'm living by the provisions of
[1:03:10] God that I have the job I have because
[1:03:13] God let me have that job and if that job
[1:03:16] goes away God will give me another job
[1:03:19] and that's how you become a successful
[1:03:21] Christian is to understand that you are
[1:03:24] not tied to the moral Kingdom you are
[1:03:26] are not tied to Satan's Eden you are not
[1:03:29] tied to the God of this evil age but you
[1:03:31] are tied into the Heavenly Kingdom but
[1:03:33] when I'm says we have untapped resources
[1:03:37] a Believer as we sit here it's important
[1:03:40] we realize what the doctor tells you is
[1:03:43] not the final say the prophet will say
[1:03:45] whatever challenge you face it's not the
[1:03:48] end of you what you have been given is
[1:03:50] untapped resources when I go to the
[1:03:53] doctor it's not because I have
[1:03:55] confidence confidence that the doctor
[1:03:57] has the ability to change my life but
[1:03:59] it's because I know that God has placed
[1:04:01] him there to help me and if he cannot
[1:04:04] help me I have the right to go to God
[1:04:09] it's not the end of me people are
[1:04:12] depressed and people live miserable life
[1:04:15] and they are stuck and and and and every
[1:04:17] time the economy goes down and people
[1:04:19] commit suicide and all kinds of things
[1:04:21] why because they are they have taken
[1:04:24] themselves and tied themselves to the
[1:04:25] economy of man they've taken themselves
[1:04:28] and tied themselves to the things that
[1:04:30] the man's doing but as a Believer we
[1:04:33] have to come with an understanding that
[1:04:34] I'm not tied to the world I'm tied to
[1:04:37] the word of God and as long as God
[1:04:39] leaves I shall live also
[1:04:43] so we are made to live by the untapped
[1:04:46] resources that God has made available in
[1:04:48] his word we were meant to live we remain
[1:04:51] to be the living image of the Living God
[1:04:54] on this planet that's the promise of the
[1:04:57] day the things that God promised he said
[1:04:59] that in the end time he will have a
[1:05:02] group of people and we've been our
[1:05:04] pastor has been fellowshipping on the
[1:05:05] message the God of this evil age will
[1:05:07] touch on that some of those things uh in
[1:05:10] a little bit here but here we are is a
[1:05:12] saying that we are meant to be the
[1:05:14] living image of the Living God in fact
[1:05:17] you have to understand that I'm here I'm
[1:05:19] here this morning because God has
[1:05:21] elected me to be part of his bride in
[1:05:24] the end time and not just that but it's
[1:05:27] because my my body my flesh my presence
[1:05:31] here is so that the Living God can dwell
[1:05:33] in me and touch other people
[1:05:36] oh yeah we are we are so bogged down
[1:05:39] with our own challenges oh I got to get
[1:05:41] this done and and I got to get this done
[1:05:43] and and you seem to never get to finish
[1:05:45] what you were supposed to do on that day
[1:05:47] and and that kind of mindset will never
[1:05:49] get you to the fullness of what God is
[1:05:52] wanting you to do but oh if you can
[1:05:54] understand that these challenges will
[1:05:56] come and they will pass away I'm not
[1:05:58] tied to uh how many things I have to do
[1:06:00] in a day and all of that but I'm tied to
[1:06:03] the promises of God and I'm waiting on
[1:06:06] the Promises of God I'm here waiting
[1:06:08] that God can come and use this flesh
[1:06:10] that through this man I can touch a sick
[1:06:13] body and God will heal it according to
[1:06:15] his promise that's the promises our time
[1:06:18] and if you come back with that kind of
[1:06:20] mentality that I'm living by the new man
[1:06:22] that's how you're going to overcome
[1:06:25] the the Bible will tell us that we we
[1:06:28] need to understand that this whole man
[1:06:30] is not made after God this old man is
[1:06:33] made after the after after the flesh is
[1:06:37] made is a result of unbelief as we said
[1:06:40] last time is a result of what happened
[1:06:42] in the Garden of Eden because they had
[1:06:45] unbelief in the word of God and the
[1:06:47] unbelief produce everything that we see
[1:06:51] the it and I want to say this this
[1:06:53] morning if unbelief is able to produce
[1:06:56] what we see I wonder what faith will do
[1:07:00] our part of reach last Wednesday he said
[1:07:02] will I find faith when I come back and I
[1:07:05] want to say this what would Faith do but
[1:07:07] when it makes a statement and I'll just
[1:07:09] say it so because I want to save time he
[1:07:11] said when God made his first creation he
[1:07:15] looked upon it with love with Grace and
[1:07:17] he looks at it and he looks at it they
[1:07:20] says this is good
[1:07:21] that was his first creation that he made
[1:07:24] after he created everything from day one
[1:07:26] the scripture says he rested he looked
[1:07:28] upon his Creation with the potential
[1:07:31] that is created it for it to be he says
[1:07:34] if he did that for the first creation
[1:07:36] would he do anything different with the
[1:07:39] second creation he will do the same
[1:07:41] thing
[1:07:42] so in other words God is not looking at
[1:07:44] you this morning finding out well when
[1:07:46] are you going to grow up and I'm waiting
[1:07:48] here what are you going to do he's
[1:07:49] looking upon you and seeing the amount
[1:07:51] of wasted potential that we go through
[1:07:54] because we're trying to figure out
[1:07:55] things with our own mind and he's
[1:07:57] looking and you're saying I didn't make
[1:07:59] you to be what you are doing I didn't
[1:08:01] make you to to to be in sin and to try
[1:08:04] to solve things by yourself I made you
[1:08:06] to be dependent on my word and when you
[1:08:09] live by my word you'll become an
[1:08:10] overcomer
[1:08:13] oh my so so that's why we said last time
[1:08:17] it's important to realize that we must
[1:08:19] be born again
[1:08:21] this new man it's not you waking up in
[1:08:25] the morning and say well you know I
[1:08:27] heard the word I went to church and now
[1:08:29] I'm deciding that I should stop lying I
[1:08:32] should stop stealing and I'll try my
[1:08:34] best and I'll do all that I can so I can
[1:08:36] sub that's wonderful but that's not it
[1:08:40] this new birth is you coming into the
[1:08:44] image of the heavenlies this this new
[1:08:47] man is you coming right back in the
[1:08:50] thoughts of God that it made you in the
[1:08:51] beginning coming back into the image of
[1:08:54] what was in God's mind in the beginning
[1:08:56] this new birth is the new creation
[1:08:59] that's created after Christ
[1:09:04] oh my and the prophet will say this in
[1:09:07] the speaking of the new New Birth it
[1:09:09] says the new birth is a paradox oh I
[1:09:13] like that the new birth is a paradox
[1:09:16] that's right it says that's right can
[1:09:21] change a man's being
[1:09:24] he says we could preach a sermon right
[1:09:26] here a little bit it says see how a
[1:09:31] paradox he says take a man that's a
[1:09:34] disbeliever
[1:09:35] an unbeliever has nothing to do with it
[1:09:39] all at once changed from a renegade to a
[1:09:43] Saints
[1:09:44] oh my take a renegade change him into a
[1:09:48] saint a prostitute to a sister it's a
[1:09:51] paradox no one can give him a medicine
[1:09:54] or a shot or a dose of medicine or
[1:09:57] anything else it takes the hands of
[1:10:01] almighty God that alone to change a man
[1:10:04] well that's a paradox when a man is born
[1:10:08] again that's right a paradox are new oh
[1:10:12] my and that's why we're talking about
[1:10:13] this morning I want the hands of
[1:10:16] almighty God this morning to come and to
[1:10:19] touch my life it's not something that I
[1:10:21] woke up and just had a new mind and all
[1:10:23] of that no the hands of almighty God the
[1:10:26] Creator will come into your life will
[1:10:29] take away the desires of the world will
[1:10:31] take away the things of the world and
[1:10:34] make you a new creature make you hunger
[1:10:36] after his righteousness
[1:10:40] and you cannot hunger after the
[1:10:42] righteousness of God by your own self
[1:10:45] there has to be the hands of God that
[1:10:47] touched you somewhere and that's what we
[1:10:50] desire this morning oftentimes we come
[1:10:52] back with our theology we don't
[1:10:54] understand that will not get you far and
[1:10:56] let me say this you can you can fashion
[1:10:59] the old man you can try to fix the old
[1:11:01] man but he only gets you a a certain
[1:11:04] distance but if you are fashioned after
[1:11:06] the new man you are made for eternity
[1:11:10] people will come and will hear the word
[1:11:12] of God but you need to be touched by the
[1:11:15] Living God your desires needs to be
[1:11:17] changed from what they were into
[1:11:19] something new because Ian is only he's
[1:11:22] the one that can do it and no one else
[1:11:26] the prophet was saying the message
[1:11:28] Paradox and he'll continue on it says
[1:11:30] that virgin birth was a mystery to the
[1:11:33] people they couldn't understand they
[1:11:36] couldn't understand it it's just like
[1:11:38] the new verse today the new birth is a
[1:11:41] mystery to the people it says they can't
[1:11:44] understand it they don't know what what
[1:11:47] what what you mean it says they have
[1:11:49] belittled it they bring it down and
[1:11:52] saying well it's just because you
[1:11:54] believe something the devil believes the
[1:11:56] same thing and trembles it isn't what
[1:11:59] you believe it's what God has actually
[1:12:02] done
[1:12:04] it's not all because I believe the
[1:12:07] message no it's God from Heaven his
[1:12:10] change is sent forth his Spirit you
[1:12:13] heard the word of God and the Spirit
[1:12:15] came and touched you and change you from
[1:12:17] what you were do something new and
[1:12:20] that's what we desire this morning
[1:12:22] because without that we are just
[1:12:24] reformers without that we are just
[1:12:26] people trying to educate you in a
[1:12:29] different way and let me say this the
[1:12:31] word of God calls for total separation
[1:12:34] and this is not a separation like I said
[1:12:36] you read the Bible and say well I need
[1:12:39] to stop doing this no the separation is
[1:12:41] when the word is spoken something within
[1:12:44] your heart is awakened and the things
[1:12:47] that you used to do to enjoy all of a
[1:12:49] sudden you don't enjoy them no more
[1:12:52] and that's when you know it's God that's
[1:12:54] working behind it the things that you
[1:12:57] use to be comfortable with all of a
[1:12:58] sudden you no longer comfortable what
[1:13:01] it's God the hands of God at work that's
[1:13:04] touching you the things that you used to
[1:13:07] do and you walk around and you drink and
[1:13:09] you went back and it was just fine all
[1:13:11] of a sudden they don't stick anymore all
[1:13:14] of a sudden the same frames don't sound
[1:13:16] good anymore all of a sudden the same
[1:13:18] food is not testing good anymore that's
[1:13:21] the hands almighty God touching you
[1:13:25] otherwise it's you trying to perfect
[1:13:28] yourself but what we desire is something
[1:13:31] to be changed inside of us where the
[1:13:34] things that I used to hunger I don't
[1:13:36] hunger for it anymore
[1:13:37] he will say in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:13:40] we feel it says their new birth is
[1:13:43] Christ
[1:13:44] the new birth is Christ is a revel is a
[1:13:48] revelation God has revealed to you this
[1:13:51] great mystery it says that's the new
[1:13:54] birth now what are you going it says it
[1:13:58] says now what are you going to do when
[1:14:01] you get all that group together where
[1:14:03] the Revelation is perfectly in harmony
[1:14:06] my brother my sister what we need to do
[1:14:09] this morning is not to come and try to
[1:14:11] argue about facts and or he said this
[1:14:14] here oh you don't believe this I see
[1:14:16] this this way no what we need is the
[1:14:18] harmony of the Living God understand
[1:14:21] this program or you you may have your
[1:14:24] Revelation here that's different from
[1:14:25] mine let's put our differences on the
[1:14:28] side let's come together with what we
[1:14:30] believe and let's see God moving on it
[1:14:34] God moves in unity God moves in the
[1:14:37] people that's United together God wants
[1:14:39] to do wonders and signs and things among
[1:14:42] us why they can't do it if we are
[1:14:44] divided if this one comes and pulled
[1:14:46] that way that one pulls that way but
[1:14:48] he's saying if you can take those people
[1:14:50] that have received that Revelation and
[1:14:53] they come together and they live
[1:14:54] together and see what God is going to do
[1:14:57] in the midst
[1:14:58] it says and God expressing his thought
[1:15:02] through the word by the same actions the
[1:15:07] same thing it did the same thing that he
[1:15:09] did making the word manifest he says oh
[1:15:12] if the church only knew its position
[1:15:16] think about that it says one day then
[1:15:20] the Rapture will go when he knows what
[1:15:23] it is now he's not talking about us
[1:15:26] coming and and and and just pulling
[1:15:29] aside he's saying if we can come and
[1:15:31] understand the unity that we have been
[1:15:33] brought here by God's word we have been
[1:15:36] brought here every single one of us
[1:15:38] that's born again of the spirit of God
[1:15:40] we are gathered here because of his
[1:15:42] doing when we come with our unity and we
[1:15:45] look forward to him he will come and do
[1:15:47] according to his promise
[1:15:50] we read this about the new creation last
[1:15:52] time he says the new creation is not the
[1:15:57] old made over
[1:16:01] it's not the making over
[1:16:03] it's not you coming and saying well I
[1:16:06] don't like really my flesh I don't like
[1:16:08] what I am I need to be I need to make
[1:16:10] some changes so I can get it into
[1:16:12] something I like no
[1:16:14] it says or it could not be called the
[1:16:17] new creation this is exactly what he
[1:16:20] says the new creation another it says it
[1:16:24] is another creation distinct from the
[1:16:27] old one no longer is he dealing by the
[1:16:30] way of the flesh this is not God trying
[1:16:34] to stimulate your flesh God's trying to
[1:16:36] get you to shelter to scream and to say
[1:16:38] well because I or give you some fleshly
[1:16:41] identification to say because I did
[1:16:44] those things therefore I'm saved no he's
[1:16:47] saying that this is the new creation
[1:16:49] something that's starting inside of your
[1:16:51] heart something that's built after God
[1:16:54] something that's built after the image
[1:16:56] of God coming into manifestation in the
[1:16:59] old flesh
[1:17:02] it says
[1:17:04] it says
[1:17:05] that he says that's how he dealt with
[1:17:08] Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham
[1:17:11] Abraham and and Abraham and of Abraham's
[1:17:15] issued Through The Godly Isaac
[1:17:18] Isaac line but now out of every Kindred
[1:17:21] every nation and and every nation he has
[1:17:25] purposed a new creation he is the first
[1:17:28] of that creation he was God created in
[1:17:34] the form of Man by his Spirit he is
[1:17:37] creating many sons unto himself
[1:17:42] you you know it's it's really
[1:17:46] something that as Believers we really
[1:17:48] need to dwell on it because it's
[1:17:51] important you realize yeah we are but
[1:17:54] when I will say certain kingdoms is
[1:17:56] bringing forth is diseases it's bringing
[1:18:00] forth the the the all kinds of stuff and
[1:18:03] he's throwing it upon the Mankind and
[1:18:05] and everything and it's doing so and
[1:18:08] then at the same time the God of this
[1:18:10] evil age is saying I want you to live by
[1:18:13] my provision if you are sick I have a
[1:18:16] doctor if you're hungry I have food for
[1:18:18] you hybrid food for you to eat he's he's
[1:18:21] telling you you actually don't need
[1:18:23] Faith to live by I want you to come and
[1:18:26] live by my provision
[1:18:30] he is constantly pointing you to himself
[1:18:33] he creates the problem but then he comes
[1:18:36] with the solution
[1:18:37] he's looking at you and saying come I'll
[1:18:40] I'll give you you depressed come I'll
[1:18:42] I'll take the depression away but I'll
[1:18:44] give you something else I'll come and
[1:18:45] and come and and all of this and
[1:18:48] whatever we'll say technology and
[1:18:50] civilization and education and through
[1:18:53] those means he's actually making all of
[1:18:55] those things so he can call you by
[1:18:57] himself so you can come to him but the
[1:19:00] word of God is here to let you know that
[1:19:03] God's Army is here and is moving by the
[1:19:06] power of God to defeat him in those
[1:19:08] things
[1:19:10] and the question this morning is to for
[1:19:13] you for each one to ask ourselves by
[1:19:15] what provision am I living by am I
[1:19:18] living by the provisions of God or am I
[1:19:21] living by the provisions of the devil
[1:19:26] the scripture will say in whom we have
[1:19:29] also obtained an inheritance bring
[1:19:32] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:19:35] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:19:38] Council of his own will he says it says
[1:19:42] in Colossians 1 and 18 it says and he is
[1:19:45] the head of the body the church who is
[1:19:49] the beginning of the the beginning the
[1:19:52] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:19:55] things he might have preeminence in
[1:19:58] second Corinthians 5 and 17 it says
[1:20:00] therefore in any If any man be in Christ
[1:20:04] he's a new creation all things are
[1:20:07] passed away and behold all things are
[1:20:09] new
[1:20:10] behold all things are become new now
[1:20:14] yeah
[1:20:15] talking about the new man and the
[1:20:17] prophet will speak and he will say uh he
[1:20:20] will say this he will tell us in uh he
[1:20:23] will speak and say it's important we
[1:20:26] come to the place where we examine
[1:20:28] ourselves
[1:20:30] to really come to a place where we see
[1:20:34] how is that new man how am I being
[1:20:36] affected by the new man or how is how am
[1:20:40] I bringing the new man out on display in
[1:20:44] my life
[1:20:45] to come
[1:20:48] I just spoke about the the uh Satan said
[1:20:52] and the God of this evil age remember
[1:20:55] the prophet was say he had six thousand
[1:20:59] years to build this Kingdom
[1:21:01] he's Eden
[1:21:03] and he has study men for 600 years
[1:21:08] and trust me you cannot defeat him by
[1:21:11] your flesh
[1:21:12] he knows the pinpoints the pain points
[1:21:15] and he knows exactly where to press and
[1:21:18] when to press he knows how to
[1:21:21] continually apply pressure so you can
[1:21:24] break in your flesh
[1:21:28] he said 6 000 years to build this and
[1:21:32] and the prophet will tell us how that he
[1:21:35] is here and and he's he offered Jesus
[1:21:39] he says I will give you this Kingdom if
[1:21:42] you worship me
[1:21:44] I will give you all of this that you see
[1:21:47] if you fall down and worship me and the
[1:21:49] the the scripture didn't say Jesus
[1:21:51] looked at him and said he doesn't belong
[1:21:53] to you he was actually the god of it
[1:21:58] the god of that the god of fashion the
[1:22:01] god of everything the god of
[1:22:03] entertainment the God of all those
[1:22:06] things the god of the things that we
[1:22:07] need to relax the god of things that we
[1:22:10] need to feel good the god of things that
[1:22:13] we need to to get away and and to to to
[1:22:17] help ourselves he's the God of all of
[1:22:19] that
[1:22:20] and so I want to say this the scripture
[1:22:22] will say in Revelation 13 and then they
[1:22:25] said and all that dwelled upon the Earth
[1:22:27] shall worship Him whose names are not
[1:22:30] written in the book of in the in the
[1:22:32] book of the lamb in the in the book of
[1:22:36] the of life of the lamb slain before the
[1:22:38] foundation of the world and I want to
[1:22:40] say this this morning Satan is fine
[1:22:43] if all we come this morning is
[1:22:46] I want to come to church
[1:22:49] if we come and you say well I just want
[1:22:52] to be a member in the church Satan is
[1:22:54] fine with it yes
[1:22:56] you say well I I just want to help my
[1:23:00] neighbor sit and he's okay with it
[1:23:02] because remember the deception at the
[1:23:05] end time it's not that Satan is coming
[1:23:08] is presented with himself as one with
[1:23:11] horns and everything but he's as a
[1:23:13] prophet will say he shows himself as the
[1:23:16] angel of Light
[1:23:18] one who's actually there to illuminate
[1:23:21] you to help you to show you the way
[1:23:23] light is what shows the way he shows he
[1:23:26] comes as one who's trying to help one
[1:23:29] who's trying to lead you and and and and
[1:23:31] the prophet will tell us that he will
[1:23:34] come and and and come the same way
[1:23:36] because the bride at the end time has to
[1:23:39] be placed at the same place that Eve was
[1:23:41] in the beginning
[1:23:43] so in other word what he did at the
[1:23:45] beginning was he changed one word
[1:23:48] he injected one word
[1:23:51] surely
[1:23:53] that God surely said that
[1:23:55] God surely so it's a twisting of the
[1:23:59] word of God taking one thing and just
[1:24:02] changing it little by little or changing
[1:24:04] just something small because we know
[1:24:06] that God cannot mix his gospel the word
[1:24:09] of God cannot mix with anything it will
[1:24:11] produce death let me say this if it's
[1:24:14] 99.9 the word and
[1:24:18] 0.0.0.1 something else it will produce
[1:24:21] death
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:24] the word of God is not to be mixed with
[1:24:26] anything but the God of this evil age
[1:24:29] will come and it will inject something
[1:24:32] in it it will inject something just as
[1:24:35] small
[1:24:37] and by you thinking you're worshiping
[1:24:40] God you automatically think you're
[1:24:42] worshiping the devil
[1:24:44] now he doesn't have a problem
[1:24:46] you thinking you're worshiping God while
[1:24:49] you're worshiping him so he's okay
[1:24:51] receiving worship that's not even coming
[1:24:53] on the name he is receiving all of as
[1:24:57] long as it's done in the wrong way he
[1:24:59] will take it but the god that the god
[1:25:02] that we worship is the god of Purity
[1:25:05] he wants us to approach him with Purity
[1:25:08] oh my there's so much I could say this
[1:25:10] morning that that's why it's important
[1:25:13] the scripture says that we keep our
[1:25:15] bodies we understand what we were made
[1:25:17] for because it's important you realize
[1:25:19] that every word of God matters to God
[1:25:25] our Pastor said it last time the the the
[1:25:28] the Evangelical and the denomination
[1:25:31] they constantly have to modify the
[1:25:34] gospel so he can fit the need of the
[1:25:36] people of the hour
[1:25:39] in other words so if if it's good to
[1:25:42] wear pants well let's just move that
[1:25:44] we'll just keep on you know saying other
[1:25:47] things and will not add that anymore
[1:25:49] because well it's common you know
[1:25:51] everybody all the women are wearing
[1:25:53] pants so what are we going to do we
[1:25:54] can't talk about it anymore they take it
[1:25:56] out if it's not high heels it's a
[1:26:00] problem oh well you know it's now the
[1:26:03] modern gospel so as people are shifting
[1:26:05] away it's following them where they're
[1:26:08] going but that's not the end time
[1:26:11] message that's not the gospel that we
[1:26:13] have received the gospel that we receive
[1:26:16] is Purity in the word of God it what God
[1:26:19] Said in the beginning is to hold truth
[1:26:21] today
[1:26:23] why because it's not made by the
[1:26:26] elements of man it's not made to be
[1:26:29] sustained by its by man the word of God
[1:26:31] in itself is the life of God coming into
[1:26:34] manifestation it's made to feed the new
[1:26:37] man that's in you
[1:26:41] so Satan were coming
[1:26:44] he won't mind if this morning we come to
[1:26:47] church and say well
[1:26:49] I just want people to know that I was at
[1:26:52] church in the morning you know I just
[1:26:54] want to check the box and said I went to
[1:26:57] church it's fine
[1:27:00] it's not okay he doesn't have a problem
[1:27:02] if you just go with the flow you know
[1:27:04] and this presentation is always you know
[1:27:07] one day God will change me one day you
[1:27:10] know it's going to come I know I'm
[1:27:12] patiently waiting and it seems like
[1:27:14] whatever you're looking for is always
[1:27:17] trying to reach it you know just trying
[1:27:18] to go oh you know years goes by you know
[1:27:21] I'm waiting patiently Abraham waited
[1:27:23] that's not the gospel we have received
[1:27:26] what about him says that we are sitting
[1:27:28] in Heavenly places now there is not a
[1:27:31] promise to say it's going to come
[1:27:33] Rapture is now the change your body is
[1:27:37] now everything in the word of God is now
[1:27:40] the change of body starts with a new man
[1:27:43] once you've received the new man you
[1:27:45] already started your transformation
[1:27:47] remember he said that the new body will
[1:27:50] be around that person that's been built
[1:27:53] inside of you so when you don't have the
[1:27:55] new man you can't have the new body
[1:27:59] the things that God did is already
[1:28:01] finished everything about God is a
[1:28:04] finished word the moment he speaks it is
[1:28:07] a complete word so the children of God
[1:28:09] are only called to walk into those
[1:28:11] promises that he already made
[1:28:15] God wants us and let me say this Satan
[1:28:18] wants to weaken our resolve this morning
[1:28:19] he wants us to come and just be a church
[1:28:22] member and all kinds of things but the
[1:28:24] children of God are those that are
[1:28:26] burning with a heart's desire to see the
[1:28:29] Promise happen any moment any time and
[1:28:32] whatever they asking they want to see it
[1:28:34] right ten God I need this I'm not moving
[1:28:37] until it change I'm not going anywhere
[1:28:39] until it changes why because it's been
[1:28:42] revealed to them that it's today
[1:28:48] so I want to ask you this morning
[1:28:51] if you live by the new man
[1:28:54] how do you spend your time
[1:28:59] can you allocate your own time and ask
[1:29:02] your time how much is allocated to the
[1:29:04] new and how much is allocated to the old
[1:29:06] man
[1:29:09] how much are you feeding the new man
[1:29:11] because the new man is the one who's
[1:29:14] supposed to come and and by that you get
[1:29:16] the power to overcome the old man but
[1:29:19] how much heed how much time how much
[1:29:22] effort how much are we putting into you
[1:29:24] only get what you reap remember
[1:29:27] you you get what you expect isn't that
[1:29:29] the scripture if you come expecting
[1:29:31] nothing you get nothing if you come
[1:29:33] expecting for God to move God will move
[1:29:35] for you if you come whatever you ask is
[1:29:38] what's going to be given to you
[1:29:41] so we need to understand
[1:29:43] with the word that we have received
[1:29:46] there has to be a people that come into
[1:29:49] an understanding that I have been recent
[1:29:52] given on top resources from Heaven I
[1:29:55] have been given access as a scripture
[1:29:58] will say an ancient shall be ministered
[1:30:00] unto you into the Everlasting Kingdom we
[1:30:03] have seen that entrance open and there
[1:30:05] has to be a people on the face of the
[1:30:07] Earth that are walking into that
[1:30:09] entrance and pulling down the promises
[1:30:11] of God
[1:30:13] not satisfied with the status quo well
[1:30:16] you know I'm just a Christian I'll do
[1:30:18] the best I can but a person who's living
[1:30:20] under the expectation under desperation
[1:30:23] to see God move at any time you can't
[1:30:26] hear about somebody being sick and just
[1:30:27] sit there and say well I send my prayer
[1:30:30] and God will heal no they had your heart
[1:30:32] has to beat a little faster you have to
[1:30:34] sit there I'm not getting off of my
[1:30:36] knees I'm not stopping this is not going
[1:30:39] to get off my mind until I see God move
[1:30:43] that's living after the new man
[1:30:46] and David will say this but as for me I
[1:30:51] will come into the house in the
[1:30:53] multitude of thy mercy and then in the
[1:30:56] fear it says and in thy fear I will
[1:30:59] worship towards the Holy Mountain or the
[1:31:01] Holy Temple and say again in Psalm 17
[1:31:04] and 15 he says as for me I will Behold
[1:31:07] thy face in righteousness I will be
[1:31:10] satisfied when I awake in my likeness
[1:31:16] I my satisfaction
[1:31:19] is when I see the image of the new man
[1:31:23] the image of God the Living God the
[1:31:26] living image of the Living God when I
[1:31:29] see the new man come in the image of
[1:31:31] what he made it to be that's when my
[1:31:33] satisfaction my satisfaction is not how
[1:31:36] much money I make my satisfaction is not
[1:31:39] what kind of car I drive my satisfaction
[1:31:41] is not what food I eat what clothes I
[1:31:43] dress my satisfaction is the new man
[1:31:45] coming into the image of the one that
[1:31:48] I'm beholding
[1:31:50] he says in Psalm 26 and 11 but as for me
[1:31:54] I will walk in thy integrity
[1:31:58] I will walk in my Integrity redeem me
[1:32:01] and be merciful unto me he'll say in
[1:32:04] Psalm 55 and 16 as for me I will call
[1:32:08] upon God and the Lord shall save me
[1:32:14] I want to say this perhaps this sounds
[1:32:16] foolish to you but it's okay you know
[1:32:19] they they spend a month we had a problem
[1:32:21] at working we've been trying to solve it
[1:32:23] for over 30 days and it seems like and
[1:32:26] it will happen for a section or 30
[1:32:28] minutes every time you you know you get
[1:32:30] away and you get away it happened and so
[1:32:33] randomly will track the time but every
[1:32:35] time the child will change and so we
[1:32:37] just don't know what's going on and and
[1:32:39] so it the whole team is tired because we
[1:32:42] just can't get enough sleep and
[1:32:44] everybody is up all the time 2 A.M 3 A.M
[1:32:46] and things like that so I remember this
[1:32:49] about this is about 14 or 15 days ago
[1:32:52] and all of a sudden I'm just standing
[1:32:55] there they woke me up and I was so tired
[1:32:57] I finally I went to my computer and I
[1:33:00] just I just in my heart something just
[1:33:02] say God please help me find out what is
[1:33:04] going on
[1:33:05] and all of a sudden it happened again we
[1:33:08] got in the system and we were able to
[1:33:10] find what it was and we stopped it and
[1:33:12] we were able to run for a little bit
[1:33:13] with no issue I'm telling you you have
[1:33:16] to call upon the new man you say you
[1:33:20] pray over a computer Absolutely I'll
[1:33:22] pray because I understand my I'm not
[1:33:25] made to function by this flesh this man
[1:33:28] can only take me in a certain you pray
[1:33:30] over a computer and machine yes I it's
[1:33:33] made by the devil but I know God has the
[1:33:36] power to change it
[1:33:38] I think sometimes we keep this mind so
[1:33:42] much we need to lose our mind we need to
[1:33:45] renew our mind we need to understand we
[1:33:47] are supernatural beings that are made to
[1:33:50] live by the provisions of God that are
[1:33:52] made to live by the word of God let me
[1:33:55] say this the word of God will change any
[1:33:57] situation any place any time I don't
[1:34:01] care if you are in Hell God will change
[1:34:03] it I don't care if you and the devil big
[1:34:06] God can change it foreign
[1:34:14] natural Problems by the natural mind
[1:34:18] trying the best you can
[1:34:21] forgetting that there's a new man and
[1:34:24] they're standing by and just waiting to
[1:34:26] hear for you to call
[1:34:27] wait wait let me say this this morning I
[1:34:30] I want us to be successful Christian I
[1:34:33] want our young people to succeed in
[1:34:35] being a Christian I don't want we it's
[1:34:37] not even our pastor will say this it's
[1:34:40] painful to see our young people every
[1:34:43] time they come to the altar and then
[1:34:45] next time you see them the same people
[1:34:47] over and over there's got to come a time
[1:34:50] where you want a new man to function in
[1:34:52] them you want to see them succeed you
[1:34:55] you cannot sit there and watch them time
[1:34:58] and time again and your heart not be
[1:35:00] broken
[1:35:02] when you see somebody come over and over
[1:35:04] there has to be something rise up within
[1:35:07] you and say God I don't know what this
[1:35:09] says but I want you to come and do
[1:35:11] something for this person
[1:35:16] to just see somebody come and go and say
[1:35:19] well you know we had this many come to
[1:35:21] the altar that's not the gospel the
[1:35:23] gospel is the good news is to take that
[1:35:26] person and change them and make them
[1:35:28] someone who can operate in the kingdom
[1:35:30] of God
[1:35:33] so the Devil by deception he will come
[1:35:36] and he will he he remember it's not by
[1:35:40] changing the whole word of God it's by
[1:35:42] changing one thing and causing you to be
[1:35:45] stuck in a loop in a cycle where you
[1:35:48] never get the answer that you're looking
[1:35:49] for you never get anywhere you never get
[1:35:52] the patience or the love or the ability
[1:35:54] to understand how God is functioning
[1:35:56] he's okay with you being stuck that way
[1:36:03] oh my
[1:36:05] the prophet will say this
[1:36:08] and I thought this was so important
[1:36:10] now listen to this
[1:36:13] this is
[1:36:15] he's taking now speaking about the
[1:36:19] seriousness of life and how the Satan is
[1:36:21] a Deceiver
[1:36:22] is taking it and I want you to see the
[1:36:25] application of what he's talking about
[1:36:28] it said some guy
[1:36:29] got after me the other day and say
[1:36:32] why don't you leave them people alone
[1:36:34] always hammering at them the way by the
[1:36:38] about the way that they're dressed and
[1:36:40] the things they do it says if you are a
[1:36:42] prophet and say and they think you are a
[1:36:45] prophet I say I know he says but I says
[1:36:48] it says well they believe you to be then
[1:36:52] why don't you teach them how to see
[1:36:54] visions and walk before God
[1:36:57] and I said if they don't know ABC
[1:37:01] it says how am I going to teach them
[1:37:04] algebra
[1:37:06] if they don't know the kindergarten then
[1:37:09] it says don't know how to behave
[1:37:12] themselves don't know how to look and
[1:37:15] act and dress and and be decent how are
[1:37:18] you going to teach them prophetic things
[1:37:20] now I want you to to take that statement
[1:37:23] and take it in in regards to what the
[1:37:26] prophet is telling us about the kingdom
[1:37:28] the Satan's Eden
[1:37:30] if we can't because remember to overcome
[1:37:32] you have to see the devil and every
[1:37:34] single one of his tricks so if you can
[1:37:36] identify the trick of the enemy
[1:37:41] this is not just simply to say well you
[1:37:45] know he's talking about closing about
[1:37:46] it's about your ability to discern what
[1:37:50] Satan is bringing at you and he's saying
[1:37:53] that the basic keep it says that your
[1:37:56] body you may understand what your flesh
[1:37:58] it says that you give your body a Living
[1:38:01] Sacrifice that you may understand that
[1:38:03] you've been redeemed and you've been
[1:38:05] brought and the body right now for one
[1:38:08] that's one again it's made so God can
[1:38:10] come and dwell in it now we're saying
[1:38:13] that if that's the case why is it that
[1:38:16] you're failing to understand this little
[1:38:18] things that the devil is tricking you
[1:38:20] with
[1:38:25] now you remember you cannot become a
[1:38:28] giant Christian unless you come through
[1:38:31] the process you you cannot overcome big
[1:38:34] things unless you can overcome small
[1:38:36] things you cannot overcome big
[1:38:38] challenges unless you can understand
[1:38:40] what the small challenges is and yet we
[1:38:42] are but the prophet will tell us about
[1:38:44] the way we dress the way we conduct
[1:38:46] ourselves and all those things and we
[1:38:48] constantly uh hopping over it and
[1:38:52] looking for the Mysteries all the Seven
[1:38:55] Seals oh God manifested oh God the the
[1:39:00] the the the the evening light and all
[1:39:02] those things the evening light has come
[1:39:04] so it can take your body and make it
[1:39:07] obey the basic things
[1:39:15] but but and you will say this here
[1:39:18] it says Jesus says if they don't believe
[1:39:21] there's things here if they don't
[1:39:23] believe the Earthly things how are they
[1:39:25] going to believe if I tell them Heavenly
[1:39:27] things he says the things that you can
[1:39:29] do yourself stop doing these things it
[1:39:33] can't even do that how are you going to
[1:39:36] find spiritual things people are you
[1:39:39] going to find spiritual things people
[1:39:41] isn't that right yes sir now he will
[1:39:44] also uh say one one place if I could
[1:39:47] Skip and just get to it he will say one
[1:39:49] place
[1:39:51] uh you would talk one place and he will
[1:39:54] say uh the the and the reason for that
[1:39:57] he said it's because God don't want a
[1:40:00] Christian to look like the world
[1:40:08] there cannot be a confusion
[1:40:11] when the new man is in
[1:40:14] right there cannot be a place where
[1:40:17] there's confusion where you don't know
[1:40:20] if it's the new man or the old man
[1:40:24] that when the new man comes in he takes
[1:40:27] over
[1:40:27] when the new man comes in the first time
[1:40:30] sign is he changes the heart's desire so
[1:40:34] therefore whatever the flesh puts forth
[1:40:36] that's not of God the new men will tell
[1:40:39] him you know this is not it
[1:40:44] say this thing you know oftentimes
[1:40:47] people want to hear over the pulpit oh
[1:40:49] you know you don't don't dress this way
[1:40:52] or or you'll eat your heels I got to be
[1:40:54] this no you're looking for a man-made
[1:40:57] leadership
[1:40:58] that's not what God is offering you're
[1:41:01] looking for someone to be there to
[1:41:03] measure your skirt or your your heels or
[1:41:06] someone to measure how you talk or
[1:41:08] somehow that's not the leadership of God
[1:41:11] and not leadership will not produce
[1:41:13] anything that leadership when that
[1:41:15] leader is gone you'll go right back into
[1:41:17] the things you used to be that
[1:41:19] leadership will give gap for you to get
[1:41:21] away with a lot of things why because if
[1:41:24] he didn't say it you could get away with
[1:41:26] it but the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:28] Hallelujah there's a leadership by the
[1:41:31] Holy Ghost he'll take care of everything
[1:41:33] that the word is saying why because he's
[1:41:36] there he knows your heart he knows
[1:41:38] everything about you and even if it's
[1:41:40] okay with somebody else that leadership
[1:41:42] will tell you it's not okay with you
[1:41:48] that's the new man
[1:41:50] that leadership will say they doing it
[1:41:53] that's okay but that's not okay for you
[1:41:55] you this is how I want you that
[1:41:57] leadership will bring you as an
[1:42:00] individual who's built after God himself
[1:42:03] it's not going to be a copy of something
[1:42:05] else it's going to be an original
[1:42:11] that's what the Holy Ghost is for to
[1:42:14] remind you of the things that God has
[1:42:16] said let's not substitute the holy
[1:42:19] spirit with somebody or say well because
[1:42:21] the pastor didn't say it that means I
[1:42:24] can do it no if you sit down for some of
[1:42:26] you you can sit down and play games and
[1:42:29] all of that thing and you can say well I
[1:42:30] can play 30 minutes but others you can't
[1:42:33] even touch it why because it's the
[1:42:35] leadership of Holy Ghost
[1:42:39] man
[1:42:40] I've been around games they mean nothing
[1:42:43] to me why because it's the leadership
[1:42:45] that's in me other people can play for a
[1:42:48] little bit and be fine but the moment I
[1:42:50] just see it I can't touch it there's
[1:42:52] just nothing that wants it
[1:42:54] why that's how God wants us to be he now
[1:42:57] remember he says in this message message
[1:42:59] he's calling a people he's not calling a
[1:43:03] church he's calling individuals when he
[1:43:06] was rejected in the end time God called
[1:43:09] individuals
[1:43:16] he will say
[1:43:18] well God really didn't say that
[1:43:22] that's really you taking in way too far
[1:43:25] you just a hardliner
[1:43:28] you just don't want people to have fun
[1:43:32] have fun all you want
[1:43:35] as long as you know what's leading you
[1:43:38] but one of them said and I don't have
[1:43:40] time to just go through all of it
[1:43:42] he says
[1:43:44] it's the spirit that's leading them
[1:43:51] it's a go listen to it God of this evil
[1:43:53] age
[1:43:54] it's a spirit remember on the top of it
[1:43:57] when it comes it says from the beginning
[1:43:58] it comes and says now as God really lost
[1:44:02] control he said he says I believe in my
[1:44:04] opinion there's only two Powers there's
[1:44:06] a power of God it says the spirit of God
[1:44:08] is here calling forth is a light but it
[1:44:10] says the spirit of the devil is just so
[1:44:12] calling in unrighteousness it says
[1:44:14] there's only two so we are only
[1:44:16] influenced by those so there's a spirit
[1:44:18] that's leading you to do those things
[1:44:21] and not and let me say this don't ever
[1:44:24] think that your flesh can get too strong
[1:44:26] that it cannot be influenced by this
[1:44:28] spirit
[1:44:29] that's why you need the new man to
[1:44:31] always be there to OverWatch you need a
[1:44:33] new man to always be on the watch you
[1:44:35] need the new men to say what you just
[1:44:38] did is not it you stop doing this you go
[1:44:41] do that what you did this you cannot be
[1:44:44] done again this is the last time you
[1:44:47] need someone to overcome this body you
[1:44:49] need somebody to have the mean you know
[1:44:51] let me say this the devil wants to have
[1:44:53] dominion over you he wants to govern you
[1:44:56] that remember the mission from heaven or
[1:44:59] from the beginning was he wanted to be
[1:45:02] all for the stars of God that's always
[1:45:04] what he's wanted that's always what he's
[1:45:06] after but the spirit of God is here
[1:45:08] saying I'm not going to fall under the
[1:45:11] leadership of the devil they say not a
[1:45:13] leadership in me that's guiding me to
[1:45:16] the word
[1:45:20] right
[1:45:21] as God really said that
[1:45:24] yes he did
[1:45:26] is that really what it he comes and he
[1:45:28] will offer meaning and explanation how
[1:45:31] did we end up with all this denomination
[1:45:35] men explaining what God wanted to say
[1:45:39] but the prophet tells us
[1:45:41] God is his only interpreter
[1:45:46] don't let somebody explain to you what
[1:45:48] the Holy Ghost says
[1:45:50] go to God
[1:45:52] this holy ghost that you talk about
[1:45:54] this holy ghost that other people scream
[1:45:57] and shout then they come back and they
[1:45:58] do the same thing what is it I want some
[1:46:00] of that
[1:46:02] I want a taste of it myself so I can
[1:46:04] become a witness I want to stand and say
[1:46:06] that all of a sudden something changed
[1:46:09] in my heart I want to stand and be able
[1:46:12] to say that they know that it's the
[1:46:13] truth
[1:46:15] and God will give it to you but we're
[1:46:18] not come to be governed to where this
[1:46:21] message is so wonderful because it's
[1:46:23] important you realize this is the
[1:46:25] opening of the word and God is invited
[1:46:28] each one of us no one is subject to a
[1:46:31] preacher everybody is subject to one
[1:46:34] person and that's the prophet and the
[1:46:36] prophet is a Divine interpreter of the
[1:46:38] word of God is a one by the word of God
[1:46:41] comes to so if he says it you can stay
[1:46:44] with it and God will bring you the past
[1:46:46] a preacher here can explain why that
[1:46:49] don't mean that oh don't worry about the
[1:46:51] preacher or if the prophet said it I'm
[1:46:53] staying with it
[1:46:54] that's why when we play these steps is
[1:46:57] to get you in the mind to know what the
[1:46:59] messenger himself said if he say that
[1:47:02] the new birth is Christ coming in you I
[1:47:05] want to see Christ in me
[1:47:07] I don't want somebody to tell me some
[1:47:09] explanation well you know he looks like
[1:47:11] you're now doing good so that means you
[1:47:13] got it no God I want a true witness I
[1:47:17] want what you say to be my life
[1:47:20] say again
[1:47:24] it will say Satan is calling his bride
[1:47:27] by misinterpreting the word of God by
[1:47:30] air
[1:47:31] so first he's trying to to to to
[1:47:34] uh he will take the word of God and
[1:47:36] trying to misinterpret it and now he's
[1:47:39] calling it by air and and I'll say this
[1:47:41] but what I'm says the air
[1:47:45] starts right here
[1:47:47] and it's it might be this small
[1:47:49] it may be not even at that visible
[1:47:53] it might be so small that you won't even
[1:47:55] be able to see it but as you advance you
[1:47:58] begin to look at the result you will see
[1:48:01] that it's a distance apart
[1:48:03] how come if God said this how did I end
[1:48:06] up with something different
[1:48:11] if God said to do this how did we end up
[1:48:14] with something that's not it it's
[1:48:15] because there was an error introduced in
[1:48:18] what we were hearing there was an error
[1:48:20] introducing what was spoken why because
[1:48:22] if you hear it from God God is obligated
[1:48:25] to come and bring it to pass it says
[1:48:28] it's also by presenting you within his
[1:48:31] kingdom
[1:48:32] things that you can live by
[1:48:36] he's got his fashion
[1:48:39] we dress up his clothes at every day
[1:48:42] and if you're not careful you start
[1:48:44] looking for name brand you know um
[1:48:46] kyphen Klein you know I am Yves Saint
[1:48:50] Laurent you know I'm Gucci man I'm
[1:48:54] whatever you know what I mean that
[1:48:56] becomes yo you you create an identity
[1:48:59] you know when people see me they have to
[1:49:01] see Gucci you know what I mean and all
[1:49:03] those things
[1:49:07] we are meant to be worshipers
[1:49:10] we are made to be worshipers now think
[1:49:13] about this this worship is not a
[1:49:15] knowingly worship
[1:49:18] it's not a a purposeful mind worship
[1:49:23] it's a worship that's done by error in
[1:49:26] other words a person still thinks within
[1:49:28] the heart they putting their effort in
[1:49:31] it thinking the worshiping but God but
[1:49:34] they're worshiping the devil
[1:49:37] he says by his technology
[1:49:40] my
[1:49:42] I mean I don't even know where to start
[1:49:45] everything is technology nowadays you
[1:49:49] know now they they came up with uh I
[1:49:51] don't know you know I don't even know
[1:49:53] what I should say chat GPD whatever you
[1:49:56] know you just pause the question it
[1:49:58] gives you all the answers you don't even
[1:50:00] need to think even the things if you
[1:50:03] just think oh I don't know if that's the
[1:50:04] answer hey what is this boom references
[1:50:08] everything
[1:50:09] this means this it used to be you go you
[1:50:12] go on Google you search Google will tell
[1:50:14] you but Google will give you many
[1:50:15] answers so you have to pick which one is
[1:50:18] right but this one it gives you the
[1:50:20] right answer
[1:50:21] supposedly
[1:50:29] we are dying in the flesh
[1:50:33] all of this is only producing death
[1:50:37] death little by little
[1:50:39] but oh my I'm here to say this morning
[1:50:42] and I don't want to go too long there's
[1:50:44] another expression that God is trying to
[1:50:46] bring forth there's a bride who's here
[1:50:49] to express the thoughts of God that were
[1:50:51] in the beginning will say this
[1:50:54] will say this they will say he'll say
[1:50:57] he'll say so the outside the end time
[1:51:01] message is here to bring the expression
[1:51:04] of the new creation is here to bring
[1:51:06] forth what was in God's mind in the
[1:51:08] beginning same things that are to be
[1:51:10] brahmanam says now he says now the only
[1:51:13] way that we can be a son or a daughter
[1:51:15] of God because you have to be you have
[1:51:18] to have you have to have eternal life so
[1:51:21] I I like when the prophet does this
[1:51:22] because it's an understanding that what
[1:51:25] was in the beginning is what's going to
[1:51:27] be at the end he's wanting to to make
[1:51:30] sure that you are not introducing
[1:51:32] another element in between that will
[1:51:34] confuse the equation so he's saying if
[1:51:37] God is eternal if God was in the
[1:51:40] beginning if you are a son of God there
[1:51:42] is no way that you had some other
[1:51:44] beginning because if anything that has a
[1:51:47] beginning will have an end but he's
[1:51:49] wanting you to know that even though you
[1:51:51] are born in this flesh you came in this
[1:51:53] world you came in this room I am your
[1:51:55] origin always has to be traced to
[1:51:58] something Eternal because when you came
[1:52:01] here in this flesh even though you
[1:52:02] didn't know it you were still connected
[1:52:05] to something Eternal outside of that you
[1:52:08] just had a beginning like anybody else
[1:52:10] so he said you were a son and daughter
[1:52:12] of God it says that's the only form of
[1:52:14] eternal life and and that and that's
[1:52:16] God's life it says only only one form of
[1:52:20] eternal life and it was God
[1:52:23] and that says to be a Son of God you had
[1:52:27] to be in him always
[1:52:32] you had to be in him always you didn't
[1:52:36] get into God you were always in him and
[1:52:39] that's important because that's the
[1:52:41] image of the new man the thoughts that
[1:52:43] he knew he didn't come from some place
[1:52:45] you learned it the thoughts that's in
[1:52:47] you is the same thoughts that was in the
[1:52:49] beginning it's coming into manifestation
[1:52:52] because you were with him and so as he
[1:52:55] lived you shall live also it says the
[1:52:58] teen of your life spiritual life tonight
[1:53:01] was in God the Father before there was
[1:53:03] every molecule and you are nothing but
[1:53:07] the manifestation of the gene of life
[1:53:10] that was in God as a son of God
[1:53:16] are you demands
[1:53:20] that should speak volume to us
[1:53:22] because if this is not true then we can
[1:53:26] never overcome
[1:53:29] the only way we can overcome is by
[1:53:32] knowing by Believing by living by This
[1:53:36] Promise here the understanding that I
[1:53:39] was in God in the beginning I'm only
[1:53:42] here expressing yes the old men started
[1:53:45] out first that's all right yes the old
[1:53:48] man taught me 12 or 16 or 20 years of
[1:53:51] education that's all right yes I was
[1:53:54] caught up like in all kinds of things
[1:53:56] that's all right oh my like the story of
[1:53:59] an eagle but when you heard the eagle
[1:54:01] scream there has to be something that
[1:54:04] rises up that looks at the 20 25 years
[1:54:07] of education and say this means nothing
[1:54:10] to me I I know this was never in me to
[1:54:13] begin with this is something that I
[1:54:15] heard I heard a scream and that makes
[1:54:17] more sense to me than anything
[1:54:21] you are now exp you are now expressed
[1:54:24] after his word has come into you to
[1:54:30] light up this age
[1:54:36] the new man
[1:54:39] is the only thing that would overcome
[1:54:42] Satan's kingdom
[1:54:44] the new man
[1:54:46] is the one who will take this flesh and
[1:54:49] give God glory to it the new man is the
[1:54:53] one who understands that these hands
[1:54:55] were made to do the things of God this
[1:54:58] mind will make you think the right
[1:55:00] thoughts this body was made for me to
[1:55:03] dress like a Christian to walk like a
[1:55:06] Christian to behave like a Christian to
[1:55:09] bring the image of God into a living
[1:55:11] flesh only the new man has that
[1:55:14] understanding and the promise is only to
[1:55:17] that new man
[1:55:19] amen I know we have baptism this morning
[1:55:22] if the musician could come he says in
[1:55:24] God proving his word he says it says now
[1:55:28] I want you to notice he does it in the
[1:55:31] way he says that he does it in every in
[1:55:34] that way in every age he does it in
[1:55:36] every time by by the same method he has
[1:55:40] taken his Believers and then in order to
[1:55:44] have Believers to meet that word his God
[1:55:48] to predestinate it to that age
[1:55:53] thank you
[1:55:55] so as you see
[1:55:57] he's got to predestinate it the thing to
[1:56:00] be there to meet the challenge of that
[1:56:03] age
[1:56:04] when he predestinated anything to happen
[1:56:07] and said it will happen
[1:56:09] you know what the seed you know what the
[1:56:11] seed will be just the same at that time
[1:56:17] he's never failed
[1:56:20] he's never given his word and something
[1:56:21] else happened
[1:56:23] he's never promised and then we got
[1:56:25] something different
[1:56:26] so if that's true then why don't we live
[1:56:29] by his word
[1:56:32] if that's true then why don't we live by
[1:56:35] that new man
[1:56:37] if that's true if you find a place where
[1:56:39] he has failed then you have every right
[1:56:42] to disbelieve it but the prophet will
[1:56:44] say often at time he says if I ever told
[1:56:47] you something
[1:56:48] quoting Samuel that's never come to pass
[1:56:51] if I ever said something that God say
[1:56:54] with the Lord that's never come to pass
[1:56:56] if I in other words he's not putting me
[1:56:58] honest on himself he's placing you up on
[1:57:01] the unfailing foundation of God for you
[1:57:04] to know what you are built upon
[1:57:08] amen if the person is getting baptized
[1:57:10] if they could get ready
[1:57:13] he says
[1:57:16] Jesus is in the building tonight
[1:57:19] to perform miracles
[1:57:23] but it does it
[1:57:25] through his church
[1:57:31] Jesus is in the building tonight to
[1:57:34] perform and this isn't a message to
[1:57:36] witness
[1:57:37] paragraph 25
[1:57:40] Jesus Christ is in the building tonight
[1:57:42] to perform miracles
[1:57:45] but he does it through his church
[1:57:50] what a place
[1:57:52] God God is not like the air he's not
[1:57:54] going to just move around and hover over
[1:57:57] and and then all of a sudden no he's
[1:57:59] going to dwell in the flesh he's going
[1:58:02] to stand up someone will get inspired
[1:58:04] someone will come and will lay the hands
[1:58:07] of mortal being on the person and
[1:58:09] something will happen someone will be
[1:58:11] inspired to speak the word and one will
[1:58:14] believe the word and the word will
[1:58:16] happen why is always moving in the fact
[1:58:19] God has an agent that he constantly use
[1:58:22] and this morning he wants to use your
[1:58:25] flesh you are the church that he's
[1:58:27] talking about
[1:58:29] yes sir
[1:58:31] but we can only achieve it by the new
[1:58:35] man
[1:58:37] don't let the old man come over
[1:58:40] don't let the old man always resurrect
[1:58:42] every time and cause chaos you take him
[1:58:45] under subjection by the new man you said
[1:58:48] your days are over this is the days for
[1:58:51] the new men to live
[1:58:52] and that's how you can overcome let's
[1:58:55] just bow heads our gracious father we're
[1:58:57] so thankful for your word Lord
