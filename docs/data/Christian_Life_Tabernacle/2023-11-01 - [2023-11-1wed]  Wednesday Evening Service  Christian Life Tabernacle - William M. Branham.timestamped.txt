[0:00] and the Lord has healed her so when the
[0:02] when I went and the doctor said all
[0:04] those things I part of me didn't want to
[0:07] get the blood work because I said well
[0:08] it's done I believe she's going to be
[0:11] well but at the same time the doctors I
[0:14] also didn't want them to you know say
[0:16] well the mother refused treatment so we
[0:20] tried to get the blood they couldn't get
[0:21] the blood they sent me to a lab across
[0:24] the street at the hospital and I had
[0:26] both estra and Isabel and it was a lot
[0:28] of walking I didn't have a stroke with
[0:30] me and I was by myself and it was their
[0:32] nap time so I told my husband I don't
[0:36] know what to do and he said just come
[0:38] home and we can take care of it another
[0:41] another time but I had prayed and said
[0:44] Lord if if they can't get the blood I'm
[0:46] just going to trust you and so we just
[0:50] completely forgot about it and did not
[0:53] get her lab work done and you know we
[0:55] try to get her off those foods but it's
[0:58] hard when your other children are eating
[1:00] those things and she's little and
[1:02] doesn't know any better and so there was
[1:05] a point where I just thought you know
[1:08] what she's well and I'm not going to
[1:13] accept that she has any of these
[1:15] allergies and whether I'm right or wrong
[1:19] I I don't know but I'm going to trust
[1:21] that you know we have this food and it's
[1:23] good food and it's healthy food and I'm
[1:25] going to trust that she's going to be
[1:27] well and it was in but days where I
[1:31] started to notice that she wasn't her
[1:34] skin was not irritated anymore and then
[1:36] little by little the rash started to go
[1:39] away and I noticed that it wasn't coming
[1:44] back and so every time somebody comes up
[1:47] here and testifies then they say well so
[1:50] and so testified and you know it
[1:51] encouraged me to come up here every time
[1:54] brother Mark David comes up and says
[1:56] that I think oh Lord I just I forget to
[1:59] to testify that the Lord has healed her
[2:02] and this allergy that they said would
[2:04] last you know eczema or allergies
[2:07] forever the Lord has healed her and we
[2:10] didn't have to get any blood work she
[2:12] didn't have to stay off Dairy she can
[2:14] drink milk and she can eat the same
[2:17] things that her brothers eat and the
[2:19] Lord has been so gracious to us and I
[2:22] just wanted to thank him and if you're
[2:24] going through something you know brother
[2:26] John um share this song with me and I
[2:30] just pray that it will bless you and
[2:32] know that whatever it is that you're
[2:34] going through the Lord
[2:36] knows he knows your need and he will
[2:43] [Music]
[2:58] supply
[3:04] his love reached from the
[3:07] Heavens to the far ends of the
[3:11] Earth to give you life
[3:16] forever he left no stone
[3:20] unturn and before the birth of
[3:25] time Jesus had you on his m
[3:30] so you never need to
[3:34] question his
[3:37] [Music]
[3:39] concern so what can separate you from
[3:44] the precious love of
[3:48] God who could ever come against his and
[3:54] perfect
[3:56] love so when you're in the the
[4:00] valley and your nights are cold and
[4:06] lonely The Darkest Hour is just before
[4:11] the
[4:13] dawn remember
[4:18] nothing can separate you
[4:23] for God's
[4:28] love
[4:33] he
[4:34] numbers each and every Star and calls
[4:39] them all by
[4:42] name he calls them one by
[4:45] one and sees that they are still in
[4:50] place if he cares for every
[4:54] Star then he sees Right Where You Are
[4:59] you can trust you'll never fall from his
[5:07] Embrace so what can separate you from
[5:13] the precious love of
[5:17] God who could ever come against his
[5:22] strong and perfect
[5:25] love so when you're in the valley

[15:17] amen
[15:18] amen amen we'll we'll be uh listening to
[15:23] a tape uh tonight it was uh what our
[15:26] pastor had in his heart
[15:29] uh the name is is your life worthy of
[15:31] your gospel we'll start from uh
[15:33] paragraph 30 uh it's such a I don't want
[15:36] to make too many comments because I want
[15:38] you to hear I thought it's so amazing
[15:41] that we live in a time where it it
[15:45] doesn't matter what God offers it says
[15:48] people have excuses for not receiving
[15:50] what God is offering and and and so it's
[15:55] it you get in this situation where they
[15:57] said well I I need this I need this but
[16:00] God is offering giving an invitation
[16:02] come they they don't understand that the
[16:04] invitation have what they La in order
[16:07] for them to be what they desire to
[16:09] be the the very invitation to come has
[16:13] what it takes for it to change you to
[16:16] make you clean to give you all that you
[16:18] need in order for you to live right but
[16:20] yet they refuse they reject that
[16:22] invitation oh my it's so amazing so you
[16:25] we we brother bam is going to pray and
[16:28] start at at paragraph 30 and after that
[16:30] it's going to uh read the scripture so
[16:32] once he reads the scripture we can uh we
[16:35] can have our seats uh the brother's in
[16:37] the back if you could just start it up
[16:40] amen Jesus any man physically or woman
[16:44] or child can move back to P pages of
[16:48] this Bible but there's no one that can
[16:52] reveal it but you I pray Lord of taking
[16:56] this text as it's placed upon my heart
[16:59] to send out across the Nations for the
[17:01] people that they might know what type of
[17:04] life is required of them to live for so
[17:07] many has asked me is a Christian Life a
[17:11] life of church service is it helping uh
[17:15] the poor or the needy or is it a
[17:19] constant member is it a loyal loyalty to
[17:23] the church and such
[17:25] questions father may it the correct
[17:29] answer come tonight through these words
[17:31] as we make an Endeavor to to bring them
[17:34] to the people in the name of Jesus
[17:37] Christ we ask that
[17:40] amen now turning your Bibles to the book
[17:45] of St Luke and we'll start at the 14th
[17:49] chapter and the 16th verse to read some
[17:53] scripture for a basis for a background
[17:56] for this that were going to try a lot
[17:59] about 30 to 40 minutes
[18:03] on
[18:05] now the 16th verse of the 14th chapter
[18:08] of St
[18:09] Luke then said he unto him a certain man
[18:15] made a great supper and bed many and
[18:19] sent his servants at supper time to say
[18:21] to them that were bidden come
[18:25] for for All Things Are are now
[18:29] ready and they all with one Accord begin
[18:33] to make
[18:34] excuses the first said unto him I bought
[18:37] a piece of ground and I must need go and
[18:41] see it I pray thee have me
[18:44] excuse and another said I have bought
[18:48] five y yolk of
[18:50] ox and I go to prove them I pray ye have
[18:54] me
[18:55] excused another said I've married a wife
[18:58] wife therefore I cannot come so the
[19:02] servant
[19:04] came and showed his Lord all these
[19:08] things then the master of the house
[19:10] being angry said to his servant notice
[19:13] it's not servant
[19:15] servant go out quickly into the streets
[19:17] and the lane and the cities and bring in
[19:21] hither the poor and the main and the
[19:24] Halt and the
[19:27] blind and the servant said Lord it is
[19:31] done as thou has commanded and yet there
[19:34] is
[19:36] room the Lord said unto the servant go
[19:39] out into the highways and hedges and
[19:41] compel them to come in and my house may
[19:45] be filled for I say unto you that none
[19:49] of those men which were bidden shall
[19:51] taste of my
[19:54] supper now did you notice there was
[19:57] three pools or three turns of
[19:59] it when they went out first and called
[20:04] to them that
[20:05] were uh or bidden to
[20:08] come and they didn't do it so they went
[20:11] out a healing
[20:12] campaign out to get to Blind and Hal and
[20:16] still there were room so he went out and
[20:19] compelled the good bad and indifferent
[20:23] they should come in now you read another
[20:26] parable of this something on in Matthew
[20:29] 22 1 to10 if you'd like to read it later
[20:32] on but I I drew this subject from there
[20:37] uh is your life worthy of the
[20:41] Gospel now Jesus here is saying man has
[20:46] always tried to make
[20:48] excuses not to receive God's word of his
[20:54] invitation though it be firmly proed
[20:58] proving to him that it's that it's his
[21:00] supper and his invitation but man is
[21:03] constantly making
[21:06] excuses and if you read St Matthew uh 22
[21:10] you'll find that the excuses were made
[21:13] there
[21:15] also and and they tried it went back
[21:19] into all ages went back into the age it
[21:23] said a man a viam and had a Vineyard and
[21:28] we find that Parable how he sent his
[21:30] servants to collect from this Vineyard
[21:33] first servant come what did they do they
[21:35] run him off the next servant come they
[21:39] also Stone him and they run servant
[21:43] after servant off the cruel man the king
[21:47] sent finally his
[21:49] son and when his son came we find out
[21:53] that they said this is an air we'll kill
[21:56] him then we'll have of all things then
[21:59] Jesus said to them the king sent forth
[22:03] and slew those murders and burnt their
[22:07] cities now we see when God gives a man
[22:11] an
[22:13] invitation and to do something or to
[22:18] receive the invitation that he's given
[22:21] him and he returns it down then there's
[22:25] nothing left after Mercy is spurn but
[22:29] judgment if you step over the boundaries
[22:31] of Mercy then there's only one thing
[22:34] left and that is
[22:36] judgment and we find that man has done
[22:39] that in all ages it's happened most
[22:43] every age in the
[22:45] Bible when God sent Noah his servant and
[22:49] made an way of an escape for all the
[22:52] people who wanted to to be saved but the
[22:58] people only laughed and scorned at
[23:02] Noah but God made the way but they had
[23:06] an
[23:07] excuse it wasn't according to their to
[23:11] their uh modern thinking it didn't it
[23:15] wasn't the way they wanted it so they
[23:17] made excuses in the days of Noah they
[23:20] made excuses in the days of Moses they
[23:22] made excuses in the Days of Elijah they
[23:25] made excuses in the days of Christ and
[23:27] they make excuses
[23:30] today now him speaking directly to
[23:34] Israel the ones that was called To The
[23:37] Feast then I would also apply today the
[23:42] man the church who has been bidden to
[23:46] come to the feast and won't do it the
[23:49] spiritual Feast of the Lord and they
[23:52] won't do it they don't want to do it
[23:55] they've got other things to do they find
[23:57] excuses
[23:58] now if Israel 2,000 years ago would
[24:02] accepted the invitation that they were
[24:05] given they wouldn't be as they are today
[24:09] 2,000 years ago Israel turned down the
[24:12] invitation to come to the wedding
[24:15] supper and they turned it down and went
[24:19] into judgment but as Jesus said they
[24:23] stoned and killed the prophets that was
[24:26] sent to them
[24:28] um by making excuses now the excuses
[24:33] they made in each day we find in the
[24:36] days of Jesus that he didn't he didn't
[24:39] affiliate with any of them they said
[24:42] when did this man get this learning what
[24:45] school is he from is not this the
[24:48] carpenter son is his mother called Mary
[24:51] is his brothers Jo and James so forth
[24:54] and isn't his sisters with us then we
[24:57] did this man get this authority to do
[25:00] this in other words he didn't affiliate
[25:02] with him so they said he's beah he's a
[25:05] Samaritan he's got a devil and he's mad
[25:08] he's a he's a he's a man that's got an
[25:11] evil spirit on the line of religion and
[25:14] has drove him crazy and that's what he's
[25:17] out there like a wild man don't pay any
[25:20] attention to him and we know what
[25:22] happened to
[25:24] Israel they scamed out they were so sure
[25:28] that that man was wrong until on when
[25:31] they condemned him he said he said let
[25:33] his blood be upon us and upon our
[25:36] children and it's been there ever
[25:38] since Jesus was trying to tell them that
[25:41] their excuses was why kill the prophets
[25:44] and what kill the righteous that
[25:47] come they accepted their Creeds that man
[25:51] had given them instead of taking the
[25:54] word of God and by doing so had made the
[25:56] word of God of no effect now you've
[25:59] either got to say in this that this is
[26:02] God's Will and God's desire or either
[26:05] something else that you can crop up
[26:07] that's better than what this is you have
[26:10] to take one or the other you can't serve
[26:12] God in man and you've got to say this is
[26:16] the truth or that's part of the truth or
[26:20] it isn't all the truth or it isn't put
[26:22] together right or it isn't interpreted
[26:24] right and the Bible said that the word
[26:27] of God is no private
[26:29] interpretation no one else is supposed
[26:31] to put an interpretation to it it's
[26:33] written just the way God wants it
[26:35] interpreted just what it says that
[26:37] that's what it's supposed to be just
[26:39] take it the way it's said way it's wrow
[26:41] down
[26:42] here now they accept their Creeds they
[26:45] make God's promises of no effect to them
[26:49] they bypass that just skip away from it
[26:53] now if Russia had accepted the
[26:56] Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when
[26:59] the Holy Ghost fell in
[27:01] Russia they wouldn't have been
[27:03] Communists
[27:04] today now 75 years ago they had a great
[27:08] Revival in Russia God come among them
[27:12] and they had great Revival way into
[27:15] Siberia and what did they do they
[27:18] rejected it and today the country is
[27:22] gone and the churches can't have church
[27:26] only under permission and they are
[27:29] doomed into judgment and gone off on
[27:32] this wild tantrum of Communism sold out
[27:36] to the
[27:38] devil 50 years ago the Holy Ghost fell
[27:41] in
[27:44] England just after that come George Jeff
[27:48] and FF
[27:50] Bosworth and Charles price Smith
[27:54] Wigglesworth those great warriors of the
[27:57] the faith 50 years ago and offered
[28:01] England the Holy Ghost Revival but what
[28:05] did they do they laughed at him put him
[28:08] in jail called him crazy thought they
[28:12] lost your mind the churches refused the
[28:15] people to come here and they healed the
[28:17] sick and cast out devils and done great
[28:20] works and because that England as a
[28:24] nation rejected the gospel her her her
[28:28] sins is know throughout all the
[28:31] world there's hardly a a more of an
[28:35] apostate a nation in all the world even
[28:38] including Rome and France than England
[28:41] she's a mother of
[28:44] apostasy right where uh finny and many
[28:50] of the great man preached in the hay
[28:52] market and Charles G finny and Wesley
[28:57] and on down and she turned it down and
[29:01] down even last week or two in the papers
[29:05] you find out where their great man has
[29:08] so weakened to the to the sect of women
[29:13] until spies come in and their head man
[29:16] found some more of them the magazines is
[29:19] packed it their sin of stle right in
[29:22] their government has sold their
[29:25] disgraceful Name Across the world
[29:28] why she rejected the truth she had her
[29:34] excuse and she's
[29:36] finished England is all washed up with
[29:40] God a long time
[29:42] ago if America 15 years
[29:46] ago when the Great healing
[29:50] Revival continued on from Pentecost
[29:53] broke out in the nation and there was a
[29:56] re rivals on the Capal Washington DC the
[30:02] presidents vice presidents great people
[30:06] Governors great things taking place
[30:09] Governors and turn their face and say it
[30:11] wasn't so it was right before but they
[30:14] turned it
[30:16] down and tonight that's the reason this
[30:19] nation stays she's doomed there's no
[30:23] hope for it at all she's crossed the
[30:26] line between judgment and mercy and
[30:29] she's elected in what she has here to
[30:32] control the nation and she's rotten to
[30:35] the core her politics is
[30:39] rotten the morals of this nation is
[30:42] lower than anything I can think of and a
[30:46] religious system is rottener than the
[30:50] morals she becomes and doing this she
[30:53] has now joined herself all these Church
[30:57] chur and the the nation into the
[30:59] Federation of churches and taking the
[31:01] mark of the
[31:02] beast what a
[31:04] thing
[31:06] why Christ G them the
[31:09] opportunity come to my Feast the Feast
[31:13] of Pentecost which means 50 when the
[31:16] Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they
[31:19] was called To A Feast of Pentecost
[31:21] spiritual feast and they turned it
[31:24] down England a Holy Ghost is poured out
[31:28] upon them and they turned it down
[31:31] America the Holy Ghost is poured out
[31:33] upon them and they turned it
[31:38] down he bit three times three times he
[31:42] sent out and they did not listen to The
[31:47] Feast then he sent again and he said go
[31:50] and compel those people to
[31:53] come the tables got to be set theable
[31:57] AES ready to steal room I believe that
[32:00] maybe maybe within the next few months
[32:03] or something or a year or whatever it is
[32:05] God's going to send another shaking
[32:08] across the country for there's somebody
[32:10] still out there somewhere that's a
[32:13] predestinated seed that the light has to
[32:15] fall on somewhere somewhere in the
[32:19] world the nation itself is gone I was
[32:23] looking in this week's Life Magazine
[32:26] down at the where down at the Little
[32:29] Rock the other day are rather hot
[32:32] springs and there I seen I believe it
[32:35] was a governor of the state of New York
[32:39] with some kind of a strip tees over in
[32:41] halula dancing with her now in here
[32:46] below that was another renowned man oh
[32:50] what a disgrace look at our nation today
[32:54] look at the condition of our of our
[32:56] nation look where she's went to how low
[33:00] she
[33:01] sunk look at our religious system today
[33:05] how can it be that the churches can ever
[33:09] get into the condition that they are now
[33:12] is because they have rejected and
[33:14] refused the message of God the
[33:17] invitation to come to the feast could
[33:20] you call a life like that worthy of the
[33:24] Gospel could you call a life
[33:27] That Could set and permit their their
[33:31] people to do the things to smoke
[33:34] cigarettes the other day down here a
[33:36] certain church a little league team was
[33:39] playing down here at the park and uh
[33:43] brother-in-law's little boy is a pitcher
[33:46] uh for one of the teams and so he was
[33:49] out there pitching and there was a
[33:51] church league playing and there was the
[33:53] pastor with these little fellas out
[33:56] there on the ground playing and the
[33:58] pastor smoked cigarette after cigarette
[34:01] of a real neighborly church right
[34:05] nearby and could you imagine a man and
[34:08] even people sitting in the audience
[34:11] noticed it but it's getting so that they
[34:14] don't even pay attention to it a certain
[34:17] great church a Baptist Church that I
[34:19] know of lets a church out from Sunday
[34:22] school 15 extra minutes so that the
[34:25] pastor and all of them can stand outside
[34:28] and smoke before they come back in to
[34:30] serve the duty of the
[34:34] law John Smith the founder of that
[34:36] church prayed so hard that God sent the
[34:39] Revival till his eyes swoll shut at
[34:41] night and his wife had to lead him to
[34:43] the table and feed him with a spoon if
[34:45] that man would turn over in his grave if
[34:48] he know that church had got in that
[34:50] condition what is it they were bidden to
[34:54] come and turned it
[34:55] down
[34:57] that's the only thing and you remember
[34:59] Jesus said in here that those that were
[35:02] bidden and turned it down would not
[35:05] taste his
[35:07] supper when God sends the Holy Ghost and
[35:10] knocks at a man's door and he
[35:12] deliberately turns it down sometime he's
[35:15] going to turn it for his last
[35:17] time and then you won't be a privileged
[35:20] character you can sit in the church and
[35:23] listen to the gospel and agree with the
[35:26] gospel
[35:27] you might do so much to say I know it's
[35:30] right but never put a finger on it to
[35:34] help it
[35:35] yourself see you just listen to it
[35:38] because you say I believe it's right
[35:39] that's just sympathizing with
[35:42] it I could say I believe that's a
[35:44] $10,000 that don't mean I got it see I
[35:48] could say that's good cold water but
[35:50] refuse to drink
[35:52] it you know what I mean and this is
[35:55] eternal life
[35:58] and to refuse to do it one day you'll
[36:00] cross the line between judgment and
[36:04] mercy and then you won't be have the
[36:07] privilege to come and receive it to you
[36:10] people who come here I'm not responsible
[36:13] for those who are are other ministers
[36:16] are speaking to but if it's
[36:19] right you owe your life to
[36:23] it what more could you ever find that be
[36:27] more of a benefit to you than to know
[36:30] that you can have eternal
[36:33] life what if I was giving away capsules
[36:36] here that scientifically proven
[36:40] scientifically proven that this capsule
[36:44] would make you live a thousand
[36:48] years well I I'd have to get a militia
[36:51] out here and swarm away from the place
[36:55] you wouldn't have to make an alter call
[36:57] for it you just have to beat him away
[37:00] from it to live a thousand years and yet
[37:05] scientifically
[37:07] proven that the Eternal God all of his
[37:12] power of His resurrections which promis
[37:14] you eternal
[37:16] life and Satan will put his Legions out
[37:19] there and keep you away from
[37:21] it yet you can look and sensible enough
[37:24] look in the face of it and see it's
[37:25] right but then turn it
[37:28] down something some kind of excuse it's
[37:31] too hot I'm too tired I will tomorrow
[37:35] just some kind of an excuse that's all
[37:38] they do by
[37:40] rejecting the day of visitation it
[37:44] separates you from God now we noticed in
[37:48] the Old Testament they had what they
[37:50] call the Jubilee year that was when all
[37:53] the people that was slaves could go free
[37:57] when the Jubilee sounded and then if the
[37:59] man did not go out if there was some
[38:02] excuse that he could give that he didn't
[38:05] want to return to his land then he had
[38:08] to be marked in the ear with an Awe by
[38:11] the post in the temple and then no
[38:13] matter how many jubilees come along that
[38:16] man was sold out he could never no more
[38:20] come back as a citizen in Israel no more
[38:24] what did he do he rejected is
[38:27] invitation he didn't have to pay nothing
[38:30] the debt of his slavery was over his
[38:33] family was free he could go right back
[38:36] to his homeland and get his own
[38:38] possession but if he refused to do it
[38:41] then he wasn't allowed no more with
[38:43] Israel and his possession was given to
[38:45] another now the same thing in the
[38:48] natural applies to the
[38:51] spiritual that if we as inheritance of
[38:55] eternal life and we hear the gospel and
[38:58] know that is true and we reject it and
[39:00] refuse to do it or to listen to it we
[39:03] take on the mark of the
[39:06] beast now somebody said now there's
[39:08] going to be a a mark of the beast is
[39:11] going to come Som day let me tell you
[39:13] it's already
[39:15] come as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to
[39:18] Fall the mark of the beast begin to take
[39:20] place see you only have two things one
[39:24] of them is accepted takes the Seal of
[39:27] God to reject it takes the mark of the
[39:29] beast to reject the Seal of God is to
[39:34] take the mark of the beast everybody
[39:37] understand to reject the Seal of God is
[39:40] to take the mark of the beast for the
[39:42] Bible said all that was not sealed by
[39:44] the Seal of God took the mark of the
[39:47] beast when the trumpet sounded and all
[39:49] wanted to go free could go them it
[39:51] didn't was
[39:52] marked now you see the mark of the beast
[39:57] if we talk about it in the future is
[40:00] when it's going to be made
[40:01] manifest when you realize that what
[40:04] you've already
[40:05] done see and so is the holy spirit it's
[40:10] to be manifested when we see the Lord
[40:13] Jesus coming in glory and feel that
[40:17] transforming power and see the Dead
[40:19] Rising out of the grave and know that a
[40:22] second longer we'll be changed and have
[40:25] a body like
[40:27] is it'll be made manifest then to see
[40:30] those who rejected it will be left down
[40:34] out didn't Jesus said The Virgins went
[40:37] out to meet Christ some of them fell
[40:40] asleep the first watch second third
[40:41] fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch
[40:44] but in the seventh watch then came forth
[40:48] the sound behold the bridegroom cometh
[40:50] go out to meet him and the ones that
[40:52] were sleeping
[40:55] awakened all the age back to Pentecost
[40:59] woke up see from the seventh age the
[41:02] seventh Church age all the way back to
[41:05] woke up and these that were in this
[41:06] church age of living they were changed
[41:09] and they went in at the very time they
[41:11] went in the sleeping virgin come and
[41:13] said we want to buy some of your AR but
[41:16] they said we just got enough for
[41:18] ourselves go to them and sell it and
[41:20] while they were trying to receive this
[41:22] AA the bridegroom
[41:25] came
[41:26] there has never been a time in the
[41:29] history of the world that the
[41:32] episcopalians Baptists methodists
[41:36] Presbyterians the papers are full the
[41:39] religious papers are praising God that
[41:42] those sleeping virgins are now trying to
[41:45] receive
[41:46] Pentecost trying to receive the Holy
[41:49] Ghost and don't the people realize that
[41:53] it will not happen according the word of
[41:56] God while they were trying to come back
[42:00] the bridegroom come and tuck away the
[42:03] bride and they were cast into outer
[42:05] Darkness for
[42:07] judgment because they rejected their
[42:12] invitation all peoples are bidden to
[42:15] come God in every age has sent out his
[42:17] life and it's been rejected and now
[42:21] today is no different from any other day
[42:24] to reject the day of the
[42:27] visitation when God is making a visit to
[42:30] the church and to the people receive it
[42:32] then don't put it off to next year the
[42:35] next Revival that's the hour today is
[42:37] the day of
[42:38] salvation and remember God has never
[42:41] sent a message in any day but what he
[42:44] Vindicated it with the
[42:47] supernatural Jesus said himself if I do
[42:50] not the works of my father then believe
[42:52] me not but if I do the works you believe
[42:56] the works if you can't believe me when
[42:58] you see it clearly cut and and made
[43:02] manifest now the time has come that she
[43:06] rejects it then she's bored in the ear
[43:08] with an awe then she'll never hear it
[43:10] now she takes herself to the
[43:11] confederation of churches to go right in
[43:13] to take the mark of the beast one of the
[43:16] great Ambitions somebody give me the
[43:17] paper in just now this new pope has said
[43:20] is to unite the churches together
[43:23] they'll do it just as certain as I'm
[43:25] standing here and the Protestants fall
[43:29] apart see because the church the Bible
[43:32] said Paul the prophet of the Lord said
[43:36] that day will not come except there come
[43:38] a falling away
[43:40] first and then the man before the man of
[43:43] sin will be
[43:44] revealed he that Seth in the temple of
[43:47] God of holding himself all that's above
[43:49] God he as God forgiving sins on the
[43:53] earth and so forth how that this thing
[43:57] happened but it couldn't happen until
[43:59] the falling away until the church began
[44:01] to get away from the spiritual Feast
[44:04] draw itself back and organize itself and
[44:07] then the Revelation didn't stay with the
[44:10] church remember Israel walked Day and
[44:15] Night by the pillar of
[44:17] fire when that Pillar of Fire move they
[44:20] mooved with it and remember it was a
[44:23] fire at night and a cloud at day so it
[44:26] might come day or night any time but
[44:29] wherever it was there was a propitiation
[44:32] made that they would not fail to see it
[44:34] it was a light at night and a cloud in
[44:37] the daytime and they followed it yes sir
[44:40] the same thing Martin Luther saw it what
[44:43] did he do he come out of Catholicism but
[44:45] what did they do they build a little
[44:47] fence around said we're lutherans this
[44:48] is it then Wesley saw it moving away
[44:51] from there he went what they do build a
[44:53] little fence around and said this is it
[44:55] well I do moved right on again Pentecost
[44:58] saw it what they do moved out of the
[45:00] westling and nazarenes and so forth what
[45:02] did they do they build a fence call
[45:04] we're Oneness and we're Trinity and
[45:06] we're the United and all this what did
[45:08] he do God moved right on out of it see
[45:11] we cannot do that we've got to follow
[45:14] every day every hour of the day every
[45:17] step of the way we've got to be led by
[45:20] the Lord Jesus
[45:22] Christ amen if we don't we take an
[45:25] organization
[45:26] life and a life that doesn't follow
[45:29] Christ daily is not worthy a man that's
[45:32] a Christian on Sunday and goes the
[45:34] church sits back there thinks he owns
[45:36] the church because he does this that the
[45:38] other and on Monday oh steal and lie and
[45:43] women that'll go out on the public
[45:46] beaches and and out up the streets with
[45:48] immoral clothes
[45:50] on I thought of of uh the first lady
[45:54] wouldn't even put on makeup to go before
[45:56] the pope and come back and set a
[45:58] Waterhead haircut uh uh spree for the
[46:02] women in the nation and all these uh
[46:05] dresses that when she's become mother
[46:07] every woman in the country wants to wear
[46:09] one of them uh mother type dresses now
[46:12] that's
[46:12] trying it's examples that they know that
[46:15] those people would do that they take on
[46:18] a spirit of the world and that don't
[46:21] belong in the Church of the Living God
[46:24] praise the Lord women ought to look to
[46:26] Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah
[46:29] and name of the Old
[46:31] Testament now they got so that I
[46:33] preaching the other night somewhere
[46:35] about a women to obey their husband
[46:40] obey that went out and Mar you it's a
[46:43] long time ago but uh they ain't going to
[46:45] do that no sir they live in America and
[46:49] they let you know so they not going to
[46:51] obey but as long as you don't do it
[46:53] don't never try to call yourself a
[46:55] Christian
[46:57] because you're not I don't care how much
[46:58] you dance and speak with tongues if you
[47:00] don't obey your husband you're out of
[47:02] the will of God a woman that wears
[47:05] shorts and does these things that she
[47:07] does on the street don't call yourself a
[47:10] Christian you want to have the world and
[47:12] still hold your testimony you cannot do
[47:16] that in the presence of God when you
[47:17] know better than to do
[47:21] it notice bored in the ear marked away
[47:26] then you'll never hear remember that's a
[47:28] sign of closing the ears you won't hear
[47:30] it no more you won't listen You'll never
[47:32] be able to get to it again oh she don't
[47:35] believe that oh my don't tell her she
[47:37] believes it no she tell you right she
[47:39] don't know
[47:40] it how could a a lady it's ask you how
[47:45] could a lady as I spoke Sunday last
[47:47] Sunday night a week ago tonight on of
[47:50] red flashing light how that the the the
[47:54] Run of women has has become prettier
[47:57] than it ever was now that's nothing
[47:58] nothing against a woman now that's just
[48:00] but how she controls that see that she's
[48:04] got that way to put her in a Temptation
[48:07] like Eve was put before the
[48:09] tree every man every son that comes to
[48:13] God's got to go through that hour of
[48:16] testing this is the age of women this
[48:19] nation is or she has to go through that
[48:22] testing if she can be a pretty woman and
[48:24] act like a
[48:26] sister the Lord's blessings upon on her
[48:29] but when she can get herself to to know
[48:33] this and display herself absolutely
[48:36] shows that she's got a a bad Spirit on
[48:40] her she don't mean to be that way I
[48:42] don't think many of them don't but they
[48:45] don't realize that could you tell me
[48:47] that a decent thinking
[48:50] woman could put herself on these little
[48:53] uh clothes that they wear out here on
[48:55] the street
[48:57] I've got two young girls sitting here I
[49:00] don't know what the outcome of them kids
[49:02] will be I just pray for them kids today
[49:05] I don't you can't tell I don't know
[49:08] they're not immune from that they've got
[49:10] to stand on their own two feet before
[49:12] Jesus Christ and give an answer they
[49:14] can't go in on what on on what I believe
[49:16] and what their mother believes I don't
[49:18] know what they do but I actually believe
[49:20] at this
[49:21] hour if them girls went out on the
[49:24] street with them kind of clothes
[49:26] and a man insulted them and I'm kind of
[49:28] close I don't believe if I had the
[49:30] opportunity I could even condemn the
[49:32] man that's right I condemn the girls
[49:37] they had no business doing
[49:39] that listen if man thinks that and they
[49:43] teach that man's no more than an animal
[49:45] he come from the animal race and look
[49:48] then and you put him out there like you
[49:49] take the dog to the little female at
[49:51] certain
[49:53] times through the fences and everything
[49:55] else because the little female is in
[49:57] that condition Hogs cows every other
[50:00] animal and if we are animal life which
[50:03] we are the physical part and then when a
[50:06] woman displays herself like that she
[50:09] proves that she's the same thing the
[50:10] little dog is the
[50:12] same or she wouldn't be doing that she
[50:16] knows nature teaches her that man's
[50:19] going to look at and the Bible said
[50:21] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[50:23] after her has committed a with her
[50:26] already in his heart that puts a testing
[50:28] time and the devil pretties that women
[50:30] and strips them down and set them out
[50:32] there to give you a test man turn your
[50:34] heads be sons of
[50:37] God women you dress like Daughters of
[50:40] God don't answer for adultery y today if
[50:43] that woman no matter how innocent she
[50:45] might have never done nothing wrong
[50:48] never even had their mind to do wrong
[50:50] but when that sinner who looked upon
[50:52] that graceful Farm of that woman knowing
[50:55] he's a male and female sex and and one
[50:58] glands and one in male in the other and
[51:01] that sinner is going to have to answer
[51:02] for it at the day of the Judgment who
[51:04] did it who's guilty not him
[51:10] you there you
[51:12] are immoral look at this nation it used
[51:16] to be when we they had the knee high
[51:19] dresses that the women War we had to
[51:21] send to Paris to get them today Paris
[51:24] sends here to get them amen it's got so
[51:26] filthy the parish can't keep up with it
[51:29] that's right the whole FL rejecting the
[51:34] gospel why Paris didn't have it it's
[51:37] 100%
[51:39] Catholicism the Protestants can't even
[51:41] get in there look at vram I think
[51:43] there's only 600 Christians in all Paris
[51:46] out of the millions 600 Christians
[51:49] Protestants that's not Holy Ghost fil
[51:52] that's just absolutely Protestants 600
[51:55] out the millions times
[51:57] millions they didn't get the opportunity
[52:00] to reject it but these people had the
[52:03] gospel and when they get away from the
[52:05] message and the gospel that they've seen
[52:07] demonstrated make fun of it because some
[52:09] old prostitute Doctrine has weaved them
[52:13] around in some Pastor standing the pull
[52:15] pit thinking more of a dollar in a meal
[52:17] ticket than he does with the soul of
[52:19] people that he's
[52:23] preaching that's what's done it now she
[52:25] leads the world you remember not long
[52:28] ago in this Tabernacle I preached on a
[52:30] subject about 20 years ago I'll show you
[52:32] the goddess of America and had the
[52:34] little flapper here sitting there with
[52:36] that's what it
[52:38] is now they're even get it they're
[52:41] getting what they've asked for and
[52:42] they're going to get it that's all oh
[52:46] they won't believe it no sir they let
[52:48] you know they're American citizens and
[52:50] they got a right to to function any way
[52:52] they want to I just wish let me tell you
[52:56] I'll tell you now no sure politics will
[53:00] never work no sure democracy will never
[53:02] work amen democracy is rotten to the
[53:06] Bone amen if it could be run amongst a
[53:09] bunch of Christians it would be fine but
[53:12] when you put it out there in the world
[53:13] it becomes all sales and no anchor
[53:17] exactly right look at here today
[53:19] anything can take place and they'll be
[53:21] just anything pull a few politics and
[53:23] you get by with murder when I preached
[53:26] down there that night to try to save
[53:27] them two kids' life they're as guilty as
[53:30] guilty could be even that attorney got
[53:33] up behind me there and he said it's
[53:36] right he said I don't believe in taking
[53:38] the people's life he said if you'll
[53:40] notice on your criminal records who is
[53:42] it it gets killed electric chairs and
[53:44] things it's not the
[53:46] rich he can afford to get him a lawyer
[53:48] some pull some dirty tricks and some
[53:50] wheel sharing some over here and bribe
[53:53] the thing he said his poor kids like
[53:55] that it ain't got enough money to buy a
[53:57] decent meal that's a kind of guess it
[53:59] there's a kind of electrocute somebody's
[54:02] like they call a bunch of ignorant
[54:03] people and they just hold up their name
[54:05] of capital punishment I said the first
[54:08] murder was ever committed in the world
[54:10] one brother killed another God did not
[54:12] take his life for it he put a mark on
[54:14] him that nobody should take his life
[54:17] right that's a supreme judge I see they
[54:21] tuck the sentence off of them now they
[54:23] go to get another trial of course
[54:24] they'll get now which should be 11 years
[54:26] and maybe stand for parole they're
[54:28] guilty certainly they're guilty they
[54:29] ought to be set to Penitentiary for
[54:31] Lifetime but not their life take no man
[54:34] has a right to take another man's life
[54:36] no sir I don't believe in it no indeed
[54:39] oh they say well they don't believe that
[54:42] they're out of the will of the Lord
[54:43] because that's all they know about and
[54:45] all they want to hear about they turned
[54:47] their ear against the truth and there
[54:50] neither did Egypt want to know that that
[54:51] bunch of Holy Rollers down there was the
[54:54] will of Lord how they want to know that
[54:56] some crazy man come in there from the
[54:58] Wilderness with Whiskers hanging down
[55:00] like this and said Pharaoh I come in the
[55:02] name of the Lord turn them children
[55:04] loose Pharaoh would say who
[55:08] me throw him
[55:10] out see me if you don't do it the Lord's
[55:15] God's going to Smite this nation the the
[55:18] old crank turn him out somewhere let him
[55:20] go the sun's kind of baked his mind see
[55:24] but it brought J
[55:26] jallu because the man was a prophet and
[55:29] had thus sayth the
[55:31] Lord hallu exactly right they didn't
[55:35] want to believe it Rome didn't want to
[55:37] believe it
[55:38] either but it happened just the same
[55:41] Israel didn't want to believe that that
[55:42] was a messiah how could they bunch a
[55:45] bunch of galileans and aren't not all
[55:47] these
[55:48] galileans where did they come from what
[55:51] kind of a crowd does he go with the very
[55:53] poorest that can be got together that's
[55:55] the crowd he Associates with that's who
[55:57] comes to hearing is the poor people that
[56:01] people that don't know nothing they're
[56:03] not elected they're not they're not the
[56:05] intellectual type that we are they're
[56:07] poor Bunch you heard say about the
[56:09] Revival in this thing what kind of crowd
[56:11] hears them what kind goes to these
[56:14] meetings what kind of people are they I
[56:17] heard a fell say not long ago well it
[56:20] was kind of a he was hope stepfather and
[56:23] I was telling him about the baptism Holy
[56:25] Spirit he said now who would believe a
[56:27] thing like that let some kind of a bunch
[56:29] like you got up there he said you let so
[56:32] and so a business man you're of the Town
[56:34] a wicked is all go let him say that he
[56:36] received the Holy Ghost then I believe
[56:38] it I said don't worry he'll never say
[56:41] it a man died instantly without
[56:45] God be careful what you're doing be
[56:48] careful what you're saying you want a
[56:50] life worthy of the Gospel that's right
[56:53] Israel didn't believe it that but bunch
[56:55] of people that mad
[56:56] man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth
[56:59] born they thought an illegitimate birth
[57:02] and the people believed it because they
[57:03] said that wasn't his why his father's
[57:06] Joseph and Mary was to have this baby
[57:08] before he's even
[57:09] born what it's illegitimate what is he
[57:12] just a mad man one of them funny sort of
[57:14] a GU don't go to hear him what did they
[57:18] do they were sending their souls to
[57:22] hell they T Jesus said let them alone if
[57:25] a blind leads a blind don't they both
[57:27] fall in the ditch that's right they
[57:29] didn't know it they wouldn't believe it
[57:32] they could not they could not see how
[57:34] that a simple people with a simple
[57:37] message to be rejected could cause a
[57:40] great nation to fall to
[57:43] ruins now listen they could not
[57:46] understand that a simple ordinary common
[57:49] bunch of people you know the Bible said
[57:51] that the Common People heard Jesus
[57:53] gladly
[57:55] I had a little something that happened
[57:56] in Mexico not long ago General valinia
[58:00] elected of God the light shine across
[58:02] his P once in one of the meetings that
[58:05] great Catholic Warrior one of the
[58:07] highest Generals in Mexico come humbly
[58:09] to The Altar and receive the baptism of
[58:11] the Holy Ghost he went back down in
[58:13] Mexico he kept crying to me come down
[58:15] there finally I decided to go down the
[58:17] Lord led me had a vision told my wife
[58:20] went down there and when he did him
[58:21] being one of the chief generals fourstar
[58:23] General he went to the headquarters to
[58:25] the government and they they're hard
[58:27] against Protestants down there you know
[58:28] so they know this going to be a terrific
[58:30] meeting so he went down there and got a
[58:32] militia guard and when they did they got
[58:35] the big arena and they was going to
[58:37] bring me in like that the government was
[58:39] bringing me in so when they did the the
[58:43] bishop one of the great Bishops of the
[58:45] Catholic Church went up to him to the
[58:47] governor and said sir I understand that

[58:52] non-catholic said yes what about it
[58:55] why he said you can't have a man like
[58:57] that in here this government has never
[58:59] know to doing a thing like that but said

[59:19] converted under this man said well he's
[59:21] a as far as I know a reputable person
[59:24] said thousand of people that claim will
[59:25] come hear him and this uh Bishop said

[59:40] the
[59:44] ignor that was enough that settled
[59:49] it oh my that dehorned him yes sir

[1:02:48] too I said if they're living or he said
[1:02:51] you can't be a saint until you're
[1:02:53] dead
[1:02:56] there you are see and the people you see
[1:02:58] the other day where they had this nun

[1:03:08] that she come back from the dead and
[1:03:09] prayed for some sick person that had
[1:03:11] leukemia wasn't this in one of the
[1:03:12] magazines just think how they try to
[1:03:15] play that up and one of these hundreds
[1:03:18] and hundreds of cases right under the
[1:03:20] nose of the people here what's that
[1:03:22] thing for a thing to play the Protestant
[1:03:24] church right into it see they can think
[1:03:26] something man the real works of the Lord
[1:03:28] was perfectly ad Vindicated proved they
[1:03:30] are dares to touch the paper with it
[1:03:33] there you are they received an
[1:03:34] invitation and turned it down yes sir
[1:03:38] they can't understand how a simple
[1:03:40] message a simple people to reject a
[1:03:42] thing like that would cause them to go
[1:03:45] into chaos a woman said to me Grant
[1:03:48] Pastor argon sometime ago Catholic girl
[1:03:50] come out there to condemn and write up
[1:03:52] to the newspaper report pack cigarettes
[1:03:54] in her hand and she said I want to talk
[1:03:57] to you I said what does she want to say
[1:03:59] she said I want to ask you some
[1:04:01] questions about this your religion of
[1:04:02] yours and I said what is it you want to
[1:04:04] ask and she said by what Authority you
[1:04:07] do this I said in the name of Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ by a Divine call and she went
[1:04:11] ahead smarting off I said just a minute
[1:04:13] she said if I had to associate with that
[1:04:15] bunch of ignoramuses up there she said I
[1:04:17] wouldn't even want to be a Christian she
[1:04:19] said and if them they say that them
[1:04:21] people will rule the Earth someday she
[1:04:23] said I hope I'm not here I said don't
[1:04:24] worry you won't be I said you had to
[1:04:26] worry about that well she said all that
[1:04:29] they're carrying on and screaming I said
[1:04:32] and you claim to be a Catholic she said
[1:04:34] I am I said did you know the Blessed
[1:04:36] Virgin Mary had to receive the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost and speak in tongues and dance in
[1:04:39] the spirit the same way they did before
[1:04:41] God a receive her you call her the
[1:04:43] mother of God she said that's nonsense I
[1:04:45] just a minute how am I supposed to look
[1:04:47] at the Bible I said then how you going
[1:04:49] to know what's truth or not she said I
[1:04:50] take my church's word I said but this is
[1:04:52] God's word here it is right here I'll
[1:04:55] challenge you to look at it and Mary was
[1:04:57] with them up there in the upper room and
[1:04:58] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:00] after you call her the mother of God the
[1:05:03] Lord I said then call that bunch of
[1:05:04] trash backwash I said don't worry you
[1:05:07] won't be there you don't have much to
[1:05:08] worry about if that's all you got to
[1:05:10] worry about you better worry about your
[1:05:12] own sinful Soul girl and I let her go
[1:05:16] now think of all this a simple God makes
[1:05:20] it so simple how could Ahab how could
[1:05:24] Jezebel how could those people who
[1:05:27] thought that Elijah was a
[1:05:29] witch thought he was a spiritualist even
[1:05:33] Ahab said here's the one that's caused
[1:05:35] all this trouble to Israel he said
[1:05:38] you're the one's trouble
[1:05:40] Israel how could that Nation think that
[1:05:43] to reject the message of a fuzzy faed
[1:05:45] man like that no Priestly garments on
[1:05:48] and so forth would be the condemnation
[1:05:51] of it how could Egypt that rule the
[1:05:55] world pharaohs and his class and dignity
[1:05:58] the world has never come to that place
[1:06:00] again and Science and so forth how could
[1:06:04] they think to reject an old prophet of
[1:06:07] 80 years old with Whiskers hanging down
[1:06:11] gray hair stomping out of there a
[1:06:13] fugitive and come out there with a
[1:06:16] message you'll either let them go God
[1:06:18] will destroy the
[1:06:20] nation how could Pharaoh you B me
[1:06:24] Pharaoh Pharaoh said
[1:06:26] obey oh him
[1:06:28] pharaoh and an old man some old Crank
[1:06:32] that all turn a god down like that
[1:06:33] destroy but it did
[1:06:35] it oh my let's stop pause a few minutes
[1:06:39] and have a prayer and think what day are
[1:06:43] we living in where are we at in another
[1:06:46] modern scientific age we better think
[1:06:50] maybe you stop people stop pray a little
[1:06:52] while and think a little bit you feel
[1:06:54] better have to get through doing it
[1:06:55] that's right a Christian is not a tool
[1:06:59] or some kind of a mechanical wrench to a
[1:07:01] great big religious regime that's right
[1:07:05] a Christian is not some kind of tool
[1:07:06] that keeps a religious organization
[1:07:09] moving a Christian that is not a
[1:07:12] Christian a Christian is to be
[1:07:15] Christlike and a Christian cannot be a
[1:07:17] Christian until Christ comes into the
[1:07:19] man the Life of Christ in him then it
[1:07:22] produces the life that Christ Liv and
[1:07:25] you do the things that Christ
[1:07:28] did what am I talking about personal
[1:07:32] relationship to Christ what is it is
[1:07:35] your life worthy of the Gospel now I'm
[1:07:39] trying to lay that background there to
[1:07:41] show you that man and women who were
[1:07:43] renowned women man the Bible said did
[1:07:47] you notice last Sunday night something I
[1:07:49] forgot to put in Genesis the 6th chapter

[1:07:54] to them women for wives were man of old
[1:07:59] Renown renowned man predicted to come

[1:08:40] prostitute but she's all sexy dressed
[1:08:42] and throw herself out there to display
[1:08:44] her female flesh and the man fell
[1:08:48] far what we need today is sons of God we
[1:08:52] need man in government sons of God
[1:08:56] that's right therefore a good Godly king
[1:08:59] would stop all this nonsense there would
[1:09:01] be no strings to pull like David did he
[1:09:04] put a stop to it certainly did because
[1:09:07] he was a king and there was only the
[1:09:11] real way is God being the king and God
[1:09:14] sends a prophet didn't Samuel tell them
[1:09:16] before they ever got a king he said
[1:09:19] God's your king have I ever told you
[1:09:21] anything in the name of the Lord but
[1:09:23] what come to pass they said no that's
[1:09:24] right have I ever bummed you for your
[1:09:27] living no you never did bum us for a
[1:09:29] living I've never told you enough but
[1:09:31] what was right before the Lord said God
[1:09:33] is your
[1:09:35] king oh we realize that we know you're a
[1:09:38] good man Samuel we believe the word of
[1:09:39] the Lord comes to you but we want a king
[1:09:41] anyhow that's what they get Pentecost
[1:09:44] want an organization anyhow you got it
[1:09:47] that's right want to be like the rest of
[1:09:49] the churches you are go ahead that
[1:09:51] that's just why it takes but God is our
[1:09:53] King
[1:09:54] God is our King yes sir what is it is
[1:09:59] because that the people like they did in
[1:10:01] the days of Christ like they have in
[1:10:04] every age they find an
[1:10:07] excuse they have their own Creeds you
[1:10:10] might not want to say I I bought a cow
[1:10:12] and I got to go see whether she she will
[1:10:15] work or not or give milk or what stock
[1:10:17] she is you might not have that excuse
[1:10:19] but here's the kind of excuse that
[1:10:21] people may say I'm a presbyterian we
[1:10:23] don't believe in that I'm Baptist we
[1:10:26] don't believe in no such stuff as that
[1:10:29] well I'm a Lutheran well that don't have
[1:10:32] anything to do with it that don't mean
[1:10:34] you're Christian that means that you
[1:10:36] belong to a bunch of people that's
[1:10:37] organizing you belong to the Lutheran
[1:10:39] LOD the Baptist Lodge the Pentecostal
[1:10:43] Lodge there is no such a thing as
[1:10:45] Pentecostal Church there is no such a
[1:10:47] thing as Baptist Church it's Baptist
[1:10:49] Lodge Pentecostal Lodge Presbyterian
[1:10:52] Lodge but but there's only one church
[1:10:54] and there's only one way you can get
[1:10:56] into it that's by
[1:10:58] birth you're born into the Church of
[1:11:01] Jesus Christ and a member of his body of
[1:11:04] the spiritual delegation of heaven then
[1:11:07] the signs that Christ is with you lives
[1:11:10] through you Christians all you must have
[1:11:13] a personal relationship to
[1:11:18] God in order to be a Son of God you must
[1:11:22] become Rel to God he must be your
[1:11:26] father in order for you to be a son and
[1:11:29] only his sons and daughters are saved
[1:11:33] not the members of a church but Sons and
[1:11:35] Daughters there's only thing one thing
[1:11:37] that will produce that that's the new
[1:11:40] birth the new birth is the only thing
[1:11:43] that will produce relationship to
[1:11:46] God is that right Sons and Daughters
[1:11:49] then when this takes place then the man
[1:11:52] here's the question I want to get to you
[1:11:54] the man says what do we do then after
[1:11:57] we've been born again so many ask me
[1:11:59] that questions what should I do then
[1:12:01] brother Brandon if you are born again
[1:12:04] your entire nature is changed you are
[1:12:07] dead to the things you once
[1:12:09] thought what you say brother Brandon
[1:12:11] when I join church I got that well then
[1:12:14] when God said Jesus Christ is the same
[1:12:16] yesterday and forever he still heals the
[1:12:18] sick he still shows Vision but brother
[1:12:20] Brandon my church now you're not born
[1:12:22] again
[1:12:25] you can't be for if the very God if his
[1:12:29] life is in you like that you're in the
[1:12:31] life of your father and if the very life
[1:12:34] of God is in you and the Very spirit
[1:12:36] that was in Christ in you how can the
[1:12:38] spirit live in Jesus Christ and write
[1:12:41] this and then come back down in you and
[1:12:42] deny
[1:12:45] that can't do it it'll punctuate every
[1:12:48] word to be so then if you say well I'm a
[1:12:51] good member of the church that don't
[1:12:53] happen have one thing to do with it I
[1:12:55] know the heathens Down in Africa amongst
[1:12:57] my dark Brethren down there I find the
[1:13:00] morals of them people higher than than
[1:13:02] 90% of the American
[1:13:05] people while in some of the tribes there
[1:13:08] if a young girl is not married till
[1:13:09] she's a certain age or when she's a
[1:13:12] certain size and no one has taken her
[1:13:14] yet they know there's something wrong
[1:13:16] they excommunicate her she take off
[1:13:18] tribal paint she goes to the city then
[1:13:20] she just becomes a
[1:13:21] renegade and when she's married she's
[1:13:23] tested for her virginy if the little
[1:13:26] virgin Veil is broke then she has to
[1:13:27] tell who done it and they kill them both
[1:13:30] together would it be a lot of Killing In
[1:13:32] America if that taking place then you
[1:13:35] call them
[1:13:36] heathens oh my they can come teach
[1:13:39] people to call themselves church members
[1:13:41] how to live clean that's right never
[1:13:44] found one case of anural in the whole
[1:13:46] trip through South Africa you don't have
[1:13:49] such a thing there you are see it's just
[1:13:52] our own dirty filthy ways it's white
[1:13:55] people that's right got away from
[1:13:58] God when this takes place the thing you
[1:14:01] do then you'll find out that the spirit
[1:14:03] that comes in you from the New Birth you
[1:14:06] will believe and do everything that God
[1:14:09] says in his words for you to do amen and
[1:14:13] everything that the Bible quotes for you
[1:14:15] to do you'll punctuate with
[1:14:17] amen and you'll not stop day and night
[1:14:20] until you receive it that's right that's
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:23] and in all this time you'll certainly
[1:14:26] above everything bear the fruit of the
[1:14:29] spirit you say will I speak with tones
[1:14:31] you might do that and you might not well
[1:14:34] I shout you might do that you might not
[1:14:36] but there's one sure thing you will do
[1:14:39] you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:14:42] and the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:14:46] peace Faith longsuffering meekness
[1:14:49] gentleness patience your temper not be
[1:14:54] just remember when you got that that
[1:14:56] poisons the holy spirit away from
[1:14:58] you when you get to a place that you
[1:15:01] want to fuss with everybody you come
[1:15:04] along to there's something
[1:15:06] wrong when you get a place where the a
[1:15:09] minister read from the Bible That's
[1:15:11] wrong to do a certain thing you just
[1:15:15] remember there's no Christianity there
[1:15:17] at
[1:15:17] all that's now that by the fruits you
[1:15:20] shall know that that's what Jesus said
[1:15:22] see if it's the word and God said so yet
[1:15:26] spirit in you will cope with that word
[1:15:27] every time called genuine Holy Spirit
[1:15:31] Will cope with the word because the word
[1:15:34] is life in spirit Jesus said my words
[1:15:37] are life and if you've got eternal life
[1:15:40] and he is the word how can the word deny
[1:15:43] the word that's right what kind of
[1:15:45] person would you make
[1:15:47] God that's one thing to know that you're
[1:15:49] a Christian when you can fully agree
[1:15:51] upon every word of God and and you find
[1:15:53] yourself in love with your
[1:15:56] enemies somebody said well he's nothing
[1:15:58] but a holy ruler and you start get oh be
[1:16:02] careful be careful but when you really
[1:16:04] find yourself that you love him
[1:16:07] regardless of what they do you still
[1:16:08] love
[1:16:09] him then you're begin to find and your
[1:16:12] patience gets from about that long till
[1:16:14] it just don't have no end anybody just
[1:16:16] keeps saying things about you I don't
[1:16:18] care what you say don't get stirred up
[1:16:20] if you get stirred up you better go pray
[1:16:22] first before you talk him again no don't
[1:16:26] get in fusses don't like to get in fuss
[1:16:29] if you like to see somebody raised up in
[1:16:30] the church say you know what I'll tell
[1:16:31] you so and so did so and so say nah
[1:16:33] brother shame on you if you say oh is
[1:16:36] that so listen to that Scandal what
[1:16:39] shout the holy spirit's not a Cess pool
[1:16:43] no no no the heart is occupied by the
[1:16:46] holy spirit is full of
[1:16:47] Holiness de he thinketh no evil doeth no
[1:16:51] evil believeth all all things endureth
[1:16:55] longsuffering
[1:17:04] see sorry I feel like I'm just stopping
[1:17:07] at the good stuff here you know you
[1:17:09] could just go on home and finish it up
[1:17:13] amen I I trust that was a blessing to
[1:17:16] you amen if the musician could come you
[1:17:22] know
[1:17:23] the reality of the message is in the
[1:17:26] message itself you don't have to look
[1:17:28] elsewhere you you you know I don't even
[1:17:32] want to go through it but just look at
[1:17:36] what the description of the time we are
[1:17:39] living in the description of the church
[1:17:42] the description of politics of women
[1:17:46] what the condition that the world is in
[1:17:48] because they rejected because you reject
[1:17:52] all you have left is is the mark of the
[1:17:53] beast you can't you can't have a Rel you
[1:17:56] can't reject the word and have some form
[1:17:59] of religion and and think it's going to
[1:18:01] produce the life it's never going to
[1:18:03] produce it the only thing that would
[1:18:05] produce the life is the word that God
[1:18:07] has sent they rejecting it and what they
[1:18:10] left with as intellect and rules and do
[1:18:13] this don't do that and everything but
[1:18:15] when you receive the word and I like
[1:18:17] this you know he's talking about who are
[1:18:19] these people that you're going to go to
[1:18:21] who are they you know the bunch of in
[1:18:23] the non-educated bunch of people all of
[1:18:26] that well that's God's kind you know
[1:18:29] he's not looking for the inner like
[1:18:31] those educated one is looking for
[1:18:33] believers those that have something
[1:18:35] within them to believe the word and they
[1:18:37] are found everywhere God has them
[1:18:40] everywhere and they don't care how they
[1:18:42] look like they're not they're not rich
[1:18:44] they're not poor they're not anything
[1:18:46] that whatever situ whatever condition
[1:18:48] they are in one thing makes them certain
[1:18:51] one thing there is one characteristics
[1:18:53] about them is all they want is the word
[1:18:56] of God I want to say this from my heart
[1:18:58] this is the kind of life I
[1:19:00] want the exactly what he describing not
[1:19:03] some something I made up on my own mind
[1:19:06] and what Christianity should or should
[1:19:08] not be no exactly this description no
[1:19:12] fing and love for everybody and you know
[1:19:16] the holy spirit in it may speak in
[1:19:18] tongue may not speak in tongue but love
[1:19:20] for everybody wanting to do the work of
[1:19:23] God interested in helping people that's
[1:19:26] the Christian
[1:19:27] Life not not knowing all the books of
[1:19:31] the Bible and quoting everything and no
[1:19:33] the very life that was in Christ because
