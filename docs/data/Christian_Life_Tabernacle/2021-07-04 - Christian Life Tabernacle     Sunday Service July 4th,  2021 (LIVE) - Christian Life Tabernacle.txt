glory we just pray this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray amen amen well good morning as you can see the lot has fallen to me to do a couple of things we're going to go ahead and do the psalm this morning happy fourth of july you know today is independence day it's a time when we in america take time to remember and celebrate the freedom which has been so dearly bought and paid for by so many men and women it's the remembrance of being free from bondage being free from tyranny it's the remembrance of when a declaration of independence was made or at least that's what it's supposed to be but you know when we live in a we find ourselves in a society that's increasingly confusing freedom with bondage you know it's uh anyone who's a student of history will know will be able to recognize that when a declaration of independence was made it was with the understanding that the word would be the foundation upon which freedom was built and yet when you remove that absolute all it becomes is men fighting with one another for control of the narrative of the hour you know freedom has become nothing more than one's ability to impose their will and their preference and their beliefs and their fears on another person you know the airwaves newspapers the social networks are all filled with voices clamoring for you to get on board and adopt one of these messages all of you all of them requiring us to compromise on the word in some way you know it can be intimidating it can be overwhelming to be surrounded by all of these voices and you know if it wasn't for the lord coming by our way there's no telling which one of these things we would be caught up in and which would have dominion over our lives you know if we turn to psalm 124 this morning it's interesting because david seems to speak of a similar experience you know he's speaking of a people god's people the people of the word being surrounded by men who would seek to swallow them up with pressure and all because of they would not be part of one of those kingdoms you know he begins the psalm by saying if it had not been the lord who was on our side you know when i was thinking about that that's the only difference i imagine we could go through this place and start that statement if it had not been the lord that was by our side blank the room would be filled with testimony after testimony after testimony of what would likely have happened maybe beyond our imagination if the lord had not been by our side you know as we read the rest of the psalm you know and we'll read it here in a second how he describes you know men trying to swallow them up with pressure all the voices all the intimidation all because there was a people a people of the word a chosen people that would not ally themselves and that stood in the way frankly of all the kingdoms of the world you know i thought that sounded familiar today but you know in the middle of all of this david makes an interesting statement something that i guess could be a declaration of independence and it's in verse 6 and verse 7 it says this blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped if that isn't a declaration of independence i don't know what is you know there's another people of the word who find themselves in this hour surrounded by similar pressure similar demands similar intimidation all asking us to compromise on the word in some way you know it's easy to in a moment of weakness become influenced by one or by the other but you know we have a declaration of independence to make the lord has come by our way and no matter how intimidating or how much pressure these voices or these influencers these narratives of the day might be blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth the snare is broken and we are escaped you know someone came by our way and shined a light and we recognize the devil and all of his tricks and i'm grateful this morning that my sheep hear my voice and another voice they will not follow we can celebrate independence today like no other can the fact that we've been set free from all those voices from all those snares from all those influences that would seek to pull us down the snare is broken and we are escaped so let's read that together you know psalm 124 you know it just struck me as we're celebrating freedom as a country let's celebrate the freedom that we've been given the snare is broken and we are escaped let's read that together if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul then the proud waters had gone over our soul blessed be the lord who had not given us as a prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth amen you may be seated amen let's go ahead and missing that song amazing grace shall always be my song of praise [Music] praise [Music] foreign i'll never know [Music] [Music] i shall be [Music] boys

is requesting prayers for their nephew nesbitt jr who was diagnosed with glioblastoma cancer which has rapidly increased to stage four and the doctors say there is no hope and no way to help him but we believe nothing is impossible with god we know of both a hope and a way that nothing is impossible for him we want to go ahead and remember nesbitt in prayer this morning we also have a request

it and rejoice we ask you to bless us this morning in jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning let's turn in our bibles we have a lot of out for the holiday but we just ask the lord would really keep them and and bless them and we are going to continue in our message the easter seal and you know brother branham i i've always kind of viewed it personally in this light that you know brother branham addressed the bigger picture which i called the age he addressed the age and then he also addressed the church which i refer to as the bride so he spoke to the whole time that we live in he addressed that he addressed the church and the bride and he also addresses the individual so there's all the time that he's ministering there's there's these three great messages that are going out and uh so that's why that many times we can read a message and look at the big picture well that's why we're taking it in little short segments and just feasting on it so the scripture said he was kind of a ruddy fella and there was no beauty in him that he could be desired so very average normal looking person and he had the uh characteristics of a carpenter he worked as a carpenter and so he might have had calluses on his hands or certain muscles that a carpenter might develop from doing the kind of work and uh the stories tell us that his uh his um you know father made furniture and and things like that so he he worked in like that but one day he he attended a a feast and just there at the feast like a wedding supper you know and uh they ran out of wine and of course mary knew who he was you know so uh and he just living a normal life like everybody else coming and going i'm sure he had friends had testimonies he had uh cousins and and uh a different uh people very probably a great life of prayer and kept the law and the commandments and was you know identified as just a really good person but one day he makes changes water into wine and things begin to change and they they his mother says bring him the water and they come to me he says this my hours not yet my time's not yet and they just say do what he ask and you know and i always i always just love that great story because of she knew she could count on them and she knew she was going to ask for something and that she wanted to do it for the young couple that they wouldn't embarrass you know just that just that kind of love that she must have had and the kind of love that mary must have had in her heart just as a person that god chose her to be uh perform the works of motherhood in his life she must have had a tender hand she must have had a firm voice she must it just must have been something about mary why that she was chosen to raise this child but all of a sudden he performed a miracle and his fame began to grow and as he began to go out and he went to the synagogue and he took the book and he said he'll bind the brokenhearted he'll set the captive free he'll heal the sick and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and then one day in that same synagogue there was a man with a withered hand and and that hand came whole and and his fame began to go and grow an ordinary man he began to speak things and he began to say things and and the people began to come to him and and john who had a following pointed out and said behold the lamb of god and he gathered up the twelve his ministry began to grow and and he began to do works and signs and wonders and he began to make statements like me and my father are one destroy this temple in three days will raise it up again and he the things he began to teach the people recognized he was different than any other man he wasn't saying the same old things that there was something else he was talking about something else that he was preaching about about a kingdom that was to come about a baptism that was supposed to fall on the people that they're a reuniting with the father and the people that a removal of a law that kept the people in bondage that they could live not by the law but by grace in other words fulfill the law by grace and love not by rule or fear of punishment he began to say things that begin to stir the hearts of the people up and people can realize there's something different and he's talking about something different and they knew that he possessed something that he had something in him that separated him from everybody else even the rabbis begin and the great people begin to come to him he says master we know that no man can do these things and lest he comes from god and and the lord returns and he refers to the spirit it's a spirit it cometh it's listed as will it well and he he's pointing to something he's talking about something people are getting hungry and they're getting thirsty and and and so he he's he's making all these great statements and doing all this great work and there's a hope in man and now first of all their hope was that they thought he might be the one that unites israel and that they would all come together and they could rise up and put push the romans out of the land they had their political hopes and their political ideas and people follow them for different reasons you know the blessings maybe the possibility of being well the possibility of having bread and fishes but it finally came down to the fact that he he testified about i'll go into the grave you destroyed this temple in three days it'll raise up i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption and and so it didn't matter what that he said and what that he had spoken he still had to face the same thing that every man and every woman has to face and that was death and he said i have power to lay my life down and i have power to take it up again now there was no question about the works but he then he goes makes this statement and he jumps up and he says come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i will give you rest what a great promise i'll give you peace my peace or path understanding i'll give you joy unspeakable full of glory he began to preach these promises preach these things that he was gonna give people the things that he was going to do for him in other words he didn't have just a small idol uh theological a gospel he he was preaching things that were dynamic preaching things that that didn't didn't just stir the mind they stirred what was in people's hearts every word that he spoke began to fulfill an emptiness it began to to create a hunger after more things of god there there was really something that was moving in the people but they couldn't lay their hands on it you know they sensed it and they could they could see the power of it and they could see the freedom that it began to give them and the gospel went out to the poor he gave hope to them that it wasn't through the riches of men it wasn't through the job that you had that this come from another source it wasn't something carnal and then he died they arrested him the leaders the religious leaders of israel the the high priest and and they allow the israel to have a governor and to rule their country but but they still answered to caesar and and so they they by their own laws they accused jesus of blaspheme and doing works on the sabbath and those they accused the maker of the law of breaking the law oh the scripture said they were ignorant of who he was because if they would have known they would have never crucified the lord of glory let me tell you how wonderful and how blessed you are to have revelation because just think of the things that you would have done if you hadn't had eyes have if god didn't let you see think of the message you could have been in and the troubles that we could uh of god in but he even gave them he said they wouldn't have even done it if they would have known so we we come to this great event of the resurrection and why it's so important to us and so we read this statement he says but when this this is in paragraph 32 of the easter seal so everything that jesus talked about everything he told the people everything that he said to him it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom everything that he said was hanging in the balance and all of a sudden it says but easter proved it it sealed the word of god forever for the true believer all gloom and doubt was shattered at that blissful morning man had been shut up as it was in a prison house even to religious people before this day because they had seen great religious moves and the moving of the holy spirit and so forth so that's what they'd seen they'd seen jesus they've seen the work they've they've heard and saw other great religious events and things take place and he said and so forth but when man died it seemed to settle it so for them it was always for a season someone would rise up and it was good for a season but when that person died that settled it in other words well that's the end of that it was it was good for a time you know what i mean but it it it's it's not gonna bear fruit anymore it's like we i we have an orange tree at my mom's house that thing produces oranges like you can't believe it but every year we come back and we're always wondering is it going to keep doing it is going to keep doing it because one day you know that tree's not going to live forever and that's what happened to people it was good for a season it was good for a time that's what what every but he's that no you we got to hold this little thought this morning so before we can start moving down this great line of this great seal so he said and it just seemed to settle it but when this one came he said i have power to lay my life down and i have power to take it up again and then go prove what he said to me that's the real seal of it when something is said and then it's turned around and proven so when he rose on that day it proved that everything he was talking about was real it didn't end with him it wasn't an idea that he had it wasn't something that that that like a great philosopher or or something he wasn't a religious einstein what he said was real in other words right in front of them he said he he proved that was what sealed so what's proved or sealed what he said was on that easter morning when he rose up now and then he told them go and wait because i will send you power from unhigh i he commissioned him go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow you but wait and go into that upper room you wait there until you receive quickening power from on high until you receive the spirit the power of god in our lives and so then we read over there in paragraph 39 he said these signs he said in paragraph 39 jesus said go ye there for teaching all nations and prove to them by demonstration the power of god to them these signs shall follow them that believe so he said go to him preach the gospel to him tell them the things that i told you he said and demonstrate the power of god to them these signs shall fall then that believe them who promised and said they believed he gave us a de a definite understanding of it these signs would follow them that believe it would be the proof of their testimony now we can say we believe but until we are have the proven sign that he said would be upon us then we are just confessing to believers and not the of believers so we believe but we don't possess it now you can get into all kinds of teachings about evidences we're not interested in evidences we're talking with an individual the individual has to know that he's received something from god signs and wonders come in many different ways it's not always miracles you know i've watched people who just as cool as a cucumber had somebody just say something to in their face and and i got so mad my hairs on my back are all standing up and i'm ready to go fight their fight for them you know and yet they just stand there and they take it just just calm and and and loving and forgiving and apologize and and just say i'm sorry you know i i didn't mean to do it whatever i can do to make it right i would do it and i'm back there saying it's their fault it's their fault you know it's like someone gets in a wreck or you bump into somebody you know the first thing you know it's their fault you know and no problem and i thought wow that's really a sign that that person has something amen you know because anybody can impersonate a gift but to really have that nature of that lord and the kindness and the forgiving spirit you know we always want the mighty signs but it's the it's the little foxes that spoil the vine it's the beautiful fruits that also make the vine stand out beautiful so that character of your life is a sign and a wonder it's a wonder today someone can be a christian in the midst of all this what we're living in so don't we all so many times get when it comes to signs and wonders we we just jump up and we think that it's this power it's not the power to do signs and do wonders because there's all kinds of impersonators it's your faith that produces the miracle it's not the person you know what i mean i could quote a bible scripture to you and and and say a few words that your faith anchors in that but faith's final resting place the word of god and when you act and accept the word of god you're going to get the results it doesn't have anything to do it was your faith that you touched the hem of his garment nobody touched the hem of the garment for you you have to touch the hem of his garment that's why these signs shall follow them that believe the signs were never something that was produced that's where pentecost taught it they thought it was a ministry it was something you would go produce a sheep bears wall these signs just happen around them they don't even they just they believe and they pray and they just they're just praying for someone the lord heal my mother lord help my friend i just hate to see him suffer and your heart is is is goes out to him and you're making intercession from your spirit the holy spirit making intercession within your heart and you're just praying and you're asking god and all of a sudden it comes to pass that's right you know he didn't come to prove that god was a healer he came to prove that god kept his word and by doing those signs and doing those wonders he said if if there wasn't a message that followed that then that wasn't of god he he proved and vindicated by signs and wonders the things that he was going to share with us and the things that he was going to speak to us were true but there was a lot of people praying for the sick pentecostal people have been praying for the sick for years and years and years god's a healer our messenger didn't make god a healer but what he did do is he exposed the son of perdition he exposed the lie lies in the bondage that he had people in and he revealed us the true unadulterated word of god because he was trying to prepare a people for a rapture we're not in a religious battle with every church and with everybody if someone's a christian i i thank god they're a christian i meet a lot of pastors when i'm out eating in restaurants and someone will say this is my pastor i say oh brother i'm praying for you i i feel for you you know okay and and i'm glad i'm glad they're trying to help people instead of you know robbing the bank or something so you know this isn't about us only that's right amen amen we live for everybody we're christians the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit we respect what people believe that's what they believe praise god but if god gives a my salve that their eyes can be opened praise god for that also but so it was a great proof so now he was going to give the church something that they also would have identifying power to prove that what they were saying was true they just couldn't always point back so they didn't want they weren't going to sit there and say well except jesus christ is your lord and savior because he did this and he did that their testimony was he came and he did this and the same spirit that was in him he promised to us i will not leave you comfortless but i'll come again and i'll be with you even in you till the end so he gave us a portion of his spirit that we could do the works that he did also so now our testimony is we're identified with the word that he kept so he preached the word he sealed it by his resurrection he proved that everything that he said he turned around and proved it that was the seal of it and now what he sealed his testimony with he was going to share with you that you could seal your testimony with it you could have the same spirit that he had praise the lord i will not leave you comfortless i will come again i will be with you until the end i will lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness praise the lord that is the promise to every believer and then we realize that that that didn't just happen by circumstance or happenstance but it was absolutely by the predestinated will of god that there was a people that were planted in the earth the seeds of god were planted in the earth they were foreordained by god to receive this spirit amen else you would sit back in your logical mind and think everybody should have it why would anybody want to turn this down because they don't all see it but you see it don't let somebody talk you out of something you see i mean if you see it you see it just realize just because they can't see it that doesn't change who they are that's fine you don't see it i see it wait you know they'll just say no it doesn't exist it's not there it's not true that's fake i didn't read about it on wikipedia that's my source of all truth and knowledge you can't get this on wikipedia you can order this on amazon this is individual this is from god to you you and god god chose you god picked you and god seals you it's not you you're elected you're separated you're predestinated you you know i'd like to be like everybody else i know not too many people want to be like me but that's all right i'd like to you know i don't want to be different i want to be odd i don't like it when all of a sudden people are doing things and i can't stand it and i go why am i like this you know and then i read the other day the prophet of god's saying i'm just i get there and i say well god why did you make me like this why do i have to be this way why do i always why can't i just love everybody and everybody loved me why he's called he predestinated he's created different and that's one thing this bride has got to come to the realization to they are created differently different you got a different ear in you you've got a different heart in you you've got a different understanding in you you're different and that's why he expressed that to us in talking about the eagle in the barnyard he was a different bird that was given to us so we could understand that we were made equals to begin with and we could only hear an eagle scream and different people respond different to the voice they thought jesus was beelzebub they thought he blasphemed you blasphemed god well he's my father i only do what the father tells me to do heretic they saw this guy that couldn't stand him but a little woman at the well she said thou art the messiah the son of the living god we've got to come at peace with our election we can't be battling with our election and so we we understood that we were predestinated we were foreordained to fulfill this role there was a time he didn't put us at the day of pentecost he didn't put us at the time of justification if if if we were living in the time of justification we would have all been down at luther's meeting because we would have been the elect in the days of luther we would have been reading his edict we would have say no this isn't the literal body of blood we wouldn't be lighting candles aren't you glad that he put you in this age at the opening of the seals when there was some really good word of god how would you like to be that your revelation would just be i don't have to go into that room and confess my sins to that priest because my sins are forgiven by grace well if you were in that catholic bondage that message would have been life to you you would have been grateful for it but praise god he didn't pick you for that day he didn't pick you for the days of wesley he didn't pick you for the days of the restoration of death he picks you for this day because this day is raptured it's like anything in the great plan of god i may not be there at the time of the actual rapture but i'm a carrier of the rapture life i will carry that life and i will preach that gospel until it comes to those that are going to manifest that thing so i'm a part of it by being a carrier of it doesn't mean that that i've got to be there to be it that's not what this message is this message is to get us in rapturing condition now i'm a possessor of the rapture i'm not a believer in it i'm a possessor of it and i will carry that possession and pass that life off and pass that word off to whoever god will give me to hear it that's why you might go on but you'll leave it with your children but if i was just preaching justification that wouldn't get it there so don't worry that you're a part of the rapture being here for it doesn't mean i don't have to be here for it i know i've got it now this is what this message is about this is what we're going into 15 minutes into this morning and then he goes on and talks about our predestination and paragraph 63 he makes this statement it's the foreknowledge of god taking place god's word so we're understanding it's the foreknowledge of god taking place our position in time our position here you know i kept so many people sometimes just feel in their heart like well if i'm not here for the rapture i wasn't the bride i don't care how i get there i'm not going to die anyway you know everything they got today is pre this pre that you know my doctor found a little spot on me that's pre-cancerous you have to be checked every six weeks you know that's changing and then now every six months and now this you know i had an itch on my back i said doc i got a itch on my back he said why does the only reason it bothers me i can't reach it and some of you probably see me up against a brick wall like a dog with mange you know that thing just drives me nuts so i go there and i say you know doc i i'd like to look at that issue what do you think the first thing he does he lays me on the table and he goes gets this thing he takes two great big chunks of skin out of me i said what are you trying to do remove the itch all together no i'm making sure it's not cancer i'm not afraid of cancer you you understand i'm not afraid of death if the lord carries i may get old and wrinkled and stooped over whatever he chooses but this body is not my end so we understood and as we went through this message that it was the great uh the great thing and then he says so god in every age ordained his church for that age a message for that age and so we understand that that's what we're doing so we're just coming down looking at those things about how the seed had to be quickened and brought to life and then we came over and and he says he says notice you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection and and we understand that so we left off i believe on uh was at the end of paragraph uh 105 and so what he brought us up to this point and we're going to listen to 15 minutes so he's progressing it now okay for what that he gave us this quickening power for our age in luther's age those who got the quickening power came out of the catholic church and accepted justification and wesley's age they came out of that and they understood that they had to have they had to have holiness and be sanctified in luther's age it was eat drink and be merry because we have grace and lou there came wesley came home said no you've got to do all things in moderation and then we've come to our age we represent something else it it you know and we go through this subject matter not with just people i've talked to recently but all the years that i've been in ministry i went through this when i first became a christian with marijuana can't you just smoke in moderation you know and every excuse and thing but that's not what you go by if the spirit of god's in you it will quicken you'll find out that all things are lawful but all things aren't expedient he because you ought to remember we're not just called to obedience to a law we have a nazarite vow this this this bride has a different vowel she has a different vowel with her husband a different a nazarite vow is separating from the appearance of evil separating from the things of the world it's not it's not that i can't do this i can't do that that's not we're led by there's no more law we're not under the law but those that are under the spirit are led by the spirit and that's where that's where things begin to understand that this isn't something a religion that we're trying to fit with every other religion or every other doctrine this is an elected call this is a proposal from the bridegroom to his bride will you marry me even they asked him he said i'll not drink any more of this till i eat it with you in the kingdom now that's where our union is it's with him and so we're going to pick up here on paragraph uh 106 and he's talking to the pentecostals about about how they never went far enough but let's just listen to minutes and and and it's it's like i said it's just 15 minutes and then we'll close right up so god bless you as we're going through this message slowly the message that follows this next one we're going to go into is called the rising of the sun and then we're just going to take them all the way through 65. we're going to find out what's in that storehouse what are the things that we've read over and walked over for so many years so let's just take this 15 minutes as we advance farther and uh and so lord richly bless you this morning as our messenger speaks to us the next few minutes now but when they went up to pentecost there they received the quickening power the power that made them alive now there's where i think that your presbyterian and methodist brother you do receive potentially on believing on the lord jesus christ but the abstract hasn't come yet that's the clearing of the deed god gave abraham a promise abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the covenant by the seal of circumcision and god gives you a promise potentially yet you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him in the end time but you see you have to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance is when every thing against it has been stricken off and you got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours everything's on it belongs to you amen and when we believe on jesus christ for our savior and repented or baptized and come up to believing god recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the assurance it's a guarantee that everything was ever held against you you thoroughly repented amen hallelujah and the property is bolton and you hold the abstract for the assurance let somebody try to put you off the land say he belongs in your abstract in your hand let him try to do then along the land can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of god's proof and abstract that the baptism of the holy ghost has recognized us in jesus christ amen we're just as sure to raise us he raised because potentially we have already raised in him amen hey man the old things what does it do to our moral bodies it turns our opinions changes our notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking drinking cannon the things that you used to do it is dead it's beneath you and you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition amen already notice the pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the holy spirit listen to me when those pentecostal group up there on the day of pentecost receive their abstract deed from god surely glorify their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it's so quick in their body until they couldn't even speak an earthly language anymore it quickened their body to heavenly language the place they're going to quickening power of god shook their mortal bodies so till their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quicken in power what's something it belongs if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it shall also quicken your immortal bodies we are quickened then by the power of the living god tongues quicken to a new heavenly language to speak to them are rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than what they'd ever lived in also with the new quickening life to them that come in them it quickened their language they spoke in new tongues oh yes now watch them um it also was designed to give them as this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds every promise on the grounds of god's word that was promised in the bible that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to them therefore they laid hands on the sick they were sealed they spoke in new tongues they done great signs and wonders because that was in god's promise and when jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds that belonged to sons of god he demonstrated what god was how dare we to socialize that and put it into an organization we have no rights to do that it's the holy spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the bible that was promised is to that believer and when you accept it in its fullness and god knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that and then every promise is made is in your possession and the holy spirit starts to quicken that to you thank you oh my what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see that god's great holy spirit here to do that power think of it when the holy ghost itself you're in a bear record of this hour amen jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out what works that i do shall you do also john 14 12 these signs shall follow them that believe that is the assurance when we see a group of people sitting together in those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract desire to vindicate that that's property of god amen amen so we are easter also amen we are now in our easter we've already raised hallelujah from the things of the world to the things of god's promise amen not we will we are it's the potentials it's god's promise he'd pour out his spirit in the last days and that's what they would do notice lay their hands on the sick everything was in god's promise i shall wear out my spirit the last days upon all flesh your old man shall dream dreams your young men should see visions and all these different promises that he made everything's laying right there in god's promise jesus redeemed it to us and when we become are we if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest amen if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is sure to find you amen and when it finds it you'll recognize this call you know the hour you're living you know these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh what a promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things the spirit quickens their fellowship with god so that they call the dead back to life in that day they laid their bodies up on the dead they come to life listen closely they've done the same things that jesus did because the same spirit was upon him was upon them if one spirit makes a man act this way it makes the other neck that way if one how can this come upon say he's got the spirit of god and deny the works of god amen cannot do it notice god's life which is in the greek called zoe moving through them and in them quicken their minds to his word amen now let me say it real quietly the spirit of god that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of god see it does it look i'm trying to show you the the let you realize that i'm speaking out of the church and also quicken to life in him although uh they only or was his attributes to begin with but if god said in this day back in the beginning john doe will be my servant millions of years ago now john doe's born in sin shaped in iniquity comes the world speaking last because he's immortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll join pentecostal church don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of god once see john doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who the mother was it's got to realize it see only that john doe is god's attribute that's become a word spoken and then the holy spirit seeks that word out here it is he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of god god's word look god had the same when he saw jesus it was it was a finished work that god finished with jesus when he said it's finished all the plan was finished and when the spirit of god comes upon you and you truly are one of god's attributes that he's spoken of now if you're not you'll wander and flusterate and run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth if you are one of those the old things pass away right quick see and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that god ever spoke of you see for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of pentecost now let us notice the quickness quickening spirit on other people now i told you you wouldn't speak very long and i just got 20 minutes to keep my word if i do that notice the keeper one time i said about about an hour notice now this quickening power that only comes now there's a lot of mockery of it there's a lot of people that really think they got it when they haven't a lot of people do it because they've got some false impression of what they've seen other christians do satan can impersonate any of that we know that in his missionaries you can see it impersonated shouting dancing speaking in tongues all these things you can impersonate anywhere absolutely amongst heathens and people who deny there is a such a thing as jesus christ being the son of god see and they do all those things themselves but the real true quickening spirit that comes to believer quickens him to god's word that's back to eagle food again right back to where he lives man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god let us now notice this quickly spirit as it come up on other people like it did on on the day of pentecost let's notice pentecost how they acted and see if they were quickened by this quickening power that we're talking about on the day of pentecost they were all waiting up there in themselves they were afraid the jews what they were going to do so they got scared but what happened when this quickening power fell from heaven there was a bravery set up on them there was something an understanding worthy wasn't too sure of it a few hours before they know he had he died they know he had risen then i talked to him on the way but was that thing for them or was it just for them for jesus himself but here on the day of pentecost the holy spirit the abstract fell upon the believers that made them part of his resurrection made him part of his fellowship the holy spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised in from cowards to brave man they were they were afraid of the very word that they thought don't let this pass over you they were afraid they know that he was that word even the jews had to admit it nicodemus said rabbi we know that you're a teacher that come from god no man that could do the things you do except god be with him now we know that we recognize that so the disciples peter had even sworn in his presence all of them had forsaken him at the crucifixion but here they are now up in this upper room in the presence of god then all of a sudden here come this holy spirit down from heaven and he quickened them and the quickening took place they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed to know to be the truth otherwise they were afraid of it sitting here going wow you know uh i mean it's it's marvelous you know when you when you you think about it i just i just want to make a couple comments and then we'll visit uh this again when we come to another service uh some of the things that were in here but uh you understand when he uses the word abstract that that is proof of possession so when he says abstract he's also talking about that baptism that quickening power that thing that he sends you because he recognizes what you've done that you've repented you've heard the word you've you've said these things so now he's going to give you something that that seals you but he you when you see that that god always works in the same way and i just want to touch on this little part of it for a second is that god always gives the believer something to believe he gave abraham something to believe a promise so if it never everywhere down the line every time god's been a deal with the believers he bring gives them a promise something to believe so he gave abraham he said you're going to have a son abra him said impossible he said no come here the promise just wasn't that abraham would have a son his promise was that his lineage would be like the stars okay that every place that he set his foot it would be his possession as far as he could see so the promise that he gave abraham to believe was always something supernatural it was something that wasn't in the mainstream the uh the just the stream of of what was possible then that wouldn't require anything that would require education that would require logic that would require something that you could prove with your senses or with your reasoning so god always gives the believer something beyond reasoning to test whether that seed is in there so that seed is something that god put in you that allows you to believe something beyond reason now let me tell you something the rapture is beyond reason especially when you look in the mirror because you know everything about you everything who you are what you really think all your secret mistakes everything you're battling because satan's trying to chew on you every day you just sit back and say i can't make this he always gives something to believe when jesus came he gave them something supernatural to believe they had the belief that he was the son of god in other words his father was not living on the earth that's pretty now could you imagine if one of us popped up and said that you know but he proved his father was into this earth but god always gives the believer something to believe now we're just going to close here so he's always done that he's always given the believer something that for them to believe that separates them from everything else he puts the seed in them that they find there's something in there that believes it and and they they they don't and they don't even uh they don't even understand and that's why i love this statement so much i think it was he said this he says although they only was his attributes to begin with but if god said in this day back in the beginning john doe will be my servant right so if god said that he foreordained that so if you got to understand that seed you know we think seed we think it's like little something right but the spoken word is the original seed so the minute god said back in the beginning that john doe will be my servant that word that he spoke is the seed it's the foreknowledge that's got to come to pass it's not like you possess a little uh thing in there okay the seed is the word the seed is the predestinated foreknowledge of god coming to pass so what happened to john doe john doe god foreordained put that seed in his heart that he would hear it that he'd be his servant so now that's there and so that's working in john doe he says even though he's born to sinner and shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies because he's mortal all right but god still got his will that he spoke he says he's he's mortal he said and and he gets a little religious feeling and you'll go join church maybe join pentecostal church don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of god once see john doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as the eagle recognized who his mother was it's got to realize it see only that john doe is god's attribute that's because a word spoken and then the holy spirit seeks out that word here it is he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of god's word so he at every age he's got he's he's got the promise and he said the spirit of god comes upon you and you truly are one of god's attributes if you're not you'll wander and frost frustration run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth he said but if you are one of those the old things pass away right quick and see and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished so the promise of god he gives the promise he gives the promise for every believer to believe and then he foreordains the believer to believe it and then he sends his spirit to find that believer and to quicken that word to them so when you begin to understand he says now we can see fully our journey in life you can start looking at yourself you look at how you come it didn't matter if you were born in a family that believed it it was only my children who were born angels no they were born in sin too shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies i guarantee that they were mortal but if that promise was there for him that spirit will find them so we we as we just he he says so the believers always given something to them that that they can believe in so now he gives this quickening power so we and what i want to try to break our minds from is the quickening power only for the realm of carnal carnal manifestation okay because we've been taught so long that pentecost if we have this quickening power we should out be doing works we should outbeat the miracles we should go to the hospital and do this but now we are moving in to a different time and a different age this quickening power now is the proof and the seal that you are part of the resurrection that's what brother bam starting to talk about in this first uh a few this last eight minutes uh that we we just listened to so we we see this he says this is paragraph 116. now watch them it also was designed to give them after this abstract right after they received this holy spirit after they received this promise when did the promise come they heard the word of god they repented of their sins now he sent that to show you that he's accepted you and accepted your forgiveness don't think you won't be tempted jesus was the son of god and he was tempted in every way that we're tempted and sometimes you fall the temptation but you're quick to say abba father you're quick to after repentance and bring it under the blood he said it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds so it's designed to give you every promise so it's also designed to give you the promise of malachi 4 5 luke 37 7 30 and revelations 10 7. those are promises that god made you understand that yes sir they're just the same as the promises of healing of deliverance of all the other faiths he said it wasn't this group of promises now this is what verbatim is starting to preach to these pentecostal people it's not only this group of promises he's proved that he showed that to be true he demonstrated i've been demonstrating that to you for the last years but there's also the promise of the opening of the seals the revealing of the word the promise of the ministry of the son of man that the believer knows he's trying to take us from the looking and believing in a rapture to understanding that we possess it that that spirit's in us and it's going to perform what it was given to perform if we were in another age we would look at that that quickening power and think i've got to go out with this quickening power and spread this gospel i've got to go do these signs of wonders but that's not why the believer has to have this quickening power in our age the reason we've got to possess this in our age because it's what's going to quicken us transform us change us that's what we're looking for that power to do we're looking for that power to bring us into rapturing conditions rapturing place we're not given to vindicate it remember the spirit quickens the word the word doesn't quicken the spirit so when you come to the place well i've got to go do these kinds of wonders they're trying to make the word quicken the spirit but if you get the spirit then that spirit is here to do what it's supposed to do and what the spirit is here to do in this hour is not revive pentecost the spirit in this hour is here to take the pride out oh i hope i can make that clear somehow we get looking that's what we're looking for when we get on track with that all these other signs and wonders will follow if if you're for ordained to be in there the sister gave the testimony he didn't have time to have her give it we'll try another day that god spared her from a car accident you know praise god he does that well you you know if she's if she's elected to be a part of that the performing of that spoken word of the transformation from this earth amen no car accident going to take her so that's why so what did that spirit give them it gave them the absolute proof right so they believe every promise that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to them therefore they lay hands on the sick was healed they spoke in new tongues they done great signs and wonders because it was god's promise and when jesus died to redeem them back on the grounds that they belong sons of god he demonstrated it was god and it's the holy spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the bible that was promised to the believer and you accept it in its fullness and god knows that you will do it all the promise so it it we we don't want to get so narrow on our thinking of this quickening power and this quickening power only has one purpose and that is to get me to produce signs and wonders the quickening power is going to get you to believe the promise of your day abraham believed he was going to have a son by the quickening power the disciples believed that jesus was was the messiah the son of the living god who do you say that i am thou art the son of the living god flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you my father which in heaven has quickened that to you and that's what i found that the enemy does all the time he changes the definition of a word he puts power to mean miracles he he is quickening him he that becomes a sensation it he takes the believer and he tries to get him out on the goose chase for them to try to to manufacture something so if we thought a good meeting was just some real excitement and shouting then we would have to do the things that would produce that well we're i don't care who would me i love you want to shout i love shouting i've shouted myself i love praising god i love worshiping god but the understanding of that quickening power in the hour that we live in is for that we know because we have this promise because we've had this quickening power that we are going to be translated we understand what it's what it's given uh to us for we're ordained to this ground he gave you the power of that quickening he says though you haven't been changed yet you possess it by receiving the abstract so in our hour when we receive what they in that day called the baptism of the holy spirit to go out and prove their testimony that that was given to them that power in our day is giving to us to prove that the rapture is true you may never do a miracle though you believe in them but that's not the miracle you want to be a part of because how many people do you think prophet of god prayed for that we're well how many of you you think are still living that's not what we want to possess we want to know when those disciples went into the grave because every single one of them went into the grave but they went into the grave knowing that they possessed something that would take them out so so now that's what the the challenge of this hour is to believe the promise that god's made to believe that there's a rapture fixing to happen all the signs of the world are getting close like i said i may not be here when it happens i'm not worried about that because i can know now that i possess that resurrection already in me and it will finish its work it'll take it out it'll go but it's a very real possibility that some of you could be here when something that's unthinkable takes place people coming up missing so i'm not worried about the grave now you might not think that i'm 72 years old if god gave me what 15 more years what would i be 87 when you look at me and say i only got 15 more years maybe 20. i know old king lived forever that ain't gonna happen do you think right now that i'm worried about doing signs and wonders you can't even tell which is real and which is faked anymore not what i'm worried about it's not what i want to know make sure that i have i want to know that that quickening power the thing that can take me out of the grave i want i just don't want to believe it but i want to possess it so when he sends you the abstract in this day that spirit he's not sending it to you just for you to do works you're in the hour of the rapture we're in the end time we're at the hour of the resurrection we're at the hour of the end of the world we're at the hour of the taking up of the church that's what i want to know and be assured that i'm a part of beyond a shadow of a doubt i just don't want to know i have a spirit and i have the gifts working in me i just don't want to know that i'm living a good life and then i'm i'm i'm doing the things that he said for me to do and not answer the main question i want to know am i coming out of the grave or if the if the lord comes in my time i'm going i want to know i possess it i want to know it's sure i want to know it's over i want to know my slate has been wiped clean that he's accepted my faith and he's given to me this quickening power i want the power to quicken in me the faith and the revelation that i'm part of this this is my ground i'm on rapturing ground and then we we know that without peaking that for the individual you also know that the prophet of god was showing this is the word of god by discerning it by his ministry and said how can you know this and then deny the word of god when it's coming to pass right in front of you he wanted them to examine what that quickening power really does that quickening power opens your eyes and gives you eye sav that you can see it clothes you and white raymond it gives you gold tried in fire so this is why i say this quickening power in our day wasn't given to resurrect pentecost it was given so the believer knows every promise in the book is his even the promise of the rapture and we've as christians have always pushed the rapture down the road as being something that someday inevitably will happen and if i'm a part of it i'll be there and it doesn't matter whether or die and that's right it don't matter whether i die or i'm alive if i know that he's here and that's what i'm a part of and he sealed it wouldn't you want that question totally finished in your life i wonder how it would really make you change if you knew you possessed the rapture and you knew no grave could hold your body down how it would make you act towards other people okay remember he says well what what it ought to do to us it's just the change that assurance and and the only reason i say this is your pastor in closing this morning is because a lot of times we don't approach it that way it's always it'll happen if it happens you know and the thing about it is no it's happening how is it happening it's happening in abstract form he's giving the rapture i just don't have a better word in my vocabulary he's giving the rapture away now he's handing out the rapture in this day by the message of the hour he's handing out the rapture here's the quickening rapture here's the quickening rapture here's the quickening rapture the son of man came to give rapture to the elect seed he's given him rapture now he's given him the possession you say i don't see the rapture you have the rapture it's in you in abstract form it's in you in the deed if he gave you the deed and he gave you it then you are the possessor not the believer but the possessor of it this message has come so the bride can possess the rapture and know they possess it and know it's answered and know i'm going. and then if you have to sing in the sweet bye and buy over my box i don't know they might make it an urn i don't care i've got one waiting for me it don't matter it's settled i already know i already know i possess i have in my possession the rapture this message came to deliver the rapture to the bride i've got it if i got an abstract d on a piece of property i may have never seen that property but i know it's mine nobody can take it away from me nothing i have it because i have the paperwork i have the survey i have the record it's recorded it on the books that it's mine and that's the way it is with the rapture it's recorded on the lamb's book of life it's mine he gave me the seal of it the proof of it by giving me the quickening power by pivoting him my spirit now i know i possess the resurrection i've already resurrected and i'm sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh i just think that we could it is not get so caught up in the carnal manifestation and understand what it is that he's given us and what it is that this message brought us and what the peace of it is praise god i have been delivered to me by the ministry of the son of man the rapture [Music] are you going in the rapture because i got it here i'd like to maybe play that video of gary's son one day saying going in the rapture i'm going in the rapture hallelujah i'm going in the rapture i'm going to meet him in the air how do you know i got it i've got the abstract i've got it i've got the resurrection life he sealed me in oh and i'd just like to go over that what we've read again on another sunday but anyway god bless you tonight some of you watched fireworks last night i can tell because you're all starry-eyed and that's great and then some of you will watch them tonight some of you watch them both night enjoy the rest of the day with your family it's noon now and and just have a wonderful fourth of july uh communion will be next sunday instead of this sunday and then we'll have a prayer and then i i'd like also to make a request to you all those that are maybe streaming or listening to the service but i would like our congregation as a congregation to make a special effort to put sister karen pruitt in our prayers and i've known karen for a long time and and she speaks more word with her life than i've seen a lot of preachers do over the pulpits for years she's just a rock she's steady she's kind and it just breaks my heart that she's going through such a hard time and i know that prayer makes a difference and i know that we pray but i thought maybe if our whole congregation would just make intercession on her behalf you know and she's just a lovely christian and and got uh you know grandchildren and children and everything and you you know that some of these things they can't figure out but there's nothing that gets by the great physician i know we have local needs too and different people that are going through things in our church but i don't know i just to be honest with you i think karen's lived a life that deserves our prayer so i'd like you our name's karen pruitt she's brother tim pruitt's wife a pastor in louisiana but i think that maybe all of us here could pray you young people say your prayers just remember her name the lord knows who she is the lord knows what satan's trying to do to her he's not pulling the wool over our lord's eyes we don't know but the one thing we do have is we have prayer and we can pray and we can ask the lord to touch her and i think if we would join in with those that are already praying as our whole church just praying for her and asking god to really give her a deliverance and a touch that i believe we can see the hand of god i'd like to put my shoulder to the wheel not mine personally i'd like to put our whole church pushing on the wheel to see if we can help through prayer bring her to the hour of her deliverance and the lord would do something for so that's a request that i have on my heart to ask you to join me in i pray that you would maybe make a note on uh your ipad or your phone or everything i used to make mental notes but that pad is getting wore out so just which would you do that i i believe it'll be a blessing to her and then that's what we trust so lord richly bless you let's stand together this morning musicians would come billy's away preaching in baton rouge this morning and a lot of the brothers are away but we're glad you're here this morning and we trust that the lord bless you um and um we know that god will be gracious to us so let's bow our heads this morning a gracious heavenly father lord i raised the great question this morning asking each believer do they have that blessed assurance that they possess the rapture that it's not something that's going to happen down the road like an event on the calendar it's not rapturing day or lord but for us it's a condition the prophet of god said that you're getting in rapturing condition very word he used lord it's a place where it's settled that this quickening power that was poured out on the day of pentecost [Music] that came through the ages seeking out the believers that took the believer's bride in the day of luther and brought him to justification took the bride in the days of wesley and brought him to sanctification father when the restoration of the gifts came and the believers received your spirit they began to walk in those promises speaking in tongues and laying their hands on the sick but lord we realize now that that life has come to the hour of rapture and father that's what our desire is when we see the son of man standing there in our day imparting resurrection to that seed whose name was written on the lamb's book of life father that's what i want to know that i have and i possess i want to honestly able to say deep in my soul the lord's given me that and i hold it dear in my heart and there i have no fear of grave i have no fear of sickness i have no fear of poverty i'm not walking in fear because i'm walking in the newness of life [Music] because i have in my hand and i have in my heart that eternal presence of the mighty lord just ask you to bless the people today in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen i know we're just gonna uh dismiss with this song this morning if you want to stay in prayer a little bit but we'll just uh dismiss well i know i should probably worship a little bit but i just feel led to just let us go and enjoy our day and uh it's nice having the eskies with us today and enjoyed eating fish with you the other day and daniel had a birthday and and uh so we ate some fish together so yeah i appreciate that so god bless you this morning let's sing this as you are dismissed this morning oh bless us [Music] oh [Music] oh god [Music]
