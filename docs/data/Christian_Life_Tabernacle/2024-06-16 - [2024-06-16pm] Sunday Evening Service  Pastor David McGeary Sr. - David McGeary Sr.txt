Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
June 16, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

them that come out to the house of the Lord amen we have a lot of surprises coming up for us uh we're going to get our oven in and the Lord's blessed us with a baker amen and so we're going to have uh all kinds of goodies for those that come to evening service so you know you got to believe that the Lord is a rewarder of them that diligently see him amen so uh anyway but anyway yes uh uh by Yahweh I learned that word I don't know what it means but it sure sounds good you know I could do that bye you know does it have an interpretation oh Jehovah ah I believe that amen is that SW huh oh man I've got a lot to learn I wonder how many languages we speak here if we have many Lang languages many countries but by one faith and one baptism amen amen so uh we just want to continue just a little on our Father's Day message it won't be long let's turn to Romans uh 416 and then we'll go to Galatians uh three and uh and so right do Romans 4:16 and then Galatians 3 just a couple short Scriptures it says in Galatians I mean in Romans 4:16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not that only which is of the law but that which also is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all amen what a great scripture and then Galatians 3 we want to read this there in Galatians uh 3 and 16 it says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to the seed as of many but as of one and to that thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 400 years 30 years after cannot be thus anold that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise amen we ask Heavenly Father we ask to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated you know I I I've firmly have in my heart just been uh it just seems like going back over the uh the Simplicity and the fundamentals of the message and what it is that we uh really are built on and I I one of of the things that I think many times it just seems to slip away from us is that Malachi 45 was to come and restore back the Faith of Our Fathers to our children and when we talk about the father uh uh of faith we talk about Abraham who is the the the father of us all the father of faith and you could hardly preach Father's day without preaching about Father Abraham you know and what that it was and what that it meant and I like what Paul was saying here he says you know it was given by promise and not by the law not by the rules and and not by what was kept but by faith and we know the scripture tells us without faith it's impossible to please God and and so the the the faith of Abraham is uh a kind of a different type of faith if I could say it that way way and uh and that's the faith that we want to have we want to have the type of faith that Abraham had and and and because that's the kind of faith that is going to cause us to become what it is that we can become and uh the only way that we'll ever reach our potential as Christians is by faith and and so when you look at Abraham and you think about Abraham you know the faith of Abraham was uh it was a h the faith that a nation was born out of and a people was born out of it the because of what Abraham uh believed and the faith that he had a whole nation came out of it and and out of that Nation came our Savior and out of our savior came the Gentile church and therefore Abraham's considered the father of us all if it wasn't for the faith of Abraham we would have never achieved that which uh was achieved and and so the IT thing is not so much to uh look at uh Abraham maybe as a man uh I didn't know Abraham as a man uh I I you know always have an idea what the personality of Abraham might be or who he might be like or what type of nature he might have had what was his dislikes and and likes you know did he like to eat did he like to exercise was he a hiker you know what I mean uh was he a businessman uh we know he must have been some form of businessman he was blessed of the Lord uh you know so you know or maybe he was uh kind of maybe what we would call a nerdy type uh I guess that's a okay go all right and uh you know or something like that or or uh you know maybe an intellect I I believe that Paul was intellectual you know what I mean he was smart he studied under Gia okay you know he I'm sure he had a wit and so we I don't know him by uh his personality but I am going to know him I'm going to meet Abraham someday and and just think I'm going to have time to sit down with them and and and and wonder you know uh just have fellowship with them and have them tell me the challenges he went through and what it was like and how God saw him through it all and and how he made it and uh and just tell him he says Abraham uh you were considered to us the Gentiles as the father of our faith and from you all Faith came uh the promise came even the promise of the son of our savior came through the promise that God gave you it was that your faith that started uh if we use that expression the ball rolling it started the program uh and and and and I wanted to look at that faith that Abraham had uh really uh and and this is the faith that I believe that God is wanting us to have we talked this morning about him being our father the Our God our Father and the relationship that God wants us to have with him as a father we he wants us to feel like his children he wants us to act like his children he wants us to feel like we can approach him like his children he wants us to know that he loves us like his children and not like but that we are his children that we're the reason that he's here he predestinated us he put something in us to hear his word he he called our lives to to come to him and and so he he doesn't want to be worshiped a far off but and he doesn't want to be worshiped as as a God that's someplace that he can't be known but he wants us to know him and he wants us to love him for what that he is he's put his attributes on display so that we can know what kind of God he is we've seen it in the works that Jesus did all the works that Jesus did he said I didn't do these things of myself I did them because the father showed me to do them because and then he looked at Philip and he says Philip have I been so long with you and you know not who I am he who ha seen me has seen the father all I've been displaying to you was the Father's love God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son so we we see that that's what he was establishing he was establishing uh the understanding that we could approach him and have the love affair with him and the relationship with him above a religious relationship or something that would be considered uh you know through a form of worship that he wanted it to be personal real personal really set in your heart that you're not alone amen I won't leave you I won't forsake you I'll be there for you I'll be there with you he want us to understand that we've got a a a Jehovah gy we've got a provider aen that he want us to feel that warmth and that comfort and that satisfaction that my daddy's not far away you know I have my father my father's looking over at me and and and if I Stray his loving hand will will reach out and keep me me and the F so he wants us to have that kind of of relationship with him and so and in that relationship he wants us to have faith in him and confidence in him and that was the faith that Abraham had Abraham had confidence in God and and and that Faith was imputed to him as righteousness that's in another words that's what made Abraham what he was is because he believed God and so we look a little bit at Abraham and the faith of Abraham so God wants us to have the relationship with him as a father and now he wants us to have the kind of faith that Abraham had so he wants us to have that love affair and then within that love affair he wants us to have faith yeah that all things are possible that's what pleases God that go God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that without th this Faith it's impossible to please God so if you want to please your father right this is Father's Day you know you give uh you give your your dad uh you know soap and stuff like that and deodorant and then he wonders if he smells all the time you know it by the time you're done with Father's Day you have a complex you know but uh uh but so you know that's how it is and you get socks and and things you know and it's really great and and all that and but uh the but you'd want them to have confidence that they they love you that you're there for them you know and you appr appreciate those things but it we this is so much deeper with God and and I honestly in my heart I really feel that God's Desiring his children to step up to rise in places that they've been maybe afraid to go amen and and this is the faith of Abraham Abraham's Faith was in the impossible he believed the Imp possible now that's the kind of faith that he wants us to have he wants us to have a faith that can believe the impossible and and the faith that that our Human Nature has if I could say it that way uh because I don't want to say you or me or or that but I I would say that the majority of people's Faith isn't a real genuine faith that something impossible Could Happen most of the time our faith stays within reason that's right you know within reason in other words something that we believe that uh it it's a goal that is seemingly reachable you know we can believe for it because we could understand how that it could come to pass or or or you know the we can see the possibilities of it a uh coming to pass so we could kind of look at it you know or maybe we could almost figure out how it could happen you know if if this happened and that happened and all these things happened and and the circumstances I I can believe that because I can comprehend it but the faith of Abraham was beyond comprehension it was beyond the comprehendable in fact it was in the impossible it didn't have anything to do with reasoning in fact it was unreasonable he was asked to believe something that was absolutely ludicrous you know you're kidding me no way yeah God told me oh no way God wouldn't tell you something like that that's craziness well he could have said well you know me and Sarah we talked to this uh herbal herbalist down there at the herb shop and he's got some Cactus mix that he put together and some hoba beans you know and uh uh why they got drinks today that's going to grow hair on my head it's going to straighten my skin out you know what I mean it's going to turn me into a young man again you know just for $49.95 you know three easy payments you know what I mean and and man I'm going to be young again you know what I mean why wait wait a minute I mean you going to believe in the Rapture you're going to believe in the change of the body oh that's nothing you don't need that you need a sports drink and they got them they got everything you got I heard one the other day it'll fix my heart it'll fix my my stomach it it it it it'll fix every about me and all you got to do is put this stuff in a glass of water and drink it now if you believe that I have something to sell you I mean you you know uh it just uh all this stuff well sure it's going to help I'm sure it helps you know what I mean if it helps to think that you're helping yourself you you know what I mean the psychology of it's great but Abraham wasn't asked to believe something that's within reach you know I always love those things they say take this with diet and exercise well I don't want something that requires diet and exercise I want something that I can eat and it's going to cause me to lose weight and I prefer it tastes good you know what I mean but they say oh take this with diet exercise you can lose well I can lose a diet with that that's my problem I I don't dieet and I don't exercise you know so it it that's that's not what where Abraham was at he wasn't looking for a way he could figure it out he wasn't looking for a gimmick he wasn't looking for some way it could happen he was looking for God to do it if it was going to be done it was going to be done by God that God was able to perform that which he promised that was the faith of Abraham it was a faith in the impossible impossible now God's trying to tell us I'm your father believe the impossible I'm here for you I'm with you I made you I put your faith within you faith is a gift of God the any man should boast I've given you Revelation but I don't want you to keep it in the Realms of Reason think of it not even in the Realms of reason he want you he wants your faith to to soar you know what what people think could never happen all things are possible with God is there anything too hard for the Lord I like Gaza he looked out there and he said oh master we're in big trouble the armies of the King has surrounded us and Elijah look at he says son don't worry there's more with us than there is with them open this boy's eyes that he can see you know wouldn't it be wonderful if we could start having our eyes open that our relationship with our father the love that our father has for us and the love that we have for him when we recognize who our father is he's the maker and creator of all Heaven and Earth he can do all things that through through him all things are possible through Christ Jesus who was God in flesh living among Stu to become tangible that we might be able to handle him touch him understand what he's capable of doing raise the dead turn fishes into a multitudes of baskets have done all these things before us that what that we might believe that all things are possible that's right not possible things but all impossible things are possible that we could we could start forging in faith and testifying in faith this can happen and when someone say how well I've only got one thing everything came by promise and he said so Abraham's only reasoning was God said so that's right that was all he had but that's all he needed that's all we need all we need as God said so God said by stripes are are healed I don't care what the sickness is it didn't say this heals this sickness and that sickness and this sickness it just said by stripes we are healed end the program I got stage five so what it's impossible Florence night Andale was impossible that's right amen there's a lot of them that were impossible Georgie Carter was impossible when Ronnie sheer first came to the message the first thing he did he got on the phone he called up and got a hold of Georgie Carter talk to her I don't know if she believes this message but she knows one thing she got prayed for and she got well because God deals in the impossible how can you set yourself apart if everything that you do is common I mean God uses medicine and we KN know he's the only healer but when man has gone all the farther he can go praise God he's the same yesterday today and forever so that's the kind of faith that Abraham had it was a a it was an impossible faith and God's wanting us to come to the place where we can start believing The Impossible yes I don't possibly see how this guy could ever get saved I don't possibly see it it it if I don't Poss just can't even see my parents getting converted I I I just can't even believe that my my teacher would even consider listening to the message why we've got more builtin unbelief then we've got belief we we we've we've got mental walls set up we've got situations that we we know the situations in which God can work but in other situations we don't know how he could work we don't need to know how he works we just need to know he does work Abraham never asked how he just said God is able and the impos he believed The Impossible and the impossible happened I remember the first time that I heard brother brandom explain how that Abraham and Sarah had that child and to me when I read it it was sitting right there in the scriptures all the time everybody should have came to that conclusion right Sarah and Abraham take off to another kingdom and this King Falls madly in love with a 90y old woman that that she was so fair that Abraham said you better lie and tell him you're my sister else he'll kill me and I just pictured it here [Music] SAR what did the king say no The Impossible happened the impossible is laying right there but what we need is we need isab that we can see we need isab we need to let the word of God become isabs to our eyes so we can sit back and we can believe the Imp possible that father this situation is beyond reason but I still believe you can do something fantastic because you're a God of the impossible that was the faith that Abraham had and that's the faith that Abraham fathered he didn't father religious faith faith in the doctrine faith in a teaching he he didn't he didn't even have a law so that wasn't the kind of faith faith today now is is our catechism we believe in in water baptism we believe in in these things and and all these things we'll do but let us move on to Perfection let us move to that place where we stand up as children and we believe my God can do all things and then I see a need I see that someone needs the impossible in their life they need the impossible yes you understand they they're in a they're in a situation that it it there's no hope for them outside of the hope of Faith or if I could say this the evidence of faith faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen so you see the hope there you you you know there's hope they're hopeless but you know there's hope why do you know there's hope because you've got a father and you know he can do all things he can deliver from drugs he can deliver from alcohol he he can he can deliver finances he can change the situation he can bring someone to Christ he there's nothing that he can't do and he's got a people there that are believing in the impossible brother McGary that's impossible oh great yes I'm tired to believeing for things I can do we don't ask for faith we ask for strength we don't want to do the things that we can do because we're too lazy oh I shouldn't have said that scratch that but just think of the faith that abraam had and now that's the faith that Abraham fathered so all this other faith is religious Faith you know lighting a candle to a saint you know saying to Hell Mary and just think that somewhere along the line she'll intercede you know and then no matter what happens we attribute it wait a minute God works in the Supernatural you know you you you plant a seed you expect that seed to grow a tree because the power of transformation is that seed I don't plant a a seed and then have a plant come up and go praise God it's a miracle I had a miracle the other day I went to plant shed and I bought some seed and I planted them and they grew it's a miracle well yeah but that's fine anybody that plants the seed should have the miracle cu the miracle God put in the seed but now there's things that are totally impossible you looked at somebody I I believe if you really had met me before my conver iion you would say this is Lucifer and it's impossible for this guy to be saved he's blasphemed he's he's off of the book there there there's no way God wouldn't make a mistake of saving this fell but he did and I'm glad he did and was it impossible yeah and that's why I believe in my heart to this day that I don't believe there's a man that I can meet that God can't save I don't believe there's a dark place in my eyes yes sir that I won't try to tell them about the Lord or tell them that there's hope and their salvation there there's nobody that I want to to judge unworthy or judge my father unable and so many times we carry things and and we don't believe things and really what we're saying is God you're not able to take my guilt away you're not able to forgive the sins that I have you're not able to make right the wrongs that I've done and our lack of faith is really a lack in in God's ability and that's really what we're testifying to Abraham's whole testimony was that God was able yes God is able I don't care God's able he's able to do the blind eyes he's able to take cancer he's able to raise the Dead He's Able my God is able there's nothing he can't do all things are possible he wants a church he wants a family he wants Sons and Daughters to have impossible f that's what his desire is impossible faith not reason I thought of that saying I've heard it lately think outside the box I just thought you know that's always how Satan Works he knows where God's going and he put some sort of duplication out there somewhere some worldly parallel some catchphrase you know uh just do it you know think outside the about all those things are what God's trying to get his children to do Satan's actually using God's program perverting it to put his children in bondage where God's doing it to set his children free free from the world free from Every Chain the world can put on you free from every spirit the world can put on you free from every mental disease any physical disease anything this lousy world that we live in can put on you our God is able to rise us above it that's the faith that he wants his sons and daughters to have is the faith in the impossible the faith in the unreasonable the faith that can't be figured out a faith that has no program it just is still and knows that God said so God told me in his word by promise that it's possible and I that's all I got to believe I'm believing for the impossible and I just believe it's such a beautiful thing you could talk about all the people Warriors of Faith Moses defeated a whole civilization with a stick I like that story I like the story of Moses because he had to overcome a lot of obstacles I mean just from the beginning he might have walked in there pretty strong you know set my people free I just talked to God in the bush well that didn't Shake Pharaoh they had a God on every corner oh your God is in a burning bush good we got that we got a god of the sun we got a god of the Moon we got a god of the Stars we got a god of the river you know what's one more God Paul even went up there he says oh I seen you got a statue to the unknown god well that's just the God I know and he did The Impossible he converted men with the gospel and so Moses goes there I just love the story so much and he he goes down there and takes over a whole complete civilization I mean it's it's a way of thinking a way of magic a way of medicine a way of Science and when you really think what Moses did it would have been totally impossible for just somebody to show up on the scene who they all figured out was mad banished through the desert and came back a lunatic so much a lunatic that even his brothers and sisters rejected him throws the stick down Cheap Trick they throw their sticks down you know and he he goes and and when you read the story I I it's it's a wonderful Bible reading it's just a wonderful story but then he turns the river into blood and the Here Comes his guys ah just a cheap trick you know then he calls flies you know and and uh no after the the after the blood was frogs they had frogs in their cabinets don't you all love frogs frogs in your bed frogs in your pillow frogs in your shoes frogs in your soup frogs in your cupboard every where you look frogs frogs frogs frogs then after that they had flies and then after flies all their cattle died then I believe somewhere they had fleas and then they had boils and then after all the boils they had hail and after the hail they had Locust one thing after another their heart was hard their heart was hard it seemed impossible that they was ever going to be let go it seemed impossible just think of it you know I think that if that happened to me I think that I might say okay I get it go ahead no God hardened his heart that his power might be known seemingly impossible but Moses just kept standing there believing The Impossible and finally we know the story the death angel came through and really when you think about it if I could just say it in a little form of a type the death angel killed the unbelief and that's what we need the Promises of God to do is to kill the unbelief to kill the reasoning why why do we want to go beyond reasoning why do we want to go uh uh out of the Realms of reason because reason is what got us in the condition that we're in and you could just go on to the others David fighting Goliath and G Gideon taking 300 and and and Daniel facing lions and and and staying true to the word that Hebrews says by faith they subdued kingdoms you you know what I mean they did what was seemingly impossible and I believe that God with is trying to uh take us to the place that that will'll rise up that our hearts will become steadfast and that we'll look Beyond reasoning beyond the way that it could be done that we're not a offering God's programs God if you'll do this and you'll do that then I believe that I can do this and I can do that no I need a miracle Lord I need to do something I've been praying for years and years and years and i' I've I've done everything that I could and I'll continue to do all that I can do but I need the impossible I'm called to believe the impossible and I just trust that as Sons and Daughters of God you know that your father specializes in the impossible he specializes in the impossible I man a lady not too long ago sick and and you know probably one of the greatest sicknesses we have today is cancer and I just tried to tell her in the way that I could there is a voice today and this voice has a gift to impart Faith to a Believer now you have your own faith and I appreciate that but the faith that you have isn't strong enough to overcome this life but God sent a gift amen he he he sent one that can restore the faith of Abraham to The Impossible and I just said if you just sit down and listen I believe that there's something in you that that Faith voice will strike that Faith seed and that impossible faith will rise up within you but doesn't that seem for someone that reads the Bible and goes to church and and and is faithful in their religion doesn't it seem foolish that listening to a voice could impart faith that could heal you seems impossible but I know it's true I know it's true if you would just listen sit down listen this gift this prophetic gift has the ability to restore Faith impossible Faith the faith of Abraham they don't have to quote unquote believe the message The Way We believe the message and see it I'm telling you faith an anointing is on it it will work cuz God said so he said he would restore the faith I don't know if they can hear me you know I'm just a short bald preacher you know what I mean but I know it's life and life more abundant and I want to say to you this evening Sons and Daughters of God God sent you something to give you impossible Faith thank you Lord he he sent you a Ministry he sent you a voice he sent you a sign he said all that he could do the most fantastic Miracles and everything for one purpose that you would know that he's your father that all things are possible and that he specializes in the impossible I just pray that our whole body of Believers can rise up in the arms of Faith let's believe for the impossible not the reasonable but the impossible amen God bless you we've got a little bit of ice cream and there's
