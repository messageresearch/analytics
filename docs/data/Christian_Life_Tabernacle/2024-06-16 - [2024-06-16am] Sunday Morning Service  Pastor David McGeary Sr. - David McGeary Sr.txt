I don't know yeah there it is right up there great so you got it all right let's stand this morning and um I'd like to read a couple scriptures this morning um and uh we'll we'll make references to other scriptures but um our first scripture is found in uh 2 Corinthians and the fifth chapter and the 18th and 20th verse I like the 17th verse so we have to read that one too of course you know how I am I I just keep backing up and then we'll get to Genesis one and it says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them but hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray in you Christ dead be ye reconciled to God Amen and let's turn over to Colossians the first uh chapter of Colossians and uh and the 20th verse 1 and 20 in Colossians and it says and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven our heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated this morning um I got up this morning and this thought just came to me this morning and I I really didn't have time to maybe sit down and put it into a uh a form of a sermon uh if I could say it that way uh I got up this morning I don't know probably somewhere around 5:00 and I just felt to take this uh message uh in his presence and I so I I went out and and sat on the couch and turn on the lamp and I started reading about his presence and uh you know it's a it's a it's a lovely book of course I I've never heard a sermon that wasn't lovely that didn't have something in it that uh dealt with my heart uh uh it just seems like God's word has a way of speaking to you no matter from what way that it comes from what direction it comes in it it just it is just something about it and so uh uh brother Bram was talking about the presence of God and and uh how powerful it is he he talked about men that were in uh under the anointing and and the effect of the presence of God and he talked about finny and how finny was a a an evangelist and and and uh finny went uh was uh preaching and he had a Revival that was do and so he'd been in great prayer uh for the Revival and he was speaking in an auditorium and it didn't even have uh microphones or uh Acoustics so he was there to uh test the Acoustics to uh maybe feel the rebound or how that the sound would go with and so he' been in much prayer so he just slipped up without anybody knowing to the microphone and he said uh repent or perish and the anointing was so strong on him that there was a worker that was up in the uh uh balcony that when he heard that the the presence of the Lord was so strong that he got down and he he got on his knees right there on the spot because of the presence of the Lord and he he he talked about even in his own meetings and and I I've talked with people that were in brother Ram's meetings and and of all the the things that they would tell me a lot of these men didn't receive his message the way that we've received it and understanding that it was a word that was delivered to a bride they just look at them as as maybe another Ministry or uh or as a a prophet but not in the sense that we would feel that he was a prophet to the age with a message to an elect people but they all spoke one thing in common and it was that that there was a uh when he when he was about uh uh his life and uh uh even when he was preaching that there was a strong presence of the Lord with him that that in his meetings the presence of the Lord would come down so strong that people would actually get out of the prayer line and go to the altar before that they would come into that presence and the present was so strong that there would be no uh no secret of any heart was withheld that all things were exposed in the presence of God and he was talking about the power of the presence of God and and and how that things change in the presence of God once that you come into His presence you never leave the same and we know that and we would always hope that when you come into the presence of God that you would leave better that it would draw you to be ever more closer to him that you would realize that there's another being there's another uh life there's something Beyond this present world that we live in and that there's a a power somewhere that's holding all this together you know the the very fact that people think some star bumped into another star and created creation is is is I uh I find it foolish you know there there had to be somebody that could orchestrate it in fact Paul says that this way he says the invisible things of God are clearly seen in the visible things around us for nature itself itself speaks of his glory the first Bible was written in the stars and the sky in all creation I I don't know how a person can wake up in the morning and have the breath of life and realize that this life is that we have is is not a a plant life or an animal life but it it's it's a life that that has to come from somewhere you know it it it couldn't come from a lower form you know what I mean it had to come from above this if it it had to be something above what we are even for us to be what we are and so the great uh presence of God is uh uh something that uh just he began to talk about and I I began to sit there and think and then he began to speak about about uh the Great Men of the Bible Moses and uh uh uh Abraham and John and and the effect uh when they came into the the presence of the Lord that John fell as he was dead and and mo Abraham bowed down before the Lord and and we know Moses he he trembled and feared and that he came into the presence of the burning bush and all down through ages people that come into the presence of God uh were uh if I could say this numbed uh I wouldn't even imagine I I I know that I felt the presence of the Lord the anointing of the Lord and by the goodness of God and that's sort of what I began to think about you know I maybe not in the way that John did or these men uh felt but I I was grateful that I know there's a Lord and I I I I I can feel his presence aren't you glad you can feel the presence of the Lord do don't you know that when he comes around and you can sense that presence that that's a time to become reverent it's a time to be respectful okay it doesn't matter who's there but when you know he's there he becomes the uh the guest of honor he becomes the focus of our attention he's the most important thing that there is when he's there he is it he's what he's what we live for if is that presence and and if if you've been through dry spells and you've been through times of trial and Times of struggle you know what a refreshing season it is when that wind of the Holy Spirit blows by you and you just feel that Grace and that peace come around you and and you're thankful and if you're outside of that presence and you're maybe not living right well you know when that presence comes many times it brings conviction or or or it makes you feel uh I don't know the vocabulary to express it but you just kind of feel a conviction you you you you sense something hey I'm not right I uh CU there's something here and I I I always say it like this sometimes it just feels like you're totally exposed you know I've sat in services and the word of God's went out and convicting my heart and correcting me and and I just would sit there and think that everybody in that building is looking right at me every eye on that building's on me everybody in there knows he's talking about me uh you know you just feel like you're just put right up on the screen and the they say say they're sinner you know and and uh uh and it's it shakes you down to the core but afterwards you're so thankful because there's a peace that comes when you're able to go make things right and and I think it's beautiful to know that if God before you who can be against you and as as we just was uh uh just listening to the prophet and reading and and thinking about this great presence I just begin to uh just think about the fact that that here it was these men of old they looked far off to God and and there was a a fear that they had of God I mean they they were they were if I could say this they they lived lives that they didn't want to offend God in any way and they they fear the wrath of God that God at any time would turn his wrath towards them they pleaded in their prayers Lord let not your wrath fall upon me Lord let me please you that that I find favor in your sight they it it meant something to them to uh uh have favor with God and be right in the sight of God because they felt there was consequence es if if they weren't you know it's hard to believe that we live in a society now of no consequence you can go into a store you can steal something no consequence uh you can uh you know people run red lights now because uh they feel if they don't get in the wreck there's no consequence there's there's no fear of punishment there's no there's no fear of of any retaliation or anything that would come it it just kind of things have just kind of got away but as I read and listened to him I thought he talking about that Old Testament those those people uh walked uh uh in timidness you know wanting to keep the law because the the by the law that they they knew that this law is what kept them from displeasing God and and they were under that burden you know what a what a relationship I just thought of of the relationship that they had with God how that that you walked you know and you made sure that you washed your pants just right and you dressed just right and you did this just right you just wanted to make sure that that you didn't offend him in any way and nowadays people just take his name in vain they just spew it out of their mouth with no regard at all okay they they speak the name of the Lord Jesus in every slate and every way they use it as exent Mas and and everything and you just see that there's such a distance uh from any realization that there even is a God and the scripture tells us and they wrote to us he says no longer wishing to retain God and their knowledge that God gave them over to a reprobate mind and we see the reprobation in our country today because our country turned away from keeping God we used to be one nation under God and now they want to take it off the money they took prayer out of the school they take Bible reading they don't let Bibles in their Library uh you know uh that they they they call they want diversity well there's no diversity with God there's no variance in God you know God's the same and he's still the creator of Heaven and Earth and the scripture even tells us that they begin to worship the creature more than the Creator so the consciousness of God has just uh slipped away from man they're not conscious of them they're not conscious that he's got requirements they're not conscious that he's in control there's not consciousness at all that he holds their Destiny in his hands man thinks he holds his own destiny but he doesn't hold his own destiny one day at a judgment he'll they'll find out whose hands they're really in amen I I don't know if it was moody or one of the great preachers or Spurgeon or one of the great preachers preached a message called sinners in the hands of an Angry God and and just think about that how how would you like to have God's Wrath turned unto you oh my I sat there and I I I just begin to look at this great attitude that that that these men had towards God and and the fear that they had towards God and and and then in my heart I begin to think well Lord I don't why don't I feel that way you know why aren't I afraid of God and I I said I said I'm not afraid of God and I know he's I know he's the creator of all things I know that he's that with just a a a thought he can do away with the world that that there's there's there there's nothing that he can't do the scripture only says there's one thing that God cannot do and that's lie because he's truth and and there's no variance there's no changing in them he's unchanging God and I I just thought there for a moment I was sitting there and and and it just struck my heart is that the reason that that's not my Approach To God is because of Calvary because there was a blood that reconciled me to the father that the fear that man had because the law let man know that he was a sinner now the great God that sat a way that wise men were afraid of because the the fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom but I realized that that something had taken place that man was that man was separated ated from God by sin because they had the sin mark on their lives they were born in sin they were shaped in iniquity they came into the world speaking lies their very nature and their very actions their very disposition their very personality was really contrary to everything that God was I mean man lusted they they they they C Ed they stole they killed they murdered they blasphemed uh they they were adulterers and and they were everything so God had every reason in fact one time God repented that he even made man and he took man and and and looked down upon him and and uh he said I'll do away with this and but yet he provided an ark he Pro provided US Safety as I I watched and I thought of that I thought how would my life changed if if that was the way that that I lived in a fear of the father and and that's a a thing that people have lost a lot of respect for fathers you know we you know I I always had a reverent fear I wasn't afraid of my father as we might count fear but I knew that he had the authority I knew he had the power to bless and to punish and I wanted to do right in his sight and I honored his office as my father and I was raised a Catholic and and uh so it it it didn't have anything to do with scripture uh I I my my dad certainly believed that uh uh you didn't believe in sparing the rod at all you know I don't know of if people spank their children anymore you should never spank your child when you're angry you know and you don't spank them to hurt them but it's a good way to send the message you know just say it that way so it brought me to this point and and won't be long this morning that Calvary changed the relationship between man and God it it to think that this this stain or this Scourge that was upon me as being a human that he became a kinsman redeemer he became man and and that God so loved us that he sent his only begotten son that through him we might become the Sons and Daughters of God you know from Creature to son to daughter uh that's what that that that's a great change that took place at Calvary and I thought leading up to Calvary I in my heart I thought you know Lord I I've got a different relationship with you because of the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross that by his blood I was reconciled back to him I could I could resume resume my position again as son or daughter that I didn't have to remain away and far from him that I would just be uh a man that is filled with fear because of my weaknesses because of my uh inability to always be righteous that I have that I was governed by passions a and thoughts that drove me to do things that I never maybe even intended to do but but all of a sudden from that state that I'm in where I knew that at any time the wrath of God could come down and smoke me and that governed my life and then because of the sacrifice made at Calvary I was no longer in that state but now I was redeemed now I wasn't an outcast I wasn't an alien I I no longer was separated from him but I was renewed and reconciled with him again that I could cry ABA father that now I have a father and as the more I thought about that I thought Lord you know there's so many of us that really have not entered into that relationship with you as father a father and I began to just in my heart go through the scriptures and and scriptures started coming to me as soon as I sat there and I begin to realize wow that's what Jesus was teaching he was trying to change the relationship between man and God he was doing all that he could and he began to tell Parables and he began to tell uh uh preach sermons in everything and all all through these sermons what he was trying to do was he's trying to get the people to understand that that he he's your father not only is he your God that he should be feared but he's a a father that can that can be touched by your infirmities he's a father that hears your your prayers he's a father that's mindful of you he's a father that cares for you that it's not not the idea that he sits up there with his hands folded and he's got his eyes on you and boy you know he just waiting to send a strike of lightning now zap you know but he's actually looks at you as being begotten of him just think of that the gospel changed through the Lord he began to preach to us that God's your father God's your father and and and I I I thought as uh as what really he began to preach and the disciples begin to preach after him this this great theme begin to emerge out of all the scriptures and and and I again to see he says this thing is is not about something that's a far off but it's about something that's present a fatherson relationship and you know you go to a psychiatrist today and the first thing they want to do is lay you on the couch and say how did your daddy treat you you know every girl's got a daddy issue and and all that stuff and and and they just trying to figure it out you know what God settled all that at Calvary amen if you could ever come to that spot where you know the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed you from all unrighteousness and it restored you back to your relationship with your father that's what he came to do he came to take Sons and Daughters of God he that believeth on him he gave him power to become Sons and Daughters of God not Sinners not creatures not creation but they could actually have a relationship with a father you say well I'm an orphan you've still got a father Hallelujah I'm adopted you've got a father all kinds of situations children build B born out of wedlock single moms all kind we could that that's all those things thank God for Calvary because that price was paid to reconcile us it didn't keep one things out that weren't reconciled it didn't say this wasn't reconciled he he reconciled us with the father and reconciled all things unto himself and there he took it all on him so that he could bring to us the understanding and the Revelation that you are the children of God but we still live in so this such an idea that he's a far off that he's really not mindful that there's a Day of Reckoning coming and one day we'll have to answer and I thought Lord if I live like that I'm living below every privilege that you purchased for me at Calvary I thought of the the man that took the cruise he always wanted to go on a cruise and so he he saved up and he bought a ticket and he was on the cruise 10 day 14 day cruise don't remember how long it might be and he came uh finally to port and the captain would notice him standing at the front of the ship and looking out and maybe one day standing at the back of the ship and he would see him looking out and and but he never uh he noticed he never saw him at any activities and he never saw him go on Shore and he never saw him sitting at the dinner table and everything and so finally the captain being concerned made an effort to meet the man on the at Port of Call and as the man stepped off the plane he said sir could I speak to you and the man stepped over he said you know he said we pride ourselves in being the best cruise line there is and we have the greatest facilities and we try to provide the best entertainment and the best sightseeing and and everything and and I just want to know were you displeased with what we had to offer is is our reason did we not make food that you felt that you could eat and he looked at him he said sir he says I only had enough money to buy my ticket and the captain looked at me he said sir everything was included in your ticket it was all included but he failed to take advantage of what was purchased and I thought of Calvary I thought here here he purchased here he took me from the relationship that I had as sinner a God that I had to be afraid of and reconciled me back to the father made me a son again that I could cry ABA father that I didn't have to be distant but I could feel close and as we heard our messenger and even and them spoke he says it's our God that we could touch that we handled the Lord Of Glory God wanted to be tangible and when we don't enter into that relationship with him as him being a father then then he's he's a far off we hold him a far off instead of letting them come close and take our lives and correct us and guide us and and counsel us and and and bless BL us and protect us he's no longer father and I thought Lord I don't want to be have a God I want a father I need a spiritual father my natural father did all that he could for the years that God gave him but this journey takes a supernatural father I need I need that I need a close I need a guiding hand I can't be a loner I can't keep my feelings bottled up I can't just sit back and and wonder what's going to happen when he wants me to know that he holds my tomorrow that God if God be for you who can be against you and all through the scriptures I began to see that Jesus was preaching and trying to get the people to understand God's your father he's your maker even our message of this hour was the continual realization to try to get us to come back to an understanding that we are not alienated from God your name was you were in his thinking you were a part of him he gave you eternal life he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life what basically he's trying to say he's your father he's his father crawl up in his lap put your arms around him say Happy Father's Day you don't have to walk far away from them you saywell I'm not doing too good yeah when I wasn't doing good I didn't like going to see my dad either but I was sure glad when they all got over with and just could you imagine living like a uh a bonds woman's child when you're heir to all things you're not Shu you're seed you're bone of his bone you're part of him how many times did you hear our messenger say you're a part of him you're a part of him in the beginning you're his word you're his you're his thoughts expressed you're the word you're Sons and Daughters of God and I just read a few scriptures and and I I like in the in first John uh just an example of some of the great things that were were spoken in the scriptures and I I believe it's 1 John 1 and3 he said that which we have seen and heard declared we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and our True Fellowship is with the father so see so even John saying we declared the gospel unto you that you could have fellowship with us and our True Fellowship is with our father this this is what this is what he's saying this is a people that have come to be uh to the realization that that they have a father I'm not orphaned I'm not separated I'm not distant I'm not a part I am his offspring he's obligated to me he I like what David said Thou Art my God I was cast upon thee from my mother's womb I didn't have a choice you're my God and we can sit back not in fear anymore but with peace reconcile I give you peace that's her pathless understanding joy unspeakable and full of Glory Glory Hallelujah even if by shortcomings can anything separate us from the love of God Powers principalities swords Peril can anything separate us from the love of God through Christ Jesus our lord nothing amen nothing think of it this morning ask yourself and here's my father sitting there you know there's people that they haven't called their fathers in years they got they got some uh you know kick in their craw I think we say you know some little thing that that that separates them or or something and but just think of it he he took care of everything he said the path is clear the door is open I i' i' I've removed every obstacle you can walk right up into the face of the throne you can lift your hands and say Our Father which are in heaven that's what Jesus is teach how do we pray he his prayer like this our father I believe that's Matthew 6 9 and 13 somewhere in there he says the first thing I want you want to pray Our Father all of you everybody here us me you all together our father he's our father he's our father he you know I want to get this to you you know you're not a a people under the law you're not a people that's living in the fear of God you're not a people that's separated from God he begin to teach you and what was the Holy Spirit to do the Holy Spirit was to come and bring you into remembrance of all things that he taught and you go back and read the scriptures you will find that Jesus continually was trying to get the people to see that God is our father hallelujah our fellowship is with the father I believe in James uh James uh 1 and7 for example he says every perfect and GI gift comes from the father where does it come from where's all your blessings come from where's all the goodness come from we say God you know and I thought oh God you know God did this and God did that and and God everybody's got Gods but he wanted to take it above that thought process above that attitude above that distance and he wanted to make it more personal more full of love more full of blessing more full of Peace more full full of joy and he didn't want you to say oh oh oh God he said every good and perfect gift comes from God he wanted to be warmer than that more personal than that he said every good thing and perfect gift that's come into your life has come from your father it's come from your father not some from somebody off but somebody who's involved in your life every day who's there looking after you every day somebody who's present with you every day whether you recognize him or not in fact he tried to say it this way to us nothing can pluck us out of the palm of his hand if the father started a good work in you he'll finish it to the end the if the father okay the father does this the father does that the father's mindful the father cares for you the father looks after you Jesus is trying to get to the people you're his children and we still live if I could say this is all I'm just a nasty person who came to God and now I'm following God and that's true that would be the only relationship that we could establish from our side I'm just a sinner I'm no good I'm undeserving I I can do that I I I I all I could should be is a maid or a butler or a servant and then Jesus told the whole story and the parable about the prodal son and how that he squandered everything he was no good but what did he do he came to his father's house and his father sat there looking a far off because it was his son and he wouldn't allow a servant relationship or if I could say this a lore Fellowship than the fellowship of a son he proved it beyond measure he wanted to wipe away any doubt he killed the fatted calf oh what a type of Calvary he put the wedding garment on him he got the robe and put it on him and they called The Feast but you're he said my son which which was lost has returned he called him son even when his brother come he said wait a minute he said you all the things that you have are mind you've always been a blessing you do but look at it he was almost telling him he said son this is this your brother's my son and I love him the way that I love you and he'll always be my son and I'm not going to let them have a relationship with me less than that of a son or a daughter and I I hate the devil for depriving us because of our weaknesses from our fellowship with our Lord as children he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life because I was the son of his thoughts I was the son that he knew would be here he knew the color of my eyes the shape of my form everything that I would be and before I even got here he put the wedding band of predestination on me and called me his own [Music] Hallelujah he's trying to move us in this hour he's been trying to move us from Rel religion he's been trying to move us from organization he's been trying to move us from Works he's been trying to move us into the Capstone where we know we have a relationship with him father and son that's what Jesus restored that as he is so are we in this world as he's a son I thought of this scripture he said here in Luke 12 32 he said fear not little flock first thing he said is fear not Don't Be Afraid Don't Be Afraid fear not perfect love cast out fear let me tell you his love for you is perfect it's undying and unseparable fear not little flock for which your father's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he didn't say it it's God's good pleasure and I'm not trying to say that great name of God and but I wanted to to to say that's our approach distant far away not close not rejoicing not with joy and Thanksgiving I remember that my children sometimes if they got mad at me they would say oh I'm adopted yeah I said it's amazing that that we got you from a place that had big old noses you know and that that's no you can't get separated from God you can't get separated from God you're a part of them so why not enter into the relationship with him by natural there's many mothers that aren't mothers they're birthgiver there's many men that are are are are not fathers they're procreators but the father that we have is the father of light he's the father of every good imp perfect thing he's the Fountain of Life and the Fountain of Love he's all powerful Almighty he can do anything that he wants to do come I'll say this this morning my daddy can beat up anybody my daddy's the smartest my daddy's the best my daddy's the most intelligent my daddy's the most powerful fact my daddy created heaven and earth Hallelujah that's my [Applause] dad enter into that relationship that's what Calvary was for that's why he died that's why he nailed there on the cross and suffered that he can reconcile you back as children oh there's so many scriptures I could just go for hours showing you that Jesus kept teaching go read your scriptures read The Parables over and over again it's always this the father you were this way but the father you know the father will not leave you the father will finish the work the father will do this the father will do that the father you have a father and I sat there and I thought Lord God I would have never known that if Jesus didn't come and give isav that I could see a religious world building temples and buildings and Ministries to a God and where all God wants is his children back it's all he wants he wants you to come to his table you to come to his feet you to crawl up on his lap and say father I [Music] remember I think it was I don't remember it was David or Matthew you know I did one of those father things that's always not so smart I bought my kid slingshots well it didn't take long to take the neighbors window out so two of the boys got in a fight and so one of them took the slingshot and swung it of course the the handle stretched out and hit the other one in the head and you know hit him and so my dad yelled at him and I maybe spanked him I don't remember some sent him out of the room and uh you know a few minutes later I don't know if it was David or Matthew was it you David who H who hit who anyway they shot one another they did all kinds of things you know but all of a sudden he comes back into the room comes down to the room you you know how you snivel you know and then sits next and down and he says well I love you grandpa thought that's it I love you father and you said you love me and you said nothing could take that love from me and this morning I believe with all my heart I could go through messages I could go through quotes I could go through hours that all the gospel has been trying to do for for ages is get men back to their father to the relationship of father and you can't compare our Earthly Fathers as good as mine was he can never have done for me what my heavenly father has done for me my father is not here to honor today I believe God gave them to me he put a lot of Virtues I I could almost say it in this sense through the hand of my heavenly father my Earthly father passed on to me the ability to have built this building so my natural father is in all of this but all things were made possible by my heavenly father and today no matter what your life situation is no matter what your family situation is no matter how wronged you've been and whatever Misfortune has come to you by the sinful nature of man this morning you have a father a father that loves you a father that's never forsaken you and even this morning is still looking after you he's preparing a place for you that where he is you will be also and he's got all these great benefits and they come with the fair they come with Calvary so I just pray this morning that you would establish within your heart your relationship with God as your father he was willing to condens send and come down and become sin that he could redeem us back so we could stand and say father our father he says the f father knows what you have need of before you ask I want you if you just could see that theme in Jesus he never referred to him as far away he said your father knows what you have need of then he looked over him and he told a great story he said which one of you having a son and would ask for bread you would give him a rock and which one of you having a son if he asked for a fish you would give him a serpent he said if if your Earthly fathers will do good things for you how much more your heavenly father oh brothers and sisters and I can say this morning brothers and sisters because we have the same father no big eyes no little you we are not a religion we are a family and I looked at those people in the Old Testament and I thought oh they always had a god a far off but then Calvary came the price was paid and then he could say these words I'll be with you even in you and I thought hallelujah what a restored Fellowship the father in me and I in him father I pray that they may be one as we are one oh the joy of having a father and I'm glad that I got to meet my heavenly father and one day I'll see him in the flesh that which I know by Spirit one day I'll know face to face and what a glorious day that will be so I say to you all happy Father's Day because you all have a father Rejoice God loves you God bless you amen let's all stand this morning and I was thinking as Brother David was preaching this morning the the story that but Ram tells about his daughters Rebecca I believe in Sarah and one comes running and he said oh I got hold of Daddy and everything and the other one looking and crying a far off and and then the prophet signals her to come and anden she comes and then she said to the other you may have got hold of daddy but Daddy's got hold of me and I believe God has got hold of us this morning we can certainly come into his house and know that I'm in his hands amen amen [Music] G father of Life s it on on your throne of GRA oh and it's only by your mercy we are sa oh and Lord you have said if we call upon your name oh we and our families will be saved so we cry I your name Oh and answer God a great oh Lord
