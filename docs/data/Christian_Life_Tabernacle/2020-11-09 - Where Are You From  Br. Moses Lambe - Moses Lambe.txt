Description:
Where Are You From
Br. Moses Lambe
Sunday Evening Service: November 8th,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

preach in and he said that he would preach in english tonight so we're grateful for that are you excited about that hey amen i i i really think that it's wonderful that he's gonna minister first is that amazing grace that you're playing amen it's grace i'm sure moses would tell you it's grace that he's here and it's all grace that we're here so let's just sing it i'm in great expectation tonight he said how long should i preach brother mcgire i said as long as the anointing's there that's supreme authority amen so we all come subject to the word there's no big eyes or little use i'm just

grace lord amazing grace that you speak this out from the death lord from the to set our feet on the rock to stay lord we changed our garments from garments of shame and you gave us a new robe which is that word lord you took away our pride and you give us humility or you took away lord our high-mindedness and you led us to walk lord neatly before your face so tonight again i recognize as a man that lord there's nothing that i have nothing i can do but lord i turn to the cross of calvary because lord here's your purchased possession and i'm aware that only you can speak to their hearts and their needs so i pray that you help me step aside and let the holy ghost take control lord because their needs are your concerns lord your cries are in your ears lord so i pray that you be the one that speaks to us tonight thank you for good and david and his heart and the burden for the people or that we can be edified i pray that only be rewarded i pray that my contribution be effective for the glory of your name bless your people tonight we ask you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated for a moment god bless you tonight i i've been trying to escape this moment but uh i would not be i was not very successful and where david been last time he called me in the office i was trying to run out he said come come come come and i said i thought well we're gonna meet out there he didn't even let me get out he said where moses i want you to give me your schedule and i thought in my hand i said i won't be a good thing i give her david the schedule i guess not much i can change about that because he's sure gonna just set it up so i've been telling christians i said i need to give birth david the schedule he said when you gonna do it i said soon and so the day i just came to church and i was about to leave again and i just disappeared as usual and i told him i said i want to go home and pick up my missionary bag and head to wichita falls and i we're getting ready i said drop me off real quick cause i got to be there by four o'clock and before we got to the house my phone rang and i said who's this and where b was calling me he said where you brother moses i said hmm i said well i'm already gone bro billy said well bro david looking for you i said oh oh and he said well just hold on a minute i knew what that meant oh man i got to talk to brad david and he said you're running away from me i said no sir he said well he's gonna do me something good if he preached tonight well i didn't say anything in the morning but today is my birthday when i woke up in the morning today he's my he's my roommate i got up i said christian i just feel good in my soul i told him i said i don't know what all's gonna happen but i'm just happy i said man i just feel so good i say i don't know what god's gonna do but i just feel real happy and the lord has been good to us because i can tell you for a fact that god spoke to me this morning god spoke to me by his word and he let me see some things in his word that just helps us to know that we are not living here this is not our home we are just passing through we cannot forget ourselves here i'm thankful to god for my friend christian that you see here i just want to give a short testimony he may not like it but i have to give the testimony christian and i went to high school about 15 years ago in cameroon africa and at the time i my dad is a preacher as a pastor for a long time we're basically born in a church but i never i told myself i said this message thing and this christian people their stuff is for them it's not for me it's for the old people that's what i thought in my mind you know your plans are one thing and god's plan is another thing and so as i got in the world i just i would go to church but i would not have any experience with god but yet i went to church and then i started dating a young lady that was christian's best friend and she was my girlfriend and christian was her best friend and one of christian's best friends really liked my girlfriend and so chris she he talked to christian and christian was trying to get them hooked up so me and christian didn't get along very good because i i i didn't like this guy trying to take away my girlfriend from me so me and christian didn't we didn't go together we can't even walk together but you know when the lord came to me in 2009 in january i was sitting in the back of the church because i always thought you know if you said in the back the word of god is not going to hit you very hard like the people in the front so i knew i wasn't right i'm not saying those in the back you're not good don't don't take it wrong but i was sitting in the back because i said well by the time the word of god get to me it's going to kind of dilute you know but that's my thinking but that's not what the word of god says it says the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than a two-edged sword said dividing asunder even to the joints and as a deserter of the thoughts and this of the infants of the heart of man hebrews 4 12. so the word of god is not less powerful in the back of the hallway and i was sitting back there and the pastor was preaching my dad i said well we had a party at ten o'clock and he kept preaching and preaching and preaching i said man does he not know we got other things to do why is he preaching long like this it's friday night friday night usually short that's what i planned it tonight and he just kept going so i said well 9 30 if he's not done i'm gone lo and behold nine o'clock the lord came back there i was sitting there he said you got to repent you're sinner so i look around me i said who's talking to me like that nobody he's preaching over there but the same word of god that was in the front is the same word of god that was in the back so i looked around and i said maybe it's just my mind playing me some tricks i'm gonna be okay i'll just continue on so you have to repent you are a sinner so i said let me just make a i just sat back here in canada he said nope you have been living a double life before these people make it right the right way and i said what so i took a little paper and i said i have a testimony when the deacon saw the note he said you have a testimony because i never used to be in the front church is over i'm gone so he's shocked this young man has a testimony so when i go to the front even know what i was gonna say all i remember was my shirt was wet my pants was wet and i was crying out to god for salvation and the lord came i remember my dad he was standing in the back he started crying he said lord i thank you because salvation has come to my house and i said so he knew all along i wasn't safe and i looked on the right side and i saw my mom she was doing like this i said i think she's done praying for salvation for me now she can go to the next prayer topic because she sure was praying for the lord to rescue me out of the hands of the devil and she never gave up moms don't give up dads don't give up it may look like it's gonna be over it's not over amen so when the lord came and rescued me and saved me from sin it started changing my life so everything that i like to do had to change too i said well i know i can still have my girlfriend i'm gonna convert her we'll just go to church together and then thank you brother i didn't have no luck on that one i said lord what am i gonna do now because i don't know how to tell all this stuff and i know i can we can't live the way we used to live before i didn't have the words i said well i'm gonna pray i started praying praying no appetite to eat no more because i had a burden on my heart i had to get it out and i stopped praying say lord give me the words give me the courage give me the time so one wednesday i know the lord gave me the courage you gave me the words to give me the time i went to when that time were in college i went to school i said hey you know what i got to talk to you for a minute he said okay we sat down we started talking i told her i said the lord came to my life not long ago and something has changed so i i we cannot live like we used to it's either you're gonna serve the lord with me or we just have to part our ways he said well we can you just do some christian dating type thing i say ah but we cannot do the things we used to do before we have to go by what the word of god said she said well you're kidding when she looked at me in my eyes she said you're not kidding and she started crying and that was over and that was it so the lord really gave me the words the time and the courage if you ask us for anything he'll give it to you and so when i traveled over here the lord saved me in january i traveled in july i come with still good friends so she texts me oh my friend christian is in florida i said what i don't want to hear about christian first of all he's the one who was trying to get you hooked up with that other guy and now you're telling me he's in florida what do i have to do with him she said well just look for him i said okay so i went to see my sister in florida i said where's that friend of yours anyway he gave me his address his phone number i called him and i go to visit him so we just started talking you know just talking and everything i said well my sister lives here if you don't mind just i'll show you where she lives and so i took her there and he and my sister became even closer than sometimes myself they call she calls him like his son they talk on the phone all the time and i kind of got jealous a little bit but god knows what he does and they invited him to church in florida so he went to church one year two years sometime over there just looking around and he was struggling because he didn't have a residence in the united states and he had played the diversity lottery program and he is waiting for nancy so he sent his a prayer request the voice of god said pray for me um doing this thing and that so they prayed for him then he got it he became a resident so he said this y'all's god is kind of serious y'all's god is kind of real so you kept going to church and one day my sister calls me she said moses your friend christian is getting baptized sunday and my heart i said lord i could never have imagined what you're going to do look at where we started look at where we are now now he's not only my brother in christ he's my friend he's my roommate the guy i didn't want to see before is god not great our god he's an awesome god erased from heaven above with wisdom and power lord our god is an awesome god so you're seeing a testimony right there amen here's my brother i love him i just wanted to share that next testimony the lord heals me from coronavirus last month i start you know i work in the hospital with people who were sick with corti virus i used to work there and i was taking care of them wholeheartedly i didn't that's my that's my job so one day i started having a headache started feeling kind of not too good but i said nah it's just the mask too tight because those masks are pretty tight i said no it's just the mask and the brother called me in houston he said brother moses i've been praying we're going to get together with some young people the lord told me to call you i said brother zoe i'm not feeling too good i don't know what it is but i kind of have a little bit of a headache i'm still okay but i get tired he said moses i was praying the lord told me to call you i said brother he told you hold on let me pray so you can tell me too so i went to my room and i said lord this is how i feel you know what's out there i don't want to go make nobody sick so if it's not your will for me to go let me stay home but if it's your will for me to go give me the conviction in my heart i said it man i started feeling my heart to go to houston i said lord well it's too quick let me pray again i prayed again go i said let me go to the park maybe in the park there's no i went to the park i logged my car i pray then we're able to call me while i'm in the car over how you do i said bro i have a situation here

night saturday sunday the lord blessed us i cannot even say what all he did young people came to the lord gave their hearts to him just repenting crying out to god for lord help us lord deliver me from this from that just different things but we have to pray close proximity so i was praying i said lord i gotta get close now i remember david said i got some six inches you know so i could pray pretty far off six feet away but now i had to get closer and ask them what's your need for prayer say lord i don't feel good but you told me to come so i left from this monday and amber stefan calls

a rapid er and they swap my notes oh it's negative i said ah something isn't right i know how i feel now i didn't want to be sick but i won't lie to myself either so i wasn't looking for sickness but i knew how i felt you have to be honest with yourself don't go about saying i denied the disease you're already sick brother that's why god is a healer don't say oh i refuse this sickness i no that's not what he said if you're sick go to him say lord i'm sick give me healing if you're not sick you don't need a healer so i said i called my hospital i said look i started having some fevers i don't

taste something too and i'll taste it oh i can taste stuff now i said my god i'm healed now was this was everything gone yet no but i have to take what the word of god said the prophet said the word of god is a seed you take that seed and you begin to water that seed so they call me from work how do you feel i feel okay check the temperature is it okay yeah three days can you come back to work oh yes and i went back to work but my trouble was lord i gotta check in houston make sure nobody got sick i called houston everybody's sick over there brother moses everybody's okay we ain't got no symptoms yet we ain't got no temperature we ain't got no fever everybody's well i said lord god of heaven thank you lord i call christians as a christian in the beavers he said nope no favors i said lord go to heaven thank you lord and i just remember to step in there as well we take our precautions still we don't become negligent because of that no sir but we thank god for the things that he does to help our faith let's not take too much time it's not my fault of the services longer david said he said it i asked him i said birthday so let's just read the word of god we're not going to be long god will bless us this evening amen let's open our bibles in the book of john chapter 17 and i can promise you i'm not going to say something new that you've not heard i'm not going to bring you anything strange i'll only say what has been said already because it's like bro david said in the morning is to bring to our remembrance the stirring up of her mind amen and that's my desire tonight that the lord would just bless us again i want us to just read in the book of john chapter 17 and we're going to read from verse 14 to verse 18 and ask the lord for his blessing on the word this is what the word says i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not for that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world he said that twice sanctified them through thy word thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world lord jesus hears thy word that prophet said to turn the pages it requires a human hand but for the opening of the scriptures it takes the holy spirit so holy spirit lord take control and help us bless your people tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god bless you you may be seated as we try to find something here in the word of god do you love the lord it's a blessing to be in the house of god david said one day in your house is better than a thousand elsewhere so why do people not want to come to church good question right one day in your house is better than a thousand elsewhere now let's do some math a little bit of math if you work a full-time job 40 hours a week you work five days a week eight hours church we have church three times three days a week one wednesday it's tuesday night and then there's service sunday morning sunday night now if we take the work hours compared to the church hours you work 40 hours do we go to church 40 hours but nobody missed work hey man we only come to church a couple of hours per service so if you do the ratio is like 40 on maybe let's say eight hours let's just say eight hours that's too much you're still not that's 32 hours working over spending time in the house of god but that's not the subject tonight but just so we can enjoy coming to the house of god amen i was in wichita falls with one brother in the church for two years me and him only some people say oh brother you speak spanish wonderful that's where god put me to school to learn spanish me and one brother he preached i said amen amen one day my mom came to visit me when i graduated and she came to the church there was only two cars outside so when i saw her walking and she was looking all over the place she sat down after trick i said mom why are you looking everywhere like that she said well when i came here and i always saw two cars outside but when i was coming in you always sing it like there was a thousand people in here i said mom you're making a mistake because the bible said where two or three would gather in his name he would come and does god walk alone she said son i never thought about it like that i said yep my god is not alone where two or three gather in his name he comes there with the host of heaven brother when you come into church come expecting to meet god come expecting to have an encounter with god come expecting that god would use whoever is standing here to speak to your life when somebody goes to the hospital and he's sick his expectation is that on this charge he's going home healed now if he goes home sick either there was a quack doctor or he didn't take the prescription two things but the doctor you are coming to me tonight is called doctor jesus he needs a resume there's no failures i used to walk on the cardiac floor and the patient would say oh i want doctor this because i heard he's a very good doctor i said sister hey i was taking my money if you open up his resume you're gonna find some cases where he didn't cut the vein right you're gonna find some people maybe he passed away from his surgery so he's not a hundred percent i said about the jesus i know he does surgery without no incisions hallelujah he does diagnosis without no blood draw brother a lady come to the prophet she's standing there she had a free blood draw she had a free lab test and his calories said oh sister you're not sick you got a potassium deficiency what time did he draw the blood sent to the lab pass through the machine get the result [Applause] my patients don't want to get stuck and so you coming again yeah i got to get some blood because the the lab needs some to find how much potassium you've got but god gives you free lab tests he scans you and say you're not sick you only have a potassium deficiency that would have taken a doctor's appointment a referral to the lab a blood draw sent for the sample check it out lab technician send the result back to the doctor he reads it sends it to the nurse nurse tell the patient do you know how long that takes but right there they get their they get their skin they get their lab tests they get the result they get the solution right there that is dr jesus now that's the kind of god you came to meet tonight you didn't come to symbolic moses i cannot help you don't you know me for all these years what have i done for you but the one that you're coming to me hallelujah his name is the mighty conqueror [Applause] so what kind of expectation should you be coming sunday morning sunday night wednesday even in your room when you go down to pray what kind of expectation should you have the brother said when you pray it doesn't bring god down no it brings you up so you can get in his presence and you can talk to him oh hallelujah that's not even the the subject tonight my brother said we'll be pulling brother i think they're pulling hard now god help me help me jesus says i have given them thy word and the world has hated them so you are not hated because of anything else but the word now is not for the knowledge of the word that you are hated no sir you are hated because when the world comes to your life the world changes you the world makes you a different being you begin to speak different you begin to act different and your actions go against the actions of the world because they have another wisdom like where they say this morning they have their intelligence their wisdom their modern things technology and those things influence them and they are living out the result of the influence now when you accept the word jesus said the word that i speak to you they have two characteristics they are spirit and their life so when those words come into your being they begin to produce within you a life brother peter went to church every day with jesus he didn't know that unconsciously he was being changed till one day when he went where he refused jesus they told him you're with him said no i don't know that guy then afterwards they say hey you're with him he said no something you speak like them so every day while he went to church his language was being changed hallelujah it was happening unconsciously but the people that saw the difference was those who were in the world your speech is different why do you wear a long skirt like that why do you let your hair grow why it's because you have received the word and that word would not give you peace in the ways of the world that word will keep you in line even when you desire to go against it it will bring you back it's a life and it's struggling to express itself hallelujah it's there he's looking to pass through the cracks of the concrete to come out and there's nothing can stop it there's nothing can hold it it's going against every odd it must manifest itself he said i have given them that word and the world has hated them so if they hate you now you know why they hate you for the cause of the word of god and he's the reason he says because they are not of the world and he he relates why they are not always saying even as i hallelujah so you are not of the world because even as he is not of the world meaning you and him were somewhere before hallelujah meaning you are not here by heroin by chance god knew the color of the clothes you're going to wear tonight he knew where you are going to be sitting he knew the shoes you would wear he knew you would say amen to the word he said even as i am not of the world they too are not of the world so the question is if you are not of the world what are you from that is a player he was praying but in the prayer he hides your your origin in the prayer he hides the place where you came from so everybody can read it oh let's be one i said we should be one but they don't even see inside their prayer the lord has hidden your origin he takes a prophet to come down hallelujah to take it out and give it a meaning and it takes somebody with the capacity to catch it the prophecy god does not send his servants to people who are not of the same caliber [Applause] he said he could not send his prophet to the woman with a woman because he told him i have prepared hallelujah he had talked to that mama before the prophet came i have prepared a woman who will feed you and the prophet said god walks on god bless you mama she said on both sides so if god walks here god was here hallelujah amen are you seeing that let's just continue it's just it's it's it's rich it's where dave asked me said you're going to say hallelujah to your preaching i said brother yeah but the thing is while i'm standing here talking to you i see my notes just getting changed and transformed so i can say hallelujah then because it's not me i'm hearing i say hallelujah praise god and i tell it to you because it's not my stuff that i got set up and all fixed up oh no no no no he doesn't work like that the brother we have to be flexible the spirit of god knows your needs and he sends a word to meet your need he sends a word to encounter your situation otherwise it is a word that comes in a season amen so if you are not from here where are you from because you say oh he just prayed for the read verse 9 here see what he says i pray for them i pray not for the whole world but for them which thou has given me for they are so the prayer was specific the prayer was targeted targeted to who brought about praise his hand real quick the prayer was targeted to you he said i pray for them not for the whole world even though the bible says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that was not the whole world as you thinking [Music] jesus did not come to die to see if by chance somebody would just accept him oh i'm gonna go die there when they see me die they'll just cry did you see him dying so why are you believing we don't believe because we saw it but there is something in your soul there's something inside of you that's saying i need ye o lord i need thee every hour i need it there's something you telling you you don't come from this place don't get used to it maybe it's about where do i come from lord you guys show me if i come from somewhere show me where i come from because depending on where i come from who i have an attitude i have a way of walking the prophecy he went to the store with his wife and they saw one lady with a dress he said he was kind of shocked do you even see and his wife asked him but why do we why do we he said no we are not americans we are from heaven and because of our kingdom we have to kind of align ourselves we have to kind of dress like the ambassador of the united states to cameroon my country is not under the law of cameroon i can't even chase him into the embassy because the embassy the united states is no longer cameroon even though it's in cameroon it is the united states the flag that flies there is the united states flag and the bible say you and i we are pilgrims you and i were just crossing if we are crossing to go somewhere we need to have a flag we need to have a king we need to have somebody we are representing and the word christian means to be like christ he said i have come that they might have life and have life in abundance and david said my cup runners over he said he was full no he said my cup runners over so the life that he had was running over and jesus said i came so that they can have life and have life in abundance um somebody's happy now it takes a profit of god to calm down because the bible say as my thoughts are high as the heavens so are my ways higher than your ways and so if the thoughts of god remain up there you and i will never know what they are he takes somebody with the spiritual capacity to grab the thoughts of god and begin to tell you because god will do nothing on the earth amos 3 7 without first no second first revealing is sacred revealing the hidden things to his servants the prophet now is it for the prophet to keep now let me show you scripture deuteronomy 29 says the sacred things belong to the lord but those that are revealed belong to us and to our children so we can fulfill the law of god so you cannot even know what to do if it has not been revealed to you what it is that's why we can all have bible everybody has a bible now everybody go every church of the bible but to see the mind of god in that bible he'll require god to send us a prophet and then he takes to earth and he tells you now this is what he meant here when he said this he was saying this then now hear what the prophet says we are asking where are we from then hear this oh lord hey what he says here oh i like this okay he said why in uh the invisibility of the bride of christ prague 241 he said why it was put in there by predestination you were foreordained to a son of god you were in god before the foundation of the world you are only manifested in this day for his honor and glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with the enemy word of god he said yes sir which you are part of by the word by predestination because look the god is the word you believe it congregation says amen well then if he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the word was god then you were in god the word the part that you are to play was in god before the foundation of the world he seen you he knew you he predestinated you to eat this morning we spoke about properly with music about the god of this evil age now god is telling us in his word you are not of this world amen you are not of this evil age but knowing from where you come from will give you a way of acting a way of behaving yourself and now the prophet takes us back there and is telling us this is where you were hear this next thing wonderful and then we're just putting a quick foundation so now the same thing is this in christ is revealed in his own word 65 august 22nd 28 said now the same thing is this if you are a son of god and if i am a son of god or a daughter of god we were in god he said at the beginning and when jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him germ form hallelujah when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he arose from the dead we arose with him one day a brother called me i was i believe at ten o'clock at night he said brother moses i gotta tell you something because your sister had two dreams that you died i said brother hold on hold on it's ten o'clock and now i'm trying to sleep you gotta be real slow i gotta listen to you he said i'm kind of scared because she told me twice but when he said i was gonna die he said she saw you in the coffin oh my god my hair just stood up my heart stood racing said man i'm gonna die just like that you know that fear instant fear just oh get ahold of you i said man i'm not gonna die and while i'm talking to him a scripture just come up to my heart you are dead and your life is healing christ jesus i said hold on brother hold on orto you're talking to a dead man [Applause] he said what you mean brother you're a young man you don't have kids yeah i say you don't matter anybody can die i said but i'm already dead he said what do you mean said the bible say i'm dead and my life is healing christ in god in christ jesus he said i said but i don't say blood to this this is the word of god he said all right brother good night say good night amen you gotta take the whole door you believe that word till the devil can't scare you no more the prophet said jesus had to believe everything that was written of him i know there is one scripture he sure believed you know which one it was he would not leave my soul in hell neither would that let thy holy one see corruption and when they put the nail after he just remember that it was written of me i would not see corruption he had to believe it and when he was taking his last breath do you think he still believed it he still believed it and when he died that scripture came alive hallelujah that scripture left the books hallelujah and the scripture began to take form in him and before corruption say i got him said hold on you step aside from here is standing on the word of god he shall not see death he will not stay in the grave and corruption would not take a hold of him amen and corruption say amen you got to believe it that way the bible said none of his bones were broken and he believed it and they broke everybody else's bones hallelujah and they got to him did they break his bones do you know how long that was prophesied hundreds of years before he even came but he could just rest like god's faithful oswald and they didn't touch one bone one so i told that brother i said thank you for your testimony i got to go back to sleep god bless you bye-bye and i'm still alive today he said when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he arose from the dead we arose with him and now since we have recognized it amen now we sat together with him in heavenly places in christ jesus oh i gotta hold myself so see for he we if we are sons and daughters of god we are god's children then we are attributes of god then we wear got eternal life and god is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when jesus became all that word then we were part of him then amen now this is what i love he said there you are that's in there there's no devil there's no powers no nothing can ever move it they hear what you say that's the thai post of the soul just relax amen the tempest is raging in there just hold on all this wow cuz deep down in my soul he told me i'm in him all as well brother do you know what that does to the devil he put his nasty head he just got to go away no next verse say i pray not that thou should take them out of the world we just read what he said there's no devil that can take it or move it and jesus is saying here i don't pray so you take them out of the world because corona came i got to get the rapture out real quick the rapture is not running away from the world the rapture is a victorious exit of overcomers you are going to overcome self the devil and the world you are not going to heaven if you don't overcome because he said for he that overcome it now that he gives you the tools to overcome our george is our lawyer he said i pray not that you take them out of the world but that thou should just keep them from the evil the enemy from the oppression one time my brother preached i remember he said the lord let the devil in his eden to cause destruction and to sow confusion now the lord is letting us in the devil's eden to show the devil there are going to be some people who would stay with the word of god so who's got the biggest blow the devil's got the biggest blow because when everything looks like it's going dark there's a spark of light here spark of light there spark of light here sparkles like that and i tell you the more darkness there is the more your light shines forth so darkness does not scare us it's gonna get bad yes it's gonna get bad and it's okay because he told me that there's no devil that can move that he said there's no devil do you know what that does to you he gives you peace he gives you calm he gives you blessed assurance jesus his mind they're hoping you're going to stumble and fall just you're still standing when the i stopped that trial was kind of big this was going to be the one taking boy no he's still standing but why is because something has anchored deep down on his soul and he's conscious that the god that called him knew him for he knew me amen and he calls you because he knows you now if the god of heaven knows you he knows your address he knows your home he knows your room he knows how many hairs you have on your head even if you go to the barber now what does the number of my head matter to god for it's just hair it's going to go it's going to get gray sometimes it's going to cut it off it's just to show you how much he cares for you would somebody care for you that much if there's not a connection between you and him would somebody know how many hairs you have i don't know how many hair my wife's has i don't know i can't tell how many hairs she has but she can't blame me for it i'm not god but god knows such a detail about you how much more of the things that you carry in your heart how much more of those prayers you pray to him day and night how much more like brother you say this morning that woman went to the judge every day every day when the judges got tired say i gotta take care of this woman or she's gonna break my door and sometimes you have to push you pray until something happens you're just praying constantly i'm not saying you take a 40-day fast i don't know what i say but you bring that prayer topic to god every time you're praying lord remember this lord remember this father i'm bringing it to you again lord and something you wouldn't need to pray no more you know what it's going to come to pass but he said keep them while they are here so you and i have a special protection while we are just passing through our pilgrimage you and i have a special guidance is that the angel of the lord he comes about them that fear him and does what he delivers them from evil you have special protection he's there with you all the time daytime nighttime morning afternoon evening it's there if you could see it you wouldn't fear but sometimes because you don't see it you get a little scared was there with his servant the prophet of god he saw the army oh they're gonna kill us he's just two of us he didn't say lord let me see the angels that are here no he said lord open his eyes give him some eye self so he can see because he looks like if he doesn't see you he's going to bother me as screaming all day now do you think when he saw he was still screaming oh he just can't calm down with us more than those folks over there he's just so tired so far everywhere heaven ready to defend them anytime so man look at the kind of protection i got but the bible declares to you you have the angel of the lord that comes about you and defends you from all evil okay so the prophet said we were somewhere in the beginning i want to read one last thing and then with the help of the lord we're just going to try to see if we can close can we yes we can close we're not going to be very long so god help us i'm looking here for that message show us the father and we're gonna read something there and that's for the blessings of god okay here it is i just want to read this it's very important i wanted to really make sure we get it okay this is it thank you lord we'll read this here 176. he was either god or he was a deceiver that's right he was god emmanuel god made manifest in the flesh and dwelt among us the bible said that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself that's exactly what it was said back yonder beginning let's take a little trip when i read this i said lord i can't do it here but this man here said go he said let's take a little trip to see who he was so you can find out whether god was in his son or not let's close our eyes as it was and take a trip a hundred million years before there was a star in the sky where he said a hundred million years my mind just went black i can hardly remember what happened three years ago and then he's taking me a hundred million years before there was a star in the sky now this man can go there because he's going to reason he's going to want to figure it out but the man does his head here he said let's go i'll fly with you he just takes off because he walked by faith and he just goes there and he says let's take a trip a hundred million years before there was ever star in the sky there was god god was there then and now look in the beginning now i see the great space yonder and he begins to go into all that describing about the logos we're not going to go into that and then i want to read one more here let's just read it it's important it's important to read it he said and they come he come out and there was nothing then here comes the logos that looks like a halo hanging yonder no man has seen god at any time now eye to eye and here's the logos looks like it's a supernatural being it's a halo that's the son of god not eternal sonship because the words don't go good together that's catholic doctrine but eternal how could it be a sonship and be eternal if he's a son he'd had to have a beginning of time eternal is forever see so eternal sonship there's no such a word to make it sensible thank god for that he just blew away a whole bunch of lies so but it was the logos that went out of god and there he was playing out there in space just like a child before the door i can see him draw the whole picture in his mind of the kingdom and what it might be and then the first thing you know i hear him say let there be light and when he did an atom broken down and the sun become into existence i watched the sun burn for millions of years i pretty much how are you watching this thing but it's true he said i watched the sun burn for millions of years and the first thing you know went a clinker he stood and watched it and it it flew for a million years he stopped it and another flew and he stopped it what he was putting the solar system he was writing the first bible the first bible was written in the skies man looked up knowing god was above okay now if he says that you were is god he said a hundred million years before there was a star now there's still nothing even existing he has not even created one speck of dust he takes you on a little trip just a hundred million years back when i go back yesterday two days ago last week i started having some little laps of i started forgetting details you know i stopped forgetting stuff to happen but if you take me 100 billion years back how am i gonna remember this stuff amen you don't use the memory that you got because this memory ain't no good there's another memory that you lost when the attorney said who's this man that living the seas and the waves they're saying men to him he turned to them he said men of little faith because his expectation was that they would know he had come to show them who they were supposed to be and this who's this guy and he's saying who are you don't you know who you're supposed to be then when he was here he said i am the last of the world and say amen there is about to go you say you are now the amen kind of drop a little bit he said you are the lie to the world lord that's kind of heavy stuff as long as you say he was it's cool but when he turned to me and said it's you you know why you shake like that because your memory just come look you did this you this hey remember remember remember remember remember remember remember and then you auto disqualify yourself lord don't come close to me because i'm amanda and he said coming closer lord i'm worthy he said it's okay but come here amen now if the prophet says you were in god when he had not even created nothing and then one day isaiah is looking at a vision he sees some strange fellow in heaven saying in his heart we're not going to read everything i'll just we'll just go through it but when you go home you can read isaiah 14. see this fellow in heaven saying i would i would raise my throat i'll be like god let's just read it isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 to 17. hear this how the art fallen from where from heaven so after the creation when heaven was made how god fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how thou art cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in then who in that heart so my father the lord god is not a designer today he started discerning way back in heaven he said you said in thine heart god saw his thought in his heart when they were still up there i will ascend into heaven i will absorb my throne above the stars now is it the stars you see here okay i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation but notice what he said about the location in the sides of the north we're going to continue say i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high so see his desire he tried to establish this desire in heaven he tried to set up his kingdom in heaven but there cannot be two kingdoms where there's already a key one kingdom has to out he say yet thou shalt be brought down to hell hallelujah to the sides of the pit so he's not going to sit in the sides of the north no siree he's going to go to hell and be in the sides of the pit i have one reminder i love to give the devil you know which one it is when i'm in trouble with affliction i said devil it's okay you have your date with hell fire you'll be chained one of these days and cast into the pit of fire do what you do now and i'll probably be there to watch you go down said they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider this saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that the shake kingdoms so what would he have come to nothing that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of the prisoners so his job is to make prisoners who will never be set free but my joy the job of my jesus is to set the captives free so while he was trying to set up this program in heaven the king of heaven saw it but he had one desire i want to go into kind of real quick he said i want to sit in the sides of the lord so there was an order in heaven things were set in order but when you come down to earth and you look how israel was traveling with the ark of the covenant around the ark of the covenant there was three tribes each north south east west now on the north side each the three tribes had one tribe which was their leader and each side had a banner you can find this in the book of numbers 225. you can read it at home on the north side there were three tribes there was a tribe of acer dan and naphtali and dan was the leader of them but you know what the abana was it was the ego hallelujah the devil was really desiring to sit upon the people who will be here in the end time because the prophet said in every age god sent a spirit to fight the spirit of that age and in our age what did god send us thank you brother he sent us a flying eagle and when the prophet begins to dissect what the eagle is like you're like what he said is flying way up in the heights but he can pinpoint a needle on the ground so his vision is not 20 20. it's binoculars is not adjustable it's just good and god's seeing the evil age we are going to live in the deception that has been cooked and prepared to trap the stars of god in this time he said i wouldn't leave them like that because in the time of poison they had a spirit of a lion they were born they went everywhere preaching the word they didn't care who you were they will tell you the word of god in the dark edges that there are spirit on ox sacrifice they just die cut it looks okay then came the reformers it's a man with wisdom but in your age in your time god said i got to give my kids some clear vision i got to give those ones there sight to see because they won't be able to sing loudest here i've got to give some folks eyes have so they can detect the devil in every move and so the devil was late even when he was thinking like that in heaven he was already late because god had already set him up for failure now look at the kind of god you have hallelujah amen this is the god that you serve nothing escapes his vision and jesus is praying another prayer in matthew 6 he said lord let thy will be done on as it is where now what happened in heaven before when the devil taught these things god raised up an army in this army our generals do that so who's the person trying to disrupt the council of god here bringing this order to his kingdom oh it's me so he to raise up his army and he went from india to india hey i'm setting up a little army you want to join us i got some plans we're going to get over this thing one angel say yup he go to the next one hey no man what's going on here one say yes one say no wha and when the battle happened do you know who was victorious he was at the angel michael was victorious and he cast down the dragon so from the beginning he's a loser i go back to his track record the guy lost in the beginning so my question is i want to know who made him lose because i want to be on that team but the question is you don't put yourself on that team you were always on that team [Applause] and jesus said let that will be done on earth as it is in heaven amen and the bible says for god so loved the world he came down he didn't stay in heaven because if you stay in heaven what kind of love is that you know my wife is in cameroon i met her i was talking to my mom on the phone the video thing and she just kind of passed in the background i said who's that like seven years ago i said who's that again say well it's one sister i told my little brother said babe you got to get her number you say what i said yup you said well she's kind of hard to talk to she's very serious i say oh that's good you get that number for me after a hard struggle like a week text came in i got the number i said oh yeah so i start texting the sister like bible verses god is love [Laughter] [Applause] you know you want you want to act religious though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death that's not what's going to convince your sister brother tell him what's on your heart don't be using the word of god for your fake proposition you already have a thing in your mind you're thinking to do you're gonna put the word of god first you know and then she texts me with a verse too psalms 91 i said well it looks like we can get along i text the bible verse you take a bible verse so now can i talk to you oh yeah and we start talking six years just talking jose was what's up love what's up what's up what's up what's up so why after six years she said hey brother i appreciate you you good man i love you but hey time's kind of running out it's been six years what do you think about it what's your plan says sister it doesn't look like you're going anywhere because i want to marry you she look at me like you want to marry me i said hold on let me let me let me just think about that for a minute so i went home and i got me a little ring i said i gotta do this right i'm not over there so i gotta make it such a way that she can at least have a memory how to propose to her you know so i got it set up i stuck that ring under the box and i covered it up i bought some things for her set it on the box sent it home i said when you open it call me now don't open this thing without calling me she said okay three o'clock in the morning she's going through the stuff and then she just took the box oh this is so cute she put the ball i said don't throw the box away she said but there's nothing in here and then the box came fell down she said what i said can i marry you you say oh yeah but now look i was still here she was still there it wasn't palpable wasn't real so one day i told my job i said job i've made some promises to a young lady in cameroon can i get a little vacation time so i can go see her they say oh yeah we watch you suffer over here we're gonna send you home take three weeks go get married i say lord thank you so when i'm getting home i see a long text in my phone or what if you get here and you change your mind what if you don't think you think i'm i'm too short what if i was with him i told him i said man does he think i'm crazy i'm leaving my job i travel 18 hours on the flight i paid 1200 for the ticket just to come joking around he said man hold on let's get home first i said okay okay so we got home and i see her do you think my heart changed my feelings dropped no because i didn't love her for what she looked like there was something within her that drew me now she's pretty i won't tell you that very beautiful but that's not what caught my eye yeah something about her was genuine something about her was real yes so when i look at her i said what's your name again i'm just kidding and we got married but do you think that love would have been real if i stay here every day i love you i love you i love you no sir i had to prove that i loved her and because god loved you he had to come down to look for you and when he come down he begins to look for some people that he knew before he begins to walk around recruiting an army amen because with his winning team before they overcame so he's got to get those folks on his team but the thing is some of these folks that were on the street living wrong some of these folks were gone out then they're taking the ways of the world some of these folks were shooting up drugs some of these folks were going to church and they never changed their lives do you think he said now we're just going to switch around we'll just change teams one day one of his team players came by and fell on his feet lord they're about to stone me and he look around he said is there anybody here don't have no scene you got it right do it the deacon kind of went back and she looked like the deacon is going away so got sins too yep and then the pasta even the pasta and then the only person that could condemn her she was just waiting for him to say something he said woman thy sins which many forgiven thee go sin no more lest the worst thing come upon you he just joined that team hallelujah praise god brother peter's over there catching his fish he just come by and say he was your brother follow me he didn't preach five hours he just told them two words follow me they left everything i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus why would you follow somebody you don't know the prophet said he went to a junkyard one of his friends was showing him some how the junkyard works he said his friend put a big magnet going over all the cars like this and the cars begin to magnetize hallelujah and as they magnetize i want you to note the order of magnetizing one car get magnetized the next car gets magnetized on the next car and they get magnetized and magnetized and magnetized but there was one car that they didn't get out of the ground you know why did that one come out of there he said oh that one's got a big bolt like this and it's bolted down to the earth that one has gotten the influence of the god of this evil age and just feels happy around here but those ones that know they're not from here man they're just magnetizing they just go in but why are they magnetizing because in them they have a capacity to be magnetized in them they have a property that makes them to be magnetizable now in you there is something that made you answer yes to the word of god now if in the victory over there there was overcoming in the victory here what would they be for those who are on the winning team because jesus said this the bible says he shall be called emmanuel god with us but do you think that was his only happiness just come and be with us he knew there was going to be a battle and him just being with us wasn't sufficient that's how i'm going to be in them he comes and dwells in the believer that's why he said greater is he that is inside of you than the one in this battle there's somebody inside of you that has overcome the world and the only reason why you overcome is because it's inside of you and brother david said this morning terry wait for him ask him for it it is yours there was a victory we'll close before brought a job and then we closed i don't want to lie again i said we'll close before help me but somebody's pulling what can i do where a job comes to the world rich man everybody knows him the bible says the young people bow to him when he passed they bound to build a job and then one day the devil has to go and beg for permission god was even boasting about job to the devil and he tells the devil have you considered my servant job so he's god who put job in trouble but you understand why god put him in trouble so god the devil said no you have protected his house do you know even job's cows were protected the bible said you have put a hedge around him but even his cows his car his cats everything because they belong to him were protected son god of god you're not any kind of a person then the devil asked for permission to take off the hedge and i will show you he god took off the hedge he took away his children the cattle everything and then when he gets all the news so he's not even finished digesting one news they bring the next news your camels your sheep your cows all your children job just stands up said the lord has given the lord has taken blessed be his holy name how do you think his father felt i mean the one up there i don't mean he's heaven he's how do you think god felt i told the devil say let me touch him because those are his belongings that's not job those are his halves i want to touch him he said touch his body but don't touch his life so the question is is the body more important than the life and the prophet said a man that weighs about 120 pounds he's about 89 cents now you put a hundred dollar suit on 89 cents you see and then you sometimes stick your nose up in the air if it rains you're gonna drown on 89 cents so even your clothes that you wear they're worth more than your body if they had to sell you amen but the man that lives inside of you do you know his value ten thousand word he said what shall he profit the man to gain the world now let's assume the world is seven 000 trillion zillion billion now it still takes 10 000 of them for your one soul but we are in this world but that inside mind let's watch him and god said touch his body but don't touch him because job is just living in that tabernacle that's not job you're seeing now i'm seeing my brother here when i call him is the life in him that answers me because if i pass away and i'm laying here you come and call me i'm not gonna answer you why because the life within me is not there and the devil afflicted his body now he was scratching his body with pieces of clay has anybody had to do that no we all fine we got ac we got everything we don't need that but look at what he went through and while he was going through this now his mind begins to work and here what he says curse be the day i was born so when he can rewind backward that's as far back as he can go so that's where his memory ends in the unwinding just be the day i left my mother's womb why was i even born then when he goes forward he said let me even die because when i die it's over and then he began to look at how he said but when the plants die and they're cut apart they come back to life i've got to know when i go by the graveyard i haven't seen nobody come out yet but what happens to the man when he dies so something within him wanted to go far beyond death and see kind of what's after that but when he rewinds and goes backward he stops at birth so he cursed the day he was born and desired to die so it'd be over then god comes down when he's suffering i thought god would say oh he's suffering i gotta help him out let me just heal him is that what god said he says stand up like a man tie your lawns i will answer you ask your questions and you will answer me so maybe he comes just stood up and said maybe it's going to be something that i've kind of dealt with before let's kind of find out and then god begin to question brother john hallelujah somebody already said the question he asked him a bunch of ques questions and then he begins to ask him about his origins hey where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth so when i do my rewind i got my date of birth and that's it but he's taking me when the foundations of the earth's been laid can remember he said do you know who set the limits of the sea hush now we are talking about your god and my god then he keeps asking him questions then he asks you one question hallelujah he said where were you when the sons of god rejoiced when i laid the foundations of the earth so when god was laying those foundations somebody was saying hallelujah now who was it [Applause] but the prophet has told you that when you take that journey a hundred million years back you were just setting god so when god was putting those foundations there was somebody screaming hallelujah glory be to god what he said let there be light there was somebody that said hallelujah glory be to god [Applause] that's even before the devil was cast out of hell so if you go all the way back in bro begin to say what so some people were there rejoicing and god let him know brother job you were there we are in a heavenly celebration so you begin to look in that ah say but there's somebody back there look like me there's somebody saying a man right there kind of look like me but he don't have no ulcers on him he's not crying he's not cursing the day he was born he's just rejoicing all right so the confession begin to kind of change there i know my redeemer liver hell man is it even if the worms eat this body not with the pastor's eyes not with the deacon's eyes with my own eyes i will see god and brother but i'm saying the book of job is the oldest book in the bible and when job got the revelation of where he came from oh brother his confession changed amen no he won't cry no more now he won he said no wash the snow and free from all seed how we shall and i will see when the redeem [Music] isaac was still in his father jacob was still in in in his father but when god told him he said your seed shall possess all the gates of his enemies now they were declared overcomers when they were not yet born hallelujah they were declared victorious when they were not yet born let me close this book so i don't continue close everything amen a young man in tennessee his mama loved him and raised him in the church to serve the lord then he gets a problem said bad company corrupts good manners and he gets into the world and he catches a social disease but his mama knew how to shake heaven she used god's telephone verbum calls it neology they don't teach this in college the mama used neology she began to call on god all night lord god here's my son i'm like that woman in the bible lord but where's your prophet elijah so god begin to locate brother he's got to catch his flight he tells him walk but lord i walk left right left right and the mama when she catches the vision god shows her the prophet when she sees him she just walks outside said at three o'clock in the morning setting there by faith she has not seen nothing yet but she's already positioned herself the prophet said she was sweating on her back from sitting there so long and when she saw him she gave him his id how you doing parson how you normal person he told me last night i was praying and he told me he was coming said do you know that woman in the bible and he begin to begin to tell him amen he said i asked him and i told him i said lord here i am where is your elijah saying he showed me you coming with your the way you dressed and you had on so he realized he was not in a vision but he was not the one that saw it it was that mama that had seen it because he was used to being asked the question everybody how do you know now he's they want to ask you how do you know and when they go in the room that boy on that bed was part of the army of god he was a recruit but he didn't know he said let's pray he said when she prayed i had never heard somebody praying like that he said i did need to pray long and the boy said there's light in the room there's light in the room mama this light because that young man was part of the army of god now when did you become an overcomer when did you overcome amen now if you can't trace it by the word of god you have peace in your heart because it's not your choosing it's god choosing yes and if god overcame the first time this time too he will overcome the devil but the prophet was speaking the message he said god wants to glorify himself through us when brother paul saul was persecuting the people i loved this very much when he was persecuting the people and he gets to the way to damascus when he sees the pillar fire and he falls down to the ground when he says lord who are you and the prophet tells us he cannot call that light lord unless he knew it was the lord because he was instructed in the law of israel and he knew that the pillar of fire that led israel out of egypt was that same pill of fire right there and he asked him who are you give me your id do you know what he told him he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting huh i thought jesus was already gone to heaven he said those people that you think are castaways that's me i am jesus whom you persecute so you were saying here who are you it's good to look back and say no that was for the time that paul was doing it now right now who are you i believe the world has answered you tonight and has shown you where you came from to let you know this is not our home we are just passing through but where we came from we were victorious and right now we are not going to lose that's what the bible said in isaiah no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against me in judgment i shall condemn for this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me thus saith the lord he finished it up for now i was about to forget it he said thus saith the lord now that's for you that's your portion from the word of god and bible said we cannot come out losers he said we're not going to lose anyway so then what do you have to worry about that's just singing a short song as we uh bow our hearts and our heads and pray i sing that song in moments like these as we ask the blessing of the lord don't you love the word of god doesn't it give you peace in your heart it just takes away the worry it takes away the anxiety it takes away the cares it takes away everything because all it takes is just for god to show it to you to reveal it to you and that's it [Music] and that's his desire to reveal himself to us that's what he sent us the message for to reveal himself to us to make himself real to us don't you love him this new year's let's just stand as we sing that song before we pray eight more moments to jesus [Music] is [Music]

with him i'll feast i'll show him where he come from showing where he belongs and what he's done did you feel that built your faith tonight amen do you think it was a really good example of the attitude and the nature that she we'd walk and i hope there along with the joy of the lord and the beauty of hearing the word of god i hope a little bit of conviction comes on our heart when we're all locked up and we're all afraid you know and we live in the past when the whole future is open to us i just like to read that one statement again that's the god of this age smart wise scientific it needs no faith but we need faith amen we need to believe you know imperfect faith brother branham said that the lord jesus believed what the word of god said he was he says can't we believe who the word of god says we are amen i thought he really took us all the way back to the beginning do you believe it amen it ought to put a smile on your face amen let's stand tonight i certainly believe appreciate that word i appreciate it that the feeling and the attitude that it creates in me it it makes me want to go out and believe something makes me want to believe all the word of god it makes me want to see god manifested in the flesh makes me want to pray for those who are home i thought his testimony of of the virus was just wonderful you know it wasn't didn't do no devastating like they thought it would do didn't put it on nobody everybody came in contact was well and he overcame that should be our attitude amen i really appreciate let's bow our heads this evening i know we're standing but maybe you'd like to use a little neology right now to lift the partition up to the lord something that you're desiring i heard the prayer request for josh going into the air force and and in my heart my heart leapt for joy i just thought it was such a good thing for him and that something really wonderful is going to come out of it and i just want to ask the lord if he would go with him and the things that the lord has prepared for him would just surround his life and and he would in this time of training that he would just receive something and call upon the lord i know he loves the lord and i know he has a tender heart so i want to ask the lord to go with him the brothers in our congregation at our home and they're going through the headaches and the backaches and as this flu passes its way we ask the lord to protect our congregation that we're not afraid of it because of god before us who can be against us and we serve a god that healeth of all our diseases and nothing could come upon us that the lord already hasn't made a provision we want to remember all them in prayer and most of all we don't want the spiritual side of this virus to take hold the lord said in his word there's neither bond nor free junior greek male nor female but we are all christs in christ is god's and we rest in that heavenly father the congregation is before you now their hands are raised in the air but above their hands their hearts are lifted to you and they have many petitions father that they're laying [Music] at the throne loved ones financial circumstances [Music] relationships and the many complications of life but as we've heard tonight if god be for us who can be against us my sheep know my voice and another they won't follow and i'll not forsake you but i'll be with you even in you till the end and if i started a work i'll finish it lord we've heard those promises tonight and so we boldly come before you lord knowing that you'll keep us that you'll work all things together for the good to them who are called according to your purpose and we rest in that tonight father and we ask that you would answer these great petitions that have been put before you and then we won't go father they won't your work and your love and your accomplishment won't go unnoticed in fact we'll testify to it we'll tell the world how you delivered and how you answered prayer that others might take hope also that they might know they can call upon this living god a real living god that hears the prayers of his saints and they might know there's still hope in this world for them that have an ear to hear we ask father that you bring the last one in that you set the captive free that you bring our children in and our loved ones in our associates in father bring all in that are yours we long and we look up for your soon return we ask you to be with us tonight father thank you for the word thank you for the words of encouragement thank you for the understanding of our great peer destination thank you for the encouragement of the victory that we already possess lord we just ask that you would be mighty on behalf of these petitions in jesus
