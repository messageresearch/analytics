Description:
Christian Life Tabernacle
December 30th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

You may be seated. It is a joy for me to take part in this wedding ceremony of Clever Aaron Mccori and Fallon Rebecca. participa. I thank Pastor David Mguri of Christian Life Tabernacle for asking me to perform the ceremony in English and in French. Pastor David France. I have known Rebecca and her family for several years in Switzerland. I had the privilege of baptizing her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and being her pastor. We have appreciated her seriousness and dedication in her walk with Lord Jesus. We have seen her grow in the faith. Rebecca introduced me to Clever after meeting him in the States in 2024. before I had some enjoyable chats with him on the phone and found him to be a very congenial and spiritual man who loves the word of God. originally from Zimbabwe. He has grown spiritually under the ministry of pastor David Mgari for several years. Zimbabwe David. After much prayer, they felt it was God's perfect will for them to unite their lives in holy matrimony on this day. They are surrounded by their parents, family members, friends, brothers and sisters in Christ here and in Zimbabwe, Switzerland, France. Brother Clever's father and siblings are streaming the ceremony from Zimbabwe. Thank you for coming. France Zimbabwe mercy. They want to build a strong marriage founded on the word of God with the Lord Jesus Christ in the center of their home. We pray that the love of God will seal the union today. If there is anyone here that can show a just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony. Do you now speak or from hereafter forever hold your peace. I will require and will charge you both as you will surely answer at the day of judgment when and the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. If there is either of you that knows any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony, do you now confess it? For be it assured unto you that any couple that is joined otherwise then God's word do that allow their marriage is not lawful. Mountain Nepa valid. Every wedding is beautiful. Do you agree with me? Everyone is welldressed. The flowers they flur, the smiles, the joy, the excitement lexit as Christians, it makes us think about the greatest wedding ceremony ever. the marriage of the Lord Jesus Christ and his bride. The Bible speaks of it. It says that blessed are those who have been called to this marriage. Jesus told us how to prepare ourselves for this great event. In Revelation 21:9, we read, "And there came unto me one of the seven angels, which had the seven vials full of the seven plagues, and talked with me, and saying, Come hither. I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife." The apocalypse enough. For the two to become one, they have to be compatible. Compatible means to be able to exist and perform in an harmonious and agreeable combination. Brother Brham describes to us the lamb nature. It forfeits its rights. It gives what it has. It doesn't fight in a surreners. It's humble. A lamb can only marry a hu lamb. The bride will marry Christ the lamb. She will not marry the lion. Even though Christ is also the lion of the tribe of Judah. But when the Bible speaks about heavenly spiritual marriage spiritual, it speaks about the lamb, Christ the lamb marrying his wife. So please remember that Marriage is a union of two compatible natures. And God is working with each one of us to mold into us the lamb, the lamb's nature. He has to humble us. He has to break us and fill us with the divine nature. Can you say amen to that? It's a wedding ceremony, but uh we are Christians. We want to uh to express what we believe. Amen. This spiritual marriage has to last for eternity. &gt;&gt; Christ cannot make a mistake. It is sealed with divine agape love which is eternal eternal. Agape love is unconditional agape like the marriage covenant. It is stable doesn't have ups and downs. Stable. Do we need it? Oh God help us. It has no beginning and no end. It is not selfish in a posist. It is altruistic. Altruist. It expresses God's characteristics. Characteristic the Jew. The marriage of Clever and Rebecca is a type of the marriage of Christ and his bride. Clever. We pray that clever will be a worthy representation of Christ for Rebecca. Clever and Rebecca, a worthy representation of the bride for clever represent clever. Marriage is more than a wedding. Amen. In English you have two words, wedding, marriage, wedding and marriage. But a wedding is just a ceremony. But marriage is a union of two different people becoming one again to be complimentary And this is something I learned from the message of the hour. The Bible says that in the very beginning, God created one human being. And that human being who was in his image and after his likeness, he had both the masculine and the feminine attributes in one body. The rest of the animals came by pairs. But when God made someone in his image, he made one being who had the characteristics of both. And what did God do according to the Bible? God put Adam to sleep and while he was sleeping, he pulled out of him the feminate attributes and he put them in a separate body. And when Adam woke up here stood in front of him, someone looking like him. It was his other half. And Adam under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he said, "She is flesh of my flesh. bone of my bones. Amen. To me, this is the beauty of a marriage according to the will of God. And then these two had to become one again. They were one, they were separated and they became one again. That's the way I I understand it. Oh, it's so beautiful. What God does is perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you agree? &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. It is a soulmating. It is the beginning of a lifong process. V on this day they're officially getting married in the presence of God and of this company but the real union. It will take a lifetime. In the home of brother David and sister Julia, I was watching Sister Lilian putting together a 1,000piece puzzle. Think about it. A thousand pieces. There were many options. But which piece is compatible with which? I've been watching her the last few days. It takes time, a lot of time, patience, and perseverance. Perseverance. God is the mastermind who knows which piece has to go with which piece. God makes no mistake. So is it in the body of Christ and the function of each member. Marriage is a challenge. Amen. As beautiful as it is, he broke his word. It is a challenge. It's taking a big big step of faith. Probably this is why many don't even marry anymore. They are afraid is so taking a big step of faith as no one but God knows the future. That is why it's so important to pray earnestly about it. And when God gives the okay, the revelation, we can go ahead and God will make it work. Psalm 37:4 says, "Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give you the desires of your heart. They can be two great persons on the outside. I've watched Sister Rebecca. She's a wonderful lady. For me, I've got to to meet and to know a bit rather clever. But a good man he is. Don't they look good? I know. And they are gifted. They are very skilled in in their field. God has blessed them, you know, in in their work. But once married, will their hearts beat in unison for the rest of their lives? People can have beautiful wedding ceremonies. It's more than the ceremony. Marriage creates a synergy to express each person's potential. May I give a little testimony to the glory of God? you. 55 years ago, God took a young Christian man in Switzerland, 20 years old, and sent him to Tucson, Arizona, to learn more about the message of the hour brought by God's end time prophet, William Brham. William Brana. Shortly after his arrival, God brought into the church he was in, a young Catholic lady, 18 years old. Right away the Lord started dealing with her immediate. She surrendered her life to Jesus Christ, was born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. This young man had started to translate the film The Deep Calling to the Deep, but he was hindered by certain American expressions he had not learned at school. This young lady had just graduated. It was the summer holiday. Having studied French for four years, she offered to help him translate the film. film. Four months later, they got married and are still married 55 years later. and record the message in French. Isn't it God's predestination? His grace, his workmanship, it's possible. Now, let's look at clever. born in Zimbabwe and moving to the states Zimbabwe. Rebecca born in Congo and moving to Switzerland. They met two years ago and were attracted to each other. Was it God or just human feelings? Today they are standing here to be married. They have human love for each other. It is selfish. It is fragile, selfish and shortlasting. Fragile, egoist. But the Holy Spirit brings divine agape love. It lasts forever. It is unselfish. It is the bond to perfection. &gt;&gt; We pray it will seal the union forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; The strength and durability of their marriage. I repeat, the strength and durability of their marriage will depend upon their personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. Our love, prayers and support will accompany them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will you pray for them? &gt;&gt; Will you encourage them? &gt;&gt; Will you support them? &gt;&gt; They will need you. Is wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; You agree? You agree? We need one another more than ever before. Okay, clever. W thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony with thou? Love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both both shall live. Clever. Amen. Rebecca, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband to live together after God's ordance in the holy estate of matrimony? Would thou obey and serve him? Love, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him so long as he both shall live. Amen. The couple will now exchange devours as we stand before God, the author of marriage. Jesus said that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. God's prophet said, "Here is when you are really married. You are married when you vow one to the other. When you promise one another that you'll take one another. As far as married, when you promise her, she takes your word, you take her word, and God takes both your word. Prophet accept you accept. except Jesus also said, "Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven." For the sake of the French-speaking congregation, I will tell the vows in French first, then in English. Mayor, I clever take thee, Rebecca. I clever take the Rebecca &gt;&gt; to be my wed wife &gt;&gt; to be my wed wife. &gt;&gt; To have and to hold from this day forward. &gt;&gt; To have and to hold from this day forward. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse. &gt;&gt; For richer, for poorer, &gt;&gt; for richer and for poorer. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; In sickness and in health. &gt;&gt; To love, to cherish, and to trust. &gt;&gt; To love, to cherish, and to trust. Till death us do part &gt;&gt; till death do us part &gt;&gt; according to God's holy ordinance &gt;&gt; according to God's holy ordinance &gt;&gt; and thereto I pledge my faithfulness &gt;&gt; and thereto I pledge my faithfulness I Rebecca take thee clever. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; to be my wed husband &gt;&gt; to be my wed husband &gt;&gt; to have and to hold from this day forward. to this faith. &gt;&gt; For better, for worse, &gt;&gt; for better, for worse, &gt;&gt; for richer, for poorer, &gt;&gt; for richer, &gt;&gt; in sickness and in health, &gt;&gt; in sickness and in health, &gt;&gt; to love, to cherish, and to trust &gt;&gt; to love and to cherish and to trust. &gt;&gt; Till death do us part &gt;&gt; according to God's holy ordinance. And there I pledge my faithfulness. &gt;&gt; I pledge my faithfulness. &gt;&gt; I will require a token. These rings are circular. It's a symbol of eternity. So you can take hers. Please repeat these words as you put the ring on her finger. No. I give thee this ring. &gt;&gt; I give thee this ring &gt;&gt; as a token of my love. &gt;&gt; as a token of my love &gt;&gt; and of my faithfulness. &gt;&gt; and of my faithfulness.

Let us pray together for this couple. Our precious Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible says that God is love. Real love, eternal love. There's no greater love than God's love. And Lord, we stand here as witnesses of this ceremony of this marriage. The ceremony as we see Clever and Rebecca expressing their commitment one to the other. Clever.
