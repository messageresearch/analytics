[2:26] wonderful thing nice to have everybody
[2:29] out this evening we had a a Sunday
[2:32] School uh uh sermon this morning
[2:35] wonderful about the Great Eagle and how
[2:38] we're Eagles and how we can set our
[2:41] wings to fly and I guess tonight we're
[2:43] moving it up to a little older young
[2:47] people I guess there's nobody here old
[2:50] enough to get it to where I am so uh I'm
[2:53] just gonna be all things to all men and
[2:57] and just receive the wonderful blessings
[3:00] of the Lord you love the Lord amen amen
[3:03] you know even if you don't he loves you
[3:07] and he can woo you and and come along as
[3:10] our brother said he said he Broods over
[3:14] you you know and and brooding is to give
[3:17] attention to something and nurture it
[3:21] because you have an intended result and
[3:24] the Holy Spirit can come and brood over
[3:26] you tonight you might not even want him
[3:28] to and you might be fighting God but
[3:31] he'll just come around and wrap those
[3:34] Arms Of Love around you and start
[3:35] brooding you and pretty soon you know
[3:38] what you'll find out you'll find out
[3:40] he's worth it all he's more than
[3:43] precious he's wonderful amen so let's
[3:46] stand together tonight we turn the
[3:49] service over to brother Billy and and uh
[3:54] so you know have faith tonight believe
[3:58] don't be afraid to ask
[4:00] you know you might think it's foolish
[4:02] but ask whatever's on your heart because
[4:06] he said that he'd give you the desire of
[4:08] your heart and he said you know people
[4:10] don't have because they don't ask and he
[4:14] said ask believing you say you know you
[4:17] don't know what the result might be or
[4:19] how he'll do it he never asked you to
[4:22] figure out how he was going to do it he
[4:25] asked two things one it's your heart's
[4:28] desire another words you want it done
[4:32] and two you believe that he is God and
[4:35] he's able to do what he promised he's
[4:39] able to perform what you ask there's
[4:42] nothing too hard for him so if you have
[4:45] a desire tonight a question whatever it
[4:47] is you believe God and God will answer

[50:04] entered right in and I just feel real at
[50:07] home and so I appreciate a meeting where
[50:10] they're asking the Holy Spirit to have
[50:13] control and so we're just trying to
[50:16] relax here this evening we'll go
[50:18] straight to the scriptures if we can
[50:21] turn to Romans chapter 8 I appreciate it
[50:23] musicians God bless you
[50:25] and I would like to start with Romans um
[50:30] chapter
[50:40] 8 Romans chapter
[50:45] 8 and we'll start with verse
[50:49] one everybody
[50:53] there there's the therefore now no
[50:57] condemnation Amen to them which are in
[51:00] Christ
[51:02] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[51:06] after the
[51:07] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[51:11] in Christ
[51:12] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[51:17] sin and
[51:18] death for what the law could not do in
[51:22] that it was weak through the flesh God
[51:25] sending his son in the likeness of
[51:29] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[51:34] in the
[51:36] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[51:39] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[51:42] after the flesh but after the
[51:46] spirit for they that are of the flesh do
[51:49] mind the things of the
[51:51] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[51:55] the things of the spirit for to be
[51:58] carnally minded is death but to be
[52:01] spiritually minded is life and
[52:04] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[52:07] against God for it shall not for it is
[52:11] not subject to the law of God neither
[52:15] indeed can
[52:18] be so then they that are in the flesh
[52:22] cannot please God but you are not not in
[52:25] the
[52:26] flesh but in the
[52:28] spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell
[52:32] in you right and if any man have not the
[52:34] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[52:37] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[52:41] because of sin but the but the spirit is
[52:44] life because of
[52:46] righteousness and if the spirit of him
[52:49] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[52:53] in you he that raised rais Christ from
[52:56] the dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[52:59] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[53:03] you I would like to preach tonight on
[53:05] the law of the spirit of life and I
[53:08] would like to subtitle this this evening
[53:11] two
[53:12] [Music]
[53:13] laws if you have a need you'd like to
[53:15] lift before the Lord you just raise it
[53:18] to God God sees your hand he knows your
[53:20] need God cares for your need let's go to
[53:24] the Lord in prayer
[53:25] Lord
[53:26] Jesus Lord we have done everything we
[53:30] know to welcome you in this
[53:33] place the songs have been sung worship
[53:37] Lord from our hearts and Lord we thank
[53:40] you for an opportunity to come in your
[53:43] presence and I pray Lord God As We
[53:46] Gather in faith dear God that the
[53:48] darkness will begin to
[53:50] disperse and Lord that life that the
[53:53] Holy Spirit Will begin to move among our
[53:56] hearts Lord draw us closer to you and I
[54:00] pray dear God that you meet every need
[54:02] every hand that was lifted I pray God
[54:05] you supply everything we have need of
[54:08] God we love you from the bottom of our
[54:09] hearts we ask these things in Jesus name
[54:13] amen God bless you you can have your
[54:19] seats thank you brother thank you so
[54:23] much brother brandham taught us that sin
[54:27] did not originate in the Garden of
[54:30] Eden but that rather sin had originated
[54:33] in
[54:35] heaven and I I would not even be able to
[54:38] describe what the Angelic Wars look like
[54:42] as we know that there were Angel Angelic
[54:46] Wars between Michael and Satan and there
[54:49] was angels I I could only imagine what
[54:52] war in heaven would look like but we do
[54:55] know that Michael had cast out
[54:59] Lucifer and brother brandham said when
[55:02] Luther L Lucifer was cast out Angelic
[55:07] War became human
[55:09] battles and Satan came into this place
[55:13] to kill to steal and to
[55:17] destroy and now there are two governing
[55:20] Powers there are only two powers that is
[55:24] God's power
[55:25] and Satan's power there is life and
[55:29] death and we're in a battle right here
[55:32] tonight amen how many can say amen amen
[55:36] and we know here if you will pull up
[55:38] that first slide I've got a lot of
[55:41] scripture so if you will just stay right
[55:43] with me tonight it says here wherefore
[55:46] as by one man sin entered into the world
[55:50] and death by
[55:52] sin so death passed upon all men for all
[55:58] have
[55:59] sinned so Satan gained control of the
[56:03] earth through sin right and Satan is the
[56:06] author of sin he is the author of
[56:10] sickness he is the author of disease
[56:12] he's the author of confusion he is the
[56:16] Prince of Darkness he is the father of
[56:21] lies he's full of perversion there's he
[56:25] is only death he's the author of
[56:29] death and from the scripture the law of
[56:33] sin and death came into the human
[56:36] race can you say amen amen next slide
[56:40] please The Sting of death is
[56:44] sin and the strength of sin is the
[56:49] law that sounds a little strange but to
[56:54] to to get a an understanding or a grasp
[56:56] of this where there is no law there is
[56:59] no
[57:00] transgression that's right but when God
[57:03] brought a holy law what it did was it
[57:07] showed us we were
[57:09] transgressors that's right and the law
[57:11] brought sin into view and When sin come
[57:15] into the view the law brought death to
[57:18] the human race because God is
[57:22] just and a law without pen Y is not so
[57:27] if there was a law then there must be a
[57:30] penalty to it and that penalty condemned
[57:34] everyone who was born in sin so the law
[57:38] that came from God condemned us and
[57:42] could not save us it was a
[57:45] policeman it it would put us in prison
[57:48] but it could not save us so how many
[57:52] remember on SI Mount Si when and God
[57:55] gave the law to Moses and bear with me
[57:57] follow me now and uh I'm I'm moving
[58:00] somewhere how many remember Sinai if you
[58:03] ever see the pictures the Bible said God
[58:06] thundered upon siai the whole place quak
[58:10] and and and not even an animal could
[58:13] touch the border of the mountain and and
[58:16] he said it'll be killed anything that
[58:18] touches the mountain it it was it was
[58:21] God's just
[58:23] law and the people begin to scream let
[58:26] us brother bam said it was God's
[58:29] judgment
[58:31] seat next
[58:33] slide and the Bible said we know that
[58:37] whatsoever things the law saith it saith
[58:41] to them that are under the law that
[58:44] every mouth may be stopped and all the
[58:49] world become guilty before God therefore
[58:53] by the Deeds of the law there shall no
[58:56] flesh be justified in his sight for by
[58:59] the law is the knowledge of
[59:03] sin so as good as the law was there was
[59:07] no salvation in it that we could never
[59:11] be saved by a law of God it only showed
[59:14] us our condition turn with me if you
[59:17] will got your Bibles let's turn to
[59:19] Romans chapter
[59:23] 7 praise the Lord
[59:27] amen say Amen when you find your places
[59:31] Romans chap 7 verse
[59:34] 7 he says what shall we say then is the
[59:38] law
[59:39] sin God
[59:41] forbid nay I had not known sin wrought
[59:45] in me all manner of co uh cence which is
[59:50] lust and without the law sin was dead in
[59:54] other other words he said the law was
[59:56] damning up the flood of my own sinful
[1:00:00] lust and and that law just caused it to
[1:00:03] swell meaning that the law the when the
[1:00:06] law said Thou shalt not my own lust rose
[1:00:09] up within me that's right and he said I
[1:00:13] was alive without the law once but when
[1:00:17] the Commandment came sin revived and I
[1:00:20] died and the Commandment which was
[1:00:23] ordained to life I found to be
[1:00:26] death wow for sin taking occasion by the
[1:00:31] Commandment deceive me and slew me
[1:00:35] wherefore the laws holy and the
[1:00:38] Commandment holy and just and good was
[1:00:42] then that which good is good made death
[1:00:46] unto me God
[1:00:48] forbid but sin that it might appear sin
[1:00:52] working death in Me by that that which
[1:00:54] is good that sin by the Commandment
[1:00:58] might become exceeding
[1:01:01] sinful everybody staying with me so now
[1:01:06] God's justice which is the law required
[1:01:11] blood and God's
[1:01:15] God's requirement was satisfied at
[1:01:20] Calvary Hallelujah and God by Grace
[1:01:25] cleansed away back into the heart of men
[1:01:29] is that right and that day at calary
[1:01:33] when Jesus when Jesus was crucified he
[1:01:37] paid the penalty for our sin he took the
[1:01:41] law upon he took the all of our sins
[1:01:44] upon Him amen see s through the entire
[1:01:48] creation into
[1:01:50] bondage it throwed Every Creature into
[1:01:53] bondage it threw every teenager into
[1:01:55] bondage it threw every man woman and
[1:01:58] child into bondage and we were wanders
[1:02:01] upon the Earth we were lost without God
[1:02:05] but that day at
[1:02:09] Calvary nobody could ever visit Calvary
[1:02:12] and be the
[1:02:14] same that's when God's law was
[1:02:17] satisfied that's when God's justice was
[1:02:21] satisfied and that's where Jesus brought
[1:02:24] a death blow to the power of
[1:02:27] Darkness Hallelujah brother Brenham said
[1:02:31] Satan's back was broken at
[1:02:34] Calvary every one of us was set free at
[1:02:38] Calvary Hallelujah do you believe that
[1:02:41] Jesus opened the prison doors at Calvary
[1:02:45] he set every man woman and child free at
[1:02:50] Calvary if you're ever going to be free
[1:02:53] it's because you will see Calvary and
[1:02:55] what had done for you if you're going to
[1:02:58] receive something from God tonight
[1:03:00] you'll be looking toward Calvary to get
[1:03:04] it if you want the Holy Ghost you got to
[1:03:06] look to Calvary if you want healing
[1:03:09] you've got to look to Calvary if you
[1:03:12] want Victory you've got to look to
[1:03:15] Calvary
[1:03:17] Hallelujah that's right because SI was
[1:03:21] the law of death but Calvary brought the
[1:03:24] law of
[1:03:26] Life
[1:03:28] Hallelujah Sinai condemned the entire
[1:03:31] race but Calvary liberated
[1:03:36] mankind do you see it and the blood of
[1:03:39] Jesus Christ remove sin which condemned
[1:03:43] every one of us so what is stronger
[1:03:47] light or
[1:03:49] Darkness a little bit of light can
[1:03:52] overcome a lot of Darkness
[1:03:55] what is stronger life or death
[1:03:59] Hallelujah life is stronger than death
[1:04:03] I'm preaching on two laws tonight
[1:04:06] because when Jesus died God put a word
[1:04:09] over him he will not stay in the
[1:04:12] grave and after one day two days on that
[1:04:16] third day no devil on Hell could hold
[1:04:19] him down death could not hold him the
[1:04:23] grave could would not hold him up he
[1:04:26] came by the law of the spirit of
[1:04:32] life because life is stronger than
[1:04:36] death and it was because Jesus word I
[1:04:39] will not leave my my my righteous one in
[1:04:43] hell and I want you now to be thinking
[1:04:46] about the spirit of life and I want to
[1:04:49] bring Old Testament examples to start
[1:04:52] with because every old test example is
[1:04:55] pointing to Calvary and Calvary is
[1:04:58] pointing to
[1:05:02] you and so in the scriptures we we see
[1:05:06] examples like the shunamite woman and
[1:05:09] you know how she was good to
[1:05:11] Elisha and she made a place for Elisha
[1:05:14] to stay and brother brandom said she
[1:05:16] refreshed him God
[1:05:18] serving and one day Elisha looked at
[1:05:21] gahaz and said what can we do for this
[1:05:22] woman who showed us such kindness he
[1:05:25] said they don't have a
[1:05:27] child and God used the man of God to
[1:05:30] tell her you're going to have a child
[1:05:32] and God bless that family with a child
[1:05:34] because she was good to God's
[1:05:37] representative and then about 12 years
[1:05:39] later the Bible said he was out with his
[1:05:42] daddy working and he began to scream my
[1:05:44] head my
[1:05:46] head and they took the the father told
[1:05:49] the servants go take the boy to his
[1:05:51] mother and the boy died right on her rap
[1:05:55] that was the power of
[1:05:58] death and that woman took that baby and
[1:06:02] she placed him on the bed where Elijah
[1:06:05] slept and laid his head and she said
[1:06:08] saddle an ass and she started to Mount
[1:06:11] Carmel to find God's
[1:06:14] representative and when Elija looked and
[1:06:17] he said Here Comes the shite God never
[1:06:20] told him what was
[1:06:22] happening and when she came he said is
[1:06:25] all well with your husband is all well
[1:06:28] with your home is all well with your
[1:06:30] child she said all is
[1:06:34] well because she was
[1:06:36] speaking faith in the word of
[1:06:42] God and she said I need you now to come
[1:06:46] and pray for my baby that's and and you
[1:06:49] know the story he gave his staff and he
[1:06:52] comes back to hael said the boy still
[1:06:54] dead and Elisha goes into the room and
[1:06:57] shuts the door now death the power of
[1:07:01] death took the child's
[1:07:04] life and Elisha laid upon the child and
[1:07:07] the Bible said his body got warm but he
[1:07:10] did not
[1:07:11] revive and the Bible said that Elija
[1:07:14] paced to and fro brother brandham said
[1:07:17] he was waiting on the Holy
[1:07:20] Spirit and when the Holy Spirit came the
[1:07:24] boy revived and the spirit of Life
[1:07:28] pushed back the spirit of death and the
[1:07:31] boy
[1:07:32] lived it was the law of the spirit of
[1:07:37] life we find that Elisha the same just a
[1:07:41] little while later there's another story
[1:07:44] of him where he uh there's dirt in the
[1:07:46] land and the people made a big pot to
[1:07:49] eat and they threw poison
[1:07:51] gourds into the pot
[1:07:55] and the people begin to eat it and they
[1:07:57] start screaming there's death in the pot
[1:08:00] there's death in the pot and Elisha said
[1:08:03] Don't Fear he took some meal and that
[1:08:06] meal was a type of Christ they ground
[1:08:09] that meal just like Christ was ground at
[1:08:12] Calvary and he threw that meal into the
[1:08:15] pot and it turned death into life
[1:08:19] because life is stronger than
[1:08:22] death how many believe that
[1:08:25] God is stronger than the
[1:08:27] devil the spirit of life is stronger
[1:08:30] than the spirit of
[1:08:32] death and then when Elisha died they put
[1:08:35] his bones into a seure and and a long
[1:08:39] time
[1:08:40] later A man was lowered in there in a
[1:08:43] time of War a man had died and they
[1:08:46] dropped him into the prophet seure and
[1:08:48] when he touched those bones he came back
[1:08:51] to life again because that was God's
[1:08:55] representative and he was representing
[1:08:58] life how many knows the gospel
[1:09:01] represents life how many appreciates the
[1:09:05] Lord God was still on those
[1:09:09] bones
[1:09:12] Hallelujah now the law of the spirit of
[1:09:14] Life Jesus never preached a
[1:09:18] funeral watch him watch The
[1:09:21] Gospel he never preaches a funeral ever
[1:09:25] there's a time he's tired and he's weary
[1:09:27] and he hears a widow cry and a woman
[1:09:30] crying and her son had died and they
[1:09:32] were packing him uh not in a closed
[1:09:34] casket but an open casket and his body
[1:09:37] is wrapped brother renam said he might
[1:09:39] have been dead for two
[1:09:40] days and he said that they come right by
[1:09:43] where Jesus was and he stopped it and he
[1:09:47] tells the man to rise and the grave
[1:09:50] clothes start moving and the boy sets up
[1:09:53] and he's brought back to life
[1:09:55] again because life is stronger than
[1:09:59] death how many believe that with all
[1:10:02] their
[1:10:02] hearts jeras had come he had he had run
[1:10:06] hotfooted it for three hours he found an
[1:10:09] audience with Jesus and said my daughter
[1:10:12] is is is dying I need you to come and
[1:10:14] lay your hands on her and Jesus said I
[1:10:16] will
[1:10:18] go and is there about halfway there a
[1:10:21] Runner comes and said troubl not the
[1:10:24] Master she's
[1:10:28] dead he starts quivering and
[1:10:31] shaking oh
[1:10:33] God God no and he looks at Jesus and
[1:10:38] Jesus doesn't
[1:10:39] Flinch he says only
[1:10:43] believe life was not shaken by it life
[1:10:47] was not driven back by life why uh life
[1:10:51] did not was not intimidated by
[1:10:56] it but she's dead but it's not
[1:11:00] over I don't care what you done it's not
[1:11:03] over because life is stronger than
[1:11:07] death brother brandham said he was calm
[1:11:10] and Collective because the word has a
[1:11:13] power to raise you out of addiction the
[1:11:17] word has a power to raise a man out of
[1:11:20] sin the word has a power to raise a man
[1:11:23] from
[1:11:24] Death to take a dead man and make him
[1:11:28] live
[1:11:29] again I was a dead man and God made me
[1:11:33] live
[1:11:36] again because the law of the spirit of
[1:11:40] Life Set Me
[1:11:44] Free
[1:11:46] hallelujah it's not over Hallelujah I
[1:11:49] don't care what you done it's not
[1:11:52] over
[1:11:54] Jesus marches to the house and the
[1:11:57] people are crying and Jesus said quit
[1:12:00] making such a fuss she's not dead she's
[1:12:03] only
[1:12:04] sleeping and they said what a false
[1:12:07] prophet we've embalmed her
[1:12:10] already yeah you know what Jesus did
[1:12:13] pushed him right out get out shut the
[1:12:17] door took Peter James and John and put
[1:12:21] Faith around him
[1:12:24] Hallelujah because something there's
[1:12:26] going to be a resurrection in here and
[1:12:28] we want all the unbelief to
[1:12:31] leave this girl's going to
[1:12:34] live God's going to turn the
[1:12:39] situation and he stood over the child
[1:12:41] without any whimp or worry will it
[1:12:44] happen and he commanded her
[1:12:48] rise brother brandham said way out in
[1:12:51] the Supernatural realm God Supernatural
[1:12:54] hand caught her spirit and brought it
[1:12:56] back into that
[1:12:58] body and that little girl opened her
[1:13:00] eyes he said feed
[1:13:03] her because the law of the spirit of
[1:13:07] life is greater than the spirit of
[1:13:12] death if your
[1:13:14] soul ever comes in
[1:13:17] contact with the Living God it'll raise
[1:13:21] your thinking it'll raise you from the
[1:13:24] dead it'll turn you
[1:13:28] around but they just have to have
[1:13:33] contact Brother bam said the life that
[1:13:35] was in Christ came back upon the sinner
[1:13:38] the repented Sinner and that Jesus
[1:13:42] perfect life was given for us how many
[1:13:45] believe that he it so we could go free
[1:13:50] and the spirit of life of Jesus Christ
[1:13:53] makes us free from the law of sin and
[1:13:58] death turn with me or I'm sorry pull it
[1:14:01] up next
[1:14:02] slide now watch this Romans
[1:14:05] 81 pay very close
[1:14:08] attention there is this is our opening
[1:14:11] scripture there is therefore now no
[1:14:16] condemnation say it with me no
[1:14:20] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:14:22] Jesus
[1:14:24] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:14:28] the spirit for the law of the spirit of
[1:14:31] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[1:14:35] from the law of
[1:14:37] sin and death praise the Lord isn't that
[1:14:42] wonderful you're a free
[1:14:44] creature you are a free creature tonight
[1:14:47] am I want you to say I'm a free creature
[1:14:51] a free creature amen you say but I'm a
[1:14:55] Christian and I find myself when I
[1:14:58] should be experiencing the fullness of
[1:15:00] joy when I should be experiencing
[1:15:04] blessed peace and Assurance of God I why
[1:15:08] am I
[1:15:11] struggling why if it's so Victorious and
[1:15:15] so
[1:15:17] powerful why in the
[1:15:20] world you would think I'd be the
[1:15:22] happiest person on Earth but why am I
[1:15:26] struggling I've renounced the world I
[1:15:30] love the Lord Jesus but it just seems
[1:15:33] like what's
[1:15:35] wrong have you ever felt that way my
[1:15:38] mind is bombarding and and I seem to
[1:15:41] constantly be struggling I feel ashamed
[1:15:45] and condemned when the Bible said there
[1:15:47] is no
[1:15:51] condemnation what's hindering my life
[1:15:54] have you ever been there let's look at
[1:15:57] it real close that next slide there this
[1:16:00] is Romans 7 now
[1:16:03] watch for when we were in the
[1:16:07] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[1:16:11] the law did work in our
[1:16:14] members to bring forth fruit unto
[1:16:17] death but now we are delivered from the
[1:16:21] law that being dead wherein we were held
[1:16:25] that we should serve in the newness of
[1:16:28] the spirit and not in the
[1:16:31] oldness of the letter and what Paul is
[1:16:34] saying here is we cannot be Christians
[1:16:38] in the
[1:16:39] flesh if we're going to be Christians we
[1:16:42] must be Christians of the
[1:16:46] spirit can you say amen amen the law of
[1:16:50] sin and death is in our members
[1:16:53] it's in our body we are still subject to
[1:16:57] old age we are still subject to sickness
[1:17:01] we are still subject to death but God
[1:17:04] has redeemed the
[1:17:07] soul salvation is not complete yet our
[1:17:11] souls have been redeemed but we are
[1:17:13] waiting on new bodies and Satan will
[1:17:16] afflict the body in order to discourage
[1:17:20] you to make you doubt and to tempt you
[1:17:24] we will receive a body that is not
[1:17:27] subject to temptation but now we are
[1:17:30] subject to Temptation now the devil hits
[1:17:33] the weak
[1:17:34] spot and there is a war between the
[1:17:37] carnal nature and the spirit man
[1:17:42] amen turn with me Romans 7 verse
[1:17:48] 14
[1:17:50] Hallelujah stay right with me now
[1:17:53] Romans 7:14 everybody
[1:17:57] there for we
[1:17:59] know that the law is
[1:18:02] spiritual verse
[1:18:05] 14 but I am carnal
[1:18:08] sold under
[1:18:11] sin for that which I do I allow not for
[1:18:15] what I would that I do do I not but what
[1:18:20] I hate that I do
[1:18:24] if then I do that which I would not I
[1:18:27] consent unto the law that it is good but
[1:18:31] then it is no more I that do it but sin
[1:18:35] that dwelleth in me for I know that in
[1:18:39] me that is my
[1:18:41] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[1:18:45] is present with me but how to perform
[1:18:49] that which is good I find not for the
[1:18:52] good that I would I do the would I do
[1:18:55] not but the evil which I would not that
[1:18:58] I do now if I
[1:19:02] do that I would not it is no more I that
[1:19:05] do it but sin that dwelleth in me stay
[1:19:08] with me I find then a law when I would
[1:19:12] do good evil is present with
[1:19:16] me for I Delight in the law of God after
[1:19:20] the inward man amen but I see another
[1:19:24] law in my members Waring against the law
[1:19:29] of my
[1:19:30] mind G and Paul said I have the mind of
[1:19:35] Christ and bringing me into captivity to
[1:19:39] the law of sin which is in my members oh
[1:19:43] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:19:47] me from this body of
[1:19:50] death I think God through Jesus Christ
[1:19:55] Our Lord who with my mind I may serve
[1:19:59] the law of God but with flesh the law of
[1:20:03] sin now Paul is saying that he is in a
[1:20:07] constant war between the spirit and the
[1:20:12] Flesh and this war is going between good
[1:20:15] and
[1:20:16] evil you pull up the next slide stay
[1:20:19] with me now you're doing
[1:20:21] great pull up that quote there we go
[1:20:24] this is a questions and answers in
[1:20:28] 1964 and they're asking brother about uh
[1:20:31] brother brandom about Romans chap 7
[1:20:33] 14-18 he said we know that the law is
[1:20:37] spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin
[1:20:41] for that which I would I do not that
[1:20:43] which I would for what I would that I
[1:20:46] would not that which I hate that I do if
[1:20:50] I do that which I would not
[1:20:53] he said and he goes on I consent to the
[1:20:56] law that is good now then it is no more
[1:21:00] I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:21:04] he says I cannot understand this
[1:21:07] 1964 now brother benam picks it up as
[1:21:10] you're reading there he said Paul is
[1:21:12] speaking to the Romans he said now let
[1:21:15] me just polish this up so you can see it
[1:21:19] in me is two persons right
[1:21:23] one wants me to do
[1:21:25] wrong and the other wants me every time
[1:21:29] I
[1:21:30] start to do right the wrong hinders
[1:21:34] me next
[1:21:36] slide and as long as you are in this
[1:21:40] life you're are going to have a sticky
[1:21:43] and a carnal nature that's going to
[1:21:46] bother you as long as you
[1:21:49] live but inside of you
[1:21:53] you are born
[1:21:56] again and when you're raised up you're
[1:21:59] in the likeness of Christ and all the
[1:22:02] sin goes from
[1:22:04] you now if you continue to read the
[1:22:07] quote brother brandham talked about the
[1:22:09] Indian how he said how you doing Chief
[1:22:12] since he got saved he goes good and bad
[1:22:15] he goes what do you mean he said since
[1:22:17] Chief got saved there's a white dog and
[1:22:20] a black dog and they fight all the time
[1:22:24] brother bam said which one wins the most
[1:22:27] he said the one she feeds the
[1:22:29] most because inside of you is a war we
[1:22:34] are in a war from Angelic War down to
[1:22:39] human
[1:22:42] battles 1 Peter chap
[1:22:45] 2:1 look what Peter tells us dearly
[1:22:48] beloved I beseech you as strangers and
[1:22:51] pilgrims to obain stain from fleshly
[1:22:54] lust which war against the
[1:23:00] soul there are two
[1:23:03] laws you live in a contaminated body but
[1:23:08] your soul is
[1:23:11] redeemed
[1:23:13] Hallelujah now brother brandham told us
[1:23:16] and listen closely and who is this
[1:23:18] MDC that Adam bypassed his theophany uh
[1:23:23] and took a human Spirit in order to be
[1:23:31] tempted
[1:23:33] wow he said now when we die we'll go to
[1:23:36] a word body but we bypass that word body
[1:23:41] to take a flesh
[1:23:43] body
[1:23:45] Hallelujah he said now you had to come
[1:23:49] here in flesh to be tempted by sin
[1:23:55] then brother Brandon brings great
[1:23:56] insight to us in the greatest battle
[1:23:59] ever
[1:24:00] fought when brother Brandon preached the
[1:24:03] greatest battle ever fought he taught us
[1:24:05] which is vital to this hour he taught us
[1:24:09] that God had to have a meeting
[1:24:12] place and he said when a man is going to
[1:24:15] go to war they have to have a
[1:24:17] Battleground and the chosen Battleground
[1:24:21] is your mind
[1:24:25] amen he said why the mind because that's
[1:24:29] where decisions are
[1:24:31] made that's where choices are made and
[1:24:35] brother bam said that is where the
[1:24:38] battle begins in your life and we are
[1:24:42] made up of Body Spirit and soul and the
[1:24:46] outer man has five Outlets see taste
[1:24:50] feel smell and here the spirit man has
[1:24:53] five Outlets memory reason conscience
[1:24:55] affections and imaginations but in the
[1:24:58] soul there are two outlets and that is
[1:25:01] Faith and
[1:25:03] unbelief and he said Satan approaches
[1:25:06] you from the
[1:25:09] inside
[1:25:11] wow when when
[1:25:14] job was perfect in the eyesight of God
[1:25:18] the devil approached God and said let me
[1:25:21] have him skin for skin yes I will make
[1:25:26] him
[1:25:27] recant so the devil attacked the outer
[1:25:31] man because he could not shake his
[1:25:35] soulall Hallelujah now brother brandham
[1:25:38] said now you're not safe because you
[1:25:40] feel
[1:25:44] saved hallu he said if you're saved it's
[1:25:48] not because you fell the chill
[1:25:50] bump the devil can stump you on any
[1:25:53] feeling but you are safe because of your
[1:25:57] revelation of thus sayith the Lord you
[1:26:00] are saved because the word says so
[1:26:06] hallelujah
[1:26:08] hallelujah how many are saved here
[1:26:11] tonight the prophet of God is teaching
[1:26:14] us how to
[1:26:15] fight that next quote pull up that next
[1:26:17] quote watch this now I know I'm laying a
[1:26:20] lot in but I want to establish you firm
[1:26:23] upon thus sayith the Lord I want to
[1:26:25] establish you upon the word of God and
[1:26:28] the word of God will defeat the Devil
[1:26:30] anywhere any place any
[1:26:33] time I'm not preaching to the flesh I'm
[1:26:35] preaching to the soul to establish you
[1:26:38] in the
[1:26:40] Kingdom now watch this
[1:26:42] here he said now I know I've often
[1:26:46] thought back here in the spirit of man
[1:26:50] the next is a soul the next to the mind
[1:26:54] then is
[1:26:55] flesh Satan does not tempt down here
[1:26:59] which is the soul he tempts the
[1:27:04] flesh for instance you're coming down
[1:27:07] the street you're walking you're singing
[1:27:09] Christian
[1:27:11] songs and he said you know she or he is
[1:27:14] just a hypocrite talking about you the
[1:27:17] first thing your flesh picks it up in
[1:27:19] the ear and suggests to the Mind get
[1:27:21] even with it
[1:27:26] beat him into a puddle and walk him
[1:27:30] dry Vengeance then the spirit says
[1:27:33] vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will
[1:27:36] repay so the temp the the Satan tempts
[1:27:40] out
[1:27:41] here he said but down here you're
[1:27:44] Immortal yes it's the flesh that he is
[1:27:48] tempting next slide young man going down
[1:27:52] the street young Christian boy young
[1:27:56] lady coming immorally dressed the eye
[1:28:00] picks it up the flesh suggests to the
[1:28:04] Mind
[1:28:06] evil then time it gets to the Mind goes
[1:28:10] to the soul the soul of man and the is
[1:28:12] the nature of the spirit I know that
[1:28:14] this goes way back brother B made these
[1:28:16] Corrections he said whosoever lookth now
[1:28:19] he the spirit speaks who who soever
[1:28:22] lookth upon a woman in lust has
[1:28:25] committed adultery in his heart already
[1:28:27] the young man turns his head and walks
[1:28:31] away see down here it's got to be not
[1:28:36] out here it's got to be in your heart
[1:28:39] where God
[1:28:41] lives now the mind is the gate to the
[1:28:45] soul this is how the devil's going to
[1:28:47] get in the mind opens the door or closes
[1:28:52] the
[1:28:53] door
[1:28:55] hallelujah how many believe that and
[1:28:58] brother Bram said when your mind closes
[1:29:01] itself to every doubt every sensation
[1:29:05] every feeling nothing there but the word
[1:29:08] of
[1:29:10] God you want to talk about an invincible
[1:29:13] Army I I am I'm fortified behind thus
[1:29:17] sayith the
[1:29:19] Lord this is the front line
[1:29:23] you are on the front lines
[1:29:25] tonight Hallelujah this is where the war
[1:29:29] rages and every one of us are in it but
[1:29:33] brother bam said this cannot harm you
[1:29:36] unless you open the
[1:29:41] door wow it's all on you the devil made
[1:29:44] me do it no you let him
[1:29:48] in we have a responsibility that's right
[1:29:51] and more with the revealed word brother
[1:29:54] brandom said when you let him in he will
[1:29:57] take control but you got to accept
[1:30:02] it you're serpent
[1:30:05] seed you don't belong here you're not
[1:30:08] elect you're from the
[1:30:10] devil you came from serpent seed you're
[1:30:14] the brother of
[1:30:16] Cain you're just make

[1:32:08] be
[1:32:09] tempted of the devil that's right next
[1:32:14] slide I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:32:17] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[1:32:21] Shall Serve the law of
[1:32:24] God but with the flesh the
[1:32:27] law of
[1:32:30] sin listen to this brother brandham said
[1:32:33] this here questions and answers
[1:32:36] 1959 he said Paul said with my mind and
[1:32:39] he said I have the mind of Christ I
[1:32:42] serve God with my mind but the flesh is
[1:32:47] the law of sin the flesh says tonight
[1:32:50] you're tired you're sore you've been out
[1:32:53] in the wind all day that is the law of
[1:32:57] the
[1:32:58] flesh he said but my mind on the inside
[1:33:02] the holy spirit says keep your promise
[1:33:05] amen the flesh says you're too tired the
[1:33:08] fles will say there's no need you're the

[1:33:27] watch
[1:33:29] this Paul said My Flesh wants always to
[1:33:33] yield to that and your flesh does
[1:33:37] too but the law of the spirit of God in
[1:33:41] the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes
[1:33:46] the body obey what the heart says to do
[1:33:51] yes
[1:33:55] woo then if it'll look for us he said if
[1:33:58] that'll work for a sinner will it not
[1:34:00] work for sickness too the law of the
[1:34:04] spirit of God in the Heart Says by his
[1:34:08] stripes I am healed they stand there
[1:34:11] with their power to make the sickness in
[1:34:14] the body obey them because it's the

[1:34:29] heart so your heart your spirit in your
[1:34:33] heart will make your body obey hlu did
[1:34:38] you hear what I just

[1:34:44] greater than the law of sin and death
[1:34:47] the law of the spirit of life is greater
[1:34:50] than complex Lexus is greater than
[1:34:53] sickness is greater than your weakness
[1:34:56] the law of the spirit of life is greater
[1:35:00] than any power of the devil the law of
[1:35:04] the spirit of life will bring this flesh
[1:35:08] into subjection to the word of
[1:35:12] God
[1:35:13] hallelujah grab your

[1:35:43] ground are we safe tonight are we free
[1:35:47] tonight are we on our way to canaan's
[1:35:50] land
[1:35:52] Hallelujah Romans chapter 6 ver8 now if
[1:35:56] we be dead with Christ We believe We
[1:36:00] Shall also live with him knowing that
[1:36:03] Christ has raised from the dead dieth no
[1:36:06] more and death has no more dominion over
[1:36:09] him in that he died he died under sin
[1:36:13] once in that he liveth he liveth unto
[1:36:16] God likewise reckon you also yourselves
[1:36:20] dead indeed to sin but alive unto God
[1:36:25] through Christ Jesus our lord let not
[1:36:28] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[1:36:32] that you should obey it in the lust
[1:36:36] thereof wow neither yield your members
[1:36:41] as instruments of unrighteousness Unto
[1:36:44] sin but yield yourselves unto God as
[1:36:49] those that are alive from the dead
[1:36:51] and your members as instruments of
[1:36:54] righteousness unto God for sin shall not
[1:36:59] have dominion over
[1:37:02] you for you are not under the law but
[1:37:05] you're under the law of
[1:37:07] Calvary under grace What then shall we
[1:37:11] sin because we are not under the law but
[1:37:13] under grace God forbid know ye not that
[1:37:17] whom you yield yourselves servants to
[1:37:20] obey his servants you are whom you obey
[1:37:24] whether sin unto death or obedience unto
[1:37:27] righteousness but God be thank that you
[1:37:31] were the Servants of sin but you have
[1:37:34] obeyed from
[1:37:35] where from the heart the form of
[1:37:39] Doctrine which was delivered you being
[1:37:42] then made free from sin you become the
[1:37:46] Servants of
[1:37:47] righteousness I speak after the manner
[1:37:49] of men be because of the infirmity in
[1:37:54] your
[1:38:01] flesh for as you have yielded your memb
[1:38:03] servants to
[1:38:05] uncleanliness and iniquity unto
[1:38:08] iniquity even so now yield your members
[1:38:11] servants to righteousness unto Holiness
[1:38:15] for when you were the Servants of sin
[1:38:17] you were free from
[1:38:19] righteousness what fruit FR you had in
[1:38:22] those things wherein you are now ashamed
[1:38:24] but the end of those things is death but
[1:38:27] now being free from sin you become the
[1:38:30] servants to God and you have your fruit
[1:38:34] unto Holiness and the end everlasting
[1:38:36] life for the wages of sin is death but
[1:38:40] the gift of God is eternal life through
[1:38:44] Jesus Christ Our Lord the reason we have
[1:38:48] many people that have so much
[1:38:51] uh failure in their walk with Christ is
[1:38:54] because they're Christians trying to
[1:38:56] live on Mount
[1:38:58] Si but Mount Si is the law of death the
[1:39:02] law of dos and don'ts and you will fail
[1:39:05] there look away from Mount Si and look
[1:39:09] to Mount Calvary where Christ took the
[1:39:12] law upon
[1:39:14] himself and freed you from the
[1:39:18] law
[1:39:20] Hallelujah
[1:39:21] hallelujah how many are free from the
[1:39:24] law now brother brandham said God put a
[1:39:27] control tower on the inside of you he
[1:39:30] said this in thirst
[1:39:32] 1965 he said and the way you want to
[1:39:35] know what's driving you is watch what is
[1:39:38] motivating you what kind of Life
[1:39:42] motivates you he said you can tell what
[1:39:45] you are by the desire that is in
[1:39:49] you he said now the desires of the body
[1:39:53] will war with the desires of the soul
[1:39:56] and he said too many people live between
[1:39:59] these two
[1:40:00] desires and when the devil he said
[1:40:02] you're trying to do something good he
[1:40:04] said the devil will come in and try to
[1:40:06] throw you off or to upset you the devil
[1:40:09] will try to block it he said but don't
[1:40:11] you back off you press right to the Holy
[1:40:14] Ghost you press right on to the to
[1:40:17] Victory because the devil's trying to
[1:40:19] beset you right that's right what do
[1:40:22] feelings Got to Do With It many of times
[1:40:26] I've preached and said Lord if I could
[1:40:28] get out of this service and the devil
[1:40:30] bombarded me I don't even want to preach
[1:40:32] have you ever been there and come out
[1:40:34] and preach and the glory of God falls
[1:40:36] upon the congregation it is the devil
[1:40:39] trying to hinder
[1:40:41] you you got to recognize what is the
[1:40:44] Flesh and what is the
[1:40:47] spirit because the inner man there is a
[1:40:51] desire for righteousness and the devil's
[1:40:54] trying to beset that but what is your
[1:40:59] desire I don't want the world I don't
[1:41:02] want the lust of the flesh I don't want
[1:41:05] nothing this world has I want to be an
[1:41:08] eagle I want to spread my wings and
[1:41:12] fly I am an
[1:41:15] eagle I am an
[1:41:17] eagle I'm getting ready for flight
[1:41:21] Hallelujah I'm going to break through
[1:41:23] the
[1:41:25] [Applause]
[1:41:28] atmosphere the devil said no you're a
[1:41:35] chicken the devil's constantly trying to
[1:41:39] play with her
[1:41:40] mind you know you're a chicken he does
[1:41:44] that to preachers too you just you know
[1:41:47] brother brandom said it he said he got
[1:41:49] in the car and he he said he heard
[1:41:51] someone on the radio saying you know all
[1:41:53] that Christian stuff he said is there
[1:41:56] nothing to it we We Come From Evolution
[1:41:59] and the devil started getting in his
[1:42:04] mind a a prophet of
[1:42:07] God who spoke to Angels had 30 to 40
[1:42:10] Visions a
[1:42:13] day and
[1:42:15] actually it starts getting to
[1:42:19] him don't under estimate his
[1:42:22] power and don't flirt with
[1:42:27] unbelief you must stay far from
[1:42:30] unbelief because it will anoint
[1:42:34] you
[1:42:36] Hallelujah if you're seeking the baptism
[1:42:39] of the Holy Spirit when the devil starts
[1:42:41] to throw up obstacle press right through
[1:42:44] to it because it is for you he died that
[1:42:47] you might have it you just press right
[1:42:50] in take your god-given right by the
[1:42:53] spirit the law of the spirit of life is
[1:42:56] greater than
[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:43:01] unbelief resist the
[1:43:04] devil and he will flee from you what
[1:43:08] what is
[1:43:09] stronger day or
[1:43:12] night light or
[1:43:15] Darkness I want to ask you what is
[1:43:18] stronger sin or
[1:43:22] Life Death Or life God or the
[1:43:27] devil turn with me Romans chapter 8
[1:43:32] verse one let's read it again this is
[1:43:33] our opening
[1:43:36] scripture this is one of the most
[1:43:38] incredible scriptures of the entire
[1:43:41] Bible say Amen when you're
[1:43:44] there there is
[1:43:47] therefore now no condemnation
[1:43:52] to them that are in Christ
[1:43:55] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:43:59] after the spirit for the law of the
[1:44:03] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[1:44:08] me free fre from the law of sin and
[1:44:16] death
[1:44:19] Hallelujah for what the law could not do
[1:44:23] and that it was weak through the
[1:44:26] flesh
[1:44:28] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:44:32] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:44:37] sin in the flesh before I go any further
[1:44:41] brother brandom said the Old Testament
[1:44:43] sacrifice they went in a liar an
[1:44:46] adulterer a murderer they sacrificed
[1:44:50] when they left there was not enough
[1:44:52] Power in the Blood of those gats to
[1:44:55] change his desire he came in a liar he
[1:44:58] went out a liar he came in a hormonger
[1:45:01] he left a hormonger there was not enough
[1:45:04] power in that blood but there is enough
[1:45:07] Power in the Blood of Jesus to change
[1:45:10] your
[1:45:13] desire and though your flesh is buffeted
[1:45:16] your soul stands on the word of God
[1:45:21] Hallelujah and you can judge what you
[1:45:23] are by your
[1:45:27] desire
[1:45:29] amen amen verse four that the
[1:45:33] righteousness of the law might be
[1:45:36] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:45:40] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[1:45:44] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[1:45:47] of the flesh but they that are after to
[1:45:50] the spirit the things of the
[1:45:54] spirit to be carnally minded is
[1:45:59] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:46:03] life and peace because the carnal mind
[1:46:07] is enmity against God and it for it is
[1:46:13] not subject to the law of God and
[1:46:17] neither can it
[1:46:18] be h
[1:46:21] so your soul is subject but your flesh
[1:46:25] is not but your soul can bring it in
[1:46:28] subjection to the word of
[1:46:31] God
[1:46:34] hallelujah verse eight so then they that
[1:46:38] are in the
[1:46:39] flesh cannot please
[1:46:42] God that's why the devil tries to make
[1:46:45] you look to SI he wants you to live by a
[1:46:49] law I wear dresses I wear my hair long I
[1:46:52] go to church I pay my tithe you will
[1:46:54] never find peace on Mount
[1:46:58] Si but when you look to Calvary you're
[1:47:01] ruled by the law of life and the law of
[1:47:05] love where your desires follow the word
[1:47:09] of
[1:47:10] God I'm going to church because I love
[1:47:14] him I pay my tie cuz I love him I turn
[1:47:18] my head because I love God go it's the
[1:47:22] law of the spirit of Life made me free
[1:47:26] from the law of the
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:31] flesh
[1:47:33] hallelujah hallelujah is that verse
[1:47:35] eight my eyes are that bad is that verse
[1:47:39] eight but verse nine he said but you're
[1:47:42] not in the flesh but in the
[1:47:45] spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell
[1:47:48] in you that that if any man have not the
[1:47:51] spirit of Christ he is none of his so
[1:47:54] you you can't live Christianity In the
[1:47:56] Flesh and if Christ be in you the body
[1:47:59] is dead because of sin but the spirit is
[1:48:02] life because of
[1:48:04] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:48:06] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:48:09] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:48:12] dead shall Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:48:15] the spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:48:18] therefore brother we are dead not to the
[1:48:21] flesh to live after the flesh for if you
[1:48:24] live after the flesh you die but if you
[1:48:26] through the spirit mortify which put to
[1:48:29] death the Deeds of the body you shall
[1:48:34] live hallu for as many are led by the
[1:48:37] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:48:44] hallelujah
[1:48:46] hallelujah now brother bam said we have
[1:48:48] a right uh brother you were inspired in
[1:48:52] your
[1:48:53] prayer because brother Brenham said in
[1:48:56] restoration of the Bride tree that the
[1:48:58] holy spirit is our
[1:49:01] lawgiver and he said here is the angel
[1:49:04] of God and the only way he can work is
[1:49:08] if you let him work you've got to
[1:49:11] believe him that's right brother Matthew
[1:49:14] was talking about sending the Holy
[1:49:16] Spirit after the man that stole the car
[1:49:19] he said it is a
[1:49:20] law it is the law of the spirit of life
[1:49:25] he said the only way he can work is when
[1:49:28] you let him work you must believe
[1:49:32] him there's a law to everything he said
[1:49:35] there's a a fish has a law and that law
[1:49:39] is inside of that fish he said that fish
[1:49:42] can go Plum to the depths of the ocean
[1:49:46] and he can be H unharmed because of the
[1:49:49] law that God placed in him he said a
[1:49:53] bird cannot do it you cannot do it
[1:49:55] because you do not possess that law he
[1:49:58] said there is a law that is in a in a
[1:50:00] bird that it can defy gravity it can
[1:50:04] break gravity because God created it
[1:50:07] with a law that it can defy it we were
[1:50:10] not made with that law but the bird was
[1:50:13] made with that law but you were made
[1:50:16] with the law of the spirit of Life
[1:50:19] Hallelujah God created
[1:50:22] you with a law in you that you can lay
[1:50:26] your hands on the sick and they recover
[1:50:30] that you can cast out Devils you don't
[1:50:33] have to knock down to the devil you have
[1:50:36] a law in
[1:50:37] you a bird does not
[1:50:40] struggle a bird lives by the law that
[1:50:43] God plac in it we ought to struggle as
[1:50:47] Christians we ought to live by the law
[1:50:50] of the spirit of God you need to tell
[1:50:53] the devil get behind me I'm free in
[1:50:57] Christ
[1:50:59] Jesus thank you Jesus you've got you've
[1:51:02] got a law as Michael cast The Devil Out
[1:51:06] of Heaven you've got a law to cast him
[1:51:11] out God help us as many are led by the
[1:51:15] spirit that are the sons of God we are
[1:51:17] to live by this law yeah that's right
[1:51:21] not afraid Jesus lived by this law when
[1:51:24] he faced with Devils they cast out when
[1:51:27] he was faced with fever they were healed
[1:51:30] when he faced with the dead they lived
[1:51:33] again the same law he lived by we live
[1:51:37] by that's
[1:51:40] right God created this
[1:51:43] church with a
[1:51:45] law he said no matter what he said if
[1:51:49] you go down in the grave that law raise
[1:51:51] you
[1:51:52] up now he said you have come like
[1:51:57] Adam you have become an attribute of
[1:52:00] Flesh for one purpose you know why you
[1:52:03] come like Adam because God ordained that
[1:52:07] you must be
[1:52:11] tempted you say I'm going through so
[1:52:14] much Temptation that's why you're
[1:52:18] here
[1:52:20] Hallelujah he said but when this Earthly
[1:52:23] Tabernacle be dissolved we have a word
[1:52:25] body that's free from
[1:52:27] Temptation he said now you must stand
[1:52:31] the
[1:52:32] Temptation you came down to be tempted
[1:52:36] by sin you bypassed your theophany you
[1:52:39] become a flesh man to be tempted by
[1:52:43] sin when this body receives the spirit
[1:52:46] The Immortal Life inside you throw your
[1:52:50] body in subjection to the word of
[1:52:55] God this is your
[1:52:58] Victory there is therefore no
[1:53:02] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:53:05] Jesus who walk not according to the
[1:53:07] flesh but by the spirit he said it
[1:53:10] throws your body into subjection just
[1:53:13] get in Christ and your whole body is
[1:53:17] subject to the Holy Spirit
[1:53:20] how many what victory you must get away
[1:53:23] from the Flesh and you must become
[1:53:26] subject to the spirit of
[1:53:31] God he said get in Christ and your body
[1:53:34] will become subject he said no more
[1:53:37] subject to the world they are dead your
[1:53:40] sins are buried in baptism you're a new
[1:53:43] creation in Christ you're becoming
[1:53:45] subject to the spirit the spirit has
[1:53:49] been Qui
[1:53:50] quickened I want you to think of this
[1:53:53] the law of the spirit of life when Jesus
[1:53:55] spoke to the woman at the well that

[1:59:16] raise it
[1:59:18] up
[1:59:20] hallelujah
[1:59:22] hallelujah how many ever heard of John
[1:59:24] CH
[1:59:25] Lake he one of the greatest in my
[1:59:29] opinion one of the greatest men ever
[1:59:31] Christian men God used him in Divine
[1:59:33] Healing and supplies to bring help to
[1:59:37] the people of Africa and John G Lake was
[1:59:40] a firm believer in Divine Healing and he
[1:59:43] was working right among this plague
[1:59:45] people are dying left and right and he's
[1:59:48] unharmed and so the doctors called him
[1:59:51] and said what's the trick how in the
[1:59:53] world are you living in the midst of
[1:59:55] this plague and not even being harmed he
[1:59:59] answered it is the law of the spirit of
[2:00:02] life in Christ
[2:00:05] Jesus he said I believe as long as my
[2:00:08] soul is in contact with the Living God
[2:00:12] that spirit is flowing through my soul
[2:00:15] and my body and no germ can attach
[2:00:18] itself to me
[2:00:20] the spirit of God will kill
[2:00:26] it and they said don't you think you
[2:00:28] ought to use our safety measures he said
[2:00:32] no doctor would you like to do an
[2:00:34] experiment on me he said I want you to
[2:00:38] go to one of those dead people after
[2:00:41] they die and take the foam out of their
[2:00:43] lungs he said I want you to get a
[2:00:46] microscope and place that foam on my
[2:00:49] body and he said when it makes contact
[2:00:53] with my body those germs will die
[2:00:55] instantly
[2:00:58] amen they did and when they put the
[2:01:02] germs on John G Lake's body they died
[2:01:06] instantly because he
[2:01:08] believed that the law of the spirit of
[2:01:11] Life had made him free from the law of
[2:01:15] death now God's law Works in US
[2:01:20] God's law is working in you right now
[2:01:23] that's What Makes You hunger for God
[2:01:25] that's What Makes You amen the word
[2:01:27] that's what's turned your back from the
[2:01:29] world and brought you into Union with
[2:01:32] Christ the law of the spirit of
[2:01:37] Life can bring death to a cancer in a
[2:01:41] human
[2:01:43] body how many believe
[2:01:45] that if the devil can make his laws of
[2:01:48] sin and death work CU I'm preaching on
[2:01:51] two laws tonight we know what the laws
[2:01:54] of sin and death do and if the devil can
[2:01:57] make his laws work how much more can God
[2:02:01] make his laws work and we have already
[2:02:04] proven that the laws of God are so much
[2:02:06] higher than the laws of the devil
[2:02:09] Hallelujah that's why when sickness came
[2:02:13] God sent a
[2:02:15] savior when darkness came God sent light
[2:02:19] it is the law of the spirit of life that
[2:02:22] makes us
[2:02:23] free from the law of sin and death where
[2:02:27] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[2:02:29] Liberty are you free tonight has Christ
[2:02:33] made you free he said you are free
[2:02:36] indeed I don't care how old you are I
[2:02:39] don't care how sick you are I don't care
[2:02:41] how lost you are the spirit of the love
[2:02:45] the life of Christ hallelu says
[2:02:48] whosoever will let him
[2:02:50] come
[2:02:53] Hallelujah brother brandham when they'd
[2:02:55] say God Is Not A
[2:02:58] Healer he said you tell me what life is
[2:03:02] and I'll tell you what healing
[2:03:04] is he says because life is
[2:03:08] God how many believe that and Jesus said
[2:03:12] I come to give you
[2:03:14] life and to give it to you more
[2:03:17] abundantly that God was going to give us
[2:03:19] more than human
[2:03:20] life God was going to give us spiritual
[2:03:23] life and the Holy Spirit has power over
[2:03:27] sickness the Holy Spirit has power over
[2:03:30] lust the Holy Spirit has power over
[2:03:34] pornography when the devil says you're
[2:03:36] in a cage Jesus set you free and there
[2:03:40] is a power in his word he sent his word
[2:03:43] and healed them there is a power in this
[2:03:46] law that will free men from from por
[2:03:49] pornography will free people from uh
[2:03:53] from confusion of their mind it'll free
[2:03:56] people from the complexes that hold them
[2:04:00] down we need to cut all the
[2:04:02] gravitation we need to flap our
[2:04:05] wigs we need to be Eagles because God
[2:04:09] put a law in you to be able to Fly Above
[2:04:13] the
[2:04:14] Judgment Hallelujah brother brandom said
[2:04:17] the greatest battle
[2:04:19] ever fought is going on right
[2:04:22] now he said it's between life and death
[2:04:27] it's between sickness and health it's
[2:04:29] between faith and doubt it's between
[2:04:33] Liberty and bondage Satan's Army brings
[2:04:37] diseases and God's Army is commissioned
[2:04:40] to cast them
[2:04:41] out God's Army is to cast them out
[2:04:45] that's the way God's method is you cast
[2:04:48] out the evil one cast out the ugly one I
[2:04:52] want you right now to say I'm casting
[2:04:54] out the unbelief I'm driving this
[2:04:57] Darkness out of my life I'm driving this
[2:05:00] stronghold out of my life and and the
[2:05:03] law has an enforcer behind it you need
[2:05:07] to flash your badge as a Believer take
[2:05:10] your hand off my sister take your hand
[2:05:13] off this church we are rising in
[2:05:16] Resurrection we are rising aming in
[2:05:19] faith the devil has nothing on you he's
[2:05:22] placed under your
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:26] feet you must stand in your authority
[2:05:30] Jesus Christ made you free and you can
[2:05:33] stand there by the grace of God and say
[2:05:35] he has freed me from my bondage he has
[2:05:39] freed me from my fear he has freed me
[2:05:42] from the thing that has held me down he
[2:05:45] has freed me from
[2:05:47] suicide
[2:05:50] he has freed me from video games he has
[2:05:53] freed me from being a whoremonger he has
[2:05:56] freed me from
[2:05:57] homosexuality
[2:06:04] Hall law of the spirit of
[2:06:09] Life brother
[2:06:11] brandham would lay his hand upon
[2:06:14] somebody and his hand had a gift in it
[2:06:16] that would detect germ related to
[2:06:18] diseases and when he put his hand upon
[2:06:20] them his his hand would become agitated
[2:06:24] like Angry bumps would go all over it he
[2:06:26] said what is it he said death is in that
[2:06:29] germ of death he said but life is
[2:06:33] pulsating and life and death cannot
[2:06:36] exist in the same place that's why when
[2:06:39] Jesus came to the tomb of Lazarus life
[2:06:41] and death cannot stay in the same place
[2:06:45] I am proclaiming the gospel of life
[2:06:47] tonight and the devil cannot stay in
[2:06:50] this place and sickness cannot stay in
[2:06:53] this place lies cannot stay in this
[2:06:58] place it is the law of the spirit of
[2:07:01] life and we have authority with an
[2:07:04] enforcing Angel behind
[2:07:10] it Jesus said I am the resurrection and
[2:07:14] the life whosoever believeth in me
[2:07:17] though he were dead yet shall he live
[2:07:19] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[2:07:21] shall never die believest thou
[2:07:27] this I don't care how dark the
[2:07:29] stronghold you could have been molested
[2:07:31] from a child dealing with a stronghold
[2:07:34] that you have hidden all your life and
[2:07:36] God can set you free
[2:07:42] tonight Dark
[2:07:44] Places could be molested things you
[2:07:47] could not share with nobody and you live
[2:07:50] you live in darkness like a leper that
[2:07:52] don't even want to come
[2:07:55] out but but the Bible said that Jesus
[2:07:58] healed the
[2:08:00] leper when there was no cure at that
[2:08:03] time Jesus could heal that leper by the
[2:08:06] law of the spirit of life and he would
[2:08:08] touch him and say be
[2:08:13] clean and in a moment's time the man
[2:08:16] that was hidden in obscurity and outcast
[2:08:18] from the people in a moment's time is
[2:08:21] made
[2:08:24] clean I believe that the spirit of the
[2:08:26] Lord can touch your soul and That
[2:08:29] leprous Hideous Soul could be made wide
[2:08:32] as
[2:08:34] snow I believe in the freedom of the
[2:08:37] Holy Spirit and I believe that freedom
[2:08:40] brings life behind
[2:08:46] it I want you to believe Bel tonight how
[2:08:50] many are
[2:08:51] believers I want to show you Authority
[2:08:54] in God's
[2:08:56] word the law of the spirit of life in
[2:09:00] Christ
[2:09:01] Jesus has made me
[2:09:04] free has made me
[2:09:06] free from the law of sin and
[2:09:13] death how many want to be
[2:09:16] free from the law of sin sin and
[2:09:24] death let us stand our
[2:09:28] feet as the musicians will
[2:09:32] come I want to close in these
[2:09:35] words there is now no
[2:09:40] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:09:44] Jesus who walk not after the flesh
[2:09:49] but after the
[2:09:52] spirit as we just bow our
[2:09:55] heads and the musicians can play
[2:09:57] whatever's on their
[2:09:59] heart Lord

[2:10:20] enemy and to walk in Christian
[2:10:24] Victory Lord we would never make Grace
[2:10:27] disgrace but now we understand why the

[2:23:46] me
[2:23:49] amen the law of the
[2:23:52] spirit of
[2:23:55] Life the law of the spirit is greater
[2:23:58] than the law of
[2:24:00] death the law put you into prison
[2:24:05] yeah has anybody ever been locked
[2:24:09] up you ever been behind
[2:24:13] bars you don't get to eat what you want
[2:24:15] to eat amen you don't get to go where
[2:24:18] you want to go
[2:24:20] amen you don't get to sleep where you
[2:24:23] want to sleep you sleep where they tell
[2:24:24] you to sleep you eat what they give you
[2:24:27] to
[2:24:27] eat cuz you're in prison you're locked
[2:24:31] up behind
[2:24:34] bars because there was a penalty for the
[2:24:37] law and now you were subject to it
[2:24:41] yes but there comes a day when the
[2:24:43] penalty's been
[2:24:45] satisfied
[2:24:48] and they come down to your cell and they
[2:24:50] say guess
[2:24:51] what you're going
[2:24:54] home I'm going
[2:24:56] home what does that
[2:24:58] mean it means you can go where you want
[2:25:01] to
[2:25:03] go you don't have to stay there any
[2:25:07] longer you mean I could worship like
[2:25:10] I've always wanted to worship I don't
[2:25:12] got to stay in the prison house any
[2:25:15] longer you mean I can walk out of these
[2:25:18] complexes I can walk out of these fears
[2:25:21] I can walk away from pornography I can
[2:25:23] walk away from lust I don't have to eat
[2:25:26] this nonsense anymore I'm
[2:25:29] free because whom the son has made
[2:25:33] free is free
[2:25:37] indeed are you free
[2:25:40] tonight the law of the spirit has made
[2:25:43] me
[2:25:44] free from the law
[2:25:47] of sin and death
[2:25:49] Hallelujah I think it's no coincidence I
[2:25:52] had this quote written down
[2:25:55] here and I want to read
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:25:58] it in force yeah then we have the
[2:26:03] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[2:26:07] claims that God give us for God has a
[2:26:11] law and his word is a
[2:26:14] law and God in this word word made
[2:26:17] certain claims to the
[2:26:19] church therefore we have a right to
[2:26:21] force these claims upon Satan and say
[2:26:24] give it back and he has to do
[2:26:27] it a sudden struck me while brother
[2:26:29] Craig was preaching Jesus said if you
[2:26:31] destroy this Temple if you destroy this
[2:26:34] body I'll raise it up I want to ask you
[2:26:37] where were you
[2:26:39] on where were
[2:26:42] you you were in
[2:26:44] him make my body sick destroy this body
[2:26:48] try to bond my body I'm going to raise
[2:26:50] it up you come under the law of sin you
[2:26:54] come under the law of sickness but there
[2:26:56] is the law of the spirit that says I'm
[2:26:57] going to raise it up if that same spirit
[2:27:01] that raised Jesus Christ from the dead
[2:27:03] dwell in you it shall Quicken your M
[2:27:06] body you are
[2:27:08] free I think it's start time we start
[2:27:11] acting like it start living like it we
[2:27:13] start eating like we want to eat we
[2:27:15] start living like we want to
[2:27:18] live tell that old devil get out of
[2:27:22] here when Jesus wanted a result what he
[2:27:24] do he put all the unbelief
[2:27:26] out surrounded himself with
[2:27:31] faith yeah that squirrel's been
[2:27:33] chattering
[2:27:34] no it's not for me the law of sin
[2:27:38] says you're not going to make it you'll
[2:27:41] never be free you're just going to go
[2:27:43] through Cycles you'll never be born
[2:27:45] again and filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:27:47] okay that's what the law of sin is
[2:27:49] saying but there's another
[2:27:51] law the law of the spirit says where the
[2:27:55] law of sin says you're never going to
[2:27:56] make it the law of the spirit says you
[2:27:59] already made
[2:28:01] it the law of spirit says I put your
[2:28:03] name on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[2:28:06] the foundation of the world it's
[2:28:08] impossible for you to miss
[2:28:12] [Music]
[2:28:15] it I think it's time the spiritual
[2:28:18] Amnesia starts to roll
[2:28:20] away as our Pastor said it's it's time
[2:28:22] we start thinking like
[2:28:25] God we start speaking like
[2:28:28] God we start living like
[2:28:32] it and my prayer
[2:28:34] is you don't go from these build this
[2:28:37] building
[2:28:38] tonight without total
[2:28:44] Victory what are you waiting for
[2:28:50] what did the word say tonight which side
[2:28:53] are you going to aim
[2:28:55] in if you say I'm in bondage I'm in
[2:28:57] bondage and yeah that's just the way
[2:28:59] it's going to be or can you start
[2:29:01] looking to the law of the spirit of life
[2:29:03] that says you're
[2:29:04] free the penalty's been
[2:29:07] paid it's all over I've already unlocked
[2:29:11] the cell I've already swung open the
[2:29:13] door he the spirit saying go ahead
[2:29:16] that's right you're
[2:29:18] free now there has to be something in
[2:29:20] you that says amen yes sir I I had
[2:29:24] complexes I had fear I was in bondage I
[2:29:27] I was given into lust I could never get
[2:29:29] over this but what's this other voice
[2:29:31] saying you're free you don't have to be
[2:29:34] in bondage anymore go ahead and walk on
[2:29:35] out you can praise God be why because
[2:29:38] there is there for
[2:29:40] now that weight of
[2:29:43] condemnation that feeling that you're
[2:29:45] never good enough you you can walk right
[2:29:47] out from underneath that why because
[2:29:49] there's therefore now no condemnation
[2:29:52] there's no sin there's no failure
[2:29:54] there's no mistake that can hold you
[2:29:56] down
[2:29:58] anymore because the penalty has been
[2:30:01] satisfied the price has been
[2:30:04] paid now you can walk out and say I'm
[2:30:07] [Music]
[2:30:09] free so while we sing another
[2:30:13] song why don't you start aimen in the
[2:30:15] word saying I'm free free yes pour your
[2:30:18] spirit out on
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:21] me I'm
[2:30:23] free I'm not going to settle for
[2:30:26] anything less I'm going to enforce
[2:30:30] it because the spirit of the word the
[2:30:32] enforcer of the holy spirit is here
[2:30:35] now you lost your joy Satan you robbed
[2:30:39] me of my
[2:30:41] joy I once was on fire I was once living
[2:30:45] in Revival I had cleaned up my life I I
[2:30:48] kicked everything out but everything
[2:30:50] poured back into my life you stole my
[2:30:52] joy you stole my victory you you stole
[2:30:56] my enthusiasm you stole my amen I used
[2:30:59] to come to church I used to smile at the
[2:31:01] preacher I used to aim in the word uh
[2:31:04] everybody knew that something had taken
[2:31:05] place in my life but I found myself
[2:31:07] shrunk back I feel like I'm under
[2:31:09] condemnation I feel like I want I'm not
[2:31:11] that
[2:31:12] anymore don't look to
[2:31:15] that to what the law of the spirit done
[2:31:18] yes he says you don't have to live under
[2:31:20] that
[2:31:21] condemnation it's time to get back up
[2:31:24] you made a mistake say Lord I messed up
[2:31:28] I made a mistake he says I already paid
[2:31:31] that
[2:31:31] penalty why do you keep trying to pay a
[2:31:34] penalty for your sin you don't you don't
[2:31:37] got to do pendants
[2:31:38] tonight you don't have to say woe is me

[2:45:40] going to
[2:45:42] fight cuz Satan hates you yeah
[2:45:47] he said I'll not leave you
[2:45:50] comfortless he says I won't let you go
[2:45:53] through this battle alone he said I'll
[2:45:55] not leave you comfortless amen he says
[2:45:57] but I'll come again hallah I'll send you
[2:46:00] another
[2:46:01] comfort and he'll lead and guide you
[2:46:05] into all
[2:46:07] righteousness and you
[2:46:09] know I mean we fight that battle out
[2:46:12] there all day long that's why I love to
[2:46:14] come to church church and just praise
[2:46:16] the Lord and just get out of it for a
[2:46:20] while right and and just feel as
[2:46:23] goodness and and I guess we would call
[2:46:25] it in the world take a breather you know
[2:46:28] what I mean that it's where you go back
[2:46:31] to the corner in between rounds and you
[2:46:34] talk it over with with the great coach
[2:46:37] and you go out but I'd like to say this
[2:46:40] Jesus
[2:46:41] said I'll be with
[2:46:44] you and even in you till the
[2:46:47] end and and I see this so many times
[2:46:51] that you have a wonderful meeting like
[2:46:54] this and it's the presence of the Lord
[2:46:56] is here and the word of God's just
[2:46:59] flowing and you get that excitement and
[2:47:03] you get that expectation and you think
[2:47:05] that you're going to go
[2:47:07] out by
[2:47:09] inspiration and get the
[2:47:12] victory but he said I I'll be with you
[2:47:15] Hallelujah and even in you I I will not
[2:47:18] leave you comfortless but I'll come and
[2:47:21] that's that's what you got to realize is
[2:47:24] that you can't do this by
[2:47:27] yourself that's true that's right you
[2:47:30] can't that's right brother and you
[2:47:33] you've just got to know that he wants to
[2:47:36] go with
[2:47:37] you and and you know and you've got to
[2:47:41] stop somewhere along your life
[2:47:46] my life started on a
[2:47:48] rooftop reading the first chapter of the
[2:47:51] book of
[2:47:52] Romans and I knew I couldn't get out
[2:47:56] from where I was at unless he did it for
[2:48:00] me
[2:48:01] yes and I found myself many many tight
[2:48:06] places and I've had to always go back to
[2:48:09] that one spot amen say Lord I can't get
[2:48:12] out of this with without you yes and and
[2:48:17] I encourage
[2:48:20] you to
[2:48:22] don't don't try to face
[2:48:25] it by
[2:48:28] yourself brother remm tells the story of
[2:48:31] the woman that washed Jesus's
[2:48:34] feet and he said she sat there and she
[2:48:37] watched
[2:48:39] them everybody mocking
[2:48:43] him
[2:48:45] and she wanted to go down
[2:48:47] there and then in her heart she said but
[2:48:51] he'll know where I got this money
[2:48:55] from he'll know what I do for a
[2:48:59] living he'll know
[2:49:01] that
[2:49:04] and she finally came to one conclusion
[2:49:07] the prophet of God said she knew that he
[2:49:10] was the only one that could help us amen
[2:49:13] amen amen so it didn't matter
[2:49:16] anymore there was only one that could
[2:49:19] help her and whether he knew or she got
[2:49:22] that money whether she knew what she did
[2:49:24] for a living she knew one thing he's the
[2:49:28] only one that could help Hallelujah and
[2:49:32] that's why you hear so many times we say
[2:49:35] it's an individual Affair it's a
[2:49:38] personal
[2:49:39] Affair you've got to take a place
[2:49:42] sometime in your life where you you sit
[2:49:45] down and ask him to help
[2:49:48] you ask him to come into your
[2:49:51] life invite him in to your
[2:49:57] heart and say Lord I need you to help me
[2:50:02] walk this
[2:50:04] walk I need you to give me the victory
[2:50:07] over this I need you to help me put this
[2:50:10] behind me and let him do it because he
[2:50:15] wants to do it yes and so as we dismiss
[2:50:19] tonight I hope that each of
[2:50:23] you that you know in your
[2:50:26] heart whether you've asked him to
[2:50:32] [Music]
[2:50:33] help and I know there's a lot of things
[2:50:37] I need is help in and I was encouraged
[2:50:41] tonight to go find me a place
[2:50:47] little cliff in the Rock somewhere yeah
[2:50:50] and talk it over with them and and
[2:50:53] invite him back in and ask him to guide
[2:50:57] me in the places and wonderful take the
[2:51:00] old crabby rough Spirit out
[2:51:03] and make me sweet and and loving can't
[2:51:08] do it no matter how hard I try or how
[2:51:13] bad I want to
[2:51:15] I can only do all things through Christ
[2:51:18] Jesus who strengthens me so I encourage
[2:51:22] you tonight
[2:51:23] to make that contact again and ask for
[2:51:28] that help and let him become personal to
[2:51:32] you and there's nothing like him there's
[2:51:36] just nothing like him amen let's pray
[2:51:40] our heavenly
[2:51:43] father

[2:51:49] went through the book of Romans and saw
[2:51:53] the reality of Christian
[2:51:57] Life an enemy that's cast his vote
[2:52:00] against
[2:52:02] us a God that's cast his vote for
[2:52:09] us and as the prophet spoke he says
[2:52:13] choose this day who whom you serve as
[2:52:16] for me in my
[2:52:18] house will serve the
[2:52:22] Lord Lord and we've been challenged

[2:52:32] spirit the gift of your person yes I
[2:52:35] will not leave you comfortless but I
[2:52:38] will come again and I'll be with you and
