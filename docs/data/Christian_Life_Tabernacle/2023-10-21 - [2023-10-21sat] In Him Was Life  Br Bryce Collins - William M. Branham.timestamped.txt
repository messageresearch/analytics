[32:14] brother Bryce Collins with us from
[32:16] Victory Tabernacle in Claremore Oklahoma
[32:19] uh many of you might not know him but
[32:21] with time maybe little Fellowship
[32:23] afterwards you might get to know him but
[32:26] God God knows you he knows what you're
[32:29] going through brother Bryce doesn't
[32:31] know but the word is still a discerner
[32:34] of the thought and intense of the heart
[32:36] and he certainly can speak to you if
[32:38] there's a desire that you might have
[32:40] just hold that before the Lord if you
[32:42] need an answer if you need Deliverance
[32:45] if you want God to do something for you
[32:47] maybe you've never known God you've
[32:51] never been touched or nothing's really
[32:55] transpired in your life that would be a
[32:58] convincing uh experience for you to even
[33:01] know that God exist well you simply just
[33:04] have to say God if if you're real would
[33:07] you show yourself to me and if you are
[33:10] real I want to know you and God can take
[33:12] a little Ser service like this and do
[33:15] something special for you where you can
[33:18] leave changed and not the same anymore
[33:20] because that's the kind of God we
[33:23] serve there's a quote that reads the
[33:25] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[33:28] signs of God's
[33:30] disapproval neither are the bright skies
[33:32] and Still Waters signs of his love and
[33:36] approval his approval of any of us is
[33:39] only in the Beloved his love is elective
[33:42] which he had for us before the
[33:44] foundation of the world does he love us

[37:50] 1 before we read the word I like to I
[37:55] just like to bow before the author of
[37:57] the word
[37:59] together Heavenly Father Lord as we
[38:02] approach this time together and we come
[38:06] to this portion of the service we
[38:07] realize Lord that this is the most
[38:10] meaningful and most important part and
[38:13] we're all together insufficient in
[38:15] ourselves to to begin to even take this
[38:20] word Lord and to speak it but we look to
[38:24] you God that your anointing would be a
[38:26] on both the speaking and the hearing of
[38:28] your word and help us Lord just to
[38:31] surrender our heart to you and our our
[38:34] thoughts and our lips Lord that God you
[38:37] would come by and Speak Lord to your
[38:39] children and may they hear your voice
[38:42] Above All Else Lord and God that each
[38:45] one would be drawn closer to you and in
[38:48] a deeper love Lord we know that we've
[38:51] been told that when we come to the word
[38:54] we'll either leave better or leave worse
[38:57] and it's our desire Lord that we would
[38:59] leave better Lord I pray God thy
[39:03] blessings upon each one the precious
[39:06] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen St
[39:10] John 1:1 says in the beginning was the
[39:13] word and the Word was with God and the
[39:16] Word was God the same was in the
[39:19] beginning with God and all things were
[39:22] made by him and without him was not
[39:25] anything made that was made in him was
[39:29] life and the life was the light of men
[39:34] amen God bless you you can be
[39:41] seated so I want to thank you brother I
[39:45] want to take from the fourth verse there
[39:49] in him was
[39:52] life in him was life
[39:57] and so I just I'm not I'm not a uh I'm
[40:02] not a philosophical person but this may
[40:04] sound kind of philosophical for a moment
[40:07] here but the question come to me and the
[40:10] Simplicity of it what is
[40:14] life what is life and if we was to ask
[40:18] you know uh go out on the street and
[40:20] take a survey we'd probably get a quite
[40:23] a variety of of answers to what is life
[40:27] and and so we we believe and we know and
[40:30] we've heard that you know it's it's a
[40:32] gift of life that we've been given in
[40:35] the beginning that we receiv receiv life
[40:39] from somewhere and it's a gift to us but
[40:42] you know if it is a gift it means that
[40:45] somebody gave it to you amen it wasn't
[40:47] something that you achieved or you you
[40:50] will yourself into but you were given
[40:52] life and so in the Simplicity of it you
[40:55] would say say well you know my mom and
[40:58] my dad through a union of marriage and
[41:02] and I came forth as a product of that
[41:04] that love and that Union and here I am
[41:07] life came from my mom and dad and so you
[41:11] would say true that that that is in
[41:14] essence true but where did it come for
[41:18] them it had to start somewhere it had to
[41:21] have an origin
[41:23] somewhere now if you'll just excuse me
[41:26] for a a moment I I I'm going to take a
[41:29] little Divergence here and and then uh
[41:32] talk about science and many scientists
[41:36] you know would would begin to break down
[41:38] where life came from Life originated you
[41:42] know and and they would look at it so we
[41:44] we could go back and they would go back
[41:46] and begin way back in the beginning as
[41:50] far as they see it and what they believe
[41:53] would be the big bang theory that most
[41:55] of them would subscribe to and so I I
[41:58] read a little bit about that because I'm
[42:00] not real familiar with all of that but
[42:02] you know you can find out a lot of
[42:03] things if you just get on our modern day
[42:07] Google and start search and you'll
[42:09] you'll find out a lot of different
[42:11] things and so uh they they were saying
[42:13] that the Universe once was a
[42:16] superheated condensed single point and
[42:20] just bear with me for a moment and that
[42:23] single point at some point in time
[42:27] burst it just the Big Bang occurred
[42:31] right and and so out of that one instant
[42:35] they believed that there was somewhat uh
[42:39] two trillion galaxies that were birthed
[42:43] out of a bang and out of that there was
[42:47] a 100 billion stars within each one of
[42:51] those two trillion
[42:54] galaxies that came in into
[42:57] existence and began to move apart and
[42:59] they the science is going by observation
[43:02] they're looking at observation they're
[43:04] making their conclusion based upon what
[43:06] they observe right
[43:08] so somehow by chance if you'll bear with
[43:11] me there was a certain Galaxy that began
[43:15] to take shape and there was a certain
[43:17] star within that 100 billion stars in
[43:21] that Galaxy that began to take upon it a
[43:25] shape
[43:27] and planets begin to form and by chance
[43:31] they begin to uh orbit these planets
[43:34] began to orbit this one
[43:36] star and one of the planets settled into
[43:39] a a perfect position so that it would be
[43:43] in the right place Hallelujah so that
[43:47] that would be as we go through these by
[43:50] chances by Chance the size of that star
[43:54] would be just right
[43:57] the amount of heat and the amount of
[43:59] radiation from that star would not be
[44:02] too great or too strong and by Chance
[44:05] the orbit would be just far enough but
[44:09] not too
[44:10] far and by chance that the distance
[44:13] would be just perfect that it would hold
[44:17] that that planet in a perfect order to
[44:21] go around that star that is drifting
[44:24] through space in a in a a perfect
[44:27] harmony by
[44:31] chance too slow to be pulled in by the
[44:35] gravity of the
[44:37] star it would have it would have fallen
[44:39] into the into the orbit and went into
[44:41] that star and been
[44:43] dissolved if it's too far away or too
[44:47] high of a speed it would have drifted
[44:48] off into
[44:51] space at the same time there would be a
[44:54] a moon if you've ever looked at this and
[44:57] and you can appreciate the the balance
[45:00] and the Perfection of it that by chance
[45:04] this Moon would Circle this certain
[45:07] planet and as it would Circle this
[45:10] planet it would pull on that planet so
[45:12] that that planet as it went around that
[45:14] star would actually move to and fro on
[45:18] its line of travel around that
[45:22] star now this is all by chance right
[45:26] just the right distance this Moon would
[45:29] be to stay in that Perfect
[45:31] Harmony just the right
[45:34] speed and by all these chance happenings
[45:36] the conditions would end up just right
[45:40] that there would be life would appear in
[45:42] the form of a single cell amoeba or some
[45:46] form of single cell organism would
[45:49] appear and over time eventually begin to
[45:53] multiply into a multi cell
[45:56] creature or organism and and on up it
[45:59] would go and by
[46:01] chance all of this is happening just
[46:05] perfectly to bring forth life
[46:10] yeah and since it would move from these
[46:14] multicell organisms on up into what we
[46:16] know as animal
[46:18] life and it would be that animal life
[46:21] would require oxygen it would just be by
[46:24] chance there would be the right amount
[46:25] of oxygen in the atmosphere to support
[46:27] that
[46:28] life but yet if it was only the oxygen
[46:33] there and
[46:34] animals continue to reproduce the oxygen
[46:39] would not be balanced there would have
[46:41] to be something to make up the lack of
[46:43] oxygen and the the animal life would put
[46:46] off carbon dioxide which would begin to
[46:49] pollute the atmosphere over time so
[46:53] plant life would appear by chance
[46:56] to create a balance to the
[47:00] unbalanced and this plant life would
[47:02] begin
[47:04] to use the carbon dioxide and produce
[47:08] the oxygen to bring the balance that was
[47:11] needed all by
[47:14] chance there would be such a harmonious
[47:17] balance that life would actually
[47:21] continue and so if we'll just go by
[47:23] chance let's just keep going by chance
[47:25] by Chance by chance by chance you know
[47:28] by Chance the life moved on up and moved
[47:30] on up and then finally the chimpanzee
[47:32] and the and the the ape and what have
[47:35] you and then as science would say then
[47:37] there appeared a a missing link
[47:40] somewhere and then man of course we know
[47:44] what the missing link is so without
[47:46] going into all that but also that the
[47:49] atmosphere would by
[47:51] chance also be such that it would bring
[47:54] water inland because that would would be
[47:56] necessary for the Inland species and
[47:59] things to be able to exist so the
[48:01] atmosphere just so happens to carry the
[48:04] water in and dump it out so that it
[48:05] would be Inland as well
[48:08] right you know it's a lot of by
[48:12] chances I I believe it was my when I was
[48:17] in school for a period of time and uh
[48:20] college there was a physics Professor
[48:22] that was actually a Christian and he
[48:24] said that's why I am a believer is
[48:28] because if you take all these
[48:30] astronomical odds that are against it it
[48:34] takes more faith to believe that by
[48:36] chance this is
[48:38] here it actually would require more
[48:40] faith to believe that by chance by
[48:42] chance by chance he said the odds would
[48:44] be Beyond understanding when you
[48:47] multiply these odds against one another
[48:49] yeah it's all by chance and it's a huge
[48:53] by chance you have more chance of you
[48:55] know
[48:56] my goodness we can't even go
[49:00] there it's quite a quite a way to look
[49:03] at it by chance happenings it would take
[49:06] more faith to believe that than
[49:10] realizing according to him that there
[49:12] was
[49:13] one that was a supreme being in the
[49:17] beginning that created all of this in
[49:20] such Perfection and he said when I look
[49:23] at the Perfection of the order
[49:26] of the universe it declares to me
[49:30] there's somebody that's in
[49:32] control there's somebody that has
[49:34] designed this amen and we find in the
[49:38] Bible according to uh Genesis that God
[49:42] in the beginning breathed into Adam the
[49:45] breath of life and he became a living
[49:48] Soul so God gave life to mankind
[49:52] according to the scripture and by the
[49:55] word word of God he is the author of
[49:57] life he is the source of Life there is
[50:01] no other source of Life there is no
[50:03] other place to find life only by God he
[50:06] authorized it he wrote it he
[50:09] orchestrated it and he made it and gave
[50:12] it amen the Supreme Being the the source
[50:16] of life amen gave life yes sir where
[50:19] there was no life amen in the Garden of
[50:23] Eden before came in we know that the
[50:29] life that God gave man was a pure form
[50:32] of life it was pure it was not the life
[50:37] that you and I would say today I know
[50:40] what life is I've lived life I've been
[50:44] here and I've I've lived in this in this
[50:46] body of Flesh and I I know what life is
[50:50] I've experienced life the life that God
[50:53] gave in the beginning was not mixed
[50:56] with sickness with heartache with sorrow
[51:00] with troubles and most of all with sin
[51:04] and death that's right God gave life
[51:11] Only When sin entered through the fall
[51:14] so did all of these and we know that
[51:16] we're born in in this life and what we
[51:18] know is life been passed down to us from
[51:20] generation to generation and our our
[51:23] great great grandparents passed down to
[51:25] us and on down and on down that life
[51:27] that's been passed down to us is such
[51:30] that it
[51:31] includes sorrow and sickness and
[51:33] heartache and trouble and and death amen
[51:36] so we find in Psalms 515 says behold I
[51:40] was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[51:44] mother conceive me that's how we were
[51:47] born we come in that condition amen
[51:50] Psalms 58 says as soon as as as one is
[51:53] born they come speaking
[51:56] eyes so we came that way we came under
[51:59] the condition of a fallen nature and a a
[52:04] a a a sin nature was placed upon us by
[52:11] Design I said a big thing there because
[52:14] in the beginning God was not known to
[52:20] Adam like he's known to you true to me
[52:24] right and he had no way to express
[52:27] himself in the fullness of his
[52:29] attributes except there would come a
[52:32] Divine
[52:33] contrast to Perfection and come down
[52:36] into imperfection and come out of
[52:39] Eternity down into
[52:41] time and begin to reveal himself as who
[52:45] he really is Amen in him was the the
[52:49] abundance of of Beauty and the abundance
[52:52] of of mercy and the abundance of of
[52:55] healing and the abundance of of all the
[52:57] good things that he wanted to have
[53:00] fellowship with his son Adam but he
[53:02] could not in that perfect state so by
[53:07] Design God allowed the fall to come to
[53:12] reflect himself and make himself known I
[53:15] was studying here some time back about
[53:18] um refracted light and and looking at at
[53:21] light and we know that when you take a
[53:23] three4 uh prism a a glass object and you
[53:27] put it in the presence of sunlight that
[53:30] that sunlight will pass through that
[53:32] that prism and refract and it curves and
[53:35] it displays on the back side the rainbow
[53:39] colors that are visible to our our
[53:41] eye and I was looking at that and I
[53:44] thought that's that's really interesting
[53:47] and I began to to think I
[53:50] wonder if if that actually slows down
[53:53] that light so I got to reading about it
[53:57] and light passing through that prism
[53:59] actually slows down from eternity
[54:03] because the speed of light is eternity
[54:06] there's no time in the speed of light
[54:09] but when it comes into time and refle
[54:12] refracts itself opens up you see the
[54:15] beauty was hidden in the
[54:18] light God revealing his Sevenfold
[54:23] Beauty to you and I
[54:27] amen so we're born in this condition and
[54:32] born with a sin nature so again we'd say
[54:36] what is life I I again did a little
[54:39] Google search the first thing that come
[54:41] up life what's the definition life is a
[54:44] condition that distinguishes animals and
[54:46] plants from inorganic matter so it
[54:49] distinguishes what's dead and what's
[54:51] alive including the capacity for growth
[54:54] reproduction functional activity and
[54:57] continual change preceding death now
[55:01] that last part is what we don't we don't
[55:03] equate to life or we don't think about
[55:05] life but it's is just as much a part of
[55:08] life as being born that's right the
[55:10] beginning is birth the end is death but
[55:13] we don't like to think about the end we
[55:16] like to focus on all the the beginning
[55:18] and the good part because nobody's
[55:20] seeking for that
[55:22] end right so we don't think about it we
[55:25] go through life and we we put that in
[55:27] the back closet we don't want to think
[55:28] about
[55:30] that but we know it's just as much apart
[55:33] that's right Hebrews 9:27 tells us as it
[55:37] is appointed unto men once to die but
[55:41] after this is a judgment so it's an
[55:44] appointment yeah right and we're not in
[55:47] control of that
[55:48] appointment God's doing the scheduling
[55:51] he's the one that calls the number and
[55:53] says this is your day and this is your
[55:56] hour now these are sobering thoughts but
[55:59] this is this is
[56:01] reality now I was thinking of different
[56:05] things and I come across this quote uh
[56:09] many years back has done me real good to
[56:11] to share this and I believe it'll be a
[56:14] blessing to you but brother Bram had had
[56:17] shared this and this was a real uh good
[56:20] quote and says I was I was looking at a
[56:24] television picture where they let a man
[56:26] down I think two miles or a mile deep in
[56:28] the ocean and they had rays of light and
[56:31] they went out and showing marine life
[56:33] and there com a fish by horrible looking
[56:35] creatures and it's midnight ink black
[56:38] down there and they had phosphorus on
[56:40] their nose and they had no eyes and they
[56:43] have to be fed so it looked like to find
[56:45] their food they were Guided by another
[56:47] sense not by sight cuz they didn't have
[56:50] eyes and they couldn't use them down
[56:52] there and they were guided with another
[56:54] another sense that they could contact
[56:56] their food and he says and I skipped on
[57:00] down here says but now if that little
[57:02] fish could ever come up here and be me
[57:06] would he ever want to be that little
[57:08] fish again down in that midnight
[57:10] Blackness he'd never want to be a fish
[57:13] no more because he's something so much
[57:15] greater greater than a fish he's a man
[57:18] his senses are greater his understanding
[57:20] is greater his intelligence is supreme
[57:22] then multiply that by 10 million
[57:25] then you get what it is when you pass
[57:27] from this from this into the presence of
[57:32] God Yonder where the human being is so
[57:36] much further than what we are here you'd
[57:39] never want to be human being like this
[57:41] no more down in this pest House of
[57:43] sickness and
[57:46] Corruption now this
[57:49] creature has life it's not dead it has
[57:53] life it's got a form of life and the
[57:57] life it lives in is it is surrounded by
[57:59] Darkness it's surrounded by pressure
[58:01] it's surrounded by the the depth of the
[58:03] sea uh immense pressure down you can
[58:06] imagine thousands of feet down there
[58:09] would be an immense pressure that it
[58:11] lives in but it's
[58:14] unaware of what its condition is all
[58:17] right it's conditioned that this is
[58:20] normal yeah this is life for me this is
[58:23] how life was intended for me and and and
[58:26] it just goes about his life as if this
[58:28] is all life has for
[58:30] it this world has got a a conditioning
[58:35] element to it that conditions you and I
[58:38] to accept that this is all Life Is Life
[58:41] consists of uh you know of getting up
[58:44] and and young people going to school and
[58:47] and and you know the the the married
[58:49] people going to jobs and and and going
[58:51] about life and we live in this cycle of
[58:54] life and we continue and that's what
[58:55] life is and we look forward to the the
[58:57] good times taking a trip or a vacation
[59:00] or or acquiring something that we want
[59:03] but we get in this cycle of
[59:06] life but there's so much more right
[59:09] there's a
[59:11] higher life than that yes there is and
[59:15] it is a trap or a a a trick of the devil
[59:20] to get us wrapped up in that and spend
[59:23] days and weeks and years of our life in
[59:27] a cycle of what is proposed to be
[59:31] life but I submit to you the only source
[59:34] of life is Jesus Christ I submit to you
[59:38] that without Christ you don't even know
[59:40] what life is you don't know until you
[59:42] met the author of life and the source of
[59:45] life until he comes in your heart and
[59:47] Tabernacles in your soul you don't know
[59:50] what life is all about you have never
[59:52] experienced life because there's only
[59:54] one source of life and that's a Pure
[59:56] Life that proceeds from God down to a
[59:58] human
[59:59] being amen and Satan tries to pervert it
[1:00:03] and twist it and Rob you of what life
[1:00:06] was all about life is to be wonderful
[1:00:09] life is to be grand amen life is to be
[1:00:13] joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's
[1:00:16] what life God gave to the
[1:00:19] believer so often we live so low below
[1:00:23] the standards of what he gives to us his
[1:00:27] offering to you and me is
[1:00:30] life and that more abundantly yes amen
[1:00:34] so I began to think well what if there
[1:00:37] was a way to communicate with this
[1:00:40] creature and begin to describe to this
[1:00:43] creature and you can imagine with me
[1:00:46] being a creature and that's all that you
[1:00:49] knew was down in the depths of the sea
[1:00:51] and ink Blackness around you and the
[1:00:53] pressure
[1:00:55] yeah and then somebody come down from
[1:00:58] above of a higher level of a higher
[1:01:03] understanding yeah and come down and
[1:01:05] begin to
[1:01:07] communicate if you could only go up
[1:01:10] higher there's something so much more
[1:01:14] than where you're at there's something
[1:01:16] so much greater and begin to describe to
[1:01:19] this creature well you're in darkness
[1:01:22] and you don't even have eyes you don't
[1:01:24] NE eyes but there's a thing called sight
[1:01:28] and when you go up higher there's
[1:01:29] there's light and that light begins to
[1:01:32] reflect off of things and and the eyes
[1:01:34] allow you to actually see and and and if
[1:01:37] you go up higher and there's different
[1:01:39] forms of higher life above and and you
[1:01:42] go up higher well you you can actually
[1:01:45] Crest that that place between the water
[1:01:49] and there's a thing called atmosphere
[1:01:51] and air and when you break through that
[1:01:53] there's a thing called the Sun and
[1:01:55] there's there's sunlight that comes down
[1:01:57] and there's life and plant life and
[1:01:59] mountains and clouds and and all there's
[1:02:02] so much more yeah so much
[1:02:06] more and that
[1:02:08] creature would say well that's nice but
[1:02:12] I'm content to just remain here I'm I'm
[1:02:16] fine with life as I have it right
[1:02:20] now think about
[1:02:23] it say good question what is life what's
[1:02:28] it mean to
[1:02:29] me more specifically what's the meaning
[1:02:32] of my
[1:02:33] life and what's the purpose of my
[1:02:36] life because I believe that the author
[1:02:38] of Life gave you life and gave you a
[1:02:45] purpose
[1:02:46] so as a kid I was
[1:02:50] thinking you know life growing up most
[1:02:53] of us could relate growing up life had a
[1:02:56] lot to do with growing up wanted to get
[1:02:57] older so we could have this or do that
[1:03:00] or can't wait until I'm old enough to
[1:03:02] have a bike can't wait until I'm old
[1:03:03] enough to have a cycle and and each time
[1:03:05] you got to that stage there was
[1:03:06] something else just ahead that you
[1:03:08] wanted more I want more of that I want I
[1:03:10] want this I want that and when I finally
[1:03:12] get 16 I want my first car and when I
[1:03:14] get my first car then I want my first
[1:03:15] job I get my first job I I want my you
[1:03:18] know I want to meet that right girl and
[1:03:20] then I I want to you know what we know
[1:03:23] is life that's what we know is life and
[1:03:24] there's nothing there's not I'm not
[1:03:26] saying anything against that but there's
[1:03:27] so much more than just
[1:03:30] that
[1:03:32] amen you get married and start your
[1:03:34] family and and you need a better job and
[1:03:37] you need more income because things cost
[1:03:41] more and the cost of living is going up
[1:03:44] and so much so much pressure on us
[1:03:47] right and we get in that routine and
[1:03:50] that cycle of
[1:03:52] life just beating around the bush just
[1:03:55] going around and around and around if
[1:03:57] we're not
[1:03:59] careful we begin to dream you know
[1:04:02] always wanted to have that certain house
[1:04:04] that certain piece of land and so we
[1:04:06] work for that and we we get that and you
[1:04:08] know everything we we we achieve and
[1:04:11] everything that we gain and everything
[1:04:13] that we are able to attain
[1:04:18] to without Christ there's always that
[1:04:21] emptiness that still persists so true
[1:04:24] there's always that Hollow feeling to
[1:04:28] it I was thinking you
[1:04:30] know just for a good example brother
[1:04:33] Matthew just got a nice new truck
[1:04:36] but you you know what it's like you get
[1:04:39] something new and before you know it
[1:04:41] it's getting
[1:04:43] old I thought another five years brother
[1:04:45] Matthew still got the truck instead of
[1:04:47] his new truck it's the old truck right
[1:04:50] it it just it's just life it just time
[1:04:53] just keeps going and the newness the
[1:04:56] freshness the appreciation of it just
[1:04:58] kind of wears off and and then we're
[1:05:00] looking for the next thing right and so
[1:05:02] that's that's that's the that again is
[1:05:04] the cycle of this life that we're in and
[1:05:07] and time is another effect of the fall
[1:05:10] and time has its effect on everything
[1:05:13] and so I I was thinking I I've been
[1:05:16] pastoring now for just a a few short
[1:05:18] years in comparison to your pastor here
[1:05:22] uh it's right at I just had the six
[1:05:24] years now and uh I begin to think you
[1:05:29] know I I've in that short time I've I've
[1:05:32] had several times that I preached
[1:05:35] funerals um just so happened that when I
[1:05:38] took took over there was just several
[1:05:41] Elder ones in the church that was
[1:05:43] passing and and it was a privilege to to
[1:05:45] to to bury a saint or to you know it's a
[1:05:49] privilege uh when a saint crosses over
[1:05:52] to the reward and so I've been
[1:05:54] privileged to be able to speak but you
[1:05:56] know as I I would speak in those there
[1:05:58] was certain things that that I would
[1:06:00] like to bring up because sadly we again
[1:06:02] we don't we don't think about the end of
[1:06:05] the road until the certain times when
[1:06:07] we're faced with it a loved one passes
[1:06:10] or you know something and then we end up
[1:06:12] in a a place and we begin to think about
[1:06:14] you know the end of the road and and so
[1:06:16] the Bible says in Proverbs 4:26 Ponder
[1:06:20] the path of thy feet and let all thy
[1:06:21] ways be established so that's a that's a
[1:06:23] good thing for us even the young people
[1:06:26] here that you would take time to step
[1:06:29] back and Ponder the path of your feet
[1:06:33] where is this step taking me which
[1:06:36] direction am I headed in life is it
[1:06:39] going to take me closer to the Lord is
[1:06:42] it going to take me closer to to to the
[1:06:45] the most important things we got to we
[1:06:48] got to establish something in our heart
[1:06:49] what is the true priority in my life
[1:06:52] what is the most important thing in life
[1:06:55] what what matters more than anything
[1:06:57] else is it a full bank account is it the
[1:07:00] house we're wanting or or these things
[1:07:02] or is it God in our life is it God in
[1:07:05] our home is it God Amen the center of it
[1:07:08] all amen and your walk with
[1:07:11] God your walk with God is the most
[1:07:13] important and crucial thing that you
[1:07:16] will ever attain to is walking with
[1:07:21] him so pays to
[1:07:24] consider where are my steps pointing and
[1:07:29] where are they taking me and a couple of
[1:07:32] things that I heard that I held on to uh
[1:07:35] you know when you he hear certain things
[1:07:36] it just kind of stands out to you it's
[1:07:38] like that is so true and one thing that
[1:07:41] I heard years ago was a radio Christian
[1:07:44] counselor and he was talking about um or
[1:07:49] I was on the on the radio and he was a
[1:07:50] Christian counselor and he was talking
[1:07:52] to somebody answering questions and this
[1:07:54] man it was his lot that he would go uh
[1:07:58] at least more than once and he would be
[1:08:01] the counselor that the uh I believe was
[1:08:03] a baseball team it may have been a
[1:08:05] specific team that hired him but it was
[1:08:08] a professional baseball team he said if
[1:08:10] I was to name the names of the the
[1:08:12] athletes he would readily know them and
[1:08:14] he said I time after time would come and
[1:08:19] in counseling sessions and meet up with
[1:08:22] these professional athletes
[1:08:25] young people again think about this CU
[1:08:28] we're talking about life and all life
[1:08:31] has to
[1:08:32] offer and these young men would come and
[1:08:35] they pull up in their you know the topof
[1:08:39] thee line sports car the top-of-the-line
[1:08:42] luxury car or whatever and pull up in
[1:08:45] the parking lot and they'd get out with
[1:08:48] their beautiful wife and they'd come in
[1:08:52] to sit down they just left their
[1:08:54] beautiful mansion and their bank
[1:08:57] accounts full and they're playing ball
[1:09:01] for a
[1:09:03] job and they would come in and he said
[1:09:05] it has amazed me how many times I've
[1:09:07] been asked this question by these young
[1:09:10] men they're they're 22 25 whatever in
[1:09:14] the prime of Life they're athletes
[1:09:16] they're famous they're they're they're
[1:09:19] healthy they're they they're not
[1:09:20] suffering in their body they they're at
[1:09:22] the very pinnacle of everything come on
[1:09:26] nothing lacking if they want something
[1:09:28] they get it cuz they got the m to do it
[1:09:31] right and they would one by one come
[1:09:33] with the same
[1:09:34] question you know I work so hard to
[1:09:37] achieve my dreams and I've got to the
[1:09:40] top and everything seems to be fulfilled
[1:09:43] what I what I really wanted I I I
[1:09:45] achieved and here I am in the major
[1:09:47] leagues and here I am I I I I play my my
[1:09:50] passion is baseball and that's what I do
[1:09:52] for a living I've got everything
[1:09:54] right I've reached the
[1:09:56] top but one by one they say why do I
[1:09:59] still
[1:10:01] feel this
[1:10:04] emptiness why do I still feel like
[1:10:07] there's something
[1:10:09] lacking it's because God by
[1:10:12] design made a special place in a human
[1:10:16] heart that none of these things will
[1:10:19] ever be able to take that place no
[1:10:22] matter what the world has to offer you
[1:10:25] it will not feel that
[1:10:29] void years ago I was just a kid in our
[1:10:34] home I grew up in a a Baptist home and
[1:10:39] and they had we had TV I grew up with a
[1:10:42] TV and so I I remember this stood out to
[1:10:45] me there was a a an actor and he was in
[1:10:48] his later years and I'm sure you know he
[1:10:50] would be known if I knew his name but he
[1:10:53] was he was in his later years he's been
[1:10:55] interviewed and and this actor uh the
[1:10:58] reporter began to ask him said you know
[1:11:01] you pretty much reached all your dreams
[1:11:03] and all your goals and said uh if there
[1:11:06] was anything anything that you could do
[1:11:09] or if there was something that you could
[1:11:11] ask for right now you're at the end of
[1:11:13] life and you've you you're famous you've
[1:11:16] you've you've succeeded in life ain't
[1:11:19] that something what the world calls
[1:11:21] success in
[1:11:22] life you you reached top you done it all
[1:11:26] you're
[1:11:27] successful but at the end of the road
[1:11:29] you know what his answer was if there's
[1:11:32] one thing that I would want and desire
[1:11:36] is a place of peace and
[1:11:41] contentment and here we sit and we think
[1:11:44] we don't have much but if you've got
[1:11:47] Christ in your heart and you know that
[1:11:49] peace and you know what it is to walk
[1:11:51] with God you've got what the others
[1:11:54] would long to
[1:11:56] have amen and all your searching and all
[1:12:01] be sure amen that you get Christ in your
[1:12:05] heart amen
[1:12:08] hallelujah so these professional
[1:12:10] athletes these Hollywoods and so many if
[1:12:13] you would hear look out and see the kind
[1:12:15] of Life they live the the life that
[1:12:17] they're they're reaching out for drugs
[1:12:19] and alcohol and and their big times and
[1:12:22] they live immorally and all these things
[1:12:24] it all screams out there's an emptiness
[1:12:27] there there's something lacking there
[1:12:28] there's something they want that they
[1:12:30] can't find and so they're continually
[1:12:33] reaching out and they get tired of this
[1:12:35] wife they go to another wife and they're
[1:12:37] just constantly looking for that
[1:12:39] satisfaction in that place when all the
[1:12:41] time if they would just turn and look
[1:12:44] back Amen to the one amen that gave them
[1:12:47] life and look up to him and say God I
[1:12:50] need you in my heart I need to know the
[1:12:53] Living God I need amen something more
[1:12:56] than what I have I need Jesus in my
[1:13:00] soul what a change it would be what a
[1:13:03] change in their life amen to have amen
[1:13:06] that very source of life living inside
[1:13:10] of
[1:13:11] them oh I remember when I come to the
[1:13:14] Lord and it changed
[1:13:17] everything the the the trees looked
[1:13:19] different the grass looked different
[1:13:21] everything looked different everything
[1:13:22] was new everything was alive there was
[1:13:25] no sadness there was no Gloom it was joy
[1:13:28] unspeakable and full of Glory cuz I'd
[1:13:30] met the author of my life amen there's
[1:13:34] nothing like it amen there's nothing
[1:13:37] that can
[1:13:38] satisfy like he
[1:13:41] does there's that sacred place in your
[1:13:44] heart money's not going to
[1:13:47] satisfy big times won't
[1:13:49] satisfy but there is one that'll satisfy
[1:13:52] amen yes there's one that'll F that
[1:13:55] empty chamber there's one amen that
[1:13:58] brings the satisfaction to you and when
[1:14:01] you find him Christ said when that man
[1:14:03] found that pearl of great price what did
[1:14:05] he do he sold out everything because
[1:14:08] he'd have found the the thing that
[1:14:10] mattered more than anything Yes sold out
[1:14:12] everything he let go of everything right
[1:14:15] the man that found the treasure in the
[1:14:16] field he sold out everything to buy the
[1:14:18] field because he found what was really
[1:14:20] valuable in life praise the Lord
[1:14:24] amen the Bible says taste and see the
[1:14:28] Lord is good and I'm reminded of a story
[1:14:31] that was shared about the Infidel that
[1:14:34] was in a a a group setting and he was
[1:14:37] making his case why he didn't believe in
[1:14:39] God he didn't believe there was such a
[1:14:40] thing as God and and he was making his
[1:14:43] case and there come a man and I believe
[1:14:45] overalls came walking up just an old
[1:14:47] country bumpkin he had he had an apple
[1:14:50] in his hand and a knife and he was he
[1:14:52] was cutting off pieces of it stick in
[1:14:53] his mouth and he walked up the center
[1:14:55] aisle to this
[1:14:56] Infidel and Infidel said what do you
[1:14:58] want he said I got a question he said
[1:15:01] what is it he said this apple is it
[1:15:06] sweet or is it sour the man said well
[1:15:09] how should I know and he goes my point
[1:15:11] exactly turned and walked
[1:15:14] away taste and
[1:15:16] see the Lord is
[1:15:19] good he is wonderful amen he he is the
[1:15:24] sustainer of our life he is the source
[1:15:26] of your joy he's the source of peace
[1:15:29] he's the source of contentment amen he's
[1:15:34] Everything Jesus said in John John
[1:15:38] 14:6 he said I am the way the truth and
[1:15:42] the life and no man cometh unto me unto
[1:15:44] the father but by
[1:15:46] me not just a way or one of many
[1:15:50] ways I am the way life the
[1:15:54] truth the life I am the life the life
[1:15:59] you're wanting it's in Christ the life
[1:16:02] you hunger for is in Christ The
[1:16:05] Emptiness you need filled is in Christ
[1:16:07] amen that's right praise the Lord
[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:13] amen there's so much life in Christ that
[1:16:15] one day he passed a funeral as a widow
[1:16:19] of n whose son had died and he was so
[1:16:22] full of of Life yes that when he came
[1:16:26] and he approached that funeral that that
[1:16:29] funeral was broken up because in him is
[1:16:34] life that Widow was crying for her only
[1:16:36] son his heart went to her he went over
[1:16:39] and touched the beer the Bible said and
[1:16:41] the man that was dead rose up out of
[1:16:43] that grave out of that funeral casket
[1:16:45] amen because life meant death and life's
[1:16:48] greater than death amen there was
[1:16:50] another time that jiah's daughter was
[1:16:52] sick and Christ was on his way and they
[1:16:54] came and said don't trouble him she's
[1:16:56] already dead and he said where is she he
[1:16:58] went and broke up all the mo the morning
[1:17:00] and all that and all the sadness because
[1:17:03] life came where there was death and when
[1:17:05] life Came Death had to leave amen when
[1:17:07] life showed up death had to know its
[1:17:09] Master amen life come on the scene and
[1:17:12] death had to scatter and I say amen
[1:17:14] that's what life does here amen when you
[1:17:17] find the Life of Christ amen and death
[1:17:20] has to scatter sin has to scatter de has
[1:17:23] to scatter turmoil has to scatter
[1:17:26] because he is a source of Life Pure Life
[1:17:31] not mixed up life not compromised life
[1:17:34] not perverted life not Twisted life but
[1:17:37] pure life the essence of life
[1:17:42] amen Lazarus family was
[1:17:46] mourning they lost their the precious
[1:17:49] brother 4
[1:17:51] days he said it's too
[1:17:54] late it's too late he's gone if you'd
[1:17:57] only been
[1:17:58] here it's never too late for the Lord
[1:18:01] that's say it again it's never too late
[1:18:05] for the Lord whatever you have in life
[1:18:09] it's never too late for the Lord right
[1:18:14] and so when Christ came he spoke these
[1:18:17] words and said he said unto I believe it
[1:18:20] was Martha he said I am the res
[1:18:22] resurrection and the life he that
[1:18:25] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:18:27] shall he live now that's a great that's
[1:18:29] a great
[1:18:31] statement a man making a great
[1:18:34] statement but he was life that's true he
[1:18:38] was not making some claim that he
[1:18:40] couldn't back up so when he come to that
[1:18:43] that
[1:18:44] grave and he said roll away the stone
[1:18:48] they said no no you can't do that it's
[1:18:50] too late it's too bad it's stinks by now
[1:18:53] it's it's it's such a horrible mess if
[1:18:56] you'd only come sooner maybe we'd had a
[1:18:58] chance he said roll away the stone did
[1:19:02] not I say that you would see the glory
[1:19:04] of God and when he
[1:19:06] spoke I love it when he speaks when he
[1:19:10] spoke his word takes preeminence over
[1:19:13] everything and death had to give way to
[1:19:16] a man that was dead carried away four
[1:19:18] days journey and that Soul had to come
[1:19:21] back to that body and he came out of
[1:19:23] that grave amen that was more than just
[1:19:25] a man standing there that was almighty
[1:19:27] God that was a source of life that was
[1:19:30] the eternal power of almighty God Amen
[1:19:33] tabernacled in flesh amen amen had to
[1:19:36] give way and him was
[1:19:40] life he's the very Fountain of Life
[1:19:43] Jesus told in John 3 said verily verily
[1:19:48] I say unto you you must be born again
[1:19:53] yes the very first doctrine of the Bible
[1:19:56] is you
[1:19:58] must be born again and later he would
[1:20:03] say except a man be born again he cannot
[1:20:07] understand the kingdom of God it's a
[1:20:09] mystery but when you're born again by
[1:20:12] the spirit of God what was hidden to you
[1:20:15] and the creature that's down there in
[1:20:16] the ink Blackness and the Darkness and
[1:20:18] the pressure amen when that creature
[1:20:22] would submit itself and surrender itself
[1:20:25] and allow that Higher One to take it up
[1:20:29] out of that ink Blackness and in
[1:20:31] darkness it would find that there's a
[1:20:33] reality that's so much greater and so
[1:20:36] much higher and so much more amen than
[1:20:39] what you know amen if you'd only amen
[1:20:42] surrender it all to God if you'd only
[1:20:45] amen find a place and say Lord I got to
[1:20:48] know you I got to have you for myself I
[1:20:51] don't want just a a Bible I just don't
[1:20:55] want amen somebody talking about God to
[1:20:57] me I got to have God myself I got to
[1:20:59] know God myself it's not worth amen
[1:21:01] religion doesn't
[1:21:04] satisfy but a
[1:21:06] personal
[1:21:08] revelation and a personal experience
[1:21:10] with God Satan can't oppose
[1:21:17] that he said you must be born
[1:21:20] again not perhaps or you really ought to
[1:21:24] but you must the life that Mom and Daddy
[1:21:27] give
[1:21:28] you death has a claim on it there it is
[1:21:32] death has a claim on that life that's
[1:21:35] why we got an appointment that's why we
[1:21:37] talk about death because it's a part of
[1:21:40] life but when Christ came when the
[1:21:44] spirit of God when the angel came to a
[1:21:45] virgin called Mary and spoke to Mary and
[1:21:49] by the word spoke to her and she
[1:21:51] accepted that word from that angel and
[1:21:54] said be it unto me according to that
[1:21:58] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:22:01] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:22:03] the word was made flesh this is Christ
[1:22:06] being made flesh dwelt Among Us right in
[1:22:09] him was life yes in him so life came to
[1:22:13] her and she accepted life in the form of
[1:22:15] the logos the word coming to her she
[1:22:17] embraced it and said be it unto me
[1:22:20] according to Thy word yeah and in her
[1:22:23] from that moment forward things began to
[1:22:26] happen and
[1:22:27] change and it was never through any
[1:22:31] natural process of bringing forth life
[1:22:34] because this life had to be Pure
[1:22:37] Life not the perverted kind for Mom and
[1:22:40] Daddy but God himself creating within
[1:22:44] her a Pure Life that death had no claim
[1:22:48] on it that he came forth in a pure birth
[1:22:52] in a pure away he didn't come for
[1:22:54] speaking lies he didn't come for shaping
[1:22:55] iniquity he was not conceived in
[1:22:58] iniquity he was conceived by the
[1:23:03] almighty death had no claim on him when
[1:23:05] he walked through life and he lived a
[1:23:07] life unreachable no sin no no no no hold
[1:23:13] at all on him no sin at all he was not
[1:23:16] he didn't have sin nature he was
[1:23:18] perfect he had to be so death had no
[1:23:21] claim on him
[1:23:23] there come a day
[1:23:25] when the Passover was going on there in
[1:23:30] Jerusalem Israel was keeping the the
[1:23:32] Commandment that was given to them from
[1:23:34] the days of
[1:23:36] Moses and they were bringing their lambs
[1:23:38] to
[1:23:39] bring for the sacrifice each each Daddy
[1:23:43] had for his family for his household had
[1:23:45] to bring a lamb we know the scripture
[1:23:49] brought this lamb and the priest would
[1:23:51] take that lamb and began to look at that
[1:23:53] lamb and begin to examine that lamb he
[1:23:55] wasn't looking at the worshipper he
[1:23:57] wasn't looking at the daddy he wasn't
[1:23:59] looking at the
[1:24:00] mama they were they were they were
[1:24:03] spotted there's no mystery they were
[1:24:07] condemned no need to examine the
[1:24:10] worshipper all attention was upon the
[1:24:13] sacrifice examined it was there a spot
[1:24:16] was there a blemish was it worthy to be
[1:24:19] offered for this
[1:24:21] family
[1:24:23] not
[1:24:26] examining but at the same
[1:24:29] time in Pilot's judgment
[1:24:31] Hall Christ was there standing the
[1:24:37] examination he was been examined and
[1:24:40] scrutinized looked from head to
[1:24:43] toe is there any fault in him is there
[1:24:46] something wrong with this sacrifice they
[1:24:48] weren't looking at it that way but our
[1:24:51] sacrifice was being
[1:24:53] scrutinized
[1:24:55] judged and at the end the conclusion
[1:24:58] was I find no
[1:25:00] fault in him I find no fault in
[1:25:06] him now I want to submit to you
[1:25:09] that every man that approaches God he
[1:25:13] comes with some form of
[1:25:14] offering anytime that man come like the
[1:25:17] Rich Young Ruler that come he had
[1:25:19] something to offer he come and said good
[1:25:24] Master what can I do to inherit eternal
[1:25:27] life which was something different than
[1:25:28] the life Mom and Daddy give me what can
[1:25:30] I have what can I do to inherit that he
[1:25:34] said thou knowest the scripture keep the
[1:25:36] Commandments and and all these he said
[1:25:38] I've done that from my youth up I've
[1:25:40] been a good
[1:25:41] boy that was his
[1:25:43] offering but it wasn't good enough right
[1:25:46] he said but one thing thou
[1:25:49] lackest go and sell out
[1:25:52] yeah go and sell out now that's the
[1:25:56] point where Humanity gets in the way
[1:26:00] yeah the selling out part is a part that
[1:26:03] becomes the challenge to completely sell
[1:26:06] out I'm talking about selling out your
[1:26:09] wishes your dreams your future your past
[1:26:14] your present everything about you
[1:26:16] everywhere you're going to go whatever
[1:26:18] you're going to do in life you sell it
[1:26:20] all out and say Lord yes I give it all
[1:26:23] to you I'm yours to do whatever you want
[1:26:27] to do with me I give it all to
[1:26:30] you and if you ever come to that point
[1:26:33] with God you're going to find out there
[1:26:35] is a God to come down and meet
[1:26:38] you that's right thank you Lord so they
[1:26:43] took the Lord Jesus we know and
[1:26:45] crucified him and the third day he rose
[1:26:48] up because death can't stop Life Death
[1:26:51] can't hold life
[1:26:52] death has no claim on the life God gives
[1:26:55] we're talking about life the purest
[1:26:59] essence of life what is life is not what
[1:27:03] you have experienced down here in the
[1:27:06] form of our
[1:27:08] existence you think that's life but
[1:27:11] that's not
[1:27:12] life but the life that he gives it says
[1:27:16] in the Bible I came to give you life and
[1:27:18] that more abundantly more abundantly a
[1:27:22] greater level of living amen that's what
[1:27:25] Christ offers to us his offering today
[1:27:27] is life the Bible says he came not to
[1:27:29] condemn the world but that the world
[1:27:31] through him might be saved we we many of
[1:27:33] us know this we've been in church but
[1:27:36] I'm telling you amen that you've got to
[1:27:38] surrender everything to him you must
[1:27:41] surrender everything to him to have that
[1:27:45] life come and dwell inside of
[1:27:48] you so death couldn't stop life and he
[1:27:51] told the disciple he said you go up to
[1:27:53] Jerusalem and you T there until you be
[1:27:55] endued with power from on high and we
[1:27:57] know the day of Pentecost come and the
[1:27:59] Holy Ghost was given Peter stepped forth
[1:28:01] with the Keys of the Kingdom on that day
[1:28:03] when the men and Brethren said what men
[1:28:05] and Brethren what shall we do and we
[1:28:07] know in Acts 23839 said then Peter said
[1:28:10] unto them
[1:28:12] repent
[1:28:14] repent turn from your ways to God
[1:28:21] yes be baptized every one of you in the
[1:28:24] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:28:26] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:28:29] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise
[1:28:32] is to you to your children and to them a
[1:28:35] far off even down into 2000 and 23 the
[1:28:40] promise still
[1:28:42] lives them a far off even as many as the
[1:28:45] Lord Our God shall call the very life
[1:28:49] that Christ lived he said you go and te
[1:28:52] in Jerusalem and that life when I go up
[1:28:55] and Ascend I'm going to send back that
[1:28:59] life that token life that life is going
[1:29:02] to come back into you and live in you
[1:29:06] because God was descending we know the
[1:29:08] story how how God was above in the
[1:29:11] beginning he was above mankind then he
[1:29:14] came down in the form of Flesh and dwelt
[1:29:16] with mankind but that's not good enough
[1:29:18] he wants to be in you he wants to live
[1:29:20] in you he wants to walk walking you and
[1:29:22] talking you and have fellowship with you
[1:29:25] he wants to be your God and you be his
[1:29:27] people that's the whole essence of the
[1:29:30] Gospel that's a good news amen God wants
[1:29:33] to offer you life he wants to give you
[1:29:35] all the fullness of
[1:29:37] life
[1:29:39] amen praise the Lord thank you Lord 2
[1:29:44] Corinthians 5:9 says to it that God was
[1:29:46] in Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:29:49] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:29:51] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[1:29:54] word of reconciliation to reconcile us
[1:29:56] to bring them back into the same
[1:29:59] standing or the right standing that they
[1:30:02] lost in the beginning so Christ came to
[1:30:04] bring us back so that we could have
[1:30:07] fellowship with him again with no
[1:30:11] hindrances with no holding back with
[1:30:14] nothing there between right now amen if
[1:30:17] you are here and you're filled with the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost there's nothing between you
[1:30:22] and the Lord there's
[1:30:23] nothing praise the Lord amen there's no
[1:30:27] hindrance to you there's nothing amen
[1:30:29] that Fellowship amen that he purchased
[1:30:31] at Calvary that is bought and paid for
[1:30:34] and that is for us Amen to walk with him
[1:30:36] and to talk with him and to dwell with
[1:30:38] him and to have that restored walk and
[1:30:41] fellowship with the Lord that's what
[1:30:43] it's all about is to be able to walk
[1:30:45] with him and live in that presence
[1:30:49] praise the
[1:30:50] Lord brother Braham shares this story
[1:30:53] about Daniel
[1:30:55] Curry and he was a well-known Minister
[1:30:58] and I'm sure many of you are
[1:31:00] familiar about 150 years ago in the
[1:31:02] middle eastern part of the United States
[1:31:05] he was a sainted man one day he had a
[1:31:08] vision that he had died and he went up
[1:31:10] to the gate and he knocked at the gate
[1:31:12] and the man come out to the gate takes
[1:31:15] care of Heaven this is all a dreamer you
[1:31:18] know and he said I'm Daniel Curry
[1:31:20] Reverend Daniel Curry I'm the Evangel
[1:31:22] IST I've I've one lost thousands of
[1:31:24] souls to Christ said may I come in today
[1:31:28] my life is finished on earth and the man
[1:31:31] said just a moment he looked around
[1:31:33] what's your name and he said Reverend
[1:31:34] Daniel Curry and he looked and he said I
[1:31:36] don't even see your name
[1:31:37] nowhere he said sir you must be mistaken
[1:31:40] you must be I won thousands of souls he
[1:31:44] said I'm an evangelist he said sir
[1:31:47] here's the book I have no record of you
[1:31:49] being here said you might appeal your
[1:31:51] case to the white Throne judgment and he
[1:31:53] said sir he said he said that's the only
[1:31:56] thing that I can tell you and he said do
[1:31:58] you want to appeal your case he said I
[1:32:00] have I have no choice I I have to you
[1:32:03] have not my name I H I must appeal and
[1:32:06] he said he was taken through space and
[1:32:08] it seemed like about an hour and for
[1:32:10] finally he come into a light and he said
[1:32:12] that light got lighter and lighter and
[1:32:15] lighter and lighter until he was a a
[1:32:18] million times brighter than the Sun and
[1:32:20] and he was trembling
[1:32:22] right in the midst of that no certain
[1:32:24] object but just in that light and he
[1:32:27] heard a voice say Daniel Curry was you a
[1:32:30] minister and he said yes I was and he
[1:32:32] said did you ever do anything wrong in
[1:32:34] in the earth he said I thought I was
[1:32:37] pretty good man until
[1:32:41] then he said I I done wrong he said did
[1:32:45] you ever tell a line he said he knowed
[1:32:47] he said some things that was shady and
[1:32:50] he said yes yes sir I'm guilty of lying
[1:32:54] he said did you ever take anything that
[1:32:55] didn't belong to you and he's no and he
[1:32:59] yes yes sir I have he said Daniel Curry
[1:33:03] was you perfect on Earth he said no Lord
[1:33:07] I wasn't perfect I wasn't perfect and he
[1:33:11] said I was just listening for that that
[1:33:13] voice that moment that voice would burst
[1:33:15] and say depart from me he said he heard
[1:33:18] a voice sweeter than any mother's voice
[1:33:21] that ever
[1:33:22] spoke and he said he turned to and to to
[1:33:26] look to his side and he saw a face a
[1:33:28] sweetest face he'd ever seen in his life
[1:33:31] he said that person standing there said
[1:33:34] father Daniel Curry wasn't perfect on
[1:33:36] Earth but on Earth Daniel Curry stood
[1:33:39] for me and now up here I'll stand for
[1:33:43] him you take all his iniquity and put it
[1:33:47] on my account and I'll stand for him
[1:33:50] here hallelujah because he stood for me
[1:33:52] on
[1:33:56] Earth it's a sobering
[1:33:58] thought very
[1:34:00] sobering because in all of our goodness
[1:34:04] when you talk to somebody about you know
[1:34:06] the Lord and and what they you know well
[1:34:09] i' I've been good I've done I've done
[1:34:11] nice things I've helped here and I've
[1:34:13] done this and and they start reminiscing
[1:34:16] over the good things that they've done
[1:34:18] because man wants to have an offering he
[1:34:20] wants to bring an offering Cain was the
[1:34:22] first one Cain and Abel and Cain he
[1:34:25] brought an offering he felt like was
[1:34:29] worthy in himself he felt it was worthy
[1:34:31] he he wasn't playing games he wanted to
[1:34:33] worship God he came and brought he built
[1:34:35] his altar just so and he he made it just
[1:34:38] so he was sincere he seriously wanted to
[1:34:41] worship God he wanted to bring an
[1:34:43] offering before the Lord but the Bible
[1:34:46] tells tells us that he had no regard he
[1:34:49] had no respect unto his offering because
[1:34:51] it's what came it's what he could
[1:34:54] do God's not looking for what we can do
[1:34:57] right so Abel in the back part of his
[1:35:01] mind he remembered that Mom and Dad told
[1:35:04] me that when the fall happened and they
[1:35:06] were taken out of the garden that the
[1:35:08] Lord slew a an animal a lamb and placed
[1:35:13] those skins upon mom and dad so that
[1:35:17] they would be covered from their
[1:35:19] nakedness and he had a Revelation that
[1:35:22] that must have been pleasing to God so
[1:35:25] while Cain was decorating his Altar and
[1:35:27] making his offering to God and saying
[1:35:29] but I've been a I've been a good guy and
[1:35:31] I've done this and I've I've helped the
[1:35:33] poor and I've done this over here and
[1:35:34] I've done I I I tried to treat everybody
[1:35:36] just
[1:35:37] right then I'm hoping for the best
[1:35:39] that's how people approach the end of
[1:35:41] life I'm hoping for the best I've been
[1:35:43] pretty good I've done good deeds I'm
[1:35:46] really not that bad of a guy a lot of
[1:35:48] people like me but when it comes to that
[1:35:52] time that offering is
[1:35:55] refused there's only one
[1:35:57] offering only one offering that will be
[1:36:00] accepted on that day and that's the
[1:36:03] blood that Christ shed at Calvary no
[1:36:06] other offering will be
[1:36:08] accepted there's no other offering in
[1:36:10] the sight of God that will make it all
[1:36:13] man's righteousness are as filthy rags
[1:36:15] in the eyes of
[1:36:17] God that sinless life that Christ so
[1:36:21] Abel's there hacking away and making a
[1:36:23] mess of his altar but he had a
[1:36:26] revelation it's not what I can do but
[1:36:29] it's this blood is a covering in my
[1:36:32] place in my stad I deserve to be this I
[1:36:35] deserve it by my actions I deserve this
[1:36:38] but it took my place and that was only a
[1:36:41] four type of Christ taking our place at
[1:36:43] Calvary and it tells us that no matter
[1:36:46] what we do and how good we are it's
[1:36:48] never going to be good enough until we
[1:36:50] recognize in US dwells no good
[1:36:53] thing true nothing nothing to
[1:36:58] offer no goodness I've been a pretty
[1:37:01] good guy that's wonderful but that won't
[1:37:04] work in the presence of the
[1:37:07] almighty these are sobering
[1:37:12] thoughts we
[1:37:14] must and I I'm going to I'm going to try
[1:37:17] to just bring this down to a finality
[1:37:20] right here
[1:37:24] you got to identify with that
[1:37:29] sacrifice brother Andrew uh Bann and we
[1:37:32] were visiting earlier and he didn't know
[1:37:34] it but he he referred to something that
[1:37:36] stood out to him and I thought that was
[1:37:39] already on my
[1:37:40] heart when we identify with our
[1:37:43] sacrifice I don't know if you've ever
[1:37:45] watched but in the Old Testament when
[1:37:47] they brought their lamb the worshipper
[1:37:49] would take that that that lamb and he
[1:37:52] would look it right in the
[1:37:54] eye and he'd put his head to forehead
[1:37:57] looking in the eye
[1:37:59] y believing that his sins were being
[1:38:02] transferred onto that animal all his
[1:38:06] guilt would be upon that animal yeah
[1:38:08] that that animal had to die in his
[1:38:11] place until you
[1:38:13] identify with the Death
[1:38:16] Christ paid at Calvary until you look
[1:38:19] him in the eye until you put your head
[1:38:21] to his head until you feel the pain that
[1:38:25] your sins brought to him until you
[1:38:29] identify to the depths of the
[1:38:32] agony that you caused him yeah I tell
[1:38:36] you when you really identify with what
[1:38:38] he did for you oh my there ain't enough
[1:38:42] that you could do to express your love
[1:38:44] there's not enough that you could give
[1:38:46] back an expression of a return of love
[1:38:50] when people get the wrong impression
[1:38:53] about serving God and they think well
[1:38:55] it's a dos and a don'ts and this no sir
[1:38:58] it's a love affair with him it's only
[1:39:01] based out of love and what God did for
[1:39:04] you and if it's based on anything else
[1:39:06] that ain't worth nothing but when it's a
[1:39:09] response to what Christ gave you and
[1:39:12] what he did you amen that amen is your
[1:39:15] motivation amen that's what motivates a
[1:39:17] Believer Amen to be faithful to the
[1:39:20] house of God to be there and be
[1:39:22] accountable to be the one amen that
[1:39:24] stands up and says I believe God I'm
[1:39:26] praising the Lord no matter what anybody
[1:39:28] else does I know what God did for me I
[1:39:31] know how real he is to me I know the
[1:39:33] life I lived and I know the life he gave
[1:39:36] me I know amen for me amen I am going to
[1:39:40] serve the Lord because he's worthy what
[1:39:43] he did for me I could never repay it all
[1:39:46] I can never give him enough praise I
[1:39:48] could never rejoice in his presence
[1:39:50] enough there's not enough Praise In My
[1:39:53] Soul worthy to the king amen I can never
[1:39:57] give him enough my faithfulness amen I
[1:40:01] could never be faithful enough to
[1:40:03] express it I could never sacrifice
[1:40:06] enough to to to begin to express when
[1:40:10] you really know when you really
[1:40:13] identify with what Christ done for you
[1:40:16] that day at Calvary when you really take
[1:40:19] him in your hands look at in the eye
[1:40:22] yeah and
[1:40:23] realize that was for me that's what he
[1:40:26] did for me thank you Lord and if he had
[1:40:28] not done that for me I would have
[1:40:31] nothing at the end of the road it would
[1:40:34] all be empty just like these people said
[1:40:36] there's nothing I'm empty I have nothing

[1:42:28] go through the motions and the cycles of
[1:42:31] Life come down to the end of the road an
[1:42:34] old man old
[1:42:36] woman all we have left is to to look
[1:42:40] back at all the good times that we had
[1:42:43] and that's all there
[1:42:46] is that I submit to you there's so much
[1:42:49] more there's so much
[1:42:53] more Jesus said I'm the way the truth
[1:42:56] and the life I I'm the door to the
[1:42:58] Sheepfold any man that tries to enter
[1:43:01] some other way is a thief and a robber
[1:43:04] there's only one way Christ is that door
[1:43:08] he's the only door that leads to
[1:43:11] life but I tell

[1:48:31] B praise the Lord did you enjoy
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:36] that what is
[1:48:39] life I think that's a good question what
[1:48:42] is
[1:48:44] Life As We Begin our lives and we start
[1:48:46] to
[1:48:47] live the world wants to present a
[1:48:50] picture of what living is all
[1:48:54] about you get the image set before you
[1:48:56] and now in the age we live in through
[1:48:58] technology and through TV and television
[1:49:01] and fashion and
[1:49:04] entertainment we start to have a
[1:49:06] perception of what life is all about and
[1:49:10] we're constantly wanting to make more
[1:49:11] money and get a better job and have a
[1:49:13] nicer car
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:18] and but is that really Liv Liv is that
[1:49:20] really
[1:49:22] life then maybe you come to a place
[1:49:25] where you say you're a Christian and you
[1:49:27] believe in God and you believe in Jesus
[1:49:29] Christ and and you've made a decision
[1:49:31] that I'm a
[1:49:32] Christian well I want to ask you then
[1:49:35] then why why do you still run after the
[1:49:38] things that the world has to offer you
[1:49:40] still need entertainment you still need
[1:49:42] cigarettes you still need alcohol
[1:49:45] there's things that you're still running
[1:49:46] after because really there's an
[1:49:50] emptiness that you're trying to
[1:49:52] feel there's a void and maybe you've
[1:49:55] you've tried to make an effort you've
[1:49:57] tried to make a decision and I am a
[1:49:59] Christian I believe in God but yet you
[1:50:01] still have you still have things that
[1:50:04] you you got to run to for your peace and
[1:50:06] when when when things get hard and and
[1:50:09] you you get under that stress and that
[1:50:11] tension you're tempted to smoke or I I
[1:50:13] just want to have a drink or you know I
[1:50:15] don't want to forget about everything I
[1:50:16] just want to watch a movie but I say
[1:50:18] what about Christ yes amen
[1:50:21] amen that's that
[1:50:23] emptiness because I want to tell you you
[1:50:26] could make all the money in the world
[1:50:27] you you could have the the greatest job
[1:50:30] that that there could ever be as we we
[1:50:32] so uh uh uh well heard of it put forth
[1:50:36] of people of wealth and financial
[1:50:38] success they would always come to the
[1:50:40] place why do I feel so
[1:50:44] empty and you know you can come to a
[1:50:47] place in your life where you can be born
[1:50:48] again and filled with a whole Holy
[1:50:51] Ghost and yet you go through some trials
[1:50:54] and you go through some heartache and
[1:50:55] you go through some pain and you say why
[1:50:57] do I feel so
[1:51:01] empty that's the time you turn to the
[1:51:04] Lord say Lord maybe I've I've gotten a
[1:51:08] little away from you

[1:51:13] pretty good but I feel empty
[1:51:17] inside before we sing this song I
[1:51:20] just want to ask you

[1:51:26] way you're living and doing the things
[1:51:28] that you're doing and you're constantly
[1:51:31] looking for an outlet or a release or
[1:51:33] something to take away the stress and
[1:51:36] and it's just uh you're having uh your
[1:51:39] ups and your Downs maybe it's because
[1:51:41] you've never known
[1:51:42] them you believe in him you you know God
[1:51:45] is real you believe in Jesus Christ but
[1:51:47] do you know him

[2:07:13] Place for
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:17] me my sin and my iniquity is too great
[2:07:22] Lord for me to think
[2:07:25] of but it wasn't too great for you to
[2:07:27] carry to
[2:07:30] Calvary because your love conquers
[2:07:33] all Lord we just want to tell you we
[2:07:36] thank you for your love
[2:07:38] tonight when we were unlovable Lord you
[2:07:40] loved us and you made a way for us
[2:07:44] Lord you brought us to the house of God
[2:07:47] tonight Lord where if it wasn't for your
[2:07:49] love we would be somewhere out in the
[2:07:51] world somewhere out in some bar
[2:07:53] somewhere out in some Club maybe in a
[2:07:56] prison jail or in the grave but Lord
[2:07:58] you're you're God of mercy and
[2:08:01] compassion and Grace and your love
[2:08:03] reached down and you pulled us up out of
[2:08:05] the muck and the mire Lord we were that
[2:08:08] creature down in the darkness and the
[2:08:10] depths of darkness and pressure Lord and
[2:08:13] you are that higher being that come down
[2:08:16] and said you're my son you're my
[2:08:18] daughter
[2:08:19] you don't have to live like this
[2:08:21] anymore I paid the price for your sin
[2:08:24] and I've made a way that you can come
[2:08:27] out of that pressure and that condition
[2:08:29] down there in the
[2:08:32] darkness you took us by the hand Lord
[2:08:34] you started to walk us out of that
[2:08:37] darkness and little by little Lord
[2:08:40] you're leading us into that great
[2:08:42] light until that day we're caught away
[2:08:45] into a Rapture how we thank you and love
[2:08:47] you for that Lord
[2:08:49] you see the hands that were lifted up
[2:08:51] Lord they they want to serve you Lord
[2:08:55] and they recognize that there's an
[2:08:57] emptiness inside they recognize that
[2:08:59] there's a
[2:09:01] pool and Lord we know that pool come
[2:09:03] from
[2:09:04] you therefore it's God working in their
[2:09:09] life so Lord they've wanted to repent
[2:09:12] and I pray that they know that there's a
[2:09:15] a pool here that they can be baptized in
[2:09:17] to fulfill your word that they can be
[2:09:19] filled with the Holy Ghost and others
[2:09:22] lifting their hand that maybe they've
[2:09:23] been obedient to that word but they're
[2:09:25] still Desiring to be filled Lord you saw
[2:09:27] that lifting of that hand so now God
[2:09:30] we're going to go in faith knowing that
[2:09:32] you gave the
[2:09:36] promise heavens and earth will pass away
[2:09:38] but your word will never pass away so
[2:09:42] Lord we rebuke the enemy that tries to
[2:09:44] cause doubt knowing when we go from
[2:09:46] these doors the enem is going to try to
[2:09:48] pluck that seed out that been sown but
[2:09:52] Lord we're we're mindful of that we're
[2:09:53] going to water this seed with our praise
[2:09:56] and water in faith and in your word Lord
[2:09:58] knowing that it has to bring forth of
[2:10:01] its kind and we thank you for that now
[2:10:03] Lord bless each one as we go our
[2:10:05] separate ways Lord may you restore under
[2:10:07] brother Bryce all that he's poured out
