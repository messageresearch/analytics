want to be in one mind and one Accord this morning so we just ask for the Forgiveness of our sins Lord where we failed you in our iniquities where we've come up short but we're thankful there's a blood sacrifice to atone for our sins this morning we know in ourselves we're unworthing we know that there's nothing that we could do to Merit the grace there's no works that we could perform that would make us worthy to go in behind the veil this morning but because you climbed a Hill Called Golgotha you spread forth your arms and you said it was finished and you shed your blood to atone for our sins once and for all and you've said there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Lord we identify with the promise this morning we identify with the word this morning Lord that we are forgiven Lord and if then we've been forgiven and we've been Justified Lord there should be a freedom in the house of God lord we're free from the bondage of sin we're free from the oppression of the world this is a place of Liberty Lord this is a place to Rejoice this is a place where demon Spirits are cast out this is a place where we realize who we are Lord this is a place where people are healed this is the place oh God in your presence where all things are possible so now oh God we're just dying out to our own thinking we're dying out to our own ways Lord now and we're just laying down at your feet and saying oh God just move amongst us have your will Lord have your way father we commit every thought every uh doing Lord into thy precious hands that you could just have your perfect will and way in the service we commit the singing of the songs the musicians Lord the deacons all the way to the back the little children all the way to the man of God that

strength unto him father keep him bring them back to us Lord God all of the needs that are represented here Lord Jesus we commit them to you father because we know that you're faithful your word will never return void so we're standing Upon A sure promise Lord with a great expectation that you are moving amongst us Lord we love you we commit the service to you and we ask all these things in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you welcome to the house of the Lord you can turn around and shake the hand of somebody tell them God bless you right by the mic at this time for a Psalm reading thank you foreign you know we over the last few weeks at work we've been uh it's been a significant amount of reorganization going on where uh you know new leadership coming in new ideas new organizations and you know we're going through this parade of being reintroduced to new Executives who all show up and want to declare how they're going to make our lives better how they're going to make our customers happier you know all the appropriate noises that you expect from a leadership team when they come in and um you know we were pulled into one of these all hands meetings this week and the sales leader got up and as part of introducing himself and the priorities for the year he presented his personal life plan and they're in front of hundreds or perhaps a thousand people he described in great detail his uh values his mission statement his plan and it was pretty comprehensive I mean it took a while to really absorb this thing um you know he had broken down his values into 10 things you know and he had built what he called a blueprint for his life and it uh it defined the life purpose he had established for himself 20 years ago and uh you know who he wants to be it laid out his mission statement um those are his words um of where he wanted to focus and then every year he reviewed and adjusted a personal one two I wrote this down I mean it I can't even think this make this up his personal one three five ten and 20-year plans as well as inking every year his rest of Life Plan he had a life coach he uh defined five daily practices that he maintains to keep himself disciplined his five core beliefs that sort of services goal post reading all of this you know at the bottom laying at the foundation of all of this was the this was all in a presentation was laying what I pretty quickly recognized were the attributes of the stature of the perfect man bill so I was looking at that and I thought for my first reaction was wow I am a worm and no man I mean I can barely make it through the lunch line and I mean he's got he's got everything laid out and my you know my second was that you know I'm a complete waste you know I've been failure but then I thought how exhausting is that I mean imagine how much time he spends keeping himself lined up with his 38 point plan that he's been managing for the last 20 years you know but I thought about that as here he was he had it all figured out right this was his plan for how his life was going to go how he was directing himself looked good it looked amazing looked exhausting but you know as he was going through that the scripture came to my mind from Matthew 6. that said which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature you know it it looks amazing but no matter how comprehensive up of a plan he may have he can no more govern or guarantee his future than anyone else you know here was his great plan sitting upon the stature of the perfect man you know I walked away from that and I thought you know there is only one perfect man and by the grace of God he's put us in contact with that blueprint you know the perfect man continues in Matthew 6 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed verse 32 for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness not my plan not my blueprint not my mission statement and all these things shall be added to you verse 34 take therefore no thought for the morrow let alone 20 years for the morrows shall take thought for the things of itself you know this business executive may have a great plan a compelling mission statement but I have another blueprint straight from the perfect man and you know he may have these thousands of things that he wants to attain to but this blueprint has one bullet point David says it in Psalm 27 4 One Thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life you know you want to talk about a blueprint for the perfect man we're going to read Psalm 132 this morning and we're going to read around you know Lord willing his blueprint his plan his mission statement you know the scriptures say that David was a man after God's Own Heart he had a heart just like that perfect one the perfect man you know what was his life plan we'll read it here in Psalm 132 it started he starts out with Lord remember David in all his afflictions how he swear unto the Lord and vowed unto the Mighty God of Jacob but then notice verse 3. surely I will not come into the Tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed I will not give sleep to mine eyes nor Slumber to my eyelids until here's the goal here's the plan until I find out a place for the Lord inhabitation for the Mighty God of Jacob one thing have I desired and I will pour all my efforts into that will I seek after that I may find that place of his habitation that I may enter into that dwelling place with him and be found in his presence all the days of my life that's it that's the plan that's the mission statement verse 13 for the Lord has chosen Zion he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it I will abundantly bless her provision I will satisfy her poor with bread I will also clothe her priests with salvation and her Saints shall shout aloud for joy our blueprint our mission statement not our 20-year Life Plan one thing have I desire that I may dwell in his house in his presence all the days of my life so let's read Psalm 132 together as much as I appreciate the more comprehensive business plans and personal goals that might be seen this is my prayer that this business plan that this mission statement if you will be found in my life let's read that together Psalm 132 Lord remember David and all his afflictions how he swear unto the Lord and vowed unto the Mighty God of Jacob surely I will not come into the Tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed I will not give sleep to mine eyes or Slumber to mine eyelids until I found out a place for the Lord and habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob Lo we heard of it at Ephrata we found it in the fields of the wood we will go into his Tabernacles we will worship at his footstool arise O Lord into thy rest thou and the Ark of thy strength let thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let thy Saints shout for Joy for thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed the Lord hath sworn in truth unto David he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy Throne If thy children will keep my Covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them their children shall also sit upon thy Throne forevermore for the Lord hath chosen Zion he had desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it I will abundantly bless her provision I will satisfy her poor with bread I will also clothe her priests with salvation and her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy there will I make the Horn of David to Bud I have ordained a lamb for mine anointed his enemies will I clothed with shame but upon himself shall his crown furnish amen foreign God bless you you may have your seats um let's just sing that song this morning the

your greetings for my pastor we're gonna also this morning we'll have a baptism sister Jeanette lulia will be baptized so we'll get ready right after uh service this morning let's open our Bibles in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 17. the scripture will say this therefore this I say therefore it says and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not after the Gentile walk in the vanity of the minds it says having the under the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of the heart whom being passed uh past feeling have given themselves over untolessness to walk all uncleanness with greediness by ye have not so learned Christ I want you to think that now is is drawing a contrast between how they Gentile walk and how you should be walking it says if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust it says be renewed in the spirit of your mind that ye put on the new man he was wanting you to know how you're going to have a successful walk is by putting on the new man the former conversation the former thinking the way of doing things and the way of of approaching situations and saying I want you to put that off and you put on the mind of the new man and then he says which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore putting away lying and speaking every man truth with with his neighbor for we are members one of another let second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17 we read it last time he says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things will pass away behold all things are become new all things are passed away behold all things will become new in other words there is no correlation between what the old man was and what the new man is there is no something that could be brought over he said well this was good let's take it over now the old things will pass away everything has become new the thinking is new the way of approach is new the way of doing things is new let's also open and uh turn to Romans chapter 12 verse 1 it says I beseed you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice so is is exalting as he's praying is admonishing us to present our body as a Living Sacrifice a Living Sacrifice that we take our body we make it a victim you you make your body a victim you take your body you bring it under subjection you take your body you make it a slave you take your body you subject it to something and then it says holy uh uh sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service it says it says and be be not be not conformed old-fashioned according to the world it says transformed by the renewing of your mind it says that ye may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God now think about this now what he's saying here be not conformed so don't follow Fashion After just following and trying to do it says but be it transformed in other words is to be changed from one form to another form when there's no trace of the old form at all there's a complete transformation by the renewing of your mind that ye prove that ye may prove that what is it what it what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered in your presence Lord we ask that you speak to our hearts oh God father we we we so much gathered here for your word oh God and and know that we have needs and we have desires and all of those can only be fulfilled Lord by by being in your presence and by Your Word speaking to our needs oh God and we pray this morning that you may come just by our way Lord and speak to us as we look upon you and we wait upon you we ask those things in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats I want to say this and and just by way of introduction we said it last time and I think as we live our life in order for for us to get to where we we get uh we become a successful Christian or in order for us to even be called Christian we have to understand that we we cannot live by the old man we have to live by the new man we we have to come to a place where we understand that we were not made to just be the smaller people that walk around and eat and and drink and do all of those things we have to come to the understanding that we were made to live by the word of God the the we were made to live by the promises of God we were made as the scripture says men men cannot live by bread alone by by every word that comes out of the mouth of God we have to come to a place where you understand that your job is not what directs you your environment where you live is not what governs you whatever you do every day is not what governs you what governs you is the word of God if you understand that your life will be different but if you are always subject to what your boss is telling you or what your job is saying oh oh the the you know the we we are now in a time where there's a bunch of layoffs and there'll be companies they're dumping people left and right and all those things if you are affected by that then you're living by the old man but if you're living by the new man you will not be affected by that you know Satan always tries to draw a picture that this is what you are stuck with oh that it's your job that provides for your rent it's a job that provides for your food it's a job but a Believer comes to a place where you say I'm not living by the provision of the devil I'm living by the provisions of God that I have the job I have because God let me have that job and if that job goes away God will give me another job and that's how you become a successful Christian is to understand that you are not tied to the moral Kingdom you are are not tied to Satan's Eden you are not tied to the God of this evil age but you are tied into the Heavenly Kingdom but when I'm says we have untapped resources a Believer as we sit here it's important we realize what the doctor tells you is not the final say the prophet will say whatever challenge you face it's not the end of you what you have been given is untapped resources when I go to the doctor it's not because I have confidence confidence that the doctor has the ability to change my life but it's because I know that God has placed him there to help me and if he cannot help me I have the right to go to God it's not the end of me people are depressed and people live miserable life and they are stuck and and and and every time the economy goes down and people commit suicide and all kinds of things why because they are they have taken themselves and tied themselves to the economy of man they've taken themselves and tied themselves to the things that the man's doing but as a Believer we have to come with an understanding that I'm not tied to the world I'm tied to the word of God and as long as God leaves I shall live also so we are made to live by the untapped resources that God has made available in his word we were meant to live we remain to be the living image of the Living God on this planet that's the promise of the day the things that God promised he said that in the end time he will have a group of people and we've been our pastor has been fellowshipping on the message the God of this evil age will touch on that some of those things uh in a little bit here but here we are is a saying that we are meant to be the living image of the Living God in fact you have to understand that I'm here I'm here this morning because God has elected me to be part of his bride in the end time and not just that but it's because my my body my flesh my presence here is so that the Living God can dwell in me and touch other people oh yeah we are we are so bogged down with our own challenges oh I got to get this done and and I got to get this done and and you seem to never get to finish what you were supposed to do on that day and and that kind of mindset will never get you to the fullness of what God is wanting you to do but oh if you can understand that these challenges will come and they will pass away I'm not tied to uh how many things I have to do in a day and all of that but I'm tied to the promises of God and I'm waiting on the Promises of God I'm here waiting that God can come and use this flesh that through this man I can touch a sick body and God will heal it according to his promise that's the promises our time and if you come back with that kind of mentality that I'm living by the new man that's how you're going to overcome the the Bible will tell us that we we need to understand that this whole man is not made after God this old man is made after the after after the flesh is made is a result of unbelief as we said last time is a result of what happened in the Garden of Eden because they had unbelief in the word of God and the unbelief produce everything that we see the it and I want to say this this morning if unbelief is able to produce what we see I wonder what faith will do our part of reach last Wednesday he said will I find faith when I come back and I want to say this what would Faith do but when it makes a statement and I'll just say it so because I want to save time he said when God made his first creation he looked upon it with love with Grace and he looks at it and he looks at it they says this is good that was his first creation that he made after he created everything from day one the scripture says he rested he looked upon his Creation with the potential that is created it for it to be he says if he did that for the first creation would he do anything different with the second creation he will do the same thing so in other words God is not looking at you this morning finding out well when are you going to grow up and I'm waiting here what are you going to do he's looking upon you and seeing the amount of wasted potential that we go through because we're trying to figure out things with our own mind and he's looking and you're saying I didn't make you to be what you are doing I didn't make you to to to be in sin and to try to solve things by yourself I made you to be dependent on my word and when you live by my word you'll become an overcomer oh my so so that's why we said last time it's important to realize that we must be born again this new man it's not you waking up in the morning and say well you know I heard the word I went to church and now I'm deciding that I should stop lying I should stop stealing and I'll try my best and I'll do all that I can so I can sub that's wonderful but that's not it this new birth is you coming into the image of the heavenlies this this new man is you coming right back in the thoughts of God that it made you in the beginning coming back into the image of what was in God's mind in the beginning this new birth is the new creation that's created after Christ oh my and the prophet will say this in the speaking of the new New Birth it says the new birth is a paradox oh I like that the new birth is a paradox that's right it says that's right can change a man's being he says we could preach a sermon right here a little bit it says see how a paradox he says take a man that's a disbeliever an unbeliever has nothing to do with it all at once changed from a renegade to a Saints oh my take a renegade change him into a saint a prostitute to a sister it's a paradox no one can give him a medicine or a shot or a dose of medicine or anything else it takes the hands of almighty God that alone to change a man well that's a paradox when a man is born again that's right a paradox are new oh my and that's why we're talking about this morning I want the hands of almighty God this morning to come and to touch my life it's not something that I woke up and just had a new mind and all of that no the hands of almighty God the Creator will come into your life will take away the desires of the world will take away the things of the world and make you a new creature make you hunger after his righteousness and you cannot hunger after the righteousness of God by your own self there has to be the hands of God that touched you somewhere and that's what we desire this morning oftentimes we come back with our theology we don't understand that will not get you far and let me say this you can you can fashion the old man you can try to fix the old man but he only gets you a a certain distance but if you are fashioned after the new man you are made for eternity people will come and will hear the word of God but you need to be touched by the Living God your desires needs to be changed from what they were into something new because Ian is only he's the one that can do it and no one else the prophet was saying the message Paradox and he'll continue on it says that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand they couldn't understand it it's just like the new verse today the new birth is a mystery to the people it says they can't understand it they don't know what what what what you mean it says they have belittled it they bring it down and saying well it's just because you believe something the devil believes the same thing and trembles it isn't what you believe it's what God has actually done it's not all because I believe the message no it's God from Heaven his change is sent forth his Spirit you heard the word of God and the Spirit came and touched you and change you from what you were do something new and that's what we desire this morning because without that we are just reformers without that we are just people trying to educate you in a different way and let me say this the word of God calls for total separation and this is not a separation like I said you read the Bible and say well I need to stop doing this no the separation is when the word is spoken something within your heart is awakened and the things that you used to do to enjoy all of a sudden you don't enjoy them no more and that's when you know it's God that's working behind it the things that you use to be comfortable with all of a sudden you no longer comfortable what it's God the hands of God at work that's touching you the things that you used to do and you walk around and you drink and you went back and it was just fine all of a sudden they don't stick anymore all of a sudden the same frames don't sound good anymore all of a sudden the same food is not testing good anymore that's the hands almighty God touching you otherwise it's you trying to perfect yourself but what we desire is something to be changed inside of us where the things that I used to hunger I don't hunger for it anymore he will say in Christ The Mystery of God we feel it says their new birth is Christ the new birth is Christ is a revel is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery it says that's the new birth now what are you going it says it says now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in harmony my brother my sister what we need to do this morning is not to come and try to argue about facts and or he said this here oh you don't believe this I see this this way no what we need is the harmony of the Living God understand this program or you you may have your Revelation here that's different from mine let's put our differences on the side let's come together with what we believe and let's see God moving on it God moves in unity God moves in the people that's United together God wants to do wonders and signs and things among us why they can't do it if we are divided if this one comes and pulled that way that one pulls that way but he's saying if you can take those people that have received that Revelation and they come together and they live together and see what God is going to do in the midst it says and God expressing his thought through the word by the same actions the same thing it did the same thing that he did making the word manifest he says oh if the church only knew its position think about that it says one day then the Rapture will go when he knows what it is now he's not talking about us coming and and and and just pulling aside he's saying if we can come and understand the unity that we have been brought here by God's word we have been brought here every single one of us that's born again of the spirit of God we are gathered here because of his doing when we come with our unity and we look forward to him he will come and do according to his promise we read this about the new creation last time he says the new creation is not the old made over it's not the making over it's not you coming and saying well I don't like really my flesh I don't like what I am I need to be I need to make some changes so I can get it into something I like no it says or it could not be called the new creation this is exactly what he says the new creation another it says it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the way of the flesh this is not God trying to stimulate your flesh God's trying to get you to shelter to scream and to say well because I or give you some fleshly identification to say because I did those things therefore I'm saved no he's saying that this is the new creation something that's starting inside of your heart something that's built after God something that's built after the image of God coming into manifestation in the old flesh it says it says that he says that's how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham Abraham and and Abraham and of Abraham's issued Through The Godly Isaac Isaac line but now out of every Kindred every nation and and every nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of Man by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself you you know it's it's really something that as Believers we really need to dwell on it because it's important you realize yeah we are but when I will say certain kingdoms is bringing forth is diseases it's bringing forth the the the all kinds of stuff and he's throwing it upon the Mankind and and everything and it's doing so and then at the same time the God of this evil age is saying I want you to live by my provision if you are sick I have a doctor if you're hungry I have food for you hybrid food for you to eat he's he's telling you you actually don't need Faith to live by I want you to come and live by my provision he is constantly pointing you to himself he creates the problem but then he comes with the solution he's looking at you and saying come I'll I'll give you you depressed come I'll I'll take the depression away but I'll give you something else I'll come and and come and and all of this and whatever we'll say technology and civilization and education and through those means he's actually making all of those things so he can call you by himself so you can come to him but the word of God is here to let you know that God's Army is here and is moving by the power of God to defeat him in those things and the question this morning is to for you for each one to ask ourselves by what provision am I living by am I living by the provisions of God or am I living by the provisions of the devil the scripture will say in whom we have also obtained an inheritance bring predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will he says it says in Colossians 1 and 18 it says and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence in second Corinthians 5 and 17 it says therefore in any If any man be in Christ he's a new creation all things are passed away and behold all things are new behold all things are become new now yeah talking about the new man and the prophet will speak and he will say uh he will say this he will tell us in uh he will speak and say it's important we come to the place where we examine ourselves to really come to a place where we see how is that new man how am I being affected by the new man or how is how am I bringing the new man out on display in my life to come I just spoke about the the uh Satan said and the God of this evil age remember the prophet was say he had six thousand years to build this Kingdom he's Eden and he has study men for 600 years and trust me you cannot defeat him by your flesh he knows the pinpoints the pain points and he knows exactly where to press and when to press he knows how to continually apply pressure so you can break in your flesh he said 6 000 years to build this and and the prophet will tell us how that he is here and and he's he offered Jesus he says I will give you this Kingdom if you worship me I will give you all of this that you see if you fall down and worship me and the the the scripture didn't say Jesus looked at him and said he doesn't belong to you he was actually the god of it the god of that the god of fashion the god of everything the god of entertainment the God of all those things the god of the things that we need to relax the god of things that we need to feel good the god of things that we need to to get away and and to to to help ourselves he's the God of all of that and so I want to say this the scripture will say in Revelation 13 and then they said and all that dwelled upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of in the in the book of the lamb in the in the book of the of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and I want to say this this morning Satan is fine if all we come this morning is I want to come to church if we come and you say well I just want to be a member in the church Satan is fine with it yes you say well I I just want to help my neighbor sit and he's okay with it because remember the deception at the end time it's not that Satan is coming is presented with himself as one with horns and everything but he's as a prophet will say he shows himself as the angel of Light one who's actually there to illuminate you to help you to show you the way light is what shows the way he shows he comes as one who's trying to help one who's trying to lead you and and and and the prophet will tell us that he will come and and and come the same way because the bride at the end time has to be placed at the same place that Eve was in the beginning so in other word what he did at the beginning was he changed one word he injected one word surely that God surely said that God surely so it's a twisting of the word of God taking one thing and just changing it little by little or changing just something small because we know that God cannot mix his gospel the word of God cannot mix with anything it will produce death let me say this if it's 99.9 the word and 0.0.0.1 something else it will produce death [Music] the word of God is not to be mixed with anything but the God of this evil age will come and it will inject something in it it will inject something just as small and by you thinking you're worshiping God you automatically think you're worshiping the devil now he doesn't have a problem you thinking you're worshiping God while you're worshiping him so he's okay receiving worship that's not even coming on the name he is receiving all of as long as it's done in the wrong way he will take it but the god that the god that we worship is the god of Purity he wants us to approach him with Purity oh my there's so much I could say this morning that that's why it's important the scripture says that we keep our bodies we understand what we were made for because it's important you realize that every word of God matters to God our Pastor said it last time the the the the Evangelical and the denomination they constantly have to modify the gospel so he can fit the need of the people of the hour in other words so if if it's good to wear pants well let's just move that we'll just keep on you know saying other things and will not add that anymore because well it's common you know everybody all the women are wearing pants so what are we going to do we can't talk about it anymore they take it out if it's not high heels it's a problem oh well you know it's now the modern gospel so as people are shifting away it's following them where they're going but that's not the end time message that's not the gospel that we have received the gospel that we receive is Purity in the word of God it what God Said in the beginning is to hold truth today why because it's not made by the elements of man it's not made to be sustained by its by man the word of God in itself is the life of God coming into manifestation it's made to feed the new man that's in you so Satan were coming he won't mind if this morning we come to church and say well I just want people to know that I was at church in the morning you know I just want to check the box and said I went to church it's fine it's not okay he doesn't have a problem if you just go with the flow you know and this presentation is always you know one day God will change me one day you know it's going to come I know I'm patiently waiting and it seems like whatever you're looking for is always trying to reach it you know just trying to go oh you know years goes by you know I'm waiting patiently Abraham waited that's not the gospel we have received what about him says that we are sitting in Heavenly places now there is not a promise to say it's going to come Rapture is now the change your body is now everything in the word of God is now the change of body starts with a new man once you've received the new man you already started your transformation remember he said that the new body will be around that person that's been built inside of you so when you don't have the new man you can't have the new body the things that God did is already finished everything about God is a finished word the moment he speaks it is a complete word so the children of God are only called to walk into those promises that he already made God wants us and let me say this Satan wants to weaken our resolve this morning he wants us to come and just be a church member and all kinds of things but the children of God are those that are burning with a heart's desire to see the Promise happen any moment any time and whatever they asking they want to see it right ten God I need this I'm not moving until it change I'm not going anywhere until it changes why because it's been revealed to them that it's today so I want to ask you this morning if you live by the new man how do you spend your time can you allocate your own time and ask your time how much is allocated to the new and how much is allocated to the old man how much are you feeding the new man because the new man is the one who's supposed to come and and by that you get the power to overcome the old man but how much heed how much time how much effort how much are we putting into you only get what you reap remember you you get what you expect isn't that the scripture if you come expecting nothing you get nothing if you come expecting for God to move God will move for you if you come whatever you ask is what's going to be given to you so we need to understand with the word that we have received there has to be a people that come into an understanding that I have been recent given on top resources from Heaven I have been given access as a scripture will say an ancient shall be ministered unto you into the Everlasting Kingdom we have seen that entrance open and there has to be a people on the face of the Earth that are walking into that entrance and pulling down the promises of God not satisfied with the status quo well you know I'm just a Christian I'll do the best I can but a person who's living under the expectation under desperation to see God move at any time you can't hear about somebody being sick and just sit there and say well I send my prayer and God will heal no they had your heart has to beat a little faster you have to sit there I'm not getting off of my knees I'm not stopping this is not going to get off my mind until I see God move that's living after the new man and David will say this but as for me I will come into the house in the multitude of thy mercy and then in the fear it says and in thy fear I will worship towards the Holy Mountain or the Holy Temple and say again in Psalm 17 and 15 he says as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness I will be satisfied when I awake in my likeness I my satisfaction is when I see the image of the new man the image of God the Living God the living image of the Living God when I see the new man come in the image of what he made it to be that's when my satisfaction my satisfaction is not how much money I make my satisfaction is not what kind of car I drive my satisfaction is not what food I eat what clothes I dress my satisfaction is the new man coming into the image of the one that I'm beholding he says in Psalm 26 and 11 but as for me I will walk in thy integrity I will walk in my Integrity redeem me and be merciful unto me he'll say in Psalm 55 and 16 as for me I will call upon God and the Lord shall save me I want to say this perhaps this sounds foolish to you but it's okay you know they they spend a month we had a problem at working we've been trying to solve it for over 30 days and it seems like and it will happen for a section or 30 minutes every time you you know you get away and you get away it happened and so randomly will track the time but every time the child will change and so we just don't know what's going on and and so it the whole team is tired because we just can't get enough sleep and everybody is up all the time 2 A.M 3 A.M and things like that so I remember this about this is about 14 or 15 days ago and all of a sudden I'm just standing there they woke me up and I was so tired I finally I went to my computer and I just I just in my heart something just say God please help me find out what is going on and all of a sudden it happened again we got in the system and we were able to find what it was and we stopped it and we were able to run for a little bit with no issue I'm telling you you have to call upon the new man you say you pray over a computer Absolutely I'll pray because I understand my I'm not made to function by this flesh this man can only take me in a certain you pray over a computer and machine yes I it's made by the devil but I know God has the power to change it I think sometimes we keep this mind so much we need to lose our mind we need to renew our mind we need to understand we are supernatural beings that are made to live by the provisions of God that are made to live by the word of God let me say this the word of God will change any situation any place any time I don't care if you are in Hell God will change it I don't care if you and the devil big God can change it foreign natural Problems by the natural mind trying the best you can forgetting that there's a new man and they're standing by and just waiting to hear for you to call wait wait let me say this this morning I I want us to be successful Christian I want our young people to succeed in being a Christian I don't want we it's not even our pastor will say this it's painful to see our young people every time they come to the altar and then next time you see them the same people over and over there's got to come a time where you want a new man to function in them you want to see them succeed you you cannot sit there and watch them time and time again and your heart not be broken when you see somebody come over and over there has to be something rise up within you and say God I don't know what this says but I want you to come and do something for this person to just see somebody come and go and say well you know we had this many come to the altar that's not the gospel the gospel is the good news is to take that person and change them and make them someone who can operate in the kingdom of God so the Devil by deception he will come and he will he he remember it's not by changing the whole word of God it's by changing one thing and causing you to be stuck in a loop in a cycle where you never get the answer that you're looking for you never get anywhere you never get the patience or the love or the ability to understand how God is functioning he's okay with you being stuck that way oh my the prophet will say this and I thought this was so important now listen to this this is he's taking now speaking about the seriousness of life and how the Satan is a Deceiver is taking it and I want you to see the application of what he's talking about it said some guy got after me the other day and say why don't you leave them people alone always hammering at them the way by the about the way that they're dressed and the things they do it says if you are a prophet and say and they think you are a prophet I say I know he says but I says it says well they believe you to be then why don't you teach them how to see visions and walk before God and I said if they don't know ABC it says how am I going to teach them algebra if they don't know the kindergarten then it says don't know how to behave themselves don't know how to look and act and dress and and be decent how are you going to teach them prophetic things now I want you to to take that statement and take it in in regards to what the prophet is telling us about the kingdom the Satan's Eden if we can't because remember to overcome you have to see the devil and every single one of his tricks so if you can identify the trick of the enemy this is not just simply to say well you know he's talking about closing about it's about your ability to discern what Satan is bringing at you and he's saying that the basic keep it says that your body you may understand what your flesh it says that you give your body a Living Sacrifice that you may understand that you've been redeemed and you've been brought and the body right now for one that's one again it's made so God can come and dwell in it now we're saying that if that's the case why is it that you're failing to understand this little things that the devil is tricking you with now you remember you cannot become a giant Christian unless you come through the process you you cannot overcome big things unless you can overcome small things you cannot overcome big challenges unless you can understand what the small challenges is and yet we are but the prophet will tell us about the way we dress the way we conduct ourselves and all those things and we constantly uh hopping over it and looking for the Mysteries all the Seven Seals oh God manifested oh God the the the the the the evening light and all those things the evening light has come so it can take your body and make it obey the basic things but but and you will say this here it says Jesus says if they don't believe there's things here if they don't believe the Earthly things how are they going to believe if I tell them Heavenly things he says the things that you can do yourself stop doing these things it can't even do that how are you going to find spiritual things people are you going to find spiritual things people isn't that right yes sir now he will also uh say one one place if I could Skip and just get to it he will say one place uh you would talk one place and he will say uh the the and the reason for that he said it's because God don't want a Christian to look like the world there cannot be a confusion when the new man is in right there cannot be a place where there's confusion where you don't know if it's the new man or the old man that when the new man comes in he takes over when the new man comes in the first time sign is he changes the heart's desire so therefore whatever the flesh puts forth that's not of God the new men will tell him you know this is not it say this thing you know oftentimes people want to hear over the pulpit oh you know you don't don't dress this way or or you'll eat your heels I got to be this no you're looking for a man-made leadership that's not what God is offering you're looking for someone to be there to measure your skirt or your your heels or someone to measure how you talk or somehow that's not the leadership of God and not leadership will not produce anything that leadership when that leader is gone you'll go right back into the things you used to be that leadership will give gap for you to get away with a lot of things why because if he didn't say it you could get away with it but the leadership of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah there's a leadership by the Holy Ghost he'll take care of everything that the word is saying why because he's there he knows your heart he knows everything about you and even if it's okay with somebody else that leadership will tell you it's not okay with you that's the new man that leadership will say they doing it that's okay but that's not okay for you you this is how I want you that leadership will bring you as an individual who's built after God himself it's not going to be a copy of something else it's going to be an original that's what the Holy Ghost is for to remind you of the things that God has said let's not substitute the holy spirit with somebody or say well because the pastor didn't say it that means I can do it no if you sit down for some of you you can sit down and play games and all of that thing and you can say well I can play 30 minutes but others you can't even touch it why because it's the leadership of Holy Ghost man I've been around games they mean nothing to me why because it's the leadership that's in me other people can play for a little bit and be fine but the moment I just see it I can't touch it there's just nothing that wants it why that's how God wants us to be he now remember he says in this message message he's calling a people he's not calling a church he's calling individuals when he was rejected in the end time God called individuals he will say well God really didn't say that that's really you taking in way too far you just a hardliner you just don't want people to have fun have fun all you want as long as you know what's leading you but one of them said and I don't have time to just go through all of it he says it's the spirit that's leading them it's a go listen to it God of this evil age it's a spirit remember on the top of it when it comes it says from the beginning it comes and says now as God really lost control he said he says I believe in my opinion there's only two Powers there's a power of God it says the spirit of God is here calling forth is a light but it says the spirit of the devil is just so calling in unrighteousness it says there's only two so we are only influenced by those so there's a spirit that's leading you to do those things and not and let me say this don't ever think that your flesh can get too strong that it cannot be influenced by this spirit that's why you need the new man to always be there to OverWatch you need a new man to always be on the watch you need the new men to say what you just did is not it you stop doing this you go do that what you did this you cannot be done again this is the last time you need someone to overcome this body you need somebody to have the mean you know let me say this the devil wants to have dominion over you he wants to govern you that remember the mission from heaven or from the beginning was he wanted to be all for the stars of God that's always what he's wanted that's always what he's after but the spirit of God is here saying I'm not going to fall under the leadership of the devil they say not a leadership in me that's guiding me to the word right as God really said that yes he did is that really what it he comes and he will offer meaning and explanation how did we end up with all this denomination men explaining what God wanted to say but the prophet tells us God is his only interpreter don't let somebody explain to you what the Holy Ghost says go to God this holy ghost that you talk about this holy ghost that other people scream and shout then they come back and they do the same thing what is it I want some of that I want a taste of it myself so I can become a witness I want to stand and say that all of a sudden something changed in my heart I want to stand and be able to say that they know that it's the truth and God will give it to you but we're not come to be governed to where this message is so wonderful because it's important you realize this is the opening of the word and God is invited each one of us no one is subject to a preacher everybody is subject to one person and that's the prophet and the prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word of God is a one by the word of God comes to so if he says it you can stay with it and God will bring you the past a preacher here can explain why that don't mean that oh don't worry about the preacher or if the prophet said it I'm staying with it that's why when we play these steps is to get you in the mind to know what the messenger himself said if he say that the new birth is Christ coming in you I want to see Christ in me I don't want somebody to tell me some explanation well you know he looks like you're now doing good so that means you got it no God I want a true witness I want what you say to be my life say again it will say Satan is calling his bride by misinterpreting the word of God by air so first he's trying to to to to uh he will take the word of God and trying to misinterpret it and now he's calling it by air and and I'll say this but what I'm says the air starts right here and it's it might be this small it may be not even at that visible it might be so small that you won't even be able to see it but as you advance you begin to look at the result you will see that it's a distance apart how come if God said this how did I end up with something different if God said to do this how did we end up with something that's not it it's because there was an error introduced in what we were hearing there was an error introducing what was spoken why because if you hear it from God God is obligated to come and bring it to pass it says it's also by presenting you within his kingdom things that you can live by he's got his fashion we dress up his clothes at every day and if you're not careful you start looking for name brand you know um kyphen Klein you know I am Yves Saint Laurent you know I'm Gucci man I'm whatever you know what I mean that becomes yo you you create an identity you know when people see me they have to see Gucci you know what I mean and all those things we are meant to be worshipers we are made to be worshipers now think about this this worship is not a knowingly worship it's not a a purposeful mind worship it's a worship that's done by error in other words a person still thinks within the heart they putting their effort in it thinking the worshiping but God but they're worshiping the devil he says by his technology my I mean I don't even know where to start everything is technology nowadays you know now they they came up with uh I don't know you know I don't even know what I should say chat GPD whatever you know you just pause the question it gives you all the answers you don't even need to think even the things if you just think oh I don't know if that's the answer hey what is this boom references everything this means this it used to be you go you go on Google you search Google will tell you but Google will give you many answers so you have to pick which one is right but this one it gives you the right answer supposedly we are dying in the flesh all of this is only producing death death little by little but oh my I'm here to say this morning and I don't want to go too long there's another expression that God is trying to bring forth there's a bride who's here to express the thoughts of God that were in the beginning will say this will say this they will say he'll say he'll say so the outside the end time message is here to bring the expression of the new creation is here to bring forth what was in God's mind in the beginning same things that are to be brahmanam says now he says now the only way that we can be a son or a daughter of God because you have to be you have to have you have to have eternal life so I I like when the prophet does this because it's an understanding that what was in the beginning is what's going to be at the end he's wanting to to make sure that you are not introducing another element in between that will confuse the equation so he's saying if God is eternal if God was in the beginning if you are a son of God there is no way that you had some other beginning because if anything that has a beginning will have an end but he's wanting you to know that even though you are born in this flesh you came in this world you came in this room I am your origin always has to be traced to something Eternal because when you came here in this flesh even though you didn't know it you were still connected to something Eternal outside of that you just had a beginning like anybody else so he said you were a son and daughter of God it says that's the only form of eternal life and and that and that's God's life it says only only one form of eternal life and it was God and that says to be a Son of God you had to be in him always you had to be in him always you didn't get into God you were always in him and that's important because that's the image of the new man the thoughts that he knew he didn't come from some place you learned it the thoughts that's in you is the same thoughts that was in the beginning it's coming into manifestation because you were with him and so as he lived you shall live also it says the teen of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was every molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God are you demands that should speak volume to us because if this is not true then we can never overcome the only way we can overcome is by knowing by Believing by living by This Promise here the understanding that I was in God in the beginning I'm only here expressing yes the old men started out first that's all right yes the old man taught me 12 or 16 or 20 years of education that's all right yes I was caught up like in all kinds of things that's all right oh my like the story of an eagle but when you heard the eagle scream there has to be something that rises up that looks at the 20 25 years of education and say this means nothing to me I I know this was never in me to begin with this is something that I heard I heard a scream and that makes more sense to me than anything you are now exp you are now expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age the new man is the only thing that would overcome Satan's kingdom the new man is the one who will take this flesh and give God glory to it the new man is the one who understands that these hands were made to do the things of God this mind will make you think the right thoughts this body was made for me to dress like a Christian to walk like a Christian to behave like a Christian to bring the image of God into a living flesh only the new man has that understanding and the promise is only to that new man amen I know we have baptism this morning if the musician could come he says in God proving his word he says it says now I want you to notice he does it in the way he says that he does it in every in that way in every age he does it in every time by by the same method he has taken his Believers and then in order to have Believers to meet that word his God to predestinate it to that age thank you so as you see he's got to predestinate it the thing to be there to meet the challenge of that age when he predestinated anything to happen and said it will happen you know what the seed you know what the seed will be just the same at that time he's never failed he's never given his word and something else happened he's never promised and then we got something different so if that's true then why don't we live by his word if that's true then why don't we live by that new man if that's true if you find a place where he has failed then you have every right to disbelieve it but the prophet will say often at time he says if I ever told you something quoting Samuel that's never come to pass if I ever said something that God say with the Lord that's never come to pass if I in other words he's not putting me honest on himself he's placing you up on the unfailing foundation of God for you to know what you are built upon amen if the person is getting baptized if they could get ready he says Jesus is in the building tonight to perform miracles but it does it through his church Jesus is in the building tonight to perform and this isn't a message to witness paragraph 25 Jesus Christ is in the building tonight to perform miracles but he does it through his church what a place God God is not like the air he's not going to just move around and hover over and and then all of a sudden no he's going to dwell in the flesh he's going to stand up someone will get inspired someone will come and will lay the hands of mortal being on the person and something will happen someone will be inspired to speak the word and
