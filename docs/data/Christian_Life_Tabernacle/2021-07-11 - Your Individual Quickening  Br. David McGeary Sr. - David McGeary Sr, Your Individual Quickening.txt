this morning lord according to need bless each and every one lord as we come here to praise your name as we commit the rest of service to you in jesus precious name amen amen man happy to be gathered in the presence of the lord this morning amen in his presence we know there's good things it's always good things certainly trust that he will speak to us we want to welcome everyone all our visitors glad to have you with us as you invite brother mike for our songwriting god bless you good morning you know one of the things we hear almost every day is a constant reminder to exercise you know we're being constantly bombarded it seems everywhere we go of the need to exercise whether it's from our doctor or from it's the health and fitness community advertisements our spouse sometimes are watching our phone constantly hearing you need more exercise and why what is exercise really you know most of us think of it in terms of well it means working out means doing you know jogging or push-ups or lifting weights or inflicting some other kind of pain but if you look at the definition in webster's dictionary it describes exercise as this the act of bringing into play or realizing in action the discharge of an official function or a professional occupation in other words it's bringing something to pass through action or to perform the actions associated with a position you know that's all exercise is in health and fitness really it's you know a person envisioning a target body image you know that they want to achieve or maintain and then they begin to perform the actions necessary to get to that condition exercise you know someone's a police officer they exercise the functions associated with that position you know it would be a perversion to see a police officer someone who's wearing the uniform to be doing road construction or roofing a house or operating on a patient you know someone who claims a position demonstrates the actions or exercises the functions of that position you know exercise is mentioned in scripture just a handful of times jesus said this in luke 22 25 he's and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors so you know he was referring to the fact that in the gentile world there are there's kings who exercise their lordship their position and then there are those above them who give them power and exercise that by giving the power to the king so this whole idea of when you're in a position you exercise that position or if there's a goal or an objective that you're trying to achieve you take the exercise necessary to get to that position you know the word pops up here in psalm 131 we're going to read that this morning you know and this is david speaking a king someone who's in a position and also a man after god's own heart and he says this in verse 1. he says lord my heart is not haughty nor are mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me you know i thought that was an interesting statement here he is a king and he doesn't exercise himself in things that are too great for him you know i thought as i read about that what actions or thoughts or goals or activities or objectives might i be performing actions for that are too high for me that are beyond my position you know if a medical doctor were trying to direct traffic or putting someone under arrest that would be too high for them they're operating outside of their position they're exercising things too high for them if that's true we as believers who have a god-given position you know are exercising ourselves just in the position we've been given and not in affairs outside of what concerns us as believers a reminder to stay in our lane you know jeremiah 9 has an interesting chapter verse in here i love this it says this jeremiah 9 23 thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glorieth in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for these things i delight saith the lord the disciples often got caught up arguing about who would be greatest in the kingdom or you know who would be doing the greater things and jesus once had to tell them what is that to thee follow thou me you know as he was about to ascend into heaven they asked him lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power is the position after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me that's the exercise in acts 24 16 paul the first church age messenger said this and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward god and toward men and finally in first timothy 4 7 it says but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come you know and that little word exercise really caught my attention as i was looking at that and you know sometimes i wonder how much we or you know just even me get caught up performing actions exercising ourselves in things that are beyond the position that we've been given and just i thought it was an important reminder from a king from a man after god's own heart to be thoughtful to be careful that we're not exercising in things too great for me for us but rather that we're focusing on that which god has given to us to exercise which is to be witnesses unto him so thought about that as we read we read psalm 131 this morning it's just a little psalm i think it's just three verses we want to read that together starting in verse one lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eye is lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and forever amen amen god bless you and have your seats [Music] oh and do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling not to wonder where you're going when you die oh yes that's just how it is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] never having to look back [Music] [Applause] [Music] there never was [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] it's like [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you've just started your existence and where's his concern there never was [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh has been [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] praise god hallelujah amen aren't you glad it changed your life amen sister gina is a special he managed to come at this time amen um i just wanted to give a short little testimony um sorry if i can do it um as many of you know i graduated in may with my teaching degree um and at the beginning of the summer i started applying places and i interviewed with a school i student taught at they wanted me to come in for an interview and i went through two interviews with them and while we were out of town they called me and told me that they had picked a different candidate sorry so i was like okay um it's not exactly what i wanted anyways because the drive was far um so i just went on and um but when we got back in town i was like i don't have any other offers or interviews scheduled and you know most of the hiring for teachers were going on at the time so when we got back from our trip i went ahead and submitted a couple more applications to some different schools in different districts around our area in arlington but i kept getting emails that you know all the positions were filled and um so a couple days um after i had done all those applications and whatnot i heard from two schools in arlington and requesting i interview with them one of the positions i was interested in it was just something i didn't really want but the other school i was okay with it was a third and fourth grade um special ed position but i like the little kids more um it's just where i'm more comfortable um but i went ahead and interviewed with both of them and i ended up getting offered the third and fourth grade special ed position and i actually accepted the position when hr called me um they were like we want to offer you this job and we'll send over your paperwork to get signed that was last friday so i was waiting to get it notarized and whatnot that following week and that next saturday morning um i got an email from a director in mansfield isd um which is the district i originally wanted um but those were the emails i kept getting that all the positions were full um she wanted me to come interview for a pre-k position and um i looked at the school she was the director of and i was like oh wow this is so awesome it's basically like a children's museum in a school so i was like oh this is really cool and exactly what i wanted um but right before i had checked my email that morning i was at my current job at the private airport that i worked at in arlington and i had read proverbs 3 5 and 6 and it says trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all my ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths and i just happen we have big windows on um like i sit at a desk and there's just windows where we see the planes land on the ramp and there was just this huge rainbow out in the sky and actually a pilot walked in and he was like i was like did you see this and he was like yeah that's awesome the man upstairs put that there for me today and i said actually no i think you put it there for me so um it was right after reading that i saw that email and so i didn't believe that it was any coincidence um so immediately i called my mom and i asked her i was like would it be so wrong if i went and interviewed with this school because i've already said yes to the other position but i hadn't signed the paperwork or anything so it wasn't official necessarily so we talked it over and i decided to go so i went to that interview that following morning at 9am or that tuesday morning um and i just kept praying for god to direct me and lead me to the right place and um that same afternoon i got a phone call around four o'clock and it was the director offering me the job and it's exactly what i wanted and it doesn't feel like i'm settling anywhere that i don't want to be and the pay was the exact same and everything which is rare for school districts um so i just wanted to thank everyone who was praying for me at that time and i just want to thank god for reminding me that i'm not in control and he is and i just want to sing this song as a reminder of that i believe that you are god alone but sometimes i still try to take control cause i get scared when i can't see the end and all you want for me is to let go your parting waters making a way for me you're moving mountains that i can't even see you've answered my prayer before i even speak all [Music] i bring my praise before i bring my needs cause there's no fear you've not already seen i rest my heart on all your promises cause i have seen and know your faithfulness your parting waters making a way for me you're moving mountains that i don't even see you've answered my prayer before i even speak all you need for me to be is still and know that you are god be still and know that you trust that you are parting waters you whispered my name oh you answered my prayer your moving mountains your parting waters making away for me you're moving mountains that i don't even see you've answered my prayer before i even speak all you need for me to be is still be still [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord amen is mindful of our needs and then he sees what we need he sees our desires and amen if you can feed and take care of the flowers and do all of that how much more we amen we're certainly thankful for that amen we have a couple of requests you want to bring before the church don't forget tonight is our communion service the communion and foot washing and brother cosmic runs the adult choir will meet immediately after the after church in the sanctuary uh anyone who uh is willing to join please attend amen i know we have needs we don't have any written here but if you have a need upon your heart you may just lift your hand after him at this time and then he sees your heart he's our provider he's everything that we have made of amen amen the brothers that are taking the offerings if it could come at this time and but wait if you can just come and take this before the law [Music] let's powerheads father as we come before you lord what a wonderful reminder that was lord to remember that to put you first to seek your face you know our needs you know the desires of our hearts lord you just know the beginning from the end let us just put our hands in yours and be led thank you for your provisions lord the uplifted hands lord you know the need behind each one of those and what those situations are lord we'd assassin you'd undertake in each one of them lord father just we're so grateful you're so mindful of us and we just love you and appreciate you and just submit to your will [Music] in jesus name we pray amen oh god we'll make a way where there seems to be no way [Music] me closer [Music] where there seems to be no he works in wayne we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my god [Music] he will make [Music] amen god bless you church um a couple of days ago um i went out with the family and on my way coming back up my daughter was saying i'm having stomach upsets you know um and she kept on complaining mom the mom was like when you get home you find something to eat and she was like okay so when we got home she still hates and when about the time she was about to go to bed she was still putting in on the stomach hey mommy am i still my card so i mean instinct you know my instinct i was just like gabriella let me lay hands on it for you so i just put my hands on it and i just prayed and you know we just i forgot about it and um you know she woke up everything was fine you know i didn't pay attention to that um then i came back from work i believe on thursday or friday and my little niece was at home two three four days before that time she has been in so much pain i think she was waking up with a lot of um what do you call that high temperature and the day before i think that same morning they had to be at the doctor's uh office that the doctor told them if this persists you have to go to the er and i was like okay so when they came you know i just i was just playing with her and then um it was raised at home say lay your hands on her and just pray for her i was like in fact i forgot i was about to go to bed and i just came back and i was like let me lay my hands on you and i just prayed for her and um i think 20 minutes after that she has been crying she has been forcing i think she was very uncomfortable um 20 minutes after that i think they went out and then they came back in and she was quiet she was calm she was cool in fact she was playing she was laughing um the day after that you know we called i called and they said she's still doing fine i called yes i was just trying to follow back is the okay did my prayer worked you know um but it's just uh it's just the you know even when we're not paying attention it's just how much more god is just hearing us listening to us um i mean i never believe in coincidence never i've always never and it's because maybe i always have faith in that and go just try my best um and so when i see that i'm just amazed this morning my daughter now asked me to say daddy randomly daddy are you happy you know that question was like a million dollar question i had to think back so i started giving her the reason why i was happy i told her you know i prayed for you and you were fine i woke up this morning i feel fine everybody feels good uh the bride of christ is good i pray for every single one in my prayer and so i'm really happy that he hears me he hears us regardless of my condition and my circumstances he pays attention when i ask him and so this morning i'll be singing that song uh part of me uh standing on the promises standing under promises of christ my king through eternal ages let us praises rain glory in the highest thou washout standing on the promises of god [Music] standing still [Music] is [Music] standing on the promises that cannot fail [Music] by the living word of god i shall prevail

and i want to hide of darkness [Music] [Music] oh [Music] seeking your faith in your presence let's pray this morning our heavenly father we ask you to bless us this morning to be with us and continue to open your word to us bring us in remembrance of the things that you spoke to us father and father that we might find the food that's been stored up for us this morning that we might feast and grow we just ask you to bless us and help us in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning we want to in welcome those that are us streaming we know that we have some that watch but we just always want to encourage you just never let streaming be an easy way that you don't make the sacrifice to come to church you know and and i i really feel that's one of the things that our society is doing right now is taking the sacrifice out of everything you know that uh try to make life so easy that there's sacrifice involved and the lord really appreciates your sacrifice so uh we're gonna uh continue on in our our study this morning and we're gonna read in the scriptures from in the 12th chapter of uh the fifth chapter of the book of acts if i could say that and starting with the 12th verse and we want to read from the 12th verse through the 33rd verse so that that's from acts 5 12-33 that's a pretty lengthy reading so i'm going to have israel come and read that for me this morning he's going to be my new scriptural reader you know so we're going to ask him to read that scripture for us this morning if you would brother go ahead and read our scripture for us acts 12 through 33 acts 5 12-33 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomon's porch and and of the rest there's no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at least the shadow of peter passing might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the city's roundabout unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow then came one and told them saying behold the man whom he put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people they went the captains with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold you have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom he slew and hanged on a tree him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witness of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them that was better than me reading it but amen he reminds me of a great bible reader amen amen uh lord bless you this morning he may be seated certainly ask god to add his blessings to the word of the lord and and uh to the things that god's uh doing for us and uh so we're gonna continue on as we've been uh playing a portion of our this message easter seal and just going through it and taking out the things little nuggets if you would say it that way that would bless us to focus in on uh some of the uh things that many times might run by us and so we just trust that as we do this these things will be a blessing to you and and just there's there's some things that in general that our prophet of god keeps pointing out to us and uh and i think that uh we just want to touch on those before we uh listen to our portion uh this morning but one of the things that our prophet has been bringing out in this message is trying to bring us to the revelation and the understanding that the the transformation and the rap and the rapture or the resurrection the rapture being the final end of the resurrection but the resurrection process that the resurrection is going on now so it's not it's not something that is a future event but the living also participate in the resurrection and so it's been something that god has been preparing us for so he talked to us about how that this quickening power and that's what jesus said he said i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again and be with you and i will lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness and then paul said that if you have this spirit in you this spirit that's in you the spirit that's in you will quicken your mortal body so we we always think of that as change but it's quicking it's quickening our mortal bodies right now it quickens us from sin to righteousness it quickens the way we think it's a it's something that is going on and going forward so god's dealing with us preparing us and and we're growing into the resurrection and he makes this statement he says notice you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection that's right so we're in that it's that and you say well why is that important it's important that in living in this world that you're mindful that you're a part of something else and you've got to stay within that realm you're in this you're in something that you've been called to and the world has something that they're trying to achieve they're trying to look for eternal life through science and through medicine longer days longer life they're trying to hold on to life but the beautiful thing about this quickening spirit it allows you to let go of this life and take hold of another life the gift of god is eternal life and so we we we've got we see that we understand that that we're we're not it's not just something we believe and one day we're waiting for the results of our belief uh this this life i like some of the brothers like to use the the term it's a journey you know paul called it a race you know it's something that we're involved in right today that's going on every day i kind of look at it sometimes like an obstacle course that you know the enemy is is battling we have an enemy uh one of the prophets said that life was a constant warfare but we realized that we're part of a plan part of something that god is doing so he makes uh uh references to the things that we are involved in right now and uh and so we we wanted to always keep that in our mind and then uh i believe also he makes this statement he says and you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a rapturing condition already so we see that word bring grow so we we don't want to ever get in our thoughts and this is going to be something that's brought out here and what we're going to listen to that i believe this now i'm just going to hang on to that and and i'm going to live my life the best i can with no understanding that there is going to be change in you there's going to be things that change god's changing he's going to change you'll hear the prophet of god say quick in your mind there's there's absolutely something that that is working within us transforming us and we know like a seed that like if we have an apple uh that little seed in that apple if you plant that seed in the ground in the right condition when it germinates it will grow into an apple tree and it will produce apples and every apple that ever was in that tree was in that seed and and but it had to go to that great process so as we look at these things we understand that we're talking about easter and that easter was the seal and the real seal of it the real easter seal is that what that he promised he's doing okay so it's not just looking back that he resurrected okay but understand that that spirit that was in him has now come into us and is quickening and transforming us growing us into the resurrection growing us into the statue of a perfect man transforming us to rapturing condition and so if we could not always look at the rapture as a calendar event but look at the rapture as a rapturing condition it's when you get in that realm that you possess the spirit you possess the rapture you have that power in your life that you know any moment now what's in me can create within me the faith to step right over into another realm it's going to open up and so it's it's not something that we believe and he drew the line i won't go read the quote but he says it's not this becomes the possession and not just the belief thereof so we believe in the rapture we believe in the resurrection we believe in heaven we believe it but so where it trans forms and changes in you from something that you believe to something that you actually know you have and he tries to give us examples of that so our minds can catch it he talks about a deed an abstract deed so when you've got the title deed and you've got the abstract deed and everything then you know that you possess that land there's not a question about whether you possess that land so once you get that clear title that means that everything that was laid against that property has been paid for i'll give you an example in our country for example people will sell property well you're supposed to keep that property mode you're supposed to do all these you're supposed to pay the taxes on it well maybe that person wants to sell the property so you go down and you go to buy the property and you find out that there's things held against that property there's mowing uh uh they they put uh uh liens on it so you can so that lien says if you sell this property you gotta pay this mowing bill and then there's back taxes that haven't been paid and there's all these liens on it and so you can't you you can't possess the property as long as other entities or other people have a claim on it okay so you have to make that claim right well satan had a claim on you because of sin but what did he do he paid the price he paid the mowing bill he paid the back taxes he paid all those things for you and and then he sends down his spirit to let you know that your sins are forgiven they've been paid for they're not laid to your charge anymore and that you've got a clear title and now you become a possessor and that's why you've got to accept what he did for you at calvary you've got to accept the payment for your sin and you say well i accepted that payment once well you know what every time that there's something that the enemy tries to lay to your charge you have to go back and take his payment and pay it again if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive him he's not going to leave you he started to work in you he'll finish it he provided the token of the blood to be applied to your life so when you have a failure or you fall or or you stumble that price is still there it's a complete paid price all the way through so if you you just because you make an heir it doesn't mean that he has stopped what he's doing because what he's doing he did from the beginning he looked down he saw you he says this is my seed i spoke it i planted it it will do what i perform and then you're down here in the flesh you know having car wreck after car wreck you know daniel likes those car wrecks and uh and uh and and what does the father do he keeps them campaign the damages why because you got a assurance policy just like your insurance if that's paid it keeps paying you might go up well he paid the ultimate price so you've got an insurance so every time you have a wreck he's right there with the assurance policy i'll pay that i paid that i covered that i've already got that covered i already paid for that because when we were yet sinners he died for us so we never had to come to righteous the price was already paid for us through the blood of the lamb and so now we with that assurance you understand that even our faults and our struggles because we're growing and when you grow you make mistakes when you grow you do things the scripture talks as the enemy tempts us he puts something in our mind and then that drops into our life and it produces a work and sometimes the works aren't right now it's not the holy spirit that does that you understand so you can't say the spirit of god led me into sin or the holy spirit allowed me to do that that's the flesh and that wars against the spirit but so you can't say you know the holy spirit led me to do this that the grace of god would be abound in my life no god forbid that's exactly what it is it's unbelief but unbelief doesn't stop god and so you've got to always go back to where you left them always go back to calvary always apply the blood because there's only one place that god meets the believer and that's under the shed blood so that's what's sitting there you understand making making a petition on your behalf to the throne it can and every time that that there's a failure and and i know that we always look at it at sin as maybe some gross act but uh sin is unbelief you know sometimes if he tells you to do something and you you don't do it you know or you fail to live a sacrifice for him or or you know he would desire more of you and and a greater part in his kingdom or maybe he's commissioned you to do a work or he's he's called you to give more of yourself and you shun those things and you're not about the father's business and and you're you're doing other things that might be easier and more pleasing to the flesh well those things that that's a form of sin too but what's he going to do he's going to chastise you he's going to correct you he's going to deal with your heart the holy spirit's going to put you under conviction and it's going to pull you back to him thank god for that yeah and and i love the way that john put it he says a man who says he hath sin not is a liar but praise god we have that our petitionery and the blood of jesus christ making intercession for us on our behalf and supplying us the quickening power to overcome so this very quickening power that we're talking about this the spirit that god sent down on the disciples on the day of pentecost to bring alive in them he said now the spirit when it comes it'll bring you in remembrance of all the things that i said this great spirit that he sent down was sent down to perform the work that he desired to be done because we were hopeless and helpless to do this with our own intellect our own personality our own senses both outward census and inward census there was no way that we could ever get ourself in rapturing condition there's no way we could ever live a life to overcome we needed outside help you understand we needed something supernatural so even if you're it got a real bad habit going on in your life you you you need that quickening power to deliver you from that habit and that's there for you it's it's a struggle to try to overcome it that's right you know i mean here the problem comes from the flesh and we try to overcome it with the flesh and he said that it doesn't work you can't overcome the flesh with the flesh you know it's a failure that's right and and and the enemies he does everything he can to to war against our minds to war against our life the greatest thing that satan has in his arsenal is the rear-view mirror really that that that's the one of the greatest tools that he has is always bringing back to your remembrance well sure i can look back on my life and i just i don't know that there's any way that i'll ever make it even since i became a christian all the failures i had if i look at though there's no way i can i'll make it but i know there's a quickening spirit and it's by that spirit if the spirit that was in christ jesus be in you it will quicken your mortal body that doesn't mean the day of it it means the start of it it starts quickening your mortal body right then quicken equipment and changing so i know that if he's got an expected end if he's got a prophesied end and i've still got all these broken spiritual bones in my body i'm still struggling in all these things i know that that spirit will take control of that and he will remove those things from my life and perfecting me what he started and and so i i i now i realize that this power this quickening power this power in order to make me alive that's what's got to be working in my life so i got to move it from being something that i believe in to something that i possess something that i rely on something that i'm counting on to do for me what i can't do for myself yeah and you know it uh and i i know the world has a lot of medicines and a lot of things that they try to give to overcome and i'm all for them but when they when it comes to the point that they can't work anymore there's another power there's another answer from the great physician that can come down and do that work so so i say this don't give up on your friends don't give up on your loved ones don't give up on your children you just keep believing god because that quickening power can do all things right we're totally uh at rest in that so we read the scripture this morning and because brother brahm's going to mention this when we read about how they were afraid and how that they changed and so we we read the spiritual evidence of that they were put in prison and said you don't preach in this name the next night that night the angel comes down he says you go out and tell the people about this gospel and this life and there they are and they get pulled in front of the council and he says you're the guys that rejected them you know i i they they weren't afraid anymore and so we want to touch on that a little bit this morning and a few things if you would so let us we're gonna for those that have your phones uh i i never believe i say that but uh i uh you know that's just i tell people i got i'm i'm a old person okay i got books and so you know i i started out in this book and we started reading it and like i said they didn't come from the voice of god with all this mark on it but you know the more i get into it the more i marked and so here we are and this is how far we are right here well you notice the rest of it's not marked very much but we're going to have it all marked up by the grace of god huh just feed out of it feed out of it now here's the one thing that we want to establish as we listen to this is the prophet of god told us and i'm not ashamed to say that because he was a vindicated prophet of god promised he said the spirit has come to quicken the word the word doesn't make the spirit alive the spirit makes the word alive so you you so that's why the word had to come first so the word for our age had to come to a prophet the transitional of the age in other words the opening of the seals the establishment of the church age the revelation of the son of perdition who was that antichrist spirit so the word had to come and be preached that the spirit could come and quicken that word so it had to he so the seed in you is the is like the receiver you didn't receive it by your intellect you received it by revelation so the word came to you and you received it now the spirit comes and makes the word that you received come alive and put it in your life so many times you'll believe it you'll believe it you know it you listen to it you believe it i believe i believe but it still hasn't been made alive in you it has don't give up because that spirit is going to come and make it alive and i know people that have just struggled for a lot of time for a long period of time always in and out battling the world but you want to know some maybe 10 15 20 years later after a whole freeway load of car wrecks one day they just say you know something this this means more to me than ever if he's not going to give up on you you don't give up on yourself you know so this spirit is here to make it alive i believe that you'll enjoy uh we're 17 minutes and then we'll make a few comments and we'll go but i hope you're enjoying this so anyway we're going to start in paragraph 120 122. i believe yes okay so paragraph 122 of the easter seal through the end of paragraph 1 64 and then we'll just go back to read a few paragraphs comment but we we want to anchor into this message this word of god is the best weapon that god could have ever given you to fight the fight fall in love with it get involved with it let it speak to you so we'll cover of just a few things we'll talk about that all alzheimer says what stood out to me i'm sure there's things that will stand out to you so god bless you as we listen to uh the voice of malachi 4 5 echoing in our day so god richly bless you are we if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walk into the chicken's nest amen if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is sure to find you and when it finds it you'll recognize this call you know the hour you're living you know these things you're supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh what a promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things the spirit quickens their fellowship with god so that they call the dead back to life in that day they laid their bodies up on the dead they come to life listen closely they done the same things that jesus did because the same spirit was upon him was upon them if one spirit makes a man act this way it makes the other neck that way if one how can this come upon say he's got the spirit of god in the night of the works of god amen cannot do it notice god's life which is in the greek called zoe moving through them and in them quicken their minds to his word amen now let me say it real quietly the spirit of god that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of god see it does it look i'm trying to show you the the let you realize that i'm speaking out of the church and also quicken to life in him you although uh they only uh or was his attributes to begin with but if god said in this day back in the beginning john doe will be my servant millions of years ago now john goes born and sinned shaped in iniquity comes the world speaking lives because he's immortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll join pentecostal church don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of god once see john doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who the mother was it's got to realize it see only that john doe is god's attribute that's become a word spoken and then the holy spirit seeks that word out here it is he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of god god's word look god had the scene when he saw jesus it was it was a finished work that god finished with jesus when he said it's finished all the plan was finished and when the spirit of god comes upon you and you truly are one of god's attributes that he's spoken of now if you're not you'll wander and flusterate and run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth if you are one of those the old things pass away right quick see and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that god ever spoke of you see for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of pentecost now let us notice the quickness this quickening spirit on other people now i told you i wouldn't speak very long and i just got 20 minutes to keep my word if i do that notice to keep it one time i said about about an hour notice now this quickening power that only comes now there's a lot of mockery of it there's a lot of people that really think they got it when they haven't lot of people do it because they have got some false impression of what they've seen other christians do satan can impersonate any of that we know that in his missionaries you can see it impersonated shouting dancing speaking in tongues all these things you still impersonated anywhere absolutely amongst heathens and people who deny there is a such a thing as jesus christ being the son of god see and they do all those things themselves but the real true quickening spirit that comes to believer quickens him to god's word that's back to eagle food again right back to where he lives man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god let us now notice this quickly spirit as it come up on other people like it did on on the day of pentecost let's notice pentecost how they acted and see if they were quickened by this quickening power that we're talking about on the day of pentecost they were all waiting up there in themselves they were afraid the jews what they were going to do so they got scared but what happened when this quaking power fell from heaven there was a bravery set up on him there was something an understanding worthy wasn't too sure of it a few hours before they know he had he died they know he had risen they i talked to him on the way but was that thing for them or was it just for them for jesus himself but here on the day of pentecost the holy spirit the abstract fell upon the believers that made them part of his resurrection made him part of his fellowship the holy spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised in from cowards to brave man they were they were afraid of the very word that they thought don't let this pass over you they were afraid they know that he was that word even the jews had to admit it nicodemus said rabbi we know that you're a teacher that come from god no man who could do the things you do except god be with him now we know that we recognize that so the disciples peter had even sworn in his presence all of them had forsaken him at the crucifixion but here they are now up in this upper room in the presence of god then all of a sudden here come this holy spirit down from heaven and he quickened them and the quickening took place they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed and know to be the truth amen otherwise they were afraid of it amen how many presbyterians how many methodists how many baptists in the world today how many pentecostals that's a knows the truth and are afraid to make a standoff i'm persuaded to wonder what was that fell on you amen are you a part of his resurrection would you dare scream off for some man's therian idea or have you got the real boldness and the the real manhood it takes to stand out and call right right and wrong wrong are you a part of his resurrection are you a worshiper of a bunch of creeds are you a gourd at church do you have your name on there and dead and sin and trespasses he that believes not the full word of god is a sinner those pharisees believed in many things to be the truth they said we're god's children and they were until that word was preached but when that word was preached and vindicated then they become sinners for rejecting the thing that they know was right and witnessed that we know the heart of teacher come from god for no man can do the things that you do without god being with you i wonder today where are we at a question where is this resurrection finding us are you dare to step out are you dare to take god at his word that's it if you're ordained alive you sure will do it if you're an eagle you can't help doing it amen there's something in you or do you want to just serve a creed somewhere say i go to church i'm just as good as you are see if you hold no birthrights you will never see it you can't see it but if you do hold the possession of this birthright you can't help from seeing it because it's part of you and you're a part of it how could i my other mother give me birth how could i under the father that is whole blood is in me how could i deny charles brown from being my father i could not do it i'm willing to stand his reproach or anything else because i am his son amen hallelujah than being a son of god and he was the word of god how can i deny that bible being truth that jesus christ isn't to say yesterday today and forever and seeing the hour that we're living in we need our easter in the church resurrection we need a resurrection to the power of faith man and women to stand up for that which is god's vindicated word say well we have in our youth for christ that's all right our church is having a meeting we want so many members nothing against that that's all right but that's only the atmosphere that might be an old hens feathers but if you'll get in the right atmosphere there you'll hatch eagle if you're eagle egg and if you were for ordained of god to sin you gained help from seeing it you're coming forth in our resurrection praise god that's the way the baptist is born that's why the methodist is born in the resurrection that day but they turned off to a hen instead of an eagle i said not long ago going down from tucson i watched a very strange thing i've seen a hawk sitting on the wire down there that hawk has long lost his identification it used to be a bird next to the eagle he could not follow the eagle no but no means nothing can follow an eagle but he was a hawk christ is the eagle and the church should at least be a hawk they can fly higher than any other rest of birds but that hawk has become soft it's lost his identification it sits on the telephone wires and waits for some dead rabbit amen he hops like a vulture instead of flying like a hawk oh my brother sister you pentecostal people which is my own dear people the church is losing its identification it's coming down and depending on some dead formal creed instead of flying in the heavenly genre for fresh manna hawk used to hunt his own man but today he takes what the automobiles run over what the vultures eat he hops like when he looks like one we so adorned ourselves in the modern world are women cutting their hair and wearing shorts are a man with not enough backbone to stand the pulpit and tell the truth we've long got soft on the word oh god send the holy ghost to look out that eagle somewhere that's ready to stand out no matter what takes place that'll soar into the unknown not set on the telephone wires and look for some sunday school literature to come in let me have the word into the precious of the power and demonstration of the holy ghost amen we need an easter a resurrection that's potential my friend if you're satisfied with sense of caring of the world there's something wrong my sister my brother let me say to you some godly fear knowing that i may never live to sin easter again but there's one thing sure when a genuine foreign son of god by the word of god hears that voice of god he'll rise and go to me it's the potential that he's going to meet the real living word as he was the bride will meet the groom she's a part of his body notice long have we we're losing our identification we come on wednesday night some of us others stay home to watch who love susie televisions all kinds of worldly things all kinds of entertainments to keep you away from church long have we lost it our seminaries our schools are putting out a bunch of rickey's with a whole lot of theology and entertainment and everything in the church to take the place of the prayer meeting amen we've talked dressed and tried to fulfill what the modernists try to do it bring them in you will never win them but that they got more that you have you ain't got no business on your ground on their ground let them come over on yours where their real baptism is shining for the real power of the resurrection don't try to build a church like theirs don't try to have a pastor like that don't try to do this other or cooperate with the world amen they shine with hollywood the real gospel goes with power eagles hear that they don't look for a shine they look for a glow glowing with humility glowing with love glowing with power that's what the real eagle hunts you can't scratch in a barn yard and please him he'll never be able to do it you'll never touch him because he don't believe him let that voice scream from the heavens i am he that was dead and alive again amen something takes place i am the same yesterday today and forever and it shall come to pass in the last days i'll pour out of myself upon all this flesh glory to god i'll quicken your immortal language i'll quick in your mortal tongues i'll give you the evidence that i'm going to bring in the resurrection with me hungry hearted eagles reach for that just as hard as i can it's a pearl of great price that they sell everything else to go by amen god help us friend our churches are losing their identification that's quickly now how to go to some watch the action of those disciples are scared they know jesus was the truth but to see it was against the popular idea amen the popular religion of the hour the most strictest religion sarah pharisees sadducees and so forth their cults clans and denominations they were they were against that heresy but jesus was the identified word and jesus is the holy ghost in spirit a little while the world sees me no more you shall see me not the body the life that was in him god is upon the church to call sons like he did that obedient i always do that which is pleasing to my father which one of you can accuse me of sin in other words sin is unbelief what has the word said about me that i haven't done show me what the word said that i do what i didn't do which one can accuse me which one can lay your fingers on me and say that i haven't fulfilled my father's word oh when the pentecostal church gets to that spot amen who can accuse me of unbelief oh christians be identified not as a hawk but an eagle that hawk is soft it'll come down you never see an eagle doing that he'll never do that he hunts his own food out of the blue god's preparing him so he can see it he gets fresh manna not something that's dead in the hebrews when he crossed through the wilderness they eat try to eat dead manna it become stagnant it had it had wiggle tails in it you know what we mean it's contaminated rotten maggots is in it why would i eat a food that had been dead years ago it might be in form and shape but it isn't fresh we got to get food every generation knew so does the eagle look for that food every generation as we're in our journey notice do you think you got all that i didn't you know and i've i've heard this many times it just it it strikes me but i uh we're just gonna take take a few moments and and i i i you know pray that um you know we just have sunday and we have church i know you have your own bible studies and your own tapes that you're listening to but it would be good as a body for us all to get behind this easter seal and study it out and read it and and and grow with it and contribute uh you know like when you're in church you're you're not just uh you're not just feeding or listening for your own lives but your spirit is contributing to everybody else and when you pull you know you have a need and the spirit works on you and and there's a pull when you pull that spirit to your life you're pulling that spirit past other people's past other minds and and things so it's all a part you know and i i'm i'm for streaming that as far as of what's happened uh with this virus and and the world and of course but it's changed everybody's viewpoint on things and it's not a substitute for church and it's not a substitute to the responsibility that you have to the body you know and that's why god places us in different places different bodies different things is not for heart convenience it's for one another because each joint supplies the other fitted and joined together you know supplying the need and so as we look through this remember that that you've got a great part that you're also playing too so as we look at this let's go we just think here for a moment and he's talking about uh and he says this here in uh paragraph uh i don't know if we read that this but he said he said here he said the spirit quickens their fellowship with god so that they call the dead back to life in that day they laid their bodies upon the dead and they come to life listen close they've done the same things that jesus did because the same spirit was upon him was upon them okay that's why they did it because so when they got the quickening spirit they didn't get a third person of the trinity they didn't get another working they got the same spirit that was in jesus was on them he didn't change their personalities you understand didn't change if i could say when i say personality that's your nature the things that you like and dislike but it was the same spirit on them and and each person did as they were led to do the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord so we're not looking back at pentecost and saying oh they did this they did this they did that i had to go i have to go out and do this and do this and do this no all you have to do because you have he gives you that spirit you want it he gives you spirit now he orders your footsteps i i remember uh years ago and and when i was living in flagstaff and brother floyd patterson was the pastor at that time he was telling the story how he was just praying for god to really uh you know give him a great work to do and he wanted his ministry anointed and and he told the story and and so he got a phone call from an elderly couple that uh needed some help and he raised up you know he has felt anointed and powerful and been in prayer and fasting and he got over there and what they wanted was from him that he would help them zip up a zipper on a sleeping bag so they could roll it up and ship it to their son or or something and you want to know something doing that in the obedience of god would be greater than doing any other work outside the will of god that's right so we the and the point of this is there's got to be that personal relationship with that quickening power so if you understand it's a spirit it's his spirit the same spirit comes down and makes contact with your life and you accept that spirit in you to be now what leads you right so it leads you now that spirit's in you leading you so how how does that leadership work and i think that's a lot of questions people want to know how how am i led to the lord but it's laying right here in such a beautiful way he says he said it quickened the same spirit was upon them if one spirit makes a man act this way it makes the other one act that way how can this come upon how can this come upon say he's got the spirit of god and deny the works of adi can't do it now listen god's life which is in the greek zoe moving through them and in them quickened their minds to his word so now now you see it's not you looking out and seeing a event and then trying to go reproduce it that's where pentecost failed they they got the restoration and they went back and they tried to duplicate it they tried to duplicate it and it never worked he said it don't work you can't even win them on that ground but he said he quickens your mind the spirit of god quickens your mind it gives you an unction it speaks to you in your mind and then when you recognize it as being the spirit you recognize it as being what the word of god it drops from your mind into your heart and becomes the will of god but it's going to come to you where first it's going to come to you in your mind because a word is a what thought expressed so he's going to give it to your mind can you recognize it as being the word and then that word that's in your mind the thought becomes expressed and then it's the word of god expressed in you so that's how you're led it's not you studying the bible okay and no study the bible because that's where it'll come and quicken your mind but if the thought gets quicker than you the unction of the spirit quickens in your mind you see it's the word of god you believe it it drops into your heart and then it becomes the thought that was in you manifested that's why satan is always trying to put thoughts in your mind that you manifest them thoughts instead of god's thoughts but god gave you the best weapon that he could give you and that was the word of god where's the battleground the battlegrounds in your mind so the word of god is put in your mind the spirit comes and quickens that work in your mind quickens your mind you accept that word and then you bring that thought into expression and then you become the word and that's where the battle is you believe that then i like this he says it quickens it quickens their mind to his word now let me say this real quietly now i like that statement in other words take a deep breath listen let me say it real quietly now the spirit of god that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of god it does it look i'm trying to show you and let you realize that i'm speaking now of the church and also quickened to life in him what a statement you know it's it's it's that outside force quickening to your mind the word of god you recognizing that's the word some other thing comes in there it don't filter to the word then then you you don't do it you go back in the spirit it quickens the word how many thoughts do you have but the spirit has never been there to quicken it it's not his thought he don't quicken he only quickens his word so you have that's a process that we've got to become aware of if we're going to go on because we can't clone you understand what i'm saying it's an individual affair and many times in your life you have to lay down what you desire to do and what you want to do and be obedient to god's word regardless to my own personal testimony very on early in my life i was a lover of the ocean i love to fish i love yachts and boats and i i had a a a a job i was working on a boat and i came to the knowledge of this message and the revelation that i should leave california that same weekend i i heard the tape on the saturday and and you know the story of it and then i remember we finally had come along and made up our mind we were moving out of california and i did a phone call from tom beach and he says david i want you to come work on the yacht we got some things out we're going to take the president of mexico out and we're going to take josh cousteau and some of his people out this is like oh my god this is what i prayed for all my life this is what i wanted i always wanted that just think of it i just pictured myself with leathery skin you know what i mean not old wrinkle skin i mean dark leather skin you know just out and walking down the rail of the boat you know what i mean and oh i just you can't imagine i was in heaven and i remember standing in my front yard and i thought lord i'm gonna pour this out to you like david poured out his offering i was going to give up my heart's desire and you know what i did when i poured it out to him and then all of a sudden i rejoiced and i think i maybe even danced like david dance i was doing the irish jig right out in the front yard why because he gave me my heart's desire and that's what he did to david david desired a drink from that fountain lord let me have a drink from that fountain and here comes the opportunity here comes the desire of my heart everything that i ever wanted every vision i ever thought i'll walk in that elite and here i'm just going to jump in a bus with a bunch of hippies and drive to montana but you know something i was glad i poured out that water and i was glad he gave me the desire of my heart i was willing to make the sacrifice because i knew that i heard the voice then i wasn't going to follow and that's the thing where's that voice going to come to it's going to come to that mind and that's where that spirit works is right on the battleground quickening that word what's he do he quickens the mind to the word oh i wish that i had the vocabulary i wish i had the spirit to express that to you and here's the prophet of god preaching to these people and he knows the spirit is quickening their minds to the fulfillment of the promised word right so he knows that so as we look at this and and and we we we we read that so we we see that he comes back over here and he says he he quickens their minds let me say that real slow he says i'm speaking of the church quickened to life i'm speaking of the church being quickened to life this is how it happens right and then he talks about john doe and he talks about what he goes through and and so we we see that that great beautiful thing that he quickens to the mind and so after that he brings that forth he breaks into this little thing and and i think it's uh i i think it's noteworthy if if i could say this it says in paragraph 31 he says now there's a mockery of it and there's a lot of people that really think they got it when they haven't a lot of people do it because they have some false impression of what they've seen other christians do young people please i know you go to a lot of meetings and i know you've got a lot of places but don't ever rely on what other people are doing you wait till it's quickened to your mind that way it's your mind is the only thing that makes it personal you understand what i'm saying it's the only thing that makes it personal you can't look out and say this person's doing this this person's doing that everybody's doing this everybody's that i'll tell you something you can sit there just as still as a stone on the beach and if god's talking to your mind and you know it's him and he's telling you go make this right you go do that right you can do this you know you can overcome this and you know it's him and that touches your mind and drops into your heart you've had just as much experience with god as anybody now here's the prophet of god pointing out an heir a common heir in the church and that's the scriptures even says you become fools comparing yourselves one with another don't do it you be that individual christian you serve god because it's in your heart to serve god god's talking to your mind he's quickening the word to you you're following that word you're obedient to that word and that's your personal relationship he says what others do satan can impersonate any of that we know that as missionaries we've seen all these great uh things that that go on so we we've got to understand that he says and he says but you can see it impersonated anywhere absolutely amongst heathens who that deny that there's such a thing of jesus christ so we're not talking so there's got to be some way that the spirit of god works in you you understand that and that mind that you have that that spirit's quickening to the word of god is what makes it personal and let me tell you that's the hardest part of being a christian because you have your desires you have what you want to do you have what where where the you would like to do it you're creating your own leadership your own pathway and yet that voice is telling in you don't do it and and if we're not careful we learn to override that we get so beat down and the ministry sometimes is the biggest beater of the people but we get so beat down we don't even have confidence in god talking to our our thoughts i've watched it in my life i've watched it in my life how many times in my mind i know that it's god amen and i i i go to read other quotes i go find a different sermon you know go find some greener grass whatever no am i lost no did i take the permissive will sure but the permissive will always leads back to the perfect will and it's presented there again you couldn't draw a more perfect picture have confidence so let's read this just we're just going through here he said and this is paragraph 34. he says let's notice pentecost how they acted and see if they were quickened by the quickening power that we're talking about now he's that he's going to come up with a completely different evidence here and if you just bear with me for a moment this morning if they are quickened by this quickening power talked about on the day of pentecost they were all waiting up there in themselves they were afraid so you know we have all the evidence of oh they did this and they went and did this and they went and said that no the first evidence of the quickening power was that it took away the fear number one that was the evidence of pentecost look and see if they had the quickening power that we're talking about looking out there in themselves they were afraid now they were still afraid and they had revelation i mean look at how beautiful am i okay okay he said and they were afraid the jews just what they were going to do so they got scared but what happened when this quickening power fell from heaven there was a bravery set upon them oh there's a little different teaching on the baptism of the holy ghost not my teaching you understand there's a little something different that brother branham is telling him all sitting there looking at him and afraid to recognize that let me tell you something all these people that you see on the internet everybody out there all the television evangelists and everybody is talking about brother random now oh he had the resident gift he prophesied these events they failed to recognize what brother branham's ministry was it was a fulfillment of a promised scriptural prophecy and that's what they don't recognize they don't recognize his ministry fulfilled revelations 10 7. his ministry fulfilled luke 17 30. his ministry was the ministry of malachi 4 5. talk about his works oh yeah talk about this when it comes down this message is not about the works of brother branham it's about the fulfillment of god's promised word to this age that god would come down in this age and veil himself in human flesh reinpersoning the same works that he did amen and and that's it exactly uh what he said that's why he said here he said look god had the same when it's paragraph 127 when he saw jesus it was the finished work that god finished with jesus when he said it's finished all the plan is finished why was it all finished in jesus because he was going to send the quickening spirit the first adam was a what the second adam was a quickening spirit that's jesus christ living in you that's jesus christ the same yesterday together that's the one we serve that's the one we worship the one that's quickening the word to your mind you might as well try stop serving william branham in history everything brother branham said is alive today a hundred percent vindicated by god it's just coming off tape in the flesh that spirit's here quickening it's personal i don't care you say i ain't felt no quickening you know what you do pray for quickening pray for what revelation pray for revelation god give me a revelation but look at this evidence because i want you to take this back to yourself listen listen just real closely he said at bravery said upon there was something before they knowed he had died they knowed he had risen they talked to him on the way but there was that thing for them or it was just for them or for jesus himself how many ever go through that is it for me or just so we don't want to walk with it as the truth please let me get through this and and then we'll have a short evening service but there on the day of pentecost the holy spirit the abstract fell upon the believers that made them a part of his resurrection made him part of his fellowship the holy spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised up from cowards to brave men they were they were afraid of the very word that they had thought see that quickening of that mind they were afraid of the very word that they thought how many of us get thoughts maybe to do a good work maybe to pray for somebody and we were afraid of our very thought can you imagine overcoming that let me tell you the quickening spirit is here to overcome that the spirit's here he's going to work with your mind he's going to build that bravery into those thoughts that you carry out them thoughts anyway he said that he said they were afraid of the very word that they had thought don't let this pass over you can i say that this morning don't let this pass over you what's the attribute of faith love what's the attribute of doubt fear there's two spirits that rule the church you understand i i've got to preach what the prophet says i can't preach with you desire to hear if he brings you under conviction i'm not bringing you under conviction i don't know it there's some things i see there's some things i know but i'll tell you how you can tell whether it's the holy spirit or not when you see something is how it makes you feel to that person it's the attitude you take for them and if you love them you'll never quit loving them you'll never stop being their friend you'll never stop being you know their brother or that's just the way it is as i said they they are afraid of the very word that they thought they know that he was the word even the jews had admitted it nicodemus rabbi we know you're one of the masters he says here but now there in the upper room paragraph 40 in the presence of god they all of a sudden here come the spirit down from heaven and it quickened them and it the quickening took place they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed and knowed to be true now what was the evidence that the fear wasn't there that they weren't afraid to make a witness now if god's looking down upon us as believers and paul the very first thing he says to the romans i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it's the power of god the salvation then the messenger even talking to these full gospel businessmen he's telling them you're afraid you're afraid that this ministry that's the revealed word of god you're afraid to stand for it you're afraid to testify of it you're afraid but let me tell you he says what the evidence was that they got the holy spirit wasn't that they spoke in tongues it wasn't they had a youth council was it that they had this what the evidence was is that they weren't afraid to witness to the message i think we really ought to ask ourselves how many people have we sat down across the table and really explained business associates people have we won to the lord well you don't win anybody to the lord he wins them you're just a carrier of the good news to them how many people have we not failed to talk how many times that he spoke to our mind and we felt that unction but that fear stops us because we're talking about a church that we want to see the power of god the works followed the dismissal of the fear when the fear left the works came they already had the revelation they knew he raised from the dead they knew he was the word they knew all those things you understand that but the fear still kept them in bondage and it wasn't until that spirit quickened in them in their mind can quickened it to them that they weren't afraid and after they weren't afraid that's when the signs followed if not you're just going to get church meeting signs signs amongst believers we don't need signs amongst believers we need signs to the unbeliever maybe i've gone crazy that's a lovely song thank you for that then all of a sudden here come the holy spirit down heaven and quicken them and that quickening took place they wasn't afraid to make witness of the message that they believed and knowed to be true they weren't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed and knew was true they already believed it and they already made that was true the difference now god is measuring this age by the quickening power for this age so if he's looking out and it does the same thing on every believer if we got what they got in the beginning then they weren't ashamed of the promised word that came to pass if we got that same spirit then we're not afraid of the promised word that's come to pass in our day we're not ashamed of it but you want to notice what is the whole world doing now it's making us more difficult not to be ashamed we can't preach against homosexuality we can't preach against this we can't preach against that they're trying to bring all kinds of things that have nothing to do with christianity christianity don't hate their brother they're not involved in political warfare they don't weaponize the creation of god did you hear me say that they don't weaponize the creation of god god made you the way he made you because he loves you the way you are he or his he speaks to your mind it's a personal affair god does not deal with groups so anytime you see a great big group movement you might as well put your finger on it it ain't god it's you it's you and him it's personal it's individual there's a whole quickening storehouse here just for you sister just for you to feed on just for you to eat just for him to talk to you you've got your leadership right here lord quicken my mind he's the conductor he fits the body i want to be wherever he wants to place me in the body i wished it was california i wished it was but i had to take my journey to get to where god wanted me don't you want to be where he wants you where you can contribute where you can be a part of what he's doing you know praise god no that's personal if you ask me about something all i can tell you is you if they have a church do they have a pastor then my answer as long as you've got a church as long as you be in service but i don't give the answer he gives the answer and let me tell you if you're a christian you're going to come across a lot of instances in life where you don't like his answer but you're always better when you take it all right let's close up this morning i don't even know what time i got i got carried away i am carried away i'm out of my mind i just wanted to touch on this this we talked on that thing i want to just make that thing so clear about this you know that and he makes a comment he's and see if i can find that remark and i guess i don't have it marked but he talked about the hand feathers do you remember where that was where he just talked about he said you could watch the what 147 so let's read 143 we'll read 147 and then we'll just uh wait for another day he said i put down here in my note on one uh uh uh 43 he says this i i i mark this down i call it the challenge you know he says i wonder today where we're at i ask you where is this resurrecting resurrection finding us are you dare to step out are you dare to take god at his word if you're ordained to life you sure will do it if you're an eagle you can't help doing it there is something in you or do you want just to serve a creed somewhere or say i go to church you see the difference between doing the will of god and going to church think about that a little bit or do i just want to say i've covered it i'm going to church as long as i'm going to church i've got it covered i can do anything i want to do don't you want to grow [Music] i can do anything i wanted as long as i was go to church hallelujah have we all got to the place that we just go to church i'm in how do you know i am i go to church that's that's just that that's just something a christian wants to do it ain't a fulfillment so what's he supposed to quicken our minds so we have to bring up these things so he says or do we just go or do we just say i i just want to say i go to church he said i i go to church i'm just as good as you are see if you hold no birthright you'll never see it you can't see it but if you do hold the possession of the birthright you can't help from seeing it because it's a part of you and you're a part of it now i'm not talking about the message and he's not talking about the message what he's saying that you can't miss is the quickening of god's word to your mind if you're a part of it you see exactly what god's saying to you you can't help but see it now it's up to you how you act on it that's right are we lost no i just don't want to live in the permissive will of god all my life and if you say well how much of your life have you lived in the permissive will brother david probably 85 percent of it maybe i'm given too much credit to myself but we've got to recognize the hour and start taking it serious and then this is what he says down in paragraph corey says well you say we have our youth for christ so you see how these things are falling together that's all right our church is having a meeting we want so many members nothing against that but that's only the atmosphere that might be old hens feathers but if you'll get in the right atmosphere it'll hatch out eagle if you're an eagle egg if you're ordained of god to see it you can't help from seeing it you're coming forth in a resurrection that's the way the baptist was born do you understand that's how they were born they got in the atmosphere the right atmosphere luther came out with the word the word was quick into their mind and they said i got to get away from this lighting candles to saints i've got to get away from this confessing of sins i've got to get away from that it was quickened because they got in the atmosphere of what luther was preaching in justification he says that's how the baptists were born okay you know that's how the methodist was born in resurrection of that day so there's a resurrection of this day the quickening of this day but they turned off to a hand instead of an eagle now and i'll close with this this morning we listen to tapes but there's an atmosphere that goes with the tapes the prophet of god said the anointing is on the tapes you can hatch a a chicken under a puppy okay so you can you can uh listen to the word you can listen to music well there's a on i wish i could just express this to you there is an atmosphere that goes with each tape so i don't want to sit outside of the atmosphere and be listening to the tape in the atmosphere that i'm in now many a times i would be on the front of my boat fishing and playing a tape because i love to hear the voice i love it i wasn't in the atmosphere of the tape to me the message in the bible are equal amen you know what i'm saying because the i read the bible but i only had my own thought until the spirit came and quickened the word my mind and then i saw what the bible was saying the letter killeth but the spirit gives life amen and so i i i'm fishing and and i'm listening and everything but when i got a hook you know what i mean you know what i mean now i'm in the atmosphere of that fish you know it's a big one that has a dink you know throw it back in the water okay and i'm saying that you can listen to tapes at work that's good i'm not talking about that that's good it's better than listening to elvis presley but there's a different experience when you sit down and you come into the atmosphere of that tape the atmosphere lord quicken something from me i so i'm not listening to what i already know i'm i'm not being re-vindicated i'm not looking for more fortification for the thoughts that i already have i'm not looking for sermon material i'm coming into an atmosphere because i'm looking for something to hatch something being quickened in me more something that is being enkindled by by the atmosphere and and let me just express that thought in the reading of these next few statements and he he talked about the identity about the church so let's just read this and i'll close i should be out by one o'clock and you'll all be hungry so you'll really enjoy your lunch christ is an eagle remember he just talked about that lost his identity and the church should at least be a hawk they could fly higher than any other rest of the birds but that hawk has become soft it's lost its identification now let's see what the identification is he sets on the telephone wire and waits for some dead rabbit he hops like a vulture instead of flying like a hawk oh my brother sister you pentecostal people which is my own dear people the church is losing its identification it's coming down and depending on some dead formal creed instead of flying in the heavenlies yonder for fresh manna where's that fresh manna it's in that atmosphere that's what atmosphere is the heavenly it doesn't go into the heavenlies to get fresh manna not my manna not the message manna fresh manna from your quickener to your mind to a manifestation in your life he says he said a hawk used to hunt his own manna but today he takes what an automobile run over or what the vultures eat he hops like one he looks like one we so ardenned ourselves to the modern world our women cut their hair and wear shorts our men with not enough backbone to stand in the pulpit and tell the truth we're we've long got soft on the word god send the holy ghost the what the quickening power and look out them eagles somewhere that's ready to stand yonder no matter what takes place they'll soar into the unknown not set on a telephone wire and look for some sunday school literature to come in if you're not soaring this morning is sunday school literature we run to the internet for this we run to the internet for that instead of taking a tape sitting down and getting into the atmosphere it'll do wonders for us not as a body as individuals then as individuals you'll spread the fire it'll it'll just it'll just it'll move not some sunday school let me have the word in its freshness of power and demonstration the holy ghost we need easter a resurrection that's potential my friends if you're satisfied with such caring of the world there's something wrong my brother sister let me say to you this in godly fear knowing that i may never live to see another easter you know that was true he said i'm saying this to you about being afraid about what the real evidence is about getting in the atmosphere i'm saying to you this in godly fear knowing i will never see another easter how heavy should this set yes but there's one thing sure when a genuine foreign son of god by the word of god hears that voice of god he'll rise and go meet it it's the potential that he's going to meet the real living word as he was the bride will meet the bridegroom she's a part of that body to what is this message to us when we rise to meet it it's the evidence the potential to us that we're going to meet the real word himself amen oh you're part of a resurrection church that's why the gospel is pressing into us more about how we think more where our stand is more lord i i need so much cleansing lord please come and and fill me with quickening power the quickening powers got me this far but i know in order to go further i'm gonna have to be quickened quickened and quickened and quickened and quickened let the quickening power quicken the word to you this is not preached with condemnation this morning it's preached with understanding so we can see what this world is what their thought pattern is first of all they're creating an atmosphere for us to be afraid in secondly they're trying to get us to where we can't think like a christian walking on pins and needles no beef be afraid be brave don't accept that fear be strong in the lord amen he'll keep you and he'll guide you and when the fear was gone was when they showed up on the street and may lord god let that set in our heart this morning as that we just wanted to spend that little time of fellowship in in those words and it's right there you know i mean you can't make these things up you know what i mean i mean this is a seer looking at the church because he said that i'm trying to tell the church this is the church the quickening of the mind and he knew that if we weren't careful we were going to get to the place where this message just becomes sunday school to us the preachers getting up preaching out of the message preaching out of the message preaching out of the message and i can understand why people that only listen to tapes can feel the way they feel but i want to say you can only listen to tapes and not get in the atmosphere so we've got to strike that balance you know what i mean and i i want to preach the gospel to you i want to do it without fear or favor i want to just point you to the things that are here and i just believe these messages are very critical yes sir because the next message is that all these messages that brother branham starts preaching in 65 and every part of the message is equal but he's putting things out here that are just amazing and i want i sav don't you so lord bless you this morning we trust that the spirit of the lord will guide you and keep you sorry we're long we'll we won't have a longer service but i hope that stimulated you this morning maybe you saw things you didn't see before and the idea is not for you to see things you didn't see before the idea is for you to look back and say i never saw that or i i'm reading it now but and i'm trying to say if we would spend a little more time getting in the atmosphere more of those things would stand up to us individually and we wouldn't have to rely on a sunday school lesson i know it's a paradox but our desire is that this quickening power becomes real to each one of us god bless you let us stand this morning we've been uh keeping sister uh karen pruitt in our prayers uh looking for god to really do something for her she's been a a lovely servant of the lord and it it you know i just just feel she's got the faith and and i just like my prayers to help push and so we can have a prayer meeting this tuesday and we'll be praying for her then and so we just trust that you would definitely keep her in prayer and um and just ask the lord let's it seek the mind of the lord let's let us bow our heads if you have a need this morning maybe maybe that little bit of fear has been in your heart maybe you've just been satisfied with going to church or maybe that you've lost your identity as an eagle to fly into the heavenlies that you just you don't want to go and get revelation on your own you don't want god to speak to your heart because maybe nobody else will hear what you heard and you've got to stand there and let what was quickened in your mind manifest in your flesh and it's easier just to walk in what everybody else is talking about what everybody else was thinking about but you lose your identity as a person that god created to fly into the atmosphere and get fresh manna for yourself and that's my desire this morning lord for the people is that they understand that this is their heritage that this is something that's given that they can do they could be eight years old they could be 10 years old 15 years old but if they're eagles they can flop out of that yard and soar [Music] and lord i ask that you make this real to the people lord i ask that you make it real to me father that i can get that spirit outside the gift and just have it in my life lord lord you know all the struggles each of us have but you promised you'd never leave us nor forsake us and this quickening gift you said it brought us back into fellowship with you and lord i just don't want to be a believer i don't want to sit in the upper room believing you're the word believing you have a message believing everything that's written on the and spoken on the tapes and just not have any life i believe there's something higher that you're calling us do and lord i pray that you just let that set and if there's anyone they just like to lift their hand to you this morning and say lord i need a more serious and more dedicated understanding of the hour i'm living in lord i want eyes at that i can see really what's going on in the spirit open to me my own life father speak to my mind quicken my mind to your word lord i just asked that you would do that father people my hands are raised father i'm sure there are others in lord we want to be real we really want to be your real church really led by the spirit of god i'll just ask you for it this morning lord if i could produce it i would lord even laying on of hands it's just our outward expression believing that you'll come down and quicken father i ask that those that are sick that you would quicken to their minds their healing and lord though they don't feel it they know it's there and they know they're walking to it and they know they're going to possess it because you spoke it to them father and we bring sister karen before you we thank you lord what you've done for our brother mike parks brought him from such a dark place lord now our sister is in need of that same healing touch that same resurrection father and i pray that you restore her father better testimony might bring others to you all we can do this morning is ask lord and i ask with all my heart our church as a church body asked with all our heart that you would touch our friend and our sister with the price of calvary [Music] the needs that we have here this morning lord i need deliverance for many things father there's others may they know that there's a spirit that can quicken our deliverance and we ask for that spirit we ask these things this morning in jesus name we pray amen amen let's sing just as brother billy comes pour your spirit out on me all just like
