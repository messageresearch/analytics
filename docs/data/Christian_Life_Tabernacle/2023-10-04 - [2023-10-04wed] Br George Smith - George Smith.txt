Description:
65-0217: A Man Running From The Presence of the Lord
Tape - Br. William Branham
Christian Life Tabernacle
October 4, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

service hey that those neighbors you haven't told about the message and those co-workers and those people you play ball with invite them to church this is what this this is an opportunity to help facilitate a tool that you could say you know what it's on a Saturday they don't uh likely have service Saturday night and maybe go out of your way try to ask your neighbor ask somebody who come and contact with that that's that's the purpose of this Outreach service is for you to to have an opportunity to invite somebody to come so we just don't want this to be some uh you know just another something that you feel you're obligated to come to let's have an expectation and maybe it's a family member a loved one a neighbor a friend at school just may maybe pray about it and reach out to them and we we have a little flyer that you can that you can give to them and invite them and then we'll just um uh have some refreshments to follow just to have a little Fellowship so I'm I'm anxious to see what God has in store I I have uh uh no idea how the service is going to go or what how the Lord is dealing with the man of God's heart but I'm in great expectation for souls to be saved for uh people to be born again and I'm just in great expectation for that so will you do that will you join together in prayer will you invite somebody how many you make an effort to invite somebody how many will make an effort to invite somebody praise the Lord let's do that and then also we do have something um Saturday as well for the Youth will'll be meeting at the Boys Ranch in between 11: and 3: so we have that little uh uh youth announcements if you're going to make it um please uh give a thumbs up that lets us know you're coming and if there's more than one of you give another thumbs up for the number of people that are coming and that also I want that to be also an opportunity feel free to invite a friend or somebody um that you a cooworker or somebody you go to school with and you just want to get them around the Believers uh when you shine your light it makes a great difference uh it's just not in these four walls but it's your life that's lived get somebody around other believers And when they see the hope that is within you and they see uh the children of God coming together and and enjoying one another's company and fellowship you never know how big of an impact that'll make to somebody so we just encourage you to uh invite somebody for the Youth to invite a friend to that afternoon lunch and we'll we have a little volleyball and some things set up and some food and then

and we on we go away oh and sing with me great all will see how great How Great Is Our God amen amen you know what my name is Brother David said I didn't need an introduction but for those of you that I don't know my name is George Smith I come from Tennessee you may be seated it's a privilege to be with you again I was here last year and I've been in many places we're not going to go through the travel log but um I was in Australia a couple weeks ago and um glad to be here tonight and we trust that everybody can understand either English or the translation and um I would like to um say that a long time ago in 1964 brother brandom said that if things go on the way they are right now now whatever he was focusing I don't know but the confusion there was back then he said if things go on the way they are right now in 50 Years it'll be total idolatry Total Insanity now some of you didn't live that long but I have and from 2014 till now it's been Total Insanity everything is upside down it's not going back to normal no I didn't bring the level but you can imagine you see the cross down here see the cross up there well it's level okay and the the way to keep things level is the long part of the Cross is your prayer life if you put forth the effort and speak to the Creator he will help the other part to stay level so with this Total Insanity that we've got going on uh it breeds confusion now all of us you know we live in this 21st century and we see the confusion we try to make sense out of it it's impossible it's confusion so when you see a confusing issue you go the other way because you cannot fix it you're not smart enough you're not a prophet you cannot fix it so stay off the internet and don't think that you're going to help those people they're going to the hot place and they're not coming back so get your s ready for the Rapture that's simple and God is not the author of confusion that's the other power there's only two things there's God and there's Satan and you have a choice to make you see that's why you come to church and um so we're all about balance yes things have to be balanced these nice cars will get out here if one tire is not balanced you get a lousy ride if one valve isn't right all of it's got to be Bal balanced and so we've got four steps to to achieve balance and you've probably heard them before but you're going to hear it again because if I only come once a year then you probably forgot you have your Bible okay this is God in printed form you never put anything on top of your Bible no Prophet said that so you read at least one chapter out of your Bible every day start starting tonight one chapter you read one page out of your church age book and I don't want to hear no excuses we got some extra we can sell you and you listen to a minimum of 20 minutes of the Prophet preaching and I don't want to hear no excuses you got lousy traffic here you're stuck don't start screaming at the other drivers CU you're all in the same line listen to The Prophet or you can also pray so those are the four steps you read your Bible read Church age book you listen to the prophet and you pray now you do that every day because see you've got 16 hours in the day free right you're supposed to sleep eight hours so those 16 hours you can carve out a little piece to um do these things and you will have a more Balanced Life God will bless you God will bless the church and you'll have a better attitude okay now we're all aware of a lot of things going on in Israel this is God's program you don't have to take sides you don't have to act ugly or feel bad at anybody just watch it happen it's going to be very interesting it's going to be very long it's going to be very hot we had a trip planned for uh December but we cancel it because you can't take people into a war zone and so we know people over there we've talked to them they're fine right now but um we just hope that our leader that's over there now doesn't say too much because every time we try to tell Israel how to run their business we have a natural disaster because God's watching and so um he will take care of them there's going to be people die but this is war it's going to happen Okay the other announcement that I must bring to your attention uh my brother-in-law Billy Paul has been very very sick for many months he's been suffering with pancreatic cancer now his desire was that nobody know and just kind of slip away well it's not going to happen you know it's Billy Paul so he's now in the final stages he's in Hospice his wife has turned him loose Lord thy will be done so there's a lot of stuff on the internet but the truth is he's still alive but he won't last long so pray for his wife L pray for the family uh we don't know the mind of God we can only take one step at a time headed to the resurrection and stay balanced you can't I can't emphasize how important that is so tonight we're going to open our Bibles into the book of Acts and I know some of you oh we're going to study acts yeah we're going to study it again I ran into a real good preacher the other day he said I've never I've never studied the book of Acts you you can stay seated we're going to go through it slowly yeah stay seated we're not going to read the whole chapter but we're going to start with Acts chapter 10 and um uh this is the foundation this is this is where it all started this is our our church you know and in chapter nine we have where that Peter had been um over there and raised the dead her name was Tabitha also Dorcas same name and then it says that he stayed a few days with a man called Simon the Tanner this man tanned hides they used to do it right here in Fort Worth many years ago maybe they still do tan hides they use them that was his job and so while he's resting a few days meanwhile 40 Mi North in cesaria uh up the coast there was a gentile man a Believer man called Cornelius now Cornelius was in charge of the Italian regiment could could have been as many as 600 soldiers he was an important man and uh he had a vision from the Lord about 3:00 p.m. and his name was called from the other dimension now that if that's never happened to you well it might happen today or tomorrow but if your name is called from the other dimension you tend to pay attention it's happened to me so chapter 10 and verse three it says here he saw a vision evidently about the 9th hour which is 3 p.m. and uh an angel of God coming into him saying unto him Cornelius there's his name called okay so it's pretty uh important and he looked on him he was afraid and he said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thy alms are come up before Memorial before God and now you need to send three men that'll say it a little later you need to send these men to japa which is down south and call for one his name is Simon his last name is Peter and he gives him the address he's with Simon the Tanner his house is by the Sea why would why do you need him he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do he had to have a preacher to expound to him the word of the Lord okay so now we know what side I'm on good so verse S he sends three trusted men down to japa just as the angel told him they took off they traveled through the night and they arrived about noon the next day okay now where's Peter he's up on top of the flat roofed house because it's cooler up there there's a breeze and he's up there meditating and um uh it was quiet and so downstairs they're fixing lunch so in verse 10 you know he's getting hungry while they're preparing lunch he's taken into a vision a supernatural experience because a Seer a prophet lives in two Dimensions okay now these things are important and they're in the message they're in scripture we're not making anything up so a Seer and a prophet same thing they live in this Dimension and they live in the other dimension but they're right here see if brother Brandon was here he could truthfully say that he sees 500 people here when there's only 161 maybe whatever so they they see more people they see angels and so forth and so he's in this having this experience and uh it's very natural for a prophet to enter into this Dimension and uh it's like when there's a when there's a construction zone you know they put up a plastic fence or something and to keep the nosy people out but a prophet can look over the fence and he sees what's going on now the challenge is how much of this do I tell them and what words do I use that's his Challenge and so it's his vision is for him and he will decide how and when he interprets it to the people you see so verse 11 and 12 gives us the the the vision that he saw just imagine a king-size sheet tied at the Four Corners it's coming down it's got all these animals in it okay all kinds of animals and um the fact is that God gave the Jewish people very strict dietary laws that's too bad he didn't give it to the to the Gentiles CU we might you know have be a little healthier but he gave these dietary laws to the Jews and um it was things they could eat things they should not eat and here's God showing an assemble with all these mixed animals he's showing something to his um uh Prophet the man with the Keys of the Kingdom and only he knew the interpretation if it was left up to us we'd have a 100 different interpretations but the interpretation was the Gospel is for everyone you know no more of this separating things and um it's not just for the Jewish people because see the the early church was mostly Jewish people Jesus told them only go to the house of Israel only only to our people and now here the things are changing okay and so um these laws were so ingrained in the people from from a child on up you do this you don't do that that this just the way they live it's a way of life there's still people today they have certain pots they can cook this in and other pots for this they have like two kitchens almost and so uh when we're over there you don't have the the product of the animal and the animal itself in other words if you're going to have if you're going to have brisket there's no butter for the corn there's no milk for the coffee you can't have the two together it's just one of their laws and so this is so ingrained in them that Peter what's he do you know he he he was converted he had he had the keys and he was full of the Holy Ghost he still had that mouth problem I'm sure nobody here has that same problem but you know he had it so in verse 13 the angel says to him r why Peter kill and eat and he says no no no I have never done such a thing no there's the common and the unclean and so forth and the voice spake to him a second time get a second chance Peter what God has cleansed don't you dare call it common God is in control not you and this was done three times okay so the voice speaks to him you know Peter pay attention this is not a debate this is serious three times and then division opened and closed and disappeared and Peter got the message okay so he's still arranging these new ideas it's this new order in his mind and these visitors show up at the gate downstairs they're knocking on the gate so then the Lord speaks to him he says now look you need to get yourself together get your hat on or whatever and go down because I sent three men to look for you and and they're looking for you so get down there okay so he goes down he opens the gate I I'm the one you're looking for how can I help you it's right there in your Bible and so they explained how God spoke to their commander and he was warned of God so he invited him in and um they uh they came in they spent the night the next day they started walking 40 miles probably nobody here walked 40 miles but you know some people do some people run well I don't run you know me and David we like a leather chair and so so they start walking and uh they um they got to uh they got to cesaria the next day and Cornelius was there waiting for him yeah and he called all his relatives in his close friends I mean he believed the vision you know stand for this guy he's going to tell you what you need to do so he calls all his friends in his relatives and when Peter came through the door this Fearless commander of you know all these soldiers he goes down on his knees wow this is really happening yeah and uh he falls down on his knees to worship this man of God the very person that the angel told him about you probably would too I mean a vision it's coming to pass well but see the thing is genuine Servants of God do not accept any kind of worship a birthday card is one thing we don't worship you know and so um of any kind so here's the man of God the spokesman for the Lord the man of the keys he had been used of God for many miracles that's true even raising the Tabitha a few days before and um even though Peter had made some mistakes argued with Jesus argued with the angel he was learning balance okay that's what he was learning it was hard but he was learning and he was teaching others this is the early church they had no New Testament their Bible was the Old Testament and at that time it was a 200y old translation and that's what they quoted and so the early church Peter Paul the rest of them they had a similar Ministry such as William brandom in the sense that they came and they said look all this that you guys memorize back here it's coming to pass this day these scriptures are being fulfilled now it was hard to turn the corner they've been used to this they've been used to you know the same same same but it's time to turn the corner and so that's where we're at tonight we're turning the corner we're headed towards the Rapture you have an opportunity to get ready the ones that decide to stay home watch TV they lost out but you're here so may God bless you so when he got inside there's all these people and the first thing he said was over here in verse 28 he said um you know that it's unlawful for me being a Jew to keep company with you of another nation that was the they had strict segregation the Americans you know we've decided in this day and age yeah we're going to just have seg you know integration well it's not worked out all that great especially in the world and the Believers it's different but over there they had this strict segregation and uh you couldn't even no those those are Heathen we're the people of God okay and um so from the vision before you know he had already had the the interpretation you know it's illegal for me to be here we have segregation but God has showed me a better way so he was expanding his comfort zone you see and you see God God gives the vision or the experience to the prophet and only the prophet can also provide the interpretation now I've been in this over 50 years and I know a lot of people that have spent their life they've wasted their life they've wore out the pencil sharpener they wasted their children figuring out prophet's Vision forget it it's the prophet's Vision God will give us what we need at the hour that we need it not a minute before you see so there's the sheet full of animals and God has shown me a better way nobody would ever figure it out it's his vision see so the prophet is the anointed vessel we're simply the repeaters you know declaring the manifestation of the prophet's prophecy brother B said it's coming to pass you see so same thing with Israel today all that's been prophesied God is in charge he doesn't need our opinions the sign says Be Still I'm God I got to figure it out don't need your opinions okay so um he doesn't acquire require opinions we can only be yielded flexible available and through human beings he will accomplish his perfect will and manifest himself to a dying generation we don't have to wear a sign no just be a Christian Billy Graham said when the Gospel of Jesus Christ is presented with authority quoting from the very word of God he then takes that message and drives it supernaturally into the human heart see that's where the the pastor gets a lot of his headaches he studies he sacrifices he preaches and people still dress the same they still do the same because they don't come to church correctly you come in here yielded yes Lord whatever you have to say I'm ready but we come in here with ideas you know it's got to be this way right no God will drive it into the heart we can only speak it you see okay so once he cleared the air you know Jews meeting Gentiles verse 29 why did you send for me H great question verse 30 and Cornelius said now four days ago you know I had this vision and so forth he relates to the whole deal and uh so they were totally ready for whatever he had to say they were prepared whatever they'd never heard of this this is a new message but an angel appeared you know and um so he uh he says we're ready no Prejudice no preconceived ideas whatever God has we want it so Peter preaches to a humble home meeting to Gentiles for the first time up to then only Jews okay so in 10 verses he gives the entire gospel message simple to the point look at verse 40 for example so he's talking about Jesus Christ all through here excuse me and God him God raised up from the on the third day and showed him openly now see nobody had ever heard of a res Resurrection before this this the first they hear about it now the Jews that were you know in the synagogue and had it all figured out and it's got to be this and this and this they were against this organized religion was against the message of the day but he says and showed him openly not to all the people thank you but unto Witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead very interesting so you see God controls all the details 42 and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead to him give all the prophets witness that's why brother Brandon could say all through the Old Testament is Jesus Christ if you didn't see it go back and read it again so he's saying the same thing all the prophets give witness that through his name that's the key right there through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins okay so that is a very important uh point there through his name and um hopefully we'll have a study on that later but you see we have people today carrying the King James Bible carrying the tablet carrying the the spoken word books they're in pulpits tonight in certain places of this country and other places proving to the people that Jesus wasn't God oh they they got it figured out they're taking the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ and putting it over here in this teaching and that whatever doomed for failure it's happening okay but it's very important and so you see and um manifested in speaking different tongues magnified God even before they were baptized all the legalists had a problem because you're supposed to believe and they baptized then the Holy Ghost God can do anything am you know when I when I listen to the news I'm surprised that the sun comes up the next day cuz this whole thing could blow up in the next 30 minutes it's that close so God can do anything you see and verse 47 is where that um uh let's see here Peter says now can any man forbid water that the should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we so he's remembering just a few days you know who knows I'm you know we don't know the time frame but it's it's shortly after the day of Pentecost and yeah that that happened to us here it is again Now can anyone forbid baptism and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed them they could stay there a few days okay so as you read through the book of Acts because you're going to do it right right yeah so you're going to read through the book of Acts you're not going to find any place that they repeated the red letter uh uh words of Jesus of Matthew 28:19 but they took the revelation of it in the name of see and that's why it's always in the name of the Lord like it says here okay so uh he uh he's with these people and um we uh we're going to go into chapter 11 because you know we got to wait till the traffic dies down before we can go home anyway we might as well be here stuck in traffic right so in chapter 11 and the apostles and Brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of of God okay they didn't have cell phones they didn't have Telegraph they had nothing but somehow the news got there before Peter got there they heard what happened at cornelius's house and they should have been rejoicing to see the further fulfillment of Acts 1 and8 you shall be my Witnesses here in Jerusalem or judia Samaria and all the way to Bedford Texas that's right the gospel didn't come in a parachute somebody came over here on a horse brought the gospel and we're rejoicing you know we got air conditioning we got nice seats and don't anybody think about going to sleep cuz I will get upset okay so um but see they were humans just like us they had religious segregation they had religious ideas even though they knew Jesus Christ and so forth you see the church is like a hospital nobody checks your credit card at the door nobody says if you got the right papers it's a hospital everybody's welcome visitors whoever and the gospel the word coming from the pulpit will make you comfortable to stay and get straightened out or chase you away we don't do that you know physically so um all are welcome and um so you see John 3:16 is still part of the word of God it's not just Billy Graham's message nobody is getting out of here without being born again receiving the Holy Ghost otherwise you'll stay for the tribulation okay it's just that simple because it says for God so loved the world now up to there it's the Pope's favorite scripture oh God so loved the world oh bring them all in doesn't matter what they look like what they're doing no no that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes oh they got to do something yeah believe on him should not perish but have everlasting life God loved us sinful creatures so much it's no small thing for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world you know the club beat down everybody no but that the world through him might be saved it's God's provided way he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already why because he has not believed what that God sent a prophet it doesn't say that has not believed the name of the only begotten Son of God you must believe you must take it serious Okay so verse two Peter you know arrives back in Jerusalem to face a scorching rebuke by some of the more narrow-minded Believers I'm sure you know a couple somewhere and since the news arrived first they had all their arguments ready their favorite quotes were underlined highlighted Peter was simply wrong there's just no other way about it you know in verse three you actually went into the house and you ate with those heathens what's wrong with you Peter Peter had the keys he had the Holy Ghost yet they're condemning him because he wasn't following the rules that they had figured out you see so when Peter you know he told his side of the story in detail it's verses 4-8 um you know he tells the whole story about you know this man had div Vision send men to chop and so forth now look at Verse 18 of chapter 11 and when they heard these things they held their peace oh so they heard the other side of the argument they calm down down and glorified God saying then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life yeah the doors open for the Gentiles now okay so it gets a little better so we are over here in the 21st century we call ourselves Believers because we believe all the word we don't put any butts and no that's not right no there was an ark there was people going through the desert we're not doing that today because God's got his word section off into pieces we're over here in the back of the book where we're getting ready to go and all the signs around us are obvious you see and so we don't want to be like you know cafeteria Christians just take the the chocolate just the little pieces we like but we believe all the word you see and um uh brother Bram told us that the word all Dov Tales together and if it doesn't then read it again you can't go wrong reading your Bible this is our guide book you see so the angel that appeared to Cornelius um he could have told him the whole story he could have wrote a wall here coration you do this and this and this and this no he said go down there find this man bring him he'll tell you what to do yeah says right here verse 14 I believe it is uh he shall tell thee the words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved so they were ready they want to be saved they want they want to get with the program and you see God has put it in his word over here in Romans chapter U where is it chapter 10 uh the the plan that Noah the Baptist and everybody else they got it down path but it's for us also just because we're up here in the top of the pyramid we can't just throw part of it away no in in Romans 10 verse 9 if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead you will be saved simple formula verse 10 for with the heart man believeth into righteousness and with the mouth confession is made into salvation for the scripture says you know in their old Bible whosoever believeth on him should not be ashamed and you're probably wondering where that is that's actually in Isaiah 28:16 okay says here for there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek that's what they were dealing with then so there's no difference between the American and the Mexican and the one from Congo and one from Canada no it's God over a whole thing you see that's why it says here for there's no difference between these for the same Lord uh over all is Rich to all that call on his name so for whosoever shall call upon his name on the name of the Lord shall be saved well that sounds good so far but how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed you got to you got to believe okay then we got to back the truck up a little further how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard so that's why these brothers going to Mexico my country yeah I was born down there um they're going to announce the gospel you see how shall they believe on whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without oh there it is preacher in the Bible I mean I didn't write the Bible but if we don't speak what it says how do we expect any blessing you you can't go north and get to San Antonio it doesn't work you got to go by the book okay and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things okay so these people in cesaria were chosen of God uh they were elect of God but they needed help and God provided the help they needed it was his way his timing always every time on time now everybody here came to the knowledge of the Lord at a different time we all didn't come the same day and there's things said today maybe You' never heard before you're going to go out when you hear it again oh that's what brother George said so there's a time of accepting you see and God knows what you need when you need it that's why he calls you to church that's why you're building this new church which is beautiful and it's going to be lovely and I'll be back but for now here we are we're enjoying the service and God knows what he's doing now um because of you know a lot of things going on today I want to share five quotations with you the first one is uh the angel of God 1947 where brother Bram says now God could have sent the angel down just like here he sent the angel to Cornelius the angel could have told him the whole story no doesn't work that way he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent an angel to speak through the voice of a man God always used man for his work is that right he doesn't use organization so forth or Mechanical Devices he uses men and Sunday school teachers and people's Godly lives you know okay 1950 God and his people God does not fall on denominations God Falls not God does not fall upon Mechanical Devices the Holy Spirit fell on men I know you get tired of it but you remember when we were in school repetition oh and you finally caught on well that's what we're doing here conference 1960 God came down and the Conference was held how The Church Must Be run must it be run by a bishop organization some mechanical device how must it be run there was 120 in the emperor room that's where it started uh 1962 Behold a greater than Solomon God doesn't take an idol he takes a man and if a man will prostrate himself in the presence of God God then puts himself in that man amen and the man becomes a living creature that God is living in not a dead Idol but a man God never used Idols he always used men get it in God doesn't use Machinery Mechanical Devices he uses men okay so those few people out there that only want to hear what he said after 63 uh in God in Simplicity in 63 he always works in Simplicity but God in the beginning could have made the son to preach the gospel because I don't know if you noticed if you get up early enough the sun comes up right on time never fails and the scientists have figured it out to such a degree that they know when there's going to be an eclipse 30 years ahead because it's they can depend on it it doesn't depend on whether you know it feels like it or not the sun is always there the Moon is always there but God didn't use that or the winds or an angel he ordained men for that purpose and he never changes it so every believer listens to God's Prophet that that's our whole life I've been working with brother R's words for over 50 years and just get it in in in Spanish to where people can understand it well you know you remember the four steps I gave you but it doesn't require somebody from headquarters now on this day at this time you push the button that's organized religion that's not the way God operates I'm sorry you know so let's move on to more pleasant things here so here's the main man you know the man with the keys he's having a home meeting just a few people exactly like on the day of Pentecost and you know Jesus told them in in John 14:25 these things have I spoken to you being present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will s in my name he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance the things I told you we need the holy ghost in our life it's not optional not if you feel like it not if the you know stars are just right no you need the Holy Ghost so when the narrow-minded Believers heard the whole story they quieted down wow this is for everyone not just us because the master told him in Mark 8:34 who Serv will come after me and deny himself take up his cross and follow me the gospel is for whosoever will that's right there's no segregation with God you know he knows what he's doing doing okay so God knows who the elect are I don't know who they are now I hate to tell you but the fact is there's three kinds of Believers in every group of people I see some people going to sleep back there where's my I didn't bring my level I might throw something but there's three kinds of Believers in every crowd I don't know who you are we're all fine right here but when you go out of here and you're drinking coffee and probably eating too much pie or something yeah baldheaded preacher and that baldheaded Pastor you know all those kind of comments they won't know who you are yeah so don't worry about the person next to you who are you you see okay so God knows who the elect I don't know who they are you know we cast The Net God puts it in their heart okay so meanwhile in verse 19 we focus on those that were scattered after the death of Steven and if you remember we covered that before but these people saw that people getting killed for following this way so they picked up stuff and they they went to other places to raise their family um they traveled far away they went to Lebanon course you see their world was very small Marco polar hadn't been born yet they they didn't know it was a round ball out here and the people over there no they they the world was small so they went far away to Lebanon 120 Mi North they sailed all the way over to Cypress 150 Mi they went up to Turkey which is Antioch 300 Mi they went seeking someplace less dangerous to raise their family and um when they settled they settled in an a a Jewish Community you know and um they started testifying yeah where didd you come from what happened to you what's going on down there so they started testifying and um uh they stayed with their own own kind but you see see from chapter 2 we learned that Jews were everywhere because you see on the day of Pentecost Jesus told them now you guys need to go up to the upper room and wait until he didn't tell them how many days he didn't tell them exactly what's going to happen you'll know it when it happens so there they are 10 days but they didn't know how long so day one two and so forth at the same time there's people gathered in Jerusalem from all these countries because in the old Testament we had seven different Feast occasions throughout the year and on three of those occasions all the male Believers must come to Jerusalem and you know worship it just so happened that there was an overlay while these 10 days are going on these six days are going on too and so when the 10 days are up they're all still there and they come out and they're speaking languages that these people understand because in the church their Bible is in Hebrew so they all spoke Hebrew all for all over the world they still do but they spoke the language where they come from so they were at least bilingual and so when these guys come out of the upper room stumbling around and speaking this other language somebody there were 16 different languages they were speaking and they heard him in their language but with a Galilean accent it's like when people come from Canada you know you know they didn't wasn't born here and so they had this accent and that was what was going on on the day of Pentecost okay so um some of them spoke Greek they in verse 20 Cyprus is still Cyprus uh sirene is now Libya and of course these places are in in the news all the time and let's see what it says in verse 21 of chapter 11 um for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee and so God was blessing the testimonies all you have to do is let your light shine you don't have to put a sign out Believers live here or whatever you know the people from from out in Salt Lake City they got the little sign you know Elder so and so Elder are you kidding me the 21 years old and um yeah you've seen them do you realize that those those people that are that are going out like that they say they're missionaries they go some foreign country for two years their family has to put up $10,000 for that to happen in the first place it's ridiculous so all you got to do is let your light shine naturally God will do the supernatural because every piece of the puzzle is important God knows where it belongs okay so when the apostles at Jerusalem heard about the Revival in these far away places they sent Barnabas now Barnabas is the son of encouragement and that's what he did he went to encourage um let's see here where we at verse 11 chapter 11 verse 23 uh no but anyway he he went over there to encourage them and they um they had great time in the meantime Paul went back to his place entire SST to be his family and then uh uh Barnabas went to find him and they um they uh were they came back to to Antioch and they were with the Believers there had a great time and the Believers were first called Christians at Antioch you know and reason I can't find it I'm still here in Romans yeah in Acts chap 11 26 um and when he found him he brought him to Antioch and it came to pass the whole year for a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch you see so the term church was first used over in chapter 8 Saul made Havoc of the church and other places but these were simply local Gatherings of Believers of like Faith they didn't have a building like this oh they in their home under a tree in the park whatever only in the 4th century did the church mean did the word mean a building you see so in forming a church these early Christians did not drop out of society and you know go off and have a commun someplace um they didn't form congregations that competed one another for members it was a radical powerful New Concept driven by the power of the Holy Ghost which dominated their lives a holy ghost was obvious you see and so the people in the street called them Christians because they live the life of Christ can they say that about you wherever you go tomorrow oh there goes a Christian or there goes somebody that stole some money or that guy stole the other guy's wife you know no Christians you see and like the methodists you know why they call call a Methodist because they came along and established a methodical way of worship it was there was a method so they called a Methodist and just like here at first it was a a word of uh derision you know oh those Christians but it stuck because they do live the life of Christ but I think I mentioned once before in the Catholic Church there's a certain saint that some of you remember Francis of a remember that okay so Francis of AIS was a Italian priest he preached the gospel brother brandom said so and so one of the things he said preach always use words when necessary yeah like when you're driving when you're shopping when you're in school you got to love those that don't love you that's when they know you're a Christian you know so they were called of the way uh in the beginning they were mostly Jewish but here to Antioch it was Multicultural there was all kinds of people so it was no longer enough to call them Jews Greeks or Romans they had a central theme Christ and that was at first kind of a put down but um it caught on and the church in Antioch was growing and from Jerusalem it came down prophets to visit him you know one of them was called agabus and he gave warning that a famine was coming see a prophecy is something serious it's not the Lord is coming and no it's got to be something really serious and so it did come and you can check history and read about Emperor Claudius Caesar the fourth emperor of Rome very bad ruler and during his time there was a famine and that's when he expelled the Jews and some of the Christians from Rome but in the first show of Brotherly kindness that we have in the Bible the church at Antioch sent missionary money to up to Jerusalem okay by the hands of Paul and uh Barnabas to the Saints in Judea that were hurting now these people lived their Christianity it wasn't just you know me and know God bless you and see you later no they actually shared they actually sacrificed for each other you know and like brother Ram says eternal life is living for others so that others can see Christianity in action you know and it wasn't just quoting and arguing but they really cared for one another and the Word was manifesting in their lives and the followers and Jesus Christ was alive they could actually you know they didn't have their Bible to quote from but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we are in the Forever part now we we passed yesterday pass now it's today so he was very alive in the first century because people believe and totally yielded to the spirit of God John 13:35 says by this shall all men know that you're my disciples because because you go to a certain nice Church up on Central Avenue because you all Drive nice cars no because you have love one to the other they notice that because they don't have that they speak about nonsense and they have their parties and their stuff but when they see people that actually care for each other actually send money to the foreign field to help those people those people really care so um do we have time for a few more verses yeah there's no fee in the parking right if the Rapture yeah if the Rapture comes good yeah okay so chapter 12 this is interesting chapter 12 says now about that time well all this is going on over here that we just talked about Herod the king stretched forth his hands to Vex certain of the church that means put the pressure on them make their life miserable that's what Vex means okay so this King Herod there's seven different family members in the herodian family in Scripture it's another study they were all anti-god evil backed by headquarters in Rome this here is head uh Herod agria he was feeling all powerful you know his normal arrogant self full of himself and thought it would be pleasing to his Jewish subjects to put some pressure on the Christians H verse two and he killed James the brother of John with a sword and see we've heard about it this week week how they've beheaded people over there okay it sounds terrible but there's no suffering instantly you're dead heads on the ground and that's what they did back here they've been doing it for centuries and so uh this is John uh James the brother of John the two sons of Zebedee and this is now the fifth persecution of the early church so from history James son of Zebedee was a fisherman by trade when Jesus called him and his brother to uh a lifetime of ministry okay as a strong leader of the church James was ultimately beheaded at Jerusalem the Roman officer who guarded James watched and was amazed as James defended his faith at his trial later the officer walking beside James to the place of execution overcome by conviction that's Holy Ghost conviction he saw this man you know defend the faith yes I will not recant I will stick with the truth and he's his job is to you know walk beside him so they're walking to the out there where they're going to execute him overcome by conviction he declared his new Faith to the judge and knelt beside James to also accept beheading as a Christian these people were not playing Church it wasn't convenient it was the end cuz once your head comes off you're finished I don't know if you've seen the film but there is a u it's on DVD and so forth Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ very very close to scripture it was in the theaters even so in verse three when Herod saw this action what cutting off heads was popular with the followers it made him look good you know he decided to go for the main man the one with the keys and so he probably heard some of the testimonies how God protected his people and look at 12:4 and when he had apprehended him so he arrested he sent guys out okay arrest that one with the keys he put him in prison and delivered him to four guonian of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people okay so he's arrested Peter got him in prison and it's a big word there but it means 16 soldiers now these weren't soldiers like this guy on the front row now these soldiers probably look more like Billy wellfed you know work out every day you know right he wish he did they were tough looking guys 16 soldiers to watch one preacher see how that worked out so here's Peter in prison and uh now at the meantime while he's in prison down in John Mark's house they got a prayer chain going at 24 hours while they're praying you know and so he's in prison and he's chained on either side to two of these soldiers so there's two of them and there's 14 more guarding the gates okay and so here's God's main man sleeping in the Roman prison chained between two big soldiers and um they um uh on a certain day after the weekend after Easter and so forth Herod you know worked into his busy schedule to have Peter come up for execution take his head off but just hours before dur during the night Peter's sleeping there soundly he's not squirming and no he knows God's in control and so he's sleeping soundly chained between these soldiers and all of a sudden an angel appeared in a bright light yeah and the angel touched him barely touched him woke him up get up quickly chains fell off but the solders stayed asleep the chains are still on the soldiers only they fell off of him so he gets up they're all still asleep he gets up and uh the angel says in verse 8 get dressed put on your sandals put on your coat follow me so he's following the angel through the prison he looks back and there's those two soldiers still asleep they're going out and um they go to the Iron Gate it opened by itself past another gate and they get up out to the street and they go up to the corner and the angel disappeared yeah look at verse 11 of chapter 12 and when Peter was come to himself he said now I know of assurity that the Lord has sent his Angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from the expectations of the people of the Jews okay so he made his way down to the house where they were praying remember 24/7 boy they are serious Lord help our brother he's over in that filthy prison we need him he's your servant and they're just man they're praying we don't know how many people but there's probably a dozen or more and so um he's out there knocking on the gate you know out at the street he's beating on the gate they's busy praying but there was one girl named Roa and she was uh one of those people that's always busy you know serving the coffee or the tea and you know somebody's got to clean up the mess and she was kind of praying silently but anyway she was busy and um so she she hears the knocking and she goes to respond and she hears Peter's voice but she goes back to tell them Peter's there he's he's right outside now honey you're just excited in fact you're crazy she insisted argued with him okay maybe it's his Angel they were so busy praying so concerned but without enough Faith to believe for an answer how many times have we been there Lord you know I need that ,000 and you keep keep hey okay you said it God heard you the first time now wait for the answer so we get so caught up in the dos and the don'ts mechanics of the word we fail to see the uh the Fulfillment so we and we get really upset when people can't see things our a little narrow peculiar way this is the way it's going to be we don't step back and look at the big picture you know so meanwhile Peter's out there beating on the gate hey folks you know I'm here and um and so finally they opened the gate they saw him they're very surprised wow what are you doing here well You' all been praying oh my so he came in he gave a brief testimony well meanwhile back at the prison now the sun's coming up you know kind of some confusion and they really got worried okay 12 and verse 19 and when Herod had uh you know called for him and they found him not he examined the keepers so 16 guys and commanded that they should be put to death well why is that well because see not believing in the Supernatural he didn't believe in Supernatural and with no good explanation the guards must have let him go it has to be their fault the preacher got away and so all their heads came off I mean that's the way they did business back then so verses 20- 23 you know Herod had a lot of difficulties with the administration there were complaints so he took some time off went down to his Seaside home we can still see part of it when we go over there and uh he he scheduled a certain day dressed in his best outfit and he's going to speak to his people you know and so he was a real spokesman they were so proud of their leader his tremendous abilities and they said it's like God speaking to us not just a man he was very proud and arrogant and indeed anointed with a spirit look what happened in 12 and 23 and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost now see we're all sitting here comfortably the air conditioner is just right everybody had supper everybody had coffee see this guy he died and the the worms start eating him amazing so we don't play around with God never play around with God you see um now there's a a testimony and those of you that remember but uh I think about four or five years ago there was a a man over in Congo and he was at one time he was a good gospel preacher but see he got out of balance and when you get out of balance you're going to have problems and he got out so out of balance he started teaching that William Brandon was greater than Jesus Christ he out of balance and he started preaching that stuff and so one day he's out there preaching it and he takes the the the picture of Hoffman rips it and Stomps on it yeah he said and if I'm not telling the truth may God strike me dead and down he goes dead right there so they they picked him up and trying to get him to his village to B you know bury him and the worms were already eaten him they had to bury him on the way yeah that happened in our our time just like this back here God says in Exodus 34:14 Thou shalt for Thou shalt wor worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous that's something you can take home with you one of God's names is jealous he's a jealous God Deuteronomy 4:24 for the Lord thy God is a consuming fire even a jealous God Isaiah 428 I am the Lord thy God I am the Lord that is my name and my glory will I not give to another neither any praise to graven images it's real serious Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that will he will also reap for if a man Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life life Everlasting so as humans we make choices every day you're looking at one person I'm looking at all the different colors and you know you all decided what color to wear some wor High some didn't some didn't even comb their hair so I see all that you know so we made choices but you made the right choice you came to hear another portion of the word of God yeah we need to line up you know so we must get in the spirit of God giving God all the honor because other people made other choices you know so I'm thankful that you all made a sacrifice you said hey it's important yeah it's real important and so when I come back and we're in that other church I want to see it full okay so when we finish chapter 11 Saul and barab us you know taking the missionary offering to the Saints in Jerusalem and here at the end of chapter 12 they came back and they returned to Antioch so that is our scripture lesson for tonight we hope somebody got something out of it that you can take something home if it's not in your language if it's not plain we're wasting time and so you all of you have the church age book that we uh put out with the paragraph numbers and so forth I've done the same thing with the seal book I have a few with me we're going to send more but it's in a more readable fashion may God bless you it makes you want to bring it to yourself individually don't it you know and the the secret is the prophet of God said that this bride should have a book of Acts written behind it but that takes it's not the church like the group because God don't deal with groups he deals with individuals but it's every individual consecrating their life so the Holy Spirit can move and lead them and then he's the great conductor and he takes all the little parts that he leads you puts them all together and then you start seeing the supernatural working amongst us without any one individual getting the credit and him getting all the glory but it's like we're all pieces of a puzzle and he's putting those pieces of this puzzle together and dealing with each of the heart and if each of us would play our part he'll draw the picture and so we really do that we'll get some of the uh seals books uh and get them into the library so you can be able to pick them up uh through the library you just need to talk to Juliet and then she can work all that out with you out of the library you love the Lord amen remember the carnal mind is IM with God but the spiritual mind is life and and if if you can believe all things are possible let your mind embrace the supernatural let the holy Spirit bring it alive in your life and make the word live and you for your own personal self will be able to look at the book of Acts for these signs shall follow them that believe the believer doesn't create them they simply follow a spirit filled life full of love full of enthusiasm not ashamed of the Gospel amen because it's the glory of God it's the way of Salvation and we're not ashamed of it God bless you tonight let's stand together and have a word of prayer let's just bow our heads and maybe you just look at your life right now and ask yourself do I see God moving in my life do I see myself growing growing and increasing in the knowledge of Jesus Christ because the scripture says that you might increase in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus do you have Revelation for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and ask yourself is he alive in my life am I moving up am I growing am I involv D am I hungry am I thirsty for the things of God do I want to see the angels of the Lord that are promised to be encamped about them that believe do I want to see them working on my behalf and come out of the carnal mindset and get into the spiritual realm where you can say in your heart all things are possible nothing can pluck me out of the palm
