[43:33] to effectual working in the measure of
[43:36] every part maketh increase of the body
[43:41] andto the edifying of itself in
[43:44] love Precious Jesus may you bless these
[43:48] words in Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[43:53] you may be seated
[44:00] I believe that the move of the Holy
[44:03] Spirit put in Brother David
[44:07] and all preacher preaching since the
[44:11] beginning of this year the burden to
[44:14] lead each one of us to the
[44:18] success and to have faith and we know
[44:21] that the success for Christian is to be
[44:25] born again
[44:27] is to have
[44:29] faith if to believe God in everything
[44:33] God have given to us in his word in the
[44:38] Bible
[44:40] and as you read in the Book of
[44:43] Joshua brother Billy tried
[44:47] to preach about it this morning that the
[44:51] success is not only to take the Bible
[44:56] but the success
[44:57] is in the message of the
[45:01] how and we knew that
[45:05] Joshua was a
[45:08] Believer we can say that J was a
[45:12] Christian but in the time of josua God
[45:17] Called
[45:19] Moses God gave his word to
[45:23] Moses God gave his laws to Moses
[45:28] mes and the only way Jos can have
[45:33] success the same God who call Moses was
[45:37] the same God who call
[45:39] Joshua but God didn't give another word
[45:43] to
[45:44] Joshua God asked to Joshua
[45:49] to
[45:51] stay in the word of Moses
[45:57] so for our time we
[45:59] know we don't need to proof with the
[46:03] Bible that the Moses of our time is
[46:07] brother
[46:09] BR we know that in our time God told to
[46:15] us
[46:16] behold I will send to
[46:19] you Elijah the
[46:22] prophet in the holy man God pointed to
[46:26] him him for
[46:28] us so if you want to have the success as
[46:32] Joshua yes sir the only thing we need to
[46:37] do is to keep the word of God to keep
[46:42] the message of the
[46:44] hour to believe
[46:47] everything God have given to us through
[46:50] this
[46:52] message and this can lead each one of us
[46:57] to the success because God deal with
[47:00] individual God deal with each one of
[47:04] us but if each one of us have Fellowship
[47:08] a really fellowship with God if each one
[47:11] of us believe
[47:14] God if each one of us because God has
[47:18] already give us give to us the power and
[47:21] the only thing we need is to have the
[47:24] faith to put it power in
[47:28] action we can have power but we need the
[47:34] faith the genuine Faith the faith Jesus
[47:38] had to put this power in the
[47:45] action and if we have
[47:49] faith we are born again we have the Holy
[47:53] Spirit we have the True Fellowship with
[47:57] God we will come to the fellowship one
[48:01] to the
[48:02] other it will bring us to the
[48:05] [Music]
[48:07] unity to be
[48:09] together and brother bam say that the
[48:12] unity bring more
[48:16] power and brother bam says
[48:21] in as the ego Ste up a n
[48:26] preached
[48:29] 59 August 50
[48:34] 15 paragraph
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] 14 the one I'm
[48:41] say if you can put it
[48:48] on so we know that our success is in the
[48:51] message of brother Bram and brother says
[48:54] here that my Ministry
[48:57] is a Ministry trying to unite the body
[49:01] of Christ
[49:04] together his ministry is a Ministry
[49:07] trying to unite the body of Christ
[49:11] together not United denomination to one
[49:16] denomination but unit brothers and
[49:19] sisters as one group of
[49:23] people one in purpose
[49:27] one in art one in unity to see the
[49:32] coming of the Lord Jesus
[49:36] Christ so brother say that his ministry
[49:39] is to bring us
[49:42] together to bring us to have the same
[49:46] purpose the same Faith the same art till
[49:51] the coming of the Lord to see the coming
[49:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:59] so butam need us to be in the
[50:05] unity and you know um I would try
[50:08] to want belong even I want you know that
[50:12] I I couldn't belong with my English
[50:15] [Laughter]
[50:21] so but I know that while I'm speaking
[50:26] you are praying for me I know it and I
[50:30] believe that God
[50:32] can respond to answer to your prayer and
[50:35] help me to to move
[50:38] on
[50:40] uh so God want us to be
[50:46] one Jesus pray for us to be
[50:49] one in the unity that can help us to
[50:54] make
[50:58] many things and to be more power to be
[51:04] powerful but each one of us is
[51:09] different God make us
[51:12] different God gave different gift to
[51:16] each one of
[51:18] us but we are in the same
[51:23] body and each one of us as a part to
[51:27] play in a god
[51:31] syphony there's no one we are bigger
[51:34] than another one we are all brothers and
[51:39] sisters we are all Sons and Daughters of
[51:43] God serving for the same thing for the
[51:46] same
[51:47] purpose and brother butam say
[51:51] in the voice of the side preach
[51:58] 64 March
[52:02] 13 paragraph
[52:08] 32 it
[52:12] say you each one set in God
[52:18] economy just for its
[52:22] place one fast all the time and commune
[52:27] with
[52:28] God while another one cast out the devil
[52:33] because his one is
[52:34] fasting but it's the whole body of
[52:39] Christ working together the
[52:43] unity so you can pray and
[52:47] fast and B Billy will be cast out the
[52:51] devil because of your
[52:54] prayer you're playing your part is
[52:56] playing his part and we are all together
[52:59] in the same team in the same
[53:06] body you he say oh
[53:10] sorry one fast all the time and commune
[53:13] with God while another one cast out the
[53:16] devil because this one is
[53:19] fasting but is the whole body of Christ
[53:23] working together the unity when we see
[53:27] this denomination barrier breaking us up
[53:31] that W out my heart see because that's
[53:36] the thing that separate us we are
[53:41] one there is no big people among
[53:45] us no great among us we are all the same
[53:52] we're children of
[53:54] God there is only one one great among us
[53:58] and that
[54:00] Christ we must recognize him and if we
[54:04] seek honor one from another we can't
[54:09] have faith that's right because we
[54:13] having faith in
[54:15] one
[54:17] another we got to have faith in
[54:23] Christ is the one Among Us that we must
[54:27] have faith in and then faith in what is
[54:33] doing and has given to
[54:39] us I can remember Peter and John walking
[54:42] to the
[54:44] temple they was together we know the
[54:47] testimony in the
[54:49] Bible the Bible says
[54:52] that both of them look at the gu say
[54:57] look at us but only
[55:03] Peter we
[55:06] spoke we have no money we have no
[55:10] God but when we are speaking about his
[55:14] testimony every time we say Peter and
[55:18] John we never say Peter
[55:21] alone Peter and John
[55:27] because they were
[55:30] together in the same body working for
[55:33] the same thing the same
[55:37] purpose and brother
[55:42] say not the UN need like the world no I
[55:46] want to
[55:54] say yes God want us to be
[55:58] one and this Unity is
[56:01] not like the world like the
[56:05] unation like some groups in the
[56:09] world our Unity it around the world and
[56:14] the only thing we tie us together is
[56:18] Jesus Christ the
[56:22] word every time people try to be
[56:25] together to do something together
[56:28] without God it can't
[56:31] work we can
[56:33] remember nimod with the B
[56:38] Tower they try to build something
[56:42] together they try to have power together
[56:47] but without
[56:49] God and when God
[56:52] come he broke this Unity they have
[56:56] confusion in the
[57:00] language they were no more able to
[57:03] listen to understand one to
[57:07] other
[57:09] but at the
[57:12] Pentecost when people were
[57:17] together with God when God
[57:22] came Peter speaking in one language
[57:27] but everyone was able to understand in
[57:33] the own
[57:34] language
[57:36] right because God was in the
[57:43] midst God gave them his
[57:48] power so our Unity have to be around the
[57:52] word of God
[57:56] we have to go forward with
[58:00] god with the
[58:02] message and brother
[58:05] say
[58:07] in a total
[58:10] Deliverance pre
[58:12] 59 July
[58:18] 12th paragraph
[58:22] 7 it says
[58:29] to deliver paragra s yeah I was
[58:33] appreciating brother nille or brother B
[58:38] pray how he pray for the people and
[58:42] asking for help and
[58:45] mercy and if we just look along you
[58:50] always everything that goes on you'll
[58:54] find there's something
[58:56] real genuine about it and then when B
[59:01] come and B the Deacon and so forth up he
[59:06] to the platform to pronounce the
[59:09] blessing of God upon the church offering
[59:12] I hear him speaking in his prayer to God
[59:16] about those men how that they pray for
[59:21] one
[59:23] another and that those me and that that
[59:28] does me good to hear a pastor that can
[59:31] pray over his Deacon and the Deacon pray
[59:35] back for the pastor when you see a
[59:39] church going into corporation like that
[59:43] well something is fixing to
[59:46] move that's the way the church has to be
[59:50] in
[59:51] order and it give me just an idea for
[59:57] for a text I was going to speak on the
[1:00:00] blessing of
[1:00:02] cage and the refusal of the heing of the
[1:00:06] report of the spies but then I changed
[1:00:10] my mind to something else then can you
[1:00:14] see brother Bram have something else to
[1:00:19] preach but only when he he the pastor
[1:00:24] pray for the Deacon Deacon pray for the
[1:00:28] pastor it
[1:00:30] changed his
[1:00:33] seron it changed the C he was about to
[1:00:37] preach
[1:00:39] on so God want us to be one praying one
[1:00:46] to other not only in the
[1:00:50] church even in your home in your secret
[1:00:53] closet when you are alone
[1:01:00] I think each one of us have some prayer
[1:01:03] requests some
[1:01:06] needs and we if when we are
[1:01:09] alone We Trust we
[1:01:12] believe that
[1:01:15] God answer to our
[1:01:19] prayer so if God answer to I
[1:01:22] pray we can pray for every need we have
[1:01:27] we can take time to think about each one
[1:01:31] of us to think about a pastor to think
[1:01:34] about Deon
[1:01:37] trusty and bring every need to the Lord
[1:01:41] because we know that is able and
[1:01:45] faithful to
[1:01:54] answer and when we when we Pray when we
[1:01:56] are together in one Echo praying one to
[1:02:00] other God can
[1:02:02] make great thing among
[1:02:06] us as in the Bible we can read it in the
[1:02:10] book of Acts chapter
[1:02:17] 12 Acts chapter 12
[1:02:28] we can start uh at verse
[1:02:32] 5 act
[1:02:34] 125 the Bible
[1:02:39] says Peter therefore was kept in
[1:02:43] prison
[1:02:45] but prayer was made without ceasing of
[1:02:51] the church into God for
[1:02:54] him Peter there wasn't the
[1:02:57] present but
[1:02:59] Christian brother and
[1:03:01] sister was praying without sing for
[1:03:06] him and when he would have B him for the
[1:03:12] same
[1:03:12] night Peter was
[1:03:15] sleeping Between Two Soldiers Peter was
[1:03:20] sleeping he was not
[1:03:24] praying Peter
[1:03:26] was
[1:03:29] sleeping Peter was sleeping Between Two
[1:03:33] Soldiers bound with two chains and the
[1:03:37] keeper before the door kept the prison
[1:03:41] and
[1:03:42] behold the angel of the Lord came upon
[1:03:46] him he was sleeping but the angel of the
[1:03:50] Lord came up Peter why
[1:03:58] and
[1:03:59] below the angel of the Lord came upon
[1:04:04] him and the light
[1:04:06] shineth in the prison and he SM Peter on
[1:04:11] the side and rais him rais him up saying
[1:04:15] he rise up quickly and his chain fell
[1:04:18] off from his hand and the angel said
[1:04:22] unto him go thyself and bind on thy
[1:04:27] sandal and so he
[1:04:29] did and he sa unto him cast thy garment
[1:04:33] about thee and follow
[1:04:36] me and he went out and follow him and
[1:04:40] with not that it was true which he was
[1:04:45] sleeping yeah he was sleeping so he was
[1:04:48] not that it was true maybe he thought
[1:04:51] that he was
[1:04:53] dreaming but it was true
[1:04:57] which was done by the angel but th is
[1:05:00] saw a
[1:05:02] vision when they were past the first and
[1:05:05] the second world they come into the iron
[1:05:08] gates that leadth into the city which
[1:05:12] opened to them of his own Echo and they
[1:05:15] went out and passed on to one street and
[1:05:21] forth with the angel departed for him
[1:05:24] and when Peter was come to himself he
[1:05:27] said now I know of a surely that the
[1:05:32] Lord have sent his Angel and have
[1:05:36] delivered me out of the hand of aod and
[1:05:39] from all the expectation of the people
[1:05:43] of the Jew and when he had consider the
[1:05:47] thing he came to the house of Mary the
[1:05:51] mother of John was her name was Mark
[1:05:56] where many were gathering together
[1:06:04] praying I could be in bandage sleeping I
[1:06:07] can be tired I can be
[1:06:12] desperate but if you can pray for
[1:06:16] me God can send his Angel to me to help
[1:06:21] me the Bible don't didn't say that Peter
[1:06:25] was
[1:06:28] praying we know that the other side I
[1:06:32] think it was Paul and Silas in the
[1:06:35] prison they was praying and worshiping
[1:06:38] and the angel come but Peter he was
[1:06:46] sleeping but the prayer from brothers
[1:06:49] and sister send the angel of God to him
[1:06:54] to help him Amen to save
[1:06:59] him that's why God need us to be
[1:07:05] together to be one
[1:07:09] Echo to love one to
[1:07:14] other
[1:07:16] say
[1:07:18] in tting for
[1:07:23] Life preach

[1:14:44] there's a grace of God beating in your
[1:14:46] heart and you can look at them and say
[1:14:48] oh if God can extend the same Grace
[1:14:50] there's one struggling there's one in
[1:14:52] the difficulties and they having Maybe
[1:14:55] financial trouble or dealing with
[1:14:56] something you can remember a time where
[1:14:59] you were in that same boat and you can
[1:15:01] go and pray now you ministering now it's
[1:15:04] really life it's not just words it's you
[1:15:07] knowing exactly what is it that you're
[1:15:09] giving and I believe that's why the word
[1:15:12] the the God puts a body together is so
[1:15:14] we can Minister one to another and I've
[1:15:16] always said this you know even as our
[1:15:18] pastor will say there are no Schism in
[1:15:21] the body there's no unused or uh uh
[1:15:25] unuseful member and I'll tell you this
[1:15:27] each one plays a role each one has a
[1:15:30] role to play you may come there and sit
[1:15:33] there and Sunday after Sunday Wednesday
[1:15:35] after Wednesday and think oh nobody
[1:15:37] cares nobody sees me let me say this the
[1:15:40] day you're going to be missing we're
[1:15:41] going to know you're not
[1:15:43] here our presence here plays a role we
[1:15:46] we are part of a greater thing and we
[1:15:49] bring together something to to
[1:15:51] strengthen one another each one
[1:15:53] supplying for the need of the body
[1:15:55] by Your Presence by your prayers as we
[1:15:57] heard and by all things and I like that
[1:16:00] you know God comes and he's showing that
[1:16:03] you know one was sleeping yes is Peter
[1:16:05] just fallen asleep completely and God is
[1:16:08] working over the other side with the
[1:16:10] brothers that were in an intercession
[1:16:12] for him you know so it means we are
[1:16:14] really whatever you can do if you can
[1:16:16] pray for one God is behind that he's
[1:16:19] doing something your prayers are not
[1:16:21] stuck in the ceiling they they're
[1:16:24] reaching heaven and God is working
[1:16:26] behind the scenes and and so I certainly
[1:16:29] appreciate that let's all stand and you
[1:16:32] know we're going to read uh communion
[1:16:34] scripture at this time and uh we'll ask
[1:16:38] the brothers to go and get ready for uh
[1:16:43] communion let's turn our Bibles in 1
[1:16:48] Corinthians chapter 11 we're going to
[1:16:51] read from verse the 23rd verse
[1:16:56] he said for I have received of the Lord
[1:16:59] that which I have also delivered unto
[1:17:01] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:17:03] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:17:07] where he had given
[1:17:09] thanks he Breo it and said take eat this
[1:17:13] is my body which is broken for you do
[1:17:16] this this do in remembrance of me and
[1:17:19] after the same manner he also took the
[1:17:21] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[1:17:25] cup is a new testony in my in my
[1:17:28] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[1:17:32] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:17:36] ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye
[1:17:40] do show the Lord's death till he come it
[1:17:43] says wherefore whatsoever shall eat this
[1:17:47] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:17:49] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:17:52] and blood of the Lord but let him every
[1:17:54] man examine himself so let him eat of
[1:17:57] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:18:01] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:18:04] eaten and drinking damnation to
[1:18:07] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:18:10] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:18:14] among you and many sleep for if we would
[1:18:17] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:18:20] but when we are judged we are chasten of
[1:18:23] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:18:25] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:18:28] brethren when ye come together to eat t
[1:18:32] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:18:35] let him eat at
[1:18:36] home that he may not come together unto
[1:18:40] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:18:42] order when I come
[1:18:52] amen and let's just bow our heads and
[1:18:55] pray together our gracious father we
[1:18:57] bring this communion table before you

[1:19:05] even as for one for myself I can say
[1:19:08] father I've always find comfort in
[1:19:10] communion because you said that it's for
[1:19:13] our strength lord it's for the body so
[1:19:15] we could be strengthened it's our
[1:19:17] closeness father this is our fellowship
[1:19:19] as our brother preached father and I'm
[1:19:21] so thankful that we know that there's

[1:19:37] strengthened we become one we become
[1:19:40] stronger we can do greater things

[1:20:04] Lord and become stronger it will give us
[1:20:06] the nutrients and the things that we
[1:20:08] need spiritually Lord to be stronger and
[1:20:11] the wine Father which is the very
[1:20:13] stimulation of Revelation father that it
[1:20:16] would be the lifeline of our body Lord
[1:20:18] that we would know that we have drink of
[1:20:20] the blood of the Lord Jesus in
[1:20:23] representation and be strengthened by it

[1:32:16] was come that he should depart out of

[1:32:22] his own which were in the world he loved
[1:32:25] them un the end and supper being ended
[1:32:28] the devil having put into the heart of
[1:32:31] Judas is carried Simon's son to betray
[1:32:33] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:32:37] given all things unto his hand and that
[1:32:40] it was come from God and went to God he
[1:32:44] raised it from supper and laid aside His
[1:32:47] Garment and took a tow and GED himself
[1:32:50] and after he had poured water into a
[1:32:53] basin and be began to wash his disciples
[1:32:55] feet and wiped them with a tile
[1:32:58] wherewith he was girded then Come Ye to
[1:33:01] Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord
[1:33:05] thou thou wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:33:08] and said unto him what I do that knoweth
[1:33:11] not but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter
[1:33:15] said unto him Thou shalt never wash my
[1:33:18] feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:33:22] not thou has no part with me Simon Peter
[1:33:26] uh Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:33:29] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:33:32] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:33:36] needeth not safe to wash his feet but is
[1:33:39] cleaned every weth and ye are clean but
[1:33:42] not all for he knew who should betray

[1:33:53] and taken His Garment and uh was sat
