[36:28] uh the Lord's looking at us and what it
[36:31] is he wants to see in us you know so
[36:35] many times the church uh we preach to
[36:38] the church that he wants to see people
[36:40] walking up and down the aisles of the
[36:42] hospital you know praying for the sick
[36:44] and he wants all kinds of signs and
[36:47] wonders and a and a
[36:51] manifestation of his spirit and and uh
[36:55] something that uh stands out you know
[36:58] something that you know we can say is a
[37:00] real
[37:01] move and uh I think as we listen to this
[37:04] and we read this uh and if you go back
[37:07] and take this tape and just spend a
[37:09] little bit of time reading it that's
[37:12] where brother Braham starts separating
[37:13] the two
[37:15] kingdoms which we referred to and we did
[37:18] that so our young people can get a
[37:21] visual too you know uh that we could
[37:24] start separating and understanding the
[37:28] existence of these two spirits in the
[37:32] framework not only in the framework of
[37:34] the world but in the framework of the
[37:37] church amen so uh the battle is going on
[37:42] right here and we know the battle going
[37:44] on in our minds because there's so many
[37:47] voices that is speaking to us and it
[37:52] takes a special type of Christian to be
[37:56] able to discern
[37:58] those voices and to be able to stand
[38:01] back and say to those voices that's not
[38:04] what he said that's not what he said and
[38:08] we got to remember that the
[38:10] deceitfulness of this age and so I'd
[38:13] like to start the brothers if they want
[38:15] to they can surely put these quotes up
[38:18] on the board and this is from Satan
[38:21] zeden and it's paragraph 15 and that
[38:25] Satan zeden was was uh preached August
[38:29] 29th
[38:31] 1965 at uh at the Tabernacle there in
[38:36] Jeffersonville random Tabernacle and and
[38:40] so uh he uh came back in the evening and
[38:44] I I I believe if I'm not mistaken that
[38:47] maybe brother Neville preached in the
[38:49] morning and then brother Bram came back
[38:51] and preached this in the
[38:52] evening and so he's talking about
[38:55] Christians and he's talking about the
[38:58] the day that we're living in and so if
[39:01] we just kind of went back a paragraph uh
[39:05] we can see here uh and I read the
[39:09] paragraph 13 about something that would
[39:11] help us see the picture so that's what
[39:14] we tried to do this morning is is draw
[39:17] the picture and the understanding that
[39:20] what hour we're living in we're living
[39:23] in an hour of of of voices trying to
[39:27] draw two different choices two different
[39:31] opinions uh two different Pathways uh
[39:35] two different ways to go and and that's
[39:38] way it's always been every Revival has
[39:40] had twins all down through time uh we
[39:45] could go through them you know Cain and
[39:46] Abel Jesus and Judas and in our day we
[39:50] have the Antichrist Spirit and the true
[39:52] spirit and these two in in our day it's
[39:55] so close but uh just to follow this down
[39:58] just for a few moments because we
[40:01] definitely want to meet the challenge
[40:03] that's set before us that that's what I
[40:06] I don't want to be doing God a service
[40:08] without it being his will I don't want
[40:11] to be excelling in certain things and
[40:15] those not be the things that are
[40:18] important to him you know what it is
[40:21] that he really would like to see from me
[40:24] uh you know it's like you know uh it's
[40:27] like if you went in and you went to your
[40:30] parents and you said well uh dad I
[40:33] washed the truck and I mowed the lawn
[40:35] and I stacked the wood and all this and
[40:38] he's sitting back he says but what I
[40:40] asked you to do is take out the
[40:43] trash you did all this stuff you know
[40:47] but now I'm stuck with the dirty trash
[40:50] you know and and he would would it his
[40:54] heart would have been so much more
[40:56] thrilled if you just take out the trash
[41:00] and then you did that and if you did
[41:02] anything above that well that's great
[41:05] but if you don't do what's asked of you
[41:09] then everything else you do really
[41:11] doesn't hold any value because he loves
[41:16] obedience more than he does
[41:20] sacrifice so let's just read this these
[41:23] things and maybe by the grace of God we
[41:26] can see the
[41:28] picture clearly so we read he says the
[41:31] main thing is to learn to keep the
[41:33] punches off you as much as you can now
[41:36] paragraph 14 now let us look now at this
[41:40] great for a few minutes this great
[41:43] sinful day that we're now living
[41:47] in and I don't believe there's ever was
[41:51] a day that I've ever read in history
[41:56] there's been great days of persecution
[41:59] when the children of God were put to
[42:02] death on every hand but to see the
[42:05] deceitfulness of the enemy we've
[42:10] never we've never had a day like this
[42:15] that we're living in now so he said I've
[42:18] seen the great days of the persecution
[42:20] of the church he said but I've never
[42:22] seen a day like we're living in now it's
[42:25] the most cunning deceitful day and when
[42:29] I see that it brings this that the
[42:33] Christian has to be more on his toe
[42:36] today than he has ever was in any other
[42:41] age so the first thing that that we we
[42:45] can see from the word of God that God
[42:47] wants us to be aware of the
[42:50] danger you know he wants us to be alert
[42:54] of the danger and and we don't usually
[42:57] hold that attitude or that atmosphere
[43:00] around us we we we think that that
[43:03] everything's peace and safety you know
[43:05] every place I go will be fine
[43:08] everything's good I live in America we
[43:11] everything's safe and and uh uh I I
[43:15] don't have any challenges out there but
[43:18] that's not exactly the way it is because
[43:20] he said we've got to be on our toes
[43:23] because it's it's just such a deceitful
[43:26] age uh you know a lot of people like to
[43:29] listen to the radio or or people talk
[43:33] and you know if you find the side that
[43:35] you like to listen to they're kind of
[43:37] saying the things that you like to hear
[43:39] boy you start leaning towards that and
[43:41] pretty soon that becomes truth to you
[43:44] and that's the way it is you know what I
[43:46] mean and you start leaning this way or
[43:48] you start leaning that way and they're
[43:51] both
[43:52] lies they're both run by the same people
[43:57] it's like tobacco companies the one
[44:00] tobacco company made all the
[44:02] cigarettes you know they didn't care how
[44:04] you smoke if they'll just say I'll put a
[44:06] charcoal filter on it you know and and
[44:10] and smoke this one charcoal filter and
[44:13] this cigarette's better than this
[44:15] cigarette and it's the same people
[44:16] making
[44:17] them you know they're just trying
[44:20] they're just trying for you to latch on
[44:24] to something that you can believe
[44:27] people are always looking for something
[44:30] to
[44:31] believe yeah you know I started
[44:33] collecting coins and I I I i' spent
[44:37] quite a bit of time uh collecting coins
[44:40] and so I began to read little more
[44:42] articles and then I found out these
[44:44] coins that I was collecting I had to be
[44:47] careful that they weren't
[44:50] counterfeit I said
[44:52] what this coin's got
[44:55] 1883 rod on on it you trying to tell me
[44:58] it could be fake yeah then they they
[45:02] started explaining all the different
[45:04] ways they make fake stuff you know uh I
[45:09] I'll just we just family I like Sunday
[45:11] night because it's family so I I went
[45:13] and put the offering in the church one
[45:15] time and I got done and the lady to come
[45:18] back and she said uh uh I had to reduce
[45:23] your offering $200 I said why you know I
[45:27] mean I counted it myself well I should
[45:30] have known if I counted it probably
[45:32] wrong anyway but and so she what she did
[45:35] is she she gave me back she said well
[45:38] she showed me here's two there were $200
[45:42] bills that were put in the offering and
[45:45] they look good to me and if you turn
[45:47] them over it said movie
[45:52] money and it's money that they print
[45:55] that they use in movies
[45:58] you know what I mean and it got put in
[46:01] the offering you know what I mean I just
[46:03] wish the person would ass signed their
[46:05] name on it you know what I mean you know
[46:08] but I wanted them
[46:11] back you know I said I want back I want
[46:14] these counterfeit dollars back oh said
[46:17] we're not allowed to give them back I
[46:19] said why not she said well you'll go
[46:21] spend
[46:24] them and what happens the deceit
[46:27] continues on and so you you you know so
[46:31] we hear stories and we hear things and
[46:34] we continue to uh you you know to uh
[46:39] carry on the deceit you you know we keep
[46:43] sharing it out and perpetuating it and
[46:46] and it it begins to continue to one and
[46:50] all those things start to begin to shape
[46:52] in your mind and shape in your attitudes
[46:55] and shap in your approach coach and and
[46:58] uh uh and so all of a sudden you found
[47:02] out there's things in your foundation
[47:04] that you're building on that aren't true
[47:07] and the one of the principles of the
[47:11] Gospel is you have to have the Chief
[47:14] Cornerstone and that we're consider
[47:16] watch Every Man how he builds there
[47:20] upon Paul was actually telling the
[47:23] church the church as it began to build
[47:26] you've got to watch what you put in this
[47:28] Foundation James said there's many
[47:31] amongst us that are are spots and
[47:33] wrinkles in the feast you know they come
[47:35] to the feast and and what do they do
[47:37] they defile many so you this awareness
[47:42] that we have to have is there's two
[47:44] things that we've got to start
[47:46] understanding really to go forward
[47:48] because I want the church to go
[47:51] forward you know we're not trying to
[47:53] take the church back to the Pentecostal
[47:56] age
[47:57] you know what I mean where the blessings
[47:59] flow freely where the Revival was there
[48:03] uh this is more of a day of an
[48:06] individual Affair and of the great
[48:09] conductor uh taking each individual and
[48:13] giving them the score to play in their
[48:16] life and then when all those different
[48:18] parts come together it's a beautiful
[48:22] picture and and so this this age
[48:27] that uh that we're living in is so
[48:31] cunning deceitful
[48:33] day and have to be more on our toes so
[48:37] we we got to actually filter everything
[48:40] we
[48:42] hear it ought to be a the first question
[48:46] asked about everything is this the word
[48:49] of God is this the will of God because
[48:52] God's will always lines up with his word
[48:56] filter it through the word of God go
[48:59] back to what the messenger said go back
[49:01] to what your scriptures say pray about
[49:03] it ask for Revelation pray for
[49:06] Revelation but it what happens we just
[49:09] start taking things for granted and you
[49:12] know that's you just got to go the extra
[49:15] mile but listen to this this really
[49:16] struck me if uh he said now back in the
[49:20] days of the persecution of
[49:24] Rome to the church a Christian make a
[49:29] mistake he went into the arena and was
[49:32] fed to the Lions or something like that
[49:36] when they found him of being a Christian
[49:41] for his testimony but his soul was saved
[49:45] because he he was
[49:48] purely unadulterated believer in God and
[49:52] gladly
[49:54] sealed sealed his testimony with his
[49:58] blood so it didn't matter he might have
[50:00] made lots of mistakes but when it came
[50:03] down to denying the faith he gladly
[50:06] sealed his testimony with his blood and
[50:09] that was attributed to him for
[50:12] salvation you know and and so the
[50:15] Catholic church has always perpetuated
[50:18] that all down Through the Ages the
[50:20] greatest thing you could be is be a
[50:22] martyr you know die for the faith die
[50:25] for the faith die for the faith
[50:27] well what good is it do you to die to
[50:29] the faith if you're not living the
[50:32] faith but that was the time that they
[50:34] lived in he
[50:37] said and and as the veins let loose and
[50:42] the holes in his body and the bleeding
[50:45] blood bled out he would scream up from
[50:48] with a real loyal faithful and say
[50:51] receive my spirit Lord Jesus but now
[50:58] now that's what we have to understand so
[51:00] we're looking what's God looking at us
[51:02] what's what's he trying to place us what
[51:05] really is the fight we're not in the
[51:07] fight against the Lions we're not in the
[51:10] fight against the uh the Our
[51:15] Testimony everybody's a
[51:18] Christian
[51:20] now so he said but now the cunn of the
[51:24] devil now makes the people believe that
[51:28] they are Christians when they're
[51:35] not
[51:37] now don't get in the idea that because
[51:40] we believe the message it's always out
[51:45] there you know oh that's them that's
[51:49] them that's you guys that's there no
[51:53] this is speak when when this was
[51:55] preached there wasn't churches like we
[51:58] had today there wasn't quote unquote
[52:00] messages these were people from every
[52:03] denomination they were still going to
[52:05] church they were still in they a few of
[52:07] them would come to the Tabernacle when
[52:10] brother Brandon would preach a meeting
[52:12] they would come into the meetings
[52:14] brother Bram was going around bringing
[52:16] his message but there was no group of
[52:18] people that had gathered together around
[52:21] this message and had a a understanding
[52:25] that that he just wasn't was n a prophet
[52:27] in the form of a five-fold Ministry
[52:30] Prophet but he was a
[52:32] messenger revealing the Mysteries so you
[52:36] just can't sit in here and say oh yeah
[52:38] that's everybody else no I've got to
[52:41] take that and say wait a minute is Satan
[52:45] making me feel like I'm a Christian when
[52:47] I'm
[52:49] not how do I judge that how do I measure
[52:53] that how do I determine that how do I
[52:57] determine whether something's
[52:59] counterfit or
[53:01] not and you know back just for the
[53:04] example of my con I found out that the
[53:07] only way you can keep away from that if
[53:08] you buy the certified package sealed
[53:12] coin in in the proper container you know
[53:17] and and that's the safest and best way
[53:21] not to make sure that you're getting
[53:25] deceived and and that I think that's a
[53:27] good thing for us we want to take a
[53:30] Vindicated word not an intellectual word
[53:34] but so he goes on here he
[53:37] say he said the Christian when they're
[53:41] not there's the
[53:44] thing okay there's the thing so you you
[53:48] talk to yourself so what is it there's
[53:50] the thing that's what he do he makes you
[53:52] feel that everything's all right and
[53:55] when you think everything's all all
[53:56] right you quit examining it you know
[53:59] that they have something called uh I
[54:01] think it's called P&M periodical
[54:04] maintenance that if you you just you got
[54:06] to go down and check the grease you you
[54:08] just can't think oh this is just running
[54:10] everything's fine it's just going to
[54:12] keep going no you better you better
[54:14] check it you better make sure it's
[54:15] working you better look at the sockets
[54:17] the sprockets the the press the pumps
[54:20] the Hydraulics you got to you got to sit
[54:22] back and look at it and make sure it's
[54:24] running that's why on your cars you know
[54:26] they they they're going to give you a
[54:28] warranty out here I bought a a 100,000
[54:31] mile yeah missing oil
[54:35] change
[54:37] bye that ain't no good no more you know
[54:41] mare
[54:42] $30,000 thing yeah you go on there I'm
[54:45] here for my $30,000 checkup and they go
[54:49] back to your car we just completed your
[54:50] $330,000 checkup that would be
[54:54] $1,200 and then you go for your
[54:57] 60,000 and they want to replace your
[54:59] timing belt you know and do all this
[55:01] that's another 20,000 you
[55:04] know but if you don't everything's
[55:07] void and God's got a warranty and his
[55:11] warranty is I'll keep my word that's his
[55:14] warranty but you've got to pursue it
[55:17] according to his word you can't take
[55:20] something that's out of context you
[55:23] can't something that's not interpreted
[55:26] right and present it to God as something
[55:29] that he's got to warranty and that's why
[55:32] so many people are feel that God fails
[55:35] them they they they they feel that
[55:38] they're not moving in their lives
[55:40] because they're taking their own idea
[55:43] and they're presenting it to God as God
[55:46] you said you would warranty this God
[55:48] will only warranty what he said
[55:51] sir and it's got to be in the spirit
[55:54] that he said it it's got to be in the
[55:56] season that he said it it's got to be in
[55:58] the right time the right place it's all
[56:00] the five must have got to be there and
[56:04] you know we're about the only generation
[56:05] of people has had anybody ever explained
[56:07] to them that God's word's got five
[56:12] musts and then we want promises to come
[56:15] to pass in our lives we want to see God
[56:18] move but we don't want to move according
[56:20] to the way God wants us to
[56:23] move it's because we've had so much
[56:25] influence
[56:26] so many other voices it's such a cunning
[56:31] day you know we just feel that if we we
[56:34] do something that we don't feel like
[56:36] wait a minute I I really need to measure
[56:39] this I need to find out that if I've got
[56:42] this in its right
[56:43] spot you
[56:46] know I've seen people just hang on to
[56:48] promises and I never even thought the
[56:51] promises applied that way and then look
[56:53] go around and sit down with them and and
[56:56] and take a little time and then go back
[56:58] and find a much simpler promise that fit
[57:02] their
[57:04] situation and oh it's so simple it's
[57:08] always
[57:09] simple it's always simple so we're we're
[57:12] we're we're talking just don't don't
[57:14] lose me this evening what my point is my
[57:17] point is is what
[57:19] challenge are we meeting for this
[57:23] age okay and uh so we just wanted to
[57:26] stay on that thought a little bit he
[57:29] says he
[57:33] said he said it's so cunning the devil
[57:38] has
[57:40] said it so
[57:42] cunning it's a more cunning day that it
[57:46] would be than when you ever had to seal
[57:49] your life away with your testimony the
[57:53] devil has set every cunning trap that he
[57:56] can to he's a deceiver and Jesus told us
[58:00] in Matthew 24 now this day would be that
[58:05] we're living in the most deceitful day
[58:08] that ever lived so close that it would
[58:11] deceive the very elect of God if it were
[58:15] possible for him to
[58:18] deceive so we we sit back and and we we
[58:22] realize that that we can we can go all
[58:26] the way back to what we talked about
[58:28] this morning that when when Eve was
[58:32] given the word of God and Satan showed
[58:36] up and started drawing another picture
[58:40] surely you won't die surely you'll grow
[58:43] surely you'll go in wisdom sure surely
[58:46] you'll go he's always he always takes
[58:49] the word of God and misconstrues
[58:53] it right so we're we're sitting back so
[58:56] what's our
[58:58] challenge our challenge is to be able to
[59:02] discern the word of
[59:06] God now this is this is quite a
[59:09] statement that I'm going to read here in
[59:11] a moment let's just let's just uh read
[59:16] it he
[59:19] says and this is paragraph 23 he says
[59:22] look back here in my text tonight
[59:26] Satan was the one that preached the word
[59:31] to Eve
[59:37] first God hath
[59:40] said he walks up he preaches the word
[59:43] God said this God said
[59:46] that you know well wait a minute is
[59:49] there a hook in there you know where's
[59:52] he where's where's this going where
[59:55] where you you know what what's what's it
[59:57] pointing to what's the point of it you
[1:00:01] know and if if and the thing about it is
[1:00:04] is God's his own
[1:00:06] interpreter so you don't need someone to
[1:00:08] explain it to you go back and take this
[1:00:11] tape read it go through it paragraph by
[1:00:14] paragraph and you'll find out this is
[1:00:16] exactly what he's saying God's got a
[1:00:18] true Vindicated word and you've got
[1:00:20] Satan preaching another gospel right
[1:00:23] alongside of this one and he appears as
[1:00:27] an angel of Light and he's cunning and
[1:00:30] he's smart and he's sharp and he's
[1:00:33] deceitful so you know what God's looking
[1:00:36] from his children from the Eve that we
[1:00:38] are is they he is looking for someone
[1:00:42] that when they hear that cunning voice
[1:00:44] they say
[1:00:46] no he said the eat the day I eat thereof
[1:00:49] I'll die he said oh surely you won't die
[1:00:53] wait a minute he said I'd Die I Die end
[1:00:57] the story that simple I'm not going to
[1:01:01] listen I'm not going to argue I'm not
[1:01:04] getting a discussion with you I I'm not
[1:01:07] going to try to uh uh straighten you out
[1:01:11] and I'm not going to try to make it work
[1:01:15] okay you it's like some you got to give
[1:01:17] me more than that's like when somebody's
[1:01:18] trying to sell you something you know
[1:01:21] you got you got to give me more than
[1:01:23] that and then they'll come up with the
[1:01:26] next lie and the next
[1:01:28] lie and pretty soon you're saying I just
[1:01:31] bought a bag of fertilizer I was like I
[1:01:33] just throw it in the backyard and a
[1:01:34] whole Garden's going to spring
[1:01:37] up this is the greatest stuff in the
[1:01:39] world Propet God talked about the dishes
[1:01:41] he ran home and got the dish soap you
[1:01:43] know and he saw it on the commercial he
[1:01:45] just dropped the dish in there and you
[1:01:47] squirted the soap anybody remember that
[1:01:50] commercial B old and and boy the soap
[1:01:53] went went down you could see it go down
[1:01:56] the water and then the dishes would just
[1:01:58] the dirt would just start coming off of
[1:02:00] the dishes floating up and then the
[1:02:02] person reached in the water and pulled
[1:02:04] out this sparkling
[1:02:06] clean
[1:02:07] thing no scrubbing no nothing so he went
[1:02:12] bought he wanted to try some of that
[1:02:13] stuff so he walks in and says sister
[1:02:16] I'll do the dishes today don't worry
[1:02:17] honey I got it and he put him in the pan
[1:02:20] shot that stuff in there and walked in
[1:02:23] there and sat down she said wait I
[1:02:24] thought you said you go don't
[1:02:27] worry they're they're just fine you know
[1:02:30] he goes back in there and he's got a
[1:02:31] sink full of dirty
[1:02:35] dishes and you know what bothered them
[1:02:37] the most was that they got away with
[1:02:40] selling that kind of
[1:02:44] stuff you know and you know the great
[1:02:47] sermon thinking men's filter you know
[1:02:50] the lie that oh this has got a filter on
[1:02:53] it you you know what I mean he he said
[1:02:56] nobody's thinking that
[1:02:58] smokes that's for sure and so it's the
[1:03:02] most deceitful day is possible now so we
[1:03:05] said that Satan was the first one to
[1:03:07] preach so the very first thing Satan
[1:03:10] started doing was what
[1:03:12] misconstruing the word of God so he said
[1:03:16] this that it's that
[1:03:19] misconstruing that part of the scripture
[1:03:22] that applies to the day he'll let you
[1:03:25] know know all Jesus did was perfectly
[1:03:30] well he'll let you know all that Moses
[1:03:34] did was perfectly well but when you take
[1:03:37] the promises that they gave for this day
[1:03:43] and then was applied to and then that
[1:03:48] was applied to another age that's just
[1:03:52] all he has to do see is to get the
[1:03:56] people to believe it that way and that's
[1:04:02] all all you got to get the people to
[1:04:04] believe was that's for another age
[1:04:07] that's for another time that that that
[1:04:11] oh that's let me misconstrue it just a
[1:04:15] little bit and and here what brother Ram
[1:04:17] was trying to get to us so many times
[1:04:20] and he preached it over and over again
[1:04:23] the word says exactly what it
[1:04:26] says it doesn't need any
[1:04:30] interpretation it wasn't given to be
[1:04:33] understood it was given to be
[1:04:37] believed and it's given in such a way
[1:04:41] that only the elected believer can take
[1:04:45] it the way that it's
[1:04:49] given so that sets you off to be an
[1:04:52] oddball already because you're hearing
[1:04:55] something oh they someone said you
[1:04:57] explain that to
[1:04:58] me I just believe
[1:05:02] it like the man said he said well I
[1:05:05] don't believe that he said that's
[1:05:06] because you're an unbeliever you don't
[1:05:08] have anything in you to believe it
[1:05:12] with if you're a Healer go down and
[1:05:15] empty the hospital that's not the way it
[1:05:19] works that's not the way it works we
[1:05:21] think we prove God by challenging God by
[1:05:25] commanding
[1:05:27] God I had a man enrolled me in the Full
[1:05:29] Gospel
[1:05:30] businessman I I think I'm a member I
[1:05:33] don't know if you can get off it or not
[1:05:34] but anyway so I I found out I was a Full
[1:05:38] Gospel so I got invited out to dinner I
[1:05:40] think lesie was with me and
[1:05:43] and so we go we think we're going out to
[1:05:46] dinner well we are going out to dinner
[1:05:49] but we're going to a Full Gospel
[1:05:50] businessman's dinner so we get in there
[1:05:53] and we're sitting there and and and
[1:05:57] uh uh I'll just be honest with you so
[1:06:01] they have a visiting Minister and he's a
[1:06:03] spiritual
[1:06:05] chiropractor this like absolutely the
[1:06:08] truth I I want you to understand the
[1:06:11] kind of things people are buying into
[1:06:13] kitster come here I need to use you
[1:06:19] here my little Deacon buddies okay so
[1:06:23] this guy would walk up to the people
[1:06:25] this is going on in
[1:06:27] church you understand with
[1:06:31] hundreds of businessman
[1:06:35] Believers and they're buying
[1:06:38] this you know some people will believe a
[1:06:42] lie when the truth sounds
[1:06:44] better and he's going up and down their
[1:06:49] back he's doing spiritual chiropr he
[1:06:52] says oh I feel this little this is a
[1:06:54] this is the spirit of such and
[1:06:59] such I I just made a spiritual
[1:07:04] adjustment have you ever tried to make a
[1:07:07] spiritual adjustment in your
[1:07:09] life I'll guarantee in as simple as
[1:07:12] someone pressing on your back thinking
[1:07:14] they found a spirit and then spiritually
[1:07:17] adjusting
[1:07:18] you and then he goes down o ooh
[1:07:23] kitster I I see a little bit of a
[1:07:26] a little bit of sometimes you get mad at
[1:07:28] your
[1:07:31] sister she she gave me a $10 offering
[1:07:34] telling me you needed a spiritual
[1:07:36] adjustment on
[1:07:38] that now you're adjusted now your
[1:07:41] sister's just the sweetest thing you've
[1:07:43] ever met in your life and you'd do
[1:07:45] anything for her and you'd stay out of
[1:07:46] her room right and this is actually
[1:07:50] going
[1:07:52] on well there's stuff that's going on
[1:07:54] right in our that has no basis in the
[1:07:57] word of God at all that's that's
[1:08:02] right I appreciate it brother Danny just
[1:08:05] bringing a lot of it out everybody
[1:08:08] getting in this spirit that they want a
[1:08:10] word spoken
[1:08:11] over I don't want any word spoken over
[1:08:14] me other than the word that William
[1:08:16] brandham spoke over
[1:08:20] me how do I need prophecy if I've got a
[1:08:24] pre-planned life
[1:08:27] see those were all the questions that
[1:08:30] were left
[1:08:33] uncovered in
[1:08:35] this puzzle of Satan's
[1:08:38] Eden so they had to inject all kinds of
[1:08:41] stuff to get stuff fixed because they
[1:08:45] couldn't put the scriptures together
[1:08:47] because the keys were missing but when
[1:08:49] the seals were open it became a new book
[1:08:53] and we saw it right before this is never
[1:08:55] what God was after he was never after a
[1:08:58] church that was full of power he was
[1:09:00] after a church that was full of
[1:09:03] obedience that's what he
[1:09:06] wanted he didn't need great stylish
[1:09:10] preachers he needed preachers that would
[1:09:12] tell the truth from their place of
[1:09:22] experience and that's what that's what
[1:09:26] that was what Paul even said oh we got
[1:09:28] many teachers but we don't have many
[1:09:30] fathers we don't have many
[1:09:32] Elders you know and so uh this this
[1:09:36] great kindness that he's got this great
[1:09:40] misconstruing of the word of God now
[1:09:42] they'll go back to everything Moses is
[1:09:44] perfect Everything Jesus say perfect but
[1:09:46] when it comes down to now for you moving
[1:09:50] into a place where you can be that word
[1:09:55] oh well that's that's not for
[1:09:59] you you know nobody you can't be number
[1:10:03] one if everybody's number
[1:10:07] one you can't be the big
[1:10:10] eye you know what I mean unless there's
[1:10:13] little
[1:10:14] use there's no lad in this we're just
[1:10:18] going to continue reading we'll get done
[1:10:20] here in just a moment and I want you to
[1:10:22] follow this thought through because he's
[1:10:25] tell telling us something here and we've
[1:10:28] we've and I don't know whether it's I
[1:10:31] that this is just the time that we've
[1:10:33] got to come to the
[1:10:35] consciousness of where we are you
[1:10:39] understand that we've assembled
[1:10:41] ourselves we've got together we've
[1:10:44] complimented one another we've patted
[1:10:46] one another on the back and we all agree
[1:10:48] that we're
[1:10:50] it sounds like hide and seek and that's
[1:10:53] exactly what's what's going on you know
[1:10:56] everybody's hiding and seeking hiding
[1:10:58] what they're really going on in their
[1:11:00] life hiding all their
[1:11:02] secrets you know what I mean and and and
[1:11:05] and the the depth of personal
[1:11:11] honesty is what the church needs more
[1:11:15] than
[1:11:16] ever and you know why because he's not
[1:11:19] against you he's for you if you got a
[1:11:23] problem he already knows it all he's do
[1:11:26] is waiting for you to come to him for
[1:11:28] help yes and he promised he wouldn't
[1:11:31] turn you away he would no wise turn you
[1:11:36] away you know if you find yourself on
[1:11:39] the wrong road you find yourself in a
[1:11:41] trap you know don't be
[1:11:44] ashamed that's the Zeal of this
[1:11:49] age to say I'm wrong I'm sorry I taught
[1:11:54] something that wasn't right I believed
[1:11:56] something that right right I did
[1:11:58] something that wasn't in his will you
[1:12:01] know I I I I got carried away that
[1:12:04] that's what he's looking for he's just
[1:12:06] looking for real genuine Christian
[1:12:08] honesty someone that wants to line their
[1:12:11] lives up with the word of
[1:12:14] God
[1:12:16] and and but that's just not very
[1:12:23] popular you know it's it's
[1:12:26] it it's just you know that I just get
[1:12:29] Satan is just like he said he's so
[1:12:31] cunning he lets people believe they have
[1:12:33] the Holy Spirit if they speak in
[1:12:35] tongues or you got it well what happened
[1:12:39] was all the people that had it weren't
[1:12:41] living like they had it so now they came
[1:12:44] up with another Doctrine whatever state
[1:12:46] you die in is the state you're going in
[1:12:51] you mean so I can be a Christian for 45
[1:12:54] years have one day of downfall and if
[1:12:56] that's the state I die in I'm out of
[1:12:57] here forget it I'm going to live like a
[1:13:00] devil till the day I think I'm going to
[1:13:02] die and I'm going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:04] that
[1:13:06] day I mean you but you know that's
[1:13:08] exactly how they would think that ain't
[1:13:11] a love affair that isn't having a God in
[1:13:14] your life that's trying to weasle your
[1:13:16] way into
[1:13:17] heaven that's not what this is about
[1:13:20] it's about a real true understanding
[1:13:23] that I'm a son and daughter of God God
[1:13:25] I've been chosen I've been elected I've
[1:13:28] been set aside you know he he's done all
[1:13:31] this for me he's trying to he's trying
[1:13:33] to find my place in in his eternal plan
[1:13:37] that he had for me I'm not a part of
[1:13:40] this world I'm in it but I'm not of it
[1:13:44] and he goes on here he says let's just
[1:13:46] follow him through we'll try to close
[1:13:49] up he
[1:13:51] said that'll apply to another age that's
[1:13:53] just all he has to do is to get the
[1:13:56] people to believe it that way and that's
[1:13:59] all you cannot take one word away from
[1:14:03] it or add one word to it but that's what
[1:14:08] he
[1:14:10] does I don't know if we're as bad of
[1:14:13] taking away as as we are adding
[1:14:19] to we do it all the time we take part of
[1:14:22] a quote and part of another quote and we
[1:14:24] make a new quote out of
[1:14:27] it or we take an idea from this message
[1:14:30] and an idea from that message and we
[1:14:33] create a new
[1:14:35] message I I I I I just sharing with my
[1:14:39] heart with you tonight uh you know we
[1:14:42] don't have as many people here but it
[1:14:46] the the truth of the
[1:14:47] matter I I like if I read a a text I
[1:14:51] like to stay in the
[1:14:52] text if you're going to read a message
[1:14:55] read
[1:14:57] it you know don't Don't just run to the
[1:14:59] computer and pull out this quote and run
[1:15:02] over here and pull out that quote and
[1:15:05] then all of a sudden you got all these
[1:15:06] quotes now you're going to put them
[1:15:08] together for the
[1:15:12] people and then you find out that that's
[1:15:16] good for the
[1:15:17] sermon that's good for the service it's
[1:15:20] good for the excitement it's good for
[1:15:22] the inspiration it's good to have have
[1:15:25] everybody stand and Shout that's all
[1:15:27] good but it doesn't work in your
[1:15:29] everyday life all of a sudden you you
[1:15:33] you walk out you've got you're you're on
[1:15:35] fire you've got all kinds of good
[1:15:38] intentions but you don't have no
[1:15:40] substance that'll stick you to the
[1:15:47] ground you know and that that what we
[1:15:49] become we become so spiritual that we're
[1:15:51] of no earthly value and that's not what
[1:15:55] God's looking at now more than ever he's
[1:15:58] looking at real genuine daily lived hour
[1:16:02] byour lives with the right atmosphere
[1:16:05] the right Spirit the right nature the
[1:16:08] right approach loving people that they
[1:16:10] come in contact
[1:16:14] with I had somebody send out a a a a
[1:16:18] message to I I don't know what text

[1:16:26] followers um is it Facebook that you

[1:17:22] what they feel they are this is what
[1:17:24] what they want they didn't want to
[1:17:25] conform with the world they don't want
[1:17:27] to look like everybody else they want to
[1:17:29] be what they are they want to stand out
[1:17:31] for what they stand for they're going to
[1:17:33] put on the armor that they have that
[1:17:35] that's what I am and I'm out of the
[1:17:38] closet and I'm here to tell you that
[1:17:40] this is what I am this is what I believe

[1:17:51] closet and be the Christians in the
[1:17:54] uncompromising iing principles to the
[1:17:56] word of God sure there's a contrast
[1:17:58] there's a big contrast that's the
[1:18:00] trouble with the church today it's luk
[1:18:02] warm I would that you either be hot or
[1:18:05] cold but if you're lukewarm I'll spill
[1:18:07] you out of your mouth you got no problem
[1:18:09] with where that sister

[1:18:25] all that I didn't even know they played
[1:18:26] today you know and to me they're just
[1:18:28] what they've always been a bunch of
[1:18:31] losers but I I just couldn't just
[1:18:35] couldn't stand Jimmy Johnson then one
[1:18:37] day I heard Jimmy Johnson make a
[1:18:38] statement he said I gave my whole life
[1:18:42] up for
[1:18:44] football from that day I like that
[1:18:48] guy he admitted I sold my soul to
[1:18:52] football Hallelujah if that's what you
[1:18:54] do I think that's good I think you ought
[1:18:56] to sell
[1:18:57] out that's right that's what the in the
[1:19:00] first church when ananas and surviv come
[1:19:03] up what didn't they do they didn't sell
[1:19:05] out Peter said why do you try to deceive
[1:19:07] the holy ghost acting like you're sold
[1:19:10] out when you're
[1:19:13] not got a little Reserve going on got a
[1:19:17] little private life going on got a
[1:19:19] little this going on a little that
[1:19:20] little fingers and this fingers and that
[1:19:23] you know what I mean got all all your
[1:19:25] little tentacles out you know in the
[1:19:28] church and got this person doing this
[1:19:31] for you and that person doing that for
[1:19:32] you and and if you're all webbed in here

[1:19:38] nothing you can hide it from me but
[1:19:41] you're not hiding it from the one that
[1:19:47] matters but that's the hour that we're
[1:19:51] in and he goes on he says you can't take
[1:19:54] one word away from my said now listen
[1:19:57] this people ignorantly worship Satan
[1:20:00] thinking that they're worshiping God as
[1:20:03] we are warned by the prophecy in 2
[1:20:08] Thessalonians that let us just read that
[1:20:10] second Thessalonians 7 chapter let us
[1:20:13] just get in a moment if I can right away
[1:20:17] I'd like to read that just believe
[1:20:20] second Thessalonians I got the scripture
[1:20:22] here in second now we beseech you
[1:20:26] Brethren by the coming of the Lord
[1:20:29] Jesus and by the Gathering Together unto
[1:20:35] him now see the coming of the Lord and
[1:20:41] the Gathering to him as God will gather
[1:20:45] his people to him in the last days the
[1:20:49] Gathering of the people to the Lord not
[1:20:53] to the church
[1:20:55] Church to the Lord Gathering Together
[1:20:59] unto
[1:21:01] him boy we've got more Church Gathering
[1:21:04] than we have people Gathering to him
[1:21:08] this is where he wants us to gather
[1:21:10] gather to
[1:21:11] him Lord where's my part where's my
[1:21:15] peace where's my place what would you
[1:21:17] have me to
[1:21:20] do but it's easy We Gather to the church
[1:21:23] and we have the our attitude is we're in
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:29] message well I thank God for everybody
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:34] believes this message and that
[1:21:36] identifies thems with the pillar of fire
[1:21:40] I I I I think that's
[1:21:43] admirable but don't stop
[1:21:46] there stop until it BEC so genuine to
[1:21:49] you so personal to you
[1:21:56] and you got to know for
[1:21:58] yourself I'm telling a lot of stories
[1:22:01] but that's okay there's a fellow we knew
[1:22:04] that he identified with the message he'd
[1:22:06] come to church and and and everybody
[1:22:09] called him brother and everybody
[1:22:11] accepted them in the message and so one
[1:22:13] night we had a a little get together and
[1:22:17] everybody this brother this brother and
[1:22:19] just a great brother and and face value
[1:22:23] just suck him as a brother brother well
[1:22:26] you know he got in with all the brothers
[1:22:27] and they were all sitting in the front
[1:22:29] room 15 of them and and the good brother
[1:22:32] well I knew the brother so I just
[1:22:33] thought you know what everybody's just
[1:22:36] so willing to accept him and not ask any
[1:22:40] question not even think nothing I'm just
[1:22:42] going to let him talk so he got in there
[1:22:45] with all the ver and then be started
[1:22:47] explaining to him the day the Martians
[1:22:49] came
[1:22:50] down and he got in the spaceship
[1:22:54] and he went up in the spaceship and he
[1:22:57] started explaining to him about the
[1:22:59] controls and about the Martians and than
[1:23:02] how that they were uh amongst us right
[1:23:06] now and and that was really what the
[1:23:09] Antichrist Spirit was it was Martian
[1:23:11] spirits
[1:23:12] and you
[1:23:15] know and all you had to do is give him a
[1:23:17] little bit of
[1:23:19] rope you know it's just like that guy
[1:23:21] that was at the Corral I'm a preacher
[1:23:25] I got the gospel I can preach yet let
[1:23:29] him get a rope but when that real Bronco
[1:23:31] shows
[1:23:31] up he said now you want you a rider he
[1:23:35] said no I don't think I'm a
[1:23:37] rider you know he wore that old horse
[1:23:40] out that old plow meal went out west
[1:23:42] right moved out west and now he got to
[1:23:45] the Corral and I'm a rider boy all of a
[1:23:48] sudden he found out he wasn't a rider
[1:23:50] cuz you know what the enemy is always a
[1:23:53] lot bigger than you think he
[1:23:56] is he's more decept more cunning more
[1:24:00] deceitful he sets traps he does
[1:24:05] everything I mean he he is
[1:24:10] absolutely we ought to be in the fear of
[1:24:13] God with what we're dealing with in this
[1:24:16] age and that's what God's looking for
[1:24:19] he's looking for a people that are going
[1:24:21] to pull right up to his word that's
[1:24:24] going to saap what he says that are
[1:24:26] going to gathered unto
[1:24:29] him not the church not here to be taught
[1:24:32] not here to hear this shouldn't be the
[1:24:34] only place you hear the
[1:24:37] message you shouldn't be receiving your
[1:24:40] inspiration from this Pulpit Only We
[1:24:44] Gather here together to stir up our Pure
[1:24:47] Minds by way of remembrance and to bring
[1:24:51] to you remembrance of what the prophet
[1:24:53] said the things that he said to do the
[1:24:56] the things you got to look for in your
[1:24:57] life but when it comes back down to it
[1:25:00] comes to an
[1:25:01] individual a walk with him and you've
[1:25:04] got to set your course in the revealed
[1:25:07] word of the hour that's got to be your
[1:25:10] molder and there's no man that could
[1:25:12] come in this pulpit and preach you this
[1:25:14] whole message in an hour
[1:25:18] sermon or longer if he's the
[1:25:21] pastor you can't do it
[1:25:25] you know what I mean this can't be your
[1:25:27] only contact in other words he didn't
[1:25:29] gather you under the
[1:25:30] church if the church could do
[1:25:34] it he would have said it he would have
[1:25:37] told us if it were so I would have told
[1:25:40] you so it's not so so if God's looking
[1:25:44] at us tonight he's looking at you
[1:25:47] looking at your own life judging your
[1:25:49] own life looking in the Yum Thunder of
[1:25:52] the word in your life and you lining
[1:25:55] your own life
[1:25:57] up that's what's so important to him and
[1:26:00] that's the age and time that's what's
[1:26:03] God's looking for not what you can let
[1:26:06] anybody else
[1:26:08] know because as far as I'm concerned
[1:26:11] every one of you's going in the
[1:26:13] Rapture every one of you met the
[1:26:16] requirements every one of you has a
[1:26:20] Halo on your head every one of you is
[1:26:24] trying to serve god with your whole
[1:26:26] heart you're the only one that knows
[1:26:29] what you got in your back
[1:26:33] pocket and that's what God's looking for
[1:26:36] you to deal with your own personal fears
[1:26:39] your personal doubts your personal
[1:26:42] problems if I can help you I'd be happy
[1:26:44] to try to go through the word of God
[1:26:46] with you and do whatever I can for you
[1:26:49] but the
[1:26:51] ultimate choice is the choice of your
[1:26:54] heart and that's what God's looking on
[1:26:58] where do you stand for me as an
[1:27:00] individual and he just longs to see that
[1:27:04] just manifested in your
[1:27:08] life and it and and that's hard when all
[1:27:11] of a sudden it's not a group
[1:27:14] Affair you know and sometimes you have
[1:27:17] to go against the
[1:27:19] grain but you know in your heart you're
[1:27:22] steadfast with the word of God God and
[1:27:25] we'll just and he says not the church
[1:27:27] but the Lord Gathering Together unto him
[1:27:31] that that ye be soon that you be not
[1:27:34] soon shakened in your mind troubled
[1:27:38] neither by Spirit nor by word nor by
[1:27:42] letter from us as the day of the Lord is
[1:27:45] at
[1:27:46] hand he says let no man deceive you by
[1:27:50] any means for that day shall not come
[1:27:54] except there come a falling away first
[1:27:57] and the man of of sin the man of sin
[1:28:01] which is what he is now the man of sin
[1:28:04] be revealed the son of
[1:28:06] predition what that's what Judas is see
[1:28:10] who opposes and exalts himself above all
[1:28:14] that is called God and that the
[1:28:16] worshipper that is worshiped so that as
[1:28:20] God sth in the temple of God he showeth
[1:28:23] himself self that he is God the
[1:28:28] deceitfulness of the Church of today the
[1:28:31] son of predition the devil the son of
[1:28:34] predition the devil then people worship
[1:28:37] Satan in this day thinking they're
[1:28:40] worshiping God but they're worshiping
[1:28:43] him through a Creed man-made
[1:28:46] denominations Creeds that's brought the
[1:28:48] people right down to the greatest
[1:28:51] deception that the world has ever ever
[1:28:54] known of no matter how much the word of
[1:28:57] God promises for this day it's preached
[1:29:00] and Vindicated they still won't believe
[1:29:03] it they won't believe it why we wonder
[1:29:06] why why doesn't it why wouldn't they
[1:29:11] believe it when God said he would do a
[1:29:14] certain thing and he does it and they
[1:29:17] still turn their back from it and turn
[1:29:21] away from it as just as even knew that
[1:29:25] what God Said God would do but she
[1:29:29] turned her back on it to listen to what
[1:29:33] he had to
[1:29:38] say oh you know what he is looking he's
[1:29:41] looking for people that don't
[1:29:45] listen to what he has to
[1:29:49] say no matter what it is and
[1:29:55] and and then he goes it's been now Satan
[1:29:57] establishes his kingdom in the earth
[1:30:00] exactly what he's doing if he wants to
[1:30:03] establish his own kingdom and which we
[1:30:06] talked about this morning and then we'll
[1:30:08] just close just with a couple statements
[1:30:10] maybe five more minutes he
[1:30:15] said and and this is the way it
[1:30:19] was and he says so God knew that we
[1:30:22] would be here and this is paragraph
[1:30:25] 54 he said uh he knew that we'd be here
[1:30:30] and uh he wanted to uh be here he put us
[1:30:35] in flesh so we would be contacted in
[1:30:38] order he could contact us he could
[1:30:40] become one of us when he become Jesus
[1:30:43] Christ the son of God himself fell the
[1:30:46] fullness of the manifestation of God
[1:30:48] therefore that was God's purpose is to
[1:30:51] display his attributes in Fellowship
[1:30:54] and then 56 he says and as the children
[1:30:58] of God were a part of go God's
[1:31:01] attributes that was in him made flesh
[1:31:06] like he was made flesh so we can have
[1:31:09] Fellowship one with another as a family
[1:31:13] of God upon the Earth and that was God's
[1:31:17] purpose at the beginning that was what
[1:31:20] he wanted at the beginning so at the
[1:31:23] beginning he he wanted a
[1:31:25] family you understand and he it wasn't
[1:31:29] that he wasn't drawing people to the
[1:31:32] church he wanted them to be a family so
[1:31:36] he didn't want us just to be a church
[1:31:39] family and other words we come together
[1:31:41] as a church we meet here as a church we
[1:31:44] do things as a church no he wanted you
[1:31:47] to have a Christian family life and
[1:31:49] fellowship with the brothers and sisters
[1:31:52] in your life
[1:31:54] he they'll know that you are my
[1:31:56] disciples as your love one for another
[1:31:59] you just don't want to hide your life in
[1:32:02] church you understand you want to you
[1:32:04] want to let what you are reach out and
[1:32:08] reach out to the Lost reach out to the
[1:32:10] lonely reach out to the Brokenhearted
[1:32:13] reach out to those that are in need
[1:32:15] there a Consciousness and awareness of
[1:32:18] that you're a part of a family and not
[1:32:20] part of a church
[1:32:24] and boy I really feel with all my heart
[1:32:26] that's really something we've got to
[1:32:30] really become more of aware of of the
[1:32:34] part that we are in a body and what we
[1:32:37] play one to
[1:32:39] another and that's why the prophet of
[1:32:41] God was so opposed to
[1:32:44] clicks little groups in the framework of
[1:32:48] the
[1:32:49] church and and and circles and you got
[1:32:53] to you've got to do this in yourself
[1:32:55] this is what God's looking at so you say
[1:32:58] well is God looking at me
[1:33:01] yes what's he looking to see what's he
[1:33:04] looking to find he's looking to see you
[1:33:06] obeying his word he's looking to see you
[1:33:09] draw a bigger Circle he's looking to see
[1:33:13] you to take care of the family of God
[1:33:16] we've almost preached it like God's
[1:33:18] looking for us to understand all the
[1:33:20] Mysteries
[1:33:24] that's what he's looking for he's
[1:33:25] looking for you to get the message get
[1:33:27] the Mysteries get the teachings get the
[1:33:29] doctrine this is what you oh you I'm a
[1:33:31] Son of God I believe all the word you
[1:33:35] know the word the word the word I've
[1:33:37] heard people say the word the word the
[1:33:38] word so much it brings me to the place I
[1:33:41] don't even think they know what the word
[1:33:44] is the word is not a word it is a
[1:33:49] person the word is that person's
[1:33:52] thoughts expressed
[1:33:55] he didn't want you to know what he said
[1:33:58] he wanted to know for you to know why he
[1:34:00] said
[1:34:01] it and that only comes with the Capstone
[1:34:05] and the love of God shed abroad in Your
[1:34:07] Heart by the Holy
[1:34:10] Spirit we're missing Paul said it though
[1:34:14] I understand all the Mysteries I speak
[1:34:15] with tongues of men and angels I Lay My
[1:34:18] Hands on the sick and I have not charity
[1:34:21] I am nothing
[1:34:23] I have not love and I don't want us in
[1:34:27] this hour to
[1:34:28] miss really what what we're being
[1:34:32] measured by we're not being measured by
[1:34:35] our knowledge of the seals
[1:34:38] book though I believe that knowledge is
[1:34:41] extremely helpful and I think that all
[1:34:45] of us should have a part of our life
[1:34:47] that we go through the church ages and
[1:34:49] the seals and listening the tapes and
[1:34:52] making contact with the word of God but
[1:34:55] he's really looking for genuine
[1:34:59] Christianity to be on
[1:35:02] display just that daily simple lack of
[1:35:06] frustration lack of anger just the joy
[1:35:10] of the Lord the love of God shed abroad
[1:35:12] in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit just
[1:35:15] that great simple things he
[1:35:18] says he says and that's what he wanted
[1:35:22] that's what he always wanted was just a
[1:35:24] family of
[1:35:26] God and then we know exactly what
[1:35:28] happened you know Satan exalted himself
[1:35:32] he succeeded in putting himself above
[1:35:34] the people he started reigning over the
[1:35:37] people's
[1:35:38] lives and that's kind of been the way
[1:35:41] it's ever since and I just like to close
[1:35:44] with this statement he said and this is
[1:35:48] paragraph 80 and there's so many more I
[1:35:51] could read he said
[1:35:54] what if your father told
[1:35:56] you and you are a loyal son to your
[1:36:00] father and he told you son don't you
[1:36:04] go in that water out there swimming
[1:36:09] because there's Gators in the water and
[1:36:13] the fellow comes back and says
[1:36:16] surely such pretty
[1:36:19] water as that there is no Gators in it
[1:36:24] now who are you going to listen to if
[1:36:27] you're a genuine son you'll listen to
[1:36:30] your
[1:36:33] daddy a genuine son and daughter of God
[1:36:36] takes God's word first I don't care what
[1:36:41] anybody else says about it they take
[1:36:44] God's word first there is poison in the
[1:36:48] cup and they believe it have faith in
[1:36:52] all his work
[1:36:54] his
[1:36:55] seed bought Eden of Holiness
[1:37:00] love and eternal life that's what God's
[1:37:04] Eden produced Holiness and it brought an
[1:37:07] Eden of Holiness of love understanding
[1:37:12] Perfection and eternal life that's what
[1:37:15] God is planting his word his seed that's
[1:37:19] what his church will be at the end it'll
[1:37:22] be the same
[1:37:26] thing so if that's what he planted
[1:37:30] loyalness love I didn't see a lot of
[1:37:33] things listed in
[1:37:36] there that were trying to cultivate in
[1:37:39] the
[1:37:41] church it's
[1:37:43] simple let's keep it simple God said so
[1:37:47] I believe
[1:37:50] it everybody had this Bible
[1:37:54] everybody was coming up with a different
[1:37:58] interpretation God said in this book
[1:38:01] that as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:38:04] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:38:06] man as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:38:11] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:38:14] man behold in the day of the voice of
[1:38:17] the seventh angel behold I have send you
[1:38:22] Elijah the prophet
[1:38:24] and you you those scriptures he shed
[1:38:29] light on those for you and you saw them
[1:38:33] and you saw this messenger this young
[1:38:37] man from uh Kentucky and that the angel
[1:38:42] came to and he told you his life story
[1:38:44] and he told the story but he just didn't
[1:38:46] leave the story there he backed it up he
[1:38:51] discerned the thoughts and intents of
[1:38:53] the heart he re impersonated the same
[1:38:56] vindications that Jesus had the same
[1:38:59] works the same signs and wonders laid it
[1:39:02] out there for us so we perfectly
[1:39:05] know what he
[1:39:08] said to be
[1:39:10] true and now we've got the same cunning
[1:39:15] devil trying to tell us what he said
[1:39:19] what he meant how it's to be interpreted
[1:39:23] and I'll tell you something that God
[1:39:24] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:39:31] pass he it there there is there's there
[1:39:34] should be no Pulpit between the voice
[1:39:38] and the ear of the
[1:39:41] hearer you've got to make sure of that
[1:39:45] for
[1:39:46] yourself God wanted us to assemble
[1:39:48] together he wanted us to Fellowship
[1:39:51] around his word he put five-fold
[1:39:54] Ministry in I believe in all of those
[1:39:57] things and they have their place but
[1:40:00] they don't become the totalitar of what
[1:40:03] that you are as a Believer he's not
[1:40:06] drawing you to the church he's drawing
[1:40:09] you to
[1:40:10] himself and that's what you've got to
[1:40:13] that's what he's looking for he's
[1:40:15] looking for Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:17] that stand up they identify themselves
[1:40:20] in the voice they identify themselves
[1:40:23] who's been leading and they're sticking
[1:40:25] with that word regardless of what
[1:40:27] anybody else says regardless of the
[1:40:30] circumstances that befall them their
[1:40:32] life identifies and they're not ashamed
[1:40:36] to say where they
[1:40:38] stand and I always love this and I'm
[1:40:42] understanding it more than more you
[1:40:44] can't separate the message from the
[1:40:50] messenger because that's the part that
[1:40:55] he's judging you by I've accepted what
[1:40:58] he done as my
[1:41:01] absolute and you've got to make that
[1:41:03] decision for
[1:41:07] yourself people don't want that they
[1:41:10] want to say I'm led by the Holy Spirit
[1:41:13] Well I'm
[1:41:15] follower of the messenger as he was a
[1:41:18] follower of
[1:41:20] Christ I know it's the word because the
[1:41:23] the holy spirit is Jesus was the Holy
[1:41:27] Spirit it's that same person back
[1:41:31] leading Us in spirit form instead of
[1:41:35] Flesh
[1:41:36] form it's not a second person the holy
[1:41:39] spirit is not a person in fact the Holy
[1:41:42] Spirit didn't even come to speak of
[1:41:47] himself we we talk about the baptism of
[1:41:50] the Holy Spirit but what we're talking
[1:41:52] about is the end dwelling Spirit of the
[1:41:55] Lord Jesus the Same nature the same
[1:41:57] attitude the same thing the same
[1:42:01] attributes you don't want anointing and
[1:42:05] that's why he taught us about the
[1:42:07] anointed ones at the end time they have
[1:42:09] the
[1:42:10] anointing but they don't have that
[1:42:13] genuine word
[1:42:16] connection so you say what's God really
[1:42:18] looking at for me in this day the two
[1:42:23] pictures are being
[1:42:24] drawn Satan's sitting on his Eden Throne
[1:42:28] he's the God of this evil age and you're
[1:42:30] a called out people what is it that he's
[1:42:34] looking for what in my life is he
[1:42:37] looking for is he looking for power he
[1:42:41] don't need
[1:42:43] power he's got all the power you'll ever
[1:42:46] need when you need
[1:42:51] it he got us covered he's looking for
[1:42:56] children and that's what he said God's
[1:43:00] children obey his
[1:43:06] word in other words they do what he said
[1:43:10] if he said there's alligators in that
[1:43:12] water you don't go there if he said
[1:43:16] don't fellowship with it you don't
[1:43:18] fellowship with it if he said apply the
[1:43:22] token you apply the
[1:43:24] token boy that's it it I don't know why
[1:43:29] it's so simple but yet it's so
[1:43:33] hard but that's really what he's
[1:43:35] Desiring in this day and that's how
[1:43:38] you'll find your place in the great
[1:43:42] picture is by obedience to the word of
[1:43:45] the Lord will lead you the prophet of
[1:43:48] God said obedience to the word of God
[1:43:51] entitles you to the Holy
[1:43:55] Ghost amen and I I just trust in my own
[1:43:58] simple way because uh you know I I I'll
[1:44:02] be honest you I'm extremely proud of our
[1:44:04] congregation I'm extremely proud of our
[1:44:07] people the love that you have one for
[1:44:10] another so let's stay on point I think
[1:44:14] that's what they say right stay on
[1:44:16] course let's let's keep what's most
[1:44:19] important that we believe this word that
[1:44:23] spoken to us and we're not just
[1:44:25] Believers but we're obey
[1:44:28] years of the word of God let's separate
[1:44:31] ourselves from the world the things of
[1:44:34] the world and watch your your
[1:44:38] strength and your the and the love and
[1:44:42] the fellowship we have in the love
[1:44:44] divine grow and so I just wanted to
[1:44:48] finish off this morning's message with
[1:44:50] that let's stand I hope I wasn't too
[1:44:52] long long this evening but uh a
[1:44:56] wonderful message if you want to take
[1:44:58] the time just to study it out Satan's
[1:45:01] Eden you say where am I living you're
[1:45:04] living in Satan's Eden the God of this
[1:45:07] evil age and he's cunning deceiving and
[1:45:11] he's after
[1:45:12] me but I got a cliff of the rock I got
[1:45:16] the word god couldn't give me anything
[1:45:18] better than his
[1:45:20] word uh the greatest battle ever ever
[1:45:23] fought if God could give you another
[1:45:24] weapon other than his word he would have
[1:45:26] given to him he can give you nothing
[1:45:28] greater than his word his word will get
[1:45:31] you through
[1:45:32] church amen and just let the love of God
[1:45:37] just be so full of your heart let's pray
[1:45:41] our gracious heavenly
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:45:44] father as you told Peter he said stir up
[1:45:47] the People by way of
[1:45:51] remembrance bring into their minds the
[1:45:55] things that we were warned
[1:45:58] of and Lord we're looking at this time
[1:46:02] we're in the condition of our
[1:46:06] country what's going
[1:46:15] on I cannot make sense of it
[1:46:21] Lord but you told me I don't have to
[1:46:24] make sense of it I don't have to
[1:46:27] understand the world or the things of
[1:46:29] the
[1:46:30] world I don't even have to
[1:46:35] listen I just set my heart on
[1:46:38] you I set my heart on what it is that
[1:46:41] you're
[1:46:42] speaking I set my heart on the message
[1:46:45] that you have
[1:46:47] given Lord and that becomes my source
[1:46:53] of
[1:46:54] information it becomes my source of
[1:46:58] leadership I see you standing in every
[1:47:01] word that you
[1:47:04] spoke I see you in every scripture and
[1:47:07] if I don't I go back and read it
[1:47:10] again because you're drawing your
[1:47:13] church unto

[1:47:25] us you have a place for each of us in
[1:47:28] your great
[1:47:30] plan and you told us nobody can take our
[1:47:33] place nobody can fulfill the great
[1:47:37] picture the great puzzle you're putting
[1:47:40] together with all your
[1:47:43] Believers and if there's one piece
[1:47:46] missing the picture is not
[1:47:51] complete and father you don't have
