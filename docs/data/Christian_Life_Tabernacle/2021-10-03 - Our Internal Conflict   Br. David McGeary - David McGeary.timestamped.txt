[20:01] trust you're excited to be here this
[20:02] morning may god bless you and welcome
[20:05] our visitors as we invite brother mike
[20:06] for our psalm reading
[20:08] this morning amen
[20:22] good morning
[20:25] we're gonna read psalm 63 this morning
[20:33] you know it's a great little chapter it
[20:35] it opens up with the verse in verse 1 it
[20:38] says
[20:39] o god
[20:40] thou art my god
[20:43] early will i seek thee
[20:46] my soul thirsteth for thee
[20:49] my flesh longeth for thee
[20:53] in a dry and thirsty land
[20:56] where no water is
[20:59] you know it's um
[21:00] it's interesting that little footnote
[21:02] there
[21:04] the beginning of the chapter tells us
[21:06] that david
[21:08] wrote this particular psalm and he was
[21:10] in the wilderness
[21:12] you know and
[21:14] whenever you talk about going out in the
[21:16] wilderness
[21:18] there's kind of uh so it's interesting
[21:20] you get two different reactions to that
[21:24] you have
[21:26] you know the one group of people that
[21:28] you know they get really excited
[21:30] about the idea of going out into the
[21:32] woods
[21:33] going out to get away from it all and
[21:37] you know it's the place that they
[21:39] go for vacation to relax whether it's to
[21:43] hunt or to just get a cabin somewhere or
[21:45] just
[21:47] get away from it all
[21:49] and then you've got the other group of
[21:50] people
[21:52] that think about how
[21:53] boring
[21:55] how terrifying that is
[21:58] you know
[21:59] snakes and there's bugs
[22:01] it's hot
[22:02] it's cold
[22:03] i can't get my latte
[22:05] you know whatever the case may be but
[22:07] you've always got you know kind of two
[22:08] different reactions
[22:10] to that pull
[22:12] you know they're the ones that when they
[22:13] go on vacation they like to go from one
[22:15] exciting place
[22:17] to another
[22:20] you know that's two different responses
[22:22] to a wilderness experience
[22:27] you know i was reading the psalm and i
[22:28] was thinking about how when
[22:30] maybe it's you know what we've been
[22:32] taught through 2000 years of
[22:34] christianity or whatever but we tend to
[22:36] think of the wilderness as being a
[22:38] dry and bare in place
[22:41] a place where you're thirsty don't can't
[22:44] find any water
[22:45] a place of trial
[22:47] a place of struggle in a place of
[22:51] place of difficulty
[22:54] but you know webster
[22:57] actually defines the word wilderness as
[22:59] this
[23:00] attract or region
[23:03] uncultivated
[23:05] and uninhabited by human beings
[23:08] an area essentially undisturbed by human
[23:12] activity
[23:13] together with its naturally developed
[23:16] life community
[23:18] you know what the wilderness really is
[23:21] it's a place untouched
[23:24] and separated from all the influences of
[23:27] man
[23:30] you won't find any you know here in
[23:32] civilization you see roads that sort of
[23:34] direct the path that you go you're
[23:35] influenced by the paths that
[23:39] man has paved out but in the wilderness
[23:42] there are no roads
[23:44] that have been pre-paved by man
[23:48] you know here in civilization you know
[23:50] we
[23:51] adopt certain behaviors and habits
[23:54] we
[23:55] consume our
[23:57] time and
[23:58] pour out our efforts in response to the
[24:00] demands and the
[24:03] expectations
[24:05] the needs
[24:07] of mankind
[24:10] but in the wilderness none of those
[24:11] things exist
[24:13] removed entirely from the influence of
[24:16] man and it's just you
[24:19] alone
[24:21] with god
[24:24] all those voices all that activity set
[24:27] aside
[24:29] and there's no other voice
[24:32] you know some people find the idea of
[24:34] that
[24:35] quiet
[24:37] alone
[24:39] place to be terrifying
[24:42] uncomfortable
[24:44] they can't stand the silence
[24:46] they can't stand the idea of being alone
[24:49] so they'll fill
[24:51] the silence with something whether it's
[24:53] their favorite playlist
[24:55] on their iphone or some other
[24:57] entertainment or they'll desperately
[24:59] seek the company of others for
[25:00] fellowship or for
[25:02] for entertainment
[25:05] anything
[25:06] to avoid that discomfort of
[25:09] being alone
[25:11] with just
[25:12] him
[25:14] you know but there are
[25:16] other people
[25:18] that seek that kind of place
[25:23] because of what they find there
[25:26] you know in the scripture the place the
[25:28] wilderness was a place where people
[25:29] found refuge
[25:31] and safety
[25:33] it was a place where they could find a
[25:34] dwelling place when they could find no
[25:36] home among the cities
[25:38] or the countries around them
[25:41] and it was for many that place where
[25:42] they encountered the lord
[25:45] you know haggar met him there
[25:48] and found a fountain of water
[25:51] when she was on the run
[25:53] and needed a dwelling place for her in
[25:55] ishmael
[25:57] moses met him there
[26:00] and found a fire burning in a bush
[26:03] without it burning the bush
[26:07] elijah met him there in caves and
[26:10] juniper trees
[26:12] when he was on the run from an angry
[26:14] queen
[26:15] of course david
[26:17] this was his place of refuge this is
[26:19] where he learned how to call upon the
[26:20] lord
[26:22] and it says in verse 5 and verse 63 his
[26:24] soul was satisfied
[26:26] as with marrow and fatness
[26:29] you know we have a tendency to look at
[26:30] that statement that he was in the
[26:32] wilderness and see that other statement
[26:34] that it was a dry and thirsty land
[26:36] and think that he was in a dry and
[26:38] thirsty land away from
[26:41] where
[26:42] you know he could find water but he had
[26:43] actually left to dry in thirsty lands to
[26:46] come into a wilderness where he could
[26:47] find the lord
[26:51] you know even brother branham when he
[26:53] was given the opportunity to walk with
[26:56] him for a while in the wilderness
[26:58] said it was the greatest privilege of
[27:00] his life
[27:01] right
[27:02] the wilderness
[27:05] it's because of the wilderness that the
[27:06] children of israel were able to assume
[27:08] their position in the land
[27:10] the people that left egypt were a
[27:11] different people than those that went
[27:13] into egypt
[27:14] right
[27:16] they left egypt a lawless people
[27:20] they left the wilderness as worshipers
[27:23] they left a position of living in
[27:25] bondage and they walked out a people of
[27:28] conqueror there were conquerors
[27:30] they left
[27:32] egypt
[27:33] without a name
[27:35] to a people that was bearing his name
[27:39] all because they had that daily
[27:42] wilderness walk
[27:45] you know the wilderness isn't
[27:46] necessarily a physical place
[27:48] away from the city
[27:50] but it's that place that you go to from
[27:53] a daily
[27:54] perspective
[27:55] to get away from all the influence of
[27:57] man separated and apart
[28:00] not running to and fro from one activity
[28:02] to another not necessarily a church
[28:04] service not necessarily fellowshipping
[28:06] with believers but that place where it's
[28:08] just you
[28:10] and him
[28:11] otherwise you're still in a dry and
[28:13] thirsty land
[28:16] you know in psalm 63 david describes the
[28:19] world around him as a dry and thirsty
[28:20] land
[28:23] but he goes into the wilderness and it's
[28:25] there to that he sees his power and his
[28:27] glory
[28:28] just as he's seen in his sanctuary
[28:33] you know david
[28:35] sought that place in the wilderness as a
[28:38] refuge from that dry and thirsty land
[28:40] that he was surrounded with and the
[28:42] question that you know i would ask
[28:43] myself i think we could ask ourselves do
[28:45] we have a wilderness walk this morning
[28:48] do we have that does the idea of
[28:51] stepping away and setting aside
[28:53] everything and spending some alone time
[28:56] with him does it sound uncomfortable
[28:58] or can't you wait to get there
[29:01] that daily
[29:02] wilderness walk you know we know that
[29:04] song that says
[29:07] you know this world is not my home i'm
[29:09] just a passing through you know there's
[29:10] a people that pass through this dry and
[29:12] thirsty land by walking in the
[29:14] wilderness
[29:16] you know it was there that david said in
[29:18] verse 5
[29:19] of this psalm we're going to read my
[29:21] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[29:24] and fatness and my mouth shall praise
[29:27] thee with joyful lips
[29:31] it's a place where he could go that in
[29:32] verse three he said thy loving kindness
[29:35] is better
[29:36] than life
[29:38] so as we read psalm 63 this morning it's
[29:41] just a short chapter
[29:43] maybe it's just a quiet call a reminder
[29:47] of the need for each of us to step away
[29:49] from the busyness
[29:51] from the pressures
[29:53] the noise
[29:55] the activity
[29:56] of civilization and
[29:59] daily
[30:00] step into that wilderness where he may
[30:03] be found
[30:04] fellowship is great
[30:06] church service is great but it's until
[30:08] you have that wilderness walk
[30:11] that you can't meet him right
[30:14] so let's read that together maybe as
[30:16] we're reminded of that this morning
[30:18] psalm 63
[30:20] david's walk in the wilderness let's
[30:23] read that together starting in verse 1
[30:25] o god thou art my god
[30:28] early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth
[30:31] for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a
[30:34] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[30:38] to see thy power in thy glory so as i
[30:41] have seen thee in the sanctuary because
[30:44] thy loving kindness is better than life
[30:47] my lips shall praise thee thus will i
[30:49] bless thee while i live i will lift up
[30:52] my hands in thy name
[30:54] my soul shall be satisfied as with
[30:57] marrow and fatness and my mouth shall
[30:59] praise thee with joyful lips when i
[31:02] remember thee upon my bed and meditate
[31:04] on thee in the night watches because
[31:07] thou has been my help therefore in the
[31:10] shadow of thy wings will i rejoice
[31:12] my soul followeth heart after thee thy
[31:15] right hand upholdeth me
[31:17] those that seek my soul to destroy it
[31:20] shall go into the lower parts of the
[31:22] earth they shall fall by the sword they
[31:25] shall be apportioned for foxes but the
[31:27] king shall rejoice in god
[31:29] everyone that sweareth by him shall
[31:32] glory but the mouth of them that speak
[31:34] lies shall be stopped amen
[31:39] amen
[31:41] god bless you i have your seats amen

[56:36] so let us pray our gracious heavenly
[56:38] father
[56:40] we approach your throne father
[56:44] needy people
[56:47] father many times we
[56:50] feel
[56:52] when we're
[56:53] carnally satisfied that
[56:57] then we're not needy
[57:00] but father
[57:01] we need spiritual
[57:03] help in this hour
[57:04] [Music]
[57:06] the enemy has
[57:08] found a way in
[57:12] is working hard to destroy
[57:16] all truth pertaining to you
[57:20] but father our hearts hunger after you
[57:22] this morning
[57:24] lord we received a great message in this
[57:27] day
[57:28] father directed to an elect people
[57:32] and father we want to accept our calling
[57:35] this morning
[57:37] and
[57:38] to have ears that can hear the gospel
[57:42] eyes father
[57:44] that have applied isab that we might see
[57:48] this morning
[57:49] we ask you to increase our faith
[57:52] increase our confidence in your word
[57:54] father
[57:56] it's the only thing that'll help us
[57:58] we ask you to bless the people this
[58:00] morning
[58:01] in your precious and
[58:03] holy name we pray
[58:05] amen
[58:06] amen
[58:08] god bless you this morning
[58:11] if you have your bibles let's turn over
[58:15] into the
[58:19] scripture
[58:21] found in the book of
[58:23] numbers the 22nd chapter
[58:26] and the 31st verse so
[58:29] uh
[58:30] the book of
[58:33] numbers
[58:34] the
[58:36] 22nd chapter
[58:38] and the 30
[58:40] first verse
[58:42] we welcome each of you this morning
[58:44] our visitors and
[58:46] those that are amongst us and
[58:49] and
[58:51] so we just trust that
[58:53] you are blessed this morning that
[58:55] there'll be something in god's word
[59:00] and
[59:01] that'll
[59:02] just
[59:03] touch your heart
[59:05] amen the 22nd chapter
[59:09] and the 31st
[59:11] verse
[59:14] then the lord opened the eyes of balaam
[59:18] and he saw the angel of the lord
[59:21] standing
[59:22] in the way
[59:24] and his sword drawn in his hand
[59:27] and he bowed down his head and fell flat
[59:31] upon his face
[59:32] may god bless his word to us this
[59:34] morning in jesus name we pray amen amen
[59:38] god bless you
[59:43] as we've been uh
[59:46] traveling along if i could say it that
[59:48] way
[59:49] uh
[59:50] we begin to take some the messages that
[59:53] are preached uh
[59:56] as we've been going started out in
[59:59] 1965 and we've just been taking our path
[1:00:03] and coming down and looking at each
[1:00:06] message as we go
[1:00:09] we just went through the great sermon
[1:00:12] is this the rising of the sun
[1:00:15] and we just saw so many blessings
[1:00:17] open up to us out of the word things
[1:00:20] that the lord
[1:00:22] is uh
[1:00:23] showing us and
[1:00:24] opening to us
[1:00:26] and i just think it's a marvelous
[1:00:29] how that
[1:00:30] uh the last message we read how much he
[1:00:34] put emphasis
[1:00:36] on our calling
[1:00:38] in our election
[1:00:39] and the finished work that god
[1:00:43] has already done in us
[1:00:46] i believe there's a place that the
[1:00:48] believer can really grow
[1:00:51] when it has confidence that they're in
[1:00:54] the palm of god's hand
[1:00:57] and we know that our society today
[1:01:01] is built on destroying that confidence
[1:01:04] that's what he's doing he
[1:01:06] he wants to make the future
[1:01:09] look so uncertain
[1:01:11] and slow so cloudy
[1:01:14] that we don't realize that we already
[1:01:17] possess
[1:01:18] in our hearts what it takes for us to
[1:01:21] make it all the way through so he he's
[1:01:24] done a great work and and we saw you
[1:01:26] that our confidence can be built in him
[1:01:30] amen our faith is built in nothing less
[1:01:34] than jesus christ in his
[1:01:36] righteousness so we always
[1:01:39] say i was raised a catholic
[1:01:41] and in being a catholic we were always
[1:01:44] taught
[1:01:45] that we needed to have some form of
[1:01:47] penance
[1:01:48] you know something that we had to do if
[1:01:52] we sinned then we needed to inflict
[1:01:55] some form of suffering
[1:01:57] upon ourselves for the sin
[1:02:01] that we committed and we would do all
[1:02:03] kinds of things we would give up uh
[1:02:06] certain things or we'd say
[1:02:09] prayers uh
[1:02:11] and and go to special
[1:02:13] light candles and
[1:02:15] every bit of it had to do with some sort
[1:02:18] of reconciliation
[1:02:21] on our part
[1:02:23] and
[1:02:24] even in mexico when i
[1:02:26] had the opportunity to go to mexico
[1:02:29] there was a
[1:02:30] certain church there in mexico that i've
[1:02:33] heard about all my life growing up as a
[1:02:36] catholic
[1:02:38] and it's the place where the people
[1:02:40] would get down on their knees
[1:02:42] and they would actually crawl for miles
[1:02:45] on their knees you could go down the
[1:02:47] boulevard and you can actually see the
[1:02:50] where where they had walked on their
[1:02:52] knees and walked on their knees up the
[1:02:55] steps and all the way to the altar
[1:02:58] to pray
[1:03:00] and all the time
[1:03:02] having their rosaries saying prayers and
[1:03:05] it was an effort
[1:03:06] uh for them to make some sort of
[1:03:10] atonement
[1:03:12] because that they were sinners
[1:03:15] and it's it's one thing to recognize
[1:03:18] you're a sinner
[1:03:20] but there's another thing to recognize
[1:03:23] that you're free from sin
[1:03:25] now you're not free from temptation
[1:03:29] and you're not free from
[1:03:32] the flesh
[1:03:33] but you're free from unbelief
[1:03:36] and anybody that has to go through that
[1:03:39] much effort of lighting candles and
[1:03:41] walking on their knees and
[1:03:45] you know
[1:03:46] giving up certain things to inflict
[1:03:48] punishment is not sure
[1:03:51] of their salvation
[1:03:54] that that issue has not been settled you
[1:03:58] know because they're still doing things
[1:04:00] to obtain it
[1:04:02] and i thought this message
[1:04:03] is arising and some was so beautiful to
[1:04:06] let us know
[1:04:08] that when he was on the cross we were
[1:04:11] there
[1:04:12] we were in him i liked the song when he
[1:04:15] was on the cross we were on his mind
[1:04:18] and i thought that song was
[1:04:21] maybe the author didn't understand all
[1:04:24] the great words of inspiration
[1:04:26] that were in it but he went there with
[1:04:30] you on his mind he went there paying
[1:04:34] the atonement for your sins because he
[1:04:37] knew who was in the lamb's book of life
[1:04:41] because they were in him
[1:04:44] you were his kinsmen
[1:04:46] the kinsmen redeemer and that's who he
[1:04:50] came he came for his own
[1:04:52] and so we we know that with this great
[1:04:56] price paid for us at calvary
[1:04:58] and not by our righteousness
[1:05:01] not by our power not by our might by by
[1:05:04] his spirit saith the lord we understand
[1:05:08] that we there's a rest that we can take
[1:05:12] knowing that he has all things in his
[1:05:14] hands and he can do for us exceedingly
[1:05:18] and abundantly above what we can ask or
[1:05:21] think so god has not
[1:05:23] forsaken us
[1:05:25] and he hasn't forsaken me and he hasn't
[1:05:27] forsaken you
[1:05:29] though we've given him many causes
[1:05:32] to forsake us
[1:05:34] it would uh it would only uh
[1:05:38] uh seem like it would take somebody very
[1:05:41] special to stay with us all this time
[1:05:44] but that's what he's got purposed in his
[1:05:46] heart he's got purposed in his heart
[1:05:48] that he won't lose you
[1:05:50] he won't forsake you he won't lose you
[1:05:53] nothing is going to take him take you
[1:05:56] away from him and he'll go through
[1:05:58] whatever
[1:06:00] means and bounds or trouble that he has
[1:06:02] to to get you in fact he even had to
[1:06:06] appear to paul
[1:06:08] on his road to damascus and smite him
[1:06:11] blind
[1:06:12] and say paul
[1:06:13] it's hard to fight me
[1:06:16] it's hard to kick against the brick
[1:06:19] it's hard to do battle with me i'm not
[1:06:23] gonna lose
[1:06:26] all right and so paul had to uh he
[1:06:29] learned obedience and and he suffered
[1:06:32] any but but he knew even to the point
[1:06:35] when he got in front of the king at on
[1:06:39] before agrippa and he says oh agrippa he
[1:06:43] said i'll tell you my story i was on my
[1:06:46] way in and and uh uh
[1:06:48] and and a grip uh he's and he tells the
[1:06:52] grip i i was not disobedient to the
[1:06:55] heavenly vision and the grip said paul
[1:06:57] does that even persuade persuaded me
[1:07:02] you know
[1:07:03] that's what he was doing and he was
[1:07:04] trying to convert him and you know what
[1:07:06] he had his opportunity right there
[1:07:10] he said he said he said oh
[1:07:13] oh agrippa i would let you be as i
[1:07:17] except for these uh
[1:07:19] chains right here
[1:07:22] and and so god's always wanted to share
[1:07:26] himself with you the enemy's the accuser
[1:07:30] he's the one that looks at your past
[1:07:32] looks at your fault tells you that you
[1:07:35] are what's in
[1:07:37] the mirror
[1:07:38] but you're more than what's in the
[1:07:40] mirror what you really are is what he
[1:07:42] has in his mind
[1:07:44] and we've brought that to you in many
[1:07:46] different ways but the one that you see
[1:07:48] in the mirror is the other you the real
[1:07:52] you is the one that he has and that he's
[1:07:55] molding you and making you
[1:07:58] and forming you too and the scripture
[1:08:02] tells us that we might be formed into
[1:08:04] the image of our lord and so that's what
[1:08:07] he's doing so he hasn't quit us
[1:08:10] let's don't quit him
[1:08:12] now we've read these scriptures here and
[1:08:14] we're going to uh
[1:08:16] and we're
[1:08:18] and i if i could
[1:08:20] title this you know it i titled it our
[1:08:24] our internal
[1:08:26] conflict
[1:08:27] or our our internal clash
[1:08:31] um
[1:08:32] and so uh
[1:08:34] we're we're looking at this uh message
[1:08:37] and
[1:08:38] and we're just going to kind of read to
[1:08:40] you and try to bring some uh
[1:08:44] basic if i could say this
[1:08:46] fundamental truth so this morning's
[1:08:48] going to be
[1:08:50] more
[1:08:51] like a sunday school lesson or a bible
[1:08:54] teaching unless i get inspired and get
[1:08:56] excited and then we'll move to another
[1:09:00] realm
[1:09:01] but i i just like these great things
[1:09:03] here so i'd like to if you can follow me
[1:09:06] along in the message does god ever
[1:09:09] change his mind
[1:09:11] about his word he reads the scripture
[1:09:13] and then i'm going to read this
[1:09:15] statement that he brings us
[1:09:19] in paragraph 67 and 66 so he just got
[1:09:24] finished reading his text
[1:09:26] and he says now
[1:09:28] in the
[1:09:29] reading
[1:09:31] of this
[1:09:32] to build a text around it
[1:09:36] i want to take the subject
[1:09:38] does god ever change his mind about his
[1:09:42] word
[1:09:44] that's a great question
[1:09:46] and so i i was talking to brother uh
[1:09:49] jackson the other day and i said jackson
[1:09:51] uh i said we're gonna take the subject
[1:09:54] does god ever change his mind about his
[1:09:57] word and he said well i've got the
[1:09:59] answer to
[1:10:00] that and he said no
[1:10:03] i said well yes i don't have to preach
[1:10:06] in the morning you know
[1:10:08] you can go ahead but there's some great
[1:10:10] understandings in here
[1:10:12] so
[1:10:13] but he makes this statement he says that
[1:10:16] is quite a text
[1:10:18] and it's a great truth
[1:10:21] that we ought to understand
[1:10:26] so there's a truth there that he wants
[1:10:29] us to understand
[1:10:31] he says
[1:10:33] can god
[1:10:35] say anything
[1:10:38] and then say i'm sorry i said it
[1:10:42] can god take his word back after he said
[1:10:46] it
[1:10:48] now
[1:10:49] that
[1:10:50] that is a great thing and we don't
[1:10:53] realize it
[1:10:54] but within our own spirits and within
[1:10:58] our own minds
[1:10:59] that conflict is continually going on
[1:11:04] there
[1:11:05] there's a battle that rages
[1:11:09] within us
[1:11:10] concerning the will of god
[1:11:14] and and that
[1:11:18] just uh
[1:11:20] as
[1:11:20] as it is now he took this text of of
[1:11:24] balaam and and because it brings to us
[1:11:28] the question
[1:11:29] uh can god say no
[1:11:32] and then say yes
[1:11:34] and you understand the story of balaam
[1:11:37] uh the israelites were on their way
[1:11:41] to the promised land
[1:11:43] and they were coming to the land of
[1:11:46] the moabites
[1:11:48] and so
[1:11:49] the
[1:11:50] king
[1:11:52] of barrick barrack
[1:11:55] called on to
[1:11:57] balaam to come
[1:11:59] and
[1:12:02] curse the children of israel
[1:12:04] now that doesn't mean swear adam you
[1:12:08] know what i mean it it meant to change
[1:12:11] their direction
[1:12:14] you understand
[1:12:15] to influence them now we're not going to
[1:12:19] go into all this part of it but you know
[1:12:22] that he did do that because the children
[1:12:25] of israel began to take the daughters of
[1:12:28] the moabites
[1:12:29] and and it was a mixing
[1:12:32] and and
[1:12:34] and that's what he came
[1:12:36] to do
[1:12:37] was to dilute
[1:12:39] the word of god
[1:12:41] in other words to
[1:12:43] balaam came to
[1:12:45] instill
[1:12:47] into the children of israel another way
[1:12:51] of looking at the promises
[1:12:54] you know in other words this is one
[1:12:57] thought let me give you another thought
[1:12:59] you know
[1:13:01] and that is not a new tactic
[1:13:04] that tactic uh happened first of all in
[1:13:07] the garden of eden
[1:13:09] when
[1:13:10] satan came to eve and she said well he
[1:13:14] said i would die
[1:13:16] and he said no
[1:13:18] surely you won't die
[1:13:21] you know and he knew that i i i'm just
[1:13:24] going to get away from my notes i can't
[1:13:26] just feel my spirit just feeling the
[1:13:29] freedom but
[1:13:31] he knew that god couldn't
[1:13:34] destroy
[1:13:35] adam and eve
[1:13:38] because he knew he had a purpose for him
[1:13:40] so he said surely you won't die
[1:13:46] but he said
[1:13:48] let me tell you there's another way of
[1:13:50] looking at it
[1:13:52] if you do eat this
[1:13:54] you understand you'll know all things
[1:13:57] you will understand things you it it'll
[1:14:00] be enlightened and so the battle in the
[1:14:04] mind started right there
[1:14:06] and remember this great statement that
[1:14:10] eve accepted satan's lie as god's truth
[1:14:17] so
[1:14:18] it was almost a self-deception
[1:14:21] and you could imagine the battle that
[1:14:23] went on in her mind the battle that went
[1:14:25] on in her heart as she began to think
[1:14:28] through these different things in her
[1:14:30] life and and so as we follow this story
[1:14:34] we have to understand the story now here
[1:14:36] comes balaam and
[1:14:39] balaam's a prophet
[1:14:41] he's not a soothsayer
[1:14:43] he's a real genuine prophet of god
[1:14:46] the the
[1:14:48] the moabites
[1:14:50] are not unbelievers
[1:14:52] they're serving the same god that
[1:14:55] moses
[1:14:56] and the children of israel are serving
[1:15:00] they come from the descendants of lot
[1:15:04] so that's how
[1:15:06] uh
[1:15:08] known
[1:15:09] you know
[1:15:12] let me think here it's uh
[1:15:14] um anyone that came out of the flood it
[1:15:16] was his daughter by his own
[1:15:19] uh it was
[1:15:21] the son from his own daughter who was
[1:15:23] that okay
[1:15:25] was it lot
[1:15:26] okay so a lot it was lot's daughter's
[1:15:31] son
[1:15:32] and
[1:15:32] so
[1:15:33] the son of the father
[1:15:35] a lot and his daughter's
[1:15:38] child that was their descendants so they
[1:15:41] knew god and they served god and so this
[1:15:44] is how it came down through
[1:15:47] the time so and so they had prophets and
[1:15:51] they had so we realized then that
[1:15:54] there's a type here
[1:15:56] it says now israel of the old testament
[1:15:59] typed the bride of
[1:16:02] the new testament
[1:16:04] coming out of the world marching on
[1:16:07] their road
[1:16:08] that to go into the millennium and
[1:16:11] that's paragraph 70. it says israel of
[1:16:14] the old testament types the bride of the
[1:16:17] new testament coming out of the world
[1:16:20] marching the road to canaan or the can't
[1:16:23] to go to the millennium
[1:16:26] so they they they're they're a type
[1:16:29] of the
[1:16:30] they're a type
[1:16:32] of the bride
[1:16:34] moab is a type of the organized and
[1:16:38] denominational
[1:16:40] church
[1:16:42] and so this is this type now we want to
[1:16:45] understand the journey so if we are on
[1:16:50] the journey that they were on it's a
[1:16:53] type of our journey to the millennium
[1:16:56] so if if we're on this journey and it's
[1:16:59] a type and a type is a foreshadow of
[1:17:03] something that's to come
[1:17:05] amen so they make in manufacturing they
[1:17:09] make a prototype they make the type
[1:17:12] first and they can work it out but it
[1:17:14] still lets you know this is what is to
[1:17:16] come so
[1:17:18] this is a type of the journey so their
[1:17:21] journey to the cane to canaan is a type
[1:17:25] of our journey to the millennium
[1:17:28] and so why do we need to understand this
[1:17:31] because if these are the things that
[1:17:35] attack
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:38] israel on their way to the canaan land
[1:17:42] and that's a type then we should begin
[1:17:44] to understand that there is going to be
[1:17:47] an attack on us that we don't have a
[1:17:50] journey
[1:17:51] free of problems and trials and of tests
[1:17:56] and so we need to understand that
[1:17:59] that we we just don't all of a sudden
[1:18:01] believe
[1:18:02] and it's settled and uh there's not a
[1:18:06] part that we play they were elected you
[1:18:10] understand that they came out of the
[1:18:13] egypt under the pillar of fire under
[1:18:16] signs and wonders
[1:18:19] so they knew their election
[1:18:21] but their election didn't stop them from
[1:18:25] having to take the journey
[1:18:29] and so if i could that's the theme of
[1:18:32] what's on my heart this morning is that
[1:18:35] we still have to take the journey
[1:18:40] and so we're going to just look at that
[1:18:42] through the
[1:18:43] eyes of the scripture we you don't can't
[1:18:46] say i'm elected and sit on the park
[1:18:49] bench
[1:18:50] and watch the world go on
[1:18:55] you're elected to take the trip
[1:18:59] it's like having the ticket
[1:19:01] if i'm handing out tickets to get on the
[1:19:04] train
[1:19:06] you you can take the ticket and you can
[1:19:08] say i have a ticket
[1:19:11] i'm i've got the trip
[1:19:14] i've i've got the in
[1:19:16] i got the possession of it so in that
[1:19:19] ticket
[1:19:20] you have the destination
[1:19:24] so you can claim to have the destination
[1:19:27] but you still have got to take the
[1:19:30] journey
[1:19:32] you know you've got to get on the train
[1:19:34] and let the train take you through all
[1:19:37] the stops through all the mountains
[1:19:39] through the valleys through everything
[1:19:41] but you rest in the fact that you had
[1:19:45] the ticket
[1:19:46] given to you
[1:19:48] so it won't fail and you've got three
[1:19:51] you rest in the fact that he's going to
[1:19:54] take me on this journey and i'm going to
[1:19:57] end up at my final destination but you
[1:20:00] still got to take the trip
[1:20:03] you can't sit there and create a false
[1:20:06] faith
[1:20:08] and a false revelation
[1:20:10] and say i'm just going to sit here and
[1:20:12] one day
[1:20:13] like philip i'm just going to be
[1:20:16] poofed over there
[1:20:19] well if that was the case when you got
[1:20:22] there you wouldn't have any of the
[1:20:24] experiences any of the character any of
[1:20:28] the understanding of what it took
[1:20:34] so he's got to take us on this journey
[1:20:37] and i think it behooves us
[1:20:40] to understand
[1:20:42] uh as we take this
[1:20:44] journey what is being built and what are
[1:20:47] the things that we're overcoming
[1:20:51] and
[1:20:52] so we're not
[1:20:53] we're not going to
[1:20:55] fail to get there
[1:20:57] but he wants to build us character in
[1:21:01] our journey
[1:21:02] and sometimes we know the scripture says
[1:21:05] he'll take our vessel and he'll
[1:21:07] completely break it down and and then
[1:21:10] he'll remold it the way that he happens
[1:21:13] but praise god all of that happens on
[1:21:15] the journey
[1:21:18] so he'll never leave you
[1:21:21] he won't forsake you
[1:21:23] you've got a lot of difficulties and
[1:21:25] just like on a journey you go through
[1:21:28] valley you don't go through one valley
[1:21:30] and say oh that's the last valley
[1:21:32] on the trip
[1:21:34] neither do you get on the mountaintop
[1:21:36] and think i'm on the mountaintop the
[1:21:38] trip trip's over
[1:21:41] but he continually
[1:21:43] takes us
[1:21:44] and is dealing with us and and working
[1:21:47] his power
[1:21:48] of of transfer
[1:21:51] nation within our spirits and within our
[1:21:54] hearts so we're grateful for the journey
[1:21:58] because on the journey it allows him to
[1:22:01] uh
[1:22:03] it allows him to
[1:22:05] deal with us and show us things and have
[1:22:08] that personal fellowship that brother
[1:22:10] mike spoke of in his exhortation this
[1:22:13] morning that chance to get alone
[1:22:16] with god and have him do the great
[1:22:19] things that he does for us and so we see
[1:22:22] this great type
[1:22:24] here and
[1:22:26] and and so we we we know now with moab
[1:22:30] being a type
[1:22:31] that we can we can talk about uh what
[1:22:37] is what was moab being a type of
[1:22:40] organization
[1:22:42] and what was his effect
[1:22:45] and so the bible makes this statement he
[1:22:48] says
[1:22:52] he says
[1:22:53] i'm thinking
[1:22:54] that the greatest
[1:22:56] enemy
[1:22:58] of christian society today
[1:23:01] is organized
[1:23:04] churches so he says that's the greatest
[1:23:08] uh
[1:23:09] enemy of the church today
[1:23:11] is organized churches now
[1:23:16] so many and we're talking this morning
[1:23:19] about
[1:23:20] the
[1:23:22] internal conflict
[1:23:24] so something that's organized
[1:23:27] is already set
[1:23:29] in its ways
[1:23:32] okay it's everything's set
[1:23:35] have you ever met uh uh someone that is
[1:23:38] uh
[1:23:40] uh
[1:23:41] i don't know
[1:23:42] you know they're just they're really
[1:23:44] prone to everything having its place
[1:23:49] i went through a stage of like that in
[1:23:52] my life
[1:23:53] and i would walk into my house and if
[1:23:56] the picture was just turned a little bit
[1:23:58] i'd go turn it back and you know
[1:24:01] everything
[1:24:02] had its place it made life easy for me
[1:24:06] that was at a time when i was going
[1:24:08] through a lot of inner
[1:24:09] emotional conflict and so the the more
[1:24:13] order i could put in the carnal world
[1:24:16] the more security i placed in things
[1:24:19] that are carnal
[1:24:23] and so a world that's organized
[1:24:28] an organization he said was the greatest
[1:24:32] uh
[1:24:33] detriment or the greatest enemy
[1:24:37] so something that is so set in its ways
[1:24:40] and and has
[1:24:42] got things all figured out
[1:24:45] that becomes an enemy to the church and
[1:24:49] we have a tendency in our lives to set
[1:24:52] patterns not necessarily patterns of
[1:24:55] good work but realms of comfort
[1:24:59] and and where we have borders and
[1:25:02] boundaries and everything set up even in
[1:25:06] our mind that we begin to think in just
[1:25:10] a certain way
[1:25:11] and and we have our means of judgment
[1:25:14] and therefore once you're organized to a
[1:25:18] place it doesn't allow for any change
[1:25:22] or any growth
[1:25:27] and and so this is why he says this is
[1:25:30] the greatest
[1:25:31] enemy of the church
[1:25:34] is that i get to a place where i don't
[1:25:36] allow
[1:25:38] any growth any changes
[1:25:42] to my nature to my personality or to
[1:25:46] myself
[1:25:49] so we we
[1:25:51] basically say i'm spiritual
[1:25:54] i've got it figured out i know the word
[1:25:57] of god i have this i have that i i i
[1:26:01] don't need
[1:26:03] a a attitude adjustment
[1:26:08] or a personality adjustment so i know
[1:26:11] what i believe and therefore my my
[1:26:16] foundation becomes my own personal
[1:26:19] interpretation and understanding of the
[1:26:23] word of god so that's what i'm said in
[1:26:27] and there's one sad
[1:26:29] part of that it produces something that
[1:26:33] i refer to as blame or finger-pointing
[1:26:38] i'm okay
[1:26:41] it's everybody else's fault
[1:26:46] you know it's just nature if you're
[1:26:48] organized
[1:26:49] and you feel that the organization
[1:26:54] of your life is right
[1:26:57] then anybody that doesn't fit the
[1:26:59] pattern of your life must be wrong
[1:27:02] because if you give any credence at all
[1:27:06] to the way they're doing things or the
[1:27:08] way that they think you feel that that
[1:27:11] is an infringement
[1:27:13] and a judgment against the way you do
[1:27:16] things i've worked with a lot of guys in
[1:27:19] my life on the construction field that
[1:27:22] just don't know what they're doing
[1:27:24] because they don't do it my way
[1:27:32] you know
[1:27:33] you know in other words
[1:27:35] i was so caught up
[1:27:38] in the way that i do things and the way
[1:27:41] that i feel
[1:27:43] that they should be done i couldn't even
[1:27:46] join in with them that we were both
[1:27:49] trying to achieve the same end
[1:27:55] and you know what you learn after a
[1:27:57] while if you feel that way about
[1:28:00] everything you end up doing everything
[1:28:02] yourself
[1:28:06] and there's got to come a time you've
[1:28:08] got to say okay you just do it your way
[1:28:11] now you may think in your heart they're
[1:28:13] doing it harder they're doing it longer
[1:28:17] but when it's all said and done
[1:28:20] if if it reached its goal and what was
[1:28:23] finished was finished then you can rest
[1:28:26] in that okay we got the job done
[1:28:30] the best thing is you didn't i didn't
[1:28:32] have to
[1:28:37] well we're doing a lot of things we
[1:28:39] don't have to do
[1:28:41] because there's a god that's already
[1:28:44] done it for us
[1:28:46] you understand nothing's going to pluck
[1:28:49] you out of the palm of his hand
[1:28:51] so we have a rest in the eternal
[1:28:54] security of god but that we can now grow
[1:28:58] from that and so what organized
[1:29:01] religions did
[1:29:02] is it it
[1:29:04] they they don't allow
[1:29:07] for any deviation
[1:29:13] so they built their walls
[1:29:17] and remember that's what that the
[1:29:20] prophet of god said that about organized
[1:29:23] religion is that they built up barriers
[1:29:26] and walls around one another
[1:29:29] they couldn't even fellowship right in
[1:29:32] the general worship of what god
[1:29:35] accomplished on the cross
[1:29:38] they couldn't even fellowship in in one
[1:29:41] another's blessings so remember god lets
[1:29:45] the rain fall on the just and the unjust
[1:29:48] god is a rewarder
[1:29:50] and maybe somebody somewhere in life's
[1:29:53] time had done something good for
[1:29:55] somebody or asked god for something or
[1:29:57] did a favor for something and god wants
[1:30:00] to come along and bless them somehow uh
[1:30:03] uh and do things and if you're so
[1:30:06] blind
[1:30:08] and so opinionated and so defeated that
[1:30:13] you can't even sit back and say well you
[1:30:15] know praise god god did bless you
[1:30:21] i've seen a lot of people very
[1:30:23] successful and i realize the only reason
[1:30:25] they're successful is because god
[1:30:28] blessed them
[1:30:30] and they may even take the name of the
[1:30:32] lord in vain but you understand god is
[1:30:35] going to take that whatever that
[1:30:38] blessing is and somewhere down the line
[1:30:41] it is going to become a blessing to his
[1:30:44] elect lady
[1:30:50] he's just that kind of god he's got a
[1:30:52] bigger program than we do he does ways
[1:30:55] that we don't understand his ways are
[1:30:57] beyond finding out
[1:31:00] but so
[1:31:01] uh what we need to be understand and
[1:31:04] come back to our internal clash and our
[1:31:07] internal conflict is what what is it
[1:31:10] that we want for our heart and our mind
[1:31:14] what kind of people do we want to be
[1:31:19] i don't want to be finger-pointing
[1:31:23] i don't want to be so concerned about
[1:31:26] everything that's going around me
[1:31:29] and be of fear that it's going to affect
[1:31:32] me now i can say this because i've
[1:31:36] watched the numbers of those that
[1:31:39] gathered together and the assembling of
[1:31:41] the church began to dwindle
[1:31:47] and that's because satan allowed a virus
[1:31:51] some flu
[1:31:54] that not everybody dies from
[1:31:59] but the fear
[1:32:02] you know and and so you sit in conflict
[1:32:06] you understand within
[1:32:08] within your own self because the word of
[1:32:10] god says forsake not the assembling of
[1:32:13] yourselves together unless satan comes
[1:32:16] with a covert virus
[1:32:25] do you understand but something
[1:32:29] took the place
[1:32:30] of something else
[1:32:34] now so we came up with an option
[1:32:37] called streaming
[1:32:39] i remember a few sundays ago that seemed
[1:32:42] like the presence of the lord just
[1:32:44] dropped into the service and and people
[1:32:47] were blessed and people came up to be
[1:32:49] prayed for that i hadn't recognized so i
[1:32:52] don't go back and listen to too many of
[1:32:54] my sermons but i went back to listen to
[1:32:57] this and i and i watched it streaming it
[1:32:59] and i could tell that what you're
[1:33:02] watching is not what's happening present
[1:33:09] because there is a word of god
[1:33:13] that obligates him
[1:33:16] he's only obligated to his word
[1:33:19] he's not obligated to our interpretation
[1:33:22] but he's obligated to what he said and
[1:33:25] he said wherever two or three gathered
[1:33:28] together in my name to dare that i'll be
[1:33:31] and when you get licks of fire together
[1:33:34] there's a presence of god that that is
[1:33:38] uh working in the midst of the people as
[1:33:41] his angels go to and fro up the road
[1:33:45] collecting the uh
[1:33:47] collecting the prayer requests of the
[1:33:50] people and presenting him to him and
[1:33:53] then he starts ministering
[1:33:57] there's a different anointing
[1:34:00] in a different place
[1:34:03] but there's there's substitutions
[1:34:07] that
[1:34:08] take place
[1:34:10] and people have go through this conflict
[1:34:13] what should i do should i go to church i
[1:34:15] don't believe you should come to church
[1:34:17] if you're sick
[1:34:21] you know if
[1:34:23] if
[1:34:23] you're sick then we have ways to pray
[1:34:26] for you
[1:34:28] if you're sick
[1:34:30] you know even the prophet of god said if
[1:34:33] you have a child that doesn't obey
[1:34:36] in service he said leave him home
[1:34:41] i mean that's quite a statement
[1:34:44] but
[1:34:45] to continually
[1:34:46] uh stay out
[1:34:49] of the house of god
[1:34:51] because you've come up with something
[1:34:54] else yourself
[1:34:58] and and so
[1:35:00] this is sort of
[1:35:02] a
[1:35:03] theme line
[1:35:05] that runs to this message does god
[1:35:07] change his mind about his word so he
[1:35:10] says every time that man made an
[1:35:12] organization
[1:35:14] the spirit of god left it and never did
[1:35:18] return
[1:35:19] again
[1:35:24] this the spirit
[1:35:27] so every time man set his boundaries
[1:35:32] and set his borders
[1:35:34] and has a lifestyle that god can no
[1:35:37] longer influence or affect
[1:35:43] you know i mean another he looks at you
[1:35:45] and says
[1:35:47] you're not going to change
[1:35:49] i'm not going to change you
[1:35:52] you're set
[1:35:55] you know you're spiritually stubborn
[1:35:58] you know what's better for you than i do
[1:36:02] and when he comes to the place that he
[1:36:04] can't deal with your heart
[1:36:06] and can deal with their spirit he
[1:36:11] he leaves yes
[1:36:15] and i i only have human
[1:36:18] terminologies
[1:36:19] and a human perspective but basically
[1:36:23] god's not going to waste his time
[1:36:27] now you can argue well god don't have
[1:36:29] time and all that okay go into some
[1:36:31] theological
[1:36:34] cobweb
[1:36:36] and miss the whole thing that the lord's
[1:36:39] trying to say which is a a symbol and an
[1:36:43] attribute of organization
[1:36:47] they have an explanation
[1:36:49] for anything that challenges them
[1:36:54] and that's part of what takes place
[1:36:56] in the internal conflict that goes
[1:36:59] within us when god wants to deal with us
[1:37:02] or god wants to touch us or god wants to
[1:37:05] expand us then all of a sudden we have
[1:37:08] this great willing
[1:37:10] that comes up within us
[1:37:13] of defense
[1:37:18] we defend the way we think we defend the
[1:37:20] way we act we defend what it is we look
[1:37:23] for all kinds we don't need to be
[1:37:25] justified you understand he's already
[1:37:27] justified us through the blood of the
[1:37:30] lamb
[1:37:31] he's not doing away with us and he's not
[1:37:33] going to condemn us because there's no
[1:37:35] condemnation to them that walk in christ
[1:37:37] jesus after the spirit and not after the
[1:37:40] flesh
[1:37:44] so we defend ourselves
[1:37:47] as if we have something to do with our
[1:37:50] salvation
[1:37:52] and the scripture says if if we can do
[1:37:54] anything for our salvation jesus christ
[1:37:57] died in vain
[1:38:01] he didn't come to do for us what we
[1:38:03] could have done for ourselves
[1:38:06] the things for yourself that you can do
[1:38:08] do do what's right do what's righteous
[1:38:10] do what's good lay for yourselves a
[1:38:13] pattern of good works
[1:38:16] but don't think that you're not needy
[1:38:21] don't think you're all right
[1:38:23] the way you are
[1:38:26] because you could be perfect but the
[1:38:28] scripture tells us to be perfect as he
[1:38:31] is perfect
[1:38:33] so our
[1:38:34] our perfection can grow
[1:38:37] to a greater level
[1:38:41] and he wants to bring you to that level
[1:38:44] because his desire is i love that
[1:38:46] scripture as he is
[1:38:49] so are we in this world and he's molding
[1:38:52] us and making us into the image of the
[1:38:55] lord so we want to understand the great
[1:38:58] eternal conflict that's within us
[1:39:01] so
[1:39:01] we understand that there's a clash so
[1:39:05] so god leaves it so we so there's
[1:39:07] something that that works here so i'd
[1:39:10] like to listen to this great statement
[1:39:14] or we'll just read this little section
[1:39:16] here
[1:39:17] starting at that paragraph 74.
[1:39:20] he says when they organized god laid it
[1:39:24] on the shelf
[1:39:26] and that's where it went it stayed
[1:39:29] from then on
[1:39:31] they growed in number
[1:39:33] but never walk
[1:39:34] walking
[1:39:36] of this
[1:39:37] awakening of the spirit of god never no
[1:39:40] more
[1:39:41] they grew in numbers but the awakening
[1:39:45] of the spirit of god was never
[1:39:48] no more
[1:39:50] so what is the
[1:39:52] point that he's trying to bring to us is
[1:39:56] the awakening
[1:39:59] of the spirit
[1:40:01] of god
[1:40:04] he says
[1:40:05] moab here is a type of such because they
[1:40:08] are organized nation
[1:40:11] and in their own land
[1:40:13] like their own denomination
[1:40:15] and they had their own religion
[1:40:18] and their religion was the same religion
[1:40:20] that israel had and the moabites
[1:40:23] and believed in jehovah god but there
[1:40:26] was an organized group of people
[1:40:30] now
[1:40:31] we're not talking about the organization
[1:40:33] out there we're talking about the
[1:40:35] organization of our own lives
[1:40:38] what we believe what we think how we
[1:40:41] live our particular lifestyle and that
[1:40:43] now cannot be moved
[1:40:47] it can't be awakened
[1:40:51] that's been closed out
[1:40:55] he says now
[1:40:57] they represented the natural church
[1:41:00] and israel represented the spiritual
[1:41:03] church in its journey
[1:41:06] in its journey we're going to draw this
[1:41:08] little parallel here in a second
[1:41:10] but one's on a journey right
[1:41:14] and one is settled down
[1:41:18] he kept
[1:41:19] on its journey now israel was not an
[1:41:22] organized nation
[1:41:24] as long as they followed god
[1:41:26] they were independent
[1:41:29] they come up so journey
[1:41:31] no place to go
[1:41:33] wherever the pillar of fire went they
[1:41:36] went with it
[1:41:38] they were not an organized organizat
[1:41:43] they were not an organized nation
[1:41:46] they had an
[1:41:47] organism among them because of
[1:41:50] circumcision gave them that under time
[1:41:57] search him gave them that under the
[1:42:00] commandment of god but never an
[1:42:02] organized nation at this time
[1:42:06] but listen when they finally became an
[1:42:10] organized nation
[1:42:12] that's where they fell
[1:42:14] and rejected
[1:42:16] their messiah
[1:42:19] now think of that
[1:42:21] way back then when they finally decided
[1:42:24] we're going to have a king
[1:42:28] you know instead of the spiritual
[1:42:30] leadership of god through a
[1:42:32] prophet we're going to have a king we're
[1:42:35] going to get a sanhedrin we're going to
[1:42:37] get pharisees and scribes we're going to
[1:42:40] do this we're going to do that way back
[1:42:43] there they rejected
[1:42:45] the messiah that's when they rejected
[1:42:48] him they didn't reject them when he came
[1:42:51] what happens was they already put in
[1:42:54] their life the organizational system
[1:42:58] that couldn't be moved and that's where
[1:43:01] they rejected him
[1:43:05] so it was the condition that they were
[1:43:09] in
[1:43:10] that caused them to
[1:43:12] reject
[1:43:15] the messiah
[1:43:18] so they they had already
[1:43:21] rejected
[1:43:24] the moving of the holy spirit
[1:43:27] and the spirit of god through a prophet
[1:43:30] changing them
[1:43:34] so they'd set up their systems they'd
[1:43:36] set up their viewpoints they have set up
[1:43:38] what they felt was righteousness and now
[1:43:41] they were locked within that boundary
[1:43:44] now became subject to that thinking
[1:43:46] subject to that system subject to that
[1:43:49] organization so when something came up
[1:43:52] that was outside of it
[1:43:57] they had no room for it
[1:43:59] because they didn't feel they needed to
[1:44:02] change
[1:44:04] we have moses
[1:44:09] we have the law
[1:44:11] we have the teachings
[1:44:13] we follow moses
[1:44:15] who do you follow i do nothing unless my
[1:44:18] father reveals it to me
[1:44:22] there was a clash
[1:44:25] there was a conflict
[1:44:29] because they they made a they had made a
[1:44:32] substitution
[1:44:35] and what did they
[1:44:38] substitute it with
[1:44:42] so they had to have something right
[1:44:46] so they had to replace it
[1:44:49] because every time the spiritual comes
[1:44:52] there's a clash
[1:44:57] so when the lord came
[1:45:00] there was a clash
[1:45:02] he took a whip into their temple
[1:45:05] he said you are your father's the devil
[1:45:08] and they what did they go to don't they
[1:45:10] went to justifying themselves they went
[1:45:13] in to talk about the law of the prophets
[1:45:15] they began to defend their religion
[1:45:19] because they didn't want i thought what
[1:45:22] my brother mike was sharing was
[1:45:24] another little sign that this was they
[1:45:27] didn't want to go through any internal
[1:45:30] conflict or questioning
[1:45:32] but what did he challenge them to do
[1:45:35] search the scripture
[1:45:40] search the scripture
[1:45:42] what does the word of god say
[1:45:46] but they they didn't want
[1:45:49] to go through the process
[1:45:53] because they weren't sure
[1:45:56] what the result would be
[1:45:59] but let me tell you if it's god the
[1:46:02] result's always better
[1:46:07] god wants to make an attitude adjustment
[1:46:10] or a lifestyle adjustment or have you
[1:46:12] sacrificed something that you've built
[1:46:15] for years and years and maybe a business
[1:46:17] maybe something that but so that you can
[1:46:20] fulfill the word of god you watch
[1:46:22] yourself
[1:46:27] you try to dim that voice lower and
[1:46:30] lower and lower
[1:46:32] and you fill it up with
[1:46:33] self-righteousness and what you're doing
[1:46:36] and how much money you give and and what
[1:46:38] you support
[1:46:43] god didn't ask you to be a testimony
[1:46:46] to believers
[1:46:51] he asked you to be a testimony to
[1:46:53] unbelievers
[1:46:56] and the only true testament you can have
[1:46:59] is that you live by god's word
[1:47:03] amen so
[1:47:04] in
[1:47:06] i thought this was uh
[1:47:08] beautiful in
[1:47:10] paragraph 88
[1:47:12] and 89 beginning to explain what they
[1:47:16] substituted
[1:47:19] what god had called them to do with
[1:47:25] so they had to do something so what it
[1:47:28] is
[1:47:29] when israel rejected
[1:47:31] and took on and rejected the prophet
[1:47:34] and the leadership of the spirit and
[1:47:37] built their organization what now became
[1:47:40] their defense
[1:47:42] we have
[1:47:43] works
[1:47:48] we wash pots we wash pans we do all
[1:47:52] these things all those things that the
[1:47:54] lord just came out and said you do all
[1:47:56] these things
[1:47:58] but it's righteousness
[1:48:00] god wanted to lead his people
[1:48:03] the people want to lead themselves
[1:48:09] that's the eternal conflict
[1:48:11] that's the inner clash
[1:48:14] is between you leading yourself and god
[1:48:17] leading you
[1:48:20] and every time i want to lead myself i
[1:48:23] find lots of scriptures
[1:48:27] and lots of quotes
[1:48:30] to back myself up
[1:48:42] let's just read and we'll move along
[1:48:48] so
[1:48:49] when when korah listed moses it says god
[1:48:52] said separate yourself from he had
[1:48:54] enough of it and he swallowed him up in
[1:48:58] the earth see there was a clash
[1:49:02] when the carnal and the spiritual meets
[1:49:05] there is always a clash
[1:49:07] when judas meant jesus there was a clash
[1:49:11] one the son of god
[1:49:13] the other one the son of satan
[1:49:16] just like cain and abel
[1:49:18] and
[1:49:19] there was a clash when they met
[1:49:22] one of them was the treasurer of the
[1:49:24] church the other one a pastor
[1:49:28] and as now
[1:49:30] we come in this day the same thing again
[1:49:35] so we're talking about an understanding
[1:49:38] so it behooves us if we're on the same
[1:49:40] journey to understand we're gonna
[1:49:43] we're on the same path to understand
[1:49:46] we're gonna have the same conflicts
[1:49:50] because remember god couldn't do one
[1:49:52] thing to one person
[1:49:54] and if they meant the qualifications not
[1:49:57] do the same thing because god cannot
[1:49:59] change his mind about his word and no
[1:50:02] more can he award you for something
[1:50:06] if you didn't have to go through the
[1:50:08] same thing the other person did in order
[1:50:11] to receive the award
[1:50:14] i thought of that about the boston
[1:50:16] marathon all the time in the bathtub
[1:50:18] marathon there's all kinds of people
[1:50:21] that jump into the race in the middle of
[1:50:24] the race
[1:50:28] hundreds of them
[1:50:30] they got to call them out
[1:50:32] every year there's somebody that jumps
[1:50:34] in there and he's all fresh and he runs
[1:50:36] down there over the finish line before
[1:50:39] everybody else and everybody's cheering
[1:50:43] there's no reward
[1:50:47] because they didn't take the same
[1:50:49] journey
[1:50:50] so if we think that we're going to sit
[1:50:53] back
[1:50:54] because we recognize the pillar of fire
[1:50:57] and we recognize the cloud and we've
[1:51:00] seen vindications and think that that is
[1:51:03] an exit from the journey then we're
[1:51:05] deceiving ourselves
[1:51:10] and let me tell you the prophet of god
[1:51:12] went through
[1:51:14] all the things he preached he went
[1:51:16] through them by experience
[1:51:21] so he just didn't get a sermon out of
[1:51:23] the sky
[1:51:29] he suffered for the things that he spoke
[1:51:36] and there was a clash when they met
[1:51:39] he said
[1:51:41] and
[1:51:42] and as now
[1:51:43] we come in this day the same thing again
[1:51:47] the carnal denomination
[1:51:49] then the carnal denomination to the
[1:51:52] spiritual bride of christ
[1:51:56] that's the clash
[1:51:58] the carnal denomination
[1:52:00] not baptist
[1:52:02] not methodist
[1:52:04] even the carnal denomination the
[1:52:07] groups of people
[1:52:10] coming up with the same interpretation
[1:52:12] the same thinking the same thought
[1:52:14] process the same works the same form
[1:52:17] of worship
[1:52:19] and doing it as a group
[1:52:21] and relying on one another for
[1:52:24] vindication and patting one another on
[1:52:27] the back
[1:52:29] did i make that clear
[1:52:34] he said the carnal denomination to the
[1:52:38] spiritual bride of christ the spiritual
[1:52:40] bride of christ is so
[1:52:43] much different
[1:52:45] from the carnal organization there is no
[1:52:49] comparison at all
[1:52:55] i can't believe how that we as the
[1:52:58] members of the bride
[1:53:01] are being so influenced
[1:53:06] we've got titles now
[1:53:10] senior pastors
[1:53:12] you know associate pastors we we've got
[1:53:15] we've got all the things we pattern we
[1:53:18] have to have we have to have
[1:53:21] uh uh seminars
[1:53:26] i talked with someone the other day
[1:53:28] about marriage why don't i have a a a
[1:53:32] little seminar for married couples
[1:53:37] really oh
[1:53:42] are we all going to find a way to do it
[1:53:45] the same way to be married the same way
[1:53:48] to treat your wife
[1:53:54] individual
[1:53:56] we build that
[1:53:57] we work that out
[1:54:00] the holy spirit's all the holy spirit
[1:54:03] is your counselor
[1:54:06] i will not leave you comfortless but
[1:54:08] i'll come again i'll lead and guide you
[1:54:10] in all truth and righteousness why are
[1:54:12] you separating
[1:54:14] your prayer closet and just being
[1:54:17] christian and get getting back you want
[1:54:19] the best way to have a good marriage be
[1:54:22] a christian
[1:54:23] you be a christian in yourself
[1:54:27] you turn the other cheek you go the
[1:54:30] escrow mile you lay for yourselves a
[1:54:32] pattern of good words what people do is
[1:54:34] they look out here to all this fairy
[1:54:36] tale stuff the prophet of god said the
[1:54:39] trouble with the church is they read too
[1:54:40] many love
[1:54:46] magazines
[1:54:48] amen not the way it is
[1:54:52] you know what the prophet god said
[1:54:54] he gave one of the greatest marriage
[1:54:57] counseling
[1:54:58] seminars ever
[1:55:01] in one little sermon
[1:55:06] he said this couple had divorced
[1:55:10] now they came down to where they were
[1:55:12] separating
[1:55:15] the goods
[1:55:18] i hope you never have to go there
[1:55:23] because greed
[1:55:24] breeds hatred
[1:55:26] and hatred
[1:55:28] breeds vile actions
[1:55:33] and so they were there and they said you
[1:55:35] take this okay you i want this okay and
[1:55:38] finally got to the bottom of the box and
[1:55:41] there was a baby shoe
[1:55:46] and they both reached out
[1:55:48] and they laid their hands on that baby
[1:55:51] shoe
[1:55:53] and all of a sudden
[1:55:55] they went back
[1:55:57] to the beginning
[1:56:02] and what it was that attracted them to
[1:56:05] each other
[1:56:06] what it was they had
[1:56:10] most people can't fix
[1:56:13] the situations they're in the fussing
[1:56:15] the arguing and everything because
[1:56:17] they're trying to fix it now instead of
[1:56:20] going back to the beginning
[1:56:22] so when god wanted to fix your life what
[1:56:25] did he do he took you all the way back
[1:56:28] to the beginning where you were in his
[1:56:30] mind
[1:56:36] that's the way you fix it
[1:56:40] you talk to one another
[1:56:45] i thought what mike said was so good
[1:56:47] sometimes we fail to have the courage
[1:56:51] just to get alone
[1:56:53] and face
[1:56:55] we'd rather have
[1:56:58] our
[1:56:59] our own
[1:57:01] comfort zone
[1:57:02] i believe he placed it
[1:57:05] like that
[1:57:06] sometimes just a good straight talk
[1:57:08] helps
[1:57:12] if you're feeling left lonely
[1:57:15] if you feel that your husband's always
[1:57:17] out with the boys and i'm a big preacher
[1:57:20] of lifetime
[1:57:22] wt
[1:57:29] because i know what it's like
[1:57:31] to leave a wife at home for 10 years
[1:57:35] and her just be a christian
[1:57:40] i know what it's like
[1:57:42] i know it's like to have the holy spirit
[1:57:44] bring you under so much conviction
[1:57:47] and he says
[1:57:49] husbands
[1:57:50] love your wife
[1:57:51] as christ loved the church
[1:57:57] that's more marriage counseling and
[1:57:58] you'll ever get
[1:58:01] i can tell you men are from mars and
[1:58:03] women are from venus and women are
[1:58:06] gatherers and men are hunters and all
[1:58:09] that psychology
[1:58:15] just a little bit of honesty
[1:58:19] a little bit say you know i don't think
[1:58:20] you treat me right
[1:58:24] a little bit of prayed up
[1:58:27] you know that that's that's what changes
[1:58:30] things
[1:58:32] but if you lock yourself all up
[1:58:35] and nothing can move on your spirit and
[1:58:38] nothing can move on your senses and you
[1:58:40] could all stubborn believe it or not you
[1:58:42] have a denomination going on within
[1:58:44] yourself because you have barriers and
[1:58:47] borders and lines which you will not
[1:58:50] cross
[1:58:53] and you go into the defense mode
[1:58:59] and what comes with that accusations
[1:59:02] and finger pointing
[1:59:05] which we we've just all went through
[1:59:09] so that's why because we have something
[1:59:12] to guide us
[1:59:14] and it's the spirit of god
[1:59:17] just like you men should know how to if
[1:59:20] you're you're dating or you're courting
[1:59:22] or whatever you call it or you're going
[1:59:24] to have a cup of coffee uh with a sister
[1:59:27] to find out if you even interested in oh
[1:59:30] i know that ain't mentioned teaching but
[1:59:32] that's why we got so many messed up
[1:59:34] relationships in this message
[1:59:38] brother branham dated
[1:59:46] he did
[1:59:47] you can go get the generations book
[1:59:50] there's a sister in that book i'll call
[1:59:52] her a sister she may not look like you
[1:59:54] think she ought to look
[1:59:58] but she said brother abraham took me out
[2:00:01] and he treated me like a gentleman
[2:00:08] no little in the windows
[2:00:11] no little tensions of personal
[2:00:15] desires overruling your common sense
[2:00:19] am i preaching too straight
[2:00:24] i don't care about the do you understand
[2:00:26] i'm i'm only concerned about my flock
[2:00:29] i'm not trying to preach a message to
[2:00:31] the world
[2:00:33] i want us to be everything that god
[2:00:37] wants us to do
[2:00:40] that they were a thing
[2:00:42] but you know how to act as a christian
[2:00:45] you sisters know how to act
[2:00:48] and again
[2:00:50] i preach and i'll keep preaching it
[2:00:52] until it doesn't exist but gossip is a
[2:00:55] terrible thing to the church
[2:00:59] sharing your opinions about somebody
[2:01:01] with one another thinking that god cares
[2:01:05] what you think
[2:01:07] or trying to advertise what you know
[2:01:09] about somebody
[2:01:11] well i happen to know
[2:01:16] well let me tell you something you
[2:01:17] better be careful because if that's
[2:01:19] under the blood
[2:01:21] you've just opened the door for that
[2:01:23] spirit to come into your life
[2:01:28] so there's no comparison
[2:01:30] he says now listen to 89 now notice
[2:01:33] the natural always tries to type the
[2:01:37] spiritual
[2:01:39] but as
[2:01:41] jacob and esau
[2:01:42] it will not work
[2:01:45] it would not
[2:01:47] now when it come to doing good works
[2:01:52] i believe that esau actually was a
[2:01:54] better man than jacob
[2:01:57] so what are we talking about when the
[2:01:59] spirit's rejected
[2:02:02] what do we substitute it with
[2:02:06] works
[2:02:08] or a covering
[2:02:10] religion is a covering
[2:02:14] look he said
[2:02:16] and now when it come to doing good works
[2:02:18] i believe esau was a better man than
[2:02:21] jacob in the sight of men
[2:02:25] in the sight of men
[2:02:27] he tried to take care of his daddy
[2:02:30] he was blind a prophet
[2:02:32] and all those things that he tried to do
[2:02:36] but yet esau didn't think about that
[2:02:40] being just carnal works
[2:02:43] he didn't think
[2:02:45] it was carnal works
[2:02:47] he thought it was accounted to him for
[2:02:50] what
[2:02:51] righteousness
[2:02:56] now this is a conflict
[2:02:58] because when we go to defend ourselves
[2:03:01] we start looking at our works we start
[2:03:03] looking at our dresses we start looking
[2:03:05] at what we go to church we start looking
[2:03:07] all those things now we start
[2:03:09] attributing that back to ourselves as
[2:03:12] righteousness i'm going because i
[2:03:15] believe the message no you're not
[2:03:18] you're going because your name was
[2:03:20] written on the lamb's book of life
[2:03:24] and i wonder if there's so maybe
[2:03:26] somebody out there's names on the lamb's
[2:03:28] book of life that never came to this
[2:03:30] revelation
[2:03:32] not my call
[2:03:36] listen beautiful
[2:03:42] all the things that he tried to do
[2:03:46] but yet esau didn't think
[2:03:48] about that being just carnal works
[2:03:52] he thought he could get in
[2:03:55] by what he done
[2:03:57] doing something good for somebody
[2:04:00] which was all right
[2:04:02] that's how he thought he could get in
[2:04:08] he never looked it at his carnal works
[2:04:12] but now but jacob
[2:04:14] his whole soul
[2:04:16] was to get that birth right
[2:04:19] and that's what god recognized in him
[2:04:23] spiritually
[2:04:25] oh
[2:04:26] my goodness
[2:04:28] what a what a a great thing so we see
[2:04:31] this great clash
[2:04:33] he says and and so every time that
[2:04:37] that
[2:04:38] the carnal comes along what it's trying
[2:04:41] to do
[2:04:42] he said it's trying to destroy the
[2:04:44] influence
[2:04:46] of the spirit on you
[2:04:49] another satan is continually trying to
[2:04:53] destroy the influence
[2:04:56] of your election
[2:04:58] on you
[2:05:04] he don't want you to rest on just the
[2:05:06] fact i'm elected
[2:05:07] my name's on the lamb's book of life
[2:05:12] god's able to perform
[2:05:14] that which he promised
[2:05:16] if my name's on the lamb's book of life
[2:05:19] and god elected me he can surely mold me
[2:05:22] and make me and finish the work that he
[2:05:25] started
[2:05:26] hallelujah
[2:05:36] and this is in
[2:05:38] uh
[2:05:41] paragraph
[2:05:44] 91
[2:05:46] so we see god does not forever change
[2:05:50] his mind about his original word
[2:05:54] but who he calls
[2:05:56] that's who he ordains
[2:05:59] and no one else can take that place
[2:06:03] no
[2:06:04] no one could take moses's place
[2:06:07] no matter how many korahs rised up how
[2:06:09] many dathans
[2:06:11] it was moses
[2:06:13] god had called regardless
[2:06:16] but if the people won't walk
[2:06:19] in his perfect will
[2:06:21] he does have a permissive will
[2:06:24] he'll let you walk in
[2:06:27] notice he permits it all right
[2:06:31] but he will make it work out for his
[2:06:34] glory
[2:06:35] in his perfect will
[2:06:39] now if you'd like
[2:06:40] just like
[2:06:42] in the
[2:06:43] we won't go there let's go down to
[2:06:44] paragraph 95.
[2:06:47] he says now therefore god never changes
[2:06:49] his mind about anything but he will
[2:06:52] permit you to go on
[2:06:55] now this is a long way around to get to
[2:06:59] what i want to say here about this
[2:07:03] but
[2:07:04] i want you to understand it see god will
[2:07:07] permit you to do something
[2:07:10] and even bless you in doing it
[2:07:13] but it still
[2:07:15] isn't his perfect
[2:07:17] will
[2:07:21] 98
[2:07:23] he permits it as i said
[2:07:26] but he
[2:07:27] he will not let it be his perfect will
[2:07:31] but he'll make it work to honor and
[2:07:34] bless his perfect will
[2:07:36] and childbearing by sex is one of that
[2:07:41] so it never was god's original plan
[2:07:43] but he's still
[2:07:45] working it
[2:07:46] to his perfect will to bring forth his
[2:07:49] elected children
[2:07:52] he says notice being with it was an ill
[2:07:55] illegitimate nation
[2:07:57] it started out illegitimate
[2:08:00] by
[2:08:01] a father
[2:08:03] believer and a daughter
[2:08:05] believer
[2:08:06] oh i could go into that but i better
[2:08:09] stay away
[2:08:13] let me say it this way a lot of people
[2:08:15] have preacher religion
[2:08:20] they've accepted the way the preacher
[2:08:22] brings it
[2:08:23] they accept what he says i would
[2:08:27] implore you
[2:08:28] to anything that you hear me say go
[2:08:31] challenge it by the word of god and by
[2:08:35] prayer
[2:08:38] don't just accept it
[2:08:41] on the basis of the fellowship
[2:08:45] or on a personality
[2:08:49] don't accept the organize
[2:08:52] organized approach god builds his church
[2:08:55] on divine revelation
[2:09:00] if some if a preacher preaches a seed
[2:09:03] right one watereth
[2:09:06] right one planet one watereth but god
[2:09:10] gives the revelation
[2:09:13] and lucas reed as we'll
[2:09:15] close up real quick now
[2:09:18] and that's the way the church started
[2:09:20] that's the way it started at nicea rome
[2:09:23] when the roman catholic church
[2:09:26] at the very beginning
[2:09:28] where
[2:09:29] come
[2:09:30] where it come from
[2:09:32] was pentecost
[2:09:34] but when they organized and brought it
[2:09:36] into celebrities into the church they
[2:09:40] started
[2:09:41] to they started making having prayers
[2:09:45] running beads
[2:09:47] praying for the dead
[2:09:48] and all those other things
[2:09:51] then it just started rolling
[2:09:54] from one air to another
[2:09:56] one heir to another
[2:09:58] until look where it's gone to
[2:10:02] it's not one representation of pentecost
[2:10:06] in it at all see
[2:10:08] it's one air picking up another picking
[2:10:12] up another there is
[2:10:14] only one thing
[2:10:17] to do
[2:10:18] and that's clean off the record and go
[2:10:22] back to the beginning
[2:10:27] don't you understand that's what god did
[2:10:30] with this message there was only one way
[2:10:33] to fix it
[2:10:34] that was to clean it all off
[2:10:37] and take it back to the beginning that's
[2:10:40] what the seals did
[2:10:44] it opened it up and took it back to the
[2:10:46] beginning and we're just we just got
[2:10:48] just uh one more
[2:10:50] uh
[2:10:52] we'll just close with this and we can
[2:10:54] always
[2:10:55] pick it up later
[2:10:57] and this is just at the end of that
[2:11:02] paragraph he said
[2:11:04] israel represents the spiritual church
[2:11:07] israel was the church true
[2:11:11] and was the bride of that day called out
[2:11:14] of egypt and vindicated to the truth
[2:11:20] now we'll read this and we'll stop with
[2:11:23] this thought this morning
[2:11:26] notice
[2:11:27] when
[2:11:28] when them two comes together
[2:11:31] both of them offered the same sacrifice
[2:11:36] both built
[2:11:39] saw seven altars
[2:11:41] both offered up
[2:11:43] clean sacrificed
[2:11:45] ox
[2:11:47] they even offered up rams testifying
[2:11:51] that there was a coming messiah
[2:11:54] fundamentally
[2:11:56] they were both exactly the same
[2:12:00] israel down here in the valley
[2:12:03] moab
[2:12:04] up on the hill
[2:12:06] and moabs had seven altars israel had
[2:12:09] seven altars
[2:12:10] moab had seven ox israel with seven ox
[2:12:15] moab with seven rams speaking of the
[2:12:18] coming messiah israel had seven rams
[2:12:21] what was the difference
[2:12:24] in them
[2:12:27] so one of them
[2:12:28] has substituted something
[2:12:33] you understand they substituted words
[2:12:36] they've substituted something so this is
[2:12:38] where they came to
[2:12:40] they've got everything fundamentally the
[2:12:44] same
[2:12:45] we all believe in the same jesus we all
[2:12:47] believe in calvary we all have all these
[2:12:49] things they're all the same
[2:12:51] and listen as our our messenger
[2:12:55] points it out
[2:12:57] what was the difference in them
[2:12:58] fundamentally both right
[2:13:02] but you see moab did not
[2:13:05] have a vindication of god with them
[2:13:10] they were only a nation of groups of
[2:13:13] celebrities
[2:13:15] now we know they went out and rented a
[2:13:17] profit
[2:13:25] they did
[2:13:26] a rent a profit
[2:13:30] wait a minute
[2:13:31] we ran a prophet
[2:13:34] we only get
[2:13:35] what
[2:13:36] we want to hear
[2:13:40] we don't take it all
[2:13:42] we just borrow
[2:13:45] little sections from it
[2:13:51] and we've got our celebrities
[2:13:55] but israel had a prophet with them
[2:14:00] they had a smitten wrong with them
[2:14:04] they had a pillar of fire
[2:14:06] they had a brass serpent for healing
[2:14:09] they had the blessings of god moving
[2:14:13] right along with them
[2:14:16] and they was the called out children of
[2:14:19] god
[2:14:20] isn't that the perfect type of the bride
[2:14:24] remember we're elected look at what we
[2:14:27] have with us
[2:14:29] we've got the pillar of fire
[2:14:32] we've got a cloud
[2:14:35] we've had divine healing signs and
[2:14:38] wonders a real genuine word prophet that
[2:14:41] stays with the word of god
[2:14:43] another we're absolutely a perfect type
[2:14:51] the perfect type
[2:14:53] of of
[2:14:56] israel
[2:14:57] on the journey
[2:14:58] everything they had to make the journey
[2:15:02] we have to make the journey
[2:15:06] so they're the
[2:15:08] so what made moab
[2:15:12] a denomination
[2:15:15] and an organization and israel not
[2:15:19] so what would be the difference for us
[2:15:23] having all the same things
[2:15:26] that would stop us from being an
[2:15:28] organization now this was individual now
[2:15:32] so what would stop me
[2:15:34] from being an organization
[2:15:37] i've got everything everybody else has
[2:15:41] everything they claim to have
[2:15:44] how many you've ever heard people look
[2:15:46] you in the faith say
[2:15:48] well we just take the bible
[2:15:52] we just take jesus
[2:15:57] i've had him say i'm a red letter
[2:16:00] christian
[2:16:03] i only take the red letter
[2:16:05] and then when they want to argue a point
[2:16:08] they don't give me one red light or
[2:16:09] they're all over paul
[2:16:18] i mean
[2:16:20] but because it's a spirit
[2:16:22] you see
[2:16:24] they go in defense mode
[2:16:29] they're going to defend
[2:16:33] because they got a characteristic
[2:16:37] about them
[2:16:38] can moab had an outstanding
[2:16:41] characteristic
[2:16:43] now remember what he wanted is he wanted
[2:16:46] israel not to go through his land
[2:16:49] just go someplace else go around leave
[2:16:52] us
[2:16:53] alone
[2:16:55] because you lick up
[2:16:58] the ground
[2:17:00] well that's what the word of god does it
[2:17:02] licks up your own ideas it devours your
[2:17:06] own self-righteousness
[2:17:09] it conforms you into the image of
[2:17:12] christ but they didn't want none of that
[2:17:16] he says
[2:17:18] he said
[2:17:20] though it was a type
[2:17:22] he says
[2:17:23] they moved right along he said
[2:17:26] they had a spin rock and
[2:17:29] and they was the called out children of
[2:17:32] god so they had the blessings of god
[2:17:36] moving
[2:17:37] right along
[2:17:39] with them
[2:17:41] emphasis on moving
[2:17:43] and they was the called out children of
[2:17:46] god perfect type of the bride in malachi
[2:17:48] 4 5. i i said that
[2:17:51] now we find that so perfectly typed here
[2:17:56] in them churches
[2:17:58] of today
[2:18:00] as moab
[2:18:02] was
[2:18:03] not
[2:18:04] so
[2:18:05] israel was sojourner
[2:18:09] from place to place
[2:18:11] wherever the pillar of fire moved
[2:18:14] they moved with it
[2:18:16] moab
[2:18:18] not so
[2:18:19] they were settled down in their
[2:18:21] denomination
[2:18:23] down
[2:18:25] they were settled down in their own
[2:18:28] denomination
[2:18:30] down in their own nation they didn't
[2:18:34] moved they stayed right
[2:18:37] there
[2:18:40] that became the final definition
[2:18:44] they wouldn't move
[2:18:49] they settled down they built their
[2:18:52] lifestyle
[2:18:54] they built their righteousness
[2:18:57] they built their interpretation
[2:19:00] they looked so close
[2:19:03] it would deceive the very elected if
[2:19:07] possible
[2:19:08] but the thing that they wouldn't do is
[2:19:11] they wouldn't allow the spirit of god to
[2:19:15] move them
[2:19:19] to lead them
[2:19:21] to make changes in their personality to
[2:19:24] make changes in their approach to make
[2:19:27] changes in their lifestyle
[2:19:30] they wouldn't even question
[2:19:34] or allow
[2:19:36] the spirit of god
[2:19:38] when jesus said search the scriptures
[2:19:42] for in them you think you have eternal
[2:19:44] life but they testify of me
[2:19:48] so they they they got set
[2:19:53] no no new revelation
[2:19:55] no greater understanding in the word of
[2:19:58] god
[2:20:00] they understood
[2:20:03] that this is what we believe
[2:20:06] it's like saying we have the storehouse
[2:20:09] we know what's in there
[2:20:11] but we're not going to eat thereof
[2:20:16] it might change my spiritual approach
[2:20:19] it might change the way that i worship
[2:20:22] i've i've so taken
[2:20:25] so many
[2:20:26] things to fortify and interpretations to
[2:20:30] fortify the place that i'm staying in
[2:20:33] that i'm going to stay put
[2:20:40] i don't want
[2:20:41] anything
[2:20:42] that's going to change
[2:20:45] me
[2:20:47] i don't want to pray about it
[2:20:51] i don't want to get alone with god
[2:20:54] and have him speak
[2:20:57] so instead of that personal
[2:21:00] opening of the word to me
[2:21:04] i'm going to take the consensus
[2:21:09] and without realizing it
[2:21:13] we have that same internal conflict in
[2:21:16] us
[2:21:18] when god wants to change us
[2:21:21] change our heart
[2:21:23] maybe change the way we view for
[2:21:25] somebody
[2:21:26] maybe take someone that you've got such
[2:21:28] a perfect grudge against
[2:21:30] and you've got so much history
[2:21:34] on all the evil they've done
[2:21:39] and you've closed off your heart
[2:21:42] and you closed up your fellowship
[2:21:45] and the holy spirit's like that dove
[2:21:48] trying to get in
[2:21:50] and make that heart right
[2:21:53] put the love of god in there
[2:21:57] now i have quotes that i could read that
[2:22:00] are very similar to this
[2:22:03] that that you have such compassion for
[2:22:06] that person you can look back and say
[2:22:09] well they look at they were just in they
[2:22:11] were young back then they didn't know
[2:22:16] okay and and you're willing just to
[2:22:19] forgive and the holy spirit's there
[2:22:21] trying to melt your heart take that
[2:22:24] stony heart out of you put it in the
[2:22:26] flesh though your sins be crimson i'll
[2:22:30] make it white as snow and that's and and
[2:22:33] so he wants you to love somebody
[2:22:36] the same way that he loved you
[2:22:41] forgiving you of all unrighteousness
[2:22:44] teach us to pray our father without in
[2:22:47] heaven forgive us our trespasses
[2:22:50] as we forgive those who trespass against
[2:22:53] us
[2:22:55] no it doesn't matter if they change
[2:23:03] because you're not looking for an effect
[2:23:06] you're not looking for a favorable
[2:23:09] outcome to you
[2:23:14] that's what people think if i could get
[2:23:16] him straightened up or her straighten up
[2:23:18] it sure make my life look easier
[2:23:24] well maybe if you changed
[2:23:27] it would make your life easier too
[2:23:33] but watch
[2:23:34] watch what he's saying here
[2:23:40] he's saying the difference is one
[2:23:42] wouldn't move
[2:23:46] they weren't ready to accept anything
[2:23:49] any new teaching any more growth
[2:23:52] any more change in their attitude no
[2:23:55] change in the path that they've already
[2:23:58] pro
[2:23:59] predicted and chose to pursue
[2:24:05] this is the way i'm going
[2:24:10] that god couldn't even stand in their
[2:24:12] path with a mule
[2:24:16] they're sad
[2:24:20] and that became
[2:24:23] the identification
[2:24:27] of the organized church
[2:24:31] unable to move outside of the boundaries
[2:24:36] that they placed in their life
[2:24:39] and no more could god speak to him or
[2:24:42] give them revelation
[2:24:44] or enlighten them
[2:24:48] as
[2:24:50] we
[2:24:51] act as we read that that
[2:24:54] that statement
[2:24:56] is that
[2:24:57] i i believe
[2:24:59] uh
[2:25:00] there there was
[2:25:02] no
[2:25:03] wanting or no growing
[2:25:08] they were there
[2:25:12] they were stuck
[2:25:15] and that's what he said
[2:25:18] he said
[2:25:20] they were settled down in their own
[2:25:22] denomination in their own nation they
[2:25:25] didn't move
[2:25:26] they stayed right there
[2:25:28] they had their celebrities they
[2:25:30] organized things as they should do
[2:25:34] and they had their warriors
[2:25:37] they had their fighters
[2:25:39] they had their king
[2:25:41] they they they got their orders
[2:25:44] from so and so
[2:25:46] but noah moab seen israel with something
[2:25:50] they didn't have they seen the mighty
[2:25:53] power amongst israel
[2:25:55] and it was a prophet
[2:25:57] and that prophet was moses
[2:25:59] and they knowed that when the battle
[2:26:01] went wrong
[2:26:03] they just raised up
[2:26:05] his hands and held them there and the
[2:26:08] battle changed
[2:26:10] so they didn't have such as that
[2:26:13] so they tried to match it with politics
[2:26:17] and with political pull they sent over
[2:26:20] to another country and hired a prophet
[2:26:23] to come over
[2:26:25] and so they could have a prophet
[2:26:28] and would have power amongst them just
[2:26:30] like israel had
[2:26:32] you see the carnal comparison
[2:26:35] can you see the carnal church today it's
[2:26:38] done
[2:26:39] the same thing
[2:26:42] and
[2:26:43] he says notice how the spiritual is
[2:26:45] applied to prove the natural way is
[2:26:49] wrong
[2:26:51] and
[2:26:52] we won't go
[2:26:53] farther because it'll take us a little
[2:26:55] longer
[2:26:56] but they said they sent israel over
[2:27:01] we do the same thing
[2:27:04] if we hear the lord speak to us we don't
[2:27:06] like it we go
[2:27:08] we stream to another place
[2:27:11] we go get another message
[2:27:14] we go searching until something comes
[2:27:17] that says it just the way
[2:27:20] but that's not what the church was built
[2:27:22] on
[2:27:23] we're built on spiritual divine
[2:27:25] revelation
[2:27:27] from god to each individual heart
[2:27:30] and god doesn't change his mind about
[2:27:33] his word he has not changed
[2:27:36] dealing with you
[2:27:38] as an individual
[2:27:40] and personally giving you
[2:27:42] divine revelation
[2:27:45] and dealing with your heart and changing
[2:27:48] you
[2:27:48] and molding you
[2:27:50] into what he
[2:27:52] wants you
[2:27:53] to be
[2:27:55] amen god bless you tomorrow with
[2:27:58] tonight's communion
[2:28:00] and you can
[2:28:01] take it from there
[2:28:05] god said come have communion so if
[2:28:07] you're streaming at home
[2:28:09] and you're not sick and
[2:28:12] and you haven't already made plans with
[2:28:15] the world
[2:28:17] come out to communion
[2:28:19] it's one of the three ordinances
[2:28:22] that god said that he would have to do
[2:28:25] if you don't like me i can understand
[2:28:28] that
[2:28:29] and you
[2:28:30] you don't
[2:28:32] like what we teach i can understand that
[2:28:34] also but
[2:28:36] don't not take communion
[2:28:39] so if you you can't
[2:28:43] do communion here
[2:28:44] go to the catholic church
[2:28:49] better than what you're doing
[2:28:52] why
[2:28:54] one form of adultery is as bad as
[2:28:56] another form of adultery
[2:29:01] you know i mean that
[2:29:03] what difference
[2:29:04] you know you're not gonna wash feet
[2:29:06] you're not going to take communion
[2:29:10] so do something
[2:29:14] wash one another's feet
[2:29:16] serve communion
[2:29:18] to one another
[2:29:20] but i i i
[2:29:24] feel
[2:29:25] that
[2:29:26] the statement that brother branham made
[2:29:30] in this
[2:29:31] message the very
[2:29:33] first statement
[2:29:35] that he made on this message
[2:29:38] is so very powerful
[2:29:41] if then i'd just like to say it as we
[2:29:43] turn the service to brother billy and
[2:29:46] the musicians come
[2:29:48] it says let us bow our heads
[2:29:52] dear lord jesus
[2:29:54] we are assembled again
[2:29:56] in your name
[2:29:58] with great expectation
[2:30:00] for the outpouring of the quickening
[2:30:03] power of god
[2:30:05] to bring us into
[2:30:09] recognition
[2:30:11] of our position and place
[2:30:14] and our responsibilities
[2:30:17] as being
[2:30:18] a called people
[2:30:20] separated from the world
[2:30:23] dedicated to god
[2:30:25] granted lord tonight
[2:30:27] that the blessings of god will guide us
[2:30:31] and direct us
[2:30:32] in the things
[2:30:34] we
[2:30:35] do or say
[2:30:37] that it might bring honor and glory
[2:30:41] to your name
[2:30:43] amen
[2:30:44] so we we've got some wonderful
[2:30:46] guidelines god's not going to change his
[2:30:49] mind about your election
[2:30:52] but he will work on your life
[2:30:55] to hit you where he wants you to be
[2:30:57] that's a blessing god bless you
[2:31:04] amen let's all stand
[2:31:10] creating
[2:31:13] a
