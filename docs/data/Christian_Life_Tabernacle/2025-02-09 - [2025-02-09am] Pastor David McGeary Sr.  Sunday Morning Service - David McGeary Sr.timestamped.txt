[52:41] and many times we don't know where it's
[52:44] leading us
[52:46] or and we find
[52:49] ourselves in times of quandry and
[52:53] wonderment

[52:58] what your way
[53:00] is and father we've come to sit down
[53:04] with you and have you speak to

[53:12] the lips of
[53:14] clay to
[53:16] rehearse the great things that were
[53:19] spoken in our age to guide us through
[53:22] these challenging times
[53:27] father we know our enemy appears as an
[53:31] angel of Light and we're living in the
[53:34] most deceptive age that there ever was
[53:38] father may we have our eyes annointed
[53:42] with isav this morning that we may
[53:46] see May our raint be white May our gold
[53:51] be tried in fire father that when it's

[54:04] crown that has been laid up for me we

[54:10] morning in Jesus precious name we pray
[54:15] amen and amen God bless you if you have
[54:18] your Bibles let's um turn over to First
[54:24] John um
[54:27] uh 1 John chapter 1 uh this morning um
[54:32] we we're going to listen to a little um
[54:37] portion of a message called uh the way
[54:41] to have
[54:43] fellowship and um so we'll we'll read
[54:46] our scripture and then uh we'll visit a
[54:49] little bit and start the the tape so
[54:52] let's read in first John chapter 1
[54:55] starting with the third
[54:59] verse and and this this should be what
[55:03] every
[55:04] believer uh can
[55:06] say that which we H have seen and heard
[55:12] declare we unto
[55:14] you that ye Also may have fellowship
[55:20] with
[55:20] us and truly our fellowship is with the
[55:25] father
[55:27] and with his son Jesus Christ and these
[55:32] things right we un to you that your joy
[55:37] may be
[55:39] full this this then is the message which
[55:44] we have heard of him and declare unto
[55:49] you that God is light and in him is no
[55:54] Darkness at all
[55:57] all if we say that we have fellowship
[56:01] with him and walk in
[56:04] darkness we lie and do not the truth but
[56:09] if we walk in the
[56:11] light as he is in the light we have
[56:16] Fellowship one with another and the
[56:20] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanse us
[56:25] from all sin Heavenly Father we ask you
[56:29] to bless your word in our precious name
[56:33] we pray amen God bless you you may be
[56:36] seated this
[56:42] morning you know I I guess as far as the
[56:46] city of bedford's concerned our
[56:50] construction project has come to an end
[56:54] as of last Friday we got our our uh we
[56:59] passed the our permit on the little uh
[57:03] storage building in the back and we got
[57:06] our permit on the Pavilion so now the
[57:11] pavilion's there to uh sit under if
[57:15] you'd like to fellowship and and and
[57:18] then we can have some uh we we we might
[57:22] have to have a uh a a barbecue out there
[57:26] a dedication
[57:28] barbecue and uh we'll get brother Tim to
[57:32] fire up the grill and cook those
[57:35] hamburgers and hot dogs for us and and
[57:38] as soon as we get a good day we'll just
[57:41] have a time of Fellowship out there and
[57:44] uh you know our goal is to try to keep
[57:47] uh the kids and everybody from standing
[57:50] in the the walkway the driveways out
[57:53] there with people backing up and uh I I
[57:57] know cuz I had an experience where I
[58:01] almost sent one of our children to
[58:03] heaven and uh you know uh it's not my
[58:07] job to send them it's his job to take
[58:09] them so we uh certainly want to keep the
[58:14] all that area uh clear so we we started
[58:19] the year uh talking about our path
[58:22] forward because that we've came to the
[58:25] place that we've uh finished uh the
[58:30] outside work we've finished the
[58:34] uh a building so to speak and uh whether
[58:38] we made it big enough or small enough it
[58:41] doesn't matter uh we know how to fit
[58:44] into a small space amen so we know uh we
[58:50] we we can move the pews up 6 in we can
[58:54] add another couple rows up up front we
[58:56] can add a row and back uh you know and
[59:00] then if we outgrow this uh I don't know
[59:05] I'm going to
[59:06] retire but I hope we do outgrow it to be
[59:09] honest with you I want like like John
[59:14] said he said those things which I have
[59:17] heard and those things which I have seen
[59:20] I declare unto you that you might have
[59:24] fellowship with us
[59:26] and and really that's what we're sharing
[59:29] we're not sharing that we're right and
[59:32] our Doctrine is right and and and you're
[59:37] wrong and we're not sharing you know God
[59:41] sent a prophet and if you don't believe
[59:44] them uh you
[59:46] know that's not what's in our hearts our
[59:52] heart is that if you could know the joy
[59:56] it's just like when the church went out
[59:58] and the restoration of gifts came in in
[1:00:02] in early
[1:00:04] Pentecost it those people had
[1:00:07] experienced an experience of the
[1:00:10] indwelling of the Holy Spirit and in
[1:00:14] that in that experience they had they
[1:00:18] felt a
[1:00:19] joy and they felt a seal they they felt
[1:00:24] something that they've never felt before
[1:00:26] for cuz they prayed for it and God heard
[1:00:29] their prayer and if you pray for a
[1:00:32] blessing of the Lord God will hear your
[1:00:35] prayer and they were so thrilled in
[1:00:38] their
[1:00:39] hearts that they went to share it but
[1:00:44] they they weren't sharing your
[1:00:46] lost they were sharing oh if you could
[1:00:50] taste the glory and the goodness of God
[1:00:55] and that that's what this message is to
[1:00:57] us it's the goodness of God it's it's so
[1:01:01] wonderful to have your eyes open and and
[1:01:05] to see that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:09] yesterday today and forever and that he
[1:01:12] is in our presence and that he wants to
[1:01:16] have fellowship with us and so we we
[1:01:21] completed and then we said what what
[1:01:23] were our desire of the path forward is
[1:01:28] is that we want to start working on the
[1:01:34] inside we finished the building now
[1:01:36] let's let's work on us the
[1:01:40] occupants uh let's each of us have a
[1:01:44] remodel you know what I mean a a
[1:01:48] rededication a a
[1:01:52] re-inspired that we can see things in a
[1:01:56] light that we've never seen them before
[1:01:59] that we we'll have a path forward uh in
[1:02:03] our personal lives so uh uh that uh that
[1:02:10] when we go out that our candle is truly
[1:02:13] lit and it's truly sitting on the
[1:02:16] hilltop and the the words of the Lord
[1:02:19] are on our lips and his praise is in our
[1:02:23] heart and that we're there's such an
[1:02:26] atmosphere about us that people long to
[1:02:31] have what you have the scripture says
[1:02:34] that they inquire of you what's this
[1:02:37] hope you have uh you know I I I kind of
[1:02:40] Marvel you know I was telling somebody
[1:02:43] uh it seems like uh you know some people
[1:02:46] oh they're they're they're so hopeful
[1:02:49] now that uh you know uh we have a
[1:02:52] president Donald Trump's president oh we
[1:02:55] have hope
[1:02:56] you know I thought you know it's like
[1:03:00] get ready to get thrown in
[1:03:02] prison you know the first cop comes in
[1:03:05] and he's the bad cop you know he
[1:03:08] threatens you and he's real rough and
[1:03:10] the second cop comes in and he's going
[1:03:13] to be your
[1:03:15] friend hey I'm your friend here I can
[1:03:18] make it easy on
[1:03:20] you you you know what I mean and he
[1:03:23] tries to whenn you over but the outcomes
[1:03:29] jail would you rather go to jail by the
[1:03:31] good cop or the bad cop well the
[1:03:34] outcome's hell that's
[1:03:37] right you know you could push one guy as
[1:03:41] the but it scares
[1:03:44] me you understand how blind people come
[1:03:48] so so now this we have somebody that
[1:03:50] talks about prosperity and and wealth
[1:03:57] well it's harder for a rich man to get
[1:04:00] into the Kingdom of Heaven than it is a
[1:04:02] camel to get to the eye of a needle and
[1:04:05] everybody's going praise God the economy
[1:04:07] is going to be here I'm going to be
[1:04:10] rich oh yeah okay it's just going to be
[1:04:13] harder for you to get into the kingdom
[1:04:16] more to distract
[1:04:19] you you know what I mean the love of
[1:04:22] money's always been the root of all all
[1:04:27] evil you know what I'm saying and so
[1:04:30] that's why we've got to put on our isav
[1:04:33] we got to have our spiritual goggles on
[1:04:36] we need this message more than ever and
[1:04:41] and so you know it's real simple to get
[1:04:42] all to think oh this is wonderful I like
[1:04:45] this his politics better than the other
[1:04:49] politics let me tell you something it's
[1:04:52] Wolves and sheep's clothing that's all
[1:04:56] it is it don't get your hopes up because
[1:05:01] you've got a guy that's going to do this
[1:05:05] or or going to do that uh it it's not
[1:05:08] for for me to say and uh uh you know I
[1:05:12] thought there was some crazy stuff going
[1:05:15] on on one side of the fence but there's
[1:05:18] crazy stuff going on in the other side
[1:05:20] of the fence there's only one place I
[1:05:22] know that's got the truth and that's the
[1:05:24] word of God and that's what we want to
[1:05:27] keep our hearts and our minds on
[1:05:30] so we're we our goal if I could say and
[1:05:35] we begin to ask ourselves this because I
[1:05:38] begin to realize this and I begin to see
[1:05:41] it among so many people that and even
[1:05:46] within our own framework this
[1:05:50] morning is that sometimes we feel like
[1:05:53] we follow the message
[1:05:56] you know what I mean and we believe the
[1:05:59] message but we don't belong to the
[1:06:03] body you know you understand this is
[1:06:06] where we go to church but we only go to
[1:06:10] church because brother brandom said to
[1:06:12] go to church on Sunday and so when we
[1:06:16] come to church we kind of come in and we
[1:06:19] already know what we believe and and
[1:06:22] we're already set in our ways and we've
[1:06:25] come in here we're going to spend the
[1:06:27] hour or two hours or whatever the
[1:06:30] preacher goes and and then we fulfilled
[1:06:33] that check off of off of the blank and
[1:06:37] then we go out and we we live our lives
[1:06:42] and and uh even Within Myself I I had
[1:06:46] that kind of framework of an attitude
[1:06:51] and I I realize really what God's
[1:06:53] wanting to do he's wanting to change the
[1:06:56] heart of the
[1:06:58] people and uh that's what that uh the
[1:07:04] message came for because the that's what
[1:07:06] people begin to do they begin to break
[1:07:10] up in groups and and they they they got
[1:07:14] away from fellowship real Fellowship
[1:07:18] real love one for
[1:07:20] another and and and a real
[1:07:23] caring and a a real uh basis for sharing
[1:07:29] one another's
[1:07:31] burdens and uh you know we're we've got
[1:07:34] an extremely unique experience here you
[1:07:39] know I mean our our our brother came and
[1:07:42] sang for us this morning our both our
[1:07:44] brothers I didn't understand the words
[1:07:46] but their Spirit bore witness with
[1:07:49] mine now I know how that brother won his
[1:07:52] wife he serated her to death
[1:07:56] you know and uh you know so that's what
[1:08:00] I sang to Leslie one she said I'll marry
[1:08:02] if you never sing to me
[1:08:04] again and uh so you know and and that
[1:08:09] real Unity of the faith is what that
[1:08:13] we're after this morning so I want you
[1:08:17] to know this is what where my heart
[1:08:21] wants to be if somebody comes amongst us
[1:08:24] and they're outside of the will of God I
[1:08:27] don't want to condemn them I want them
[1:08:29] to know there's a way
[1:08:32] back you know what I mean if somebody's
[1:08:35] made a
[1:08:36] mistake we want to know that there's a
[1:08:41] that love covers a multitude of sins and
[1:08:45] that he that was within us is greater
[1:08:49] than he who is in the
[1:08:51] world and we've got our doctrines down
[1:08:55] you know what I mean we we understand so
[1:08:57] many doctrines we spent so much time on
[1:09:01] Doctrine and teachings and Revelations
[1:09:04] that and that's why I preach that
[1:09:07] message don't forget Titus that we
[1:09:09] forgot how to be Christians we forgot
[1:09:12] how to link up uh with the word of God
[1:09:17] and and uh read your Bible every day and
[1:09:21] have it speak to you brother R made this
[1:09:24] statement I thought it was a a a a a a
[1:09:28] good of things he said the Waters of
[1:09:31] separation is the
[1:09:34] word you know we talk about well you
[1:09:37] know the Waters of Separation he said
[1:09:39] the Waters of separation is the word it
[1:09:43] it's the word that separates no matter
[1:09:46] what it is in your life it's the word
[1:09:49] that separates the word is sharper than
[1:09:52] a two-edged sword discerning so our our
[1:09:57] love affair with the
[1:10:01] Bible has uh amongst all of us has got
[1:10:07] to
[1:10:08] increase you understand brother Ren's
[1:10:12] message came from the Bible he even came
[1:10:15] where he was in question whether those
[1:10:18] seals were going to be written on the
[1:10:21] back side of the book and then when the
[1:10:24] Lord took them and showed them he said
[1:10:26] no they're in the book but they've just
[1:10:29] been hid and then afterwards he was able
[1:10:33] to pick this up and say this has become
[1:10:36] a brand new
[1:10:39] book well just think of it now he's
[1:10:42] reading this Through The Eyes of uh
[1:10:46] understanding of the mystery of Jesus
[1:10:49] Christ and if you can start reading
[1:10:52] listening to the message and then
[1:10:54] reading this Bible and watching those
[1:10:57] two come together I I'll tell you you
[1:11:00] will you will feel a a
[1:11:03] strength and a confidence and that's
[1:11:06] what we're Desiring we're Desiring a
[1:11:08] body of Believers that have
[1:11:11] strength confidence
[1:11:14] humility and
[1:11:17] love but you know you're a Believer for
[1:11:20] you to know you have access to the
[1:11:23] throne to know that if you ask anything
[1:11:26] of the father in his name that he'll
[1:11:30] Grant it think of that think of that a
[1:11:33] being with four or 500 people that that
[1:11:37] stood there and and knew that God heard
[1:11:40] their prayer and that they're standing
[1:11:42] shoulder toosh shoulder with
[1:11:45] you like that guy on the field that guy
[1:11:49] come up and said hell Mary full of grace
[1:11:51] he was laying there dying the guy
[1:11:53] stopped and said wait a minute he said I
[1:11:54] don't want no
[1:11:56] secretary you know I want to talk to the
[1:11:59] the main
[1:12:01] one so we don't want to to share a
[1:12:05] Doctrine with people we don't want to
[1:12:08] share a program with people we don't
[1:12:11] want to uh share the building or
[1:12:15] anything we want to be able to share the
[1:12:17] love of God that was manifested in
[1:12:19] Christ Jesus and we want that
[1:12:22] love in US that's the secret he said the
[1:12:27] he said the water of separation is the
[1:12:30] word the word of God the water of
[1:12:34] Separation through the washing of the
[1:12:37] Water by the word you come and hear the
[1:12:41] word and the first thing it does it
[1:12:44] separates you to move your
[1:12:48] thoughts from Evil to
[1:12:53] good amen man
[1:12:56] so that that's what we're here this
[1:12:59] morning we're here to move our
[1:13:03] thoughts from where that we are and how
[1:13:06] that we're thinking and let the word of
[1:13:09] God let the messenger preach to us and
[1:13:13] let him move our
[1:13:15] thoughts because you only get out of a
[1:13:18] service what you put into it you know
[1:13:22] what I mean you got when you make a cake
[1:13:24] if you ever left an ingredients out oh I
[1:13:27] forgot the yeast or I forgot the flour
[1:13:30] oh I put salt instead of sugar you know
[1:13:33] I mean and it it you don't if it's not
[1:13:36] put in right it don't come out right now
[1:13:40] wouldn't it be wonderful if we could all
[1:13:42] come into the house of the Lord and some
[1:13:44] when they we started singing a song
[1:13:46] everybody just got into that song and
[1:13:49] sung it with all their
[1:13:52] heart got in the spirit of the song
[1:13:56] Amazing Grace Oh Amazing Grace how great
[1:14:00] the sound you know the day it appeared
[1:14:02] to me and and you start putting
[1:14:05] something into it you know but if you've
[1:14:07] been playing bingo all night you know
[1:14:09] what I mean then you kind of roll in
[1:14:11] here and sleep on the pews you know I
[1:14:14] mean we got to make rules that if you
[1:14:16] want to sleep go sleep in the fellowship
[1:14:19] hall we're not going to condemn you for
[1:14:22] sleeping but don't sleep in here
[1:14:26] okay I don't need to examine your Adams
[1:14:32] Apple you know what I mean I know what
[1:14:35] most of the Adams apples in here look
[1:14:37] like I I've seen your feelings I you
[1:14:41] know I've seen your
[1:14:43] tonsils you you know what I'm saying but
[1:14:46] we're we're wanting to get up higher
[1:14:48] we're wanting to rise we want to start
[1:14:49] putting into it we want to come in here
[1:14:52] think what's the spirit today where's
[1:14:54] the spirit been leading what scriptures
[1:14:57] have I been reading what's the preacher
[1:14:59] going to preach on and and and you you
[1:15:02] start set in the atmosphere you you know
[1:15:05] what I mean you start if you got little
[1:15:07] things in your life you start saying I'm
[1:15:09] sorry and and and all of a sudden you're
[1:15:12] starting to create an atmosphere and the
[1:15:15] atmosphere that we're trying to create
[1:15:17] is an atmosphere for
[1:15:21] fellowship and so uh uh and and that's
[1:15:25] why this I I just felt so led to uh uh
[1:15:30] play this this
[1:15:34] morning and I I I'm only going to play
[1:15:36] 32 minutes of
[1:15:38] it there's another 10 minutes or
[1:15:41] something that uh brother Brenham gives
[1:15:44] to uh before the prayer
[1:15:47] line and I I I thought this is a great
[1:15:50] statement he made right before the
[1:15:51] prayer line he said Jesus is real
[1:15:56] he raised from the
[1:15:58] dead and he will be right here at the
[1:16:03] platform in a few
[1:16:06] minutes oh my when I read that I thought
[1:16:11] oh my thank you Lord you know I mean
[1:16:16] what a way to put it Jesus is real and
[1:16:20] he'll be here in a few minutes
[1:16:25] how many have heard him say he's
[1:16:27] here I take every spirit in this
[1:16:30] building in my control in the name of
[1:16:33] Jesus Christ he says you feel that he's
[1:16:37] here he says you know what that is
[1:16:40] you're feeling it's him he's here a amen
[1:16:44] and I know people got all kinds of
[1:16:47] different uh uh doctrines about who he's
[1:16:51] here and where he's there and and what
[1:16:53] coming and this coming but we were
[1:16:56] promised that scriptural fulfillment
[1:16:59] that the Lord Jesus Christ would come
[1:17:01] again to the Gentiles Veil himself in a
[1:17:06] prophet messenger Veil himself and do
[1:17:09] the same works for the Gentiles that he
[1:17:11] did for the Jews and I think this is so
[1:17:14] that was just so beautiful and he'll be
[1:17:17] in a few he say Jesus is real he raised
[1:17:21] from the dead he'll be right here at
[1:17:24] this platform in a few minutes doing the
[1:17:28] same things he did back there to prove
[1:17:34] to you people that he's here and wants
[1:17:43] Fellowship
[1:17:44] amen and if he wants
[1:17:47] Fellowship he wants us to have
[1:17:50] fellowship and fellowship one with
[1:17:54] another
[1:17:55] there
[1:17:57] so
[1:17:58] that's my heart's desire so if brother

[1:18:12] moments after he speaks we're going to

[1:18:53] believers

[1:19:08] be an angel of the Lord a prophet

[1:19:43] to go to work you got to catch trains
[1:19:45] out and I've kept you late every night
[1:19:46] and you forgive me for that will you and
[1:19:49] uh a lot of times I get so enthused when
[1:19:51] I
[1:19:53] start could I call it
[1:19:55] preaching anyhow when I'm having a good
[1:19:58] time well then I get so enthused I lose
[1:20:01] all thoughts of time and everything so
[1:20:04] you've been very nice to stay with me
[1:20:06] and it just makes me love you with all
[1:20:08] my heart now I want to read some words
[1:20:12] out of God's Bible in first John the
[1:20:14] first chapter and the 5th verse to the
[1:20:17] 7th
[1:20:20] and I believe we'll just read the
[1:20:22] seventh verse and that will make it
[1:20:24] shorter you read the whole chapter when
[1:20:27] you get home if you can if we walk in
[1:20:30] the light as he is in the light we have
[1:20:32] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:20:35] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:20:38] us from all sins isn't that
[1:20:42] marvelous let's ask him to bless the
[1:20:44] reading of his word now heavenly father
[1:20:47] bless Thy word tonight and may go out to
[1:20:50] every heart and find a dwelling place
[1:20:53] and never leave leave no more Grant it
[1:20:56] Lord and now circumcise the lips of the
[1:20:59] Unworthy person that's to speak and
[1:21:02] circumcise all the ears of these people
[1:21:04] who are to hear and get Glory out of the
[1:21:07] service for we ask it in Jesus name our
[1:21:10] loving son
[1:21:12] amen now I want to speak to you just a
[1:21:15] little while tonight been this has been
[1:21:16] such a wonderful week upon the way to
[1:21:20] have
[1:21:22] Fellowship now we know that I was going
[1:21:25] to continue my service tonight the
[1:21:28] children of Israel over in the Homeland
[1:21:31] Joshua take them over where we left last
[1:21:33] night when he was crossing this the Red
[1:21:34] Sea but I wouldn't have time in this
[1:21:37] prayer line so he can uh catch trains
[1:21:39] and so forth and get home and go to work
[1:21:41] in the morning
[1:21:43] now this would be short we can talk to
[1:21:46] you just short on this but how that uh
[1:21:51] every person desires Fellowship I've
[1:21:55] never seen anyone yet who did not desire
[1:21:58] Fellowship that is was was all right
[1:22:01] mentally balanc now you might want to
[1:22:04] pick your fellowship of course that's
[1:22:06] true to every one of us that's the
[1:22:08] reason tonight that all these fine
[1:22:11] people have packed out here in this
[1:22:12] building to a place where they're
[1:22:14] standing is because that they like this
[1:22:16] type of Fellowship they like Christian
[1:22:19] fellowship and that's why we come
[1:22:21] tonight to Fellowship around the word I
[1:22:25] love the word don't you and you know why
[1:22:28] you love the word you have the Holy
[1:22:30] Spirit in you for the Bible said that
[1:22:33] man does not live by bread alone but by
[1:22:37] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:22:40] mouth of God so the Holy Spirit feeds on
[1:22:45] the
[1:22:45] word and then when you hear the word
[1:22:48] everyone wants to hear it no matter
[1:22:51] every little piece of literature they
[1:22:52] can pick up they they read it and they
[1:22:55] listen to the radio and they go to
[1:22:57] church and so forth because they are
[1:23:00] longing for that fellowships around the
[1:23:04] world and may God help us tonight to
[1:23:07] realize how we can have a perfect
[1:23:11] Fellowship no matter where Storms Come
[1:23:14] whether you're right or wrong you can
[1:23:16] still have fellowship and only way you
[1:23:19] can have Fellowship as your love
[1:23:22] perfects don't never forget me if I
[1:23:25] don't see some of you anymore remember
[1:23:26] this that my theme is love covers it all
[1:23:33] I believe in the redeeming love of the
[1:23:36] Lord Jesus I like this song ever since
[1:23:40] by faith I saw the streams thy flowing
[1:23:42] wounds supplied redeeming love has been
[1:23:46] my theme and shall be till I die I'd
[1:23:51] rather have a church listen just a
[1:23:53] moment I would rather have a church that
[1:23:57] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:24:00] and just be so in love with each other
[1:24:03] and with Christ I'd rather have that
[1:24:05] than every spiritual gift operating in
[1:24:07] the church amen that might sound hard in
[1:24:10] a Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:24:13] have it where there is gifts they'll
[1:24:16] fail where there is gifts will bring
[1:24:18] confusion where there is gifts they can
[1:24:20] be questioned but where there is love it
[1:24:22] is perfect that's right and if you had
[1:24:25] perfect love you'd have perfect gifts
[1:24:27] that's right so work first with love
[1:24:31] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[1:24:33] brings
[1:24:35] gifts now the reason why is it that
[1:24:39] people perhaps like different things
[1:24:42] like Fellowship is because first man was
[1:24:45] made to
[1:24:46] Fellowship I just think of tonight as
[1:24:50] much as I long to go hunting and fishing
[1:24:53] and Outdoors
[1:24:55] yet my heart is more hungry to get on
[1:24:58] top of that mountain talk to God than
[1:24:59] anything I know
[1:25:01] of yeah I want to be alone I want to
[1:25:03] know there's nobody 100 miles from me I
[1:25:06] love people but the only way I can
[1:25:09] minister to people is to first get the
[1:25:11] message from God and I know this one
[1:25:14] thing that my faith tells me that every
[1:25:17] person that's borned again that I preach
[1:25:19] to I'll have an eternity to fellowship
[1:25:22] with him but we want to bring more in
[1:25:24] out of the darkness there's our poor
[1:25:26] lost brothers and sisters out here
[1:25:27] tonight and sloon I passed by Skid roll
[1:25:30] last night as my boy and I'm wanted to
[1:25:32] see and see those poor people down there
[1:25:35] drinking and think that they don't they
[1:25:38] don't know what they do want I thought
[1:25:40] if they only knew my Jesus they sure
[1:25:42] wouldn't be down there see and that's
[1:25:45] the only thing that can save them from
[1:25:47] that chaos that they're in there's no
[1:25:49] medicine nothing alcoholic is a perfect
[1:25:52] total annihilation from any help at all
[1:25:56] outside of Jesus Christ that's right
[1:25:59] there's no cure I've been on the B I've
[1:26:01] been in pig alley in France to the
[1:26:03] lowest slums that I could find and
[1:26:05] talking and praying and so forth and the
[1:26:08] only hope for them people is the blood
[1:26:10] of Jesus Christ it's the only thing the
[1:26:13] only hope now what makes man want to
[1:26:17] Fellowship is because he was made that
[1:26:20] way he was made to have Fellowship
[1:26:25] what Fellowship is I got four days
[1:26:27] driving to do starting tomorrow I got
[1:26:30] four days to drive to about 2500 miles
[1:26:34] and I have to drive it by myself in a
[1:26:36] little old truck and someone a friend of
[1:26:40] mine is coming down just left word this
[1:26:44] afternoon to ride all the way out there
[1:26:46] with me ride back byself on a Greyhound
[1:26:49] bus just to have Fellowship isn't that
[1:26:52] wonderful you know I appreciate friend
[1:26:54] friends like that God bless his little
[1:26:57] Swiss har I love him wanting to ride
[1:27:02] just to be with me four days across the
[1:27:05] mountains and prairies over under just
[1:27:07] to have
[1:27:08] Fellowship we love each other dearly as
[1:27:11] dearly beloved brothers and then have to
[1:27:14] ride all the way back up to sh Shana
[1:27:18] Westcon on a bus or somehow just to get
[1:27:21] back oh that makes my heart jump and now
[1:27:24] God Is So longing to have fellowship
[1:27:27] with his children that he come all the
[1:27:29] way from glory and died to have
[1:27:31] fellowship with us isn't that
[1:27:34] marvelous so wonderful to think now in
[1:27:38] the beginning man had Fellowship first
[1:27:42] we realize if we can have fellowship
[1:27:45] with God then don't worry God will take
[1:27:47] care of the rest of it the main thing I
[1:27:48] want to speak on I've got it in four
[1:27:51] parts here how to have fellowship with
[1:27:52] God Fellowship one another and so forth
[1:27:54] but we want to talk only on the one
[1:27:57] phase of it is the fellowship with
[1:27:59] God and now I'm going to watch that
[1:28:02] clock there to be sure that I get the
[1:28:03] prayer line started in time but
[1:28:06] fellowship with God is what the first
[1:28:10] and original Fellowship that human
[1:28:12] beings had was with God there wasn't
[1:28:15] even another another living creature on
[1:28:18] the earth that he could fellowship with
[1:28:19] Adam but God then God made him a
[1:28:22] helpmate a wife which is part of him and
[1:28:25] could you
[1:28:26] imagine in the evenings when the sun had
[1:28:29] gone down going setting way back in the
[1:28:32] west and that streaks of light coming
[1:28:35] down through those great evergreen trees
[1:28:38] God's Great Cathedral and he the Roar on
[1:28:42] a throng through the top of the trees
[1:28:44] and Adam and Eve sitting out there in
[1:28:46] the garden in God's Great Cathedral
[1:28:49] having fellowship with God everybody
[1:28:52] longs to do that every Christian longs
[1:28:55] to have Fellowship isn't that right I've
[1:28:58] read stories of man who spent a lifetime
[1:29:01] early going high into the hills going
[1:29:04] down to the Lakeside just hunting for a
[1:29:07] spot for Fellowship but after all you
[1:29:10] don't have to go anywhere but the
[1:29:12] calvary that's the only way there's a
[1:29:15] way there's only one way that you can go
[1:29:17] to fellowship and
[1:29:20] notice then not way there hasn't only
[1:29:23] been in this AG of has been in all ages
[1:29:25] just think job way the oldest book in
[1:29:28] the Bible he longed for Fellowship he
[1:29:31] know there was a Creator and he believed
[1:29:34] him with all of his heart and he said in
[1:29:37] a child way of saying it oh if I could
[1:29:40] only get to him if I only knew where he
[1:29:44] lived at I could go up knock on his door
[1:29:46] and talk to him just a little while
[1:29:48] wouldn't we all love to do that but
[1:29:51] think he's closer to you than his door
[1:29:54] his door is your heart and he's so close
[1:29:57] tonight he's closer to you than your
[1:29:59] right arm is he's part of you and if we
[1:30:03] can only realize that he's here and how
[1:30:05] he wants to have fellowship with
[1:30:07] us his heart is greater for Fellowship
[1:30:10] than ours are and the reason makes us
[1:30:12] that way because we're offsprings of his
[1:30:16] that's what makes us long for Fellowship
[1:30:18] that's what makes a mother would die for
[1:30:20] her
[1:30:21] baby why that's what makes a father
[1:30:23] would give give his life for his
[1:30:25] wife a husband a true husband would give
[1:30:29] his life for his wife why because Christ
[1:30:32] gave his life for the church his wife
[1:30:34] it's a strain in you and it make a
[1:30:37] mother Dash to a burning fire not
[1:30:40] thinking about her own self and her hair
[1:30:42] on fire and her clothes on fire to grab
[1:30:44] her baby and run out with it why it's
[1:30:47] love of a
[1:30:48] parent and God is the first and Original
[1:30:52] Parent and there's where that strain
[1:30:55] comes through because the woman gave
[1:30:57] birth to the child and that's the reason
[1:30:59] God's come down manifested in the flesh
[1:31:03] and went to the very flames of hottest
[1:31:05] of suffering that he might bring us into
[1:31:08] fellowship with him taking old thought
[1:31:10] of his own not my will thine be done how
[1:31:14] that wonderful Fellowship that we have
[1:31:17] with each other and with God now God
[1:31:21] intended this Fellowship so what
[1:31:24] separated what keeps man from having
[1:31:26] that direct talk like Adam did I've
[1:31:29] often thought that Adam out in the
[1:31:32] Garden of Eden knowing no sin AR Eve his
[1:31:35] wife beautiful standing in the garden
[1:31:38] and then Leo the Lion would come up and
[1:31:41] here come the Tiger The Great beast of
[1:31:45] the of the fields come up into this
[1:31:48] Cathedral kneeling on their knees and
[1:31:51] they even even the Beast didn't have
[1:31:53] have any killing about them they there
[1:31:55] was nothing no death
[1:31:57] nowhere the devil's what makes wild
[1:32:00] animals wants to hurt you and if you can
[1:32:03] produce in your heart the right kind of
[1:32:07] a love towards the most horrible Beast
[1:32:11] there is in the woods or the deserts
[1:32:14] that Beast won't harm you that's right I
[1:32:18] know it by
[1:32:20] experience but you can't pretend it he
[1:32:23] knows knows whether you do or not
[1:32:25] there's something about him and he knows
[1:32:27] it but if you're really not
[1:32:29] afraid I've never seen anything that
[1:32:32] would hurt you no matter a line whatever
[1:32:36] it might be you'll walk away from you
[1:32:38] but if you run or act like you're scared
[1:32:40] or something then you'll get killed so
[1:32:43] you can't just make it up you've got to
[1:32:45] really know it in your heart that you're
[1:32:47] not afraid that's a trouble with man
[1:32:50] tonight that's what's a trouble with
[1:32:51] people tonight you're scared
[1:32:54] that's the biggest curse there is on the
[1:32:57] Full Gospel people or any other people
[1:32:59] is because they are
[1:33:01] afraid God has made the provision but
[1:33:04] you're afraid to take his word for it if
[1:33:07] you was wasn't afraid tonight while you
[1:33:10] would take your healing by faith and
[1:33:12] know that God promised it and the thing
[1:33:13] would just go PL away from
[1:33:16] you afraid
[1:33:18] scared and I've noticed it and that's
[1:33:22] the reason I'm such a believer in
[1:33:25] healing I know that if you can get away
[1:33:27] from that
[1:33:29] scare and get love in its place
[1:33:32] something's going to happen there's only
[1:33:35] two faculties that govern a human and
[1:33:38] one of them is is
[1:33:41] Faith which brings results and the other
[1:33:45] is fear which has no value in it at
[1:33:48] all faith is of god fear is of the devil
[1:33:53] fear makes You Weary fear makes you
[1:33:55] wonder and if I was going to die in the
[1:33:58] morning what good would it do me get all
[1:34:00] stewed up about it what if I was going
[1:34:02] to be electrocuted in the morning and my
[1:34:05] life had to end tomorrow morning what
[1:34:07] good would that do me to worry about it
[1:34:09] well you say what good would it do to
[1:34:11] have faith faith can sign my
[1:34:13] pardon sure there's value in faith don't
[1:34:17] be weary don't be scared don't be upset
[1:34:20] just have faith and believe and the only
[1:34:22] way you can have faith you have to have
[1:34:23] love first for love produces faith for
[1:34:27] perfect love get it perfect love cast
[1:34:33] out all
[1:34:36] fear wish I had time to tell you the
[1:34:39] experiences with wild life of what I've
[1:34:41] seen conquered by Faith by love I told
[1:34:45] you other night about the old P being
[1:34:47] sent up I seen a vicious bull one day
[1:34:51] was going to kill
[1:34:52] me this is on record I was a game warden
[1:34:55] at the time I was going over the hill to
[1:34:58] pray for a sick man when we're supposed
[1:35:01] to pack a gun but you wouldn't go to
[1:35:03] pray for a sick man with a gun on your
[1:35:05] hand so I tucked the gun and laid in a
[1:35:08] little old truck and crossed over
[1:35:09] through the field and I was way out in
[1:35:11] the field and I knew I had a a to
[1:35:14] thought that this killer bull was out
[1:35:16] there he just killed a colored man on a
[1:35:18] farm Mr burs just about 3 months before
[1:35:20] that and had sold him up there to the
[1:35:22] people had had these dur cattle and then
[1:35:25] when I started across the field right
[1:35:26] out in a big open field and not over
[1:35:30] about 30 yards from me this big fell
[1:35:32] raised up and threw his horns down and
[1:35:34] let out a big Beller if you know what
[1:35:36] I'm talking about and there he was horns
[1:35:39] about like this and here he comes at
[1:35:42] first it scared me I I looked for a tree
[1:35:45] and there wasn't any tree and I know he
[1:35:47] could outrun me to the
[1:35:48] fence so I thought well this is it so
[1:35:52] then something
[1:35:54] happen oh
[1:35:57] God if that would only stay there
[1:35:59] instead of going
[1:36:01] away something happened I I wish God
[1:36:05] would let it happen to everybody here
[1:36:07] tonight just long enough to get
[1:36:09] healed something happened that I wasn't
[1:36:13] scared theable I felt sorry because I
[1:36:16] Disturbed him I in his feel he was
[1:36:18] laying out there not bothering me I come
[1:36:20] along and woke him
[1:36:21] up and so I felt sorry for me now you
[1:36:25] can't Bluff it it has to be there that's
[1:36:28] the way faith is you can't Bluff you got
[1:36:31] to really have
[1:36:34] it the devil know
[1:36:37] it and this fellow started towards me
[1:36:39] with his head down just as hard as he
[1:36:41] could I wasn't more afraid of that bull
[1:36:43] than I would be if any my dear brothers
[1:36:45] and sisters stand on this platform and
[1:36:47] he run within about 5et of me and he
[1:36:52] stopped
[1:36:54] he looked at me so depleted he looked
[1:36:56] right and left I said fella I'm sorry I
[1:36:59] Disturbed
[1:37:00] you I said now you're God's creature and
[1:37:03] I'm God's servant now the Creator made
[1:37:06] you made me and I am his servant I'm on
[1:37:10] my journey across the hill to pray for
[1:37:11] one of these sick children if I know
[1:37:14] you've been laying there I wouldn't have
[1:37:15] come by and Disturbed you so now in the
[1:37:18] name of Jesus Christ the Creator go back
[1:37:21] and lay down
[1:37:25] at the Judgment bar you'll see it
[1:37:27] brought into
[1:37:29] light that bull looked at me a few
[1:37:31] minutes turned around walked over and
[1:37:33] laid down and I I stood there the tears
[1:37:37] running down my cheeks I walked within 5
[1:37:41] foot of that bull and he ever even
[1:37:42] turned his head and looked at
[1:37:43] me why instead of hating him I loved
[1:37:49] him Love Will Conquer anything
[1:37:55] right that's what conquered my heart
[1:37:57] when I know that God so loved me that he
[1:38:00] gave his only begotten son that I
[1:38:02] wouldn't have to perish know that I was
[1:38:04] born in this world of Sinner and was
[1:38:07] perishing and God loved me that he gave
[1:38:10] his son to for my life to be redeemed
[1:38:12] and that I I couldn't hate no more I had
[1:38:15] to love that's what brings these results
[1:38:18] that you see it's
[1:38:22] love I don't know I might have told this
[1:38:24] I have told it before hundreds of little
[1:38:27] things has happened one day I was mowing
[1:38:29] my yard I had to get in a backyard the
[1:38:32] front yard is growing up before I get
[1:38:33] the back now people come being prayed
[1:38:35] for and things see as Joseph said a
[1:38:38] while ago it's just here this is just
[1:38:40] this is just Chicago at home it's all
[1:38:42] around the world see where people are
[1:38:45] coming and going from all parts of the
[1:38:46] world coming in and when I was mowing
[1:38:49] this grass and I run in forgot about it
[1:38:52] there's a harness Nest back there there
[1:38:54] and I hit that fence with this more
[1:38:56] machine and I was covered over with horn
[1:38:58] some great Big Fellas it'll knock you
[1:39:00] down when the it at first I was scared
[1:39:03] truly no shirt on and something other
[1:39:10] happened I I was sorry I hit those Fells
[1:39:13] not because I was afraid as going to get
[1:39:15] stung but really it sounds
[1:39:18] juvenile but if we could just be more
[1:39:21] juvenile if we could be more child like
[1:39:24] it's a Simplicity of God that turns
[1:39:27] college students
[1:39:29] around be simple in those things just
[1:39:33] like a baby just rely and believe don't
[1:39:35] try to push yourself just relax and
[1:39:38] believe it all don't try to work
[1:39:40] yourself up oh God how you re that's no
[1:39:43] no good no just believe it and walk on
[1:39:47] that's
[1:39:48] all so when that happened I thought and
[1:39:52] poor little fellas up there in their
[1:39:53] nest now and here I done hit the fence
[1:39:56] and knocked them out of their nest that
[1:39:58] big old Mo machine I was pushing and I
[1:40:01] said you little creatures of God I'm
[1:40:03] sorry that I hit this
[1:40:05] fence I'm sorry I Disturbed you now I'm
[1:40:09] God servant and I'm praying for your
[1:40:10] sick children got to hurry and mold this
[1:40:12] yard so now you rush right back into
[1:40:14] your nest I won't bother you no more in
[1:40:16] the name of the Lord Jesus I started my
[1:40:18] mow off again and stopped it I pulled
[1:40:20] the string and started off like that and
[1:40:22] then beat just a humming all around my
[1:40:25] naked shoulders and they took a beine
[1:40:28] and went right back into their nest not
[1:40:29] singing it
[1:40:30] all
[1:40:32] love I can't produce it I can't work it
[1:40:35] up God's Got to Give
[1:40:37] it there's where it is
[1:40:40] tonight God has to give it then love
[1:40:44] produces a fellowship now when God said
[1:40:48] back there the day that sin had
[1:40:50] separated that Divine love God
[1:40:53] told Adam and Eve not to eat these
[1:40:55] certain fruits and they did and sin
[1:40:58] brought separation and sin by separation
[1:41:01] brought hatred malice Strife Envy is
[1:41:07] that right what happened they separated
[1:41:10] from Divine love and when you separate
[1:41:14] from Divine love then you can't overlook
[1:41:17] your brother's mistakes no more you got
[1:41:19] to ball him out
[1:41:21] for that's right you can't Overlook
[1:41:24] sister's mistakes no more because you've
[1:41:26] got away from that Divine part that love
[1:41:29] part but if you really love the Lord
[1:41:32] Jesus if sister or brother does
[1:41:34] something to you oh well that's all
[1:41:36] right they didn't mean to do it that's
[1:41:39] the kind of love that Christ had father
[1:41:41] forgive them they don't know what
[1:41:42] they're
[1:41:43] doing what if he had help my sins
[1:41:46] against me what an awful person I was
[1:41:48] but he loved me so well that he forgave
[1:41:50] me far what I was undone
[1:41:53] he forgave me he loved me a pure love
[1:41:59] and when Adam separated himself from
[1:42:01] pure love of keeping God's word in his
[1:42:04] heart when he did that then he began
[1:42:08] these other faculties come in Malice
[1:42:11] Envy Strife hatred so forth now when God
[1:42:16] seen that his children had separated he
[1:42:18] come down for
[1:42:20] fellowship and there was no one there to
[1:42:22] welcome
[1:42:25] remember the other night when I preached
[1:42:26] on the woman washing Jesus's feet he was
[1:42:29] unwelcomed by the
[1:42:32] Pharisees he's unwelcome tonight in many
[1:42:35] people he's unwelcome in many churches
[1:42:37] many
[1:42:40] cities look when Israel was dividing up
[1:42:43] their lands there
[1:42:45] was I believe it was Gad was one of them
[1:42:49] and perhaps uh the half tribe they
[1:42:52] didn't go over into the promised land
[1:42:55] they stayed on this side barter
[1:42:57] line Jesus visit that same people and
[1:43:01] look at the results of staying out of
[1:43:03] the full benefits of God's love when
[1:43:07] Jesus visited them he went over in
[1:43:09] gatera that's where they were dwelt
[1:43:11] that's where they made that's where they
[1:43:12] come from right there and their attitude
[1:43:15] was still the same way because that they
[1:43:19] had to cost them a bunch of hogs to have
[1:43:21] the meeting they asked Jesus to leave
[1:43:24] their
[1:43:26] land they didn't want nothing to do with
[1:43:28] it they had their own ways they had
[1:43:30] their own churches they didn't want
[1:43:31] nothing to do with Jesus so they asked
[1:43:33] him to leave the land but he went anyhow
[1:43:36] because there was one Soul calling
[1:43:40] baring just think cross that stormy Lake
[1:43:43] over across there to find one soul in
[1:43:46] need that was his love for one needy
[1:43:48] Soul he'll come from Glory tonight to
[1:43:51] this school auditorium for one needy
[1:43:54] Soul that'll believe
[1:43:57] him and so then when sin came in it
[1:44:00] separated man from fellowship notice
[1:44:03] what God did to bring man back to
[1:44:05] fellowship he introduced to the world of
[1:44:09] blood
[1:44:11] Redemption God killed animals and put
[1:44:15] forther Skin showing of blood Redemption
[1:44:18] and there God after being separated from
[1:44:22] his from his uh creatures God laid out
[1:44:25] the welcome mat back home by the
[1:44:28] shedding of the blood and that's was
[1:44:30] then and has been and will always be
[1:44:34] God's provided preparation for our
[1:44:37] fellowship with him is through the shed
[1:44:40] blood friend listen to me just a few
[1:44:44] moments because I see I got 12 minutes
[1:44:46] yet look I want to ask you they have
[1:44:50] cried they have tried hard to substitute
[1:44:54] education for that
[1:44:56] blood it'll never work they have tried
[1:45:00] hard The Substitute denomination to
[1:45:02] bring Fellowship educate people the
[1:45:06] world today as brother Tommy Hicks that
[1:45:08] wonderful little brother was here today
[1:45:11] giving us his story back in behind the
[1:45:13] Iron Curtain there Russia and all of its
[1:45:17] culture and science trying to bring a
[1:45:19] fellowship through communism through uh
[1:45:23] science and
[1:45:25] culture and denying the blood of Jesus
[1:45:29] when the blood of Christ is the only way
[1:45:31] that you can have Fellowship amen
[1:45:34] nothing will take its place thanks be to
[1:45:37] God you don't have to be smart you don't
[1:45:40] have to be intelligent you just have to
[1:45:41] have a humble submitted
[1:45:43] heart think of it he introduced blood
[1:45:48] now I want you to watch closely now we
[1:45:51] speaking of job a while ago
[1:45:53] job used this same
[1:45:56] preparation the oldest book in the Bible
[1:45:58] even before Genesis was written job was
[1:46:01] written and job was a righteous man a
[1:46:04] man who feared God and troubles came to
[1:46:07] him but I want you to notice just before
[1:46:10] the troubles come job made preparations
[1:46:13] for this
[1:46:14] trouble listen friend sinner friend
[1:46:18] there's trouble right ahead of you
[1:46:20] tonight and that's the valleys of The
[1:46:22] Shadow Shadows of death you better make
[1:46:26] preparations for the only friend who can
[1:46:28] walk with you through
[1:46:29] that right make preparations for IT job
[1:46:32] had a bunch of daughters and sons and
[1:46:35] when he knew that they were out like
[1:46:38] birds people raise up children today I
[1:46:40] feel sorry for fathers and mothers today
[1:46:43] being a parent myself and knowing one
[1:46:46] reason I'm trying to get my children
[1:46:47] away from our city we don't have any
[1:46:49] Christian schools there and I want to
[1:46:51] get them somewhere where they'll be
[1:46:52] brought up in
[1:46:55] school in a real Fundamental School
[1:46:59] where they learn to love the Lord the
[1:47:03] teaching that I can give them around
[1:47:04] home yet they get out with that worldly
[1:47:06] crowd the Devil is a shrewd fellon and
[1:47:08] he pushes that into them amen if you can
[1:47:12] keep them under the spirit until they
[1:47:14] get old enough to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:47:16] and know what it's all about then God
[1:47:18] will take care of the rest of
[1:47:20] them but first they got them little
[1:47:22] adolescent
[1:47:23] days now every person thinks of their
[1:47:26] children while they're under your your
[1:47:29] wings you can watch them but once out
[1:47:31] from under the wings then the devil's
[1:47:33] got every little old Oscar he can out
[1:47:36] there to associate with your children
[1:47:38] that's idelic and mean and devilish and
[1:47:42] everything
[1:47:43] else God help
[1:47:45] us this juvenile delinquency here in New
[1:47:49] York Chicago and these big cities what
[1:47:52] the papers is writing up how they kill
[1:47:55] one another and everything little
[1:47:56] children little boys and girls killing
[1:48:00] and murdering and shooting and so forth
[1:48:02] like that if those poor little kitties
[1:48:05] only realize that that's the
[1:48:08] devil sure what brought on juvenile
[1:48:11] delinquency was parent
[1:48:13] delinquency the parent failing to take
[1:48:16] care of the children you remember a few
[1:48:17] years ago when my boy was born that's
[1:48:20] been about I think he's about 19 now I
[1:48:23] remember the doctor told my wife said
[1:48:25] just let that kid
[1:48:28] Squall said it ain't going to Hur him
[1:48:30] and if Grandma comes along to pick him
[1:48:32] up said take her keep her hands off of
[1:48:34] him said he ought to be crib broke at 6
[1:48:37] months old now you know better than that
[1:48:41] sounds like a talking of a witch doctor
[1:48:43] instead of a real doctor and then you
[1:48:46] know what it hatched out it hatched out
[1:48:49] a bunch of
[1:48:51] neurotics and a bunch of to gangsters
[1:48:54] listen God gave you that baby to love I
[1:48:58] don't care how bad you Spar it love it
[1:49:02] anyhow that's
[1:49:04] right love it if you don't love it now
[1:49:08] it'll grow up in a cold home and
[1:49:10] indifference and it'll seek love
[1:49:12] somewhere or something it'll make an
[1:49:14] outl for somewhere mother take that baby
[1:49:17] and give it fellowship and love
[1:49:20] now make it a part of you which it is
[1:49:23] and act like it and hug it and kiss it
[1:49:26] and and and love it don't be too cold
[1:49:29] with the things of the world God gave
[1:49:31] you that as a treasure raise it
[1:49:34] right amen notice that's what's a matter
[1:49:38] we got away from the things of God you
[1:49:40] get away from nature and then you're out
[1:49:42] of the will of
[1:49:43] God now I want you to notice then joob
[1:49:47] thinking of his children he said now per
[1:49:49] Venture when they go out they might sin
[1:49:53] so he offered the only preparation that
[1:49:56] he knowed about was a burnt sacrifice
[1:49:58] the shedding of blood and he shed the
[1:50:01] blood of the lamb for his children
[1:50:03] making preparation if they did
[1:50:07] Sin you see
[1:50:09] it job was mindful of his children to
[1:50:13] make a preparation for their
[1:50:16] sins and mother and father if we would
[1:50:20] quit spending money on our children
[1:50:22] learning tap
[1:50:24] dancing and things like that and some
[1:50:28] kind of how to be an
[1:50:30] actor and put more time of pleading the
[1:50:34] blood of Jesus up over them and showing
[1:50:37] them love and fellowship we'd get along
[1:50:40] better the child would too teach your
[1:50:44] child I believe if every parent would
[1:50:47] take their child and the first a parent
[1:50:49] come back to God and take the beer out
[1:50:52] of the ice box and take the cards off
[1:50:55] the table oh you say it's innocent you
[1:50:57] see what it hatches
[1:50:59] out brother I wouldn't let a card light
[1:51:03] on my
[1:51:04] ground no sir it's a devil
[1:51:10] s keep away from it you say you're
[1:51:13] oldfashioned brother Brandon well it was
[1:51:15] an oldfashioned gospel save me amen it's
[1:51:20] oldfashioned salvation makes me happy it
[1:51:24] was oldfashioned holy ghost that healed
[1:51:27] me it's the same thing going to take us
[1:51:29] home to
[1:51:31] Glory sure teach your
[1:51:43] child could you use that this
[1:51:47] morning you know those are some of the
[1:51:49] things we've let Slipped
[1:51:51] Away we got so sometimes into so many
[1:51:56] Mysteries and things we've forgot the
[1:51:59] ABCs you know what I
[1:52:02] mean what it means and and what the
[1:52:06] foundation of Fellowship is is that
[1:52:10] we've all been saved by the blood of the
[1:52:12] Lamb we're Sinners and and that that's
[1:52:16] the question is is do you have that
[1:52:20] Fellowship you know and and that that
[1:52:23] fellowship's
[1:52:24] available to us so we don't want to and
[1:52:29] I I I guess I wish I had a better
[1:52:33] vocabulary but the message is not a
[1:52:36] substitute for Calvary it is the
[1:52:39] revelation of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:52:42] revelation of him that went to Calvary
[1:52:46] and the love that he had in his heart
[1:52:50] for his own God so Lov the world he gave
[1:52:54] his only begotten son you know we those
[1:52:58] foundations uh and the atmosphere what I
[1:53:00] loved about this tape so much was the
[1:53:03] spirit in which brother Brandon brought
[1:53:06] it the atmosphere he had how he
[1:53:09] approached Sinners how he approached
[1:53:12] alcoholics how that he approached things
[1:53:15] how he talked about how we approach one
[1:53:18] another how we love one another he said
[1:53:22] love is is the answer to it all it it
[1:53:25] sits way up there as the Capstone but
[1:53:29] you understand it's the completion
[1:53:31] because love and faith he said they work
[1:53:34] together you can't have faith without
[1:53:37] love love produces
[1:53:40] Faith so here we are at the end of it
[1:53:44] and what's he putting back on us he's
[1:53:47] trying to bring us back to the love
[1:53:50] because that's what the foundation
[1:53:52] started on see you can't go to Calvary
[1:53:56] and not get what produced
[1:54:02] Calvary let me say you can't go to
[1:54:05] Calvary and isn't
[1:54:08] really why that we're here today if
[1:54:11] you're just here because somebody
[1:54:14] explained the message to
[1:54:17] you that brother Bram was a prophet and
[1:54:19] you said brother bram's a prophet I
[1:54:21] forgot that and and you've never
[1:54:25] understood that what the prophet came
[1:54:28] for was to restore back the fellowship
[1:54:31] that's why one one of his very last
[1:54:33] sermons he preaches coming in 65 he says
[1:54:37] God's only provided place of worship
[1:54:41] he's bringing all the church after all
[1:54:45] the seals and everything he's trying to
[1:54:48] bring the church back to the love that
[1:54:53] God had for us and may the love of God
[1:54:57] be shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy
[1:55:01] Spirit and and when that kind of care
[1:55:04] comes in I like what he said he said if
[1:55:06] you've been to Calvary and you know that
[1:55:08] love he said the lack of that love is
[1:55:11] what makes you criticize your
[1:55:13] brother instead of saying oh it's all
[1:55:15] right they don't mean to do that and and
[1:55:22] that's what that's what it's all about
[1:55:25] and we can't forget that we can't forget
[1:55:29] that that love that he had for us has
[1:55:32] anybody ever been forgiven of your sins
[1:55:35] you know what it's
[1:55:36] like you know what it's like to walk up
[1:55:39] a him and and know everything that
[1:55:42] you've done and and he already knows it
[1:55:45] you know there's no need hiding it from
[1:55:48] them and just be honest with them and
[1:55:51] pray and and and just know when he comes
[1:55:54] and forgives your heart and lets you
[1:55:56] know I love you and I'll not leave you
[1:55:59] and I'll not forsake you but I'm going
[1:56:02] to walk you through it and then he he he
[1:56:07] he he didn't bring this message to
[1:56:10] separate us from one another he brought
[1:56:13] this message to separate us from the
[1:56:15] lies and the deceits of
[1:56:19] Satan you know the the the lies that the
[1:56:23] days of Miracles have passed all the
[1:56:25] lies of what the holy spirit is and what
[1:56:28] the evidence is all those lies were
[1:56:31] things that were just confusion that was
[1:56:35] sent by the enemy to keep us from having
[1:56:37] that real love in our heart and that
[1:56:39] real Fellowship in our heart have that
[1:56:42] real sweet nature and that real humble
[1:56:45] nature towards one another bringing
[1:56:49] in things to judge one another another
[1:56:52] by do you have the Holy Ghost you know
[1:56:56] have you spoken
[1:56:57] tongues I had
[1:57:00] people put that on me and just asked me
[1:57:03] well have you spoken Tong you I said do
[1:57:05] do you witness that I have the Holy
[1:57:10] Spirit have I prayed for the sick and
[1:57:12] and have they recovered have you know
[1:57:16] and yet have have I spoken tongues it
[1:57:21] didn't it doesn't
[1:57:23] matter because it's the blood of the
[1:57:25] lamb and this is what brother R said I'd
[1:57:28] rather have a church that loved one
[1:57:32] another really loved one
[1:57:36] another and didn't have one ounce of
[1:57:39] gifts but if you get the love he said
[1:57:42] the gifts will come and they're
[1:57:44] motivated not by P production they're
[1:57:47] motivated by love your heart's so
[1:57:50] burdened for somebody you you're in
[1:57:52] prayer all night long for somebody
[1:57:55] that's sick and the Lord speaks to your
[1:57:57] heart go take that handkerchief and your
[1:58:01] in your closet and go down to the uh
[1:58:03] hospital and lay your hand on them and
[1:58:07] and get the brothers together and pray
[1:58:08] for that together on that handkerchief
[1:58:11] bring it down there and put it on the
[1:58:12] brother and say we we're praying for you
[1:58:15] brother in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:58:17] Christ be well that love is what
[1:58:20] produces it you heard what what he said
[1:58:22] he said he said gifts cause
[1:58:27] confusion another see without the core
[1:58:32] Calvary
[1:58:35] experience without that real knowing
[1:58:39] that you're
[1:58:40] forgiven what what broke Adam's
[1:58:43] Fellowship what broke Adam's Fellowship
[1:58:46] because that think he let something come
[1:58:48] in between him and God and then when God
[1:58:51] come looking for him God knew that God
[1:58:54] wasn't the one who changed his
[1:58:56] Fellowship he still come looking for
[1:58:59] Adam he would have talked it over with
[1:59:01] Adam but Adam
[1:59:08] hid you know and and this is what I'm
[1:59:14] those of us who are here this
[1:59:17] morning do you understand we got to deal
[1:59:20] with our hearts
[1:59:22] we've got to deal with our attitude
[1:59:24] towards the Lord the fellowship do we
[1:59:26] have fellowship with
[1:59:28] him and if we have fellowship with him
[1:59:30] we have fellowship with one another it
[1:59:33] becomes it's the foundation of
[1:59:36] everything we're going and and I I I'm
[1:59:40] I've been preaching this message a long
[1:59:42] time and so I'm as guilty as
[1:59:45] anybody but sometimes we got out and we
[1:59:48] started building our churches on on the
[1:59:51] message
[1:59:53] and not understanding what the message
[1:59:56] was the message was the love redeeming
[2:00:01] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[2:00:05] all unrighteousness the redeeming he
[2:00:08] says that's my theme is the redeeming
[2:00:11] cleansing blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:14] it's that blood that heals us it's that
[2:00:17] love that God expressed it so he just
[2:00:20] didn't say I love you
[2:00:23] you understand he actually expressed
[2:00:26] that
[2:00:27] love by sending his only begotten son
[2:00:32] and that son dying for your sins and
[2:00:36] that's all that God required and so if
[2:00:39] you go there with your sins he's already
[2:00:43] there provided the sacrifice for you you
[2:00:47] accept that sacrifice you accept that
[2:00:50] love that love comes into your heart
[2:00:53] then the Holy Spirit spreads that love
[2:00:56] abroad with everybody you come in
[2:00:58] contact you're
[2:01:00] changed I like what he said he said it's
[2:01:03] the Simplicity of the Gospel that turns
[2:01:07] college students
[2:01:12] around I mean when I start listening to
[2:01:15] these thing I mean I I I start drawing
[2:01:18] lines and got it covered and start
[2:01:20] writing notes and thir 30 pages becomes
[2:01:23] the a volume for me why because it's
[2:01:28] Eternal God is
[2:01:31] love and you can't fake
[2:01:34] it it's a gift of God lest any man
[2:01:38] should
[2:01:40] boast and it's simple God puts you under
[2:01:46] conviction your heart gets torn your
[2:01:50] heart gets pricked
[2:01:52] you go to him you confess your sins to
[2:01:56] him and he's faithful and just to
[2:01:59] forgive you and he wipes that from you
[2:02:03] it causes you to love him and then he
[2:02:07] says I first L you you love me because I
[2:02:12] first love you if you love me love one
[2:02:16] another little children love one another
[2:02:20] care one for another be involved with
[2:02:23] one another pray one for another in
[2:02:26] other words the fact that you believe
[2:02:29] that William Brandon was a prophet of
[2:02:31] God that is an
[2:02:34] immuable fact that's as much as a fact
[2:02:38] as 2 plus two is four that is identified
[2:02:44] proved it it it it it's it's not even
[2:02:48] hard to believe the only reason not
[2:02:51] everybody beli believes it is because he
[2:02:53] hid it from them to to reveal it to you
[2:02:58] so that you could have some idea and
[2:03:02] identity of how much love he has for you
[2:03:06] that he showed you something so
[2:03:11] obvious and yet because there wasn't
[2:03:14] pure
[2:03:15] love they rejected it they rejected it
[2:03:19] out of jealousy they rejected it because
[2:03:22] they thought that they would lose their
[2:03:24] money they rejected it because they
[2:03:26] thought they'd lose their influence we
[2:03:28] don't have in any influence we have an
[2:03:31] absolute we have an absolute thus saith
[2:03:35] the Lord message we don't have to have
[2:03:38] big eyes we don't have to have little
[2:03:42] use we've all been cleansed by the blood
[2:03:45] of the Lamb so let us start applying the
[2:03:48] token
[2:03:52] let us love one another that we get
[2:03:55] unrighteousness out of our lives that we
[2:03:57] care one for another that let's be what
[2:04:00] the first church really was what was
[2:04:02] restored back to them those people had
[2:04:05] Fellowship one with another because they
[2:04:07] they all realize the price one another
[2:04:11] paid from coming out from the Jewish
[2:04:15] faith the Gentiles that came out from
[2:04:18] their families and started Fallen us
[2:04:20] they all bore the reproach
[2:04:22] we're not trying to Bear the reproach
[2:04:24] anymore we're trying to cover it up by
[2:04:27] being just like everybody else having
[2:04:29] every other program Under the Sun let's
[2:04:32] get a
[2:04:34] gymnasium pretty soon we got gyms we got
[2:04:37] this you know I I hope someday we don't
[2:04:40] get swimming
[2:04:44] pools see we're starting to get away
[2:04:47] from it really what are what it is
[2:04:52] it's all about his love for us and that
[2:04:56] love contacting us and we get involved
[2:05:00] in that Fellowship in that love and that
[2:05:04] love wherein he loved us brother Jim hay
[2:05:08] shared that scripture with me and it
[2:05:11] just he just shared it at such a perfect
[2:05:13] time lord almost speaking from his lips
[2:05:16] he said herein is the love of God made
[2:05:20] perfect as he he is so are we in this
[2:05:28] world that's what it start it's what it
[2:05:30] comes back to ask yourself this morning
[2:05:34] do you love
[2:05:36] them ask yourself am I in fellowship
[2:05:39] with
[2:05:40] him do I talk to him in the
[2:05:44] morning do I talk to him at
[2:05:48] night or do I have all kinds of things
[2:05:52] that are keeping me out of Fellowship
[2:05:55] cuz that's the only thing the enemy
[2:05:57] wants to do did you hear what he said if
[2:05:59] you're in fellowship with God then you
[2:06:02] know he'll take care of
[2:06:07] everything when you're in fellowship
[2:06:09] with him he you know he'll take care of
[2:06:11] everything you know he's got
[2:06:14] you you can you just know he's in the
[2:06:18] palm of his hand he know that he loves
[2:06:20] you he know you won't he won't forsake
[2:06:23] you and when you do wrong you're
[2:06:25] sorry and you say Aba father I I'm sorry
[2:06:29] Lord my flesh got in the way I I have
[2:06:32] this weakness I I I fall but but Lord
[2:06:36] you know I know that you chose me I know
[2:06:40] that you died for me I know that you
[2:06:42] separated me from sin I know you want me
[2:06:46] to do good I know you want me to be
[2:06:48] Christlike you want me to lay a pattern
[2:06:50] of good work works I'm not part of a
[2:06:53] group Lord this is between me and you
[2:06:57] once the prophet God said I'd love to do
[2:06:58] anything he says but what I love more
[2:07:00] than anything else is getting on top of
[2:07:03] that mountain and talking to God he says
[2:07:06] some days I'll be up there two or three
[2:07:08] days under the same tree just
[2:07:13] fellowshipping do you believe that he
[2:07:15] wants to have that with
[2:07:18] you if if Satan tells you you're
[2:07:22] if Satan tells you you're not worthy
[2:07:24] well you know that's a lie huh because
[2:07:27] he's a
[2:07:30] liar God wants to have
[2:07:34] Fellowship the prophet of God said Jesus
[2:07:36] Christ will be here on this platform in
[2:07:40] just a few
[2:07:42] minutes doing the same things he did
[2:07:46] when he was here on
[2:07:48] Earth to show you that he wants to have
[2:07:53] fellowship with you not to make you a
[2:07:57] smarty
[2:07:59] pants not to make you a know it
[2:08:02] all not to make you puffed up not so
[2:08:06] some preachers can go in there and take
[2:08:09] the teachings and the revelations that
[2:08:12] brother brandham taught make them so
[2:08:14] complicated start teaching them in so
[2:08:17] many different ways that you sit there
[2:08:19] and say well I never seen that before
[2:08:21] before I never looked at it that way
[2:08:23] before I never thought that way before
[2:08:26] you know why you've never been to
[2:08:32] Calvary but when you know he's the one
[2:08:36] that saved you when you know he's the
[2:08:39] one that forgave you of your sins when
[2:08:41] you know he loves you he won't forsake
[2:08:44] you you don't care you can say what
[2:08:46] brother brandham said when they said to
[2:08:48] him brother Bram you just don't know
[2:08:49] your Bible he said yeah but I know the
[2:08:51] author real
[2:08:55] well I know the author real
[2:08:59] well and and and why work with try to go
[2:09:04] out and work with the rest of the world
[2:09:06] when we need to work right in here till
[2:09:09] everybody's got the love of God shed
[2:09:12] abroad in their heart all our young
[2:09:14] people have the Holy Spirit all not some
[2:09:18] emotional not some gift thing that they
[2:09:21] have love in their heart the love of God
[2:09:25] shed abroad in their heart by the Holy
[2:09:28] Spirit not our love of God not our love
[2:09:32] to God but his love shed abroad in our
[2:09:37] heart to one another when they meet you
[2:09:40] they meet the love of God why do you
[2:09:43] love because brother you can look at
[2:09:45] them and says I know you're rank I know
[2:09:47] you got tattoos from your toes I know
[2:09:50] you got a bone in your nose
[2:09:51] but let me tell you Jesus
[2:09:54] Christ loves you and died for you and
[2:09:58] just the shape you're in he can put a
[2:10:01] new heart in
[2:10:02] you and then when we feel that
[2:10:06] way to those out that we come in contact
[2:10:10] to the world we feel that way when we
[2:10:13] wake up in the morning thank you Lord
[2:10:15] I'm glad to be alive what would you have
[2:10:18] me do today when you love them and the
[2:10:21] love of God's in your heart and and and
[2:10:24] you know that he first loved you and you
[2:10:27] love him because he's extended that hand
[2:10:29] of love to
[2:10:31] you oh then you don't worry about
[2:10:35] it no it ain't you're not getting in
[2:10:39] because you understand the seventh seal
[2:10:42] or you understand the third pole nobody
[2:10:45] understands the third poll I've been in
[2:10:47] this message 50 years I've talked to
[2:10:49] every doctrinal genius in this message
[2:10:54] they don't understand the third pole
[2:10:56] they don't understand the seven seal
[2:10:58] they're trying to get it intellectually
[2:11:01] and the prophet of God said you can't
[2:11:03] come to intellect to the love of God
[2:11:06] through
[2:11:07] intellect God's got to give it to you
[2:11:10] and when he gives it to you you got it
[2:11:13] and when you've got love you've got
[2:11:15] power to conquer anything
[2:11:23] you're not going to go up like the sons
[2:11:25] of sephus did and say oh Satan you move
[2:11:28] I I believe in the Seven
[2:11:31] Seals he going to look at you says that
[2:11:33] was there when the Seven Seals revealed
[2:11:37] son you don't think he's
[2:11:43] religious one Apostle put it this where
[2:11:47] Satan believes also and he fears and
[2:11:50] trembles
[2:11:52] there's only one
[2:11:56] power fear and love love produces
[2:12:01] Faith you can have
[2:12:06] faith without
[2:12:08] love Love's got to come
[2:12:11] first it's got to come first I I have
[2:12:14] have
[2:12:15] so you know I I I wrote notes as I I I
[2:12:20] was listening this tape I started
[2:12:22] writing notes and then the more notes I
[2:12:25] wrote the more I realized I was
[2:12:29] missing and and and so you know you it
[2:12:33] just church it it's it comes back to the
[2:12:38] that that place again he says you know
[2:12:40] we want faith we want power we want
[2:12:46] works that's what the church is that's
[2:12:48] what the big confusion is today we want
[2:12:51] power we want works we want a
[2:12:54] demonstration we want to fight the devil
[2:12:57] you fight the devil I'm going to
[2:13:02] run I'm going to run from the devil and
[2:13:05] if he catches me I'm going to take the
[2:13:08] word of God and I'm going to cut his
[2:13:10] head
[2:13:12] off but I'm not looking for a fight with
[2:13:14] the
[2:13:19] devil I'm not
[2:13:22] you understand I'm going to stay on my
[2:13:25] ground in my realm in my joy in my peace
[2:13:30] and if he tries to come in I'm going to
[2:13:32] possess the Gate of the enemy I I'm
[2:13:35] going to rise up against him saying you
[2:13:37] can't come here you can't take this from
[2:13:40] me and if he brings sickness or he
[2:13:42] brings trouble in my home I can go to
[2:13:45] Calvary and I can lay it out before the
[2:13:47] Lord and I can beseech the Lord on the
[2:13:50] behalf of that person person I love and
[2:13:52] love will get the
[2:13:55] victory cuz that's what he's trying to
[2:13:57] cap this sted
[2:14:00] off but he said you got to have love
[2:14:03] first because love produces Faith love
[2:14:07] is the atmosphere that God can and will
[2:14:12] work
[2:14:14] in and we heard him
[2:14:16] say it ain't a workup
[2:14:23] it ain't trying to get the anointing to
[2:14:25] fall you know what you want let the love
[2:14:28] of God could be shed and broaden your
[2:14:31] heart you let everybody love one and
[2:14:34] tell when you're sick brother and he's
[2:14:36] sick and you hear he sick that your
[2:14:39] heart bleeds for
[2:14:41] him brother mcar I know you're going
[2:14:43] into surgery Tuesday for your eye I'll
[2:14:46] be praying for you I know God's going to
[2:14:49] make it work it's going to be be happy I
[2:14:52] don't have to sit there and say oh God
[2:14:55] heal my eye oh if I was a Believer no he
[2:14:58] going to use a doctor
[2:15:01] Hallelujah I'm good with
[2:15:04] that I'm good with
[2:15:06] that I know who I am I know he loved me
[2:15:11] this I don't have to prove to him that I
[2:15:14] love him and he loves me by me producing
[2:15:18] some sort of miracle
[2:15:23] what's happened to
[2:15:25] us what just happened to Simply loving
[2:15:28] one
[2:15:30] another caring one for another feeling
[2:15:35] apart I don't want you to come to church
[2:15:38] and feel like a
[2:15:39] stranger I don't want you to feel like
[2:15:42] I'm too busy and you can't call me I
[2:15:45] don't want you to feel that I'm
[2:15:47] something that's up here and you're down
[2:15:49] there I hate that I hate it I hate it I
[2:15:53] hate
[2:15:55] it I'm in this battle with
[2:15:59] you I can't make it without
[2:16:02] you I fall just like we all
[2:16:07] fall but there's something that holds us
[2:16:11] together God's opened our eyes to see
[2:16:14] what he's doing in this day and we've
[2:16:17] declared unto you the things which we
[2:16:19] have heard and which we have seen and
[2:16:22] therefore we have Fellowship one with
[2:16:26] another and with him that cleanses us
[2:16:30] from all unrighteousness when we get
[2:16:34] back to creating that atmosphere around
[2:16:38] each of us as individuals when we get
[2:16:41] back to what's
[2:16:44] important all these other things will
[2:16:47] follow but man's always trying to get
[2:16:50] the
[2:16:51] cart before the
[2:16:54] horse you know what pulls the church
[2:16:58] love love is the
[2:17:01] power love is the source love is what
[2:17:05] gets you down the road and you can get
[2:17:08] behind the cart with all your
[2:17:10] Revelations and all your doctrines and
[2:17:13] all your great preaching Styles and all
[2:17:16] your emotions and and everything and
[2:17:19] push that cart but It Will Never Move It
[2:17:23] Like Love
[2:17:24] Can and boy if you just get that
[2:17:27] Simplicity in your heart if if all of us
[2:17:30] would just go back and renew our
[2:17:34] vow with the

[2:17:54] taken advantage of and relatives have
[2:17:57] done terrible things to
[2:18:00] them I I couldn't even explain to you
[2:18:03] the some of the things that I I I've
[2:18:07] heard uh young sisters tell me of how
[2:18:11] how they were
[2:18:14] treated but yet that love of God can
[2:18:18] come down and wash it all away take all
[2:18:23] the stains take all the guilt take all
[2:18:27] the burden it's a completely different
[2:18:29] realm it's a different world you walk
[2:18:33] out of this world your eyes don't see
[2:18:36] turns your thoughts from Evil to good
[2:18:40] and you're living in a world that's full
[2:18:42] of love that's full of light that's fill
[2:18:45] of Joy Satan brought malice eny hatred
[2:18:50] Satan made the animals eat one another
[2:18:54] Satan did all this and then he said if
[2:18:56] you could just get in that
[2:18:58] love he says no animal would ever hurt
[2:19:02] you he said I was scared at
[2:19:06] first then the spirit reminded him who
[2:19:09] he
[2:19:11] was and what God had done for him and he
[2:19:14] said I'm a Child of
[2:19:16] God God loves me and I love you Bull and
[2:19:22] I'm sorry I love you bees and tell I'm
[2:19:26] sorry said you can't fake
[2:19:28] it but he couldn't preach
[2:19:31] it unless it was there for us to
[2:19:37] have you understand what I'm saying he
[2:19:40] couldn't preach it and the reason we
[2:19:43] seek after doctrines the reason we seek
[2:19:47] after theology the reason that we seek
[2:19:50] after
[2:19:51] all these vanities is because we haven't
[2:19:54] come face to face with the one that gave
[2:19:59] his life for
[2:20:00] us and we haven't
[2:20:03] accepted and we haven't
[2:20:06] confessed all our sins and all our
[2:20:09] shortcomings we just haven't got
[2:20:13] alone you know the greatest
[2:20:16] surgeries that can ever be performed is
[2:20:20] performed in the smallest
[2:20:22] room called the
[2:20:26] closet what would you do with the heart
[2:20:28] doctor or the brain
[2:20:30] surgeon took you down the hall and
[2:20:33] opened the broom closet and said this is
[2:20:36] where we're going to do
[2:20:40] surgery that the kind of doctor I'd want
[2:20:44] the one to get down on my knees and say
[2:20:47] you know I can go in there but I want
[2:20:49] you to know that if Jesus Christ doesn't
[2:20:52] guide my hand you may not come out of
[2:20:55] this where he gets all the
[2:20:58] glory it's all about him and and we try
[2:21:02] to have his
[2:21:04] Spirit don't matter
[2:21:06] if someone offends you did you hear what
[2:21:09] brother R said he said if I knew
[2:21:11] somebody I offended or somebody was mad
[2:21:13] at me I'd be on his doorstep in the
[2:21:17] morning because he don't want nothing in
[2:21:21] between don't let nothing get in
[2:21:26] between keep your path clear between one
[2:21:30] another care one for another reach out
[2:21:33] don't let your language be a barrier
[2:21:36] don't let your cultures be a barrier you
[2:21:39] know me I don't believe in culture I
[2:21:40] believe there's one culture word
[2:21:43] culture and no matter where we're from
[2:21:46] all of us have to come into that
[2:21:49] Capstone all of us have to have that
[2:21:51] love and I've been all over the world
[2:21:54] and I've met people with that love and
[2:21:56] their heart and when you meet them you
[2:22:00] connect and they love you and you love
[2:22:03] them and you don't care what they
[2:22:08] believe because you know they
[2:22:10] have the
[2:22:13] source of all comfort and all joy Jesus
[2:22:18] is the comfort and the source of all joy
[2:22:22] he's the answer let's don't fake it
[2:22:26] let's don't worry about what one another
[2:22:30] thinks let's don't think about our
[2:22:33] religion let's think about our
[2:22:36] heart and ask yourself is Jesus in my
[2:22:41] heart do I know he's forgiven me do I
[2:22:45] know he loves me do I know that nothing
[2:22:49] can pluck me out of the palm of his hand
[2:22:53] do I know if he started a work in me
[2:22:56] he'll finish it to the end do I know I'm
[2:22:59] his sheep and I hear his voice do I know
[2:23:03] I don't have to
[2:23:05] worry that
[2:23:08] nothing no apparel no sword no Enemy No
[2:23:13] Spirits in high places nothing can
[2:23:17] separate me from the love of God God
[2:23:21] that's in Christ
[2:23:23] Jesus and that's this
[2:23:26] morning church that I desire that every
[2:23:30] single one of us knows
[2:23:33] assuredly you see I've been sick a long
[2:23:35] time you just say Satan I've been sick a
[2:23:38] long time I'm sick but nothing can
[2:23:41] separate me from the love of Jesus
[2:23:43] Christ and I'm believing with all my
[2:23:46] heart that that love that he has for me
[2:23:49] one day
[2:23:51] he has a reason and he has a time and
[2:23:54] when that time comes I'm going to walk
[2:23:57] free and I'm going to testify of his
[2:24:00] love of his endurance how he stuck with
[2:24:04] me how he never forsake me and I'm going
[2:24:07] to give him all the
[2:24:09] glory I don't have to work up a healing
[2:24:12] I don't have to produce nothing I've
[2:24:15] turned every stone I've confessed all my
[2:24:18] sins I've placed it in my hands the hour
[2:24:22] is
[2:24:24] his and I'll just wait I'll put my eye
[2:24:28] on the end of the road like the boy on
[2:24:30] the bicycle who pedal down that 2x4
[2:24:33] everybody fell off cuz they were looking
[2:24:35] for this trying to make this correction
[2:24:38] trying to adjust that adjustment he just
[2:24:41] said I put it all in his hands I looked
[2:24:43] at the prize and I just kept
[2:24:49] going I like what the man said he had
[2:24:52] his Bible and he said well he said I'm
[2:24:54] not what
[2:24:57] I want to be I'm not what I supposed to
[2:25:02] be but I sure ain't what I used to
[2:25:05] be and brother R he said he made a
[2:25:08] statement in this thing he said when
[2:25:10] love is
[2:25:15] perfected and without perfect love we
[2:25:18] won't be there and that's what we we got
[2:25:20] to start
[2:25:21] perfecting our
[2:25:24] conversations our attitudes our
[2:25:27] awareness of one another and I need more
[2:25:30] help than that than
[2:25:33] anybody you know I I grew up a loner I I
[2:25:37] I got a lot of complexes but I want that
[2:25:39] love of God to let me listen I want that
[2:25:42] love of God to make me see what's going
[2:25:45] on in somebody's life I want the love of
[2:25:47] God shed abroad in my heart
[2:25:50] by the Holy Spirit isn't that really
[2:25:53] where we want to go don't you believe
[2:25:55] really that's what brother Brandon was
[2:25:57] trying to take
[2:25:59] us he said that's the way to True
[2:26:03] Fellowship is you and God under the shed
[2:26:07] blood and you know he's got you and if
[2:26:10] he has
[2:26:12] you what do you worried about if God be
[2:26:16] for you who can be against you if if you
[2:26:20] haven't had that experience with the
[2:26:24] Lord I encourage you to ask
[2:26:30] him the answer is the
[2:26:34] closet I could pray for you but if you
[2:26:37] don't go to your
[2:26:39] closet and you don't get shut in with
[2:26:41] God and you don't take care of it with
[2:26:44] him
[2:26:46] personally the outward show is isn't
[2:26:50] going to
[2:26:52] matter but if you will get in your heart
[2:26:54] and be honest with him he'll be
[2:26:58] honest with you and if you've been cold
[2:27:03] and
[2:27:04] indifferent and
[2:27:06] formal ask him to set your heart a
[2:27:09] flame ask him to renew your love
[2:27:14] story ask him that let that
[2:27:18] love surround you
[2:27:22] the Capstone is
[2:27:24] here for every
[2:27:27] believer to enter
[2:27:31] into I hope you heard
[2:27:34] me the capping of the church the love of
[2:27:38] God is here for every believer to enter
[2:27:43] into if that's the longing and desire of
[2:27:48] your heart even so
[2:27:51] come quickly Lord Jesus let's Stand
[2:28:13] Together Julie could you guys play that
[2:28:17] song at one I guess if there is a of
[2:28:20] blood or that
[2:28:22] one Billy if you could grab a mic to
[2:28:25] help me
[2:28:33] sing you know I I thought how often do I
[2:28:37] think of
[2:28:39] Calvary how often do I go back to where
[2:28:43] I'm in
[2:28:47] [Music]
[2:28:48] him how often do I start a
[2:28:51] day remembering that the only reason I
[2:28:54] have the Breath of
[2:28:57] Life is because he's kept
[2:29:00] me all these
[2:29:05] years how much time does he occupy in my
[2:29:10] heart in my
[2:29:13] mind and I want to go
[2:29:16] back maybe you just go back with me this
[2:29:19] morning
[2:29:22] because you're only going to find them
[2:29:24] where you left them yes maybe you just
[2:29:28] go back to where you got saved
[2:29:31] and when that conviction came on your
[2:29:34] heart you cried out to
[2:29:37] him and he answered
[2:29:40] you and maybe you just enter in for a
[2:29:43] few moments this morning and you'll just
[2:29:46] go back and think
[2:29:48] [Music]
[2:29:50] about how good he's been to
[2:29:55] you like David he looked back and he sat
[2:30:00] in that great palace and he looked out
[2:30:04] over that sheep
[2:30:08] field saw a little Shepherd out
[2:30:12] there tending the
[2:30:15] Sheep just a boy about his age
[2:30:20] and he sat and thought where God brought
[2:30:22] him
[2:30:25] from how he slew Goliath
[2:30:29] and how he defeated the enemies
[2:30:32] and how he was on the run from Saul
[2:30:37] and and how God kept
[2:30:41] them placed them on the
[2:30:46] throne and his heart would begin to sing
[2:30:53] can you feel that
[2:30:54] way can you enter into that Fellowship
[2:30:57] do you still have it in your
[2:30:59] heart don't let your heart grow
[2:31:02] cold that's the curse of this age is a
[2:31:05] cold
[2:31:06] heart a heart sheared with a hot
[2:31:10] [Music]
[2:31:11] iron but if you go to him he'll give you
[2:31:14] take that Stony heart out and replace it
[2:31:19] with the heart
[2:31:20] would you just think about it this
[2:31:22] morning will you think about how much
[2:31:24] you love

[2:31:33] heart will you start forgiving everybody
[2:31:37] that's ever done anything against you
