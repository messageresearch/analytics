[17:08] you've overcome them all and through us
[17:10] lord you're overcoming them once again

[17:15] pews this building even lord
[17:17] may we dwell in realms that only you can
[17:20] take us lord where we
[17:22] lord receive
[17:23] what we have need of here this morning
[17:25] lord it's by the quickening of your word
[17:27] and your presence here today lord so
[17:29] lord may we lay a thought
[17:31] lay aside all those thoughts that would
[17:33] hinder and
[17:34] and go before us and behind us lord but
[17:37] may you just dwell with us here in the
[17:38] present lord because you are the i am
[17:40] the great i am
[17:42] lord your word says that you're a high
[17:44] priest that can be touched by the very
[17:46] feeling of our infirmities lord
[17:49] so whether we express it
[17:51] lord in our
[17:53] in our songs and our whispers of prayers
[17:55] lord and just the unction of our heart
[17:57] lord you know what we have need of so

[18:10] reaches out to lord that
[18:12] are struggling in this time and have
[18:14] many many problems
[18:16] but lord you've overcome them as we've
[18:18] said so
[18:19] lord we pray that you just be in our
[18:21] midst and
[18:23] lord as paul said that
[18:24] may we be zealous in good things lord
[18:30] he said even when i'm not with you
[18:33] and lord we don't have the physical
[18:36] body of our prophet or the lord jesus
[18:38] here but lord you're here in a greater
[18:40] and mightier way displaying yourselves
[18:42] in
[18:42] multi beings here this morning lord if
[18:44] we can realize lord that we house
[18:47] the very god of creation within us lord
[18:50] that we can
[18:51] lift you up lord by by us being lifted
[18:54] up
[18:55] lord we neglect even our own physical
[18:58] bodies and our thoughts and our things
[18:59] lord we give you preeminence then you
[19:01] have the glory we worship you truly in
[19:03] spirit and true so bless us this day
[19:05] lord your word comes forth
[19:07] we just lean on you ask these things in
[19:09] the name of the lord jesus christ amen
[19:15] amen
[19:17] man good to be in the house of god
[19:19] amen will survive the weak we are here
[19:22] amen thankful that the lord has
[19:24] protected every one of us
[19:26] amen certainly
[19:28] welcome all of you the visitors and
[19:30] we'll certainly help you have you in the
[19:32] house of god but i can come for a psalm
[19:34] reading this morning
[19:48] wow
[19:57] one of the things
[20:12] looking at how this man prayed
[20:15] and what you know the sincerity of his
[20:17] heart and the things that he would cry
[20:19] out for and the things that would be
[20:20] burdens to him
[20:22] you know you can kind of see what that
[20:24] looks like to be a man
[20:26] after god's own heart what his desires
[20:28] were things like that psalm 141 is an
[20:31] example of this
[20:33] we'll be
[20:34] reading that
[20:36] this morning
[20:38] you know it's a beautiful chapter it's a
[20:42] real earnest prayer and there's there's
[20:44] so much
[20:45] in here really
[20:47] but you know
[20:48] one verse in particular just stuck out
[20:50] to me i
[20:51] i couldn't quite get away from it and
[20:53] it's in verse three
[20:56] says set a watch oh lord
[20:58] before my mouth
[21:00] keep the door of my lips
[21:04] you know and it seems like such a basic
[21:05] sunday school principle we learn from
[21:08] the time that we're children
[21:10] oh be careful little mouth what you say
[21:13] you know
[21:14] don't lie don't say bad words don't talk
[21:17] bad about people that seems like such a
[21:19] basic principle
[21:22] but you know here there's a man after
[21:23] god's own heart that's praying lord keep
[21:26] my mouth
[21:28] you know it turns out it's not so easy
[21:29] to do
[21:31] you know even james says that
[21:33] the tongue can no man tame
[21:36] it is an unruly evil
[21:38] full of deadly poison
[21:41] therewith
[21:42] bless we god and therewith curse we men
[21:48] you know and really without
[21:50] a change in the source of the fountain
[21:52] we can't we can't control what comes out
[21:55] of it
[21:57] but you know as i was meditating on that
[21:59] it occurred to me that for people
[22:01] who are after god's own heart it's more
[22:03] than just about not saying
[22:06] bad words or
[22:08] lying
[22:10] but it's a daily prayer to keep a watch
[22:13] care over our mouth that nothing comes
[22:15] out of our
[22:16] speech
[22:18] that isn't his word
[22:22] you know not to keep us from saying
[22:23] something bad
[22:25] but to make sure we only speak what he
[22:27] would have us speak
[22:31] you know paul makes this statement you
[22:32] know in first corinthians 14 10 he says
[22:36] there are it may be
[22:38] so many kinds of voices in the world
[22:41] and none of them are without
[22:42] signification
[22:44] you know we're surrounded by voices you
[22:46] know there's voices and narratives and
[22:49] you know all kinds of things around us
[22:53] you know that can can fill our ears with
[22:56] all kinds of narratives and and
[22:59] you know all kinds of uh things that we
[23:02] might say other than the word
[23:05] you know i know it says in john 10 that
[23:06] my sheep hear my voice
[23:09] and a stranger they will not follow but
[23:10] it doesn't mean that there's not going
[23:12] to be a struggle to avoid saying
[23:13] something that isn't first
[23:16] what he would say
[23:18] thus saith the lord or keep still i
[23:20] think is one way that brother branham
[23:23] said it
[23:25] you know i think one of the big dangers
[23:26] of social media you know for example is
[23:29] people have the ability to post any
[23:31] thought that comes to them
[23:33] give voice to any narrative and there's
[23:36] this constant pressure to engage in that
[23:38] to respond to that to react in that
[23:42] you know but as witnesses of the word we
[23:44] have to be so careful
[23:46] that we're not carrying a narrative
[23:49] that isn't his narrative
[23:51] liking something
[23:52] that he would not even have us
[23:54] pay attention to
[23:56] sharing or reposting or retweeting or
[23:59] responding to the pressure of say
[24:01] something you know you have to speak out
[24:04] you know there are growing socially
[24:06] accepted narratives in the land where
[24:09] there's constant pressure this constant
[24:11] expectation to add your voice to theirs
[24:15] if we're not careful it can become easy
[24:17] to fall into the trap
[24:19] of carrying a torch that isn't his being
[24:21] a witness
[24:23] for something that isn't his
[24:25] you know that's the
[24:27] just like david we have to pray daily
[24:30] lord keep a watch care over my
[24:32] mouth
[24:33] that what comes out of it is nothing but
[24:36] what he would
[24:37] have me say
[24:38] that's something that a man after god's
[24:40] own heart had the daily pray and how can
[24:42] it be any less
[24:44] for us you know the devil is constantly
[24:46] trying we're witnesses the devil is
[24:47] constantly constantly trying to get us
[24:49] to witness something different
[24:51] than what the word
[24:53] would have us say so in verse 3 said a
[24:56] watch o lord
[24:58] before my mouth
[25:00] keep the door
[25:01] of my lips
[25:04] you know i like instead what david says
[25:05] in psalm 45 1. he says this my heart
[25:09] is indicting a good matter
[25:11] i speak of things
[25:14] which i have made touching the king
[25:17] my tongue is the pen of a ready writer
[25:22] i stand ready in other words to carry
[25:25] the king's
[25:26] narrative to open my mouth and let him
[25:30] speak
[25:32] you know we live in the evil age many
[25:35] voices lots of pressures laodicea to
[25:37] carry some other voice
[25:39] the only thing i would do is maybe
[25:40] finish up before we start reading psalm
[25:42] 141 is that other book to the
[25:45] children of laodicea
[25:47] colossians
[25:49] says in chapter four continue in prayer
[25:52] and watching the same with thanksgiving
[25:55] just like david
[25:56] with all praying also for us
[25:58] that god would open unto us a door of
[26:01] utterance to speak the mystery
[26:04] of christ
[26:06] that i may make it manifest as i ought
[26:09] to speak
[26:12] walk in wisdom toward them that are with
[26:14] that without redeeming the time
[26:17] let your speech be alway
[26:19] with grace
[26:21] seasoned with salt
[26:23] that ye may know how ye ought to answer
[26:26] to every man amen
[26:28] you know i think that's some good advice
[26:30] from the first messenger
[26:32] to those of us in this last stage
[26:34] colossians has written to laodicea as
[26:36] well you can see that in colossians 4
[26:38] 16.
[26:40] but you know as i'm just was looking at
[26:41] that over psalm 141 that would be my
[26:43] prayer
[26:45] set a watch over my lips
[26:47] over my mouth that nothing that i speak
[26:50] would be different than his own
[26:51] narrative and that i would not fall into
[26:53] the trap of picking up another and
[26:55] making that being a witness for someone
[26:57] else's message
[26:59] let's just you know read that together
[27:01] again as so much in this prayer so much
[27:03] that we could look at but that's just
[27:04] what stuck out to me this morning i hope
[27:06] it's a
[27:07] blessing to everyone we'll read that
[27:08] together psalm 141
[27:11] lord i cry unto thee
[27:14] make haste unto me give ear unto my
[27:17] voice when i cry unto thee let my prayer
[27:20] be set forth before thee as incense and
[27:23] the lifting up of my hands as the
[27:25] evening sacrifice
[27:27] said a watch o lord before my mouth keep
[27:30] the door of my lips
[27:32] incline not my ear to any evil thing to
[27:35] practice wicked works with men that work
[27:38] iniquity and let me not eat of their
[27:40] dainties
[27:42] let the righteous smite me it shall be a
[27:44] kindness and let him reprove me it shall
[27:47] be an excellent oil which shall not
[27:50] break my head for yet my prayer also
[27:53] shall be in their calamities when their
[27:55] judges are overthrown in stony places
[27:58] they shall hear my words for they are
[28:00] sweet
[28:01] our bones are scattered at the grave's
[28:03] mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth
[28:06] wood upon the earth
[28:07] but mine eyes are upon thee o god the
[28:10] lord in thee is my trust leave not my
[28:14] soul destitute keep me from the snares
[28:17] which they have laid for me and the
[28:19] jinns of the workers of iniquity
[28:21] let the wicked fall into their own nets
[28:24] whilst that i with all escape

[53:40] a good day we're back we're back home
[53:42] with our family
[53:44] and uh
[53:46] um that's all that's important right now
[53:47] to us that's
[53:49] where
[53:51] we're homeless
[53:52] right now but we're home and with our
[53:54] family and that's all that matters
[53:55] that's all that matters to us
[53:57] and um
[53:58] this week uh
[54:00] this week
[54:02] for all of us it was it was a hard week
[54:04] uh but for us especially because uh
[54:07] you know we have a newborn just like
[54:08] some of my brothers and sisters
[54:10] and um
[54:12] we were we were home
[54:14] and it was probably the coldest night
[54:16] and uh
[54:18] uh it got really cold and we were
[54:20] sleeping in front of the fireplace
[54:22] because we didn't have any power so
[54:25] um we were sleeping there and it just
[54:26] got really cold and my wife were
[54:28] debating what did we do where do we go
[54:30] um
[54:31] should we go to my parents uh somewhere
[54:34] because they were losing power and
[54:35] didn't have any water so we didn't know
[54:36] what to do
[54:37] and uh it was really late in the evening
[54:40] we said let's go let's go we got to go
[54:41] somewhere we can't have the baby here my
[54:43] five-year-old my kids everything so we
[54:45] just got packed up in two cars and we
[54:47] went
[54:48] straight to uh my parents house where it
[54:50] was a bit warmer and um
[54:54] after that uh you know we stayed there
[54:56] we
[54:57] woke up in this the next morning my
[54:59] father-in-law went to our home and
[55:01] um
[55:02] the ceiling caved in
[55:04] the whole this whole ceiling some pipe
[55:05] burst and
[55:07] all that other good stuff that's
[55:09] happening
[55:10] so uh you know i was just thinking well
[55:12] what am i going to do what am i going to
[55:13] do
[55:14] um you know i stopped i wasn't thinking
[55:17] like god had has taught us to think
[55:20] and uh
[55:22] you know that's where
[55:24] you know that voice those those uh
[55:26] voices of the world start telling you
[55:27] hey
[55:28] it's payday
[55:30] you know do this do that you're gonna
[55:31] get paid your money all that good stuff
[55:33] they start talking about and
[55:35] and for me it it
[55:37] i hadn't been coming here lately and i'm
[55:39] sure some of you don't notice because
[55:40] i'm usually back there interpreting uh
[55:43] but i hadn't been coming because my wife
[55:44] was sick or whatever it was that i
[55:46] couldn't make it
[55:47] and when
[55:49] the further i got
[55:50] the more those voices
[55:52] those voices started
[55:54] making sense and i don't know it was
[55:56] brother david one of my brothers i heard
[55:58] a sermon here of that black dog in the
[56:00] white dog
[56:01] you know and that black dog is just you
[56:03] know barking barking okay yeah that's
[56:05] right
[56:06] and i had a loved one tell me
[56:08] you know what you can make some money
[56:10] off of this you know this is the way you
[56:12] need to do this do this do that
[56:14] and uh you know it started making
[56:16] consistent i said no wait a minute
[56:18] that's not what god has taught me he
[56:19] hasn't taught me to do that she said
[56:21] yeah but it's yours you've been paying
[56:22] all these years the insurance is going
[56:23] to pay you do this
[56:25] do that
[56:26] and all that evening all day you know
[56:29] everybody that was telling me this is
[56:31] the time this is the time where you get
[56:32] paid
[56:33] and uh
[56:35] i it was just it was just really
[56:36] stressful and
[56:38] i went to sleep like that and i woke up
[56:40] the next morning and i was praying okay
[56:41] god i can't do this i'm not gonna do
[56:43] this
[56:44] and
[56:46] my brother uh my brother hoel
[56:49] sends me a text out of nowhere
[56:51] i don't know where timothy uh
[56:53] timothy first timothy 6 10 where uh the
[56:58] the evil the root of all evil is money
[57:01] and if you wander far from faith and i'm
[57:02] just paraphrasing
[57:05] you're going to have griefs
[57:06] so
[57:08] right there
[57:09] i just felt it um like he has done many
[57:12] many times in my life where i just feel
[57:14] him
[57:15] you know come down and say
[57:18] how's your family
[57:20] where is your family are they okay
[57:22] and i realized
[57:25] where the roof caved in was where my
[57:28] newborn
[57:29] my five-year-old and my wife were
[57:31] sleeping right in front of the fireplace
[57:34] everything caved in
[57:36] and that's where i realized
[57:38] how much god has done for me
[57:40] and and and i just felt him you know and
[57:42] it's just this like this i'm sure some
[57:44] of your brothers know it's an
[57:45] overwhelming feeling and it feels so
[57:47] good and it just
[57:48] you just break down
[57:50] and god telling me when have i ever
[57:52] blessed you with money i've never
[57:54] blessed you with money and i knew it i
[57:56] knew it i don't know how that happened
[57:58] and in in many times i failed and i
[58:01] asked him for forgiveness because i
[58:03] we've seen his hand so many times in our
[58:04] lives me and my wife
[58:07] and
[58:08] we don't testify
[58:10] we don't give our testimony we don't
[58:11] tell anybody anybody about it especially
[58:14] you brothers and sisters that we love
[58:16] that you
[58:17] believe
[58:19] what is happening
[58:20] i have told the world about you know
[58:21] other things that have happened they say
[58:23] it's a coincidence that's not a
[58:24] coincidence
[58:25] it's never a coincidence and uh
[58:28] um
[58:29] so then i realized you know uh there's
[58:31] that white dog
[58:33] that that dog didn't have to say
[58:35] anything he didn't have to bark nothing
[58:37] i just knew he was there and i knew in
[58:39] my heart
[58:40] i knew in my heart that that was that
[58:42] was my father using my brothers
[58:44] my brothers all my brothers and our
[58:46] sisters
[58:47] with your love that's his hand and and i
[58:51] asked him again for forgiveness for not
[58:52] testifying or giving my testimony about
[58:55] us
[58:56] upon my wife uh
[58:58] not you know having to ask our neighbors
[59:00] for food
[59:01] wouldn't have a home
[59:03] um you know we another testimony where
[59:06] we i lost everything and there they
[59:07] rebuild my car and that at that moment
[59:10] uh
[59:11] if i was still a worldly man this was
[59:13] after i got baptized
[59:14] i went into the room and i started
[59:16] praying because they took my car
[59:18] i i would have never done that i don't
[59:19] know now i know what it was
[59:22] now i know what it was uh when when i
[59:23] didn't have a job um and i had a few
[59:26] dollars it's probably less than 20
[59:28] that's all i know there was no 20s in
[59:30] there
[59:31] you know on the way to church i was
[59:32] praying and i said god what do i do i
[59:34] don't have a job but i have money here
[59:35] my kids are okay
[59:37] and uh
[59:38] and i just threw you know i threw in the
[59:40] tithing and
[59:41] and then uh after after service
[59:45] my brother huell again and and i called
[59:47] him and i asked him about that uh the
[59:49] verse that he said he said i don't know
[59:50] i just felt in my heart to send it to
[59:52] you that other time he he comes up to me
[59:55] gives me an employee says hey go buy
[59:56] yourself from a chicken or something
[59:57] like that and i said okay okay brother
[59:59] so i got it and when i went into the car
[1:00:02] i opened it up and and and it's a 100
[1:00:05] bill
[1:00:06] and
[1:00:07] and i didn't have a job but in that
[1:00:08] moment i just felt someone just on my
[1:00:10] shoulder
[1:00:11] and i broke down but you know there's so
[1:00:14] many times in my life that he's done
[1:00:15] something you know
[1:00:17] the biggest one was my five-year-old
[1:00:19] when she was two weeks old
[1:00:21] you know i to just kind of cut it short
[1:00:24] we were in the emergency room
[1:00:26] and there was nurses and you know all
[1:00:28] over the place they were drawing blood
[1:00:30] from her spine and all kind you know
[1:00:32] fluids i don't know what they were doing
[1:00:34] but me and my wife i held their hand and
[1:00:36] we prayed
[1:00:38] they couldn't figure out what's wrong
[1:00:39] with it because there was nothing wrong
[1:00:40] with it but that that's our father
[1:00:43] and and uh and he's done so much for me
[1:00:45] and and i just
[1:00:47] i wanted to tell you because uh
[1:00:50] i can't i can't uh
[1:00:52] i can't just keep quiet anymore and i
[1:00:53] know you brothers and sisters
[1:00:55] um
[1:00:56] well
[1:00:57] we'll believe it
[1:00:58] it's not a coincidence and uh
[1:01:01] and uh even coming here um when when i
[1:01:04] was speaking to the insurance they said
[1:01:05] look we could schedule sunday ten to one
[1:01:07] i said just do it because i didn't know
[1:01:09] what i was thinking
[1:01:10] i said just do it and then when i
[1:01:12] realized oh that's service we're going
[1:01:14] to be back we're going to dedicate my
[1:01:16] babies uh
[1:01:18] um
[1:01:19] i didn't know what to do so i called him
[1:01:20] and i said i need to reschedule sir if
[1:01:22] you reschedule you're not going to see

[1:12:21] god bless you so much
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:34] amen do you love the lord this morning
[1:12:38] we certainly
[1:12:41] have been through a
[1:12:43] time of hardship i guess you noticed in
[1:12:46] the back we had a little flood
[1:12:48] here at the church and i certainly like
[1:12:50] to thank all the brothers that
[1:12:52] came over and responded right away and
[1:12:55] and uh was able to take
[1:12:58] um
[1:13:00] and get it prepared and we should try to
[1:13:02] have it fixed
[1:13:04] this week i know many people were
[1:13:06] without power
[1:13:07] but we still had a power
[1:13:09] within us that never runs out
[1:13:12] amen and it keeps us keeps us warm
[1:13:16] on the inside
[1:13:18] amen amen so we're we're certainly here
[1:13:21] this morning thank you musicians and
[1:13:24] and uh as we uh
[1:13:27] go into god's word this morning
[1:13:30] uh i
[1:13:33] i want to see how i can maybe express to
[1:13:36] you
[1:13:37] how that we'd like to approach this
[1:13:39] morning's service
[1:13:41] it's it's like a sunday school lesson
[1:13:45] and we're going to play a portion of a
[1:13:48] message today called the shame
[1:13:52] but as we looked at this
[1:13:54] in our heart as i begin to
[1:13:57] read it and it begin to deal with me
[1:14:01] i realized that
[1:14:05] you know god sent a message
[1:14:07] and this message was to
[1:14:10] an elected believer
[1:14:13] that had
[1:14:15] the ability
[1:14:17] within their heart
[1:14:20] to
[1:14:21] to use the expression
[1:14:23] read between the lines
[1:14:25] so somebody else could read the message
[1:14:28] and and read it as a sermon
[1:14:31] or look at
[1:14:33] what it said
[1:14:35] but to the elected
[1:14:37] it's written like a love letter
[1:14:40] and it it reaches down and
[1:14:43] touches you differently
[1:14:45] than it would so it has the form of a
[1:14:50] letter
[1:14:51] that anybody could read
[1:14:53] but there's a spirit
[1:14:56] within it
[1:14:58] the the spirit of it and that's what
[1:15:00] gives the life of it
[1:15:03] so it goes beyond being a
[1:15:06] abstract or a
[1:15:09] a a a
[1:15:11] a letter written in a book
[1:15:14] it really is a personal communication
[1:15:18] that the lord is making with you
[1:15:21] as he brings it to life
[1:15:24] to you
[1:15:26] in the form of revelation
[1:15:29] so as i begin to listen to this i begin
[1:15:32] to see
[1:15:35] in my heart
[1:15:37] and of course it brought me under a lot
[1:15:39] of conviction and i could spend the rest
[1:15:41] of the service repenting
[1:15:44] but
[1:15:45] that the lord is
[1:15:48] looking
[1:15:49] to see something in his children
[1:15:53] and
[1:15:55] he
[1:15:56] and and it's it's it's a characteristic
[1:16:01] that is in them
[1:16:03] that his children that they'll possess
[1:16:07] it's almost a way that he knows that
[1:16:11] that you're my children
[1:16:13] and we so many times look at things and
[1:16:16] say we know we're god's children because
[1:16:19] of what we believe
[1:16:21] but the lord looks at it maybe back a
[1:16:24] little bit
[1:16:25] different
[1:16:26] and he he wants to see something else in
[1:16:29] us
[1:16:30] and i thought that this morning that if
[1:16:33] this is true that you would want to know
[1:16:37] what the lord would want to see in you
[1:16:40] what what he's looking for what what
[1:16:43] what what does he want to
[1:16:47] see in you what characteristic what
[1:16:50] nature something about you
[1:16:53] that identifies you
[1:16:56] with him
[1:16:58] and and
[1:17:00] so sometimes you you you see that that
[1:17:03] he would see this in his children
[1:17:06] and so this message really to me
[1:17:09] was
[1:17:10] such a a
[1:17:11] a blessing because i began to see it
[1:17:15] that he's talking about and he as
[1:17:17] brother branham always does
[1:17:19] he uses moses he uses the different
[1:17:22] people through the bible but they are
[1:17:25] children of god
[1:17:27] each of you have a story
[1:17:30] we just heard a wonderful testimony
[1:17:34] and so each of us has a story each of us
[1:17:36] has a way that god moved in us god these
[1:17:40] were markers in time that we could look
[1:17:43] back and see that in sun-dried times and
[1:17:46] diverse manners that god used and spoke
[1:17:49] through these great men and left them as
[1:17:51] examples of christ
[1:17:54] but as he gives those examples of those
[1:17:57] men and we can't go into it all today
[1:18:00] but all those men had this certain
[1:18:04] characteristic
[1:18:05] that they possessed
[1:18:08] and and and so it's a challenge to us to
[1:18:12] look at ourselves and say do i possess
[1:18:16] this same
[1:18:18] characteristic this identifying
[1:18:21] mark of somebody that
[1:18:25] has really given their life to the lord
[1:18:29] and so it's a it's as we listen we're
[1:18:32] going to listen to this look i want you
[1:18:34] to see there's a great line of divide
[1:18:38] between
[1:18:39] the
[1:18:40] the worldly acceptance of something and
[1:18:44] what god is trying to accomplish
[1:18:47] and and as you'll hear him speak is very
[1:18:50] popular
[1:18:52] to say that i'm a christian
[1:18:54] but this goes to another level and and i
[1:18:58] i'd like to play it to you or for you
[1:19:02] excuse the word to you because
[1:19:04] you you love it
[1:19:07] uh for you
[1:19:08] and trusting that
[1:19:10] you would listen to those little things
[1:19:13] that and and what he's trying to say
[1:19:16] about the separation
[1:19:19] of the
[1:19:20] characteristic of his children
[1:19:24] and so if you have your bibles
[1:19:28] we could stand together
[1:19:31] and turn
[1:19:33] in the gospel of
[1:19:37] saint mark
[1:19:39] and the eighth chapter
[1:19:41] of saint mark
[1:19:43] and
[1:19:45] let's begin about the 34th verse
[1:19:48] to the 38th verse
[1:19:51] and
[1:19:52] and
[1:19:55] just you know just take the i don't know
[1:19:57] how long it is but
[1:20:00] i don't think it should be over 20
[1:20:01] minutes or so
[1:20:03] but really listen up
[1:20:05] to it for a few minutes
[1:20:07] and take it
[1:20:09] to yourself
[1:20:11] and and say so if you could look at this
[1:20:13] as brother braham's preaching just think
[1:20:16] god's got his binoculars on you
[1:20:19] and he's wanting to see
[1:20:23] if
[1:20:24] you
[1:20:25] possess
[1:20:27] this great character so father we ask
[1:20:30] you to bless your word this morning
[1:20:33] lord i was humbled the other day by the
[1:20:36] love of the brethren and the beautiful
[1:20:40] men's breakfast that we had
[1:20:43] lord you know my hearts
[1:20:47] just so desirous
[1:20:49] of the people
[1:20:51] that they can just achieve the greatness
[1:20:55] in their lives
[1:20:57] that you have for them
[1:20:59] and father i played this
[1:21:03] message that was in the storehouse
[1:21:06] and i believe it's in season for this
[1:21:09] hour that we live in
[1:21:11] that your spirit's bringing it out to us
[1:21:13] as food this morning
[1:21:15] father are visitors that might not
[1:21:17] understand
[1:21:19] exactly
[1:21:20] where that work coming from
[1:21:22] or someone that's new in our midst and
[1:21:26] yeah
[1:21:27] i i pray father that if there's
[1:21:29] questions on their heart that you'll
[1:21:32] just deal with them
[1:21:34] that you'll put such a hunger in their
[1:21:36] heart to serve you
[1:21:38] and may they come to know that you love
[1:21:40] them father and you want to keep them
[1:21:43] and you want to bring them home with you
[1:21:46] father may we take your instructions
[1:21:48] this morning from your holy spirit we
[1:21:50] ask you to bless us now in jesus name we
[1:21:53] pray
[1:21:54] amen amen after he's done
[1:21:58] reading
[1:21:59] of the scripture and he says i want to
[1:22:01] take a little text from there
[1:22:04] to just be seated at that time god bless
[1:22:06] you
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:13] let's turn in the bible the mark day
[1:22:15] chapter
[1:22:20] now
[1:22:21] just a little short message here i speak
[1:22:23] to you about the word that you're
[1:22:24] testifying about over there and so forth
[1:22:27] mark the eighth chapter
[1:22:29] and let's begin about the 34th verse to
[1:22:32] the
[1:22:33] 30th think in the 30th rest of that
[1:22:34] chapter
[1:22:37] i like to read what he said
[1:22:40] because i know that's true
[1:22:43] now
[1:22:44] and when he had called the people and to
[1:22:46] him with his disciples also he said unto
[1:22:49] them
[1:22:51] will come after me let him deny himself
[1:22:54] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:22:58] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:23:00] lose it whosoever shall lose his life
[1:23:03] for
[1:23:03] my sake and the gospels the same shall
[1:23:07] save it
[1:23:09] for what shall it profit a man if he
[1:23:11] gains the whole world and lose his own
[1:23:13] soul
[1:23:15] or
[1:23:16] what shall a man give in exchange for
[1:23:19] his soul
[1:23:21] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[1:23:24] me and of my words in this adulterous
[1:23:28] and sinful generation
[1:23:30] of him also shall the son of man be
[1:23:32] ashamed when he cometh in the glory of
[1:23:35] his father with the holy angel
[1:23:39] i want to take a little text from there
[1:23:41] to be called that
[1:23:43] call
[1:23:44] ashamed
[1:23:46] you know
[1:23:48] i like that
[1:23:50] whosoever is ashamed of me and of my
[1:23:54] words
[1:23:56] i'll be ashamed of him
[1:23:58] now
[1:23:59] the word
[1:24:01] ashamed could be also translated
[1:24:04] embarrassed
[1:24:06] you know something that you're
[1:24:08] uh you're faced with something that
[1:24:10] you're embarrassed about being ashamed
[1:24:14] that another thing being ashamed does
[1:24:17] show us that you are
[1:24:19] not sure of what you're talking about
[1:24:22] if you know what you're talking about
[1:24:24] and have the assurance that you know
[1:24:26] what you're talking about you can tell
[1:24:27] anybody that
[1:24:29] you're not ashamed
[1:24:31] but if you feel put out out of place
[1:24:36] it shows you're not sure
[1:24:38] you notice there's so much of that today
[1:24:40] especially
[1:24:42] on the subject that i'm speaking of
[1:24:44] ashamed of the word
[1:24:48] now he and the word are the same
[1:24:50] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:24:52] is with god and the word was god and the
[1:24:54] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:24:55] the same yesterday today and forever so
[1:24:58] whosoever is ashamed of me and my word
[1:25:01] and he and his word are one so being
[1:25:03] ashamed
[1:25:04] of his word
[1:25:06] in this sinful present generation
[1:25:09] i'll be ashamed of him
[1:25:13] now
[1:25:14] we notice today
[1:25:16] if somebody says uh uh are you a
[1:25:18] christian it's very much a popular thing
[1:25:20] say oh i'm a christian
[1:25:23] but do you believe the word of god lord
[1:25:26] said these signs shall follow them
[1:25:27] believe it all
[1:25:29] even minister space is a blush
[1:25:33] are you ashamed of
[1:25:35] saying of divine healing
[1:25:37] are you ashamed of the full gospel
[1:25:40] are you ashamed of your pentecostal
[1:25:43] experience
[1:25:45] that's being ashamed of his word
[1:25:47] that's his word
[1:25:48] made flesh in you
[1:25:51] so his word has to live itself out for
[1:25:54] every generation
[1:25:56] it lived and set off in the days of
[1:25:58] moses
[1:26:00] because
[1:26:01] in that day the bible said in hebrews
[1:26:03] first chapter god in sunlight times and
[1:26:05] divers matters spake to the fathers by
[1:26:09] the prophets
[1:26:11] and those prophets
[1:26:13] the church got all so twisted up
[1:26:15] that when those prophets those daring
[1:26:18] messengers of god come without church
[1:26:20] without denomination without an
[1:26:22] organization without anything the five
[1:26:24] kings kingdoms churches and everything
[1:26:27] when the priest was brought before they
[1:26:30] was brought before the priest
[1:26:32] they wasn't ashamed
[1:26:34] because they had directly thus saved the
[1:26:38] law amen
[1:26:40] if you notice
[1:26:41] the prophet in one sense the word in the
[1:26:43] old testament
[1:26:45] when he said thus saith the lord now
[1:26:47] watch him he goes right into the phrase
[1:26:49] of taking the place of god amen
[1:26:52] you notice when he placed out before him
[1:26:55] thus saith the lord he fell right into
[1:26:58] god
[1:27:00] and he acted as god amen then he gave
[1:27:02] his message which was god speaking
[1:27:05] through him
[1:27:07] thus saith the lord
[1:27:09] i think
[1:27:11] of the prophets of old when they come
[1:27:13] with that message
[1:27:16] man
[1:27:17] it embarrassed the kings
[1:27:19] and it made the people feel
[1:27:21] uncomfortable the priest even
[1:27:24] they would feel uncomfortable because
[1:27:27] they were supposed to be leaders
[1:27:30] religious
[1:27:31] man
[1:27:32] and one day
[1:27:34] the
[1:27:34] word came forth in that manner
[1:27:38] it exposed them
[1:27:40] and they felt embarrassed or ashamed
[1:27:45] and many times we see that not me too
[1:27:48] often today
[1:27:49] that man you say i am a christian
[1:27:52] have you received the holy ghost that
[1:27:53] you believed
[1:27:55] oh
[1:27:56] you see they're embarrassed about it
[1:27:58] somebody said you belong to that group
[1:28:01] up there that does all that that are
[1:28:02] shouting and all that divine healing
[1:28:04] stuff many times christians back up
[1:28:08] they want to announce if they got a
[1:28:09] denomination i'm baptist i'm
[1:28:11] presbyterian luther
[1:28:13] they're not ashamed of that but when it
[1:28:15] comes to being
[1:28:16] a christian
[1:28:18] that can take god's word
[1:28:20] just the way it is then they're they're
[1:28:23] shamed i don't belong to any
[1:28:24] denomination
[1:28:27] they're ashamed to say that they've got
[1:28:29] to be like the rest of the world
[1:28:30] represented by some organization now
[1:28:33] that's just recently come into that in
[1:28:35] the days of luther
[1:28:37] to recognize yourself as a lutheran a
[1:28:39] follower of luther well
[1:28:41] it almost meant death by the catholic
[1:28:43] church
[1:28:44] in the days of wesley to know that you
[1:28:46] had defied
[1:28:48] the anglian church
[1:28:49] it was almost a penalty of death for the
[1:28:51] anglins
[1:28:52] to
[1:28:53] announce that you were a methodist and
[1:28:56] the days of pentecost
[1:28:58] it was a shame almost to say that she
[1:29:01] was uh that she was a pentecostal
[1:29:03] because she was quickly counted a holy
[1:29:05] aurora or some tongue speaker or
[1:29:07] something like that now they organized
[1:29:10] went riding with the rest of the group
[1:29:11] now when a calling out time comes
[1:29:14] that you don't belong to any of it
[1:29:17] very popular sound pentecost very proper
[1:29:19] sample presbyterian lutheran but what
[1:29:21] kind of times is the time that you have
[1:29:23] to come out and stand for the word
[1:29:25] i don't belong to any other thing
[1:29:27] that that uh
[1:29:29] embarrassed jesus said now if you're
[1:29:31] ashamed of me
[1:29:34] then i'll be ashamed of you
[1:29:36] why would he be ashamed of you because
[1:29:38] you're claiming to be his when you won't
[1:29:41] follow him
[1:29:43] what if i said uh uh this little glory
[1:29:46] is he's my son he tries to who may be
[1:29:48] your soul what do you think i am it
[1:29:51] would embarrass me what is your son
[1:29:53] and that's the way that so-called
[1:29:55] christianity there's your name in the
[1:29:57] name of the denomination all night
[1:29:59] they accept the fatherhood of a
[1:30:01] denomination but when it comes to
[1:30:02] accepting the fatherhood of the word of
[1:30:05] god christ know when they embarrass they
[1:30:08] don't want to say yes i have spoken
[1:30:10] tongues yes i have seen visions yes i
[1:30:12] believe in divine healing yes i praise
[1:30:14] the lord i'm free from all organization
[1:30:17] i'm not bound out of any of that
[1:30:19] i'm a servant of christ
[1:30:21] oh my that just turned to pieces
[1:30:24] the other night
[1:30:26] a great speaker
[1:30:28] coming amongst the full gospel
[1:30:29] businessman chicago
[1:30:33] may i stop here just a minute to say
[1:30:34] this you excuse me
[1:30:36] but many times you think and i do too
[1:30:39] that what we're talking about
[1:30:42] the truth of the bible don't fall over
[1:30:44] amongst the people but if they are
[1:30:46] sometimes against it but they really
[1:30:48] don't mean it
[1:30:50] they're trying to find where you're
[1:30:51] standing
[1:30:54] as the story was about
[1:30:56] a bunch of drunks
[1:30:58] arguing that there was no such thing as
[1:31:00] christianity one man said i don't know
[1:31:02] where there's one at that's my wife
[1:31:05] well i don't believe it said come over
[1:31:07] let's all act like we're really drunk
[1:31:09] went up there at the house and done
[1:31:10] everything they could and she told him
[1:31:12] cooking some eggs and then he thought
[1:31:14] about all fours and you know better to
[1:31:16] cook my eggs like that carrying on the
[1:31:18] house they went over the other room fell
[1:31:20] down a chair they heard somebody out
[1:31:22] there sweeping it up not saying the word
[1:31:24] saying saying a little song to yourself
[1:31:26] must jesus bear the cross alone in all
[1:31:28] over the world go free
[1:31:30] there's a cross for everyone and there's
[1:31:32] a cross for me in this consecrated cross
[1:31:34] out there tell death shall set me free
[1:31:37] and then go home a crown of where
[1:31:39] there were all drugs that want to tell
[1:31:40] you that she's a christian see
[1:31:50] so
[1:31:51] i never thought this would happen
[1:31:54] but last saturday night i believe it was
[1:31:56] or sunday at night the great speaker i
[1:31:59] don't
[1:31:59] subject calling people's names but
[1:32:02] he's trying working exactly contrary i'm
[1:32:06] trying to keep that churches out of that
[1:32:08] ecumenical move
[1:32:09] and this man is trying to put him in
[1:32:11] there
[1:32:12] so he's speaking for the christian
[1:32:14] businessman which i suppose to have had
[1:32:16] the meeting in chicago and i thought
[1:32:17] it'd be in africa at that time so i
[1:32:19] couldn't take it this man said god
[1:32:22] finished that the greatest move the
[1:32:23] greatest thing than the earth now it's
[1:32:25] ever been all the churches are returning
[1:32:27] back to the catholic church to the ekka
[1:32:29] megaloo and the catholics will receive
[1:32:31] the holy ghost or the trap of the devil
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:36] and this
[1:32:37] leader brother shakarian
[1:32:41] uh the president of the international
[1:32:44] businessman stood up and said after the
[1:32:46] man sit down says that's not the way we
[1:32:48] heard it
[1:32:50] the brother graham has told us that this
[1:32:51] economical move will move them all to
[1:32:53] the mark of the beast
[1:32:55] and the man sitting on the platform
[1:32:58] that he'll move it to the mark of the
[1:32:59] beast and said we're declined to believe
[1:33:02] what he says is the truth amen
[1:33:05] he said how many of you would like to
[1:33:06] hear brother brown come and give you the
[1:33:08] true cider that raised his 5 000 people
[1:33:10] they screamed and cried
[1:33:12] just come for one day
[1:33:14] one day
[1:33:16] brother carl williams called me upset
[1:33:17] brother ben for our way out through that
[1:33:19] crowd so they had piles of hundred
[1:33:20] dollar bills laying my hands to get your
[1:33:21] airplane ticket up here and back
[1:33:24] just for one day see those people that
[1:33:26] word is sinking in where sometimes we
[1:33:29] don't know it
[1:33:30] see but see when you're really no matter
[1:33:33] how much
[1:33:35] the world is against it how much the
[1:33:37] denominations are against it god's
[1:33:39] proven it to be the truth
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:43] the great hour finally strikes
[1:33:46] things like maybe we didn't think about
[1:33:49] yes it shows you're not sure if you're
[1:33:51] embarrassed
[1:33:53] so you would rather
[1:33:55] not discuss the subject if you're going
[1:33:57] to be ashamed of it you wouldn't want to
[1:33:59] discuss it hold back
[1:34:01] but how can a man who's still
[1:34:08] talk to a man a few minutes to not
[1:34:10] mention something about that love that's
[1:34:12] in his heart
[1:34:14] there's something that it happens you
[1:34:16] can't do it
[1:34:17] this is a must be that evil day that
[1:34:19] jesus was speaking of people are ashamed
[1:34:22] of the word and how the spirit of god
[1:34:24] that acts within them
[1:34:27] but when the truth is made plain
[1:34:29] to the people god then himself revealing
[1:34:32] himself through the word
[1:34:35] now any man can make any kind of claims
[1:34:37] and we've had it in these days where
[1:34:39] there's been so many claims claimed that
[1:34:41] it's been horrible
[1:34:43] but you see if there is a truth it must
[1:34:47] be by the water
[1:34:49] because they send me they had all kinds
[1:34:51] of things of all pouring through people
[1:34:53] and blood out of their hands and women
[1:34:55] on their backs was blood and running
[1:34:57] down their shoes and raised up their
[1:34:59] shoes and pour all out and frogs jumping
[1:35:01] out and hopping down the platform and
[1:35:03] all kinds of things like that there's no
[1:35:05] such stuff is that in the bible there's
[1:35:06] no promise of anything like that in the
[1:35:08] bible
[1:35:11] only said the last days the spirit would
[1:35:12] be so close to deceive the elected if
[1:35:14] possible
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:16] but there's no scripture for that
[1:35:19] but when it comes to genuine and
[1:35:21] unadulterated word of god confirmed by
[1:35:24] god
[1:35:25] it seems to even embarrass the other
[1:35:27] group
[1:35:28] on the radical side
[1:35:31] there's an embarrassment about it but
[1:35:33] it's a reality to a man or a woman boy
[1:35:36] or girl who really is a genuine
[1:35:38] christian
[1:35:39] when god made the promise of the baptism
[1:35:41] of the holy ghost and you receive it
[1:35:45] there's something that settles within
[1:35:47] you
[1:35:48] that there's nothing takes his place
[1:35:52] when a man ever meets god
[1:35:54] not in some emotional workout
[1:35:56] some enthusiasm or some religious
[1:35:58] doctrine some catechism or creed or a
[1:36:01] dhamma that either is accepted for a
[1:36:04] comfort for himself but when he really
[1:36:07] comes to the place like moses did on the
[1:36:10] back side of the desert walk up face to
[1:36:12] face with almighty god
[1:36:15] and you see the voice speaking to you
[1:36:16] exactly with the word and the promise of
[1:36:19] the hour
[1:36:20] there's something it does to you you're
[1:36:24] not ashamed of it it does something to
[1:36:27] you
[1:36:28] now
[1:36:30] let us look now for just the next 15
[1:36:33] minutes
[1:36:34] there's some people
[1:36:35] that receive such an experience
[1:36:38] but as i speak to you today
[1:36:40] not as a church or as a denomination i
[1:36:43] speak to you as an individual amen not
[1:36:46] because you come here to this tabernacle
[1:36:48] because that i love you and you love me
[1:36:52] not because of that let me speak to you
[1:36:54] as a dying mom
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:36:58] that someday you've got to come to the
[1:37:01] end of this life amen
[1:37:04] i may not be there
[1:37:07] and another preacher might not be there
[1:37:10] but there's only one who can meet you
[1:37:12] there that's god
[1:37:15] and you you listen to it and not well my
[1:37:18] wife is a good christian or my husband's
[1:37:20] a good christian
[1:37:22] but am i right with god having
[1:37:25] god like that amen
[1:37:27] not because my pastor met god of course
[1:37:29] my deacon met god forever
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] not because i shouted not because i
[1:37:35] spoke in tongues but because i met him
[1:37:38] as a person amen
[1:37:42] then you'll never be ashamed of that
[1:37:46] there's something that's so perfect and
[1:37:48] pure and true
[1:37:57] i played that just because if i could
[1:37:59] say
[1:38:00] to
[1:38:01] lay a little
[1:38:02] uh
[1:38:03] foundation here
[1:38:06] for us this morning
[1:38:08] and he's talking about
[1:38:11] being ashamed
[1:38:13] or or being embarrassed
[1:38:16] and
[1:38:18] he
[1:38:19] as he speaks that he's saying that's so
[1:38:22] common today
[1:38:24] and that's when i begin to see that he's
[1:38:27] looking
[1:38:28] and he begins to talk so i cut it there
[1:38:30] because i hope that you get encouraged i
[1:38:33] know the quality of the tape isn't good
[1:38:35] but even if you take the book and read
[1:38:38] it
[1:38:39] because that something that he's looking
[1:38:42] for
[1:38:43] in a real
[1:38:44] genuine
[1:38:46] christian
[1:38:48] is are they ashamed of me
[1:38:51] or embarrassed of me
[1:38:55] and he said
[1:38:56] and i thought that was good
[1:38:59] he said well how could he be embarrassed
[1:39:01] of me that's a question that i never
[1:39:04] really felt
[1:39:05] of asking
[1:39:07] you know he said if he you know if
[1:39:09] you're ashamed of me before men i'll be
[1:39:11] ashamed of you
[1:39:13] before my father
[1:39:15] and and so when you let that settle in a
[1:39:18] moment and you say what would i do or
[1:39:21] or
[1:39:22] what could i say what what would make
[1:39:25] him embarrassed of me
[1:39:28] or what would make him ashamed and
[1:39:32] embarrassed to identify with me
[1:39:36] so just like we claim that he's our
[1:39:38] father
[1:39:39] we would be
[1:39:41] just as embarrassed for
[1:39:44] if my if your son or your child
[1:39:47] did something
[1:39:49] and it was against what you stood for or
[1:39:51] they hurt somebody or or they got in
[1:39:54] trouble
[1:39:55] that would embarrass you you'd be
[1:39:57] ashamed of that
[1:39:59] because that's not what you taught them
[1:40:02] that's what that's not what you wanted
[1:40:04] them to stand for so the question is is
[1:40:07] if he's going to say i'll be ashamed of
[1:40:09] you before the father then i want to
[1:40:11] know what is it
[1:40:14] or what what would it be about me
[1:40:18] that would make him embarrassed
[1:40:21] of me
[1:40:24] and and i don't
[1:40:27] but that's the worst thing
[1:40:30] because
[1:40:31] we have to meet him
[1:40:33] on an individual basis nobody else can
[1:40:36] be there for us
[1:40:38] if it's him
[1:40:40] at the end we can't be
[1:40:42] we can't be ashamed he says
[1:40:47] and he says
[1:40:49] here he says and
[1:40:50] what then it comes to the time that you
[1:40:54] have to come and stand for the word i
[1:40:57] don't belong to any of it that's
[1:40:59] embarrassing
[1:41:00] now
[1:41:01] jesus said now if you are embarrassed of
[1:41:03] me
[1:41:04] then i'll
[1:41:06] be
[1:41:07] i'll be if you're
[1:41:09] ashamed of
[1:41:11] he said if you are ashamed of me then
[1:41:13] i'll be ashamed of you
[1:41:15] why would he be ashamed of you because
[1:41:18] you are claiming to be his when you
[1:41:22] won't follow him
[1:41:24] now if there's anybody that makes that
[1:41:27] claim
[1:41:28] it's us
[1:41:33] we have the true word we follow him
[1:41:36] after we're the elect we're the lady
[1:41:38] we're the one that's got the truth
[1:41:40] and so
[1:41:42] we we make the claim
[1:41:45] but then he says
[1:41:47] but you make the claim
[1:41:50] but you don't follow it
[1:41:53] and that really gives us to say because
[1:41:56] so many times we become so predestinated
[1:41:59] that we don't feel we have any
[1:42:01] requirements
[1:42:06] now
[1:42:08] so
[1:42:08] if you you he said that you're ashamed
[1:42:12] because you're not sure
[1:42:16] or you don't have an answer
[1:42:18] because you you shrink back
[1:42:22] now so he's looking for a characteristic
[1:42:26] he's looking for something in his
[1:42:28] children
[1:42:29] that he can say they're not ashamed of
[1:42:32] me
[1:42:34] they're not embarrassed
[1:42:37] of what that i'm doing
[1:42:41] so god's doing something
[1:42:44] in every age he's doing something he's
[1:42:47] got something that he wants to
[1:42:48] accomplish something that he's trying to
[1:42:52] come to
[1:42:54] and to
[1:42:55] to achieve
[1:42:58] now
[1:43:00] are we embarrassed
[1:43:02] of the way that he's doing it
[1:43:05] or the way that he chooses to do it are
[1:43:09] we ashamed of him
[1:43:12] of his word and and and i like that i
[1:43:16] thought it was such a
[1:43:18] a fantastic statement
[1:43:21] if i i could read it too he says are you
[1:43:23] ashamed
[1:43:24] of divine healing
[1:43:27] are you ashamed of the full gospel all
[1:43:30] of the gospel
[1:43:32] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7
[1:43:37] the calling out of a bride
[1:43:41] are we are we ashamed of what god's
[1:43:44] doing are we are embarrassed about it
[1:43:47] are we a little shrunk back do we feel
[1:43:50] that god could have really done it a
[1:43:52] different way than he done it he could
[1:43:54] have been a little kinder he could have
[1:43:56] been a little more gentle he couldn't
[1:43:58] have it have been so fanatical it
[1:44:01] couldn't have been so far off and so
[1:44:03] separated from everybody else oh lord
[1:44:09] you could have made it a little easier
[1:44:14] on us
[1:44:17] you could have given us something a
[1:44:18] little uh less
[1:44:21] fanatical in the eyes of the world
[1:44:24] to stand for
[1:44:28] see that's what he's looking for
[1:44:32] i'm going to read a quote to you in a
[1:44:33] minute that i think will really seal it
[1:44:35] up for you
[1:44:38] let's go
[1:44:39] so he's looking at
[1:44:41] his children and he's saying are they
[1:44:44] ashamed of me
[1:44:50] i didn't make up god's sin and a
[1:44:51] messenger
[1:44:54] i didn't make up that god would use
[1:44:56] william mary and branham to fulfill the
[1:44:59] biblical prophecy of malachi 4 and 5.
[1:45:03] i i didn't decide that the ministry of
[1:45:06] the son of man in this day
[1:45:08] would come to pass by god coming down
[1:45:11] and veiling himself
[1:45:13] in a
[1:45:15] messenger angel to the seventh age
[1:45:18] i didn't decide that god was going to
[1:45:20] send a seventh church age message that
[1:45:23] he was going to come to the world
[1:45:26] and and call out the sick and discern
[1:45:29] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:45:31] and preach the gospel condemn the
[1:45:33] trinity condemn denominations condemn
[1:45:36] organizations
[1:45:37] i didn't do that but that's he chose
[1:45:40] that
[1:45:42] he wanted to accomplish something
[1:45:46] now that's what he's saying
[1:45:49] are they ashamed
[1:45:52] are they are are they ashamed of the
[1:45:54] full gospel are you ashamed of your
[1:45:57] pentecostal experience and i don't mean
[1:46:00] to experience that of a denominational
[1:46:03] or a religious organization pentecost
[1:46:07] i'm talking about a pentecostal
[1:46:09] experience that you've met the pillar of
[1:46:11] fire
[1:46:15] you know god
[1:46:17] you've watched your nature change
[1:46:20] you know now that the temptation is in
[1:46:23] your flesh but your heart and your mind
[1:46:26] are pure towards god
[1:46:29] you can divide the flesh from the spirit
[1:46:34] you're not ashamed that that you've
[1:46:36] meant god
[1:46:38] and that that experience has had an
[1:46:41] effect on you
[1:46:44] i i i i just thought brother adrian's
[1:46:47] testimony was so perfect with this
[1:46:50] morning's message oh this is the chance
[1:46:52] you can make a lot of money
[1:46:55] let's go rip off the insurance companies
[1:47:03] no
[1:47:04] i'm a christian
[1:47:06] i don't do that
[1:47:09] i also love what he said the farther you
[1:47:11] get away from god you know people think
[1:47:13] they're going to go somewhere and get
[1:47:15] away from it all you are getting away
[1:47:17] from it all you're getting away from the
[1:47:19] body you're getting away from the
[1:47:20] fellowship you're getting away from the
[1:47:22] word you're getting away from your duty
[1:47:24] to be your part in a body and and fix
[1:47:28] one another
[1:47:29] you get a farther away
[1:47:31] oh praise god for the word that come out
[1:47:34] of our brother the louder the other dog
[1:47:37] barks
[1:47:40] and he begins to change your thinking
[1:47:44] you begin to reason
[1:47:46] because there's no text there
[1:47:49] nobody comes up and just speaks a word
[1:47:51] to you they don't even know it
[1:47:54] somebody gets up and sings a special and
[1:47:57] it just it just tears your heart out let
[1:47:59] me tell you something
[1:48:01] i might as well say it
[1:48:03] streaming was never meant to replace
[1:48:06] church
[1:48:11] it's that elbow to elbow that makes a
[1:48:14] believer the prophet of god said it's
[1:48:16] two of those stones
[1:48:18] rubbing together that hone everybody
[1:48:24] you know sometimes streaming becomes
[1:48:26] like that a filter that the prophet of
[1:48:28] god spoke about it gives you a filter
[1:48:31] that gives you a certain taste
[1:48:34] so you can sit there and you can get the
[1:48:36] gospel in a certain taste just the way
[1:48:39] you want to feel it
[1:48:43] but it's tough when that person sitting
[1:48:45] next to you is pulling the holy spirit
[1:48:48] down and then and you're sitting next to
[1:48:50] him and they're getting anointing and
[1:48:53] you feel the presence of god in the
[1:48:55] building and you feel like every eye in
[1:48:57] the building is looking at you
[1:49:04] i walked out of church thinking that
[1:49:06] preacher was just preaching at me the
[1:49:08] whole time
[1:49:10] didn't get too you know just thought
[1:49:12] everybody knows it's me you know i'm
[1:49:14] just going to stand up and say i'm sorry
[1:49:16] it's me
[1:49:24] then you walk outside and you get on the
[1:49:26] step and someone's walking out of the
[1:49:27] church man that message is just for me
[1:49:30] somebody else said that message was just
[1:49:31] for me
[1:49:32] and then somebody comes up oh brother
[1:49:34] david i really enjoyed your sermon the
[1:49:36] other day when you talked about this and
[1:49:38] this
[1:49:40] i said that wasn't my sermon who are you
[1:49:42] listening to
[1:49:44] because the holy spirit
[1:49:47] sits between the lips of the speaker
[1:49:50] and the ear of the believer to turn that
[1:49:53] word into food for your personal needs
[1:49:59] but he said
[1:50:02] he says experience that's being ashamed
[1:50:04] of his word that's his word made
[1:50:08] flesh in you
[1:50:13] because word made flesh in you because
[1:50:15] it's that i'm looking at my children and
[1:50:18] i want to know are they ashamed
[1:50:21] of this message
[1:50:25] the word
[1:50:26] that sent being made flesh
[1:50:30] in them
[1:50:31] oh
[1:50:32] we like to keep it
[1:50:35] right here
[1:50:40] this is the message
[1:50:44] this is the letter
[1:50:46] and it killeth it
[1:50:48] but the spirit
[1:50:50] is what makes it flesh in you
[1:50:52] and are we are we ashamed of it becoming
[1:50:55] flesh in us are our sisters ashamed to
[1:50:58] take off their high heels
[1:51:01] are they ashamed to add a few more
[1:51:03] inches so their dress doesn't fit on
[1:51:05] them like a hot dog
[1:51:10] are we ashamed to take off our our
[1:51:13] earrings and our our gold apparel
[1:51:19] you know there's just that little part
[1:51:21] of us that we want to get as close to
[1:51:23] borderline as we can yeah i'm a
[1:51:25] christian but
[1:51:27] i'm over here
[1:51:30] see what i'm saying is that why this is
[1:51:33] so important
[1:51:35] because we're going to meet him
[1:51:40] now we understand when he said you did
[1:51:42] all these mighty works but i never knew
[1:51:46] you because you were embarrassed
[1:51:53] about what i did
[1:51:56] you were embarrassed to let that word be
[1:51:58] made flesh in you
[1:52:02] okay and so
[1:52:04] as we come down he says
[1:52:07] so his word has to live itself out
[1:52:10] for every generation
[1:52:15] it's got to live itself out
[1:52:18] so he has a word
[1:52:21] he sent us something
[1:52:23] but he's saying now are my children
[1:52:26] ashamed of what i'm doing
[1:52:30] are they ashamed of how i did it
[1:52:34] are
[1:52:35] are they ashamed to let
[1:52:37] what that i'm teaching them be made
[1:52:41] manifested
[1:52:43] in the flesh
[1:52:46] well when god told moses to circumcise
[1:52:49] his son
[1:52:51] his wife was all man he said you're a
[1:52:53] bloody man
[1:52:55] what's wrong with you
[1:52:56] it became a mark
[1:52:59] now they may turn it into a medical
[1:53:01] thing
[1:53:02] and i'm not preaching about that but i'm
[1:53:04] talking about
[1:53:06] god looking at us
[1:53:10] and it becomes now
[1:53:13] a requirement
[1:53:19] hear me of what i'm trying to say this
[1:53:21] morning
[1:53:23] god is requiring
[1:53:27] his children
[1:53:29] not to be ashamed of him
[1:53:35] it's not it's
[1:53:38] it's not a choice
[1:53:41] he's saying if you are mine
[1:53:46] then you will allow me to manifest my
[1:53:51] word in your flesh
[1:53:55] you will die to your word you will die
[1:53:57] to your ideas you will die to all those
[1:54:00] things you will absolutely become one
[1:54:04] with this word and you will not
[1:54:07] be
[1:54:08] ashamed of doing so
[1:54:14] and so he goes he
[1:54:17] he goes
[1:54:18] on to say this he says
[1:54:24] and we read this she says so
[1:54:26] in trying to drive to separate
[1:54:30] and give us a clear picture
[1:54:33] you understand so it's not to them it's
[1:54:35] a two-edged sword
[1:54:37] it cuts going both ways
[1:54:40] well i want it to cut me first
[1:54:43] before it cuts the unbeliever
[1:54:46] so many people sit back and they love
[1:54:48] the sword that cuts the unbeliever and
[1:54:50] cuts the system and it cuts the one
[1:54:53] that's not living right and cuts the bob
[1:54:56] tear and cuts this and the judy the
[1:54:58] world oh they like that side of the
[1:55:00] sword but they don't like the sight of
[1:55:02] the sword that cuts right here
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:09] and that's the side of the sword that we
[1:55:11] shouldn't be ashamed of
[1:55:13] that's the sight of the sword that when
[1:55:15] it cuts us and it exposes us and it lays
[1:55:18] us bare open to the world that we've got
[1:55:21] to go back and repent of something we
[1:55:23] were doing that we're not ashamed of
[1:55:25] that
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:27] amen
[1:55:31] people like to kind of remodel
[1:55:34] when god does something to them
[1:55:36] they'll work in it real slow
[1:55:41] you know because it's like god
[1:55:42] convicting you of wearing high heels so
[1:55:45] you're going to go from those
[1:55:47] uh
[1:55:48] what do they call
[1:55:50] stetsos or stilettos or whatever crazy
[1:55:54] you shouldn't even have them things in
[1:55:56] your closet
[1:55:57] throw them things out i've heard they're
[1:56:00] a murder weapon
[1:56:04] but you don't cut down from four inches
[1:56:06] to three inches and then three inches to
[1:56:09] two inches you know and
[1:56:11] and down to an inch and a half you know
[1:56:14] okay you don't ask me what high high is
[1:56:16] if you want to know what high highs pick
[1:56:18] one of these real christian sisters
[1:56:20] that's been around a while look at my
[1:56:22] wife look at them that god's dealt with
[1:56:25] and the holy spirit's convicted them and
[1:56:28] you see that holiness in their life look
[1:56:30] at the way they dress
[1:56:35] as the scripture says
[1:56:37] it says you older woman teach the
[1:56:38] younger women
[1:56:40] how do you think that's a class
[1:56:46] you think that's sunday school 202
[1:56:50] no that's their life
[1:56:52] they walk into church with their dresses
[1:56:54] below their knees
[1:56:56] you know not not so borderline that you
[1:56:59] know he said you shouldn't be able to
[1:57:01] see the knees standing or sitting
[1:57:05] every kitchen knew who we representing
[1:57:10] who we standing for
[1:57:12] joke you know and so you just kind of
[1:57:14] work it down there and so like nobody
[1:57:17] ever knew
[1:57:19] you know the real way to do it man
[1:57:20] praise god god spoke to me i ain't
[1:57:22] ashamed i threw them things in the trash
[1:57:27] hallelujah
[1:57:30] and so he says now when it comes to
[1:57:32] being a christian
[1:57:35] that they
[1:57:36] he says that's real popular
[1:57:39] it's real popular to say i'm a christian
[1:57:45] it's real popular talk about the bible
[1:57:48] it's real popular
[1:57:50] but when it comes to being a christian
[1:57:53] that takes god's word
[1:57:56] just the way it is
[1:57:59] then they're ashamed
[1:58:03] nobody wants to take god's word just the
[1:58:05] way it is
[1:58:06] everybody wants to add a little twist
[1:58:09] add a little what we mean this way i
[1:58:12] love it when you pin somebody down on
[1:58:14] the scripture
[1:58:16] the king james version that's the bible
[1:58:18] that i read from it's though i try to
[1:58:21] use the one that brother branham used
[1:58:22] but when you pin them down
[1:58:24] and they don't have any way to go oh the
[1:58:27] greek says
[1:58:32] you know
[1:58:34] sir galahad in the 17th century
[1:58:38] said that that word was asamosioso
[1:58:43] which means we don't really have to take
[1:58:45] it just the way it's written
[1:58:51] you understand what he's looking for
[1:58:53] what he's looking for in us the
[1:58:55] characteristic and that we're not
[1:58:57] ashamed to take it
[1:59:00] just the way
[1:59:02] it's written
[1:59:07] read it
[1:59:10] just what it says
[1:59:14] it's a shame
[1:59:16] for a woman to cut her hair
[1:59:18] be not ordained with gold apparel
[1:59:22] be modest shame-faced holy
[1:59:25] obedient oh because they don't want any
[1:59:28] of that
[1:59:32] you know but that's popular
[1:59:35] but that's not what he's looking for in
[1:59:38] his children
[1:59:40] he's looking for that real christian
[1:59:43] that can take it just the way and
[1:59:45] they're not ashamed
[1:59:46] i don't belong to any denomination see
[1:59:51] they're
[1:59:52] they're ashamed to say that
[1:59:55] they've got to be like the rest of the
[1:59:58] world
[1:59:59] represented by some denomination
[2:00:03] oh it's good if i can be represented by
[2:00:05] that
[2:00:07] i'm a baptist oh okay then you're okay
[2:00:12] the baptist despise
[2:00:15] or they used to
[2:00:18] everything the catholic church stood for
[2:00:20] that's right
[2:00:21] the literal body and blood
[2:00:24] praying to saints
[2:00:26] lighting candles
[2:00:28] purgatory
[2:00:30] having another
[2:00:32] intercessory between you and god
[2:00:35] a saint
[2:00:37] a pope
[2:00:39] that claims to be the vicar of christ on
[2:00:41] earth
[2:00:43] oh but nowadays
[2:00:45] they're ashamed to say anything
[2:00:48] against the catholic church
[2:00:50] they're not even protestants anymore
[2:00:54] they're daughters they change the name
[2:00:57] of protestant in for the name of
[2:00:59] daughter
[2:01:02] they don't preach against it they don't
[2:01:04] protest it they don't stand against it
[2:01:06] they're ashamed but the world recognizes
[2:01:10] and it's acceptable if you say i'm a
[2:01:13] baptist that's okay i'm a methodist
[2:01:16] that's okay i'm very but tell them
[2:01:19] that you follow a prophet that god sent
[2:01:23] in the seventh age that was a messenger
[2:01:26] that opened the seals and they'll all
[2:01:29] hate you
[2:01:35] why
[2:01:36] because that's the way he chose
[2:01:39] to do it that's right amen the word of
[2:01:42] god just the way it's written
[2:01:46] amen
[2:01:48] thank
[2:01:50] but we get to where we want to
[2:01:53] kind of
[2:01:54] make it easier to
[2:01:57] swallow
[2:02:02] you know well that's a big pill to
[2:02:04] swallow here let me
[2:02:07] shave a little bit off of it so it's not
[2:02:09] so big
[2:02:10] you know like cutting the pill in half
[2:02:14] grinding it up and trying to put it in
[2:02:16] something else can't take it the way
[2:02:19] it's written
[2:02:22] now
[2:02:23] he's looking
[2:02:25] and he's saying
[2:02:27] are they ashamed
[2:02:30] that's what he's asking
[2:02:33] that's the question
[2:02:35] that we've got to sit back and ask
[2:02:37] ourselves am i
[2:02:39] without even knowing it
[2:02:42] has the world system around me
[2:02:46] and he just said the world will test you
[2:02:51] it'll try you
[2:02:53] god will allow you to get in a place
[2:02:58] and a position
[2:03:01] that forces you
[2:03:04] to find out if you're
[2:03:06] ashamed or embarrassed
[2:03:08] or not
[2:03:14] i'm not going to do that that's wrong
[2:03:19] i remember i was just a young christian
[2:03:22] i i never thought it was a big deal it
[2:03:24] was just natural to me
[2:03:26] but i put some money in the coke machine
[2:03:28] when i first moved to montana and the
[2:03:30] crazy thing i you think it was a slot
[2:03:32] machine or something quarters just
[2:03:34] started pouring out of that
[2:03:37] so i took those quarters out
[2:03:40] and i put them in my
[2:03:41] little jacket pocket and the guy said
[2:03:44] hey you're going to buy us a coke or hey
[2:03:45] let's keep that for coke money i said no
[2:03:48] i'm bringing it up to the office and
[2:03:50] turning it in
[2:03:53] why
[2:03:54] that was just natural
[2:03:56] i wasn't ashamed to do that
[2:03:58] i wasn't embarrassed to take something
[2:04:01] that wasn't mine
[2:04:06] and you know it's
[2:04:09] i find christians do it all the time
[2:04:11] they buy something they wear at once
[2:04:14] to whatever event they bought it for and
[2:04:16] they bring it back that's stealing
[2:04:26] you know i never used to think about
[2:04:28] going throwing a trash can or throwing
[2:04:31] you know some trash bags in somebody
[2:04:33] else's dumpster
[2:04:35] till i had a dumpster that i was paying
[2:04:38] four hundred dollars a month for and six
[2:04:40] hundred dollars a load for and all of a
[2:04:42] sudden i didn't appreciate all the
[2:04:44] people that threw their trash in my
[2:04:46] dumpster
[2:04:48] i'm stealing their space
[2:04:53] see but
[2:04:54] we don't look at the word
[2:04:58] being in us
[2:05:00] the wake
[2:05:01] it was
[2:05:03] the way it
[2:05:05] it was in him
[2:05:07] as he as he said it here
[2:05:10] when it comes to the time
[2:05:12] that you'll have to stand for that word
[2:05:17] and and we make that claim
[2:05:20] so we we see that as we move forward
[2:05:23] that
[2:05:24] they don't care
[2:05:26] that they can identify with christianity
[2:05:29] and i thought this was a beautiful word
[2:05:32] that really helped us
[2:05:33] understand what we're trying to say this
[2:05:35] morning god has got his eye on us
[2:05:41] looking to see are we ashamed
[2:05:47] because he's if you're not faithful
[2:05:51] and little
[2:05:52] he can't commit to you much
[2:05:57] if you're you're if you're ashamed of
[2:05:59] the word that produces signs and wonders
[2:06:02] how is he going to commit signs and
[2:06:04] wonders into your hands that you don't
[2:06:06] take the glory for it
[2:06:11] he says
[2:06:13] he says
[2:06:15] shame he says now
[2:06:17] that's the way that so-called
[2:06:19] christianity is today
[2:06:22] if you name
[2:06:24] if you name it a name of a denomination
[2:06:27] all right they accept the fatherhood
[2:06:32] of denomination
[2:06:36] they accept that you've been birthed by
[2:06:38] a denomination
[2:06:41] that you've been birthed by a teaching
[2:06:45] by creeds and doctrines and a system
[2:06:48] they don't mind if your birth than that
[2:06:52] they don't care how you've been baptized
[2:06:55] that they don't care because really
[2:06:58] you're under one father the devil
[2:07:02] and one mother the roman catholic church
[2:07:07] he said
[2:07:08] that's all right they accept
[2:07:11] the fatherhood of denomination but when
[2:07:13] it comes to accepting the fatherhood of
[2:07:17] the word of god christ
[2:07:20] know
[2:07:20] they're
[2:07:21] embarrassed
[2:07:25] just think of that
[2:07:27] so
[2:07:27] where we as we come down
[2:07:31] and and we
[2:07:33] we just take a a moment to
[2:07:37] look at these things he said now
[2:07:41] we're moving into a little something
[2:07:43] i'll try to close here shortly
[2:07:45] but how can a man who is filled with the
[2:07:48] holy ghost
[2:07:50] how can a man feel full of the power of
[2:07:54] god
[2:07:55] and the love of god in his heart
[2:07:59] talk to a man a few minutes
[2:08:02] and not mention something about that
[2:08:06] love that's in his heart
[2:08:08] now
[2:08:11] see there's something it happens
[2:08:16] you can't do it
[2:08:19] so he you know he didn't say mention
[2:08:21] serpent seed
[2:08:24] he didn't say slap them upside the head
[2:08:27] with water baptism
[2:08:30] some people are so combative with the
[2:08:33] word of god they just really what they
[2:08:36] want to do is they want to prove that
[2:08:38] guy is wrong
[2:08:42] your doctrine's wrong your church is
[2:08:44] wrong what you believe wrong so if
[2:08:47] you're wrong then i must be right no
[2:08:50] you're both wrong
[2:08:54] that's not what he said
[2:08:56] he said you cannot talk to a person very
[2:08:59] long
[2:09:00] that that
[2:09:02] love the love
[2:09:06] the nature the spirit the joy the peace
[2:09:10] doesn't speak out to that man
[2:09:15] it doesn't even have to be in words
[2:09:20] but he speaks
[2:09:24] he he sees your compassion he sees your
[2:09:28] care he sees your concern he sees your
[2:09:30] willingness to help why it's christ
[2:09:33] living in you the hope of glory
[2:09:37] now he's looking at his church and
[2:09:39] saying i'm going to take
[2:09:42] my abode
[2:09:44] in a body of believers
[2:09:46] just exactly the way i took my abode and
[2:09:50] my son jesus are they going to be
[2:09:52] ashamed of that
[2:09:57] because we're moving up to a step
[2:10:05] we're moving to something a little
[2:10:07] higher
[2:10:16] he says
[2:10:17] you know if a guy can't do that
[2:10:20] if that love he can't let that love not
[2:10:23] even mention something about he says
[2:10:25] what's happened
[2:10:27] that's that keeps that
[2:10:29] this
[2:10:30] this is must be that evil day that jesus
[2:10:33] spoke of
[2:10:34] people are ashamed of the word
[2:10:38] and of the spirit of god that acts
[2:10:42] within them
[2:10:46] we want to put an intellectual buffer
[2:10:50] between the spirit acting itself in and
[2:10:54] make contact with the person's mind
[2:10:57] so they don't think you're totally
[2:11:00] a fool
[2:11:05] but i'm a fool
[2:11:07] for christ
[2:11:11] unadulterated fountain of love
[2:11:14] pouring out from within us the way that
[2:11:17] the spirit and i'm this is my word but
[2:11:19] to get what's in my heart expressed he
[2:11:23] says
[2:11:24] the word the spirit the way that god
[2:11:28] wants his spirit to act within you
[2:11:32] so his he wants his spirit
[2:11:37] to be
[2:11:38] acting in you
[2:11:43] now i admit it's probably harder for
[2:11:45] high school students
[2:11:47] and young college students
[2:11:49] to let the spirit of god act in you
[2:11:51] especially when you're with all that
[2:11:53] nonsense and all that philosophies and
[2:11:57] all the stuff and garbage they teach
[2:12:06] you know it wouldn't be something they
[2:12:08] just teach some old
[2:12:10] idea that
[2:12:13] evolution or something
[2:12:15] and you come walking out of class and
[2:12:16] you just say the love of god's boy in
[2:12:18] your heart he says you really know
[2:12:20] that's not true
[2:12:23] amen
[2:12:25] you know you know god's god's our
[2:12:27] creator
[2:12:29] the only reason they teach that is to
[2:12:31] keep you from getting saved
[2:12:38] you know
[2:12:40] i haven't mentioned it but i'm going to
[2:12:42] mention it
[2:12:43] this morning
[2:12:45] just like when this black lives mattered
[2:12:49] and some of our young people
[2:12:51] got cut up
[2:12:52] up in that
[2:12:54] oh we're not privileged
[2:12:58] white privilege
[2:13:01] i wish as many white people believe this
[2:13:05] message as black people do
[2:13:09] they are the most privileged people
[2:13:12] thousands and thousands of believers in
[2:13:16] africa in other places have got the
[2:13:20] god-given
[2:13:21] anointed privilege
[2:13:24] of seeing god's word
[2:13:27] i worship the god that's in you brother
[2:13:32] i have no problem kneeling and washing
[2:13:35] your feet and saying i love the god
[2:13:38] that's in you the son of god i worship
[2:13:41] you
[2:13:46] that's what brother branham said
[2:13:48] he said you are a possessor of god
[2:13:55] but just to get caught up in politics
[2:13:58] it's corrupt
[2:14:00] [Music]
[2:14:01] [Applause]
[2:14:03] i'm embarrassed for america i'm
[2:14:05] embarrassed for its politics i'm
[2:14:08] embarrassed for what's going on
[2:14:13] but i'm not embarrassed of god given the
[2:14:15] revelation of the seventh seal to any
[2:14:18] man no matter what color they are
[2:14:23] don't you get caught up in preaching
[2:14:25] that gospel so you can be popular in a
[2:14:28] little circle of people
[2:14:35] bonder free
[2:14:36] junior greek
[2:14:38] male or female we are all christ and
[2:14:41] christ is god amen
[2:14:45] thank you lord
[2:14:46] it must be this evil age that jesus was
[2:14:48] speaking of
[2:14:50] people are ashamed of the word and the
[2:14:52] spirit of god that acts
[2:14:55] with
[2:14:56] in them
[2:14:58] isn't that isn't that something
[2:15:02] now listen to this just as we move
[2:15:04] towards
[2:15:06] our
[2:15:06] closing
[2:15:08] and remember
[2:15:10] you might meet a spirit
[2:15:12] that would act like god
[2:15:15] you might meet a spirit
[2:15:17] would do this and that
[2:15:20] or the other follow it a little bit
[2:15:24] and see how it compares with the word
[2:15:28] of god
[2:15:32] amen
[2:15:33] i mean you come into this church and you
[2:15:35] got a picture here and you got a picture
[2:15:37] there you got a pyramid here you got a
[2:15:40] cloud there what's this
[2:15:43] you know
[2:15:45] what what have i stepped into
[2:15:47] follow it a little bit you think i'm
[2:15:50] ashamed to anybody check it out
[2:15:53] i'll be happy to sit down with the bible
[2:16:00] i talk with the head
[2:16:02] man
[2:16:03] of the whole western conference
[2:16:08] of the upc
[2:16:12] and explained the godhead to him
[2:16:15] and he sat and closed his bible and said
[2:16:17] i've never heard it that way i thought
[2:16:19] you even what do you mean
[2:16:22] brother random walked through your yanks
[2:16:24] for years
[2:16:27] and then so i got the opportunity to
[2:16:29] meet another great
[2:16:32] beyond the state presbyter way up there
[2:16:35] in the church about water baptism
[2:16:39] you know his answer to me was well i see
[2:16:41] by the scriptures that both ways are
[2:16:43] correct
[2:16:47] now we have a god that gives us options
[2:16:52] god don't give options
[2:16:55] he's not an option god it's not multiple
[2:16:58] choice
[2:17:02] he has a will
[2:17:04] he has a way
[2:17:06] and his will is his word and his way is
[2:17:10] the holy ghost
[2:17:12] he's not a god of options
[2:17:15] you don't pick what you want to believe
[2:17:18] out of the bible and create your own
[2:17:20] religion and build your own system and
[2:17:24] teach your own line of thought
[2:17:27] he's looking for christians that take it
[2:17:29] just the way that it's written and
[2:17:31] they're not embarrassed
[2:17:35] how would you like to get up there
[2:17:38] and there he is to meet you
[2:17:43] and he looks at you and says man you
[2:17:45] never did tell your best friend about me
[2:17:49] were you embarrassed
[2:17:52] were you ashamed of the way that
[2:17:55] you dressed
[2:17:59] were you ashamed of your long hair were
[2:18:01] you a were you ashamed that you
[2:18:02] were shame-faced
[2:18:06] we're supposed to live such a radiant
[2:18:08] life
[2:18:09] that people inquire of us
[2:18:11] what is the hope that's in you
[2:18:14] and then are we willing to stand up and
[2:18:17] meet that
[2:18:18] great thing he says follow it a little
[2:18:21] while see if it compares with the words
[2:18:24] you might meet a spirit that would tell
[2:18:26] you you are saved
[2:18:28] and give you a glorious feeling
[2:18:32] and you would shout and scream
[2:18:34] then when it comes to denying the word
[2:18:38] how can the holy spirit that wrote the
[2:18:41] word deny his own word
[2:18:44] that spirit
[2:18:48] must punctuate
[2:18:49] every promise of god with an amen
[2:18:54] if it isn't
[2:18:56] then you never
[2:18:57] meant god
[2:18:59] you've meant a deceiving spirit and the
[2:19:03] world is full of it today
[2:19:09] see what i'm saying is we've got to the
[2:19:11] place that we've so elected ourselves
[2:19:14] that we're not even on our toes anymore
[2:19:17] you know what that means right we're not
[2:19:19] alert no more
[2:19:21] we don't think no spirit can get us we
[2:19:23] don't think we can be deceived
[2:19:25] we don't we don't think that an angel
[2:19:29] a spirit can appear as an angel of
[2:19:33] and say i'm god speaking to you
[2:19:38] he said what do you measure it by
[2:19:40] not by the feeling not by the emotion
[2:19:43] you go back to the word of god
[2:19:47] and you measure it
[2:19:49] by the word of god
[2:19:52] now i say that because that's what he's
[2:19:55] looking for
[2:19:58] that's what he's looking for
[2:20:01] he's looking are my children ashamed of
[2:20:03] me
[2:20:04] are they trying every spirit
[2:20:07] to see where it comes from
[2:20:10] are they accepting
[2:20:12] what's preached just because of the
[2:20:15] anointing
[2:20:17] that's why he brought up the example of
[2:20:19] the full gospel businessman
[2:20:22] he didn't bring that up for because none
[2:20:24] of us were going to join it
[2:20:28] he brought it up as an example
[2:20:31] that people are going to get in the
[2:20:33] pulpit
[2:20:35] and they're going to preach things with
[2:20:37] great anointing tell you you're saved
[2:20:40] tell you you're elected tell you're the
[2:20:43] choice chosen make you feel glorious
[2:20:54] are we going to let our bars down
[2:20:57] we've got something to measure it by
[2:21:03] we've got to take you've got to take
[2:21:05] what i say
[2:21:07] and run it through god's word
[2:21:11] and if i'm wrong you're obligated to
[2:21:13] come to me and say brother you didn't
[2:21:15] say that just right
[2:21:17] and if i'm any kind of man and have any
[2:21:20] kind of love of god the first chance i
[2:21:23] did i'll be in that pulpit saying i said
[2:21:25] this wrong i didn't mean it that way
[2:21:27] this is what the prophet of god really
[2:21:29] said
[2:21:33] but we've elected ourselves
[2:21:35] to the point that we don't have to make
[2:21:37] a stand
[2:21:40] we don't have to filter the word
[2:21:43] see i really believe this church is
[2:21:45] heading for something marvelous
[2:21:48] yes sir
[2:21:49] god working in our midst
[2:21:52] baptizing and praying for the sick and
[2:21:56] people being filled with the holy ghost
[2:21:58] their lives being transformed getting
[2:22:00] deliverances
[2:22:04] sure we're ashamed of ourselves a lot of
[2:22:06] things the things we've done
[2:22:08] but you can't stay beat down forever
[2:22:14] if you confess your sins he's faithful
[2:22:16] and just to forgive you they're thrown
[2:22:19] in the sea of god's forgetfulness stand
[2:22:21] up and don't be ashamed that he forgave
[2:22:24] you
[2:22:27] any man that says he sin not is a liar
[2:22:30] but we have a great petitionary before
[2:22:33] us
[2:22:34] in the lord jesus that forgives us of
[2:22:36] all our unrighteousness
[2:22:41] so
[2:22:44] as we
[2:22:45] as we look at these
[2:22:47] great things
[2:22:49] he said there was a man in a very
[2:22:51] scientific age
[2:22:52] by the name of noah
[2:22:55] he wasn't ashamed of god's word
[2:23:00] now he's going to start talking
[2:23:02] to us about the people before that
[2:23:06] weren't ashamed
[2:23:07] now what about us
[2:23:11] look at what noah
[2:23:13] was put into a scientific age that
[2:23:16] proved there's no rain
[2:23:18] we're in a church age
[2:23:21] that proves there's no prophets
[2:23:27] there was a man a very scientific age by
[2:23:29] the name of noah he wasn't ashamed of
[2:23:31] god's word
[2:23:33] god meant him
[2:23:34] and talked
[2:23:36] talked
[2:23:37] to him
[2:23:39] he knew it was god and he said it's
[2:23:42] going to rain
[2:23:43] it's never had rain
[2:23:45] but he believed it was going to rain
[2:23:48] and the faith that he had he wasn't
[2:23:51] ashamed to exercise it
[2:23:57] there's a difference in having it and
[2:24:00] exercising it
[2:24:02] embarrassed to exercise it
[2:24:07] in other words
[2:24:09] just to use a personal example the other
[2:24:11] day i met a lady and she was
[2:24:13] laying on the bed and she was thin and
[2:24:16] she had a covering on her head she
[2:24:18] looked to me like a a
[2:24:20] maybe a cancer patient
[2:24:23] so i asked her is there anything wrong
[2:24:25] with you
[2:24:26] are you sick
[2:24:28] and maybe she was worried about clovid i
[2:24:30] don't know but she said
[2:24:34] i'm tired
[2:24:36] well i just wanted just her to say well
[2:24:39] i'm suffering with cancer because i
[2:24:41] wanted to pray for him
[2:24:44] you know and i got the thing i had
[2:24:45] prayed for if she was tired
[2:24:49] i have a god that can give you strength
[2:24:51] i have a god that can renew you
[2:24:54] [Music]
[2:24:59] he wasn't ashamed to exercise it
[2:25:02] he took
[2:25:04] 120 years to build an ark when the world
[2:25:07] was against him he wasn't ashamed of
[2:25:10] god's word in his day
[2:25:12] god saved him
[2:25:13] and his household for it
[2:25:16] the how foolish it might have seemed
[2:25:19] to the other people but to him he meant
[2:25:23] god and no matter how
[2:25:26] scientific the other was
[2:25:28] that was contrary
[2:25:31] how it said
[2:25:33] it couldn't happen it couldn't happen he
[2:25:36] had meant god
[2:25:42] when you meet god
[2:25:44] that's what makes the difference
[2:25:46] otherwise you're unsure
[2:25:50] you know you know it
[2:25:52] it it
[2:25:54] and what did god do
[2:25:57] god commissioned
[2:26:01] noah to build an ark
[2:26:04] he meant god and god gave him something
[2:26:07] to do
[2:26:09] he gave him a message to share
[2:26:12] it's going to rain
[2:26:14] the world's going to flood
[2:26:17] i'm giving you an example
[2:26:20] of what to do
[2:26:24] a hundred and twenty years he built this
[2:26:26] ship
[2:26:28] they they they gathered the animals how
[2:26:30] they came and and and that was all
[2:26:33] according to god's doing
[2:26:36] but he wasn't ashamed
[2:26:39] or embarrassed to say it was going to
[2:26:42] reign because he meant god
[2:26:46] it came from god
[2:26:49] if it comes from intellect to intellect
[2:26:53] and you're trying to deal with someone
[2:26:55] in the intellect you'll be embarrassed
[2:27:00] you'll be ashamed
[2:27:02] because you can't intellectually explain
[2:27:05] this
[2:27:09] but when you meet god
[2:27:11] and you know beyond the shadow of a
[2:27:13] doubt that's the same pillar of fire
[2:27:15] that led to children of israel
[2:27:17] you know that god took this man from
[2:27:19] nothing sent him around the world and
[2:27:22] that he laid store food and a storehouse
[2:27:25] that we could feed on it
[2:27:29] and you receive
[2:27:30] something
[2:27:32] that's right
[2:27:35] he said it just puts me in mind
[2:27:39] of something like ourselves
[2:27:42] then i said to the people
[2:27:44] i'm getting to a spot i need more faith
[2:27:49] i think that's
[2:27:51] really what
[2:27:53] kind of where we're at
[2:27:56] that's what i'm home for now is to get a
[2:27:58] new burst of faith
[2:28:01] god's soul looks like when you pray for
[2:28:04] people you apologize
[2:28:06] mr devil
[2:28:07] would you please move over
[2:28:10] and let me
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:16] nothing
[2:28:17] faith has got muscles hair on his chest
[2:28:20] when it speaks everything else shuts up
[2:28:23] don't go in mr devil you move out
[2:28:28] get out of here
[2:28:30] i'm a son of god now listen to this
[2:28:33] commissioned
[2:28:36] of god
[2:28:39] leave them alone
[2:28:42] that moves
[2:28:45] you have no apology to the devil
[2:28:49] nothing to do with him
[2:28:51] not ashamed of the word of god not
[2:28:54] ashamed of your commission
[2:28:58] not ashamed of who we are
[2:29:01] not ashamed of your
[2:29:05] commissions amen
[2:29:08] god wanted to accomplish something
[2:29:11] so he commissions men because god uses
[2:29:14] men he commissions men to carry out what
[2:29:18] he wants to accomplish
[2:29:22] he wanted to spread the gospel
[2:29:26] of salvation
[2:29:28] so in the upper room he sent him up
[2:29:30] there and he commissioned them to go
[2:29:32] into all the world and preach the gospel
[2:29:35] lay hands on the sick they weren't
[2:29:37] ashamed
[2:29:39] of their commission
[2:29:41] they weren't ashamed when peter went to
[2:29:43] the gate called beautiful they weren't
[2:29:45] ashamed to exercise silver and gold have
[2:29:48] i none but what i've got i'm not ashamed
[2:29:51] of
[2:29:55] now that's what god's looking for
[2:29:58] he's looking to see
[2:30:01] if
[2:30:03] there's something that
[2:30:05] it is so
[2:30:07] real to us
[2:30:10] the only shame
[2:30:12] that i am
[2:30:14] is i'm a branham
[2:30:16] that's my earthly birth i'm ashamed of
[2:30:19] my failures
[2:30:21] but as a servant
[2:30:22] i'm not ashamed
[2:30:24] i'm not ashamed of his word
[2:30:28] whether it's denominations kings
[2:30:30] potentates
[2:30:31] whatever it might be just ready to give
[2:30:35] an answer
[2:30:37] god
[2:30:39] calls
[2:30:40] for it
[2:30:43] let that sink
[2:30:44] in
[2:30:46] god calls for it
[2:30:50] he wanted something to
[2:30:53] get the children of israel
[2:30:56] out of bondage
[2:30:58] is that right and so what did he do
[2:31:02] he called for it
[2:31:04] he called moses
[2:31:07] gave him a commission
[2:31:09] and said go down there and set my people
[2:31:12] free take the stick
[2:31:15] he wasn't ashamed
[2:31:17] because he had a commission
[2:31:20] he knew where he meant god and he knew
[2:31:22] what god told him to do
[2:31:26] so he wasn't afraid to walk up because
[2:31:29] god calls for it in other words god is
[2:31:32] calling for you
[2:31:35] not to be ashamed
[2:31:37] he's calling for you to let the word be
[2:31:40] made in flesh he's calling in you to
[2:31:43] exercise your faith it's a requirement
[2:31:48] we're not going to get in on belief
[2:31:53] we're going to get in on manifested life
[2:31:58] it's a call of god in this hour
[2:32:01] to not to be ashamed
[2:32:04] to not to be embarrassed
[2:32:06] to stand up
[2:32:09] no apologies to the devil that's what
[2:32:12] god's calling for
[2:32:14] that's what he's asking his children to
[2:32:17] be
[2:32:18] bold and
[2:32:19] and and shameless
[2:32:21] carrying out their great commission
[2:32:24] and any disciple of christ
[2:32:27] who has come in contact this is
[2:32:29] paragraph 218 of the same book i'm sorry
[2:32:32] that i haven't been given the paragraph
[2:32:34] number
[2:32:35] any disciple of christ who has come in
[2:32:38] contact with him
[2:32:41] in redemption
[2:32:43] and salvation
[2:32:45] has come in to his heart
[2:32:48] he is a possessor
[2:32:50] of god
[2:32:54] what kind of life should we live
[2:32:56] and how should we have walk and how
[2:32:59] should we walk
[2:33:01] and how should we talk
[2:33:03] if god is representing himself
[2:33:06] through our own mortal bodies
[2:33:10] who could be ashamed
[2:33:13] of that
[2:33:18] you see what he wants to do right
[2:33:21] in this bride
[2:33:23] he wants her to be the last
[2:33:25] representation of the possession
[2:33:29] of god
[2:33:32] he wants to represent
[2:33:34] himself
[2:33:35] and now he's saying are we ashamed
[2:33:39] of that
[2:33:42] are we ashamed of what this really
[2:33:44] gospel is
[2:33:46] are we really embarrassed
[2:33:48] that he's called out
[2:33:50] an elect lady
[2:33:52] see we don't have power
[2:33:54] the police listen listen to this this is
[2:33:56] beautiful
[2:33:58] and then if i'm a christian
[2:34:00] and being filled with the spirit this is
[2:34:02] paragraph 220
[2:34:04] being filled with the spirit
[2:34:07] wearing
[2:34:08] the testimony of jesus christ's
[2:34:14] resurrection wearing the testimony
[2:34:19] of jesus christ resurrection
[2:34:23] what's your hope he's risen
[2:34:27] how are you going to get through this
[2:34:29] he's risen
[2:34:31] he's alive
[2:34:32] he will not leave me nor forsake me
[2:34:36] he'll be with me even until the end
[2:34:39] i'm identified with him i'm not ashamed
[2:34:42] that he died for me i was a sinner he
[2:34:45] died for me he forgave me my sins he
[2:34:48] sent his spirit to lead me and guide me
[2:34:50] into all truth to correct me when i make
[2:34:53] a mistake to chastise me when i'm wrong
[2:34:58] to humble me
[2:34:59] when i get proud
[2:35:02] to lead me into good works
[2:35:06] i have a spirit leading me i'm not
[2:35:07] ashamed of that
[2:35:10] but if i'm not sure
[2:35:15] then i'm going to shrink back
[2:35:17] but if i'm sure
[2:35:20] i've got a fountain motivating me
[2:35:24] and he said how
[2:35:27] he he said
[2:35:29] and just to
[2:35:30] say this again
[2:35:32] he said
[2:35:36] god calls
[2:35:39] for it he's calling for us
[2:35:42] not
[2:35:43] to be
[2:35:44] ashamed
[2:35:45] or embarrassed of what he's done in this
[2:35:48] age
[2:35:50] and if i'm a christian filled with the
[2:35:52] spirit
[2:35:53] wearing the testimony of jesus
[2:35:55] resurrection
[2:35:56] that he is the same yesterday day and
[2:35:59] forever
[2:36:00] don't let any devil try to push you
[2:36:04] around
[2:36:06] and say you don't do this and you don't
[2:36:09] do that
[2:36:10] you do
[2:36:11] do it
[2:36:13] god has given you the authority
[2:36:18] we don't have power
[2:36:20] the policemen don't have power
[2:36:23] to stop one car
[2:36:25] sometimes they have four or 500
[2:36:28] horsepower motor
[2:36:29] what could he do about it but he's got
[2:36:32] the authority
[2:36:34] and that's the church we have authority
[2:36:37] by the resurrection of jesus christ and
[2:36:41] his promised word hallelujah that the
[2:36:44] things that i do
[2:36:46] shall you do also and more than this
[2:36:50] will you do for i go
[2:36:53] unto
[2:36:54] the father
[2:36:57] are we ashamed
[2:36:59] or embarrassed
[2:37:02] to step up
[2:37:05] to the manifestation
[2:37:07] of god's
[2:37:08] word promised
[2:37:10] in this hour
[2:37:12] he didn't call us out
[2:37:14] so we could all say that god sent us a
[2:37:18] prophet
[2:37:21] he took the prophet
[2:37:24] to call us out
[2:37:27] to give us the word
[2:37:30] and to prepare us
[2:37:33] that that spirit
[2:37:34] might be able to enter into us with pure
[2:37:38] representation
[2:37:41] and do the works that he did also
[2:37:46] the proof of the resurrection
[2:37:51] if we leave them
[2:37:53] in pictures
[2:37:54] and we leave them
[2:37:55] in books
[2:37:57] everybody's got that idea but when he's
[2:38:01] not ashamed of his bride
[2:38:04] and he wants to identify himself in her
[2:38:08] and he's looking and he's saying i want
[2:38:11] to come into your life
[2:38:13] i want to identify my faith my
[2:38:16] resurrection power
[2:38:18] i want to manifest myself in you
[2:38:26] are you ashamed
[2:38:28] if i do that
[2:38:31] noah wasn't ashamed
[2:38:33] moses wasn't ashamed
[2:38:35] david wasn't ashamed
[2:38:38] samson wasn't ashamed
[2:38:41] no are we ashamed
[2:38:43] are we embarrassed
[2:38:45] because if we
[2:38:47] let him live in us
[2:38:50] we are going to be so fanatical
[2:38:54] to the world
[2:38:57] but yet he said how can a man be with
[2:39:00] something god's
[2:39:02] calling for it
[2:39:05] he's calling for us
[2:39:07] not to be
[2:39:09] ashamed
[2:39:11] and i know all kinds of things go
[2:39:13] through your mind oh
[2:39:15] do i just walk up and and say this let
[2:39:18] me tell you something
[2:39:20] god
[2:39:21] presents the situation
[2:39:25] he creates the situation you don't
[2:39:30] just like at the fair when that guy just
[2:39:33] kept
[2:39:34] saying the story of noah wasn't true and
[2:39:36] all this stuff jonah and he said i just
[2:39:39] couldn't take it no more god created
[2:39:42] that situation you don't have to go out
[2:39:44] and create it he'll create it for you
[2:39:47] he'll put you in the place god called
[2:39:50] moses and put moses in the spot that he
[2:39:54] had to stand in front of pharaoh
[2:39:56] moses didn't do that
[2:39:59] moses didn't say hey these are god's
[2:40:01] people he's got a place over here let
[2:40:03] him go no god he didn't create the
[2:40:05] situation god created it
[2:40:08] and that's what he's saying the world's
[2:40:10] gonna try you god is going to create
[2:40:13] situations
[2:40:15] in your life
[2:40:17] where you're going to have to stand for
[2:40:19] the word he calls for it
[2:40:24] just like he said let there be light he
[2:40:26] called for light
[2:40:29] just like he said a real believer
[2:40:31] separates himself from unbelief
[2:40:35] he called for it
[2:40:37] he called for the separation
[2:40:39] and now he's calling
[2:40:42] for a people
[2:40:43] that will stand up and not be ashamed
[2:40:46] it's our challenge church
[2:40:50] it's the challenge that we're facing
[2:40:52] right now
[2:40:53] not to be ashamed
[2:40:55] of the leadership
[2:40:58] not to be ashamed of fresh
[2:41:01] revelation
[2:41:02] that changes your life
[2:41:05] and to move forward
[2:41:07] amen that close with this this morning
[2:41:15] he says way back in the jungles of
[2:41:16] africa on safari hunters
[2:41:20] they had to take high-powered radios to
[2:41:23] hear elvis presley and pat boone
[2:41:25] and them guys
[2:41:27] with the rock and roll and twist
[2:41:30] and the natives
[2:41:32] trying to see them act along jerking
[2:41:36] their heads and acting like that
[2:41:39] the natives stood and looked at it
[2:41:43] but you see
[2:41:45] they're not americans like pat boone and
[2:41:48] elvis presley
[2:41:50] and ricky nelson
[2:41:52] and them guys are
[2:41:54] they're not judases of that type
[2:41:57] but you see it's a spirit
[2:42:00] and the spirit is not only in america
[2:42:03] it has spread itself out over the world
[2:42:08] to bring them to the battle of
[2:42:10] armageddon
[2:42:12] and they act
[2:42:13] like that
[2:42:16] what they are whatever nation they come
[2:42:19] from africa india whatever it is the
[2:42:22] vulgar stuff has spread all over the
[2:42:26] earth but just one man
[2:42:29] started it
[2:42:31] so the gospel
[2:42:33] and the power of the almighty god
[2:42:36] has sped around the world
[2:42:38] and the separating time is now taking
[2:42:41] place
[2:42:42] when god is calling a bride
[2:42:45] and the devil is calling a church
[2:42:48] let me be
[2:42:49] part
[2:42:51] of the bride
[2:42:52] when the calling out comes
[2:42:55] are we embarrassed
[2:42:59] does it make sense to somebody no
[2:43:03] no not if someone thinks that they're
[2:43:05] 100 percent
[2:43:08] but i'll tell you that elected
[2:43:11] they're hungering
[2:43:12] for more of god
[2:43:14] so
[2:43:15] and and i
[2:43:17] want to say this
[2:43:18] in closing
[2:43:22] god's calling for it
[2:43:25] it's a requirement
[2:43:27] of his bride
[2:43:29] not to be ashamed
[2:43:32] you will find yourself in more
[2:43:34] situations than you've ever found
[2:43:36] yourself before
[2:43:38] to make a stand
[2:43:41] be humble
[2:43:43] be sweet
[2:43:46] let the love of god be shed abroad in
[2:43:48] your heart
[2:43:49] we're not combative
[2:43:51] we're not trying to prove anything wrong
[2:43:54] but we've meant god
[2:43:57] amen
[2:43:59] and the truth is the truth amen
[2:44:03] and it's by grace
[2:44:06] he's opened our hearts and eyes
[2:44:09] and now he says this is what i've done
[2:44:11] for you
[2:44:12] i've revealed to you
[2:44:15] my word in its day because it had to be
[2:44:19] manifested
[2:44:21] i let you see it in the word of god that
[2:44:24] god sent a prophet messenger
[2:44:26] the seventh church age
[2:44:30] angel the fulfillment of malachi 4 5.
[2:44:34] i've let you see that
[2:44:36] i've opened to you the seals
[2:44:39] and showed you the church history
[2:44:44] not the history part
[2:44:47] man had already known that
[2:44:49] but the spirit
[2:44:51] moving in the church that's what they
[2:44:52] didn't see
[2:44:55] they could all see luther wesley they
[2:44:58] could see all those things they could
[2:45:00] see those things but what they couldn't
[2:45:02] see is the spirit but he revealed that
[2:45:05] to you
[2:45:06] and now he wants what he's done
[2:45:09] living in us
[2:45:12] the last voice and he's asking us
[2:45:15] and he's looking at us and saying i'm
[2:45:18] requiring you
[2:45:20] not to be ashamed
[2:45:24] this is what i'm looking for
[2:45:27] i'm looking for this characteristic that
[2:45:30] was in moses
[2:45:32] that was in john the baptist that was in
[2:45:34] david
[2:45:36] that was in saul and samson i'm looking
[2:45:38] for that same boldness
[2:45:41] because you've meant god i'm looking for
[2:45:43] a church that's not ashamed of the
[2:45:46] commission
[2:45:48] that god's given them
[2:45:51] and i know you might look at yourself
[2:45:53] and see you're not able but let me say
[2:45:57] have a meeting with them
[2:46:01] there's people that nobody else can
[2:46:03] touch
[2:46:04] but you
[2:46:05] be yourself
[2:46:08] you don't have to produce wool
[2:46:10] you bear wool
[2:46:12] but let's never be ashamed
[2:46:15] of what god
[2:46:17] has called us
[2:46:19] and showed us
[2:46:20] and i want to emphasize this in closing
[2:46:22] now
[2:46:25] he's looking
[2:46:27] to see
[2:46:29] who's not ashamed
[2:46:31] he's calling us
[2:46:33] to that place
[2:46:34] where we're not embarrassed of this
[2:46:36] message
[2:46:37] or this word
[2:46:39] and i believe that the blessings that
[2:46:41] follow
[2:46:42] are going to be unspeakable
[2:46:45] amen let's
[2:46:46] stand in this powerheads
[2:46:57] this morning if
[2:47:02] in your heart you may
[2:47:05] have felt that
[2:47:07] maybe you've shrunk back a little bit or
[2:47:12] you feel that you might have not
[2:47:15] taken advantage of an opportunity that
[2:47:18] was presented to you
[2:47:22] or you got so busy with the cares of
[2:47:25] your life that
[2:47:28] you haven't even thought of sowing a
[2:47:30] seed or doing a work
[2:47:33] for the kingdom
[2:47:36] and you know that's not your heart
[2:47:44] but you'd like this morning to
[2:47:48] say lord i'd like to be a little bolder
[2:47:52] maybe not just with the words that flow
[2:47:55] out of my mouth
[2:47:57] but i want to be a little bolder in my
[2:47:59] decisions
[2:48:00] i want to be a little bolder in my
[2:48:02] actions
[2:48:05] i want to stand up
[2:48:07] strong with my shoulders back and
[2:48:11] as a representative
[2:48:14] of the resurrection
[2:48:17] the testimony of the resurrection living
[2:48:20] in me
[2:48:24] that i become a portion of god
[2:48:28] and i'm not ashamed of that
[2:48:32] just that statement alone the
[2:48:35] the world would cringe at
[2:48:37] that it was even
[2:48:39] spoken that someone would even
[2:48:43] say such a thing as that
[2:48:46] but yet lord it's it's so true
[2:48:50] and father we just
[2:48:54] we want to take our place
[2:48:58] we want to accept our privilege
[2:49:02] we want to stand proud and
[2:49:05] unashamed
[2:49:07] because that's what you're looking for
[2:49:09] [Music]
[2:49:11] because you said if you're ashamed of me
[2:49:13] before men
[2:49:16] then i'll be ashamed of you because you
[2:49:18] professed
[2:49:20] to follow me
[2:49:24] you profess
[2:49:25] that you represented me
[2:49:29] and you never
[2:49:30] stood for the truth
[2:49:32] and you were embarrassed
[2:49:35] lord i don't want to meet that day
[2:49:38] lord i ask that you help me be obedient
[2:49:40] to your word
[2:49:43] let you help me free myself from the
[2:49:45] world father

[2:49:51] heart

[2:50:58] great representation
[2:51:01] that you're asking
[2:51:03] your children to make
[2:51:07] and it's contrary to the everything that
[2:51:10] everything in this world stands for
