Description:
Singing Service
CLT Annual Meetings
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 16th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

I realized there was a a failure on the uh driver's side. I took it again to the mechanic for to to check it. There was a noise. Uh, my family knew about it and they knew that there was some noise. The mechanic uh said that it was a caliper and I changed it for a new one. I was satisfied again. A few days went by and I began to hear the sound to on the on the driver's side and I I got worried because everything was new and I felt in my heart something wasn't right. One day in the evening when I couldn't go to work I has a mechanic so I can take the car and he can check it again. and I went to the appointment time, but he wasn't there. It was dark now that it's uh gets dark earlier and I decided to wait for him. I got a little bit impatient, but something told me, "Don't leave it. Stay." I waited a little bit longer. He got there. I talked to him about the problem. Immediately he lifted up the my to my surprise when he looked under he took the bolts with his bare hands. There was no need for a tools because they were that means they were about to fall. If I would have kept driving, the the the tire would had would had fallen. I believe the Lord takes care of his children. It's for my Lord that saved my life because the same day I I I press on the brake and my car uh uh swerved. So I thought I had I was going to have an accident. It could appear like a small testimony, but in my heart there's gratitude towards my God because he takes care of his children. The glory be for my Lord. I want to finish uh saying these uh words. We had a wonderful time this weekend with a visit of precious brothers which I'm very uh thankful for how the word was open Friday to say uh give your heart I I said in my heart it was going to be perfect because it was the first time they were able to bring my our daughter. When we left the service, they had to work the next day. So, we didn't stay to eat and we left with the family. But before leaving my I take my jacket off and put it on hang it on the car. I never leave my Bible behind. I always take it with me. &gt;&gt; And because I was in a hurry that night, I put it on on on top of the car with emotion. I felt that my family was with me. We got in the car and we left. the whole way we're talking about the service, how the glory of God was manifested and I was explaining to my children the need to receive Jesus Christ all the way home very emotional when we when we driveway My wife asked me, "Where is your Bible?" I felt that happiness turned into sadness and woriness. &gt;&gt; Where is my Bible, Lord? After I was so happy and I I asked the Lord for a perfect weekend for us, I called one of the last brothers that I talked to I called him twice. I was eating with the brothers very happy.

Saturday morning, we came. I expressed my wordiness to a brother and I asked him, "No one saw my Bible and I I always leave it at the very edge of the car." Well, I I left it at the very edge of the car. So, we ate and we left the service again. So, we had to go. We were looking for the Bible all the way home. We went we were about two miles away on the highway. that and we saw my Bible. It was over a bridge on the very edge and the and the pages were immediately we say my Bible is there. Why you stopwalk? because there's no sidewalk. I turned around. I I run. &gt;&gt; The cars were very close by. And I took I got my Bible back. My honor before the Lord is not damaged. Over it. Many hours passed by. It was like I found the Lord Jesus Christ in me in the last. place where I found it. For me has a very spiritual application. I found it exactly in the middle of a bridge and they they build the bridges when there's two uh digs separation. And I thought about what men had when we fell from God's grace. Yesterday when I heard that God gave us a second wind to come back to the Lord. God is a bridge for cross to the other side where we were lost in the right place and honor. There is my Bible. Nothing is missing. It's not damaged. God bless you. [applause] God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Um, I want to sing this song and it's about what the prophet saw when he was in that uh, the curtain of time. The prophet had a vision of beyond that curtain of time. And from that star he never was the same. He looked into eternity and he saw me in a perfect body and with all my heart, his word I believed that he saw me. He saw me. My eyes [singing] were glowing. My hair was blowing in that eternal breeze in the realm of the redeemed. In my [singing] perfect body, he saw me and they came running. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; in the beauty of eternal youth. And they [singing and music] were crying our precious brother in garments of snowy white and ice that sparkle like a star on a darkest night. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; They were [singing] trophies of his ministries. And I [singing] believe one of them was me. He saw me. He saw me. [singing] My eyes were glowing.

[applause] Hallelujah, brother Ricardo. I truly enjoyed your testimony. You know, as a believer, the Bible means something to us. Maybe to somebody else is, "Oh, I just lost a book. I can go get another one." But to us, it's more than a book. And you just think about it. If God cares about that, how much more for the greater things that you have? for he's not just [music] the God of the book, but he's the God that wants to live in you.

[music] &gt;&gt; That's what we're living for. [music] &gt;&gt; We're not living for here. Won't last. Like our brother preached. This breath won't last. [music] It's that eternal breath that lasts. I tell you, every time I hear the brothers and sisters saying, my soul just bubbles over. Brother Jerome, the angels in heaven were [music] swaying to the the the sound of that song. Brother, it touched something down inside of me. How did I ever make it over? I don't know. But he promised it and he keeps his promise. That's all I know. And it's just so wonderful. Uh all the singing and little David singing and brother Neville, you know, we've got uh we we've we've got one day brother uh Neville and brother Brandham will sing a song for us because we got brother Neville in our church. We got brother Brandham in our church. We've got John the Baptist in our church. We got John the Divine in our church. You You know what I mean? I I I think that the heavens and earth have come together just like he promised. A Amen. Amen. I just God so good. And if you didn't get a chance to sing tonight, would you please bring your specials on services on Sunday? And uh I thought in my heart, I enjoyed this so much. We're going to have to have a Saturday afternoon barbecue and then come in church and just sing. This this is glorious, church. This is the Holy Spirit. This is what it's like to feel the love of God just just came. Amen. It it's it's just wonderful. I got to thinking [music] I was looking at brother Sing and I thought you know you got to sing a song for us in Indian some or Hindu or or whatever it is like they ask brother Ben do you speak African? you know, I don't know, there's 20,000 different dialects, but I I just love it when you hear somebody sing in a foreign language and then you know that for them to sing that, they had to touch the same God you did. &gt;&gt; And that means that there's hungry hearts all over the world &gt;&gt; that Jesus wants to touch and [music] share, you know. Uh Matthew went to India and [music] and and sat down with over 40 or 50 Pentecostal ministers and he shared the gospel with them. He shared the godhead with them and he baptized 40 [music] Pentecostal ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Just think of that. There's hungry hearts, church. And if you could take this joy and this gift of God because he said it's been freely given to you. Freely given. You know, I I know when you meet somebody, it looks like that, you know, that got big spirits on them. Yeah, they got spirits on them. They they got devils on them. Yes, they have devils on them. They're in terrible shape. But I know of somebody else that was in terrible shape. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And just some guy out of spite looked at me and said, "Why don't you read your Bible? I was down. I was suicidal. I drugs were starting to take their [music] effect on me." And and I I just and he said, "Why don't you just read your Bible?" You know, that stuck with me somehow. And I went and ran read Romans chapter 1. And the God of glory come down and met me on a rooftop. It's freely given. Let's freely [music] give. the the country is starving to be in this kind of atmosphere. [music] They're starving to have somebody tell them you never did it in the first place. You were just trapped in this body by a lie. And now you can come out of that lie with the truth. And the truth is what sets you free. I like the way Paul put it. I'm not ashamed of the gospel because the glory of God unto salvation. And [music] the our Lord put it to us this way. He said, "If you're ashamed of me in this life, I'll be ashamed of you in the other." So let's let's share with what we've got tonight, church. This has been a wonderful weekend. It's been um it's just been such a sweet time in the presence of the Lord and [music] and would just close in prayer but let's don't lose this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know if song brought it, song can restore it. &gt;&gt; If the word brought it, the word can restore it. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So if your tank starts getting empty, grab a song, grab a [music] tune, and put a melody on your heart and lift yourself back up into the presence of the [music] Lord. Grab your Bible and read it and lift yourself back up in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Manassa, it's nice to have you with us. And I is Zire there? I don't I guess. All right. She's hidden back there. [music] Nice to have her with us. Also, uh, Brother Manass, he serves our country. He's, uh, [music] in the United States Marine Corps. You know, he he's far part of the few and the proud, the Marines. We appreciate that, brother. Thank you for your service. Our prophet wanted to be a soldier. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you so much. May the Lord keep you safe. Amen. Let's all be soldiers. &gt;&gt; He's protecting us. Let's be soldiers for the cross and pray for him. As we bow our heads, let's bow our heads in prayer. Our gracious father, Lord, you know how my heart is swelled with love. Father, hearing these children sing just not even 10 years old and they're singing the glory of God and and these little groups that were put together, Father, people just got together because they loved you and they wanted to worship you and they [music] practiced in fellowship together and they sang praise to your name. And Father, I know there's not one thing that any man ever does for you that goes unrewarded. Father, I ask you to pour out the blessings of reward in their life. May they feel you close by and may they just be so full of joy and peace and longsuffering. Father, I just ask that you would grant that to all our musicians who labor. Father, the deacons and the trustees and all the hidden parts that go on that nobody notices. Father, our Sunday school teachers, Brother Tim, and all that they do. Father, we just pray with all our hearts. Father, we've asked for a path forward, and I believe you've showed us a path forward. Now, Father, lead us in that path &gt;&gt; with the right spirit, the right motive, and the right objective. And Father, may we take this light and set it on a hill. May our good works, Father, glorify you. And father, may we tell others about all that you've done. We commit it all into your hands. Father, bless our visitors. Father, our ministers that came and preached for us. Father, may they go home with a promise in their heart that whatever that they ask that you'll grant it. We ask those [music] things for their effort. Be with us now, Father. Guide us in the future. And we just trust that you'll look upon us kindly and full of mercy. And as Peter said, Lord, you know all things. [music] You know that we love you. We thank you. Amen. Is that nothing but his presence? [music] There's some leftover desserts and rolls in the fellowship off the Oh, okay. Good. Here's the announcement you've all been waiting for.

You there there Miles is taking off right now. He said it's it's first come first serve. He said, "I have my eye on something." Amen. All right. Save me a bite, Miles. All righty. God bless you. You love the Lord. Let's sing it. There's nothing like his presence. Thank you for coming. You are dismissed. Grab a dessert and be happy. Amen. Oh, there's nothing like the presence. &gt;&gt; Nothing like [singing] the presence. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like [music] the presence of the Lord. There's nothing like [singing] the presence. [music] Nothing like the presence. There's nothing [singing and music] like the presence of the Lord. Oh, [singing] I am [music] free in his presence.
