[30:40] the creator of heavens and earth
[30:42] lord when
[30:44] all of this was even framed it was with
[30:47] an intent that you would
[30:49] have a people who'd come to know who you
[30:51] are
[30:52] your attributes
[30:54] lord and when we look at the body it's
[30:56] we were to discern it to have your mind
[30:59] that would go and search out the things
[31:01] there's
[31:02] many would have desired to be in this
[31:04] house tonight
[31:06] lord but there's things that kept them
[31:08] from being in
[31:09] fellowship and
[31:10] your heart's desire was to have
[31:12] fellowship with your children
[31:15] lord you
[31:16] truly made a way we look to calvary and
[31:19] we see a finished work
[31:21] we see a price that's been paid

[31:41] tonight
[31:42] you promised that we could come in to
[31:44] one mind and
[31:46] we could have the things we would ask
[31:48] for if you would agree
[31:50] lord we ask
[31:52] that you would be glorified that the
[31:53] needs would be met that those looking
[31:56] for a way to be in your house would find
[31:58] that they would be in fellowship once
[32:00] again
[32:01] lord as we partake in communion and foot
[32:03] washing that your presence would move in
[32:06] a sweet way

[41:54] went to calvary
[41:58] without sin in your life without spot

[42:10] and yet father with us
[42:14] in you
[42:16] us on your mind
[42:19] you went and paid such a wonderful price
[42:24] that when

[42:30] forgiven
[42:32] and resurrected
[42:34] and share yourself with us
[42:37] oh god it's
[42:41] in my heart i just
[42:43] overwhelms me that
[42:46] you picked me father

[42:51] same way
[42:52] father you chose me
[42:54] out of all the
[42:57] worthy people
[43:00] you pick the most unworthy
[43:03] and lord we just
[43:05] want to always thank you for that
[43:08] bless each of your children this evening

[55:24] let's start from verse five
[55:39] [Music]
[55:45] i told the pastor

[55:57] parking lot yeah
[56:00] there's a brother who told me man first

[56:06] driving a little fast
[56:08] fared away i said yes brother man
[56:14] i said it was just god because i could
[56:16] have made i could have been here
[56:19] and i was praying to god poor police
[56:24] that the police may not stop me
[56:27] [Music]
[56:28] alive because i had two choices either
[56:31] show up late
[56:33] by the police or to be started by the
[56:35] cops measured to radiate the two i said
[56:38] you're a god of all things
[56:40] you're a god of time
[56:47] if there are people that have to obey
[56:49] the law the first ones are christians
[56:55] i have to read
[57:10] [Music]
[57:14] this is then is the message which we
[57:16] have heard from him and declared unto
[57:18] you that god is light and in him there's
[57:22] no darkness at all
[57:23] sino di nusam
[57:31] [Music]
[57:38] if we say we have fellowship with him
[57:42] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[57:46] we lie and do not the truth
[58:06] but if we walk in like in the light as
[58:09] he is in the light we have fellowship
[58:11] one with another and the blood of jesus
[58:14] christ his son cleanses us from from all
[58:17] from all sin
[58:19] let's pray
[58:33] and everyone that's gathered here
[58:35] tonight you know
[58:36] they know they don't need a man
[58:41] they need you yourself the lord the holy
[58:44] spirit
[58:49] they want is see your face they want to
[58:51] see you come and speak to them
[58:55] in that manner lord i put myself aside
[59:00] and i invite the power of the holy
[59:09] [Music]
[59:13] yourself you the holy spirit that you
[59:15] may dwell in me and speak to your
[59:21] i pray in the name of the lord jesus
[59:23] christ our lord amen
[59:26] you may have your seeds
[59:39] [Music]
[59:43] it's been a while that it fits a while
[59:45] that you haven't uh spoken to the people
[59:49] let me see
[59:52] ministers knows what i'm about to say
[59:59] we have our confidence in one thing
[1:00:01] alone
[1:00:02] say
[1:00:03] jesus
[1:00:04] and that's in jesus jesus himself
[1:00:08] because when we are here
[1:00:12] we have
[1:00:41] i felt like
[1:00:42] we could have just continued tonight
[1:00:44] because we were in the same spirit he
[1:00:46] could have just carried on
[1:00:48] amen amen
[1:00:56] what i'm saying has to be israel because
[1:00:59] i know everything we see here at the
[1:01:01] pulpit will be asked of us one day
[1:01:15] we could say a lot of things but
[1:01:17] that's why it's important that we we
[1:01:20] we cling to the word because one day
[1:01:23] they will be asked and say brother
[1:01:25] samuel you said such
[1:01:28] giant predication i heard the preaching
[1:01:32] and the teaching
[1:01:38] i i said i felt that was the same thing
[1:01:40] that was in my heart
[1:01:42] because when the pastor comes in
[1:01:45] when he asked me to pray
[1:01:47] i was asking myself what am i going to
[1:01:49] say
[1:02:16] i want to speak on uh recognizing what
[1:02:19] god has done for us
[1:02:20] amen amen
[1:02:27] recognizing it means when someone has
[1:02:29] done something for you
[1:03:01] jesus has done something of ver of of
[1:03:04] great value it's done something of great
[1:03:06] value for us
[1:03:09] as we read the bible
[1:03:13] and as we know we are christians the
[1:03:14] appellate command since the beginning
[1:03:18] god created a man
[1:03:20] he created
[1:03:28] feminine because adam had both the male
[1:03:30] and this uh the female spirit hallelujah
[1:03:32] hallelujah
[1:03:35] and then there came a time where god
[1:03:37] separated them
[1:03:43] and we saw there was a time where adam
[1:03:45] was in the divine presence of god
[1:03:52] every whatever adam could speak all of
[1:03:54] it was the word
[1:04:11] wicked one came
[1:04:14] amen amen
[1:04:20] and and men fall from there
[1:04:23] me
[1:04:25] but because god and you is god
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:30] and he wanted fellowship with man
[1:04:36] in this plane there was something that
[1:04:37] was set aside
[1:04:41] god did something for us
[1:04:49] in other words i don't want to say he
[1:04:50] did something but he revealed what he
[1:04:53] did what he had in mind for us
[1:04:58] because the scripture tells us before
[1:05:00] there is death
[1:05:03] the resurrection was already there
[1:05:06] before there
[1:05:20] and death came into man
[1:05:23] but what god did at that time
[1:05:25] he revealed
[1:05:27] his plan eternal eternal life
[1:05:30] to man
[1:05:32] he said man
[1:05:34] this was my plan
[1:05:36] amen amen
[1:05:39] god did something for you
[1:05:42] that's why when you walk young
[1:05:47] people has to notice that you have
[1:05:49] received something from god
[1:05:52] amen amen
[1:05:58] we can't even say much because we have
[1:06:00] the prophet of the hour who's told us
[1:06:02] all these things
[1:06:09] anything that's outside of the prophet
[1:06:11] of the hour that's the devil amen amen
[1:06:27] i want to read the communion
[1:06:41] communion by the reconciliation of the
[1:06:44] blood it was preached on may may 5th
[1:06:49] 19 and 55. it's amazing
[1:06:52] amen okay
[1:07:24] um
[1:07:35] yeah yeah
[1:07:36] yeah no it's fellowship through the
[1:07:38] blood sorry
[1:07:39] yeah yeah yeah i found that yeah
[1:07:44] uh
[1:07:45] paragraph tense
[1:07:47] paragraph 15.
[1:08:47] amen now fellowship men i says felt now
[1:08:51] fellowship man wants the greatest
[1:08:53] fellowship that men could ever have is
[1:08:56] fellowship with christ
[1:08:58] i love to meet man
[1:09:00] man
[1:09:01] we all love to fellowship with uh
[1:09:04] to fellowship with all one another
[1:09:07] sometimes we go out to have a bike to
[1:09:09] eat neighbor neighbor woman talked
[1:09:12] across the fence coming around having a
[1:09:15] little parties it says where they meet
[1:09:17] together fellowship amen amen
[1:09:24] man because there's something within
[1:09:25] them about fellowship
[1:09:30] everything that we are doing is based on
[1:09:32] what was at the
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:57] because within men there's something
[1:09:59] about fellowship amen amen
[1:10:04] but the the fellowship that god is
[1:10:06] asking
[1:10:10] is not the communion within or the
[1:10:12] fellowship between men and men
[1:10:29] is when it's in the presence is it says
[1:10:31] is in the presence of of the mighty god
[1:10:38] no fellowship could take its place
[1:11:08] when man is under the leadership of his
[1:11:10] own lord
[1:11:12] the lord jesus amen amen
[1:11:19] when man is in fellowship with god
[1:11:24] it
[1:11:36] but you are not in fellowship with your
[1:11:38] god almighty
[1:11:41] there's going to be something missing
[1:11:44] but when you have fellowship with god
[1:11:48] you are in the complete in the security
[1:11:50] complete security
[1:12:14] at one time man had perfect fellowship
[1:12:16] with god that was god's purpose that's
[1:12:19] the reason it craves the that's the
[1:12:22] reason it's a crave in your heart is the
[1:12:25] longing for something
[1:12:27] a contact
[1:12:32] if we try to have fellowship separate
[1:12:48] he made it so that there will be
[1:12:50] communion between the creator and the
[1:12:52] one he created
[1:12:57] and when you are in the perfect
[1:12:59] fellowship
[1:13:15] let's go to verse 17.
[1:13:29] separate
[1:14:11] but then when a man began to sin he
[1:14:14] separated himself from his fellowship
[1:14:16] with his maker sin is what separated him
[1:14:20] as that as that's the truth which we
[1:14:22] believe it is the bible only speaks the
[1:14:25] truth and if that's the truth
[1:14:28] then if there is some separa there is
[1:14:30] some separation made for sin then man
[1:14:34] through the preparation
[1:14:37] can come back in perfection fellowship
[1:14:40] and harmony with his maker again you
[1:14:43] believe it that's right can he says we
[1:14:46] can only find the way that's when we
[1:14:49] want to find the remedy
[1:14:52] amen
[1:15:14] we cannot just go and say well when men
[1:15:17] fall when men fail this happened no we
[1:15:19] have to go back to the plan of god
[1:15:21] because that's where we rip the benefits
[1:15:31] let's go to
[1:15:32] paragraph 19.
[1:15:36] japan
[1:15:59] i think that adam and eve was the most
[1:16:01] perfect couple that ever walked on the
[1:16:03] earth i can see adam
[1:16:06] in his
[1:16:07] not a great shoulders like
[1:16:09] like some barn doors but a perfect built
[1:16:13] man
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:52] [Music]
[1:17:28] amen it said
[1:17:36] eve
[1:17:36] beautiful i can see her now
[1:17:39] as she she woke up after the operation
[1:17:43] from adam and she looked a and and he
[1:17:47] looked at her her beautiful hair hanging
[1:17:50] down her back her eyes sparkling like
[1:17:54] the stars about
[1:17:55] adam touching her by the
[1:17:58] flesh and said she's flesh of my flesh
[1:18:01] and born of my born beautiful
[1:18:04] never to fade out
[1:18:06] those lips
[1:18:07] they wouldn't
[1:18:09] they wouldn't have
[1:18:10] they wouldn't have to use uh this here
[1:18:13] manicure or or what what the what the
[1:18:17] stuff you put on uh on your face now to
[1:18:20] make themselves uh look pretty it says
[1:18:23] sync synth caused you to do that
[1:18:26] god made it perfect
[1:18:29] amen amen
[1:18:34] adam and eve was in perfect fellowship
[1:18:36] with god
[1:18:39] they were all beautiful you know they
[1:18:40] published one they say
[1:18:42] they didn't need manicure to paint their
[1:18:44] faces
[1:18:51] they didn't need to put things on their
[1:18:52] lips so the husband can find them
[1:18:54] attractive
[1:18:57] the beauty that we have when we are in
[1:18:59] fellowship with christ
[1:19:04] the natural beauty that we have when we
[1:19:06] are in fellowship
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:37] pal uh you may be pale amen amen
[1:19:45] if you feel my face i shouldn't look
[1:19:47] attractive in all those things
[1:19:54] and i can speak to that to the our
[1:19:56] sisters or to the young lady and sisters
[1:19:59] because they are the type of the church
[1:20:01] amen amen
[1:20:14] is the one who tries to look beautiful
[1:20:16] to him it's the church
[1:20:20] who's the bride of christ
[1:20:26] the church wants to look pretty in
[1:20:28] memphis
[1:20:30] but god tells
[1:21:06] the word of god is it's not the printing
[1:21:09] oh the word of god is whatever you put
[1:21:12] on your face it's the redemption
[1:21:18] the painting is the word of god
[1:21:22] if you want to put the red sticks the
[1:21:24] lipstick on your lips
[1:21:39] when you come before christ
[1:21:41] he looks at you seriously from my it
[1:21:43] says oh she's really pretty basically
[1:21:46] why because before god
[1:21:48] man
[1:21:49] and women
[1:21:51] we are all women
[1:21:54] because we have one husband who is
[1:21:56] christian amen
[1:22:01] amen amen
[1:22:06] and today we find there's so much
[1:22:08] trouble in the church the problem is and
[1:22:10] what is the problem
[1:22:13] people take a lot of makeups
[1:22:17] instead of taking the word of god
[1:22:20] and to use it
[1:22:51] the fifa parallel delay to live the word
[1:22:54] of god the the word of the hour
[1:22:57] amen amen
[1:23:02] and the word of the hour
[1:23:18] our
[1:23:45] amen amen
[1:23:49] just excuse me i'll just speak the word
[1:23:50] of god
[1:23:54] the word tells us
[1:23:58] if you want another husband
[1:24:18] that's the that's the the the
[1:24:20] characteristics of the husband
[1:24:22] amen amen amen amen
[1:24:26] and as the woman
[1:24:43] because the bride has to have the
[1:24:45] characteristics of of jesus
[1:24:49] and the characteristics of jesus
[1:24:53] because in the beginning
[1:24:55] the word was with god and the word was
[1:24:58] god
[1:25:03] amen amen
[1:25:08] sometimes
[1:25:11] we ask in the church
[1:25:15] why don't we see that
[1:25:17] why don't we see that
[1:25:19] what's the problem the problem say my
[1:25:21] man the problem is me
[1:25:35] the problem is not the pastor the
[1:25:37] problem is not the pulpit the problem is
[1:25:39] me
[1:25:40] hallelujah amen
[1:25:44] why is why am i not seeing this
[1:25:48] is it written in the word of god
[1:25:50] why am i not seeing this
[1:26:06] is in line with
[1:26:17] the world came with a manifestation of
[1:26:20] the power of god
[1:26:34] let there not be snow anything
[1:26:36] hallelujah amen you're not manifest
[1:26:39] there will be a manifestation focus
[1:26:41] why because you have the word
[1:26:44] the word tells us
[1:26:47] that the word of man
[1:27:02] everything that we
[1:27:16] it
[1:27:26] this is a local church so i feel i feel
[1:27:29] like liberty
[1:27:38] where you can speak
[1:27:39] freely is at home
[1:27:42] hallelujah amen
[1:28:25] that god made a place where people were
[1:28:28] gathered
[1:28:30] that's why when we build the church
[1:28:36] oh that's why the church is dedicated
[1:28:38] when it's built
[1:28:54] we're going to come meet together
[1:28:59] it's a place where we're going to come
[1:29:00] and meet with god
[1:29:05] amen amen
[1:29:10] and do we believe god will speak in vain
[1:29:13] no no right
[1:29:16] when god speaks
[1:29:18] he speaks
[1:29:22] the problem is us man or not even by
[1:29:24] ourselves
[1:29:25] we we we come to a place where we can't
[1:29:28] receive a monster and eat
[1:29:32] at transformative
[1:29:34] and transform our lives
[1:30:02] book of life before the foundation of
[1:30:04] the world
[1:30:12] who takes care of everything it's not me
[1:30:16] my friend brother to you are you no
[1:30:18] responsibility
[1:30:27] revelation book of symbols
[1:30:45] paragraph 20.
[1:31:06] sometimes you may have a thought leaning
[1:31:08] towards election
[1:31:11] amen amen
[1:31:14] it's good that we are here by election
[1:31:17] day
[1:31:20] it's because god elected us that's why
[1:31:22] we are here
[1:31:26] but it doesn't mean because we're
[1:31:28] elected we can do whatever we need we
[1:31:30] want to
[1:31:33] amen amen
[1:31:40] and that's the reason why
[1:31:47] that's why i turn away this morning for
[1:31:49] prayer
[1:31:51] because this time you see here jeffrey
[1:31:57] i'm hitting really hard on the election
[1:32:08] and i feel like i need to get away from
[1:32:11] it for a little bit
[1:32:14] because you would think
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:38] we
[1:32:44] and i want to get away from it for a
[1:32:46] little bit because one would say brother
[1:32:48] branham uh the election it says yes he
[1:32:52] god calls by election
[1:32:56] yes
[1:33:01] i can do what pleases me
[1:33:06] yes
[1:33:34] it doesn't mean election at all
[1:33:37] amen amen
[1:33:45] please
[1:33:52] that means you were not even elected to
[1:33:55] begin with
[1:33:56] amen amen
[1:34:00] if you stay at home because you are
[1:34:02] elected
[1:34:30] because
[1:34:40] i never seen someone who gives you money
[1:34:42] hallelujah
[1:34:57] to open the door yeah lord i'm
[1:34:59] definitely and to go and meet the person
[1:35:02] because you know it's money
[1:35:05] but that money is nothing
[1:35:08] the word tells us jesus jesus christ
[1:35:11] who came to die for us you know
[1:35:14] he didn't have a reason to die
[1:35:19] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:23] it's by his law didn't know he says no
[1:35:26] come on
[1:36:08] the
[1:36:21] when the word tells us that we are
[1:36:23] redeemed by the blood palestine
[1:36:26] it's not the physical blood
[1:36:29] it's not the chemicals
[1:36:31] that's the word of the hour
[1:36:34] heaven amen
[1:37:02] hallelujah
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:14] to stay at
[1:37:18] home the day that we have services
[1:37:25] is against the word of god
[1:37:28] amen amen
[1:37:31] i'm going to read
[1:37:49] and in fact you would think about god
[1:37:52] how that he loved you when you were
[1:37:54] unlovable
[1:37:56] amen amen
[1:38:02] god loved us when we were unlovable
[1:38:10] but god came and said no
[1:38:13] feast it's my son so when he pulls it's
[1:38:17] my bride
[1:38:20] i'm going to come and die for her
[1:38:22] and the word reveals to us
[1:38:25] what that grace
[1:38:28] that we have today
[1:38:31] it's without money without anything to
[1:38:33] be bought with
[1:38:36] unto them
[1:38:38] they're not asking you to pay money to
[1:38:40] the pastor they don't know that
[1:38:42] you don't have to pay
[1:38:45] it's just to accept the word of god
[1:39:04] and before you have anything to do with
[1:39:06] it
[1:39:09] he chose you
[1:39:10] come
[1:39:28] it seems like it brings it takes the
[1:39:30] election so high so that
[1:39:34] is
[1:39:52] to think that when i was unlovable
[1:39:56] he loved me
[1:40:06] to think that when there was nothing i
[1:40:07] could do
[1:40:09] ilma pre
[1:40:10] ill mass of it
[1:40:12] he took me and he saved me parsagras by
[1:40:15] his grace
[1:40:19] recognizable
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:23] i surely should should be grateful
[1:40:25] enough to serve him and to love him
[1:40:29] amen amen
[1:40:37] if we can really feel within ourselves
[1:40:39] to know that it's truly by election we
[1:40:42] were elected and chosen
[1:40:47] and if god came and came and gave us
[1:40:49] this privilege that we have
[1:40:54] we have to serve it we have to serve him
[1:40:56] even more
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:30] oh
[1:41:45] uh fellowship
[1:41:47] fellowship through the uh
[1:41:49] redemption fellowship by redemption
[1:42:07] event
[1:42:26] okay
[1:42:51] now when god had them in his presence in
[1:42:55] his perfect control they walked with him
[1:42:58] and talked with him in the garden but as
[1:43:01] as soon as he lost his fellowship with
[1:43:04] god he became a wanderer wandering
[1:43:07] around no place to go tossed about
[1:43:09] that's the way man has become today
[1:43:28] here it is now listen when a man comes
[1:43:31] out of fellowship with god he becomes a
[1:43:34] wanderer
[1:43:35] he he
[1:43:36] going about joining one church and
[1:43:39] leaving to another joining another it
[1:43:41] don't satisfy him here
[1:43:44] he goes he goes over to the uh
[1:43:49] amen
[1:43:50] amen
[1:44:17] but what happened over there ah no young
[1:44:19] flirty mafia
[1:44:21] oh there's a brother who did this this
[1:44:22] this to me
[1:44:30] in the through the past satisfaction you
[1:44:32] see he won't find satisfaction here he
[1:44:34] virtually methodists he will go to the
[1:44:36] methodist methodist university baptist
[1:44:39] and the from the methodist he goes to
[1:44:41] the baptism
[1:44:43] and then he will go to the pentecostal
[1:44:45] to the pilgrimage
[1:44:46] the
[1:44:55] because he's lost fellowship fellowship
[1:44:58] with god
[1:45:14] but
[1:45:45] they take the word to preach to
[1:45:47] themselves
[1:45:49] in instead of preaching jesus
[1:45:52] amen but they're preaching themselves
[1:45:54] they're preaching for them
[1:46:08] you lost a fellowship
[1:46:12] i kill a problem whose problem is that
[1:46:17] i kill a problem whose problem is that
[1:46:24] symbol is
[1:46:34] maybe the maybe you'll maybe you'll just
[1:46:37] find
[1:46:38] the pathetic
[1:46:40] the problem is probably you
[1:46:44] amen
[1:46:45] maybe it's you he says
[1:46:52] you refuse the church here
[1:46:55] and then you go to another church
[1:46:58] and then the other time in another
[1:46:59] church
[1:47:00] and then in another church no what a
[1:47:02] problem where's the problem
[1:47:04] the answer the prophecy is giving
[1:47:21] just find fellowship and anywhere is
[1:47:24] home sweet home
[1:47:30] you find you'll find a
[1:47:33] a
[1:47:34] people at east where the word is not
[1:47:35] telling you the truth
[1:47:39] when the word touches your life
[1:47:43] oh i'm not going there anymore
[1:48:07] they call you you stop the preaching and
[1:48:09] you pick up your phone
[1:48:16] brother
[1:48:29] it was the place where people were
[1:48:31] supposed to come to resolve the problems
[1:48:46] was a place where man when there's
[1:48:47] conflict within the heart and they're
[1:48:49] not feeling themselves when they come
[1:48:51] they then and they come in and god
[1:48:53] speaks to them through the word
[1:48:59] but today the church celebrates
[1:49:02] it's a it's a place where everybody is
[1:49:04] running away from
[1:49:07] me
[1:49:08] there's something that's not right
[1:49:18] i'm
[1:49:20] trying to be mindful of time
[1:49:25] ventura
[1:49:30] paragraph
[1:49:32] 23.
[1:49:49] went through one
[1:50:13] let's move to 20
[1:50:15] 25.
[1:50:21] we have a
[1:50:29] i used to go to a place an old methodist
[1:50:32] preacher
[1:50:35] empathic antique he used to sing a
[1:50:37] little song
[1:50:39] the old brother
[1:50:41] back home he said
[1:50:43] he said
[1:50:47] we let down the bars
[1:50:51] we let down the bars
[1:50:55] we compromised with sin
[1:50:59] we let down the bars
[1:51:02] the ship got out
[1:51:18] is
[1:51:46] teaching back to the old hewing line of
[1:51:49] the shed
[1:51:57] god laid out of the world a map for the
[1:51:59] for the human family to go back home
[1:52:05] it was through the reconciliation of the
[1:52:07] blood
[1:52:10] he's never changed from that from the
[1:52:12] from that day to to this certain days
[1:52:28] that doesn't mean that much to god
[1:52:31] you got to be born again
[1:52:38] you've got to come and recognize the
[1:52:40] blood
[1:52:42] that was shared for you
[1:52:45] and you are dead to yourself
[1:52:47] to the things of the world
[1:52:51] and born anew in christ jesus
[1:52:54] by the washing
[1:52:57] and the renewing bagless by the blood
[1:52:59] amen amen
[1:53:02] pretty straight my friend but brother
[1:53:05] celebrity it's the truth seneca
[1:53:07] please it's not for the church
[1:53:10] the old fashioned
[1:53:23] hallelujah
[1:53:33] people all the people are interested is
[1:53:35] oh it's i
[1:53:37] i i'm the predecessor of brother branham
[1:53:42] oh we received the message
[1:53:45] oh we did this and we're done
[1:53:48] what is the message doing in you
[1:53:52] what is justifying the fact that you
[1:53:54] received the message
[1:54:03] hallelujah
[1:54:29] the 20
[1:54:30] 20
[1:54:32] 23rd
[1:54:34] paragraph
[1:54:46] when they had realized that they had
[1:54:48] sinned
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:55:14] and throw back the skin to adam and eve
[1:55:19] they cover themselves with the scheme
[1:55:23] and stood in the presence of god
[1:55:28] and to receive to receive the judgment
[1:55:31] and the eternal
[1:55:32] destination
[1:55:43] could not couldn't stand no
[1:56:10] and that's the same covering today
[1:56:16] i'm afraid that the full gospel people
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:25] are getting a little far off the track
[1:56:28] now
[1:56:30] when you leave that out
[1:56:32] come back
[1:56:34] years ago
[1:56:56] is an old-fashioned simple revival
[1:57:06] and the old-fashioned paul's revival in
[1:57:09] the bible holy spirit preached back in
[1:57:11] the church with the old time conviction
[1:57:18] yes
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:24] men and women coming back to the lord
[1:57:27] through the shed blood
[1:57:29] reconciliation a reconciliation
[1:57:32] reconnaissance
[1:57:34] wrecking themselves dead in your
[1:57:50] if people can recognize the evangelist
[1:57:53] when the the gospel is preached
[1:57:57] if the gospel preached at the old time
[1:57:59] revival
[1:58:01] eventually when we preached the gospel
[1:58:03] if oppression left until it's preached
[1:58:05] the god it's the gospel that's being
[1:58:06] praised el is pre-delivered with the
[1:58:09] spirit of the of the gospel
[1:58:14] because the word is being preached in
[1:58:16] the innocence
[1:58:20] you can preach outside of the spirit of
[1:58:22] that word
[1:58:26] and you take it as a revelation
[1:58:30] it's not a true revelation
[1:58:47] you have god in totality
[1:58:52] amen amen
[1:59:13] fellowship with god
[1:59:21] paragraph 49
[1:59:23] yeah
[1:59:24] for the colonists
[1:59:41] foreign
[2:00:32] but when a man correctly one time
[2:00:35] comes in and lays his hands upon the
[2:00:38] head by faith the lord jesus christ
[2:00:42] and confesses his sin
[2:00:44] then
[2:00:45] the blood of jesus christ
[2:00:47] the life of the what the life that was
[2:00:50] that was in him
[2:00:52] that was the life that was in
[2:00:54] that was god that was god
[2:00:57] himself
[2:00:58] and that man the life that returns to
[2:01:01] that man after he has confessed their
[2:01:04] sins and accepted
[2:01:07] christ he is brought into a relationship
[2:01:10] with christ
[2:01:11] by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[2:01:14] there is no moral desire in his heart to
[2:01:17] sin amen
[2:01:21] that's why that's the reason hebrew 10
[2:01:24] says
[2:01:26] for the worshiper once purged
[2:01:34] the worshiper once purged
[2:01:39] has no more conscience of sins
[2:01:40] consciousness of sins
[2:01:44] there you have fellowship
[2:01:48] the things of the world is dead
[2:01:51] you don't recognize it no more
[2:01:57] you recognize yourself
[2:02:02] and your life is hid in god through
[2:02:04] christ celebration sealed by the holy
[2:02:07] spirit
[2:02:10] and then you look to the things to you
[2:02:13] and you are looking to the heavenly
[2:02:16] things other
[2:02:22] you couldn't hardly sit in the church 10
[2:02:25] minutes
[2:02:29] sometimes you could only stay not more
[2:02:31] than 10 minutes in the church
[2:02:36] but when you really got the holy spirit
[2:02:41] you can sit in the church day and night
[2:02:44] basketball
[2:02:58] people always there's premonday i was
[2:03:01] the people has worldly spirit elephant

[2:05:05] and find a bride for isaac

[2:06:01] that he may be the one who's going to
[2:06:03] feed all the camels
[2:06:06] emma amen
[2:06:08] that's what he asked
[2:06:11] and when he went
[2:06:13] lafayette rebecca evan rebecca
[2:06:22] she came and she she she gave water to
[2:06:24] all the cameras

[2:06:56] the
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:31] to the children of israel
[2:07:33] they have everything
[2:07:35] they had a prophet
[2:08:06] and
[2:08:49] i'm not saying the rapture has already
[2:08:51] happened
[2:08:53] amen amen
[2:08:55] but the word tells us
[2:09:00] it was preached to us the other time
[2:09:03] there's three phases to the rapture
[2:09:06] yeah there's the there's the shout of
[2:09:08] the god
[2:09:10] of what i'm talking about
[2:09:13] it's the shout that's going forth and
[2:09:15] that's the preaching
[2:09:31] you are coming forward spiritually
[2:09:37] and it will be very easy to the pastor
[2:09:39] they didn't know of analysis to say oh
[2:09:41] come to church memphis
[2:09:44] even if there is corona we don't know
[2:09:46] i'll say no basket
[2:09:48] because there's a man of god speaking
[2:09:51] i will have to go
[2:09:56] let's move
[2:09:57] i'll tell you something
[2:10:11] that's why the prophet even preached to
[2:10:13] us the respect to the
[2:10:15] servants of god
[2:10:20] when a servant of god says something
[2:10:22] amen amen
[2:10:26] in fact if it's your pastor
[2:10:32] and
[2:10:33] you you are called to believe it
[2:10:37] amen amen
[2:10:53] i didn't say that
[2:11:08] whom god
[2:11:35] she was very kind
[2:11:38] she was happy
[2:11:40] i'm going to go meet my sister
[2:11:42] i'm going to go meet my brother
[2:11:45] and when we come to church
[2:11:49] in you there has to be a spirit of joy
[2:11:56] there it has to be a cry within you amen
[2:12:01] i need something ship is where they need
[2:12:03] something
[2:12:04] i need something
[2:12:10] and that thing that you need is nothing
[2:12:12] but the word
[2:12:17] that's why the word
[2:12:18] the church
[2:12:29] [Music]
[2:12:33] the the camels
[2:12:40] it was the camel that transported her to
[2:12:42] meet gome and meet their husband
[2:12:46] the word of god that we are serving
[2:12:52] it's the same god the same word that
[2:12:54] brings us in the presence of god
[2:12:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:58] jesus
[2:13:00] i chose to be
[2:13:02] a little bit longer yeah
[2:13:08] i know it's not my nature but i hope you
[2:13:10] understand
[2:13:13] just to
[2:13:14] wanted to make sure that i it's
[2:13:15] understood
[2:13:21] the pastor told me that this was
[2:13:22] communion right so i'm going to stop
[2:13:24] here i'm going to read this and stop
[2:13:28] why are we not a denomination
[2:13:31] um
[2:13:31] countries yeah i preached in 1958
[2:13:36] september 27th 11th
[2:13:47] excuse me if i'm a little bit long
[2:14:12] we can say
[2:14:13] why we are not taking communion
[2:14:17] we can say why we are taking communion
[2:14:23] we'll tell you why we take
[2:14:25] feet washing
[2:14:33] why we won't let the members take take
[2:14:36] it
[2:14:52] i've been going from one member to
[2:14:54] another
[2:14:56] vusave
[2:15:00] yeah
[2:15:01] where you've been having little faces
[2:15:04] jesus
[2:15:32] you that has taken the blessed cup of
[2:15:35] god what they see they said hotels
[2:15:37] across this altar
[2:15:43] you that are called brothers and sisters
[2:15:49] and then go on and take the telephone
[2:15:52] echo
[2:15:55] and get off about one another
[2:16:01] you are not fit to be called christian
[2:16:06] when you are when you are that way
[2:16:08] certainly right
[2:16:11] right
[2:16:12] the telephone you keep off them
[2:16:14] telephones
[2:16:29] god is going to hold you responsible
[2:16:36] as long as that kind of spirit is in you
[2:16:40] you you know
[2:16:56] if a man is wrong i'll ever go
[2:17:13] so negligence no wonder god can't
[2:17:15] discipline his church
[2:17:20] because you are not doing it right
[2:17:24] instead of getting on the television
[2:17:28] and talking about this one
[2:17:33] the group is still a dot
[2:17:37] and what taken place and little cult and
[2:17:40] so forth
[2:17:42] around like that
[2:17:48] instead of doing that why don't you do
[2:17:50] what the bible says see unfair ayat
[2:17:52] april unfortunately if a brother has
[2:17:54] been overtaken
[2:18:08] he did me
[2:18:10] i don't care what he did i let go to him
[2:18:14] come here
[2:18:15] anyway
[2:18:20] he didn't say for him to come to you
[2:18:51] go to him amen
[2:18:53] may god bless you
[2:19:16] amen some good
[2:19:18] abc preaching huh
[2:19:20] that we certainly need
[2:19:22] you know i don't want you to
[2:19:24] misunderstand
[2:19:26] uh brother john
[2:19:28] you know you should never
[2:19:30] take
[2:19:32] my words
[2:19:33] just because of my office
[2:19:36] you understand that's
[2:19:38] not what he's saying
[2:19:40] because you would never be called out
[2:19:43] if you understand so that's not what
[2:19:45] he's saying but what he's saying is is
[2:19:49] you respect somebody brother brahm said
[2:19:51] stay with your pastor as long as he
[2:19:54] stays with
[2:19:55] the word
[2:19:57] you understand
[2:19:59] and uh
[2:20:00] and that was the
[2:20:01] great that's the thing we're going to go
[2:20:03] into next
[2:20:04] about what brother branham called where
[2:20:07] the trouble comes is you had balaam
[2:20:10] who was a vindicated prophet of god and
[2:20:13] you had
[2:20:14] moses and the only danger there was is
[2:20:18] that
[2:20:20] balaam got the word of god
[2:20:23] he got the real answer from god but he
[2:20:26] wouldn't follow it
[2:20:29] you know what i'm saying so it doesn't
[2:20:31] matter you've got to watch how it
[2:20:33] follows you've got to watch what the
[2:20:36] fruits of it is so it's just not a
[2:20:38] blanket oh he's the pastor you believe
[2:20:42] what he says because he has the office i
[2:20:45] i would never want you to do that
[2:20:48] the only reason i'd want you to give me
[2:20:51] one
[2:20:52] ounce
[2:20:53] of a grain of salt is that if i'm saying
[2:20:57] what the prophet of god said
[2:20:59] that's what
[2:21:01] we rest in
[2:21:03] and and i believe the next message is a
[2:21:06] guide is that right the next one after i
[2:21:09] think he preaches a message called a
[2:21:11] guide and that's what we have that's
[2:21:13] what we all have in common
[2:21:15] we have the revelation that the lord's
[2:21:18] come in our day the word of the lord is
[2:21:20] coming our day to us jesus christ
[2:21:23] visiting and coming back to the gentile
[2:21:25] bride
[2:21:26] veiled in the message of the hour
[2:21:29] giving us the very word that's going to
[2:21:32] transform us
[2:21:33] and put us into that rapturing
[2:21:36] condition so we're just servants
[2:21:39] the scripture says you don't lord over
[2:21:41] god's heritage but you become the
[2:21:44] servants of the people
[2:21:46] so i've had many people come to me
[2:21:48] and the only thing i can do is take you
[2:21:51] to what the prophet of god said just
[2:21:54] bring to your remembrance brother braham
[2:21:56] said this here brother abraham said that
[2:21:58] there brother brim said that there
[2:22:00] because really deep inside that's the
[2:22:03] voice you hear you hear the voice of
[2:22:05] your bridegroom
[2:22:07] and i i liked something that rather
[2:22:10] john samuel he said in the sight of god
[2:22:14] we're all
[2:22:15] female
[2:22:16] and that's that's true because there's
[2:22:18] neither male nor free
[2:22:21] male nor female june or greek bonder
[2:22:24] free but we're all christ and christ is
[2:22:26] god's god bless you if the brothers
[2:22:28] would go prayer for communion uh
[2:22:31] we'll try to i know the alexanders are
[2:22:33] with us and that they have a long way
[2:22:36] home and and so we don't want to
[2:22:39] have them drive too much in the dark if
[2:22:42] it gets dark we'll drive you home and
[2:22:44] take care of you all right so lord bush
[2:22:47] let's stand together
[2:22:49] and let's turn in the gospel of saint
[2:22:51] luke
[2:22:54] and the 14th
[2:22:57] verse of the
[2:22:59] gospel of saint luke the 22nd
[2:23:02] chapter and the 14th the brothers should
[2:23:06] prepare for communion we'll move right
[2:23:08] into communion service
[2:23:11] it says in the 14th verse of luke the
[2:23:14] 22nd
[2:23:15] chapter it says
[2:23:17] and when the hour was come
[2:23:20] he sat down
[2:23:22] and the
[2:23:23] and the twelve apostles with him
[2:23:26] and he said unto them
[2:23:28] with
[2:23:29] desire i have desired to eat
[2:23:33] this passover with you
[2:23:35] before i suffer
[2:23:38] for i say unto you i will not
[2:23:41] any more eat thereof
[2:23:44] until it be fulfilled
[2:23:46] in the kingdom of god
[2:23:48] and he took the cup
[2:23:50] and gave thanks and said take this
[2:23:54] and divide it amongst yourselves
[2:23:57] for i say unto you
[2:23:59] i will not drink of the fruit of the
[2:24:02] vine
[2:24:03] until the kingdom of god shall come
[2:24:06] and he took
[2:24:08] bread
[2:24:09] and gave thanks and break it
[2:24:11] and gave it unto them saying this is my
[2:24:14] body which is given for you
[2:24:17] this dew in remembrance of me
[2:24:20] and likewise also the cup after supper
[2:24:23] saying
[2:24:24] this cup is the new testament in my
[2:24:27] blood
[2:24:28] which is shed
[2:24:30] for you
[2:24:31] but behold the hand of him
[2:24:34] that betrayeth me
[2:24:36] is with me on the table
[2:24:39] and truly the son of man goeth as it is
[2:24:42] determined
[2:24:44] but woe unto him
[2:24:46] that man
[2:24:47] by whom he is
[2:24:50] betrayed
[2:24:51] so even you notice that even the great
[2:24:53] challenge that the lord jesus faced
[2:24:57] you know and and that's truly what we
[2:24:59] don't we don't want to betray the
[2:25:01] purpose
[2:25:02] of these things so that the brothers
[2:25:04] would come we'd ask them
[2:25:07] blessing
[2:25:08] upon
[2:25:13] our gracious
[2:25:15] heavenly father
[2:25:17] lord this
[2:25:18] bread that
[2:25:21] is set before us that
[2:25:23] is a representation of the sacrifice
[2:25:26] that you give us
[2:25:28] and as our brother preached
[2:25:31] that he done something for us
[2:25:33] and then we receive what he's done
[2:25:36] and now our appreciation
[2:25:38] is manifested that what he has done
[2:25:41] should show up in our lives
[2:25:44] and father we take this communion
[2:25:46] tonight that we can come back into
[2:25:48] fellowship with you
[2:25:50] there's healing and communion
[2:25:52] lord our our brother
[2:25:54] brother miriam father he needs a healing
[2:25:57] touch in his body
[2:26:00] father he we know that
[2:26:03] that
[2:26:04] the there's cancer in his phone
[2:26:07] but yet father he's here tonight
[2:26:10] because he wants to take communion
[2:26:14] lord and so we ask that you would
[2:26:18] look upon him father
[2:26:20] with favor
[2:26:22] and father you would touch his suffering
[2:26:26] lord that this
[2:26:28] that's in his bones father he's walked
[2:26:31] many years with you at 85 years old
[2:26:35] father that you would give his body
[2:26:37] comfort
[2:26:38] then rest father we don't care
[2:26:41] if the cancer remains father if it has
[2:26:43] no effect on him we raise our hands and
[2:26:46] we glorify you father for you have an
[2:26:50] appointed time for him
[2:26:52] but father we ask that you remove the
[2:26:54] pain
[2:26:55] and the suffering father satan has no
[2:26:57] rule of his body because he's given his
[2:27:01] life to you
[2:27:02] and father this bread here represents
[2:27:04] that
[2:27:05] father for there's healing in communion
[2:27:09] and father this cup that's here this
[2:27:12] wine representing the stimulation of
[2:27:15] revelation that comes in our lives it
[2:27:18] was shed for us father that the life of
[2:27:21] the sacrifice did come back into the
[2:27:23] believer father we asked we become more
[2:27:26] dedicated this evening
[2:27:29] that we would take the responsibility of
[2:27:32] our
[2:27:33] election father seriously
[2:27:36] we would understand that of all the
[2:27:38] people of this world you chose us
[2:27:41] not to go into judgment
[2:27:43] father may we live as if we believe that
[2:27:47] may we let our life shine that others
[2:27:49] might see
[2:27:51] but that they might inquire of what's
[2:27:53] the hope that's in us that they too
[2:27:56] might possess this election
[2:27:58] father we act that you'd move upon our
[2:28:01] congregation father may be pleasing
[2:28:04] father those of us who are not living up
[2:28:06] to the standard
[2:28:08] that we should be living to we ask for
[2:28:11] mercy upon them father and forgiveness
[2:28:14] father that you'd send your spirit by to
[2:28:17] instruct them and father make them a way
[2:28:19] of their way of their ways father that
[2:28:22] they may turn their hearts back to you
[2:28:25] father we don't want to leave one here
[2:28:27] we want to take every single elected son
[2:28:30] and daughter of god when we go
[2:28:33] and we ask it we're not going to leave
[2:28:34] any behind
[2:28:36] be like abraham oh god rescuing life we
[2:28:40] ask it in jesus precious name we pray
[2:28:43] amen
