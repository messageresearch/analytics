[59:13] so
[59:14] uh i appended i have to invite them both
[59:17] back but i've asked brother chris to
[59:19] bring the message tonight but i've asked
[59:20] brother
[59:21] uh ben david his real name's reggie but
[59:24] they don't call him that for some reason
[59:27] so
[59:28] they call him ben david so
[59:31] but i guess his real name's reggie but
[59:34] uh
[59:35] i i really had identifying it like his
[59:38] a wife said today you know everybody
[59:40] says they call him reggie platt
[59:44] and uh uh but his name's plet
[59:47] i believe it's the right way right well
[59:49] that's like me everybody calls me
[59:51] mcgeary
[59:52] you know mcgeary and it's not mcgeary
[59:55] it's geary
[59:57] you know so okay you know they never say
[1:00:00] it right
[1:00:00] and so then i got really kind of
[1:00:02] chuckled because
[1:00:03] uh you know they said we're not platts
[1:00:06] we're plaits
[1:00:08] so anyway i don't know if that has any
[1:00:11] effect on the things that you say
[1:00:12] brother but
[1:00:13] i definitely want you to come up here
[1:00:16] and say something to us
[1:00:17] with your right name so anyway
[1:00:20] this is reggie ben david platt he's
[1:00:23] gonna come he's a minister in
[1:00:25] in arizona up there in flagstaff
[1:00:29] and uh so i've asked him to come up and
[1:00:34] and just greet us and give us a word of
[1:00:36] exhortation take a few moments to say
[1:00:39] everything and and of course then being
[1:00:42] a minister i looked over at brother
[1:00:43] chris i said now
[1:00:45] i'm going to have brother reggie come up
[1:00:47] and walk all over your sermon before
[1:00:50] you preach and and i said but if it's
[1:00:53] fresh manna you just bring it just the
[1:00:55] way that
[1:00:56] that god give it to you and it'll be
[1:00:59] really good so come on up brother and
[1:01:00] and it's just wonderful to have you
[1:01:02] it's wonderful to feel the presence of
[1:01:05] the lord
[1:01:06] and it's wonderful to enjoy the things
[1:01:08] of the lord good to see brother randy
[1:01:09] tonight whether randy god bless you
[1:01:12] we're happy i guess you're back on the
[1:01:14] battlefield
[1:01:15] all right so we got a little thin on
[1:01:18] preachers around here for a while so
[1:01:20] it's nice to have a brother randy
[1:01:24] back with us amen brother god bless you
[1:01:26] because
[1:01:27] feel what's on your heart thank you
[1:01:30] god bless you this evening saints i
[1:01:34] sure enjoyed this service thus far and i
[1:01:37] enjoyed the service this morning
[1:01:40] i had a chance afterwards to
[1:01:43] uh fellowship a little bit with brother
[1:01:46] andrew and
[1:01:47] and i certainly enjoyed uh speaking with
[1:01:50] him and
[1:01:50] and sharing a little bit of testimony
[1:01:53] back and forth with him and
[1:01:56] just have enjoyed every every portion
[1:02:00] of this and of course most importantly
[1:02:04] the spirit of the lord to be able to to
[1:02:06] feel that
[1:02:08] here i was thinking is that
[1:02:11] as our sister was singing that song
[1:02:14] he has forgiven me the first time i ever
[1:02:17] heard that song
[1:02:19] was from one of my sunday school
[1:02:21] students
[1:02:23] who had had an experience with the lord
[1:02:27] and she was
[1:02:30] a high school student when i was
[1:02:32] teaching her in sunday school
[1:02:34] and then she became a dear friend of of
[1:02:38] ours
[1:02:39] and and that was sister charity mcgeary
[1:02:44] and when she sang that song
[1:02:48] for the first time i i've ever heard
[1:02:50] that song
[1:02:51] was from her and i knew
[1:02:55] that she'd had an experience with the
[1:02:56] lord and that the lord had
[1:02:59] certainly forgiven her and i knew what
[1:03:01] that was like
[1:03:02] to have that forgiveness and i just
[1:03:06] wanted to
[1:03:08] share maybe just a little bit of
[1:03:11] that testimony with you here um
[1:03:17] my exhortation to you parents would be
[1:03:21] don't
[1:03:22] ever name your child with four names
[1:03:24] because
[1:03:27] nobody will ever know what to call them
[1:03:31] my my name is reginald ben
[1:03:34] david pled my dad is
[1:03:38] also reginald and so while i was growing
[1:03:41] up
[1:03:41] they didn't want the name reginald
[1:03:43] flying around the house and have two
[1:03:45] people
[1:03:46] yelling answering and so they called me
[1:03:49] by my middle name which is ben
[1:03:51] david and
[1:03:54] so growing up everyone knew me has been
[1:03:57] david
[1:03:58] but as i got a little more independent
[1:04:00] in school
[1:04:01] you know my first name was reggie and i
[1:04:03] wanted to be identified by my first name
[1:04:06] and so consequently
[1:04:09] some were calling me reggie and some
[1:04:11] were calling me ben david
[1:04:13] and then as the lord called me to be a
[1:04:16] minister
[1:04:17] of the gospel
[1:04:21] people were saying well brother reggie
[1:04:23] this brother reggie this and others were
[1:04:25] saying brother ben david this
[1:04:26] and they said who is who are they
[1:04:29] talking about
[1:04:30] that's a good thing yeah it is a good
[1:04:32] thing brother david i'm hoping that i
[1:04:34] tell people this i hope one of these
[1:04:36] days
[1:04:36] that you get a flyer for a set of
[1:04:39] meetings
[1:04:40] and there's going to be a brother reggie
[1:04:42] preaching a brother ben preaching
[1:04:44] a brother david preaching and
[1:04:47] everybody's so excited because they get
[1:04:48] to hear three different preachers but
[1:04:50] it'll just be the one
[1:04:54] and uh but i had uh i had a scripture
[1:04:57] that i wanted to
[1:04:58] share with you all um it's in amos
[1:05:02] chapter 5.
[1:05:09] and it starts uh
[1:05:12] at verse 21 and
[1:05:15] reads to the end of the chapter and not
[1:05:18] a very
[1:05:19] uh not a very familiar scripture i don't
[1:05:23] know that i've ever heard
[1:05:24] a sermon built from this scripture
[1:05:29] it starts off i hate
[1:05:33] and so you're not going to hear a lot of
[1:05:34] sermons built from from
[1:05:36] that scripture but it says i hate
[1:05:39] i despise your feast days and i will not
[1:05:42] smell
[1:05:43] in your solemn assemblies though ye
[1:05:47] offer me burnt offerings and your meat
[1:05:49] offerings
[1:05:50] i will not accept them neither will i
[1:05:53] regard the peace offerings of your fat
[1:05:55] beasts
[1:05:57] take thou away from me the noise of thy
[1:06:00] songs
[1:06:01] for i will not hear the melody of thy
[1:06:04] viles
[1:06:05] but let judgment run down as waters and
[1:06:09] righteousness as a mighty stream have ye
[1:06:12] offered unto me
[1:06:13] a sac me sacrifices and offerings in the
[1:06:17] wilderness 40 years o house of israel
[1:06:20] but you have borne the tabernacle of
[1:06:22] your moloch and chiam
[1:06:24] your images the star of your god
[1:06:28] which you made to yourselves therefore
[1:06:31] will i
[1:06:32] cause you to go into captivity beyond
[1:06:35] damascus saith the lord
[1:06:37] whose name is the god of hosts
[1:06:42] i was fortunate enough to be raised
[1:06:47] under the pews of a message believing
[1:06:50] church and my parents
[1:06:55] received the message of the hour when i
[1:06:57] was just a baby
[1:06:58] in california and like brother david
[1:07:03] then they the only church they heard of
[1:07:06] they just asked the minister well
[1:07:07] where's the church that
[1:07:08] that teaches or preaches this and
[1:07:11] somebody just said
[1:07:12] well we know there's one in flagstaff
[1:07:14] arizona so they said that's good enough
[1:07:16] so they moved to flagstaff and that's
[1:07:19] where i grew up
[1:07:22] and i uh i
[1:07:25] uh boy i knew
[1:07:28] the quotes i i knew all the buzz words
[1:07:32] i knew all the cliches um
[1:07:36] i knew i knew about the seals
[1:07:39] i knew about marriage and divorce as a
[1:07:41] child i could
[1:07:42] i could have hung with the best of the
[1:07:44] preachers but i never met the god
[1:07:46] of this message and um
[1:07:51] and i was the worst kind of a of a
[1:07:54] message a
[1:07:56] child i was a hypocrite i i used to
[1:08:00] judge every schoolmate that claimed to
[1:08:03] know christianity i used to judge them
[1:08:06] as a remnant
[1:08:09] as a tribulation fodder
[1:08:13] that i knew what the truth was and they
[1:08:15] didn't and
[1:08:16] pour them but i never knew the god of
[1:08:19] the message of this hour
[1:08:22] and there was
[1:08:26] i knew the story of the eagle that flew
[1:08:29] over the barnyard
[1:08:30] i knew that that man had a a
[1:08:34] nest of eggs under a chicken and he
[1:08:37] needed a
[1:08:38] full setting so he went and got an eagle
[1:08:40] egg to finish that setting
[1:08:42] i knew that eagle had hatched in a
[1:08:45] chicken yard
[1:08:46] and that that eagle was pecking at
[1:08:50] chicken food i knew that
[1:08:55] he always felt odd and i knew that one
[1:08:58] day
[1:08:58] and mother eagle would fly over that
[1:09:00] nest and screamed and called to that
[1:09:03] chicken
[1:09:03] or to that eagle out of the chicken yard
[1:09:07] and i knew all of the believers
[1:09:10] like brother david and my parents who
[1:09:14] could identify with that story
[1:09:17] that said that was us we came out of
[1:09:19] denominations
[1:09:21] we came out of the denominational
[1:09:24] chicken yard and we were called
[1:09:26] into a higher place to be eagles but i
[1:09:29] was
[1:09:30] raised on the views of a message
[1:09:32] believing church
[1:09:34] i didn't know about the chicken yard i
[1:09:37] didn't know about
[1:09:38] i'd visited probably more
[1:09:41] denominational churches than most
[1:09:44] believers have ever
[1:09:46] have ever visited so i understood
[1:09:49] this story but it didn't was not
[1:09:51] applicable to my life
[1:09:54] but i found out as i as the lord
[1:09:58] began to deal with my heart that brother
[1:10:00] branham tells more than one
[1:10:02] eagle story you realize that in that
[1:10:04] eagle's nest
[1:10:05] there was more than one egg there's a
[1:10:09] couple eggs in that nest
[1:10:11] and he tells the story about the egg
[1:10:14] that remained
[1:10:15] in that nest and he said that that eagle
[1:10:18] that
[1:10:19] hatches in the nest of the eagle
[1:10:22] nest they've got to
[1:10:26] be hatched out and when they're hatched
[1:10:28] out they're hatched out
[1:10:30] in a nice comfortable rabbit
[1:10:33] fur lined nest
[1:10:37] and how comfortable it is and how that
[1:10:40] all these young people that are raised
[1:10:42] in a nice
[1:10:43] wonderful message church are
[1:10:46] are are hatched out in a rabbit
[1:10:49] fur-lined
[1:10:50] nest and oh how they know what an eagle
[1:10:54] talks like they know what an eagle looks
[1:10:56] like
[1:10:57] they know all there is to know about
[1:11:00] eagles
[1:11:01] but they don't know what it is to be an
[1:11:04] eagle
[1:11:06] and so brother branham said that one day
[1:11:09] that mother eagle has to begin to take
[1:11:11] the fur
[1:11:12] out of the nest and that that little
[1:11:15] eagle has got to feel the pricks
[1:11:18] under their feet for themselves to get
[1:11:21] so uncomfortable that they've got to
[1:11:24] leave
[1:11:24] the nest and he said that
[1:11:27] that little eagle gets so uncomfortable
[1:11:30] in the nest it's got nowhere else to go
[1:11:32] but to learn to set his wings
[1:11:37] and one day mother eagle will come down
[1:11:40] and take that little eaglet on her wings
[1:11:43] and say
[1:11:44] it's time to go for a ride and he said
[1:11:47] that she'll take that eagle
[1:11:49] out there and take it up in the highest
[1:11:52] of heights and many of the young people
[1:11:54] have gone to many a message camp have
[1:11:57] gone to
[1:11:58] many a message church and they have
[1:12:01] experienced
[1:12:02] what it is to fly on the wings of an
[1:12:05] eagle to feel the presence of god but
[1:12:08] they've
[1:12:08] never known what it is for themselves to
[1:12:11] be an eagle
[1:12:12] until that mother eagle turns their life
[1:12:16] upside down and dumps them off of
[1:12:19] her wings and when mama eagle
[1:12:22] takes and dumps them off
[1:12:25] that eagle has experiences
[1:12:29] real panic it experiences
[1:12:32] i'm not being carried anymore by
[1:12:36] mom and by dad what am i supposed to do
[1:12:39] and that's when jehovah eagle says
[1:12:41] you've got to flap your own weakness
[1:12:44] you've got to learn what it is
[1:12:46] and before that eagle can hit the ground
[1:12:49] jehovah eagle will swing underneath that
[1:12:51] eagle
[1:12:52] and she'll take those eagles back up
[1:12:54] again and say now we're gonna
[1:12:56] do it again until you learn to fly
[1:13:00] and when i was growing up on on a
[1:13:03] message pew
[1:13:05] when i was criticizing
[1:13:08] all the other children that that went to
[1:13:11] churches
[1:13:13] that that probably had had an experience
[1:13:16] with the lord i was in the seat of the
[1:13:20] scornful
[1:13:20] condemning them until one day my
[1:13:24] senior year of high school i was at a
[1:13:27] state
[1:13:28] track meet and
[1:13:32] i'd already determined my course i was
[1:13:35] set for hollywood
[1:13:37] i was set for new york city
[1:13:40] i already knew the course that i was
[1:13:42] going to take
[1:13:43] and i thought that i had that planned
[1:13:47] out and it was certainly
[1:13:48] uh did not involve the message of the
[1:13:50] hour
[1:13:52] but one day i woke up
[1:13:56] it was after a state track meet i was
[1:13:59] up 18 years old
[1:14:03] and i everybody was going to breakfast
[1:14:07] and breakfast just didn't sound good to
[1:14:08] me
[1:14:11] in fact their food just did not
[1:14:14] sound appealing to me at all
[1:14:18] and i thought this is a strange feeling
[1:14:20] in my heart
[1:14:22] and so i took a bus ride from phoenix up
[1:14:25] to flagstaff and i thought i don't know
[1:14:27] what this feeling is
[1:14:29] that's inside of me and i thought well i
[1:14:31] know it'll ease that
[1:14:33] if i put on some of my worldly music
[1:14:37] maybe that'll comfort me
[1:14:41] so i put on my worldly music and it made
[1:14:44] me sick to my stomach
[1:14:47] and i couldn't handle that music anymore
[1:14:49] and so i shut it off
[1:14:51] and i thought what is wrong with me and
[1:14:57] by the time i got to flagstaff there was
[1:14:59] only one thing
[1:15:00] that was screaming out in my heart and
[1:15:02] that was
[1:15:04] i've got to get home and find a bible
[1:15:08] and i thought i surely my mom and dad
[1:15:10] have got a bible in my house
[1:15:11] you know there's got to be lots of
[1:15:12] bibles in the house and so i ran
[1:15:15] to my room and i grabbed the bible
[1:15:18] and i thought oh god i know it's you i
[1:15:21] know you're calling
[1:15:23] i know that you're you're pulling on me
[1:15:26] and i thought lord if that's you i need
[1:15:29] you to talk to me
[1:15:31] and i wanted and i i didn't know where
[1:15:34] to turn i didn't
[1:15:35] i didn't know where to even look in the
[1:15:38] bible
[1:15:38] so i just took the bible and i opened it
[1:15:40] up and i
[1:15:42] inside i think i was probably hoping for
[1:15:44] john 3 16.
[1:15:46] god so loved the world he gave his only
[1:15:49] begotten son and i just thought i wanted
[1:15:51] something that would say that i love you
[1:15:54] and instead
[1:15:55] this is where i turned was in amos
[1:15:58] chapter 5.
[1:16:00] and it let me know that i hate
[1:16:04] your feasts that you give to me and i
[1:16:08] hate your music i won't listen to the
[1:16:10] music you're listening to
[1:16:13] and as he began to
[1:16:16] take and strip me down
[1:16:21] and take me to the backside of the
[1:16:23] desert
[1:16:24] and absolutely expose me and take
[1:16:27] everything that i thought that i was and
[1:16:29] he began to strip it away
[1:16:31] and the humiliation as he began to strip
[1:16:34] my life
[1:16:35] and he began to show me that what it is
[1:16:37] is
[1:16:38] what you need is a spanking what you
[1:16:41] need
[1:16:42] is a desert you need to know
[1:16:45] what this is about and you need nowhere
[1:16:48] else to turn
[1:16:49] but to god you need to be an eagle
[1:16:52] that's been
[1:16:53] dumped off of those wings and feels
[1:16:55] helpless and hopeless
[1:16:57] and you need to look up and see jehovah
[1:17:00] eagle
[1:17:01] is your father is your mother is your
[1:17:03] sister is your brother
[1:17:05] is your all in all and he wanted me to
[1:17:08] look to him and to him only
[1:17:10] and as i began to read this and i began
[1:17:14] to
[1:17:15] see how wrong i had been and what a
[1:17:18] filthy
[1:17:18] life that i had had lived
[1:17:21] even behind the name of the message of
[1:17:24] the hour
[1:17:25] using that for a crutch i got
[1:17:28] to that last verse therefore will i
[1:17:31] cause you to go into
[1:17:32] captivity beyond damascus
[1:17:36] and i realized that that's exactly the
[1:17:39] road that paul was on
[1:17:41] when the lord found him we was on that
[1:17:44] road to damascus
[1:17:46] all in the name of religion to go
[1:17:49] to kill christians and when i
[1:17:53] the lord revealed these scriptures to me
[1:17:57] it was the straw that broke
[1:17:59] the camel's back and there in that
[1:18:02] bedroom
[1:18:03] in my bedroom as i realized that when it
[1:18:07] said
[1:18:08] that you have borne the tabernacle of
[1:18:11] moloch and chiam your images
[1:18:14] the star of your god boy i thought i was
[1:18:18] going to be a star
[1:18:19] a hollywood star i thought i was going
[1:18:21] to be a great television star
[1:18:23] a movie star and i realized that the
[1:18:26] star
[1:18:27] that of the god that i had made was the
[1:18:29] star of hollywood
[1:18:31] the the the the hollywood stars
[1:18:35] on that on the walk of of hollywood
[1:18:38] and those images that i had were posters
[1:18:41] of idols that i had hanging in my
[1:18:43] bedroom
[1:18:45] those were the images that i had set up
[1:18:48] was
[1:18:48] my own idea of what a star was
[1:18:52] and god began to strip those things out
[1:18:54] of my life and those posters began to
[1:18:56] come down
[1:18:57] out of my room and the television out of
[1:18:59] my life
[1:19:00] and all the things that i had held on to
[1:19:03] that were worldly
[1:19:04] they had to go away and they went
[1:19:06] straight to the dumpster
[1:19:08] they i i didn't even want anybody to
[1:19:11] know about that music so i took all that
[1:19:13] cd collection and i
[1:19:14] drove into town and i found a dumpster
[1:19:17] and i
[1:19:17] all went into the dumpster and
[1:19:19] everything i had had to go into the
[1:19:21] dumpster
[1:19:22] and god began to call me
[1:19:26] and show me that
[1:19:29] though you may not know what the chicken
[1:19:31] yard is of the denominations
[1:19:34] you're still an eagle and young people
[1:19:38] though you may be raised
[1:19:40] in a message church you're an eagle and
[1:19:42] you need to know
[1:19:43] you're an eagle god wants to show you
[1:19:47] you're an eagle he wants to take you to
[1:19:48] the same heights
[1:19:50] that he took the one from the chicken
[1:19:51] yard and he took
[1:19:53] them to he wants you to set your wings
[1:19:56] as well
[1:19:57] and to realize that you too are an eagle
[1:20:00] and that you can hear the scream
[1:20:02] of the eagle and that you can recognize
[1:20:05] this
[1:20:05] is what i was made for that that that
[1:20:08] the nest
[1:20:09] then even though it doesn't have the
[1:20:11] rabbit's fur anymore
[1:20:13] it's still an eagle's nest and you now
[1:20:16] can come into that eagle's nest
[1:20:18] it's a it's a strange land with strange
[1:20:20] people
[1:20:21] who speak a strange language and you
[1:20:23] find out
[1:20:24] you end up singing i'm one of them
[1:20:27] i'm one of them so god bless you i don't
[1:20:30] want to take any time i know you'll
[1:20:32] enjoy

[1:20:57] very inspirational all right well i
[1:21:01] i rather chris kathy's going to
[1:21:05] preach from me and i has given him a
[1:21:06] hard time in my office
[1:21:09] i said i heard you from memphis
[1:21:13] he says no i'm from memphis indiana
[1:21:18] i said you sell fake grass and you live

[1:21:30] i am a man so now i hear he's a real
[1:21:32] preacher
[1:21:34] oh man i'm set tonight aren't i i get
[1:21:37] we're going to have a wonderful time
[1:21:39] in the lord i i think what's so
[1:21:43] beautiful about
[1:21:47] what uh reginald said to us
[1:21:50] that's what i'm calling you for now on
[1:21:52] brother you're reginald to me
[1:21:54] it is that everybody
[1:21:58] that belongs to him has an experience
[1:22:03] that god has for them and it's such a
[1:22:06] beautiful
[1:22:07] individual affair and we could probably
[1:22:10] have testimony after testimony everybody
[1:22:13] standing up
[1:22:14] telling us how that they came to that
[1:22:16] wing shaking
[1:22:18] in their life where they took that
[1:22:20] flight
[1:22:21] and it's so a wonderful thing so
[1:22:25] i guess we don't really have to have a
[1:22:26] song
[1:22:29] to sing i i like
[1:22:32] that thought i'm one of them i thought
[1:22:34] i'd sing that and then i thought you

[1:25:28] as he was
[1:25:29] as he want to the mount of olives and
[1:25:31] his disciples
[1:25:32] also followed him and when he was at the
[1:25:35] place he said unto them
[1:25:37] pray ye that you enter not into
[1:25:40] temptation
[1:25:41] and he was withdrawn from them about a
[1:25:44] stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed
[1:25:46] saying
[1:25:46] father if i be with he says father
[1:25:50] if thou be willing remove this cup from
[1:25:53] from me
[1:25:54] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:25:57] done
[1:25:58] and there appeared in angel unto him
[1:26:01] from heaven
[1:26:02] strengthening him you know aren't you
[1:26:04] thankful that we have a god that sends
[1:26:06] angels that strengthens us when we go
[1:26:08] through troubles and we go through
[1:26:09] trials that
[1:26:10] you know we might not we we might not
[1:26:12] see what we're going through at the
[1:26:13] moment
[1:26:13] but the angel of the god is standing
[1:26:15] there he's strengthening you
[1:26:17] you might be going through a sickness or
[1:26:18] a depression or whatever it is
[1:26:20] and we just stop and say god i need you
[1:26:22] right now
[1:26:23] and you know i just love what he says he
[1:26:25] says and there appeared in angel unto
[1:26:27] him from heaven not just jesus but
[1:26:29] the bride of christ tonight saying he's
[1:26:32] strengthening him and being in
[1:26:33] agony he prayed more earnestly
[1:26:36] and his he said and his sweats were as a
[1:26:39] great drops of blood flowing down to the
[1:26:41] ground
[1:26:42] and when he arose from prayer and was
[1:26:44] come to his disciples he found them
[1:26:45] sleeping for sorrow
[1:26:47] and said unto them why sleep ye rise and
[1:26:50] pray
[1:26:52] least ye enter into temptations you may
[1:26:54] be seated
[1:26:56] you know i was thinking on verse 42
[1:26:59] tonight
[1:27:00] he said saying father if thou be willing
[1:27:02] to remove this cup from me
[1:27:04] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:27:07] done
[1:27:08] and as i was just thinking this morning
[1:27:10] as brother david was preaching it was
[1:27:12] just wonderful and it
[1:27:13] it made me think he talked about not not
[1:27:15] my i'm about my father's business
[1:27:18] and i and i kind of just was praying
[1:27:20] this afternoon and i
[1:27:21] came over and was thinking about the
[1:27:22] scripture and not my will but nine be
[1:27:25] done
[1:27:26] and i think us as christians today we
[1:27:29] we we need a more of a surrender life in
[1:27:32] christ
[1:27:33] and i believe we're we're in a great
[1:27:35] great battle in the late hour but
[1:27:37] you know as we travel and travel and
[1:27:39] travel i you know i didn't grow up in
[1:27:40] the message church i grew up in a broken
[1:27:42] up home that
[1:27:43] didn't know jesus and didn't have jesus
[1:27:45] didn't didn't know nothing about jesus
[1:27:47] but i tell you like he said
[1:27:48] that that great chicken yard i was in
[1:27:50] the chicken yard and he
[1:27:52] that great uh mother eagle came and got
[1:27:54] me came and i heard the voice and that
[1:27:56] deep caught to the deep to respond to
[1:27:59] and i'll tell you tonight if you're
[1:28:00] sitting in a church and you you hear the
[1:28:02] message of the hour you're blessed
[1:28:04] you're a blessed church tonight you know
[1:28:07] i tell you i didn't grow up with all
[1:28:08] that i grew up in a
[1:28:09] in a mixed up home that got divorced at
[1:28:12] six
[1:28:12] six years old i came to a bus stop and
[1:28:15] daddy and mommy were getting
[1:28:16] divorced and i didn't want that to
[1:28:18] happen and the officers came and
[1:28:20] and they said hey who do you pick and i
[1:28:22] i said i want both of them my brother
[1:28:24] said
[1:28:24] one person my my sister said i said i
[1:28:26] want both of them
[1:28:28] and i realized that we all come up
[1:28:30] shaped in the world
[1:28:31] speaking lies and sin and everything in
[1:28:33] our lives but god changes
[1:28:35] us you know god put something in us
[1:28:37] tonight to come to the house of god
[1:28:40] and you know in the late hour you drive
[1:28:41] down you see all these churches as we
[1:28:43] were driving over here
[1:28:44] the doors were shut and you think about
[1:28:46] how many churches are even having church
[1:28:48] i tell you the devil is all in this
[1:28:50] covenant he's talking about the covenant
[1:28:52] 19 the clover 20
[1:28:53] whatever it is but i just have to go
[1:28:55] back to the bible and says
[1:28:56] what the bible says you know he didn't
[1:28:59] say we wouldn't get sick but he will
[1:29:01] deliver us out of
[1:29:02] all our troubles out of everything you
[1:29:04] have need of tonight
[1:29:05] he will deliver you tonight whatever you
[1:29:07] have need you came to depression you can
[1:29:09] leave it
[1:29:09] leave it here tonight and leave weft or
[1:29:11] whatever you have need of tonight
[1:29:13] we just gotta trust the god that was in
[1:29:15] that man
[1:29:16] to come in us you know he didn't just
[1:29:19] come down and come in brother branham
[1:29:20] he's got a vessel tonight that he wants
[1:29:22] to fill but you know sometimes we have
[1:29:25] our
[1:29:25] we have our vessels they're still dirty
[1:29:27] and we need to fill them up tonight
[1:29:29] that more than just you know just
[1:29:31] halfway feeling but let god
[1:29:33] fill you from the head to the toe and
[1:29:35] fill your life
[1:29:36] and you just truly surrender life to god
[1:29:39] and let him use a clean vessel
[1:29:41] he wants a clean vessel tonight that he
[1:29:43] can work through
[1:29:44] that you could be god with skin on and
[1:29:46] out here that's what people want to see
[1:29:48] they don't want to hear what you got to
[1:29:50] say
[1:29:50] they want to see a life behind the name
[1:29:53] like brother abraham says the light
[1:29:54] behind the name makes the devil tremble
[1:29:56] and i'll tell you we've got to get above
[1:29:58] this tonight that we're
[1:29:59] that we're more than conquerors in
[1:30:01] christ jesus that we're not just coming
[1:30:04] through this world
[1:30:05] or just passing through you're meant to
[1:30:07] be here oh god saw you and laid out a
[1:30:09] cnn age

[1:30:41] he says i want to glory in my
[1:30:43] tribulations oh they're precious than
[1:30:45] gold
[1:30:46] and i tell you church we got to get back
[1:30:47] to the word and get a more
[1:30:49] surrendered life for jesus and get more
[1:30:52] about his business than our business

[1:31:20] tonight and brother braham says in the
[1:31:22] token message
[1:31:23] he said the message he said the message
[1:31:25] is christ
[1:31:27] here's what he says church the message
[1:31:29] is christ
[1:31:31] church out of everyone else i tell you
[1:31:33] they would die just
[1:31:34] to have their eyes out clear tonight but
[1:31:37] i tell you sometimes i feel like

[1:31:40] around here and they have film on their
[1:31:41] eyes
[1:31:43] they walk around with filmy eyes
[1:31:46] but i tell you we should get the film
[1:31:48] off tonight and say lord
[1:31:49] i thank you for choosing me i thank you
[1:31:52] for predestinating
[1:31:53] a seed inside of me that just came to
[1:31:56] the deep call to the deep tonight
[1:31:58] that when he heard the deep he responded
[1:32:01] to
[1:32:02] that it was more than just hey i just a
[1:32:04] little tickling or
[1:32:05] just something that but a deep responded
[1:32:08] to the deep

[1:32:14] he said god only wants a man that he can
[1:32:16] fully
[1:32:17] get in him his complete control
[1:32:21] he said that's right a man that's fully

[1:34:38] manifestation of god used a man
[1:34:40] a prophet to bring the word of god and
[1:34:42] to open their eyes and
[1:34:44] to peel the peel it back and become a
[1:34:45] love language to us
[1:34:48] oh we should be the happiest people
[1:34:50] probably said that christians should be
[1:34:52] the happiest person
[1:34:54] but i tell you i want to think about
[1:34:56] tonight i was thinking about what is our
[1:34:57] purpose of being here what is our
[1:35:00] purpose on here
[1:35:01] not just just to come to church or come
[1:35:03] through the doors and make it a
[1:35:04] tradition
[1:35:06] not just oh we got to be at church but
[1:35:08] to come expecting every time the doors
[1:35:10] are open
[1:35:11] or get on my knees and well i'm going to
[1:35:13] get in just get in your knees and say
[1:35:15] lord
[1:35:15] i need to hear from you tonight no
[1:35:18] matter who's speaking lord
[1:35:19] i ask you i want to draw closer to you
[1:35:22] there's something in my life that you
[1:35:23] need to take away
[1:35:25] oh lord keep clothing me lord
[1:35:28] and i think we got to get that in our
[1:35:30] lives that the bride
[1:35:32] he says the bride is making herself
[1:35:33] ready now every day i think
[1:35:36] there's another day that i can make
[1:35:37] myself ready for this rapture
[1:35:39] oh this whole sweet homecoming whole
[1:35:42] church when the
[1:35:43] when you're at the wedding something he
[1:35:45] walks by and wipes your eyes
[1:35:47] and he wipes your eyes and says it's
[1:35:49] finished it's over
[1:35:51] oh what a what a day of rejoicing that
[1:35:54] will be
[1:35:55] oh and my savior i shall see oh and i
[1:35:58] said look upon this face
[1:36:00] oh church can you think about that
[1:36:02] tonight just let it go through your mind
[1:36:05] you won't care about your job you won't
[1:36:06] care about your car you don't care about
[1:36:08] your house
[1:36:09] because i'm going to a city that makers
[1:36:11] god
[1:36:12] a city that we were predestinated for
[1:36:15] tonight
[1:36:16] uh that a seed got watered one day
[1:36:20] and you're sitting in the house of
[1:36:21] goddess i tell you it's not a time to
[1:36:23] play church
[1:36:24] it's a time to get a purpose for god and
[1:36:26] get to get a surrendered life to jesus
[1:36:31] brother baby says he said there's only
[1:36:32] one form of eternal life
[1:36:34] and that comes from god he said it's for
[1:36:37] he said ordained every creature that
[1:36:40] would ever have it
[1:36:41] just as you were the gene in your father
[1:36:44] you was a you was a gene of god
[1:36:47] he said one of his attributes to begin
[1:36:50] with
[1:36:51] or you'll never be there leadership
[1:36:55] i tell you church we were think about it
[1:36:58] we were before god but
[1:36:59] before the before the stars were placed
[1:37:01] he knew who you were tonight
[1:37:03] he just saw that he needed to put a
[1:37:05] little bit of water on it
[1:37:06] and say hey come out of the chicken yard
[1:37:09] as my brother was saying tonight
[1:37:10] hey i grew up in the church i grew up
[1:37:12] with hey you know what
[1:37:13] quit just quoting tapes i can't quote
[1:37:15] all the message books but i tell you
[1:37:17] it's time to live for jesus christ it's
[1:37:20] time to
[1:37:20] rise up and not just say i'm in a
[1:37:22] message
[1:37:23] or just say i'm quoting the book or i'm
[1:37:26] just toting the book what's that mean
[1:37:29] it's more than just saying i mean the
[1:37:30] message
[1:37:32] i tell you it's more than just saying
[1:37:33] i'm going to give you a quote tonight
[1:37:36] it's truly being letting the word be
[1:37:38] change your life
[1:37:39] then manifest in you and let god speak
[1:37:42] out of you
[1:37:44] and you can be an encouragement to god
[1:37:46] or someone in your workplace
[1:37:47] even if they're not in the message
[1:37:49] because it could be that very last seat
[1:37:51] that we're waiting to get out of here
[1:37:53] because you hadn't said nothing to god
[1:37:55] so when you're your friend that or maybe
[1:37:57] maybe it's not the right time but
[1:37:59] they're just watching your life
[1:38:01] they're just watching everything about
[1:38:03] you your kids are everything you
[1:38:04] everywhere you go someone's watching you
[1:38:07] but i tell you it's time to get a surre
[1:38:09] a really surrendered life and say lord
[1:38:12] not my will but thyme be done
[1:38:14] lord not my will but time be done

[1:39:33] in the bedding ground of your mother
[1:39:35] he said your father didn't know you you
[1:39:37] were in his loins
[1:39:38] he said and when you came forth in the
[1:39:40] bedding ground of your mother
[1:39:42] he said then you became a human being
[1:39:44] and it made you in the image of your
[1:39:45] father
[1:39:46] he said now you can fellowship with him
[1:39:49] he said in the same thing by god if you
[1:39:52] guide eternal life the life
[1:39:54] he says the life you come in the natural
[1:39:57] life physical life
[1:39:59] he said that was by your father he said
[1:40:01] and the only way
[1:40:03] you could come born again is the only
[1:40:05] way he said it has to be the form for
[1:40:08] your heavenly father
[1:40:09] his attributes he said all the father
[1:40:12] has given me
[1:40:13] will come to me see he said you

[1:40:36] the world he said that's exactly right
[1:40:39] you're a gene a spiritual gene out of
[1:40:42] your heavenly father
[1:40:44] he said a part of god's word he said
[1:40:46] that's
[1:40:47] so he said that be so i said he said you
[1:40:51] was with jesus he says when he was
[1:40:54] here because he was the word he said you
[1:40:58] suffered with them

[1:42:47] when he was on the cross
[1:42:48] i believe he saw every one of us tonight

[1:42:53] called 10 million legions of angels but
[1:42:56] he saw a bride tonight
[1:42:57] he saw through the foundation of the
[1:42:59] world that you're sitting here tonight
[1:43:01] they said hey i got children tonight
[1:43:03] that i gotta die for

[1:47:44] brother said he said and then after a
[1:47:46] while you heard the gospel

[1:48:10] when you heard the word
[1:48:12] you knew where you come from and you
[1:48:14] know that was the truth
[1:48:17] he said you were always the seed and he
[1:48:20] said was
[1:48:20] it was in you always he says the word
[1:48:24] seen the word

[1:48:32] it
[1:48:34] whole church aren't you thankful you

[1:48:52] this or hey would you mind taking out
[1:48:54] the trash oh sweetheart i will do that
[1:48:57] i'll go do this or i'll do that but you
[1:48:59] start to realize
[1:49:00] when you love somebody you only have to
[1:49:02] ask you just do it
[1:49:04] or the wife will just iron this or do
[1:49:05] that or wash the dishes
[1:49:07] and she does it out of love and our
[1:49:10] father tonight

[1:49:14] i might not like it i might not there's
[1:49:16] some things lord just take it out of my
[1:49:18] life

[1:49:21] hair don't wear makeup
[1:49:22] this and that young young kids weather

[1:52:11] all these churches doors are closed
[1:52:13] brother was talking about building the
[1:52:14] church and this and that i'm thinking
[1:52:16] well there's
[1:52:16] about plenty of churches left now
[1:52:18] because colgan 19 all this
[1:52:20] they don't even go to church anymore
[1:52:22] they just stay in their pajamas
[1:52:25] it's sad but i'm just telling you the
[1:52:27] truth they stay in their pajamas i'm
[1:52:29] there's a person in my family that
[1:52:31] called me they oh bro
[1:52:32] she's he said chris it's just they're
[1:52:34] not even though they're just in the kind
[1:52:35] of the world and
[1:52:36] they said you know it's so wonderful
[1:52:38] just to get up now in my pajamas i
[1:52:40] wanted to puke
[1:52:42] oh yo i thought the way i'd go back to
[1:52:44] the word i said well the bible says
[1:52:46] that's my shay i've been saying that
[1:52:48] lately i said what the bible says
[1:52:50] go go more in the days approaching as
[1:52:53] you see the day approaching go more
[1:52:56] i'll tell you i'm going to ear on the
[1:52:57] side of the word of god
[1:52:59] the heavens and earth will not pass away
[1:53:00] but my word will not
[1:53:03] and i believe we got to get clothed in
[1:53:04] the word of god and become one with it
[1:53:07] and become about our father's business
[1:53:12] i love what brother brown said he said
[1:53:14] in this in this quote
[1:53:16] he said now man he said i was going to
[1:53:18] choke he said but i'm going to say it
[1:53:20] a man is omnipotent he said you don't
[1:53:23] believe that but he is
[1:53:25] he said a man fully surrendered to god
[1:53:28] is omnipotence
[1:53:30] he said did not he say mark 11 22
[1:53:33] whosoever things you say and don't down
[1:53:35] in your heart it'll come to pass
[1:53:37] he said you can have what you've said
[1:53:40] and i was looking up often empty earlier
[1:53:42] and it says listen it says having
[1:53:45] unlimited
[1:53:46] power having unlimited
[1:53:49] power i'm not talking about a god a god
[1:53:52] can do anything for you tonight
[1:53:54] you got a sickness you leave well oh
[1:53:57] church i don't care what you came with
[1:53:59] tonight you have unlimited power in
[1:54:01] jesus christ
[1:54:02] if you took on his name you were
[1:54:04] baptized by jesus christ
[1:54:06] and your name was changed you call on
[1:54:08] jesus tonight
[1:54:11] but it said the definition i looked up
[1:54:12] right before i came it said having
[1:54:14] unlimited power hold church
[1:54:17] we got to believe we got to stop living
[1:54:19] down here
[1:54:21] and stop living like we in there we want
[1:54:23] to go hang in the chicken yard but come
[1:54:25] back to the eagle yard
[1:54:27] but we got to get out of that and say
[1:54:28] look i'm tired of that chicken pan
[1:54:31] i'm tired of that mess god's calling us
[1:54:34] to live a higher life
[1:54:36] god's calling us to live a lot higher
[1:54:38] life if we could get surrendered
[1:54:40] to jesus and say lord i need more of you
[1:54:44] take this from me take this from me and
[1:54:46] brother brahma said he said he knows
[1:54:48] exactly
[1:54:48] the devil knows exactly where to punch
[1:54:51] and he says to cover that spot
[1:54:54] i'm paraphrasing tonight for time but he
[1:54:56] says cover it
[1:55:01] he says what happens with two
[1:55:03] omnipotents meet
[1:55:05] he said when god and man comes together
[1:55:07] too omnipotent something's got to shake
[1:55:10] he said whosoever he said whatsoever
[1:55:13] you'd say
[1:55:14] with that creative power omnipotence of
[1:55:16] god knowing that he prompt
[1:55:18] promised it he said his word he creates
[1:55:21] a power
[1:55:22] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:55:24] to pass
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:26] oh church he brings things to pass
[1:55:30] when you ask for something of jesus
[1:55:32] tonight he brings it to pass
[1:55:35] he makes the red sea depart he makes
[1:55:38] sicknesses go away
[1:55:39] he heals blinded uh he said he's the
[1:55:41] same yesterday today and forever
[1:55:43] oh christine a god of history i'll tell
[1:55:46] you
[1:55:46] the the founder the statue of a perfect
[1:55:49] man all this stuff that was brought
[1:55:50] forth ain't history
[1:55:52] it's something to listen to and say lord
[1:55:55] change me
[1:55:57] but he said i love what he said he said
[1:55:58] he promised i was shouting for glory
[1:56:00] earlier
[1:56:00] he said he said it is he said right i'm
[1:56:03] coming back to it
[1:56:04] he said whosoever you'd say with this
[1:56:06] create a power omnipotence of god
[1:56:08] knowing that he promised it and he said
[1:56:11] his word it creates a power that goes
[1:56:14] out yonder
[1:56:15] and brings things to pass things that is
[1:56:18] not it makes
[1:56:19] he said them as they as they were
[1:56:23] as they are because two omnipotents have
[1:56:26] met
[1:56:27] but first a man fully must be fully
[1:56:30] surrendered

[2:00:45] he said and then if satan could put that
[2:00:47] kind of power on a
[2:00:48] man fully surrendered to him he said how
[2:00:51] much
[2:00:52] more can the power and the holy spirit
[2:00:55] put on a man that surrendered to him to
[2:00:57] make a person in a wheelchair rise and
[2:00:59] walk
[2:01:02] to make a shadow of a man dying with
[2:01:04] cancer get off the
[2:01:05] cot and jump from his feet screaming
[2:01:07] under the power of god
[2:01:10] whole church always surrendered i tell

[2:01:32] he said uh you don't want me to do
[2:01:33] anything no he's he's

[2:01:56] in the house

[2:02:00] in the word of god and say lord i want
[2:02:02] more of you

[2:02:09] god and saying god
[2:02:10] i need more of you i want you you could
[2:02:13] change an old baptist boy that was with
[2:02:15] a broke up home he could change anybody
[2:02:19] family that's broke up wherever i went i
[2:02:21] i couldn't even sign up the military
[2:02:22] quick enough
[2:02:23] i said lord tom dad i brought the little
[2:02:25] sheep to him he said where are you going

[2:02:38] it straightened me up real quick
[2:02:41] but i'll tell you the best thing that
[2:02:42] really happened to me is when i met
[2:02:44] jesus
[2:02:45] and when i when i heard that when i
[2:02:46] heard the prophet my grandmother one
[2:02:48] time
[2:02:49] she's 83 years old today she's the only
[2:02:51] one she handed me two messages right
[2:02:52] before i left for the basic training
[2:02:54] she handed me a jezebel religion and why
[2:02:57] were you denying a nomination
[2:02:59] i wore them tapes out and it wore me out
[2:03:02] i tell you what but i needed it but
[2:03:05] there's sometimes we got to get fully
[2:03:07] surrendered to god say lord
[2:03:08] whatever it is take it from me if it's
[2:03:11] what i'm looking at it's what i'm doing
[2:03:13] and what
[2:03:14] take it from it get take that desire
[2:03:16] from it
[2:03:19] we got to put the devil back in his
[2:03:21] place tonight i thought about
[2:03:23] coming over here the the maniac from
[2:03:25] godera
[2:03:26] you know here he comes up to jesus and
[2:03:28] here it is he says
[2:03:30] even jesus says wash thy name but jesus
[2:03:32] knew the name

[2:03:36] many
[2:03:38] he's over here fully surrendered to the
[2:03:39] devil and got full of demons and the
[2:03:41] demons started crying out saying
[2:03:43] basically can i go down then with swine
[2:03:45] right there
[2:03:47] and he let him go down the swine they
[2:03:48] ran off into the sea and all they
[2:03:50] they all died but i tell we got to get
[2:03:53] surrendered to jesus and say
[2:03:54] i'm not just talking about quoting

[2:03:59] quote in the book or say hey i'm in the
[2:04:01] message

[2:04:20] word of god and prays

[2:04:28] prophet this last age
[2:04:29] that sent a prophet in this age to give

[2:05:05] clean out our life
[2:05:06] and let us get surrendered to jesus
[2:05:08] christ like my brother was saying

[2:05:15] business
[2:05:17] every time i get up i say lord i want to
[2:05:19] be i want to do something for you

[2:05:23] i don't care if they're on my job site
[2:05:25] and they never heard the message before
[2:05:26] i still want to encourage them because i
[2:05:29] was the same person in that chicken yard
[2:05:33] and then she handed me two tapes at
[2:05:34] night i'll never forget i was driving
[2:05:37] and i got to the barracks and i got to
[2:05:39] the bottom i probably burned the whole

[2:06:07] best thing you could ever do
[2:06:11] but i started thinking about that and
[2:06:13] thinking about how blessed we are but i
[2:06:16] tell you

[2:06:51] a truly dedicated surrendered life
[2:06:55] and say lord maybe i've been playing in
[2:06:58] church
[2:06:59] maybe i just come because the door says
[2:07:01] come open
[2:07:02] but i tell you every time i say i think
[2:07:04] about church my brother
[2:07:05] the boy i know he's wore out but he was
[2:07:07] telling me he was crying and crying and
[2:07:09] crying ready to go home
[2:07:10] i said son but one i said one soul's

[2:07:27] one soul but we got to be born
[2:07:31] in jesus christ and brother brown talks
[2:07:35] about in the church age books he said
[2:07:36] denominations are coming together
[2:07:38] he said by the will of man by the will
[2:07:41] of man he says in the church age books
[2:07:44] not the will of god but the will of a
[2:07:45] system
[2:07:47] but your bride tonight is gathered i'm
[2:07:49] just saying this tonight out of my own
[2:07:51] saying
[2:07:51] the bride together has gathered tonight
[2:07:55] united under jesus christ they had the
[2:07:58] will of
[2:07:59] man but we have the will of god
[2:08:02] we have the will of god tonight
[2:08:05] for a prophet to say he read that book i
[2:08:07] think it was a church ages book
[2:08:08] i think it was 12 times and then he
[2:08:10] signed it
[2:08:12] i tell you why that makes me want to
[2:08:13] just get in even more
[2:08:15] say lord i want to read it keep reading
[2:08:17] we're starting to start to open the
[2:08:18] church age books and
[2:08:19] the boys just started in sunday sunday
[2:08:21] school back at home
[2:08:23] back in church isaac's class
[2:08:26] and i tell you i was like lord help me
[2:08:29] not just these little kids but help me
[2:08:33] lily said colossians 1 16-17
[2:08:36] for by him were all things created that
[2:08:39] are in heaven that are in earth visible
[2:08:42] and invisible whether they be thrones
[2:08:44] and dominions of principalities and
[2:08:46] powers
[2:08:47] all things were created by him and for
[2:08:50] him and he is before all things and by
[2:08:53] him all things consist
[2:08:56] so what we worried about tonight while
[2:08:58] we care about tonight
[2:08:59] all things were created by him and for
[2:09:01] him tonight
[2:09:03] if they create a virus or a virus shows
[2:09:05] i don't care
[2:09:06] i just go back to the word of god and
[2:09:08] say greater is he that's in me that he
[2:09:10] that's in the world
[2:09:14] brother says i was looking this up he
[2:09:16] said he is a sovereign god
[2:09:18] he said by his own counsel he purposed
[2:09:21] the plan
[2:09:22] the plane of the salvation of his own
[2:09:24] elect
[2:09:25] which he foreknew he said the son died
[2:09:28] upon the cross
[2:09:29] to establish the means of salvation and
[2:09:31] the holy spirit carefully executes
[2:09:34] the will of the father he said he's
[2:09:37] willing
[2:09:37] he's working all things at this moment
[2:09:40] according to his purpose and his own
[2:09:42] will
[2:09:44] he said he's right in the midst of it
[2:09:46] all
[2:09:47] he is in the midst of his church he said
[2:09:50] the great creator
[2:09:52] savior god is faithful working amongst
[2:09:54] us his own right now
[2:09:56] as the great shepherd of the sheep
[2:10:01] isn't that wonderful he said his very
[2:10:04] existence is for his own
[2:10:06] he loves them and cares for them his eye
[2:10:08] is
[2:10:09] ever upon them amen oh i should
[2:10:12] ignite you tonight he said when the word
[2:10:15] says that your lives
[2:10:17] are hid with christ in god colossians 3
[2:10:21] he said oh i am so glad my god abides
[2:10:24] faithfully
[2:10:26] he is true to himself he won't lie he is
[2:10:29] the true to the word
[2:10:30] he will back it up he is true to us
[2:10:34] he will lose none of us but raise us up
[2:10:36] in the last day

[2:10:40] faithfulness

[2:24:06] that if we get fully surrendered and i'm
[2:24:08] just telling you a personal testimony of
[2:24:10] myself

[2:24:36] telling you tonight god wants to do
[2:24:37] something for you
[2:24:39] god wants to move something out of your
[2:24:40] life that you put before god

[2:24:56] your life and you he'll become fully
[2:24:58] surrendered
[2:24:59] not just saying i'm living this message
[2:25:01] or i believe malachi 4. the devil
[2:25:03] believes brother brown
[2:25:06] he knows the quotes he knows he's a
[2:25:08] prophet
[2:25:10] he knows it all but he wants to see a
[2:25:13] life
[2:25:15] he said i can see he said when the
[2:25:16] weakest christian gets to his knees the
[2:25:18] devil trembles
[2:25:20] the weakest christian could you imagine
[2:25:23] a fully surrendered life
[2:25:24] that's praying day and night and reading
[2:25:26] the word of god
[2:25:27] and keeping their face in the book
[2:25:30] could you imagine when you get on your
[2:25:32] knees what it does to the devil
[2:25:34] they don't just make them tremble
[2:25:37] i can't imagine but i'm just here
[2:25:39] tonight and
[2:25:40] god bless you but i'm just here to tell
[2:25:42] you tonight a fully surrendered cry for
[2:25:44] jesus
[2:25:46] a dedicated life and i just admitted to
[2:25:48] you tonight
[2:25:49] that was set that was over eight years
[2:25:51] ago that we were doing it completely
[2:25:52] wrong
[2:25:53] i was listening to the tapes i was
[2:25:55] hearing the mess i really wasn't even
[2:25:57] hearing it
[2:25:58] i just pushed play we were listening
[2:26:00] sometimes in our house
[2:26:01] and it really just was background noise
[2:26:04] i'm here to tell you tonight it's
[2:26:06] real that i was pushing play and
[2:26:09] well i'm listening to the prophet i'm
[2:26:11] okay
[2:26:13] no it's about getting truly with god
[2:26:16] saying god
[2:26:17] you feel my vessel you come down
[2:26:20] and you take all the trash out and y'all
[2:26:23] want to be crystal clear
[2:26:25] i want to live for this word i will live
[2:26:27] for this message my whole life
[2:26:29] but i call the message christ because
[2:26:31] brother branham said
[2:26:32] the message is christ i want to live for
[2:26:36] the one that died on the cross
[2:26:38] that rose again in three days that had
[2:26:41] the keys to death hell and the grave
[2:26:44] that when we pass away it's just
[2:26:46] stepping into without theophany
[2:26:48] how glorious will it be i don't like
[2:26:51] playing flights we were flying the plane
[2:26:52] the boys were like well you know dad
[2:26:54] well you know if we crash we just we
[2:26:56] just crash we die anyway you know
[2:26:58] i said praise god praise god if we go
[2:27:01] down we just
[2:27:02] we just step on over like that song says
[2:27:05] we'll they'll we'll speed up they'll
[2:27:07] slow down
[2:27:08] i'm looking for that city i see it
[2:27:11] coming down church i believe it's so
[2:27:13] plain view right now i believe it's
[2:27:15] coming in plain view
[2:27:17] the bride his brother brown said he said
[2:27:19] one place and close it
[2:27:20] he said one place he said he said the
[2:27:22] bride he said it has everything she has
[2:27:24] need of right now
[2:27:26] he says this brother brown says she has
[2:27:28] everything she has need of
[2:27:30] to get out of here he's just waiting for
[2:27:33] one of us to catch up
[2:27:35] i don't know if it's one of you tonight
[2:27:37] i don't know what it is
[2:27:39] but we gotta get about the father's
[2:27:41] business and step out by faith
[2:27:44] and you just believe it's more than just
[2:27:46] saying i know a quote
[2:27:48] but to truly get down and listen and say
[2:27:50] lord what are you saying to me in this
[2:27:52] tape
[2:27:53] what are you saying to me in the word of
[2:27:55] god
[2:27:57] change me take it all out of me
[2:28:00] and i believe that's what god wants us
[2:28:02] to do as brother reggie was saying
[2:28:03] he was speaking already kind of a little
[2:28:05] bit on the lines of
[2:28:07] talking about his testimony and how an
[2:28:09] eagle just
[2:28:10] coming down soaring down and you know
[2:28:13] just changing his life and how he grew
[2:28:14] up in the message
[2:28:16] it blessed my heart grew up in the
[2:28:18] message and heard all the tapes and
[2:28:20] judging this and judging that but one
[2:28:21] day he got an experience
[2:28:24] that's where it's at it's a truly
[2:28:27] experience
[2:28:28] and a true experience with god will
[2:28:30] change you the rest of your life
[2:28:32] it'll take whatever you had of the world
[2:28:34] out it'll take the desires out to taste
[2:28:37] out
[2:28:37] everything take it all out
[2:28:43] he'll take it that's our god
[2:28:47] as we close tonight i'm gonna read this
[2:28:50] last one and we're gonna close that
[2:28:51] maybe the musicians come
[2:28:53] i want to read this last quote it says
[2:28:55] now if god did not spare his son
[2:28:58] from this cruel testing then he will not
[2:29:00] spare you
[2:29:02] or i from this cruel testing he said in
[2:29:05] jesus
[2:29:05] he said was here confronting the
[2:29:07] greatest test that he and this is where
[2:29:09] i was reading from
[2:29:10] not my will but that will be done he
[2:29:13] says in jesus
[2:29:14] i looked this up he said jesus was here
[2:29:16] confronting the greatest test
[2:29:18] that he ever had gethsemane laid just
[2:29:21] before him
[2:29:23] where that once and final all sufficient
[2:29:25] tests must come
[2:29:27] he said when the burdens of the entire
[2:29:30] world laid upon his blessed shoulder
[2:29:34] he said there was no one in all of
[2:29:37] heaven's
[2:29:38] or earth could ever stood in it but him
[2:29:41] he said and to know thank you and to
[2:29:44] know that
[2:29:45] all of the sins and past sins and
[2:29:48] present sins
[2:29:49] and future sins rested upon his decision
[2:29:54] think about that tonight just think on
[2:29:55] that in closing
[2:29:59] he said and it was one of the most
[2:30:01] greatest victories that christ
[2:30:03] ever won he said or proved his great
[2:30:06] messiahship
[2:30:07] he says as when he said to god not my
[2:30:10] will
[2:30:11] thine be done he said that was the
[2:30:14] greatest
[2:30:15] victory that he'd ever won he said all
[2:30:18] of the demons of torment was around to
[2:30:21] tempt him and try him
[2:30:23] but he said not my will but thing be
[2:30:26] done
[2:30:28] as they play something softly tonight
[2:30:29] thing i want you to think just for a few
[2:30:31] minutes i know they're fixing to change
[2:30:32] this order of the service to the
[2:30:34] baptismal praise god
[2:30:36] someone taking on the name of jesus what
[2:30:38] better thing can you do but take on
[2:30:40] jesus name
[2:30:42] get rid of your last name and say lord i
[2:30:45] want your name
[2:30:46] what better thing to do tonight is just
[2:30:48] to stop and see someone else go to a
[2:30:50] watery grave come up
[2:30:52] and get the name of jesus christ and get
[2:30:54] more of a surrender life to jesus
[2:30:58] i think we all can can have can all grow
[2:31:00] closer to jesus
[2:31:02] as the days are approaching we see evil
[2:31:04] in every corner
[2:31:06] everything's changing this and that the
[2:31:09] throughout everything is changing but
[2:31:11] one thing
[2:31:12] god has got a people just fixing to get
[2:31:14] out of here
[2:31:16] and he's waiting for the bride to make
[2:31:17] herself ready he's wanting you to get
[2:31:19] closer to him
[2:31:20] wants you to love him more wants you to
[2:31:22] read his love language this is a love
[2:31:24] book tonight

[2:38:59] me my life is
[2:39:16] my life is not my own
[2:39:20] to you i belong
[2:39:25] [Music]
[2:39:33] amen tonight brother joseph would you go
[2:39:36] take your son to get ready
[2:39:39] for baptism
[2:39:41] [Music]
[2:39:44] you know there's a a great reason
[2:39:49] [Music]
[2:39:50] for reading this book
[2:39:54] and it goes beyond
[2:39:58] doctrine and right because
[2:40:02] in this book you read about men
[2:40:06] and you read about women and you read
[2:40:09] about
[2:40:09] circumstances and situations
[2:40:13] you read about a man that
[2:40:16] had a prodigal son right right
[2:40:20] you read about a husband and wife who
[2:40:25] had a demon-possessed boy
[2:40:29] and can you read those stories and what
[2:40:32] you see
[2:40:33] all through this scripture is the
[2:40:35] supernatural
[2:40:39] you have a testimony of
[2:40:42] a god that works supernaturally
[2:40:48] and
[2:40:49] [Music]
[2:40:52] when you can sit back and you can see
[2:40:54] that is god
[2:40:58] and that's what god does and then you
[2:41:01] can start to say
[2:41:02] that's what i want in my life
[2:41:07] i want the supernatural in my life
[2:41:10] what he's done in this book i can see
[2:41:14] in my life because he's the same
[2:41:18] yesterday
[2:41:22] today and
[2:41:25] tomorrow it's
[2:41:29] brother true says you know isn't it
[2:41:31] man's always looking back at what god's
[2:41:33] done
[2:41:35] he's always looking forward to what he
[2:41:38] thinks that god might do
[2:41:40] but he never realizes that he's there to
[2:41:43] do the supernatural
[2:41:44] for you right now
[2:41:48] and when young people when we talk about
[2:41:51] inviting god
[2:41:53] into your life
[2:41:56] we're not talking about providing you
[2:42:00] some new rules to live by that's right
[2:42:04] or just getting all the music we don't
[2:42:07] like
[2:42:09] out of your life but we're talking about
[2:42:13] you
[2:42:14] you coming in contact with something
[2:42:16] that's supernatural
[2:42:19] and that can do things for you
[2:42:25] they can be real and and
[2:42:28] and i i just believe that i i really
[2:42:31] enjoyed that tonight
[2:42:33] it meant a lot to me because
[2:42:36] of course you know it probably meant a
[2:42:38] lot to you because of wednesday
[2:42:40] night and of what we preached
[2:42:44] and they just like a little confirmation
[2:42:46] of the lord
[2:42:47] coming standing right behind that that
[2:42:51] it it's so on
[2:42:54] the right track that that supernatural
[2:42:57] god
[2:42:59] is what's working in our midst what's
[2:43:01] working for our young people what's
[2:43:03] working for our children
[2:43:05] every bible story can be recreated
[2:43:10] in this bride in this hour
[2:43:13] today amen i i've got
[2:43:18] great things i'm looking forward to glad
[2:43:21] to do
[2:43:23] i've told people many things i've told
[2:43:26] people
[2:43:26] one day you'll see that person walk
[2:43:28] through those doors
[2:43:30] and be in fellowship and it's gonna
[2:43:32] happen
[2:43:33] [Music]
[2:43:35] you know i'm leaving for your son you
[2:43:39] know that don't you
[2:43:41] yeah i just know it's gonna happen
[2:43:45] as sure as i'm alive
[2:43:49] i know there's someone coming back
[2:43:53] because i know what's in his heart and i
[2:43:54] know what he's made from and i know
[2:43:56] where he comes from
[2:43:57] and i know a supernatural god that can
[2:44:00] perform it
[2:44:01] right amen don't you love them tonight
[2:44:04] didn't that encourage you tonight
[2:44:06] didn't it press you that the only way
[2:44:09] i'm going to get
[2:44:10] into this supernatural is to get out
[2:44:13] of the natural the carnal mind is enemy
[2:44:18] with god but the spiritual mind is life
[2:44:21] and liberty let's believe
[2:44:24] let's believe big things let's
[2:44:27] ask big let's ask for the supernatural

[2:53:16] hey man i'm sure if someone has a camera

[2:53:20] naturally
[2:53:21] you can come right up close or go around
[2:53:24] whatever you want to do okay
[2:53:26] amen you love the lord tonight
[2:53:29] you know i i wondered
[2:53:32] quite a bit about baptizing
[2:53:36] children and and that you know i thought
[2:53:40] quite about it and then i came up
[2:53:45] upon a statement where the prophet of
[2:53:47] god talked about
[2:53:49] children being baptized and it really
[2:53:52] moved me and
[2:53:53] and i also thought about it a long time
[2:53:55] is you never
[2:53:56] ever keep somebody from doing the right
[2:53:58] thing
[2:54:00] you know what i mean and i've baptized
[2:54:04] people over again that have been
[2:54:07] baptized i've had people come to me that
[2:54:11] wanted to re be re-baptized but
[2:54:15] really what they needed to do was be
[2:54:17] rededicated
[2:54:19] so we never know all the circumstances
[2:54:22] behind
[2:54:22] everything but i just know that this
[2:54:24] young man wanted to be baptized
[2:54:27] and it's a right thing to do and it's
[2:54:29] what we teach to do
[2:54:32] um and i know he's
[2:54:36] sincere in what he's doing and he told
[2:54:39] me he says well i'm gonna
[2:54:40] have to start being nicer to my brother
[2:54:44] so that's good enough for me amen
[2:54:48] so we really appreciate it tonight so
[2:54:50] let's look at turning our bodies you're
[2:54:52] welcome to be seated you're welcome to
[2:54:53] stay standing whatever is
[2:54:55] most comfortable for you this evening
[2:54:59] as we uh look in our bibles and
[2:55:03] we turn into the book of acts and
[2:55:08] we know that at that
[2:55:11] time of the passover that
[2:55:16] the disciples had been in the upper room
[2:55:20] and they were waiting there until they
[2:55:24] were
[2:55:26] well what they were waiting for they
[2:55:28] were waiting for the return of jesus
[2:55:31] christ
[2:55:32] to them that's what they were waiting
[2:55:35] for
[2:55:36] because he promised that i'll be with
[2:55:38] you even in you till the end i will not
[2:55:40] leave you comfortless
[2:55:42] but i personal pronoun will come again
[2:55:45] and i will be with you even in you
[2:55:49] so they were there waiting for
[2:55:52] his return and they were waiting there
[2:55:57] and he came and he
[2:56:00] manifested himself in the form of the
[2:56:03] pillars of fire
[2:56:05] all in that room because that's the way
[2:56:07] he was going to be
[2:56:08] in the church from then on and so
[2:56:12] they they were there and they received
[2:56:14] this
[2:56:15] great presence of the lord
[2:56:19] and because that was the thing that was
[2:56:23] to be
[2:56:24] so he came out and they said these men
[2:56:26] are drunk he says no
[2:56:28] this is what was prophesied
[2:56:31] i'll pour out my spirit upon my sons and
[2:56:34] daughters
[2:56:35] they shall dream dreams they shall see
[2:56:37] vision this is it
[2:56:39] this is that yeah right amen and
[2:56:43] and this is the life
[2:56:47] that we want to bring we
[2:56:50] we're moving past the doctrine of the
[2:56:54] message
[2:56:55] to a life that possesses
[2:56:58] the doctrine but also has the power
[2:57:03] if there's ever a time that the power
[2:57:05] and the doctrine
[2:57:06] are becoming one that produces the full
[2:57:09] life of christ so we're happy to baptize
[2:57:12] our brother
[2:57:15] and it says here and he says and when
[2:57:19] they heard this
[2:57:21] they were pricked in their heart
[2:57:24] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:57:26] apostles
[2:57:28] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:57:34] now peter's got the commission doesn't
[2:57:36] he he knows exactly what to do
[2:57:40] do the word of god right and then peter
[2:57:43] said unto them
[2:57:44] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:57:48] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:57:50] remission of sins
[2:57:52] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:57:54] holy ghost
[2:57:56] for the promise is unto you and to your
[2:57:59] children
[2:58:01] and to all that are afar off even as
[2:58:04] many as the lord our god shall call
[2:58:08] and with many other words did he testify
[2:58:11] and exhort
[2:58:12] saying save yourselves from this upwards
[2:58:15] generation and they that gladly received
[2:58:19] his word
[2:58:19] were baptized and the same day were
[2:58:23] added unto them
[2:58:24] about 3 000 souls amen he's still
