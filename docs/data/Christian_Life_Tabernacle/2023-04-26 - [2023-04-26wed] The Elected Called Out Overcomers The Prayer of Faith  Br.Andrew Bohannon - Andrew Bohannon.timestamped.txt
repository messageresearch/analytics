[38:30] Heavenly Father
[38:32] Lord Jesus you know God what we have
[38:35] need of
[38:36] Lord what a sacred hour what a sacred
[38:39] time it is Lord to be gathered around

[39:11] keep us from receiving what you have
[39:13] tonight we we call upon thy great name
[39:16] we bind it in the name of Jesus
[39:19] Lord we ask that Liberty would be in our
[39:22] heart Lord to claim oh God what you
[39:25] purchased for us Lord May nothing stand
[39:28] in our way o God we know that you you
[39:31] promised that if we would pray oh God
[39:34] that we could receive from you o God and
[39:37] that's what we're asking tonight
[39:38] something from you Lord Jesus so we
[39:41] commit the service we commit the request
[39:44] the burdens in our heart Lord we we just
[39:48] pray that you would speak o God and
[39:50] Supply food from the storehouse tonight
[39:54] Lord and when we leave here Lord we can
[39:57] say surely the Lord met us
[40:00] at our place of need and brought
[40:02] spiritual food in due season for we
[40:05] commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ
[40:09] amen and amen praise the lord well while
[40:12] you're standing I want to invite you to
[40:13] open into the word of God we just have a
[40:16] little thought and we don't anticipate
[40:18] being long and um
[40:21] we just trust that we can
[40:23] deliver what's on our heart and we'll
[40:25] all be blessed
[40:28] remember brother Billy while he's
[40:30] traveling he's ministering away and
[40:33] trust the Lord will be his fortune
[40:35] certainly have been appreciating the
[40:38] studying Nehemiah and Lord really just
[40:40] dealt with my heart in a sovereign way
[40:42] and so
[40:44] it's just special so if you want to turn
[40:48] with me we're just going to go to
[40:49] Hebrews chapter 11.
[40:51] we'll read one and two there and then
[40:55] also Hebrews chapter 12.
[40:59] Hebrews chapter 11.
[41:10] the scripture says now Faith is the
[41:12] substance of things hoped for the
[41:15] evidence of Things Not Seen
[41:18] for by it the elders obtained a good
[41:21] report and we know that Faith cometh by
[41:24] hearing and hearing by the word and we
[41:26] also know that it can never be
[41:28] overemphasized the need to call upon God
[41:30] for Revelation and we know Revelation
[41:32] and Faith are one in the same so when we
[41:35] pray we can have a hope that what we've
[41:37] received is from God because it's in his
[41:39] word amen and then also we'll turn in
[41:42] Hebrews chapter 12.
[41:44] verses 1 and 2.
[41:48] amen wherefore seen we also are
[41:52] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[41:55] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[41:59] in the Sin which doeth so easily beset
[42:03] us
[42:03] and let us run with patience the race
[42:07] that is set before us amen and we just
[42:10] want to read one more found in James one
[42:13] more chapter over in
[42:16] chapter 5 of James
[42:25] chapter 5 and
[42:27] verses 11 through 20. behold
[42:31] we count them happy which endureth
[42:34] ye have heard the patience of Job and
[42:37] have seen the end of the Lord
[42:39] and the Lord is very pitiful and of
[42:42] tender Mercy
[42:44] but Above All Things my brethren swear
[42:46] not neither by Heaven neither by Earth
[42:49] neither by any other oath but let your
[42:53] yea be ye in your Navy nay lest ye fall
[42:56] into condemnation
[42:58] is any mayor is any among you Afflicted
[43:01] let him pray
[43:04] if is any Mary let him sing Psalms
[43:08] if any among you is there any among you
[43:12] let him call upon thee is any sick among
[43:15] you let him call for the Elders of the
[43:18] church and let them pray over him
[43:21] anointing him with oil in the name of
[43:24] the Lord
[43:25] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[43:27] sick and the Lord shall raise him up
[43:29] and if he hath committed sins they shall
[43:32] be forgiven him confess your faults one
[43:35] to another and pray one for another that
[43:39] ye may be healed the effectual fervent
[43:42] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[43:45] Elias was a man subject to like passions
[43:49] as we are and he prayed earnestly that
[43:52] he might that it might not Reign and it
[43:55] rained not
[43:56] on the Earth by the space of three years
[43:59] and six months
[44:01] why
[44:03] and he prayed again and the heavens gave
[44:05] rain and the Earth brought forth their
[44:07] fruit
[44:08] Brethren if any of you do error from the
[44:11] truth and one converteth him let him
[44:14] know that he that converteth the sinner
[44:17] from his
[44:19] The Sinner from the error of his way
[44:22] shall save a soul from death
[44:25] and shall hide a multitude of sin hey
[44:28] man we're just a little out of blessing
[44:29] to the reading of his word you may have
[44:32] your seed
[44:36] you know I was really um
[44:39] moved on
[44:40] this past weekend as our pastor
[44:43] just went into Nehemiah and you know in
[44:47] his introduction to the service I
[44:49] believe it was Sunday morning he said
[44:51] you know sometimes you you
[44:54] um you can't be helped if you don't
[44:56] realize
[44:57] that you're lacking something
[45:00] and my you know there was just so much
[45:02] depth to the to the messages over the
[45:06] weekend
[45:07] but you know sometimes when when the
[45:09] Lord starts dealing with you on a
[45:11] subject you know every single scripture
[45:13] every single quote and there's just
[45:15] becomes a constant
[45:18] um something is highlighted something
[45:20] just keeps popping out I don't know if
[45:22] it's the same for you but you know I
[45:24] just remember you know when it came time
[45:27] to be re-baptized you know and I saw it
[45:29] in the scripture every time I played a
[45:31] tape or every time I was fellowshipping
[45:33] with somebody then they would say oh you
[45:35] know when I was re-baptizing then you'd
[45:37] be like oh my goodness here it is you
[45:39] know and so you know that the Lord's
[45:41] dealing with you in that particular
[45:43] season amen so that's when I began to
[45:45] realize is you know as as we're looking
[45:49] at
[45:50] um you know the burden that Nehemiah had
[45:53] and now he's he's building this wall and
[45:55] it's lacking unto us where we're at in
[45:57] the season we're building a church and
[45:59] you know I begin to see that you know
[46:01] many times you know we move forward to
[46:05] do something for the Lord and you know
[46:07] we find ourselves kind of lagging behind
[46:09] or failing in something and you know you
[46:12] just kind of wonder what what's wrong
[46:13] here you know the the sufficiency of the
[46:16] word is there but some sometimes it's
[46:19] just not moving the program of God's not
[46:21] moving
[46:24] and so it makes us search back and turn
[46:26] every stone and we begin to see
[46:29] you know what is it Lord what is it and
[46:32] so I began to see that
[46:34] part of what we're dealing with you know
[46:37] personally is sometimes we get to
[46:40] you know I'll say it like this when
[46:42] Brother David said we know when we build
[46:43] the new church you know we're going to
[46:45] have room so get ready there'll be
[46:48] plenty of room to run
[46:50] but don't run without the spirit
[46:52] and boy I tell you that really that
[46:55] really touched my heart you know
[46:57] because really once the Lord moves we
[47:00] want to follow the leading of the Lord
[47:01] and all of what is in here we want we
[47:03] want amen
[47:05] so if it's in the word it's for you amen
[47:08] if it's not in the word we don't want it
[47:10] just leave it alone
[47:12] so I got to thinking about you know
[47:15] you know
[47:17] the little subject that's on my heart is
[47:20] is
[47:21] you know the the prayer of faith you
[47:24] know and a lot of times
[47:27] you know like brother Branham said and I
[47:29] I have some quotes here and I don't know
[47:31] exactly how we'll
[47:32] the Lord how many of them I'll read but
[47:34] just trust that whatever you came for
[47:37] you just pull right out of the message
[47:38] amen and so you know a lot of times you
[47:42] know brother Branham said in in the
[47:45] patma's vision
[47:46] you know he said uh a lot of times you
[47:49] know
[47:51] you know we John when he was caught up
[47:53] he was going to see Christ in the future
[47:57] ages and not just see Christ working in
[48:00] the future ages but to see his Works
[48:02] amen and so but it it really he he had
[48:06] to be caught up in the spirit in the
[48:08] Lord's Day
[48:09] amen and and that's just the thing you
[48:12] know we don't want to run without the
[48:14] spirit amen we don't want to we don't
[48:16] want to sing without the spirit
[48:18] we don't want to pray without the spirit
[48:19] we don't want to even move without the
[48:21] spirit many times we find ourselves
[48:23] moving doing things because it's
[48:25] scriptural but we still haven't waited
[48:27] on the Lord we still haven't moved
[48:29] forward in the spirit of Christ
[48:32] and I begin to see oh God have I made
[48:36] prayer a tradition
[48:38] have I have I prayed the right prayer
[48:41] but failed to get in the spirit
[48:43] many times we know that the the faith
[48:46] that we have is a conquering Faith but
[48:49] many times we just know that it's the
[48:52] truth but yet we fail to get in the
[48:54] spirit
[48:55] the devil don't care your Creeds and
[48:57] your dogmas and even if you have the
[48:59] right Doctrine but if you move forward
[49:01] without the spirit it'll be of not it
[49:04] won't be a pure worship God's wanting
[49:06] worshipers that'll get into the spirit
[49:09] of the message not just the doctrines
[49:18] sometimes we run in headlong to trials
[49:21] and things it's because God's saying
[49:23] maybe you didn't go in the spirit
[49:26] you know we needed healing just like you
[49:29] said in the church age book and he said
[49:31] if if we would see it's a promise in the
[49:34] word of God and know that God can't fail
[49:36] and God's for you and he's already paid
[49:39] the price and you're a Believer this is
[49:42] your inheritance many times he said we
[49:44] just failed to get in the spirit of it
[49:47] man
[49:48] and then I begin to see Lord
[49:51] I see that what you're trying to build
[49:54] in my life in us as a church body is not
[49:58] a bunch of nicolaitanism like the only
[50:01] one that can pray for you is is the song
[50:04] leader or or the pastor or a minister or
[50:08] the teacher or the Deacon or the ones
[50:10] that are workers we don't want to let
[50:13] down our power we don't want to give the
[50:16] devil wants us to just uh uh surrender
[50:20] our weapon
[50:22] he just wants us to say hey that's such
[50:25] and such as obligation you know what I'm
[50:27] going to get him to pray
[50:29] we don't want to lay down our arms we
[50:32] want to be the one that's building part
[50:34] of what God's Building
[50:36] but we got to get into the spirit say
[50:38] this is my part
[50:40] I'm not going to just push it out on
[50:43] them I'm going to go into the storehouse
[50:44] and let God give me spiritual food
[50:48] oh
[50:54] you know it's so important
[50:57] to go back and to feed on
[50:59] you know what what the Lord's leading
[51:02] our pastor in I just thought it was so
[51:04] special sometimes I'll go back and
[51:05] listen and I was like I know I was in
[51:08] the church service but where was I at
[51:10] with that you know many times if we can
[51:13] go back and get into this Spirit say God
[51:15] I know you spoke to me go over your
[51:17] notes look back I believe God wants to
[51:20] meet you at that secret place many times
[51:22] people say well I just want to go over
[51:25] there and pray for them and and lay my
[51:27] hands but you know what there's power in
[51:29] your prayer whether you lay hands or no
[51:31] hands
[51:32] the sexual fervent prayer of the
[51:34] righteous one availeth much you've been
[51:37] entrusted with a sacred virtue God has
[51:40] empowered us it's it's in this invisible
[51:44] Union
[51:45] it's not a public show
[51:50] excuse me
[51:55] you know
[51:58] it's so special
[52:01] to be the called out
[52:04] The Chosen bride
[52:08] um
[52:10] amen
[52:12] you know
[52:14] Brother David said this he said the
[52:16] contents what's being built in the wall
[52:19] it's also what's going to be built in
[52:21] the temple and it struck me you know I
[52:24] don't know what the the exact building
[52:26] materials were in that day but I look at
[52:29] the building materials
[52:30] with building the church and all of the
[52:33] structure and different things but no
[52:35] doubt those walls had some stones in it
[52:37] and we know that he said Upon This Rock
[52:40] I'll build my church and you when he
[52:42] started describing how many how big that
[52:45] wall was you know it's not just one
[52:48] man's Revelation it's every single one
[52:51] of us that have Revelation every single
[52:53] one of us God's dealing with this the
[52:55] youngest to the oldest it doesn't matter
[52:58] we all have a part in the wall because
[53:02] it's it's going to take all of us
[53:04] praying receiving from God it's it's
[53:07] your power against the devil it's your
[53:11] prayer for me it's my prayer for you
[53:12] it's your prayer for those who are
[53:14] outside that still need to come in
[53:17] amen don't let's not let our sword down
[53:19] let's not let our faith down the power
[53:23] of the promise is working in every
[53:25] single body member equally because
[53:27] you're a believer
[53:29] you take God at us at his word you're a
[53:32] Believer it's your inheritance it's your
[53:35] right he purchased it for you
[53:40] don't doubt your weapon
[53:42] don't lay it down
[53:46] those rocks built up and all of those
[53:50] rocks all of those Revelations all of
[53:52] those Believers getting into the spirit
[53:54] that's where things happen
[53:58] that's when the devil starts trembling
[54:01] because now
[54:02] well I think about George Washington you
[54:05] know when he knew that they were given a
[54:07] promise a land of promise they said
[54:10] surely there's got to be a land and they
[54:13] have something to fight for we have
[54:15] something to fight for and you know
[54:16] we're going to have a vision there's
[54:18] there your prayer your faith can really
[54:21] make a difference not just for you
[54:24] you've seen it work for you
[54:26] and a lot of times we can have more
[54:27] faith for somebody else don't lay your
[54:30] weapon down
[54:35] I just think about George Washington you
[54:37] know he could have looked at all of the
[54:39] circumstances
[54:40] but he prayed all night sometimes I
[54:43] can't I realize there's a lot of things
[54:45] that try to just all of a sudden you
[54:47] really want to enter into sort of sacred
[54:49] prayer oh my back itches oh I got to
[54:52] make that phone call like all these
[54:54] voices
[54:55] why is that
[54:57] why is that because prayer is so
[54:59] important we need to get into the spirit
[55:02] you know I was telling my wife oh Monday
[55:05] morning I was like the God is dealing
[55:08] with me so much about prayer I got to
[55:10] cut loose of some things I don't know
[55:12] what I got to do but I gotta tear loose
[55:15] I don't want to have to be stripped I
[55:17] want to let go of some things
[55:21] you know sometimes we get pulled on and
[55:24] then we connect ourselves with things
[55:25] and all of a sudden it takes our
[55:26] affection it takes our attention and all
[55:29] of a sudden when we go to prayer Our
[55:30] channels are all clogged up
[55:33] oh I got this I got that oh I gotta do
[55:35] this I gotta do that forget that I want
[55:38] to lay aside every weight
[55:40] I'm running a race
[55:42] when you're running a race you can't sit
[55:44] there and have a big old long
[55:45] conversation with your buddy or on
[55:47] Instagram or whatever you gotta hey you
[55:49] know what I'm got the destination in
[55:51] mind I'm running I got a pry I got my
[55:54] eyes on a prize
[55:56] amen
[55:58] we don't want to lay down we don't want
[56:00] to let go your position in the body of
[56:03] Christ is so important one star out of
[56:06] place can cause the whole thing to fail
[56:09] it's to create a sobriety God has put a
[56:12] responsibility he's given each and every
[56:14] one of us faith
[56:17] the ability to hear from God
[56:20] you don't know how powerful that is
[56:22] you're just small word of encouragement
[56:25] can change the course of a oh a mother
[56:29] who just lost a child you never know
[56:32] young person you can tell your mom you
[56:34] know I really appreciate that it made
[56:37] such a difference but where do we get
[56:39] that
[56:40] in that secret place
[56:42] he said go to your closet
[56:45] you know sometimes we just need to go
[56:46] into a little fasting of of thankfulness
[56:49] I love that a little fasting and just
[56:52] I'm not gonna get on Instagram today or
[56:55] I'm not gonna hey I'm just gonna take
[56:57] time off of work and make a list of all
[56:59] the things that God's done for me so I
[57:01] can get an attitude of appreciation
[57:03] hey man I think we just need to get a
[57:06] right attitude where we can get into
[57:09] prayer and say God I'm nothing why who
[57:11] am I what am I anyway without you
[57:17] let me enter into prayer God what do you
[57:19] want me to do so many times I get
[57:22] clogged up because it's what I got to do
[57:24] what's my next task
[57:27] oh my
[57:28] we can ever break out of our own spirit
[57:32] say you know I got a lot of questions
[57:33] but forget the questions I want God to
[57:36] speak to me
[57:37] I want to get into a spirit where he can
[57:39] speak to me
[57:41] amen
[57:46] my praise God
[57:49] pray for me something's trying to bug my
[57:51] throat but
[57:53] that Devil's a dumb devil
[58:00] you know
[58:02] what what are we keeping out you know
[58:05] something Brother David said he says
[58:07] what are we keeping out like why do we
[58:10] go into the storehouse why are we
[58:12] feeding on the message why are we
[58:14] digging into the word why are we even
[58:16] praying what are we keeping out well
[58:18] there's a lot of things that try to clog
[58:20] up the channel
[58:22] but I don't want to keep out prayer I
[58:24] don't want to keep out getting into the
[58:26] spirit
[58:27] yeah I just wanted to the Lord was
[58:29] dealing with me like my goodness when
[58:32] the most powerful weapon that has been
[58:35] trusted to man is prayer
[58:39] and the devil fights against that as
[58:41] individuals we come into the house of
[58:44] God we want to get together and we
[58:46] wanted to be strengthened we want to
[58:47] hear from God but that never can take
[58:50] the place of your personal prayer time
[58:55] we must be in prayer and sometimes we're
[58:58] weak in prayer I'm weak in prayer but I
[59:01] tell you if we could ever just get to a
[59:04] place where we can forget about anything
[59:06] everything and just search our heart and
[59:09] say you know let the love that you have
[59:13] for God go out to the needs of your
[59:17] brothers just like it was said here he
[59:20] said
[59:21] you know about praying I think it's our
[59:23] brother James said that he said confess
[59:26] your faults one to another pray one for
[59:28] another
[59:29] you know sometimes we look at ourselves
[59:32] and we judge ourselves in certain ways
[59:34] and we can't really get in the spirit of
[59:36] prayer because of our own Humanity
[59:39] but we can really get in and dig down
[59:42] and get into the spirit for somebody
[59:44] because we're burdened just go ahead and
[59:46] let your heart go out for somebody else
[59:51] you know I I was
[59:53] I was thinking about this and
[59:55] you know
[59:58] it's amazing how
[1:00:01] God deals with us in season and
[1:00:04] you know there's a question and answers
[1:00:06] and you know as you're raising children
[1:00:08] sometimes just having family or personal
[1:00:11] life or business life if you have your
[1:00:13] own business a lot of things they muddy
[1:00:15] up the waters in this real estate up
[1:00:18] here you know this noodle up here got a
[1:00:20] lot of things it's thinking
[1:00:22] but you know
[1:00:24] when we can get into the spirit of
[1:00:26] prayer and realize that God has the
[1:00:28] answer
[1:00:29] and he wants to reveal it and he he
[1:00:31] wants to Quicken our mind to the word
[1:00:34] and so as he he'll point us to a
[1:00:36] scripture all of a sudden or a quote and
[1:00:38] all of a sudden if we're faithful when
[1:00:40] he moves on us
[1:00:42] to get into the spirit of what he's
[1:00:44] trying to say
[1:00:45] and so I begin to realize I'm in a
[1:00:48] season and it's difficult because when I
[1:00:49] go to prayer my mind's drifting to this
[1:00:52] trial to this thing that's bugging me
[1:00:54] it's on me and so I go into the to the
[1:00:57] message and
[1:00:58] you know he said you know about children
[1:01:01] you know sometime and brother Branham
[1:01:03] said you know about one of his his uh
[1:01:05] children he says man she was
[1:01:08] um doing something and it upset Mita and
[1:01:11] he was he was explaining to her hey you
[1:01:14] know um she didn't mean that and I don't
[1:01:17] have the quote exactly right now but
[1:01:18] just paraphrasing and
[1:01:21] you know brother Branham told her he
[1:01:22] said you know
[1:01:24] you know I think it was uh Rebecca was
[1:01:27] starting to play these kind of musics
[1:01:28] that was kind of like a piano from the
[1:01:30] world or something you know and how many
[1:01:33] recall this the testimony
[1:01:36] okay so so you can go check it out for
[1:01:39] yourself and and but brother Brandon was
[1:01:41] saying you know Mita was getting
[1:01:44] um really upset because Rebecca was
[1:01:46] sassing was SASS and media he's like you
[1:01:49] need to go correct her it's like okay
[1:01:51] and so what brother Branham and it so
[1:01:54] blessed my soul because it it reverts
[1:01:56] back to the power of prayer and getting
[1:01:58] into the right Spirit creating the right
[1:02:01] atmosphere see if we get into that
[1:02:03] Shekinah Glory of God and we cultivate a
[1:02:05] real prayer life
[1:02:07] where we're in the spirit when we Face
[1:02:10] the trial it's not the carnal reaction
[1:02:13] because we've drawn from dividends
[1:02:16] we've caught the spirit we know that
[1:02:18] this test God has blessed us with the
[1:02:21] test thinking not strange when you come
[1:02:23] into diverse trials
[1:02:25] it's it's no strange thing in the spirit
[1:02:29] because it's like gold China and fire
[1:02:31] it's like character rising up because
[1:02:34] Christ wants to use you and your faith
[1:02:37] to go and do exploits amen
[1:02:41] so all of a sudden I realize brother
[1:02:43] Branham just in a simple way you know
[1:02:46] honey if Rebecca was going to be dying
[1:02:49] with some kind of disease or something
[1:02:52] it would be the same thing but what
[1:02:54] we're going to do is we're going to get
[1:02:56] right down
[1:02:57] and it's going to be a committal To God
[1:02:59] In Prayer
[1:03:00] right now we're going to put it in the
[1:03:02] hands of God
[1:03:04] the power of committal in prayer and
[1:03:08] really getting into the spirit of the
[1:03:10] promise and leaving it there
[1:03:12] don't pick it back up and start when the
[1:03:15] thoughts come and even the line vanities
[1:03:18] oh she's still doing it she's still this
[1:03:20] oh my I'm sure that the the eyes have a
[1:03:24] lot of hindrance but Faith doesn't have
[1:03:26] a hindrance
[1:03:27] we need to get in prayer and get into
[1:03:29] the spirit that God can give us a
[1:03:32] sovereign Revelation who we are in him
[1:03:36] what his power is through us
[1:03:39] we really want to get into the spirit of
[1:03:41] prayer because we're building a building
[1:03:44] but this is the House of Prayer this is
[1:03:47] where faith can move
[1:03:48] when we've been in prayer in the
[1:03:50] sweetness of the spirit is upon us
[1:03:54] oh just come over into a place where
[1:03:58] just the shadow
[1:04:00] the faith just the shadow can go over
[1:04:04] you sitting next to your brother you
[1:04:07] sitting next to your brother and just
[1:04:08] the shadow because you've been in the
[1:04:11] spirit of God and prayer and the word
[1:04:14] has so embodied you
[1:04:16] that God would be so pleased to take
[1:04:19] your vessel in the shadow
[1:04:22] would bless somebody
[1:04:24] oh my well I want to get into the spirit
[1:04:28] what a value
[1:04:29] I mean there's nothing that the world
[1:04:31] can compare to that
[1:04:34] you talk about a power you see why he
[1:04:36] fights us you see one of the Devils
[1:04:38] coming in
[1:04:40] but God is raising a standard
[1:04:43] he's entrusted you with three sacred
[1:04:46] virtues
[1:04:48] Womanhood
[1:04:50] how our conduct is in the world because
[1:04:53] the church is designated as a woman
[1:04:57] so God is entrusted three sacred virtues
[1:05:00] to the church
[1:05:02] of her Womanhood how she talks her
[1:05:05] manner of living before the world
[1:05:07] how she dresses
[1:05:09] how she honors
[1:05:12] as a Christian to God
[1:05:15] motherhood because God had placed within
[1:05:18] her the ability to bring forth life into
[1:05:22] this world
[1:05:25] not just slopping around with the seed
[1:05:27] of the world but we have the seed word
[1:05:30] of Christ
[1:05:33] and what is it
[1:05:34] to the word of God and the third sacred
[1:05:37] virtue I believe brother Brown says is
[1:05:39] to the word of God and to prayer and to
[1:05:41] Christ
[1:05:42] oh what a virtue
[1:05:45] and to think that you have a hidden
[1:05:47] strength
[1:05:49] we have a hidden strength and it's in
[1:05:51] prayer Amen to take God at his word say
[1:05:54] God this is your word I know that you've
[1:05:57] revealed it to me but oh God let me get
[1:05:59] in the spirit that you can Manifest this
[1:06:01] in me hey man your word can't fail it
[1:06:06] can't lie
[1:06:08] but what do I got to lay aside
[1:06:11] what do I got to lay aside
[1:06:15] have have some kind of entertainment
[1:06:18] some kind of sports taking up too much
[1:06:20] real estate that is clogging the channel
[1:06:22] every time I try to get into that prayer
[1:06:24] all of a sudden now I'm thinking about
[1:06:26] this I'm thinking about that
[1:06:30] we're human
[1:06:32] it happens
[1:06:33] but I say oh God help me get in the
[1:06:35] spirit
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:42] the prayer of faith
[1:06:45] you know that's part of what the the
[1:06:47] elect called out Overcomers that's going
[1:06:50] to be their testimony
[1:06:51] because they had a Sweet Hour of Prayer
[1:06:54] and one day
[1:06:56] when our faith shall be made sight we're
[1:06:59] going to say
[1:07:00] see us wait a Sweet Hour of Prayer
[1:07:03] we won't have to have no more hands laid
[1:07:05] on the sick
[1:07:07] there won't be no more preaching they'll
[1:07:10] just be rejoicing
[1:07:11] you know that's what happens when we get
[1:07:13] into prayer and we get into the spirit
[1:07:15] of prayer all of a sudden God can
[1:07:17] confirm his word and we get to Rejoice
[1:07:19] him we get to thanking God and saying
[1:07:21] praise God my God is alive
[1:07:23] I have the victory in my heart now
[1:07:25] that's what George Washington had he had
[1:07:28] the victory in his heart we came out of
[1:07:29] that all night prayer and he went
[1:07:31] forward he didn't look at the
[1:07:33] circumstance
[1:07:34] there was no hindrance then
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:51] maybe I'll just read a few quotes
[1:07:56] to see what the Lord has for us we
[1:07:59] you know one thing that
[1:08:01] when we're building something you know
[1:08:03] there's there's certain things that have
[1:08:05] to go into the construction
[1:08:07] and so some things are quality building
[1:08:09] materials and some things are not so
[1:08:13] when we're considering the prayer of
[1:08:15] faith and a prayer life and getting into
[1:08:18] the spirit we want to know what prayer
[1:08:20] is and what it's not amen so brother
[1:08:24] Branham makes this statement in 1952 in
[1:08:27] a message called believing God he says
[1:08:29] now God never did have his perfect will
[1:08:33] for a woman and a man to bring four
[1:08:35] children in the Earth
[1:08:36] did you know that God made man himself
[1:08:40] Out of the Dust of the earth and after
[1:08:42] the fall now
[1:08:44] I wouldn't argue about that because you
[1:08:47] know I've got some very funny views on
[1:08:49] it
[1:08:50] but after the fall the woman brought
[1:08:52] four children into the world God told
[1:08:54] her
[1:08:55] because you've taken life out of the
[1:08:56] world
[1:08:57] you have to bring
[1:09:00] it into the world
[1:09:02] look what kind of life it was after sex
[1:09:04] desire fleshly but when but then when
[1:09:08] the body's dying go back to the Earth
[1:09:10] the dust of the earth then God will make
[1:09:13] that Immortal Spirit out of it to the
[1:09:16] kingdom of God and to his throne
[1:09:19] Paradise
[1:09:20] and then on the second coming
[1:09:23] my mother's sitting here and my daddy
[1:09:25] that's gone on will never have to give
[1:09:28] his another body but God will mold one
[1:09:31] that's perfect and immortal and can't
[1:09:34] die
[1:09:36] and Abraham takes Isaac
[1:09:38] and they started towards the mountain
[1:09:40] now in verse 90's taken out of this when
[1:09:43] when Isaac was going to be offered he
[1:09:45] says now
[1:09:47] they came to the place that God had told
[1:09:49] him of and Abraham built an altar
[1:09:53] hmm
[1:09:55] and laid the wood in order and bound
[1:09:58] Isaac his son and laid it upon the altar
[1:10:01] upon the wood
[1:10:03] now just coming
[1:10:06] I can see them coming away
[1:10:09] don't tell Sarah what's going on what
[1:10:11] was going because she would have
[1:10:14] screamed out I believe that it was
[1:10:16] Abraham's faith that performed the
[1:10:18] miracle in Sarah's womb because she
[1:10:21] doubted it even laughed when when it was
[1:10:24] so
[1:10:24] it was Abraham's Faith now brother Brown
[1:10:27] says this in paragraph 107.
[1:10:30] he said so therefore that's the reason
[1:10:32] said the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:10:35] the sick
[1:10:39] and individual's prayer amen it's the
[1:10:42] individual's prayer
[1:10:46] each and every one of us individually
[1:10:49] have this responsibility of prayer the
[1:10:52] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:10:54] man abaileth much
[1:10:57] oh if you only knew that in your hand
[1:11:00] Christ gave us the authority by his name
[1:11:03] by being Christians the most powerful
[1:11:07] weapon
[1:11:09] that has ever known the world has ever
[1:11:12] known
[1:11:12] amen I know you've heard that but I just
[1:11:15] want to excite us to to revive our
[1:11:17] hearts to this reality we're in a war
[1:11:21] this is not a picnic the devil is after
[1:11:24] you the devil's after me
[1:11:26] but in the spirit and receiving
[1:11:29] Revelation it shall not prevail
[1:11:32] it's not our good Doctrine it's not our
[1:11:34] good teaching it's not our good behavior
[1:11:37] it's Revelation by the spirit getting
[1:11:40] into the spirit of prayer to receive the
[1:11:43] spirit of Christ to act out his will
[1:11:46] amen and we can't do it alone a lot of
[1:11:49] times we get we forget
[1:11:53] we get going
[1:11:54] or human ways but it's the most powerful
[1:11:57] weapon ever known amen
[1:12:11] is another place where he speaks on
[1:12:13] prayer
[1:12:16] a message
[1:12:17] down knows to All Things
[1:12:20] 1952 July 16th he said after all friends
[1:12:26] it's the prayer of faith that saves the
[1:12:29] sick
[1:12:30] sometimes I've noticed here a few nights
[1:12:34] I've been watching and I noticed the
[1:12:37] people
[1:12:38] and I come through or maybe they want
[1:12:41] some
[1:12:42] if there's something in their life
[1:12:44] that's just not tallying upright and
[1:12:47] when they do that then we find that out
[1:12:51] then I tell it in the spirit
[1:12:55] and the way it moves they want me to
[1:12:57] pray for them see afterwards they're
[1:13:00] wanting me to pray for them see after
[1:13:02] all
[1:13:03] it's prayer that is the most vital force
[1:13:06] that God ever put in man the hands of
[1:13:09] mankind the the most powerful force
[1:13:13] that's ever been known is prayer do you
[1:13:15] believe that amen
[1:13:18] it's prayer that changes things look at
[1:13:21] Hezekiah when the prophet went and said
[1:13:23] all right Hezekiah you're not coming off
[1:13:27] that bed
[1:13:29] God's done said you're going to die
[1:13:33] right there where you're at and Hezekiah
[1:13:36] if you study it over
[1:13:39] he was he was just 15 years longer now
[1:13:43] remember
[1:13:45] you've got to give God a cause a reason
[1:13:49] now he didn't say just because
[1:13:53] I can get out there and ride around in a
[1:13:56] chariot and show the people that I'm a
[1:13:58] king
[1:13:59] no
[1:14:01] he wanted to rebuild the altars of God
[1:14:03] and a few things that
[1:14:05] to be done to get the kingdom in order
[1:14:08] right well I like that you know just
[1:14:11] like Nehemiah there was something he saw
[1:14:14] and then he began to say you know it was
[1:14:16] for this cause you know we want to
[1:14:18] rebuild and so I just think how this
[1:14:22] is in harmony with that and
[1:14:24] but he says you got to give him a reason
[1:14:26] and he says now this was
[1:14:29] to bring restoration to rebuild the
[1:14:31] altars of God
[1:14:34] and he prayed that God would give him 15
[1:14:36] years longer and he wept bitterly
[1:14:39] just wept to God and he said God I
[1:14:44] beseech you to consider me I've walked
[1:14:46] before you with a perfect heart
[1:14:48] how many can say that tonight we've
[1:14:52] walked before God with a perfect heart
[1:14:54] my
[1:14:57] how many of us can say tonight we walk
[1:14:59] to him I've walked before the Lord with
[1:15:02] a perfect heart and I ask you to
[1:15:04] consider me now I want
[1:15:07] and almighty god Jehovah reconsidered
[1:15:11] the man's case because he prayed
[1:15:13] isn't that wonderful
[1:15:15] to think you know even God had sent the
[1:15:20] prophet over there you're you you're
[1:15:22] you're you're done
[1:15:25] he said wait I have this
[1:15:28] I have this reason why I want to
[1:15:30] continue to live
[1:15:32] you know
[1:15:35] and God has his way of doing look like
[1:15:38] he would have spoken right back and told
[1:15:40] him but I've considered your case again
[1:15:43] and I'm going to let you stay for that
[1:15:47] if you do that
[1:15:49] but how many knows he didn't
[1:15:52] he asked for it
[1:15:55] and he was granted to 15 years
[1:15:57] but he didn't do it
[1:15:59] you see it would have been better for
[1:16:01] him they didn't even get the next 15
[1:16:04] years because he brought a disgrace upon
[1:16:06] the whole nation
[1:16:07] so that's just the thing when we get
[1:16:09] into the spirit of prayer and God gives
[1:16:12] us the revelation
[1:16:13] let's keep the Spirit Alive and revived
[1:16:16] and take courage to do what we said we
[1:16:19] do amen
[1:16:23] this this is not this is not uh what do
[1:16:26] they call that
[1:16:28] play fighting or Shadow Boxing no when
[1:16:31] we take the word and prayer it's because
[1:16:34] we're going after the enemy
[1:16:36] we mean business
[1:16:38] he's taken Souls of man and he's he's
[1:16:42] laid them captive by the thinking of Man
[1:16:45] by Creeds and dogmas he sold lies and
[1:16:49] Corruption many people are in bondage
[1:16:53] to the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:16:55] eyes in the pride of life but brothers
[1:16:58] and sisters before we go to the world
[1:17:02] to make straight the past of all these
[1:17:06] people's lives let's get in there let's
[1:17:07] pray for him let's get into the right
[1:17:10] spirit
[1:17:11] amen so that God his spirit
[1:17:15] can come on the scene in those
[1:17:16] situations and it can be God speaking
[1:17:19] amen we want to get into his spirit it's
[1:17:22] like a man that knows that if he was
[1:17:25] going to a homeless camp and that money
[1:17:29] which I don't necessarily think that's
[1:17:30] the answer but let's say for this cause
[1:17:32] that money was going to be the thing
[1:17:34] that said if if they each one had a
[1:17:36] hundred dollars that would cure them
[1:17:38] so if you went there and you didn't stop
[1:17:41] at the ATM on the way what would that
[1:17:43] say
[1:17:44] no but we got the devil's answer
[1:17:46] amen we need to go into the storehouse
[1:17:48] because this is the very thing that
[1:17:50] God's making a deposit on but we need to
[1:17:52] go into prayer and get into the spirit
[1:17:54] because God wants to speak to your
[1:17:56] situations he wants to give you
[1:17:57] spiritual food in due season that when
[1:17:59] you face the devil in other people's
[1:18:01] lives that God can Quicken something in
[1:18:04] that very hour
[1:18:07] that's our God because he's a living God
[1:18:09] he's not some dead statue he's a
[1:18:13] personal God he wants to meet you in
[1:18:15] that secret place
[1:18:33] now the almighty God reconsidered the
[1:18:36] man's case because he prayed think of
[1:18:37] that the almighty God pronounced death
[1:18:39] on the man who reconsidered it
[1:18:42] amen my that's too much for me great
[1:18:46] Jehovah to a mortal to one of the Earth
[1:18:51] would reconsider his word
[1:18:54] that he said to him
[1:18:56] but God has a way of doing things
[1:19:00] it looked like he would have spoke right
[1:19:02] back and told him but I've considered
[1:19:04] your case again and I'm going to let you
[1:19:07] stay and do that and he didn't
[1:19:11] and he spake to the prophet and sent the
[1:19:13] prophet all the way back there again and
[1:19:16] tell him all right God heard your prayer
[1:19:18] see
[1:19:19] God revealed to the prophet what was
[1:19:21] going to happen and he came back your
[1:19:25] days
[1:19:26] is considered and you're going to come
[1:19:29] off that bed in three days
[1:19:31] so he got some polties
[1:19:35] I just think it's such a paradox you
[1:19:37] know I looked at that you know what
[1:19:39] poltice is
[1:19:42] he got some kind of
[1:19:44] like a a Sav
[1:19:47] it was like a like a natural mud and
[1:19:50] some other things and just laid it on
[1:19:51] him you know we started my mind in this
[1:19:54] story that got supernaturally just
[1:19:55] healed him and he came off the bed but
[1:19:57] sometimes God has something for you to
[1:19:59] do
[1:20:00] sometimes he wants you to get in action
[1:20:02] just like he put on one man he put he
[1:20:05] spit on his eye and put rubbed it on
[1:20:06] another time he got mud and said go wash
[1:20:09] you know sometimes God wants to give you
[1:20:11] a little Revelation now just to see if
[1:20:13] you'll be faithful even though it
[1:20:15] doesn't make sense God's looking for
[1:20:17] obedience God's looking for someone to
[1:20:19] get into the spirit that says I don't
[1:20:21] have to figure this thing out but I just
[1:20:23] want to be led by your spirit isn't it
[1:20:25] what that scripture says the sons of God
[1:20:27] are led by the spirit of God
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:37] we've got some polties and so forth and
[1:20:40] put it on him and Hezekiah came off the
[1:20:42] bed and and was well
[1:20:44] now see what prayer does prayer is not
[1:20:48] exactly bringing God to man
[1:20:51] prayer is not exactly bringing God down
[1:20:54] to man
[1:20:56] it's bringing man up to God see
[1:20:59] as you pray you lose your sign of these
[1:21:03] Earthly things you sway out into
[1:21:05] somewhere else Way Beyond on and on and
[1:21:08] on until you get into his presence
[1:21:11] amen I want to get so far away from what
[1:21:14] I think is important
[1:21:16] oh there's no greater voice there's no
[1:21:19] greater voice of importance but the
[1:21:21] voice of God
[1:21:22] I think it's time for us to check up
[1:21:25] cut away from some things of the world
[1:21:27] I'm talking about I'm I'm preaching to
[1:21:29] me
[1:21:30] I'm talking to flesh
[1:21:33] amen because we want to get into the
[1:21:35] spirit
[1:21:36] get into the spirit of prayer so that
[1:21:39] faith can go to work amen
[1:21:46] and then your faith that you laid it out
[1:21:50] before God
[1:21:51] said now hear God here it is I want to
[1:21:54] get this I want to get well for this
[1:21:57] cause I want you to do this for me for
[1:22:00] this cause I want you to heal me see how
[1:22:03] specific this is and this is a simple
[1:22:05] prayer this is what faith and getting in
[1:22:08] the spirit can manifest amen he says for
[1:22:11] this cause I want you to heal me I don't
[1:22:14] want you to just think it I want you to
[1:22:15] say it in that secret place this is not
[1:22:19] a public show you take God at his word
[1:22:21] in the secret place and when you're in
[1:22:23] the spirit and you speak it you know
[1:22:25] this body must come subject because it's
[1:22:28] God in you amen it's your it's the power
[1:22:31] of God unto salvation that's where
[1:22:33] confession can rise up
[1:22:36] amen but we need to get into the spirit
[1:22:38] and let God do the speaking amen a lot
[1:22:41] of times in prayer we're doing all this
[1:22:42] speaking and like God some Aaron boy and
[1:22:45] we got this laundry list God do this do
[1:22:47] this do this I need a job I need I need
[1:22:49] clothes but he said seek ye first the
[1:22:51] kingdom of God he he closed the birds
[1:22:54] you know they they're all taken care of
[1:22:57] but they're not crying about TB and high
[1:22:59] blood pressure
[1:23:01] God takes care of them how much more you
[1:23:03] a son and daughter of God
[1:23:06] he cares do you care to get away
[1:23:09] and to spend time alone and get into his
[1:23:12] presence and to cut away and forsake all
[1:23:15] others
[1:23:17] yeah a lot of people they they will
[1:23:19] never show up to work late
[1:23:22] but oh my
[1:23:24] there's a lot of hindrances when it
[1:23:25] comes to visiting
[1:23:28] the Lord in in that secret Hour of
[1:23:31] Prayer or in the church house
[1:23:33] we want to honor our faith by honoring
[1:23:36] what we are taught
[1:23:38] let's get on fire let's have our prayer
[1:23:41] life at home when we get here oh I want
[1:23:43] to see you move Lord
[1:23:45] it'll be no surprise when the spirit
[1:23:48] moves because he's already moved on you
[1:23:49] in prayer that morning
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:53] I'm not pushing it off to this brother
[1:23:55] and that brother what is my part I I'm
[1:23:58] obligated because God gave me his spirit
[1:24:03] I am a prisoner of his
[1:24:06] I'm a love slave this is not bondage if
[1:24:09] you feel this bondage it's time to get
[1:24:11] to the altar
[1:24:13] because when you receive Revelation you
[1:24:16] are a millionaire
[1:24:17] in faith
[1:24:19] I mean you feel like oh my I have
[1:24:22] everything because he said he'd give you
[1:24:24] all things
[1:24:25] when you get into the spirit and you can
[1:24:27] see who you are in Christ or you have
[1:24:29] all things
[1:24:30] matter of fact you could see I was there
[1:24:33] when he spoke in creation
[1:24:36] but we're going to get into this period
[1:24:39] and let prayer begin to utter out things
[1:24:42] we know nothing about there's things in
[1:24:44] prayer that we can get to when we cut
[1:24:46] away we know nothing about
[1:24:48] it but he wants to reveal it
[1:24:52] sometimes I feel like
[1:24:54] there's just so much you have bubbling
[1:24:56] on your heart you think about the
[1:24:57] prophet you know he says you know God's
[1:24:59] love is like is and a lot of times the
[1:25:02] Revelation it's like the pressure of a
[1:25:04] fire hydrant but we just need a little
[1:25:06] cup sometime
[1:25:08] just a little cup is all we can handle
[1:25:10] at a time sometimes at least that's the
[1:25:12] way I feel
[1:25:13] Lord so good
[1:25:19] I want to you to heal me from this
[1:25:23] cancer or this TB
[1:25:25] or this anemic condition whatever it is
[1:25:28] I will walk before you
[1:25:31] I will do anything I can
[1:25:34] I will give this testimony
[1:25:36] Everywhere I Go
[1:25:39] I'll be happy to do that Lord
[1:25:42] I will use my life not for myself
[1:25:46] I will use it for your glory to help
[1:25:49] others to see you
[1:25:52] now then you lay that before God and you
[1:25:55] said God will you consider me
[1:25:58] I love that
[1:26:00] isn't that wonderful
[1:26:02] praise God
[1:26:04] well
[1:26:07] praise God
[1:26:10] maybe we'll go another little while
[1:26:14] now
[1:26:17] one thing you don't want to pray for
[1:26:20] brother Brown says this in Christ is a
[1:26:22] mystery
[1:26:23] Christ is revealed in his word pardon me
[1:26:26] in 1965 August 22nd
[1:26:29] he said that's where I I thought of this
[1:26:32] subject
[1:26:33] he was looking at the picture whereas
[1:26:35] the Beatitudes and he saw Christ
[1:26:37] kneeling I believe it was but he says
[1:26:39] now this is where he got the inspiration
[1:26:41] he says Christ and the word is the same
[1:26:45] see they say
[1:26:47] how the Bible people say I was writing
[1:26:51] with a man not long ago he said think of
[1:26:54] it
[1:26:56] we are here on Earth the way we are and
[1:26:59] the only and we only know and can only
[1:27:02] say that we're saved by some Jewish
[1:27:05] Fable called the Bible I said sir
[1:27:09] I don't know how you say that but I
[1:27:13] don't believe it's a Jewish Fable I said
[1:27:16] he said well
[1:27:19] you pray
[1:27:21] what do you pray too well that's a good
[1:27:24] question
[1:27:26] what do you pray to
[1:27:29] you know I know that we're taught we're
[1:27:31] to pray to the god that is in you the
[1:27:34] kingdom of God is within you God by your
[1:27:37] new birth he placed his Spirit In You
[1:27:40] so we're not praying to some something
[1:27:43] we're praying to a personal God that is
[1:27:46] in you
[1:27:48] the power is within you to be
[1:27:50] transformed amen so we're praying now to
[1:27:54] the god that is in you
[1:27:56] he says now
[1:28:04] he said uh you pray what do you pray to
[1:28:08] I asked for such and such a certain
[1:28:11] thing and I didn't get it
[1:28:13] he said you pray wrong
[1:28:15] we should never pray to change God's
[1:28:17] mind
[1:28:18] we should pray to change our mind
[1:28:22] God's mind don't need any changing see
[1:28:25] see it's right he said not what you
[1:28:28] prayed for I know a young Catholic boy
[1:28:31] one time
[1:28:33] was he had a prayer book saying prayers
[1:28:38] and his mother for his mother to live
[1:28:40] and she died and he threw the prayer
[1:28:42] book in the fire see well see
[1:28:45] I don't go for the prayer book but
[1:28:47] anyhow see you take the wrong attitude
[1:28:50] you're trying to tell God what to do
[1:28:53] prayer should be Lord
[1:28:55] change me to fit your word
[1:28:59] not change not let me change your mind
[1:29:04] you change my mind see your mind don't
[1:29:08] your you you change my mind to your will
[1:29:11] and your will is written here in the
[1:29:15] book and Lord don't let me go till I got
[1:29:19] my mindset on your mind amen
[1:29:23] don't let me go until I Got My Mind Set
[1:29:26] On Your Mind
[1:29:28] and you know just got to get into that
[1:29:31] prayer Lord
[1:29:33] I'm going to get into the spirit don't
[1:29:35] let me go I got these things hindering
[1:29:37] me I got things that I'm thinking about
[1:29:39] oh but let me lay aside
[1:29:41] and don't let me go don't let me go
[1:29:44] until I have your mind
[1:29:46] amen the bride has thus saith the Lord
[1:29:49] as she keeps still
[1:29:51] amen
[1:29:53] I believe we just could draw strength
[1:29:55] from these quotes amen
[1:29:59] you change my mind to your will and it's
[1:30:02] written Lord don't let me go till I I
[1:30:06] Got My Mind Set just like your mind and
[1:30:10] then when my mind is set on your word
[1:30:12] then I'll believe every word that you
[1:30:14] wrote and you said in there you'd make
[1:30:17] everything work together for good to
[1:30:20] them that love you and I love you Lord
[1:30:23] that's all working for good amen
[1:30:28] praise God
[1:30:47] you know I think that um
[1:30:49] sometimes when we get into prayer we get
[1:30:52] we get Vision you know God gives vision
[1:30:56] you know that's what Revelation does is
[1:30:58] it unveils and it shows God and His
[1:31:02] word and his people and we begin to see
[1:31:06] what's really valuable and we're able to
[1:31:08] kind of make an adjustment like you know
[1:31:10] working 50 hours instead of just 40
[1:31:13] hours
[1:31:14] you know maybe I'll just need to make an
[1:31:16] adjustment you know because of the value
[1:31:18] of something so that's what when we get
[1:31:19] into prayer and we get revelation
[1:31:22] I think those are the things that we can
[1:31:23] adjust and I'm talking for me and so I
[1:31:27] was thinking about this quote brother
[1:31:28] Branham said and be certain of God 1959
[1:31:32] this was in July 8th
[1:31:35] he says this and um I think this is 58
[1:31:39] paragraph 58 he says
[1:31:41] but they went down there and preached to
[1:31:44] the sodomites the modern Billy Graham
[1:31:46] and an evangelist preached down there
[1:31:48] would there to the world a great
[1:31:50] congregation they had but
[1:31:53] this one Angel stayed behind I want you
[1:31:55] to notice he preached to the elect the
[1:31:58] church that called out
[1:32:00] watch how he done it
[1:32:03] now he was a stranger listen now
[1:32:07] or you'll miss it
[1:32:09] now Jesus said
[1:32:11] as it was then so will it be in the
[1:32:14] coming of the son of man
[1:32:16] the gospel preached by God through a
[1:32:19] mortal being oh I love that
[1:32:21] the son of man
[1:32:23] is the gospel being preached by God
[1:32:26] through a mortal man
[1:32:29] you know and that Ministry hasn't ceased
[1:32:31] that Ministry is living in a people amen
[1:32:36] do you realize you're the Temple of the
[1:32:38] Living God
[1:32:41] we need to pray to receive that
[1:32:43] Revelation and by that Revelation become
[1:32:47] and withstand
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:57] notice this man stood and looked at
[1:33:00] Abraham
[1:33:01] women these days wasn't like they are
[1:33:03] now
[1:33:06] every time somebody comes up in the yard
[1:33:07] the woman's got to put
[1:33:10] on her little shorts and go out there in
[1:33:12] the yard and see what her husband's
[1:33:15] talking about butting into his business
[1:33:17] shame on you shame on you men
[1:33:20] if you got any man about you and let
[1:33:22] your wife do that it's not it's all
[1:33:25] right I guess well that's raw but I I
[1:33:29] don't take it back it's the truth
[1:33:31] now
[1:33:33] that's just the truth
[1:33:35] I got a little respects for a man
[1:33:37] that'll let his wife do a thing like
[1:33:39] that smoke cigarettes drink whiskey wear
[1:33:42] those clothes those kind of clothes
[1:33:44] now man isn't man's not measured by how
[1:33:47] big his muscles he's got
[1:33:50] he's measured by the bag in his knees of
[1:33:53] his pants where he prays
[1:33:56] amen man is not measured by muscle
[1:33:59] that's Beast he's measured by character
[1:34:02] there's never was a greater man than
[1:34:06] Jesus Christ and the Bible said there
[1:34:09] was no beauty that we should desire him
[1:34:12] little stoop showed little fella but in
[1:34:15] him was God character
[1:34:18] man is measured by character amen he's
[1:34:22] seen man that weighed 250 pounds throw a
[1:34:25] baby out of a mother's arms and ravish
[1:34:27] her and you call that manned I call that
[1:34:31] Beast now listen this man sitting there
[1:34:35] said Abraham where is your wife Sarah
[1:34:40] a stranger
[1:34:42] how did he know he was married he was
[1:34:46] married
[1:34:47] how did he know that his wife's name was
[1:34:51] Sarah watch that angel what a message he
[1:34:55] gave Abraham said she's in the tent
[1:34:57] behind you and the Bible says that the
[1:35:00] angel had his back turned to the tent
[1:35:02] behind you said where is your wife Sarah
[1:35:06] how did he know that was his wife and
[1:35:09] how did he know his terrorism his name
[1:35:12] her name was Sarah watch the nature of
[1:35:15] the spirit now to the elect church and
[1:35:16] amen you know in that wonderful we know
[1:35:18] that we've had a visit and God is in the
[1:35:22] same nature as as declared where is your
[1:35:25] wife Sarah God has come hunting his
[1:35:27] bride amen he's coming looking for you
[1:35:30] now are we going to get into the spirit
[1:35:32] that God can place us and and find us
[1:35:35] that we could take our position
[1:35:38] I believe there's there's times that God
[1:35:40] can speak to us in services like this
[1:35:42] and we can catch a revelation catch the
[1:35:45] spirit but I as I've said before I just
[1:35:48] I don't I feel for me I don't want to
[1:35:51] substitute that
[1:35:53] for that hour of Consecration and and
[1:35:56] there's got to be more for us amen
[1:35:58] because we're still longing we're still
[1:36:00] hungering we still have trials we still
[1:36:03] have situations but I believe before we
[1:36:05] go to the to to fight the fight we need
[1:36:08] to get into the spirit and let God speak
[1:36:10] to us you know a lot of times we'll run
[1:36:12] out and try to deal with it and we're
[1:36:14] battling based on knowledge
[1:36:16] God's revealed stuff and so we know hey
[1:36:19] you shouldn't be doing that you
[1:36:20] shouldn't be doing that and all of a
[1:36:22] sudden we're over here and we're
[1:36:23] stirring up Strife but if we ever stop
[1:36:25] for a moment and steal away to God and
[1:36:28] say God I can't do this without your
[1:36:30] spirit I can't I'll just make a mess of
[1:36:32] this if I start acting out in my carnal
[1:36:35] side get lifted up get aggravated get
[1:36:37] irritated but oh God let me let me get
[1:36:40] serious about this Lord we're at the end
[1:36:43] we see that bombs in the hangar we see
[1:36:46] this is perplexity of time people are
[1:36:48] going absolutely insane he said it would
[1:36:50] be like the time that Satan's eating
[1:36:53] he's now going to be crowned
[1:36:55] they're going to Crown Him
[1:36:58] I mean there's going to be a a false
[1:37:01] prophet incarnate
[1:37:03] we're living at the threshold Saints we
[1:37:07] just want to really press into our
[1:37:10] prayer closet to really get into the
[1:37:12] spirit and really let God move upon us
[1:37:14] because we've got some great things
[1:37:16] ahead of us
[1:37:17] we got many victories to be won and I
[1:37:20] believe that if we fight our battles on
[1:37:22] our knees and we can come up from that
[1:37:24] place with the victory in our heart
[1:37:26] we'll just know that God will get the
[1:37:28] glory amen
[1:37:31] amen God is looking for is Sarah amen
[1:37:38] praise the Lord
[1:37:39] you know maybe just another five minutes
[1:37:43] you know while I was
[1:37:46] pondering
[1:37:48] you know when when we read the scripture
[1:37:50] about the patience of Job you know job
[1:37:53] and he he went through a lot of things
[1:37:55] in his life you know and he
[1:37:58] he you know he had faith and he also had
[1:38:01] a perfect heart before the Lord and you
[1:38:04] know he was tested and tried and he
[1:38:06] endured all of those things but you know
[1:38:09] at the end and you can go back and if if
[1:38:11] I'm misquoting I don't mean to but it
[1:38:14] really struck me that when Joe began to
[1:38:16] pray for his those those ones who mocked
[1:38:19] him and ridiculed him then he got a
[1:38:22] restoration and sometimes you're finding
[1:38:25] some things and you feel the oppressor
[1:38:26] and you feel like you're put out and
[1:38:28] you're being isolated you want to pray
[1:38:30] for your enemy you want to pray for your
[1:38:32] brother that may have did not get maybe
[1:38:35] the right attitude with you but you you
[1:38:38] might be the Difference Maker if you'll
[1:38:40] get that situation under the blood and
[1:38:42] in prayer and get into the spirit and
[1:38:44] watch how God may even use you if you're
[1:38:47] willing
[1:38:48] and it's just God's Sovereign hand and
[1:38:50] moment
[1:38:51] to give that person Victory amen because
[1:38:54] we all want victory over this flesh
[1:38:56] and we need each and every one of us to
[1:38:58] go into the prayer closet and fight our
[1:39:00] fight in those those times where we're
[1:39:03] in a Warfare
[1:39:04] and this is not a flesh and blood Affair
[1:39:06] we don't need to teach everybody all of
[1:39:09] their different woes and Wrongs we need
[1:39:11] to get into that prayer and let the
[1:39:13] spirit of God deal with our heart
[1:39:16] and then it can be Christ in us living
[1:39:18] out expressing his great love love
[1:39:21] covered a multitude of unbelief amen
[1:39:25] you know it was um
[1:39:27] brother Branham said this and and this
[1:39:30] is just one of these examples that um
[1:39:33] you were familiar with but in 1964 and
[1:39:36] in August 30th and questions and answers
[1:39:38] he said this he says it was it was in um
[1:39:43] Meridian Mississippi how
[1:39:46] many of the Oneness people brother Bixby
[1:39:48] who they were holding and sponsoring my
[1:39:50] meetings there was Oneness brother and
[1:39:52] one night in a meeting Billy Paul he had
[1:39:54] over an arena he'd given out cards and
[1:39:57] it was pouring down rain and the people
[1:39:59] were standing outside in umbrellas and
[1:40:01] everything and Billy gave them out
[1:40:02] prayer cards and there was and there was
[1:40:05] a and then he came to get me and while
[1:40:09] there was
[1:40:10] while he came to get me the little lady
[1:40:12] sitting down in the front
[1:40:15] she had a baby and another little lady
[1:40:17] trying to keep him quiet and and this
[1:40:20] little lady was sitting there with a
[1:40:22] Calico dress on even what it was
[1:40:25] she was a mother too and she was
[1:40:29] and she seen the little lady in the Holy
[1:40:31] Spirit spoke to her
[1:40:33] something in her heart pray for that
[1:40:35] baby
[1:40:36] amen that's what we want we want God to
[1:40:39] move on us and speak to us amen even in
[1:40:42] a situation like right now
[1:40:44] God move on me if there's somebody you
[1:40:48] want me to pray for you know what
[1:40:50] and that's what happened with this
[1:40:52] sister
[1:40:53] said the spirit Came Upon her and I I
[1:40:55] just love this story because it it
[1:40:58] depicts the conflict that's warring
[1:41:00] between the carnal mind and the
[1:41:02] spiritual mind amen
[1:41:05] he says
[1:41:07] now
[1:41:10] go pray for that baby well Sid the next
[1:41:13] time she passes
[1:41:14] I'll go pray for her
[1:41:17] the next time
[1:41:19] the devil's saying the same thing to you
[1:41:21] tonight
[1:41:22] the next time
[1:41:23] the next time How many times does he say
[1:41:25] the next time
[1:41:27] we don't know if there's going to be a
[1:41:28] next time
[1:41:29] amen we want to be desperate we want to
[1:41:31] be just pressing in like never before
[1:41:33] the next time she passes I'll pray for
[1:41:36] her and when she passes again
[1:41:39] but now she's the woman's holding a
[1:41:41] prayer card
[1:41:44] now we're battling
[1:41:46] she said I can't pray for that baby said
[1:41:48] brother branham's we'll pray for that
[1:41:50] baby tonight
[1:41:51] and who am I to pray for that baby that
[1:41:54] brother Branham is going to pray for
[1:41:56] her mine don't don't don't the devil
[1:41:58] attack you like that
[1:42:00] trying to water down to value
[1:42:03] of your prayer your faith your ability
[1:42:07] to fight against the lives of the devil
[1:42:09] to fight against sickness against sorrow
[1:42:14] we don't want to lay down our weapon
[1:42:21] now that was reverent that was nice
[1:42:24] but it can't always be the will of God
[1:42:26] sometimes it's different the Holy Spirit
[1:42:29] kept telling her go pray for that baby
[1:42:32] finally she thought that woman will turn
[1:42:35] down my she'll turn me down cold all
[1:42:38] right see the carnal mind at work that's
[1:42:40] what we gotta find
[1:42:41] we got to fight off the carnal mind that
[1:42:44] woman's gonna turn me down cold
[1:42:53] knowing she's got a prayer card she
[1:42:55] wouldn't want me to pray for her that
[1:42:58] baby
[1:42:59] she brought that baby here not for me to
[1:43:02] pray for it but for brother Branham to
[1:43:04] pray for it
[1:43:05] and the Holy Spirit kept telling me he
[1:43:07] kept saying go pray for that baby
[1:43:10] finally she said well
[1:43:13] to relieve myself I'll just say I'll
[1:43:15] give her my seat
[1:43:18] so she said honey
[1:43:21] one little mother talking to another
[1:43:24] would you I want you got a baby would
[1:43:27] you come and sit down here and take my
[1:43:29] seat she said oh honey
[1:43:31] I don't want you to have to take I don't
[1:43:33] want to have to take your seat I'm
[1:43:34] trying to keep my baby quiet said but
[1:43:37] look so tired and worn she said I am she
[1:43:41] said well sit down here and take my seed
[1:43:43] and she said
[1:43:45] I see you got a prayer card perhaps
[1:43:47] brother branham's going to pray for the
[1:43:49] baby she said
[1:43:51] we hope this number will be called and
[1:43:55] she said well I do too she said sister
[1:44:00] you are a Christian she said oh yes she
[1:44:04] said I'm a Christian too
[1:44:05] she said ever since I've been sitting
[1:44:08] here the spirit of the Lord was telling
[1:44:10] me pray for that baby
[1:44:13] would you give me permission
[1:44:16] I know that brother Brandon will pray
[1:44:18] for that baby if it's called
[1:44:20] and you just keep holding that your
[1:44:22] prayer card he'll get it said but if I
[1:44:27] lay my hands upon the baby and just
[1:44:29] offer a little prayer to make myself
[1:44:32] feel better and get from under what is
[1:44:35] calling me would you be offended
[1:44:38] would it offend you she said why
[1:44:40] certainly not darling pray for the baby
[1:44:44] and it was a little blue baby so the
[1:44:46] little lady prayed for it and she gave
[1:44:48] the lady her seed and she climbed up
[1:44:50] into the third balcony and was sitting
[1:44:51] up there some Christian brother up there
[1:44:54] gentleman enough to give up and give the
[1:44:57] lady the seed and sat down about an hour
[1:45:00] and a half later I came into the meeting
[1:45:02] and spoke a few minutes called the
[1:45:05] prayer cards and the woman was third or
[1:45:08] fourth in line with the baby and she sat
[1:45:11] up there and she said oh thank you Lord
[1:45:13] now I felt sorry for the little mother I
[1:45:17] believe the baby will get well now
[1:45:19] because brother Branham just the third
[1:45:23] or fourth
[1:45:24] he'll get the one thank you Lord the
[1:45:27] little mother setting their feeling for
[1:45:29] the baby you see that's what prayer will
[1:45:31] do when we get into the spirit we can
[1:45:33] get a real feeling
[1:45:34] we can get a real feeling it's not just
[1:45:36] our Doctrine
[1:45:37] I love this this is just oh that mother
[1:45:40] oh my when
[1:45:43] then when I come up and started praying
[1:45:45] for the baby when the lady came up she
[1:45:48] said I looked at her and said now your
[1:45:52] baby is a blue baby you brought it here
[1:45:55] to be prayed for now your name is such
[1:45:57] and so and so and you come from such and
[1:46:00] such a place but your baby is already
[1:46:02] healed there was a woman who had a
[1:46:04] burden on her hard her name is such and
[1:46:06] such so and so that setting here on the
[1:46:09] balcony the first at the end the fourth
[1:46:11] row in the third balcony prayed the
[1:46:14] prayer of faith for that baby and that
[1:46:16] baby's already healed she just dropped
[1:46:19] out of her seat almost
[1:46:21] my prayer my prayer of faith
[1:46:26] that baby's healed
[1:46:31] now what if she had not done that
[1:46:35] see what I mean now that woman would
[1:46:38] have had more Sympathy for the baby a
[1:46:41] mother to a baby than I would for a baby
[1:46:45] see the mother being
[1:46:48] can we do Miracles yes
[1:46:52] can we do miracles
[1:46:54] yes
[1:46:57] when we are directed by the Holy Ghost
[1:47:00] to do miracles
[1:47:02] go do it
[1:47:04] because it's the Holy Ghost directed
[1:47:06] amen I just think that's so wonderful
[1:47:09] you think about you your suffering is
[1:47:12] not in vain the trials that you are
[1:47:15] going through you know Jesus he suffered
[1:47:20] in all like manner so that he could be a
[1:47:23] high priest that can be touched by the
[1:47:25] feeling of your infirmity and you're
[1:47:27] going through tests you're going through
[1:47:29] trials the devil has put blinders to
[1:47:31] where all the time when we want to try
[1:47:33] to enter into prayer we're looking at
[1:47:35] our our trial we're looking at our
[1:47:37] problems we're looking at all these
[1:47:39] other things but God wants to use those
[1:47:42] for others and so it's your feeling for
[1:47:45] the sick it's your feeling for The
[1:47:47] Sinner it's your feeling for your
[1:47:49] brother in the wrong if you know better
[1:47:51] enter into prayer so that if I'm making
[1:47:53] a mistake pray for me
[1:47:56] amen
[1:47:59] amen we want God to direct amen
[1:48:03] praise the Lord
[1:48:09] maybe just another five minutes
[1:48:22] you know I was thinking about
[1:48:25] you know the burden that brother Branham
[1:48:27] had with the with the tax case
[1:48:30] and you know it was a it was a great
[1:48:33] trial for him and
[1:48:35] we know some of the things that he
[1:48:38] experienced because it's on record
[1:48:41] but something an interaction with Mita
[1:48:43] it struck out to me and
[1:48:46] and it's in a message called absolute it
[1:48:49] was before he preached a message surge
[1:48:51] is this the sign is this the sign of the
[1:48:53] end and um in in 62 in December the
[1:48:59] morning of the 30th
[1:49:01] he said but
[1:49:02] I believe this is in paragraph 24 23.
[1:49:07] but these these governments now no
[1:49:11] matter how well we think they are yet
[1:49:13] they back of them they're dominated by
[1:49:17] Satan these kingdoms he said
[1:49:19] are mine I'll do with them whatever I
[1:49:23] wish to
[1:49:24] I'll give them to you if you'll worship
[1:49:27] me
[1:49:28] Jesus said get the hints thou shall
[1:49:31] Worship the Lord and him only shall thou
[1:49:33] serve and then I got discouraged my wife
[1:49:38] is listening to me
[1:49:39] and I went on and said no sir if I owed
[1:49:43] it
[1:49:44] I'd have paid it but I don't owe it and
[1:49:47] I'm not going to pay it and that's all
[1:49:50] how many are familiar with the case
[1:49:53] so brother Branham whenever he was going
[1:49:55] out on the road and campaigning
[1:49:58] they had it set where he would put
[1:49:59] Branham campaign and he would deposit
[1:50:01] the funds for the meetings and different
[1:50:03] things into the account and now they
[1:50:05] said that he owed back taxes and it was
[1:50:07] a trial for five years where they were
[1:50:09] going through and the attorney said hey
[1:50:11] we can we can fight this we can get it
[1:50:14] but I'm going to tell you that even
[1:50:16] though we can clear you of it and it can
[1:50:19] be like a gift and an inheritance and
[1:50:22] all this it's still it'll stay with you
[1:50:25] and so
[1:50:27] brother Branham was saying but if I owed
[1:50:30] it I would pay it they can't they don't
[1:50:32] have nothing on me he was free of the
[1:50:35] the charge he didn't use any of the
[1:50:37] money for himself
[1:50:39] it was all for the ministry
[1:50:42] and so now he's he's just you know
[1:50:49] so he's in this situation and now he
[1:50:51] says
[1:50:53] he said now
[1:50:55] I don't owe the money
[1:50:57] I'm just gonna go I'm not going to pay
[1:51:00] it that's all
[1:51:01] I said
[1:51:03] how can I pay it anyhow so I went home
[1:51:06] and I said me to wash the kid's face and
[1:51:09] get their clothes ready I'm leaving
[1:51:11] I said
[1:51:12] they won't even anything
[1:51:15] I'll just
[1:51:17] upside down
[1:51:19] he said
[1:51:21] what have I done tell me I said yet me
[1:51:25] forty thousand dollars
[1:51:28] I don't realize what that means you
[1:51:30] don't realize what that means to me and
[1:51:32] she come in as a nice wife would and
[1:51:35] said
[1:51:36] I'm leaving she said
[1:51:39] we you think that would do any good
[1:51:42] if you prayed over it
[1:51:44] I thought well maybe I'd pray maybe I
[1:51:47] had to Pray Again
[1:51:49] and he goes back in and it seemed like
[1:51:51] he said to me a scripture
[1:51:54] you know
[1:51:56] this is real food for my soul and I just
[1:51:59] I feel like the transparency of our
[1:52:01] prophet in one of his greatest trials
[1:52:03] can be a real strength and I love it
[1:52:05] because it was Christ in our Prophet it
[1:52:08] was God preaching his gospel what a life
[1:52:11] worthy of the Gospel really looks like
[1:52:13] amen so he's in this great trial and
[1:52:16] here he is he said now I prayed no doubt
[1:52:18] he's had five years to pray and Commit
[1:52:20] This thing to the Lord
[1:52:22] and so now his wife
[1:52:25] have you prayed about this oh my and
[1:52:28] it's sometimes we're reacting
[1:52:31] like oh I'm just gonna
[1:52:33] we're just gonna get out of here watch
[1:52:34] the kids face we're just going to leave
[1:52:37] but so he says that he goes back in and
[1:52:40] it seemed like he said the scripture to
[1:52:42] me and he says always we want to watch
[1:52:45] the scripture
[1:52:46] what God did about it you see and one
[1:52:50] day he was asked to him
[1:52:52] you know trying to accuse him to the
[1:52:56] government he said
[1:52:59] is it right for us Jews to give tribute
[1:53:02] or taxes to Caesar
[1:53:05] he says you've got a penny he said
[1:53:07] what's the inscription on it the
[1:53:09] inscription on it he said Caesar he said
[1:53:12] then give Caesar the things that are
[1:53:14] Caesar's and to God the things that is
[1:53:16] God's and then I thought
[1:53:19] I'll turn over to the Bible and read it
[1:53:22] see
[1:53:25] when we get back into the spirit and
[1:53:27] pray to pray again you see how he told
[1:53:29] him he said just go
[1:53:31] there's a little bit more I want to show
[1:53:33] you in the scripture
[1:53:35] what you got is good but I want to show
[1:53:37] you a little bit more
[1:53:39] let's go back into the scripture
[1:53:41] I got something more I want to show you
[1:53:42] he says always watch that scripture what
[1:53:45] God did about it and one day he asked me
[1:53:47] excuse the government
[1:53:50] what is the inscription it's Caesar
[1:53:54] and in verse 33 he thought of that and I
[1:53:57] turned over to the Bible and read it I
[1:53:58] thought truly Lord that's right
[1:54:01] but this belongs this doesn't belong to
[1:54:04] Caesar this was yours it wasn't Caesar's
[1:54:10] see I think sometimes when we we know
[1:54:14] that we're right
[1:54:15] we we
[1:54:17] get an ignition we're not moving we're
[1:54:21] not moving
[1:54:23] but I think this is such a wonderful
[1:54:25] expression
[1:54:27] he says
[1:54:29] it wasn't Caesar's and if it was it had
[1:54:32] been mine
[1:54:34] I'd been I'd paid more taxes or
[1:54:37] something well that would have been
[1:54:39] different that it belonged to Caesar's
[1:54:41] but it's yours see it didn't belong to
[1:54:45] Caesar in the first place
[1:54:47] you know he was always got the answer in
[1:54:50] the word
[1:54:51] he has always got the answer in the word
[1:54:55] I just read a little further and he said
[1:54:58] say Simon
[1:55:00] haven't you got a push hook in your
[1:55:02] pocket
[1:55:03] to see yeah he always cared a little
[1:55:05] fish hook and a string
[1:55:07] he says I've just made a deposit this
[1:55:10] morning and a fish Bank down there in
[1:55:12] the river you know
[1:55:13] he said I've made a deposit and the bank
[1:55:16] the banker will certainly give up what
[1:55:19] he's got
[1:55:20] just go down there and throw your hook
[1:55:22] in the river
[1:55:23] and when he got up from the bank opened
[1:55:27] his mouth you see
[1:55:29] he gave out of the coin
[1:55:31] let's not offend him
[1:55:33] don't bring an offense to them
[1:55:36] go pay it Simon
[1:55:38] you'll be for me and you and I thought
[1:55:41] true God you got a fish bank and
[1:55:44] everything else across the country
[1:55:46] I don't know how it'll be done
[1:55:49] but we went down and got to the brothers
[1:55:51] and the church stood on the note and
[1:55:55] they put the note in and I got 40 000
[1:55:57] and paid it off amen I think that's just
[1:56:00] a sacred reality you know in the spirit
[1:56:03] of Christ
[1:56:05] we don't want to offend nobody we don't
[1:56:07] want to go to the world as if we got
[1:56:10] something that they don't know we want
[1:56:11] to come in the spirit of love the spirit
[1:56:14] of humility the spirit of prayer and we
[1:56:16] we don't want to bring on fence we don't
[1:56:18] want anybody to think we're not a
[1:56:19] Christian
[1:56:21] you know we want to respect our faith
[1:56:23] and to really Express Christ and I just
[1:56:26] I want to encourage you tonight you you
[1:56:28] have the gift of faith and the prayer
[1:56:31] that you can offer a prayer faith can
[1:56:34] make the difference not only for you for

[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:25] listen to me
[2:19:29] I've been blessed tonight
[2:19:33] it's always a good reminder to know that
[2:19:35] there's always power and prayer
[2:19:38] you know brother bam says in the message
[2:19:40] token it says that when we're in prayer
[2:19:43] and we pray as the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:19:47] that speaks for you
[2:19:50] because we are covered by his blood so
[2:19:53] when you pray it's not you that's
[2:19:56] praying but it's the blood of Jesus
[2:19:59] Christ
[2:20:00] bringing it to God for you on your
[2:20:04] behalf
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:07] but you have to commune with them
[2:20:11] I remember the story in the scripture
[2:20:13] Matthew 28 or 26 I believe
[2:20:17] Jesus was praying
[2:20:19] is so much that the disciples fell
[2:20:22] asleep
[2:20:23] fervent prayer
[2:20:28] catching the revelation of what he was
[2:20:30] meant to be and who he was meant to who
[2:20:32] to to and what to do
[2:20:35] he was praying
[2:20:37] power and prayer
[2:20:39] [Music]
[2:20:41] I believe that we have authority when we
[2:20:44] pray before the Lord because it's a
[2:20:46] relationship science
[2:20:48] that's how you get to talk to your lover
[2:20:51] where you can sit there on your knees
[2:20:53] and talk about his goodness
[2:20:57] talk about all that he's done for you
[2:20:59] the little things sometimes are more
[2:21:02] important because we could walk daily
[2:21:03] with those things
[2:21:05] and so I've just been blessed tonight to
[2:21:07] be remembered again
[2:21:09] how important it is
[2:21:12] to be in prayer
[2:21:14] and it was just on my heart
[2:21:17] as a dismissal
[2:21:20] I believe every one of us tonight is
[2:21:21] covered by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:21:25] and if we can all pray as a dismissal
[2:21:29] it could be for somebody that you have
[2:21:30] on your heart
[2:21:32] it could be for yourself if you have a
[2:21:34] need
[2:21:34] but remember the prophet said that if
[2:21:37] we're covered by his blood when we pray
[2:21:41] it's not you that's praying but it's the
[2:21:44] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:21:46] and so if we can just get together and
[2:21:48] pray as a dismissal I think
[2:21:51] it'll benefit us and me
[2:21:54] and all of us together as a body just to
[2:21:57] ask the Lord for his leadership
[2:21:59] to walk with us to guide us
[2:22:04] walking with the Lord like Enoch then
[2:22:07] like Noah did daily
[2:22:11] let's just go before them together as we
[2:22:13] just pray
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:22] Lord we ask Lord tonight
[2:22:33] Lord by prayer and we can sit here Lord
[2:22:36] and just pray before us
[2:22:39] Lord I will be able to pray for a
[2:22:42] situation
[2:22:47] next morning
[2:22:54] [Music]
[2:22:56] Lord and how you just talk to your
[2:22:58] children's Lord reaches
[2:23:01] lower
[2:23:05] when we could just charge Lord in the
[2:23:08] presence of Your Love Lord It's
[2:23:12] it's a toughest unique power
[2:23:15] humility
[2:23:18] [Music]
