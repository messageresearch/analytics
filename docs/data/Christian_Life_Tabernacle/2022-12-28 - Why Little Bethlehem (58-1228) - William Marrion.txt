Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it might look kind of funny this morning to wear my Overcoat on the platform but I was so happy that to display that pretty Overcoat this shirts give me I seen brother Neville up here to the day with that nice suit on hot fitting so nicely and I thought well uh he looks nice in the congregation talking about I thought I'll just wear my Overcoat out on the back hey man you know I believe we never grow up we always and I don't want to grow up how about that brother Luther now I never want to grow up we just want to always remain children one of those tires like these higher Christ ministers I just glanced part of my eye and I thought maybe you just put all the rules complimentary to that nice Overcoat well I'll say it's it's I was needing one awful bad and it's the best one I ever had and I sure do appreciate it and brother Roy Roberson I don't know where he's here this morning or not he had something to do with the selecting of it and it was really a fine selection and we're we're very very pleased to have it and so we are very pleased to be back in the house of the Living God this morning and to enjoy these wonderful times of Fellowship around his precious word and it's soon now that the Lord willing I've got to go overseas I guess you've seen it in the businessman's voice that I leave for overseas this next month and we will be soliciting all the prayers of the people that they will pray for us while we are away seemingly that oversees my meeting seems to be uh better because it takes Federal there in America was telling brother Mercer that I'll listen to her he gave me a record player first and it had the records on it of some of my sermons I knew that if anybody ever listened to me would have to be God's grace to them because I thought I could be a little better he's Taping that too a little you can cut that part out or he's holding his thumb down I guess that's cutting it off but I I tell you I was so surprised I uh poorest preaching I ever heard in my life was my own that's right on on the record I it made me so nervous I couldn't even eat my dinner I got sick got away at the table couldn't sleep that night and uh went out in Kentucky with brother wood just you coming back I said brother Woods I don't see how that I ever get a person to come and hear me speak as so so poorly such repeating myself and all grammar Miss and punctuations there isn't isn't any I just I don't know I said they encouraged me in one way to know it has to be God or nobody would come at all that's right so I was speaking to brother Collins I suppose he's in the building and so I said to him he come over and he's telling him about it I said brother Collins uh honestly I said I'm pregnant 30 years old as a preacher and I certainly ought to know what a sermon is I said that's the poorest I ever heard any he's the Methodist Minister and his brothers are quite a man in the Methodist denomination and he said well he said I'll tell you brother Branham said the punctuations and and your sentences made out of the end right and things like that but so did you ever think of that guy preached on the day of Pentecost they couldn't even sign his own name name his name is Peter said I imagine that wasn't punctuated just right but you see what makes a man get his eyes on that you listen to these radio broadcasts and that's all rodents you see and they they can't even write it out and punctuate it and things because they're reading it I stood but Charles Fuller preaching behind a trough about like Ed Free's platform and everything that he said he read it write down number one number two number three number four I can't figure out all right out and timed it is all censored radio censored everything because and with Billy Graham I seen his and so forth where they just stand there and speak that just as read it just as fast as they can read it and it's all right so I guess you would get the punctuations but the trouble with me I couldn't even read it so if I wrote it I'm sure I couldn't read it so so it's Amazing Grace isn't it to see what he can do for us but I'm grateful to starting in now ending up to this old year to start a new year I listened to a prayer line and I certainly wasn't satisfied with the prayer line either The Listener that's first time I ever heard myself back like that for for a message and I certainly was surprised the prayer lines isn't run right no I think it'll come to pass that after a while it'll be so that everybody will have to know everything about them before they'll believe and beginning and first year I want to change that and you'll start the prayer line wherever God speaks to me this person's out of line or something wrong I'll stop with him let the rest of them go on through that because you don't get enough through like that see the prayer people know where they are and who they are and what they've done but they find something it's not lined up just right with God that's a time to stop on that one say this is the one so I think maybe to be some alternation done brother the old since I heard them and I trust that God will help us in the coming year now I believe that tonight they got Services here at the Tabernacle and I'm to be up here on 62 with brother ruddle tonight I understand that they're going to have a watch service here and brother ruddle had asked me for that watch service but thinking maybe I'd come back at the Tabernacle for that night because of always tried to be at the Tabernacle on on uh New Year's Eve and I wanted to come back down here with the brother in here so I kind of compromised a little and of abuse brother ruddle tonight out on 62. at the old 62 Club that's been converted into a church and then Wednesday night will be back here at the watch service and then Thursday we leave for Chicago and then on and on to Philadelphia and then overseas and this morning we don't want to keep you too long because it's uh we got um interviews and the services go on and say since the last prayer service Euro I'm very grateful for the results it came forth from the last service of Prayer it was certainly a wonderful thing that our Lord can do when his people get together they that are will call upon the name of the Lord assemble themselves together I believe is the way it is and and prayed and God will hear from heaven so let us bow our heads just a moment now as we look to him to give to us the inspiration needed for this message Lord thou has been our refuge and strength and all generations our forefathers before us trusted in thee and were not confounded they believed in thy holy name and they were brought forth as shining lights and we looking upon them as the Portis said Footprints upon the sands of time our partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time then we see that those who trusted in thee all ways without one time failing come out right though they went through many deep Waters and and great trials and persecutions but yet in the end thou did all ways bring them out more than conquerors because it is I promised word that you would do this and we would pray today that you would bless this little church blessed Pastor our good brother brother Neville and his family we ask that you'll just be with him in this coming year and will anoint him greater and and bless him in every way strengthen the health of his family the little ones that are coming up keep brother Neville strong and healthy and bless this church and every member that's in it the trustee board how we love them is real Gallant man of God and the Deacon board they also are thy Gallant servants and all the people that come here we are grateful for them Lord just does my heart good to know that this little old Pond and weed patch standing on the corner many years ago has been made a lighthouse to the kingdom of God and I pray God that it'll stand until Jesus comes May many great Souls that's been in here Lord come forth at that day washed in the blood of the Lamb granted and as we open this blessed word of thine this morning Lord by turning back the pages to read from it a text and we know that you alone can give the context and we pray God that you will anoint your word may it go right to the hearts of the people that would do them good make Believers out of unbelievers and strengthen Christians and heal the sick give courage to the discouraged and get Glory unto thyself in order to do this Lord circumcise the lips that shall speak in the ears that shall hear for we asked it in Jesus name amen [Music] announcing a little text that a fell on my heart since last Sunday that I was speaking up on the wise man coming to to see Jesus the star they followed from the East to the West while studying then I hit a scripture and then did not get to be your Christmas Eve because of some jail service and so forth I had to be at I thought I would speak today upon the subject of why little Bethlehem and I want to read out of the Book of Micah the prophet one of the Minor Prophets the fifth chapter and the second verse it reads like this but thou Bethlehem Ephraim though thou be little among the thousands of Judah but out yet out of these shall come forth unto me and eat a ruler be the ruler in Israel who's going forth has been from old from Everlasting I had a spot on the scripture there so he I couldn't make out what the word was at the time of all of the places that is in Palestine and in there is so many great cities and its localities cities that are seemingly much more uh no one in the lore of History and better fortified bigger cities why should God choose little Bethlehem to be the birthplace of his son there is many that are greater and for instance the historical Aura of Jerusalem the proud Jerusalem the capital of all of it and it's one of the largest cities of Palestine and then we wonder why God would pick on that little bitty Town of Bethlehem for the birthplace of his son but as the scriptures is said what God determines to do it will be done and there is uh God for ordained it to be that way or it never would have been that way and there the scripture says in the 15th chapter of acts that there is nothing by chance God knowed everything it just didn't happen to happen that way it just was that God made it that way and then when we in our little finite Minds begin to think over why would the great king of Heaven choose a little place like that instead of the capital and instead of some even there was many places you had greater spiritual background than what Bethlehem did for instance some of the places like Shiloh Shiloh was an ancient worship place of Israel where they all came year by year to the this great place where the Ark of the Lord rested and wonder why vanity wouldn't be born at Shiloh then there was the gilgale another great spiritual place of worship why wouldn't God let him be born then at gilgale and there was another Zion Zion was on the Mountaintop and we wonder why that Jesus would not be born then in Zion because if it's been a great historical markup where the Lord has blessed his people in the ages and it looks like that maybe he would have chosen Zion or gilgalar or Shiloh are one of the other great places where there have been great blessings and great teachings and there was other great cities such as Hebron that was a place for a man who was wanting a City of Refuge a place of safety there was remoth Gilead also another place of Refuge where the people could come which have been very appropriate for him to be born and maybe if I would have been thinking that I would have brought him over to Katie sparnia for there was a judgment seat and a place of Refuge perhaps I would have brought him over to that country for his birthplace or maybe we would have chosen some of the other cities but you know I'm so glad that even just little insignificant things in the Bible means so much I believe that it was Jesus it said this that you pass over and do the weightier matters of the law rather but pass over the little things and sometimes it's the little things that holds the big things together but all in all the great cogs is turning just exactly the way God ordained in the call there will never be one miss its place God is for ordained all things and it must hit just exactly to that place and when we get Faith like that and begin to think of who's behind all this what is the mainspring that's turning this great uh economy of God we find it's the Holy Spirit not left into the hands of man to do things but in the hands of the Holy Spirit and he is the mainspring that if he can get the rest of the instruments it'll work just perfectly keep exactly God's time and then we see that and we wander in our mind then as we look at great things and how that we would have him and then it gives us a lot of consolation today to think that maybe if we are a little group of people maybe if we are insignificant to the world and to the bigger churches of denominations yet God uses those little simple things sometime for it is also written in the scriptures fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom what a consolation that I know that just is sure as Jesus had to be born in little Bethlehem so will the little flock be the one that the father will give the kingdom to you because it's written and it all scripture is given by inspiration and the scriptures cannot be broken they must be fulfilled so it gives us that hope to know that that it'll be a little flock that will receive the kingdom a little faithful flock of believers I'm trusting to be one of those flowers or in that little flock I should say and then we know the story most all of us are acquainted with the story of how Israel came into Palestine by promise of God and we know that the great Joshua was the one who divided each tribe their potion and it's certainly if we had the time of about from now until six o'clock tonight just stay right on this subject to line these things away to get the real meaning out of them which we do not have just about 30 or 40 minutes so we have to strike just the high points trusting that the Holy Spirit to you Bible readers will place the rest of it into your heart as we go along did you know that those potions how Joshua lauded them in Palestine was given by inspiration and those Hebrew mothers of those Patriarchs when the baby was coming forth in her intervaling pain to deliver the child she uttered the very spot that those Patriarchs would settle down and be at the last days talk about inspiration this Bible is inspired no matter how little just every little scripture has such an outstanding thing in the script and the great picture all of it every every word is inspired and all that hangs the destination of Souls for it's a word of the immortal and Eternal God and even those mothers when the baby was born and she uttered The Voice place them positionally where they'd be in the promised land hundreds of years later and Joshua not knowing that yet by the same inspiration place them exactly where they were to be and Joshua dividing up divided judah's potion if you'll notice on the map it's a geographically just west of the plain scene a few miles south of Jerusalem the capital and when Judah was giving her part or his part rather in the land his Province we would call it it's strange but this little city was not even mentioned Bethlehem yet it was there because that Abraham uh I believe it was Rebecca was buried at that place but it must have been just a little village of some sort because if you read Joshua 5 you'll find that there was a hundred and fifteen major cities under the domain of Judah besides the villages and little towns 115 cities mentioned and perhaps when it was divided up that Bethlehem was so little maybe just a a little house or two it wasn't even mentioned in the inheritance and then we find out that it never actually come to be known the one that founded it was Caleb's son Caleb's son whose name Islam and he founded it the Bible said he was the father of it which mean he was the founder of Bethlehem in other words he must have moved in there and started uh some sort of businesses and a commercial and the trading and so forth that grew it up and later we'll find out that the real reason of it that the whole land was jealous of that little piece of land which lays to the north and east and slopes a little to the south on that spur and it was the most fertile of all of Palestine it was a a corn belt and a wheat belt and there were great Olive Orchards and so forth on and that part of Bethlehem or Palestine the end of Judah province and we find out that it was also became the home of the Harlot rehab when Israel had passed over the borderline of the Jordan River into Palestine we are acquainted with the story of Rahab the heart let's picture her this morning for a few minutes now as a a young lady a beautiful young woman sudden Misfortune in life had been forced in being a pagan had been forced into the life that she was living and many times people are forced into the life that they live I was in the prisons the other night to see a man who was taken a sentence and I I took him by the hand and talked to him and I said why would you do such a thing as that and holding me by the hand he began to speak and he was forced into what he was doing I said because that you permitted that to force you to that you don't have to do that you know man has to drink I said I'm nervous myself but there's no need of that and this young woman after she'd got her first hearing of Israel another God who was a a God that answered prayer not only a God to pray to but a God that answered back when she heard that there was a god of Miracles her heart began to tremble and when she got the first message from two preachers that went over quickly she accepted it with all her heart and there was a Scarlet card bounded her window for protection of her house because that she had received the message now I might add year did you know she typed the Gentile Church she was a gentile and she was the type of the Gentile Church one day heard the message we were all out in spiritual prostitution committing spiritual fornications against the god of heaven and all kinds of stuff all kinds of denominations and religions that that was a God that still lived that could perform miracles quickly we received it the message there was applied the blood of the Lord Jesus which made the Scarlet card and to keep from going into detail you know how she hung it from her window publicly the blood was displayed publicly that's the way the blood's got to be displayed publicly hanging from the outside of the wall the show that on the inside something had taken place that's the way the True Believer in Christ is this morning on the outside is the display of the blood of the Lord Jesus that shows something took place on the inside and through this God looked down on the Wrath fell and the trumpets began to blow seen that Scarlet card hang in there as a memorial it's always pleased him to pass over the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you he saw it and went the shaking and the Holy Spirit Rumble the Earth and shut down that wall some 20 feet thick not one rock fell that cord was hanging shows the protection of a true God True Believer no matter what states you're in when he finds you if you'll just accept that Scarlet card it weeds to the Bible and then we see her when she was taking it as one of the Israelites she fell in love with the man which was a captain and a prince in Judah he was a captain of the Israelite armies his name was Solomon just like the King Solomon and he was the captain and she become in a great romance with this captain which was the prince of Judah and father she married him and when the estate was settled up for the Israelites she and her beloved husband lived in Bethlehem now you begin to see an open having him see it began to open as we see that in Bethlehem Sheila healing Aid Gentile bride to a Jew why because she believed in a miracle-working god and as look what she come from from the uh out of the house of ill-fame of prostitution through her conversion and you are unfailing faith in God it brought her from a prostitute house to a beautiful home in Bethlehem what a difference that's the way it does all of us from a house of unbelief and flusterations that a immoral action everything to a place position Christ which is most beautiful from the ridiculous to the sublime that's the difference that it makes through our conversion and did you see she married a prince all the house of Judah a captain that Captain represented Christ tucked to himself a gentile bride from the lowest of Lois to the principle and best place in the land as we'll get to it later in our message to prove that it was nothing else could be but that type of the Gentile Church and we find out they had a lovely home in Bethlehem as slam had had established it and that it would become a great place and the fertile lands and how beautiful it is to think of that great wheat country there I it would be the bread place of the world and it is true no wonder Jesus had to be born there because he was the bread of life that's where all the nation come for their wheat all the nations come farther Khan for it was in Bethlehem that had those fertile lands and you see the little bitty thing just saying oh it was the province of wheat yet that meant something and you see how this Gentile Prince or this Jewish Prince taking his Gentile bride back up to Bethlehem for a settling down place man a place to live where there was plenty of bread we find out through this great Romance ain't great obedience to Faith to the heart of Rahab she gave birth to a son to Solomon his name was Boaz and we all are acquainted with another great story tying in this link here now and Boaz was born in Bethlehem from Solomon and the Heart it read and we'll find out that years later after the neoma had left the country and gone over to sojourn with the mobenites and when they had to evily at in mistreated her and she got out of fellowship with the rest of the Believers and Associated yourself in a backslitting condition in another land among another people and otherwise she'd left the true believing Church to go out into the world for a little while to join some social Church who believed in just anything would be all right in there she lost her husband and it don't have to be every time in physical death you might lose him in a spiritual death or lose your wife better stay on Good Grounds you better stay where you know you're covered by the blood regardless of what the rest of them looks like how big they are how finest fires they have on their churches or how the big bells ring you better stay where the blood covers the sin of the people you might lose one another and above all you might lose the Lord Jesus to be barred out and we find out then that after her sons was gone she lost both of them and she returned back because there was no Revival spirit in the city at the time oh how I would love to rest here for a few minutes I would like to pick it up right here and show you regardless of how many of the churches gone back stay under the blood that's the place to buy in or out up or down thick or thin wherever it may be stay under the learn but Naoma she thought it would be better to go over and join another group because they were having troubles spiritual bread wasn't there and but God will restore it back I will restore saith the Lord stay in the field where it comes from so we find that she begin to long to go back because they heard that a great Revival had broke out and if you notice neoma returned in barley season the Bible said just at the time of the Harvest in other words when there was a great revival going on spiritually applying it she returned just in that season nothing left she had nothing in orify one of her sons wives when she come to look upon what she had to sacrifice being a type of the modern church if I have to go over there I'll have to get away from my dances I'll have to get away from my big time and my social Gatherings that she just wept and kissed her mother-in-law and returned back but here's a beautiful picture there was one named Ruth with her another daughter-in-law which is a type again of the Gentile bride who kissed her mother-in-law and said I'll forsake everything I'm going with you let your people be my people let your God be my God wherever you died there I'll die where you're buried there I'll be buried that's it that's what God wants it's not that borderline halfway but of absolute full surrender to the kingdom of God she kissed her and saw the they all said to discourage you said you better go back to your people I'm old and there's no more sons of me and the law was that she had to wait for a son I'm set then there's no more in me and if I would have a husband and I'd have a son you'd be too old to marry so you just returned back to your people but Ruth said I'll not go back Faith rooted grounded perfect Faith had come into Ruth's heart she said I'm going right with you and she cleaved to her held on to her I'm going to be where you are I like that and we're acquainted with the story as it goes on that this great Boaz which was the lord of the Harvest was in Harvest at the time and was a king Kinsmen to neoma and when she found Ruth out there in a little Mission gleaning every little straw that she could pick up that had some wheat on it she held to it for it was life boy as being the lord of the Harvest he commanded that his Reapers would drop a handful now and then for her and she would pick it up and with joy and she shot she shut down a great apron full of it that day and when Boaz the Lord the Harvest came out and looked upon Ruth and seen her faithfulness he fell in love with her what's Boaz represent Christ where was he at Bethlehem why was Ruth Come to Bethlehem where was she cleaning out in Bethlehem see all those spiritual significance to this hear me the background to this great scene that's taking place God knowing it in the beginning and she began to a question to her mother-in-law what she must do and finally Ruth was married to boys a gentile married to a prince again in Judah and settled down and lived in Bethlehem oh thou Lou Bethlehem aren't you the least among all the prince principal cities of of Palestine but it's pleased God who's knowing and going forth was from old from the beginning to have his son born there amen he knows all things it works it just to be right and there Ruth married Boaz and when Ruth and Boaz was married if we had time to go into the great story there which is one of the greatest love scenes of all ages when Ruth and Boaz were married and remember let's just stop for a minute here just too good to pass over Ruth was a gentile she had no inheritance with the Jew just like we Gentiles had no inheritance so neoma was actually the one to inherit so she'd lost all of her first estate all of her Goods have been sold at public auction therefore she was been excommunicated and had gone away now when she come back there was only one person who could ever redeem her lost in Heritage that was a Kinsmen right next to her and boy has new so he had worked she could get this Gentile girl for a wife and what did he had to do he had to buy all of the estate of neoma in order to get in this estate which Ruth was part of the estate omnioma and the only man it could buy would have to be a person that was kin folks dear Kinsmen that was the law of redemption and the only way that Christ could ever buy the estate of the backslidden Israel was to become a Kinsmen the only way God could redeem the human race God himself had to be made flesh and Jesus was God made kin folks to the human race he was Emmanuel he become kin folks he took upon him not the form of angels but the form of a servant who washed the feet and limbed the fox's had holes and the birds of the air had Nest but he didn't even have a place to lay his head he eat drink he he cried he left just like other man and he was God not a prophet he was God amen because he had to be kin folks in order to redeem the loss human race so Boaz in this great type at Bethlehem look where this Kinsman was born to the human race had to be and then when this a great Boaz redeemed he had to make a public showing that he had redeemed all of her lost estate so he went to the gate of Bethlehem that little city again and he called the Elders of the city and he let them know that that day he had bought everything that had neoma had lost everything that she lost he bought it back and he kicked off his chute and threw it up before the people as an enzyme and if there's anyone who has any any reason to say something say it now for this is memorial and I've redeemed everything that she had lost oh blessed be the name of the Lord and when our Kinsmen came Jesus is Nazareth barred and Bethlehem he stood on top of the and lifted him up between the heavens and earth as a memorial that he had redeemed everything that the human race had lost in the fall amen how can men despise Divine Healing and the powers of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus when a public in sign was made of Calvary that I've redeemed the whole human race and everything that they ever lost redeemed our soul redeemed our body redeemed everything that we lost in the fall our kinsman redeemer came and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and offered up the inside and said it's finished what's finished everything is finished amen we're just walking right into our inheritance as the days go on we're walking closer and closer Boaz and Naoma after being married for some time they bought forth a son which added more to the lineage and that was orbited and he also brought forth his son which was Jesse and Jesse had eight boys and it was a great prophet Samuel who came with the crew saw the arrow the great prophet who went to Jesse and said God has chosen one of your boys Rule and serve my people and it was out in the dark side of the field a little Shepherd Shepherd yard we're a little Ruddy scrawny looking boy was brought David the older the youngest and Samuel poured the anointing oil on him in the presence of all these brothers and prove that God anointed in King where was that at Bethlehem glory to God in the highest oh Wonder Bethlehem where he was anointed king and it was in Bethlehem where David was born hey his greater son Jesus was also had to be born in Bethlehem because they're such a close knit between the two his father and son Not only was this great son only the son he was the root and The Offspring of David he was even before David and be after David he was born for Everlasting from Everlasting on but according to the Flesh and all the things to be fulfilled he was the son of David he was to be born years later in this same Bethlehem this little forsaken City but all the time in there do you notice there's working a great Mighty mystery that no one seemed to understand that's the same thing it is in God's Bethlehem today there's working as a mystery sign that no one seems to understand it it's something that goes over the top of the heads of the people they don't seem to get it no matter what's done or what's said in the mysterious part of the things that's done the people that say oh well I guess it's all right and wow but they don't understand they can't catch it they can't grasped that's what God was doing in Bethlehem in Judea is working all these little things moving up to come to one great hand David oh when he was anointed king as a a little boy he was ready to look up at but he must have been something in that that looked real to God they're a little bitty the smallest of the family the rest of the boys great big fine man would look good in the robes and a crown on their head God showed what he looks at not the outward appearance but the inside of a man he looked at his heart he knew what was in David's heart no matter how the crown looked on him he knowed he was hiding him a man a man man after his own heart which David would be a man after his own heart that's why he poured the anointing oil or had it poured up on David which the name David means beloved and it was well represented in Jesus the beloved one years later the son of David come to fulfill all things that have been promised this little city of Bethlehem is where this taken place it was on them same little Judean Hills were David heard of his sheep many years later that the Angels sang their First Noel on the hills of Judea overlooking Bethlehem The First Noel unto thee is born in the city of David Christ the lord when Angels first made their appearance the same it wasn't that Jerusalem the big church neither was that gilgale on neither was it a shadow or that had the religious denomination of worship all the time but it was a little Bethlehem or the spirit of God had been moving in a mysterious way bringing forth something there there where Christ had to come he was there inside in that same Little City with a King born that a mother virgin son it's sheltered and housed in its little Fortress the King of Kings and the Lord of lords we're not only did Samuel come to pour out the anointing oil with God toward them upon him and upon the world Christ the lord the Angels Herald is coming and saying to the Shepherds on the hillside who followed David the king years before see the mystery of God how great it is he was born in this great wheat belt which one week comes forth the basic principles of life and he was the bread of life I am the bread of life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and shall never die hard coming to college but pass from death Bethlehem the name Bethel b-e-t-h-beth Beth in the Hebrew word means house e-l stands for Elohim it's abbreviation Elohim means god b-e-t-h-beth e-l e-l is Elohim which is God the house of God or the bread of life is laid e-l-h-e-m finish it out Bring Back Your hell again with your e means a loaf of bread in the Hebrew El is God Elohim b-e-t-h is bth is b-e-t-h's house e-l is Elohim abbreviation then e-l-e-m is bread what was he the house of the bread of God the house of God's bread house Beth Elohim God l e m bread the house of God's bread means the Bethlehem where could he be born anywhere else but that but what's here to everybody for that prophet he said out of Bethlehem shall come him there's looking in Jerusalem there's looking at all the big Shiloh he said looking everywhere everybody come from oh it was a house of God's bread of life it's God's Bread Basket to the world there he was born in Bethlehem he could be born nowhere else there could be many great things that I was studying this week of the different spiritual aspects to that why he must be born in Bethlehem when I hit these new places the Holy Spirit just caught me away and I said oh God that's sufficient amen I see it now he could not be born nowhere else but Bethlehem there's a place of the bread of the nation it was the bread of all the house of Israel come from there and he was the bread of life that come down from heaven the spiritual manner has to come from Bethlehem the breadline the place where bread Lays Bethlehem the baking of the bread now Jesus being the bread of life a man may eat thereof he said and never die another great event that I wouldn't forget to call that was when David was in his worst of time when he was a fugitive it already been anointed he knowed what he was to be he was to be king God said so yet he was hated he was standing in between two great deep fires here was the Philistines on one side actually there was salt on the other side and he was a man without a nation just as the church stands the day the true Living Church of God without a denomination or anything else alone but yet she knows what she is how in the well can it ever come to pass the devil on both sides drowning at David taking refuge and strongholds to the Wilderness and in caves trying to hide out with a little band of faithful Warriors just a few believing like him but those men believe God that that would be the king so is the Believers today whose head out from place to place but yet they know who's coming to be king I don't care who's going to be president we know he's coming it looks farther away than it ever did when science is trying to overru and say they can build a man they can do this and they take a rabbit and take the pollen and make another rabbit and so forth trying to disprove God's work yet there is a people who believe God who stands just as Pat as they ever did no matter what comes or go they still believe God God's right the whole to God's unchanging hands in the midst of battle in the midst of Tears in the midst of sickness and death and everything they still hold of God's unchain they know that he's coming King people that ain't life and make fun of them they call them Holy Rollers call them everything they want to but they have wires of God stands faithful at the post of Duty might call them a healing group you might call him a bunch of Fanatics or whatever you wish to they hang to that King they know he's coming in power though they take his name in Dane and scoff and make fun and call the people who pleaded Outcast a bunch of backwash that doesn't bother them a bit they stay true at the post of Duty those wires that was with David stayed right by his son if a Philistine come up he had to fight whoever it was they were picked on every side toward David in his mind all confused he thought how can it be Lord you know leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation don't know what they're going through when you think of promises God's made then why don't he come to pass they don't tell their congregation they don't tell the people they associate with but there's many frustrations in the heart of a real leader David's sitting there his throat burning him is in the middle of summer the Philistines is taking advantage of that split between David and Saul and Saul looking for David or the Philistines also and then the police needs looking for the Israelites talk about a time of confusion just about like it is now David taking refuge in this little place and this little shelter everywhere he could get to the little strongholds that he could hold him to then he got up on the mountain on that Huts middle of the summer when the heat was tremendous his throat parching and flusterations and fears in his heart and wondering oh God how could it be you poured that oil upon me not because I chose myself but you chose me why did you call me from hurting the Sheep I did her and told me you'd give me this to serve your people that was going through his heart he sat upon the hill and he looked down and there the Philistines that come in and Garrison right in Bethlehem is alone then his little city was under government control of the enemy not only that but his own Father's House Jesse's house was under bondage to the philistine there was his own Nation his own church against him there was the end he was fighting years to church people he was fighting not because he wanted you but because he was forced to do it many times we were forced to do things and say things that we don't want to say a real spiritual leader but he's forced to do it he has to take his side and show his colors I'll take the way with the Lord's despised you said the songwriter so there he was on a hot day no doubt walking back and forth and looking down through that Long Valley of about 25 miles down their back that was his own father's house and and bondage to the Philistines they were sold just across shutter that and here come this one sitting right between see to take sides seen the great time that Israel was all broke up the church broke up in different denominations as to say here was David standing back here not knowing what to do and yet knowing all him rested the anointing they knew that in the honey was there they knew David is going to be king Hallelujah amen we know who's going to be king it doesn't matter who's going to be president I know who's going to be king you'll be king I know it take something to stand but God helped me to shut my eyes to denominations and everything else and look to that spiritual sight down here and he's the coming King I'll serve him if it's death let me die if it's my family it's my loved ones if it's not in nominations everything let me serve him I'll stay to him that's the Warriors of God like it's with David that had their hands on their sword walking anytime that's the way God's lawyers walk rain yeah man the enemy says you have to take a little drink to be sociable odd time's not your unclean vans amen there's the enemy there's the choir oh Lord you renounce that Oh Holy Roller stuff you believe I believe God on stand true there you are there's the Warriors Oh you mean there's no such a thing as Divine Healing that's what you think I know better there's no such a thing as the baptism the Holy Ghost them days is passed on that's what you think I've already received that you're just too late to tell me anything about it they knew the anointing was on that little Ruddy looking fella he's going to be king but David in his own mind was flustrated I can imagine this watching a minute goes back out there and sits down and looks down there and thinks my own beloved City Bethlehem look at it there were the great things of God has taken place or my father's father's father's father was born were my greats greats great greats grandmother honored in her in the time of the birth of Judah from whose child I'm from the younger laid something Supernatural she uttered the place in there Joshua placed the sun right in there and through theirs come all these things sure it's got to be I was a sheep hurt and you poured oil on my head you said I'd be king I believe you amen then he goes back and looks down there and thinks well Way Down Under My Little City where I was born that little group where I was with them good old days it'd be better if the methodists look back to their good old days when they're a few and far between little school houses out here in America falling under the power of God and throwing water in their face it'd be better for you Baptist to look back to where you come from too and the rest of you Pentecost look back where you come from it's Ryan In the Heat of the battle here David began to think oh I can ring that's all they got younger on that Hillside I remember when I watched them Stars how they moved up down here how God talked to my little boy heart I can remember when I got so in the spirit one day looking at the clouds and the Shady Green Pastures the eye screamed down the spirit insane the Lord is my shepherd Shepherd walk to the Valley of the Shadows of death all fear no evil for Thy Art with me here he was right in the jaws of death right then on both sides yeah I'll walk to the Valley of the shadow of death them good old days old days when God was with me a saying his Praises I am joining I remember one time the little lion come up one morning he got one of my sheep and the spirit of God Came Upon me and I went out and grabbed him and cut him to pieces I remember that Deliverance oh I can remember that evening just before the sun went down a bear coming and got one in our killing them great Deliverance I remember when I sing his praises and my childhood days when I heard in my sheep oh God take me back to that place take me back to my first love take me back and give me back my Shepherds to heaven give me back my herd of sheep let me alone back there to worship you that's sometimes we think that but we're in the heat of the battle something's got to be done we were boys once we were growing up man now the fight's on I remember when the sawdust barred up on the floor and the people screamed and shouted and you couldn't get around the place nowhere here for people but it's not that way today the title Zone oh it's not William brand the little boy preacher anymore you got to produce something yes sir there's got to be something different the time's on the battle's on the heat is on the talent to be delivered to people everyone's found written in the book now the time has come David and all these frustrations walking back and forth and thinking to hold this hot day oh it's so hot oh subtle might come from this way the Philistines in this way armies around everywhere and here we are sitting in the mouth of the cave and yet the anointing all on me how can it be oh God how can it be well I wish I had a drink then his mind goes back to way down there but the gates of Bethlehem there was a whale there just was no water like that water Palestine has some bad water they have uh and they have even to Blackwater fevered stuff in them and a lot of it is alkaline water which would kill you but Bethlehem is a water seat of the province too there was no water like Bethlehem David used to think when I take my sheep and start out of a morning I'd go buy that old well and drink oh how cool and how sweet and height quench The Thirst then nice Strokes are going yet anointed holy [Music] butter nice Warriors and he screamed out in his despair oh it's someone but bring me a drink again amen from that Old Well honored Bethlehem oh after dreaming of all of his childhood days and the victories and see him in a place where he's standing here between the fires he screamed oh someone could bring me water from Bethlehem now his Warriors cannot interpret his thinking but brother they loved him with all that was there the least of his desires was a commander three of his Mighty Warriors polar swords slipped off from the camp and cut their way 25 miles David they're going no doubt wondering where are they at what have they done where did they go to did they know they're jeopardizing their life they're right in the jaws of death through a 25 mile island Ambush everywhere and the swords have flickered in the shields of blasting but there are man their brother that they believed that would be king this is our degree oh brother I wonder if the wires today are willing to cut their way through formalism now of unbelief to refreshed in the presence of the Lord his desires the least of yours is ours if it's Africa India if it's to the street wherever it is the least of your desires Lord is my command death don't mean a thing to me popularity must what I am what I will be means nothing the Lord is to fulfill your desires that's the Warriors that's standing by the side of you if they call me holy Rover if my name is scandalized that they kick me in the streets that doesn't matter yours are is my command that's the real Soldier what did they do they thought their way through until they got to that well they dipped the bucket of water out and here they come back fighting cutting her away from right to left unto come into the presence of David said here you are my Lord oh my God what a man that was disgraced the man that was hated by the church a man that was hated by the king a man that was hated by the for his teens a man that was faded everywhere nearly but a little group that followed him they knew that he was a coming King today I know you he's saying great songs we build great churches we have great anthems and everything we praise to him like that but Jesus said it your hearts you're far from me for you teach for Doctrine the Commandments of man let the Holy Spirit come in and do something in the church showing the presence of Jesus Christ he'll kick you out the door in vain do you worship me they worship but in vain do you do it teaching for Doctrine the traditions of man but there's Warriors who believe him because why is you stand by with a spiritual understanding like a little Bethlehem sure well David picks up this bucket of water he looked at it and the Bible said it he poured it up on the ground said Lord be it far from me that I'd drink that because these my thy lawyers had jeopardized their life to go get her and to bring this water to me hits the blood of man I cannot do it in this Sweet Water that they jeopardize their lives and broke to the Enemy Lines to go we are to get David Pour It Up On The Ground as a free will offering to the Lord it wasn't me it was only fulfilling the scriptures because although Jesus from Bethlehem is the bread of life he also is the Water of Life sure it is what did he do he was represented both David and warriors because he was the king and he was a wire who came and broke to the enemy's lines amen conquered that hell in the grave poured out his own blood that John 3 16 might be fulfilled for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have eternal life that he give not the water that represented but I he was the water of Parish of perishing people that might have life how did he do it through his own blood by pouring it out not spilling it that's an accident he poured it out freely at Calvary after he broke through every line of the enemy and poured out his life blood that he might be the Bread Basket to the world and the fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins when Sears plans beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains that's why he was born in Bethlehem that's why he had to come because it was a bread sinner the bread of life it was a water sitter what is it the Waters of life and in Jesus was both bread of life and Waters of life therefore he had to come and be born in Bethlehem thou Bethlehem of Judea are you not the least among all the great princes you're just an ordinary little preacher you're just a little fellow but out of you shall which is from old Everlasting to Everlasting his four goings has been going forth from ever and from Everlasting to Everlasting that's why he was born in Bethlehem of Judea it cradled him and my brother the place he wants to be cradled today is in your own being your own heart that he might display from you the Waters of life to a perishing people and the bread of life to our starving people he is the bread and water of life which is the two essential things to a man's living is bread and water it's promisure let us power heads just a moment and in doing so I'm mature undivided attention have you ever been to Bethlehem this morning if you have never been to Bethlehem it was called April of Bethlehem to Ephraim of Bethlehem ephrath means a root come from the word h-e-m-p hemped means a root and the old ancient district there was called Ephraim which means it's the beginning of Life Christ said if you abide me I am the vine and ye are the branches he's the root of all life if you've never come to Bethlehem either of the Bethlehem come this morning and receive him as your savior and he'll forgive your sins will you raise your hands to him and say Lord God be merciful to me now and now here come to Jesus with all my heart I come to your Bethlehem the water and bread of

while we pray O Lord God this little broken up message brought from the scriptures though in all its symbols that you put it there maybe it's hid from the eyes of the wise of prudent be revealed to babe such as we'll learn how did little Bethlehem the least of all of them how did the prophets say that art thou not least among all the princes but it's so pleased God to bring from that little insignificant place the ruler of Israel Lord God out of a little group of people that's Washed by the Scarlet light of blood of the Lord Jesus you shall bring forth to that group somewhere Lord across this world Christ again that'll rule all nations with a rod of iron I pray thee father God that shall be merciful to each of us who are present now and may we come to your Bethlehem Oh Come All Ye Faithful we've been singing Come to Bethlehem Lord let them see does not go to a little city honor that was once then assemble but go to the reality Jesus Christ God's bread and water of life these who raise their hands receive him into thy kingdom just now Lord Parts bother Faith they they receive him it's by faith that they raise their hands and it's by faith that I believe that you receive them keep them Lord at Bethlehem or they'll never stray or go away like Naoma but may at the Times get hard may they stay right at Bethlehem it will be better by and by granted Lord now I pray that you'll be merciful to those who are sick and Afflicted there are those your lord who need thy Healing Touch oh Lord you did restore Bethlehem to all of her former glory you restore in the time of the depression once you've been sick you brought her right back and brought me home at Barley season and now father we pray that you'll bring every neoma and everyone that's in here that is in need I pray God oh lord it's just barley season the great Barlow that was seen come rolling down the hill into the camp of the enemy I pray God that you will bring that great barley off into this building now and that it may be the atonement of for the the sickness of the people as well as the sin and heal every person that's in divine presence I just feel Lord maybe it's just my own personal feeling but I feel that you're near The Nearness of You Now in here I believe that you're here and I say not this because of the people thou who knows the heart of man I pray Lord that somehow they'll catch the vision this morning like those Warriors that you're great omnipotence your great power your great presence you what you are the Son of God the king the anointed one that you're in the midst of us they'll catch the glimpse of it in their souls and be healed of their afflictions I pray this prayer is off place it to them in the name of Jesus Christ thy son amen I believe God all his words believe that every part of his word is divinely inspired I believe that he isn't I was but he's I am my ever-living presence I believe that right now in the midst of the people here you who raised your hand find your church be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ calling upon God washing away your sins believing it his soon coming is to he's to appear in his second coming I also believe that his presence is here to heal the sick to make well those who are in needy you don't have to necessarily just be one by one prayed for I proved that the other night to people that I just want to show them what had happened there was a certain young man who's sitting looking right at me now that had been in bed for days his throat was swelled so bad till he couldn't even eat or nothing his fever was way high and he had told his father and mother send it brother Branham come pray for me and somehow they didn't want to buy me because I was busy and this something led me to go to their house while staying there they tried to bring the young man a plate had real soft egg and something he earned some soft beans mashed up and he is trying to swallow him and water around take a finger and mash him his teeth is all swelled out and pus running out of him and he's trying to mash it like that with his finger and try to get it down his throat like that and he made about a bite or two and he just couldn't go no farther pushed it back I was sitting there without prayer there's just a little something you can't tell everybody what's going on no I said Lord Lord is close to the end of the year now there's a coming on a new something let me Lord is this it is this it and as soon as I begin to say that and say now in my heart now I know you're here the young man's got another bite and another bite and another bite another bite and cleaned up his whole plate and got his car and went away oh he's God his presence his presence it don't it just lets him be present the other day when they'd taken this last latest picture when I seen standing there I looked at I thought well I've seen the angels of the Lord on the levels and I know it was wonderful but when he'd taken this one then about three o'clock in the morning he woke me up and told me what it was to be and explained it all to me and how the armor and everything show me the things on it I've never seen I wanted to get it looked at it and there it was I had never seen it before Oh What a Feeling that brought to me a consolation to know that he's present each year Justice presence and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick the presence of the Lord is sheer to heal the sick the presence of the Lord is sure to bring conviction to Sinners the presence of the Lord is in the midst of his people and he is God's Bethlehem full of bread and water I'm so glad aren't you that we have a place to come to eat and live forever now the Lord bless you that's something you want to say brother let us stand to your feet just a moment our old dismissing song take the name of Jesus for the harmony love the Lord let's see you raise your hands way up now while you got your hands up now I put them down and shake hands with somebody standing by say God bless you children God Bless you that's right all right that's a so you get acquainted with each other all right now let's look right up towards the heavens and
