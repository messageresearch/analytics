[30:52] in the name of Jesus Christ I pray amen
[30:58] good to be gathering the house of God
[31:00] let's just open our Bibles in first John
[31:04] chapter 3 you're gonna read from verse 1
[31:13] until 10 says first John chapter 3 they
[31:21] says beloved what manner of love the
[31:23] father had be stored upon us that we
[31:26] should be called the sons of God
[31:29] therefore the world knoweth us not
[31:33] because he knew him not
[31:37] it says beloved now we are the sons of
[31:42] God not in some future time but he's
[31:45] very expressly saying now we are the
[31:48] sons of God and and do it not appear
[31:52] what we shall be but we know that when
[31:56] we shall appear when he shall appear we
[31:59] shall be like unto him like him for we
[32:03] shall see him as he is in other word in
[32:06] the in the greater revelation of who he
[32:09] is when he when he unfolds himself to be
[32:13] known for who he really is it says then
[32:15] at the same time we also are coming to a
[32:18] greater understanding of really who we
[32:21] really are
[32:21] it says and every man that had this hope
[32:26] in him purifies himself even as he is
[32:31] pure whatsoever come whosoever
[32:34] committeth sin transgresseth also of the
[32:37] law for sin is in the transgression of
[32:40] the law
[32:40] and ye and says and ye know that he is
[32:44] not manifested to take away our sin and
[32:48] you know that he is that he was
[32:51] manifested to take away our sins and in
[32:55] him is no sin whosoever abideth in him
[33:00] seeing it not whosoever sinneth had
[33:03] known had not seen him neither know
[33:06] anything no no yes
[33:08] little children let not let no man
[33:11] deceive you he that doeth righteousness
[33:14] is righteous and he and as he is
[33:19] righteous and he that he that committeth
[33:22] sin is of the devil for the devil
[33:26] sinneth from the beginning for this
[33:31] purpose the sons of God was manifested
[33:34] that he might destroy the works of the
[33:37] devil whosoever is born of God does not
[33:42] commit sin for the seed of God remaineth
[33:46] in him and he cannot sin because he is
[33:50] born of God he in this is the children
[33:54] of God are manifested that the children
[33:57] of the devil will so ever do it not not
[34:00] righteousness is not of God neither he
[34:03] that loveth not his brother let's just
[34:07] bar heads gracious Father we thank you
[34:09] for your grace and we thank you for your
[34:11] mercy we are here gathering in your
[34:13] presence Lord we ask that you speak to
[34:15] us we commit everything we are to you in
[34:17] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[34:19] you may have your seats it's good to be
[34:27] gather in the house of God amen
[34:30] probably gonna do something tonight that
[34:32] I never done before I thought of just
[34:37] giving you the title and then preaching
[34:41] it next time
[34:46] it is this there was so much just
[34:51] flooding in my mind this afternoon that
[34:53] I just didn't know what direction to go
[34:55] and and I trust I'll just be able to say
[34:58] a few words to help us kind of see this
[35:03] is and and and and the desire is to
[35:06] basically tie it with what was said this
[35:08] morning but it's just a greater
[35:10] understanding within my heart that I
[35:12] just want to bring out tonight and
[35:15] obviously would just rather lay the
[35:17] foundation so we can pick it up this
[35:19] time didn't
[35:22] this morning as we were listening to the
[35:24] message what house will that build me
[35:26] there was just you know just the way
[35:28] brother Brennan was saying things he
[35:30] just came to my heart and and they
[35:32] touched me so greatly before we can jump
[35:35] on out just would like to go back to
[35:37] some of those things he was saying he
[35:41] had come here he is reading the
[35:43] scripture and and he's now talking about
[35:47] how that he you know our pastor mention
[35:51] it that he there was no open doors for
[35:52] him it couldn't go no invitation for him
[35:55] to go preach and and here he is and he's
[35:59] talking about how that Moses was sent
[36:02] Moses writing the the Old Testament he
[36:06] talked about he talks about how that he
[36:08] was led in the wilderness because he
[36:10] said that the place that he was he
[36:12] didn't go by himself he was led to go
[36:14] there to go to Arizona so basically he's
[36:17] laying the same foundation and he also
[36:19] speaks and he says that you know when
[36:21] Moses in his time when it came time to
[36:24] write the Bible he says that he was also
[36:29] led to go in the wilderness it's fixed
[36:33] he says but that was the foundation of
[36:35] the Old Testament was Moses when he
[36:38] wrote when he says when he wrote them
[36:41] after he was called from his homeland
[36:45] where he had been born he was brought up
[36:48] to his people and he was sent in a
[36:51] desert to write the book of the Old
[36:54] Testament and then he from then on he
[36:57] talks about how Paul was also sent to
[37:02] the desert to a place where it was just
[37:04] by himself
[37:05] in he talks about how he was in the
[37:08] Arabia desert for him to go in and and
[37:11] to write the New Testament and then he
[37:14] picks up after that he now drops down to
[37:17] the seals and I know we heard that this
[37:19] morning and there's a purpose why I just
[37:21] want to pick up on some of some of these
[37:23] things so we can go on and and so he
[37:26] says and now if if the Old Testament had
[37:29] to be had had to be drove written they
[37:35] had been
[37:35] drove from the people into the
[37:38] wilderness to get an inspiration to
[37:40] write the Old Testament and in the New
[37:42] Testament to write what the writer was
[37:46] drove rather by the author into the
[37:50] desert place to get the inspiration to
[37:53] write the New Testament it says and the
[37:55] and and and and the book are sealed with
[37:58] seven seals it would it would require
[38:02] the same I believe in these days to open
[38:06] those seven seals to leave what your
[38:12] whole dear - what - what you cherish the
[38:18] little home that was given that was
[38:21] given me by my people among all my
[38:23] people and my friends and the church
[38:26] that was that was flourishing and
[38:29] nothing lacking to leave to pull right
[38:33] away from it and move away into a desert
[38:38] where you knew nobody and everything
[38:42] against you so I want you to just see
[38:46] how he's speaking about the things that
[38:48] he had to endure in order for him to
[38:50] bring us those seven seals mystery that
[38:54] was revealed to us I want you to see how
[38:56] his typing what Moses went through
[38:59] typing it with what Paul had to go
[39:02] through typing it without his own
[39:04] ministry and and as you read further on
[39:07] he he begins to speak as he's dedicating
[39:10] if in the very church as it speaking
[39:12] about the the very church here he began
[39:15] to - to say how that you know he says
[39:19] this this place it says I can instead of
[39:22] drying driving back to Jeffersonville I
[39:24] could just come here every time the Lord
[39:25] gives me a message it delivered it said
[39:28] I believe the brother believes just
[39:29] exactly as I believe it and all those
[39:31] things now he begin and and and if you
[39:35] read it the more you read it you begin
[39:37] to realize that he's establishing that
[39:40] this is not something the same as the
[39:42] denomination obviously you think about
[39:46] the earlier stage of his ministry he
[39:48] reached on those churches and there was
[39:50] great healing campaign and people saving
[39:53] people although most of the tapes we
[39:56] have and you hear the shouting and the
[39:58] congregation just up and and all the
[40:01] miracles and all those things that were
[40:03] happening but to realize that they came
[40:05] to a time where all of that was going
[40:07] away but it was nothing no one was there
[40:10] for the message anymore
[40:12] they all were in when there was time for
[40:14] miracles for signs and for all of that
[40:16] and but when he came down to the real
[40:19] identification with the word there was
[40:20] only very few left and and I began to
[40:23] wonder even how he began to think about
[40:25] his own ministry how did you know
[40:27] perhaps he thought that it would be
[40:29] something greater than what it was at
[40:31] that time and and that all the churches
[40:33] will come together because he tried to
[40:35] stand in the gap time after time again
[40:37] and and he he purposely didn't belong to
[40:40] any organization because he wanted to
[40:42] bring everybody together but yet it was
[40:44] at the very end with just that little
[40:48] building open a place where he can come
[40:50] and preach and and all those things but
[40:53] yet God in that very time it was
[40:56] establishing his bride if I could say
[40:59] God at that very time he was
[41:01] establishing another group of people
[41:03] that will come from the seed that was
[41:05] sown that will come and I couldn't I
[41:09] mean I was even say tonight to envision
[41:11] what the message has become today and
[41:14] the body of the believers and all those
[41:16] things and and how that they've grown
[41:18] throughout the years to get to the place
[41:20] where we are today you realize that the
[41:22] work has been going on even though the
[41:24] messenger was gone the very food that he
[41:27] stole continued the work of God now you
[41:32] just to hold on to that I I just want to
[41:35] speak for a little bit about the purpose
[41:38] of the seed the purpose of the seed now
[41:43] we as reread this morning as we we heard
[41:48] that this morning he talked about what
[41:49] kind of building are you going to build
[41:51] and and and so I want to take you just
[41:53] away from the physical building
[41:55] structure and perhaps use the analogy of
[41:57] the seed so we can move forward now we
[42:01] we realize that
[42:02] the Word of God is a seed the Prophet
[42:04] tells us that the the spoken word is the
[42:08] very original seed everything that came
[42:11] outside of the spoken see this the enemy
[42:13] seed that everything that God spoke is
[42:16] what's the original seed and we realize
[42:19] that it's the it's the Word of God when
[42:23] we see an apple tree bringing Apple when
[42:26] we see an orange tree bring oranges is
[42:29] because the very original seed was the
[42:32] Word of God it's not because the orange
[42:34] restore original said it's because
[42:36] that's what the Word of God said the
[42:38] seed will do and so we begin to look at
[42:41] that and we realize even as we sit here
[42:43] that there's been a seed of God planted
[42:46] within within the people of God that's
[42:49] what attracted that's what when we heard
[42:52] the Word of God that's why we were
[42:53] attracted because there was a seed
[42:55] planted and we realized that God when
[42:58] he's focused what it was a seed that
[43:00] went forth and it was planted in and
[43:03] when it came time even as momentum laid
[43:06] it out throughout the ages you begin to
[43:09] realize that in the first stage there
[43:11] was a seed that was sown there was a
[43:12] seed a bright seed that was sown out
[43:14] throughout the years and God will send
[43:17] messengers forth they will come and
[43:19] speak a word that would cause the seed
[43:21] to come forth in other words that will
[43:23] bring the seed out of what it was into
[43:26] the manifestation and and we realized
[43:29] that the seed itself became the very
[43:32] identification of the children of God I
[43:35] was sitting at home and I was thinking
[43:37] about how you know not that when we were
[43:40] born the the flesh was our
[43:42] identification we identified with our
[43:45] parents where we came from the food we
[43:48] ate our culture and all those things
[43:50] that's the only thing we knew and then
[43:52] we heard the Word of God then something
[43:54] out of the ordinary something within our
[43:57] hearts began to respond to the Word of
[43:59] God it didn't matter how contrary was to
[44:03] the flesh it didn't matter how contrary
[44:05] was to our understanding but a man will
[44:08] speak these things that this type of
[44:09] things will happen but yet there was
[44:11] something within our hearts that
[44:13] identified what was spoken
[44:15] something I can even say almost like the
[44:19] boy the program talks about that was
[44:20] looking in the mirror or heard something
[44:22] and there was something within their
[44:25] hearts that wanted to be what they saw
[44:26] in the mirror and so that was the seed
[44:29] became my identification we began to
[44:32] deny our own flesh and we begin to deny
[44:34] our own desires why because the seed was
[44:37] calling now I just want to stop there
[44:41] for a moment and walk well we'll get
[44:43] back to that when we when we speak about
[44:46] the seed when we speak about the very
[44:49] definition of a seed the seed is speaks
[44:54] about a part that we just see if I can
[44:59] find it here when we speak about a seed
[45:01] is the part and I thought the definition
[45:05] was so feeling with what was on my mind
[45:07] it says a seed is a part of a seed plant
[45:11] which can grow into a new plant the seed
[45:17] is part of the seed plant that can grow
[45:21] into a new plant there's other parts of
[45:25] the plant that cannot grow you cannot
[45:27] take the leaves and go and bury their
[45:30] leaves and expect to get anything out of
[45:32] it you cannot take a branch and go and
[45:34] bury it and expect to get anything out
[45:36] of it in the tree there's a specific
[45:39] element there's a specific part of the
[45:41] plant that is called the seed within it
[45:44] it has the ability to reproduce the tree
[45:47] again now I want you to think about what
[45:49] was said in this morning what house are
[45:51] we building I want to say this when God
[45:54] planted his seed it was the purpose that
[45:57] that that seed will produce another God
[46:01] the seed was not planted so he could
[46:04] produce denomination the seed was not
[46:07] planted so he can produce intellect the
[46:09] seed was not planned trying to produce
[46:11] understanding the seed went into the
[46:14] ground so he could produce another God
[46:16] in fact if scripture says us unless the
[46:19] seed is barri into the ground then he
[46:22] stays alone but when he's buried is for
[46:24] the purpose of producing much fruit like
[46:26] the
[46:27] see that went into the ground so if we
[46:29] can look at ourselves this morning and
[46:31] ask what is the purpose of the seed that
[46:33] God planted within us what is the
[46:36] purpose of that seed it's not to produce
[46:38] so to have a better life here on earth
[46:40] and and to try to do great things and to
[46:43] be appreciated by people now the purpose
[46:45] of the seed is to produce what God
[46:48] intended for that seemed to be so we
[46:52] realized that's why the seed became our
[46:55] identification often time you know
[46:58] because we realize we were the seed was
[47:01] put in the flesh it was putting this
[47:03] into this body and within this body we
[47:06] know that we have a fleshly
[47:08] identification with the fleshly
[47:10] identification that's what the enemy
[47:12] uses and often time we have to fight it
[47:16] at all time because what the seed is
[47:18] looking for and what the flesh is
[47:20] looking for it's too contrary things it
[47:22] brings us into a battle where we
[47:24] constantly have to fight the flesh in
[47:26] order to produce what the CDs intended
[47:29] to produce but when I'm says in the
[47:33] message I know my Redeemer liveth he
[47:36] says I said he says we will take for
[47:42] instance he speaks about nowhere he says
[47:45] we'll take for instance no way in the
[47:47] Bible there was a great flood that came
[47:49] on and all dears was destroyed the
[47:53] vegetation was destroyed the vegetation
[47:56] and everything was destroyed but Noah
[47:58] and his seed had not taken he had not
[48:02] taken and had had he taken into the ark
[48:06] it says God's purpose can never be
[48:10] defeated
[48:11] there's nothing can defeat it so how
[48:15] happy we ought to be today resting upon
[48:18] that beautiful revelation of the word of
[48:21] the Living God that there is neither
[48:24] things present nor things to come no
[48:27] sickness no sorrow no death no nothing
[48:31] can separate us from the purpose of the
[48:34] Living God now I want you to realize how
[48:36] the Prophet takes the scripture and
[48:38] interprets it because
[48:39] scripture says nothing can separate that
[48:41] from the love of God which is in Jesus
[48:43] Christ and now he takes it it says that
[48:45] love of God is the very purpose of God
[48:48] being manifested it's a very hot purpose
[48:51] of God in another place it says you take
[48:54] what God taught of this mind and you
[48:56] take what he had in his heart to do in
[48:59] other word he's giving the very
[49:01] description that is giving God as one
[49:03] having something in his mind and one
[49:06] having purpose within his heart and he
[49:08] says and when he's done those who think
[49:10] nothing can stop it and I'm talking
[49:14] about the seed of God
[49:16] the seed and the purpose and the
[49:17] intention of God to produce and as a
[49:19] race like himself you know often time
[49:22] I'm always it took me a while I would
[49:25] read and you would read in the news in
[49:28] the book of Genesis and it will talk
[49:30] about how a seed had to go according to
[49:32] his own kind and his own kind and his
[49:34] own kind and you ask yourself for what
[49:36] purpose and then you realize you come to
[49:38] the realization that God was protecting
[49:41] his own seed it was not so much for the
[49:44] plant in the trees and the oranges and
[49:47] the apple the purpose was God knew that
[49:49] he was going to have a seed that the
[49:51] seed will have to come and produce what
[49:53] he intended otherwise the devil was
[49:55] going to corrupt it so he says that a
[50:07] seed is the part of the seed plant that
[50:10] can grow into another plant it is the
[50:14] reproductive structure which disperses
[50:20] one it could survive for time it could
[50:25] survive for some time a typical seed
[50:28] include three basic parts the embryo a
[50:33] supply of nutrients for the embryo and
[50:36] the seed coat which is the very
[50:40] protective element on the outside so we
[50:46] can come here tonight and and and
[50:49] realize that the seed that God planted
[50:52] within us
[50:52] it was a way for God to bring us into
[50:56] the manifestation of what he desired and
[50:59] therefore he planted a seed within us
[51:02] and there's three main purposes of the
[51:05] seed that I would like to touch tonight
[51:08] and like I said I'll just go just laid
[51:11] the foundation perhaps we'll go we'll
[51:13] come back to these things one of them
[51:17] are just talking about is through the
[51:20] the seed is what identifies what brings
[51:24] identification to us because outside of
[51:27] the seed all we are is whatever the
[51:31] flesh has told us we were its whatever
[51:35] our parents has told us we wear when we
[51:37] grew up is whatever the schoolteacher
[51:40] told us we wear when we went to school
[51:42] is whatever the sport our coaches and
[51:45] everybody that we met a long life way
[51:48] whatever a talent or whatever they
[51:51] discover within us that's what we become
[51:53] that's all but we realize that
[51:55] regardless of what the world can tell us
[51:58] we are they something within us that
[52:01] identifies who we really are and that's
[52:03] the seed of God so it was given through
[52:06] us for identification so we may come to
[52:09] a place with the understanding of who
[52:12] God intends us to be and how we should
[52:15] serve it and then the second important
[52:18] element we we need to understand that
[52:21] with every seed the environment or the
[52:25] place the condition that the seed is put
[52:28] in is very important the scripture
[52:31] speaks if we can turn in Matthew chapter
[52:33] 13
[52:42] it's a very familiar scripture reading
[52:46] the parable of the sower it says it says
[53:01] the same day when Jesus the same day
[53:08] went Jesus out of from the house and he
[53:12] set on the seaside and a great multitude
[53:16] were gathered together unto him so that
[53:21] he went into the ship and said and a
[53:24] whole multitude stood there on the shore
[53:26] and he spake many things unto them in
[53:31] parables saying behold the soul went
[53:34] forth to soul it says when he sought
[53:38] some seed fell on the way side and the
[53:41] fowls came and devoured devoured them up
[53:46] some fell upon stony places where they
[53:52] had not much earth and and forthwith and
[53:59] then he says there sprung up because
[54:03] they had no deepness of earth and when
[54:07] the Sun was up there was there was court
[54:12] and because they had not they had not
[54:16] root they withered away and some fell
[54:19] among the tones and the tones sprung up
[54:21] and choked them but because it says
[54:26] another fell upon the good ground and
[54:29] brought forth fruits some a hundredfold
[54:32] some sixtyfold and some thirtyfold he
[54:38] says who has an who has who has an ear
[54:41] let him hear and he says and the
[54:44] disciple came and said unto him why
[54:47] speak adapt in parrot to them in parable
[54:50] and he answered and said unto
[54:52] because it's given unto you to know the
[54:55] mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to
[54:59] them it is not given for whatsoever for
[55:03] whatsoever head to him
[55:06] shall be given and he shall have more
[55:12] and he shall have more abundance but
[55:16] whosoever he had not from him shall be
[55:21] taken away even that that he had
[55:25] therefore speak I to them in parable
[55:28] because they day seeing see not and
[55:32] hearing they hear not neither do they
[55:37] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[55:41] prophecy of Isaiah which saith by
[55:44] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[55:48] understand and seeing ye shall ye shall
[55:52] see and shall not perceive for this
[55:56] people heart is what's gross and the
[56:00] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[56:06] they have closed lest at any time that
[56:10] they should see with a week they should
[56:13] see with their eyes and hear with the
[56:15] ears and they shall understand with the
[56:18] ears and they shall be converted and I
[56:21] should heal them but blessed are you are
[56:25] your eyes for they see and do here and
[56:29] your ears for the ear for the here for
[56:33] verily I say unto you that many prophets
[56:35] and righteous men have desired to see
[56:39] those things which ye see and have and
[56:43] have not seen them and to hear those
[56:46] things which ye hear and have not heard
[56:50] them so here he is speaking to them
[56:53] bringing them to the place where and we
[56:57] realized later in the chapter he gives
[56:59] them the very definition of what he was
[57:01] talking about when he when he comes and
[57:04] he explains the parable
[57:05] but we realized that the scripture is
[57:08] very expressly telling us that there in
[57:12] the purpose of the seed that the seed
[57:14] had to be placed in the right kind of
[57:16] ground so that he may grow that this
[57:19] seed had to be taken and and and it
[57:22] wasn't and I want to say this the seed
[57:25] was not just planted and and and walked
[57:28] away from that the seed will do
[57:31] everything by itself the seed was given
[57:34] and planted that someone may take care
[57:37] of it that you may water it that he may
[57:39] work the ground and remove all the tones
[57:42] and everything so that the seed may
[57:44] actually be built up come to the place
[57:47] where it would produce fruits because
[57:50] there's no purpose of planting the seed
[57:52] unless there's a desire to see a tree
[57:55] and the fruits of it so if the seed is
[57:58] our identification if the seed I tell
[58:02] you there's so many times as a even a
[58:04] secretion there's so many times we find
[58:06] ourselves you know do all kinds of
[58:09] things and you realize I can't believe I
[58:11] did this so I went there or I should
[58:13] have done this and this and the seed was
[58:15] what was picking you up from the dust
[58:17] and any way you will go and and get to a
[58:20] place where you realize I just I'm just
[58:23] a miserable failure this he tells you
[58:25] you get up and you continue walking
[58:27] it was the seed of God talking to you
[58:30] the seed came in and when we find
[58:33] ourselves desperate and we didn't know
[58:35] which was in and out or we thought we
[58:37] believed and yet everything is crumbling
[58:40] it we thought we understood but yet on
[58:42] descending was little the seed was there
[58:44] to keep you up when we don't understand
[58:47] the seed is there to give us the faith
[58:49] that we need in order for us to walk and
[58:53] so we realized that was God building his
[58:57] kids is his tree you know but a random
[59:00] talks about the restoration of the bride
[59:01] tree that was God building his stream he
[59:04] started off with the seed he knew that
[59:07] there was a seed that I planted in the
[59:09] last time I planted in the LA sage that
[59:12] I will come again and I will come and I
[59:14] will speak my word through the sieve and
[59:17] sin will become a mighty tree so so find
[59:22] out
[59:22] it's that seed that we protect its that
[59:25] seed that we water
[59:26] it's that seed that we do we bring into
[59:28] the presence of the Sun and we let the
[59:31] Sun warm it out the warm up the crown
[59:33] that we wanted to grow and to grow why
[59:36] why because in doing so the seed is
[59:40] growing out of the seed is the tree
[59:42] expected to come forth so we realize
[59:48] that becomes a very important element
[59:50] but when I'm continues on in the message
[59:53] no it's not he continues on he says then
[59:57] we find out that in in we find out that
[1:00:02] in that day that all he says we find out
[1:00:08] that in that day that all the world was
[1:00:13] going on to be destroyed he continued to
[1:00:15] speak about Noah was going to be
[1:00:18] destroyed by the flood that God made he
[1:00:22] says with another God made a preparation
[1:00:25] in preparation for what cause he says to
[1:00:31] preserve his purpose he did it in the
[1:00:35] day of Noah he's doing it today he may
[1:00:40] he has made a preparation to conserve to
[1:00:45] conserve to his own purpose
[1:00:48] he will conserve he will conserve the
[1:00:52] church he will conserve the church he
[1:00:55] will conserve the people he'll conserve
[1:00:58] the subject of his great domain that
[1:01:02] death cannot destroy them so so here he
[1:01:06] is it what is the preparation that was
[1:01:09] made
[1:01:10] what is the preparation of the
[1:01:12] conservation that was made God Himself
[1:01:15] gave His Word to the product the age he
[1:01:19] gave his word to the people so that when
[1:01:22] they would receive that word the seed
[1:01:24] that was planted within them will be
[1:01:27] preserved the preparation of the
[1:01:30] preservation of the seed is in the Word
[1:01:33] of God is within the promise of the age
[1:01:35] that God has said so that when the seed
[1:01:38] receives that word is no way to be
[1:01:41] destroyed why because the word is there
[1:01:44] to preserve the seed he says and we
[1:01:51] realize that it is by faith that we'll
[1:01:54] believe this but the resurrection
[1:01:57] produces a solid foundation on which our
[1:02:02] faith rest nothing can destroy it as the
[1:02:06] poet once wrote he says oh what a
[1:02:08] foretaste of glory divine error
[1:02:11] salvation purchase of God born of his
[1:02:15] spirit washed in his blood what an
[1:02:18] assurance upon this solid rock the
[1:02:21] resurrection is a blessed love our
[1:02:25] blessed lover the Lord Jesus it says
[1:02:28] nothing can destroy it it has been
[1:02:31] planted it is the seed of God it is the
[1:02:37] purpose of God to give us blessed Holy
[1:02:40] Spirit it is the purpose of God to show
[1:02:43] us signs and wonders and miracle it's
[1:02:46] the purpose of God and nothing can
[1:02:49] destroy it all powers of Hell might wage
[1:02:52] might wage against it but it will not
[1:02:55] prevail it says we have God's eternal
[1:02:58] promise there may be teachers and there
[1:03:02] may be isms rise they may be great
[1:03:05] program rise there may be things that
[1:03:08] look like it would destroy it would be
[1:03:11] destroyed but it can never be destroyed
[1:03:13] it's the purpose of God to see that it
[1:03:17] will prevail so here he is is is giving
[1:03:22] us the complete understanding of what
[1:03:25] he's trying to achieve with the planting
[1:03:28] of the seed it is purpose to make sure
[1:03:31] that that scene will produce just like
[1:03:33] he promised in the beginning that cities
[1:03:35] there to carry you through and to
[1:03:37] protect and to
[1:03:39] speak when you can't speak it to tell
[1:03:40] you what to do when you don't know what
[1:03:42] to do it's the heartbeat
[1:03:44] that we have within us it's a very thing
[1:03:47] that kept us alive but we find out that
[1:03:50] he wants us to make sure that we put it
[1:03:52] into a ground that we preserve the
[1:03:55] ground and now we keep the sunlight
[1:03:57] coming why because the purpose of the
[1:04:00] scene is not to stay a seed but it's to
[1:04:02] produce a tree and the fruits of it so
[1:04:17] he says in the message what visions are
[1:04:27] he speaks it says see what it is you
[1:04:33] must know how to approach you must know
[1:04:36] what diseases are he says I adventure to
[1:04:42] say that less you be a lesser he it's be
[1:04:45] a doctor he says the one percent of the
[1:04:49] people here would actually know what
[1:04:53] cancer consists of it's a tumor it's a
[1:04:56] cataract what tuberculosis he says what
[1:05:00] a journey is how that he would come and
[1:05:04] be brought here he said where it's cut
[1:05:09] where it comes from life all those
[1:05:13] things it says the strange thing is in
[1:05:17] many times doctors don't know they know
[1:05:22] the growth is there but what causes it
[1:05:27] it's got to have a reason it's got to be
[1:05:30] it's got to be there
[1:05:32] for some cause and it's a life it's not
[1:05:37] your life it's another life that came
[1:05:40] into you it's another cell a developing
[1:05:45] cell a multiplication of self that's
[1:05:49] what you are it says
[1:05:50] that's what a Germans a cancer a tumor
[1:05:54] cataract or any germ it says it's in you
[1:05:59] for one purpose its it says it's a death
[1:06:06] in your mortal flesh now I want you to
[1:06:10] realize he's tying the purpose of the
[1:06:13] germs being there to the very purpose of
[1:06:16] what it's me it's there for so it's
[1:06:18] there for it to cause death its death in
[1:06:23] your mortal flesh and a cancer sucking
[1:06:25] your blood killing you it's the growth
[1:06:27] it it has no form it takes the firm from
[1:06:33] the natural from the nature of your
[1:06:34] father it says or of anything like like
[1:06:40] its kind it says every seed will will
[1:06:44] will every seed after its kind if you
[1:06:47] are a human seed if you are if you are a
[1:06:50] seed of a human being it will produce a
[1:06:53] human being a seed from a dog will
[1:06:55] produce a dog it says o11 that comes
[1:07:01] from the seed of the woman it says and
[1:07:04] the devil had fought and he had seen
[1:07:09] that he had fought to destroy that right
[1:07:13] see that Calvary and let's just stand
[1:07:17] here for a moment and watch something
[1:07:19] that takes place what display could you
[1:07:22] ever imagine of an omni pod on upon him
[1:07:26] omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient
[1:07:28] infinite God ever letting the devil DVD
[1:07:32] its purpose it said not not God he will
[1:07:36] never do it it says when he took when he
[1:07:41] took at his family in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:45] when the little Adam and Eve her lovely
[1:07:50] little head laying on Adams shoulder has
[1:07:54] he moved through the garden and if the
[1:07:58] winds blow Eve will say out he said Adam
[1:08:04] let it be
[1:08:04] peace and the wind will stop and the
[1:08:07] lion and the tiger will follow them
[1:08:10] that was Kidal it says and in the
[1:08:15] evening when the Sun was going down and
[1:08:19] it went to the cathedral and the palm
[1:08:21] trees all or whatever tree it was in the
[1:08:26] Eden day being there to worship a soft
[1:08:31] mellow light it says a soft mellow light
[1:08:35] God the logos came down over the top of
[1:08:39] the tree and he says children have you
[1:08:43] enjoyed yourself today on the earth and
[1:08:45] I have to come down to kiss you good-bye
[1:08:48] and lay them to sleep lay them down
[1:08:51] asleep and lay all the animal town to
[1:08:55] rest the night it says the father said
[1:08:59] that's good I like the way it was done
[1:09:02] so yes but when I'm laying the very
[1:09:07] foundation of what God imagined and
[1:09:10] wanted to achieve and how that he
[1:09:14] designed his own Eden and how it was in
[1:09:17] the condition under which it was and
[1:09:19] he's saying that every purpose of God
[1:09:22] he's tied to the restoration of whether
[1:09:26] that was in Eden that we just read about
[1:09:28] that everything all his motives and
[1:09:31] objectives and everything that he began
[1:09:33] to do after the fall was for the
[1:09:37] restoration of what this relationship
[1:09:39] with this relationship was in the Garden
[1:09:42] of Eden when he when he he thought about
[1:09:45] the seed of the woman bruising the
[1:09:48] Serpent's head and when he thought about
[1:09:51] adamant and and he talked about Moses
[1:09:54] coming in about Jesus Christ died on the
[1:09:56] cross all of that was the seed of God
[1:09:59] coming forth to the manifestation for
[1:10:02] what purpose for the restoration of what
[1:10:05] was in Eden for the restoration of
[1:10:07] bringing us back into that same
[1:10:09] relationship that we had with him in
[1:10:10] before but the difference was this was
[1:10:13] going to be a greater relationship why
[1:10:15] because
[1:10:16] had come into a place where he made
[1:10:19] himself known and he had this many
[1:10:21] attribute to manifest to his people but
[1:10:24] in receiving those manifestation though
[1:10:26] it was those manifestation will drive us
[1:10:29] back into a relationship greater than
[1:10:32] what was seen in the Garden of Eden God
[1:10:39] planted his seed so that the seed may
[1:10:43] produce himself I'll say this the main
[1:10:47] purpose of any seed is to reproduce the
[1:10:51] parents plant the purpose of any seed is
[1:10:57] to reproduce the parent plant if if a
[1:11:01] seed was taken off an orange the the the
[1:11:05] best that that seed could do the very
[1:11:08] capstone of that seed can produce is to
[1:11:12] come right back into a tree like way was
[1:11:15] taken from and I'll say this our lives
[1:11:18] will mean nothing unless we can come to
[1:11:20] a place where we can fully Express what
[1:11:23] God intended for us to express unless we
[1:11:26] can come to a place where we can reflect
[1:11:28] a nothing but God himself just like it
[1:11:31] was in the beginning he says when the
[1:11:37] infinite God who saved you here knowing
[1:11:42] that it's going to lose you next week or
[1:11:45] next month or next year he says why he
[1:11:49] says it will defeat his very purpose
[1:11:51] very purpose he can't lose you he can't
[1:11:55] he says he can't lose you he that
[1:12:00] heareth my word and believe in him that
[1:12:03] sent me has everlasting life and shall
[1:12:05] never come into judgment but is done
[1:12:09] passed from death unto life can't do it
[1:12:12] it says he'll do no more he was born of
[1:12:17] God he that is born of God does not
[1:12:21] commit sin for the City of God remaineth
[1:12:23] in him he cannot sin how can you sin
[1:12:26] when sin when this when there's no when
[1:12:29] does
[1:12:29] scene offering for him how can he be
[1:12:32] sick
[1:12:33] when there's perfect health how can he
[1:12:36] be blind why can he be blind when I can
[1:12:40] see oh my how can I be in the building
[1:12:44] and out of the building at the same time
[1:12:50] it says how can I be drunk and sober at
[1:12:53] the same time how can it be
[1:12:55] oh it says when you are safe you are
[1:12:58] under the Atonement your sins are
[1:13:01] written unto you you are not written
[1:13:04] unto you so here he is and that's why we
[1:13:08] even wear it with what our pastor was
[1:13:11] saying this morning we recognize the
[1:13:14] importance of the seed we realized that
[1:13:16] it was that what God has planted for the
[1:13:19] purpose of bringing us back because he
[1:13:22] didn't care about what flesh not so much
[1:13:24] about what flesh the seed was in because
[1:13:27] even predestinated the flesh but he knew
[1:13:29] that there was a seed within the flesh
[1:13:31] and he knew what that seed was going to
[1:13:33] produce therefore when he laid a seed
[1:13:35] it's up to us to continually lay that
[1:13:39] seed in the presence of the Sun you know
[1:13:42] you you think about what this shutdown
[1:13:44] is done and and often time if you're not
[1:13:47] careful people get stuck into the
[1:13:50] routine because everybody wanted to be
[1:13:52] out so much you come to the realization
[1:13:54] that you know when life is like he is
[1:13:57] all we do is just go with the flow and
[1:13:59] you know we go to our jobs and we come
[1:14:02] back and this this to do and they start
[1:14:03] to do and there is everything where the
[1:14:06] this perhaps was something that God
[1:14:09] wanted to attract our attention but if
[1:14:12] we're not careful we felt like a get
[1:14:14] into the routine well you know now it's
[1:14:16] head down we're just going to do this we
[1:14:18] develop a new routine that we're going
[1:14:20] to do so we can get by and every time
[1:14:22] something stopped well we find another
[1:14:23] way to go not just stopping for a moment
[1:14:26] and asking God there's the seed what's
[1:14:28] in here
[1:14:29] now we just read here brother Branham
[1:14:31] says that they said such an hunger
[1:14:33] within my heart to see the spirit moving
[1:14:36] it's in such a hunger within my heart to
[1:14:38] see God manifested that such a not
[1:14:41] this after the seal it's still hunger
[1:14:44] and then you would say well that was the
[1:14:46] very cup stone what would it hunger for
[1:14:48] why because as long as we are in this
[1:14:50] flesh there's a manifestation of God to
[1:14:53] be had it's it's it's the devil is not
[1:14:58] concerned about all the claims we can
[1:15:01] put on ourselves you know I was I was so
[1:15:04] Marvel you know I was with but of
[1:15:08] Matthew I believe on Friday Oh Saturday
[1:15:13] I can't remember right now we stopped at
[1:15:17] his place and and so there was this
[1:15:19] little clip that I was shown and I went
[1:15:21] home and I and I watch it was basically
[1:15:24] I believe it's um just a little mini
[1:15:27] series about Jesus and I just captivated
[1:15:30] in my mind it's just one particular
[1:15:32] scene that really caught me and this is
[1:15:34] when they came in they lured the
[1:15:37] paralyzed man into the room where Jesus
[1:15:40] was because there was no room to enter
[1:15:42] everywhere was blocked in and so the
[1:15:44] Pharisees came at the window and they
[1:15:46] began to question him who are you what
[1:15:49] students are you and what school do you
[1:15:51] go to and who gave you the authority to
[1:15:53] do this and we don't even recognize you
[1:15:55] but how by what power do you do all
[1:15:57] those things and so he looked at them
[1:16:00] and he seemed to have not paid attention
[1:16:02] and he looked and he looks at the blind
[1:16:04] the paralyzed man in this sense I say
[1:16:07] unto you that scenes are forgiven there
[1:16:09] and they were all in shock
[1:16:11] how can a man say these things only God
[1:16:15] can forgive sin and then after that he
[1:16:17] looks at it man and he says now I want
[1:16:20] you to stand up take that bed and walk
[1:16:22] he says which one is difficult to say
[1:16:25] that sins are forgiven thee or to say
[1:16:27] that take up thy bed and walk
[1:16:29] I'm telling I will live in a time where
[1:16:32] God is talking to us not just that the
[1:16:35] scene has been forgiven but it's going
[1:16:37] to you today to stand up and walk why
[1:16:40] because any man can say whatever they
[1:16:42] want any person can say what they want
[1:16:45] to say but this man who can come and say
[1:16:48] and God goes behind and it stands behind
[1:16:50] man and produces the word that he said
[1:16:53] that's what we have received it's not
[1:16:56] some man's understanding where Brussels
[1:16:59] can standard say if all I just said here
[1:17:02] is the Word of God if for everything I
[1:17:05] just told you is the truth then let him
[1:17:08] come and manifest what I just said and
[1:17:14] that's where we are standing on the
[1:17:17] manifested Word of God anything that all
[1:17:23] the churches as far as the claim we can
[1:17:26] lay all of him out Methodist Baptist and
[1:17:29] everything and everyone with their own
[1:17:31] kind but what it's most important it's
[1:17:36] the manifestation of God for the promise
[1:17:39] of that hour and you realize even in
[1:17:42] this in the house for enemies wanting to
[1:17:45] make it very clear that this is not a
[1:17:48] denomination that this is this is built
[1:17:51] upon the foundation of the opening of
[1:17:54] the seals this church that we're about
[1:17:56] to have here it's not we not restricted
[1:17:59] we don't say we believe this we don't
[1:18:01] believe that he just say he believes the
[1:18:03] same way that I believe why which is
[1:18:05] that God has revealed to us in this Las
[1:18:08] age he sent us a messenger and that's
[1:18:10] why we believe if the musician could
[1:18:13] come so he says
[1:18:25] did not have it said blessed is a man
[1:18:28] that God will not reckon sin or impurity
[1:18:34] sin God the hold sin against his
[1:18:38] creation he says that strong
[1:18:44] it isn't skim milk but it's the Bible
[1:18:51] God will not reckon sin against the
[1:18:55] righteous God by His grace through
[1:18:59] predestination not willing that any
[1:19:03] should perish but at all come into the
[1:19:09] repentance but being infinite know whom
[1:19:14] come and who can who cannot come but it
[1:19:18] could predestinate everything to work to
[1:19:22] his will if he didn't do it why did he
[1:19:27] permit the sin to come in the first
[1:19:29] place he was the savior if there would
[1:19:35] be no snot a sin he would have never
[1:19:38] been a savior the attribute within him
[1:19:42] could not be pulled out we here to pull
[1:19:48] out of his attribute we here to bring it
[1:19:51] down all of those that whatever we find
[1:19:53] ourselves in need of there is an
[1:19:55] attribute somewhere that we can pull
[1:19:58] down to otherwise it would not be there
[1:20:02] because the law of contrast will make
[1:20:05] sure that it's not there it's there
[1:20:07] because within God there's something
[1:20:10] that we can pull down so that it will be
[1:20:12] manifested let's all stand tonight
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:21] so it's very important that we keep our
[1:20:25] focus on that on that fruit bearing tree
[1:20:29] and that we may look at ourselves
[1:20:31] regardless of where we find ourselves
[1:20:34] that we may focus on the fruit bearing
[1:20:36] tree and say that within me there's a
[1:20:39] seed that was planted but on my stool
[1:20:42] that I know to planted to water it and
[1:20:45] to do all that I can to kick the ground
[1:20:47] so that the sunlight may come and and
[1:20:50] this tree may grow and may grow and may
[1:20:53] come to a place where we will produce
[1:20:55] the fruit you know I was I was looking
[1:21:00] at this little clip I came across and I
[1:21:03] thought it was a wonderful and he was
[1:21:06] talking about the very cycle of life and
[1:21:09] and and and he was talking at a place it
[1:21:13] was talking about almost the journey of
[1:21:15] the seed and how that the seed is
[1:21:17] planted and it comes and he grows and it
[1:21:20] produces the fruits and the fruits are
[1:21:22] taken and it's taken and fed into the
[1:21:25] birds and the animals and all of those
[1:21:27] things and how the humans use the grains
[1:21:29] of it and all of this you realized that
[1:21:32] life exists itself because the the the
[1:21:35] the scene is doing what it was supposed
[1:21:37] to do I want you to just imagine for a
[1:21:41] second if every seed that was planted
[1:21:42] would not bring any fruits where would
[1:21:46] we be if every seed that was planted
[1:21:49] refused to bring forth of what it was
[1:21:52] planted for or it failed to come to the
[1:21:55] manifestation of it this world will not
[1:21:57] exist we will not have any food to eat
[1:21:59] or anything the reason why all of us in
[1:22:02] law is because every seed that was
[1:22:05] planted stuck to his purpose it did what
[1:22:08] it was supposed to do the water if they
[1:22:11] did and he grew and and and the seed
[1:22:13] itself has to die it has to remove of
[1:22:16] its protective and and come to a place
[1:22:19] where it died so life can come within
[1:22:21] itself
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:24] let's just our heads gracious father was
[1:22:28] so thankful for your word know the hard
[1:22:34] purpose of every believers to manifest
[1:22:38] what you've called us loathe is the
[1:22:42] hunger that's the hunger of our heart
[1:22:44] and that's the very heartbeat that we
[1:22:47] haven't is always to look around and to
[1:22:52] check and do measuring to make sure that
[1:22:55] we're not being deceived by the enemy to
[1:22:58] make sure that we are not being caught
[1:23:00] up too much in the things of the world
[1:23:02] and that we'll make sure that we are not
[1:23:04] being laid aside too much and that our
[1:23:10] hearts and our desires always towards
[1:23:13] your Lord father we ask tonight Lord
[1:23:18] even as we desire for the manifestation
[1:23:20] you said that that bride will be the
[1:23:23] very manifestation it said that that
[1:23:26] shout it says the shout itself was the
[1:23:29] very word that went forth calling
[1:23:32] bringing forth the bride Lord we are
[1:23:35] being brought forth by you O God and we
[1:23:38] pray tonight Lord if we got distracted
[1:23:41] and looking side and deciding and
[1:23:44] getting caught up within the life itself
[1:23:46] Lord we pray tonight that you just focus
[1:23:49] our eyes one more time that we may look
[1:23:52] to you and come into the greater
[1:23:54] realization of what you're doing but
[1:23:57] because there's nothing more that we
[1:24:00] desire than to come into the
[1:24:01] manifestation we love you and we commit
[1:24:04] everything we are to you and ask those
[1:24:06] things in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:08] refrain hey mind him head let's just
[1:24:12] sing now
[1:24:12] [Music]

[1:24:48] I adore
[1:24:52] Lamb of God
[1:24:55] I

[1:25:05] you Jesus you vida
[1:25:10] to me I adore let's sing it against
[1:25:17] murder David comes
[1:25:18] oh you saw me in my me you pay the price
[1:25:24] for me
[1:25:25] and rely I have been set free now I am
[1:25:34] not the same you to my sin and shame for
[1:25:41] let's draw holy name whoa
[1:25:47] door
[1:25:49] you
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:26:19] hey man I don't I don't use these but I
[1:26:22] mean that's just wonderful what we heard
[1:26:25] tonight you know I I just that statement
[1:26:31] just burned in my heart that the purpose
[1:26:36] of that seed is to reproduce the parent
[1:26:39] and you know it just it just struck me
[1:26:43] so much that you know bro gram said if
[1:26:47] God ever does anything he does it right
[1:26:50] the first time because if he didn't then
[1:26:55] that means he couldn't improve upon it
[1:26:58] and so when in the beginning was the
[1:27:04] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:27:07] Word was made flesh it's okay if Jesus
[1:27:12] was the son of God and he was in God's
[1:27:16] thinking before the foundation of the
[1:27:19] world and he was part of God and God
[1:27:23] expressed him than any other son that
[1:27:28] God ever had had to come the same way it
[1:27:33] had to be identical so we had to be in
[1:27:37] his thinking and so we were in the
[1:27:40] beginning we were with God and we were
[1:27:43] the Word of God and we were a part of
[1:27:46] God and that word was made flesh I mean
[1:27:51] it's just so beautiful we call it seed
[1:27:53] we call it predestinated word we call it
[1:27:57] thought but the reason it's it's seed is
[1:28:00] because we saw that working in nature
[1:28:03] analogy it's just beautiful to think
[1:28:05] that we were with him in the beginning
[1:28:08] and just as Jesus came without sin so he
[1:28:14] could be a redeemer but yet that seed
[1:28:17] was in us and he redeemed that earth and
[1:28:19] oh it just it thrills my heart and I
[1:28:23] think that's our heart's desire is to
[1:28:26] really show the world the love of Jesus
[1:28:30] Christ shed abroad in our heart by the
[1:28:34] Holy Spirit a real lead people with
[1:28:39] fruit of the Spirit the parent of the
[1:28:45] sons and daughters of God to produce the
[1:28:48] fruit of that parent which is the Spirit
[1:28:52] of God I that just makes me happy I know
[1:28:55] I got to go work on it amen I got to
[1:28:59] prune the tree I've got to water it and
[1:29:02] I've got to loosen the soil and I got a
[1:29:05] feed at the Word of God and and let it
[1:29:09] manifest to the glory of the one that I
[1:29:13] love amen Lord richly bless you I just
[1:29:17] want to let any of those that are might
[1:29:19] be watching there's plenty of room in
[1:29:22] the church house if you'd like to come
[1:29:24] out I hope you haven't got too
[1:29:26] comfortable on your couch and I
[1:29:29] certainly hope you haven't got to the
[1:29:32] place that you're eating popcorn and
[1:29:33] potato chips but that you're really
[1:29:38] entering in I know that some have had
[1:29:41] coffee and I can understand that but
[1:29:44] let's just put it in our hearts desire
[1:29:48] to get back together and things are
[1:29:51] starting to open up and we're going to
[1:29:54] start making adjustments accordingly and
[1:29:57] maybe let some of the lower risk people
[1:30:00] come a little closer together but so
[1:30:02] just bear with us but I hope everybody
[1:30:05] wants to come back
[1:30:07] or amen I talked to my mom this
[1:30:10] afternoon and she made me late to church
[1:30:13] but that was all right I wasn't get a
[1:30:16] stop talking to her you know and I
[1:30:19] thought I said mom I said if the Lord
[1:30:23] would take you home at 97 sure will be
[1:30:27] 98 in July I said it ain't no virus they
[1:30:30] took you home you know so you know I
[1:30:34] hate to see her live in fear the last
[1:30:39] times of her life you know I said that's
[1:30:43] not going to be what taking you and and
[1:30:47] and you know and I just said I said
[1:30:50] you're not going anywhere till I get a
[1:30:52] chance to see you again and that's just
[1:30:56] the way that I feel you know I I just I
[1:30:59] don't want to live in fear you know what
[1:31:02] I mean I want to live with like Billie
[1:31:04] said that purpose in me for that seed
[1:31:08] that God put there to bring forth the
[1:31:10] fruit and I don't want to do anything to
[1:31:12] stop that from doing that so I met
[1:31:15] really thrills my my heart amen
[1:31:19] I had a song I wanted to sing and I had
[1:31:22] the melody in my mind and I was I was
[1:31:25] trying to hum it all the way up here and
[1:31:27] then the minute I heard what you were
[1:31:29] playing it was gone and I think it goes

[1:34:40] that is great father but wonderful words
[1:34:43] we've heard tonight father the very
[1:34:50] purpose of the seed was to keep the
[1:34:53] species alive
[1:34:56] Oh father you created us and you're
[1:35:01] gonna keep us alive you gave us eternal
[1:35:04] life you made us eternal beings from the
[1:35:07] beginning that nothing could stop you
[1:35:12] from performing what you purposed in
[1:35:16] your heart we humbly and gratefully
[1:35:21] accept our part in your plan we know it
[1:35:27] was by the washing of the word and the
[1:35:30] revealing of your spirit father that
[1:35:33] were even conscious of the love that you
[1:35:36] have for us and father we ask that the
[1:35:40] love that you had for us that that love
[1:35:44] would be shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:35:47] your Holy Spirit when you prayed you you
[1:35:51] taught us to pray and you said for
[1:35:55] Father forgive us our trespasses as we
[1:35:58] forgive those that trespass against us
[1:36:03] that we might love as you loved us that
[1:36:07] we might walk the extra mile
[1:36:10] that we might give our clothes that we
[1:36:14] can be borrowed from and willingly give
[1:36:21] that that life that was manifested the
[1:36:27] seed that was so perfectly brought to
[1:36:31] resurrection life that's the tree that
[1:36:34] we're from that's the fruit that we're a
[1:36:37] part of that's the fruit that fell into
[1:36:41] our hearts that it can be reproduced as
[1:36:45] our brother so beautifully brought forth
[1:36:48] Lord now may that be our heart's desire
[1:36:52] maybe that's what we really want fathers
[1:36:55] to become little messiahs ambassadors of
[1:36:59] the kingdom reflectors of the power of
[1:37:01] the Resurrection Lord we need a lot of
[1:37:05] work done on us we have to die daily as
[1:37:08] Paul said I die daily that he might live
[1:37:15] and you might live in us father I know
[1:37:19] it's the desire of the hearts of the
[1:37:21] people father I ask in this hour that I
[1:37:26] may have a request as a pastor father
[1:37:30] that the joy bells might ring in the
[1:37:32] people's heart as you'd restore unto
[1:37:36] them the joy of their salvation and that
[1:37:40] this turbulent time that we're in will
[1:37:45] not rack us with fear that we will not
[1:37:48] be shaken but that the love of God would
[1:37:52] still reign and that the joy unspeakable
[1:37:55] full of glory would be our portion in
[1:37:59] this time other I just ask that you do
