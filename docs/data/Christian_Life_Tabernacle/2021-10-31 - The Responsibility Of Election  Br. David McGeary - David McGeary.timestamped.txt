[45:20] you would bring to them the desires of
[45:22] their heart

[45:40] god bless you uh we'll read our
[45:42] scripture and then we'll go ahead
[45:44] and start let's turn in our bibles to uh
[45:48] matthew the seventh chapter
[45:51] and uh we have a baptism after service
[45:54] uh sister
[45:56] and tonya i believe that i hope i
[45:58] pronounce that right
[46:00] are you here sister somewhere
[46:02] i don't
[46:04] know back there in the back all right
[46:06] god bless you
[46:08] we're anxious to see the lord bless you
[46:10] this morning
[46:12] also we've had some families that have
[46:14] come and
[46:15] we don't have a church membership and we
[46:17] don't have a book and
[46:19] the directory is not joining the church
[46:23] sorry
[46:24] it doesn't mean anything that but that
[46:27] we have a a
[46:29] a place that we can have your picture
[46:32] and if we see you and then we can go
[46:35] through the book and
[46:36] and say oh that's this person and maybe
[46:39] help us it's just for fellowship
[46:42] okay or maybe somebody's come on your
[46:44] heart and you want to pray for him
[46:46] and call him
[46:49] so it has nothing to do with basically
[46:52] the church or anything other than it's
[46:56] just a tool of fellowship for you so uh
[47:00] if if you don't want to put like
[47:02] pertinent information in there like your
[47:04] birth date

[47:08] or or
[47:10] you don't want to put your address or
[47:13] phone number that's fine too
[47:15] but your picture helps with your name
[47:18] because it helps me
[47:20] and
[47:21] i've been trying to learn everybody's
[47:23] name i've got about six or eight of them

[47:43] magda
[47:45] and a chassis
[47:48] or jose

[48:22] different singers and

[48:37] maril
[48:38] linder i don't know i said your name

[49:01] interpretation we can

[49:08] interested in you and your needs
[49:11] and so
[49:12] uh each of you especially our
[49:14] spanish-speaking people if you could get
[49:16] by and greet them and become friends and
[49:19] fellowship
[49:21] and then
[49:22] help us as we want to serve god let's
[49:25] read these scriptures this morning
[49:29] it says therefore all things
[49:32] whatsoever
[49:33] ye would that men
[49:36] should do
[49:38] did i give you the right verse saint
[49:40] matthew the seventh chapter the twelfth
[49:43] verse
[49:46] again saint matthew
[49:49] the gospel of matthew
[49:51] it's on page 1147
[49:54] in my bible
[49:57] so
[49:59] matthew the 7th chapter and the 12th
[50:03] verse
[50:04] therefore all things
[50:06] whatsoever
[50:08] ye
[50:09] would
[50:10] that men should do
[50:13] to you
[50:15] do even so to them
[50:18] for this is the law
[50:22] and the prophets
[50:24] you know man has taken that and put it
[50:27] in a saying do unto others right
[50:29] but this is what the scripture says it
[50:32] says it's the law
[50:34] and the prophets
[50:36] and a law is something that governs
[50:39] things so if everybody would follow this
[50:42] our world would be in tremendous harmony
[50:47] he says enter ye in
[50:50] at the straight gate
[50:52] for wide is the gate
[50:55] and broad is the way
[50:58] that leadeth the destruction
[51:00] and many there be
[51:03] which go
[51:05] in
[51:06] there at
[51:08] but straight is the gate
[51:11] and narrow is the way
[51:13] which leadeth unto life
[51:17] and few there be
[51:20] that find it
[51:22] and also
[51:24] let's turn
[51:26] over to matthew
[51:29] the 22nd chapter
[51:32] and the 14th verse
[51:42] it says for many are called
[51:45] but few
[51:47] are chosen
[51:48] let us pray our gracious heavenly father
[51:51] we ask you to bless your word to us this
[51:53] morning
[51:54] in jesus precious and wonderful and holy
[51:57] name we pray
[51:59] amen
[52:00] amen god bless you may be seated
[52:08] well i left my notes at home
[52:11] and so i tried to
[52:14] re-scratch them and i left them in the
[52:17] back
[52:19] so maybe i'm not going to preach with
[52:22] any notes
[52:23] so
[52:24] if i wander a little well that's fine
[52:27] i i we're trusting this morning
[52:30] that you love the lord
[52:33] and we're going to make a few comments
[52:35] and then we're going to listen to
[52:37] a little portion
[52:40] of the message one in a million
[52:43] and
[52:44] the thing that struck me
[52:47] about this message
[52:49] is
[52:50] election
[52:52] and uh the great uh
[52:56] um
[52:58] beauty of it and it's it's
[53:02] it's wonderful to be chosen
[53:05] or to be picked
[53:07] i i learned that
[53:09] early in life because i was always the
[53:12] last one picked
[53:14] i was not very tall i i most of my grade
[53:17] school
[53:18] days i was about five six inches shorter
[53:21] than i am now
[53:23] and i remember we would go to the
[53:26] community center or to the lot of
[53:30] what we would call the for pickup games
[53:32] you know or anything and in basketball i
[53:36] was
[53:37] you know the last one chosen and
[53:40] i always counted before i stood there
[53:43] because i always wanted to make sure
[53:45] that i wasn't the 11th person
[53:48] because if i was the 11th person then i
[53:50] knew that i would not be picked so i
[53:53] always looked around and
[53:55] and
[53:56] found a place and i'd get picked i
[53:58] wouldn't get the ball
[54:00] but i could run up and down and pretend
[54:02] that i was playing
[54:04] and i learned that you know it was
[54:07] something to
[54:08] be chosen
[54:12] we have a word that we use for it
[54:15] and it's called
[54:17] election
[54:20] and election is
[54:22] is
[54:23] something that
[54:24] you don't have control over
[54:28] i remember standing there and i didn't
[54:31] have
[54:32] control over
[54:33] anything and
[54:35] but when it came to baseball and
[54:37] football i could do pretty
[54:39] good at that so i always tried to be the
[54:41] captain
[54:43] so i could pick
[54:45] and i knew for sure that i would make
[54:47] the team
[54:49] and i didn't win many games when i was
[54:52] captain because i always picked from the
[54:54] the least people to the most
[54:58] you know and i always wanted to be like
[55:00] that i always wanted to have feelings
[55:03] for
[55:04] other people
[55:06] and
[55:07] this is the law
[55:09] and and the the prophets
[55:12] that as you would have others do unto
[55:15] you
[55:16] okay that so you'd want men to treat you
[55:20] to treat others
[55:22] and it it becomes something that
[55:26] it is a
[55:27] a wonderful thing that
[55:30] heals
[55:31] a lot of
[55:32] wounds in our life
[55:34] and a lot of heartaches in our life just
[55:37] the simple things of doing god's word
[55:40] are such a blessing to us
[55:43] but election
[55:45] as i i thought on this and i
[55:49] wrote down that election is a wonderful
[55:52] privilege
[55:53] yeah to be chosen it's called it's all
[55:57] a wonderful thing to be elected
[56:00] and it has its benefits
[56:03] there's so many benefits that go
[56:06] with
[56:07] being chosen and in in our what we're
[56:11] speaking of this morning
[56:13] the benefits of our lives
[56:18] and being
[56:19] chosen by god
[56:21] is to think that there's one that loved
[56:26] us enough
[56:27] and saw something in us that he
[56:31] chose in his life
[56:34] to
[56:35] pick us and impart to us
[56:38] eternal life
[56:40] there's a great scripture if we could
[56:42] read it and turn to it found in hebrews
[56:46] uh the third and
[56:49] uh
[56:51] verse of the uh
[56:53] of the second chapter of hebrews
[56:58] and
[56:59] and they it speaks this word it says
[57:07] it we'll just start with the first verse
[57:09] it says
[57:11] therefore we ought to give
[57:14] the more earnest heed
[57:17] now we're talking about
[57:19] election
[57:21] the benefits
[57:23] and
[57:24] the
[57:25] price
[57:27] or the cost of election
[57:30] therefore we ought to give the more
[57:33] earnest heed
[57:35] to the things which we have heard
[57:38] least at any time we should let them
[57:43] slip
[57:45] now
[57:46] so
[57:47] this is
[57:49] a
[57:50] a
[57:51] responsibility that goes with being
[57:54] elected
[57:55] and chosen
[57:57] we
[57:58] we don't want to feel
[58:00] as we
[58:02] speak a little bit this morning before
[58:04] we play 30 minutes
[58:06] we don't want to feel that
[58:09] election doesn't have a price
[58:13] you understand it doesn't have a
[58:15] participation
[58:17] it doesn't have something that
[58:20] comes with it
[58:22] that is
[58:24] uh
[58:25] the responsibility that comes with it
[58:28] can be neglected
[58:30] uh we too often
[58:33] enter into the thinking that i'm chosen
[58:36] i don't have to play
[58:41] you know i've made the team
[58:45] how many times have i seen someone that
[58:47] would
[58:48] maybe be on a team and many of you have
[58:51] been able to play
[58:54] sports and things and
[58:56] and the
[58:57] person gets injured
[58:59] or somebody
[59:02] can't show up or they become ill
[59:05] and you've been you're on the team
[59:08] but if you don't if you don't
[59:11] study the book and study the plays and
[59:14] are a hundred percent prepared
[59:16] then when you get called to duty
[59:21] you understand you're not there
[59:24] to be able to
[59:27] do what you have been
[59:30] elected or chosen to do
[59:35] so you haven't been chosen
[59:38] to the bride to be on a team
[59:42] you haven't been chosen to ride the bus
[59:47] that that's not what you've been chosen
[59:50] for you've been chosen to
[59:53] have a duty
[59:55] and like we said one of those duties is
[59:57] to do unto others as you would have them
[1:00:00] do unto you
[1:00:02] but you're not elected and you're not
[1:00:05] chosen
[1:00:06] with the idea
[1:00:08] in mind that that's the end of it
[1:00:11] it's the beginning of it
[1:00:15] when you were chosen you were chosen a
[1:00:18] sinner
[1:00:20] but then the spirit of god went moving
[1:00:23] on your life to build you into the
[1:00:26] statue of a perfect man
[1:00:29] and that is what your calling is
[1:00:33] is to
[1:00:34] to be molded and shaped
[1:00:36] into the images of christ jesus
[1:00:40] that we might be conformed into his
[1:00:43] image
[1:00:45] and so their
[1:00:46] election is not the end it's the
[1:00:49] beginning
[1:00:51] we have kind of turned that around a
[1:00:54] little bit
[1:00:56] and we felt that i've been elected it's
[1:00:59] over
[1:01:02] no
[1:01:04] you've been elected it's just begun
[1:01:08] you now become the lump of clay
[1:01:11] on the potter's wheel
[1:01:13] and and you've submitted yourself
[1:01:18] to the hand of god
[1:01:20] that he might mold you into the vessel
[1:01:23] that he
[1:01:25] had in his mind
[1:01:27] when he grabbed grab that lump of clay
[1:01:32] but many
[1:01:34] get on the wheel
[1:01:36] and they start saying this is what i
[1:01:38] want to be and this is what i want to be
[1:01:41] and this is where i want to go and this
[1:01:44] is what i want to do
[1:01:46] and our lives begin to change the
[1:01:49] pattern of god's word
[1:01:53] that's the biggest curse
[1:01:56] of denominationalism
[1:01:58] is they can't have fellowship
[1:02:01] one with another
[1:02:05] and he goes on to say here he said
[1:02:11] that we should let him slip
[1:02:13] for if the word spoken
[1:02:16] by angels was steadfast
[1:02:20] and every
[1:02:21] transgression and disobedience
[1:02:25] received a just replicant
[1:02:28] of reward
[1:02:33] you reap what you sow
[1:02:37] right you sow to the flesh you'll reap
[1:02:39] of the flesh
[1:02:41] you sow to the spirit you'll reap of the
[1:02:44] spirit
[1:02:45] and paul's pointing to something here
[1:02:49] because he's talking to the church and
[1:02:52] he's talking to the believer
[1:02:55] and they
[1:02:56] he wants us to understand the beauty
[1:03:00] that comes with
[1:03:02] being elected
[1:03:06] he says
[1:03:08] how shall we escape
[1:03:12] if we neglect so great of salvation
[1:03:18] which act the first began to be spoken
[1:03:23] by the lord
[1:03:24] and was confirmed unto us
[1:03:28] by them that heard them
[1:03:32] god also bearing them witness both with
[1:03:35] signs and wonders
[1:03:38] and with diverse miracles
[1:03:41] and gifts of the holy ghost
[1:03:43] according to his own will
[1:03:47] for unto the angels hath he not put
[1:03:51] into subjection
[1:03:52] the world to come
[1:03:55] thereof we speak
[1:03:58] so just think of the the the the beauty
[1:04:02] of election
[1:04:04] and paul speaking to us now you can't
[1:04:06] i'm i'm gonna point to a little
[1:04:08] something so
[1:04:10] just bear with me for a moment
[1:04:13] he's saying
[1:04:14] it
[1:04:15] angels heard of it and
[1:04:17] and uh
[1:04:19] and and it was called and we've got to
[1:04:22] be careful
[1:04:24] that we don't let it slip because
[1:04:26] there's a just recompense
[1:04:29] for the reward
[1:04:32] of what that we do
[1:04:36] and i know that we want to feel
[1:04:39] that
[1:04:41] i'm chosen so i'm going to be there
[1:04:44] but even the lord teaches is watch every
[1:04:47] man how that he builds no other
[1:04:49] foundation can be laid than that which
[1:04:53] was laid by the lord jesus
[1:04:57] he says so watch what you build
[1:05:00] because if you build wood and hay and
[1:05:02] stubble
[1:05:04] orc if you build otherwise he says your
[1:05:07] works are going to be tried
[1:05:11] and they'll be tried by fire
[1:05:14] and some will enter in by the fire by
[1:05:18] which they are tried
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:22] i don't want to have all that i done
[1:05:26] be consumed
[1:05:30] because i failed to take
[1:05:34] my election
[1:05:36] serious
[1:05:39] i didn't give it the value
[1:05:42] and the understanding
[1:05:45] that it really it was due
[1:05:49] never the fact that i deserved any of it
[1:05:53] but just to think that what that we're
[1:05:57] talking about today
[1:06:00] is not an election to history
[1:06:08] and chosen
[1:06:10] to look back on the history
[1:06:13] and to look at the
[1:06:16] the books and the chronicles and the
[1:06:19] at the
[1:06:21] signs and the wonders
[1:06:23] and come to the conclusion
[1:06:26] that jesus
[1:06:28] was the son of god
[1:06:32] and he was a true figure
[1:06:35] therefore i see that and i will follow
[1:06:38] that and i will believe that
[1:06:45] that places it
[1:06:48] into my hands
[1:06:51] i can choose to read i can choose to
[1:06:55] study
[1:06:56] i can choose to derive from the word of
[1:06:59] god
[1:07:00] the things that
[1:07:03] i feel are
[1:07:06] appropriate for the lifestyle that i
[1:07:10] choose
[1:07:12] and if i
[1:07:13] search enough
[1:07:15] i'll find other people that look at
[1:07:19] things the way that i look at it
[1:07:23] that have come to the same conclusions
[1:07:26] that i have come to and i will begin to
[1:07:30] flock together
[1:07:34] and
[1:07:35] we will discuss our thinking and we will
[1:07:37] build our thoughts and
[1:07:39] we will come to our conclusions and
[1:07:42] we'll begin to share those with others
[1:07:45] and we'll begin to build
[1:07:47] and we'll have a consensus
[1:07:50] and then we'll decide of what ways that
[1:07:52] we sh we choose to worship and what
[1:07:55] songs we choose to sing
[1:07:58] and pretty soon we've built something
[1:08:00] that's man-made
[1:08:05] we've got something that's man-made
[1:08:08] and then our question would be what are
[1:08:10] we elected to
[1:08:12] are we elected to what that we have
[1:08:15] built
[1:08:16] or are we been elected and chosen
[1:08:20] to
[1:08:22] for god to mold us and make us into that
[1:08:27] which that he would choose
[1:08:30] for us to be
[1:08:31] we are his workmanship in christ jesus
[1:08:35] foreordained unto good works that we
[1:08:38] should walk in them
[1:08:41] so just to establish this morning
[1:08:44] that we are not elected to
[1:08:48] a past tense
[1:08:53] many are called
[1:08:57] many have heard the calling
[1:09:00] and they've looked back and now we've
[1:09:03] got
[1:09:03] churches on every corner and groups of
[1:09:06] men in man's teaching those are those
[1:09:09] which are called
[1:09:13] they heard the call
[1:09:16] and they responded
[1:09:18] according to
[1:09:20] their thinking in their heart in their
[1:09:23] mind
[1:09:27] i call them brothers
[1:09:31] fellow christians
[1:09:34] i i was raised a catholic
[1:09:39] catholics were always given under good
[1:09:41] works
[1:09:43] and charity
[1:09:47] they always embrace the poor
[1:09:51] they always tried to take care
[1:09:54] of their own
[1:09:57] and i know i don't believe
[1:10:00] what they teach and i don't believe the
[1:10:05] that the pope is the
[1:10:08] vicar of christ and i don't believe that
[1:10:11] the body uh the bread that they pray and
[1:10:14] it turns into the literal body or the
[1:10:17] wine
[1:10:18] but
[1:10:21] though i don't believe those things
[1:10:24] i can't acknowledge that
[1:10:28] and fail to acknowledge that they're
[1:10:30] they're given to good works
[1:10:37] and
[1:10:38] and that's what they propagate
[1:10:41] they propagate doing good and forgiving
[1:10:44] and and taking in
[1:10:47] all wonderful characteristics
[1:10:49] but we also know that satan appears
[1:10:53] as an angel of light
[1:10:57] and so
[1:10:59] the call is one thing
[1:11:03] the election
[1:11:05] is
[1:11:06] another thing
[1:11:08] the choosing is something else
[1:11:12] in other words our choice isn't given
[1:11:17] as
[1:11:19] uh
[1:11:19] just uh
[1:11:21] uh
[1:11:23] i choose you now
[1:11:25] go do what you want
[1:11:29] the the very
[1:11:30] choice itself
[1:11:33] is because the chooser
[1:11:36] has a purpose in mind
[1:11:43] if it was just a calling this morning
[1:11:47] then we could have chosen any number
[1:11:51] can i take off my code
[1:11:53] thank you
[1:11:56] here thank you billy
[1:11:58] we could have chosen any number
[1:12:01] of of the
[1:12:03] places that are on the hills
[1:12:08] we could have went anywhere
[1:12:10] and entered in to the fellowship of good
[1:12:13] works feeding the poor
[1:12:16] helping the homeless
[1:12:18] which all things are good
[1:12:22] we would have we could have had
[1:12:23] fellowship
[1:12:25] with all those things
[1:12:29] but that's not what we are chosen for
[1:12:37] we are chosen for an electric purpose
[1:12:42] a particular
[1:12:45] and peculiar people
[1:12:48] chosen and elected for a specific
[1:12:53] work
[1:12:55] a present tense
[1:12:58] he's chosen us not to know him in
[1:13:01] history
[1:13:05] but to know him in his present work
[1:13:10] he chosen us not just to choose
[1:13:15] how we
[1:13:17] will duplicate
[1:13:20] and choose to perform his teachings
[1:13:25] but he's chosen us that he himself
[1:13:29] could be the performer
[1:13:34] now
[1:13:35] as we turn to listen i want to just
[1:13:42] see if i can find
[1:13:44] this statement
[1:13:46] to read
[1:13:55] to you
[1:14:07] he said
[1:14:24] yeah i don't know why it's not
[1:14:26] in front of me but he says
[1:14:31] he says it
[1:14:34] oh we'll just listen to it but what i
[1:14:36] want to say is is that
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:39] it is
[1:14:41] man was given
[1:14:43] to believe every word of god
[1:14:48] not just
[1:14:50] not just a portion of the word of god
[1:14:53] but every word of god
[1:14:56] and so
[1:14:58] so
[1:14:59] it's given he said
[1:15:01] if what was the test
[1:15:05] talking about israel we're going to
[1:15:06] listen to this and when we read this i
[1:15:08] want you to listen to it
[1:15:11] he says what was the test
[1:15:13] they all drink in the same rock
[1:15:16] they all eat the same spiritual manna
[1:15:21] as
[1:15:22] we're eating this morning
[1:15:25] but the word test
[1:15:28] proved them
[1:15:30] when it come to the time of canis barnea
[1:15:33] when they started over into the promised
[1:15:36] land
[1:15:37] and they could not go over until they
[1:15:40] were tested by the word
[1:15:44] and so the test
[1:15:47] became the word
[1:15:49] now your test
[1:15:51] is your election
[1:15:54] that's your test it's your election
[1:15:57] and so you can't prove your election
[1:16:02] by anything else
[1:16:04] other than the election itself
[1:16:07] so
[1:16:08] so i'm elected one in a million
[1:16:14] now how can i go to the
[1:16:16] 999.000
[1:16:20] and get any
[1:16:23] any approval
[1:16:25] or or any proof
[1:16:28] or any uh
[1:16:30] any acknowledgement
[1:16:34] because they're not chosen
[1:16:37] they're not elected
[1:16:39] so i can't look to anything other
[1:16:43] come on amen for the test or for my
[1:16:47] proof but the word itself
[1:16:53] that's the only place i have to go
[1:16:56] i can't prove to anybody
[1:17:00] that i'm chosen
[1:17:03] i'm elected i'm chosen you've heard a
[1:17:06] word
[1:17:07] sent forth by a message
[1:17:09] the church world
[1:17:11] they accepted the works they accepted
[1:17:14] the manna
[1:17:16] but the word was the test
[1:17:19] so when it came down to malachi 4 5 and
[1:17:22] luke 17 30
[1:17:24] being the word
[1:17:28] all the word
[1:17:31] not just one word but all the word
[1:17:34] that was rejected
[1:17:40] so they can eat all the manna
[1:17:44] they could partake in all the blessings
[1:17:47] they could do all the work
[1:17:50] but to reject
[1:17:52] one word
[1:17:56] and when it came down to receiving
[1:18:01] what god was doing in the generation
[1:18:03] that they lived in
[1:18:07] they couldn't accept it
[1:18:09] because they weren't chosen
[1:18:13] to accept that
[1:18:16] but you're elected
[1:18:19] now would you neglect
[1:18:22] such a great
[1:18:26] salvation
[1:18:30] now i'm going to put what's on my heart
[1:18:37] if you were one in a million
[1:18:41] and you possess something
[1:18:45] you were the only one that knew
[1:18:50] okay
[1:18:51] so maybe you have the
[1:18:54] let's go carnal
[1:18:57] maybe you have the
[1:19:01] formula
[1:19:06] that everybody needs
[1:19:09] to be free
[1:19:12] from the common cold
[1:19:16] how much more responsibility falls on
[1:19:18] you
[1:19:22] you're the one in a million
[1:19:25] you're the
[1:19:26] one that's chosen
[1:19:29] and elected you have the words of life
[1:19:32] you have the gift of life
[1:19:36] your responsibility
[1:19:41] doesn't diminish
[1:19:43] because of your election
[1:19:47] you still feed the poor you still visit
[1:19:51] the homeless and the fatherless in their
[1:19:53] affliction
[1:19:54] you still lay hands on the sick
[1:19:57] that they recover you may be one in a
[1:20:00] million
[1:20:02] but that's what you're chosen to be is
[1:20:05] you're chosen to be a light
[1:20:07] that shines in darkness
[1:20:13] we're not chosen to come together and
[1:20:16] put our arms around one another and say
[1:20:19] i'm chosen you're chosen
[1:20:21] but i i got to accept the responsibility
[1:20:26] that i possess not a history gospel
[1:20:31] but i present a present tense
[1:20:34] by election
[1:20:38] life
[1:20:39] amen
[1:20:41] and i'm called that that life
[1:20:44] might live
[1:20:47] amen
[1:20:51] and that's individual
[1:20:54] there's so much i'd like to say but i
[1:20:57] just would like to say it
[1:21:00] this way and
[1:21:05] i want to read this so if the brothers
[1:21:07] would get
[1:21:09] ready this this message is
[1:21:11] one in a million it's three different
[1:21:14] times
[1:21:15] that
[1:21:19] he preached three different segments i i
[1:21:22] don't understand how it was all working
[1:21:24] i want to find out
[1:21:26] and brother madam says this we're not
[1:21:28] going to listen to this he says
[1:21:31] and
[1:21:32] the second morning
[1:21:39] he says now so many times
[1:21:42] we press
[1:21:45] trying to get to this
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:49] or
[1:21:51] the other i guess
[1:21:52] see it's these signs shall follow the
[1:21:56] believer
[1:21:59] i didn't say if they would pray for the
[1:22:03] sick
[1:22:04] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:22:07] recover
[1:22:09] we must have faith
[1:22:12] ourselves
[1:22:14] in what
[1:22:15] we're doing
[1:22:17] we must have faith in ourselves in what
[1:22:21] we're doing
[1:22:22] what are
[1:22:24] why are we one in a million
[1:22:28] and i'm not trying to do math here
[1:22:30] that's not the point of it
[1:22:32] all right you're out you're out i'm in
[1:22:34] so
[1:22:35] you know
[1:22:36] that that's the only it's it's the
[1:22:39] expression
[1:22:41] and the understanding that you are an
[1:22:45] elected chosen person
[1:22:50] and that you've got to have confidence
[1:22:53] in that
[1:22:54] election
[1:22:56] because he's given to you something that
[1:22:59] nobody else can do
[1:23:01] but you
[1:23:06] and he said it's not
[1:23:08] praying for the sick
[1:23:11] it's laying hands on the sick
[1:23:14] so the desire in understanding our
[1:23:17] election
[1:23:18] is to understand that we've been called
[1:23:21] and chosen
[1:23:24] and if we can have faith in that
[1:23:26] that's what's going to put us into
[1:23:28] action
[1:23:32] that's what's going to make it real to
[1:23:34] us
[1:23:36] but if you don't have confidence in that
[1:23:40] you can't weigh it by works i hope i can
[1:23:43] express this but you've got to accept it
[1:23:46] by the very election itself
[1:23:50] the only thing you have to go by
[1:23:54] he said so
[1:23:56] he chose me
[1:23:57] i know he did
[1:23:59] i'm not going to neglect neglected
[1:24:03] but i hoped this morning
[1:24:05] that
[1:24:08] that can be expressed a little bit so
[1:24:10] we'll just
[1:24:11] go forward
[1:24:13] in this uh
[1:24:16] and if we're gonna pick up on paragraph
[1:24:20] 27
[1:24:21] this is the third time
[1:24:24] that brother branham comes to the pulpit
[1:24:26] this day he's done two radio stations
[1:24:30] and now he's doing another thing there's
[1:24:32] another crowd downstairs
[1:24:35] he's upstairs speaking to i guess a
[1:24:37] smaller group of people
[1:24:39] and
[1:24:40] but this is the next message in the
[1:24:42] series that we've been going through
[1:24:45] and i believe it so
[1:24:47] just think
[1:24:49] the responsibility of election
[1:24:53] the price is the reproach
[1:24:57] the benefit
[1:24:58] is eternal life
[1:25:00] let's just listen for a moment
[1:25:06] and we're
[1:25:07] certainly extending this invitation to
[1:25:10] you to come to the embassy hotel
[1:25:12] tomorrow afternoon
[1:25:14] to be prayed for and not only that
[1:25:17] but to bring the ones that sinners and
[1:25:20] those who are backslidden if we just
[1:25:23] have
[1:25:24] a prayer for the sick and we do see god
[1:25:27] constantly doing great miracles but that
[1:25:30] secondarily
[1:25:31] the main thing is to be saved
[1:25:34] filled with god's spirit which i'm going
[1:25:36] to speak to you about just in a few
[1:25:38] moments here
[1:25:39] and
[1:25:40] the sufficiency how that we must be
[1:25:43] filled with god's spirit
[1:25:45] and divine healing usually draws an
[1:25:47] attention to people
[1:25:49] and brings them in the presence of god
[1:25:51] when god does something
[1:25:52] that they know is un
[1:25:56] well it's
[1:25:57] not understood we cannot mechanically
[1:26:00] show how it's done god does it in his
[1:26:03] own great way
[1:26:05] then that attracts the attention of the
[1:26:07] people to know that there's a presence
[1:26:09] of a power somewhere that can do
[1:26:11] something as beyond human understanding
[1:26:14] and that causes them to look
[1:26:17] to the lamb of god
[1:26:19] and always divine healing
[1:26:21] i've been told and i believe myself that
[1:26:24] about between 60 maybe and 70 percent of
[1:26:27] our lord's ministry was on divine
[1:26:30] healing
[1:26:31] and he did that to attract the people
[1:26:34] then when they were there he said accept
[1:26:37] you believe i am he you will perish in
[1:26:39] your sins
[1:26:41] now
[1:26:42] divine healing is a great drawing card
[1:26:44] to get people to look to the lord jesus
[1:26:48] and dr f f bosworth which many of you
[1:26:51] was a friend to and knew him
[1:26:54] and his
[1:27:01] start at paragraph
[1:27:03] 42
[1:27:05] if we could just jump to 42 through 77
[1:27:09] this is the second session and it's only
[1:27:12] about five minutes long but we'll just
[1:27:14] we want to go to paragraph 42.
[1:27:18] and start there and this is brother
[1:27:20] branham ends the second radio broadcast
[1:27:23] and now he's starting the third
[1:27:25] session
[1:27:28] well this is three times for me up here
[1:27:34] you know
[1:27:35] it was just told that we got the vacate
[1:27:38] the building in about 12-14 minutes or
[1:27:40] something
[1:27:40] and
[1:27:41] the management said is on the other
[1:27:43] floor then they can't serve any meals
[1:27:48] our meals lengthened out we have many
[1:27:51] courses you know
[1:27:53] so we're very
[1:27:54] very glad that we've had this great
[1:27:58] spiritual gastronomical jubilee you know
[1:28:00] i would call it this morning here with
[1:28:02] this fine bunch of man i'd like to
[1:28:05] to make mention that we are
[1:28:07] the services again tomorrow afternoon
[1:28:10] over at the embassy now we will be
[1:28:12] praying for the sick there and expecting
[1:28:14] god to meet with us and
[1:28:17] i've come to put in my part my ministry
[1:28:19] into making all that we can this meeting
[1:28:22] to be a success
[1:28:24] not a success because it's our meeting a
[1:28:26] success of people finding jesus christ
[1:28:30] that's the success any meetings no
[1:28:32] matter how much we praise god how many
[1:28:34] great things that we see him do how many
[1:28:37] times he speaks to us in the spirit and
[1:28:40] so forth unless
[1:28:41] there's something accomplished
[1:28:43] some souls brought into the kingdom
[1:28:46] and uh brother shakira and i we just
[1:28:48] made a
[1:28:49] real statement just now about what he
[1:28:51] thought about these days that we're
[1:28:53] we're living in i truly believe that
[1:28:55] with all my heart that we're living just
[1:28:57] at the closing time just in a
[1:29:01] just in the evening shadows the sun is
[1:29:05] far advanced
[1:29:07] and when we see things taking place the
[1:29:09] way they are today
[1:29:11] why it's hard telling what another
[1:29:13] generation would bring
[1:29:15] a few days ago just let me give you a
[1:29:17] little insight something
[1:29:19] they made an analysis throughout arizona
[1:29:22] where i live of all the schools that
[1:29:24] gave the children unknowingly to them
[1:29:26] a mental test
[1:29:28] and guess what including high schools
[1:29:31] and
[1:29:31] and grammar school there was 80 percent
[1:29:35] of the children suffering with mental
[1:29:36] deficiency
[1:29:39] seventy percent of them was television
[1:29:41] watchers
[1:29:43] the evils just slipped up on us and we
[1:29:45] don't
[1:29:46] you wonder why it comes you can hear the
[1:29:48] voice of god screaming out against it
[1:29:49] yet here we we find ourselves webbed
[1:29:52] into it
[1:29:53] let me give you a
[1:29:55] shocking something
[1:29:57] see not all this sayeth unto me lord
[1:29:59] lord
[1:30:00] will enter in but the one that doeth the
[1:30:02] will of my father
[1:30:04] his will is his word
[1:30:06] we can be ever so religious
[1:30:09] have great time shouting jumping in
[1:30:12] these meetings which we're
[1:30:14] i don't
[1:30:15] i don't want to be critical
[1:30:17] but i have a
[1:30:18] duty to do to god
[1:30:20] and that duty is to be sincere
[1:30:23] and to say what he wants me to say
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:27] and i'm i'm certainly grateful for the
[1:30:28] california chapter who's bore with me
[1:30:31] and my convictions if i don't speak my
[1:30:34] convictions i'm a hypocrite i'm not i'm
[1:30:36] not even honest with you and if i can't
[1:30:39] be honest with you how will be honest
[1:30:40] with god
[1:30:41] because i'll see you and talk to you of
[1:30:43] course we do to god too but we got to be
[1:30:45] really sincere and honest with one
[1:30:47] another we are
[1:30:49] certainly in a
[1:30:51] a
[1:30:52] horrible horrible age
[1:30:54] and
[1:30:55] did you ever stop just let me give you
[1:30:57] just a little analysis
[1:30:59] not all that saith unto me lord lord
[1:31:01] will enter therein but the one that
[1:31:03] doeth the will of my father
[1:31:05] jesus said on earth man shall not live
[1:31:07] by bread alone but by every word
[1:31:11] every word not just
[1:31:12] now and then a word
[1:31:14] but by every word
[1:31:16] it was one word
[1:31:18] misbelief by gods of god's commandments
[1:31:21] that caused death sorrow and ever
[1:31:22] sickness and heartache
[1:31:24] to miss god's word one word
[1:31:26] if he taken the human race into death
[1:31:29] by this misbelieving one word surely
[1:31:33] surely but he said it would happen
[1:31:35] satan said surely it won't but it did so
[1:31:38] we've got to keep every word of god and
[1:31:41] if the human and all this suffering and
[1:31:42] things that went on the human race by
[1:31:45] misconstruing or
[1:31:47] are misbelieving one word how we going
[1:31:49] back by missing one if it's cost all
[1:31:52] this price even the life of his son
[1:31:56] many are called fear chosen
[1:31:59] many are called few are chosen
[1:32:03] i can't take a text from this but
[1:32:05] because we haven't got time but just to
[1:32:06] leave something with you
[1:32:10] let us think of i went one day with
[1:32:12] brother chicarion you know where this
[1:32:14] high breeding cattle
[1:32:17] and i've seen the
[1:32:19] the in the laboratory where brother
[1:32:20] shakarian taken me in and they a dipped
[1:32:23] uh in the spirit of the male cow uh just
[1:32:28] a little like a little instrument of
[1:32:30] matched stem
[1:32:32] and tuck up a bunch of that spearing and
[1:32:35] put it under this glass that magnified
[1:32:37] it hundreds of times
[1:32:40] and there was
[1:32:41] little germs jumping in that and that
[1:32:43] sperm which we know the germ comes from
[1:32:46] the male and the egg from the female
[1:32:49] and i asked the chemist there i said
[1:32:51] what's that making that little jump like
[1:32:53] he said that's uh that's little bulls
[1:32:55] and calves
[1:32:57] see i said in that little drop he said
[1:33:00] yes
[1:33:02] i said perhaps then in the entire sperm
[1:33:04] there would be a million of them he said
[1:33:07] oh yeah
[1:33:08] now watch close
[1:33:10] now
[1:33:11] when
[1:33:12] this
[1:33:14] great thing takes place
[1:33:16] there's one egg waiting for one germ out
[1:33:19] of that million
[1:33:22] and there's no one can tell which germ
[1:33:24] that is or which egg that is
[1:33:27] if you watch the natural birth it's more
[1:33:28] of a mystery than the
[1:33:30] than the
[1:33:31] virgin birth
[1:33:33] because in the sperm there's one in
[1:33:36] there that's predestinated
[1:33:39] to live
[1:33:41] and the rest of them will die
[1:33:44] and it isn't the first one meat it's the
[1:33:46] first one that comes together
[1:33:47] with the egg
[1:33:49] maybe the egg may raise up from the back
[1:33:51] of the sperm in the middle of the sperm
[1:33:52] the germ may do the same they the germ
[1:33:55] crawls into the egg and little tails
[1:33:57] drop off of it and there starts the
[1:33:59] spine
[1:34:00] there's only one
[1:34:02] and that whole load of a million that's
[1:34:05] going to make it
[1:34:07] only one
[1:34:09] and that's determined by some unknown
[1:34:11] force to man
[1:34:14] that you're everyone alike
[1:34:16] every one of those germs are just a
[1:34:18] light
[1:34:19] same thing in an animal same thing in
[1:34:21] man it's determined where it's going to
[1:34:22] be boy girl red-headed black-headed or
[1:34:24] white it's determined by god
[1:34:28] all of them look the same naturally
[1:34:30] but there's one in there that's ordained
[1:34:32] to life
[1:34:34] one in a million
[1:34:37] yet all of them alike
[1:34:41] when israel left egypt
[1:34:44] there was approximately two million
[1:34:46] people
[1:34:48] left at the same time
[1:34:50] every one of them heard the message of a
[1:34:52] prophet
[1:34:54] every one of them saw the pillar of fire
[1:34:57] every one of them was baptized to moses
[1:34:59] in the red sea
[1:35:02] every one of them shouted in the spirit
[1:35:05] beat the tamarins and run up and down
[1:35:07] the bank with maryam when moses sang in
[1:35:09] the spirit
[1:35:11] they everyone drank from the same
[1:35:13] spiritual rock
[1:35:15] they everyone eat fresh manna every
[1:35:17] night
[1:35:19] every one of them
[1:35:20] but there was two
[1:35:22] made the land
[1:35:25] one out of a million
[1:35:29] what was the test
[1:35:31] they all drinking the same rock they all
[1:35:33] eat the same spiritual manners were
[1:35:34] eating this morning
[1:35:37] but the word test proved him
[1:35:39] when it come to the time of cadiz barnea
[1:35:42] when they start over into the promised
[1:35:44] land
[1:35:45] and they could not go over until they
[1:35:46] was tested by the word
[1:35:49] and all the
[1:35:51] the other
[1:35:52] 10 came back and said we can't make it
[1:35:54] the people are like
[1:35:55] we're like grasshoppers to them they're
[1:35:57] great walls cities the opposition is too
[1:36:00] great but joshua and caleb's still the
[1:36:02] people
[1:36:03] they said we're more than able to do it
[1:36:07] why god said before they left the
[1:36:09] promised land i've given you the land
[1:36:11] i'll give it to you it's yours
[1:36:14] but there were
[1:36:16] one out of each million
[1:36:20] there's approximately 500 million
[1:36:22] so-called christians in the world today
[1:36:26] and each day ends a generation
[1:36:29] and now what if the rapture would come
[1:36:32] today
[1:36:34] and 500 people universally would be
[1:36:36] taken in the rapture
[1:36:38] you never know or even see in the paper
[1:36:40] of them going
[1:36:44] and the coming of the lord is a secret
[1:36:46] coming
[1:36:48] you'll come and steal away you'll be
[1:36:50] such a minority
[1:36:52] go just like it was in the days when the
[1:36:55] disciples asked jesus why does the
[1:36:57] scribe say that that elias must first
[1:36:59] come he said he's already come
[1:37:03] and you never knew
[1:37:04] it did you ever think what the people
[1:37:07] did they went right on believing that
[1:37:11] elias was coming
[1:37:13] and he was right among them
[1:37:15] and they didn't know it
[1:37:17] so would it be in the coming of the son
[1:37:19] of man he'll do with him just the same
[1:37:21] thing
[1:37:22] the spirit of god is here
[1:37:24] well what are we going to do with it are
[1:37:26] we going to eat manna and so forth and
[1:37:28] not continually move up as we grow
[1:37:32] did you ever notice a seed
[1:37:34] as
[1:37:35] the reverend pitts was speaking a few
[1:37:37] moments ago
[1:37:39] and how seed goes into the ground
[1:37:42] many seeds are there in the ground
[1:37:46] when god moved up on the water with the
[1:37:48] light
[1:37:49] and light brought forth
[1:37:51] the first
[1:37:52] uh
[1:37:54] presence of god
[1:37:57] spoken
[1:37:58] light came by god's word and god's word
[1:38:03] is the only thing it still brings light
[1:38:06] and when the waters went back the seed
[1:38:09] is already in the earth
[1:38:11] and the light only brought forth the
[1:38:13] seeds that remain with germ in them
[1:38:17] come forth god making his creation
[1:38:21] and now on easter morning there was
[1:38:23] another
[1:38:24] light struck the earth when the holy
[1:38:26] spirit was given
[1:38:28] and it's given
[1:38:29] to bring
[1:38:30] life
[1:38:31] to those seeds that god by his
[1:38:34] foreknowledge knew
[1:38:36] that would be here on the earth as he
[1:38:38] knew the first natural seed he knows
[1:38:39] where the spiritual season your body was
[1:38:41] laying here right down on the earth when
[1:38:43] god first brought the earth into
[1:38:45] existence we are part of the earth we
[1:38:47] were laying there and by his fore
[1:38:49] knowledge he knew exactly who would love
[1:38:52] him and who would serve him and who
[1:38:53] would not
[1:38:54] his foreknowledge tells that
[1:38:57] if it doesn't then he isn't god he can't
[1:38:58] be god without being infinite and if
[1:39:00] he's infinite he knows all things
[1:39:03] so you see people making their blunders
[1:39:05] they stumble at it they run at it they
[1:39:07] think this and that but it doesn't work
[1:39:09] right we see it but there is a working
[1:39:12] right
[1:39:14] that's to find god's perfect will and
[1:39:17] standing in
[1:39:18] what god calls you for
[1:39:20] as brother jack said a few moments ago
[1:39:23] about down here at the the persian
[1:39:26] square
[1:39:27] all the confusion
[1:39:30] one this away in one that way and about
[1:39:32] the theologians and so forth that you
[1:39:35] want to know some theology go down there
[1:39:38] i guess that's just about like it is in
[1:39:40] the hyde park in london
[1:39:42] i was down there everybody has his own
[1:39:44] idea it's a it's a conglomeration of
[1:39:49] of a modern-day
[1:39:50] world in babylon
[1:39:54] but did you notice as as brother pitts
[1:39:57] went on with his lovely message this
[1:39:59] morning to us
[1:40:01] as he began to walk out of the park
[1:40:06] there he found
[1:40:08] a little easter lily
[1:40:12] in the midst of all the confusion
[1:40:15] as he brought it to us that had no way
[1:40:18] to say yes or no
[1:40:21] it was a life of god shining in it in
[1:40:24] the midst of all the confusion
[1:40:27] it was there in its radiance because god
[1:40:29] had ordained it to be there
[1:40:32] in the midst of all the conflict no one
[1:40:34] was noticing it
[1:40:37] they didn't see the spiritual
[1:40:39] application of it
[1:40:41] and so easily today amongst all of our
[1:40:44] great gatherings and groups and churches
[1:40:46] and denominations and so forth
[1:40:49] one pulling this away we must be
[1:40:50] baptized be presbyterian we must be this
[1:40:52] side of the other
[1:40:54] in the midst of all of it there is a
[1:40:56] growing flower
[1:40:58] there is a power of god right among us
[1:41:01] being raised right up in the midst of
[1:41:03] all of us
[1:41:05] let's just stop and behold it a few
[1:41:06] minutes
[1:41:08] and watch it this week and see it unfold
[1:41:10] right before us
[1:41:12] we believe god will do it don't you
[1:41:15] i see it we ought to be downstairs but
[1:41:17] now so let's pray each one of us
[1:41:24] dear god
[1:41:27] when we bow our heads
[1:41:29] in thy presence we are
[1:41:33] feel that we are so insufficient
[1:41:37] to ask
[1:41:39] but you promised us that if we would
[1:41:42] come you would not turn us down
[1:41:46] and these rude
[1:41:49] statements that's just been made
[1:41:52] by no means to be a doctrine
[1:41:55] one out of a million
[1:41:57] but just
[1:41:58] to kindly remember
[1:42:01] or you said straight is the gate
[1:42:04] and narrow is the way that leadeth unto
[1:42:07] life and few there will be that'll find
[1:42:10] it
[1:42:12] or many are called
[1:42:16] but few are chosen
[1:42:19] o eternal father
[1:42:22] send the gospel light across this city
[1:42:27] through this coming week of convention
[1:42:29] and if there be any seed
[1:42:32] somehow by your own great wise province
[1:42:36] like trying to illustrate it in the
[1:42:39] spurn of the male and female may they
[1:42:41] roll into the convention
[1:42:45] may the holy spirit give them life
[1:42:49] we realize that
[1:42:51] the time is perhaps later than we think
[1:42:54] it is
[1:42:56] we pray god that as we come here just
[1:43:00] believing that
[1:43:01] maybe there is something here that could
[1:43:03] be done that would help the people or or
[1:43:06] catch that last sheep
[1:43:10] we know when the sheep
[1:43:12] fold is full then
[1:43:14] the shepherd will close the door
[1:43:18] as it was like in the days of noah
[1:43:21] when the last member of the family was
[1:43:24] brought in god closed the door
[1:43:28] and they beat and pounded but
[1:43:31] it was too late
[1:43:34] dear god they had the
[1:43:36] opportunity you said i am that door to
[1:43:40] the sheepfold
[1:43:42] and how striking the song
[1:43:45] from the poet
[1:43:46] are not ninety and nine enough for thee
[1:43:51] but no
[1:43:53] there was one more
[1:43:56] he might be a little black sheep or he
[1:43:59] might be a little nobody
[1:44:02] might be the little
[1:44:03] her he
[1:44:06] we don't know where they are but that
[1:44:07] last one must come in
[1:44:11] and then the door will be closed
[1:44:15] oh
[1:44:16] god who knows all things
[1:44:20] search our lives this morning and send
[1:44:23] us
[1:44:24] wherever that we could go that we might
[1:44:27] find that last one that the door will be
[1:44:29] closed and the shepherd inside with the
[1:44:32] sheep
[1:44:35] granted lord if there
[1:44:37] be that one here today
[1:44:41] if that one that's supposed to come in
[1:44:43] all the father has given me will come to
[1:44:46] me
[1:44:48] and no man can come except my father has
[1:44:51] drawed him
[1:44:52] and if there be a tug or a little
[1:44:55] feeling
[1:44:56] that this might be the hour for somebody
[1:45:00] here in this audience here are
[1:45:01] downstairs or wherever they may be may
[1:45:04] they answer yes lord
[1:45:09] i am that little wandering one that's
[1:45:12] wandered away
[1:45:14] it's fallen off all my life i i felt
[1:45:17] that i should come but today i'm hanging
[1:45:21] on the side of the feet
[1:45:23] i can't go up or down i can go no way
[1:45:27] oh may the great shepherd come reach
[1:45:30] down with him their hands and bring that
[1:45:32] one safely in
[1:45:34] place it up on his shoulders and bring
[1:45:36] it safely back
[1:45:40] maybe there is one here laura that's
[1:45:42] sick
[1:45:43] in a similar condition that the doctor
[1:45:45] said there's nothing can be done
[1:45:49] he tried hard to rescue it but
[1:45:53] he could not rescue it
[1:45:55] it's beyond his reach there's there's
[1:45:57] nothing that he can do his medicine or
[1:46:00] his knife cannot get to it
[1:46:03] oh lord
[1:46:05] there's nothing too far for your great
[1:46:07] arm
[1:46:11] and your word is your arm
[1:46:14] so we pray dear god that this morning
[1:46:17] while we are talking to thee that thou
[1:46:19] will reach down and pick that one up
[1:46:21] that's sick it cannot help itself out of
[1:46:24] the reach of all scientific
[1:46:26] uh matters
[1:46:28] away from the doctor
[1:46:30] may they be healed
[1:46:34] granted lord
[1:46:36] as we think of david as he
[1:46:39] was given a charge over a few sheep
[1:46:42] just a few
[1:46:44] but
[1:46:46] one day a bear come in and
[1:46:48] got that one little sheep and tuck it
[1:46:51] out
[1:46:52] and would have eaten up
[1:46:56] like a cancer would eat up a body
[1:46:59] our
[1:47:00] huge line
[1:47:03] but david not too well equipped
[1:47:07] with a a rifler and not a swordsman but
[1:47:11] with only a slingshot he went after that
[1:47:14] sheep
[1:47:17] and when he found
[1:47:19] the animal that was about to kill the
[1:47:21] little sheep he slewt with the slingshot
[1:47:26] just a simple little
[1:47:28] weapon with a piece of leather and a
[1:47:30] string and
[1:47:31] but he had confidence in it
[1:47:35] we have no great
[1:47:37] genius among us lord
[1:47:39] we're simple people
[1:47:42] with a simple little prayer
[1:47:45] but we're coming this morning after
[1:47:47] father's sheep
[1:47:52] that
[1:47:52] woman
[1:47:55] that has walked the streets miserably
[1:47:57] smoking cigarettes
[1:47:59] trying to find peace
[1:48:02] through this cigarette that man who has
[1:48:05] smelt the glass
[1:48:08] and tried to set it back
[1:48:10] but the enemy
[1:48:12] holds him tight
[1:48:14] that boy or girl that's tried to do
[1:48:17] right i just can't find strength to
[1:48:20] break away from the wrong thing
[1:48:23] we come in the name of the lord jesus
[1:48:26] to claim that sheep this morning
[1:48:29] we defy the enemy
[1:48:31] because it's a simple thing a slingshot
[1:48:33] of prayer but we're coming to bring that
[1:48:36] one back to the father's home
[1:48:40] that we might give an account of those
[1:48:42] things that's been committed to our
[1:48:44] hands may the power of god now strike
[1:48:48] faith down in the hearts of the people
[1:48:51] and may that lost soul return this
[1:48:53] morning may the temptations of this life
[1:48:55] turn him away
[1:48:57] let him go
[1:49:00] may he find himself
[1:49:02] safely upon the master's shoulders being
[1:49:05] carried back to safety again
[1:49:08] we asked it in jesus name
[1:49:10] amen
[1:49:20] now just from that this morning i hope
[1:49:22] that
[1:49:23] you were able to listen and understand
[1:49:27] that all that he's talking about the
[1:49:28] responsibility those souls that's us
[1:49:33] that's what we're taking up that's what
[1:49:35] our calling is
[1:49:37] that's what our election is that we
[1:49:39] understand it
[1:49:41] rejoice in it
[1:49:43] and
[1:49:44] we're blessed in it
[1:49:46] and
[1:49:47] don't
[1:49:49] don't count
[1:49:51] for slack
[1:49:52] what god's done for us and the duty that
[1:49:56] lies ahead of us
[1:49:57] so we'll just stop there this morning i
[1:50:00] i probably most of you know me
[1:50:02] well for some reason i'm not feeling
[1:50:04] very well this morning i don't know what
[1:50:06] happened i just got here at church and
[1:50:09] i gotta just lost a lot of strength but
[1:50:13] i know it's somewhere
[1:50:15] like the hairs on my head
[1:50:17] you know what i mean and i hadn't lost
[1:50:19] it i just wasn't able to find it
[1:50:22] but
[1:50:24] the fact that you're chosen is so
[1:50:25] beautiful
[1:50:27] don't don't think it and the world don't
[1:50:29] even comprehend
[1:50:31] what you are
[1:50:33] but you shine your light
[1:50:35] amongst men
[1:50:36] so i believe at this time that our
[1:50:39] sister
[1:50:40] uh is going to be baptized and uh
[1:50:43] brother joseph uh gordon and brother uh
[1:50:48] cosmine are gonna baptize her this
[1:50:50] morning so if you would go get ready and
[1:50:53] it cost me if you could get a sister to
[1:50:56] help
[1:50:57] the sister be baptized we're grateful
[1:50:59] for that
[1:51:00] and
[1:51:01] some of you may have to go you might
[1:51:03] have dinner to prepare or something so
[1:51:06] we'll stand together at this time
[1:51:08] and
[1:51:12] you're
[1:51:14] if you if you do have to go don't don't
[1:51:17] feel bad
[1:51:19] we understand that so if you'd like to
[1:51:22] just slip out at this time and
[1:51:24] and then we'll say a word of prayer and
[1:51:26] then
[1:51:27] those of you that want to stay for the
[1:51:30] baptism that would be wonderful so if
[1:51:32] you have a need on your heart this
[1:51:34] morning
[1:51:36] and you'd like to lift it to the lord
[1:51:40] he said the word is the arm of god
[1:51:44] and the exceedingly great and precious
[1:51:46] promises are how that we know him
[1:51:50] and we partake in his divine nature
[1:51:54] one of the benefits of election is the
[1:51:57] promises
[1:51:59] the price we pay is the reproach
[1:52:02] and rejection of the world
[1:52:10] one of the blessings of election is a
[1:52:12] blessed assurance
[1:52:17] that all things work
[1:52:19] for the good
[1:52:22] and that heaven and earth may pass away
[1:52:25] and will pass away
[1:52:27] but his promise will never
[1:52:32] the price we pay is we don't succeed in
[1:52:35] the world
[1:52:37] as others succeed
[1:52:41] the price we pay is that he's come to
[1:52:43] the poor of this world
[1:52:47] but they're rich in faith
[1:52:51] the price we pay is we don't have
[1:52:54] fellowship with the world
[1:52:56] or the thinks of the world
[1:53:01] we're oddballs
[1:53:04] they view us as self-righteous and
[1:53:08] stuck up and
[1:53:10] know it all
[1:53:13] we don't know at all but we know the one
[1:53:15] that does know it all
[1:53:20] and we believe what he says is true
[1:53:29] i'd gladly bear the reproach
[1:53:32] of my election
[1:53:35] for it hasn't even entered into the
[1:53:37] hearts of men the things that god has
[1:53:40] prepared for them that love them
[1:53:43] we look through a glass darkling
[1:53:46] that's part of the reproach
[1:53:50] but one day we'll come face to face
[1:53:53] father our sister has heard the gospel
[1:53:56] today
[1:54:01] they've gone out to the different places
[1:54:04] and she's heard that
[1:54:08] baptism is in the name of the lord jesus
[1:54:10] christ
[1:54:15] and that word father pricked your heart
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:19] she knows you're real and she's come to
[1:54:21] be baptized that
[1:54:24] she can partake in the things of life
[1:54:29] you said the holy spirit was sent to
[1:54:31] find that seed
[1:54:34] and bring it to life
[1:54:36] father i pray this morning in her
[1:54:38] baptism that all that
[1:54:42] you would have for her
[1:54:45] begins to unfold in her life
[1:54:48] father may she know her sins are
[1:54:50] forgiven
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:53] and lord if she's
[1:54:55] wanting to leave one
[1:54:58] life may you give her a life to replace
[1:55:01] it
[1:55:03] i just ask that you be mighty in her
[1:55:05] life
[1:55:07] father those that have come out to the
[1:55:09] house of the lord today
[1:55:12] father we just listened to what might
[1:55:14] not be considered a great sermon maybe
[1:55:17] this morning
[1:55:19] but that's not what we put our
[1:55:21] confidence in
[1:55:24] lord i put my confidence this morning
[1:55:26] that you deal with each heart
[1:55:30] and i trust father that you go way
[1:55:32] beyond this vessel of flesh
[1:55:36] and that
[1:55:37] something that was said this morning
[1:55:39] will
[1:55:41] have an eternal effect
[1:55:44] bless those that have to go father
[1:55:46] prepare meals do whatever that they have
[1:55:48] to do
[1:55:50] may you go with them father
[1:55:53] and may your word be their portion
[1:55:56] father i ask these things
[1:55:59] as a pastor father for his sheep
[1:56:04] and i know that's an office that you
[1:56:06] created that we could be intercessors
[1:56:10] and father so i pray that though
[1:56:13] the sermon this morning
[1:56:19] was maybe not of great enticing words
[1:56:23] but may the life and benefit and
[1:56:26] intercession for the people
[1:56:29] may it be a portion that they realize in
[1:56:31] their heart
[1:56:33] i ask you to bless us now
[1:56:35] in jesus precious name we pray
[1:56:38] amen as brother billy sings
[1:56:40] i don't feel bad if you have to go but
[1:56:42] if you can stay we certainly love the
[1:56:44] fellowship
[1:56:45] god bless you are dismissed if you need
[1:56:47] to go
