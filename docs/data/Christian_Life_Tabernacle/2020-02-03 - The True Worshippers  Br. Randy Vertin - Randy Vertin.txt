evening we'll just get right into the word how many happy to be in the house of the lord this evening amen let's turn to john chapter four i've just so appreciated the service always appreciate the services and the word when it comes forth but i've just so really appreciated the what the lord's put on brother david's heart and just backed up with the different brothers and different things and just seeing where we're going and how the lord's calling us to a higher place to really step out by faith and seeing those works expressing our faith and by his grace we just want to put our shoulder to the wheel kind of in that direction as well this evening john chapter 4 everybody can hear me okay but john chapter 4 and we'll start in verse 21 we know this the story of the woman at the well jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvations of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen how many believe that our now is where the true worshipers are going to worship the lord in spirit and in truth amen let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father as we just humbly come before your throne of grace this evening oh god it's come my lot again to to just be a vessel to to preach your word this evening but lord we haven't come to hear from a man or a man's ideas but oh god you've just given a five-fold ministry within your body oh god just to bring forth your thoughts lord your expectations your desires to the people o lord and we've come an earnest expectation lord to hear from you this evening may you just move me out of the way lord may your holy ghost have complete preeminence in the service may you speak to the hearts of your children oh god we've come lord seeking lord bread from the from the master's table oh god we've come to to be fed lord jesus to receive strength and to receive courage in the hour lord that you've brought forth lord a word in this age to bring us to perfection oh god to bring us to a rapture lord and lord we just come here lord to hear from you we asked lord that any any spirit lord that would try to hinder we bind in the name of jesus and we place it under our feet oh god lord you told us that we wherever we the souls of our food would tread oh god that would be that footstep would be a possession lord and we're stepping right now into the word oh god to hear from you and to take hold of the things that you promised this father we just ask that your perfect will and way would be done this evening lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated by the grace of the lord you know where you just pray for me thoughts have just kind of been you know how the devil just likes to attack the you know during the day here today my wife was walking the dog and then the dog broke one of her claws off almost and so she was bleeding everywhere and one weren't sure what to do so we had to take her lindsay took the dog to the vet and by the grace of the lord everything's okay but you know just lots of little things you know how the devil fights and and how he does things but we're gonna we're pressing forward anyhow and i guess just if i had to give a title to the sermon tonight i just want to speak about the true worshipers you know i i was just i really been kind of dwelling on that word and the the word worship and you know i feel like so many times you know in our minds we put our own definitions to what the word worship means you know i think we we oftentimes we limit that that idea of worship to we come and sing songs into the lord we've come into the house of worship to worship the lord this evening and we're singing songs to worship god and the lord just really impressed it upon my heart in light of the things that have been being ministered lately how worship is so much more than just an expression of our mouth worship is so much more than just something that we just speak or that we say we come and we sing a song oh that's you know we call it praise and worship and and no doubt that that is true to a certain extent but true worship as we hear in the in john true worship the worshiping in spirit and in truth it it goes so much deeper than than just oh we'll sing a song into the lord oh we're gonna we're gonna come and bring our tithes and our offerings as a form of worship it goes so far beyond just a a a framework of a church in the sense of a building or a framework of a of a congregational assembly but a worship is is an everyday experience with god true worship worshiping in spirit and in truth is a is a sacrifice that goes beyond just uh just a sacrifice of praise from thanksgiving of your mouth although that's part of it it goes beyond the the idea of just maybe a testimony here a testimony there but but a real worship you know when we look at the old testament and we think about how god established the tabernacle in the wilderness as a place he said i would i would i would bring a place and out there i would put my name and there you would worship me and and to that day to the children of israel the tabernacle in the wilderness god had established a place for the children of god the children of israel to bring their sacrifices into to to do worship to show their desire to express their love for god to express their their desire to great jehovah to say lord this is this and we want to show you lord that we desire to serve you that we desire to give something unto you in there they brought their their sacrifices their turtle doves and and their wave offerings and their burnt offerings and their drink offerings and all the different ones you could go through the book in in exodus in leviticus deuteronomy and see all the sacrifices that they would give as a form of worship and yet all those things were merely just types just just shadows and types of what god was truly desiring and we find that no matter what all of their offerings all of their sacrifices i believe that's our brother moses began to minister and how he talked about how those things what do they become unto god they became a stench in his nostrils because he wasn't just desiring an outward work in so much it's longer to bring the sacrifice oh every year we're going to bring this block and we're going to offer it up on the altar every year we're going to go and we're going to do this for the atonement no but he was desiring something deeper from his people he was desiring that true sincere worship as we're talking about here in the book of john it he seeketh those to worship him the father seeketh such to worship him and now i want to bring it maybe to to right now because i believe he's found such to worship him you how many are that one that he's found he sought you out to worship him in spirit and in truth he says the father seeketh such he's constantly seeking and he's found such this evening he's found a pride he's found the ones that he's called and brought unto himself you this evening i believe in the house of god us being here to worship him in spirit and in truth but it goes beyond just coming to church and presenting yourself in a pew and say well i've i've sacrificed my three to five hours a week of going to a few church services it goes it's going the lord is calling us to go beyond i believe i just felt such a cry from the the ministry and what the lord's bringing forth here that it's going beyond just coming underneath the umbrella of a message and it's time to bring it from underneath where we're at now to expressing a worship outside of these walls every day becomes a worship unto the lord jesus he's seeking those to worship him he's found those that would worship in spirit and in truth we've received a truth in this hour we've received a message a key as it were to unlock the truth that was in god's word the whole time we've received the holy ghost a holy spirit that can say amen to every word that was revealed in this hour but now he's calling for worship now he's calling for a true worship he's calling for something just a little bit greater thank you brother he's calling for an everyday worship see it used to be that they would come once a year into the holy holies to bring forth a sacrifice to bring forth an atonement that was their worship they were limited in what they could perform why because the shadows and types expressing the lord's showing through a law and we understand how how the shadow of the law proving to man that without a perfect sacrifice they couldn't even approach unto god only once a year could they do it but in this days through the lord jesus he's given us an opportunity and i say beyond an opportunity if we claim to be and we are the bride of christ it's beyond an opportunity but it's an obligation to come into the presence of god not just once many of us have experienced the holy ghost to fill you to bring you into a revelation to bring you to the recognition of jesus christ in you but it's got to go beyond just a one-time thing it's it comes to an every day i'm talking about an everyday walking why because if we're our goal is a rapture we've been given this goal this promise and we see very little in the way of direct connections but you know to the natural mind i could say but one thing i know about enoch who took a rapture is it says he walked with god and what was that walking with god that is a worship a true worship in spirit and in truth every day and it's not just relying you say oh brother we can't do it ourselves that's the point that's the point brothers and sisters we've been hearing from this pulpit over the last month and a half since this new year has started like it's just a month now i'm bringing that faith and trying to really step out into the word of god you know i i was thinking about it this afternoon and i thought you know the devil we talk oh we're moving past pentecost oh that's true as far as that pentecost is concerned the 1906 pentecost or whatever year it was we've moved past that why because they moved into fanaticism we're moving into the word but we but the devil has put up so many scarecrows when it comes to the power of god he's put up so many scarecrows of fanaticism and and just running after any little thing but the thing about the bride is she doesn't run after every little thing she stays right with this word but it almost seems as though the devil with all the scarecrows has caused us just to buckle it up and hold it to ourselves the power of god hasn't changed but i wonder if our faith in that power of god has just waned just enough by all the scarecrows out there we've seen all the false everywhere you look is a false one oh i got this oh i got that and you could see just even through the by the revelation he's given us you can listen to a preacher and you could see within just a couple minutes whether or not they truly believe the word of god because you'll see it in the way they approach the word is it just their opinion on it or is this everything to them is this the only thing to them but see the problem is all the ones that had little pieces here and a piece there they ran off in all the different directions and and and so many times we just sit there and oh i don't want to venture out because i don't want to look like a fanatic i don't want to look like i'm going to be a little too overboard with it you know you want to know something the lord really been pressing on my heart is humility the idea of humility i was looking up that word in humility it says humility is a person not thinking basic i'm paraphrasing in the way the dictionary says it but humility is not thinking much of oneself i think too many times we think too much of ourselves and the right the way i the reason i say that is you know we all desire humility amen he's called us to humility meek and lowly but you know the lord really told me i just the lord spoke to me said how do you get humility humiliation brings humility you know you know you know one of the reasons why we're not willing to step out in faith because we're not willing to be humiliated for the word of god you know who once humiliated jesus christ when they stripped him naked beat him to a bloody pulp all of his bones stared at him and put him up at a cross all that shame that he had to bear for you all that shame he bore for me you know the scripture didn't say he liked it the scripture said he despised the shame and so many times we're not willing to go where he went even in a little thing to step out of the ledge and say lord i don't care if it looks like a shame i'm taking you at your word god just like brother matthew said i pray for a thousand people if they didn't get healed that's not my business god backs up his word amen i can't do it anyway what did brother branham say when he'd be on the platform all the time he said brother if i could do something for you i'd be a hypocrite if i didn't but i can't so i'll do the one thing i can do and we'll go to him who can do something about it [Applause] what was it he wasn't leaning on his own strength he only leaned upon the truth you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's not an if and or maybe it will come to pass what see but so like i love the way brother matthew put it we're not willing to sometimes jump out there you know we've got the answer to the question it's the question that nobody wants to verbalize in this age because they're all looking to fill that with something else they'll fill that hole with anything else but with god anything else but the word anything else but the lord jesus they won't ask the question where can i go to be saved they're asking it but maybe not verbally but we've got the answer you have the answer it's up to god to back up the answer it's not up to you it's not up to me i can only step in this word where he tells me to go he'd say well what if i don't what if i pray for me they don't get healed well that's not the question the question is if it doesn't happen the way they think are you willing to be humiliated for the gospel see we put humiliation oh it means something bad happened no it doesn't mean something bad happened jesus christ was humiliated on the cross the greatest thing that ever happened said blessed are you when you suffer reproach for my sake say well lord i i what if i pray for him and it doesn't happen it's not about that god's calling for courage in this hour he's calling for us to set aside the cowardly ways and finally take god and say lord you know what i have no idea how this is going to work the only thing i know is that you said it the only thing i know is that you promised it to happen you promised that if i laid hands on the sick they would recover you promised that whatsoever i ask in your name if i believe i shall receive amen and the devil's going to be there with every excuse that's fine because i'm not relying upon myself we have to go back to the childlike faith that childlike faith when when when you were a little child and your mother or father said something you just didn't question it because that that's all you knew when you were that little when you were that little and that and that mom that mama said it's going to be okay well you didn't worry about it mama knew better why because she compared to you as a little child she was god in that sense she knew everything that you didn't know she knew what was coming down the line so she could comfort you and say don't worry it's going to be okay and that little child with that child like faith could rest in those words why because mama knows how much more our heavenly father [Music] whose ways are above our ways whose thoughts are above our thoughts who said all my thoughts i have towards you are good when he tells you just take me at my word could we be like the little child and just say yes papa yes but i'll rest in that oh you have the answer to the question when someone needs deliverance you've got the answer to the question because jesus christ breaks every chain he's a deliverer he's the mighty conqueror all you got to do is be willing to step out on it you know the scripture let's turn let's turn to matthew 7. i'm talking about true worship the lord seeking true worshipers matthew chapter 7 start at verse 21. here's the difference between a true and false worshiper not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many was saying to me will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will well i profess unto them i never knew you'd depart from me ye that work iniquity so there's some of the scarecrows the devil's putting up haven't we done he never said that they didn't do those things but just like he had to tell the pharisees he said you did the one but you left the other undone oh yeah you had enough faith to have your big pentecostal conventions and run around and dance and scream and shout and maybe you saw a little something happen here and there but then when it came to matthew 28 19 acts 2 38 you said oh i just can't believe it that way but then when it came to the serpent scene you say oh that just sounds crazy even though it's genesis to revelation it's right in the word oh you said god can still send prophets in this day i just don't believe it unless it's our brother prophet over here that we believe but so what was it they left they took one and they left the other they could give spirit but no truth we have truth in the spirit i believe that but it does no good unless it's activated and god's wanting you to do it he had didn't he have to tell the prophet that how the prophet relied on vision so much and the lord had to tell him so you need to go out on faith i give you vision so much that you just don't even have you barely even have the faith that you should have in the things that are just in the word because you always want me to show it to you so are we lord show me a sign lord show me this he says i did you got the last sign you got a prophet in this day and what did the prophet point to what did the sign point to it pointed back to the word that's the formula that's where the true worshiper goes now listen in verse 24 matthew 7 therefore whosoever hear these sayings of mine and do with them i just the way the lord i was reading this the other day and i just the lord helped me see it just in a new you know you read a scripture and then the lord helps you see it in a new light now i want you to listen what he's saying here whoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock so i want you to think about it what is he equating here he says if you hear these sayings and do them what is that you're building your house on a rock so we know what the rock is it's his word it's a revelation of who he is it's his word so what is it how are you building a house on that rock by just doing what he said that's as simple as it is we make it so complicated we make it so complicated to fulfill the will of god but the will of god is his word and that's why i'm so appreciated the direction that brother david's been going because it's just as simple as if i see it in the scripture i can walk in that where else do you have to turn that's where the true worshipers go and then and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it is founded upon a rock and everyone that heared these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand so what is it he's heard it but there's no doing so there's no rock now i want you to notice no matter which man this was what's the same the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and they beat upon that house so you no matter which way you go the rains are coming the floods are coming the rains and winds and everything are going to beat upon the house the only difference is gonna be where are you building the house are we just are we just coming up with our own ideas are we just hiding our light under a bushel no because that's not the word that's not what he said to do he said no man light of the candle and put it under a bushel but he put it that said it's on high so it can be seen by all so let your light shine so what is he calling us to simply fulfill his word let your light shine that's where the worship is is it fulfilling his word for you now you know when it comes to the exact calling you have what job it may be and those that's between you and the lord the lord will put you where you need but these things are just basic principles and if we would just see the lord says if you'll be faithful and little you'll be faithful in much so if we want to achieve the greater things we want to see the greater works we want to see a greater walk with him then all we can do is fulfill the little things he's called us to that's the true worship why because a worship requires a sacrifice worship requires a laying down of something before the altar that's why he could say in the book of romans he says give yourselves a living sacrifice what did he call he said it's your reasonable service that's the requirement giving yourself as a living sacrifice and what is it it's a sacrifice of your desires it's a sacrifice of your will for the will of this word for the will of god that's in his word it's so simple but if we could take that and just continue to walk that's the works we're talking about it's not working your own ideas it's just doing what he said they said lord when did we ever see you hungry when did we see you thirsty or in prison or sick he said insomuch as you've done unto the least of these you've done it unto me what was that that's just fulfilling the word that's just show me your faith without words i'll show you my faith by my works if you say unto your brother who hath need be clothed and be be warmed and filled and you don't give him what he has need of if it's that way with that so is it for the rest if he's called us to go into all the world and preach the gospel what is that that's the worship you say oh i'm not a preacher you are a preacher you're a written epistle you're a living word that every action you take is a worship every time you praise the lord jesus and you tell someone about him that's a worship worship isn't just coming in here raising their hands and saying i'll praise you lord that's praise we're talking about worship we're talking about every time you go out the door you're on the altar you say lord consume me as a sacrifice let the fire fall on me and you know what happens when the fire falls on you anybody around that can catch on fire too they can't help it but catch on fire if they're made of the same stuff they can't help it but that's the worship true worship we've got the spirit we've got the truth the devil's tried to pull the wool on our eyes and say oh we don't have it no we've got it it's here the question is what are we doing with it god's powers never waned god's power doesn't falter but he wants a worship oh i got a quote for you right here uh when i read this i was like this is i like this this is from all things 1962. now i want you i want you to think about this just think while we're we're reading this here it's it's a little bit lengthy but i think you'll i think you'll be blessed isaiah spilled it out to them and said god said he's hiding his face from your prayers you've got your ritualistic form yet it's the truth you're doing what he told you but you're not doing it in sincerity and you squall out day and night but god said your sacrifice is a stink to me and i will not receive it anymore and when you pray under such conditions i'll hide my face from you now don't put yourself there because that's not the bride that's not you that's the devil speaking to you if you start putting yourself in that place because we're not here out of ritual we're here out of sincerity i was just driving here on the way on the way to church and there's like a little bar or something down the road and that place was so packed they had cars on the other side but you know what not so for the people of god not so for the bride she's come for the living water she's come for the new wine she's come for the stimulation by revelation he said oh god if people would think of that it would start a pentecost god said though you be correctly in the word but if you don't do it with love and sincerity god said he would hide his face and wouldn't hear your prayers see that's the way now don't put yourself there what because why because i believe the people of god here we've got sincerity you're here to serve god your desire is to serve him we've got the word we're not denying the truth so what's the only thing is putting it into action oh you said that your talk you're taking under the old testament brother branham all right let's take the new testament second timothy 3 the holy spirit warned us that in the last days that the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith they'd have a form of godliness but would deny the power that went with the right thing having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof yes sir god hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got christ in it is powerless but any religion that christ in is under his own blood and it's got power in it you say god hates a religion without power he said your solemn feasts is a stink i guess he does hate it he said it it makes me sick and remember he told this rich laodicean church that because you're lukewarm in other words you make me sick i'll spew you out i'll spare not you'd think he'd be accepted certainly not but he'd cry just the same silent feasts they're a stink god hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship that's what we're talking about everyday worship now this is what i like this i like this right here he says not forms but genuine power worship to know that you've passed from death unto life i love that one i love that little phrase he said genuine power worship when you get up every day and you say lord i'm going to worship you with my life i'm going to wake up today and and randall burton's going on the altar today he's gonna die and i'm gonna worship you how in spirit by putting yourself down and in truth lord i'm gonna walk according to this word to the best that i can when i see someone that needs help i'm going to reach out the hand not my head but the hand of christ because i've got what they need when someone's down i'm going to reach down not with my hand but the hand of faith that shall save the sick and god will raise them up not you raising them up god would raise them up a genuine power worship how many of you want that your life not just a little praise i want a power worship god wants to perform his word by his power oh i'm going to read that again god wants to perform his word by his people no by his power you are just the conduit that he desires to do it through it's like guys say this if you're expecting a package from fedex and they come and that package has got something that you really need they come and deliver the package it's it's not it's not the delivery driver that you that that you're that you're looking for you're looking for the package i need what's in the package i don't care who the driver is i need the package it's got it's got some life-saving medication that's what you are you're the delivery driver you're out there every day you're the fedex for the lord jesus carried packing eternal life and whether people know it or not you're gonna deliver a package to their doorstep that they have need of more than anything in the world and it's not up to you the driver they gotta open the package the package will do the rest it doesn't matter about the delivery he could be he could be crooked-backed could barely move can't barely speak half-blind doesn't matter it's the package that's the big thing so we're so busy looking at the driver we're basically looking at the delivery person look to the one who's delivering eternal life he wants to perform his word by his power not by your goodness not by your ability his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word how many times do we deny his power well we got a headache while i'll go take the tylenol let's take the power of god oh my my child's sick we're running right to the doctor no how about we pray first how about we go to the power of god oh no i'm not denying that doctors have their place we all know that i've taken when i had the coronavirus i took plenty ibuprofen tylenol but you know it wasn't that that did anything the lord uses vehicles sometimes like that praise the lord for it but that wasn't what healed me it was my lord jesus that healed me just like it isn't it isn't you're you so i love what brother braden tells the the story about the one that went hunting and had all this game and he said i'm tired of it i want to be a christian he said he said oh what sermon did i preach or what did i do or what i do see he was worried about the messenger he was worried about the delivery driver but he said i want any of that preacher he said i see you've seen all the goodness of god he said he must have done it for me he must love me because i'm not where i'm not a good shot anyway so is it with us we're so worried about the delivery driver oh what can i do to that you're not obligated it's not your obligation you're saying i don't understand enough i don't i don't think i know all this stuff it's not about knowledge anyway the only knowledge that matters is knowledge of him his saving grace to you that's why the prophet would say just tell them how the candle got lit what was jesus christ's power to you and you watch if that doesn't set other things of fire amen he says when the church explains it away and says it's first some other day and something how can god who wants to fulfill his word and perform his word among the people and the people deny that he does it you say well brother we don't explain it away oh well let's think about it the lord puts down your heart you need to go witness to that person you need to pray for that person but lord i've been such a hypocrite that you just explained away the power of god because it's not about you anyway oh well well the lord tells you oh you ought to call no you know i think about the just the little things because if we're faithful and little we'll be faithful and much lord puts a little thing on your heart says oh you know what you ought to call that brother or sister up you know that maybe they need some encouragement you say lord they don't want to hear from anyone you just explained away the power of god you explained it away you found a reasoning we'd remember we spoke about reasonings you found a reason to ignore the call of god and i always liked this thought is that you think the devil was inspiring you to encourage your brother in the lord and yet we'll use that excuse whether we we say it that way or not oh surely you know the lord didn't want me to talk to him he told you to do it follow the still small voice that's your worship and that is a worship when you can lay down you know how many times the lord will ask you to do something when you're at your lowest why because he wants to get you out of the equation amen he wants all thoughts of yourself sometimes he's got to humiliate you to give you a little humility to get you a place where he can work through you and he's doing it this isn't this isn't to be accusatorial or any of those things like accusing no because we've got the bride in here this is to make you understand that you are that conduit you are that one but you've got to not worry about the fulfillment of it that's our god amen i just like using that delivery driver idea it's not if you're getting a package from amazon that delivery driver doesn't care where it came from or even where it's going the only thing he knows he drives his truck picks up a package gets on the road drives to the delivery place drops it off and he's done yes that's what you are you're a delivery vehicle for eternal life you're an icbm an intercontinental ballistic missile you are you are a you are a atomic power atomic power i i i just just kind of had that thought i thought this for so many times you know brother brandon always talked about when two omnipotents meet you know that's the supernatural happens you know i thought about that there's there's something about when you meet another child of god because we call them sons of adam or you know we're the children of adam from descended the sons of god you know atom and you know when two atoms collide that's where the power comes you got you got you got nuclear power creative power that's why the devil likes to keep us apart because when you start bringing this atom this son of adam atom and there's atom together and they said they're looking for fusion and all these other things we got it right here in the spiritual [Applause] and it's not that little atom it doesn't have to do anything you know all the power when that when they split those atoms and they push them together that atom didn't have to do nothing it's the power's inherent in the atom it exists inside the atom already all that process dead was unlock what was already there and if it could take these natural things are given for our benefit you understand they use them for their destructive power that's fine that's great they can use them for whatever they want man always destroys themselves that's great but god for the spiritual minded can see he used the smallest little thing that you can't even see to show the power that could come out of that one little atom and that's you you feel so insignificant you feel so little but you're packing atomic power all you got to do is be willing to be used by god he says and the people deny that does it yet they go through all the rituals see here's what happened god wants to perform by the holy ghost and vindicate his word i like the way he says this god wants to perform by the holy ghost and vindicate his word and the church wants to perform now there's a difference between god performing his word and the church just performing one's putting on a ritual the other one wants to see a real worship in the life of christ that's what he's calling us to simply amen praise the lord let's turn to second timothy chapter two god is you know god is wanting to perform his word more than you want to see it performed he wants to see it he come to pa he's already spoken there's no question about whether it's going to happen or not that's right he's waiting for his people to start to step out second timothy chapter 2 and we'll read verses 3 and 4 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that wareth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier that's the worship we're talking about we're talking about true worshipers we're talking about every day a real a life that is sacrificed to the lord with your desires out the window and we've talked about it so many times but we think about gethsemane and what the lord jesus did in gethsemane was showing that conquering ability over your will you know we we know the scripture says obedience is better than sacrifice why because obedience is a sacrifice it's a sacrifice of your own will it's a sacrifice of your desires to fulfill the desires of him who's called you to be a soldier that's why when they pray bring them in the in the military they cut all the guy's hair off they yell at them all the time what are they doing they're trying to make them see that the only thing that matters is to fulfill the orders that are coming from above you do the orders that are given why because they can see they're seeing more than you're seeing and if it be so in the natural army how much more in the supernatural when we can take our orders from the lord that says that says go into all the world and preach the gospel that says women don't cut your hair and all these different things now we've taken so many of the things correctly we understand the dress we understand the proper way for brothers and sisters to conduct themselves now the question is what are we doing with the rest of it willing to step out put ourselves it's putting yourself on the line why because that because it really comes down to a thing of pride are we willing to be i just had that are we willing to be humiliated for the gospel and see we take that humiliation and say oh it means something went wrong no it doesn't mean anything went wrong they thought everything went wrong when christ was hanging on calvary it looked like everything went wrong when the hebrew boys were about to be thrown in the fiery furnace and yet they said whether he'll deliver us or not he's still able and we won't bow and that's what god is calling in this hour whether he fulfills it the way you want it to be fulfilled i don't know i don't know if he's going to fulfill that healing immediately or in the future by a doctor by a miracle i don't know if that salvation of that loved one is going to come in the next second or the next hour or the next day but it doesn't matter because i don't rest in a time frame i don't rest in the how i rest in the finished work of the word that was spoken already that's where we rest the lord takes care of all of that we won't hold you much longer i just got a couple other quotes that we'll read here is we have uh from we have seen his star and have come to worship him in 1963 he says what time are we living in what is the sign god said he would show last before it come to pass what was the things he said israel in her place over yonder the fig tree was throwing herself back again look at everything just exactly setting in line and the church in the laodicean condition with jesus on the outside a fugitive to his own church just as david was up above bethlehem a fugitive from his own people a fugitive and christ the bible said in the last days was a fugitive to his own people there in revelation the third chapter in the laodicea age that we're living in christ is on the outside knocking trying to get in a fugitive to his own people was then that those warriors grabbed them swords this is what god's looking for us those warriors how many warriors in here for jesus christ we got mighty men and mighty women not by our own power but because he said so when he told gideon thou mighty man of valor and gideon said huh who's he talking to me that's you he said when them warriors grabbed them swords and david cried out for a fresh drink of water and they cut their way through 15 miles of men to get him a drink of water and david poured it out upon the ground a sacrifice a drink offering yes warriors today that's you warriors today jesus wants a drink of good old pentecostal fresh water these denominational stagnated waters is sickening to him take the word of god and pull it cut through all these creeds and things till we can hit that place where there's a fresh drink for him a real true worship that's the worship when you take the word and you start cutting the devil and you say lord i want to worship you i want my life to be a living worship memorial to the lord jesus christ how do you do it you take the word and you say i believe it i'm gonna cut with it i may look silly i may look foolish but i'm gonna walk forward just like abraham that's a real true worship a genuine heart where he can pour down his make his word live in this day he'll have it he said he would restore the faith of the people back to the fathers faith of the children malachi 4 tells us it'll come and it will be there don't you worry it'll be right there god has done said so that's all the clock is ticking right on yes sir but today we see that those great and he goes on from there he says it'll be right there it's right here it's right here what does he say just pick up the swords take that word and start cutting the enemy will fall before that sword there's nothing that can stand i believe it was revelation said the sword that went out from his mouth there was none that could stand to that that double-edged sword just a couple more and then we'll close this is from god's only provided place of worship it says that every little jot everything you must be faithful in always the little the little vine the little the little fox that spoils the vine sometimes you leave it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone lord forgive me for the times when you see so i really appreciate brother matthew's testimony about just seeing a man in a wheelchair say i'll pray for you i don't know if he's walking or not but he stood on the word that's you know what that's what he's calling for just stand on the word you can't do anything else but that what else can you do besides stand on that word and declare that it's the truth and continue to walk in it it says you got you got to be faithful in it it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only strongest at its weakest link blessed are they that do all the commandments of god that they might have the right to enter in do all god said and it said for women to have long hair you say a man told me not long ago said i don't preach a clothesline religion i said then you're not preaching the gospel yeah god laid it out there he said what to do and you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing what little thing what the little insignificant jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little thing and do the little things and a woman to let her hair grow that's just why it's just something she can do and she won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us great teach us the great things how can you teach the great things when you won't do the simple common thing because you see your motive and objective is wrong it's your love to god lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it i'm going to read that one again it's your love to god lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it it's his choosing the place that i've chosen that's where you worship with your sacrifice so if we're talking about a worship and your life being the sacrifice and we know his chosen place of worship is under the shed blood and in the word then where do you where do you worship you worship in the word how do you worship in the word by not leaving the things undone just as simple as that as what we've been hearing our pastor preach fulfilling the works just the little things oh you say what about the miracles god will do that you can't do that anyway yeah brother david just said it first they'll follow you you don't do that any they don't go before all of us want the miracles to go before notice the lord says do the little things the miracles and everything they follow these signs shall follow amen then that belief but not everyone just has to believe it he says they that hear the sayings of my father and do with them maybe let's just examine ourselves say lord what are the little things that we're not doing see it's remember iniquity what did he call me said you workers of iniquity now i don't believe that's anybody here but remember what iniquity is it's not only commission but it's omission when you know to do good and do with it not when you see the one when there's a reason why your job you might hear someone talking about how depressed they've been over the last couple months and we'll just chalk it up in our minds and say oh man that i wonder why i heard that that's because you got the answer or we wonder why someone crosses our path and something just tugs us man maybe i ought to talk to him there's a reason that's happening don't let it go undone that's for all of us that's for me lord help me i'm not pointing the finger that's not the point but god wants to see if we could be faithful in those little things then we'll start to see the things follow then we start to cutting with that word i was getting a haircut yesterday and my wife went over to the to the dollar tree store and i got done with my haircut and i called her and and she was like i'm talking to this this lady and she just happened to talk to this happened to be walking into the dollar tree store and there's this woman coming in there and she said hi and she said oh hi she said oh i really like your skirt and they just started chatting and sure enough this this woman was dating a pentecostal and they must have been a holiness pentecostal because she obviously noticed the skirt and so they started talking and the lord used her to witness to her see that's not leaving the little things undone that's taking that every opportunity say lord i'm gonna i'm gonna step out there on by faith i'm gonna put it on the line my life's gonna be a worship worship is so much it's beyond just oh well praise the lord bless the lord oh my soul we come in here to sing the praises of god no a worship is that every day there's a it's a power worship i'm going to be using that from now on i want a power worship lord he says now he says uh in paragraph 104 he says you put cain brought his sacrifice evil bro abel brought his it depends on what place you take it into if you take it into the place where he's chosen it'll be all right he'll accept it see that's all those scarecrows out there oh you see the ones oh they're they're having these little these little maybe they have some signs and wonders over here they have these things over there but what was it they took their sacrifice and they didn't bring it into the true place of worship it doesn't matter what it looks like on the outside except to be in the true place of worship in the end it won't be accepted why lord lord have not we done this have we not we done that depart from me you that work iniquity i showed you the place of worship in this word and you wouldn't bring your sacrifice there he said it'll be right he'll accept it if it's not he won't accept it don't care it's the same sacrifice whatever it is it's still it's still rejected unless it's brought to that one certain place oh my think about it that's why brother branham could say there's so many that sincerely worship buddha but they're sincerely wrong they're brought some have dedicated you they have those monks and all these ones that completely dedicate their lives to their religion far beyond anything that we have ever probably done and yet it won't benefit one thing because it was brought not under the right place where god is called to worship so the sacrifice will be rejected though sincere so if we have the true place of worship and we've got ourselves as a sacrifice to offer then what hindereth us to offer ourselves when we know that we have the appropriate place to worship amen let's just continue on now we want to find out where we want to bring the sacrifice if we could find out we all want to go to heaven don't we we we uh and we all know we've done wrong we all believe that jesus is the sacrifice now we want to know where to take him it'll be accepted see that's right the bible tells us where to take him at and it'll be and then it'll be accepted outside of there it won't be accepted let us notice here also the place that he chose for the sacrifice to be laid that he that the place that he chose to put the sacrifice you can't put it on any of these gates but the place that he chose to put it he also put his name in that place see that's what he said here he chose to put his name in it now let us search the scriptures for this place for that is the place where he put his name now let's read from the text and i had a little note laying here that i this morning come to me let's take the second verse of this chapter now i don't want to hold too long on account of the people on these hookups out here now the second verse of the 16th chapter thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of thy flocks and thy heard in the place which the lord shall choose to put his name there now you can't take this your sincerity and all that you want to confess you just can't take it to a methodist altar to a baptist altar to a pentecostal altar but there is an altar somewhere that he chose that he to put his name in it and he would meet you at that place now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything's set in order if there's a short in that wire that light won't come on because it's been grounded and when you'll take one of god's words or one of his places and in your own heart have selfish objectives it'll ground the power of god right there if you do it because you want to be smart you want to be different from somebody else or something right there is grounded it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've got to come with sincerity with all your heart your motives and your objective place that on god then search for his place find where he said and bring it there now the reason i read that i really wanted to read that is because i feel like many of us are almost on the opposite side of that if i could say it that way sincere we know the word but then the devil gives you every excuse why not the throat bring that sacrifice of your worship out there and step out under the word because you've got the right say lord i don't desire to see the work of god for me to have a name i believe that none of us are here to do that i i've we've talked uh you know just talking with all the ones that i've talked to our desire is to serve god to see the name of the lord jesus lift it up but the devil would put those scarecrows up and say oh you can't do it because of this and you can't do it because of that when all the lord wants you to do is just put all that aside and say lord it's your word i have no power to fulfill your word anyway i couldn't do it if i wanted to as much how many desires to see the word of god fulfilled raise your hand amen how many of you can do it yourself exactly so all we can do is walk in that just like when elijah came to mount carmel the showdown and at the end when he said all this i have done at thy word oh lord he had done as much as he could do at that point it was on the lord to to vindicate and to bring it to pass so what is the lord calling us to do set what do you do he place the wood in order get that life in order let's get it all in order with this word let's set it up in order our own lives we've done that we're we're we're fulfilling those things see that's why i want to encourage you because it's not it's not to beat us down but to make us see where we are at what the lord has called us to and the ability he's placed within you because the only ability you have to have is to walk in this word now he's placed the holy ghost in you and i got the quote i'm gonna read right at the end here we'll read it in just a second he's already put it there now you just need to take it off the shelf and put it on the word and it'll bring it it'll bring it to pass how i don't know when i don't know what it's going to look like exactly in every situation i don't know but he will bring it to pass because he promised it because it's not on you to fulfill it anyway let's just all stand if we can i'll close with this i want to read just one more little quote here he's this rapture's it's already in the process we're going in a rapture the lord's word is being fulfilled even now even now you being here is the fulfillment of the word in this hour this laodicean age he's going to have a bride he's going to have a people he has a people that are willing to take god at his word and we'll just read this and then we'll close with this it's from the message abraham seed and it starts at uh we're in uh chat uh paragraph 22 from 1959. and i'll even wait for them to get there he says what are you scared about are you afraid to take his word for anything don't be afraid call the thing right i'm an heir to this oh i know i don't deserve it but i'm an heir anyhow because i'm an heir i receive it amen that's it there you are because i'm an heir that's it we're heir of salvation heir of the holy spirit i'm an heir because jesus paid the price nothing i had to do i want to say that again nothing i had to do i just fell heir to it amen i'm healed because i'm an heir to it amen my diseases are gone my affliction is gone why because i'm an heir to it oh perfect assurance jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine heir of salvation purchased of god born of his spirit washed in his blood that's our story oh then satan can't stand that see because he's a defeated being he's nothing but a bluff jesus paid the price called us by his grace where air what a perfect setup that is see he's already defeated i never defeated him how many and i want you to think about and i'm gonna i'll confess how many of you have been fought by the devil with certain things and you just fight as if you're the one that needs to fight that that needs to win no just like jesus all he did in the wilderness was stand on the word because the devil was already defeated he's a defeated being i really like that he's not he paid the price he said he's already i never defeated him christ defeated him i'm just claiming my own god-given privileges that's all you do you just tell satan get away from here i've got an abstract deed on this building it's mine i aired it notice abraham he was just an ordinary man come down from the tower of babel with his father and they settled down in the probably was up in the land of shinar come on down into the city of ur in the land of the chaldeans he was just an ordinary man not nothing not no saint no god he's just an ordinary man just an ordinary man nothing about him any different than anyone else no more than there is you just an ordinary person but god saw something in him and he called him god seen the same thing in every born-again man and woman here now abraham wasn't afraid to put his to work are you the same faith that he gave abraham he gives it to you freely if you'll use it say i have a gun it'll shoot it's a good true shooting gun i hang it up on the wall i say yeah oh sure i got a gun what do you do with it hangs on the wall that's faith people say oh i'm a christian oh i believe god can but what do you do about it put it to work turn it loose do something with it get out and hunt up the devil where he says you're still hurting say you're a liar pull a bead on him get him in the scope don't be afraid to pull the trigger because it'll go off sure is anything yes sir it'll boomerang on them so hold on all you got to do is pull the trigger you put that bullet in the chamber you pull the hammer back all you got to do is pull the trigger the powers the power doesn't lie with the gun itself it's the bullet it's the power inside the bullet to project that that's the same way with the word of god the power is not in you it's in the holy ghost that promised it all you got to do is pull it off the shelf and hold it there and say i believe it i believe it and i believe it enough to act on it brother branham preach that message hearing and i can't forgive me i'm blanking on it now but i know hearing receiving and acting we've heard we've received now it's time to act don't be afraid to be humiliated so what if it doesn't happen what what if i praise her from when they don't get healed well that's not up to you the word said they would [Music] so the lord's word is perfect all you got to do that bullet is already in the chamber all you got to do is be willing what do you say pull a bead on the devil you got a sickness pull a beat on it pull the trigger the promise if i can say it this way the promise is already locked and loaded i am the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases [Music] i am the lord your deliverer he'll deliver you he'll deliver your loved ones the promise is already loaded in the chamber all you've got to be willing to do is pull the gun off of the shelf pull it off the wall and start acting on it the lord will meet you the promise see the promise that moses had moses upset you you're the deliverer it would have done no good if he would have just remained in the wilderness but what did he do he took god at his word and he just started walking stick in his hand how did brother braham described it he said he said his wife was on there pregnant with a child on her hip everything just going down in the desert where are you going most i'm going to take over how's it going to happen i don't know all i know is that god told me and all i know is i could do what he said that's all we're looking to do the devil says how's it going to happen i don't know all i know is what the word says that's and that's our i like brother matthew said that and that's been on my heart it's like i just read that about that single eye that focus of if your eye is single then your whole body is full of light let's put the focus on the word of god don't look at the symptoms don't look at the situations god is a complete everything's on his time anyway it's right on time god's prophetic time clock is just moving right along perfect and praise the lord we've each been called to be a part of it amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer [Music] how many of you here this evening say lord i just want to i want to take the gun off the wall lord you filled me with your holy ghost [Music] lord you've given me a revelation of who i am and the truth of your word but lord i've just let it sit on the on the sidelines for so long maybe the devil scared you into a corner looking at your life and looking at the situations [Music] and put you in a corner and said oh i just i'm not good enough for the lord to do it it's not about you anyway it's not about your ability it's about his ability and he already finished the work his word is perfect all we need to do is put it into action be willing to step out by faith how many of you would just raise your hand and say lord i want to be willing to take that that step of faith to pull a beat on the devil and pull the trigger with your promises lord [Music] the lord sees your hands my hands are up i just want to see his word come to pass he's not looking for you to fulfill it he'll he'll fulfill the work there's nothing in ourselves that we could do it anyhow but he planted a seed in you that can accept his word that can believe his word that can walk in his word and all you got to do is pull it off the shelf and use it he's put his faith in you paul said the life that i now live i live by my own faith he said no i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me we're not even living by our own faith [Music] lord jesus we just come humbly before you this evening oh god lord we just ask you right now to increase our faith lord you've seen the hands that were raised your children that just desire to walk lord in a worship of you every single day o lord laying their lives down laying their desires down laying everything that they have down in a worship to you lord you brought us to your house of worship lord we're not even talking about this building but your word under the shed blood of the lamb in the word of god in this hour that you've revealed to us lord we're underneath the umbrella of your wings we've come here lord to offer ourselves as living sacrifices lord increase our faith lord lord increase our courage lord bring us to a place where we're not afraid of of a failure lord because we there's nothing to fail lord your word can't fail if we would just step out in faith lord you said these signs would follow them that believe but you're asking for your children lord just to take that faith and walk forward to take those footsteps of possession lord we just ask that you increase our faith this evening oh lord may we see lord that you've called us to that place lord it's not about that delivery driver it's not about the one carrying the package lord you've called us to be the one to be able to deliver eternal life lord you put your life in us lord lord you've given us a word to be able to speak lord that we can witness and testify may you just help us oh god to go out and live that worshipful life lord looking for the

these brothers preach and i think i don't i i might just start maybe i just need to go into retirement or something i mean it's just so wonderful the word of the lord is just so good i hope you just really encouraged your heart tonight you know you'll you'll never know the effect that you can have in somebody else's life you know i mean just the word that you say just the kindness that you show you could really make a difference and i brother ham so many times said i'm just here to help somebody along the way you know just a sojourner along the way and if we could just fearlessly let our light shine and fearlessly stand up for what we believe they will see i may read this statement monday but i mean sunday morning but brother branham said when pharaoh saw moses standing in front of him with a stick saying let my people go [Music] pharaoh knew that moses believed believed in what that he was doing or trying to do he looked at him and said this guy must really believe what he's believing amen but he had god on his side and don't don't forget that amen just such a sweet spirit of the lord is we want to remember john beale's wife in prayer she's very very very ill and i believe she's on some form of respirator and they they want to you know stop any treatment and you know i just i hate to have anybody be in that situation where they have to make that decision so i said brother john just give it a few days and we'll see what the lord will do so we just want the lord if he would kindly be merciful to us just to come and undertake in the way of his will you know brother branham said that if if god wants to take you home there's not enough doctors in medicine in the world to keep you here he says but if god wants to keep you here there's not enough sickness in the world to take you out so just like our brother said tonight i think it's that whole consciousness of us giving god the preeminence in our lives i want to pray this any other maybe you have a prayer request maybe not for yourself but for somebody else that you'd like to see the lord touch and you'd like to lift your hand on their behalf of a loved one or someone that you're concerned about that you would love to have them know the lord or you would love for them to be touched by the hand of the lord okay we're not praying for ourselves we're praying for the people now that you have on your heart and we're bringing these people before the throne of the lord and asking the lord to be mindful of them and to reach down his mercies and his tender hand to their lives heavenly father the people have loved ones on their heart and maybe relatives maybe friends father people that they have a burden for and they're bringing the them to your throne and they're placing them at your feet lord and asking that you would consider their situation father they may be lost in without you lord and they just need that move of your spirit in their life to bring them back home father they may be sick and the sickness is keeping them from living for you the way that they would desire to father father some might be in a financial place an hour of decision whatever the need is father i don't know the people they've brought before you and i don't know the needs they brought before you but father i felt as this body being a body of action lord that we've brought our request and these persons before your throne and we've placed them their father and we're interceding on their behalf that you would send your grace into their lives and touch them for we ask these things in your precious and wonderful name jesus we pray hey man amen praise the lord i wish i was a song leader i can't even think of a song when i get up here so but you're a song person you're in the same boat i know that's the trouble so amen [Music] amen let's sing this this is your dismissal song go in peace praise the lord [Music] [Music] i will oh [Music] god [Music] is your name [Music] [Music] me
