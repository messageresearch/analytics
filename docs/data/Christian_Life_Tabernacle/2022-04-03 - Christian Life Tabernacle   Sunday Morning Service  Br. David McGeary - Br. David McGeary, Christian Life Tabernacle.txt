[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] me [Music] within me [Music] me [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] fear [Music] [Music] me [Music] with a [Music] from [Music] [Music] salvation [Music] [Music] amen every day when we woke up that his spirit may come and fill us that we may think like him act like him and he may do all things like he would do amen we invite brother mike right now to come and open up in a word of prayer and read our psalm this morning certainly welcome everyone in the house of god this morning it's good to be in the presence of the lord amen man there's no place better place to be than to be with him amen amen let's go ahead and pray commit the service to him father how we so appreciate the opportunity to come and to gather together in your presence lord to be given the opportunity father to once again sit at your feet to hear from you to learn of you father as the song says we pray that you created us a clean heart that you'd renew a right spirit within us lord as we come in from the highways and the byways where we're constantly pummeled by all the voices all the influences lord and what a precious place to be able to come to lord to just be found among your believers and to be here with your presence we welcome you in this place we pray that you would have dominion over all things from the beginning to the end of the service we committed utterly to you that your word would have preeminence lord that you would deal with hearts lord that you would direct us in the ways that you'd have us to go and lord that you draw us closer to you we welcome your presence we pray these things in jesus name amen amen there's there's a story in second kings 22 23 of a king king josiah who assumes the throne and you know discovers that he needs to re-familiarize the people with the word as he's as he's rebuilding and restoring the temple and they discover the law in second kings 3 2 we read how he gathered all the people into the house and as they stood he read the entire book of the law to the children of israel with that in mind we're going to turn to psalm 119 this morning no we're not going to read all of someone just wanted to see who was listening but we are going to read out of psalm 119 this morning and you know i thought we might take the next few weeks and just go through the entire chapter such a wonderful chapter it's divided into 22 eight verse sections probably take a section a week just spend some time there that almost every single one of the 176 verses have some reference to the word of god i'm going to read the first eight verses this morning in a certain verse stuck out to me in verse 5. it said o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes it's interesting how this references two different things my ways and his statutes two separate and different things you know it is a psalmist crying out oh that my ways kept your statutes you know and that's that's that doesn't sum up the battle i don't know what does i think that's what we all struggle with every day my ways versus his statutes you know it says in isaiah 55 and verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts the two couldn't be further apart you know anyone who has an experience with the lord will surely recognize the struggle every day of getting our ways to match his word you know that's what his statutes are his word you know my ways the way i do things the way i am the way i act the way i behave the way i think the way i see it all my ways you know and we know that our ways conflict with the word oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes now notice in verse 1 blessed are the undefiled in the way the way who walk in the law of the lord now notice that there's my ways which conflict with his statutes or his word but those who walk in the word are undefiled in the way so there is from my many ways to his one way you know we all recognize the problem we all deal with it the struggle to keep to get my ways to keep his word but where we run into trouble is when we try to use my ways to keep his word you know you can't use my ways to get my ways to match my his way you just can't be done you know the psalmist says something important in verse 5 he says oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statute there has to be a director there there has to be something directing in order for my ways to keep his statutes you know in three verses later in verse eight he says this i will keep thy statutes so we go from verse 5 oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes to verse 8 i will keep thy statutes something happened between those two verses somewhere in there he found the directing to get his ways to keep his word it says in psalm 32 8 i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with mine i in order to be undefiled in the way in order to get my ways to keep his statutes i need direction i need someone an instructor to teach me the way to guide me not in the way i see things but the way he sees things your brother branham preached a sermon on that verse called god's eye says in verse 7 psalm 119 7 i will praise thee with uprightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments a learning process direct my ways instruct thee teach thee when i shall have learned between the cry o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes and i will keep thy statutes there was an encounter with a teacher and that's ultimately the secret to bringing my ways in line with his statutes where my ways become his way in his way becomes my ways you know as we read psalm 119 you know the question would be to make sure that we are in fellowship with the teacher that we know the teacher the director the instructor the one who would guide us with his eye as we read psalm 119 the next few weeks it's important that the entire book the entire chapter rather is all about a relationship with the word and so we'll read the first eight verses this morning and i guess my prayer and hopefully the prayer for all of us is that you know our ways would match his way that we would spend time with the teacher and maybe we don't know all things but like brother branham said we know the author really well amen let's read psalm 119 1-8 this morning starting at verse 1 blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways thou has commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes then shall i not be ashamed when i respect unto all thy commandments i will praise thee with a brightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments i will keep thy statutes oh forsake me not utterly amen and god bless you may have your seats man let's sing i'm pressing on amen [Music] i'm practicing on the upwards way oh [Music] hey [Music] is [Music] ah oh [Music] oh

only worthy to be preached by angels but yet you chose man and father the not only did you choose them but you paid a price for them you sent your spirit to lead and guide them [Music] lord and this morning that's what each of our hearts desire is that you would lead us and guide us father according to your thoughts according to your word not the understanding of men father but the revelation of your divine word and lord this morning we ask that as we deal with certain things father that the spirit of love and unity would be our portion and lord that we would sincerely have come this morning to grow in the understanding of your word and the understanding father of the path that you're [Music] choosing for us to go forward on we ask father that you bless us this morning just may you speak to us individually to each of our hearts we ask it this morning in jesus precious and humble name we pray amen god bless you amen you may be seated this morning brother joelle and sister rachel cabaya are going to dedicate their son samuel alex to the lord this morning so let's sing that as we sing it bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to jesus amen this is this is where you want to start their life right here in the house of the lord in church so let's sing it as they come oh bring down [Music] [Applause] [Music] bring it down [Music] amen all right i'm going to try to hold the little fella you think you'll let me all right come here oh this is samuel hey man hey man here mama you better take them [Laughter] they make me nervous you know you always feel that they're going to twitch on you this is just a beautiful testimony this couple this family and you know how they came together and like every young couple or a young person they're looking to find someone that they can be close to and and uh and looking for a companion and it just seems like they met here at the church and usually everybody's running off somewhere you know what i mean but this is just so such a nice thing this morning and feel the presence of the lord here so it's wonderful so brother joelle if you dedicate your son samuel alex to the lord then we as the people will pray for him father we thank you for this privilege father to give us this morning to bring the same with everybody no because same will come from you but you just send him didn't decide to ask father so we bring him back to you father because we can not do anything for him without you you said we cannot do anything without you so we bring him to your father for you to protect him and to keep him father in everybody we go father let him father follow his way father lord have a desire is to see him go in your will against praising father and to serve your father lord hates us our spirit father we ask you to give us wisdom and knowledge to raise him in my way father lord we thank you again once again father we ask you father to give this joy that we have given to us to other people that's looking for we thank you at this moment in jesus name we pray amen amen let's all pray together our gracious father lord we know that you're wonderful and you're great and as samuel heard from the lord father we ask that samuel alex hears from you also that you speak to his heart father through his life show him what's right and wrong and give them the grace and the spirit to choose that's which is right father may he stand for your word just as samuel did undying and unchanging just staying with it regardless of what they felt father and held fast to the word even to the chopping off of the head of king father that because your word said so father may he have that great stand for the word of god i ask that you bless this family father may they grow and prosper and be in good health in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you so much god bless you sis beautiful amen hallelujah okay thank you musicians um before we um start uh preaching this morning i just want to um bring a few things to you and i think the best way for me to do it is maybe to start with an apology and you know um there's a lot of pressure that goes with being a pastor um and it's not an easy job and of course you feel within yourself you're not capable of doing it and you deal with all your personality flaws in your complexes and because of that many times you shrink away from your duties uh what god's called you to do and the obligation and responsibility that you have to the word and i you know i'm i'm sensitive to hurting people's feelings and i'm i i always kind of wait till things back me and to a corner and then i come out fighting and sometimes i come up fighting too hard and i'm trying to be more gentle but you know i let things slip a lot because with every circumstance or with every incident there's always a person involved and i always have a little saying i tell myself i said there won't be any people in heaven and basically because of human nature but i want to address something that brother branham addressed quite a bit in the message god in simplicity and he talked in god in simplicity he's talking about the sanctuary and what goes on in the sanctuary and how we should conduct ourselves in the sanctuary and he said now this may seem a little rude but it's not a place to visit it's a place of worship and you know and um he said we should never even murmur a word inside of here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary we should never rally around we should never run through the building or let our children run through the building therefore dedicating ourselves let us remember when we enter that sanctuary keep still to one another and worship god if we want to visit each other there's a place we may visit each other like that but never walk around where you can't hear yourself think and some person and some person come in and they just don't know what to do see it's so much noise in things just humanly you know and and he says i've seen churches until it's made me feel real bad because we we do not come into the sanctuary of the lord to meet each other we come here to worship god and then go to our homes this sanctuary is dedicated to worship stand outside talk anything you wish as long as it's right and holy and go to one another's home visit one another in places but when you enter that door keep quiet you come here to talk to him let him talk back to you the trouble of it is we do too much talking and don't listen enough then when we come in here wait on him and you know i'm even guilty of this maybe more so than you realize but you know there's a way too much visiting going on in the four-year the deacon standing outside and we need to become more conscious of the presence of the lord and the holiness of his sanctuary now we know that this is just brick and mortar and the prophet of god said the real church is the character of the people in the church and our character comes from obeying god's word that's our character that's the character of our church is that we've set forth the word of god in our lives each of us to live the word of god and and therefore you know we begin to let things slip and we do it because we don't have a place to practice music and and practice specials and things but to be a hundred percent honest with you the sanctuary is not the place to do that we probably really should maybe get a piano or something in the back room where we could practice our specials and i know people have a lot of camaraderie and fellowship but this just isn't the place to do it and i've let it go on and let it go on and i don't know how to fix it but there's things that got to be fixed you've noticed that we've are let we have musicians and we never want to think that one spot is a person has that spot and that's their spot that's why we've got with the people that want to play and we've been rotating them and letting the different musicians play different things but work we'll do that with our song leaders at times we'll do it with the psalm reading at time you know the prophet of god said when we come together we we read a song you know the way it used to be done is that we he would read a verse and they would read a verse but since we're so many different cultures and languages we've went ahead and allowed that to be done together but one of the main things that i've really got to approach and that i've left slipped is the kind of music that we're allowing in the church and i know gifts and callings are without repentance and we like music and we like inspiration but there's a lot of artists out there today that have a gift and they write very inspirational music but music isn't can be an instrument of the devil and you know sometimes we'll have an artist and then we'll go look at that artist and and we'll pick his music and and i think it's important that when we teach our our children choirs or our youth choirs if we're gonna practice a song and it's an inspirational song and it's a good song and there's hardly not a song that you can pick that you don't have to take all the boogie woogie out of it and all the country twang because they don't do that music they you might think that they do it to worship if they only did it to worship they wouldn't collect a nickel and they wouldn't take a reward it's christian entertainment and what's happened is is that the christianity the music of christianity this all this contemporary music is nothing but rock and roll with uh with christian lyrics and just entertainment and then those songs end up in our church and without us ever vetting the songs looking at the origin looking at what the message is okay and i mean i i looked a video out here that was brought to my attention and and as i was this was on my heart and you know i i i don't know the song i don't care maybe we've sung it here maybe views sung it but when i looked at it you know here's all the people going he's not going to tread and just guitars ripping and everything in lyrics like the blood ran down the tree into his throat and choked me i mean rap songs rap lyrics worldly you know we might pick the group you know and and and you got to look at it they might like a good song you know but i'll just be honest with you i mean i'm shaken and and i noticed they're not popular you know what i mean but we've got to start vetting you know what vetting is right you get all the dirt out of it and i don't think we ought to if we're going to teach our children a song and and there's inspiration there and and there's there because those people are annoying it and there's an anointing but we don't need them to teach our song if you find a song you get with the musicians you practice it you play it you introduce it but let's quit playing these artists you know i mean you know getting our kids here and playing a video so they can learn a song quick sending them to the internet to listen and watch these guys perform because that's the standard of christianity that you're setting and let me tell you christianity today doesn't have any resemblance to what real christianity is and and the music today you know and i know that you you can't always do away with the song because of the artist i understand that albus presley sang amazing grace so i don't throw amazing grace out because albus presley wrote it i like the song egypt i believe laura and and clever sing it but i i i don't throw that out because the group kane saying it and i'm sure nobody in here would ever listen to a group that had the name kane mean i did business uh with a guy one time and i i just should have known by his last name not to do business with him i think his last name was deceiver and you know and you know and uh so and yeah he got to me but i'm just saying and i don't have time to listen to every song but parents listen watch what your kid's listening to watch how we teach our kids and what songs we're picking and what and there's nothing wrong with an old-fashioned gospel song music is a way that satan uses to communicate his views on god and what he feels our views on god should be you can sing a song that god's merciful god loves everybody you know and and and everybody's going to be saved because of the love of god and it might be the most beautiful anointed song but the words in it that's not true it's not true so we're we're going to try to do better with the music and our song specials and and i would really like the opportunity when we have a choir song and i'm not very musically inclined and that's why i shy away from it so much but i i think that we need to be in a greater position to vet and this is what the prophet of god said he said well this morning i don't say this sacrilegious i heard one of them great famous organizations and my daughter and i was listening to the radio as we went to dedicate a church and a song they sang some kind of something another by so and so some of that classic singing that sounds to me like a woman holding their breath till they're blue in the face and then think that singing that's squeaking i like good old pentecostal singing right from your heart you couldn't carry a tune in a coal bucket but yet your singing making a joyful nose to the lord i think that's spiritual i like it but that holding your breath till you're just blew in the face and die away and then come back you don't even know yourself what you're singing that you know goes for all of us how you expect somebody else to know that's it jesus said we speak them things we know that's right that's right we ought to do what we ought to do is sing what we know in our heart what we feel not some tune because it's anointed you know what i mean not because it's entertaining not to it like but really what we should sing and what but the reason i'm saying this is because we can't accomplish what god is wanting us to accomplish in this hour but continually lowering our standard in our bar because the filter is getting tighter and what goes through the mesh is getting smaller and and it and i should have clipped a lot of this in a bud a long time ago and it would have never had to get to this point that's my fault and i apologize to that i've let conduct go on our preliminary services are too long we need to shorten things up we need to bring it back under the guidelines that the prophet of god told us to to bring and my obligation is to the word and too many times i let my obligation be to the people because i love them and i don't want to offend them and i don't want to hear them and i don't want to tell them they're wrong the authority of the leadership of the church has been delegated to me and honestly i never wanted it never wanted to be a preacher i never wanted to be a pastor but i didn't have control over it and and i don't like what i am i look in the mirror and i want to be different every day but there's one thing that's true and that's god's word and there's one thing he did do is send us a messenger so i'm not looking at any person i just wanted to let you this morning know that i have let the bars down in many areas and i'm going to try to reestablish some of the boundaries that i've let go and it doesn't have to do with anybody feeling anybody's personalities or any things like what was said this morning this is our leadership and you know this only because it was interpreted to you by a prophet there is something in this book that was allotted to this age that people have been studying this book for years and they could never see it but in this hour it's been pulled out of there because it was sealed up in there just for us and i think that's what we've got to make sure that we line up with and i don't mean to the point of legalism but i mean to a point of a guideline where we pray about it and we we we go about it in prayer and and so i could continue on here and i'll finish this with the music and with things and and when they got through my daughter studies music and she said brother she said that was really a classic and i said yes but how many of them choir at that choir of about 50 people do you think had a cigarette on their breath how many of that choir do you think last night being saturday night they didn't have a little social drink how many women in there had bobbed hair how many had pain on when the pastor of the church said a few days ago god made a prettier world when he invented paint when you know that those these one woman in the bible painted her face and god fed her to the dogs and we anybody that knows anything about the church and about heathens knows that paint is a heathen trait always has been and yet women do it and men smoke drink and carry on and stand there and sing voices like that we'll get to that in a few minutes right here all right belong to an organization thinking when there's going to be a disappointment at the judgment when my opinion so don't you take it this morning as me scolding you take this as an apology from me to you from being not having the courage to stand up and face these issues because of my complexes because of the timidness of my spirit with confrontation so you know what the prophet said go read the first part of god in simplicity and take it from the messenger himself and let us all try to move to that perfection in our music so we need to pray for our songs pray for our children's choir pray how we teach them pray for our adult choirs how we pick our songs how that we don't emulate the artist when you find a song that's good and let's try to move forward in that we all agree i hope this morning amen i'm glad the pastor can't be voted out you know that don't you i just want to make sure you know that you know god doesn't run things by democracy and we know that don't we all right so let's get to some better things let's get to our predestination okay it's what time so it's 11 what let's make let's just try to go a million miles a minute and let's be out of here by 12 and we'll just have communion service so let's stand and read this morning and as we we're on our great journey through this beautiful message um and we're going to turn to ephesians again i know this probably one of the scriptures uh and and let's start with ephesians 2 and 4. the ephesians 2 and 4 the epistle of paul and he said but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with us together with christ even while we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus that he might showed us in the ages to come this is a prophet speaking for grace for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen so god has something for ordained for all of us that are sitting here let us pray our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you we've been looking at this wonderful easter message the rising of the sun and we've looked at it because uh it is the last easter year that brother brahms ministry was here on earth and as we begin to look at it we're going to just do a little quick review to as we begin to move forward in this message so we understand that the prophet of god explained to us that there was a seed that is in all of us and that seed is the word of god and that god had us in his thinking from the beginning and he went through the scriptures in type and began to show in type that god placed it in type that by the types we can realize what god's doing and i think this morning i think that's what would help us all in our lives if if we could understand what's god doing with my life what is it that he's wanting to extract from me because that's what he said the sun pulls the seed out so there's something in you that god's trying to extract he's trying to pull out and that's why satan comes early in our lives and he scars our lives he scars our thinking he scars our feelings he scars our emotions we know the story of a a a little girl who had was suffering all kinds of depressions and fears and anxieties and and she she had a great battle in her mind and the prophet of god uh as he began to look through her life he said this was all brought on to you because a dog chased you and scared you when you were just a young child and so here's that effect on that person okay all their lives and there's a lot of things that has affected our lives a lot of circumstances a lot of failures a lot of history and and satan's the day that you were placed here on earth he started a long-range plan to to put so much concrete over you if they use that expression to put put such a heap of a mountain of things on our hearts and on our minds and our burdens and our past and everything and he does it because he doesn't want us to go forward he does not want this church to reach the perfection that is prophesied satan's whole journey is to discredit the word of god and he's not talking about discrediting this word of god because this bible kills the word of god is not in letter form the word of god is sitting here this morning in human form and what he's trying to do he's placed it in you in seed form he had you or his workmanship if you couldn't boast he knew what he wanted you to be he knew what he wanted to mold you into he knew what his plan was and he had a plan and he chose to unfold it the way that he unfolded it now we've come to a very unique time in the history of the church and that's where god moves from dealing with the groups like he did in the church ages and he begins to deal with individuals and he's trying to extract out of that individual hear me the image that he had of that person in the beginning sometimes he's got to take that vessel and completely break it down and remold it again but you'll find out like paul found out he's going out doing all these things he thinks he's he's got authority to do because the high priest get gave him the authority and he's carrying out his plan just like the disciples in the upper room today they looked out and they thought oh well we need to replace the judas and so they drew straws but it wasn't their authority to replace that it wasn't the what god chose to do and how god chose to do it so god goes gets a man and this man's riding down the road and just feels he's carrying out the will of god and everything and all sudden he gets smacked and he says it's hard paul to kick against the print and it's it's hard for us when we battle against what god is trying to extract out of us don't worry about this body because you're going to get a new one it's the character that we take with us it's the spirit on the inside that we take care of it so god's been bringing this church up through the ages and now there comes a time that he wants that church to come into the maturity that he had in his mind you say well what is that what did god have well christ was the mystery of god revealed what what he had in his mind for us he showed us in christ jesus that's why as christians we say to be like jesus that's our goal to be like him amen you know to know when to braid the cord and clean the temple to know when to turn the other cheek to know when to pick up the ear and put it on there's so many aspects he i mean he wasn't always what you would call sweet oh you vipers you know you hypocrites you know you buried the prophets but before you he knew he knew when to be what he had to be and we know that religion is a covering so it allows men to be religious god don't care about religion he cares about you he cares about what he wants you to be does he allow us to do things yes most of the time i would speak to myself i find myself in the permissive will of god but he promised that he would take the permissive will of god and turn it into the perfect will because there's one thing that god can't do is he can't lie and if he thought something about you and he doesn't bring it to pass in you that would make him a liar now sometimes he's got to take somebody home in order to accomplish what he's going to accomplish you know the story about the minister that finally got so discouraged he went and got some beer and he's gonna sit down behind his platform and just drink and he's willing to cash it all in well god had to take him home because god was not gonna allow that to keep him from meeting what god's expectations are so don't look at your complexes look in the mirror of god's word and know that god had an image of you before you ever started this life's journey we've created our own image of ourselves but that didn't stop him did it it didn't stop him from finding you from saving you from doing things for you that you didn't deserve preserving you and keeping you and just think you sit here this morning and you have the ability to hear god's word he's kept you thus far and if he started to work in you he'll complete it the prophet of god said we would just save ourselves and god a lot of trouble if we would just humbly submit to his will and so we understand the churches we understand these things so we're just reviewing real quick so there was a time you understand the church wasn't what it is today it it when it moved in justification we know they came out of the catholic church the catholic church was not the representative of christianity but anytime the world wants to put a religious figure in some sort of entertainment or some sort of explanation of everything it's always a priest it's always the catholic church they've become the symbol for religion because that's satan's symbol of religion that satan's system to have a nickel ladianism spirit to have to have the people ruled over by ideas or interpretations instead of the pure revelation of god's word how that you're led is you're led by revelation divine revelation if you're if you have a revelation it's never going to be contrary to god's word god doesn't give revelation contrary to his word but now if you if you accept an explanation or an interpretation you might come up with anything and it might seem good for a season but the farther down the road it gets it starts to stray it starts to move until finally it's off target and it in our lives we're not off target as far as the building goes we're not off target as far as this goes because we've got the mechanics but that wasn't what god was trying to target he's trying to target something in you an image of you that he had in his mind that had to be comparable to the image of the lord jesus because he was the mystery of what god had in his mind revealed he didn't come in a system he didn't come in an organization he didn't come answering to man he answered to the word and that word that is they're so subject to that word that when it was brought up before the high priest then and he and i i forget about paul or stephen one of them was brought up before the high priest and the high priest uh said something and and uh the guy came up and smacked he says does that revile us the high priest you know what he said forgive me that's how timid those guys were that's how that i didn't know he was the high priest even though he's wrong even though he's he's mistaken i would never do anything to undermine him i wouldn't do anything to bring disrespect because his message was about something that was farther down the road something that was to come an exodus that's going on and we're in a great hour right now of a great exodus the exodus isn't over it's just beginning it was prophesied to us so each of you this morning god has an image of you and he put it in you in seed form what he had in his thinking in the beginning of you what he saw he put it in you and now because he planted it he's got to extract it amen just like a seed goes into the ground right the seeds lying there it gets watered but then the sun comes and extracts it he's been extracting this church through seven ages through justification through sanctification through the baptism of the holy ghost through seven ages the church has been coming up but finally after seven ages one came on the scene that matched the image of his son now though i know the church world don't like that but that image of his son was to be manifested in our age in the fulfillment of prophecy because nothing can be outside of god's word so there had to be the image which was christ jesus went into the ground it started out at the day of pentecost didn't it silver and gold have i none rise up and walk people were healed just by standing in their shadows think of it that was the image that was the church why was the church like that because they had to see you didn't choose me i chose you and all that the father hath given me will come but that church was what it was because on the day of pentecost he sent back the same spirit that was in jesus name i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again now don't look at yourself all your failures all your mistakes all your feelings and everything that don't mean nothing to god in fact he already paid that off there's nothing can be laid to the charge of god's elect because the seed of god remaineth in them i don't care what you've squandered every one of us has the right of the prodigal son you know that story right he wasted everything all his money all his inheritance on right unrighteous ravelous living gambling women everything until finally he was in a pig pen but you know who was in that pig pen a son of god bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and when he showed up at his father's doorstep a wreck i'm not worthy to be called your son let me be a servant i i'm good at pig feeding let me go down and fig feed pigs i'd rather feed pigs in the house of god than be out in the world amen how did the father respond the only way he could because he already had an image in his mind that that was his son so what did the father do the father returned that son and restored that son to what that he was kill the fatted calf go get the king's robes and the legalistic brother come up and say how can you do that look at what he done and look at the father the father says all i have is yours you've already got it why are you jealous rejoice because this is your brother that was lost and has now returned praise god okay so he knew what that sun was so no matter how far that sun went he extracted from that sun the inheritance that he already possessed and restored him back hallelujah i will restore saith the lord all the palmer worm and cankerworm and lucas and caterpillar has eaten i will restore my sons and my daughters back to their rightful position but he had a way of doing it and he said that way was is that when that crop finally came to maturity right it went into the ground a seed but then it started a journey and when it came back to seed again in the old testament type they went out and they cut that stock down that was now mature wheat and they waved it over the people the field saying all the rest of this field is going to come into this maturity what was jesus he was the first person that fulfilled the law hallelujah that's what he said i fulfilled every jot every tittle search the scriptures because in them you think you have eternal life but they are which testify of me he was a fulfillment of the law i'm the fulfillment of all the laws and all the prophets i'm the first fruit of the of the law we're exiting out of the law into grace and then he took the spirit that was matured in him and went to the church in seed form because the church of the day of pentecost was only sitting there in seed form so he said you go up there and you wait because i'm going to come again and i'm going to be with you even in you till the end and he waived the first fruits of the law and the resurrection because the law was the law of what sin and death so now he was the first one that came out of sin and death because there was no sin that could be found in him oh hallelujah right and then he said i have overcome the grave death hell in the grave so there he was the first fruit the curse of that the garden was gone oh i should just jump in i just got to say it because the prophet of god said when he rose you rose with them waved out over the people what was he doing he let the jews go he waved it out over the people at the day of pentecost the first fruits and what did that do that sparked them and anointed them to become what god's image of them was he commissioned them so now we've come to this age through seven ages the church is to mature and finally we've come to the hour where we've got to enter into maturity so there had to be a sheep offering that was waved over the people again and so i want to say this in our understanding william branham's ministry was not a ministry that was based on him reading the bible his ministry was based on the sole fact that he had to fulfill prophecy and not the prophecy of malachi 4 5. that's just the description of his office not the prophecy of revelations i believe it's 3 and 14. again that was the description of the office it wasn't the fulfillment as we would think of the scripture in revelations 10 7. that was all the prophecies concerning the ministry but when he fulfilled all those prophecies that described the person amen that this person would come he would be a prophet he would be a messenger and his duty was to reveal the mysteries that were contained in the word but can you say then okay if that was him what was his ministry his ministry started with a pillar of fire at his birth never read a book never read a bible right his ministry was a whirlwind in a bush all this was his ministry don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way for i have a work to do for you down at the river the ohio river your ministry shall forerun the second coming of christ so what he was and what he was doing he wasn't fulfilling malachi 4 5 yes he was but it wasn't the fulfilling of malachi 4 5 that we rest in it's the work that malachi 4 5 was going to do that we rest in we don't rest in the fact that he was the messenger to the lady osean church age but we rest in the fact he said if you will open up i'll come and sup with you we don't rest in the fact that he was to open the seals but when we look we understand that his ministry though it fulfilled all the prophets and what was prophesied of him it was something that was waived over us the whole ministry from beginning to end was waved over the people in this day put before same signs and wonders same ministry that jesus had why because it was the sheep wave offering that stimulated the revelation that we too could come into this maturity it's our hope it's because we saw that and experienced that that i believe there's something in me that can overcome me hallelujah all the battle wounds all the scars all the heartaches all the fears he said it to take you from being a coward it was the chief offering that's what this ministry was if we just could go back in our book real quick to paragraph 90. i was going to play a little portion of tape i'll play that 10 minutes tonight right before communion go back to the paragraph uh 90. and why isn't the sun i'm sure they can find it and today he's talking about the chief offering first one that came up from that he says nine paragraph nine and today he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people the first one although he had been typed in many times as we'll see later he was a type but this was really the first fruit of them that slapped and it was waved over the promised seed that had the had promise of life he was waived at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a a waving mighty wind now that wave then is not the maturity that we're coming to that's right now it's it's a greater maturity now don't look at yourself because it's not in your thinking the kingdom of god was placed inside of you that you can neither understand the beginning of the end why we look at one another and we see failure he looks at it he sees the blood he sees the purchase he sees your name on the book he's a my peace he has waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and is to be waived and to be waived again we realize in the last days according to luke 17 30. so it wasn't luke 17 30 that was fulfilled it was the waving over the people that was fulfilled what good would it have been if he was luke 17 30 malachi 4 5 revelations 10 7 but there was going to be no effect of that ministry i'm going to hurry he said he says luke 17 30 in the sunday in the day that the son of man will be revealed or waved again over the people so we're just stained yes this is all coming up to what we're talking about it it there had to be something that was mature because god put it in his plan to be waived over the people that they could come to maturity you're fooling yourself if you think you can come to maturity by you reading the bible and coming to your own understanding no how many denominations do we have how many denominations within the denominations i mean how many people after service they all have a mini sermon in the parking lot of court a mini sermon here i'm i'm all for it don't bother me but that's that's all good that's all fellowship but god already knows what he's extracting and he knew the only way he could extract it or bring it into maturity was to wave something that was matured over the people and he had to bring that ministry into maturity so he started it the day he came the pillar of fire showed up he's packing the water voice in the bush he goes out to arizona it's going to be a cowboy and that old guy starts playing that comb adam where art thou william branham i have an image of you in my mind and the image i had was you fulfilling malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. i have a work for you to do i'm going to mold you and make you you don't think he was molded and made lost his wife lost his baby went through the greatest battle he ever went in i can't even i i used to think well i'd want to go through that i want to prove i want to do this i don't know what i would do i would have to do one thing it would have to be the grace of god that kept me so the ministry was what was waived over the people sure the sick were healed how many of those people do you think that were healed back in the early 50s are with us today how many people you think are healed than they still died that's not what he was trying to do is heal these bodies the ministry had come because there was a seed that he wanted to quicken so we understand that that's what his ministry was it was the maturity waved over the believer and then we went through this part of it he began to explain he said it's like an automobile that is perfectly tuned up and it's got gasoline in its tank but it doesn't do any good until there's something that sparks that gasoline that's right and he looked at the church and he said you're setting beautiful in order you have your dresses on you have your hair nice you got your church set in order all these things are there and he said there's been brides and churches and brides and brides and brides we are not the first people that called ourselves the bride go down to waco go over to the homestead you'll see just godly people they feel they're called out they feel their elect but there had to be something come that proved it was gasoline to prove that it was the word and that was a spark he used the type as a spark his ministry the ministry that god committed to william branham through the prophecies of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7 that was the and john 12 that was committed to him to fulfill the ministry but what the ministry was was to bring the spark to the word that was in the tank let me say it again in this form his ministry was to come and germinate the seed that he placed or let me say it another way or to start in motion the extraction of the image that he had in his mind before the world ever begun it was a spark it was the only thing that could bring it into the image that he had no ministry great ministers preach the lord jesus great ministries do great works and good things i enjoy listening to good baptist preachers i enjoy hearing the word of god when it's the word of god i can eat pie i can spit out the seeds but nothing will germinate and spark the beginning of coming into the image of what god had in his mind of you until you're sparked by malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7. you might get all the mechanics right you might be able to explain every scripture in this bible you might be able to go online and look at all these different teachings on this subject and that subject and all those things but let me tell you you will never come into the maturity of god's word until you are sparked by the revelation of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7. amen you say you sure are counting a lot of people out i don't count the people out i count their revelation out i count their wisdom out i have con account their cumulative knowledge out but if you sit back in your heart and you think i have more confidence in this bible then i do what was fulfilled in that ministry you have confidence in your own self you have confidence in your own idea your own teaching and you know you can get it you can get a complica get used to a diet i'm on a new diet now if it tastes good spit it out if it tastes like cardboard you can eat it but you know you can be taught how to read the bible you can come under influences that allow you to go through the word and just bring out the things that you see in it but if it ain't malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 i'm sorry it's wrong amen that's right exactly what the word i was going to say you can take over right now buddy i know you got the inspiration though okay billy said absolute it's the absolute it'll never spark your gas to get you to move and it's the only thing that proves that what's in your tank is gas because if it's water let's go here a little bit let's let's bring this thought in we got too much that's what happens to our music when it's not right it's not moving the car and how many times you think your car sparks when you go down the road one spark it's got a spark i don't know how many does anybody know how many times the car sparks in a minute no mechanics i'll just take your guess a lot thank you a lot right it's got to continually spark pop pop pow pow to get you to move to move to move you don't get one spark you don't get one revelation you don't sit back and say i believe malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. i i believe it i've got gas in my tank i've got my church ordered down i've got the mechanics no that's not what it is this ministry is the spark on the word that moves you all away to the rapture praise god don't look at the negative look at it that he didn't say in in revelations 3 and 14 he didn't say who gets it all right he says he that have ear to hear let him hear what is it that we're hearing it's it's him saying i've come to wave over you the maturity so you can see what a real son of god looks like amen we all have an idea of what jesus was like i always got him to be a big guy prophet god said he was a little guy so all us little guys we take hope all you big guys don't be discouraged he loves big guys too he makes them in all shapes rather than walking don't don't worry you you paid a great price for this kingdom he's not interested in what you think you are he's not interested in what place you've got yourself into he's only interested in one thing and that's to bring his word to pass the only thing he's interested in is an extracting out of you you know what extract means right to pull out just like the sun pulls the seed out is what he had in his mind in the beginning that's in you that's what he's trying to bring you say how can i move into that there's got to be the spark it can't be a secondhand spark how many knows what a second hand spark is that's when your car's dead sitting on the side of the road with two wires coming out of the hood that means it's not running on its own and you might fire it up and it'll run awhile and then you'll find yourself dead on the road again needing another revival needing another jump start when you come to the understanding that there's an absolute that there's a sheep offering that's where you're going to get your spark from then when we begin to understand what was fulfilled he says no matter how much theologies claim or how well you got your church see how much education you got how much like the bible until that sheaf wave glory until that chief waves waves over you you don't even know where you're going you don't even know what image you're to become in you say brother mclaren it sure sounds to me like you're following the man just read what paul said he said be ye followers of wow how could he say that because he meant the spark amen he had the sheath wave waved over him it didn't matter where he was it didn't matter what he was doing but when that pillar of fire came ken was waved over him in the fulfillment of the word of god amen there he was blind i think that's the first thing that we've got to do to move forward is get blind blinded to the things of the world bind into the teachings of the world blind to the influences of all of these guys and and everything come steadfast i'm not against reading in fact i used to have a lot of the books great inspired book sister ellen gave a lot of them to me of the early church warriors and what those guys went through and what their sacrifice was smith wigglesworth and and them great vibes and the revival methodist revival coming out charles finley some of those guys are you see what they put into the gospel but they couldn't go no higher because the sheath wave the sheaf wave was the separation malachi 4 5 the ministry of malachi 4 5. jesus christ veiling himself in a man called william branham was the test it was the maturity and only those that recognized it were going to come to that maturity that we're going to listen to the spark that was going to spark the word in them and keep them moving into the rapture and that was just the preliminaries of what that i was going to preach and we were going to start at paragraph 40 because now we he's going to go into how far back do we go and what the abstract is how far is god taking you back the abstract takes it all the way back to the beginning of the property those people that went in oklahoma they had steaks and when they found a piece of ground they wanted they drove stakes and then they went and surveyed it and that became the abstract because that's when it was originally brought into existence as a claimed piece of property when were you brought into existence to be a claimed piece of property before the foundations of the world where does your authority go back to it's not voted in glory hallelujah it's not earned why is it mine why do i have the abstract because i was created in his mind in the beginning that's how far back my claim goes and satan's taken a lot of it away from me my courage my power my works but praise god there was a wave offering that came and said this is yours and now there's a spark that doesn't make us cowards anymore it makes us create just just say satan shut up it's mine well how far back does it go you're saying can only take you he can only take you he can only take me back to october 27 1949. all the farther he can bring me back and he can show me everything from then till now praise god but now somebody come with the abstract and they said no you were with me i don't want to stop but i'm going to i promise you i'm good that's why he said when he raised up you raised up with him are you looking for a resurrection you already have a resurrection you are already resurrected you are already sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus but if you look at yourself and you look at the mirror you won't get the courage to go take what's yours but if you left the revelation that's contained in the seven seals sparked you it'll start to bring to life the image that god had of you and you'll start taking steps what do we say preached on a million times step is possession you shall possess the gates of your enemy every doorway that he came into your life every scar every complex every sin every mistake you'll start claiming it back until you drive them outside of your gates how's that gonna happen he sent a spark that's part's called revelation of the sheaf wave offering and what's contained in it and you this morning and myself this morning as miserable as a wretch that i am i rejoice don't rejoice because you have power over devils he says but rather rejoice because your name is written in heaven this morning i believe god has an individual for us ever he wants to extract as individuals i believe he has an image of what he wants to bring a congregation into what his church is and what his bride is i believe he has all those things in plan and let me say this the quicker time goes and the quicker we get to the appointed end of time the quicker god's going to move to bring his church into perfection so we didn't go much farther in the message this morning but i think if we can just let that set in our mind the only way god could extract the image that he had of you in the beginning was to wave over you the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. the only thing that's going to spark the word gas that's in your tank is that ministry amen you say are you shutting the world out i i don't know about them what is it to you if they tarry until i come but follow me amen follow me and what a privilege this morning to know that you're elect that's right brother matt why you asked matt why heidi married him gotta hear his testimony poor heidi had to go bail matt out of jail it predestinated beautiful all that he foreknew he predestinated and all that he predestinated he sanctified and now all that he predestinated he's going to glorify praise god for his workmanship in christ jesus god bless you brother billy [Applause] amen let's all stand this morning [Music] you deserve the glory and the honor
