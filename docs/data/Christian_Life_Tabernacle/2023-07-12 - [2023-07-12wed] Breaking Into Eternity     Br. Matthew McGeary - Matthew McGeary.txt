Description:
Breaking Into Eternity 
July 19, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas
Br. Matthew McGeary

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Told Me just say the devil is defeated the devil is defeated the devil is defeated and I felt a burden to say that and something told me something would happen after that would happen and some of you may know that I have been going through some stomach issues and I've been believing for my healing and I paused it and I said the devil's defeated and after that I felt something come over me and come

that we can see you Lord standing here the same yesterday today and forever Lord the great prophets of old they're off the scene the great Apostles and disciples have played their part Malachi 4 5 has come foreign you've risen up a bride to be the very expression of your person Lord and Lord forgive us for always one in the blessings wanting you to do everything for us Lord may we do something for you this evening may we just give you our hearts and our life Lord come with true repentance Lord and tell you that we're we're sorry for being so selfish Lord and we want to be more sincere and more humble that takes your presence Lauren your presence that molds us in shapes us Lord because when we're in that place and that Shekinah glory Lord then we can hear from you so Lord we Just Surrender ourselves to you Lord there's there's needs that are here tonight there's some that are in dark depression they're in bondage too addictions but now oh God we're standing in the realm where all things are possible where we don't have to stay that way any longer because you've made a Divine appointment to come by our way this evening so Lord we're looking to that not what man can do Lord your Prophet told us that we must Master the thought of human ability Lord we move away from that whatever and however we thought the service should go or would go now we look to the supernatural and we place ourselves into thy Loving Hands that you would do what only you could do and break the bread of life to your people in Jesus Christ's name we commit ourselves amen amen such just a wonderful presence let's just turn in our Bibles to Leviticus chapter 23. we'll be reading verse 36 and then we'll also turn to Hebrews chapter 4 verse 9. if I'm able to get any more monitor I'll take it Leviticus 23 and verse 36. seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord on the eighth day shall be Unholy convocation unto you and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein and let's just turn to Hebrews chapter 4 read verse 9 through 12. there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen we just asked a blessing upon the word you may be seated just want to read a quote out of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly brine and the prophet of God would say this notice the Eighth Day Jesus raised for our justification the Eternal King with the Eternal Kingdom to be baptized into to eternal life not seven days had nothing to do with any of the days it's speaking of another Eternal coming speaking of an eternal time the world that I'm speaking of and notice after 50 days or seven sabbaths from there again there come another holy convocation what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the seventh day or the Eighth Day rather Eighth Day fell on the eighth day was seventh Sabbath later exactly after his resurrection see it'd be seven times that again bringing it right back around to the first day of the week again exactly see there is your holy convocation not having anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start now now he's speaking to somebody here so start seeing yourself in the word and in the scriptures because the Lord is speaking to you right now he says with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day come on a lot of people will say I was saved this day or that no you weren't you a matter of fact you being saved had nothing to do with what you could do it was something that he did and had already done before you even showed up on the scene you were saved you always saved amen Jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with and I just pray the Lord would help me this evening I want to speak to you tonight on breaking into eternity well I think that's just our heart's desire as Believers we want to break into eternity we want to break out of this flesh we want to break out of this world we want to break out of our ideas and the waves of man and how bound down we are by the ways of thinking in our jobs and and our intellectual understanding of the measures I want to break out and into something you know I was kind of thinking of something as I thought along the way you know when a drug addict really starts to wanting something you know they'll do whatever it takes they'll deceive the doctor they'll deceive their neighbors they'll deceive their family they'll try to deceive everybody they want to but because they want something they got to have something they'll even break into a building they'll break into a store they'll break into their mama's house they'll break into their daddy's house they'll do whatever they want to do because there's something inside of them that is hungering crying out and they know they gotta get something to be able to exchange it for the thing that they're crying out for so they'll break into things I say my if a drug addict can get to a place where they're so addicted to meth or alcohol or or drugs or pills and something like that that they're willing to do all of these things how much more should we be willing to lay down the cares of life and to lay down our jobs and lay down our thoughts lay down our ideas and get to a place where we can sell out Lock Stock and Barrel for the message of the iron and say I want to break into something all that I've never seen before I want to break into the supernatural what I was going to try to stay calm this evening but it just doesn't work for me but breaking into eternity you know eternity is something that's really hard to understand or to describe you know if we were to have the conversation it just sounds uh you can't oh well you know once we get to Eternity what happens after a billion trillion good zillion years well we'll just keep going on but then after a billion trillion a million years more uh will we then know all about God no it'll just keep going on and and so eternity talking about breaking into eternity you know it's just something really hard for us mortal men to really understand what we're talking about as the writer would pin these words concerning Melchizedek he would say that without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually you see Jesus Christ was from eternity to Eternity and there's only one form of eternal life and that eternal life is gone and those Eternal thoughts of God took form in Jesus Christ and now that same eternal life is taking form in a many membered body called The Bride of Jesus Christ as brother Brandon would say like this for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning my what a statement you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning while we just run straight over that quote and say glory to God but oh why don't we stay there a little while and chew on it and really catch what the mind of God is trying to tell you that the way that you showed up in the form that you are now there is something that you possess on the inside of you that is an eternal quality they didn't come from man it didn't come from your mama it didn't come from your daddy but there's something that you are possessing it didn't come when the wild was created but it was back there back in the mind of God you are Eternal and those Eternal thoughts are now taken on flesh in your body for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it time is with men eternity is with God but you see we bypassed our theophany into a Time body but now this great mystery this secret that God had in his mind from the very beginning this threefold purpose that he wanted to express himself in Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then he wanted to have the preeminence in the bride now all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the bride that Eternal form that logos taking on form in you and then what was it to restore the kingdom to go back to Eden again husband and wife to spend eternity together so we just look into our text here and what is a holy convocation in the Old Testament we read these scriptures of levigans 23 3 if you want to put that up there or turn in your Bibles because we were reading there are no text in Levi get US 23 verse 26 maybe it would just walk through this for a second here but Leviticus 23 3 says six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest Unholy convocation you shall do no work therein it is a Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings now we know that the Lord Worked six days and on the seventh day he rested and so as we look into the scriptures we we must realize that everything in the Old Testament is a type and a shadow it it's foretelling something that God was wanting to achieve or that God was wanting to accomplish it's a type it's a shadow it's something that was in the past foreshadowing what was going to come and I was thinking about you know I look back and when I first met my wife and and and you know then we started talking and and oh I I just loved those phone calls and being able to spend time with her on the phone and then you finally be able to travel and see one another but uh but we we had to have the beginning so that we could have what we have now see we can't have what we have now without the beginning but I don't want to trade what I have now for something in the past I don't want to give up what I have now and go back to courting I I don't wanna I don't want to leave what I have now but see we got to look into the scriptures and we got to see the types we got to see the Shadows because many times if we're not built up properly if we're not students of the word you realize that that that that that that Jesus Christ was the fullness of the word the very word was speaking of the Messiah or the word that was going to come and take on form and the whole new testament like it or not has been in a testifying of something that was coming at the end time Malachi 4 5 was a prophetic word saying of something that was going to come at the end time and then when it was time for the physical manifestation it took on form but you couldn't have that without what was the shadow of it without the word speaking out behold I will send you Elijah the prophet there is no Elijah Prophet to come because the word wasn't uttered so then we need to look into the scriptures and be students of the word and understand these things six days shall work be done but the seventh day is a Sabbath arrest a holy convocation what is a holy convocation you shall do no work therein it is a Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings well I think right there maybe we could preach a little while in all your dwellings your car your house your heart right that's where the dwelling is it's in your heart in your life and this Temple don't you know thou has a body prepared for me a holy convocation so you can't have the greater meaning without having what was first so just look into Genesis chapter 1 and verse 14 as as you we're reading about a holy convocation in six days and and we would get this law and everything put in order but to really start to understand those things when you look into the Bible into Genesis 1 14 he would start to speak about how let there be uh lights in the heavens and in the Famine of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years you see God wasn't just creating a beautiful world for no purpose but even in his creation even in the setting of the sun and the setting of the stars and the way that he formed and created everything uh the the the the sun and the moon and the stars they were for signs and they were for seasons and they were for days and they were for years and it would go on and he would say oh let there be two lights of the greater light will rule the day and then the Lesser light will rule the night and then right there you see the very expression of God displaying husband and wife right there in creation oh let the sun and let the moon be a declaration let it be a sign of a union that the moon doesn't give off our own light it only gives off the light of the Sun what are we reflecting in this hour We're Not reflecting man's ideas we're reflecting the very mind a very light the very life oh Christ has come in this generation the greatest light that's ever shown unto man and this bride is now the reflector as the prophet was the great reflector of the word now the veil has been taken away our eyes have come open and we see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and now that word becomes in us and we are now that great reflector in this hour so just continuing on Olivia's 23 in the 14th day thank you brother of the first month that even is the Lord's Passover so we want to know these things it says in the 14th day of the first month at evening is the Lord's Passover and on the 15th day of the same month as the Feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord Seven Days ye must eat unleavened bread so right here it says in the first month well you know where we get the word month from we get it from Moon because a month was a new moon so months means new moon and the Hebrew calendar is a lunar calendar we go by a solstice calendar which is which is depicted by the Sun and therefore we have 365 days in a year but when you go by the lunar calendar you have approximately 359 days in a year 29 and a half days in a month is what they say and it's going by a lunar calendar and then what we think the first of the year is it's not in January but the first of the year is in a bib or it's in Nissan or it's it's in the new moon the first of the year during the springtime and so a new moon if you look at the Hebrew calendar there's 12 moons a year right a new moon there the 12 months in a year if a new moon is a it's a new month if you could just say a new month or new moon now you can start looking in the scriptures and when you see a new moon understand that they were going by the lunar calendar there's 12 new moves sometimes I guess there's 13 moons in a year but I don't I don't get into all that stuff but I just go with with how it's unfolding and you can see 12 moons 12 new moons a month New Moon everybody with me so the first month the new moon so he's given uh uh he's given the word here and saying in the 14th day of the first month Addie is even the Lord's supper and then the following day would be the unleavened bread so you look and you can jump back into Exodus 13 and that's when Moses would call it a b i b I don't know how to say abib however you say that Habib anybody want to help me out on it no takers so but that was April so don't when he says the the first month of the year that's April and and if you look at what it means it means the it means uh The Barley ears it means the ears of of The Barley are now coming to to harvest they're starting to Green so you start to get a picture and an understanding of the signs and the times and and why God put these these uh lights and these uh stars and the moon up there for times and seasons and now he's given his ordinances and you have to know the times and the season to know what the word that's going to be carried out is so now the prophet is telling them look when it's a new moon when it's the first month of the year on the 14th day this is the Commandment of the Lord and so if some of you that want to study that down a little bit it it changed they they now call it Nissan NIS a n or n i s s a n and they've they since the uh Israel was carried away into Babylon that they don't use the Hebrew name for it anymore I kind of thought that profound uh but if you're studying in your Bible and you're into Exodus and you see uh Moses call it a bib then you'll find out later they are carried away into captivity and I believe that's when they started adapting the word uh Nissan so when you go and even study it now if you're wanting to look in and try to find the Hebrew calendar and things you'll you'll find out some of those things but but so you had you in when you start to look through Leviticus now what's starting to happen here is is the prophet is laying out that there's going to be seven fish days and so he starts to lay out the order and the times and the seasons of when these things were to be carried out you're going to have a a Seven Feast Davis you have seven feast days the Passover unleavened bread first fruits Pentecost trumpets atonement Tabernacles all of these feast days these were all prophetic types so when you look into the Bible and you see Moses talking about oh uh it's going to be on the 14th day of the first month you're going to have it's going to be the Passover it's going to be the Feast of the Passover well well what was that for and then on the 15th day it's going to be the Feast of unleavened bread these wasn't just ordinances and works that God was giving to the children of Israel to carry out but they were prophetic they were prophetic ordinances that were giving as a shadow of something that was to come what was the Feast of the Passover it was the Passover Lamb where they came out of Egypt in the month of April and it was testifying of our Passover Lamb the Lord Jesus Christ that would come and pay the penalty for sin so we could be free once and for all who the son of man has made free is free indeed oh by one sacrifice we don't need a man to keep going year after year and offering a sacrifice oh but when this blood has been applied you've been forgiven you have been Justified once and forever it's settled you don't have to grabble back on your knees and do pentates and and woe is me and climb up stairs and get bloody knees and Maya Koopa Maya Koopa I'm such a bad boy I should have never done that in the first place if you're really sincere and you're sorry for what you've done why don't you just repent you can do it right here in this service on that Pew you don't need no Pope you don't need no preacher you don't need no man you got a hotline to the throne of God why don't you say Lord I hear what the preacher is saying and I am sorry for living the way that I'm living now the question is is do you love your addiction and your dope and the way that you're living so much that you'll walk out of the house of God and deny the very Deliverance that's staring you in the face oh this could be your last moment this could be your last time because we're not guaranteed tomorrow but what you're guaranteed is right now don't let the devil beat you up and condemn you it's just been so long I've tried so many times try them out say Lord I'm sorry I heard the word and faith comes by hearing the word and faith is a revelation it's about time I take what God purchased for me I'm a redeemed son and daughter of God I accept the Passover Lamb passing over and then you come to the Feast of unleavened bread man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you can't mix anything with this message I don't want no man's thinking I don't want no man's ideas I don't want your explanation I'm so glad you got to figure it out with all the diagrams and you can take me up the horizontal rainbow and back down but just give it to me straight I just want to hear what the prophet said I want to hear the message of the hour and the Lord Jesus Christ will reveal that word to me in the season when I need it I don't want secondhand Revelation God's given a five-fold Ministry and we preach the word and we are the final voice the church together we are the final voice to this final generation under what under the seventh age messenger we don't have no voice of Our Own I don't want the voice of man I want the voice of God so Feast of unleavened bread we don't mix it with anything and we know that Lavender is a type of sin so we got to get all the sin out we got to be Sanctified oh we're we're pleading the blood we're Justified we're going on the journey now oh let's let's fish on this unleavened bread we got to get all the sin out we got to get Sanctified we don't want to mix anything with it oh let's just separate like Abraham had to separate I got a place that I'm taking you Abraham I'm taking you into eternity I'm taking you into a body change I got promises to fulfill I got a plan for your life Abraham you were with me in the very beginning you are predestinated I got it all mapped out for you but just separate yourself from the things of the world I wonder if some of you want to take that trip oh you've been predestinated the trouble is is we can't separate ourselves from the things of the world we can't separate ourselves from the things that we want we can't separate ourselves from the way that we think sleep should be but oh it's calling for a time of Separation it is a feast of unleavened bread let's get all the sin out let's get all let's get real and consecrated let's go on a journey with God unleavened bread men shall not live by bread alone nothing mixed with it oh got to be Sanctified and then you have the Feast of the firstfruits what was the Feast of the first it was the waving of the Sheaf it was a waving of the Sheaf and we know that Christ was the first fruits of the Resurrection he was the first one that raised from the dead and now what we come to Oh Glory to God we're on a journey now now we come to the Feast of Pentecost and what was the Feast of Pentecost that was where the Holy Ghost fell that's where the promise was fulfilled go tell ye there in Jerusalem and I will send you my comforter he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire I want to get to the Feast of Pentecost the prophet of God said the problem that it is as many of us stopped short he said have you have you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost since you believe I think we need to preach that message more in every message church around the country so many of us believe the message but we've stopped short of a true Born Again experience where the life of God is in tabernacling the individual I don't care if you can quote the prophet if you can go to church camps if you can sit on the church pew but it's the life of the message in you [Applause] and a true son and daughter of God that's predestinated won't stop short until they get it have you received the Holy Ghost that you believe well the reason why you're struggling the reason why you're fighting the things that you're fighting is because there's another another step just keep going so many types laying in the scriptures so now we come to the Feast of Pentecost the Holy Ghost falling down and and now you see the great type of what is showing here from from the feast of the Sabbath there's seven from the Feast of the Passover there's seven sabbaths you're following the order right seven sabbaths there's there's seven days in a week remember here's Moses he's saying in the First new moon the first month on the 14th day it's going to be a feast of Passover now there's going to be seven sabbaths 49 days and then on the 50th day right so there's there's seven sabbaths from the Passover Feast to Pentecost which is a type of the seven Church ages and each Church age had to produce a portion or a part of the word when they saw the light for their day when they had their allotted portion God provided a way for them in that day that word was their rest that was what brought the faith for them to be an overcomer in the age that they were living in right Jesus said come unto me all you who are heavy-layed and I will give you rest that wasn't just for one age that was for every age the first age the second age the third fourth fifth sixth and seventh he said come unto me all year heavy laden and I will give you rest there is a rash for the people of God the problem is is some of us ain't Rushton you're fighting you're you're anguishing you're you're tormented you're struggling you don't have to live like that any longer there is a rash for the people of God now the prophet would say this in the Patmos Vision he goes let's see what the Bible teaches us about a Sabbath rest for he is for he that is entered into his rest this entering in is not only an entering in but a remaining in the rest it is an eternal rest of which the seventh day is but a type seven is completion eight is the first day again Jesus resurrection was in the first day of the week giving us eternal life and eternal Sabbath rest thus we see why God could not give us any one certain day of the week as a Sabbath rest we've entered into and do remain in our rest which Israel could not do having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy why go back to a shadow when we have reality now come on Church why go back to a shadow when we have real I don't want a shadow I want real substance I don't want to go back to a shadow but some of us have gone back to a shadow you've experienced the goodness of God you've experienced the grace of God you know what it's like to be free you know what it's like to sing for him you know what it's like to have the Zeal and the joy but I wonder what has happened have you traded reality for a shadow have you walked out of his presence there is a rash why aren't you resting his resting place didn't change same place where is it where is it it's in his word where does faith rest in his word where's God's provided place at the end time in his word why would we want a shadow why would we live in a shadow why would we live below our privileges with us because we've allowed that devil to sneak his way back into our lives the little foxes that spoil the vine and you find out that you are once on fire for God and now the devil got you so condemned you're living in a state of the prayer come Lord children of God loose yourselves you don't have to live like that any longer you are predestinated I'll take a little more monitor why would we live like that why would we take a shadow when we have reality we're seeing what the reality of this message looks like by faith we listen to it by faith we see it we see the effects and how it molds a man how it changes on the humility the sincerity the character the transparency the honesty not to be puffed up not to be recognized not to say look at me look at what I've done but only to bring the father Glory for this is your purpose here on Earth that if you abide in him I am the vine ye are the branches and if you bear much fruit that's his desire and when you do that the father's glorified but we're just living in a shadow we're just trying to hang on for dear life come on Lord bring me into the reality of this word the message of the hour is your reality the word of God is your reality everything outside of the word is death it is not your reality when Satan sold his lives lives to Eve that was not the reality that God had given to his children it was a fake reality void of Life only bringing forth death temporary sin will take you further than you want to go second Peter 1 11 would say for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the opening of the word is an entrance God's provided way at the end time is a reality to enter into that Eighth Day into that rest into the Rapture into the resurrection by the word and entrance something has been opened up to you you didn't know anything about it but you're predestinated this threefold mystery purpose you come from eternity you always had eternal life but you didn't know anything about it oh I'm getting excited now to enter into his rest you cease from your own works no more how is that liveth but Christ that liveth in me Paul would say it like this in Romans 9. for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy now I make it a point here because when you've entered into his rest you cease from your own works and Paul would say this in Romans 9 15 he said for saith Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy did you see any pre-qualification there was there any pre-qualifier that I will have mercy if you fill out this application go ahead and write down your 20 worst sins and I'll put you through the application process and I'll see if you can be a saint that can sit on my panel and judge the Earth now it says I that's why every that's why religious Spirits get so upset that's why those Sadducees and Pharisees hated Jesus Christ because it was without works he had compassion on whom he would have compassion he healed the blind he healed the sick not because of their good works because he wanted to and they hated him for it what what does this guy did you ain't of our our church you ain't of our group I think the bride of Christ needs to get that Spirit off of us somebody come say man I was healed at Benny Hinn's meeting yeah hey I I know what I'm talking about because I've done it I realized I was seating in the seat of the scornful and because somebody didn't get for something from God from my way of thinking I was like well I wonder if that was really God no you should rejoice that's my God my God's A Healer my God's a savior he'll have mercy on whom he'll have mercy and compassion on whom he'll have compassion he is God so it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth the race the fastest and do all the works and puts all his pennies in the Salvation Army and builds a million churches and feeds all the people in Ethiopia and does everything and passes out the most tracks oh man I thought I was gonna work my way into this thing nope nope it's not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of God that showeth Mercy oh if that don't start the joy Bell's ringing how do we even realize what we've come in contact I don't think we have we we don't even realize what we're feeding on what we've really come in contact with what has really been opened up to us that we are breaking into eternity where the whole world is bound by a God of this evil age but something has come to the elect of the hour to break us out of here Hallelujah the mercy of God not anything you did not any work you could do but because he said I have mercy on you I'll have compassion on you I'll predestinate you I'll reveal my word to you I'll put something in you that won't be satisfied with anything else but my word oh thank you Lord you couldn't stop short you couldn't quit because there's only one thing that will fill that hunger and that thirst for righteousness and that is the revealed word of the hour foreign predestinated y'all want to see a mystery how many wants to see a mystery you wanna see a mystery y'all want to see a mystery turn around look go ahead look look back there y'all want to see y'all look look up here see you see these young sisters on the front row these brothers y'all are looking at a mystery this whole church is filled with a mystery what was Christ Christ was the mystery of God revealed then what is the bride the bride is the mystery of Christ you were in him and now you are expressed in this physical manifestation and this time oh my God hallowed not because you could not because you could run but because God loved you because God had mercy upon you because God predestinated you because God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world predestinated so what are you scared about what are you worried about you're all you're all worried about how you're going to pay the bills are you kidding me think about how this looks in God's eyes we're worried about how we're going to pay rent and you know it's I understand when there's a genuine concern if you can but if my wife came to me and said honey can I buy a bag of peanuts well when we first got married she was getting the hang of things but after you've you get to know one another my wife knows she don't have to ask me if she can buy a bag of peanuts honey you can have a bag of peanuts you don't have to ask me but if she came to me and said honey I would like to buy a bag of peanuts well how much are they it's two dollars yeah honey go ahead do we have enough money why I could check let me let me hold on real quick let me let me look in here real quick yeah yeah oh yeah yeah we got enough money go ahead and buy them a bag of peanuts are you sure but I I don't know if we make enough money you know we treat God like that sometimes here we're all worried about how we're gonna pay rent for a house and he's the one that gave you the house right I mean look at how far you've come and where God's brought you to what are you afraid of what are you scared about we're talking about breaking into eternity it's it's a thing it's a thinking it's a process it's a way that you you process what you're looking at it's a way of thinking you don't have to look at that and and wonder if you can you just look at and say how is God going to oh you don't have to wonder and fear how am I going to be delivered you say I am already delivered and now I'm looking at the way how God is going to bring forth the manifestation of my healing you don't have to worry you don't have to fear I don't care how long you've been sick I don't care how long you've been struggling the answer is already on its way because you're married to the bridegroom he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he's already provided for you what are you worried about what are you scared about it's time to break into eternity Church that's where we're going you know that's a mind look Jesus Christ came from eternity he was going back to Eternity when even pilate said why don't you say why don't you he said look at my kingdom was from here they'd fight for me he didn't get caught up in the situation if you want to talk about a situation because he only did what the father showed him his mind was not with man his mind was the mind of God and we got to get to a place where we stop processing all of our decisions by our five senses and we step into the sixth sense of Faith which is a revelation of the word and the mind of God for the hour that we're living in and now we let that mind be within us to know that God is doing something God is doing something in your life God is doing something in your life God is doing something I don't care if you're in the trial if you're in the valley if you're in the lowest portion you've ever been in your life it's time that Faith recognizes that you are a true son and a true daughter of God and now you know that you're coming into your position let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus it's time to break through time to break in you know what that means to me time to get rid of this flesh time to get rid of this thinking complexes time for them to go bondage time to go depression time to go worrying time to go anxiety time to go oh this this Spirit of anxiety look you don't have to live under that anxiety anymore you don't have to keep taking those pills you can be delivered we're breaking out of this thing man we're breaking into an intelligence we're breaking into where this mind that was in Christ Jesus is also all in you who thought it not robbery to be equal with God we're talking about being redeemed being brought back to where you were in the beginning uh don't you realize there was an intelligence there you you were with him in the beginning you are part of that intelligence but you got spiritual Amnesia the shock of sin you can't remember where you came from and now the word has come and now the spiritual Amnesia is starting to fade away and you're starting to realize what you always were in him at the beginning oh that's exciting it ain't something that I got to do I just gotta drink and push out drink and push out drink and push out just keep feeding just keep me just drink and push out because I've ceased from my own works this opening quote he said there is your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved amen Jesus come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning oh Hallelujah now here we go and I'm I'm just going to invite the musicians because if I turn this corner we're in trouble what is a holy convocation I meant that
