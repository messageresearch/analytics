[35:15] precious
[35:17] time
[35:28] wonderful and foreign
[35:35] let's turn over to Genesis the 15th
[35:39] chapter
[35:41] you know Annie Joy I felt bad I didn't
[35:43] have you come up and have your picture
[35:45] taken with everybody
[35:48] I'll make it up to you
[35:50] I'll have a special photo session just
[35:52] for you
[35:54] anyway let's turn to this scripture I
[35:57] thought it was wonderful I enjoyed
[35:59] having sister Eleanor with us and at the
[36:03] dedication today that was wonderful
[36:05] uh I like to read this little scripture
[36:07] just make a few comments
[36:10] this evening and read a statement
[36:14] to us to encourage our hearts and to
[36:18] kind of build along the line that uh we
[36:22] were speaking of this morning so in the
[36:26] 15th chapter of Genesis
[36:29] uh
[36:32] uh these words are spoken and this is
[36:36] the 13th verse of the 15th chapter
[36:40] it says and he said unto Abram
[36:45] okay we'll start with the 12th verse and
[36:47] when the sun was gone down a deep sleep
[36:51] fell upon Abram and lo a horror of great
[36:55] Darkness fell upon him
[36:58] and he and he said unto Abram no
[37:02] absuredly that thy seed shall be a
[37:07] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[37:12] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[37:16] afflict them 400 years
[37:20] so also
[37:22] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[37:26] Serve will I judge
[37:28] and afterward they shall come out with
[37:32] great substance Heavenly Father we ask
[37:36] you to place your word in your precious
[37:38] name we pray amen God bless you may be
[37:42] seated
[37:49] you know that's uh that's a tremendous
[37:52] prophecy
[37:54] there that the Lord spoke to Abraham and
[37:58] and telling Abraham that
[38:01] that thy seed he and you look at all the
[38:05] great uh things that he's talked he
[38:07] walked with Abraham he gave Abraham a
[38:10] promise Abraham didn't have the son
[38:13] then God's going to give them a son and
[38:16] then he says thy seed they're going to
[38:18] be in us a foreign land a land that's
[38:23] not theirs and they're going to be
[38:24] afflicted for 400 years
[38:27] and they're they're going to be brought
[38:29] and they're gonna I'm gonna judge that
[38:32] nation and they're going to come out
[38:33] with great substance
[38:36] and I I just thought in my heart and I
[38:39] don't know how to express this I don't
[38:40] want to take long because of communion
[38:43] but
[38:45] God makes a prophecy
[38:48] and yet
[38:50] that prophecy is fulfilled by human
[38:53] beings
[38:55] God's word
[38:57] has got to become flesh in order for it
[39:01] to manifest no no prophecy or no promise
[39:06] can set in space and you look at this
[39:10] great prophecy he said that another
[39:13] place he spoke about him being delivered
[39:15] by a mighty hand and and so you look at
[39:18] all the things that had to fall in place
[39:21] for this prophecy to be fulfilled first
[39:25] of all they had they had to go into
[39:28] Egypt and out of Egypt and there had to
[39:32] rise up a pharaoh that didn't know each
[39:35] one of those people are playing their
[39:37] part in the Fulfillment of this prophecy
[39:40] so here's a prophecy that's been spoken
[39:43] now in order for that prophecy to come
[39:47] to pass because God can't lie
[39:51] that there's got to be there's got to be
[39:54] players if I could use that term there's
[39:57] got to be uh people that are are called
[40:01] and positioned and placed circumstances
[40:05] have to arise this prophecy absolutely
[40:09] set the course of history
[40:12] all history now concerning the children
[40:15] of Israel and and concerning uh uh
[40:20] Abraham's seed has all been now a course
[40:23] has all been set and in order for this
[40:27] course to be set if everything had to
[40:30] fall into place everything had to fall
[40:33] into line a lot of times we think that
[40:36] we're just drifting and that that we're
[40:39] just going through life and
[40:42] all the things that are happening that
[40:46] are going on and happening around us now
[40:49] are are not uh
[40:52] uh are are just without a form they're
[40:56] without void they're not making any
[40:58] sense there's lawlessness everywhere
[41:01] there's there there's a crazy thinking
[41:04] on every hand fellowshipping with the
[41:06] brother at lunch today he said
[41:10] he said the greatest thing that
[41:12] everybody's talking about
[41:14] in Europe the brother is from the
[41:17] Netherlands and he was saying that the
[41:19] big conversation all through Europe is
[41:22] now gender identity
[41:25] and and they teach it in the schools and
[41:28] and uh uh a gender X and it's uh for
[41:32] those that are don't want to identify
[41:35] with one or the other and you think all
[41:38] this is is is is uh uh
[41:42] uh what what's going on we ask ourselves
[41:45] what's happening he said my daughter 11
[41:48] year old daughter came home from school
[41:50] and she said Mama how do I choose
[41:54] between being a boy or a girl
[41:58] how do I make this choice and he's
[42:01] sitting back he says
[42:03] well how did you have that question
[42:08] now so you you know that we're that
[42:11] we're in some of the strangest times
[42:13] that we ever had but you understand that
[42:17] that the reason that we're in these
[42:20] times because he said as it was in the
[42:23] days of Sodom and it was in the days of
[42:26] Gomorrah so shall it be in the revealing
[42:29] of the son of man
[42:33] you understand a lot of he he didn't
[42:36] okay it's it's not necessarily the
[42:39] coming you know what I mean but the
[42:42] revealing of them we're in the day that
[42:45] the ministry of the son of man and the
[42:48] word that was spoken through the prophet
[42:51] messenger is being revealed but the
[42:54] condition is here because it was
[42:57] prophesied to be here
[43:00] as it was in the days of Noah and we
[43:04] know that the scripture says they were
[43:06] married and given into marriage they
[43:09] went to and fro they traveled they did
[43:11] those prophecies are all here and we
[43:13] find ourselves in the prophetic
[43:17] condition that's prophesied
[43:21] and and so you you sit back and you go
[43:25] back it in Genesis and we find out that
[43:28] everything that was prophesied in every
[43:31] seed that was sown in Genesis they were
[43:34] they were first sown in Genesis
[43:37] it's okay all the seeds that were sowing
[43:40] in Genesis we find out through the ages
[43:43] they've all come to fruition they've all
[43:46] they've all blossomed and now they're
[43:49] we're sitting in the day that we're in
[43:52] the hour of all the manifestation of
[43:55] these things taking form
[43:58] so nothing's out of kilter
[44:02] everything has to be a just perfect
[44:06] according to God's word so we find out
[44:09] that out of this prophecy
[44:13] many scriptures were fulfilled
[44:16] because the word of God says that I'll
[44:18] send you a prophet like an unto Moses
[44:22] and so Moses had to come up we know he
[44:26] was the type so how are the children are
[44:28] going to come out of bondage
[44:31] out of Affliction and come out with
[44:34] great substance how is God going to
[44:37] bring this to pass
[44:40] that he's going to bring this fast with
[44:42] one he's got to have a proper child born
[44:45] he's got to have a deliverer born
[44:47] because he's got to have someone that's
[44:50] going to go there and deliver them with
[44:52] a mighty hand so that prophecy now has
[44:56] got to take on a form of Flesh somebody
[44:58] has to rise up
[45:01] and and be brought on the scene in order
[45:05] for this prophecy to live through their
[45:09] their being and become manifested and
[45:12] made known
[45:14] this if this if this never took form
[45:19] it would have never been fulfilled it
[45:22] can only when it takes form
[45:25] becomes flesh and is lived out that's
[45:29] when it's fulfilled
[45:30] it's okay it wasn't it the prophecy how
[45:33] are they going to come out with much
[45:35] substance
[45:37] I think that's amazing they they be
[45:42] pillaged Egypt
[45:44] I mean they they they borrowed money
[45:48] that they had no intention of paying
[45:51] back
[45:53] they did they took everything they took
[45:59] plants seeds uh trees everything I love
[46:03] the movie The Ten Commandments when they
[46:05] start coming out their camels are packed
[46:08] though they didn't have anything but
[46:11] they left just exactly the way this
[46:13] scripture said it would be for the
[46:17] conditions were right God created the
[46:19] conditions he had to raise up for Moses
[46:22] he had to do great signs and great
[46:24] wonders because they were going to come
[46:26] out by a mighty hand with Great Signs
[46:29] and great ones there had to be one that
[46:32] rised up that would be a type of the
[46:34] Savior so everything in its place
[46:38] everything has to come in its position
[46:41] everything has to come in its order
[46:43] because God uses man to fulfill his
[46:49] prophecy
[46:50] somebody has to come down to fulfill
[46:53] that great prophecy and the conditions
[46:56] had to be there to fulfill this prophecy
[47:00] we realize there's a prophecy that says
[47:03] this eve will not be like the last Eve
[47:07] this eve won't fall but so but she's got
[47:11] to be in Eden
[47:14] she's got to be faced with the Devil
[47:18] she's got to be faced with science in
[47:21] education she she was faced with the
[47:24] tree of knowledge and but we know the
[47:27] doctrine of serpent seed it wasn't no
[47:29] apple
[47:30] another word Satan was offering him his
[47:34] science his wisdom what he knew about
[47:37] the order of man what he knew about
[47:40] things that's what he was going to
[47:42] educate her
[47:44] God didn't need education because God
[47:47] was going to do everything by his word
[47:49] but Satan wanted that he wanted to have
[47:52] a the uh dominance he wanted to have a
[47:56] kingdom he wanted to have it Eden and he
[48:00] wanted to Reign and he wanted to sit on
[48:02] the throne and take the place of the
[48:04] stars of God all those things were
[48:07] prophesied
[48:09] now we find ourselves
[48:11] in the condition
[48:13] because God had to have an Eden
[48:17] condition
[48:19] in order to have
[48:21] a true bride
[48:24] now who's God using to fulfill that look
[48:27] down through scripture look at the
[48:29] scripture that says uh
[48:31] a virgin shall conceive
[48:36] well that's a great prophecy
[48:39] a virgin shall conceive
[48:42] there had to be a Mary
[48:45] there had to be somebody
[48:47] that came along
[48:50] that was in flesh
[48:52] that was a a virgin
[48:55] that was going to conceive that prophecy
[48:59] had to be fulfilled through a person
[49:03] that prophecy had to be made manifest
[49:08] through flesh look at another great
[49:11] scripture I like this one let's look at
[49:13] Ephesians 5 and
[49:15] and uh
[49:20] Ephesians 5 and 27.
[49:34] here it comes there it is
[49:46] Ephesians 5 and 7.
[49:49] or are we let's go just go up a couple
[49:52] verses let's get 24. therefore as the
[49:56] church is subject unto Christ
[49:59] so let the wife be to her own husband in
[50:03] everything husband love your wives even
[50:06] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[50:09] himself for it that he might sanctify
[50:12] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[50:16] Water by the word we even heard this
[50:20] morning that we Clinton so he's going to
[50:22] have a church without spot or without
[50:25] wrinkle he's going to wash that church
[50:28] with the with the cleansing of his word
[50:32] so there's got to be somebody
[50:35] a person you understand somewhere some
[50:40] human being some recipient
[50:43] of This Promise in order for that to be
[50:47] made manifest there's somebody that's
[50:49] going to be washed and cleansed by the
[50:52] washing of the water of the word there's
[50:54] got to be somebody that's there for that
[50:57] to happen to
[51:00] you so there's there's nothing that's
[51:03] spoken without there being a recipient
[51:06] on the other end to receive that promise
[51:10] and make that promise come real so we
[51:14] find out that God has got to use the
[51:17] believer in order to make the word come
[51:21] to pass he always uses Believers to make
[51:25] his word come to pass you say why are
[51:28] you sitting here
[51:31] because he said he would have a bride
[51:34] without Spa without wrinkle without
[51:37] blemish
[51:39] he said he would have a called out
[51:42] people
[51:43] a chosen people a separated people so
[51:47] there's got to be somebody that's called
[51:50] out
[51:51] there's got to be somebody that's been
[51:53] separated there's got to be somebody
[51:56] that was forgiven
[52:00] no
[52:01] I'm gonna put mines out there
[52:04] I'm going to write my name in that spot
[52:09] I'm not going to just let it go to
[52:11] anybody else or whosoever will I'm going
[52:14] to lay claim on it because if it's got
[52:17] to be it's got to be made flesh it's got
[52:20] to be real it's got to be for somebody
[52:22] why don't I step up and say that's for
[52:26] me I'm the one that's been elected
[52:29] to fulfill this
[52:34] you say well how do you know you're
[52:37] elected because I heard it
[52:41] you have an ear to hear Let Him hear
[52:44] Behold thy stand at the door knob anyone
[52:48] that opens up I'll come in and sup that
[52:51] that's somebody somebody in this last
[52:54] day is going to sit down and eat the
[52:57] evening meal with them
[52:58] [Applause]
[53:03] who's gonna I'm in it open
[53:06] I'm going to put myself there okay I'm
[53:09] going to look out and see I'm in the
[53:13] time of the Fulfillment of the prophecy
[53:20] it's the time
[53:22] that there's going to be a people
[53:25] without spot without wrinkle without
[53:28] blemish there's a Time
[53:31] there's going to be a people that have
[53:33] been ear to hear
[53:34] there's going to be a time that he's
[53:36] going to knock
[53:38] and be on the outside of the church you
[53:41] say how do I know I see it
[53:44] I see him on the outside of the church
[53:48] I see the Sodom condition
[53:50] I see that as it was in the days of Noah
[53:54] I see the great falling away I seen
[53:57] man's Hearts being sheared with the hot
[54:00] iron I see those things I see those
[54:03] things those things are made known for
[54:04] me but they're not made known for me to
[54:07] for me to uh acknowledge
[54:11] they're making their landmarks to me
[54:14] they're signs to me they're they're
[54:17] they're they're warnings to me it lets
[54:20] me know wait a minute what other things
[54:22] are supposed to happen in this age
[54:24] there's supposed to be a called out
[54:26] people
[54:27] for my name's sake
[54:30] I hear that
[54:31] who is that that's me
[54:35] that's me
[54:37] you say well I'll title this sermon
[54:40] that's me I'm the one he spoke of I'm
[54:43] the one that's receiving this promise
[54:45] who's that promise for it's for me who's
[54:48] that word for it's for me who's going to
[54:51] step up and live this life it's for me
[54:53] let's just read a few more verses he
[54:56] says
[54:59] he says
[55:01] he that might sanctify it and cleanse it
[55:04] with the washing of his word that he
[55:06] might present it to him
[55:09] present to himself
[55:12] a glorious church not having spot or
[55:16] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[55:20] should be holy and without blemish
[55:24] who's that
[55:27] who is that
[55:29] it's me
[55:31] it's you
[55:33] I never you you say I I hear this
[55:38] I see this I recognize this well we know
[55:42] that it's hid
[55:44] from the eyes of the wise and proven
[55:47] and revealed unto babes such it would
[55:50] learn
[55:51] so when you see those things
[55:54] you've got to understand that's part of
[55:57] of what goes with your election
[56:00] you're elected to hear
[56:03] you're elected to see you're elected to
[56:07] receive the Revelation nobody else
[56:10] notices it
[56:13] I mean if there's actually people you
[56:16] you that you talk to and that they say
[56:21] oh you know everybody's talking about
[56:23] inclusion let's let's include everybody
[56:28] God never includes everybody
[56:31] all right
[56:32] I I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about
[56:36] inclusion I'm talking about separation
[56:40] he didn't say he was going to save
[56:42] everybody he said he was going to
[56:44] neglect the people he's going to call
[56:46] out to people he's going to separate a
[56:49] people
[56:50] he was going to have a people for his
[56:53] namesake call out a people for his name
[56:56] say it's not we don't change our
[56:59] attitude towards anybody because a love
[57:02] of God is shed apart in our heart by the
[57:04] Holy Spirit but we recognize that we've
[57:07] been marked and identified as different
[57:12] can't help it
[57:16] because I'm the recipient
[57:20] it's me he called out it's me Mary had
[57:24] to come to the place he said a virgin
[57:26] shall conceive
[57:29] and when the angel appeared under her he
[57:32] says she she she wondered she says how
[57:35] is it going to be I know not man he he
[57:39] says the the spirit of God is going to
[57:41] move upon you what is going to conceive
[57:43] to you is going to be of the Holy Spirit
[57:45] she said let it be done unto me
[57:48] according to your will let it be me
[57:53] another she was saying it's me Lord
[57:56] I'm the one that's going to receive this
[57:58] you called me you said every I'm I'm
[58:01] willing to take my position I'm willing
[58:04] to take my place it's me
[58:06] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna walk in the
[58:10] Realms of the uh of the man's thinking
[58:13] I'm not going to get be given over to to
[58:17] what the trend of the day is what the
[58:19] popular thing is I realize that you're
[58:22] going to have uh you've got you're going
[58:25] to have a bride an elect lady without
[58:28] spot or wrinkle and I meant that's what
[58:31] I hear that's what I'm going to identify
[58:34] this is me this is my calling this is my
[58:38] election by by his calling and by his
[58:42] election I'm the flesh
[58:44] that this promised word is going to be
[58:48] manifested in
[58:55] and let me say this and I hope
[58:57] my words can
[58:59] get across what I'm saying it is not
[59:02] going to be fulfilled apart from you
[59:10] it is not a philosophy
[59:14] it is not a idea
[59:19] like like a a political idea or a or a
[59:25] thought
[59:27] where people take on a certain thought
[59:29] or that's a philosophy or a certain
[59:33] method it's not a thought
[59:36] it's not a method it's it's not a way a
[59:41] lifestyle
[59:43] it's not a Christian lifestyle it is
[59:47] actually a substance faith is a
[59:50] substance it's the evidence I'm the
[59:54] evidence
[59:55] foreign
[59:58] it's not an idea it's it's manifested
[1:00:02] flesh
[1:00:04] who is it it's me
[1:00:07] it's me
[1:00:11] I mean that song Our Sister Heather used
[1:00:14] to sing I'm she
[1:00:18] it's me it's it's not something it's not
[1:00:21] an idea it's not a trend it's actually
[1:00:24] real
[1:00:25] human
[1:00:27] people that have accepted the word and
[1:00:30] it's manifested and they actually become
[1:00:33] that word made flesh
[1:00:37] the conditions right for it the hour of
[1:00:40] Prophecy is right for it it's been
[1:00:42] spoken and it it takes to be manifested
[1:00:46] and remember every time that God does a
[1:00:50] great move it's in the it's in the
[1:00:52] Realms of deep dark and unbelief
[1:00:59] when Noah built his
[1:01:01] Ark
[1:01:03] it was in a great time of unbelief
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:12] you know when when he
[1:01:15] went in the days of Sodom
[1:01:19] it was a great time
[1:01:22] of unbelief
[1:01:24] when they were called out in the great
[1:01:26] time of unbelief Lord
[1:01:29] being called out in a great dark time of
[1:01:34] unbelief and and you're called out
[1:01:37] in a great dark time the darkness and
[1:01:41] the unbelief is prophesied
[1:01:45] to be here
[1:01:47] in other words he he in order to have
[1:01:50] you stand out as different as you to
[1:01:54] stand out in order for you to be a true
[1:01:56] manifestation of the light there had to
[1:02:00] be a darkness and we know it's a time
[1:02:02] that's neither dark nor cold it's
[1:02:05] lukewarm and it's the most deceptive age
[1:02:08] that there's ever been so the darkness
[1:02:11] is actually appearing in the form of an
[1:02:15] angel of Light
[1:02:17] that's how deceptive it is the darkness
[1:02:21] itself and the evil itself is appearing
[1:02:24] in a Pale Horse a an angel of Light uh
[1:02:29] it looks like Mankind's doing good it
[1:02:32] looks like they're trying to reach out
[1:02:34] to everybody include everybody not let
[1:02:37] anybody feel ever say ever so uh uh
[1:02:41] different in everything it appears to be
[1:02:44] good but it's darkness and the scripture
[1:02:47] says that God had given them over to a
[1:02:49] reprobate mind because they no longer
[1:02:52] wish to hold God into their thinking and
[1:02:55] that's what's happened to our country
[1:02:58] amen they don't want to have they don't
[1:03:01] want God in the picture anymore
[1:03:05] but someone's going to stand up
[1:03:08] someone's going to believe
[1:03:10] someone's going to say what's right in
[1:03:14] the face there's somebody that's elected
[1:03:16] to do that
[1:03:20] and are you gonna join me and say it's
[1:03:23] me
[1:03:23] it's me
[1:03:26] I'm going to stand for what's right I'm
[1:03:29] going to stand I've heard the voice I've
[1:03:31] heard the shout I've heard the Trump I
[1:03:35] know the coming of the Lord is at hand I
[1:03:37] know now the wedding supper is going on
[1:03:40] the that were that the marriage is
[1:03:43] taking place there's an invisible Union
[1:03:46] happening between between his elect lady
[1:03:49] that individual men and women are
[1:03:53] entering into a union with the revealed
[1:03:55] word of God for the hour they're
[1:03:57] becoming one with it they're putting all
[1:04:00] their stake on it the even though the
[1:04:03] world's crying out oh you're falling
[1:04:05] occult you're lost it's going to cause
[1:04:08] you trouble they're willing to say Lord
[1:04:11] I've I've anchored everything that I am
[1:04:14] in this word because it speaks to me
[1:04:17] it's me I'm that word made flesh
[1:04:24] it's a communion
[1:04:28] like that it's a relationship it's it's
[1:04:33] it it it it comes down to that it's no
[1:04:36] longer
[1:04:38] it's no longer something that can play
[1:04:40] around in your mind
[1:04:45] it's got to drop from your mind into
[1:04:47] your heart
[1:04:48] and from into your heart into your flesh
[1:04:55] that faith
[1:04:57] that revelation
[1:05:00] has got to take on substance
[1:05:03] and the substance
[1:05:05] is the flesh
[1:05:08] is the word made flesh you say where's
[1:05:12] the substance of the message somebody
[1:05:14] show me the message
[1:05:17] somebody show me what's the message show
[1:05:20] me the message
[1:05:22] I don't say well brother Branham taught
[1:05:25] this brother Branham taught that no he
[1:05:27] want to see the message I'll show you
[1:05:29] the message it's in flesh it's substance
[1:05:33] it's got form it's got voice it's got
[1:05:36] It's got will it's got power it's got
[1:05:40] might it's it's not a teaching it's not
[1:05:42] a Doctrine it's not a religion it's a
[1:05:45] people
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:48] it's somebody that's real
[1:05:51] and it's me
[1:05:55] God's always used
[1:05:57] Believers to prove his word
[1:06:01] always use Believers to prove his word
[1:06:04] Moses believed that the pillar of Fire
[1:06:07] on the Mountain he believed he was going
[1:06:10] to go down there and deliver Egypt with
[1:06:12] a stick
[1:06:15] give me a break
[1:06:17] where are you going Moses going down to
[1:06:21] defeat pharaoh
[1:06:23] oh yeah
[1:06:25] that was a kook in flesh
[1:06:29] that was a Madman
[1:06:31] insane
[1:06:35] can you imagine him telling his wife
[1:06:37] load up
[1:06:39] we're going to Egypt
[1:06:45] but guess what
[1:06:47] he was that prophecy
[1:06:52] he was the Fulfillment of the vision and
[1:06:56] the prophecy that God spoke that they'll
[1:07:00] come out of Egypt with great substance
[1:07:03] I'm going down to get God's children and
[1:07:07] bring them out of Egypt with great
[1:07:09] substance
[1:07:12] their bank accounts are going to be
[1:07:14] filled they're going to be loaded up
[1:07:16] they're coming out of that land with
[1:07:18] great substance why because God said so
[1:07:21] he told Abraham he prophesied it he
[1:07:25] spoke it now I am that Deliverance
[1:07:28] the Deliverance was enough wasn't a myth
[1:07:34] it wasn't a political movement
[1:07:39] it was a flesh
[1:07:41] it was in flesh
[1:07:44] it was in form
[1:07:46] it was substance
[1:07:48] it was faith in substance
[1:07:52] the faith was the Revelation made flesh
[1:07:58] Pharaoh took his place Egypt took his
[1:08:01] place there had to be a pharaoh raise up
[1:08:03] that didn't know the children of Israel
[1:08:05] so they could be afflicted they had to
[1:08:08] be there 400 years there had to be a
[1:08:10] Moses rise up that was going to go down
[1:08:13] and deliver him with a mighty hand all
[1:08:16] because
[1:08:17] the word
[1:08:18] had to become flesh you know why we're
[1:08:21] here in this ugly Wicked insane crazy
[1:08:27] gone mad world

[1:12:48] chosen to manifest that he's a delivery
[1:12:51] in this attribute is going to be
[1:12:53] manifested in me I'm the attribute of
[1:12:56] healing
[1:12:58] amen
[1:12:59] I'm the attribute of forgiveness I'm the
[1:13:03] attribute of Mercy received
[1:13:06] who is it Mercy isn't out there
[1:13:09] somewhere Mercy's here Mercy's here I am
[1:13:13] Mercy
[1:13:15] I'm the proof of Mercy
[1:13:18] I'm the faith evidence
[1:13:21] of Mercy
[1:13:23] faith is the evidence
[1:13:25] of things hoped for not yet seen
[1:13:30] when does it become evidence
[1:13:33] when it's manifested in flesh it's not
[1:13:36] hearsay
[1:13:38] it's evidence
[1:13:40] I've seen it
[1:13:42] I know it's real
[1:13:46] it's it's it's how real is it
[1:13:50] as real as it gets
[1:13:53] to me
[1:13:56] someone can tell you that's hot
[1:14:00] and you say okay that's hot touch it
[1:14:05] then you know it's hot
[1:14:13] is he full of Mercy
[1:14:15] ask for it
[1:14:20] you'll get it
[1:14:22] because he said he would do it
[1:14:25] circumstance don't stop them
[1:14:27] you say I'm pretty deep I'm pretty bad
[1:14:30] I'm pretty away from God that don't
[1:14:32] matter circumstance don't stop it
[1:14:36] does it
[1:14:38] he went into the lowest hail
[1:14:41] to preach the gospel
[1:14:43] no
[1:14:44] you're elected to receive it let's just
[1:14:47] finish and we'll have communion
[1:14:50] as the brothers are are getting ready
[1:14:54] I gave the deacons double duty they have
[1:14:56] to
[1:14:57] set up for Community Sunday school and
[1:15:01] then set up for foot washing I thought
[1:15:04] we'd see if we could do it
[1:15:07] um but anyway
[1:15:08] so we were that he says that he said
[1:15:11] no he says notice it was by his
[1:15:15] Believers that he proves this word by
[1:15:18] he can only prove his word
[1:15:21] not by unbelievers it's only by the
[1:15:26] believer that he can prove his word
[1:15:31] there's only one way that he can prove
[1:15:34] that the prophecy has been fulfilled
[1:15:39] is to have a human being
[1:15:44] believer
[1:15:46] to fulfill it in
[1:15:49] so the minute that we get the idea that
[1:15:53] even this message is not this message is
[1:15:56] not a teaching
[1:15:59] it's a revealing
[1:16:02] of the Bride of who she is if I could
[1:16:06] say it this way by the by making clean
[1:16:11] of the word that I preached to you has
[1:16:15] made you clean it's washed the unbelief
[1:16:18] away from you
[1:16:21] and it's it's
[1:16:26] calling you into an existence
[1:16:29] into an Evidence
[1:16:33] of what that you you've hoped for
[1:16:36] and believe
[1:16:39] so no longer is this message
[1:16:42] the teaching of William Branham
[1:16:46] it is the teachings
[1:16:49] that William Branham revealed made flesh
[1:16:54] and therefore
[1:16:57] calling a bride and producing a bride
[1:17:00] into existence
[1:17:06] each of us taking our place in existence
[1:17:11] and and you're always going to hear one
[1:17:14] thing from Satan it's not you
[1:17:19] oh he won't deny
[1:17:23] that it's somebody
[1:17:28] but it ain't you
[1:17:33] that's always been his thing oh sure
[1:17:35] it's somebody but it ain't you it ain't
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:40] and what's my answer
[1:17:42] you're the father of Lies there's no
[1:17:45] truth in you
[1:17:46] therefore it is me
[1:17:49] who is it it's me who's the bride it's
[1:17:53] me who's going to believe this message
[1:17:55] it's me I'm the one it's me where is it
[1:18:00] made flesh where is it real show me a
[1:18:02] Believer it's me
[1:18:05] he proves his word by the believer who
[1:18:08] is that believer it's me
[1:18:11] I'm the one that's the believer I'm the
[1:18:14] one he's going to prove his word by I'm
[1:18:16] the one that's going to be a part of the
[1:18:18] Bride he's going to have a Rapture how
[1:18:20] many believes he's going to have the
[1:18:21] Rapture who's going in the rapture it's
[1:18:25] me
[1:18:27] I am the rapture
[1:18:32] it's no longer in teaching
[1:18:37] it's no longer
[1:18:39] in theory thought
[1:18:43] it was spoken
[1:18:45] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:18:48] Word was made flesh
[1:18:52] were you in the beginning
[1:18:54] were you in his thoughts were you in his
[1:18:57] thinking did he know where you'd be here
[1:19:00] the color of your hair the color of your
[1:19:02] eyes your statue everything about you he
[1:19:04] knew all that did he know you were a
[1:19:06] Believer now you've been made flesh
[1:19:11] I don't really care too much about what
[1:19:13] my flesh is
[1:19:15] but as long as that believing seed is in
[1:19:18] there
[1:19:19] I'm okay
[1:19:21] if I didn't get the right body here I'll
[1:19:23] get the right one there
[1:19:26] I'm convinced
[1:19:28] that it's me let's just read and finish
[1:19:31] and we'll start communion
[1:19:34] he says no matter he said he can only
[1:19:38] prove his word not by unbelievers it's
[1:19:41] only by Believers that he can prove his
[1:19:44] word no matter how much the rest of them
[1:19:47] claim to be oh I believe brother see if
[1:19:51] you do God will prove it so because we
[1:19:55] look and see the others how can we say
[1:19:59] then
[1:20:01] see it's by the True Believer that he
[1:20:05] proves his word
[1:20:06] not by those who say they believe but by
[1:20:10] those who really believe
[1:20:12] it's by his believing children that he
[1:20:16] proves his word
[1:20:21] how does he prove his word by making it
[1:20:24] come to pass
[1:20:26] God doesn't need his word interpreted
[1:20:29] does he
[1:20:31] how does God interpret his word by
[1:20:34] bringing it
[1:20:36] to pass
[1:20:38] now we always take that quote and we
[1:20:41] look at it in some fulfillment of
[1:20:44] promise you're the greatest promise of
[1:20:46] the age the greatest promise of the age
[1:20:49] is the bride the greatest promise of the
[1:20:53] age is an elect lady that is not is
[1:20:55] going to be an eve that says no to Satan
[1:20:59] and takes the Rapture that goes back to
[1:21:03] Eden
[1:21:05] that's how he does it he interprets his
[1:21:08] word by bringing it to pass where is he
[1:21:12] going to bring it to pass
[1:21:14] in me
[1:21:17] I'm her
[1:21:20] now
[1:21:21] he had the Believers
[1:21:24] the old crop had died off
[1:21:27] the unbelievers who said we couldn't
[1:21:29] take it
[1:21:31] he led every one of them perish why
[1:21:35] every one of them but believers who was
[1:21:39] left Moses had been taken into Glory
[1:21:43] the unbelievers had perished in the
[1:21:45] wilderness it was the children it was
[1:21:49] their children
[1:21:50] they were the only two that crossed over
[1:21:55] that was the Believers Joshua and Caleb
[1:21:59] they was
[1:22:01] the Believers they was the ones that
[1:22:04] crossed over
[1:22:06] it's only it's the only way God can do
[1:22:10] it is by his believing children you
[1:22:15] believe that
[1:22:18] all right
[1:22:19] his Believers was the ones that done it
[1:22:23] he used them to cross over with I want
[1:22:28] you to notice he does it that way in
[1:22:32] every age
[1:22:35] he does it every time by the same method
[1:22:41] he has to take believers
[1:22:46] and then in order to have Believers to
[1:22:50] meet that word he's got to
[1:22:54] predestinate it to that age you see it
[1:22:58] he's got to predestinate this to
[1:23:02] this thing to be there to meet the
[1:23:06] challenge of the age did you did it get
[1:23:10] you
[1:23:11] did you feel it did you see it did you
[1:23:16] understand it that's what's happening
[1:23:20] today he predestinated it
[1:23:24] it to this by his foreknowledge
[1:23:28] when he predestinated it in Malachi 4
[1:23:31] it's got to happen when he come over and
[1:23:35] predestinated anything to happen in his
[1:23:38] word he had to prove all of his word to
[1:23:42] be so and when he predestinates anything
[1:23:45] to happen and says it'll happen he knows
[1:23:49] that seed will be there just at that
[1:23:55] time
[1:23:56] Hallelujah who is that seed it's me
[1:24:03] foreign
[1:24:04] were this made flesh
[1:24:09] you say well that was said in 64. It's
[1:24:12] Made flesh today
[1:24:16] 400 years ago he told Abraham
[1:24:19] they were going to come back out of the
[1:24:21] land with great substance
[1:24:23] he had to predestinate every believer he
[1:24:26] had to predestinate Joshua and Caleb he
[1:24:29] had to predestinate them Moses he had to
[1:24:32] predestinate a pharaoh he had to put
[1:24:34] everything in his place in position and
[1:24:37] he had to put his Believers there too
[1:24:40] just like you that's why you're called
[1:24:43] that's why you're here
[1:24:45] that's why you're elected that's why
[1:24:47] you're in the most wicked deceitful age
[1:24:49] there ever was so he could
[1:24:53] prove
[1:24:54] that this eve will not be like the first
[1:24:58] year
[1:24:59] to prove that he does have a church
[1:25:01] without spot or wrinkle
[1:25:04] that he does have a people that are his
[1:25:07] workmanship in Christ Jesus for ordained
[1:25:10] under good work and it's it's not a
[1:25:13] Bible teaching
[1:25:15] it's real people
[1:25:18] real flesh
[1:25:20] made word in the beginning the word was
[1:25:23] made flesh now flesh is being made word
[1:25:30] he
[1:25:33] and when he predestes anything
[1:25:36] he says
[1:25:38] can he come over and predest anything to
[1:25:40] happen
[1:25:43] he had to prove his word to be so he
[1:25:46] predestined anything that happens since
[1:25:48] it will happen he knows that seed will
[1:25:51] be there just at that time he
[1:25:54] predestinated a bride she's going to be
[1:25:59] there
[1:26:00] going to be a Rapture she's going to be
[1:26:05] there he predestinated it by his
[1:26:08] foreignology therefore nothing's going
[1:26:12] to stop it amen
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:17] there's going to be a bride
[1:26:20] he predestinated it he elected it he
[1:26:24] called it who is it
[1:26:27] it's me
[1:26:31] why don't we change the name of our
[1:26:33] church to me Tabernacle
[1:26:37] it's me
[1:26:38] it's me I'm the one he's talking about
[1:26:41] I'm the one this word spoke of be it
[1:26:44] unto me according to Thy word amen my
[1:26:49] brothers are I hope that they're ready
[1:26:52] for communion I don't know but let's
[1:26:55] stand this evening and
[1:27:02] let's open our Bibles
[1:27:28] see if I can find my
[1:27:37] so yeah I forgot my communion chapter
[1:27:42] I thought it was in Corinthians
[1:27:47] all right so it is
[1:27:48] here it is yeah 11 23.
[1:27:58] you put yourself right in all these
[1:28:00] great scriptures
[1:28:02] for I have received the Lord that which
[1:28:04] also I delivered unto you
[1:28:06] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:28:09] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:28:11] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:28:13] it and said take eat
[1:28:15] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:28:19] this do in remembrance of me
[1:28:22] and after the same men are also he took
[1:28:25] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:28:28] cup is the New Testament
[1:28:31] in my blood
[1:28:33] this do ye as often as ye drink it in
[1:28:37] remembrance of me
[1:28:38] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:28:41] drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[1:28:44] death till he come wherefore whoever
[1:28:47] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:28:49] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:28:53] of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:28:56] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:29:00] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:29:02] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:29:06] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:29:08] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:29:12] body
[1:29:12] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:29:16] among you and many sleep
[1:29:18] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:29:22] should not be judged and when we are
[1:29:24] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:29:27] we should not be condemned with the
[1:29:30] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:29:32] come together to eat carry one for
[1:29:35] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:29:37] eat at home that ye come not together
[1:29:40] unto come the nation and the rest will I
[1:29:43] set in order

[1:41:38] time for communion
[1:41:44] let's stand and open our Bibles to John
[1:41:47] the 13th chapter
[1:42:00] now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:42:04] when Jesus knew
[1:42:07] that his hour was come
[1:42:10] that he should depart out of this world
[1:42:13] unto the father having loved his own
[1:42:16] which were in the world
[1:42:19] he loved them until the end
[1:42:22] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:42:25] now put it into the heart of Judas
[1:42:28] Iscariot Simon's son to betray him
[1:42:32] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:42:35] all things into his hands
[1:42:38] and that he was come from God and went
[1:42:41] to God he raised from supper
[1:42:45] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[1:42:49] and girdeth himself
[1:42:51] after that he poureth water into a basin
[1:42:55] and begin to wash the disciples feet and
[1:42:59] to wipe them with the towel wherein he
[1:43:03] was girded
[1:43:04] then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[1:43:07] said unto him Lord does thou wash my
[1:43:10] feet
[1:43:11] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:43:15] do thou knoweth not now but Thou shalt
[1:43:19] know hereafter
[1:43:21] Peter said unto him Thou shalt never
[1:43:24] wash my feet
[1:43:26] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[1:43:29] thou hath no part with me
[1:43:33] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:43:36] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:43:41] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:43:45] needeth not to save to wash his feet
[1:43:48] but is clean every wit and ye are clean
[1:43:52] but not all
[1:43:54] for he knew who should betray him
[1:43:56] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:44:01] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:44:04] taken His Garment
[1:44:05] and was set down again he said unto them
[1:44:09] know ye what I have done to you you call
[1:44:14] me master and Lord and ye say well for
[1:44:17] so I am
[1:44:18] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:44:21] washed your feet

[1:44:26] feet
[1:44:27] for I have given you an example that ye
[1:44:30] should do as I have done to you
[1:44:33] verily verily I say unto you the sermon
[1:44:36] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:44:40] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:44:42] him if you know these things happy are
[1:44:46] ye if you do them
[1:44:48] amen at such a wonderful time
