[6:21] we gather under a promise that we're
[6:23] even two are gathered together
[6:26] lord in your name you're in their midst
[6:29] lord and it's because we come bringing
[6:32] you
[6:33] lord this building is an empty building
[6:35] you don't dwell in this building lord
[6:37] but you dwell on a people
[6:38] and lord when they're gathered together
[6:40] it's the fulfillment of the promise that

[7:33] amen
[7:34] we're going to go ahead and read psalm
[7:36] 87 this morning
[7:40] you know and it's a
[7:42] it's one of the many
[7:44] passages of scripture
[7:46] that speak of zion
[7:49] you know i i assume
[7:52] by now that we realize that zion is not
[7:56] a city or a place on a map
[7:59] that you can go visit not a historical
[8:01] or an archaeological location
[8:05] but you know zion is both a people
[8:08] and a dwelling place
[8:11] you know it's as we've met read many
[8:13] times through the psalms it's where he
[8:15] dwells
[8:17] and it's where a people dwells and it's
[8:19] where god can cohabit with his people
[8:22] together in fellowship
[8:24] and in one accord
[8:26] you know and it's described as a city
[8:28] it's described as a mountain but it's
[8:30] always spoken of
[8:32] in the feminine
[8:33] as her
[8:35] she
[8:37] you know psalm 87 is no different and
[8:39] it's just every time we read one of the
[8:41] psalms that talks about zion you get
[8:43] just another little glimpse
[8:45] into what zion
[8:47] who zion
[8:48] is
[8:50] it says in verse 2 of psalm 87 it says
[8:53] the lord loveth the gates of zion more
[8:56] than all the dwellings of jacob
[8:59] it's his favorite place
[9:02] it's not a jewish place
[9:04] more than all the cities of jacob
[9:08] this is something he loves more
[9:11] it's his beloved it's his most
[9:15] loved
[9:16] in verse 3 glorious things are spoken of
[9:20] the
[9:20] o city of god
[9:24] you know zion is the city of god
[9:28] it says you know the song we're marching
[9:30] to zion the beautiful
[9:32] city of god
[9:34] it says in psalm 46 4
[9:38] there is a river
[9:40] the streams whereof shall make glad
[9:44] the city of god
[9:48] which is the holy place
[9:51] of the tabernacles of the most high
[9:55] it says in verse 5 god is in the midst
[9:59] of her
[10:02] feminine
[10:04] she
[10:06] the city of god
[10:08] shall not be moved
[10:11] god shall help her
[10:14] and that right early
[10:16] zion
[10:18] the city of god
[10:20] shows up again in revelation 21.
[10:24] verse 2 and i john saw the holy city
[10:30] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[10:33] of heaven prepared as a bride
[10:37] adorned for her husband
[10:40] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[10:42] saying behold
[10:44] the tabernacle of god
[10:46] is with men
[10:49] and he will dwell with them
[10:52] and they shall be his people
[10:55] and god himself shall be with them and
[10:58] be their god and oh by the way that
[11:00] river shows up again in the next chapter
[11:02] in revelation 22.
[11:04] but you get a glimpse of zion
[11:07] the city
[11:09] the city of god
[11:10] the holy place his most
[11:13] favored place
[11:15] it's a she
[11:17] it's a bride
[11:19] it's a people
[11:21] a special place
[11:23] a chosen people
[11:26] you know we're not marching to zion
[11:29] we are zion
[11:31] it's not a place we're going to it's a
[11:33] place we've been called to it's a place
[11:35] that we find ourselves
[11:37] now
[11:38] if we be in him
[11:41] psalm 87 verse 4 it says there's an
[11:43] interesting passage in here just kind of
[11:45] caught my attention just want to look at
[11:46] this just for a second it says i will
[11:49] make mention of rahab
[11:51] and babylon to them that know me
[11:54] behold philistia and tyre
[11:56] with ethiopia
[11:59] this man was born there
[12:02] you know here the scripture is
[12:03] mentioning all these examples of of
[12:06] cities of great mighty
[12:09] powerful cities and kingdoms
[12:12] you know these are places of great
[12:14] commerce
[12:15] great military might
[12:18] great riches
[12:19] great influence
[12:21] maybe centers of learning some of the
[12:22] greatest kingdoms and cities
[12:25] in the world
[12:27] and how it might be an honor for one to
[12:29] be able to say
[12:31] i'm from that place
[12:33] i was born there my citizenship is one
[12:36] of these great
[12:37] kingdoms
[12:39] and how it might be looked at
[12:41] looked at in those days as
[12:44] you know a
[12:45] badge of honor
[12:46] oh he's you know he's he's from tire
[12:50] you know a lot of money a lot of
[12:51] influence there i bet he's well
[12:52] connected
[12:54] where this one might be from ethiopia
[12:56] that had great armies in that day and
[12:58] man he's he's got the whole backing of
[13:00] the whole country behind him
[13:03] and how it would be a great badge of
[13:05] honor to say this is my citizenship this
[13:07] is my
[13:08] passport this is where i belong this is
[13:11] where i was born
[13:13] it's the same in our day
[13:15] you know people
[13:17] might say i'm an american
[13:19] be proud of that citizenship and of that
[13:22] heritage and
[13:23] being able to get that passport in
[13:25] america being one of the greatest
[13:27] nations on the earth and people all
[13:28] around looking at that or you might be
[13:30] from france and say the same thing about
[13:33] your citizenship and your passport and
[13:35] your heritage and your national identity
[13:38] and how there's great pride and great
[13:41] but you know
[13:42] there's another
[13:44] citizenship
[13:46] there's another passport
[13:49] there's another heritage that is more
[13:52] favored
[13:53] than all of that
[13:56] says in verse 5 and of zion it shall be
[14:00] said this and that man was born in her
[14:06] so there's a birth in this kingdom as
[14:08] well
[14:10] there's an origin in zion as well
[14:13] while people may take great pride in
[14:15] being part of this nation or that nation
[14:17] or being able to get their citizenship
[14:19] here or have this badge of honor of
[14:21] being part of this culture or this
[14:23] nation
[14:25] there's another kingdom
[14:27] there's another city
[14:28] that you can be born in as well which is
[14:31] more favored that's a citizenship
[14:34] that's a heritage that's a passport
[14:36] that's more favored than any of the
[14:39] great kingdoms of the earth
[14:41] favored nation status
[14:44] if i ever heard of it
[14:47] it says in verse 5 and the highest
[14:50] himself
[14:52] shall establish her
[14:54] you can't work your way into this
[14:55] kingdom that's right he establishes your
[14:59] place in zion by birth
[15:02] and it is a more favored citizenship
[15:05] than any of even the greatest most
[15:07] powerful most influential most wealthy
[15:11] nations on earth
[15:13] zion
[15:14] city of god
[15:16] most favored city
[15:18] beloved
[15:20] the holy place
[15:22] a bride adorned as her husband
[15:25] how interesting that in psalms already
[15:29] being able to describe the importance
[15:32] of zion
[15:33] the importance of being a citizen
[15:36] of zion of being born into that most
[15:41] favored place
[15:43] you know
[15:44] last thing is verse 6 the lord shall
[15:47] count when he
[15:49] writeth up the people
[15:51] that this man was born here
[15:54] is there any that can say that they have
[15:56] been born
[15:58] in zion
[15:59] not your choosing
[16:01] but his
[16:03] you didn't bring any credentials you
[16:05] didn't bring any qualifications you
[16:07] didn't pass a citizenship exam you
[16:09] didn't learn have to learn how to say
[16:10] the pledge of allegiance
[16:12] you didn't have to learn how to speak
[16:14] any kind of language
[16:15] by his own choosing he caused a birth to
[16:18] con occur
[16:19] in the most
[16:21] favored nation
[16:24] so as i was reading psalm 87 it just
[16:26] struck me
[16:27] how if you desire his citizenship
[16:29] anywhere
[16:31] if you would seek heritage to be proud
[16:33] of anywhere
[16:34] if there's ever a kingdom where you
[16:36] could have most favored nation status
[16:39] the backing of the most influential
[16:42] the most rich the most powerful
[16:46] zionist kingdom
[16:48] and you can say they've been born in
[16:49] zion this morning when i read this i
[16:51] hope you do as well this is me
[16:53] speaking of zion
[16:54] so that's what stuck out to me this
[16:56] morning if you want to read uh think of
[16:58] that as we read together in psalm 87
[17:01] just a short passage
[17:03] his foundation is in the holy mountains
[17:06] the lord loveth the gates of zion more
[17:09] than all the dwellings of jacob
[17:11] glorious things are spoken of thee o
[17:13] city of god selah i will make mention of
[17:17] rahab and babylon to them that know me
[17:20] behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia
[17:23] this man was born there and of zion it
[17:26] shall be said this and that man was born
[17:29] in her and the highest himself shall
[17:32] establish her the lord shall count when
[17:34] he writeth up the people that this man
[17:37] was born there selah as well the singers
[17:40] as the players on instruments shall be
[17:42] there all my springs are in thee amen
[17:51] amen god bless you you may have your
[17:53] seats
[17:55] i sing the song this morning is the lily
[17:58] of the valley the bride and the morning
[18:01] star amen

[18:13] everything to me

[18:17] fairest to my soul

[40:45] [Music]
[40:56] is
[41:02] [Music]
[41:14] is
[41:16] [Music]
[41:23] i
[41:26] was

[43:19] amen
[43:21] all your sins all your disappointments
[43:24] the blood's greater
[43:26] prophet of god
[43:28] said that the only provided place of
[43:30] worship is under the shed blood
[43:33] of jesus christ
[43:35] and that's how we approach him this
[43:37] morning
[43:38] we approach them under the blood that
[43:40] was shed for us
[43:42] and because of that blood we can have
[43:44] boldness to enter in
[43:47] to the holiest of holies
[43:49] oh just layer go ahead and lay your
[43:51] faults down and your your failures your
[43:53] sins
[43:54] maybe maybe you had the wrong attitude
[43:56] on the way to church
[43:58] that's why we have a little time of
[43:59] singing a little time just to prepare
[44:01] your heart
[44:03] as you approach the throne
[44:05] [Music]
[44:06] start looking inwardly for a moment if
[44:09] you haven't already done it and
[44:12] start pleading that blood
[44:14] i believe that if
[44:15] as a body we can come in in the same
[44:18] unity
[44:19] on one mind and one accord we can see
[44:22] the supernatural in a way that we have
[44:24] never experienced it before
[44:27] scripture says the prayer of a righteous
[44:29] man availeth much
[44:32] well if the prayer of one righteous man
[44:34] availeth much how much more two three
[44:36] four
[44:37] five
[44:38] what about the expectations of the bride
[44:40] of jesus christ
[44:41] coming to be gathered together together
[44:43] the prophet of god said that when we
[44:45] brings our licks of fire that the pillar
[44:47] of fire settles down in our midst
[44:50] [Music]
[44:52] he said that he sends the angel of the
[44:54] lord
[44:57] for those that fear him
[44:59] the angels are encamped about them
[45:02] where two or three are gathered together
[45:03] in my name there i will be let's just
[45:06] approach them with that type of
[45:07] expectation heavenly father how we love
[45:09] you this morning
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] our creator
[45:15] our king our savior
[45:17] our redeemer
[45:19] our lover
[45:21] lord you've done what no man can do
[45:25] you had power to lay down your life and
[45:27] power to take it up again
[45:30] the life that was in that blood that you
[45:31] shed you have sent back
[45:33] upon your believer
[45:36] that we could say greater is he that is
[45:38] in me
[45:40] than he that is in the world
[45:42] lord the world tries to tout itself as
[45:45] some mighty something in the nations and
[45:48] the political
[45:50] realms and satan's kingdom and satan's
[45:53] eden
[45:54] oh it's just a bluff
[45:56] they have no power over your word or
[45:58] over your bride because we stand
[46:00] victorious
[46:01] father we thank you now as we come into
[46:03] your presence we thank you for each one
[46:05] that has been able to
[46:07] gather themselves together those that
[46:09] are streaming those that are sick and
[46:12] body father all the needs that are
[46:13] represented we commit it to you now
[46:15] we claim that precious blood that was
[46:17] shed and ask all these things in the
[46:19] name that was given to men to be saved
[46:22] by
[46:22] no other name was given
[46:25] under heaven but that name the lord
[46:26] jesus christ we ask it
[46:28] amen praise the lord
[46:31] as you're standing let's just turn in
[46:32] genesis chapter two
[46:41] just remember brother david and
[46:43] sister leslie as they're still in san
[46:45] diego
[46:48] um
[46:49] visiting
[46:50] my grandma his mother
[46:54] and so we just pray that god would
[46:57] uh bring them back safely
[46:59] amen i was just being a little
[47:01] light-hearted with the brothers
[47:03] there in the back right before
[47:05] service
[47:07] i was telling them i said hey all hail
[47:08] is fighting against this revelation
[47:11] i hope you all came with your swords
[47:12] drawn
[47:13] and ready to fight but i don't know
[47:15] about you but i didn't have the the best
[47:17] week
[47:18] you know we we've been we've been
[47:20] fighting in our body we've been fighting
[47:22] in our health you know ever since
[47:23] wednesday the devil's been fighting and
[47:26] uh the family getting sick and i i was
[47:28] just i was laying in bed this morning i
[47:31] couldn't fall asleep the devil just
[47:33] attacked me in my body and it was about
[47:35] five o'clock in the morning and i know
[47:36] some of the brothers were praying and
[47:38] and i just agreed in my heart i said
[47:40] lord i agree with the brothers that have
[47:41] been praying i believe i agreed together
[47:43] with the saints
[47:45] and i started to speak the word and i i
[47:47] just
[47:48] the very things that was on my heart i
[47:50] was saying lord let this be a reality
[47:51] for me and and i even just felt my
[47:53] sinuses and things just kind of release
[47:56] a little bit and and i was just
[47:57] struggling to be able to talk and all
[47:59] these things and and uh i said the
[48:01] devil's defeated
[48:03] the bride of jesus christ has come
[48:05] together this morning and we mean
[48:07] business
[48:08] amen so let's draw our swords and read
[48:10] out of genesis chapter two we'll be
[48:11] reading verse seven
[48:13] and continue to pray we're weak in body
[48:16] we we feel strength uh uh um maybe
[48:20] lacking but but that's nothing that god
[48:22] cannot make up for so we look to him in
[48:25] our and ourselves we are insufficient
[48:26] but in in god we can do all things amen
[48:30] genesis chapter two verse seven
[48:32] i would read like this
[48:35] and the lord god formed man
[48:38] of the dust of the ground
[48:41] and breathed into his nostrils the
[48:43] breath of life
[48:46] and man became a living soul notice it
[48:48] says that he breathed
[48:52] into his nostrils the breath
[48:56] of life
[48:57] and man became
[48:59] a living soul heavenly father we ask a
[49:01] blessing upon the reading of your word
[49:03] lord
[49:05] we ask lord that you come now
[49:08] and myself lord i'm just a man
[49:12] but we have your divine promise in your
[49:14] word lord
[49:16] by divine gift
[49:18] by your elected chosen that you're here
[49:21] to break the bread of life as only you
[49:22] can in christ's name we ask it amen you
[49:24] may have your seats
[49:26] you'll just also turn in your bibles
[49:28] with me to job 32
[49:31] just like to
[49:34] read the first eight verses there
[49:37] and
[49:41] remember brother billy
[49:43] as he also isn't feeling well
[49:46] there's been things going through
[49:49] maybe passing around and just
[49:55] been pressing the
[49:56] battle amen
[49:59] well glory to god i pray you come to
[50:00] have church job 32
[50:04] it would read like this
[50:06] first eight verses
[50:07] says so these three men cease to answer
[50:10] job
[50:11] because he was righteous in his own eyes
[50:14] so we're picking up in the story of job
[50:16] where job has lost everything
[50:18] every everything has been stripped away
[50:20] from job and now job is sitting on the
[50:22] ash heap and now even his comforters and
[50:24] even his friends that are coming to him
[50:26] they're basically just telling job he's
[50:28] a secret sinner
[50:30] i mean joe
[50:32] ain't nothing right going for job
[50:34] i don't know if anybody's ever felt that
[50:35] way where nothing is going right
[50:38] you feel like you can't even get a break
[50:41] i'll never forget one time i was driving
[50:43] down the road and i was going off to do
[50:45] a bid when i was living in arizona
[50:47] and i and i jumped in my truck and i
[50:49] started to drive off and i was like oh
[50:51] man
[50:52] i i i left my my my my workbook so i go
[50:55] back and grab my workbook and i i start
[50:57] to leave and then i left my cell phone i
[50:59] go back i i left my cell phone i start
[51:01] driving off and i realized i left my
[51:03] wallet and i said give me a break
[51:07] that still small voice said haven't i
[51:10] already
[51:11] oh
[51:12] oh i said lord forgive me
[51:15] lord forgive me but sometimes we feel
[51:17] like nothing's going our way
[51:18] and as it continues on here it says
[51:22] then was kindled the wrath of elijah
[51:26] the son of barachel the buzit of the
[51:29] kindred of ram against job with his
[51:31] wrath kindled because he justified
[51:33] himself rather than god and so you know
[51:36] just immediately reading the scripture
[51:38] who is this elijah
[51:40] you know job is is god's prophet
[51:43] job is god's elected these things have
[51:46] beholden upon job and now here this
[51:48] young man a lie who is rebuking job he
[51:51] says he goes and also against his three
[51:54] friends so he's also
[51:56] a liar who's lighting them all up
[51:59] he's like i got something to say to you
[52:00] job i got something to say to you three
[52:03] who is this young man
[52:06] says also against his three friends
[52:07] which was his wrath was kindled because
[52:09] they had found no answer
[52:12] and yet had condemned job notice they
[52:14] had found no answer so these three
[52:16] messengers these three friends uh that
[52:18] are coming to job in this and this this
[52:20] great uh uh uh a place that job is
[52:23] sitting they have no answer and so
[52:25] elijah is starting to to to speak and he
[52:28] and he says now elijah had waited till
[52:31] job had spoken because they were elder
[52:33] than he
[52:34] and when elijah had saw that there was
[52:36] no answer in the mouth of these three
[52:39] men then his wrath was kindled in elihu
[52:41] the son of barack of the buzai answered
[52:44] and said i am young and you are very old
[52:47] wherefore i was afraid and durst not
[52:50] show you mine opinion
[52:52] so that this this man has wisdom about
[52:54] him he knows he's sitting before his his
[52:56] elders and look we know that that that
[52:58] that uh i mean
[53:00] job was a wise sage that people bowed
[53:02] down to him in the marketplace so i
[53:04] believe a lie who is recognizing his
[53:06] position and who he's talking to and he
[53:08] knows that this is job i know who job is
[53:10] so so i am not going to share my opinion
[53:13] but it would seem as he starts to speak
[53:15] here something is taking place that eli
[53:18] who has a purpose there's something
[53:21] that he has to say because he said look
[53:22] i was not going to show forth uh my
[53:25] opinion i said days should speak
[53:28] and multitude of years should teach
[53:30] wisdom but there is a spirit in a man
[53:34] and the inspiration of the almighty
[53:36] giveth them understanding
[53:38] so we just want to start to draw and i i
[53:41] just want you if you can by the help of
[53:42] god take these two scriptures look at
[53:45] genesis chapter 2 and notice it says and
[53:48] and he breathed into his nostril the
[53:50] breath of life and man became a living
[53:52] soul and you find i want to tie these
[53:54] two scriptures together in job 32 8 it
[53:56] says but there is a spirit in the man
[54:00] and the inspiration of the almighty
[54:02] giveth them understanding the prophet of
[54:04] god would say
[54:05] oh my it's hard for me to keep peace
[54:09] lord help your interpreters and help me
[54:13] now when a man is inspired
[54:16] and he reads the inspired word
[54:21] now i want to speak to you a little bit
[54:24] this morning on when the inspiration
[54:26] strikes
[54:33] when a man is when when a man is
[54:35] inspired and he reads the inspired word
[54:38] the two inspirations together gives the
[54:41] result
[54:43] now you can never no matter how well you
[54:45] study the word
[54:46] it'll never do you no good till you're
[54:49] inspired yourself
[54:52] it takes your inspiration with
[54:56] the words already inspired
[54:58] so what we need today
[55:01] i believe that's
[55:03] today
[55:04] not 1956
[55:07] not tomorrow
[55:08] spiritual food and due season
[55:11] so what we need today
[55:14] is an inspiration over us
[55:18] god sweeping down with a new inspiration
[55:22] what did our pr our pastor talk about
[55:24] opening on our understanding he said if
[55:26] if we're going to continue to move
[55:28] forward
[55:29] then our understanding has to continue
[55:31] to be opened
[55:33] right so then god sweeping down with new
[55:36] inspiration
[55:38] and breathing over us his power and his
[55:42] love and himself that it might inspire
[55:45] us to quicken us and awaken us to his
[55:48] word
[55:49] and then the word being brought into
[55:51] that spirit of inspiration
[55:54] then you'll see miracles happen and
[55:57] things take place because the two
[56:00] comes together i don't know about you
[56:02] but i want the two to come together this
[56:05] morning i want to be inspired i want the
[56:08] inspiration to strike i want to take the
[56:10] inspired word with the inspiration of
[56:12] the holy ghost and have them to come
[56:14] together and i want to see cripples walk
[56:16] i want to see people delivered i want to
[56:18] see people healed i want to see the
[56:19] presence of god move amongst the
[56:21] assembly i i want to see this this this
[56:25] inspiration
[56:26] of god over my life and god sweeping
[56:29] down with a new inspiration and
[56:31] breathing power upon my life that i can
[56:34] wake up and put one foot on the ground
[56:36] and say oh oh god uh give me a new
[56:39] inspiration this morning may the power
[56:41] of god be breathing upon my life as i
[56:43] would go forward and i would step into
[56:45] the room and i would be having the
[56:47] thoughts of god upon my lips and i would
[56:49] i would be speaking the word i would be
[56:52] thinking about my brothers oh by this
[56:54] you shall know uh that you are my
[56:56] disciples by your love for one another
[57:00] not when you just you show it in public
[57:02] not when you just go out there and meet
[57:03] them but but oh you can show your love
[57:05] to your brothers and sisters without
[57:07] them even knowing it when you get on
[57:08] your knees and you start to pray for
[57:10] them you start to call out to god you
[57:12] start to call it oh god or would you
[57:14] breathe the power of god upon their life
[57:16] i want to see deliverance lord i want to
[57:18] see their lost ones saved lord oh if
[57:19] you'd be so pleased to do it lord i'm
[57:21] interceding on their behalf lord with a
[57:23] love let that love of god let that power
[57:25] of god breathe into your life let those
[57:27] attributes of god start to flow through
[57:29] you start to manifest the spirit of god
[57:32] oh we want to have this this this new
[57:34] inspiration and this power just
[57:36] breathing over us when inspiration
[57:38] strikes we look at here in our opening
[57:40] text
[57:48] here the church had accused job of being
[57:50] a secret sinner
[57:52] his comforters and the one that had come
[57:54] to
[57:55] uh uh uh job these three messengers that
[57:57] had spoken
[57:59] of their rebuking job for being a secret
[58:01] sinner and and job is like you know the
[58:03] integrity of my heart you know i i i
[58:06] constantly constantly besought the lord
[58:08] and all of these things that befallen me
[58:10] but here his accusers uh
[58:13] friends and comforters of him these
[58:15] these three men that have come a liking
[58:17] and the messengers are rebuking him and
[58:20] they're telling them oh my you know uh
[58:22] you're a secret sinner so you see they
[58:24] don't have the right approach
[58:27] they're condemning job see they don't
[58:29] have the full picture maybe maybe they
[58:32] have a portion of the picture uh maybe
[58:34] these men are wise i don't believe that
[58:36] they would have been in the company of
[58:37] job i i think they had a right to be
[58:39] there
[58:41] i think they were in his presence and
[58:43] joe maybe
[58:44] allowed them to come i don't know but
[58:46] just thinking of that they didn't have
[58:48] the whole picture there and so here he's
[58:50] on his ash heap and
[58:52] and and they're they're they're rebuking
[58:54] him for being a secret sinner but you
[58:56] know the prophet of god said job just
[58:57] kept sitting on the ash sheep job was
[58:59] waiting for the inspiration
[59:02] and i find it interesting here in the
[59:03] scripture as i was pondering this thing
[59:05] here comes this young man who and he
[59:07] comes to start to to rebuke job and he
[59:10] starts to rebuke the
[59:11] the the the the three men sitting there
[59:13] and and and elijah was this messenger he
[59:16] was the fourth one that was speaking but
[59:18] he was able to speak the word and and a
[59:20] lie who he started to correct job see
[59:23] but the prophet of god points out that
[59:24] elijah was not correcting job as a
[59:27] sinner but he was actually correcting
[59:29] job because job was was being selfish
[59:32] and
[59:32] and and because of the way that he was
[59:34] accusing god so so ellie who was
[59:36] speaking now from a portion where elijah
[59:39] had a better picture he had had a better
[59:42] understanding because oh i think it
[59:44] behooves us to start to think of who was
[59:46] this allahu that was speaking the
[59:48] prophet of god said oh someday i would
[59:50] like to break it down to you who this
[59:52] eli who was because elijah was christ so
[59:55] there was a word that was coming forth
[59:57] through a lie who that was speaking to
[1:00:00] job and what was going to happen as this
[1:00:02] fourth messenger started to speak to job
[1:00:05] what was starting to happen it was
[1:00:07] starting to pull job towards a
[1:00:09] revelation it was trying to pull job

[1:02:21] them disappoint maybe some of them i
[1:02:23] look up to but i'm doing a lot of
[1:02:24] hearing but oh there comes a day right

[1:02:38] that the lord is good a lot of us have
[1:02:40] done a lot of tasting you've been
[1:02:42] tasting of other people's testimony
[1:02:44] you've been tasting of the church and
[1:02:45] the atmosphere in the church but i want
[1:02:47] to tell you there comes a time where
[1:02:49] jesus will put the foot on the brow of
[1:02:50] the ship and say peace be still where
[1:02:53] you can say oh i have tasted but now i
[1:02:55] see for myself i have the revelation of
[1:02:58] what it means to be changed
[1:03:02] well help me preach this morning
[1:03:07] don't be afraid this won't hurt you
[1:03:13] god comes to do business god's here to
[1:03:14] speak
[1:03:16] i have heard but now i see so here job
[1:03:18] he's sitting on the ash heap he's
[1:03:20] waiting
[1:03:21] for this inspiration job is a prophet
[1:03:25] and now
[1:03:26] a lie who this representative
[1:03:29] jesus christ now bringing words through
[1:03:31] him
[1:03:32] drawing job to this place
[1:03:35] the prophet of god would say and then at
[1:03:37] that time it was
[1:03:39] when the inspiration struck him
[1:03:42] that's when the lightning began to flash
[1:03:44] and the thunders began to roar that's
[1:03:47] when the inspiration struck the prophet
[1:03:50] and he raised up and he said i know my
[1:03:52] redeemer liveth
[1:03:53] and in the last days he'll stand upon
[1:03:55] the earth
[1:03:57] though the skin worms destroy this body
[1:04:01] yet in my flesh shall i see god can i
[1:04:04] get a little more just a touch more
[1:04:05] volume
[1:04:10] i know my redeemer liveth
[1:04:12] and at the last days he'll stand upon
[1:04:14] this earth
[1:04:15] though the skin worms destroy this body
[1:04:18] yet in my flesh i
[1:04:21] will see god
[1:04:22] whom i shall see for myself
[1:04:25] all i want to say my heart's desire this
[1:04:27] morning
[1:04:29] is that the inspiration of the word of
[1:04:31] god will strike your soul
[1:04:35] here
[1:04:36] job was sitting upon the ash heap
[1:04:39] but he was waiting for the inspiration i
[1:04:41] believe there's an inspiration and
[1:04:43] understanding to be opened up to your
[1:04:44] morning that this morning that'll strike
[1:04:47] your soul and that can change you and
[1:04:49] lift you into heavenly places
[1:04:51] you know i think of the story there
[1:04:53] where elisha that there's a little ring
[1:04:55] if you could take it down just a notch
[1:04:57] where elisha came i believe to joe ash
[1:04:59] and said hey joash i want you to go
[1:05:01] ahead and shoot this bow out of the
[1:05:03] windowed eastward
[1:05:05] i want you to shoot this towards the way
[1:05:06] when jesus comes in i want you to go
[1:05:08] take that arrow now what was it that was
[1:05:10] the arrow of god's deliverance and so
[1:05:12] now joash was holding i believe it was
[1:05:14] joash he was holding the arrow of
[1:05:17] deliverance there and now what is the
[1:05:19] prophet going to do they take that word
[1:05:21] take the arrow of deliverance take that
[1:05:24] holy ghost take that what god has given
[1:05:26] unto you and now i want you to take that
[1:05:29] inspiration and i want you to strike the
[1:05:31] ground
[1:05:33] and now what did joash do he started to
[1:05:36] strike the ground
[1:05:39] one time
[1:05:43] two time three time and then elijah and
[1:05:45] then he stopped he said oh my
[1:05:48] why did you only strike it three times
[1:05:54] that was the arrow of god's deliverance
[1:05:56] that was in your hand you only struck
[1:05:58] three times so now you're going to have
[1:06:00] to continue to put up with your
[1:06:02] adversaries oh the prophet of god said
[1:06:04] that's exactly what the church has done
[1:06:06] they've only struck three times i think
[1:06:08] some of us have only struck one time
[1:06:12] as we ministered a little bit maybe
[1:06:14] maybe you've been justified maybe you've
[1:06:16] struck in the inspiration has struck you
[1:06:18] that you believe in jesus christ but i
[1:06:20] want to tell you wait
[1:06:22] there's more
[1:06:24] maybe you've struck twice and you're and
[1:06:26] you're and you're you're starting to
[1:06:27] live a sanctified life but i'll tell you
[1:06:29] there's more keep striking
[1:06:33] you you now have the arrow of god's
[1:06:36] deliverance keep striking
[1:06:38] maybe the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:06:40] now uh cleaning up your life and and
[1:06:43] you're living a sanctified life and now
[1:06:45] that holy spirit is coming in
[1:06:48] keep striking
[1:06:50] you have
[1:06:51] the arrow
[1:06:53] of god's deliverance that was the
[1:06:55] complaint with the churches oh uh they
[1:06:57] camped around justification they camped
[1:06:59] around sanctification they camped around
[1:07:01] the outpouring of the gifts but the
[1:07:03] church didn't keep striking
[1:07:05] well praise god there's a bride that has
[1:07:07] received the arrow of god's deliverance
[1:07:09] the holy ghost and they're going to keep
[1:07:11] striking is there somebody that wants to
[1:07:13] take the message of the hour and keep
[1:07:15] striking look keep striking church
[1:07:19] don't be satisfied with where you are
[1:07:22] you have the arrow of god's deliverance
[1:07:24] so if what's on my heart oh the
[1:07:25] inspiration can strike you just keep
[1:07:28] striking church
[1:07:31] look
[1:07:32] it's time to take back what's ours
[1:07:36] this is a restoration message
[1:07:39] and the arrow of god's deliverance is
[1:07:41] the holy ghost
[1:07:43] and the holy ghost is god's agent to say
[1:07:45] give it back
[1:07:47] that's what the restoration of the bride
[1:07:49] tree was is where those those death
[1:07:51] messengers came and they and they tore
[1:07:53] down and killed out the the church to
[1:07:55] those four roman devils oh god started
[1:07:58] to restore back and what is the agent of
[1:08:00] the holy ghost it's the enforcer
[1:08:03] we have the enforcer here this morning
[1:08:06] we have a right to go to that devil and
[1:08:08] say give it back
[1:08:11] somebody needs some joy this morning
[1:08:13] give it back
[1:08:15] if somebody needs some peace
[1:08:17] give it back
[1:08:18] does somebody need their children
[1:08:20] give it back
[1:08:24] what do you have need of what are you
[1:08:25] looking for
[1:08:26] keep striking the arrow of god's
[1:08:28] deliverance look the holy ghost is here
[1:08:31] this ain't fancy saints
[1:08:34] this is a reality
[1:08:37] go ahead
[1:08:39] you have a right to enforce the word of
[1:08:40] god you want your brother get your
[1:08:42] brother you want your sister
[1:08:45] claim it stand in the gap for him
[1:08:49] oh that's what the holy ghost is it's
[1:08:51] the enforcer to enforce upon satan the
[1:08:54] claims that god has given us
[1:08:57] i don't know about you but that gets me
[1:08:58] excited
[1:09:01] i i mean
[1:09:02] that's what we need
[1:09:06] we need the inspiration to strike
[1:09:09] i think there may be a greater
[1:09:11] atmosphere in the church
[1:09:13] when we hear these things
[1:09:17] i mean maybe if the officers of the land
[1:09:19] showed up with their badges and said hey
[1:09:23] i'm going to take you down to the bank
[1:09:25] and with all the withdrawal the money
[1:09:26] and give it to you and i have a court
[1:09:28] order from the governor of texas and and
[1:09:31] you were able to see with the five
[1:09:33] senses the reality of the enforcers here
[1:09:36] at your behalf to take you down to the
[1:09:38] bank maybe you'd get excited
[1:09:42] but if the inspiration can strike you
[1:09:46] if the revelation can strike you that
[1:09:49] god is here
[1:09:51] when the inspiration strikes you that
[1:09:52] you're free
[1:09:56] when the inspiration strikes you that
[1:09:57] you're delivered
[1:09:59] when the revelation strikes you that i
[1:10:01] can do all things through jesus christ
[1:10:03] that strengthens me when the inspiration
[1:10:05] strikes oh hallelujah when the
[1:10:07] revelation strikes blessed is the man
[1:10:09] whom the lord will not impute sin what
[1:10:12] does it say blessed is the man i tell
[1:10:14] you what when the inspiration strikes oh
[1:10:17] there is no sin imputed to you also in
[1:10:20] that same thing blessed is the man i
[1:10:22] want to tell you you're blessed
[1:10:24] oh when the inspiration of almighty god
[1:10:27] strikes you that you are blessed
[1:10:32] oh what did jesus tell cyber bar jordy
[1:10:34] he said simon you're blessed
[1:10:39] for flesh and blood have not revealed
[1:10:40] this to you oh the inspiration that has
[1:10:44] struck you simon barjona this
[1:10:46] inspiration this revelation didn't come
[1:10:48] from man but this was revealed to you
[1:10:50] from my heavenly father simon barcelona
[1:10:53] you are blessed and i'm no longer going
[1:10:56] to call you simon barjona but i'm going
[1:10:58] to call you peter why because you're
[1:11:00] blessed oh i want to tell you church i
[1:11:02] no longer call you church i call you
[1:11:05] bride why because you're blessed i don't
[1:11:08] impute any sin to you you are justified
[1:11:11] you never did it in the first place i no
[1:11:13] longer call you church i call you bride
[1:11:16] you are blessed and i want to tell you
[1:11:18] what oh you are born of my bone and
[1:11:20] flesh of my flesh and upon this
[1:11:22] revelation the revelation of the hour
[1:11:25] the revelation of the revealing of the
[1:11:27] son of man the revelation of the lord
[1:11:29] jesus christ this revelation who you
[1:11:31] have become one flesh with the gates of
[1:11:34] hell shall never prevail against it that
[1:11:36] means the gates of hell can never
[1:11:38] prevail against this pride because she
[1:11:41] is the revelation of the message she is
[1:11:44] the revelation of the new testament oh
[1:11:46] my goodness why can't somebody get
[1:11:48] excited about your inheritance you are
[1:11:51] the revealed word of the hour the
[1:11:53] message that is taken on flesh
[1:11:57] oh my goodness gracious i'm sorry but i
[1:12:01] know what i used to be
[1:12:04] i know what i was
[1:12:06] but one day
[1:12:07] inspiration struck
[1:12:10] you don't have to stay in that prison
[1:12:11] house any longer
[1:12:13] you can walk out this morning
[1:12:17] oh i believe jail sales are popping open
[1:12:20] bars are flying open
[1:12:23] why because jesus christ is here and
[1:12:25] whom the son
[1:12:27] has set free
[1:12:28] is free indeed is there somebody here
[1:12:31] this morning that is free
[1:12:33] why don't you act like it why don't you
[1:12:35] talk like it why don't you live like it
[1:12:38] why don't you let the power of the holy
[1:12:40] ghost breathe on you
[1:12:44] oh glory to god
[1:12:47] my goodness
[1:12:48] shake off those heavy bands
[1:12:53] lift up
[1:12:55] those hands
[1:12:57] hallelujah
[1:12:58] oh glory when inspiration strikes
[1:13:02] changes things
[1:13:05] i say doom devils are on the run
[1:13:09] the bride's filled with the holy ghost
[1:13:13] is that just mythology now
[1:13:18] the reason we
[1:13:20] struggle
[1:13:23] to live in higher heights
[1:13:25] is because we're not giving jesus christ
[1:13:27] preeminence
[1:13:30] god is not a liar
[1:13:35] so then
[1:13:37] when the bible says greater is he that
[1:13:39] is in you
[1:13:40] than he that is in the world
[1:13:44] when you fail
[1:13:45] in temptation
[1:13:48] and when you sit there and do the things
[1:13:50] that you do
[1:13:52] and you leave jesus right there with
[1:13:54] dirty feet
[1:13:56] whose fault is that
[1:13:58] yes bride you can be at fault
[1:14:02] that's the only way
[1:14:04] that eve got in trouble
[1:14:07] because she walked out
[1:14:09] from the protection of the word
[1:14:12] and if christ is with you
[1:14:15] the only reason why you fall
[1:14:18] is because you're making a choice
[1:14:20] over him
[1:14:22] and he will sit there like a gentleman
[1:14:25] and yes
[1:14:27] it's already finished
[1:14:29] yes your name's on the lamb's book of
[1:14:30] life
[1:14:32] and he'll wait
[1:14:34] for you to repent
[1:14:36] to plead the blood
[1:14:38] and to take him back
[1:14:41] because greater is he that is in you
[1:14:44] than he that is in the world and i
[1:14:46] believe there's an inspiration or a
[1:14:47] revelation an opening of our
[1:14:50] understanding that god
[1:14:52] as our pastor leads our flock into this
[1:14:54] field
[1:14:55] that is wanting to open up to us about
[1:14:57] this quickening power about the rising
[1:15:00] of the sun about this sheath wave that
[1:15:02] has been lifted up in the end time
[1:15:04] because it's showing us the maturity
[1:15:06] that we're coming in that we can do the
[1:15:08] greater works that we can be therefore
[1:15:12] perfect even as your heavenly father was
[1:15:13] perfect we have received a perfect word
[1:15:16] in the end time and now that perfect
[1:15:19] word is producing a perfect bride by a
[1:15:22] perfect faith because the perfect word
[1:15:24] has been restored which has restored a
[1:15:27] perfect bride
[1:15:28] oh i love it
[1:15:31] you want to know why i love it
[1:15:34] because i have heard
[1:15:38] now
[1:15:40] i see
[1:15:42] mama
[1:15:45] that's me in there
[1:15:47] that's not some other church
[1:15:51] oh that's good if you see it in your
[1:15:53] brothers and sisters but that's not what
[1:15:54] god's trying to get you to do
[1:15:58] i i think that's the one of the biggest
[1:16:00] problems is god has taken you on a
[1:16:02] journey the journey of the seed that
[1:16:04] he's placed in your life and you keep
[1:16:06] looking at everybody else like we're all
[1:16:08] a bunch of angels
[1:16:09] oh if i could ever be like so and so i'm
[1:16:11] sure they never have a trial i'm sure
[1:16:13] they've never done the things that i do
[1:16:15] are you kidding me
[1:16:17] that's why jesus christ died because
[1:16:19] we're all sinners
[1:16:21] we all need to plead the blood
[1:16:23] we all need to wash his feet
[1:16:26] we all need to choose him
[1:16:28] look
[1:16:29] we when you look through the i think we
[1:16:31] can be so foolish to think
[1:16:33] that that sanctification is a one-time
[1:16:35] work
[1:16:40] if you say you ain't got no sin you're a
[1:16:42] liar
[1:16:43] yeah it's a paradox because blessed is
[1:16:45] the man whom the lord will not impute
[1:16:46] sin you've got to keep taking god at his
[1:16:49] word because god ain't a liar
[1:16:54] people think i'm trying to talk into
[1:16:55] that i'm not i just lean over
[1:17:00] no god's not a liar
[1:17:03] but he has attributes that he wants to
[1:17:04] express
[1:17:06] so then when you find yourself giving
[1:17:09] over to your old nature
[1:17:11] then there's a revelation and
[1:17:13] inspiration that strucks you and you're
[1:17:14] saying you know what i am not a sinner
[1:17:17] i don't have to remain in this condition
[1:17:20] i don't even have to to live in
[1:17:21] condemnation why because the blood of
[1:17:24] jesus christ is greater than all my sins
[1:17:29] and now i am going to take the blood of
[1:17:31] jesus christ i'm going to confess my
[1:17:34] sins
[1:17:35] i am going to repent of the things that
[1:17:38] i've done i know i've been in bondage i
[1:17:40] know i've been in addictions and those
[1:17:43] addictions are stronger than me i don't
[1:17:45] have the power to overcome it i don't
[1:17:48] have the ability in myself i can't clean
[1:17:51] myself up enough to make myself ready
[1:17:54] for god god didn't want you to be able

[1:19:06] rose three times you'll deny me three
[1:19:08] times
[1:19:11] i imagine his inspiration was
[1:19:12] short-lived
[1:19:16] but i bet in the moment
[1:19:17] yeah boys
[1:19:19] i got the keys
[1:19:21] you heard him he even changed my name

[1:19:34] in about peter

[1:19:38] peter
[1:19:39] you're just getting the mechanics
[1:19:43] you just got the mechanics right now
[1:19:44] peter
[1:19:45] and and the mechanics don't have the
[1:19:47] power
[1:19:49] you've heard peter
[1:19:51] i've been training you peter i've been
[1:19:52] training you brian
[1:19:54] you got the mechanics that's good i've
[1:19:55] been walking with you

[1:19:59] teaching you peter
[1:20:02] lord
[1:20:03] what are you talking about
[1:20:05] hear his lord's being taken away
[1:20:07] well we're off the notes god help us
[1:20:10] here peter's been taken away
[1:20:15] hey aren't you one of them
[1:20:17] where was that inspiration

[1:20:31] bring back the kingdom
[1:20:34] you know what
[1:20:37] that inspiration that peter had
[1:20:40] i wonder where it was from
[1:20:42] because if there was a big show
[1:20:46] if there was a guard's ear to cut off
[1:20:49] if there was something for the church to
[1:20:50] see him do
[1:20:52] oh lord help us where are we going
[1:20:56] there was some self vindication
[1:20:58] that i got it i get to church early i
[1:21:01] stay late i dress in my three-piece suit
[1:21:05] i'm the bride you heard what he said
[1:21:08] oh as long as there's some big work for
[1:21:10] you to do as long as you can scream and
[1:21:12] shout and let the church know that you
[1:21:14] got it
[1:21:17] but when it was around a little campfire
[1:21:21] when it was around the lunch table at
[1:21:22] work
[1:21:25] when it was in the gas station and
[1:21:26] somebody kept using the name of the lord
[1:21:28] in vain
[1:21:30] when something was displeasing to your
[1:21:33] lord and they were crucified in my flesh
[1:21:36] and you stood there like
[1:21:39] i don't know the guy
[1:21:42] what happened to your inspiration that
[1:21:44] you had in church
[1:21:46] well you were all enthused about the
[1:21:48] word then you were jumping and shouting
[1:21:50] and saying oh yeah graters he that is in
[1:21:52] me i'm ready to go set the world on fire
[1:21:55] i'm going to tell
[1:21:57] everybody about it hey do you know that
[1:21:59] person named lord jesus i don't know who
[1:22:00] you're talking about
[1:22:02] not me
[1:22:03] i'll just drop a few
[1:22:04] explicatives so you really don't think
[1:22:06] i'm a believer
[1:22:09] oh yeah some of you do it just when the
[1:22:11] way you dress
[1:22:12] you're just dropping explicatives
[1:22:15] yeah i believe the message look at me
[1:22:17] skinned down weiner
[1:22:22] teenage boys you look like the rest of
[1:22:23] them
[1:22:24] god help us to do something to set us
[1:22:25] apart
[1:22:27] but let god speak to you a little bit
[1:22:30] yeah we get all inspired and we get
[1:22:31] enthused but a lot so many times it
[1:22:33] could be the wrong inspiration or the
[1:22:35] wrong channel you know david got
[1:22:36] inspired one time
[1:22:38] oh my goodness yeah let's have church
[1:22:41] bring the ark of the covenant home what
[1:22:44] jackson what do you think we should
[1:22:45] should we bring the should we should we
[1:22:47] bring the ark of the covenant home
[1:22:48] i think we should throw a big meeting
[1:22:51] and i think this is this is what we're
[1:22:53] going to do we're going to do it over
[1:22:54] there and i think uh i think this is
[1:22:56] what how we're going to do it and i i
[1:22:58] think man this is a great plan i tell
[1:23:00] you what i got a big vision
[1:23:02] let's let's just bring it home what do
[1:23:04] you think church i think we ought to do
[1:23:05] this and we ought to do that
[1:23:07] and oh my i mean hey i talked to the
[1:23:09] church i talked to the other preachers
[1:23:11] man i tell you what we're man we're all
[1:23:13] on board with this
[1:23:14] we're gonna have us a good time
[1:23:16] everybody meet me up at the church on
[1:23:18] saturday night
[1:23:20] and all of a sudden come to find out
[1:23:22] like
[1:23:23] what is what does brother david think of
[1:23:25] it
[1:23:26] oh well
[1:23:29] what does the prophet think about it
[1:23:30] what does the head ship think about it
[1:23:31] what does the order think about what
[1:23:33] does the word say about it what did the
[1:23:34] prophet say did you even consult the
[1:23:36] message of the hour
[1:23:39] see a lot of times we get inspiration
[1:23:41] but if we don't take that inspiration to
[1:23:43] the word then it's contrary to the word
[1:23:46] of god and then you can have the
[1:23:48] inspiration and be the wrong channel for
[1:23:50] it you got to take the inspiration back
[1:23:52] to the word and bring it under the
[1:23:53] headship and if it's of the lord he'll
[1:23:55] bring it to pass in its season
[1:23:58] so many times we want to get where are
[1:23:59] we at lord so many times we want to get
[1:24:02] ahead of god's program we get so
[1:24:04] inspired and we get so enthused but if
[1:24:06] we'll just be like job and sit there and
[1:24:09] wait for the inspiration to become
[1:24:12] revelation in its season then you'll see
[1:24:14] what god's doing
[1:24:18] lord help us
[1:24:21] oh yeah peter was inspired
[1:24:24] but that inspiration didn't keep him
[1:24:30] but all what did we read there in our
[1:24:32] opening text if the inspiration
[1:24:35] if you're inspired
[1:24:36] and that inspiration is of the lord
[1:24:39] and it comes together
[1:24:41] with the inspiration of the message what
[1:24:43] it it's it's the inspiration
[1:24:45] of god upon the believer now meeting
[1:24:48] with the inspired word and you said
[1:24:49] something has to take place
[1:24:52] what are the prophet of god said when

[1:25:10] meet
[1:25:11] something's got to shake
[1:25:13] something has to shake because it

[1:29:33] to surrender your heart why don't you
[1:29:35] let the inspiration strike and when the
[1:29:37] inspiration strikes oh you can be
[1:29:39] something like that blind bartimaeus
[1:29:40] that was held thou son of david have
[1:29:42] mercy on me i'm not gonna let this
[1:29:44] moment pass me this is my moment this is
[1:29:47] my predestinate moment in time i have
[1:29:49] been doing a lot of hearing i've heard
[1:29:51] all my life about the message of the
[1:29:52] hour i've heard all my life about being
[1:29:54] set free but oh god i want to see oh
[1:29:57] peel the veil away this morning i want
[1:29:59] to see the lord jesus christ standing
[1:30:01] here this morning
[1:30:03] oh god minister to our hearts
[1:30:06] praise his wonderful name
[1:30:09] all right
[1:30:11] we're ready to start preaching now i'm
[1:30:12] at my text
[1:30:19] so
[1:30:22] here in our text
[1:30:24] he thought i was kidding
[1:30:28] job says but there is a spirit in a man
[1:30:30] and the inspiration of the almighty god
[1:30:32] giveth them understanding
[1:30:34] now this this word it's
[1:30:37] you know if you if you do a little
[1:30:38] search in your bible the word
[1:30:40] inspiration will only come up twice
[1:30:43] but it's actually the word inspiration
[1:30:45] is
[1:30:46] shama
[1:30:48] and it means breathe
[1:30:50] or it means the breath of god
[1:30:53] and this neshama is the same word that
[1:30:55] is used in genesis 2 7.
[1:30:58] so it says
[1:31:00] as a liohu this representative of christ
[1:31:03] is speaking there to job and his
[1:31:05] condition he says and the inspiration
[1:31:08] of almighty god giveth them
[1:31:09] understanding i tell you what as god was
[1:31:11] leading me down this trail and i ran
[1:31:13] back into that i felt say thank god i i
[1:31:15] i
[1:31:16] i you just love to be gleaning in that
[1:31:18] field you know uh as our pastor has been
[1:31:21] leading us and says then the inspiration
[1:31:22] of the almighty god giveth them
[1:31:24] understanding so then we look
[1:31:26] in this in our in our text here in
[1:31:28] genesis 2 it says when god formed man
[1:31:30] out of the ground he breathed into his
[1:31:33] nostrils the breath of life or the
[1:31:35] inspiration of life he breathed
[1:31:38] life and the man became a living soul
[1:31:42] now now i just i just imagine there if
[1:31:44] you think about it i hear adam
[1:31:47] adam as god formed adam there
[1:31:49] in the dust
[1:31:51] the prophet of god would talk about how
[1:31:53] how adam was formed and
[1:31:55] out of the dust and he was standing
[1:31:57] there like a tree and his his his toes
[1:31:59] were rooted down into the ground like
[1:32:01] roots and his arms just kind of hanging
[1:32:02] there and then adam was a man
[1:32:07] formed
[1:32:09] like a tree
[1:32:11] his toes dug down in the earth and he
[1:32:13] was just standing there like a tree
[1:32:18] now he looked like a man
[1:32:21] but he was waiting for a quickening
[1:32:23] power
[1:32:25] waiting for the inspiration
[1:32:27] waiting for the breath of god so that he
[1:32:30] could serve his purpose now because
[1:32:32] remember adam adam was already living
[1:32:39] adam was a spirit man
[1:32:44] male and female he was already in
[1:32:47] existence but now what is god doing he's
[1:32:50] forming him a body
[1:32:54] and so now
[1:32:56] adam already exists because he's the
[1:32:58] spoken
[1:32:59] word gene of god but now he's formed a
[1:33:04] body on the earth
[1:33:07] so now he's formed this body and i want
[1:33:09] to say that if he would have formed this
[1:33:11] body after the fall then adam who was
[1:33:14] formed out of the dirt he would have
[1:33:16] came in a fallen nature and he would
[1:33:18] have had a dirty nature
[1:33:20] so then when when god breathed
[1:33:22] upon adam because he he was he was the
[1:33:26] first man there was no life in him but
[1:33:29] then god breathed the breath of life
[1:33:32] into his nostrils and he became a living
[1:33:35] soul i would say a much like us we were
[1:33:38] born in sin in a fallen nature so then
[1:33:42] because
[1:33:43] we're born in a fallen nature after the
[1:33:46] way that we came there is a fallen sin
[1:33:49] nature but then there comes a time that
[1:33:51] god is going to breathe upon this body
[1:33:56] that he has been allowed to be formed in
[1:33:58] ladies and it's going to burn out that
[1:34:01] old nature and it's going to be a
[1:34:03] quickening spirit that quickens that
[1:34:06] seed gene to life
[1:34:09] right
[1:34:12] prophet of god would say the church is
[1:34:14] the mystical body of christ
[1:34:16] so we're we're tying these things
[1:34:18] together
[1:34:21] born of the breath of god the church is
[1:34:24] the mystical body of christ
[1:34:27] born
[1:34:28] of the breath of god
[1:34:31] oh did you get that
[1:34:33] the church of god is born of the breath
[1:34:35] of god
[1:34:37] god breathed breath into his nostrils
[1:34:40] spiritually of adam
[1:34:42] and he became a living soul
[1:34:46] did you know the pentecostals or true
[1:34:48] pentecostal church is born of the breath
[1:34:52] of god
[1:34:54] you are born of
[1:34:57] the breath of god look the inspiration
[1:34:59] of god bringing forth understanding
[1:35:02] bringing forth revelation when your
[1:35:05] understanding is opened
[1:35:07] it's the quickening power making the
[1:35:10] word flesh in you
[1:35:12] maybe that's a big talk right there
[1:35:15] but that's what's happening
[1:35:17] the quickening power is making the word
[1:35:19] of god flesh in you
[1:35:22] we keep moving out of this i have heard
[1:35:24] but now i see the prophet of god would
[1:35:25] say now so now now we've been quick and
[1:35:28] we've been made alive
[1:35:29] the church has been birthed by the
[1:35:31] breath of god there's an inspiration
[1:35:32] that has struck you you know who you are
[1:35:35] you know where you're standing you know
[1:35:36] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:35:38] is in the world i i i'm the bride i i
[1:35:41] i'm without spotter i'm without wrinkle
[1:35:44] oh she is him oh we've heard these
[1:35:46] things and we're seeing the
[1:35:47] materialization of it we're catching the
[1:35:49] revelation all these things that uh
[1:35:52] melchizedek has come oh uh uh uh you
[1:35:54] know if if i could say it that way or i
[1:35:57] was thinking of eliezer i believe
[1:35:59] although there but you know all these
[1:36:00] great things that laid there in the
[1:36:01] scripture all these things are just
[1:36:03] opening up to us and illumines and our
[1:36:05] understanding is being opened up and
[1:36:07] we're feeding on it we're walking in it
[1:36:11] now there you this is that of
[1:36:13] i have heard but now i see paragraph 85
[1:36:15] he says now there you are when you're
[1:36:17] prayed for
[1:36:19] you don't have to run back through a
[1:36:21] line
[1:36:22] or go let somebody else pray for you
[1:36:26] when you know you've done exactly what
[1:36:27] god told you to do
[1:36:30] see then wait for that channel of
[1:36:32] inspiration to open up to you
[1:36:35] and now i am healed
[1:36:37] when it drops in there then it's all
[1:36:39] over you don't need no prayer lines
[1:36:41] nothing else it's over
[1:36:44] it's been revealed to you
[1:36:46] i wonder if there's somebody here
[1:36:50] that the inspiration can strike you and
[1:36:53] say it's over
[1:36:55] i've been running
[1:36:56] i've been wondering who i am i've been
[1:36:58] wondering if i'm the bride of jesus
[1:37:00] christ i've been looking at my faults
[1:37:02] and my failures i've been wondering the
[1:37:04] devil keeps trying to tell me i'm
[1:37:06] foolish virgin
[1:37:08] the devil keeps trying to tell me i'm
[1:37:09] never going to make it the devil keeps
[1:37:11] telling me that i'm going to have to put
[1:37:13] up with these faults and failures the
[1:37:15] rest of my life
[1:37:18] but now faith cometh by hearing the word
[1:37:22] so then as faith is striking that gene
[1:37:25] feat of god
[1:37:26] something is starting to transpire where
[1:37:29] now that hearing is becoming a seeing by
[1:37:32] faith
[1:37:33] it's becoming a revelation and then when
[1:37:36] the enemy comes and tries to make you
[1:37:38] doubt it
[1:37:40] you know where you're standing
[1:37:43] the enemy will come and try to make you
[1:37:45] doubt and say you don't got the holy
[1:37:46] ghost
[1:37:48] now here's a simple formula
[1:37:51] because many times we go through trials
[1:37:54] and god might be correcting us or we're
[1:37:57] failing in certain areas and then don't
[1:38:00] mistake the conviction of god amen
[1:38:04] if something's telling you you ain't got
[1:38:05] the holy ghost
[1:38:07] well there's a simple formula you can do
[1:38:11] and say you know what if i'm not living
[1:38:13] in overcoming life lord i don't know
[1:38:16] where i'm at but one thing i do know
[1:38:20] that you can take me from where i'm at
[1:38:22] into higher heights
[1:38:24] and you repent of your sins because many
[1:38:26] of us have been there say lord my
[1:38:27] goodness if how could i even have the
[1:38:29] holy ghost and they've done that
[1:38:31] but you take when the devil tries to
[1:38:33] start to condemn you you take them back
[1:38:34] to the word and say well i've repented
[1:38:36] of my sins i've been baptized in the
[1:38:38] name of the lord jesus christ lord i
[1:38:39] want to serve you with all of my heart
[1:38:41] and if i don't got the holy ghost by
[1:38:43] divine promise
[1:38:45] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:38:47] your word will never pass away and i'm
[1:38:50] standing upon that sure
[1:38:53] word that you told me lord i shall
[1:38:56] receive the gift of the holy ghost and
[1:38:58] take that promise alone right there and
[1:39:00] start whooping the devil with it
[1:39:02] okay devil you caused me to fall
[1:39:05] but guess what
[1:39:06] jesus died for me
[1:39:08] yeah devil you you got me to fall again
[1:39:10] but guess what
[1:39:11] blessed is the man whom the lord will
[1:39:12] not impute sin
[1:39:14] yeah you keep trying to rub it in my
[1:39:16] face all my past and all my mistakes but
[1:39:17] guess what there is therefore now no
[1:39:19] condemnation to them that are in christ
[1:39:21] jesus you start whooping that old devil
[1:39:24] with the word
[1:39:26] but when you find out you probably don't
[1:39:28] got the holy ghost is when you start to
[1:39:30] justify
[1:39:33] your condition
[1:39:34] well you know i mean who you know and
[1:39:37] you start to cope
[1:39:41] friends we are not called to cope
[1:39:45] we are called to overcome
[1:39:48] and if something in your heart knows
[1:39:52] and believes and doesn't want to live
[1:39:54] the way you're living anymore that is
[1:39:57] the god seed inside of you
[1:40:00] crying out for deliverance and if
[1:40:03] there's a deep hallelujah crying out
[1:40:06] saying their gods to be something more
[1:40:09] that means there's a deep to respond and
[1:40:11] there's an inspiration to strike you
[1:40:13] this morning to tell you look that's
[1:40:15] been me
[1:40:16] all the time i'm the one that's been
[1:40:19] keeping you you should have been dead so
[1:40:21] many times you should have been gone so
[1:40:23] many times you would have quit you would
[1:40:25] have given up oh my when you went
[1:40:27] through all them trials and tribulations
[1:40:29] and everything was messed up in your
[1:40:30] family you would have packed your bags
[1:40:32] and you would have left you'd have been
[1:40:34] long gone and you wonder why are you
[1:40:36] still sitting here this morning why
[1:40:38] because it's christ in you the hope of
[1:40:41] glory he's the one that is keeping you
[1:40:44] he's the one that's holding you he's the
[1:40:46] one that's carrying you like the sand
[1:40:49] the footprints on the sand of time oh my
[1:40:51] in my deepest trials lord why did you
[1:40:54] leave me when i was so alone and my
[1:40:57] heart was broken i didn't think i could
[1:40:59] make it another day lord jesus i looked
[1:41:01] back there on the sands of time and i
[1:41:04] only see one set of footprints lord why
[1:41:07] did you leave me there oh my daughter my
[1:41:10] son i didn't leave you the the reason
[1:41:14] there's only one set of footprints is
[1:41:16] because i was carrying you don't you
[1:41:18] realize
[1:41:20] predestination has a destination and
[1:41:23] you've been wrapped in the arms of
[1:41:25] predestination and it's going to carry
[1:41:27] you all the way home
[1:41:30] oh glory to god that shouting grounds
[1:41:32] right there breathe the destination of
[1:41:35] predestination god has spoken a bride in
[1:41:38] the end time that has a destination by
[1:41:42] predestination you can't miss it
[1:41:45] let that inspiration strike you
[1:41:48] you'll chop the devil's head off
[1:41:52] let the devil come lying to you then
[1:41:54] you know david knew who he was
[1:41:58] david's inspiration wasn't fake
[1:42:01] david had been anointed
[1:42:03] david knew where he was going
[1:42:05] there was a destination of pre of
[1:42:08] predestination in david's life
[1:42:13] that's why he could go on down there
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:17] god's given me the kingdom
[1:42:19] god's given me his word
[1:42:22] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:42:23] is in the world
[1:42:25] who is this uncircumcised philistine
[1:42:28] yeah david was just about his father's
[1:42:30] business david didn't have no prestige
[1:42:33] he didn't have no position in the church
[1:42:35] he was just about his father's business
[1:42:36] bringing down a cheese bucket to the
[1:42:38] battle
[1:42:39] all right look you know dad if you want
[1:42:40] me to bring a cheese bucket down to the
[1:42:42] battle
[1:42:43] i mean i'm just a lowly
[1:42:45] cheap herder you know i mean
[1:42:47] i'll remain in my calling
[1:42:50] i'll walk it on down there
[1:42:53] yeah but david was still living a
[1:42:55] victorious life
[1:42:57] he didn't have he didn't have big
[1:42:59] position or anything but you know what
[1:43:01] in his normal simple job he was still
[1:43:04] whooping devils
[1:43:06] you don't need some great big position
[1:43:08] you don't need some great big job david
[1:43:10] was the lowest of his brethren out there
[1:43:13] herding sheep on the backside of the
[1:43:15] desert and you know what he was doing
[1:43:18] he was taking devil's head off
[1:43:22] maybe the devil was trying to get after
[1:43:23] him oh man he thinks he's somebody you
[1:43:25] know he's anointed well i'll just go
[1:43:27] tear up his his father's house sheep
[1:43:30] i'll just go ahead and cause a cause a
[1:43:31] little commotion at his job
[1:43:35] i'll go send a co-worker over there to
[1:43:37] cause a big bunch of chaos
[1:43:39] and i'll really get him discouraged
[1:43:42] i'm going to send an evil spirit
[1:43:46] over there and cause some calamities and
[1:43:48] get david real discouraged
[1:43:49] well when that devil showed up and tried
[1:43:51] to try to start causing problems and
[1:43:54] telling lies on them right that old
[1:43:56] devil come up and try to oh he's been
[1:43:57] doing this he's been doing that oh okay
[1:43:59] all right i see you devil you don't know
[1:44:02] who i am i'm the bride of jesus christ
[1:44:04] i've been anointed i've been called i've
[1:44:06] been placed here in ladies to meet
[1:44:08] devils like you and i'm not backing down
[1:44:11] you know what david did by the
[1:44:12] inspiration that struck him he knew he
[1:44:15] was in position he killed a bear he
[1:44:17] killed a lion so when he showed up there
[1:44:19] at goliath he looked the same lord that
[1:44:21] delivered me the same lord that
[1:44:22] justified me the same lord that
[1:44:24] sanctified me the same lord that filled
[1:44:26] me with the holy ghost he's the same
[1:44:28] lord here that's here this morning he's
[1:44:30] the same lord that i heal my body he's
[1:44:32] the same lord that'll give me my family
[1:44:34] he's the same lord that'll deliver in my
[1:44:35] complex he's the same lord that'll bring
[1:44:37] my prodigals home he's the same lord and
[1:44:39] i tell you old devil you're
[1:44:41] uncircumcised felicity you ain't no
[1:44:43] different than that bear in that line
[1:44:45] i'm going to take your head off this day
[1:44:49] david knew who he was
[1:44:52] david was faithful in the little things
[1:44:55] and you see the fruits in his life
[1:44:59] now when it's revealed to you
[1:45:02] that you yourself have received god's
[1:45:04] promise
[1:45:06] the inspiration
[1:45:08] you being christians
[1:45:11] it struck you you don't ever need a
[1:45:12] prayer line
[1:45:14] the only thing you need is an open heart
[1:45:16] when all the mechanics are ready
[1:45:21] when all the mechanics are ready
[1:45:25] and let the inspiration
[1:45:28] drop in
[1:45:30] nothing can change your mind
[1:45:34] you've got
[1:46:00] what are you believing for
[1:46:02] you got it
[1:46:09] when all the mechanics are are the
[1:46:10] mechanics ready
[1:46:15] are the mechanics ready
[1:46:18] you know you can get all the mechanics
[1:46:19] ready this morning
[1:46:22] well i'll tell you what it's awesome to
[1:46:23] serve god
[1:46:26] it just takes a moment in his presence
[1:46:30] and all the mechanics can be ready
[1:46:32] i called on the name of the lord you
[1:46:34] shall be saved god dropped down
[1:46:36] changed my whole life
[1:46:38] i mean in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:46:40] eye the mechanics got ready and the
[1:46:42] dynamics dropped in and changed me and
[1:46:44] filled me with the holy ghost just like
[1:46:46] they came i believe to cornelius
[1:46:49] you know an angel appeared unto him
[1:46:51] right
[1:46:52] so many times we want to bypass god's
[1:46:55] program
[1:46:56] you ever think about that an angel
[1:46:57] appeared under cornelius
[1:46:59] and the angel couldn't give them the
[1:47:01] holy ghost
[1:47:05] because god if he ever does something
[1:47:07] one way he does it the same way every
[1:47:08] time
[1:47:11] so the angel had to say go get peter
[1:47:14] have him come pray for you
[1:47:17] and while peter was preaching the word
[1:47:22] oh he's the same
[1:47:24] yesterday today and forever there's
[1:47:27] something on your heart and something
[1:47:29] that you're believing while the word is
[1:47:32] going forth oh the breath of god is
[1:47:35] breathing upon the bride receive ye
[1:47:39] the holy ghost and the holy ghost fell
[1:47:42] upon them and they started to speak in
[1:47:44] tongues the dynamics came upon the
[1:47:46] mechanics and all of them jews they
[1:47:49] looked around peter and all of them and
[1:47:50] said hey they're doing exactly what
[1:47:52] we're doing they got the same power we
[1:47:55] got what should we do is like well we
[1:47:57] should baptize them because that's the
[1:47:59] formula they got the holy ghost and then
[1:48:01] they got baptized while the word was
[1:48:04] being preached you ain't gonna wait for
[1:48:07] the water you can get it while it's
[1:48:09] being preached but i tell you what if
[1:48:10] you get it while it's being preached you
[1:48:12] can't wait to get in the water you
[1:48:15] cannot wait what does hinder there's
[1:48:17] water right here fill up the tub fill up
[1:48:20] the pool throw a tarp in the pickup bed
[1:48:23] fill it with water take me down to the
[1:48:26] river there's a pool over there let me
[1:48:29] get into the water i don't care if it
[1:48:31] froze over break the ice get me in the
[1:48:34] water it can't contain this fire i got
[1:48:36] fire shut up in my bowls why because the
[1:48:39] almighty living god has breathed the
[1:48:41] breath of life upon me and just like
[1:48:43] adam my toes were stuck down in the mud
[1:48:46] my arms were stuck out and i was dead
[1:48:48] but the breath of god breathed upon me
[1:48:51] and made me a quickening spirit now the
[1:48:53] fire is shut up in my bones and the
[1:48:56] inspiration is struck
[1:48:58] oh hallelujah
[1:49:01] praise this wonderful name
[1:49:05] you've got it
[1:49:09] look you possess something church
[1:49:13] you possess something
[1:49:15] there's a the where the
[1:49:18] there's a revelation that starts to
[1:49:19] influence the way you live
[1:49:21] amen believe our our
[1:49:23] pastor said something along those lines
[1:49:28] look you're the royal seed of abraham
[1:49:32] now think of abraham abraham received a
[1:49:34] promise
[1:49:35] right he called those things that were
[1:49:38] not
[1:49:39] as though they were
[1:49:44] when the inspiration strikes now listen
[1:49:46] to this
[1:49:48] the inspiration

[1:54:20] sounds good i like it
[1:54:25] john being the type of the bride
[1:54:30] all sudden some inspiration shrug john
[1:54:33] john wasn't no cold formal
[1:54:36] backslidden believer
[1:54:39] john was signing and crying for the
[1:54:40] abominations of the world
[1:54:42] john was sorrow john was wondering oh my
[1:54:45] everything's lost oh if somebody's not
[1:54:47] able to take this book oh here we are
[1:54:50] and ladies see there's been a revival
[1:54:52] sweep the land and no there's not even
[1:54:54] anybody to respond to it what is going
[1:54:57] on the world's going to complete dark
[1:55:00] apostasy they've come to cadis barnea
[1:55:03] and the whole church world has rejected
[1:55:06] christ the word and now christ is on the
[1:55:09] outside of the church he can't even get
[1:55:11] back in why the seed has been
[1:55:13] excommunicated
[1:55:15] from the shack christ is on the outside
[1:55:17] what does all this mean oh don't we john
[1:55:20] the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:55:23] prevailed come out of heaven ye my
[1:55:25] people don't be a partaker ever plagues
[1:55:28] this is me christ the mighty angel i
[1:55:31] have descended i have taken the book i
[1:55:34] have opened what do you see in there
[1:55:37] that's your name
[1:55:39] that's your name oh and all the heaven
[1:55:43] heard i john sand
[1:55:45] blessing and honor and glory forever and
[1:55:49] ever to him that sitteth on the throne
[1:55:53] john saw his name in there the
[1:55:55] inspiration struck john the revelation
[1:55:58] came oh john fell down oh and worshipped
[1:56:02] the prophet of god said when the seals
[1:56:05] opened up everything became worshipped
[1:56:08] that's why when the bride of christ gets
[1:56:09] together there ought to be some worship
[1:56:11] in the house of god there ought to be
[1:56:13] some people that can lift up their voice
[1:56:15] because the inspiration the breath of
[1:56:18] god has struck the seed and brought it
[1:56:20] to life
[1:56:22] oh hallelujah
[1:56:25] praise his wonderful name
[1:56:28] i don't know what y'all keep doing to me
[1:56:30] but i am not even
[1:56:32] lord help us
[1:56:36] oh my
[1:56:39] lady you'll see it wants to influence
[1:56:40] you

[1:56:45] there's another inspiration don't you
[1:56:48] oh thank you lord
[1:56:50] don't you realize that's the cheap
[1:56:52] musician's trick
[1:56:56] all that stuff you're you're following
[1:56:59] it's a cheap musician's trick
[1:57:01] even your careers and everything
[1:57:05] i'm just going to say it
[1:57:07] we're either playing church or
[1:57:11] that's all ladies it's a bunch of cheap
[1:57:14] musician tricks
[1:57:16] trying
[1:57:17] to imitate or vindicate themselves
[1:57:20] that they got something to
[1:57:22] oh yeah you got the message of the hour
[1:57:24] we got this
[1:57:26] oh yeah
[1:57:27] we got this
[1:57:29] right that's all that all that stuff
[1:57:30] you're looking at and feeding on and and
[1:57:32] all this social media and everything
[1:57:33] that's pretty now like i said i've had
[1:57:35] this talk with some of you look when
[1:57:37] when we stand up we're a little
[1:57:38] disconnected in that regards i i've had
[1:57:40] a few years go by
[1:57:42] if you're keeping track of
[1:57:46] well
[1:57:46] worldly friends we talk about that
[1:57:49] but i'll say this
[1:57:51] those are worldly devices
[1:57:53] the bible says no weapon formed against
[1:57:54] you shall prosper
[1:57:57] there was a weapon that was formed
[1:57:58] against david
[1:57:59] called goliath sword
[1:58:02] if you're going to be using the weapons
[1:58:03] of the world take the devil's head off
[1:58:04] with it
[1:58:06] please
[1:58:07] if you got social media if you got
[1:58:09] snapchat
[1:58:10] let them know that god sent a prophet
[1:58:13] let them know you've been changed
[1:58:16] because if you're not doing that you're
[1:58:17] just like peter sitting around a
[1:58:18] campfire just sitting around snapchat
[1:58:20] saying i don't know who the lord is
[1:58:23] when there's christians out there
[1:58:25] denominational worlds with good hearts
[1:58:27] that are just walking up to people in
[1:58:29] gas stations and saying can i pray for
[1:58:30] you they don't know they just know they
[1:58:32] want to do something for god there's
[1:58:33] people going on missionary trips and
[1:58:35] preaching the gospel and here we got the
[1:58:37] greatest treasure that's ever struck the
[1:58:39] face of the earth and we're about to
[1:58:41] selfish
[1:58:42] hoarding all to ourselves us for and no
[1:58:45] more and you can't have what i got the
[1:58:47] truth of the matter is is you don't have
[1:58:49] what you think you got
[1:58:52] that's
[1:58:53] the truth
[1:58:55] because if the inspiration ever strikes
[1:58:57] you that you're forgiven
[1:59:00] you don't have to live like that anymore
[1:59:03] you're free
[1:59:04] you're delivered
[1:59:06] oh glory to god there's an inspiration
[1:59:08] of the holy ghost that'll strike you in
[1:59:10] your soul that when you see somebody
[1:59:12] else in bondage when you see somebody
[1:59:14] else that doesn't have victory in their
[1:59:16] life there's an inspiration that says oh
[1:59:18] my son oh my daughter let me tell you
[1:59:21] about the grace of god there's an
[1:59:23] inspiration there's a fire because the
[1:59:26] breath of god has breathed on me and he
[1:59:28] has set me free oh i told you this is
[1:59:31] about worship let me worship my king let
[1:59:33] me worship my savior i'm like john oh
[1:59:36] blessings and honor and glory forever
[1:59:39] and not just in my word only
[1:59:43] in my life
[1:59:45] in my deeds
[1:59:47] in my home
[1:59:49] at my job
[1:59:51] to my wife
[1:59:52] to my children
[1:59:54] in the gas station
[1:59:56] at my work
[1:59:58] because it's no longer i that liveth
[2:00:02] it's christ
[2:00:04] that liveth in me
[2:00:06] we're just gonna have to have a part two
[2:00:07] because
[2:00:09] oh if you only knew what god had for you
[2:00:12] i feel like i at least got to give a
[2:00:15] a prelude
[2:00:18] we talked about them four messengers
[2:00:21] a lie who being the type of christ
[2:00:23] right
[2:00:25] were four death messengers that tore
[2:00:27] down the bride tree
[2:00:29] there were four life messengers that
[2:00:30] built it back up
[2:00:33] oh my
[2:00:35] oh my
[2:00:39] i know we have a couple baptisms it's 11
[2:00:41] 58.
[2:00:43] we usually get out of one out of round
[2:00:45] one so i believe we're going to be
[2:00:46] getting out early anyways
[2:00:48] how's everybody feeling
[2:00:51] praise god
[2:00:52] hallelujah we'll be calling for the
[2:00:54] musician shortly
[2:00:58] oh my
[2:01:01] you know we're just speaking about this
[2:01:05] y'all stop pulling it'll be easier to
[2:01:07] close
[2:01:09] hallelujah well glory to god i feel good
[2:01:14] oh my isn't it good to be free
[2:01:17] if you would have seen me out in the
[2:01:19] world i acted a fool you'd have seen me
[2:01:22] out in the world you know what i wanted
[2:01:24] everybody in the world to have what i
[2:01:25] had
[2:01:27] oh i could tell you some stories
[2:01:30] it was a perverted expression
[2:01:32] but if i found something that was
[2:01:34] intoxicating
[2:01:36] try this
[2:01:38] jackson i got the good stuff
[2:01:40] it will light you up
[2:01:43] i'm telling you what it'll take you from
[2:01:45] where you're sitting
[2:01:47] and it will totally totally warp your
[2:01:49] brain you won't even know where you're
[2:01:51] at
[2:01:52] brother matthew you're being worldly
[2:01:54] well you know what
[2:01:56] i was searching for something
[2:02:00] i had heard
[2:02:01] of the
[2:02:02] message but i didn't get filled with the
[2:02:05] message
[2:02:06] so the devil had some substitutes to
[2:02:08] offer me
[2:02:10] sin is pleasurable for a season
[2:02:13] sin will take you further than you want
[2:02:16] to go
[2:02:17] when i was living in those pleasures for
[2:02:19] a season
[2:02:20] i wanted my buddies to experience it my
[2:02:22] buddies wanted me to experience what i
[2:02:23] had
[2:02:25] well hey the natural types of spiritual
[2:02:31] when i finally got the real stuff
[2:02:33] and look
[2:02:34] let me say it like this because there's
[2:02:36] somebody here that it'll speak to
[2:02:38] and you forgive me but when you've come
[2:02:40] from a certain
[2:02:42] what way you can minister to people that
[2:02:43] come from a certain way
[2:02:46] but we used to look for what we called
[2:02:47] the good stuff
[2:02:48] that lasted the longest
[2:02:51] that you wouldn't come down from
[2:02:53] and the only way i can explain it to
[2:02:54] certain people out of the world i say
[2:02:56] hey man imagine taking your favorite
[2:02:57] thing and never coming down
[2:02:59] and it being a billion times better
[2:03:02] so once i got the holy ghost
[2:03:04] i've been on a high and i've never come
[2:03:06] down
[2:03:07] in my lowest valleys i've still been
[2:03:09] highest than my highest high as a center
[2:03:12] i've been lifted up so high in heavenly
[2:03:14] places if there's a little nip down or a
[2:03:16] little tucked down i'm still seated in
[2:03:18] heavenly places in christ jesus nothing
[2:03:21] can pluck me out of the palm of his hand
[2:03:23] i'm safe and secure and i know what i'm
[2:03:25] talking about because the inspiration
[2:03:27] the breath of god struck me and it set
[2:03:30] me free
[2:03:32] moving towards a close just speaking
[2:03:33] along the lines of that inspiration
[2:03:36] you know
[2:03:37] that whole uh inspiration and fluids
[2:03:40] of things out there in the world to be
[2:03:42] successful you know i was thinking about
[2:03:44] this you know it's it's just speaking of
[2:03:46] the natural
[2:03:47] type in the spiritual
[2:03:49] you know it's amazing how we can get
[2:03:50] inspired to do something
[2:03:53] everybody anybody ever been inspired to
[2:03:55] do something
[2:03:56] i'm gonna start working out
[2:03:59] and i mean it's you're for real no you
[2:04:02] don't mean you don't you wanna know how
[2:04:03] for real i am
[2:04:05] i just bought a set of rubber bands for
[2:04:06] fifteen hundred dollars
[2:04:08] that's how real i am
[2:04:12] i just bought a lifetime membership for
[2:04:14] ten dollars a month
[2:04:16] at lifetime fitness
[2:04:18] well if you could do that that would
[2:04:19] actually be cool
[2:04:23] oh but i'm serious i'm motivated
[2:04:27] i'm inspired watch me now
[2:04:30] yeah you watch you for a little bit
[2:04:34] but you know
[2:04:35] it's amazing to me how in the moment
[2:04:37] just like peter
[2:04:38] right in the moment
[2:04:40] in the moment lord i die for you
[2:04:42] i believe this message with all my heart
[2:04:44] i went to camp
[2:04:46] i went to the prayer line
[2:04:49] i got inspired
[2:04:50] watch me now devil
[2:04:53] you better know what you're talking
[2:04:54] about
[2:04:56] cause there's a big
[2:04:57] target on your back
[2:04:59] well i i had you okay i had you while
[2:05:01] you you were entertaining all this other
[2:05:03] stuff but you think you got something
[2:05:05] let me see what you're really made of
[2:05:07] oh you're all inspired and you're all
[2:05:10] enthused lord i'll die for you i'll go
[2:05:13] but it struck me i was like it's amazing
[2:05:16] how inspired you can be to do something
[2:05:19] and then that same thing is so
[2:05:21] uninspiring
[2:05:25] like did i want to get up at six in the
[2:05:27] morning go work out
[2:05:29] who wants to do that
[2:05:33] a cup of coffee and a a scone sounds
[2:05:36] awesome
[2:05:39] it's like sometimes i'm like
[2:05:41] forget that why would you do that to
[2:05:43] yourself
[2:05:45] and something that you were so fired up
[2:05:48] about
[2:05:49] you're so enthused about it and it was
[2:05:52] so tangible
[2:05:54] you could you could see it you could
[2:05:55] taste it you saw the pathway you saw
[2:05:59] the vision of it but you know what you
[2:06:00] didn't have you only had mechanics
[2:06:05] follow me now
[2:06:08] you only had mechanics
[2:06:10] you might have had some
[2:06:14] thought process about it
[2:06:16] but no power
[2:06:18] to fulfill it
[2:06:20] so we talked about peter a little bit
[2:06:22] and i was just thinking about that
[2:06:24] we've we've been fellowshipping around
[2:06:26] the dynamics and the mechanics
[2:06:28] see peter wanted to go but peter wasn't
[2:06:30] ready
[2:06:32] peter wanted to die for the lord
[2:06:35] but he didn't have the power to die for
[2:06:37] the lord
[2:06:40] and that's why
[2:06:41] jesus prayed for him
[2:06:44] and
[2:06:45] peter denied him three times
[2:06:51] you know how troubled peter must have
[2:06:52] been
[2:06:55] he knew he wanted to serve god he knew
[2:06:58] he was called
[2:06:59] look you know you're called
[2:07:02] stop stop worrying about that
[2:07:04] you didn't call yourself
[2:07:06] god called you
[2:07:08] so
[2:07:10] stop that
[2:07:11] you're elected you're called
[2:07:13] you're chosen
[2:07:15] but you're having a hard time the lord
[2:07:17] knows
[2:07:20] lord knew peter was having a hard time
[2:07:24] that's why before he left he sat down
[2:07:25] with peter and said peter do you love me
[2:07:28] lord i love you
[2:07:31] he was giving peter an opportunity
[2:07:34] to make up for those three times he
[2:07:35] didn't
[2:07:40] then he told peter peter
[2:07:43] do you love me
[2:07:44] peter said lord i love you he said feed
[2:07:47] my sheep
[2:07:49] yes on that third time
[2:07:52] imagine it was the hardest cause
[2:07:54] peter knew in his heart he wanted to
[2:07:56] serve god
[2:07:59] he tried everything
[2:08:01] he was so inspired many times only to
[2:08:03] come up short
[2:08:05] lord i'll go with you to death and then
[2:08:07] i denied him three times
[2:08:13] lord you know i love you
[2:08:15] you know everything
[2:08:18] or do you know all my weaknesses you
[2:08:19] know all my sin lord but one thing you
[2:08:21] know
[2:08:23] i want to serve you
[2:08:30] jesus looked at him and he started to
[2:08:32] tell him
[2:08:35] what you wanted to do
[2:08:37] in that upper room
[2:08:40] you're going to do
[2:08:43] you're going to spread forth your arms
[2:08:47] you're going to fulfill that desire
[2:08:48] because there's going to be a dynamics
[2:08:50] come upon your life peter
[2:08:52] that's going to change the world
[2:08:57] it reminds me of jesus breathing on them
[2:08:59] said receive ye the holy ghost
[2:09:02] i believe there's an inspiration as the
[2:09:03] musicians come
[2:09:07] to strike your heart this morning
[2:09:12] you know where you're living at
[2:09:16] many of us have the mechanics but we
[2:09:17] haven't gotten the dynamics
[2:09:20] it's like
[2:09:22] it's like you want to go fishing and you
[2:09:24] ain't got no fishing pole
[2:09:26] you ain't got no boat you ain't got no
[2:09:27] bait somebody
[2:09:29] the lord will furnish you everything you
[2:09:31] need
[2:09:35] god will set all that in order
[2:09:38] you just need to surrender your heart
[2:09:39] just give me a moment real quick
[2:09:44] that's what the prophet said earlier
[2:09:45] said when all the mechanics are ready
[2:09:49] and let the inspiration drop in and then
[2:09:51] nothing can change your mind
[2:09:54] you got it
[2:09:56] i want to speak to you in the name of
[2:09:58] the lord
[2:09:59] you're not waiting for victory
[2:10:02] you have the victory
[2:10:07] faith
[2:10:09] already in his word already has you
[2:10:11] standing
[2:10:13] on the mountain
[2:10:14] you say i want to climb mount everest i
[2:10:16] want to go up there well that's a
[2:10:18] process
[2:10:19] but if that inspiration can never drop
[2:10:21] into your heart by faith you call those
[2:10:23] things that are not as though they are
[2:10:25] and you already have the victory
[2:10:31] maybe you can
[2:10:33] play draw me
[2:10:35] draw me lord
[2:10:36] keep f
[2:10:39] maybe we'll just stand to change your
[2:10:40] position
[2:11:03] prophet of god said and i have heard but
[2:11:05] now i see he said no matter how
[2:11:06] religious you are
[2:11:09] how many churches you belong to how many
[2:11:11] books your name's on
[2:11:13] if that genuine holy ghost is in you
[2:11:15] which is this word manifested
[2:11:18] you'll see the message of the hour
[2:11:21] because it's the holy ghost that does it
[2:11:25] but there has to be something like that
[2:11:27] off
[2:11:28] inspiration strike you
[2:11:31] and if there's if
[2:11:33] if you pour water on the ground
[2:11:36] on the ground and there's no seed in
[2:11:38] there to strike it
[2:11:40] how can it ever bring forth anything
[2:11:45] there's nothing to bring forth
[2:11:47] that is that only
[2:11:50] the elected
[2:11:51] of god
[2:11:53] will see it
[2:11:56] i want to tell you this morning that
[2:11:57] it's not your inspiration
[2:12:00] peter's inspiration failed
[2:12:03] our inspiration many times has failed
[2:12:06] but when it's the inspiration of the
[2:12:08] word in you
[2:12:10] that gene seed of god inspiration that
[2:12:13] he placed inside of you when that
[2:12:15] inspiration lines up with the
[2:12:17] inspiration of the word
[2:12:19] then something gots to shake
[2:12:21] something got to take place because it's
[2:12:23] not your inspiration
[2:12:25] it's his inspiration and that's what
[2:12:26] this message is doing that's what god is
[2:12:28] wanting to do he's wanting to open up
[2:12:30] your understanding he's wanting to
[2:12:33] inspire you and when that inspiration
[2:12:35] strikes you
[2:12:37] then the message becomes tangible
[2:12:40] then it becomes a reality
[2:12:42] then it becomes flesh
[2:12:44] in you
[2:12:47] draw
[2:12:49] me

[2:26:12] happy to be here today with you there's
[2:26:15] two baptisms the
[2:26:17] lord just so graciously opened up a door
[2:26:20] for other cars for myself and some other
[2:26:22] brothers in the church to be able to
[2:26:25] go over to dallas probably almost on a
[2:26:27] weekly basis not sometimes we skip a
[2:26:30] little bit but almost weekly basis to
[2:26:32] speak with a few people just giving them
[2:26:34] the gospel
[2:26:35] tend to do some of their needs and just
[2:26:37] being a friend to them and taking the
[2:26:39] gospel to them
[2:26:40] and
[2:26:41] you know what happens when you go and
[2:26:43] shine the gospel light
[2:26:45] there's a seed of god in that vessel
[2:26:47] there
[2:26:48] forces it to life
[2:26:50] just like the sun and the springtime
[2:26:52] shining upon the earth it brings all
[2:26:54] that grass and the trees and everything
[2:26:55] to life it can't help itself right
[2:26:57] conditions it comes to life
[2:27:00] and just so wonderfully one of uh
[2:27:02] a couple of them
[2:27:04] just the gospel light shining upon them
[2:27:06] they
[2:27:07] they heard and now they believe
[2:27:10] repented of their sins and now see the
[2:27:12] need for baptism
[2:27:14] so one of the one of the precious souls
[2:27:16] who who has made this wonderful glorious
[2:27:18] decision is uh
[2:27:19] her name is maria
[2:27:21] and uh if she would like give her a few
[2:27:22] moments to uh to testify would you like
[2:27:25] to
[2:27:26] see don't have to
[2:27:28] okay all right so that's all right so
[2:27:30] you know how it is it could be he said
[2:27:32] that he could be the voice he whispered
[2:27:36] i don't know it's okay uh so yeah no so
[2:27:39] we understand a little bit of shyness
[2:27:41] there but that's fine so we're just so
[2:27:43] grateful and thankful for uh
[2:27:47] the light shining upon the seed and them
[2:27:48] recognizing the believing and
[2:27:50] recognizing what they must do
[2:27:52] so we'll read the scripture here
[2:27:54] uh acts 2 30 uh chapter 2 verses 37-39
[2:27:59] it says
[2:28:00] now when they heard this they were
[2:28:02] pricked in their heart and said unto
[2:28:04] peter and to the rest of the apostles
[2:28:06] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:28:09] to stop right there why was their heart
[2:28:11] pricked because the word had gone forth
[2:28:13] it dealt with their hearts and their
[2:28:15] hearts were pricked not to resist the
[2:28:18] gospel but tricks like
[2:28:19] i want to be right with god
[2:28:22] so that's what's happened with the
[2:28:23] people who come with us today their
[2:28:25] hearts were pricked and so you know what
[2:28:29] i want to be a daughter of god
[2:28:31] god has brought me to life
[2:28:34] but there's a process
[2:28:36] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:28:38] baptized every one of you in the name of
[2:28:40] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[2:28:43] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:28:45] holy ghost
[2:28:47] for the promise is unto you and to your
[2:28:49] children and to all that are far off
[2:28:52] even as many as the lord our god shall
[2:28:54] call
[2:29:00] so maria upon the confession of your
[2:29:03] faith
[2:29:04] that you have repented of your sins and
[2:29:06] that you recognize you must be baptized
[2:29:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:29:11] upon this confession of your faith we
[2:29:13] baptize you in the name of the lord
[2:29:15] jesus christ
[2:29:18] [Applause]
[2:29:39] so
[2:29:41] we have second baptism today so maria i
[2:29:44] gotta turn around before i get nervous
[2:29:47] sorry she gets a little bit nervous when
[2:29:49] there's a lot of people and if you've
[2:29:51] ever stood on this in before you could
[2:29:52] definitely understand there's a lot of
[2:29:55] faces looking back at you
[2:29:57] but
[2:29:58] but she's the second one
[2:30:00] patricia and actually brother costa and
[2:30:02] myself have actually uh known patricia
[2:30:04] for some time from from another spot we
[2:30:06] used to be at
[2:30:08] and she's
[2:30:10] didn't reject what we had to say very
[2:30:12] kind and very receptive to it and
[2:30:14] actually there's a lot of the word that
[2:30:15] she does know for being in church and
[2:30:17] whatnot
[2:30:18] but we kept showing up kept presenting
[2:30:21] the gospel not pushing and what not then
[2:30:23] two the light of the gospel pierced
[2:30:26] right through the darkness through her
[2:30:27] soul she said you know what i i
[2:30:28] recognize too that i need to be baptized
[2:30:31] that's the right thing to do
[2:30:33] and patricia because of that
[2:30:35] you're fulfilling a promise in the word
[2:30:38] that when you are
[2:30:39] repent and you are baptized in this name
[2:30:41] then there's a promise and it's the
[2:30:43] destiny of a person who fulfills that
[2:30:45] scripture being filled with the holy
[2:30:47] ghost
[2:30:47] so before we uh before we go on would
[2:30:49] you like to testify okay
[2:30:52] you've been my voice no i didn't okay
[2:30:54] she's a bit nervous so i'll repeat what
[2:30:57] she wants to say
[2:30:58] i know the devil took all my memories
[2:31:01] she said i am she said i know the devil
[2:31:03] took all the memories of who i am but
[2:31:05] he's never been able to take my bond
[2:31:08] with jesus but he's never been able to
[2:31:10] take my bond with jesus and my vow even
[2:31:12] though i don't remember completely
[2:31:14] and my vow even though i don't remember
[2:31:16] completely
[2:31:17] and i know that a few times i put that
[2:31:19] hammer on him this lifetime but i don't
[2:31:22] know how many lifetimes i've had before
[2:31:24] because it's completely blunted
[2:31:26] but one thing he forgets he keeps
[2:31:29] underestimating me and me and god laugh
[2:31:31] once again
[2:31:33] i
[2:31:34] will die for jesus i will die for god
[2:31:38] i researched research
[2:31:41] found my own knowledge and i found out
[2:31:42] there's several different levels of the
[2:31:44] soulmate
[2:31:46] leading all the way up to the almighty
[2:31:48] and that's where my bond and promise and
[2:31:50] value is and i will go back to him if i
[2:31:52] have to but damn with the
[2:31:54] devil amen all right
[2:31:56] i think they heard them bless you yeah i
[2:31:58] think they did too
[2:32:01] face the fears
[2:32:02] cross your arms

[2:32:07] faith that you repented of your sins and
[2:32:10] you recognize that you must be baptized
[2:32:12] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
