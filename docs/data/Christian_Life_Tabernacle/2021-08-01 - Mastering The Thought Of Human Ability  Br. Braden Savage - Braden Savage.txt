when you don't have to stand we'll just read it together this is the blessing that our brothers would like to be upon his son so i don't we just we can just read this and and as we read it let's read it like a prayer it says i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my hell my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade on thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the

place him into your hands today that you will keep them in jesus name we pray amen they don't know about me amen praise the lord this morning amen we have a special uh ministering visitor with us today and i'm so happy to have him with braden savage and i knew braden's grandfather he was a a friend of mine and then i knew his dad and now it's amazing to me to see that we've been down life's

can greet you this morning there they are back there god bless you nice to have them and uh to be with us it is it's just uh amazing to see from where we started and from where we've come but it's not about where we've come from it's where we're going that's important and that we're on this journey and and our brother's here to help us along that way so let's stand this morning and and just seeing amazing grace how sweet the sound because that's what's brought us this far we've made it i i look back and i believe i i meant his grandfather back in 1970 was when we met and uh his granddad was always a friend of mine and then his his dad became a friend of mine the whole family's had a wonderful testimony and now i know granddad would be proud standing in the pulpit preaching this great

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we [Music] and when we first can we sing amazing grace [Music] thank you father [Music] together this morning man you have a need upon your heart you want to just raise your hand and say lord i need you to just come by my way this morning amen i believe he's the special guest here there's no big ones or little ones among us here but there is one big one and his name is jesus i believe he's in this place this morning let's just pray father we humbly come before you this morning as we stand here before this sacred desk lord behind it and lord look out and see the purchase of your blood father lord how much greater it is lord to be able to preach to the purchase of your blood than to have an actual jar of your own literal blood father it's it's greater to see the purchase what you purchased with your blood father here this morning and we just we're just it's just an honor lord to stand here we asked father that you would just move in a special way today father that you would take our thoughts captivate every thought every idea everything lord that that that is human about his father which we're all human but lord just take it all father may lord we it all come through the filter of the holy spirit this morning and father may you minister to your to your people this morning as i've often said lord i remind myself every time lord did i step out lord that lord anybody can gather quotes together in scriptures and and get together a sermon lord but we want more than a sermon this morning lord we want your spirit lord to have control so we're asking you to come and do what only you can do father lord and that is to discern every heart father by the preaching of the word may you just move father lord maybe there's things lord on on your people's hearts this morning lord that they've been praying about questions lord that they need answered father may your holy spirit begin to deal with that situation and begin to move all the doubt and all the fear away father that you could just come in and bring freedom to him lord we pray we just commit ourselves to you commit this congregation into your hands now where we ask these things in the lovely name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you this morning certainly is a privilege to be here amen in texas with you to preach the word of the lord and we certainly uh got to meet brother david i don't know three or four months ago and and actually i actually met him for the first time at brother harold brown's funeral and then he come up and preached a meeting there at my at our pastors at our church here brother ivey's uh in missouri and uh got to talk and just i've always respected brother david loved his ministry and and just a special person you have a wonderful pastor amen and i know you know that this morning so amen we'll just get right into the word of the lord if you'll turn with me to hebrews chapter 11. we'll start with verse 32. we'll read two verses there and then we'll turn over to second corinthians chapter 12. i certainly don't come with any new revelation this morning i i don't have none of that and i certainly don't come to preach to you anything that you haven't already heard but we just want to stir up our minds by the way of remembrance this morning amen that something something might just draw us closer to him amen and and i always try to uh find something that that will help me too because if i can't if i can't be helped by what the lord has given me then i know it won't help you so we have to uh we have to put ourselves in this in these uh in this message so i certainly certainly uh certainly am speaking to myself this morning and the things that i want to speak on today uh i've been studying on and been thinking about for quite some time now and preached at home on it several times and different different uh titles and different things but yet it's just something that's been on my heart i think some a place that we need to be as christians and believers as as we're maturing in the word i think it's time that uh you know that we just don't stay down here no more but it's time to come up here so may the lord just bless you this morning and help me and calm my nerves this morning i'm not used to standing in this in front of this many people so i'm a little nervous this morning so you just bear with me this morning hebrews chapter 11 start with verse 32 and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barrick of samson and japheth david also and samuel and of the prophets who who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions they quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword how did they do it out of weakness were made strong waxed violent in flight turned the turn to flight the armies of the aliens now turn with me to second corinthians chapter 12. we'll start with verse 1. and we'll just read down through about verse 10 and have your seats this morning paul's speaking here he says it is not expedient which that word means profitable it's not profitable for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for man to utter of such a one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in my infirmities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear for bear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh messenger from satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me my what is what a statement and he said unto me the the the lord spoke to him and said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore oh that what what the lord spoke to him changed his whole attitude he said therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities and persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong may god bless his word you can be seated this morning i could say this morning that paul he had found the key that unlocked the power of god being able to work through all mankind amen and i want to title the message this morning mastering the thought of human ability i believe er to me one of the greatest messages that our messenger to this age ever preached was was a message called perfect strength by perfect weakness amen and you know uh people there's a lot of people that might uh turn me off on this what uh what i'm fixing to say but but just follow me here this morning as we go through this you know the seals were great messages and uh some of the most anointing uh messages that was ever preached was the seals how many can say amen to that amen they were wonderful messages and we needed them amen we we we needed all those loose sins that the prophet of god talked about we needed uh we needed all those things we needed all those things amen to come together and know the real truth about them amen and it took those seals the breaking of those seals to to to see all those things but but to to me one of the greatest messages that he ever spoke was perfect strength by perfect weakness amen and you know you can roll these things over and over in your mind again but let's just look at how brother branham approach these seven seals and we can we can see amen where i'm going with this this morning amen before he before he started the seven seals amen and the breach he comes out and he preaches a message called amen he preaches a message and i just went back he he preaches a message called god hidden in simplicity amen why would he come out right before these great supernatural seals amen and preach his message god hiding himself in simplicity and then when the seals were all over he comes right back again amen and preaches the same message again god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same way amen so he's he's showing us something amen that that to be able to receive amen what the seals was bringing forth amen we were going to have to get ourselves in a place amen to be able to receive what god was trying to tell us amen that that we can't we can't come amen to god and receive revelation amen thinking that we're somebody special or or that we've got uh some great revelation or that we're a great preacher or we're a great a song leader or we're a great this that or the other or that we're just in the message hey man bless god i'm favored among all people no friends we're only favored among amen the world amen because god's grace amen that drop down in our lives that's the only reason that we're favored among people amen mary amen the angel spoke to her and said you're highly favored married amen but it wasn't nothing that mary done amen but it was god's choosing amen that made her highly favored and it's god's choosing amen that god allowed us to to be able to sit here this morning amen in a message church in a message pew and be able to hear amen a divine word from god amen speak directly to our hearts amen it's not nothing that we done so why should we boast amen within ourselves but it's the grace of god that's been given to us amen in that we boast but we don't boast within ourselves amen so he was trying to get a point across amen to the people that that in jesus's day amen god bypassed the nobles that that thought they knew amen the word they they studied the scrolls day in the pharisees they they they were great religious leaders and you know as far as they're outside you couldn't put a you couldn't put a pen upon them nowhere because they were perfect they lived right they were they were holy on the inside on the on the outside but jesus said but on the inside you're full of dead man bones amen so god doesn't necessarily see amen what's on the outside but he sees what's in the heart amen of man and that's what he judges amen every one of us by this morning amen is what's in our heart amen but he didn't come to those religious leaders amen in that day that that thought they knew it all he bypassed the nobles he bypassed all those amen but he come to those who were rejected and cast out amen there was nothing in the world amen i think of it church amen that you think of mary magdalene who had seven devils amen it was and was possessed with devils you think of legion amen that jesus would go all the way across the sea amen to save one's soul amen i tell you church he didn't come to the high and mighties he come to those who needed him he come to those amen who were nothing within ourselves nothing of this world those are who he come to oh just let me be one of those this morning don't don't let me be one of those amen in the ma in our own ranks you know and this is what's on my heart here this morning amen and so so please don't take offense to to these things but let's just open up our hearts this morning and and see what god has for us you know i believe that if the prophet of god was standing here today amen and preaching that he would not have to be he wouldn't be hammering the pentecostals anymore he wouldn't be hammering the baptist in the nominal world no more but he would be having to deal with his own issues amen in the own ranks of the message of the hour amen because amen let's be honest with ourselves church amen we have received a message amen as paul received a message amen and we've been lifted up into a sphere amen that may be no other denomination has ever been lifted up to amen no other pentecostal church has ever been lifted up to and it's so easy amen for us to get puffed up but god can't deal with us when we're puffed up he can't deal with us even when we're all about ourselves i go to the greatest church in the message i go to this church i believe this if you don't see it my way then you're out of the message god don't come to those kind of people he comes to those who are rejected and who realize they're nothing that's the kind of people he comes to amen so i've been been studying this and to me it's just it's just outstanding that god would do these things and brother branham says this and this is where i got the the the title from he said there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life amen how many here desires amen to fulfill god's desire in your own life amen we all are here this morning and we all have a purpose amen that god brought us to this world for it's more than your natural job it's more than maybe just raising your natural family but god's got us here for a specific reason for a specific purpose amen and he wants to see his own desires amen fulfilled through you and i this morning so he says there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability oh and he goes on and he says if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way amen that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that god can use us now brother branham in this message you'll find if you go back and you listen to it brother branham used dwight moody in this and he began to talk about dwight moody how he was ignorant he was unlearned amen he was insignificant in itself but brother branham put him in with god one of god's heroes and he said he was god's hero and he said but but if dwight moody amen you know they got the moody college out there they got the wesleyan college they got the lutheran college he said but you know he said if dwight moody would come back from the grave and come back amen the first thing he would do is get rid of the moody college so brother brandon goes on and he he explains it he talks it like he talks to to you like you know that that you know here this college is and he said dwight moody never started the college he was god's hero but it was the man after dwight moody left the scene amen they thought that they got to secure amen this great revelation amen that was brought through to what moody amen so they started a school they began to put their own ideas to it and god left them right then amen church i'm afraid amen in in our own ranks that if we're not careful amen ichabod will be rid over our hearts amen because we have let our intelligence take the place of spirit given revelation this is why this is why that men that have preached this gospel for years and all of a sudden they don't believe it no more they just turn away from it amen they don't even see it no why not in that way anymore and matter of fact now they're building their churches back amen from the people that that didn't go with them now they're building their churches back amen to disprove amen brother branham and the message of the hour it shows that and some of them amen they could preach you into a corner amen and they could preach like a house on fire in a windy day amen and they could teach it they could lay it out amen from genesis to revelations from 47 to 65 amen they could teach it the best to the best amen but it shows that all those years amen of learning it was nothing but head knowledge and never spirit given revelation if it was spirit given revelation it would change their lives it would have caused them to stay humble amen and dig deeper and deeper into the word of god something's lacking that i believe in my heart that needs to get back into the church again we've been on this road most of us now for many years myself i've i've i was raised in this message but there come a time that i needed an individual walk with god hey man i couldn't go on mama's religion no more i couldn't go on daddy's religion no more something had to change in my heart oh i could quote the scripture i could quote this i could quote the quotes even when i was lost amen but let me tell you there was nothing there to give life behind it amen and it's time that the word amen is not just in letter form no more but it is revealed and manifested through the hearts and lives of his people hey man moab most of us now has been on the road for many years and knowing what the message says is not something that we don't know is that right for most of us we know what the message says most everyone can pick a topic and the quotes begin immediately to come we can spit them out faster than a machine gun can or a copy or can copy them off on paper is that right brother branham said this and brother branham said that we can tell the day and the year amen and where he preached it at and whether it was the morning service or the evening service amen we can tell what city it was preached in we can tell all these things and what page and what paragraph in the seals book of the church age book amen but where is the life amen where is the grain today church amen it's not supposed to just stay in the word or letter form it's supposed to come out in the hearts and lives of the people you see it's become head knowledge instead of spirit given revelation and many times it's confused between the two let me tell you this the word is a living word amen the letter killeth the bible says but the spirit giveth life amen we're living in the time where the word must be on display it's not good enough to say i have the token it's not good enough to say yes it's here amen but it's time that it has to be on display back in the days of egypt amen when the death angel was fixing to pass by amen the angel of the lord told them they said kill the lamb amen prepare it amen and take the blood amen take the blood and put it over the doorpost amen of your home amen so what good would it have done for him to say i've got the word amen i've got the blood i believe i'll just leave it in the basin and inside the house the death angel would have came amen and killed amen the firstborn but the the blood had to be on display and the blood the bleeding word in this day has to be on display in our hearts amen it's got to be living manifesting itself through our very lives it's not good enough to be able to quote the message and the bible it must be able to live through us and we don't have to try we don't have to manufacture if god the holy spirit is on the inside of us and he's leading us and guiding us it will produce itself it will come out naturally we don't have to try to manufacture it a sheep is not ass amen to manufacture woe amen but he he brings forth wool because he is a sheep amen we are not ass amen you got to do this you got to do that you got to do this here and this over here amen because we are the blood-bought sons and daughters of god we bring forth the word because it's living bread to us it's inside of us and it's what we are it's hard to find people that you can just sit down and fellowship with and enjoy talking about the word without them saying oh i know that well i know that yeah yeah yeah yeah brother brown said this 1947 he said they know what brother brown said and they want you to know that they know what brother brown said they pride themselves with the fact that they know and it's confused with spirit given revelation i heard something brother biscuit said years ago that he made a statement that has stuck with me all these years he said god-given revelation will line up with the word and it will not exalt you and make you puffed up in yourselves amen it will actually humble you to where you realize you are nothing and true revelation that comes from god it never comes to a person unless it changes that person's life and i find that statement is very very scriptural amen paul we read from was a very educated man according to the church world paul had all the credentials hey man that he needed he could have went anywhere in the world and held a worldwide meeting because he had all the the religious sect backing him up he was a great man to the world he was taught by the best of the best teachers gamaya he knew all the greek meanings and was taught how to speak with great eloquence but when he was converted for god to be able to use him he had to lay every bit of education and every bit of human uh human ability aside or else god could not use him brother branham in this message he says i know this is an unusual title amongst pentecostal people he says because your you pentecost are always testifying how strong you are amen and i feel the same way today within our own ranks amen we pride ourselves that we're in the message but it's the message in you amen is the message living out through you amen you say you say well i'm in the message well that's great that's not a very good witnessing tool though because when you go out into the when you go out into dallas and fort worth area here amen and somebody says uh you look different uh uh tell me tell me tell me why you looked at it well god sent a prophet i'm in the message i go to brother david mcgary's church or i go to brother ivey's church in missouri what are you telling them people want to see a living god amen and you don't have to say many words when they see a living god amen what was the man that said amen preach always use words when necessary amen amen let my life ring out the life of jesus christ you say well i've messed up you know i i i i see where i didn't live out the life here i didn't live out the life here listen church we're humans we're humans and we're gonna have to deal with this human flesh until we leave this world amen amen but listen church amen what is your motive what is your desire that's down in the heart amen amen listen let me just tell you amen i've been thinking about this and and and studying on this as well amen do you realize that when noah amen here he was and he was floating along in 40 days the rain the rain came and it stopped and noah wanted to see you know if there was any land that he could that he could go out upon so he sends out two birds amen they roosted amen in the same room together think about it now amen one was a crow a raven and the other one was a dove amen they both roosted together they both heard noah preach and noah takes these two birds he sends out the raven and the raven never comes back now remember god totally utterly destroyed the earth he only saved noah in his family amen so there was dead bodies floating everywhere human bodies animal bodies amen that crow was having himself a jubilee he was having himself a time because not only could he eat on what noah was preaching but he could eat upon all the dead things of the world is that right amen so here this crow was he was having himself a jubilee but he sends out the dove but it wasn't long that the dove he came back to the ark amen amen why did he come back to the yard because he couldn't eat upon just anything he couldn't eat upon the dead caring of the world he had to come back and hear noah's food amen the revealed truth of the hour so let me tell you friends the dove represents the holy ghost amen living inside of us we may leave the ark amen temporarily we may have a fault here and a fault here we may backslide temporarily but we're coming back to the ark because god is living on the inside of us there's something in us that we can't feed upon the things of the world that we've got to come back to noah we've got to come back to what the revealed truth is speaking to our hearts we're not satisfied on a baptist denomination we're not satisfied upon message amen ideas and creeds we want to reveal truth of the word of the hour amen and we come back to that is that okay this morning i have family uncles they were raised in this message and you know they've been out of been out of church for a long time and i don't know seven or eight years ago they thought that they would try to get back in church so they go down to the baptist church or they join up with them hey man everything looks good for a while but all sudden they quit you know why because they know that that is not real food they see the deceitfulness just because they were grown up in it they know it's not for them amen there's something greater let me tell you here this morning there's something greater amen amen that we're feeding upon then what the world's got we're not waiting upon it it's here human ability if it was true revelation from god it would constantly humble a person hey man it would cause a person to realize they're nothing but dust amen god help me this morning brandon says now that's hard i know because we're always wanting to put our part in something we know something that we know that we want to do it say well i just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong and god will never use that effort maybe with the help of the lord we're going to get into that in a few minutes and just show you how god cannot use your ability he said that's the mat what's that's that's what's the matter with the world today there's too much seminary experiences too much placed upon education too much placed upon relationship or fellowship in denomination he says we rest one another or we rest on one another we rest upon men with ability we met we rest upon men with great ability well if i could just go here and be prayed for i know if so and so laid his hand on me i'll get well do you not believe church that the same god amen that parted the red sea amen for moses and they walked out on dry ground do you not believe that he's here with us this morning amen i believe that this morning i believe i'm looking at a group of believers that believes amen that if i'm driving to work in my truck amen and i have a need i can call out to god and he'll answer amen i don't have to have a special man to lay hands upon me we respect the ministry we we respect amen godly men we respect amen one another amen but we don't prefer one another brother branham even says that he said he says we rest upon one another we rest upon men with ability he said the bible says he says how can you have faith when you're preferring one another i believe that's found and i believe that is in first timothy 5 21 i believe he said how can we have faith when you're preferring one another when we are expecting saying this guy he's a great person he's a great person i'll just lean up on him he says that displeases god when you do that we must lean upon god and god alone amen we mustn't trust the ability of ourselves or anybody else we must completely yield to god amen the song it just stirred my heart as y'all were singing it before we come out amen i surrender i surrender that's what god wants us to do amen is a total surrender to him a total yielding to him he says if he's got something for us to do and as long as we feel that we're doing a pretty good job out of it then we'll never be able to be used of god this is what paul had to get rid of church he had to guard against it was his own human ability he was an educated man very eloquent but when god got a hold of him and he realized that all of his knowledge and all that he had learned it wasn't no good amen but notice what he says when god lifted him up he lifted him up into the third heavens think about this now because paul knew in himself that no man had ever been lifted up into the sphere of god that he had been allowed to go never but he said lest i be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations not just one revelation but the abundance which is many amen many revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh notice his flesh not his soul now but because his soul that's born again amen listen church a born-again person can't get puffed up in his soul absolutely not it's born again it's born of god but this flesh wants to get puffed up but a thorn in the flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me watch now why did the thorn come lest i should be exalted above measure oh my church he's saying i realize that god amen can't use my pride he can't use my my eloquent words he can't use amen the big person that i think i am he can't use none of that that's why he had to get it out of him god wants me weak in my human strength amen we sing the song i am weak but thou art strong jesus keep me from all wrong i'll be satisfied as long let me walk close to thee amen do you love him this morning i think of the story brother branham tells of mr read head that came to brother branham one day he'd received the holy ghost and he said brother branham he was a great educated man he said i have enough degrees brother branham to plaster your walls with he said i've got all these degrees but he says he breaks down and he says but where is god in all of it oh my what good is it church if we can quote the message from 47 to 65 if it's not in our heart i wonder no wonder why no wonder why people can't go any further because they're stuck right there and god can't deal with them as long as they're stuck in their own selves or they're relying upon some other man it's an individual affair moses was a man that thought he could do things with his own ability being raised in the palace is pharaoh's daughter's son he was taught in everything by the best of the best in battle he was trained by the best and he became the best why there wasn't nothing that could come before moses that he didn't know exactly how to handle and and deal with he was a great man there wasn't nothing in war when he went to go out to battle there wasn't no situation that moses did not know how to handle it wasn't a battle that he couldn't fight without winning he was a great man but one day one day he recognized amen that he was on the wrong side he began to recognize that the people amen that he was seeing being whipped and dying amen out there what pharaoh was calling the mud daubers he began to realize those are my people hey man we have the same blood those are my people and moses brother branham and i'm going to read it here in a minute he said brother he said moses went out to do the will of god to do a right thing and it was his time for him to do it and it was the will of god for him to do it but he went in his own ability and all he had to show for it was one dead egyptian my he says we know he was strong he was well trained so he took it upon himself seeing the need of the day oh may god let us let this sink home seeing the need of the day moses with his intellectual powers and his ability that he had to do it with he was a smart man he was he was the coming pharaoh he had psychology he had power he had physical strength he had everything so he said i am well equipped i know all of it oh my and if there's a man in the land that's able to do it i am so i'm the man of the hour so i'll step out and he went out to accomplish a work that was right and in the will of god and he offered his natural abilities and god refused it he couldn't use one thing moses had oh my paul in chapter in the chapter of heroes of faith hebrews 11 there where we where we read our text from verse 24 says by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter so he was recognizing his position look what he had to give up choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward now brother branham said now the scripture says the pleasures of sin for a season that's not just talking about amen immoral acts but moses's own human ability thinking that he is a great man that he's able to achieve amen what god wants him to do with his own human ability it was a great sin in that hour and i'll say it's a great sin in this hour if god couldn't use it then he can't use it now as it is today it's a sin it's an unholy thing amen listen church there's no great ones among us but jesus amen if it wasn't for him where would we all be tonight this morning the grace of god i tell you church i'm sure if we opened up testimony service hey man we would have some great things to tell of what god's brought us out of then where are we where do we come into the picture that we're something great the spirit it's a spirit that i want to stay as far away from as i possibly can brother branham when he would begin to speak on these things in this message he would say now i want you young preachers to especially listen close why would he why would he address young preachers because he wants them to understand listen it's not about you this is not about me this is not this is not about you it's about christ it's about what he's done for us amen and taking that word into our hearts and letting that word friends amen live out through us amen do you realize friends the very reason why amen that christ had to come to the cross and die on the cross amen and spill and his blood amen come forth from his body amen was that very life that lived in christ could come out of him and into a people that his very life could live again so we're doing ourselves a detriment when we when we feel like that we're something special because i'm in the message i hope this is okay it's just what's on my heart i've seen great men i've seen great men preach stand behind the pulpit could out preach me by by eons and eons if well however you want to say it and then walk out and gossip lie and run the people down tell me that's god there's something more hey amen there's something more that god wants from us he wants us to get ourselves out of the way that he can show us that more amen that he can bring himself in notice god allows moses now amen to try to do what was right and was the will of god with his own strength he lets god he lets moses try this amen and it took him doing it to see that his own great big powerful self amen amen here he was nothing and he was running for his life from egypt the greatest man now running for his life from egypt and he got back there on the back part of the desert found himself hurting just jethro's sheep i think of it what a demotion that was amen going from next in line to being pharaoh amen and now he's back there herding sheep but you see god was working something in moses that moses didn't know what was going on amen amen he needed to be on the backside of the desert amen for god to get moses where he was needing to be all the knowledge of egypt amen was drilled into moses for 40 years amen and when god got him out of egypt it took another 40 years to get all that out of him so at 80 years old god begins to use moses god i hope it don't take 80 years for me because i don't know if i'm going to be here every time i'm 80 years old come i'm just now almost 40. but you see church his human ability he had to get it out of him now just because he was in egypt to begin with doesn't mean he wasn't god's man to begin with god knows amen god knows and he knows what each and every one of us have to go through amen to get that human ability out amen whatever whatever thing that we've got in our lives amen that that that we need to get out amen god knows how to deal with that god knows what he's doing the quicker we can yield and surrender amen every fiber of our being to him amen the quicker he can fulfill his very word and desire through us amen notice now god wanted him on the backside of the desert i'm gonna i'm gonna hammer on this just for a few moments he he wanted him on the backside of that desert because he was right where god wanted him because after being on the backside of the desert 40 years one day he looked up and he seen a fire amen that that was in a bush and the bush wasn't being consumed and it caught his attention oh my it caught his attention and he said i got to go see what that is amen and let me just say this we all know the story amen but to save time let me just tell you amen when he got there amen what the burning bush had amen what moses has lacked the burning bush had amen it's what he needed all those years prior amen what the burning bush had is what moses needed amen when he come off the mountain the bible says that you could just see it on his face the glory of god amen he was a changed man amen now now when he was doing it in his own ability we find him running from egypt but now when he's not got no strength of his own and no no weakness and his weaknesses is all gone amen and all that is there and he realizes that he's nothing he comes back and he says i'm going to egypt amen what had changed the backside of the desert the pillar of fire changed him church we need that pillar of fire to change us amen not just on the surface amen but we need it in our hearts amen to come down in our hearts and say it's not me that runneth but it's christ amen that show is mercy it's christ that's doing the work through me hallelujah i like what he he's up there at the bush and god begins to speak out of the bush and moses he realizes in the presence of that pillar of fire and god he realizes i am nothing i thought i was something big i thought i was next in line for pharaoh but i'm nothing i wonder if that may be the case that we need to be in more in the presence of god or in the presence of our phones listen church i i can only speak what god lays upon my heart i hope that's okay but we need to be in the presence of god myself included is that okay amen amen as i said i can only preach amen what what what what helps me as well amen i want to be more in that presence i want god to fulfill his word through me i'm sick of myself i'm tired of myself i'm not satisfied with myself i want more of god there's something more that i'm hungry for there's something more that is in my heart that's crying out saying lord this can't be all of it this can't be all of it there's got to be more do you feel that cry do you feel that hunger amen something a deep calling to the deep let me tell you if there's a longing in your heart there's something out there to fulfill that longing hallelujah he says moses you're the man he said i have come down i've heard the cries of my people he said and i've come down amen to deliver him and i'm sending you moses what did moses begin to do he said that's god i'm the man no no he didn't do that no more he said oh god i can't talk i can't speak no excuses moses i've got you cured now i've got you where i want you he said i'm sending you down amen and what did he do he went down amen oh there was trial after trial but he knew god was with him hey man he didn't give up amen when pharaoh would come amen and do the very same thing amen that that moses would do amen pharaoh would come back and back it up amen but moses he didn't get discouraged he knew god had sent him he knew he was there on a mission and he wasn't given up until it was done hallelujah the backside of the desert changed brother branham types the backside of the desert with the new birth is that right the new birth makes us realize how insufficient we are in ourselves that's exactly where god wants us amen on the backside of the desert jesus told peter he said after you are converted go strengthen your brethren go strengthen your brethren but not until you're converted what good would it do for a man to get up here without the holy ghost and preach to you you need the holy ghost it wouldn't do you no good because he needs it himself is that right amen so so he's saying peter you're not able to do amen you're not able to strengthen your brethren yet but after the day of pentecost amen after the spirit comes amen you're going to go and strengthen your brethren amen you can tell amen before jesus was was hanging on the cross and dying you can tell peter wasn't able to to strengthen his own brethren there in the garden amen they were coming for jesus peter grabs a sword cuts the ear of the soldier off i tell you he wasn't aiming for the ear he just hit the ear he was aiming for the neck without god church we're murderers without god amen we're just beasts amen that's why we need god amen to come in our lives does it mean you're not you're going to be perfect no but you got an anchor you got something hey man that'll help you get back up again and keep marching forward failure is not when you fall down but failure is when you fall down and you don't get back up believers don't get they don't just stay down they get back up again i'll put it to you this way amen when you fall just make sure you fall forwards that way you're still going forwards is that okay amen believers they know no retreat they don't know nothing backwards all they know is flowers amen we're not stuck amen on one thing that the prophet brought amen we want more we want more and more and more if we put a period on the prophet of god in the message of the hour we do some the same thing that the pentecost did and the baptist denomination did amen but god there is no period with god amen with him all things are possible i believe church when we get over on the other side god will just continually keep unfolding and unfolding himself my i see there's no clock now back to paul turn with me to first corinthians chapter two we'll start with verse one paul again is speaking here after his conversion he he realizes that he's not going to be able to to act the same way that he he acted before and i just love this it's so beautiful he says and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom though he had excellency of speech is that right he was taught by the the best teacher there was gamaya declaring unto you the testimony of god so he didn't come to him with great speech and great big words he said for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and now he says i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling oh my you know church paul knew that all his education was nothing now amen but it was a hindrance something that was going to try to get in god's way and it caused him to constantly amen come before the people amen not in his own strength but in amen weakness fear and trembling my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith now here it is that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of a great man or of men but in the power of god what a preacher he was amen paul had been cured church amen he was right where god wanted warning him that god could use him paul was so cured because because paul he was a prideful man before his conversion he was a a prideful man he he was he was backed up by all the religious sect and you know he was smart and all this thing he was a he was a prideful man and he you know he boasted about uh uh do uh going out and persecuting the christians and making havoc of the church he he boasted about those things but god was trying to get him into a place because god was going to use him in a great mighty way he would write most of the you know now here's the thing god can use a smart person okay he can and there there's many smart people in here i'm sure he can use a smart person but that smart person has to come to the understanding that they're nothing amen that god gave him that intelligence amen not to get puffed up amen but to use it for the glory of god is that right amen so god can use a smart person amen paul was that and he wrote god took that once he got that that pride amen that puffiness of i'm a big guy i'm a big fella out of paul amen then paul would set and write a big majority of the new testament and he would later become amen the messenger to the first church age so god was was curing him amen because god was wanting to use him in a mighty way watch what brotherhood says he says some back through the scriptures we find out that god always used the nobodies to become his somebody he always taken those that the world had rejected the modern age had rejected and that's the kind that he picked up to use he says consider the apostles think about peter the fisherman not enough education to write his own name john the ignorant and unlearned he he bypassed the nobles and the educated priests and the celebrities of them days the scholars the church members and them people who thought that they were somebody and picked up those who were nobody and used them but but now now listen we're talking about two great men here that were great moses was a great man amen he was next in line for pharaoh paul was a great man amen he even liked to brag about it you know we talked about that amen so god can use somebody that's great but they have to forget amen that they were a somebody for god to be able to use them i like how brother branham says it he says now if somebody can become one of his people god can use them if they are ready to forget they are somebody if you are ready to forget that you are a somebody and become a nobody then god can use you and make us somebody out of you amen but you've got to forget that you're so important well i just you know brother i just feel like this church just wouldn't be able to go on without me bless your heart bless your heart you know i i think a lot about this you know i never was able to see or profit i never got to shake his hand i was too young wasn't born yet i'd never never been in any of his services or anything but you know from being raised in it and knowing that that this is the truth that malachi 4 was sent for me as an individual behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the lord amen i realized that it was for me that this message hey bad i'm a part of it amen but but you know i i believe just being human what if brother branham was here today how many you think would be here you see john the baptist said i must decrease so he christ can increase so brother branham had to go off the scene or else me included would probably be wherever he was so god has to increase he has to weigh amen of bringing the increase amen we got to get our eyes off a man we got to get our eyes off of human ability and get our eyes on god he's the one that's going to rapture us out of here he's the one that's going to take us out of here he said when he said he said there are so many of us in our lives some people as soon as they become christians they become arrogant and different that's right when they're just taking a vice versa path they're going backwards instead of forwards when more of you when more you can get out of yourself the more room you've got for the holy spirit to come in i want to show us an example and then we'll then we'll try to bring this down first samuel 15 if you turn with me there when we try to inject our own abilities into the word of god then then that word becomes hybrid and it's no more an original word of god to you anymore amen we're going to look here uh with me at king saul first samuel 15 verse 1. samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou into the voice of the words of the lord thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek amulek did to israel how he laid weight for him in the way when he came up from egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in telome two hundred thousand footmen and two thousand men of judah and saul came to a city of amalek and laid weight in the valley and saul said unto the canaanites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for you showed kindness to all the children of israel when they came out up out of egypt so the canaanites departed from among the malachites and saw smoth the amalekites from hawaii until thou cometh to sure that is is over against egypt and he took ag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but saul and the people spared a gag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them now as we go through this bring it to bring it to our day okay hey man let's not just leave it to to the oxen and to the sheep and to all those things amen god wants to bring us amen amen in into further into the word of god and he's asking us to yield our our entire being to heal don't spare anything amen yield it out to god he said he wouldn't and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and hath had not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul come saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord i'm just going to stop right there for a moment many people think because they come to church we shout we dance we sing we've performed the work of the lord those things are good church shouting's good i love to shout i've done my share of it amen dancing i like to dance amen i like to sing i like to do those things but there's something more there's something more that what god wants out of us did he not the prophet of god not say he said that if i can get her still long enough i'll dresser is that right amen lord help me how can god dress us when we're always shouting how can he dress us when we can't even settle down long enough to hear the word is that is that okay amen we've got to settle down we got to we got to get still long enough amen that the spirit of god can drop down not just in our flesh not just in our mind that we walk away and say glory to god god sent a prophet no it's got to be more than that hallelujah it's got to be more than that it's got to come down into our heart and become a revelation that's performing god's word i was listening on the way to from florida to here traveling as i was traveling i was listening to a message what here's thou elijah and brother branham makes this statement he says we've had our healing campaigns we've had our times of shouting we've had all this we've had all this but there's something more amen there is it's more than the thunder it's more than the wind it's more than the rushing mighty wind amen god wants to speak to you in that still small voice he wants to speak to you when you're on the job oh my don't you believe that he can speak to you and reveal himself to you on the job amen i tell you church i you know i i drive about an hour 45 minutes to an hour to work and there's been times when i'd be going to work early in the morning all by myself and just sitting there not listening to a tape just just sitting there and meditating and all of a sudden the the holy spirit would drop down in that truck amen and i was driving and just put a thought there and then a scripture would come to me amen and what was it god was bringing me a revelation he wants to speak to us in an individual way listen church this is not this is not a church move this is an individual move of the holy spirit amen an individual affair it's more than the rushing mighty winds it's more than the thunder and the lightning it's that still small voice let me get back to the scripture he said what meaning and so samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord so my whole theme in that is it's more to coming to church and just hearing a good sermon it's more to come into church than here than shouting and singing and dancing and and having healings and all those things we'll get into that maybe tonight healing is a minor we don't major on a minor he says samuel said to him he said then what meaneth then this blessing of the sheep and my this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed oh saul's just dancing he's yeah this praise the lord i did a good thing then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord has said to me this night and he said unto him say on and samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight wast thou not made the heads of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel you see church it sounded like a good and sweet idea we'll save the best sheep amen and we'll bring them back and because we got victory over the enemy amen we'll sacrifice these sheep amen we'll sacrifice these oxen unto the lord glory to god what a great jubilee service we're going to have we're going to dance we're going to shout we're going to but the word of god was not fulfilled the word of god was not performed they were leaving out something was one problem it wasn't what god told him to do he was told to utterly destroy everything and leave nothing and god spoke back through samuel and said obedience is better than sacrifice you see samuel when he was little in his own sight god blessed him and made him king over all israel he said you know go on you think but you got all puffed up you got to thinking that you were something among the people and now you've got better ideas than god what hour are we living in church what time are we living in i think it's going home time don't you amen i i want to be i want to be found doing all the word of god not just part of it if we have get to if we have got to the spot i hope this is okay brother david can correct me if not but if we have come to the spot within our own ranks that shouting is all that we need we have done the very same thing that pentecost did brother branham said that this message would not denominize it can't denominize because it is the pure word of god but the spirit of denomination would be around it amen to try to denominize people are wanting an outward amen fleshly uh emotion of some sort i've sat in churches and i say this respectfully i've sat in churches where now it's got to where preachers that if you're not jumping you're not shouting they will condemn you for sitting there for just trying to hear what's going on and they will condemn you and say well if you felt like what these other people felt you would be up to where have we went church but i'm so thankful i'm so thankful that the word goes on amen and i want to be one of those that when the word moves i move with it hey man i don't want to be just stuck in a tradition i don't want to be stuck just going one way amen i don't want to be just going with the big crowd amen i want to go with the word i want to go the way the word goes if it leads me to south and so be it if it leads me to dance around this church so be it is that right i'm not against it i've run before i've shouted before i've danced before amen but make sure it's god doing it make sure it's not just your emotions god wants to speak to you in an individual way amen but make sure he speaks to you make sure it's not man trying to work it up hey church we we've got the holy ghost the holy ghost knows how to work us up amen if he wants to shout and he'll let us shout god help us let's stand to our feet this morning i just feel like everything was scattered this morning i woke up this morning just everything was scattered i pray that lord said something to you this morning that will help you let's just bow our heads together for a word of prayer heavenly father i'm so thankful lord for this message that you've brought to us come directly from the throne of god lord i want it to come down on the throne of my heart and i want it to reside there lord i want this word to consume me i want it the lord to be my life i want you to have full preeminence with our heads bowed this morning i just wonder wonder lord that you would just begin to brew over this this congregation lord here this morning and maybe there's one that's here lord that would just say i want i want that still small voice to speak to me i want to be able to hear it i want that word to have an effect upon me i'm tired of just going to church just out of tradition i want more than god sent a prophet i want more than i believe a message i want more than that god the very fact that we have a longing in our heart for more of you just shows lord that there is more of you out there help us lord this morning i just it's my heart lord just just i want more of you lord i'm not satisfied with myself i make mistakes i have hiccups this world that we're living in there's so much negativity so much so many things lord that is out there lord to bring us down god i believe we can find peace we can find satisfaction it all lays within your word father just help us this morning lord i just take these these words lord that have been said this morning and may it begin to penetrate the hearts of your people this morning help us lord to just rise father lord and say father i want more of you consume us this morning with your presence with your word with your love surround us father as we worship you now for next few moments we just want to give our all to you i know lord there's preachers here that could take this thought lord and probably explain it and preach it in a lot better way but i just was doing lord what you've led me to do this morning let's sing this song together consume me oh lord somebody would help me [Music] of your spirit [Music] is that your desire this morning [Music] of my life [Music] all once again with all our hearts now oh god [Music] of my life [Music] hey man amen i think that's all of our hearts desire isn't it just to really be led of the holy spirit and it's easy to go down the path of ability you know that's a lot of times our ability is our natural course you know you do the things you can do and so you know the real important part of it is that you seek the face of the lord because there's one thing i know that the lord will always do he'll always put you in a no matter how he arranges your life he's going to put you in a spot where you're going to have to take his leadership above what you want to do [Music] and he'll he'll he'll rearrange that situation again that's thus saith the lord until you'll find yourself in a spot where it's what you want to do what you can do and he's going to give you place in that choice to have that leadership over your life and and that's when you have to be weak and surrender and that's the great part of our lives and when we follow our ability we run from that but we really need to get to that place where we just seek the lord's face say lord really what would you have me to do and there's a lot that's on my heart on that very subject but so we trust that we're going to have a baptism now and brother cosman and brother joseph are going to baptize a friend of theirs when they've been witnessing with and discussing baptism this morning is that this morning brother congressman so we're going to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to dismiss us and for those that need to go we'll have communion this evening at five o'clock we'll have our communion service and then uh also next sunday uh we'll be starting our study in the message uh the is this the rising of the sun and this is the rising of the sun and i think it's going to be a wonderful time uh just soaking in god's word so be praying for that for this sunday so we'll just be dismissed at this time for those that have to go uh brother cosman if you and joseph and our brother would go uh baptized in and uh and then the rest of steam missed anybody that liked to stay for the baptism just feel free so we'll just stand and worship and for a little bit and you are dismissed and uh so you can just go if you have to go and i know some of you have to go but if those of you that would like to stay for the baptism feel please be free to pay to the baptism amen let's have a word of prayers we're distance our father lord we've been challenged in our heart this morning by your word but lord we just don't always know what our abilities are because that's the natural course of our life we just naturally go with the things that we can do but father just to sit still and and hear ye him and just really seek out that your voice really gives us direction father and and we stop and go the path that you make for us and take that the journey that can only be performed by your grace and your mercy and that each of us would just come to that spot that we come to that place that we consider are going in and are coming out and we look at our own life in the light of your presence in the light of your word and the light of your will we don't go with the crowd we don't go with what the norm is but we just find that individual heart i just believe our brother spoke that to us just that personality and personal part of it that i know that i've heard from the lord and i'm i'm being obedient to that and if i don't have the ability to do it lord your strength is perfect in my weakness and by your grace is sufficient for us may each of us know that in our heart today all right god bless we hope to see you back those that need to go you are dismissed brother billy would you lead us in a song of worship the more that i surrendered the light of my lord the more that i release my cares the more you take control oh [Music] every day i live [Music] surrender [Music] the more that i release my cares more the more you take control and the more that i can humble myself every day [Music] more my i release my [Music] case [Music] lord i love [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] say [Music] r [Music] oh [Music] arms of god [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh o jesus christ [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] me is [Music] amen god bless you um brother mandel's a friend of ours he's uh he's come from downtown dallas and we've been ministering to work for him for to him for a little while now since i believe february march and uh he studied the scriptures real well and uh you know when we are when we were talking to him about the word and this message and the life of this message and really what this message is um there was a few things that he he kind of stumbled on but it wasn't time yet and uh you know we uh we went ministering yesterday out there and uh he just looks at us and it says you know i finally see it i finally he we gave him a church age book and he was reading it and he said i finally see it i finally see the right way of being baptized and what the name is and i looked at him and i said you know brother randall i said revelations election because he loves you he shows you the word and what a privilege it is that he's actually manifesting that word this morning and just accepting the baptism not only in the death and the burial of the water but they're the gift of the holy ghost that comes afterwards so we're just we're just gonna if you i don't know you have a few words brother randall i do a few months ago i don't know if y'all remember who i am i came in and uh i seen the beauty in this church by the people i mean that i looked at a place i had long hair and a beard and none of y'all really criticized me you know it was a wonderful feeling and for a little while i i took off and came back today but i started reading the baptism thing and and about a month ago i said something about to a guy that works with this man here he says i said when you see him again and tell brother coffman that uh i want to be baptized that took me a long time because i've been baptized before a long time ago but no matter how many times i've read that bible it's a different thing you know because peter was given the authority to loose and bind things on heaven and he said something different about being baptized with jesus christ amen it's just uh something had to go through my mind and snapping and like i say when i wanted to do it things started happening that was really bad i mean we lost phones everything you know and it was a bad month i said wow you know sometimes when you know you're going to do right something is going to happen become a constant battle but here i am here i am today and i want to get this done [Applause] we're just going to read our box 238 and uh what a beautiful what a beautiful fulfillment this morning from what we heard from brother brayton and uh you know they heard the same message and that day and here's here's verse 37 as it says now when they heard this they were all pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostle man and brother and what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with this many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this unworth generation then they that gladly receive his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls whether randall fulfilling the the scripture just like the bible says go into all the world and be baptized in the name of the father the son of the holy ghost and we know by the divine revelation peter comes and he says that the name is the name of the lord jesus christ so we baptize you this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ hey man let's all stand this morning man let's sing this says our dismissal i'll make grace i sweet the sound that saved like me [Music] i see [Music] really [Music] i [Music] oh when my god [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and [Music] been oh free [Music] oh god [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
