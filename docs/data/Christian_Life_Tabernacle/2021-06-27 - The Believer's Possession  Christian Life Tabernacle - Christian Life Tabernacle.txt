the mighty name oh lord jesus christ we pray father thank you amen amen good to be gathered in the presence of god man who want to welcome everyone in the house of god and all our visitors we welcome you this morning men are going to invite brother mike for us i'm reading god bless you go through the psalms and as we have and read all the many chapters where you know david or maybe one of the other psalmists is filling an entire chapter many verses many words praising the lord and of all the abundant testimonies and of all the works that he has done and just pages and pages and it just seems like not enough words could describe what the lord has done and you know david does probably better than most of us could in terms of putting words around the things that he's done but you know psalm 117 is noticeable with how short it is it's just two verses you know and it's um you know it caused me to take a look at that and what is it that could have happened here to cause david to take just two verses to make a point of praising the lord verse 2 psalm 117 verse 2 says this for his merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of the lord endureth forever praise ye the lord and in just two little verses david is calling upon all the nations and all the people of the world to praise him and it makes me wonder what event what circumstance was going on that caused him to just squeeze in just two verses of time to praise the lord you know we probably will never know exactly what circumstance it was whether david was just returning from some great battle or was on the road and it encountered some trial but in the very small space of time that he had available to him whatever that was he took the time to praise the lord for two things for his mercy and for his truth you know and it made me wonder that you know in all the noise and all the busyness of life sometimes it's hard to find time to just pause and praise the lord and david in one of those times of busyness found just two verses worth of time and of all the things that he could have praised the lord for it was those two things mercy and truth you know it sort of made me wonder if a man after god's own heart is taking what little time he has if he has nothing else he has time to praise for it's those two things to maybe look at that a little bit there's another statement david makes here in verse 2 the truth of the lord endureth forever you know and how important that is to us in an hour when it seems that there's not one single statement one single fact one single message that lasts any more than the next news cycle before somebody's backtracking it or talking it back or apologizing for it and it seems like there's nothing that you can anchor in but his truth endureth forever you know it's funny when you look at the scriptures especially when you look at psalms there's only five things that david ever says endureth forever and by far the number one thing that he mentions more than anything else is his mercy his mercy endureth forever he mentions that 42 times in the psalms the next closest thing is his truth endureth forever you know and i thought it was significant that he filled that time just that little space of time that he had whatever it was to praise the lord for mercy and truth and you just look at that in the scriptures and those two things are tied together all the time in the scriptures mercy and truth mercy and truth you know what's interesting about those two things his mercy and his truth are ear marks of his hand upon your life those are two things that you would never know outside of a visitation from him so you look at his mercy and his truth and why we're so thankful for those is because if nothing else it gives evidence that god has come by our way we would not know his truth we would certainly not know his mercy had he not come by our way so how important it is to be able to point our finger at our lives in the circumstances of our lives and say praise the lord for his mercy praise the lord for his truth because he's come by my way and just a few of the scriptures you look at where the two are together this is interesting in hosea 4 1 hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lord hath the controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land this didn't come out of the dallas morning news this came out of the word of god and it's an ear mark of the absence of the lord in the land when mercy and truth cannot be found but you look at all the other scriptures psalm 25 10 all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies i like this one proverbs 3 3. let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart proverbs 16 6 by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil and then there's proverbs 20 28 mercy and truth preserve the king the leader of the land and his throne is upholding my mercy praise the lord for mercy and truth because it's the evidence that god's hand is upon your life you can't have it without him so as we read this very short song you know i i just it was significance to me that in the little two verses that david had those were the two things he focused on and it caused me to stop and think you know praise the lord for his mercy for his enduring mercy praise the lord for his enduring truth in a time when nothing is enduring and it's an evidence that god's hand is upon her life so just wanted to call kind of share with you that that kind of caught my attention as we read this very short psalm psalm 117 praise ye the lord all ye nations praise him all ye people for his merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of the lord endureth forever praise ye the lord amen god bless you man you may be seated man let's sing that song castro burdens unto jesus for he cares for you this morning amen just want to forget about what happened yesterday what happened last night just gonna just give me is it the f g just give me g cast your burdens unto jesus [Music]

[Music] oh [Music] oh no matter what [Music] is no matter what may come my way our heavenly father we certainly approach you this morning knowing that you know all things and that we have the promise that we're in the palm of your hand and that nothing can pluck us out father sometimes we hit many hours of uncertainty but you said that you would never leave us nor forsake us but that you'd be with us even in us till the end father we trust in those words today and we ask that you bless our effort here this morning to set our hearts to the task of following this message we ask you to be with us this morning as we look to your word for our substance father and our hope father for our leadership we just ask that you would guide us this morning and be with us for we ask these things in the precious and wonderful name of the lord jesus we pray amen and amen god bless you this morning you may be seated we are going to continue on sort of what the lord had placed on our heart and that was to go through some of the messages that brother bran preached in 1965 and in instead of just taking a quote from here and a quote from there and putting them together but just to maybe to spend a little time and just go through a message slowly a few pages at a time and see all the riches that are contained within the great scope of his word and i certainly have come to realize that there's only one thing that can navigate this hour that we live in and and that's the the message of the hour the end time condition satan appears as an angel of light and it seems like so many of the things that he's offering are logical and uh they're understandable and and with reason uh you could easily accept what that he would have to offer but there's a voice in this date that has a sure path and assure vision of where that we go and we need to be so connected with it but i'd like to just read a few statements before we start we're going to start today in easter seal it's the next message after who is this melchizedek and i'm going to go through it with you and just each section that we we listen to and that we study and that we read so if you have i guess nowadays you can have your uh the message on your tablet or your phone or if you haven't if you're old-fashioned like i am you have a book and a marker and i kind of uh laughed i had who is this melchizedek so marked up that i couldn't find anything and so i some paragraphs i had three stars next to because i was going to read that one and the date and it's just so bountiful rich i just don't know what the rest of the church world feeds on you know i mean this is such a magnificent food but so we're going to look at that so if you could put up like paragraph for easter seal paragraph 46 and uh you know i i believe brother branham always kind of lays the platform out in the beginning of where that he wants us to look to take us and i just want to read a few of paragraphs and then we'll stand in re with the scriptures he reads and i think we're going to listen to 28 minutes this morning but this paragraph in paragraph 46 he says now notice the very essence of this resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that jesus has raised up from the dead he's not dead he's living he lives here he's in us i'll be with you even in you a little while the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you even in you until the end of the world i believe there's a desire in the heart of the believer for that to become a reality a reality and we have to remember that we have an enemy that fights that reality uh there he is trying to show another reality that's what he did in the garden of eden he went to eve and said no surely you won't die there's another reality over here something else for you that uh if if you partake of this that you'll be wise and you'll know all things and and uh he enticed her into leaving the simplicity of the word of god which was the day you eat is the day that you die and i i don't know would any of you now give up the garden of eden for what we have now i don't think so i mean he's a liar the satan is a liar he's the father of lies so that's what we read down and and i i think this is what he says now as christians we all claim he is alive or we've been quickened quickened from life from death to life but his spirit by his spirit and if we haven't been quickened then we have not been made alive now this is what i'm this is kind of what he's going to go into he says he says now we're going to break into this subject the lord willing and kind of teach it for a few minutes how that we are quickened and can be sure that this is the truth now this is your own life this is my life it's where that if it isn't true what i'm fixing to say then i'm one of the most foolish people in the world i've given my life for something there's nothing to so have you but if it is true then i owe everything that i am i owe everything that i could be don't let that slip by everything that i could be i owe everything that i could be to the cause of which we're standing for and i think that we must mustn't lose our enthusiasm that's that's it that's a very hard thing to keep your enthusiasm especially when the great uh times are struggling uh if if we could just for a second and if if i would title a sermon it's probably not very fair for me to title his sermon when we're just going to listen to it but i would probably call it the possession of the believer but let's read paragraph just for the second so we can turn our hearts to this message it says as jesus said go ye therefore and teach all nations and prove to them by demonstrating the power of god to them these signs shall follow them that believe them who promise and say they believe he's given us a definite understanding of it that these signs would follow them that believe it would be the proof of our testimony now we say we believe but until we are have the proven sign that he said that would be upon us then we are just confessing to be believers and not the possession of believers so that realizes that we could find ourselves in a state where we've kind of been unenthusiastic that we've got to the place where we believe but we have stopped proving yep you know what i mean to that we we've we've stopped demonstrating and proving that he is alive and uh we we certainly we we certainly don't want to be believers but we want to have the possession of believers yeah so if i could say that what that he's talking about here he says on what i'm going to teach and what i want us to understand that there is a possession that the believer has it is a kind of a seal he calls it a seal it is a something that the believer possesses and it's a quickening power now and so uh i like i'm reading backwards but uh i'm doing that for a reason nick i'd like if you would to turn to paragraph 32. so i i've read backwards so we could kind of when we go forward we can understand that he's trying to gather up our minds he's he's trying to he's trying to get us to settle down for a moment get out from the the trouble of what's going around in the world and everything and realize that there's something that we can possess something that he's got for us something to give us something that belongs to the believer and it's something that the enemy is trying to rob from you and that's kind of sad to think that there's somebody out there that's always trying to steal something from you take something from you if he doesn't want you to possess this power in fact his whole mission in life is to disprove everything that god said that's what he does that's isn't that what the scripture tells us he tries to make the word of god of none effect and and one of the things he does this is he burdens us uh with uncertainty and and i think that's the biggest thing i hear today is nobody's certain we're not certain of the economy we're no longer certain of our health you know what i mean we're no longer certain of this and certain of that but we're certain they don't know what's going to happen we know what's going to happen you know what i mean this is our if i could say this great easter seal is our ticket out of here right if the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies look you understand so now he's trying to tell us what we just read not only what it is but how that we get it and how that we can trust in it and believe in it and know that it's true in other words not question what it is that you possess notre no matter how much the accuser tries to steal it from you take it away from you tell you you don't have it try to do whatever he can to say if thou be the christ come down off the cross if thou turn these stones to this if thou be this do this do that no you're settled you know my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow they're angered into the word of god they're anchored in they understand what god did in this generation by fulfilling malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 they're fixed they they know they've got a voice they know they've got a shepherd they know they've got a spirit that's leading them and guiding and all truth and just think of this in an hour of uncertainty where everybody out in the world's cooking up all kinds of ideas you know what i mean that that every group is attacking every other button everybody wants a little bit of their knowledge and a little bit of their ideas in the whole mix that there is a storehouse you understand a prophetic food that has been laid up for us that we can go to can we can feed on and we have a god that stands behind it and brings it to pass and proves it that this is the food the manna that will sustain you in this great hour of famine because famine is promised famine is thus saith the lord there will come a day when there will be a famine on the land not for food and meat but for the pure word of god that's where the famine is and it does and the tr and the pure word of god so there is such the the famine now is so noticeable that every every man has become a cook and he's trying to cook the word up into something that will satisfy you pulling this from here and that from there and making this up and making that up and you know why because it's human nature they got tired of the manna that was sustaining them and what did he give them he'd give them locusts he gave them until they loathed it in other words they hated that more than they hated the manna and i'll tell you something there's nothing there's nothing that's going to guide us out of here and feed the true soul of the believer but the stored food that's been stored up for us it's not dead manna because the spirit put it in there you understand and he knew that he would take it out in season and that he would quicken it to us and make it life to us i certainly don't want to uh you know compare it to something that you put in the freezer you know what i mean and then you unthought because this wasn't cooked and then put in for another day it was setting in there and it was going to become alive in the day that it was brought out so you know we're not looking back on a finished message we're looking back on the messenger that brought us living word that was going to carry us through every hour every situation every circumstance that we could grab hold of it be anchored in it and understand it's a live word it's not theology it's not doctrine it's not something of the day gone by it was none other than the plan of god to say that i'm gonna sustain a people and take them through he did it in the first exodus he did it in the second exodus and he has to do it in this exodus also just like we saw the the three uh expressions of melchizedek the first time he came right he blew up a body the word of god god in the form showing abraham whatever son would be and then he came down in flesh not sinful flesh but first of all it wasn't even flesh through birth the second he said you no longer hear malchester he comes down and he becomes jesus he comes through in human flesh through a birth there he is veiled in jesus emorphy changing forms fail and then he comes a third time in our day veiled in the ministry of sinful flesh redeemed by the blood doing the same words ma go over here to first baptist and have them sit there and tell you melchizedek showed up in this day in the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelation you know what they call you heretic antichrist but i'm like paul and the way they call heresy so do i worship the law just think of it you you understand we can't lose our enthusiasm we can't get to the place that when we listen to this messenger who was the voice of god to us laying the food in there for us that oh that's not a good service you know no we've got to say okay i'm going to listen for 28 minutes i'm going to listen for 28 minutes i don't need to be stirred up from the outside by emotion i need to be fed from the inside i need something that comes deep in in the hollow of my heart and and this does something for us so let's let's turn to uh to paragraph um 32. he's talking we know this is called easter seal so he's talking about a resurrection he's going to go very far in this message to actually to the resurrection of the lord in us he said but easter proved it it sealed the word of god forever for the true believer it sealed the word of god forever for the true believer why does every word of us is so important to us because we know he's alive and he's here and he keeps his word what a comfort i will not leave you comfortless but i'll come again i'll be with you even in you till the end i'll send you the spirit of truth who shall lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness but easter proved it it sealed the word of god forever for the true believer all gloom and doubt was scattered at that blessed morning man had been shut up as it was in a prison house even to religious people before this day because they had been seen great religious moves and the moving of the holy spirit and so forth but when a man died it seemed to settle it but when this one came and said i have power to lay my life down i have power to take it up again and then go prove what he said now listen to this prove what he said to me that's the seal of it when something is said and then is turned around and proven so the seal easter seal talking about giving us this seal he's going to give us something you understand that we can not just believe but possess right that that when we say something we can turn around and prove it now think of that you having something a possession a quickening power that you have that will prove what that you say what you believe that's the true seal that's the difference between believing the trains coming and believing the trains going and having a ticket to get on it and then before we listen let's read the paragraph uh uh just read a paragraph here in 35 and when he proved by his promise this great conquering power that he had on easter he proved that he could conquer death hell and the grave i am he that was dead and in this alive again and alive forevermore and have the keys to death hell in the grave all right amen he's got the key amen what would you do if he promised you that key okay that he was going to make you a duplicate right that now you have the power to conquer death hell in the grave now you have the power to prove that what you say and see it come to pass amen this is what he's talking about that's the true seal is when you can prove it so he can't give you a seal like a sticky thing which he goes in here about the the easter seal from what was that tuberculosis thing they sold easter seals you stuck them on your envelope he said this ain't a sticky thing you know this isn't a label that you stick on you know and then you you gotta when you don't believe it anymore you've got to go get some goof off to get it off and usually that's what you find that people are getting rid of the label of christianity in this message they're out there goofing off i had to say that he said he says what a statement for anyone to make and not only did he make it but he already proved that he had what he claimed now this is where we're trying to go with our study and i think god hastens the day that when we as christians who believe this bible can prove what we are talking about see that's what makes as i said a while ago the salt of the earth the sister said that's right the world is looking for this salt and when we can prove by our lives and by the bible that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that's the day we're looking for isn't that what we're looking for that's the day we're looking for and i i believe with all my heart that the believer recognizes that there is something on the just right by us here that is going to unite with us that that day so if we're hastening that day and god's hastening that day that day has got to come and i believe there's a sense in the true believer that that day is here and when we listen to the last uh paragraph that we're going to listen to this morning we're going to go from paragraph of 30 23 through paragraph 67 and we'll make a little comment but as you look for that look at those things brother brahms wove those things in there so he's trying to tell these people there's something that god's got for you it lies within this message okay it's not we're not trying to go back and recreate pentecost we're not trying to go back but there is a a new day an opening of the word a turning of a corner there's something that's alive and new for us in this day it lies within the message that god brings it comes by faith it comes by quickening of the word and revelation of the word so if i know that this quickening power lies in that word then i want to hear that word you understand you understand why that i i'm taking this time to play this tape and not create just a good service this morning where we pray for the sick and we worship god but let's get down deeper let's get in there and feast on god's word let's realize that it's in that word that that quickening resurrection power lies man has been probing at the bible and teaching the bible and claiming the promises of the bible but there's got to do something with this hour that creates it in us and that's the last statement you're going to hear so let's stand together if you would 28 minutes that's not long to concentrate it might be for some of us but uh and we're gonna uh turn to the chap of matthew the 28th chapter and we'll read there and i believe he also reads in romans the eighth chapter so and then also revelations the first chapter so he's going to have three scripture readings you can read along on the board or you can read in your bible and let's just sit back and listen to this 28 minutes be attentive uh to it and i i think that as we go forward into this message i believe we're going to enjoy it as god's servant opens the word to us amen aren't you glad god's opened your eyes oh praise the lord amen god bless you this morning amen as we listen to our messenger william branham and this is kind of a little pre-easter message lord willing about 40 minutes now let's read from saint matthew's gospel the 28th chapter beginning in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week came mary magdalena and the other married to see the sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenances was like lightning and his raiment wide as snow and for fear of him the quakers did the keepers part of me did shape and became his dead man and the angel answered and said unto the women fear ye not for i know that you seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come and see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lord i have told you and they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy and did run and bring the disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them seeing all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worship him then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me in revelations the first chapter and the 17th and 18th verse and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and hell and in the book of romans the eighth chapter and beginning with the 11th first but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now i trust that the lord jesus will add his blessings to the readings of these words seeing that easter and i have stamped it in my own heart as the greatest meeting or the greatest event of the year i want to ask you to pardon me in a moment isn't that kind of blaring out there to you kind of a roaring is it all right can you hear it all right like that you can't hear it is that better right like that i didn't want to get too close now why i say this is because that easter he proved what the bible had said all the scripture that was written of him to do he sealed his messiah ship when he rose from the dead the easter seal we have so much of it today we talk about that buying easter seals well i want to speak this morning on the easter seal it's a different seal than what we buy with our money as a seal to go on letters for i think the tuberculosis association of whatever they call it i i think this seal is a little different seal and being that easter is the great day of the year for we christians who claim to be god's children i want to try to break into it and see how we should be fellowshipped with this great thing that christ did for us the word of god was spoken many many hundreds of years before his coming of his crucifixion and of his death and of his suffering and also of his resurrection we'll be going through these services perhaps next week as we listen to our our radio programs and in our churches with our pastors and so forth uh this coming week but of all the days and all of the things that jesus did and certainly appreciating all of his vindication of god's word and what he did to fulfill it of healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils preaching the gospel to the poor and fulfilling every word that god said that he would do when he came and then also suffering for our sins and our stead to be the propitiation for our sin at the cross where no one else could have done it but him but above all of that i think easter seal the whole thing because there had been prophets on the earth who had prophesied before him there had been prophets on the earth who had healed the sick even raised the dead and done the same signs that jesus did but easter proved it it sealed the word of god forever for the true believer all gloom and doubt was shattered at that blissful morning man had been shut up as it was in a prison house even to religious people before this day because they had been seen great religious moves and moving of the holy spirit and so forth but when a man died it seemed to settle it but when this one came and said i have power to lay my life down i have power to take it up again and then go prove what he said to me that that's the seal of it when uh when something is said and then uh it's turned around and proven if a man said like columbus believed the world was round and he watched the ships as we were told how they come in and you could see the mass way before you could see the ship and it proved him that the world was round people didn't believe that that day but he was a man of vision he set out to prove exactly what he had a vision of that was the truth and god purposed to prove his word the truth so he there was only one man that could do that and that was jesus and he come and proved that to be the truth it sealed it and that broke all the seals of gloom and scattered all the the superstitions of other religions and so forth where a great man has raised up and said great marvelous things but they're everyone in the grave but our christian religion is the only one who has an empty tomb and that proves to me that he is a god of the dead and god all the living that he can raise up the dead uh back to life again and uh this quickening power quicken in spirit of his has proved through the years that he is the one who can quicken the dead back to life again and when he proved by his promise this great conquering power that he had on easter he proved that he could conquer death hell and the great that's it i am he that was dead and is alive again and alive forevermore and have the keys that to death hell in the grave what a a statement for anyone to make and not only did he make it but he had already proved that he he had what he claimed to have and i think god hastened the day that when we as christians who believe this bible can prove what we're talking about see that's what makes is the said a while ago the salt of the earth the sister said that's right the world is looking for this soul and when we can prove by our lives and by the bible uh that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that that's the day we're looking for the word this spirit romans 8 there that 11 said if this spirit that raised up jesus christ be in you will also quicken your mortal bodies not only did he prove to him to us that he was a jehovah redeemer and had power over death hell and the grave but he has also given us the access to the same spirit that we ourselves can have the assurance that we too are quickened by that spirit for the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in your body it will also quicken your mortal bodies now the word quicken means to be made alive after death after it's dead then it's to be quickened the world has been shut up in doubt for many ages until then this was proven not only talked about but was proven i think that anything is worthwhile as jesus said oh ye therefore teach all nations and prove to them by demonstrating the power of god to them these signs shall follow them that believe them who promise and say they believe he give us a definite understanding of it that these signs would follow them that believe it would be the proof of their testimony now we can say we believe but until we are have the proven sign that he said that would be upon us then we are just confessing to be believers and not the possession of believers for remember a few days ago i was listening to a radio uh program on kair down in tucson and this minister had taken the assad against us that the pentecostal religion was nothing but just a sham there was uh not to listen to it it was unstable and said any man that spoke in tongues and these things and claimed to be uh heal the sick and so forth by prayer that it was to leave away from it and to pray for those poor decrepit people because if they were in an illusion that there was something wrong with them oh how i would have liked to talk to that brother just a little while and he said that the uh that that was only given for the apostles at the day of pentecost and that was all i find that 30 years later paul was ordaining these gifts in the church in first corinthians 15 that he said in the church the gift of speaking in tongues miracles and all these other gifts was set in the church jesus said that go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature how far all the world who to every creature they've never received it yet and these signs shall follow them that believe how long all the world who to ever creature these signs shall follow them and all the world and every creature these signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues if they taken up a deadly thing or serpent or drinking a deadly thing would not harm them they'll lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover that was his last commission to the church mark the 16th chapter paul's ordaining these gifts into the church 30 years later and said in galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received see already been preached let him be accursed amen i believe that pentecost begin without an ending i believe it's to be to every creature all times and all places that pentecost should always remain the pentecostal blessings should be up on the people and now what is this pentecostal blessing it's a confirmation of the resurrection no wonder the gospel itself means good news good news of what he's raised from the dead and because i live ye live also ye which were once dead in sin and trespasses god has quickened us together but that spirit that raised up jesus from the dead and we are now sitting in heavenly places with him communing with him talking with him what a joy to tell people that story that believes it to be the truth i'm wondering today it's what's happening are we really getting the people to god are we just getting them to church we must get them to christ that's it we're this quickening power it's good to go to church sure if that's as far as we go oh it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead for if this spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken make bring to life your mortal bodies amen what a promise to us now notice the very essence of this resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that jesus has raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living he lives here he's in us i'll be with you even in you a little while the world sees me no more yet you shall see me for i will be with you even in you unto the end of the world now as christians we all claim he is alive or we've been quickened from quicken from life from death to life by his spirit and if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive now we're going to break into this subject the lord willing and kindly teach it for a few minutes how that are we quickened and can we be sure that this is the truth now this is your own life this is my life it's where that the if this isn't truth what i'm fixing to say then i'm one of the most foolish people in the world i've given my life for something there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth then i owe everything that i am oh everything that i could be to the cause of which we're standing for and i think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm and as we see easter approaching it just does something down in me as i i know that that's uh the day that the thing was sealed forever in the sight of god now we notice it's the same spirit that raised him from the grave that is dwelling in us now how could that be the spirit that raised up god jesus from the dead has dwelling in us now now is the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does that now the wheat alone is just a wheat but when the quicken in life gets into it into the wheat then it gives it life and we which were once dead made in the image of god and yet dead in sin and trespass this some way god had to get this quicken in life into your mortal bodies i'm talking about your body now jesus was the word you believe that don't you in the beginning saint john 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now as the promised messiah he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do heal the sick and how to be born of a virgin all that made it true he was the word manifested here on earth but he could not do this just as a man had taken the spirit of god dwelling in him to quicken these promises to him i hope that we get this real clear now jesus being a man himself the body but it took the spirit in him the spirit it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that does the works see jesus himself was the word because he was before god this is a bad word to use i hope you take it right before a crown but he was predestinated by the foreknowledge of god how god's plan was to be that he would send a redeemer and this redeemer could only be his own son so then that was god's promise all the way from the garden of eden that jesus would be here here he was as a man born of a virgin but it taken the spirit of god to quicken that word to him and he was the word quickened the word quickened for that hour the time had come when you had to have a redeemer the law had failed other things that failed now it takes a redeemer and he was the promised redeemer he was quickened by the word of god and now if that same spirit that was upon him to be the redeemer in that age that we have accepted now the promise of in this last days what would take place if you become part of that word you are redeemed with him because the same spirit that dwell in christ is dwelling in you quickening your life to this age and it will also in the end time quicken your mortal bodies resurrect them bring them up again that takes the gloom away when we look at it in that and that's the truth see romans here paul has proved it to us see if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies this is the same spirit that raised him up that quicken the true believer to eternal life the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells into the believer quickens the believer to eternal life there's only one life one eternal spirit one eternal life and that's god god alone is eternal and then we being his children are part of him that is the attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and becomes a word then each individual in here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in god's thinking that's the only way it could be because you're a attribute that's an expression of a thought has been come a word and a word has taken life and it's eternal that's the reason we have eternal life in the same principle that the great son of god the redeemer we become sons and daughters of god through that same spirit by the same foreknowledge of god look at the millions on earth that didn't receive it when jesus share but how thankful that we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence and the bible proofs that we are included in that great resurrection morning coming that great easter we have the earnest of it right now in our mortal bodies the predestinating ones are the first of course to be quickened when the holy spirit comes to claim its own now there's a great statement and i want my minister of brothers to try to understand this see in the beginning god the great spirit he wasn't even god then he was the eternal one god is an object of worship he had nothing to worship him there was no there were no angels no nothing just god alone him alone's eternal but in order to be god there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and beings and uh cherubians and so forth to worship him and his great plan begin to unfold but remember you in the the statue that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now for you is some part it's in you that's eternal and eternal only belongs to god and god was his thinking of you setting right where you are now in his thinking i stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and knows all things therefore he could tell the end from the beginning because he's eternal and you being a son of god or a daughter of god then you were in his thinking at the beginning and then when the holy spirit come in your own earth walking around here as a center way down in your life is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry i heard the presbyterian brother i heard the the baptist talking about back there he was a a freewheeled baptist preaching where he can my fellow brother that you there's something in you something that you never put in there it's something that you couldn't desire to be in there it's something that's contrary to your own nature it's the foreknowledge of god taking place god's word as jesus was born the son of god to be emmanuel god's full expression in a man and he found him in perfect obedience down at the river of jordan being baptized for that prophet and as soon as he obeyed him and walked out of the water the heavens opened to john and he saw the holy ghost descending from heaven saying this is my beloved yes perfect obedience the spirit had sought him out in obedience oh wayward man or woman this morning when you're sitting here and there's something in you telling you this is right it's the holy spirit seeking you out that's it to bring you to a knowledge of truth of this hour that we're now living not some hour that's gone by the hour now there was thousands there that it all being an hour pass but there was a present tense hour that was the hour that jesus was to appear and there stood the word there stood the people and here was a manifestation of god taking place to vindicate that that was the truth and it's pentecostal people today let me say this that we're standing in this last days where god promised he'd pour out his spirit upon all flesh and his sons and daughters should prophesy shall follow them that believe it's the hour that's what makes that creation in you i'm afraid that if we keep going we'll have the rapture you know as i was listening to it just now again going through it more and more just came uh pouring out uh it it's marvelous that and and tell me that isn't marvelous when you remember he said that you can trust in it and you can believe in it that here's something in you that you couldn't even desire you couldn't put there yourself it's even contrary to your nature and you we battle so much with our nature but yet we it wasn't our nature that put this in our hearts he put it there and and you know why he put it there right because he predestinates a people to be there to manifest and bring the promises of word god's word to pass amen this life in us but i want to just finish this morning right here and we should we'll just be um maybe out by noon and maybe through the summer we can try to keep the services uh just a little more precise but i want to just read this last statement to you before it came and you you caught where he was bringing us right talking is about the spirit talking about how it's predestinated to us right when the holy spirit come and you're on earth walking around here as a sinner way down in your life there is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry i i heard the prospering brother i heard the baptist talking back there the free will baptist preaching my fellow brother that you were there something in you something in you that you never put in there is something that you couldn't desire to be there you couldn't even desire it to be there just think of it something that's contrary to your own nature it's the foreknowledge of god taking place god's word amen it's the foreknowledge of god taking place what is the foreknowledge of god manifested that's the word being manifested no wonder the prophet god said you're the word that thing that god put there that you it's even contrary to your nature do you know your nature still contrary to it your flesh still wars against it right right that's what paul said i have to bring this flesh under subjection i die daily satan's always putting something up there always trying to draw you away always lying to you telling you that you're not a believer i've had many people come to me say satan's telling me i thought oh praise god satan's telling me i'll never get well that's the exact proof because if if because he's a liar i mean i just can't i mean how can you be described any more of a liar than being called the father of lies in other words every lie that's ever told comes from you because he lied to eve and that's the story but you know that's why this is the story that the truth returns back to the bride and she's not eating of that fruit anymore praise the lord but let's just listen this last statement in closing and and i would just start going right back over all these same quotes and reading to you again and and and getting all excited all over again you know because i like he says there's thousands that are living and the hours passed so let's just pick it up there because he's we're going to launch a little bit into what's ahead of us he said he said this is paragraph 66. now there's thousands there that had obeying an hour past but there was a present tense hour that was the hour that jesus was to appear and stood there and stood there the word now you have a present tense hour every believer in their life has a present tense hour the time in your life where the word is quickened and manifested to you alive amen because everything he's already known about you right what was it it was the foreknowledge of god coming to pass so each of you in your life has a foreknowledge of god of you where you were the color of your eyes the color of your hair is where you be sitting this morning each one of you has a foreknowledge of god a place in your life that the word is going to manifest and come to pass and it'll be the word of god standing there you understand too many times we approach everything like a group revelation like a group truth do you understand we believe the message but what the message is trying to do is break this down to each individual where each individual understands that god is speaking to them personally through the message of the hour you can't take this message and teach it like a dogma and like a creed the minute the hour changes the quickening power changes i i i was in this message 30 years ago we weren't preaching these kind of messages 30 years ago we weren't hearing what we're hearing today 30 years ago was it there sure the seals were contained in the bible the four horse riders were going out paul all them guys were preaching at the it all this word of god was transpiring just exactly the way it was transpiring everything was the same but we didn't see it why because what age were we to get i sav what age were we to get character what eggs were we going to be clothed and right rain them at so if you understand the the word quickens by the hour so it's very easy to find a comfort zone that's why the grass always looks greener on the other side you go to a meeting and you get there and mend that fellowship you get in fellowship maybe you live isolated all the time and all of a sudden now you're in fellowship the fellowship feels so good it feels so rich it's so good oh this this this is where it's at and you go to where it's at and it's not where it's at because it's never there it's remember what he said it's in here it's in here this is this is where it's being quickened it's not being quickened out here it's being quickened in you now why because that's why he's talked about it i want to if i get this to set in you each of your lives are different my life's different but the quickening is going on this he said this is your life this is my life that's the words he used trying to get us to say wait a minute this is something individual here so as we read he says there's thousands that had obeyed an hour past but there was a present tense hour that was the hour that jesus was to appear and stood the word there stood the people and here was the manifestation of god taking place to vindicate that that was the truth and as pentecostal people today let me say this that we're standing in the last days where god promised he'd pour out his spirit upon all flesh now that's why pentecost was not the outpouring of god's spirit it was a restoration of gifts and at best a partaking of evil men but to this outpouring and i i have to go another half hour and i already passed noon but this outpouring could only be on the predestinated so this outpouring was for ordained predestinated the manifest and it has to be a hundred percent word that's why what they thought was the of latter rain was not because the teaching rain had to come first the word had to come so oh my i got i got an hour in me right now the word had to come because the word had to come so the believer could see it quicken amen or proven because that's the seal of it so if the messenger didn't come and preach all that he preached then you would be trying to see something gone past quicken or something that has past be brought to life but he's not bringing alive something that used to be he's bringing something alive that was predestinated to come hallelujah we're not part we didn't miss anything we haven't missed anything when you get someplace i don't care how much is going on how much carrying on how excited the preacher gets you did not miss anything [Music] a lot of people like preachers on one leg you didn't miss nothing you just heard the messenger say that calm cool and collective nobody gets excited they get excited at the excitement but when you can see it proven okay when you can see it coming to pass we haven't missed anything no so let's read that the spirit upon our flesh and his sons and daughters should prophesy what's that preach tell of the things that is coming to pass what will come to pass what will happen because the word's been revealed to them so they know what's going to happen i can prophesy it's only going to get worse for the unbeliever but it's only going to get better for the believer now i know you get in battles but we're not we'll go through that a little later he said his sons and daughters should prophesy for he said these signs shall follow them that believe it's the hour that's what makes that creation in you now it's the hour that's what makes the creation in you don't you understand the hour that we're in the circumstances that we're in the environment that we're in the the woke and the and the weight and the whoop and everything else that's going around out here the the sodom and gomorrah condition everything that's happened it's the hour that makes that creation in you if it didn't get to this hour then the creation of god hastening the day that we prove this word is true it couldn't happen until the hour was there because the hour is what puts the creation in you oh hallelujah not woe unto me even so come quickly lord jesus it's got to be this way i wish it wasn't i like the way it was before the plague but we've had a plague how many think there'll be another plague sure i'll tell you a plague that would knock this country crazy for all the cell phones to go down we'd be in a plague you'd have to ask somebody for something you'd have to go see somebody you'd have to look them in the eye it's real simple to type somebody and say oh i wish you wouldn't have done that but really looking here you know your teeth everything just the way that you really feel do you think god's going to let us get by huh he'd have to raise sodom and gomorrah up again you think he's going to make such a bed of ease that we're just going to skate in on social media don't look at your phone for the rapture to be announced jesus is not going to twitter it ain't happening how when did he tell you to look at look at the signs of his coming have i saved that thou can see recognize the word of god coming to pass it's the hour that's going to put the creation in you it's when this message when you can start to see this message coming to pass no wonder he told a study to show yourself approved read this word get from this message get it get in contact with it don't lose your enthusiasm for it because that's where the eye sab comes the anointing comes from revelation revelation is another word for i sav sight giving oh my and we just got to about five pages we better stop i just hope that that uh you know we don't get complacent and think oh this is just easter seal i have easter seal all marked up and then i started listening because even as i sat there and i started seeing things that is just there praise god this word's eternal why does it have to be eternal word because it's talking to eternal beings there's only one thing that can contact eternity when eternity hears from eternity when word hears from word then we're going someplace don't count yourself out don't look at your flesh don't look at the weakness look for the power that can give you power over the flesh god bless you this morning let's stand bilio close and worship [Applause] [Music] oh pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain [Music] saturated my thirsty soul oh come and fall afresh
