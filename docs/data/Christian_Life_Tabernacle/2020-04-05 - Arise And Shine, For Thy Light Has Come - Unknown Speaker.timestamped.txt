[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:10:08] and we know way
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:17] I'll just thank you
[1:10:23] has been a man praise the Lord
[1:10:37] a man it's good to be gathered together
[1:10:39] again though we're gathered and and in a
[1:10:44] way that we're not used to many of us
[1:10:47] just scattered around the Metroplex and
[1:10:50] but we're still approaching the same
[1:10:53] word we're still approaching the same
[1:10:56] Jesus Christ and I would say that what
[1:11:01] you get out of the service tonight is
[1:11:04] going to depend on the way you approach
[1:11:06] the service and what you expect so I
[1:11:10] know being at home and streaming many
[1:11:12] times it's difficult to to enter in but
[1:11:15] we just trust that God will be a portion
[1:11:17] a man let's just go before the Lord in
[1:11:19] prayer Heavenly Father we love you we
[1:11:23] thank you Lord you're the same yesterday
[1:11:26] today and forever
[1:11:28] Gordon you said where two or three are
[1:11:30] gathered in my name I would be in their
[1:11:32] midst Lord we would have maybe not
[1:11:36] foreseen these times where we would be
[1:11:39] scattered abroad and streaming the
[1:11:41] service via technology Lord you're so
[1:11:45] mindful and you're so faithful that we
[1:11:47] know that by the preaching of the word
[1:11:49] and by your promises that you're willing
[1:11:52] you're ready you're able to move on the
[1:11:55] scene of each one Lord I pray as the
[1:11:58] word would go forth Lord may it not be
[1:12:00] my words but may be may it be your
[1:12:03] unsellable word Lord that you would
[1:12:06] speak to your bride Lord she would feed
[1:12:09] the hungry hearts Nord you'd save the
[1:12:11] lost deliver those that are in bondage
[1:12:14] Lord
[1:12:15] bring peace to those that need comfort
[1:12:18] or do those things that only you can do
[1:12:21] now Lord we just ask that you come and
[1:12:24] break the bread of life as only you can
[1:12:26] now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[1:12:28] praise the Lord Amen we'll be reading
[1:12:31] out of Isaiah chapter 60
[1:12:49] I would say brother Andrew if you notice
[1:12:52] this light over here going crazy for me
[1:12:55] if you can maybe cover that or something
[1:12:58] because uh maybe it can be a little
[1:13:02] distracting that it seems maybe only
[1:13:04] when the music's going but we're gonna
[1:13:05] be reading out of Isaiah chapter 60 be
[1:13:10] reading verses one to a man praise the
[1:13:16] Lord
[1:13:17] well a man there's just a few a number
[1:13:22] here in the church building but by God's
[1:13:25] grace there's there's several hands out
[1:13:27] there several hearts out over the
[1:13:29] internet and the airways and we're just
[1:13:32] looking forward to what the Lord has in
[1:13:35] store and I would say that just as you
[1:13:37] would pull on the word being here I
[1:13:39] believe that you can pull on the word in
[1:13:42] your homes and wherever you are at
[1:13:43] whether you're at your job or you're in
[1:13:45] a car wherever you're at God sees you
[1:13:48] there and I believe that if we come with
[1:13:51] an approach and an expectation towards
[1:13:53] the word you're not approaching the man
[1:13:56] you're not approaching this church
[1:13:57] building but you're approaching the
[1:13:59] creator of heavens and earth and he
[1:14:01] knows what's in your heart he knows what
[1:14:04] you have need of and if you would just
[1:14:06] now submit yourself to his will and his
[1:14:08] word and say lord I have a need Lord I
[1:14:11] have questions in my heart Lord I'm
[1:14:13] needing you to come and I'm eating you
[1:14:15] to speak to me and my place of need and
[1:14:18] the Lord according to his word is
[1:14:20] already on his way to speak to you
[1:14:22] reading out of Isaiah chapter 60 a verse
[1:14:26] 1 it says arise shine for thy light has
[1:14:29] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:14:32] upon thee for behold the darkness shall
[1:14:36] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[1:14:38] people but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:14:41] thee and his glory shall be seen upon
[1:14:44] the the prophet of God takes this as his
[1:14:47] text to preach the message Shalom and
[1:14:50] it's his New Year's message to the
[1:14:52] church there in 1964 I believe he
[1:14:54] preached to Shalom January the 12th of
[1:14:57] 1964 and my heart was just moved this
[1:15:01] morning as our pastor drew inspiration
[1:15:03] from there's a man here that can turn on
[1:15:05] the light and brother Branham preached
[1:15:07] that December 29th 1963 just heading
[1:15:10] into the new year that evening he would
[1:15:13] preach look away to Jesus there in
[1:15:15] Jeffersonville and then he would travel
[1:15:17] to Mesa Verde or see Sierra Vista I
[1:15:21] believe it is a Arizona and he would
[1:15:24] preach Shalom and this would be his his
[1:15:27] new year message to the church and you
[1:15:31] know there's not many here so you can
[1:15:32] stand or sit or do whatever you're
[1:15:33] comfortable with so you may be seated
[1:15:47] first that there are so much of that in
[1:15:50] the world today in growing darker and
[1:15:53] darker all the time each year we find
[1:15:55] that the world gets darker spiritually
[1:15:58] speaking because they're groping in
[1:16:00] darkness there's more sin just passing
[1:16:03] through what we have the assassination
[1:16:05] of the president and so forth and people
[1:16:08] being murdered right here in our country
[1:16:10] where we wouldn't think that would
[1:16:12] happen in a time of modern civilization
[1:16:14] but we sure have it because gross
[1:16:17] darkness is upon the people now those
[1:16:20] who will not turn to the light then
[1:16:24] there's only one thing I can say for
[1:16:26] this coming year you're going to stoop
[1:16:28] darker and darker as the year goes on
[1:16:32] but to those who will turn to the light
[1:16:37] then you'll get brighter and brighter
[1:16:40] unto the perfect day that we look for
[1:16:43] his appearing we're all darkness will be
[1:16:47] faded away and the reason of that is why
[1:16:50] I say to the Church of the Living God
[1:16:52] Shalom because we are his light jesus
[1:16:56] said you are the light of the world oh
[1:16:58] if you had just turned to the light this
[1:17:00] evening all rise and shine for thy light
[1:17:03] has come and the glory of the lord has
[1:17:06] risen upon you oh what a time that we're
[1:17:08] living in the prophet of God said that
[1:17:10] the scripture here and I say I want to
[1:17:12] choose prophecy for this hour this time
[1:17:15] that we're living in and he goes on to
[1:17:18] say just further down there and the
[1:17:20] message he says there is some great
[1:17:22] something great laying ahead of us and
[1:17:24] this is what I want to work to it may be
[1:17:28] here towards the the goal or just to say
[1:17:32] that to know that where we're standing
[1:17:34] we're standing in the greatest hour
[1:17:36] that's ever struck humanity
[1:17:38] oh we're one step closer to the change
[1:17:41] of our bodies and there's something
[1:17:43] great laying ahead of us where the years
[1:17:45] has been the joy that's we've looked
[1:17:47] forward to the pressing coming of the
[1:17:50] great light and now we can see it
[1:17:52] breaking over her
[1:17:53] horizon realm it's breaking between
[1:17:56] mortal and immortality we see it
[1:17:59] breaking between heavens and earth from
[1:18:01] earthbound sickness in a troubled world
[1:18:03] into a bright shining day of immortal
[1:18:06] life and an immortal body and an
[1:18:09] immortal earth that shall never pass
[1:18:11] away its Shalom unto the church now it's
[1:18:15] light coming for the believers but gross
[1:18:17] darkness to the people Oh Saints don't
[1:18:20] be discouraged as we see the darkness
[1:18:22] and we see all the sickness we see all
[1:18:24] the calamity in life it's gross darkness
[1:18:27] to the people all but to the bride of
[1:18:29] Jesus Christ arise and shine Shalom
[1:18:32] peace God's peace be unto you because
[1:18:35] we're going into a rapture we're going
[1:18:37] into a body change
[1:18:38] ome in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:18:41] we're going to be changed I'll be
[1:18:43] encouraged be excited we're right here
[1:18:46] at the climatic event of all creation
[1:18:49] that God would have a bride that's been
[1:18:51] called out for his own choosing that's
[1:18:52] gonna be quickened and go into a rapture
[1:18:55] I want to read out of 1st Thessalonians
[1:19:00] 4:16
[1:19:10] it says
[1:19:13] first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord
[1:19:15] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:19:19] shout I just want to say the whole
[1:19:22] church denominational systems and all of
[1:19:26] the religious leaders out there even the
[1:19:30] Jews and all of the religious were out
[1:19:33] there they're all looking for a coming
[1:19:35] Messiah they're all looking for the Lord
[1:19:38] to descend and I want to just make a
[1:19:41] point here in the scripture because if
[1:19:43] you miss this coming you're not going to
[1:19:46] see that coming
[1:19:47] and he says for the Lord himself shall
[1:19:49] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:19:51] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[1:19:54] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:19:56] shall rise first then which we then we
[1:19:59] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:20:01] caught up together with them in the
[1:20:03] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:20:06] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:20:09] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:20:13] words
[1:20:13] I want to I want to comfort you tonight
[1:20:16] with these words that that soon we're
[1:20:19] gonna hear the voice the voice of the
[1:20:22] resurrection and we're going to be
[1:20:23] changed and Paul is admonishing us here
[1:20:27] comfort one another with these words if
[1:20:29] we've ever lived in a day where we could
[1:20:32] be comfort by these words it's this day
[1:20:34] because that's the next breaking that's
[1:20:36] going to come forth we're not looking
[1:20:38] for another song we're not looking for
[1:20:40] something else to happen but what we're
[1:20:41] looking for is to be changed
[1:20:45] all I want to say that the shout has
[1:20:48] brought forth a resurrection from the
[1:20:51] gross darkness it's brought a
[1:20:53] resurrection from the Creed's and the
[1:20:55] and the denomination and the sin that's
[1:20:57] out there in the earth it's the shout
[1:21:00] has brought forth coming out of all of
[1:21:03] the confusion all over the doubt all
[1:21:06] over the fear week when you've heard
[1:21:07] this shout because the shell is the Lord
[1:21:10] descending with a shout calling unto the
[1:21:13] elect calling to the bride it's calling
[1:21:15] you out from the gross darkness that's
[1:21:18] in the world the shout is bringing forth
[1:21:22] a resurrection out of this gross
[1:21:24] darkness and brother
[1:21:26] the brother branham refers to this he
[1:21:28] says it's just like it was there in the
[1:21:30] beginning the world was laying there in
[1:21:33] darkness as it was without form and void
[1:21:35] but God said let there be light
[1:21:38] and then the Spirit of God moved upon
[1:21:41] the earth upon the waters and life came
[1:21:44] into manifestation the prophet of God
[1:21:46] said why did he do that because there
[1:21:48] were seeds laying there in the earth and
[1:21:50] that the only way they they could come
[1:21:52] to manifestation as if the light would
[1:21:55] shine upon that seed and so God said let
[1:21:58] there be light
[1:21:59] you understand that the shell that has
[1:22:01] come in the seventh church eggs there
[1:22:03] were predestinated seeds that have been
[1:22:06] planted here in the lady ocm eggs and
[1:22:08] the Lord Himself has descended with a
[1:22:10] shout look there be light his word is
[1:22:13] light and that light has shined upon
[1:22:15] your heart its shine upon that
[1:22:17] predestinated see it's told you out of
[1:22:19] the world it's called you out of
[1:22:21] denomination it's called you out of
[1:22:23] addictions and drugs and alcohol and
[1:22:26] chasing women and smoking cigarettes why
[1:22:28] because the light has struck that
[1:22:30] predestinated seed paste down on the
[1:22:32] inside of you and it leaped forth to joy
[1:22:35] her eyes and shine my light has come
[1:22:40] God's spoken word manifested his light
[1:22:45] bringing forth life a pastor this
[1:22:48] morning just what a beautiful message we
[1:22:50] heard God spoken word manifested its
[1:22:52] light bringing forth life that's where
[1:22:55] in the very beginning when he said let
[1:22:56] there be light that light was bringing
[1:22:59] forth life and that's what the revealed
[1:23:01] word of the hour has done in this day
[1:23:03] the word is light and that light is
[1:23:06] bringing forth many sons and daughters
[1:23:08] of God into the perfection of his very
[1:23:11] own image oh I know it looks dark but as
[1:23:16] we heard this morning I wanna say fear
[1:23:18] not little sister there's a man here
[1:23:20] that can turn on the light the capstone
[1:23:23] has descended a perfect love is here to
[1:23:26] cast out all your fear perfect love is
[1:23:28] here to test out your doubt perfect love
[1:23:31] is here to settle all your unbelief the
[1:23:35] prophet of God says in shallow many
[1:23:37] people ask why
[1:23:40] they asked somebody asked me why why
[1:23:45] must these things happen
[1:23:47] maybe you're looking around right now I
[1:23:49] wonder why does all this have to happen
[1:23:51] why are we going through this I'm cooped
[1:23:54] up in my home I'm going bonkers I can't
[1:23:57] I can't go out I can't even go to work I
[1:24:00] can't even go to school I'm losing my
[1:24:02] mind the kids are driving me crazy I've
[1:24:04] never spent this much time with my
[1:24:05] husband and all my life I've never spent
[1:24:07] this much time with my kids
[1:24:08] there are usually I don't even know what
[1:24:09] to do with myself why is all this
[1:24:11] happening to me why is all the chaos and
[1:24:13] all the others Liza's Cove at 19 just
[1:24:16] just took them to the whole globe up I
[1:24:18] grip and just shut down the whole
[1:24:20] economy all had money and stops and
[1:24:23] Bosley they plummeted down all my oil
[1:24:25] our reserves are drying up what am I
[1:24:27] gonna do why is all this happening why
[1:24:32] must these things happen why did this
[1:24:36] happen to me why why did I start and
[1:24:38] this happened and I had this trouble
[1:24:41] here and this upset me here and I lost
[1:24:44] this here sometimes I've asked why why
[1:24:50] when I was just a young minister and
[1:24:53] first started out why did God take my
[1:24:57] wife right out from under me take my
[1:25:00] baby girl right from beneath my heart
[1:25:04] why did he do that you could see the
[1:25:10] silver in question here as the Prophet
[1:25:12] my what uh what a sobering thought here
[1:25:18] why did you do that Lord these next
[1:25:22] words are profound he said I didn't know
[1:25:24] I do now I just held my hand in his hand
[1:25:30] and kept trustee he knows every Junction
[1:25:37] the backside of a desert sometimes where
[1:25:40] God moulds righteous men into sages and
[1:25:42] prophets see everything is working out
[1:25:45] for your good I want you to be comforted
[1:25:48] by these words
[1:25:49] eyes and shine soon we're going in a
[1:25:52] rapture oh the rapture cycle has already
[1:25:55] started if you've heard the shout you've
[1:25:57] already been caught up into the rapture
[1:26:00] cycle because the Prophet said the Lord
[1:26:02] does all three while he's descending and
[1:26:04] you have heard the shout therefore you
[1:26:07] have been called out you've been caught
[1:26:10] up into a rapture cycle and as we're
[1:26:12] kneeling that capstone Oh as we near him
[1:26:15] by that word the next thing that's going
[1:26:17] to take place and you're going to be
[1:26:19] challenged hallelujah
[1:26:22] as I thought on these things why why do
[1:26:26] these things have to happen I started to
[1:26:28] think about the disciples imagine the
[1:26:31] confusion and the disappointment and the
[1:26:33] questions why did all these things have
[1:26:36] to happen it just looked like everything
[1:26:39] was setting up just right they had
[1:26:40] received their Messiah
[1:26:41] they had received the one the Word made
[1:26:44] flesh here he was their king and they
[1:26:47] were just wondering when is he when he's
[1:26:49] either gonna let the whole world know
[1:26:50] man this Roman oppression is gonna be
[1:26:51] over with oh he's just gonna start
[1:26:53] plucking them all off by the sword and
[1:26:55] and he's gonna show them who's boss
[1:26:58] but before that could happen all of a
[1:27:03] sudden their Lord is taken and crucified
[1:27:06] and now you have a bunch of people who
[1:27:08] have been called out they've been
[1:27:10] elected they've left everything you'll
[1:27:13] follow the Lord and now the thereé one
[1:27:16] that they were falling has been taken
[1:27:18] from them and he's been crucified and
[1:27:20] put in a tomb or you can imagine the
[1:27:23] confusion you can imagine maybe the
[1:27:25] heartache and the questions and you can
[1:27:28] imagine maybe the people that would
[1:27:30] revile them and maybe family members
[1:27:32] said see I told you he wasn't who you
[1:27:34] thought he was you know you know what
[1:27:37] the things that he said unless you you
[1:27:40] know tear this temple down and I'll
[1:27:42] rebuild in three day see he didn't know
[1:27:44] what he was talking about and all of a
[1:27:47] sudden maybe they start to take the
[1:27:49] scriptures of the quote and they try to
[1:27:51] tear you down but something inside of
[1:27:54] their heart said I don't understand it I
[1:27:56] don't know why but Owen side of me
[1:27:59] something believes I know that that is
[1:28:01] the Messiah you have to come to that
[1:28:03] same resting place with the revealed
[1:28:06] where to the our people can take quotes
[1:28:08] and they can take scriptures and they
[1:28:10] can try to tear the whole picture apart
[1:28:11] but as you've heard from God you've
[1:28:14] heard from your theophany something
[1:28:16] that's sprung for tonight and it's yeah
[1:28:18] and amen and heavens and earth can pass
[1:28:20] away but you'll still be standing upon
[1:28:23] the revelation that is the same
[1:28:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:28:27] hallelujah well what does this all mean
[1:28:29] the Lord's been crucified maybe as we
[1:28:40] think of these things we're nearing our
[1:28:42] Easter Sunday I believe today is Palm
[1:28:44] Sunday I believe it just it wasn't long
[1:28:49] ago before this moment they were saying
[1:28:51] Hosanna Hosanna
[1:28:53] here we come riding on the fall of an
[1:28:56] ass fulfilling Scripture but little did
[1:29:01] the disciples know that he still was
[1:29:03] fulfilling Scripture and I want to say
[1:29:06] in the midst of all your questions in
[1:29:08] the midst of all your confusion in the
[1:29:10] midst of all your doubt he's working on
[1:29:12] your behalf
[1:29:13] he's fulfilling Scripture he's right on
[1:29:15] time you just complete keep believing
[1:29:18] you don't doubt it and here they come
[1:29:21] and John 20 verse 1 it says the first
[1:29:24] day of the week this is after the
[1:29:26] resurrection unbeknownst to them the
[1:29:30] first day that we come with Mary
[1:29:32] Magdalene early when it was yet dark
[1:29:35] under the sepulchre and see if the stone
[1:29:38] taken away from the sepulchre then she
[1:29:42] runneth she cometh the Simon Peter and
[1:29:44] to the other disciples whom Jesus loved
[1:29:47] and saith unto them they have taken away
[1:29:50] the Lord out of the sepulchre we know
[1:29:53] not where they have laid him think of
[1:29:59] this now think of the atmosphere and the
[1:30:02] questions and the things that these
[1:30:05] believers were pondering during this
[1:30:07] time here they had walked with them they
[1:30:10] had handled her bed a
[1:30:12] all that slept with him they had there
[1:30:14] travelled with him he had fed them he
[1:30:17] discerned their their hearts heat he was
[1:30:20] with them they were with them they went
[1:30:22] everywhere he went Lord I'll go wherever
[1:30:24] you go and all of a sudden now these
[1:30:26] heavy hearts are there they're wondering
[1:30:29] what all of this means and they're
[1:30:30] downtrodden maybe and discouraged not
[1:30:33] realizing that they were living during
[1:30:35] the greatest hour that had ever struck
[1:30:37] humankind you realize the hour that they
[1:30:41] were living that all that Jesus said he
[1:30:43] would do he had come now and He
[1:30:45] fulfilled the law he'd laid down his
[1:30:47] life and he had risen on that Easter
[1:30:50] morning the kids Mandira demon had come
[1:30:52] and he had paid the penalty for sin and
[1:30:55] yet power to lay his life down but he
[1:30:57] had power to take that life up again and
[1:30:59] he had risen from the grave declaring
[1:31:02] that he was the mighty Conqueror but his
[1:31:06] believers and his followers don't
[1:31:07] understand what's going on they're their
[1:31:11] eyes are withholding they don't
[1:31:12] recognize what's going on their their
[1:31:14] their discards and their downtrodden and
[1:31:16] the scripture says there in John 20
[1:31:18] verse 9 it says for as yet they knew not
[1:31:21] the scripture that he must rise again
[1:31:24] from the dead
[1:31:26] we have a many good people and many good
[1:31:29] believers living right in this hour and
[1:31:32] yet they don't recognize the scriptures
[1:31:35] must be fulfilled but when the scripture
[1:31:38] is fulfilled and manifested it becomes a
[1:31:41] light to the believer it says for they
[1:31:47] knew not the scripture that must he must
[1:31:49] rise again from the dead then the
[1:31:51] disciples went away the disciples went
[1:31:58] away again unto their home but Mary
[1:32:01] stood without the sepulchre weeping and
[1:32:03] as she wept she stooped down and looked
[1:32:06] into the sepulchre and see if two angels
[1:32:08] in white sitting the one at the head and
[1:32:11] the other at the feet where the body of
[1:32:14] Jesus had lain and see if the two angels
[1:32:18] in white they said unto her woman why
[1:32:21] weepest thou
[1:32:23] she saith unto Him because now listen
[1:32:28] she this is her answer this is what
[1:32:32] she's you know she perceives that has
[1:32:34] happened because they have taken away my
[1:32:37] Lord my wouldn't wouldn't that be be be
[1:32:44] a sad conclusion because they have taken
[1:32:47] away my Lord and I know not where they
[1:32:50] have laid him now she she is withholding
[1:32:53] the revelation of what actually has
[1:32:55] taken place and what actually has been
[1:32:57] manifested and when she had thus said
[1:33:01] she turned herself back and saw Jesus
[1:33:04] standing and knew not that it was jesus
[1:33:09] and jesus saith under woman why weepest
[1:33:13] thou whom seekest thou and she supposing
[1:33:19] him to be the gardener and as i read
[1:33:22] over this it shook my heart that Jesus
[1:33:25] Christ has once a again coming this
[1:33:28] day and he has veiled himself in the
[1:33:30] Ministry of a prophet and many people
[1:33:33] have presumed and wondered oh is this
[1:33:36] the gardener is this just another good
[1:33:38] preacher it's just is this just another
[1:33:41] prophet is this just another flash in
[1:33:43] the pan is this just another one of
[1:33:45] those healing revivalist guys see they
[1:33:47] presumed in their own assumption they
[1:33:50] came to a false conclusion of who he was
[1:33:53] standing there discerning the thoughts
[1:33:56] and intents of the heart and the people
[1:33:58] they miss Jesus Christ veiled in flesh
[1:34:01] and they presumed it to be something
[1:34:04] that it wasn't
[1:34:07] and here even mollies Mary she's a
[1:34:09] believer below know what I love about
[1:34:11] this God's going to reveal himself to
[1:34:15] the elect he's not gonna leave you in
[1:34:18] that condition long the light is gonna
[1:34:20] come and chase away the darkness any
[1:34:23] false conceptions or any false ideas any
[1:34:26] false creeds or any false
[1:34:28] denominationalism don't worry about it
[1:34:30] if you're a predestinate a seat of
[1:34:32] the light of God's Word is coming to
[1:34:34] chase away that darkness out of your
[1:34:36] life he's going to illuminate your path
[1:34:38] that you can walk at all truth and
[1:34:40] righteousness hallelujah
[1:34:42] it says she's supposing him to be the
[1:34:45] gardener saith on him sir if thou had
[1:34:52] been born if thou had been borne him
[1:34:58] hence tell me where thou hast laid him
[1:35:02] and I will take him away
[1:35:05] so here Mary sitting there her she
[1:35:10] perceives her Lord the body of the Lord
[1:35:12] has been taken away she's mourning she
[1:35:16] don't know what to do she just spoke
[1:35:19] with two angels and now she's speaking
[1:35:24] to Jesus and she's perceiving that Jesus
[1:35:28] is a gardener and asking Jesus the Lord
[1:35:31] if you tell me where his body is if you
[1:35:38] notice in verse 15 now when Jesus is
[1:35:41] speaking to her he's Jesus sayeth under
[1:35:43] him woman why weepest thou more of a
[1:35:49] general turn woman and I thought about
[1:35:53] that many times and how the Prophet
[1:35:55] might address the church but there comes
[1:35:58] a time with as the hour and the clock
[1:36:02] ticked on down and the word was opened
[1:36:04] he said I no longer call you Church I
[1:36:07] call you bride dismiss Grace dismiss
[1:36:10] Jesus Christ he started to call you by
[1:36:13] name and Harry Aries he's just in the
[1:36:16] conversation conversations as Jesus said
[1:36:18] under a woman why weepest thou
[1:36:20] and under that maybe conversation or she
[1:36:24] wasn't catching who it was that was
[1:36:26] standing there but then in verse 16
[1:36:28] hallelujah says jesus said unto her Mary
[1:36:31] and when he had spoke her name or
[1:36:34] something took place on the inside of
[1:36:36] Mary and she turned her
[1:36:38] unto Him or would she hide her name be
[1:36:41] called by Jesus Christ
[1:36:43] she turned unto him and said master oh
[1:36:46] when she called her name she recognized
[1:36:49] he was the Lord and this message when
[1:36:51] you catch a revelation okay I got the
[1:36:53] message of the hour it's calling for
[1:36:55] through you hello when he calls your
[1:37:03] name the darkness it's all chased away
[1:37:08] and you turned to the light and there
[1:37:12] that light is bringing forth the seed
[1:37:15] that God placed inside of you and you're
[1:37:17] on a journey to fulfill all the
[1:37:19] potentials that he had placed there I
[1:37:21] think of those disciples on the road to
[1:37:24] Emmaus they were discouraged and here
[1:37:27] the Lord draws nigh unto Him why they're
[1:37:29] walking along the way with their heavy
[1:37:31] hearts and they're discouraged and Jesus
[1:37:34] starts to talk to them and once again
[1:37:37] their eyes are withholding not to know
[1:37:39] who it is that walks with them and there
[1:37:41] he is he's he's walking with him he says
[1:37:44] o fools it slow of heart to believe all
[1:37:47] that the prophets have spoken and he
[1:37:51] expounded within the Scriptures all
[1:37:53] started with the prophet Isaiah all the
[1:37:55] way up until the time I'll prophecy a
[1:37:57] fulfillment that he had done in that day
[1:37:59] and it says there in the evening time he
[1:38:03] was getting a little late it was in the
[1:38:05] evening time and he made like he would
[1:38:08] go away but they could sneak his
[1:38:10] trainers at all oh why don't you just a
[1:38:13] little hearts burn within us as we
[1:38:16] walked and talked with him along the way
[1:38:18] and it was the evening time only in the
[1:38:21] evening time is shall be like look the
[1:38:24] lie I've been withholding from their
[1:38:25] eyes but as he fellowship with him he
[1:38:28] did something familiar to him I believe
[1:38:30] it was much like he did when he called
[1:38:32] Mary's name she said I've heard that
[1:38:34] before and all of a sudden he was there
[1:38:37] in the presence of the disciples and he
[1:38:39] broke the bread of life he did something
[1:38:41] they were familiar to and when they saw
[1:38:43] them break the bread oldest is that's
[1:38:45] him and no doubt it's just like it is
[1:38:47] today
[1:38:48] when you've heard the breaking on the
[1:38:50] line the breaking of the bread Jesus
[1:38:52] Christ he is the bread of life and when
[1:38:55] it's been broken in the third pole has
[1:38:57] been open oh you've heard from your
[1:38:59] theophany it's something that sounds
[1:39:01] familiar that sounds like home to me
[1:39:03] hallelujah your eyes come open all the
[1:39:07] light shines into your soul Oh
[1:39:13] hallelujah the light of God's Word is
[1:39:17] shining brighter and brighter than ever
[1:39:21] before you have nothing to fear I know
[1:39:25] it looks dark I know it looks like you
[1:39:29] might not be able to make it I think of
[1:39:32] the Prophet one time up there on the
[1:39:34] mountain he got caught in the storm he
[1:39:37] thought he to be able to handle it
[1:39:38] but as our prophet as a pastor mentioned
[1:39:41] this morning talking about a reference
[1:39:44] point when you don't have any light you
[1:39:45] go down there in the caverns you when
[1:39:47] you don't have a reference point you
[1:39:48] can't make your way around that's the
[1:39:50] same thing that a blizzard will do same
[1:39:52] thing when the fog sets in oh you have
[1:39:55] no disability you have no reference
[1:39:56] point and there was the Prophet he got
[1:40:00] to know I believe this was the story we
[1:40:02] got into the death march he kept coming
[1:40:04] back around the same point because he
[1:40:06] didn't know where he was and he started
[1:40:09] to just feel like really down on himself
[1:40:11] should I say I'm such an ignorant man
[1:40:14] I'm such an ignorant servant and he and
[1:40:16] he started to wonder you know about his
[1:40:21] situation and all of a sudden I have an
[1:40:24] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[1:40:26] and he thought to them I as many times
[1:40:29] of the Lord had spoke to the Prophet you
[1:40:31] hear many times which chalk it up to
[1:40:34] maybe just the wind or maybe I'm just
[1:40:36] hearing things and I wonder if we don't
[1:40:38] do that many times as a believer though
[1:40:40] the word will go forth and the preacher
[1:40:42] the pastor will stand there preach the
[1:40:44] word and we might presume that he's
[1:40:46] speaking to somebody else we might
[1:40:48] presume and chalk it up to something
[1:40:49] else and here the Prophet ears
[1:40:52] I am the Lord an ever-present help in
[1:40:54] the time of trouble God is our refuge
[1:40:58] and strength a very present help in the
[1:41:00] time of trouble and he says well no I
[1:41:03] must be hearing things and then he says
[1:41:05] and then it came again and he news the
[1:41:07] Lord and he fell down on his knees and
[1:41:11] he cried out to the Lord for the Lord's
[1:41:13] help and as the story goes as he was
[1:41:17] standing there he said something touched
[1:41:18] his shoulder he took he turned around
[1:41:21] and he said all of a sudden they're just
[1:41:23] parted and all of a sudden the Lord
[1:41:25] showed him a clear path all the way to
[1:41:27] hurricane mountain he million hung a
[1:41:29] line up there and if he'd follow the
[1:41:31] line all the way down to the end of the
[1:41:33] mountain there was everything that was
[1:41:34] dear to him I believe his wife and child
[1:41:36] was there and he realized I was walking
[1:41:40] on my way ride cross into Canada to
[1:41:42] certain death but the Lord came and he
[1:41:46] gave him visibility and that's exactly
[1:41:49] what the message of the hour has done we
[1:41:51] were certainly walking straight into
[1:41:53] utter death but the Lord God has come
[1:41:56] God is our refuge and strength a very
[1:41:58] present help in the time of trouble when
[1:42:01] gross darkness is upon the face of the
[1:42:03] earth the light has shined and part of
[1:42:05] the darkness and showed you the way to
[1:42:07] go oh thank you Lord for His Word Psalm
[1:42:14] 27 says the Lord is my light and my
[1:42:18] salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is
[1:42:21] the strength of my life and whom shall I
[1:42:23] be afraid
[1:42:24] verse 5 for in the time of trouble he
[1:42:27] shall hide me in his pavilion in the
[1:42:30] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:42:32] me he shall set me up upon a rock whoa
[1:42:37] he has lifted us up out of the darkness
[1:42:40] Church he's given us the strong rock or
[1:42:42] revelation he said I'll never leave you
[1:42:45] nor forsake you but I'll be with you
[1:42:46] even until the end the prophet of God
[1:42:49] said the believer can see the word made
[1:42:52] flesh but others cannot see it the
[1:42:56] believer can see the word made flesh but
[1:42:58] others cannot see it that's why when the
[1:43:00] prophet Isaiah said in 7:14 therefore
[1:43:03] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:43:05] I behold a virgin shall conceive and
[1:43:07] bear a son and shall call his name
[1:43:08] Emmanuel there stood the Word made flesh
[1:43:12] it was a sign but yet even a wicked and
[1:43:17] adulterous generation that seeks after a
[1:43:19] sign can haven't recognized a sign even
[1:43:23] if it was placed in the sky 28 minutes
[1:43:26] after sunset being illuminated of so
[1:43:29] many miles high as so many miles allied
[1:43:31] but what is the believers see when the
[1:43:33] prophet says no if you look at that
[1:43:35] picture right there and you turn it it's
[1:43:37] our Lord up there oh that doesn't that
[1:43:41] doesn't shake the believer something the
[1:43:43] believer says yes I believe it but a
[1:43:45] wicked and adulterous generation
[1:43:47] continues to go on and say well show us
[1:43:49] a sign
[1:43:50] well prove it to me prove it to me prove
[1:43:52] it to me they can't even recognize the
[1:43:54] sign or the word made flesh because only
[1:43:57] believers can no wonder today when all
[1:44:04] these promises of Malachi 4 Luke 17 in
[1:44:08] Revelations 10 7 have been fulfilled and
[1:44:11] it's a lie to the believer
[1:44:13] all of these things it's God's Word
[1:44:16] that's been manifested it's light unto
[1:44:18] the believer but yet they can't see it
[1:44:21] why because they're wretched they're
[1:44:23] miserable they're poor they're blind and
[1:44:26] naked and they don't know it it's gross
[1:44:29] darkness upon the people oh but what is
[1:44:32] it you're the bride what is it to the
[1:44:35] bride it's a rise and shine for thy
[1:44:39] light has come and the glory of the lord
[1:44:42] has risen upon thee well that's what
[1:44:45] this message is prophet of God says
[1:44:49] continuing in Shalom how can there be
[1:44:51] darkness and light it gots to be
[1:44:54] separated and only one thing separates
[1:44:57] it the word manifested separates it
[1:45:02] presses it to the other side here's the
[1:45:06] darkness on the earth but when the
[1:45:08] manifested word of God the Sun which was
[1:45:11] spoken into existence by the word shows
[1:45:14] itself darkness runs to the other side
[1:45:18] well can you just testify that's what
[1:45:21] God did in your life well I was in gross
[1:45:23] tiredness I was an unbelievable the Word
[1:45:26] of God came and sought me out and once
[1:45:28] the Word of God came it exposed all the
[1:45:31] darkness and it chased the darkness out
[1:45:34] of my life and it exposed a seed that
[1:45:37] was on the inside and it was germinated
[1:45:39] and sprung forth to life and you began
[1:45:42] on that journey to come into the stature
[1:45:44] of a perfect man Ephesians 5:14 says
[1:45:49] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[1:45:52] sleepest this is what the message has
[1:45:56] done
[1:45:56] it's the Scheldt coming forth it's
[1:45:59] awakening the bride wherefore he saith
[1:46:03] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:46:06] the dead and Christ shall give thee
[1:46:09] light the prophet talks about back in
[1:46:13] those days how they were they were
[1:46:14] constantly saying fast pray fast pray
[1:46:17] we're looking for a breaking of a new
[1:46:19] day oh they were they were looking for
[1:46:21] some great revival and no doubt they're
[1:46:24] doing the same thing today o people are
[1:46:26] praying and saying hello or maybe God
[1:46:30] will come and cause a great revival and
[1:46:32] suppress this virus and maybe there'll
[1:46:34] be an outbreak in all the churches and
[1:46:36] everybody starts seeking God but when
[1:46:39] God is revealed and they manifest with
[1:46:41] them they don't want nothing to do with
[1:46:43] it it reminds me of isaiah 4 they say o
[1:46:46] only let me be called a christian only
[1:46:49] let me be a called a follower of jesus
[1:46:51] christ to take away my reproach but i'm
[1:46:54] gonna act any way I want to act I'm
[1:46:55] gonna cut my hair I'm gonna wear makeup
[1:46:58] I'm gonna eat my own bread I don't want
[1:47:01] the word bread I want my own doctrines I
[1:47:03] want my own trees I want to be able to
[1:47:05] speak in tongues because it makes me
[1:47:07] feel good and I want speaking in tongues
[1:47:08] to be the vindication that I'm in I
[1:47:10] don't need the word I just need my
[1:47:14] doctrines and my treats all they don't
[1:47:15] want nothing to do with it but what is
[1:47:20] it they've missed the awakening of the
[1:47:22] bride they've missed the shout of
[1:47:25] Matthew 25 6 and it says and at the
[1:47:30] midnight there was a cry man
[1:47:33] behold the bridegroom cometh well I
[1:47:38] don't know about you but I remember is
[1:47:45] my wedding day approached oh and as you
[1:47:49] near that day I want to say this these
[1:47:52] should be the most happiest words that
[1:47:55] there would ever be for a bride behold
[1:47:57] the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet
[1:48:02] him then all the Virgin's arose and trim
[1:48:05] their laps the Prophet says in the
[1:48:08] rapture he says the first thing comes
[1:48:10] when he starts descending from heaven
[1:48:12] there's a shout what is it it's the
[1:48:15] message to get the people together a
[1:48:17] message comes first
[1:48:19] now lamp trimming time rise and trim
[1:48:23] your lamps what watch was it the seventh
[1:48:27] not the sixth the seventh behold the
[1:48:30] bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[1:48:32] lamps and they did some of them found
[1:48:36] they didn't have any oil in their lap
[1:48:38] see but it's lapped trimming time it's
[1:48:41] Malachi for time and Luke 17 it's Isaiah
[1:48:44] all those prophecies that can perfectly
[1:48:47] set in order for this day the scriptures
[1:48:49] we see it living right here he says what
[1:48:52] is the shout he says it's the message
[1:48:55] going forth first the Living bread of
[1:48:58] life bringing forth the bride oh I want
[1:49:03] to say get in while you still can get in
[1:49:07] while you still can look the death angel
[1:49:09] soon is coming and he looked back there
[1:49:13] and the children of Israel as they ate
[1:49:14] that Passover lamb and they had to apply
[1:49:17] the blood to the doorpost now how did
[1:49:20] they know what to do to prepare
[1:49:22] themselves for the Exodus they didn't
[1:49:27] get a committee together and get a
[1:49:29] little committee together - hey guys

[1:49:39] committee together we'll get the elder
[1:49:41] we'll put them all together and we're
[1:49:42] just gonna come up with a system to get
[1:49:45] out of here oh I heard the death angels

[1:49:49] the death angel that he'll pass over our
[1:49:52] house we're it's going to kill the
[1:49:53] firstborn of every household no but what
[1:49:56] did they have they had thus said the
[1:49:59] Lord from a prophet God's Word came to
[1:50:03] His Prophet just according to the
[1:50:04] scripture he does nothing except he
[1:50:07] reveals it to his his secrets to his
[1:50:09] servants the Prophet
[1:50:10] therefore the children of Israel under
[1:50:12] that prophets message could know for a
[1:50:15] surety if I've taken the word from the
[1:50:17] Prophet and I've applied it to my life
[1:50:20] the death angel is going to pass over me
[1:50:22] and soon and very soon I'm gonna go in a
[1:50:25] body change hallelujah that's what we're
[1:50:28] living for I want to say that if you
[1:50:33] miss the shout because what did he say
[1:50:37] what is the shout it's the message going
[1:50:40] forth first the Living bread bringing
[1:50:43] forth the bride at the midnight cry
[1:50:46] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:50:49] to meet him if you miss the shout you
[1:50:53] have missed the rapture if you miss the
[1:50:59] shout that is God's provided way for you
[1:51:04] to go into the rapture now I'm not
[1:51:06] putting a period on that because I
[1:51:08] believe there's moms
[1:51:09] and there's dads who are praying for
[1:51:11] their sons and for their daughters and
[1:51:13] all that your love will be there I'm not

[1:51:17] what I am saying if you want to be sure
[1:51:19] that you know that you know take the
[1:51:21] message and listen to the shell that God
[1:51:23] has given because it's calling you out
[1:51:25] from the gross darkness on the earth and
[1:51:27] it's making you arise and shine into the
[1:51:30] rapture Oh glory to God the message has
[1:51:35] introduced us to Christ the word it's
[1:51:38] restored us back it's given us
[1:51:40] quickening power

[1:51:44] that belief well if that spirit that
[1:51:49] raised up Christ from the dead dwell in
[1:51:51] you it will quicken
[1:51:53] your mortal body and the rising of the
[1:51:57] Sun the Prophet says look what we've
[1:51:58] seen in this day the quickening power
[1:52:01] has come to us to open the seven seals
[1:52:04] what was that the intelligence of man no

[1:52:42] seals he is those seals for the whole
[1:52:46] Word of God as Christ in Christ is the
[1:52:50] seals that was opened

[1:52:55] revealing Christ and the very seven
[1:52:59] angels which represented the seven
[1:53:02] churches all completed and we couldn't
[1:53:05] even see it they took the picture not us

[1:54:19] that's none other than God that's
[1:54:22] unknown other than the word shining a
[1:54:24] light into your path and he still
[1:54:27] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:54:29] the bride's heart today or if you'll
[1:54:31] just be hold them in all of his glory
[1:54:33] the quickening power of the opening and
[1:54:36] the revealed word of the hour it will

[1:54:40] heart it'll tell you what you should do
[1:54:42] what you shouldn't have done and we're
[1:54:44] done at what your going to be because
[1:54:45] you are the bride without spot or
[1:54:47] wrinkle
[1:54:48] oh I'm reminded as we just work towards
[1:54:54] the close here I'm reminded of Abraham
[1:54:58] how God had given him a promise and you
[1:55:01] just think now here's the bride in the
[1:55:03] end time we received the manifested word
[1:55:07] of the hour
[1:55:08] we're ripening in the presence of the
[1:55:10] Sun and we're waiting for a moment in a
[1:55:13] twinkling of an eye that we're going to
[1:55:15] be changed well that's what I'm looking
[1:55:18] forward to I'll comfort one another with
[1:55:20] these words
[1:55:21] be encouraged we're looking to go into
[1:55:25] the changing of our bodies that's the
[1:55:27] promise that's been given the believer
[1:55:29] amen and here is a is the son of God
[1:55:34] who's received a promise that he's going
[1:55:36] to have a son and there he is in the
[1:55:39] plains of Mamre Abraham's there with his
[1:55:41] wife Sarah and what is he doing he's
[1:55:44] believing hey the lord the lord the lord
[1:55:47] promised us it's going to happen Sarah I
[1:55:50] don't know when but the Lord promised
[1:55:52] it's going to happen and there he is
[1:55:54] he's there maybe they're there are just
[1:55:58] there in the I believe it's there in the
[1:56:00] afternoon and and all of a sudden God
[1:56:02] says you know come here Michael we're
[1:56:04] going down to visit Abraham come here
[1:56:07] Gabriel I wanna create a body for you to
[1:56:09] step in Oh
[1:56:11] now Michael go on down Gabriel and then
[1:56:14] God created the body for himself and he
[1:56:16] shipped him in that body and he walked
[1:56:18] up to Abraham and there he deserves the
[1:56:22] thoughts and intents of her heart in the
[1:56:23] prophecies and what was the last sign
[1:56:26] they had before that promised son that
[1:56:29] they'd waited on all these years to come
[1:56:31] back was God standing in the form of a
[1:56:34] man and could discern the thoughts that
[1:56:37] was in Sarah's heart Sarah be in the
[1:56:41] church representing the church discern
[1:56:43] the thoughts that's in the church that
[1:56:45] was even behind him is that right and
[1:56:47] immediately after that she changed back
[1:56:51] to a young woman and him a young man and
[1:56:54] Isaac was brought on the scene the
[1:56:56] promised son I believe you're seen the
[1:57:00] last thing that will happen to the
[1:57:02] church before the rapture the last sign
[1:57:06] that Abraham received before the body
[1:57:09] change because we know that Abraham and
[1:57:12] Sarah received a body change to bring
[1:57:15] forth the promised son and he said that
[1:57:18] last sign that was given to them before
[1:57:21] the body change was the discerning of
[1:57:24] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:57:25] the last sign that was given before
[1:57:28] Sodom was burned up in fire was the
[1:57:30] discerning of the thoughts and intents
[1:57:32] of the heart it was none other than the
[1:57:34] manifestation of the promised word for
[1:57:37] this hour the revealing of the Son of
[1:57:39] Man Revelations 10 7 we have seen the
[1:57:42] manifestation of the Lord and in his
[1:57:44] light we have received our side we're
[1:57:47] not looking for another side I'm not
[1:57:49] looking for another gospel I'm not
[1:57:51] looking for something else to come we
[1:57:53] have received our last sign and the next
[1:57:56] thing that's going to come is the change
[1:57:59] of our bodies well thank you lord we are
[1:58:06] laying in the presence of the Sun just
[1:58:11] to move forward quickly
[1:58:13] we're reverencing Luke chapter 17 says
[1:58:17] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:58:19] it be in the days of the Son of Man
[1:58:24] and in verse 28 likewise also as it was
[1:58:29] in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:58:30] drank and they bought they sold they
[1:58:32] planted they builded but the same day
[1:58:34] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[1:58:36] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:58:39] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[1:58:43] in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:58:46] revealed now I just want to take my time
[1:58:48] to read a quote here because many times
[1:58:51] we have the question well who is this
[1:58:53] son of man what is this son of man what
[1:58:56] is the revealing of the son of man how
[1:59:01] did the rising of the Sun it says now
[1:59:03] who is this son of man in the beginning
[1:59:07] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:59:09] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:59:13] made flesh and dwelt among us and all of
[1:59:16] the teachings that we have and
[1:59:18] confirmations of the Word of God by Word
[1:59:22] of God by signs by wonders we see today
[1:59:25] rather than the Book of Luke here as we
[1:59:27] just quoted from Luke the 17th chapter
[1:59:29] in the 30th verse now Malachi 4 and the
[1:59:33] different scriptures that we are
[1:59:34] acquainted with that the word again is
[1:59:37] waved over the people that the dead
[1:59:41] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[1:59:43] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:59:46] the Holy Spirit right amongst us and
[1:59:49] giving us life Christ was the first one
[1:59:53] to raise from all the prophets and so
[1:59:55] forth all those types in many places
[1:59:58] he was the firstfruits of those that
[1:59:59] slept in the bride coming of Christ
[2:00:02] coming out of the church there'll have
[2:00:04] to be a sheath waved again in the last
[2:00:07] days waving of the sheaf what was the
[2:00:11] sheaf the first one to mature the first
[2:00:16] one that proved it was a wheat that
[2:00:19] proved it was a sheaf hallelujah I'm
[2:00:21] sure you see what I'm talking about
[2:00:23] it was waved over the people and the
[2:00:26] first time there will come forth for the
[2:00:28] bride aged for a resurrection out of
[2:00:31] dark denominationalism will be a message
[2:00:33] that the full maturity of the world has
[2:00:37] back again in his full power and being
[2:00:40] waved over the people by the same signs
[2:00:42] and wonders that he did not there
[2:00:43] because I live ye live also speaking to
[2:00:47] his wife because I live you live also
[2:00:49] what a resurrection that was now he
[2:00:53] speak what a resurrection that was when
[2:00:56] Jesus Christ he arose from the grave
[2:00:58] that Easter morning but he says and what
[2:01:01] a resurrection this is why because the
[2:01:04] church that had been cut off there in
[2:01:06] the dark ages and the life had gone away
[2:01:08] from the church it had started to sprout
[2:01:10] back through through Luther and through
[2:01:12] Wesley through justification through
[2:01:15] sanctification through the outpouring of
[2:01:17] the Holy Ghost but now it is coming back
[2:01:19] in the fullness of his power and the
[2:01:21] quickening power of the Holy Ghost what
[2:01:24] a resurrection this is to be quickened
[2:01:27] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[2:01:29] Jesus by God's quickening power oh we
[2:01:32] don't have a partial word we don't have
[2:01:34] a partial truth we have the full chart
[2:01:37] truth we had before without the fool I
[2:01:40] shining in the evening time setting the
[2:01:43] rise and shine my bride for my light has
[2:01:47] come all come out from the gross
[2:01:49] darkness arise and shine it's time to go
[2:01:52] in a rapture glory wealthy musicians
[2:01:57] would come
[2:02:03] Oh hallelujah full power and full
[2:02:06] authority has been restored back to the
[2:02:10] believer and we've seen it in the first
[2:02:13] one that came to maturity with the power
[2:02:16] of the spoken word to speak to the storm
[2:02:18] little fishy I give you back your life
[2:02:22] storm you go back to where you came from
[2:02:25] we saw the first one come to maturity we
[2:02:29] saw the fullness of the word taking on
[2:02:32] flesh and now in the bride coming of God
[2:02:35] the fullness of the word is coming in
[2:02:38] flesh once again
[2:02:40] hallelujah first Corinthians 13:10 says
[2:02:45] but when that which is perfect is come
[2:02:47] then that which is in part is done away
[2:02:52] with prophet of God said we have the
[2:02:55] perfect interpretation of the word with
[2:02:59] divine vindication then that which is in
[2:03:03] part is done away with when I was a
[2:03:06] child I spake as a child I understood as
[2:03:09] a child but when I became a man I put
[2:03:13] away childish things because the
[2:03:16] fullness of the word has come now we can
[2:03:19] ripen in the presence and come into the
[2:03:21] fullness of the stature of a perfect man
[2:03:26] first John 2 8 says because the darkness
[2:03:29] has passed and the true light now shine
[2:03:32] ahthe we're not living in the glare of
[2:03:34] another age not living by a partial
[2:03:38] light but there shall be light in the
[2:03:41] evening time prophet says in Shalom the
[2:03:46] word is light when it's vindicated until
[2:03:50] the word that is promised for this day
[2:03:52] is vindicated then it's not light it
[2:03:56] cannot be if God said let there be light
[2:03:58] and no Sun come into existence there's
[2:04:01] no sign of light but when God said let
[2:04:03] there be light
[2:04:04] then there was light when God promised a
[2:04:06] messiah Messiah come then his word was
[2:04:09] fulfilled and he was the light of the
[2:04:11] hour
[2:04:12] when he promised Noah and he promised
[2:04:15] the others and on down they was the
[2:04:18] light of the hour and there's a light of
[2:04:20] the hour today that Jesus Christ in the
[2:04:24] power of his resurrection his word
[2:04:27] that's promised for this day the works
[2:04:29] that I do shall you do also greater than
[2:04:33] this shall you do for I go to the Father
[2:04:35] greater works greater things than he did
[2:04:38] you believe it you believe it all
[2:04:42] they're out on the other ways do you
[2:04:43] believe it I believe it it seems so
[2:04:47] humble it seems like he goes over the
[2:04:50] top of people's heads look when he was
[2:04:52] here on earth how could you do greater
[2:04:55] works I translated that many times no
[2:04:58] more but that's the same thing greater
[2:05:02] he said and Saint John 14:12 greater
[2:05:05] works than this shall you do did you
[2:05:08] notice when you went to make water into
[2:05:09] wine he took water first
[2:05:11] already created substance and turned it
[2:05:13] into wine and when he fed 5,000 he took
[2:05:17] a fish that once swam in the water broke
[2:05:19] it and handed it out and multiplied
[2:05:22] creation he took bread that once was
[2:05:25] wheat baked it into bread broke it and
[2:05:26] hung it out
[2:05:27] handed it out to the people and returned
[2:05:30] back again and multiply creation but in
[2:05:32] the last days where there is no sign of
[2:05:36] creation he speaks it into creation
[2:05:39] anyhow shows that he's the same God that
[2:05:42] was in the beginning he can create
[2:05:44] squirrels he can create whatever he
[2:05:47] wants to because he's God and if he said
[2:05:51] I'll have a bride listen to me now if he
[2:05:54] said I'll have a bride without spot or
[2:05:57] wrinkle he can do whatever he wants to
[2:06:00] do
[2:06:00] oh not only is the bride washed not only
[2:06:05] are you forgiven but you're justified
[2:06:07] Wow because you are his creation your
[2:06:11] of him it was his desire to have a bride
[2:06:14] of his own choosing he can do what he
[2:06:17] wants to do and he sipped his word to
[2:06:19] call you forth out of the gross darkness
[2:06:22] of sin will you be my wife will you be
[2:06:25] my bride
[2:06:26] will you arise out of the darkness of
[2:06:28] late you'll see will you come in a union
[2:06:31] with the heavenly bridegroom and be my
[2:06:34] bride oh that's what his purpose in his
[2:06:38] heart the hidden mystery before the
[2:06:40] world was ever formed and as the bride
[2:06:45] comes to the headstone oh she's becoming
[2:06:49] more and more like him because of the
[2:06:51] word it's time to rise and shine church
[2:06:54] for the glory of the Lord has risen in
[2:06:58] you the bride coming of Christ all we
[2:07:02] have seen one come to maturity the
[2:07:04] messenger came according to the light of
[2:07:07] the promise and wasn't light the Prophet
[2:07:10] came manifested the prophesied word and
[2:07:14] it was light and now the word has spoken
[2:07:17] of a bride without spot or wrinkle and
[2:07:20] the message was to the bride and as the
[2:07:23] word is taking on your flesh it is the
[2:07:27] light of the hour hallelujah let's stand

[2:08:50] all he said he can create whatever he
[2:08:53] wants to because he's gone he said he
[2:08:57] would have a bride and here's a bride
[2:09:00] here she is
[2:09:02] oh maybe is she's scattered out through
