in the presence of the Lord certainly want to welcome amen the few that are here you welcome you in the house of God this morning and those that are still streaming from home we welcome you too God bless you happy to be Gather in his presence we're going to invite brother Mike for our ssal reading this morning amen God bless you good morning we're going to read out of Psalm 31 this morning you know and Psalm 31 is um it's all about David being uh finding that place of rest finding that refuge in his presence when surrounded by all of the pressures and all of the storms and all of the all of the concerns of life you know I was really just reading it the other day and uh specific verse stuck out to me in in chapter 31 it was in uh Psalm 31:19 and it's toward the end after he's been doing battle with all of these external pressures he says oh how great is thy goodness which thou Hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou Hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion that's right from The Strife of tongues you know and that verse stuck out to me because we're in a we're in a significant time for this country you know for the last several months we have been surrounded by the voices of the sons of men shouting in the pride of man you know how using the tumult of tongues about how they have something to trust and they have a message that we need to listen to and they have a voice and every bit of it is nothing but the pride of man from the sons of man and what sticks out to me in verse 19 19 is how that you know it it it says that uh it talks about a people that trust in him before they put their trust in any of the sons of men you know there's a promise that he will hide them in the secret of his presence away from the pride of man that's all this is is the pride of man you know and that he will keep them secretly in a pavilion ion from The Strife of tongues doesn't matter whose message wins it doesn't matter whose voice wins it doesn't matter which man which son of man and the pride of man they think is going to win this thing at the end of the day nothing changes a thing for those that put their trust in him because they are hidden in the Pavilion the secret place of his presence and as I was looking at that the scripture came to my mind from Exodus 33 of a time where Moses was fellowshipping with the Lord and the Lord told him my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest yes and down in verse 21 it says and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock that's right and it shall come to pass when my Glory passeth by yes that I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and it was is there in that secret place that he witnessed the presence of the Lord that's right you know so I'm encouraged by that promise and in the beginning of Psalm 31 as David begins to speak he cries out to the Lord he says Lord be thou my rock my secret place my Dwelling Place hidden away in your presence so to this morning I'd like to read Psalm 31 and let's just be encouraged to trust in him that he may hi Us in the secret of his presence Psalm 31 in thee O Lord do I put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness bow down thine ear to me Deliver Me speedily be thou my strong Rock for in House of Defense to save me for thou art my rock and my Fortress therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me pull me out of the net that they have laid privy for me for thou art my strength into thine hand I commit my spirit thou Hast redeemed me oh Lord God of truth I have hated them that regard lying vanities but I trust in the Lord I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou Hast considered my trouble thou Hast known my soul in adversities and has not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou has set my feet in a large room have mercy upon me oh lord for I am in trouble mine eye is consumed with grief yay my soul and my belly for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength fath because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed I was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my neighbors and a fear to my acquaint they that did see me without fled from me I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind I am like a broken vessel for I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life but I trusted in thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my God my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy Mercy's sake let me not be ashamed oh lord for I have called upon thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave let the lying lips be put to silence which speak Grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous oh how great is thy goodness which thou has laid up for them that fear thee which thou Hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues blessed be the Lord for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong City for I said in my haste I am cut off from before Thine Eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I Cried unto thee oh love the Lord all ye

God bless you you may be seated this morning and just for a moment it will kind of uh give everybody an update on sort of what's uh transpired so a couple weeks ago you know that uh um I got a report that some people uh Within our body had uh tested positive and not knowing who they were or uh what the condition was we decided to go ahead and uh stop our uh coming together for a couple weeks so we could find out if there was any spreading if there was any uh uh uh you know how sick people were and so we found out that there hasn't seemed to be any more cases of and the people that have had it have had just like flu like symptoms they get aches and body pains for a couple days uh and then uh they're tired for a few days and then it's not long that they're back normal and that it's just something that's just just going to have to cycle and uh uh we know there's hundreds of thousands of people that have this uh virus we know that some people have died from it mostly elderly people that have pre-existing conditions most of the deaths have been in nursing homes where people were were being taken care of because they were rather the real young people get sick they get over it and they go on and uh so you can't stay shut down forever you know what I mean so uh so that's what why that we've started to uh uh go back to normal so we put some precautions in place this week and uh we'll see what how that develops and we'll start lifting them and moving forward and getting back to normal to where all our seats can be filled up again and we can have extra aisles and we can move all the pews back in here and we can be just as cramped and crowded as we used to be I I know everybody kind of likes the uh likes the space but we're trying to create space so uh we did send an email out to you and we noticed in the email that uh because our service numbers are down and our attendance is down just remember that our expenses keep going forward so we need all of us to help uh together so don't don't think that out of sight out of mind okay so uh and so of course next week I expect there to be more people back here than this morning but it's nice to preach to you this morning it's better in the four people I preached to last Sunday so uh we're grateful for that um I want this morning um to listen to 23 minutes of a message called the countdown and if I was to title my sermon this morning I would call it almost zero almost zero and there's a principle I I think the the important thing as believe belies uh in the word of God and we know this morning that there's churches all over on every corner and everybody has a interpretation of the scripture what they feel the scripture means what parts of the scripture that they feel is important and Every Man compared to man would have a right to his interpretation so I couldn't look at another man and say my interpretation right your in interpretation wrong because what makes us different right I'm a man reading it and making my interpretation and the other gentleman is a man reading it making his interpretation and therefore all of our interpretations would be equal and of course then I would go out and I would share what I feel my interpretation is and how and I would assemble people together and we would get together and we would all agree that this is the right interpretation and we'd start a church and then we'd get other churches and other churches and it's all man-made but there comes a time where God inserts himself into the picture and God always inserts himself in the picture by sending a messenger that's how God's always done it in the Old Testament that's how he does it in the church ages he sends a message so God comes in and now he is now going to provide the correct interpretation of the word of God well what would separate him from all the other men that had the interpretation of the Gospel what would separate him what would make him different that he would have to be Vindicated there would have to be a certain sign a certain uh Ministry that came from above to to vindicate this Messer that he was the messenger that had the correct interpretation ation of the word of God and the correct interpretation never forms a denomination or a system it deals with individuals in their own personal life living the word of God as they're being led of the spirit of God so I I feel as you know I believe that God did send a messenger that he did intervene in the lives of the Gentile Church send a prophet messenger with the signs and wonders the same signs and wonders that were worked in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ were worked again in this day so the Gentiles would been able to see the same sign that the Jews saw and then God in this great Justice uh promised the Gentiles a messiah Prophet that would come as son of man Ministry God veiled in flesh doing signs and wonders and that was the son of God to the Gentile church since there's only one son of God he raised up a redeemed Prophet Redeemed by the blood of the lamb and work those same signs in his ministry as a veil so it was the Lord Jesus doing the work through a prophet to the Gentile age the that they too would have the true word of God how many believe Jesus had the true interpretation of the book of of the Old Testament that's right he says I've not come to do away with the LA I've come to fulfill it every jot and every tit is fulfilled in my Ministry I'm the complete fulfillment of everything that was spoken and then we have that same promise the Gentiles do that we would have the interpretation of the New Testament revealed to us in our day Vindicated by signs and wonders now the world may not see that but I can't help it I've seen it amen and I believe it now this morning I want to read something to you and it's a a paragraph here and and it's the foundation of what that we want to listen to okay so so and listen to this very carefully you'll hear it when we play the tape all these natural things all these natural happenings now let me read it this again all these natural happenings now they forerun spiritual happenings each happening a accomplishes now each happening accompanies the other happening only it improves it now I just want to um not I know I'm not a good reader but I I'll I'll go it again and just express to you all these natural happenings now they are for they forerun spiritual happenings each happening accompanies the other happening only it improves it so we know that all this that's happening now this thing with the virus this thing with the worldwide pandemic the thing with the uh uh the politics these things with these different social movements and and uh uh uh riding in some places and and uh unemployment in others and and and all the turmoil the borderers shut down traveling shut down uh people in fear uh sickness having people pass away all those all the those happenings H are are just forerunning that there's a spiritual happening so all these happenings and what they do is they accompany one another but they only improve it so there in all what's going on there is a carnal achievement that is trying to be achieved by all these things that are transpiring okay there's something that is going to come out of it right you know whether we're all driving electric cars uh you know what I mean or or you know whether we wear face masks for the rest of our lives or end up walking around in bodysuits you know what I mean I don't know there's something that's being achieved something is changing something is trans transpiring that's causing changes and and also along with that there are spiritual happenings and spiritual changes so God is using what's going on to accomplish something and to achieve something what is transpiring did not sneak in on the Lord you know what I mean he wasn't caught by surprise you know uh he told us man would fool around with the test tubes and they would look up and they would just turn their heads back down and they would keep fooling with those test tubes and what would come out of it was death and destruction and sickness that's I I don't know what to tell you I don't know what it takes to stir us up when we see so many many uh things that have been prophesied to our generation coming to pass how about how about the car that drives itself I mean this wasn't thought of in 1970 or that 1940 something seeing a car that drives itself and we've got them we've actually have them what what what day does the light go on what time do we shake ourselves out of our complacency what time do we realize that the world is going and it's going in a direction and it's making changes and there's a kingdom and there's a God of this evil age and there's a Satan's Eden that that this great this great uh uh Lucifer is trying to build and then God has an achievement when could when we sit back and say okay the natural things that are transpiring only are companions to the spiritual things that are transpiring so something spiritual is going on for the believer there's something that's transpiring spiritually that go that God is trying to achieve something that he's trying to bring us to some place he's trying to get us to something he's trying to accomplish and so we want to look past what's transpiring on the outside and we want to find out what's happening in the spiritual and there's and so uh in these few moments I just we just like you to listen as he tries to express to us to look at the natural look at how it's come up look how it's transpired look how it's been going over the church ages and over the time and and so what what are we coming to we're coming to something yes that's what I want to get in tune with I want to get in tune with what are we coming to what is the achievement that God's trying to achieve what what is it that he's trying to get us to there's there's a great purpose of it and let me just read this he says but God in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backward he's going forward looking into the word and believing the promise for the things that never has come yet amen oh my I'm telling you I know this is terrible I mean I've never I'm that there's some of you that are watching I hope you're watching I hope that U you got dressed and you're sitting there like you're going to church uh they did a big study now and they're telling people that work at home to go ahead and get dressed and and and like you're working at home you're more productive Ive you feel better uh you know but uh I I hope you're there this morning and realize that there's something that we've got to be looking to and forward we can't let this thing have a toll on us and I'm telling you it's having a toll I will get to that in a a few moments but let's stand together and we'll read this a scripture we'll listen listen to these next 23 minutes of this message the countdown it it's the the date is um uh February 9th uh 64 and uh me see if I can find out if it was uh preached uh in Bakersfield California uh uh at the fairgrounds there in Bakersfield in 1964 let us read the scripture found in Hebrews the 11th chapter and just remember the quat for things that never has come yet now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were made of things which do not appear our gracious father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen things that are seen were not he said by faith so that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear in other words something is being made by what's going on now and that's what you want to make sure you get out of what God is spiritually creating by the events that are transpiring now God bless you you may be seated as we pick up uh these next 23 minutes Lord bless you practically to every nation of the heavens I've seen all kinds of gods and all kinds of religions but there's none of it true but Christianity it's the only one even nature itself it speaks for Christianity God the Creator look there is life death Buel Resurrection Resurrection the you can't go outside without seeing it watch the leaves come on in the spring watch them get to their youth in their old and their middle age and then their old age and the veins and the leaves packing the life few minutes you find out it isn't long before any Frost Falls or anything them leaves drop off and what happens the life that's in that tree that sap goes down into the Roots if it didn't the winter coal would kill the tree kill the life it can't stay up it's got to go down and bury itself but in the spring of the Year here comes back with a new Leaf again it's testifying there is a life a death a burial a resurrection everything tighten we just can't get from it watch the sun when it's Rises of a morning the Sun that lights the skies it's a little baby rocked in its mother's arms when it's weak not very much light not very strong then about 8:00 it starts off to school at 11:30 she's graduated and it's out of high school and out of college then she's in her strength from about 12 till about 2: then she begins to get weak weaker weaker weaker and finally she gets real weak like an old man or a woman goes down is that the end of it she comes back the next morning you testify there is a resurrection and a life beyond death everything testified all nature testifies the word testifies to to it the very Spirit itself that's in our heart testifies to it something within us calling out that there is a resurrection of the dead so you see to say if everything serves God's purpose it's got a resurrection but it can only rise if it serves God's purpose if a flower lives and is not deratization but you can can't keep anything in the ground that serves God's purpose it comes forth again to testify of the Resurrection we know that all these things are right there are testimonies to us to encourage us each day everywhere you look you see God there is a natural body of people there is a spiritual body of people there is a natural bride I've had the privilege of marrying fine young couples I never think of it unless I uh kind of turn them around little superstitions and I face with my back to the East and them looking to the East and as I look at them I think of their hearts beating is one Christ and his bride there is a natural bride and but if there is a natural bride it's only a testimony there is a spiritual bride there is a spiritual bride because there is a natural bride all these natural happenings now they forerun spiritual happenings each happening accompanies the other happening only it improves it you say what's like that well something like a spiritual life when it comes into the natural life it improves the natural life it it makes you in a better condition than you was in the natural life when the leaf is getting old and dies when it comes back with the life again in the resurrection to testify in another year it comes back in a better condition than it did when it went down see everything testifies of these things now let's take for instance the achievement that man has been uh able to do on Earth in all of these natural achievements now if I want your undivided attention now the all the natural achievements uh happened in the Earth has been forerunners of spiritual achievements that God has done by his church all the Natural Things Are type of the spiritual things now you say how is that let's take for one Transportation first the transportation was by horse the next it was by automobile then science build us an airplane and but you see it is uh first was one horsepower the car was maybe 20 horsepower the airplane goes up to hundreds of horsepower see what it is it's just as we come on with the horse then an automobile was made then the next thing was an airplane we just keep achieving on higher and higher going greater and greater this is the achievement of science this is a forerunner of the spiritual things that's happened of God by his Spirit has been in his promised word the natural Man by the knowledge looks backward for his achievement that's scienceall see to what God has done in a farmer creation they go out and pick up clouds and get pieces of rocks and fossils and and elements and ties them together see on that achievement they are taking what God has done and perverting it from its original estate and making his living quarters and so forth and his economy a little better by what has been created that's in the natural achievement by man but God in the spiritual achievement is going farward not going backward he's going farward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that never has come yet for the spiritual Revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised he sees them come to pass just as the scientist in his laboratory are working on different things to help man take in creation the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God promised that has never yet been created the natural man looks backward the spiritual man looks forward that's the way they got got that in the church the natural church member looks back says what finny sanki KNX Calvin that was all right but that was their date we're looking forward for something else a promise that's greater than higher and what God has promised science goes back to pick it up we go forward in the word of the Lord to find what God has achieved in these two things one forerun the other or typ now as science has been able to achieve more horow as he did by taking the power and making greater instruments OS and airplanes God has achieved from the same manner as each one of those tipe now watch way back in the days of Luther their power was horse power and then God by getting Luther in his hands controlled out of a great organization or system he let the man see that the just shall live by faith and when he was able to achieve justification and preach it the church come to life it come to life it begin to move just a little bit back ear the days of the Hors Powers when horow was about ready to fade out of the carriage and horse and buggy now he achieved justification and through do that then the church received Life by Believing on Jesus Christ not taking some you say I believe the church I believe this to believe him is life justified by faith Luther preached it that was tiped by the har and buggy days then he got a man in England by the name of John Wesley under his control to take out all the isms away from him and he was able by John Wesley to bring into the church sanctification sanctification raised a church to its feet and got it able to walk now at the end of Wesley's age was the automobile we realized the when into the Wesley church I mean not see Ever every reformer comes at the end of the age now we find out that Wesley in last of his church age it come in just before the Pentecostals well we see that the church got strength enough through sanctification to walk away from the things of the world sanctifying means separate for the glory of God it too bad it lost that but it got strength enough Luther give it life back in the horse and buggy day Wesley got it on its feet to walk and sanctification separating from the things of the world through that come the little branches off like the pilgrim Holiness and nazarin and whatever more come from that through sanctification but remember they couldn't stay still the pillar of fire moved out and they come to ausa Street here in count California and then what did it do it represented the airplane days from the automobile when they God was able but the right Brothers to or the man was to achieve an airplane that could fly immediately forerunning that the zeusa street Pentecost fell and man tucked to the air into the supernatural to the unknown he spoke with unknown tongues he done unknown things that was foreign to the church because he had tuck off of the ground he left the air into the air what did it immediately after the airplanes come on he tuck to the air God showed by the airplanes that his church was arising he shows by the Natural Things what's happening in the spiritual they always follow just like the wise man following the star to find Christ after following for two years now notice all those things are achievements that man has achieved only are types and shadows of what God is to do he always does it that way he's told us the signs that would be in the skies the things that would be happening just before the coming of Christ we see that now it's only a pointing post and we see signs how they have achieved and how God has achieved by his church does a man riding an airplane you don't want no horse and buggy no more unless you just want a little fun but the horse and buggy remember what is the power in the airplane just more horses at it that's all and so when John Wesley found sanctification uh set aside work from justification he never condemned justification he only added more power to it and when the Pentecostals found the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts they never denied sanctification or justification they just got more power and raised up God went up because he found more power see all those things foreshadowing as they come up if we had time we could really stay on that but we haven't but he raised up as science achieved something Looking Backward God chieves going this way going forward to the kingdom now we find from isusa Street the planes tuck off in great revivals and swept the world to the unknown in the Heavenly places speaking unknown tongues with unknown gifts to the world why they thought they were fanatics but they had been able God got a group of people in his hands got a little crosseyed negro man down here in the zeusa street that had no more sense than to believe what God Said was the truth that's right see when a science has got to get a lot of sense in a man's head of wisdom of knowledge to go back and find these things God's got to get what he's got in him out of him so he can use him one going this way and one going that way one's going down the other's going up amen now she left these inter churches grounded when the Pentecostal tuck off with speaking in tongues and great gifts of healing they heal the sick they've done great things they've done it there's no doubt for what they've done it it's a proof that they done it sure it did and they left this intellectual Church sitting on the ground no matter they say well you can't go they did it anyhow where they like the little boy in jail for shooting a gumbo somebody come in said a little boy come in to Vis he said oh they can't put you you in jail he said they can't he is already there and that's way they say that the Holy Ghost was for another age that's what they think it's here we know it we it it it's we've been flying in the air for the last 40 50 years with it seeing things that the intellectual people knows nothing about only thing they can do is sit down and say just make fun of it like a little calf on time come out of the stall they said it was just fat round he's kicking up his heels and he had a very fine a farmer fed him good and he all round and full of vitamins and there's another old lazy farmer over there that had a little calf also BN in the barn that winter when a little fell hadn't eaten nothing but weeds and when he come out he was so poor he couldn't hardly move and every time the wind had blowing shove him sideways he seen this the little fat C just kicking up his heels and having a great time you know he looked through the crack of the fence and said such fanaticism he was all full of vitamin no wonder he could kick up his heels and when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost there's something something in is full of God's spiritual vitamin makes him praise God shout and that give him because why he's no longer Earthbound he's in the heavens sailing around in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he left them Earthbound with their bicycles and Automobiles they went to the air yes they're practically taking them out of their out of date they heal the sick they spoke in unknown languages and done many things but now friends may I say this it has come to the age of astronaut we moved out of the airplane age we got more power now the astronaut age has come in what is it not a we've come in to a spiritual age of astronaut see going above it's not it's the The Same Spirit only more power only this that higher can go higher see more believe more be more like Christ God not not the automobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one it's called The Eagle age in the Bible God calls His prophets Eagle age we realize over in the Bible we find in Malachi 4 that we're promised at in the last days now he likes His prophets to Eagles he calls himself Eagle he's the great Jehovah Eagle he's able to achieve to himself a bride he's going to in the last days be able to get a bride that with a ministry that's so exactly that like a man and his wife becomes one and when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly what he said in St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also also fulfill what Jesus said would take place as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now now is the astronaut age and the astronaut sees things that the horsh rider automobile or airplanes either sees he goes higher airplanes still down here bouncing around in the clouds and having blowouts and hit downs and everything else but he goes beyond the clouds of Creeds and denominations Hallelujah moves on up into the heavens I'm away from everything the astronaut age we are living in the astronaut age just as sure as God has testified of the natural happenings there so is he testifying now that if we've achieved an astronaut God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi for only thing you has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from the airplanes and Automobiles and what more not look back to what it was but more power to lift him higher lift him into the presence of God lift him up there where all things are possible now we see it's happening there's no doubt to it so does a spiritual astronaut as the the natural astronaut goes on above the planes the planes always wrecking up and fussing in the clouds and everything like that there can be nothing greater no more achievement than the astronaut only thing he has to just keep putting more power he'll go anywhere he wants to see because he's done gone into space airplanes are still down Wrecking pussing grounded and everything like that but the astronaut don't have to be grounded he goes on above the clouds he goes on above on above the Creed on above the denomination on above those Say It Isn't So it isn't so he's got a guide the Holy Spirit the word tells him so and he moves on how does a science make an astronaut he takes what power they got this keep breaking something into it'll make it go farther go without air and so forth he keeps I don't know the the chemicals of it I'm not a mechanic but whatever it is he keeps making it go higher and higher he keeps improving at all times and now he can go beyond any reason so does God's astronaut goes beyond all Church Creed all boundaries all these things says the days of Miracles has pass there is no such a thing how did the astronaut find this he figured it out on paper it come off of paper what he figured out the same thing that any man can sit down and read the word of God and see what's promised amen search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life said Jesus and testify of me that Earthbound Bunch they had back there in them days didn't know what he was Ministry what does it the astronaut SE things that the planes is everything's out of date so does a spiritual astronaut goes beyond the clouds and Beyond Creeds and Beyond doubt out into outer space outer space of all unbelief outer space where you don't hear the chatter saying well you can't do it nobody cooperate cooperate with you can't do this you can't do that he doesn't notice it he's an astronaut he goes on Beyond those clouds it's too stormy we can't make it it don't make any difference to an astronaut he goes beyond the storm that's the way it is to a real astronaut faith today they said well the doctor said so so that might be all right but an astronaut don't believe that when it's wrot here and he's got it in his heart something tells him he just propels right on out that's all goes right on out into the space because we're living in an astronaut age yes you're out in space we're all things are possible to them that believe he has a guide which is his word that tells him how to go the word of God natural astronaut is has uh something to controlling when the astronaut is in the air he has something backward here back down here on the earth that controls him is called radar that radar moves him around sells where he's that tells what he's doing and that radar controls him from a radar Tower here on Earth that's the natural astronaut so the spiritual astronaut has a control Power has a control tower too it's not down here like man is it's up there and it's the Holy Ghost that's in him that's controlling him a to of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's under control keeps him in control by the word not in a bunch of fanaticism some hooped up nonsense but thus sayeth the Lord and it happens it's always under control he's got a control tower that's the Holy Ghost and the word is his his program and he lays right into that program and the power of the Holy Ghost endows him to move out and it brings the achievement that God wants to be achieved for his people that it might fulfill what he promised Jesus did not heal the people because he had to do it he ful it fulfilled the scripture he healed because it was written he would do it he don't have to show these signs today he don't have to have a Ministry of such and such but he promised he' do it he does it to fulfill his promise brother sister man women can't you see that can't you see the type of the spiritual and the natural these great achievements has brought the time clock of Science and it broke into such a place until they say now it's only on the clock of science they say it's three minutes till midnight they're at the end they found the thing that will destroy him they found everything an astronaut can get in the air and go over with atomic powers and set up there and say surrender or be blowned up three minutes until midnight they have worked on what God has done they've been able to pervert instead of trying to make life they're always trying to find something to kill somebody something will out do the next thing beat the next Nation beat the next place that's what they're trying to do but man looks on calling man his brother trying to lead to a home where he won't have to die one is in death the other is in life but these in death only represent life the Le when he falls off a tree and dies only mean it's coming back again because it has been the clock ticks upon on the achievement of science today to 3 Minutes to Midnight on God's Great clot it ticks Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we have arrived the works that I do shall you also Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever when the scientific clock says 3 minutes to destruction God's clock says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's on the earth in the power of the Holy Ghost to make his word live and do for his church just exactly what he promised it would do fill in his astronauts get them all fueled up and ready so they got in their great big scientific tube here not long ago astronaut to and are taking the countdown now headed for the moon they're getting off of here too they got a astronaut in a big tube powered by atomic power that they can send it Plum to the Moon they claim they got in their tube and are waiting for the countdown the spiritual astronaut God in Christ and is listening to the countdown of the word amen amen how you lose in order to shout you Baptist and Presbyterian watch's the countdown of the word oh my countdown of the word and they're headed for heaven not to the Moon they'll pass the moon so fast they won't even see it oh my waiting for the countdown yes sir waiting for the countdown is right what are they doing they're waping Christ in rapturing Grace nothing they did themselves chist took the uneducated the foolish things of the world wrapped his astronauts in it and empowered them with the Holy Ghost to take off this world's going to be left alone that's right take it off that ought to encourage us amen okay we we we see what's happening okay so if all this is happening then we know that God is achiev in something uh spiritual too because these things work uh right along with the other one it improves the other one that they work together they're a type they're a sign they're everything one's going One Direction one's going the other direction and I just thought it was uh a marvelous if if we just think and go back and read it he says the mat the natural man uh by knowledge looks backwards for his achievements so that's how he knows he's achieved because he looks backwards he looks back at what he was to where that he is so he's always looking backwards for his achievements that's science see what God has done in the former creation he says but God in the spirit ual achievement is going forward not going backwards he's going forward looking to what the word and and believing the promise for the things that has never has come yet for the spiritual Revelation to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised so man's looking back you you you see so what what I'm trying to express to you is that the reason all of this is going on is to for us to see they're going backwards they're going into science they're looking for achievements but the spiritual person the spiritual believer the the spiritual astronaut he doesn't look back he doesn't look to the carnal he doesn't look that he looks forward what is God got for me I see all this stuff here and all this plague all this uh economy this whole condition the the world's in it's it's a type it's a shadow it's a forerunner it tells me that this has come in order to push me to look forward to what God's trying to achieve what is he trying to achieve in us that's where my heart's beating what is he trying to produce what kind of Christians what kind of Faith should be coming out of this what kind of light should be shining from us what's he want out of this church why why does he let Darkness come upon it so the light can shine why the contrast so the truth can be manifested none of this is all going somewhere it it's all it's all trying to uh it is there's something working we we' we' sat down and got depressed so you were sick for a week sickness is in the flesh I I had many people call me this virus everybody thought it was so terrible someone called me up and said you know what if I've I've had the flu worse than this I've been a lot sicker than this so why is it so major why is there such a reaction why is what what is is the negative okay CU everything is an achievement what is trying to be achieved by this virus by this great uh shutdown by by this great fear by all of us wrapping our faces up and staying six feet you think all this is happening just CU a bug got loose no there's two things going on it's trying to accomplish something and it's trying to accomplish an improvement in what they feel the world needs that's it that's it they're try and but yet God's trying to accomplish something and to achieve something so there's a lot of things he's trying to achieve one of the things he's trying to achieve is the great Falling Away or you don't think it's happening look this morning you know what you've done people have substituted you know what Satan wants he wants his achievement so we look at the astronaut now we look at what do we have today what's our biggest achievement technology cell phones internet right what do you think Satan wants he wants an Internet Church electronic church if you could have been here here this morning you were healthy you had Faith you need to stop and check if you're slipping into the electronic Church sure that's what he wants he wants electronic church people are satisfied now with watching service later they they they they can fit at any time in their life that they want they they don't have to really be a part of an assembly or really sit under a Ministry they can listen to brother such and such here and brothers such and such there they can do this it it doesn't matter they're not really part of the body they can give when they want to give they don't have to give if they don't have to give anyway so now they're all immersed they're immersed in electronic Church they're immersed in a internet experience with the word where they can filter it and they can they can sit around and they can watch it they can watch it in Parts they can uh it just all it's just a whole different attitude it's a whole different approach you don't think that there's something going on getting everybody to work at home keep people from interacting breaking down setting up a form of communication where you text nobody can look at somebody anymore take them by the hands look them in the face and say friend you're headed to Hell the way you're living the wages of sin is death you can't do this leave me alone send me a text send me an email it's changing things the old fashion gospel was to assemble ourselves together to pray till the presence and power of God come down and the Holy Spirit moved up put people under conviction changed their lives fill them with the spirit of God where they're on fire for the gospel and they went out testifying that this is real and it lives it ain't a fake electronic experience it's real it's leaving the church because that's what it's trying to achieve that's what it's trying to do press the life out of it press the experience exp erience out of it build you a filter nobody likes conviction anymore they asked a great preacher why are you so successful why are there so many uh people in your uh people in your uh uh congregation could you open that for me I just ordained you a deacon thank you and they asked him they said why are you so successful why do so many people come to your thing he says well we don't preach against sin that works you know why cuz sin has a wage and the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life to know him is life so okay if so we can't miss what the messenger's telling us here we can't we can't let it slip he says all the things that are happening now there's a spiritual happening achievement that's running parallel with it one is going up and one is going down let me just say that again he says he is going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that's never has come yet so when I see this condition coming when I see the church slipping in into the electronic church when I see people not wanting to contact one another when I see people not wanting to Bear burdens when I see people hung up in their own Financial commitments nobody's going the extra mile nobody's with visiting the Widow in her Affliction nobody's feeding the hungry nobody's given their cloak to the poor the Beatitudes are tossed right out of the window in other words it's an intellectual electronic study of God's word but the living life of Christ dwelling in a person to where there are many Messiahs going about doing the father's business with signs and wonders following is is now not becoming the definition of Christianity the definition of Christian is pulling up quotes and having intellectual comparison but there's life okay so if this is going on and people are backsliding people are happy to be out of church like they there's not a need for it anymore there's no not a need for it we don't need to do it I'll catch up later it's and that's what it is it's not the Holy Ghost it's ketchup might as well put it on your hamburger while you're watching [Music] service but there's something else that God's achieving something that hasn't come yet yet some of a power a horow that takes us higher something that's going to empower us that that that's going to take us to move to the next level something that God wants to give his church that that he wants to empower his church with that's going to take him out take them off take off there's an achievement that God's trying to achieve in the midst of all what's going on God is trying to give his church more spiritual horse power so she can lift off that's what we got to be looking for where's that at what's God doing what's going on you can't let this thing just wrap you up like a mummy where you just become what do you want me to do wear a mask wear a mask you want me to stay home stay home what do you want me to do now wait till the next bulletin comes out don't have Thanksgiving no Thanksgiving turkey sales will be down we're being roboted because there's an achievement that he's trying to achieve a One World Government yes uh uh whether it's not done with maybe in the form of a government but what it comes in a way of a thinking a way of a philosophy the way that you Viewpoint amen and then people are just and we we're just throwing out Christian principles for throwing out things so you know I I I recognize I sit back and I I say okay this plague comes all right we got to do thing we got to shut down Church shut down everybody shuts down we shut down Church all right great then it goes on this now you can go 10 people and then now you can go 50 now you can go 75 now you can go a 100 conditioning us conditioning us getting us ready getting us the thing getting us taking control taking control just moving us up then they let us go for a while woo there's another wave you know what get sick get over it it's not going to kill you have you passed from Death un life it ain't going to kill you you'll overcome it you'll get better we know who it hurts we know what age group it affects we know what condition they have to be in we can protect those but what we can't let happen is let the dark spiritual motives and conditions that follow it take hold of us because there's something that it's trying to achieve but this is what he says for this he says had is never come yet what are they they're looking into the word and believing the promises for things that have never come yet for the spiritual Revelation what are they looking looking for they're looking for something that hasn't come yet for the spiritual Revelation to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised to come to pass so when we see these things we should say whoa I see what it's doing I see the effect that it's having I I see the fear that it's putting in the people I see how the the the control is taking over the people how they're losing their individuality I I can see that but it tells me that if this is happening in the natural the natural types the spiritual that these two happenings coincide together and they're companions one to another because each one is helping the other one to improve yes amen their darkness is improving yes their deception is improving our country is in political chaos our government's gone it's over they're marrying together the pope even come out and said oh well you can't have same gender marriages in the church but they're okay if you do it in the government that's what he said how many knows he said that it's exactly what he said don't you see what he just did he legitim ized government he spiritualized the practices of the government because who is he he's the v he's the devil that's right sitting on the thrones with the Triple Crown out there joining the church and the state in in the in abomination it's what's going on all this stuff they're coming up with it's what's going on what does Satan's kingdom bring sickness death destruction that's all his kingdom is and so we see these things but they're for the believer for the astronaut and he and the one that's going Beyond astronaut he's sitting back and he's saying oh my I see this stuff this stuff just doesn't happen there's a spiritual event that's taking place Satan's goes backwards God goes forwards he he sees them coming to pass he says just as the scientist in his laboratory are working on different things to help men taking creation just as the Laboratories are sitting in their science working on things to helping men what are they all trying to get vaccine they're are working on things they're they're they're working on things to help men a better phone well I'm coming up with 27g so I go to Five you know what I mean if you come you can just implant a chip right in your brain and you can just think straight to your thing you be over to my house and all of a sudden you get a thought I'm busy you don't think that's where they want to take it and I'm not trying to say that's the mark of the beast no it's men working on their in to make what better their world better their Kingdom better what do they realize oh we can't go on like this if we don't get rid of fossil fuel we'll choke out oh so let's keep this world going they're not going to keep it going it is going to be destroyed it is over with You Love by by 2035 by 2050 Lord willing Lord willing I'm praying we don't get there I don't want to see 2035 they can have 2035 I want to know what it is that God doesn't have for me yet that's going to cause me to be able to blast off I don't want the what they're going to improve I don't want that but I I see where they're going I see what they want to do I see they want to keep their world and protect their world fine I want out of their world if all this is going on and all these things are happening and all these events are happening so the world can come together and we can do all these great things for mankind and everything there's something inside of me that tells me there's something that God's got for me that I have not seen yet a spiritual a a spiritual Revelation to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised that's where my heart's at I have to be the first to admit I got caught up in all this stuff all of a sudden I see the countdown and I thought wow what's the prophet telling me he's telling me it's a count count down it's counting down it it's it's it's it's it's working its way he says he says we me he says the astronot has come in what is it we've come into a into a spiritual age of astronaut see going above this age brings us above what above our fears above our doubts above our flesh there's that God's wanting to do something to this church he's wanting to make this church come alive he wants to empower this church so they can be little Messiah who they can carry out the last work the last sign the last Ministry of Christ will be in the pred doing the same things that he did under a Roman Empire he says he says an asine has come in what is it we've come into a spiritual age of asite going above it's the same Spirit only more power not a different spirit it's the same spirit you have but the age empowers that Spirit more not a different spirit it's a restoration of Faith that's what he said with the church he says the church doesn't have the faith to use what it's got be empowered look at yourselves are you all caught up in the world you you're all caught up in school you all caught up in the future you all caught up in worldly events you all caught up in these things that's fine you live in the world but you're not of the world you're not staying in the world you shouldn't be spending your whole strength preparing for a world that you've got a ticket to leave I love this what he says here he says it's the same Spirit more power only lifted higher can go higher can see more believe more be more like Christ it's a power that lifts us up to see more believe more to be more like Christ okay so this is all going going on cuz it's going backwards it's going down we're going up this is all going on on so now we can step back and say wait a minute when we see this we know that there's something going spiritually too in the same exact parallel it's going on exactly the same way what is it what is God have for me what is it that he wants me to see what's he preparing me for take off take off there's only one thing he wants to do is to prepare his bride for take off all this pandemic and all what they're doing is only is there that to help us and get us into a place that God can achieve what his purpose and plan is his plan isn't for this world his plan's for a new Heaven and a new Earth his plan isn't to leave us here and make it better his plan is I have prepared a place for you if I had not prepared a place for you I wouldn't tell you i' go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you that where I am you may be also rapturing Faith this whole thing this whole condition this whole what's going on this whole Madness is got one purpose is so the church can look and pray for the spiritual Revelation for the power that she does not have yet but man's always looking back at their achievement they're always looking back from where they've come from we don't look back we look forward we look forward to what God has for us we don't s oh wow my goodness America's never going to be the same oh we're struck at that when we had a prophet tell us he quit praying for her a long time ago I like America I'm glad to be American God made me an American I'm an Irish American I hold my Irish heritage above you know that's just how we are we're Irish Americans but I've got am not part of this world so we're we're all upset and and we're all depressed and we're we're locked in our houses and we're scared to death wait a minute why am I powerless why can't I take up a deadly thing and it not harm me what's happened to the identifications of the church are we identified now because we have a cross on our mask and another one's got a Harley sticker and and you know what's our identification are we just part of the mass are we part of the herd are we being pushed along the whole reason for it all the whole reason for it all the whole purpose that God allowed it was so this bride can shake themselves and realize that what are we all recognizing we're all recognizing the deterioration of the United States and its morals we're all recognizing that science is now becoming the God and churches are slowly being done away with don't you see that they're closing up why do you think they want churches closed down CU they don't pay taxes and they're going to need all your money to save the doomed world sorry I'm not going to fix this doomed world they're not going to fix this Doom World a way seeth right unto a man and the end of that way is death it ain't going to get better but I can live above it I can live in a different realm I don't have to be down where the airplane is that's what he said Pentecost it's crashing it's bumping it's getting blowned up by the clouds nobody can knows where they're stable that can't balance between the move of the spirit and the move of the government nobody has a Clear Vision but what's an astronaut do he gets up where he can sees above what the airplane can see I counsel thee to buy of me isav that thou mayest see that you can look at your life at this world at what's trans uh transpiring and you can have spiritual eyes and look at it and say wow I see this is heading in a Direction that's contrary to the word of God what's God got for me that's what this ought to be doing to us it ought to be saying I need to get back on fire I need to make contact I got to get in my closet I've got to get refilled with the Holy Ghost I've got to get the spiritual Revelation that will cause the man manifestation of the promise what's the promise a Rapture our promis is a way of Escape that's what our promise is that's what I ought to be looking for I see where they're headed I see their iniquity is getting filled they're legalizing full term abortions if your child's born and it's got some sort of defect they lay it on the table and let it die America America America men marrying women men women marrying women thousands of kids don't know who their parents is divorced giving into divorce America drug addicts everywhere alcoholism everywhere that's really what you're living in take your harder money for some weird program somewhere to save the the grape tick from Extinction they care more about a grape tick I don't know if there is such a one but it struck me as being possible they care more about that than they do the soul what if it profited a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul and and this isn't having the effect on us that it should it's having a negative effect on us we've almost shut down our church so we can't afford it it's almost getting people to say we don't need to build a new Sanctuary because we can just do it online is changing your thinking is changing my thinking is having a negative effect on us because that's the way the world always goes it always goes backwards it it it it it doesn't go forward it goes backwards it always moves backwards I thought it was that I thought that was just such a phenomenal statement that it it goes backwards so it's counting down to its destruction do you understand that it's counting down to its destruction man always counts backwards 10 nine 7 this is what the prophet of God said notice the natural man even counts backwards I said he did things backwards he counts backwards watch he counts 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero he goes back and starts counting 10 it's a bad number he says then he says now notice he says what does God do he starts with his number seven that's God's number watch him seven and he counts ahead starting with one he starts with his first church age that's what his symbol on the earth that was this Church age his symbol that he was on the Earth where was he on the earth in the spirit filled believer he was veiled in flesh that's why the scripture says any man that says that Jesus Christ has not come in the flesh is Antichrist that's not that Jesus was here on the cross but that Jesus came again and indwelled in a living people and the works that I do shall you do also Silver and Gold Have I None but what I received on the day of Pentecost the indwelling presence of the spirit of God that power which is given to me this I give to you you want to write that story today Peter came in with a m gone so they didn't know who he was and then he went up to the and I'm not against wearing mask you wear mask if you want because it don't do do one thing for you either way if God don't watch the city The Watchman watches in vain so I believe in washing your hands I believe in staying apart but can you imagine the story in that day Peter would just stay away from him he'd have to check with his attorney to see if he had a letter that he could Minister uh laying on of hands without a license you you just couldn't have be a Good Samaritan and now there's all this story and he gets back there and he can't really talk to the guy and he he he wants to know what religion he is what denomination he is what what religion are you where do you go to church and fellowship Peter didn't do any of that he had something in him that was bubbling like a Brook and I know we have to make adjustments because we're in the world but we're not of the world but we don't have to give up our vision of going forward we don't have to stop because they've stopped so he says this he says notice he counts Str Straight Ahead not backwards he goes forwards he starts from his first church age which began in 33 and he starts the countdown he counts his ages that the birth of the church on the day of Pentecost what did he start counting he started counting the church age the first one was Ephesus number one two samarina three pergamus four thyra five Sardis six Philadelphia seven Leia it's later than you think it's later than you think the counting is over the next thing is zero that's why I'm calling my sermon it's almost zero they're counting themselves to destruction God God has been counting us to a blastoff it's it's it's over it's time to leave it's time to get ready it's time to realize that the world's in this condition so that the church become Awake and Alive and look for the spiritual Revelation that will cause the manifestation of the promise you're not going to study your way by reading the SE Seven Seals book into rapturing Faith it's a revelation and this world condition is what it is is to cause us to recognize that there is a revelation that has not yet been received which is in the framework of the word of God to empower us yes as he said this world's going to be left alone that's right taking off the astronauts are taking off we're taking off let's get ready to take off let's see what's he's got in that scripture for us to take off where not here just enduring this it's by reason of their task Masters that they called for the promise of deliver it should be by the reason of this world condition that we call for our rapture we need to start calling even so come quickly Lord Jesus I have no idea what but the government's got up their sleeve for us I have no idea on environmental regulations I have no idea on taxes I have no idea on laws what lies ahead for the church as far as taxing us or not taxing us I don't have any idea of those things those things will do what they do but I know one thing this is a sign because the natural types the spiritual that God has a spiritual achievement that he wants to bring forth from what's going on there's something spiritual that God's trying to accomplish for his elect lady in the midst of all this that's what we need to be looking for that's what we need to be praying for something that we haven't got yet Satan always looks back we're always looking back at what brother randam preached what he did preach looking back at what the sermons were looking back at what his ministry was but within that Ministry was divine Revelation stored up for the bride that he could break forth in other words he could spiritually interpret to you personally what was written here in the season that you needed not looking back at it as history but looking to the father above to give the spiritual revelation ation that will create the manifestation it's almost zero it's their they're counting down to their destruction we're counting up to our Rapture that song we sing the fruit is in the vine you know the life is coming to maturity bringing us back to the resurrection and how are we ever going to be raptured when we don't believe the raptures Our Only Hope how do we believe in we're going to have a Rapture when we're looking to science and looking to the world to get better how how are we going to turn our eyes upon him if we still think that they have a solution we need to look for the supernatural solution I wonder if we're getting what's been preached I wonder if we're filtering everything through a historical message brother brandom left the physical body that Jesus Christ dwelt in to give his message to the bride but the message that he get was prophetic Living Word prophecy that's coming to pass every day that's what we've got to get in contact with Lord give me the revelation of the manifestation of the power that's going to bring the promise of the Rapture to pass let's let our hearts and Minds be set on that and not on a world that's counting down the destruction you understand me this morning those of you out there let's get back on fire for god let's get back into the word of God let's start doing the things we'll weather this little storm with this virus thing we'll do all these little things that they ask us to do for their sake yes but it's not for our sake the only thing that's for our sake is the truth and the baptism of the spirit bringing the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost let's don't miss really what's happening there's a spiritual takeoff in progress let's connect with it amen that's my heart's desire Lord I know you're doing something your Prophet told me I know there's an achievement that you're doing your Prophet told me Lord that's what I want the revelation of I want the revelation of what God is doing in all this you say do you have it no but I know it's there because it's promised to be there I don't want to get sidetracked and not look for it and pray for it and seek it behold I stand at the door and knock If any man open I will come in and I will eat the evening meal that he might sit with me on my father's Throne are we all is that what we all want to do let's go together let's make a church that prepares souls and hearts for the Rapture look let's have a church that can introduce people to the Lord Jesus Christ the Forgiveness of their sins baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and being sealed with the spirit of God till their day of redemption let's get back to what his purpose was and his intention was in a allowing the world to count down and him counting up God bless you this morning the musicians would come we could stand together brother Billy if you'd come help me close please now don't take anything negative this morning praise God I I'm hearing what's going on think of it think of what's going on praise the Lord the world is going this way and we've got a promise to go this way oh lord it's almost zero almost time for me to blast off almost time for me to be taken out of here [Music] you know they go through a [Music] checklist I I haven't been in a spaceship but I've been in a a uh airplane and I've watched the guys sit there and do the check off and I've watched it on the on the video of the doing the check off in their spaces shoe brother REM called it their to [Music] to you know that did you know I I don't know if you caught this maybe the young kids I'll just say this but you know I thought it was something that uh [Music] uh he says like this little boy in jail for shooting a gumbo did anybody know what that was a Gumbo's a slingshot now listen to what he said here he says it's like the little boy in jail for shooting a a gumbo or a sling shot somebody comes in and says little boy comes in to visit him and said oh they can't put you in jail for shooting a [Music] gumbo but he was already in it you talk about a denial you understand you can't say oh they can't do that they can't take over my life they can't take over my thinking they can't take over they can't make laws like this they can't can't shut the church down they can't do this they can't do that and they've already done it you're already there yes you know there might be a reason that we get in [Music] jail there might be a reason we've got to where we are I hope it's to shake us and let's get back to what's supposed to be restored in this day the Faith of Our Fathers we've quit trying to become the restored church and we're starting to try to build a denomination on the teachings of brother random instead of getting the life that brother brandom displayed and resurrected and I'll say that this way the prophet of God resurrected the power power in the life that the church had lost and put it on display that we too could come into that let's get to what that he had and I believe this hour is to shake us into getting there amen let's sing this little song as we turn the service to brother Billy I really appreciate brother Billy's help and all that he helps me it's wonderful [Music] amen oh I'm kind of home for a country to it I name been before [Music] time will oh
