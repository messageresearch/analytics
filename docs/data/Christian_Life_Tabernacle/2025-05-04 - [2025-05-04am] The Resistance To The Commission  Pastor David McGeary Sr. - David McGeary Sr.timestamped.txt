[13:04] God, every step of the way of our lives,
[13:06] Lord, to wake us this morning to a new
[13:08] day and strengthen our bodies, Lord God,
[13:12] and grace for our families, Lord God,
[13:14] our congregation
[13:16] here, the working uh that you've put
[13:19] into this congregation, the leading uh
[13:21] of your Holy Spirit, Lord God, with the

[14:26] Amen. Want to welcome everyone, all our
[14:28] visitors. You know, I was thinking this
[14:30] morning as driving here. I mean, I read
[14:33] a place where the prophet was talking
[14:35] about it's a privilege to be a Christian
[14:38] and and I would say it's a privilege to
[14:40] be gathered here this morning. I know
[14:42] often time we just, you know, put on our
[14:44] clothes and said it's time to go to
[14:46] church. But it's truly a privilege. God
[14:49] chose you this morning and elected you
[14:51] and he made it so that you can be in the
[14:54] house of God. I mean, that is all reason
[14:56] to praise him and be happy about all
[14:59] that he's done for us. Amen. You could
[15:01] turn around and welcome someone this
[15:03] morning in the house of God. Amen.
[15:22] Amen. Why don't we turn to Psalm 29 this
[15:25] morning? We're going to read it. I'll
[15:27] read the first verse and you
[15:29] congregation will read the second and
[15:32] we'll join together on the last verse.
[15:35] Uh
[15:40] 11. Amen. It says,
[15:43] "Give unto the Lord, oh ye mighty. Give
[15:47] unto the Lord glory and strength.
[15:54] [Music]
[15:57] The voice of the Lord is upon the
[15:59] waters. The God of glory thunder. The
[16:03] Lord is upon many waters.
[16:11] The voice of the Lord breakth the
[16:14] cither. Yay. The Lord breakth the seed
[16:16] of Lebanon.
[16:25] The voice of the Lord divided the flames
[16:28] of fire.
[16:35] The voice of the Lord maketh hinder the
[16:38] calves and discover the forest. And in
[16:42] his temple do everyone speak of his
[16:45] glory.
[16:52] The Lord will give strength unto his
[16:54] people. The Lord will bless his people
[16:57] with peace. Amen. Is that your promise

[45:06] Lord. Worship the Lord.
[45:11] Why don't you just praise him this
[45:13] morning and thank him? Lord, we thank
[45:16] you to be in your house this morning.
[45:18] And Father, we lift up your name and for
[45:21] all that you do for us.
[45:24] Hallelujah.
[45:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[45:35] Good morning. You love the Lord this
[45:37] morning. Amen. Are you happy to be in
[45:40] the house of the Lord? Hallelujah. We
[45:43] love the Lord. Let's approach him in
[45:45] prayer. Our gracious father this
[45:49] morning. Father, you know exactly what
[45:52] we have need of.
[45:55] Father, before we
[45:58] ask, Lord, you look upon us
[46:03] and you know what's best for our
[46:07] future. You know what's best for our
[46:09] eternal
[46:11] destination. And you said that the
[46:13] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[46:16] by the
[46:18] Lord. Father, you direct our path and
[46:21] you guide
[46:22] us, Father. And we're just like sheep.
[46:28] We tend to wander
[46:31] and forget where we're going and forget
[46:34] where we've been.
[46:36] But you're such a great kind and gentle
[46:40] savior that you gather us up and you
[46:43] bring us into your fold
[46:46] and you put us in your
[46:50] great pen, Father, and you keep us safe.
[46:55] Father, once again, we ask you to
[46:57] shepherd us this morning and
[47:01] to Father, give us grace and mercy to
[47:04] trust you
[47:06] and to to know that our eternal outcome
[47:09] is in your hands.
[47:12] We ask you to bless us this morning as
[47:15] we fellowship around your word. In Jesus
[47:19] precious and holy and wonderful name we
[47:24] pray. Amen. And amen. God bless. You may
[47:28] be seated for a moment. Uh we want to
[47:31] listen to a little uh portion of message
[47:34] this morning and uh we trust that it'll
[47:37] be a blessing uh to you. uh tonight's
[47:40] communion service. And so this uh we we
[47:45] will try to keep our communion service
[47:48] this evening a little bit shorter and uh
[47:52] do that. So um uh we um um really want
[48:00] to uh let you know that. So if this
[48:04] morning's a tad bit longer, tonight
[48:06] it'll be a tad bit shorter and it'll all
[48:09] all out. Amen. We we've been kind of
[48:12] this
[48:14] whole year. Uh if we had a a theme, it's
[48:19] being going forward. Uh we just don't
[48:23] want to be stuck in one spot
[48:26] spiritually. We just don't want to live
[48:29] such a a a life or such an existence
[48:34] that the world just becomes heavy on us
[48:37] and it's just a struggle and all that
[48:40] we're thinking of is the struggle and
[48:43] that it's one-sided that everything's
[48:46] against us and nothing is for us. And
[48:50] that's not true. And so last week we
[48:53] talked a little bit on the subject that
[48:56] the the supernatural is not just meant
[49:03] to be in the house of the Lord. So this
[49:07] isn't this isn't the place
[49:10] uh for the
[49:13] supernatural to remain. Now we want the
[49:16] supernatural here. Amen. We believe in
[49:20] the supernatural because uh if you don't
[49:24] have it here, you're not going to see it
[49:26] work out there. Uh but the prophet made
[49:31] a a a mention to us in saying he said
[49:35] that the church has had so much
[49:38] supernatural within their midst that
[49:42] they've
[49:43] actually got overfed. I thought that was
[49:46] a tremendous uh statement that it's
[49:50] become common to us. But he said if the
[49:53] same miracle was done out amongst
[49:57] unbelievers, it would have a tremendous
[50:00] effect. And and that's uh what our
[50:05] approach is. Our approach is now uh I if
[50:11] uh we are not trying to uh in any way
[50:15] restrict the the movement of the Holy
[50:18] Spirit. If you want to shout, you shout.
[50:20] Live as high as you shout. You know what
[50:23] I mean? If you know uh you you want it
[50:26] to come from your heart, you know, you
[50:28] don't want it to come from music. You
[50:30] don't want it to come from influence
[50:32] around you. But if you listen to brother
[50:35] Brandon many times on the tapes, he
[50:37] says, "I was up there in the wilderness
[50:40] and I shouted to the tops of my lungs,
[50:42] you know what I mean?" And or I just
[50:45] wept like a baby. Uh so, uh you know, uh
[50:49] if something doesn't have emotion, it's
[50:52] dead. You know what I mean? So you want
[50:54] to have feeling in it and and and don't
[50:57] let don't let you know the people around
[51:01] you influence your feeling. If you feel
[51:05] like your heart's just overflowing and
[51:08] and you want to lift your hands and
[51:10] praise God, you just feel free and and
[51:14] go right ahead. And I made a statement
[51:17] and I hope it wasn't misunderstood when
[51:19] I said the supernatural is uh not under
[51:23] attack. Well, what what I meant by that
[51:27] or want the understanding to be is you
[51:29] can attack God. You you understand in
[51:33] the beginning was the word. I mean God
[51:35] was God. He was the beginning. He didn't
[51:37] create something to attack him. So the
[51:42] supernatural will never change. It God's
[51:46] always the same. He's got the same
[51:48] power. He's got the same will. He
[51:51] there's he unbelief doesn't stop him.
[51:55] But so the attack really isn't on God.
[51:58] The attacks on you. That's who Satan
[52:02] attacks. The battles in your mind. God
[52:05] speaks his word. It's a promise to you.
[52:08] If you accept that promise, you become a
[52:11] partaker of divine nature. Satan will do
[52:15] everything in his power to keep you from
[52:18] accepting one word of God. In fact, his
[52:21] whole purpose is to discredit the word
[52:25] of God. And we'll get into that in just
[52:28] a a little bit. But so what we we were
[52:31] speaking about is that that and uh that
[52:38] sometimes things were are misplaced. And
[52:41] so the supernatural isn't only to be
[52:44] placed within the framework of the
[52:47] church. And when it's only there, then
[52:50] it's misplaced. So if everybody comes
[52:53] thinking, well, we're going to pray for
[52:54] the sick. I'm going to go to church and
[52:57] pray for the sick. You're sick. Call a
[52:59] brother and sister in the church. Couple
[53:02] brothers go over together and go pray
[53:05] for somebody. I mean, you're all little
[53:09] Messiah. You understand? You all have
[53:12] the commission to go into the world and
[53:15] preach the gospel. We the our whole
[53:18] desire is to get away from
[53:21] nickeladianism where the ministry runs
[53:24] all the gifts. The ministry runs all the
[53:27] preaching. The ministry runs everything.
[53:29] No, this is a body fitted and joined
[53:32] together. Every part supply every member
[53:36] having in fact nobody can take your
[53:39] place.
[53:40] So, you know, th this is just where we
[53:43] come to to uh come into remembrance to
[53:47] find one another's needs. Uh you know,
[53:50] my job is not to entertain.
[53:53] Really, my job is to is to uh to bring
[53:57] you into remembrance and to stir up your
[54:01] pure minds and by way of remembrance and
[54:04] to encourage you and and to to teach you
[54:09] to bring forth things in the scripture
[54:11] uh to help you go about your duty as a
[54:15] Christian in the life you live. So our
[54:19] life is way beyond the three times we
[54:22] meet a week.
[54:25] It's way beyond that. And and we've got
[54:27] to come to that great realization. And
[54:30] so in continuing with uh what I said
[54:35] last week or what I felt the Lord put on
[54:38] our heart to
[54:40] bring, I want to play for you about 35
[54:43] minutes of a message called Let Your
[54:46] Light.
[54:48] So shine amongst
[54:50] men and uh and it kind of uh goes along
[54:56] with what that I was saying. And I
[54:58] always love to find something that we
[55:01] bring and then go find the place where
[55:03] brother Brennan brings it better because
[55:06] he'll always bring it better. And uh and
[55:09] then you can hear it and position
[55:11] yourself in that. And then now remember
[55:15] that you've been endued with power from
[55:18] on high. You have the spirit of God in
[55:22] you. Amen. You have the love of
[55:25] God in
[55:27] you. Okay? It's in you. Everything that
[55:31] you have need of is already in you.
[55:35] Amen. Jesus said if you had the faith,
[55:39] you could say to this mountain, "Be
[55:42] moved. or this tree be plucked up and
[55:45] put into the seed. He said, "If you had
[55:48] the faith of a mustard seed, these are
[55:51] the things that you could do." So,
[55:53] there's a great
[55:56] resistance to you having faith and and
[56:00] and we want to kind of go into that a
[56:04] little bit after we play this message.
[56:07] But there's a great
[56:09] resistance against you. And in fact, in
[56:12] in the political world and the and in
[56:16] all kinds of politics and and all kinds
[56:19] of environments and everything, you
[56:22] always hear about the resistance. The
[56:24] resistance uh you know during the world
[56:28] war there was the French resistance, you
[56:31] know, and and the uh the underground
[56:36] resistance that's fighting fighting and
[56:38] there Satan is fighting you.
[56:41] He's battling you. He wants to keep you
[56:44] down. He wants to keep you subject. He
[56:46] doesn't want you to rise up in
[56:48] rebellion. He wants you to be status
[56:50] quo. But we are not status quo and we
[56:54] are in rebellion against the devil.
[56:58] Amen. And we'll never forget that. So a
[57:02] as we listen to to this uh the prophet
[57:06] of God, it just it's a it's a lovely
[57:08] tape. It is so full of real
[57:12] genuine Christian practical living. It
[57:17] if I could say it like this, it's an
[57:20] assignment. It it's the commission
[57:23] expressed to us again. So uh if if when
[57:27] the prophet of God uh opens the
[57:30] uh service and he's going to read his
[57:33] Bible. So, if you could put that first
[57:36] uh verse up on the pa page there uh and
[57:39] you'll see that he wants to to turn to
[57:42] Matthew the 15th chapter or the fifth
[57:45] chapter. So, if if you would stand and
[57:48] turn to that and we'll start our service
[57:51] with the prophet of God reading the
[57:53] sermon. We'll listen to 33 minutes and
[57:56] then we'll come back and we'll talk
[57:59] about the the
[58:01] resistance to the
[58:04] commission. the
[58:08] resistance to the commission and we're
[58:12] going to talk
[58:14] about how that Yeah, we'll just talk
[58:18] about it when we talk about it, I guess,
[58:20] because if I start talking about it, I'd
[58:23] go on talking about it. So, let's just
[58:25] listen to this. You'll enjoy it. It's
[58:27] good. It's real. He's talking to you
[58:31] this morning as an individual. God bless
[58:34] you. And and I I honestly believe and
[58:37] you know I believe that that we have a
[58:40] guide in this generation and and
[58:44] and our Lord knew we'd be here. The
[58:47] word's eternal. So even though our
[58:50] messengers left the scene, the message
[58:53] was the eternal word of God. It wasn't
[58:55] something new he brought in his age. It
[58:58] was what was
[58:59] hid from the eyes of man now revealed to
[59:04] us in this day that we could become in
[59:06] the full statue of a perfect man. So let
[59:10] us listen to these few minutes. I think
[59:12] it's easy to interpret but I think
[59:15] you'll enjoy this. I think it's the Lord
[59:17] would love us to hear this. God bless
[59:19] you this morning.
[59:22] Let us open up the word of the Lord unto
[59:26] Matthews the
[59:27] 15th chapter and we will read just a
[59:31] portion and then I will draw from this
[59:34] the Lord willing a little text for about
[59:37] 15 20 minutes and then we'll have the
[59:40] communion and footwashing and baptismal
[59:43] service. It'll take us to about 9:30
[59:46] then or a little later to get finished.
[59:49] I would like to begin from the fifth
[59:51] chapter at the 12th
[59:53] verse. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[59:58] for great is your reward in heaven. For
[1:00:01] so persecuted the prophets which were
[1:00:03] before you. Ye are the salt of the
[1:00:06] earth. But if the salt has lost his
[1:00:09] savior, wherewith shall it be salted? It
[1:00:13] is henceforth good for nothing but to be
[1:00:15] cast out and be trotten under the foot
[1:00:17] of man. Ye are the light of the world. A
[1:00:21] city that sets on a hill cannot be hid.
[1:00:25] Neither do man light a candle and put it
[1:00:27] under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
[1:00:31] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[1:00:35] the house. Let your light so shine
[1:00:39] before man that they may see your good
[1:00:42] works and glorify your father which is
[1:00:45] in
[1:00:46] heaven. I would like
[1:00:49] to take a a subject from that last uh
[1:00:54] verse there which is the 16th verse. Let
[1:00:57] your light so shine before man. Let your
[1:01:01] light so shine before
[1:01:03] man that they may see your good works
[1:01:07] and glorify your father which is in
[1:01:09] heaven.
[1:01:13] We find in the
[1:01:15] scripture that
[1:01:18] uh there's two places that two different
[1:01:22] men speaking of
[1:01:26] justification and um one of them was
[1:01:29] Paul and the other was Peter St. Paul
[1:01:34] and St.
[1:01:35] Peter. And Paul
[1:01:38] was justifying Abraham by
[1:01:42] faith. And Peter was justifying him by
[1:01:47] works. Peter said that he was justified
[1:01:50] by his works. Paul said he was justified
[1:01:53] by his faith. Now, they did not
[1:01:56] contradict each
[1:01:58] other. They were looking at it in two
[1:02:00] different viewpoints.
[1:02:03] And Paul was speaking of Abraham's
[1:02:06] faith. That's what God saw in
[1:02:10] Abraham. And Peter was speaking of his
[1:02:13] works. That spoke of his faith. So it is
[1:02:17] written, "Show me your works without
[1:02:20] your faith, and I'll show you my works
[1:02:22] by my faith."
[1:02:23] Now,
[1:02:25] therefore, Paul seen what was talking
[1:02:28] and what God saw. And Peter was talking
[1:02:31] about what man saw in because if a man
[1:02:35] has faith, he will act like it. His life
[1:02:38] will show it to others. Amen.
[1:02:41] So, I'm going want to speak on that
[1:02:44] tonight. Letting our light shine. Now,
[1:02:48] just for these G minutes, I just don't
[1:02:51] want to get up here to just to be seen
[1:02:53] or to be heard. That wouldn't be right.
[1:02:56] But maybe, God helping me, maybe we can
[1:03:00] speak some words to something that'll be
[1:03:02] edifying to us, that'll help us all. Uh
[1:03:06] how that we could uh do better and live
[1:03:09] a better life. I'm sure that's what we
[1:03:12] are all here for is to take correction
[1:03:16] and to get an understanding of what we
[1:03:20] can do to make us better
[1:03:22] Christians. If I have one thing in my
[1:03:25] life that I desire is to be a better
[1:03:28] Christian than I am. And I'm sure that's
[1:03:31] the heart cry of every soul that's here
[1:03:34] tonight is to be a better Christian.
[1:03:36] Amen.
[1:03:38] Some time ago, I was going down a
[1:03:42] road and I driving along at a pretty
[1:03:46] rapid speed and watching as I usually do
[1:03:49] by myself driving and it's a lonesome
[1:03:52] drive when you're driving by yourself.
[1:03:54] You can't turn the radio on unless
[1:03:55] you're some of these family networks
[1:03:57] where you can get religious music
[1:03:59] because it's all things that would take
[1:04:02] the very spirit out of you. And wherever
[1:04:05] I go after I've gotten a little old, I I
[1:04:08] carry a little pad of paper and when the
[1:04:11] Lord reveals something to me, I just jot
[1:04:14] it
[1:04:15] down. And uh I've even wrote on my
[1:04:18] gunstock in the woods with a bullet and
[1:04:22] uh things like that just to get a
[1:04:24] thought that is presented to me. Take a
[1:04:27] piece of tag out of my clothes or
[1:04:29] something and write on it. something
[1:04:31] another to keep the message in my
[1:04:34] mind. And as I drove along down this
[1:04:37] road, I noticed a great big beautiful
[1:04:41] sign
[1:04:42] board. And usually, you know, they have
[1:04:45] a lot of things plastered on these sign
[1:04:47] boards, but I've never noticed such
[1:04:51] things on this certain sign board.
[1:04:55] Usually they'll have pictures of of
[1:04:58] half-dressed women or something of their
[1:05:00] advertisement, a certain brand of
[1:05:01] cigarettes or or whiskey or beer or
[1:05:04] something, a great shining sign
[1:05:07] boards. But to my surprise, at my first
[1:05:11] glance, it attracted my attention
[1:05:14] because it wasn't all smut up with
[1:05:18] something. The smut wasn't on.
[1:05:22] And I gazed back to see it was a
[1:05:25] beautiful board and sitting in a correct
[1:05:28] place just where when you turn this
[1:05:30] corner you can't keep from seeing the
[1:05:33] sign. And to my surprise, it had one
[1:05:37] word rolled across it.
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:41] Hungry. Just hungry. That's all there
[1:05:43] was.
[1:05:45] Then I noticed a little bitty letters
[1:05:48] down at the bottom of the board said
[1:05:52] three miles
[1:05:54] ahead.
[1:05:56] Hungering three miles
[1:06:00] ahead. Well, I begin to study about
[1:06:05] that. The people wasn't so much usually
[1:06:08] if they got a restaurant ahead. They
[1:06:11] they're trying to outsell the other
[1:06:13] fella. the picture of big sizzling
[1:06:16] steaks and so forth. And when you go in,
[1:06:18] you usually don't find anything like
[1:06:21] advertise, but it's just an
[1:06:24] advertisement. But this seemed to have a
[1:06:28] different
[1:06:30] approach. And we know that today that
[1:06:33] we're living today, it pays to
[1:06:36] advertise.
[1:06:39] And uh we find out that these people who
[1:06:42] are making such big progress in business
[1:06:44] are are great men of
[1:06:48] advertisement. They they put it on
[1:06:51] television. They smear it on boards
[1:06:54] everywhere they can to advertise their
[1:06:56] products. Smoke this one, not a coffin,
[1:06:59] a car load, and the thinking man's
[1:07:02] stilter and some other man's tip or
[1:07:04] something like that. uh but and uh stay
[1:07:08] lively longer with their beer and all
[1:07:11] stuff like that. It's
[1:07:12] advertising and they write off a lot of
[1:07:15] their income tax just for advertisement
[1:07:17] and it certainly pays off. So if it pays
[1:07:20] off for that, I begin to think then why
[1:07:24] won't Christianity pay off if it's
[1:07:27] advertised? Amen.
[1:07:30] Well, I thought then what what is
[1:07:33] advertisement? You've got to have
[1:07:36] something that is a little different
[1:07:39] from what the rest of them's
[1:07:42] got. Or if it's just so common like the
[1:07:45] things of the world, it'll never attract
[1:07:48] the attention of the
[1:07:50] people. Now, if a man would been looking
[1:07:53] for an
[1:07:54] automobile, he would have went on past
[1:07:56] that
[1:07:58] sign. But if he'd been
[1:08:01] hungry, he'd been looking for that sign.
[1:08:05] So I believe that the Christian is God's
[1:08:09] billboard. Amen. I believe that each one
[1:08:13] of us is God's billboard.
[1:08:17] And we don't have to do so much uh
[1:08:20] carrying on about it as we do just
[1:08:23] simply live such a life that'll make the
[1:08:25] people hungry to be like it.
[1:08:28] Hallelujah.
[1:08:29] Now, I noticed on this billboard, this
[1:08:33] certain one, it didn't claim any nothing
[1:08:37] but just ask the question if you're
[1:08:40] hungry. And you cannot sell anybody
[1:08:43] anything to eat unless they are
[1:08:47] hungry. The first thing that
[1:08:49] advertisement does, the individual
[1:08:51] passing by has to see
[1:08:53] it. Now, the only way that the world
[1:08:58] will ever see Christ is when he they see
[1:09:01] it in you and me. Amen. That's the only
[1:09:05] way they'll ever see Christ. Their their
[1:09:08] conscience are numb to the sunsets, to
[1:09:11] the call of the birds, to the leaves and
[1:09:13] and the grass and the flowers and the
[1:09:16] music and the message and so forth that
[1:09:19] we enjoy after we have found Christ.
[1:09:23] But until we get to a place that we
[1:09:27] display
[1:09:31] Christ, now remember that each one of
[1:09:34] you from tonight on remember you are
[1:09:36] God's
[1:09:38] billboards and uh you're you're God's
[1:09:41] advertising
[1:09:42] agent. Now the world will look at you to
[1:09:46] see what Christ
[1:09:47] is. So, we don't want to smear a big lot
[1:09:50] of stuff on there that's uh testify
[1:09:52] about things that we really are not.
[1:09:55] Let's first be that. Amen. Then when we
[1:09:58] be that, then the world will see
[1:10:02] Christ in you and
[1:10:05] me. The first thing that any
[1:10:07] advertisement the person has to see
[1:10:10] it then the next thing they have to want
[1:10:13] it.
[1:10:15] Now, if they see it and don't want it,
[1:10:19] then that's different. But you haven't
[1:10:21] put a vain advertisement out. But if
[1:10:24] they first have got to see it, and then
[1:10:26] we've got to make it so attractive to
[1:10:28] them. Amen.
[1:10:31] Well, I hope we see that. Hallelujah.
[1:10:34] The attractiveness of salvation.
[1:10:37] Amen. What it does to the
[1:10:40] person, we've got to attract the world.
[1:10:44] Amen. to
[1:10:46] Christ. And the gospel does have an
[1:10:49] attractiveness. It has it to those who
[1:10:51] are hungering for God. It only attracts
[1:10:55] those who are hungering and thirsting.
[1:10:57] And that's the ones where I draw. No man
[1:10:59] can come to me except my father draws
[1:11:01] him. But there's so many that the father
[1:11:03] has drawn and are hungering and
[1:11:05] thirsting to find God and don't know
[1:11:08] where to find him. Because those who are
[1:11:11] supposed to be billboards is so smuted
[1:11:14] up with the things of the world till
[1:11:15] they can't see where they got any more
[1:11:18] than they got before they come to help
[1:11:20] us.
[1:11:21] They live like the world. They talk like
[1:11:23] the world. They sing the same songs the
[1:11:26] world does. They dress like the world. I
[1:11:29] mean especially in the female sect. And
[1:11:33] uh they act like the world. They go to
[1:11:35] the worldly places. They tend the
[1:11:37] worldly entertainments.
[1:11:39] Someone said to me the other day about a
[1:11:41] certain
[1:11:42] minister and I love the man. There's no
[1:11:46] doubt what he's a great man. He said,
[1:11:49] "But he said that that you were holy
[1:11:53] lovers to me that I was a holy rober."
[1:11:56] Now I said, 'Well, I I I don't think I
[1:12:00] am, but I said, uh, I I want to be holy,
[1:12:04] and if the Lord ever told me to roll, I
[1:12:06] guess I would roll, but I I want to be
[1:12:09] holy anyhow, live a life of holiness
[1:12:13] means cleanness, before God. And so he
[1:12:18] said, "Well, that you run out overseas
[1:12:21] in a round like that and made yourself a
[1:12:23] missionary, no church sent you, and you
[1:12:25] just made yourself a handmade
[1:12:28] missionary." Well, I said, "If I made a
[1:12:31] handmade missionary, it would never
[1:12:33] attract the attention of the world
[1:12:36] because that they're not looking for
[1:12:38] that." Amen. They're looking for
[1:12:42] Christ. And we find out that those men
[1:12:46] And people that think those things,
[1:12:50] there is two different classes. God has
[1:12:53] two different classes. There are a man
[1:12:55] who God uses to stay home and marry the
[1:12:59] sick and bury the dead and kiss the
[1:13:02] babies and marry the young and so forth
[1:13:05] like that. Many of those men don't know
[1:13:07] what it is to pack a sword and get out
[1:13:09] there on a two-handed sword on the front
[1:13:11] line. They don't know what a battle is
[1:13:14] to fight against the enemy.
[1:13:16] They get out here and they're smart men,
[1:13:19] theologians, great men who can stand
[1:13:22] with um put a sermon out that's just so
[1:13:24] touched up and also can talk with such
[1:13:28] language till the Webster would hardly
[1:13:30] know what they were saying. They got
[1:13:32] degrees in
[1:13:34] college. But that's all right when
[1:13:38] you're talking to an intellectual group
[1:13:40] that's just looking for a church home.
[1:13:42] But when you get out there on the
[1:13:43] battlefront where those men have more
[1:13:47] than that, they've got to see the power
[1:13:50] of almighty God in manifestation or
[1:13:53] you'll never sell it to them. They've
[1:13:55] got to see Christ in his resurrection.
[1:13:58] Hallelujah. Those men don't know what it
[1:14:01] is to hold a two-handed sword to fight
[1:14:03] toeto- toe with the enemy there or
[1:14:05] devils and witch doctors and everything
[1:14:07] else stand there challenge you on every
[1:14:09] hand. Lord or men who read that Bible
[1:14:12] say if Jesus Christ is the same
[1:14:14] yesterday and very let me see the Holy
[1:14:16] Spirit performed like it did. See then
[1:14:19] you take take a a scholarship and do
[1:14:22] that. It takes the power and
[1:14:25] resurrection of Jesus Christ to produce
[1:14:28] that. Yes. And now that's what hungry
[1:14:31] natives look for. They've got to see it
[1:14:34] and they've got to want it. That's the
[1:14:36] same thing this nation has got. That's
[1:14:39] the reason tonight that we got all these
[1:14:40] warnings of atomic war is because the
[1:14:43] nations have seen it this nation has and
[1:14:46] don't want it. Amen. And that's the
[1:14:50] reason that divine judgment is upon them
[1:14:53] is because that we are in waiting the
[1:14:56] bounds. I see where our president Mr. uh
[1:15:00] Kennedy at the time, I believe his name
[1:15:02] is uh Kennedy that sent down for this uh
[1:15:06] so many officers down for this
[1:15:09] segregational war. He sent down 400 and
[1:15:12] something down in the south to stop this
[1:15:16] segregational war. And when he ended up
[1:15:19] at his full course, if you stand no
[1:15:20] more, he had exactly
[1:15:23] 666 is in Times magazine. Oh, if the
[1:15:27] people is only spiritual could wake up
[1:15:29] and see what is 666
[1:15:33] exactly what they had that's in this
[1:15:36] month's time.
[1:15:38] Now we find out that until people begin
[1:15:42] to want God, until people begin to
[1:15:45] thirst, Jesus said, "Blessed are they
[1:15:48] that do hunger and thirst for
[1:15:50] righteousness, for they shall be
[1:15:53] filled." Now you've got to hunger and
[1:15:56] thirst for we are Christ billboards and
[1:15:59] Christ is our sponsor for this
[1:16:03] sponsorship is by Christ and he is
[1:16:06] giving us our life to sponsor him. Now
[1:16:10] what kind of a person would you be if
[1:16:13] you sponsored somebody? What kind of a
[1:16:16] person ought we to be if we are are
[1:16:19] sponsored by Christ? He gives us
[1:16:23] salvation. He gives us our healing. He
[1:16:26] gives us our health and strength. He
[1:16:29] gives us our food. He gives us our
[1:16:31] homes. Then we are sponsored by Christ.
[1:16:36] Amen. And Pentecostal people who filled
[1:16:39] with the Holy Ghost is sponsors of Jesus
[1:16:42] Christ. They have been sponsored by
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ and given the Holy Ghost to
[1:16:46] be an example to the people. Amen. What
[1:16:49] do I want to be today?
[1:16:51] Where should the church be today? We
[1:16:53] should be so in such a condition that
[1:16:56] would cause all the world to be want to
[1:16:58] be like us because man go down the
[1:17:02] street say there's a man I might
[1:17:03] disagree with him on his religious
[1:17:05] doctrine but I tell you one thing that
[1:17:07] is a genuine Christian
[1:17:10] or women going down the street say she
[1:17:12] may look old-fashioned. She may not be
[1:17:14] like the rest of these women you see but
[1:17:16] there's one Christian in this town if
[1:17:18] there's one. There she goes. Amen.
[1:17:21] Because we are sponsored by Jesus
[1:17:24] Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] Oh, what kind of a person would should
[1:17:28] we be if we are his billboards and we're
[1:17:32] sponsored by him. Amen. Then in Christ
[1:17:37] is the one where we get our life and we
[1:17:39] get our strength and we get all that we
[1:17:41] have comes from Christ. He is our
[1:17:44] sponsor. Oh, I'm so thankful for that.
[1:17:47] So, we must be like him. be careful what
[1:17:49] we do, what we say, what we do in our
[1:17:52] daily life because we are sponsored by
[1:17:55] Christ. How are we to walk if we're
[1:17:57] sponsored by Christ? What ought we to
[1:17:59] say if we're sponsored by Christ? If
[1:18:01] someone says evil against us, what must
[1:18:03] we say if we're sponsored by Christ? We
[1:18:06] must be like Christ. Isn't that right?
[1:18:09] Now, um now there's only one thing that
[1:18:13] another thing we must do. Not only
[1:18:15] thing, but another thing that we
[1:18:16] ministers must do. We must preach a
[1:18:19] gospel that's appealing to the hungry.
[1:18:22] Amen. Now, if we preach a social gospel
[1:18:26] and say that, well, you ought to come
[1:18:28] join our denomination. We got 4,000 more
[1:18:31] last year in our organization. That's
[1:18:33] not it. Well, if you come to my church
[1:18:35] or become a member of my church, we'll
[1:18:37] see that you're taken care of in the
[1:18:39] when you get old and you be a faithful
[1:18:41] member. It's like an insurance policy.
[1:18:43] You'll be taken care of when you get
[1:18:44] old. We'll see to that. That still isn't
[1:18:47] the attractiveness. The thing that we
[1:18:49] want to do is to preach a gospel that
[1:18:52] appeals to a hungry
[1:18:54] world. Now, how can you appeal to a
[1:18:58] hungry world that's wanting to see where
[1:19:00] they come from, who they are, and where
[1:19:03] they're going? Unless you preach a
[1:19:04] gospel that raises Christ up in a living
[1:19:07] atmosphere right here around us now. We
[1:19:10] cannot do it. There's no way we we could
[1:19:13] join we could join the Masons, the the
[1:19:15] odd fellas, any other lodge. Join some
[1:19:18] lodge and be just as well. But we're to
[1:19:20] preach a gospel that's appealing to
[1:19:22] hungry people. Amen. That'll catch those
[1:19:26] who are hungered and thirsting for
[1:19:27] righteousness. Blessed are they that are
[1:19:30] hunger and thirst for righteousness, for
[1:19:32] they shall be filled. Now, how would it
[1:19:35] be? The righteous shall be filled.
[1:19:38] Filled with what? Amen. the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:41] The Bible said Stevens was a man full of
[1:19:45] power, full of power, full of faith,
[1:19:48] full of love, full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:51] That's what made him what he was is
[1:19:52] because he was filled with the Holy
[1:19:55] Ghost. He was a real advertising board
[1:19:58] for Christ. Hallelujah. He stood there
[1:20:00] that morning at the Sanhedrin courts.
[1:20:03] And they accused him. They said, "This
[1:20:05] man knew what all he was doing."
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. And he stood alone, just him
[1:20:08] alone, out before the great Sanhedrin
[1:20:10] court, maybe two or three thousand Jews
[1:20:13] or 5,000 standing there with a pointed
[1:20:15] finger. The Bible said when he walked
[1:20:17] out there that his face looked like an
[1:20:19] angel. Amen. That doesn't mean he had a
[1:20:22] light shining from his face. An angel
[1:20:24] would be a messenger that know what he
[1:20:26] was talking about. Stevens walked out
[1:20:28] there not afraid of death. Amen. He
[1:20:30] wasn't afraid of nothing because he
[1:20:33] knows what he was talking about.
[1:20:35] Hallelujah. Paul said, "I know who I
[1:20:37] have believed, not persuaded he's able
[1:20:39] to keep that which I committed to him."
[1:20:41] But Stevens walked out there before that
[1:20:43] Sanctuary court like a sheep among a
[1:20:45] pack of wolves was hounding for his
[1:20:48] blood and they accused him and pointed
[1:20:50] an accusing finger at him. What did he
[1:20:52] do? He said, "Many brethren, God of
[1:20:55] glory appeared to our father Abraham
[1:20:57] when he was yet in Macedonia before he
[1:20:58] was called out. went ahead and brought
[1:21:00] down all the history of Abraham and how
[1:21:03] that through him he would bring in the
[1:21:04] Gentiles. And when he got down to a
[1:21:07] certain place, look at him full of the
[1:21:08] Holy Ghost. They waiting just couldn't
[1:21:11] wait till they could get their hands on
[1:21:12] him. He said, "You stiff neck
[1:21:14] uncircumcised in the heart and ears. You
[1:21:16] always resist the Holy Ghost like your
[1:21:18] father did. So do you." Hallelujah. He
[1:21:21] was God's advertising board. And when
[1:21:24] they stoned him to death, throw him
[1:21:26] outside the city and beat him to death
[1:21:28] with stones. When he was dying, he
[1:21:30] raised his head to heaven and asked
[1:21:32] forgiveness for those who were stoned.
[1:21:34] Amen. The same as Jesus did at the
[1:21:36] cross. Then God seen his little
[1:21:38] advertisement board being taken down.
[1:21:41] Stevens looked up to heaven and said,
[1:21:42] "Behold, I see heavens open and Jesus
[1:21:44] standing at the right hand of God." And
[1:21:46] he fell asleep in the arms of God. He
[1:21:49] was a advertisement board for a hungry
[1:21:53] world. You say, "Well, how many was
[1:21:55] there?" You said there maybe 5,000. How
[1:21:57] many of them got saved? There was one.
[1:21:59] He had an incessed it right then, but
[1:22:01] years later
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:05] your influence never
[1:22:07] there was one help. The pope saw that
[1:22:10] young uh Pharisees stand there consulted
[1:22:13] and give witness to his death. But when
[1:22:15] he saw that advertisement with the power
[1:22:17] of the resurrection in that little
[1:22:19] fella, it never got away from him. That
[1:22:22] same man, Paul, that one standing there
[1:22:24] that morning, led tens of thousands of
[1:22:27] souls to Christ. Hallelujah. Because one
[1:22:30] man was willing to give his life to be
[1:22:32] an advertising board for Jesus Christ.
[1:22:36] What aren't we to do today? No matter.
[1:22:38] We don't have to have big audiences. We
[1:22:40] don't have to preach to 10,000. We don't
[1:22:42] have to even preach. We can be God's
[1:22:44] advertisement board. How do you know
[1:22:46] that your life might not start some
[1:22:48] young man on the gospel? Some of you
[1:22:50] older men, you older women, start some
[1:22:52] young man on the field out there will
[1:22:54] win 10,000 souls to Christ. Amen. It's
[1:22:57] because that he saw Christ in you that
[1:23:00] you presented Christ to him in the
[1:23:02] simple power of the gospel. Yes. I think
[1:23:06] we need a Christ. Yes,
[1:23:09] sir. Only way we see Christ is when he
[1:23:12] reflects in each other. I see Christ in
[1:23:15] you. You see him in me. That's how we
[1:23:17] watch Christ. I come to the meetings. I
[1:23:20] start preaching. I watch the people. You
[1:23:22] can see where they're interested or not.
[1:23:24] Just in a few minutes, you look over
[1:23:25] your audience. You can tell whether
[1:23:27] you're bored or whether you're not. See,
[1:23:29] and the first thing you know, you see
[1:23:30] him singer hanging on to every word. I'm
[1:23:33] expectations. See, I'm seeing Christ
[1:23:36] reflected in that person. Amen. Because
[1:23:39] he's hungering and thirsting for God.
[1:23:42] Then me preaching the gospel. He sees
[1:23:44] the Christ reflected in me. I see the
[1:23:47] Christ reflecting in him. That means
[1:23:49] Christ is in our midst. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:53] Hungering and thirsting. Now watch the
[1:23:55] audience how they take it. Say something
[1:23:57] to them. Watch what effect it takes on
[1:23:59] them. Watch your face light up full of
[1:24:01] joy. They're ready to receive something.
[1:24:03] That's Christ. I see Christ reflecting
[1:24:06] in that person because the gospel, the
[1:24:08] simple gospel of Christ is taking a hold
[1:24:11] in that heart because they're hunger and
[1:24:14] thirsty. And I'll show a billboard here,
[1:24:16] but advertisement. What kind of an
[1:24:18] advertisement? Not to some theology. Not
[1:24:21] to some man, but to a priest that lives
[1:24:24] up the
[1:24:26] same for he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:24:28] and forever. Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[1:24:32] They see that power of God move,
[1:24:34] watching over the buildings, and see
[1:24:35] pick out the people, discern their
[1:24:37] hearts, heal the sick, reveal the
[1:24:40] secrets of their heart, unstopp the deaf
[1:24:41] ears, and make the blind to see. Amen.
[1:24:48] Board and the people see it and they
[1:24:50] rally and they praise God. I watch it in
[1:24:53] them when they're praising God. They'll
[1:24:55] watch it out here where it goes this
[1:24:57] way. So through each other, we see
[1:24:59] Christ reflect his life. Now, no matter
[1:25:02] how much I could reflect it here, unless
[1:25:04] it reflects on YouTube, we'll never
[1:25:06] understand it. The gospel will be of
[1:25:08] none effect unless somebody was there to
[1:25:10] take it. There'll be many who won't take
[1:25:12] it. But the ones that will take it,
[1:25:14] it'll reflect in them.
[1:25:17] There's maybe 5,000 that morning at the
[1:25:19] execution of Stevens. But there was one
[1:25:22] that reflected in him even at the end of
[1:25:24] his life. He said, "I'm not even worthy
[1:25:26] to be called one of the saints." He
[1:25:28] said, "Because I persecuted the church
[1:25:29] of God even to death."
[1:25:32] Gives consent to the stoning of that
[1:25:34] martyr Stevens. Never did get away from
[1:25:36] Paul. He said, "I persecuted the church
[1:25:38] even to death." See, he never got away
[1:25:40] from because he seen Christ reflected.
[1:25:43] How did Steven demons do it? He never
[1:25:45] performed any miracles. Although he
[1:25:47] known that Christ was a miracle
[1:25:48] performer, he know all these powers and
[1:25:51] things. But what did he do? He just
[1:25:53] presented his life in such a way that
[1:25:55] they see that it was the power of
[1:25:57] Christless.
[1:26:00] You may never see a vision. You may
[1:26:02] never put your hands on a sick person
[1:26:04] and feel the charge of almighty God make
[1:26:07] a skeleton of a man turn back to life
[1:26:09] again. You may never see Stan three or
[1:26:12] four rainbows. You may never see his
[1:26:14] image. You may never hear his voice, but
[1:26:17] still you can be a sign that Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ so pure separated from the world
[1:26:25] up with dirty things around your
[1:26:28] life. the hungry heart, the hunger and
[1:26:31] thirst to be left. Hallelujah. You're
[1:26:33] the salt of the earth. But the salt has
[1:26:35] lost its savior. Wherew with shall it be
[1:26:37] softened. That's right. Hungering and
[1:26:39] thirsting. Let your light so shine
[1:26:41] before man that they may see your good
[1:26:43] works. See what you did and glorify the
[1:26:45] father what's in heaven. Hunger and sign
[1:26:48] boards reflecting wonderful. Yes sir.
[1:26:52] Now also we don't want to do this. We
[1:26:56] don't want to make a quick sale out of
[1:26:57] it. You say, "Well, I got converted last
[1:26:59] night. Hallelujah. The whole world." You
[1:27:01] can't do that. That's a quick sale. If
[1:27:03] we do that, the product's not much good.
[1:27:05] If you just live good, say, "I know one
[1:27:07] time I I live good for two weeks after I
[1:27:10] was converted. I live I lived I lived
[1:27:12] two weeks just perfect life. That's a
[1:27:15] quick save. That's like this call we
[1:27:17] just had. Nothing but a bunch of
[1:27:19] vitamins wrapped up together." And it
[1:27:21] didn't last for a little while. It
[1:27:22] finally went out. You want to be an
[1:27:24] arrogant Christian? Arro Christian. very
[1:27:28] Christian,
[1:27:30] not a quick save, but let your light so
[1:27:33] shine. If you walk up to a man and ask
[1:27:35] him to receive Christ, he'd lash in your
[1:27:37] face. Don't go and say, "Well, there's
[1:27:38] nothing to it or he would have accepted
[1:27:40] it." No, that's a had a call sale. We're
[1:27:43] not selling had a call. We're selling
[1:27:45] the gospel. Amen. The power of the
[1:27:48] living God the same yesterday, today,
[1:27:50] and forever. If the world hates you,
[1:27:53] they hated Christ before they hated you.
[1:27:55] Well, this same cost drove him to the
[1:27:57] cross, but we're his representatives.
[1:27:59] We're his billboards. We advertise him.
[1:28:02] You don't have to have a lot of fancy
[1:28:04] stuff, a lot of Dr. PhD LLD, the great
[1:28:08] sanctified church of so and so and so
[1:28:09] and so found their way back so and so
[1:28:11] and so and so. We have so and so and so
[1:28:13] and so. Just make them hungry. Amen. A
[1:28:18] simple kingdom
[1:28:21] with Christ going across your life that
[1:28:24] men will see your good work saying glory
[1:28:26] father which is in heaven. That's it.
[1:28:29] Don't be smuted up with the trash in the
[1:28:30] world. Don't try to advertise yourself
[1:28:32] like somebody said, "Well, I belong to
[1:28:34] so and so this big church. It's the
[1:28:36] biggest church in the city. We got a
[1:28:38] person near our neighborhood up there
[1:28:40] that left a little church up here on the
[1:28:41] highway to go to a bigger church because
[1:28:44] he said a better people went there. a
[1:28:47] better class of
[1:28:48] people see that don't know their their
[1:28:51] brain becomes dusty. Uh it's it's
[1:28:54] smudged up with the things of the world.
[1:28:57] A better class of people. Why a good
[1:29:00] class of people? A people that's born of
[1:29:02] the spirit of God. They're so poor they
[1:29:04] don't know where the next meal is coming
[1:29:05] from. The only type of people it's worth
[1:29:08] anything. They're the people that's born
[1:29:10] again. When Jesus come, what kind of a
[1:29:13] class of people did he have to get?
[1:29:16] uneducated fisherman man. Peter the
[1:29:19] apostle the great saint who was given
[1:29:21] the keys to the heaven could not even
[1:29:23] sign his own name stumped with fish from
[1:29:26] the old fish boats and things with old
[1:29:28] greasy apron on Jesus took that type of
[1:29:31] miracle today they're kicking out the
[1:29:34] church as
[1:29:36] hallelujah so see the people are looking
[1:29:39] for class and did you know the devil
[1:29:41] lives in class you know what caused the
[1:29:44] first battle in heaven was when Lucifer
[1:29:47] set up a greater Christ the people got a
[1:29:49] better place to angels. He thought big a
[1:29:52] bigger kingdom a more brighter shinier
[1:29:53] kingdom than Michael had and he was
[1:29:55] kicked out of heaven. See where class
[1:29:57] comes from? Stay away from class.
[1:30:00] Hallelujah. The hungry don't want class.
[1:30:04] The hungry wants food.
[1:30:06] Yes, sir. The poor won't
[1:30:13] and the hungering and thirsting for God
[1:30:16] wants the gospel and power of Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ. Amen. Amen. No matter how sick
[1:30:20] it is, how how un how unpopular it is
[1:30:24] with the world, they want
[1:30:25] reality. A man's dying, a man that knows
[1:30:29] he's got to meet God. Don't care about
[1:30:31] any class. He wants to find God. He
[1:30:33] wants to find assurance that when he
[1:30:35] comes down to the river, there will be
[1:30:37] somebody there to meet him and show him
[1:30:38] the way. He wants something at anchors
[1:30:41] now that know I know my redeemer liveth.
[1:30:44] Hallelujah. And the last days shall
[1:30:45] stay.
[1:30:47] I'm persuaded that there's nothing
[1:30:50] present that which is future shall come.
[1:30:52] Hunger, perils, or anything else can
[1:30:54] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:30:56] in Christ. Hallelujah. That's what they
[1:30:58] want. want something, not a make
[1:31:01] believe, something sell quick and get
[1:31:03] over here and join this church. I want
[1:31:05] something that say, "Well, I'll go down
[1:31:06] and join the church. I'll have a
[1:31:07] consecration service. The pastor will
[1:31:09] baptize me secretly and take me into the
[1:31:11] church." No, no, that's not it. That's
[1:31:13] why I'm quick sale. It won't last very
[1:31:16] long. I want real old test. Hallelujah.
[1:31:20] A man or a woman that's willing to walk
[1:31:21] out and say, "I'm
[1:31:23] wrong. I don't want to become like my
[1:31:25] neighbor.
[1:31:27] I want to be a woman like my neighbor. I
[1:31:29] want to be a man like my neighbor. I
[1:31:31] want to walk so godly before man that
[1:31:33] people think of me the same as they did
[1:31:35] of him. I want to be like Jesus Christ.
[1:31:46] What can I say to that?
[1:31:49] Amen. Quite a
[1:31:51] challenge, right?
[1:31:54] quite a quite quite a challenge uh
[1:31:59] uh this morning from the Lord to each of
[1:32:04] our lives. And
[1:32:09] uh you know, if I could uh say it like
[1:32:13] this just uh this morning, if you could
[1:32:18] say that
[1:32:20] uh God was
[1:32:24] trying
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:26] to sell us or attract us to being
[1:32:32] salesman for him. if you would allow me
[1:32:35] to use those
[1:32:37] terminologies, to be a
[1:32:40] billboard. And so uh and the benefits of
[1:32:47] of
[1:32:49] uh being a billboard, the the benefits
[1:32:52] of being an ambassador
[1:32:55] uh and carrying out the commission
[1:33:00] because really what we heard this
[1:33:02] morning
[1:33:03] was really the commission that was given
[1:33:07] to the church is to go into all the
[1:33:10] world and let your light so shine among
[1:33:13] men that your good works might glorify
[1:33:17] your father which is in heaven. Now I
[1:33:21] want to talk to you this morning because
[1:33:23] we believe that's what the church is.
[1:33:26] But it becomes very comfortable to come
[1:33:29] in here and be a
[1:33:31] Christian to lay our hands on the sick
[1:33:34] here to uh talk about the good things of
[1:33:38] God amongst people who like to hear
[1:33:41] about the good things of God. You know,
[1:33:44] we ask ourselves, how many times have we
[1:33:47] really talked to somebody and ask him,
[1:33:50] do you know the Lord
[1:33:52] Jesus? You know, and and not do you go
[1:33:56] to church, do you do this, do you do
[1:33:58] that, but do I mean, do you know do you
[1:34:02] know the
[1:34:03] Lord? You know, do you know the power of
[1:34:05] the resurrection? Do you know the power
[1:34:07] of God? Do you know that God can heal
[1:34:10] you of that? You know, you maybe you
[1:34:12] hear someone talk about their child.
[1:34:14] Maybe they're in trouble. Maybe they're
[1:34:15] in drugs. Maybe and can do do you stand
[1:34:18] up and say, "You know what? I know a God
[1:34:19] that can do that. Let's pray together
[1:34:23] right here. I'll pray for you. Let's do
[1:34:25] that." Now, that's in our heart's
[1:34:28] desire, but there's a resistance to
[1:34:32] it. And I want to uh talk to you because
[1:34:36] the characteristics of resistance are
[1:34:39] are in the human
[1:34:41] nature. They're they're in the human
[1:34:44] nature. The flesh wars against the
[1:34:46] spirit and the spirit against the flesh.
[1:34:49] And these two are contrary one to
[1:34:51] another. The spirit of God wants to move
[1:34:53] in you. Many times the spirit of God
[1:34:56] maybe you feel it bubbling over and you
[1:34:58] just want to praise God and yet you know
[1:35:01] there's all the resistance to it. There
[1:35:04] there's there's a resistance. You got to
[1:35:07] deal with the
[1:35:08] resistance. And
[1:35:10] and and I remember we shared with you a
[1:35:15] while back that all the all the methods
[1:35:19] and success stories to be
[1:35:23] successful, all the steps to be
[1:35:25] successful, all the things that athletes
[1:35:29] do, all the things that businessmen do,
[1:35:32] all those principles of being
[1:35:34] successful. We took all those principles
[1:35:37] and took them right in and showed right
[1:35:40] in the Bible that every single principle
[1:35:43] of being successful was written right in
[1:35:46] the scriptures and that a Christian
[1:35:49] could practice every single one of those
[1:35:53] and become a successful Christian.
[1:35:56] Well, if you want to become a successful
[1:35:59] Christian, you've got to overcome the
[1:36:01] resistance
[1:36:05] and or if I could say that, the
[1:36:08] objections. If a if a person wants to be
[1:36:11] a successful
[1:36:13] salesman, he's got to learn to handle
[1:36:16] the
[1:36:17] objections that come from human nature.
[1:36:23] In other words, we've all got a builtup
[1:36:26] resistance. We've all got a builtup
[1:36:29] excuse. You've got a built excuse in you
[1:36:32] for not testifying. You've got a built
[1:36:35] excuse for you for not making a change.
[1:36:39] And that's what God wants to do.
[1:36:41] Everything about being a Christian is
[1:36:44] about changing.
[1:36:46] It's not about getting to a place that
[1:36:48] you can sit put. It's about a
[1:36:51] constant
[1:36:53] translation and and a a tr a constant
[1:36:57] going forward and a constant moving to
[1:37:00] where you become like Jesus Christ. As
[1:37:04] he is, so are we in this
[1:37:07] world. It it's a continual growth until
[1:37:11] harvest. It's a continual setting in the
[1:37:14] sun until you ripen into a perfect
[1:37:18] rapturable
[1:37:19] uh harvest fruit just like what was
[1:37:22] planted.
[1:37:25] But you've got to understand that
[1:37:27] there's a resistance. And when a
[1:37:30] salesman walks in and he's going to sit
[1:37:33] down and try to sell his product, he's
[1:37:36] got to understand that there's a
[1:37:39] resistance already built in to the
[1:37:42] person. That man never stands up and
[1:37:45] meets him at the door and says, "Oh,
[1:37:46] you're going to sell something. How
[1:37:48] much? I want
[1:37:52] 10." Or he doesn't say, "Oh, I don't
[1:37:54] care. Just go down the hall and have
[1:37:56] them write you a check.
[1:37:59] It don't work that
[1:38:03] way. He's got to know when he walks in
[1:38:06] there that there's going to be a whole
[1:38:08] ton of
[1:38:10] resistance. that there's going to be a
[1:38:12] list of objections that are so long that
[1:38:16] and if if he's not
[1:38:20] prepared, if he don't believe in what
[1:38:22] he's
[1:38:25] got, he'll get ate
[1:38:27] up. I like to buy a car. I always sit
[1:38:30] down and look across the cell and says,
[1:38:32] "What kind of car do you drive? How come
[1:38:35] you aren't driving the car you're trying
[1:38:36] to sell me?
[1:38:40] Maybe I ought to go down the
[1:38:43] street. You know, I won't buy something
[1:38:45] from somebody that they're not using
[1:38:50] it. I got this cream. Take every wrinkle
[1:38:53] out of your face. Well, do you use it?
[1:38:55] No. Why
[1:38:59] not? So, I want you to understand that
[1:39:02] you
[1:39:03] you you're a billboard.
[1:39:08] You've got a
[1:39:10] product. You've got a
[1:39:13] sponsor that you've got to go
[1:39:16] out. You're commissioned to bring this
[1:39:20] light to the
[1:39:24] world. It's not an
[1:39:28] option. You're deceived. If you think
[1:39:32] you're going to sit in the church, look
[1:39:34] at a picture of a pillar of fire and a
[1:39:37] picture of a cloud and say, "I believe
[1:39:39] in William Brandom and you're going to
[1:39:41] make it." That's what he's saying. Show
[1:39:44] me your faith by your works. Show me
[1:39:48] your faith. Show me that you're a
[1:39:51] Christian by carrying out the commission
[1:39:54] or the jo o that God give us to do.
[1:40:03] Don't let the
[1:40:05] preacher work up an
[1:40:08] atmosphere that makes you feel
[1:40:12] comfortable that now you can do it. You
[1:40:16] need to do it in the most uncomfortable
[1:40:19] circumstances there are.
[1:40:26] testify to a
[1:40:31] doctor. So, I'm going to sit in the
[1:40:33] doctor's office and testify that Jesus
[1:40:35] Christ is a
[1:40:36] healer. But there's a way to do it. I
[1:40:40] believe the Lord Jesus is going to use
[1:40:42] you to heal me. I don't think you can
[1:40:43] heal me. I don't think your medicine can
[1:40:46] heal me. But I believe that God called
[1:40:49] you to put these things together for me.
[1:40:53] and it's
[1:40:56] him. But what I want to talk to you this
[1:40:59] morning just a little bit about is that
[1:41:01] you've got a job to do. You've got a
[1:41:04] commission. You're a
[1:41:07] billboard. But you there's something in
[1:41:11] you
[1:41:14] resisting you.
[1:41:19] And I want to talk about what some of
[1:41:24] those what the what the
[1:41:29] world's excuses
[1:41:32] are or what the world objects. How the
[1:41:37] world
[1:41:39] objects is the same way your nature and
[1:41:43] human
[1:41:44] nature
[1:41:46] objects to you carrying
[1:41:49] out the commission within
[1:41:53] yourself. In other words, you have to
[1:41:55] overcome the objections that are coming
[1:41:58] from within your mind and your body. You
[1:42:02] have to overcome those to take that step
[1:42:05] into faith to make that
[1:42:10] testimony like Abraham did. I believe
[1:42:14] God's able to perform that which he
[1:42:17] promised. He made the crib. He built the
[1:42:19] room. He he swed the beauties. He did
[1:42:23] everything he was because and he he
[1:42:26] endured until the end. He knew it was
[1:42:28] going to happen. How many objections did
[1:42:32] you think that he had to fight and
[1:42:35] overcome within
[1:42:37] himself?
[1:42:39] So you want
[1:42:42] to so you what the spirit with inside of
[1:42:48] you is trying to sell
[1:42:51] you the Christian
[1:42:54] life that you can live in the world.
[1:43:02] The the light in
[1:43:04] you and the seed in you is trying to
[1:43:08] sell your outside
[1:43:11] man this life for you to live. And the
[1:43:16] outside
[1:43:17] man is now fighting with the inside
[1:43:23] man. The flesh is now fighting with the
[1:43:26] spirit. The spirit wants to be a shining
[1:43:29] light. The spirit wants to lay hands on
[1:43:32] the sick. The spirit wants to testify.
[1:43:35] The spirit wants to shout. The spirit
[1:43:37] wants to rejoice and praise God. The
[1:43:40] spirit wants to do those things because
[1:43:43] that's that's where it lives. That's
[1:43:45] where it comes from. And it wants to go
[1:43:47] back to where it come from.
[1:43:50] And the spirit in you came from the day
[1:43:53] of Pentecost. And it wants to go back to
[1:43:56] where it come
[1:44:01] from. But
[1:44:03] oh, the
[1:44:08] objections. I hope I can draw the
[1:44:11] picture. So this is this the outward man
[1:44:15] talking to the inward man.
[1:44:18] The inward man says, "I want you to
[1:44:21] demonstrate the power of the
[1:44:23] resurrection of Jesus Christ." And
[1:44:26] here's the outward man's first
[1:44:28] objection. This is the first objection
[1:44:30] in the sales world. It's too
[1:44:38] expensive. What's the
[1:44:41] cost? How much do I have to sacrifice?
[1:44:45] What effect will it have on my job?
[1:44:57] I
[1:44:58] mean the inside man saying it's
[1:45:01] free. It was freely given. Freely give.
[1:45:07] But if you haven't been using the
[1:45:13] product, you're not so sure you want to
[1:45:16] sell
[1:45:20] it. You haven't paid the price for it.
[1:45:24] Now, how would you expect someone else
[1:45:25] to pay the price for it? But that's the
[1:45:29] first
[1:45:30] objective. That's the first thing that
[1:45:32] they they want to know. Well, it's too
[1:45:35] expensive. And and and the other the
[1:45:39] next thing says,
[1:45:41] "Well, you know,
[1:45:45] uh can I get it cheaper someplace
[1:45:51] else?" You know, I mean, is there a
[1:45:53] cheaper version of this? Uh is there an
[1:45:58] easier way?
[1:46:02] Is there a cheaper way? Is there
[1:46:04] cheaper? I I can buy it online
[1:46:08] cheaper. You won't have it now. You
[1:46:10] might get it in three days. I might get
[1:46:12] it back order. It don't matter. But what
[1:46:14] I'm saying is there's this the the
[1:46:16] spirit inside says, well, wait a minute.
[1:46:19] Is there a easier way for me to go about
[1:46:23] accomplishing letting this light
[1:46:26] shine than letting it shine?
[1:46:34] You don't even know this. This is all
[1:46:35] your
[1:46:36] subconscious. It's all the resistance.
[1:46:39] It's all the
[1:46:41] objections. These things might be
[1:46:43] traveling through you a mile a minute.
[1:46:46] But you've got to overcome the objection
[1:46:50] before you can make the
[1:46:55] sale.
[1:46:59] Another one
[1:47:01] is I don't have the budget right
[1:47:05] now. Or we might put it like this way. I
[1:47:09] don't have the
[1:47:11] strength. I just don't have the
[1:47:14] emotional strength right
[1:47:17] now. It
[1:47:19] I I I don't have the
[1:47:23] attention right now.
[1:47:26] uh I don't have the
[1:47:30] time right
[1:47:32] now. In other words, I didn't budget
[1:47:36] this in my daily
[1:47:39] activity that I was going to be called
[1:47:42] upon to let my light
[1:47:45] shine and present the power of the
[1:47:48] resurrection. It wasn't in my plan
[1:47:50] today. It wasn't in my budget today. I I
[1:47:54] what is it going to cost me if I if I
[1:47:57] say something right here at this
[1:48:00] moment? And so that that's there. You
[1:48:04] know, the other the next thing is is I
[1:48:06] need to spend my money
[1:48:12] elsewhere. You know, I need
[1:48:15] to I need to put my efforts elsewhere.
[1:48:20] there's other things I need to
[1:48:25] do. These things just are rising up
[1:48:28] within us. They're they're they're the
[1:48:32] objections of the flesh to the
[1:48:38] spirit. And that's what religion is.
[1:48:41] Religion is a covering that allows all
[1:48:45] your objections to put on a spiritual
[1:48:48] robe.
[1:48:50] without ever doing the
[1:49:04] work. I'll do it when I have more
[1:49:08] money. Let's take that with the spirit
[1:49:11] band. We're paralleling these two. I
[1:49:15] will do it when I have more time.
[1:49:20] and a better
[1:49:24] situation. You know the our messenger
[1:49:26] told us when God tells you to do
[1:49:28] something do it right quick. Don't
[1:49:31] hesitate. Do it right now. Do it under
[1:49:34] the inspiration. Do it when it strikes.
[1:49:37] But you know what? We say, "Oh, I I'll
[1:49:40] do it later. I'll do it when I have more
[1:49:43] time. I'll do it when I'm better
[1:49:45] prepared. I'll I'll do it." You know, in
[1:49:48] other
[1:49:49] words, it now is not the
[1:49:56] time. I didn't expect it
[1:50:01] to cost this much. I didn't expect such
[1:50:05] a big
[1:50:06] change. I didn't think I would have to
[1:50:09] give up so
[1:50:12] much. Maybe God wants you to make a
[1:50:15] change in your life. not just testifying
[1:50:18] but maybe quit doing something or start
[1:50:22] doing
[1:50:24] something. The spiritual man is looking
[1:50:27] for a way to express
[1:50:30] Christ and and I'm it's just not talking
[1:50:33] about testifying. It's talking about the
[1:50:36] spiritual man rising past the fleshly
[1:50:40] man and overcoming the fleshly man until
[1:50:44] your light shines.
[1:50:48] It shines through your flesh. Well, your
[1:50:51] flesh is objecting to Christ shining
[1:50:53] through you. It's got it's got its
[1:50:55] history. It's got all of its reasons why
[1:50:58] not to. You've got to overcome every
[1:51:01] single one of those objections. Just
[1:51:03] like you have to overcome every
[1:51:05] objection to take hold of a promise of
[1:51:08] God and claim it as yours and believe
[1:51:11] it.
[1:51:15] You've got to deal with the
[1:51:18] objection. You've got to deal with the
[1:51:21] resistance to the
[1:51:24] commission. We always think the
[1:51:26] resistance is from outside. The
[1:51:28] resistance is from
[1:51:35] within. I'll do it when I have time. A
[1:51:39] better
[1:51:41] situation again. I don't I didn't expect
[1:51:44] it to cost me much. I didn't expect such
[1:51:47] a big change. I didn't think I'd have to
[1:51:49] give up so
[1:51:52] much. I didn't think it would be so far
[1:51:56] away from acting the way things I'm
[1:52:02] doing. I didn't think I'd have to give
[1:52:04] up my season tickets.
[1:52:07] I didn't think I'd have to give up my
[1:52:09] big bird
[1:52:10] game or my man of war game or my video
[1:52:18] games. I just wouldn't think I'd have to
[1:52:20] give up
[1:52:21] that. I didn't expect it to cost that
[1:52:25] much. I was really hoping that it would
[1:52:29] uh that it would
[1:52:32] uh be be cheaper or there be an easier
[1:52:39] way. You know, the other one is
[1:52:43] well, you know, I'll do it in
[1:52:47] another quarter or something. In other
[1:52:50] words, I'll do it another time. I'm not
[1:52:52] going to reject it. I'll just do it
[1:52:55] another
[1:52:57] time. I'll get back to
[1:53:02] it. And again, is there a cheaper
[1:53:05] version? Can I only take part of
[1:53:07] something and
[1:53:12] not something that's so
[1:53:15] heavy? Can I can I do just do a part of
[1:53:18] it? Is there a cheaper version? Is there
[1:53:22] a lighter package? Do I have to buy it
[1:53:25] all? Do I have to take it
[1:53:28] all? So, this is the flesh talking to
[1:53:31] the spirit. The spirit says, "I want to
[1:53:33] sell you this life.
[1:53:36] And your flesh is saying, "Well, do you
[1:53:38] have a cheaper
[1:53:39] version? I didn't know it was going to
[1:53:41] cost so much. Can I do this another
[1:53:45] time? I didn't budget for
[1:53:48] this. I didn't plan for
[1:53:51] this." But if you don't overcome that
[1:53:54] guy,
[1:54:06] They call that cost
[1:54:10] objectives. And then you
[1:54:13] know this is the old flesh guy talking
[1:54:17] to the
[1:54:19] spirit. I need more time to think about
[1:54:22] it.
[1:54:29] more
[1:54:30] consideration, more time to look for
[1:54:39] excuses. The old stall
[1:54:42] tactic. Well, I I if I I'm going to I'm
[1:54:46] going to pray about
[1:54:49] it. It's God speaking to you
[1:54:53] expressly. You know it's right. You know
[1:54:57] the light wants to shine. You know you
[1:54:59] can be a better Christian. You know you
[1:55:01] can testify. You know all these things.
[1:55:04] The spirit's dying to come out. The Holy
[1:55:08] Spirit is dying to
[1:55:10] move in the life of the believer. But
[1:55:14] the believer's
[1:55:16] flesh, you understand? has all these
[1:55:19] little
[1:55:21] questions and all these little
[1:55:24] resistances and all these little
[1:55:29] thoughts. Now, we can bring this to the
[1:55:32] the greatest battle ever fought. Yes,
[1:55:35] they're going on in their mind. Yes,
[1:55:37] it's the flesh waring against the
[1:55:38] spirit. And the spirit's handling every
[1:55:41] one of these objections. Well, how much
[1:55:43] does this cost? It's free.
[1:55:50] Choose this day who you'll
[1:55:52] serve. The words answering back every
[1:55:56] one of these objections. I'll not leave
[1:55:58] you. I'll not forsake you. I'll be with
[1:56:00] you, even in you. But I need more
[1:56:03] time to think about it.
[1:56:07] Oh, I want to wait
[1:56:09] until until I get back from vacation,
[1:56:13] till I get this project finished, till
[1:56:15] this, till that. In other words, I want
[1:56:18] to wait till I get done doing what I'm
[1:56:24] doing. I'll go testify to that guy. I'll
[1:56:28] go make it right. I'll go do. But as
[1:56:31] soon as I get
[1:56:32] done with what I'm
[1:56:37] doing, now I'm I'm not saying this in
[1:56:39] condemnation.
[1:56:41] I'm saying that we have got to
[1:56:44] understand if we're going to go forward,
[1:56:47] not as a church that can shout in this
[1:56:50] building, but as a church that's going
[1:56:53] to take the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:56:55] that our prophet of God presented to us,
[1:56:58] what we heard on tape out to this world,
[1:57:02] you are going to have to fight every
[1:57:04] single objection that your flesh has.
[1:57:17] This is just world overcoming
[1:57:20] world. Can you imagine how how how
[1:57:24] how much it is with the
[1:57:29] spirit. I need to explore my
[1:57:33] options. I got to know what else is out
[1:57:36] there to buy.
[1:57:38] I want to buy a fishing reel. You know
[1:57:39] what I do when I buy a fishing reel? I
[1:57:42] read about so many fishing reels, by the
[1:57:44] time I'm done, I'm so confused. I just
[1:57:46] want to take a cork and a
[1:57:52] bobber. This one cranks this fast. This
[1:57:54] one spills that one. This got nine
[1:57:56] bearings. This one's got this
[1:58:00] bearing. You know, how many guns does it
[1:58:03] take to kill a deer? I don't know.
[1:58:04] There's 9,000 guns out there.
[1:58:10] There's
[1:58:11] always, you know, always to
[1:58:16] explore. Oh, I don't want to just
[1:58:18] testify. I just don't want to believe
[1:58:20] it. I just don't want to go do it. I
[1:58:23] don't want to be compelled. I don't want
[1:58:25] to act on inspiration. I don't want to
[1:58:27] make immediate decision. I want to
[1:58:31] explore. Forever learning and never
[1:58:35] coming to realization through never
[1:58:37] making the decision, never making the
[1:58:40] commitment, never getting down and
[1:58:42] praying through and saying, "I'm going
[1:58:43] to get down. I'm going to pray through
[1:58:44] and when I going to come up from here,
[1:58:46] I'm going to be different. I'm going to
[1:58:48] let the spirit of God take control of my
[1:58:50] life. I'm going to overcome this
[1:58:53] objection. I'm always procrastinating.
[1:58:56] I'm always gonna do it another day. I'm
[1:58:58] always going to do it when I get done
[1:59:00] with this. I'm always weighing how much
[1:59:02] it's going to cost. What's it going to
[1:59:04] mean? What effect is it going to have on
[1:59:06] my
[1:59:08] life? The question is, when are
[1:59:15] we? Everybody in here ought to have a
[1:59:19] convert by the end of the year.
[1:59:26] You know, they teach an encyclopedia
[1:59:28] salesman. They don't sell encyclopedias
[1:59:30] anymore. Shows you how old I
[1:59:32] am. But they used to get it ingrained in
[1:59:36] their
[1:59:37] head. You will only
[1:59:41] sell encyclopedia set one in
[1:59:46] every 125 appointments.
[1:59:54] So what do you think they
[1:59:56] do? They do hundreds of
[2:00:01] appointments. They don't let the first
[2:00:03] snow stop them. They don't let the next
[2:00:05] snow stop them. You heard it on the
[2:00:07] tape. If they don't want it, you don't
[2:00:09] stop.
[2:00:11] You don't testify to one person. He
[2:00:13] said, "Go into all the world."
[2:00:16] You just don't have one thing to
[2:00:18] overcome in your life. You have hundreds
[2:00:20] of things to overcome in your life. You
[2:00:22] just don't make one change in your life.
[2:00:25] You make thousands of changes in your
[2:00:27] life. And every single one of these uh
[2:00:30] objections for every circumstance, you
[2:00:33] got to fight through them all. You've
[2:00:35] got to fight.
[2:00:40] You've got to overcome. It's given to
[2:00:43] the overcomer to sit with me on my
[2:00:45] father's throne. Get rid of all these
[2:00:48] things in your mind. Get rid of beating
[2:00:50] yourself down. Get rid of running
[2:00:52] yourself down. I hate it when a person
[2:00:54] runs themselves
[2:01:01] down. Creates an
[2:01:05] excuse to make mistake after mistake
[2:01:08] after
[2:01:09] mistake. Oh, this is just the way I am.
[2:01:11] I'm a bum. I make mistakes. I'm just no
[2:01:15] good.
[2:01:20] Jesus didn't buy junk.
[2:01:25] He gets what he paid
[2:01:33] for. Now is not the right
[2:01:36] time. Oh, I'll do
[2:01:39] it, but not
[2:01:42] now. Now is not the right time. I don't
[2:01:45] want to deal with this
[2:01:49] now.
[2:01:53] Denial. Yeah, it's true. I shouldn't
[2:01:57] gossip. But I don't really want to deal
[2:02:00] with it right
[2:02:02] now. I know I'm a spoiled
[2:02:04] brat. I know I'm a snot snot. I know I'm
[2:02:08] mean to my husband. I know I degrade
[2:02:10] him. I know I say bad things. I know. I
[2:02:13] know I turn my shoulder. I know I get
[2:02:15] angry. I know I get fussy. But I don't
[2:02:19] want to deal with it right
[2:02:22] now. You know how Jesus answered that,
[2:02:24] don't you? Thou
[2:02:26] fool, thy soul might be required of you
[2:02:29] this
[2:02:30] night. It's not
[2:02:32] you. It's the
[2:02:37] objections. It's the
[2:02:39] resistance. That's why you have to
[2:02:42] overcome. If there's no
[2:02:46] resistance, you wouldn't have to
[2:02:48] overcome. Even in electronics, they got
[2:02:51] resistors because if there wasn't
[2:02:53] something resistor, the it would go and
[2:02:55] kill. It would destroy everything
[2:02:59] else. They got to control the power. Oh,
[2:03:03] that's what Satan does. He wants to
[2:03:05] control the power.
[2:03:08] He don't mind for a little bit of you to
[2:03:10] leak out someplace where it's got of no
[2:03:13] significance.
[2:03:15] But did you hear what our prophet said?
[2:03:17] He says, "Your influence never
[2:03:26] dies." He said, "You're a Christian
[2:03:29] every
[2:03:30] day. Loving, sweet,
[2:03:34] kind, because you don't know. You're the
[2:03:37] billboard. You have a sponsor. You're
[2:03:40] representing Christ. But we think, "Oh,
[2:03:43] there's another time to do that or I'll
[2:03:45] do it next week. I'll do it the you
[2:03:48] know, now's not the right
[2:03:51] time." You know, let's revisit this
[2:03:54] later.
[2:04:01] I'll revisit
[2:04:03] this. And then we revisit the same thing
[2:04:06] over and over and over and over again.
[2:04:10] Oh, Satan's
[2:04:11] clever. He'll come at you five or six
[2:04:13] times right in a row and then and and
[2:04:16] you'll never fight it and then he just
[2:04:19] pulls back and you say, "I'll deal with
[2:04:22] this another time." And I'm just not
[2:04:25] talking about battling sin. I'm talking
[2:04:27] about good works.
[2:04:30] I'm talking about going forward, laying
[2:04:32] for yourself a pattern of good works.
[2:04:35] I'll start doing good
[2:04:38] works. In a few
[2:04:41] months, I'll start visiting the father
[2:04:44] and the homeless and the sick. In a few
[2:04:46] months, I'll start doing these things.
[2:04:49] In a few
[2:04:50] months, I'll start being kind and gentle
[2:04:53] and bridle my tongue. in a few months. I
[2:04:57] know I need to do it, but not right
[2:05:00] now. I still got a little bit of things
[2:05:02] I want to share with the sister down the
[2:05:09] street or I I don't I I I'm not ready to
[2:05:13] shut my
[2:05:15] ear to what people are saying. I'm not
[2:05:19] ready to say I don't want to hear about
[2:05:20] it.
[2:05:23] Not interested.
[2:05:26] I don't want to be out of the
[2:05:29] loop. Well, you're not in the loop.
[2:05:31] You're in the
[2:05:33] dupe. Satan's duped you into thinking
[2:05:37] you're spiritual because you can
[2:05:41] gossip. It's a
[2:05:45] spirit. It's the counterpirit to
[2:05:47] testifying.
[2:05:54] Yeah, let me circle back to
[2:05:56] you. Let me get around to it.
[2:06:00] Intentionally promising
[2:06:03] yourself that you'll do actions
[2:06:08] later. Getting out of it by making false
[2:06:13] promises. Yeah, I I'll I'll get I'll get
[2:06:16] I'll circle around. I'll I'll I'll note
[2:06:19] this down, but I'll get around to it
[2:06:21] later.
[2:06:24] Here's the one I
[2:06:27] like. This isn't
[2:06:30] urgent. It has nothing to do with
[2:06:37] salvation. It has nothing to do with my
[2:06:43] soul. It's just a little thing.
[2:06:48] You you you you know it's like it's
[2:06:52] because it's that inner that outer man
[2:06:56] dealing with that inner man. Even the
[2:06:59] outer man is dealing in the
[2:07:03] subconscious. These are these are things
[2:07:05] that all of a sudden they're in your
[2:07:08] mind.
[2:07:12] It's a builtin
[2:07:14] resistance of the flesh against the
[2:07:20] spirit. Like we talked about being
[2:07:22] successful. Successful people get up
[2:07:28] early. Boy, this guy don't like to get
[2:07:30] up
[2:07:32] early. I'm starting to try to come up
[2:07:35] with all kinds of excuses. I'm 75. I'm
[2:07:39] gonna retire and I I I I get a social
[2:07:43] security
[2:07:46] and and you know what your success goes
[2:07:52] bloop bloop because successful people
[2:07:56] get up. How many times I heard say I got
[2:07:59] up at the break of dawn and I went out
[2:08:02] in the woods and I prayed.
[2:08:06] That'll never
[2:08:07] change. The resistance won't change.
[2:08:10] Overcoming won't change. The results of
[2:08:14] overcoming will not change. You fight
[2:08:17] the resistance, you'll see the fruits.
[2:08:22] That's a promise. That's a thus sayaith
[2:08:24] the Lord from the
[2:08:28] scriptures. But you got to know your
[2:08:30] resistance. You got to know the enemy.
[2:08:33] You've got to know his tactics. You've
[2:08:35] got to know he's fighting
[2:08:40] us. The battle is from without and it's
[2:08:44] from within. But it isn't that
[2:08:49] urgent. It's not important. It's a
[2:08:53] little thing. No, you know when it's
[2:08:55] important to do whenever it comes.
[2:08:58] Whether it's a good work, whether it's
[2:09:00] overcoming something. Now is the time to
[2:09:03] move.
[2:09:05] This is the day that the Lord has chose.
[2:09:08] This is the hour that the Lord has. Just
[2:09:11] like your
[2:09:12] healing. Sometimes you're sick and you
[2:09:14] just think, "Well, it's not that
[2:09:16] urgent. You know, I'm not on my
[2:09:18] deathbed." Don't wait till you're on
[2:09:20] your deathbed. God's a healer.
[2:09:25] He'll heal any part of you that's wrong
[2:09:28] with you. But listen to what our
[2:09:31] messenger said. You don't have to lay
[2:09:32] your hands on the sick and feel the
[2:09:35] power of God. What it means to
[2:09:37] experience a bag of bones being brought
[2:09:40] up. He says you don't need any of that
[2:09:43] to be a billboard by God. You need the
[2:09:45] love of God shed abroad in your heart by
[2:09:47] the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:51] Let us move on to perfection. These
[2:09:53] things we will do if God so permit.
[2:09:58] But if you're a
[2:10:00] Christian, signs will follow you.
[2:10:04] You won't make signs. You won't produce
[2:10:07] signs. They will follow you. They will
[2:10:10] follow in the people that you have
[2:10:14] influenced. That's where the sign will
[2:10:16] show up. You don't need a sign. You've
[2:10:19] got an inddwelling spirit of God. You've
[2:10:22] got him in your heart. You're walking
[2:10:24] after him. The love of God's in your
[2:10:26] heart, everything else follows.
[2:10:29] But you got to remember, one of the
[2:10:31] biggest resistances is you've got to
[2:10:34] fight is it's not urgent. This isn't the
[2:10:37] time. I'll loop around. I'll get to it
[2:10:42] later. Yeah, I need to finish other
[2:10:44] things. I've got to take care of other
[2:10:47] things. You know, those are all great
[2:10:49] things. this he said he said you know or
[2:10:54] I like this one I just signed up for
[2:10:56] something
[2:10:59] else well you know something cancel that
[2:11:09] contract everything will come
[2:11:11] up now I'm just talking about in the
[2:11:14] natural world you given a type the
[2:11:16] natural types the bureau right could I
[2:11:18] use
[2:11:19] that. So when somebody's trying to sell
[2:11:22] something, he already knows there's a
[2:11:25] barrage of excuses coming. Well, the
[2:11:28] spirit
[2:11:31] knows that when it's going to ask your
[2:11:35] flesh to make a move into the
[2:11:39] supernatural that your flesh is going to
[2:11:46] resist. It already
[2:11:50] knows and you've got to handle that. You
[2:11:54] got to go back what your heart's
[2:11:58] desire. Love's motivating you. The
[2:12:01] spirit of God's motivating you. The word
[2:12:04] of God's motivating. You've got a
[2:12:06] scriptural answer. When Jesus came on
[2:12:09] the scene, Satan resisted him.
[2:12:12] If thou be, if thou
[2:12:14] be, it is written. It is written. It is
[2:12:21] written. Satan says, flesh says, what's
[2:12:24] the cost? The spirit says, I'm willing
[2:12:27] to lay down my life for this gospel.
[2:12:32] Put this flesh says, put it off to
[2:12:34] another time. The spirit says, no, this
[2:12:37] is the day that the Lord hath made. This
[2:12:39] is the day of my deliverance. This is
[2:12:41] the day we're going to cross over. This
[2:12:43] is the day the wall's going to come
[2:12:45] tumbling down.
[2:12:48] The resistance speaks. The spirit speaks
[2:12:55] back. Hear ye
[2:12:58] him. Get in tune to listening to the
[2:13:03] spirit speak in your
[2:13:06] life. Don't condemn yourself.
[2:13:11] because you have
[2:13:16] resistance. Don't condemn yourself
[2:13:18] because your flesh fights you. Don't
[2:13:21] condemn yourself because your flesh
[2:13:23] lusts after the things of the world.
[2:13:25] Don't condemn yourself because your
[2:13:26] flesh is a
[2:13:28] liar. You were born in sin, shaped in
[2:13:32] iniquity, caping in the world speaking
[2:13:34] lies. Don't get mad at your flesh. Get
[2:13:37] the Holy Spirit.
[2:13:42] You know, don't be mad if you're sick
[2:13:44] when you got medicine to
[2:13:50] take. Feed the spiritual
[2:13:54] person. Build them up in Christ. Make
[2:13:58] them
[2:13:59] stronger. But Satan's tricked us into he
[2:14:02] he brings the resistance. Our floods
[2:14:04] brings resistance and we don't think
[2:14:06] we're Christians. I better close.
[2:14:10] You
[2:14:11] know, he says, "I like this. I'm not
[2:14:14] sure it'll work for
[2:14:19] me. I'm sure it works for the other guy,
[2:14:21] but I'm not sure if I pray. I'm not sure
[2:14:23] it works. If I do this, I'm not sure
[2:14:26] it'll work. I'm not sure it'll work for
[2:14:30] me. If it works, it works. It works for
[2:14:35] anybody.
[2:14:37] It works for everybody. God is not a
[2:14:40] respector of persons. It'll work for
[2:14:43] you. Healing will work for you.
[2:14:46] Deliverance will work for you. Knowledge
[2:14:49] will work for you. Wisdom will work for
[2:14:51] you. Understanding will work for you.
[2:14:54] You can overcome. It'll work for you. It
[2:14:58] is for you. Do not let anybody ever tell
[2:15:02] you that there's not one part of this
[2:15:05] gospel that's not for you. All the word
[2:15:08] of God, every promise in the book is
[2:15:11] mine. Every chapter, every verse, every
[2:15:15] line.
[2:15:17] It's all for you, little flock. It's the
[2:15:21] father's good pleasure to give you the
[2:15:26] kingdom, not
[2:15:35] me. I remember a little cartoon I saw
[2:15:38] always growing up. It was called Not
[2:15:42] Me. You know, it showed the little kids
[2:15:44] with the cake all over their face and
[2:15:46] and the kids say, "Did you eat the
[2:15:48] cake?" And the kids all covered in cake
[2:15:51] and he says, "Not me." And then there's
[2:15:54] this little guy over there standing on
[2:15:56] the side and he's got, "Not
[2:15:59] me." The oh, not me
[2:16:01] spirit. No. Yes, me. Did Jesus die for?
[2:16:07] Yes.
[2:16:10] Not me. Did Jesus heal? Not
[2:16:14] me. Get rid of that not me guy.
[2:16:18] Fight the resistance. The resistance
[2:16:21] doesn't take your faith. Think it not
[2:16:24] strange at the fiery darts of the enemy.
[2:16:27] Think it not strange at the trying of
[2:16:30] your faith. I I like what the the the
[2:16:32] brother said Wednesday night. He he
[2:16:34] said, "I I I don't I'm not going to get
[2:16:37] his words just right." He said, "But if
[2:16:38] you don't get a victory, at least you'll
[2:16:40] get a lesson. Maybe there's something
[2:16:42] you got to learn before you get it.
[2:16:47] But God don't quit.
[2:16:50] God's not going to quit on you.
[2:16:53] He's not going to He didn't quit on
[2:16:55] Paul. He's not going to quit on you. He
[2:16:59] didn't keep hold Paul back because of
[2:17:01] what he
[2:17:03] did. Paul had to overcome that and he
[2:17:07] fought through it. I like this. It
[2:17:09] sounds too good to be true.
[2:17:12] Not me. Sounds too good. Oh, I'm so
[2:17:21] unworthy. So
[2:17:24] unworthy. You I I I I you know, it's
[2:17:28] like saying, "Do you want to go eat? Are
[2:17:30] you
[2:17:31] hungry?" And then you get some weird
[2:17:33] answer. I I had a bowl of cereal this
[2:17:36] morning.
[2:17:41] Do you think I care whether you had a
[2:17:44] bowl of cereal in the morning? I really
[2:17:48] don't. And I'm still overcoming in the
[2:17:51] flesh. So I say, would you answer the
[2:17:54] question
[2:17:55] already? Are you hungry or not?
[2:17:59] Because the only reason I'm asking you
[2:18:02] if you're hungry because my wife reminds
[2:18:05] me every time I go out the door, don't
[2:18:08] forget those brothers have to eat.
[2:18:15] Cuz I'll work till it gets done. I don't
[2:18:19] care whether we eat or
[2:18:23] not. But you can't even get a straight
[2:18:25] answer out of somebody. And yet the
[2:18:28] Bible says, "Let your yays be yays and
[2:18:30] your naysay be nays."
[2:18:33] See, that's all part of that built-in
[2:18:35] resistance.
[2:18:38] And I'm I'm not I guess I'm okay. You
[2:18:42] can always vote me out. We'll have a
[2:18:44] vote in
[2:18:48] 2030. Sounds too good, but true. I love
[2:18:50] this one. I've been burned
[2:18:53] before or I know somebody else who's
[2:18:56] been burned. Always finding some excuse,
[2:18:59] somebody else to put it
[2:19:01] on. How do I know this doesn't just
[2:19:04] another gimmick or another generic
[2:19:07] thing? How do I know this is the real
[2:19:10] thing, not just a just a some other
[2:19:14] thing, not just the same old thing? all
[2:19:17] these
[2:19:18] things. The minute you come up, one of
[2:19:22] these things starts going, "Oh, how do I
[2:19:24] know this is really the word? How do I
[2:19:26] know this is the right thing to do? I've
[2:19:28] got to think about it. I've got to
[2:19:30] circle back to it. I will do it
[2:19:33] later." And pretty soon you never face
[2:19:36] the issue.
[2:19:39] You know, I mean, if you if you're
[2:19:41] failing at something over and over
[2:19:43] again, you might want to stop a
[2:19:48] moment and examine
[2:19:51] it. Maybe it's just you need to go in a
[2:19:54] complete different
[2:19:56] direction. Maybe there's a lot of
[2:19:58] thoughts you have to get out of your
[2:20:00] mind. But God's word does not fail. He
[2:20:04] gave this word. He didn't need the word
[2:20:06] himself. He was the word
[2:20:09] in the beginning was the
[2:20:12] word. He was He's the I am.
[2:20:18] He didn't have to
[2:20:22] resurrect. He didn't have to do
[2:20:24] anything. Everything he did was so he
[2:20:27] could sponsor you.
[2:20:29] So you could know the product's real,
[2:20:32] the product's genuine, the product's
[2:20:34] been tested, the product's been proven.
[2:20:37] He laid his hand on the sick and they
[2:20:39] recovered. So you can lay your hands on
[2:20:41] the sick and they'll recover. He rose
[2:20:44] from the dead so you know that you'll
[2:20:46] rise from the dead. He cast out devils
[2:20:48] so you know you can cast out devils. He
[2:20:51] didn't need to do it for him. He did it
[2:20:53] for you. He did it so he could sponsor
[2:20:55] you. He made the product for you.
[2:21:00] Eternal life was for you. In fact, he
[2:21:02] gave it to you and he's trying to get
[2:21:05] you to discover it. But you have to
[2:21:07] overcome the resistance in order to
[2:21:11] discover it.
[2:21:13] You got to buy the product. You've got
[2:21:16] to take the baptism. You say, "Well, I
[2:21:18] don't sure if I've got the baptism."
[2:21:20] Then get down and pray through again
[2:21:23] until it's renewed in your life.
[2:21:31] Until you
[2:21:33] overcome. And if something comes visit
[2:21:35] you again, fight it again.
[2:21:39] That's right.
[2:21:42] But we've got to move forward.
[2:21:48] We've got to get what we've got to this
[2:21:50] dying generation.
[2:21:54] We've got to see the results, not within
[2:21:57] in ourselves.
[2:22:00] You know where all the results are done?
[2:22:02] First, they're done in a
[2:22:06] lab. And then after they're pretty sure
[2:22:08] it doesn't kill a
[2:22:10] rat, they'll find a human being.
[2:22:15] And if it don't kill the human being,
[2:22:17] they sell it to the world.
[2:22:21] Well, I'm tired of just being
[2:22:24] a a lab. Well, I wasn't going to say
[2:22:31] that. I want to bring it to the
[2:22:34] world. And if I want to bring it to the
[2:22:36] world, I'm going to meet resistance,
[2:22:38] brother Matt. And it ain't going to be
[2:22:41] easy.
[2:22:43] And there's going to be people smarter
[2:22:44] than me. There's going to be people
[2:22:46] richer than me. There's going to be
[2:22:49] people that
[2:22:53] famouser. But I've got the words of
[2:22:56] eternal
[2:22:59] life. And if my heart's right, I want
[2:23:01] them to have what I've got because
[2:23:04] there's nothing like it. There's not
[2:23:06] another product anywhere. and and he
[2:23:10] says, you know, and then there there's
[2:23:13] the other one is there's so many other
[2:23:15] people out there, so many
[2:23:18] voices, but my
[2:23:20] sheep hear my
[2:23:22] voice. I don't see enough reviews or
[2:23:28] testimonies. Everybody's
[2:23:31] waiting till they know it works.
[2:23:35] But you know, God's going to put you in
[2:23:36] the position where you're the first one,
[2:23:39] where you have your own testimony. You
[2:23:41] stepped out on your own two feet. You
[2:23:44] done something nobody else has done
[2:23:47] before. You know, it doesn't have to
[2:23:49] have social media
[2:23:52] approval. We're led by the spirit of
[2:23:56] God.
[2:23:59] You I like the other one. You seem new
[2:24:02] at
[2:24:04] this. Yeah, I am
[2:24:06] new. But my product's been around since
[2:24:09] the beginning of
[2:24:11] time, before time began. Yeah, I'm a
[2:24:14] young Christian. I'm new at this. I'm a
[2:24:17] new salesman. I'm a new
[2:24:21] billboard. But God put me because my
[2:24:25] message is going to get to somebody.
[2:24:30] He's having me shine my light because
[2:24:32] somebody's gonna see it.
[2:24:35] One of the great authors wrote it like
[2:24:37] this. We're fools to compare ourselves
[2:24:40] one with
[2:24:43] another. These
[2:24:47] are and the last objection is I'm not
[2:24:50] sure I can trust the
[2:24:57] process. That's the big one.
[2:25:00] I'm not sure I can trust the fact if I
[2:25:04] take somebody by the hand and I say,
[2:25:07] "Let us
[2:25:09] pray." And I pray with the sincerity of
[2:25:12] my heart, I'm not sure that process
[2:25:16] works. I need a bigger
[2:25:19] process. I need some
[2:25:22] discernment or I need more people to
[2:25:26] gather around. I'm not sure that the
[2:25:29] process works if I just tell somebody
[2:25:33] how my candle got
[2:25:35] lit. That that'll
[2:25:38] work. I'm not sure of the process. It's
[2:25:41] got to be bigger. It's got to be It's
[2:25:45] got to be more to it than this.
[2:25:50] And all these
[2:25:52] things are turnurning in our minds and
[2:25:56] in the
[2:25:57] world because we're going into a
[2:26:00] world. Brother Rim said God gave him the
[2:26:03] Holy
[2:26:04] Ghost and endued him with power on high
[2:26:08] because he knew he was sending them into
[2:26:11] a world that had many
[2:26:13] gods, many pagan gods. And he had to
[2:26:17] have a way to show that his God was the
[2:26:21] one and
[2:26:23] true
[2:26:25] God. And when Paul went up on Mars Hill,
[2:26:29] he said, "I noticed you have all these
[2:26:32] gods
[2:26:33] here." He says, "I want to tell you
[2:26:35] about a God you don't have, the one and
[2:26:39] only true living God."
[2:26:42] And he began to
[2:26:43] testify about the God that he serves,
[2:26:47] what he did, how he was on the road to
[2:26:50] Damascus, and how a light came and said,
[2:26:53] "Paul, it's hard to clear." How he got
[2:26:55] delivered, how he was shipwrecked, and
[2:26:58] how he shook the serpent off. And he
[2:27:00] began to testify of all the great things
[2:27:03] that God had
[2:27:07] done and even to where he wanted to knew
[2:27:11] he had to go testify even to
[2:27:16] Caesar. We have
[2:27:19] resistance. The flesh wars against the
[2:27:22] spirit. The spirit against the
[2:27:26] flesh. It fights us.
[2:27:29] Our past sins fights
[2:27:32] us. Our the weakness of our flesh fights
[2:27:36] us. Our failures fight
[2:27:40] us. There are resistance to everything
[2:27:43] that we would say or
[2:27:49] do. You know,
[2:27:53] sometimes we're shy.
[2:27:56] Did you know brother Brandham says that
[2:27:58] he likes shy
[2:28:01] girls? There's nothing wrong with those
[2:28:05] things. There's two voices out
[2:28:07] there. The voice of the
[2:28:10] word, which the voice we have in this
[2:28:12] day was promised by this word, and
[2:28:15] there's the world and the things of the
[2:28:18] world. And they're going to fight
[2:28:20] against you. And your own nature is
[2:28:22] going to fight against you. But it's
[2:28:24] given to you to
[2:28:26] overcome. We've got to handle the
[2:28:29] objectives. We've got to overcome. And
[2:28:32] we've got to make the step of faith to
[2:28:36] step out on God's word and believe every
[2:28:39] promise of God's word. And the process
[2:28:44] works. He's your
[2:28:46] sponsor. And because he sponsored you to
[2:28:49] say it, he'll not leave you nor forsake
[2:28:52] you, but he'll be with you, even in you
[2:28:56] till the end. It's late. God bless you.
[2:28:58] Good
[2:29:00] [Applause]
[2:29:13] morning. Amen. Aren't you glad you're
[2:29:16] available this morning? Let's all stand.
[2:29:31] See, oh
[2:29:34] wonderful,
[2:29:36] merciful
[2:29:39] savior, precious
[2:29:42] redeemer and friend.
[2:29:48] Who would have thought that a
[2:29:52] lamb
[2:29:54] would rescue the souls of
[2:29:59] heaven? Oh, you rescue the souls of
[2:30:07] pain. Oh, and counel and comfort to
[2:30:12] keep.
[2:30:15] Oh, and spirit we long to in
[2:30:22] pray. You offer hope when our
[2:30:29] hearts
[2:30:30] hopelessly lost
[2:30:34] away. Oh, we
[2:30:37] hopelessly lost.
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:42] Oh, you are the one that we
[2:30:47] [Music]
[2:30:49] praise. You are the one we adore.
[2:30:57] You give the healing and the grace.
[2:31:04] [Music]
[2:31:06] Oh, your heart for
[2:31:09] you. Our hearts always wonderful.
[2:31:16] Oh, and all mighty inf.
[2:31:21] [Music]
[2:31:23] Oh, and
[2:31:25] faithfully loving
[2:31:29] [Music]
[2:31:32] your nation.
[2:31:35] [Music]
[2:31:37] Oh, I'm falling before your
[2:31:42] throne. Oh, we're falling before your
[2:31:48] throne.
[2:31:52] You are the one that we
[2:31:56] [Music]
[2:31:57] praise. You are the one we adore.
[2:32:05] You give the healing and
[2:32:09] grace on
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:16] earth. Oh my heart.
[2:32:21] Sing
[2:32:23] again.
