[27:29] [Music]
[27:53] [Music]
[28:01] foreign
[28:08] [Music]
[29:12] scripture reading and then we'll be
[29:14] seated let's start in first John chapter
[29:16] five
[29:21] first John chapter five we'll start from
[29:23] verse one
[29:25] it says whosoever believe that Jesus is
[29:27] the Christ is one of God and everyone
[29:29] that loveth him that loveth him that the
[29:32] god that be God loveth him also has
[29:34] begotten of him
[29:36] he says by this we know that we love the
[29:38] children of God when we love God and
[29:40] keep his commandment for this is the
[29:42] love of God that we keep his commandment
[29:44] and his Commandments are not Grievous it
[29:46] says for whatsoever whatsoever is born
[29:48] of God overcomes the world overcometh
[29:50] the world and this is the victory that
[29:52] overcometh the world even our faith he
[29:54] says who is who is he that overcometh
[29:55] the world but he that believeth that
[29:57] Jesus is the son of God
[29:59] this is he that come by water and blood
[30:02] and even Jesus Christ not by water only
[30:05] but by water and blood and it is the
[30:07] scripture that bearth witness because
[30:08] the spirit is truth for there are three
[30:11] that their record of in heaven the
[30:13] father of the word and the Holy Ghost
[30:14] and these three are one and the three
[30:16] and there are and there are three now
[30:18] they're witness in Earth their Spirit
[30:20] and the water and the blood and these
[30:22] three agree in one if we receive the
[30:24] witness of man the witness of God is
[30:26] greater this is the witness of God which
[30:28] he had testified of his son he that
[30:30] believeth on the son of on the Son of
[30:32] God had the witness of himself he that
[30:34] believeth not God had the witness of a
[30:37] lie of him that a witness had made him a
[30:39] liar because he believed not the record
[30:41] of that God gave his son it says and
[30:43] this is the record that God had given to
[30:46] us eternal life and this life is in his
[30:48] son that he
[30:50] he that had the son had life and he died
[30:53] not the Son of God had not life these
[30:55] things have I written unto you that you
[30:57] believe on the name of the son of God
[30:59] Amen the godhead the blessing on the
[31:01] reading of his word you may be seated
[31:02] also turn your Bibles once again just
[31:04] continue to have you open First Peter
[31:05] chapter one we're going to read from 22
[31:07] to 25 it says seeing ye have purified
[31:09] your soul uh you know obeying the truth
[31:11] through the spirit unto
[31:13] um unfind love and and Brethren he says
[31:16] see that ye love one another with pure
[31:18] heart with pure heart fervently being
[31:21] born again not of correct we'll see that
[31:22] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[31:24] abideth which liveth and abideth forever
[31:26] for All Flesh is grass and all glory of
[31:29] man is as flower of grass the grass with
[31:32] it and the follower wherefore fadeth
[31:34] away but the word of God endureth
[31:36] forever
[31:37] and this is the word which by the gospel
[31:39] is preached unto you one more scripture
[31:41] in Matthew 24 verse 35 he says Heaven
[31:44] and Earth will pass away but my word
[31:46] shall never pass away
[31:48] amen I certainly enjoyed the word this
[31:51] morning I think
[31:53] the god when the prophet says that
[31:56] God always has a way to comfort his
[31:58] children he says that the message of the
[32:01] hour will meet
[32:02] the challenge of the hour and I've
[32:04] always believed that regardless of what
[32:05] we're going through I believe that God
[32:07] has a word and I really appreciate what
[32:08] Matthew had to say this morning we talk
[32:10] about a God who can take a bad situation
[32:12] and turn it into good you know he's a
[32:14] God who takes the negative turns it into
[32:16] a positive The God Who takes the trial
[32:17] and turns it into Victory God who takes
[32:19] defeat and changes into Victory it takes
[32:21] a shameful situation and turns it into a
[32:22] testimony that's kind of because why he
[32:24] has the power of transformation in fact
[32:26] that's what he socializes in you come
[32:27] you're all broken up and you're all out
[32:29] of shape and shameful and you don't even
[32:31] know where to start he says this is what
[32:32] I specialize in I remember him talking
[32:33] about the testimony I think he went into
[32:35] a mental institution and he was looking
[32:36] for this young lady and and he came in
[32:38] they had to thought you know it was
[32:39] someone who was in changing everything
[32:41] and then he found the young lady was
[32:42] talking and he says it's me and then
[32:43] it's beginning to talk to her she should
[32:45] begin to pour out her heart and
[32:46] everything and all that was within her
[32:48] heart and and she gets there and she
[32:49] says all of this and but why don't you
[32:50] come to Christ why don't you believe he
[32:51] says oh he'll never take me like this
[32:53] that's the material that God works in
[32:55] that's the kind of material he's ready
[32:57] to take and hold in everything you know
[32:58] our Pastor Ray that quote I was going to
[33:00] bring it out but you know we don't know
[33:01] man we don't understand situation
[33:05] and oftentimes God will have to take
[33:07] something that he already built and
[33:08] break it apart so we can build a new one
[33:10] so we can build the greater one so we
[33:11] can make it even better than what he did
[33:12] before the scripture says in Psalm 30
[33:14] and 11 it says thou has turned my
[33:16] morning into dancing
[33:18] thou has put off my shot clause and
[33:20] grinded me with something with gladness
[33:22] it says we like we it says it says the
[33:25] scripture was saying Romans 8 it says
[33:26] that all and we know that all things
[33:27] work together for good to them that love
[33:30] God and to them who are called according
[33:31] to his purpose in other words all we are
[33:33] here to do is to know that we are called
[33:34] for his purpose as long as we are here
[33:36] doing his purpose everything will work
[33:38] out for good I was at home and just
[33:40] thinking and I thought about the story
[33:42] the program talks about this young
[33:44] missionary who was planning to go to
[33:46] Africa to go preach and and he said that
[33:49] uh when when he got ready to go he went
[33:51] before the board and he told them that
[33:52] he was going to go to Africa and take
[33:53] his family I believe they had two
[33:54] daughters he was planning to take them
[33:55] and everything and and so when he got
[33:56] before the board to begin to question
[33:58] him that again says you know are you
[33:59] really sure you want to go and if I
[34:00] could just read it so he went before the
[34:01] board meeting in the church and it says
[34:02] God called me to be to go in the mission
[34:04] failed away in a jungle in Rhodesia in
[34:06] the jungle infected with malaria and
[34:07] fever and hot sun and and and and plates
[34:10] and leprosy and all kinds of diseases
[34:11] back in the jungle where he was going to
[34:13] what he was going to make it says take
[34:15] the rest of his life uh he says he sold
[34:17] his home he sold his home and he had all
[34:19] the mission board wanted to test him and
[34:21] see it says are you sure now it says yes
[34:23] I am positive they said unto him sir if
[34:26] you thought on this manner that you've
[34:28] got two little two pretty little girls
[34:29] and go in the lovely young wife and he
[34:31] says why don't you go over and see how
[34:33] it is and then come back he said no the
[34:35] Lord told me it says oh so it's so real
[34:37] he said the Lord called me and I don't I
[34:40] don't want to leave my home he says I
[34:42] don't want to leave
[40:46] my church I don't want to leave my
[40:48] people it says but the Lord called me
[40:51] back there in that jungle
[40:54] and it says and he said sir did you know
[40:58] that your little girls could get yellow
[41:00] fever and black fever and die overnight
[41:02] he referred to a different people that
[41:05] had lost their children the little
[41:07] fellows and I had taken them back there
[41:10] and and he says on diseases I had no
[41:13] that they had no uh inoculation and
[41:17] things like leprosy and and and your
[41:19] pretty wife and the two little girl with
[41:21] Leprosy and the hot sun and the things
[41:23] they've put on aren't you afraid of the
[41:27] danger of taking your children and your
[41:29] wife in such a place
[41:31] the missionaries stood there and the
[41:33] young fellow and tears began to run down
[41:35] his chicks and they turn around and he
[41:38] says Brothers my vision of God's call he
[41:41] said if God called me to be in Africa my
[41:44] children and my family is more safe in
[41:47] Africa than in the play at any place in
[41:49] the world
[41:51] I was thinking about this and perhaps in
[41:54] an angle that will probably seem a
[41:56] little uh
[41:58] unconventional but I want to say this
[42:00] it's very important that we be where God
[42:03] called us to be
[42:04] her restaurant
[42:06] because that's the place of our
[42:08] protection
[42:09] it's very important as We Gather here we
[42:12] are sure within ourselves that I'm here
[42:14] because God put me here I'm here because
[42:17] God blessed me here because if that's
[42:20] not the case then there's a Wandering
[42:22] there's a questioning there's everything
[42:24] but this young missionary was sure
[42:26] within us says I'm here it says I would
[42:28] be at the place where God called me to
[42:31] be I'm a lot more safe why because you
[42:33] are useful there God will protect you
[42:36] there he will provide for you he will do
[42:38] all things and that's why when we got to
[42:40] hear it's within our heart we have sure
[42:43] that I'm here because God placed me here
[42:47] and he talks about even himself I
[42:49] thought perhaps in the same a long line
[42:52] of what I just read it said this isn't
[42:55] question and answer he says I was
[42:56] talking to a man this week a very
[42:58] prominent businessman in the city who
[43:00] said he talked to me about going back
[43:03] going back to uh into Africa and in in
[43:06] in in India he says why he says they've
[43:10] got uh they've got through killing a
[43:13] British general over there
[43:15] and I said what is God what has that got
[43:17] to do with me
[43:20] he said you're going back over there it
[43:24] says we are going over back over there
[43:26] where they are all murderers going on
[43:28] and the race riot and so forth I said
[43:32] sure that's where I'm needed for the
[43:35] Lord wants me to go
[43:37] he said what if what if they kill you I
[43:40] said well if God wants God wants me to
[43:44] be killed I'll just I'll just I'll just
[43:47] be killed that's all and they said Oh my
[43:50] he said you ought to think you ought to
[43:54] think on that well I don't care
[43:57] it says I think you are religious I
[43:59] think you are a good man he said but I
[44:01] think they would even it says they even
[44:04] killed Jesus Christ I said sure it was
[44:07] God's will
[44:08] he said what God's will he said that's
[44:12] what I've been that's what I've he says
[44:14] that man has been going to church
[44:17] close to 70.
[44:20] and he's been going to church he was in
[44:24] the Cradle rolled in the fine in fine
[44:27] churches in the city and they come up
[44:29] and they never known that it was God's
[44:32] will for Jesus to die
[44:36] oh my I just thought about it I said
[44:39] if we can only come to a place all we
[44:42] want is God's will to die from our own
[44:45] will our own desire our own uh Pursuit
[44:48] our own everything God all I want is to
[44:51] see your will unfolded in my life all I
[44:54] want to see is you expressing your will
[44:56] in my life and not my will
[44:58] amen I trust I just hope that will be a
[45:01] blessing to you it's just on my heart
[45:03] and I thought I would just read that
[45:05] before I can uh start tonight
[45:08] as we read in the scripture if I want to
[45:11] give a title this message this thought
[45:14] came into my heart from what we've been
[45:16] even our pastor has been preaching
[45:19] um and and I want to I was listening to
[45:22] a message I believe the title of it was
[45:24] time-tested Memorial
[45:27] and I wanted a title my thought
[45:30] Everlasting Memorial it just came to my
[45:32] heart and I want to go through it I'm
[45:34] not sure if we're going to finish it
[45:35] whenever time is up we'll just stop it
[45:38] says I was telling my brother Matthew in
[45:40] the back I said we already had the meal
[45:43] this uh this morning this is just
[45:44] dessert so I don't want to take too long
[45:47] I just want to make sure I get the the
[45:48] enough time of what I need so when
[45:51] Everlasting Memorial so when we talk
[45:53] about Memorial it speaks about it's
[45:55] something it's a structure or something
[45:58] established to remind people or a person
[46:01] of an event that transpired so it's
[46:04] something or is structure to help recall
[46:07] something to memory
[46:09] um
[46:11] it could be a monument it could be
[46:14] something uh you could uh oftentimes you
[46:17] can go places I remember uh we had you
[46:21] could you could look I we had the
[46:23] opportunity of being uh uh visiting
[46:26] Pearl Harbor me and my wife when we got
[46:28] married we went there on 4th of July uh
[46:31] to just see they have such a play you
[46:35] know they have uh veterans that went to
[46:38] war at that time they have modified
[46:40] aircraft that fought in that war and the
[46:43] whole Memorial places where the the
[46:45] ships were synced that never was pulled
[46:48] out they built a memorial on top where
[46:50] you could actually look and be able to
[46:52] see all of the structure there and and
[46:55] it's built in such a way when you go in
[46:57] by the time you go out it's it almost uh
[47:01] puts a mark on you you can never walk
[47:03] away and just forget about it then go
[47:05] your day because it reminds you of the
[47:07] name you see the names on the walls and
[47:10] of all the people that were are stuck in
[47:12] those ships and those that were killed
[47:14] and you see we have memorials everywhere
[47:17] streets names are named after memorials
[47:19] and places we have in Downtown Dallas
[47:22] you go you see where a memorial where
[47:25] John F Kennedy was killed in uh we've
[47:27] been in Washington DC you go and there's
[47:30] the Lincoln Memorial that stands there
[47:32] for you to look and you look across you
[47:34] see the George Washington Memorial all
[47:36] of those things I put in place for them
[47:38] to remind you of something that took
[47:41] place it's there to recall to memory
[47:43] because man uh has almost the nature to
[47:47] always keep forgetting things as they go
[47:50] by and they move along they forget they
[47:52] move along but yet those things are
[47:54] placed there for us to forget because
[47:56] once you forget you tend to always run
[47:59] into the same situations I believe they
[48:02] say that the people that never learns
[48:04] from history are bound to repeat the
[48:06] same thing if we don't learn about our
[48:08] mistakes we don't learn about the things
[48:09] that surround us if we don't pay
[48:12] attention and keep those things current
[48:14] though we are bound to come back and
[48:16] repeat those same exact mistakes and I
[48:19] want to say that as we see those
[48:20] memorials and all those things and I
[48:22] could say this tonight that those things
[48:25] are there but yet uh uh uh people have
[48:29] forgotten the very meanings of them even
[48:32] when they put their in front of them and
[48:34] we can talk about some memorials but
[48:36] Ronald speaks about the Egypts and the
[48:39] whole uh Caesars and the Romans and all
[48:41] of those I said some memorials that were
[48:43] built by human we found them under the
[48:46] ground 20 feet down
[48:48] in other words men's Memorial I never
[48:51] ever lasting they always built to be
[48:53] there for a certain amount of time
[48:55] regardless of how great they will build
[48:57] how great of an achievement and how that
[49:01] their messages wanted to be echoed it
[49:04] only has an expiration time the only
[49:06] living Memorial that lives forever is
[49:09] God's Memorial
[49:12] and andam says this he speaks it says
[49:16] and and he he speaks now this is in the
[49:20] message time tested Memorial in
[49:22] paragraph 17 he picks about uh uh
[49:28] you know
[49:31] yeah no not paragraph 17 but he speaks
[49:34] here he says now Memorial is a great
[49:37] things we appreciate memorials and many
[49:40] men it says in this life has tried to
[49:43] live behind uh behind behind them some
[49:47] sort of Memorial nearly all men love to
[49:50] do that
[49:51] it says they put on their graves a great
[49:55] marker that's right sure I love to do a
[49:58] it says I I sure they love to do that
[50:01] happen in the graveyard they make a
[50:03] great sign that's right I surely
[50:05] appreciate that that's okay it says then
[50:08] many tries to build the Great shrines it
[50:11] speaks about how they try to bring great
[50:14] shrines and all those things but yet
[50:16] those things are only temporal the only
[50:18] living Memorial that we know of is the
[50:21] Lord Jesus Christ I began to think you
[50:24] you could say well you know as
[50:26] Christians we also have a memorial we
[50:28] say we have the cross and we have the
[50:30] tomb but I want to put it into
[50:32] perspective I want to say this tonight
[50:34] the cross is only there for a
[50:37] remembrance for you to remember the
[50:39] sacrifice that was given the price that
[50:42] was paid for you and the tomb is an
[50:45] empty tomb it's there and it's empty to
[50:48] show you that there was resurrection
[50:49] that took place that the life that was
[50:51] was given is no longer in the Tomb but
[50:54] the life is Everlasting the life is
[50:57] living today and is living in the people
[51:00] the life is an everlasting life it can
[51:03] never die if you go back and you look at
[51:05] the memorials of all those people
[51:07] including the Pharaohs you will go
[51:09] you'll find that there's such a tomb but
[51:12] yet within the tomb you'll find that the
[51:13] body is in there the only tomb that has
[51:16] nobody included where you can go and the
[51:19] body is disappear is the Lord Jesus
[51:21] Christ why because it's a memorial of
[51:25] God trying to show that heaven and earth
[51:27] will pass away all men's Memorial will
[51:30] pass away the only Everlasting Memorial
[51:33] that will save forever is the Lord Jesus
[51:36] Christ and what he promised you will
[51:38] come to pass
[51:41] now he speaks about this atheists in
[51:44] Ohio a man who came and he was against
[51:47] Christianity he called himself he was a
[51:50] modern science uh person and and in
[51:53] Infidel who said that uh he didn't
[51:56] believe he says away with a or with a
[51:59] with a word and he says and he wanted he
[52:03] believed in in modern science but when
[52:06] he died he said that that that if I die
[52:09] that they should build the memorial of
[52:12] him having his foot on the Bible and and
[52:14] and things like that to show his
[52:16] unbelief that the word was not true and
[52:19] and and he says but when it says in
[52:21] modern science and when he was dying he
[52:23] says uh if I've been wrong serpent
[52:26] should will crawl out of my grave
[52:29] oh my man is calling himself damnation
[52:32] upon himself not even knowing almost
[52:35] like the children of Israel said let his
[52:37] blood be upon us in our children not
[52:39] understanding that they're bringing the
[52:41] prophecy to come to pass for themselves
[52:44] oh that's why it's so careful that we we
[52:47] be careful with the things that we say
[52:49] the things that we are well because we
[52:51] are bringing damnation to ourselves and
[52:53] he says and when he was dying it says
[52:55] that if I've been wrong that certain
[52:57] should crawl out of my grave and when I
[52:59] die that they should it says it says
[53:02] they were still shovering out dirts of
[53:05] the grave and they killed two or three
[53:07] big vipers and today in the grave and
[53:10] minister is taking a picture recently
[53:12] and brought it and showed me he says
[53:14] hanging over the chains around his lot
[53:17] his grave a beautiful place it says but
[53:21] his mouth is nothing but a snake Mount
[53:24] and nothing it says and no matter no
[53:27] matter even if it falls in Winter
[53:29] certain still crawls in the grave
[53:32] immemorial God forbid ever a memorial
[53:36] like this for any of you oh my brother
[53:40] my sister this word is true the memorial
[53:43] of God is a true Memorial and what makes
[53:46] it a true Memorial is when he died he
[53:50] died so his grace could be extended so
[53:52] his healing could be extended so all of
[53:55] the provision that he had in his book
[53:57] could be extended and today we today we
[53:59] are sitting here as benefactors of his
[54:02] memorial of what he died for and we can
[54:05] say his healing is true why because
[54:08] we've experienced it we can say his
[54:10] salvation is true why because we've
[54:12] tasted of it we can say his Deliverance
[54:15] is true why because what he died for his
[54:18] memorial is alive in us today
[54:21] oh we live by the grace of God the
[54:23] scripture will tell us not by anything
[54:25] we've achieved not by what we could do
[54:27] not but what we can say but the grace of
[54:30] God manifesting itself saving us
[54:33] bringing us out of the world and
[54:35] providing for us to be alive today and
[54:38] to live to testify of the things of God
[54:40] what a memorial what is your Memorial my
[54:43] Memorial is I want my life to testify of
[54:46] Jesus Christ of his greatness and his
[54:49] goodness towards the world it was given
[54:51] to me not for me to keep but to live as
[54:54] a memorial to the world so that they may
[54:57] know that Jesus Christ is the same
[54:58] yesterday today and forever now the
[55:00] scriptures
[55:02] speaks in Romans it says and and I'll
[55:04] read this it says Romans chapter 3 it
[55:07] says for what advantage sent out the
[55:09] Jews and profit in there of circumcision
[55:12] he says much ever made
[55:15] much it says much every way chiefly it
[55:19] says and because unto them we're
[55:22] committed the Oracles of God for what if
[55:24] some did not believe it says then shall
[55:29] the unbelief make the faith of God
[55:31] without a fact all but in verse 5 verse
[55:34] 4 it says God forbid yeah let God be
[55:37] true but let every man be a liar as it
[55:40] is written oh my brother my sister the
[55:43] unbeliever doesn't make the world of God
[55:45] unsure though make-believer doesn't make
[55:48] the world of God untrue all they're
[55:50] doing is they're testifying of the truth
[55:52] of God that only him that God calls will
[55:56] come all they're doing is the testifying
[55:58] of the truth that he already said in the
[56:01] beginning that only my children my ship
[56:04] will hear my voice another they will not
[56:06] follow they will fall after all of these
[56:08] things but my children will come to me
[56:10] all they're doing is testifying that
[56:13] they were they didn't have it in in them
[56:15] to begin with they didn't have the seed
[56:17] to believe with and only those that were
[56:19] born of the uncorruptable seed will hear
[56:22] the word of God and believe it
[56:24] and he says
[56:26] speaks about the the character of man
[56:29] and I want to say this it's very
[56:31] important to realize and to come to a
[56:34] place where we are here building a
[56:37] memorial
[56:39] we are not here as individual people
[56:43] doing their own things where we just
[56:46] come together and we rejoice and then we
[56:48] go home no but we are here building a
[56:52] memorial
[56:52] God is building a spiritual house and
[56:56] every part of us every one of us is a
[56:59] stone that's going to go in this living
[57:02] Memorial is a stone that's going to be
[57:04] part of this great building and I don't
[57:07] know if we'll have time to get to it he
[57:09] talks about the Temple of Solomon how
[57:12] that the parts of the temples were built
[57:15] all across the world they were shaped
[57:18] and they were cut and they were put into
[57:20] pieces and it was brought together and
[57:23] in the end time the only thing that was
[57:25] needed was just the blessing of the
[57:27] stone he says there was not a best of
[57:29] the soul that was going by why because
[57:31] those stones were cut off to be so it's
[57:34] such a specific form and everything that
[57:37] each one had a place in the building
[57:41] you you have to come to a place that
[57:43] says I'm a stone
[57:45] I I you know I wanted to give the title
[57:47] of my sermon tonight A Lively Stone in
[57:52] God's Building I'm a stone I'm part of
[57:54] this Stone I'm part of this Lively
[57:56] bleeding that God is building and
[57:58] everything that's coming into your life
[58:00] everything that's happening to you it's
[58:03] God shaping you so you can get to be and
[58:06] feed a place that he has for you
[58:08] don't never discourage like her brother
[58:11] said this morning don't ever look at
[58:12] yourself it says war is me why am I
[58:15] going through this God doesn't love me
[58:17] he's forgotten about me he's only
[58:19] touching those as a spiritual you know
[58:21] no God doesn't have favoritism
[58:26] and I want to even say this God is not a
[58:29] Maverick who just works and does things
[58:31] on himself God is a family man he
[58:34] worries about his children to make sure
[58:36] the well he gives all that he has so
[58:38] they can do he functions within the body
[58:41] he doesn't have this one do what they
[58:43] want over here that one just do that one
[58:46] says I'm not part I'm not interested
[58:48] I'll just come and participate no it the
[58:51] scripture says he will leave the 99 and
[58:54] go after one
[58:56] true
[58:58] sorry I just got carried away
[59:02] so it's
[59:03] this car right there says
[59:07] character is made known by his works
[59:11] it says whatever you are your Works
[59:14] prove what you are it says no matter how
[59:17] much you testify whatever you say prose
[59:21] con it says that has nothing to do with
[59:23] it
[59:24] oh my we talk big we we have a big
[59:28] presentation we say so much but yet we
[59:31] forget that that has nothing to do with
[59:33] it it's what we do
[59:36] last one
[59:38] it's what we do we the understanding
[59:41] that I am a stone part of a building I
[59:45] am here to be shaped to be put into a
[59:48] form so that I can fit God's Building
[59:50] the memorial is not your Memorial the
[59:54] memorial is God's Memorial and whatever
[59:56] he chooses to bring out of you I'm
[59:59] saying God bring it out of me
[1:00:03] he says it's not what you said nothing
[1:00:06] if you could put that on the board but I
[1:00:08] would appreciate it it says it has
[1:00:10] nothing to do with what you uh it has
[1:00:14] nothing to do with it it says your Works
[1:00:18] tells what you are tell us what you are
[1:00:22] inside every job that you do manifested
[1:00:26] what you are it says a new businessman
[1:00:29] it says if you just do a a patched up
[1:00:33] job and see and see what I mean it says
[1:00:36] just a halfway job I he says it says
[1:00:39] don't do that if you can't do it right
[1:00:42] don't do it at all
[1:00:45] that's right when you come to Christ if
[1:00:48] you can't absolutely sell uh sell out
[1:00:52] and Lock Stock and Barrel it says don't
[1:00:54] come to Christ
[1:00:56] don't come at all it says but when you
[1:00:59] really when you really want to be a
[1:01:02] Christian stand out
[1:01:05] oh my friend and my says he didn't say
[1:01:08] fit in he says stand out why because God
[1:01:11] didn't make us to be a bunch of stones
[1:01:13] that are exactly the same that talks the
[1:01:16] same way walks the same way no he's made
[1:01:19] us to be an expression of himself and as
[1:01:21] an expression himself it's him that
[1:01:24] gives the expression
[1:01:26] it's not your own expression you are
[1:01:29] expressing a part of him oh I so love it
[1:01:32] when I see ministers perhaps from
[1:01:34] overseas or different places that even
[1:01:36] in our midst or a pastor in everyone you
[1:01:38] can see it's the same word of God but
[1:01:41] because of the way God has built the
[1:01:43] vessel because of the way the
[1:01:45] experiences and the things that the
[1:01:46] vessel has gone through you can see how
[1:01:49] that God is molding The Vessel and
[1:01:51] bringing the same word that you've been
[1:01:53] hearing it but yet this sounds just he
[1:01:55] just has something about it why because
[1:01:57] it's the same God it's the same word but
[1:02:00] yet the expression he brings the
[1:02:03] expression
[1:02:04] all right there
[1:02:08] he says when you come to Christ
[1:02:12] you don't absolute you if if you can
[1:02:15] absolutely sell out Lock Stock and
[1:02:18] Barrel don't come to Christ
[1:02:20] don't come at all but when you really
[1:02:23] want to be a Christian he says Stand Out
[1:02:25] make it real
[1:02:27] it says that's what God wants God wants
[1:02:31] you to be that's all to prove it says
[1:02:33] your work will prove your character what
[1:02:37] your character is your character is
[1:02:39] known by The Works that you do
[1:02:44] oh my
[1:02:46] I thought my character is going to be
[1:02:48] made by what I say no by The Works that
[1:02:52] you do
[1:02:53] you know as Son of God
[1:02:56] or a dog when he has a son
[1:02:58] it's a dog
[1:03:00] it doesn't work up and see well I'll
[1:03:02] learn to be a dog today or a cat learns
[1:03:06] and says okay I'm a cat and I need to
[1:03:08] find out what cats do
[1:03:10] and sometimes I feel like as Christians
[1:03:12] sometimes that's how we act we try to
[1:03:15] find what is the Son of God do what is
[1:03:16] the son no it's within you it's whatever
[1:03:19] your desire is it's whatever bits within
[1:03:22] your heart that's why when we heard this
[1:03:24] message it was something that you but
[1:03:27] when it says something like when you
[1:03:29] heard it it's something like you always
[1:03:31] wanted to be
[1:03:34] it's something that sounded something
[1:03:37] that you always wanted to be it sounded
[1:03:40] you said I like that it says it was you
[1:03:42] looking at yourself in the mirror it
[1:03:44] said they talked about things and said I
[1:03:47] want that I want that and pretty soon
[1:03:49] you find out that while it was not even
[1:03:51] about the mirror he's talking about
[1:03:52] yourself
[1:03:57] now uh in in this message but when I'm
[1:04:02] it talks about if I can put it in
[1:04:05] categories perhaps for the sake of time
[1:04:07] he talks about two separate types of
[1:04:10] memorials
[1:04:11] he talks about two separate types of
[1:04:14] memorials now the first one and he talks
[1:04:16] about is Joshua memorials and I want you
[1:04:19] to think about this for a time now here
[1:04:22] is the children of Israel they have come
[1:04:24] from Egypt and now they are in at the
[1:04:27] doorstep of the promised land for them
[1:04:29] to cross now I want to remind you that
[1:04:33] the group that was standing there at the
[1:04:35] doorstep they had they as far as they
[1:04:38] are concerned crossing the Red Sea was
[1:04:41] only a story that they heard
[1:04:44] all right because they were born in the
[1:04:46] wilderness
[1:04:48] because the generation came out
[1:04:51] because of the unbelief to cross over
[1:04:54] God said they will go around it will
[1:04:57] finish them off now this is a place if
[1:04:59] you go read it says it was only supposed
[1:05:01] to take 11 days for them to cross over
[1:05:03] but yet they were here for 40 40 years
[1:05:07] why because God wanted a new generation
[1:05:10] in fact when they went into the land and
[1:05:13] they they take uh they went and they
[1:05:15] took off the the the goods of the land
[1:05:18] and they brought back those that refused
[1:05:20] to go he says that they will never cross
[1:05:22] it says that it was going to kill all
[1:05:24] that generation but a new generation was
[1:05:26] going to go in so as far as they know
[1:05:29] and I want you to think about Joshua
[1:05:31] here he is and and the young man just
[1:05:34] been raised up and all that they knew
[1:05:36] was Moses and Moses think about the
[1:05:39] pressure that was upon him now it has to
[1:05:41] be in charge and God is comforting him
[1:05:44] in Joshua 1 it says I will be with you
[1:05:46] fear not then the same way I was with
[1:05:49] Moses I'll be with you and all of that
[1:05:51] now he has to go in front of the people
[1:05:53] and talk to them and assure them that
[1:05:56] the same God that was with Moses was
[1:05:58] going to be with him
[1:06:00] so now I want you to think about this
[1:06:02] generation that that came out of the
[1:06:05] Wilderness I'm sorry I came out of Egypt
[1:06:08] that God and what God was dealing with
[1:06:10] him we understand by the Scripture it
[1:06:14] was a mixed multitude generation it was
[1:06:16] a mixed magnitude group of people and
[1:06:19] they came when they came out it was a
[1:06:22] generation if you excuse me the
[1:06:23] expression that had what I will call A
[1:06:27] wilderness mentality that God had to get
[1:06:29] out of them
[1:06:31] all they did is they were reminiscing of
[1:06:34] the things that happened in Egypt
[1:06:36] oh do you remember them garlic and do
[1:06:39] you remember that time and do you
[1:06:41] remember them onions do you remember
[1:06:43] this and do you remember they're
[1:06:45] forgetting about all that their trials
[1:06:47] and everything and all the the the the
[1:06:49] the bondage that they were in there were
[1:06:52] a generation when anything anytime
[1:06:55] Whenever there was just a disruption
[1:06:58] they turned right away and began to talk
[1:07:00] about the old
[1:07:02] now I want you to think because I want
[1:07:04] to come down to us I tell you my brother
[1:07:06] my sister it's not going to help us to
[1:07:09] talk about God just a god of history of
[1:07:12] what he'd done and and how great that he
[1:07:14] was with our father even including
[1:07:16] ourselves do you remember when you were
[1:07:18] saved how glorious that was well if
[1:07:20] that's not the same as today if today is
[1:07:23] not greater than yesterday you're
[1:07:25] missing something
[1:07:29] because it's the same God now there were
[1:07:32] those that were part of that that never
[1:07:34] knew what it means with the heard about
[1:07:37] the testimonies of what God did at the
[1:07:39] right sea and everything now God is
[1:07:42] taking them into the promised land but
[1:07:44] he had to do something new for them
[1:07:48] he comes and
[1:07:52] they came and they came at the upon at
[1:07:54] the doorstep remember I said Lively
[1:07:56] Stone
[1:07:58] and he gives them
[1:07:59] a perfect way for them to move it says
[1:08:03] that I want you to send the priest with
[1:08:05] a Ark of the Covenant first the priest
[1:08:09] takes the ark and then begin to walk and
[1:08:11] and as they walk the scripture says when
[1:08:14] the feet get into the water
[1:08:16] now when you go read you'll hear that
[1:08:20] they went to the River Jordan when they
[1:08:22] went to Jordan it was the time where it
[1:08:25] was overflowing
[1:08:28] but one of them says they must have gone
[1:08:30] at the wrong time
[1:08:33] I want you to think about that you'll
[1:08:35] get there
[1:08:36] and the river is all flooded
[1:08:39] when there are seasons where it's a
[1:08:41] little bit lower but you show up at the
[1:08:44] season when it's over flooded
[1:08:49] now they could have looked at it and
[1:08:51] said well you know what this is not the
[1:08:53] time let's go back but the word of the
[1:08:55] Lord had gone before them and that's
[1:08:58] what I want as if this tonight we could
[1:09:00] just capture this I feel like I'll just
[1:09:02] it will just help us tonight now it's
[1:09:05] important we as the children of God when
[1:09:08] we sit here you have to know that you
[1:09:10] are not here by your own thinking the
[1:09:13] word went before you before you could be
[1:09:15] here the word had to come out of God's
[1:09:18] mouth he had to pronounce it he had to
[1:09:21] have said it he have to have promised it
[1:09:23] he have to have projected it then if you
[1:09:26] go by the strength of what he protected
[1:09:28] nothing will stop on your way
[1:09:32] if you go by your own thinking you're
[1:09:34] gonna drown if you just go because
[1:09:37] everybody else is going you're not gonna
[1:09:39] make it
[1:09:41] so now they come
[1:09:44] and the priests get into the watering
[1:09:49] and now as the Crossing
[1:09:51] Joshua tells them he says now
[1:09:54] out of the 12 tribes I want each tribe
[1:09:57] each person from each tribe a
[1:10:00] representative of all of them that they
[1:10:02] come and come into the very depths of
[1:10:05] the the river when God had dried it up
[1:10:08] that they will pick up each one a stone
[1:10:10] and take it over they came and they pick
[1:10:13] up a stone one pick up a stone and for
[1:10:16] each tribe and they took and it says all
[1:10:17] about a thousand to two thousand uh two
[1:10:21] a million to two million they're all
[1:10:23] crossed and they went and they took it
[1:10:25] to the place where they're gonna rest
[1:10:28] and this God said they said now I want
[1:10:31] you to build the memorial with these
[1:10:33] Stones I want you to stack them up and
[1:10:35] build a memorial it says when your
[1:10:38] children will ask you that you will tell
[1:10:40] them what the Lord had done
[1:10:45] now I want you to take
[1:10:51] moving in the time where things seem to
[1:10:53] be impossible
[1:10:55] this is God moving at the season where
[1:10:58] it seems like we're never going to get
[1:10:59] out of this situation
[1:11:01] this is God having moved in your life at
[1:11:05] the time where you thought this was the
[1:11:06] end of me
[1:11:08] it says God moving at a time where you
[1:11:10] knew within yourself that I'm done this
[1:11:13] is the end of me but yet it's moving and
[1:11:17] then within the movement he's giving you
[1:11:19] a stone for you to carry a revelation
[1:11:22] for you to carry out and use that
[1:11:24] Revelation for you to talk to your
[1:11:26] children about
[1:11:28] oh my brother my sister God is not built
[1:11:31] upon just teaching where we can come and
[1:11:34] teach each and everyone God is a savior
[1:11:36] God Is A Healer God is this and God is
[1:11:39] this and says go on and be fine no God
[1:11:42] wants to give you a stone for yourself
[1:11:44] he wants you to build the memorial
[1:11:46] within yourself where you can come up
[1:11:49] here or where you can go anywhere stand
[1:11:52] there and say I'm not just talking about
[1:11:54] this Bible but I'm here to let you know
[1:11:56] that this Bible became this person in
[1:11:59] other words what he said in here he did
[1:12:01] it here
[1:12:03] that's why
[1:12:04] a living Memorial that's why I said all
[1:12:07] the other memorials where are they
[1:12:09] they're in the ground the only living
[1:12:11] Memorial that stood up that men could
[1:12:14] never take away was the Lord Jesus
[1:12:16] Christ and how did they live he says
[1:12:18] because I live you shall live also
[1:12:25] you are that Memorial that God is
[1:12:27] building
[1:12:28] so he takes them and he takes the stone
[1:12:30] and and they build it and I began to
[1:12:33] think about Peter when he said he said
[1:12:35] who do men say that I am
[1:12:38] now those that came out of wilderness
[1:12:40] that came out of Egypt when they came
[1:12:42] when they were there it says who the men
[1:12:44] said they could have said well you know
[1:12:46] what I was born in the wilderness my
[1:12:48] parent told me about how we crossed the
[1:12:50] Red Sea
[1:12:51] they said my parents told me how that
[1:12:53] God opened up the Red Sea and it was he
[1:12:56] tried it up he blocked it on both sides
[1:12:58] and we were able to walk my parents and
[1:13:01] everyone was able to walk on dry land
[1:13:04] and they came in and that's how we come
[1:13:06] here
[1:13:06] but you see that was not good enough and
[1:13:09] then it says what do you say that I am
[1:13:11] that was this parent Stone what is your
[1:13:14] stone
[1:13:15] come on what is your stone tonight
[1:13:18] God is not but when I'm telling says God
[1:13:21] doesn't have grandchildren he's not
[1:13:23] interested for us to tell the story over
[1:13:26] and over and over so he becomes good
[1:13:28] nurse no he the reason for the story he
[1:13:32] saw that the ones that hears it seeks
[1:13:34] his own experience and experience the
[1:13:36] same God in the same power
[1:13:42] and that's why when we come together
[1:13:44] when we talk about these things it's not
[1:13:47] so much we it says lifting God in out of
[1:13:51] History lifting him up out of whatever
[1:13:53] he's done and bringing him into your
[1:13:56] situation bringing him into your problem
[1:13:59] where you are to bring you to the
[1:14:02] understanding that the same God is here
[1:14:04] to do the same thing
[1:14:12] a new generation I came across
[1:14:16] my my
[1:14:18] the Wilderness the Wilderness mentality
[1:14:22] my they could talk
[1:14:24] about the great God
[1:14:26] yeah and in fact
[1:14:28] on the testimony on the sea
[1:14:31] he says that we'll talk and it will sit
[1:14:33] there in the beginning of the dog it
[1:14:34] says what done it for you he says my
[1:14:37] mother told me about God the god of our
[1:14:39] father in the Old Testament how did he
[1:14:42] Reign Mana from heaven and it says I
[1:14:45] asked him I said well how did he do it
[1:14:47] does it mean Jehovah has oven up there
[1:14:50] and and things up there how did he do
[1:14:53] even in the New Testament when he took
[1:14:54] bread he said does it mean he has often
[1:14:57] out their way he would take the bread
[1:14:59] and bake it and then cut it down and run
[1:15:01] it down he said no Jehovah is a creator
[1:15:05] what was he doing he was building
[1:15:07] memorial but as they begin to tell those
[1:15:09] testimonies he says I heard what my
[1:15:12] parents says but when I saw him do it
[1:15:14] when I saw it with my own ass that
[1:15:17] settles it and my brother my sister
[1:15:19] don't settle on the stories
[1:15:22] don't settle on the stories don't settle
[1:15:25] on what this one says that one says
[1:15:27] that's wonderful to to comfort you but
[1:15:30] let that story becomes a reality for you
[1:15:35] without that we're just building up
[1:15:38] building up our own houses we're
[1:15:40] building up our own memorial the
[1:15:42] memorial of God is built by individuals
[1:15:45] that God himself has touched
[1:15:47] that's why the prophet could say it says
[1:15:49] what is the the the what is the new
[1:15:52] birth he says it's Jesus Christ reveal
[1:15:56] himself to you personally
[1:15:59] why because then he becomes a memorial
[1:16:02] you know we could have received what we
[1:16:04] deserved we could have received what we
[1:16:07] deserve but oh God is rich in Mercy he
[1:16:10] came even when you were in your sin when
[1:16:13] you knew if we right now for everything
[1:16:15] I've done I deserve to die when you knew
[1:16:18] within yourself that I don't deserve
[1:16:20] anything good but yet for his goodness
[1:16:25] but why did he do that
[1:16:27] I become a slave of his goodness
[1:16:31] it doesn't matter how down somebody is
[1:16:34] because I'm slave to his goodness all I
[1:16:38] could do is tell of his goodness you
[1:16:40] know you don't have to be like that
[1:16:42] you're like oh you don't understand my
[1:16:44] situation I'm worse off I'm gone and
[1:16:46] everything it says well I was gone too
[1:16:48] but I met a god but I met someone who
[1:16:51] can take you out of your situation I met
[1:16:53] somebody who can stabilize you I meant
[1:16:55] someone who can come and take all of
[1:16:57] your mess all that you've messed up
[1:17:00] everything that you've destroyed he
[1:17:02] takes all of that and he makes sense of
[1:17:04] it
[1:17:17] now
[1:17:18] I want you to realize
[1:17:22] this Memorial
[1:17:25] of Joshua
[1:17:28] was not built
[1:17:31] when everything was come
[1:17:34] and peaceful and nice
[1:17:38] Where the River Jordan was all the way
[1:17:40] down
[1:17:41] no
[1:17:42] when it was overflooded
[1:17:48] Our Testimony is it's not something well
[1:17:51] you know one day I was just asleep and
[1:17:53] and then I just woke up and the sun rose
[1:17:56] up just a different way
[1:17:58] anyway was shining on the trees it just
[1:18:01] seemed a little different then I knew
[1:18:03] God was calling me you were running
[1:18:07] you were running you were trying to hide
[1:18:09] he was a hunting for you it was hunting
[1:18:12] for you in fact he made your life so
[1:18:15] miserable you looked you said God I come
[1:18:18] he kept dragging you after whatever hold
[1:18:20] you were in
[1:18:22] already
[1:18:25] I I hear testimonies even myself I
[1:18:28] remember I said if I don't do this I'm
[1:18:31] gonna die invite the next word that
[1:18:33] comes out of your mouth is death you're
[1:18:35] like I don't even understand what I'm
[1:18:37] saying but that's what he had to do
[1:18:41] it's not you you've studied a Bible and
[1:18:45] you've come to some conclusion that
[1:18:47] Jesus Christ is the Son of God then I'll
[1:18:49] give my life to you there have been
[1:18:51] people baptized in the midnight one a.m
[1:18:54] 2 A.M in the morning what's wrong God is
[1:18:57] moving upon them
[1:19:01] and that same God is here the same
[1:19:04] brother as well sister I'm not talking
[1:19:06] about this so we can just say praise God
[1:19:08] for the past I want us to build a
[1:19:10] memorial within our own self to come to
[1:19:13] the place as we heard it this morning
[1:19:14] where our hearts is on fire when we come
[1:19:17] to a place it says I want every day that
[1:19:20] I walk up the same manifestation of this
[1:19:23] God of what he did what he promised I
[1:19:26] want my life to be a memorial of those
[1:19:28] things
[1:19:32] not the messenger of Doom and Gloom
[1:19:35] not one that can perpetrate whatever is
[1:19:38] happening in the world
[1:19:39] you know in this book brother Barnum
[1:19:41] talks about having visited I believe it
[1:19:43] was New York it says he went on the
[1:19:45] Statue of Liberty and he says there was
[1:19:48] a lie there was there had been a storm
[1:19:50] and then he says but yet there was a
[1:19:52] bunch of dead Sparrow all across and he
[1:19:55] couldn't understand he asked what
[1:19:56] happened it says well what happened is
[1:19:59] there was a light when the storm came
[1:20:02] instead of the sparrow used the light
[1:20:05] for them to go hide The Sparrows were
[1:20:08] trying to put out the light so they keep
[1:20:10] beating themselves against the light
[1:20:12] until they're dead
[1:20:15] you can fight the word of God and
[1:20:18] survive people that criticize this they
[1:20:21] don't know what they're criticizing it's
[1:20:22] not made for them it says that he says
[1:20:25] he baby came insane
[1:20:28] now if someone all they put all of their
[1:20:32] efforts
[1:20:33] they have nothing else to do
[1:20:36] they sit there they just read the
[1:20:38] message read the message so they can
[1:20:40] find mistakes that's saying to him for
[1:20:42] Insanity to me
[1:20:46] all they do is trust trying to find what
[1:20:49] letter what scripture what word is not
[1:20:51] matching with that that's Insanity see
[1:20:54] to them it's insanity but towards his
[1:20:56] life why because we've seen the same
[1:20:59] thing happening with us
[1:21:03] he says in Joshua 24 verse 13 and it
[1:21:07] says and I have given you land which I
[1:21:10] had not labored oh I love this
[1:21:15] he says I have given you lamb land which
[1:21:19] thou did not labor and cities ye that
[1:21:22] that ye built not and ye dwelled in them
[1:21:26] and the vineyard and and Olive yard
[1:21:30] which that he had not planted yet not
[1:21:33] did not uh the which he planned it not
[1:21:37] that did eat it says now therefore fear
[1:21:40] the lord and serve him in sincerity in
[1:21:43] church and put away the gods which your
[1:21:46] father served on the other side of the
[1:21:49] flood
[1:21:50] in Egypt and serve the Lord
[1:21:54] in Deuteronomy 6 and 10 it says and it
[1:21:58] shall be that when the Lord thy God
[1:22:01] shall have brought you brought thee into
[1:22:03] the land which you swear unto thy father
[1:22:06] to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give thee
[1:22:09] this great goodly land the goodly cities
[1:22:12] which thou build us not and a house full
[1:22:16] of good things which thou fill it not
[1:22:20] and and Wells digged which thou digest
[1:22:24] not Vineyard an olive tree which thou
[1:22:28] plenteth not
[1:22:30] it says when thou have eaten
[1:22:33] and be full
[1:22:35] then be where beware lest thou forget
[1:22:38] the Lord
[1:22:39] which brought thee forth out of the land
[1:22:42] of Egypt
[1:22:44] from the house of bondage
[1:22:46] what a promise
[1:22:48] houses we did not build
[1:22:51] Vineyard we did not plant
[1:22:54] what was it it was exactly what he
[1:22:57] promised that he would give them a land
[1:23:00] filled with milk and honey
[1:23:03] God himself promised that it was going
[1:23:05] to give them for the sake of time I'll
[1:23:07] just move on
[1:23:10] says
[1:23:16] he speaks about
[1:23:22] he says in Joshua now
[1:23:25] his word was at stake
[1:23:28] paragraph 21
[1:23:31] just as Noah of old but Joshua
[1:23:36] must cross over this River
[1:23:39] and he looked like he picked the worst
[1:23:42] time that he could ever that could it
[1:23:44] could ever be
[1:23:45] that he could that it could ever be
[1:23:47] taught
[1:23:49] it was in the month of April and that's
[1:23:52] when the snow was melting in Judea
[1:23:55] coming down through the mountain and the
[1:23:59] old Jordan is Muddy and spread
[1:24:03] Plumbing out into it says into the field
[1:24:07] water filled
[1:24:09] of Jordan and you look like if it would
[1:24:13] have been the if it would have been if
[1:24:15] it would have been the mathematical of
[1:24:17] of Education or scientist he picked the
[1:24:21] worst time
[1:24:23] in all the years to cross in all the
[1:24:25] years across Jordan but God likes to
[1:24:28] take those kind of time to prove that is
[1:24:31] God
[1:24:33] foreign
[1:24:37] is built on God proving that is God
[1:24:43] it's not built upon you when you have
[1:24:46] worked so hard and then finally figured
[1:24:48] it out
[1:24:50] it's built on you looking and said
[1:24:53] I have ran out of all that I could do I
[1:24:56] have done all that I could it looks like
[1:24:58] it never worked then something happened
[1:25:01] you know for a fact that God did this
[1:25:05] it says and when man of God who believed
[1:25:07] God
[1:25:09] and know what God had promised has
[1:25:11] promised he's not afraid to do it
[1:25:14] because God will God will stick with his
[1:25:18] word just as certain as he is God
[1:25:21] and it says paragraph 22 and he says and
[1:25:24] when he said first take to your can go
[1:25:27] forward
[1:25:28] and when those priests feet touched that
[1:25:32] Jordan no matter how Wild she was
[1:25:35] and how she was swelling
[1:25:39] it would give way to God's Eternal Word
[1:25:43] it says for the word is in is in the ark
[1:25:46] Jesus says now Heaven and Earth will
[1:25:49] pass away but my word will never pass
[1:25:51] away so Joshua knowing that his word
[1:25:54] must rest upon God's word
[1:25:59] that's the secret his word must rest
[1:26:03] upon God's word and he put God's word
[1:26:06] first
[1:26:07] oh it says wish you sick people here
[1:26:10] tonight we'll do that put God's word
[1:26:13] with your confession put your confession
[1:26:16] it says you believe it and set it out
[1:26:19] there and call those things which are
[1:26:22] not as though they were when you are my
[1:26:25] it says then March then we are Marching
[1:26:28] on do it do it that way God's word will
[1:26:32] take you through
[1:26:35] it's not us making it through
[1:26:37] and I want to say this
[1:26:40] why it has to be the word of God
[1:26:43] because the word
[1:26:45] knows things that are to be
[1:26:51] because the word knows what's before
[1:26:53] what's to come remember but Matthew
[1:26:57] mentioned it this morning
[1:26:58] the the characteristic of the Prophet is
[1:27:01] a Seer is one who can see what's around
[1:27:03] the corner you can't he sees what's
[1:27:06] around the corner and therefore God's
[1:27:09] empowers him to give his people his word
[1:27:11] that the word that they believe will
[1:27:14] tell them ahead of time before the
[1:27:16] corner comes what's going to come around
[1:27:18] the corner my brother my sister we know
[1:27:21] what's around the corner we know what to
[1:27:23] expect that's going to happen in the
[1:27:25] world we know all of that and as far as
[1:27:27] the Bride of Jesus Christ we know what's
[1:27:28] around the corner we know that the
[1:27:30] Rapture will be here any minute
[1:27:33] we know the adoptions of sun is
[1:27:35] happening right now we know that's
[1:27:37] what's around the corner we don't have
[1:27:39] to worry about anything as long as it's
[1:27:41] God's word God will stand upon his word
[1:27:44] but what I'm says in this message the
[1:27:46] memorial it says oh let me just jump
[1:27:48] ahead because of time he talks about
[1:27:50] this young man from England who as well
[1:27:52] to build a bridge he talks about him it
[1:27:54] says now he came when when something
[1:27:57] that everybody had rejected was afraid
[1:28:00] to do he took it he says why because he
[1:28:03] had a reputation and he put his
[1:28:05] reputation on the line he says there are
[1:28:08] two things that were needed he had a
[1:28:10] reputation and he had a vision
[1:28:13] reputation and vision in other words
[1:28:16] Vision he can see before the bridge
[1:28:19] could be built how everything was going
[1:28:20] to lay out he had a purpose in doing
[1:28:22] that and whatever says that the same way
[1:28:25] that Jesus Christ when he came if he can
[1:28:27] if he didn't have a vision if he didn't
[1:28:30] know what somewhere in the corner if he
[1:28:32] cannot perform that which he has said
[1:28:34] then God is not God
[1:28:37] then his reputation is on the line
[1:28:40] he comes this young man he says oh I
[1:28:44] love it it says one place it says it
[1:28:46] came and he put his reputation and says
[1:28:48] they said well people from America great
[1:28:51] Engineers great Architects they've
[1:28:53] received this job he says but I will
[1:28:54] take it
[1:28:56] he came in
[1:28:58] he went the same place that they all
[1:29:00] went
[1:29:01] that he examined the river he looks at
[1:29:04] it and looked at it and said they all
[1:29:06] went to the same place they went down
[1:29:09] what they saw was sinned but what about
[1:29:12] him says he knew the way that God
[1:29:15] designed the Earth that underneath that
[1:29:17] sand there had to be a rock somewhere my
[1:29:20] father my sister he knew you that I
[1:29:24] don't care how much Cinder is if I
[1:29:27] continue to pump this sand out one day
[1:29:29] I'm gonna hit the rock somewhere in the
[1:29:31] bottle that's the same way it is with
[1:29:33] this message my word of my sister it's
[1:29:35] not built upon the shifting Sins Of Man
[1:29:37] the understanding of van or this or this
[1:29:39] that if you weren't in the Bible if you
[1:29:42] went and read it one day God is going to
[1:29:44] reveal it to yourself you're going to
[1:29:46] hit a rock and once you hit a rock you
[1:29:49] are stabilized forever
[1:29:53] people are built upon sayings
[1:29:55] explanations of man and they heard this
[1:29:58] greater art all right now believe all I
[1:30:00] must be here they're headed over here
[1:30:02] that must be in but remember the church
[1:30:04] is not built upon men's understanding
[1:30:07] when he looked at Peter he says up on
[1:30:09] this rock it it's always the rock it was
[1:30:12] the Rocket Jordan it was The Rock in the
[1:30:15] time of Jesus it's a rock in the same
[1:30:17] time
[1:30:19] behold I lay a rock a stumbling block
[1:30:22] and a rock of offense he was not
[1:30:25] offended in me he who believes that it
[1:30:27] is Upon This Rock what's a rock God
[1:30:30] choosing a man to reveal his word
[1:30:33] God using a man that he can come in this
[1:30:37] generation and turn his back against the
[1:30:39] audience and be accepted what is that
[1:30:41] that's the rock the Revelation is I
[1:30:44] looked at the man but I saw Jesus being
[1:30:47] manifested
[1:30:49] foreign
[1:30:50] the revelation of who God is to you
[1:30:55] not to the group but to you
[1:31:00] oh my
[1:31:05] I know I'm learning how a time but
[1:31:10] he talks about
[1:31:13] the other Memorial it says about Lot's
[1:31:15] wife now I thought it's very important I
[1:31:18] say this
[1:31:20] there's so many different things they
[1:31:22] said but just for the sake of time I'll
[1:31:24] just read few of them
[1:31:26] he says that wife started out as an
[1:31:29] overcomer
[1:31:31] but she never did overcome
[1:31:36] says that God used her
[1:31:39] as a memorial also the same way that the
[1:31:42] rocks that we just talked about in
[1:31:44] Joshua was a memorial there is another
[1:31:46] Memorial of Lot's wife
[1:31:49] it says it says she wanted to see what
[1:31:54] others in the world are doing
[1:31:58] she wanted to have her hair cut
[1:32:03] because she looked back at the memorial
[1:32:06] of disgrace
[1:32:09] who were greater it says and and she was
[1:32:12] a lady she wanted to be among the
[1:32:15] society in the city of Sodom and and of
[1:32:18] Gomorrah and Sodom Lord's wife was
[1:32:21] carnal and these are part of I I just
[1:32:24] took there's so much of them I didn't
[1:32:26] have time to take all of it she started
[1:32:28] to he says she stands today in the field
[1:32:31] there as a pill of salt as a disgrace to
[1:32:35] those who pass
[1:32:38] she wanted to have a last look
[1:32:42] Lord's wife she says in one place he
[1:32:45] says she merely looked
[1:32:48] it's like it's not like she turned God
[1:32:50] she merely it says oh my she merely
[1:32:53] looked
[1:32:54] she wanted to be in luxury it says one
[1:32:58] place
[1:32:59] her husband had had to become a great
[1:33:01] man in the city and and and the one in
[1:33:04] this message he says she was just trying
[1:33:06] to be sociable
[1:33:10] okay
[1:33:13] and I want to say that to us because
[1:33:16] it's very important we take this
[1:33:18] seriously we are called to for a
[1:33:20] different Memorial and the memorial that
[1:33:22] we are called to represent is cut us off
[1:33:25] of all those things
[1:33:28] we we can't be there and and still wants
[1:33:31] to keep our
[1:33:32] associations all of the likes uh
[1:33:35] following all the Instagrams and the the
[1:33:38] tick tocks and all of the the trains
[1:33:41] that's going on you know today it's one
[1:33:43] person standing on one foot tomorrow he
[1:33:45] has his shirt off and and all of that
[1:33:47] we're following
[1:33:50] now what Memorial are you really trying
[1:33:53] to represent
[1:33:55] you say well it's Christ but I still
[1:33:57] want to have fun the way the world is
[1:34:00] having fun
[1:34:04] you you go here but yet you you among
[1:34:08] people that are I'll tell you this you
[1:34:11] sit around with people that curse all
[1:34:13] the time
[1:34:14] you don't have to force it one day it's
[1:34:17] gonna come out of your mouth
[1:34:18] I speak my experience
[1:34:24] you don't have you stay among people
[1:34:27] that constantly negative negative or
[1:34:29] negative they're saying this one day you
[1:34:33] don't have to you don't even have to
[1:34:34] have learned it you automatically will
[1:34:37] display it
[1:34:42] you you stay around you you be sociable
[1:34:45] enough with the world oh you know we
[1:34:47] just go in we're gonna just go play
[1:34:49] basketball and yet they are you know
[1:34:51] saying all kinds of things and all of
[1:34:53] that and and it's getting in you you
[1:34:55] said well as long as I don't participate
[1:34:56] I don't say what they say I'm good
[1:34:59] you one day you'll find yourself
[1:35:01] repeating those same things and you're
[1:35:03] going to wonder what if you ever gone
[1:35:05] you went to a restaurant and said and
[1:35:08] ate you didn't even know what music was
[1:35:10] playing but one day out of nowhere your
[1:35:13] foot is moving you're like
[1:35:17] what's going on here
[1:35:20] and some tunes it's just out of it in
[1:35:22] the subconscious not in the conscience
[1:35:24] the moment your conscience catches it
[1:35:27] you look at your foot
[1:35:31] it's where you've been
[1:35:34] oh let's be careful of what Memorial we
[1:35:37] are presenting I'm saying this to
[1:35:40] encourage us so we know as our brother
[1:35:42] said this morning God has got everything
[1:35:44] under his control but what he wants us
[1:35:46] to do is to project the memorial that
[1:35:49] his place us here to do regardless of
[1:35:51] where I am I have to be mindful of what
[1:35:54] Memorial I'm bringing forth
[1:35:57] now
[1:36:05] Lord never thought he was going to end
[1:36:07] up in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:36:10] when he left Abraham he didn't pick up
[1:36:13] because if that was his desire he could
[1:36:16] have just moved there
[1:36:17] but all he took was for him to just have
[1:36:20] his tent
[1:36:21] pointed towards that direction
[1:36:28] today he saw the fireworks
[1:36:31] the next day he saw some light shows
[1:36:34] he saw some things
[1:36:36] and all of a sudden
[1:36:38] it caught his attention
[1:36:40] and
[1:36:42] maybe three months later
[1:36:45] the tank moved a little bit
[1:36:49] and the tank moved a little bit
[1:36:51] and the tank moved a little bit and then
[1:36:53] all of a sudden he was a governor a
[1:36:56] mayor
[1:37:00] you don't have to go and say I decided
[1:37:03] to go in the world
[1:37:04] I decided to do all of this no
[1:37:07] it's the association if it keeps
[1:37:10] continuing it's okay why aren't you
[1:37:12] living in Victoria life you're too much
[1:37:14] trash
[1:37:15] too much Association my body my sister

[1:37:40] I like to see him being chased and and
[1:37:42] I'd like to see him without a place I
[1:37:45] would like to see him out of all the
[1:37:46] children of God I want to cease
[1:37:48] deliverances heal it I want to see all
[1:37:50] of us I don't want to see the devil

[1:38:01] looking and says I've given you my word
[1:38:03] there is no better weapon I can give you
[1:38:05] than my word it's saying stand up clean

[1:38:12] sanctify yourself this day get yourself
[1:38:15] ready the word of God is going before
[1:38:17] you but once the word of God is already
[1:38:20] pronounced I've given you the land

[1:38:26] have the landing
[1:38:29] man
[1:38:31] sanctification

[1:39:19] myself I want to see God moving
[1:39:23] and it's not to him it's up to us
[1:39:29] I want to be a memorial I want if
[1:39:32] somebody called me and say brother we
[1:39:34] need you to come here and pray I want
[1:39:36] when I show up I am certain that all
[1:39:38] Heaven is with me I don't want to be one
[1:39:41] that was playing games and then they
[1:39:43] called me I go oh God oh God help me
[1:39:48] preaching
[1:39:50] that's what we do we are in complete
[1:39:52] destruction then when something happened
[1:39:54] oh we want the blood we want this I mean
[1:39:58] we want everything we want it right
[1:39:59] there no he wants us to be ready we are
[1:40:02] in a battle he wants you to be ready at
[1:40:04] all times
[1:40:11] I have given you the land
[1:40:15] it's a memorial when your children ask
[1:40:17] you
[1:40:18] as your son ever asked you your daughter
[1:40:20] ask you something you have no idea how
[1:40:22] to answer because you haven't been
[1:40:24] practicing
[1:40:27] that way daddy aren't we supposed to be
[1:40:29] praying all day
[1:40:31] yes hun but you know
[1:40:34] that he got a little bit busy
[1:40:39] something happening
[1:40:41] I want to be ready I want to run to it
[1:40:43] God what would you have me do what would
[1:40:46] you want me to do if he calls me or if
[1:40:48] he tells me now condemnation is always
[1:40:50] going to be there regardless of whether
[1:40:53] it's always going to be there but I
[1:40:55] don't want to be to have something that
[1:40:57] I have caused by my own hands
[1:40:59] I want to do what my part is and let God
[1:41:02] do his part like we say
[1:41:06] people that are Sanctified ready to take
[1:41:08] the battle ready to possess the land
[1:41:10] wherever it's needed
[1:41:12] people that are ready to speak the word
[1:41:14] if the musician could come
[1:41:32] foreign
[1:41:34] says
[1:41:37] God's Building and God is building a
[1:41:40] memorial
[1:41:41] is God is building a church
[1:41:44] as a memorial
[1:41:47] a memorial of the feast sacrifice
[1:41:51] Christ never come to Earth paragraph 35
[1:41:53] Christ never come to Earth to die in
[1:41:56] vain his death will not be in vain God's
[1:42:00] able for these stones to raid to rise
[1:42:03] children of Abraham if people won't live
[1:42:06] it they won't take it into under
[1:42:09] consider under consideration and realize
[1:42:12] what a great gift God is giving them
[1:42:14] God's is able
[1:42:16] of this stones to rise to raise children
[1:42:20] of Abraham truly he will do that
[1:42:24] so I say today Brothers the things to do
[1:42:27] is the word is the things to do it says
[1:42:29] the words that you say paragraph 31 how
[1:42:33] you you treat your brother
[1:42:36] what you do about Christ
[1:42:38] will be an everlasting Memorial
[1:42:42] you might you might have a fine home to
[1:42:44] live in
[1:42:46] to live to your children you might have
[1:42:48] you might have been working for some
[1:42:51] livelihood to live to your children but
[1:42:54] I'd rather leave them the word of God
[1:42:56] than anything else those houses will
[1:42:59] vanish that's perfectly right it says
[1:43:02] that's perfect you're right that's good
[1:43:04] I have nothing against it but don't do
[1:43:06] those minor things and leave the great
[1:43:09] things undone
[1:43:11] you see because the word
[1:43:14] that says the word it will it says the
[1:43:16] house will perish the people will perish
[1:43:18] with it but God's word but the word of
[1:43:22] God will will raise them up in the last
[1:43:24] day and give them an eternal
[1:43:28] and immortal
[1:43:30] life again
[1:43:34] examine your own memorial
[1:43:38] remember it consists of what you do
[1:43:42] your works not what you say
[1:43:46] and I'm not saying this in condemnation
[1:43:48] so to say
[1:43:51] you don't have it you don't have it I
[1:43:53] said it's been given to us
[1:43:56] to do it the scripture says to them it's
[1:43:59] not given but to you it's given when
[1:44:02] something is given it means it's yours
[1:44:05] to possess to exercise when something
[1:44:08] has been given to you it means it's in
[1:44:10] your power in your Authority casting out
[1:44:12] devil is not something we need to say oh
[1:44:15] God we need you to go do it no it's
[1:44:17] something that's been given to you
[1:44:19] if you sanctify yourself if you get
[1:44:22] yourself ready if you kick out the trash
[1:44:25] you have the authority to perform the
[1:44:27] work in fact it says one place oh I love
[1:44:30] it it says you speak the word and then
[1:44:32] he says the holy spirit is the enforcer
[1:44:34] he takes the word and he runs through
[1:44:37] the devil and says get out of here why
[1:44:39] because the owner is calling for it
[1:44:46] amen it's Austin
[1:44:59] oh I say
[1:45:01] away
[1:45:03] he said he had a vision
[1:45:06] before a man can make a repetition he
[1:45:09] has to have a vision
[1:45:10] of what he's doing
[1:45:12] oh blessed be the Lord
[1:45:15] that's the reason he says
[1:45:17] you are it says there are they they are
[1:45:20] in heaven
[1:45:21] there's in heaven to go to
[1:45:24] that's the reason we can have a
[1:45:25] reputation as a Christian we know what
[1:45:28] material is in the building
[1:45:31] that's right the blood of Jesus
[1:45:34] Jesus Christ is in the building that's
[1:45:36] right he's stained the blood has washed
[1:45:40] away all sins he took me from the alley
[1:45:43] of hell and
[1:45:45] made me a servant
[1:45:47] then I believe in him
[1:45:49] so I passed from Death To Life
[1:45:52] and every believer has done as did that
[1:45:56] because he asked they because
[1:46:00] that they had to go that they that they
[1:46:03] got confidence and they believe in the
[1:46:05] great Builder
[1:46:06] in the in this great architect the
[1:46:10] process
[1:46:12] it says paragraph 43 says now
[1:46:15] when the man did this the first thing
[1:46:17] that it did to be sure that he was right
[1:46:20] he went down and he said now before we
[1:46:25] get the breach to start started we got
[1:46:28] to go to the solid foundation we've got
[1:46:31] to go
[1:46:32] we've got to go he knew that down
[1:46:35] beneath the sand
[1:46:36] the breast of the Earth
[1:46:38] was was there which was a solid rock
[1:46:42] what did he do
[1:46:44] what did he do but get the great big
[1:46:47] pump and got it up and got in there and
[1:46:51] set the great tube down there down and
[1:46:53] he blew and shifted the shifted sand and
[1:46:57] this prompts until it blewed it up down
[1:47:01] to the solid rock when it got when he
[1:47:03] when he got her on the solid on the Rock
[1:47:06] he anchored this great big bolt in there
[1:47:11] and got it ready

[1:51:36] was talking about that you know when
[1:51:37] when the prophet would preach the token
[1:51:39] I believe he preaches the token
[1:51:41] September 1st 1963 he preaches the token
[1:51:45] and what a glorious message I believe
[1:51:48] even the prophet Mitch that's like one
[1:51:50] of the uh one of the capping or it was
[1:51:52] one of the his great messages and and
[1:51:54] you know what he preaches that evening

[1:51:59] token if you want the token life if you
[1:52:02] want an everlasting Memorial if you want
[1:52:04] Christ the Everlasting Memorial if you
[1:52:07] want to be a Lively Stone we got to get
[1:52:09] into desperation

[1:52:13] you know the brother Brandon talks about
[1:52:14] how we're we're so slothful and dilatory
[1:52:17] it takes tragedy or it takes trial it
[1:52:20] takes things to get us into a place of
[1:52:23] desperation but as our brother was
[1:52:25] ministering I don't I don't want it to
[1:52:27] have to take tragedy and all of a sudden
