[55:58] i mean i like to listen to singing i
[56:02] i pray someday i can sing there's an old
[56:05] song i liked
[56:06] a lot and it was called please let me
[56:09] join the choir i don't know
[56:13] some of you probably know that song huh
[56:16] but anyway
[56:17] you know one day he got in the choir and
[56:20] that that that was the glorious part of
[56:23] it
[56:24] let's turn in our bible to uh matthew
[56:27] the 11th chapter
[56:31] and we
[56:34] want to read the 28th and 29th verse
[56:42] and
[56:47] and we'll read here
[56:54] it says come unto me all ye
[56:58] that labor and are heavy laden
[57:02] and i will give you rest
[57:06] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[57:12] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[57:16] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[57:20] for my yoke is easy and my burden
[57:24] is light heavenly father we ask you to
[57:26] bless us in jesus name we pray
[57:29] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[57:37] um i i you know when
[57:40] you listen um a lot of times
[57:45] certain messages things begin to stand
[57:48] out to you
[57:49] and we listen uh to the last
[57:53] portion of last sunday night
[57:57] of the message called
[58:00] what heiress doubt um
[58:04] and we just picked up that
[58:07] message from the third part of it
[58:12] but brother graham said that that
[58:14] message that
[58:15] uh what we read out of and and he will
[58:18] read the scripture when we play the
[58:20] first part of it
[58:22] in 1st kings 19
[58:25] and it's the story about elijah going
[58:28] into
[58:29] the cave and we listened last week how
[58:32] that he listened
[58:34] the prophet of god was talking about the
[58:36] thunder this loud
[58:38] in everything he says but where's god in
[58:41] it
[58:42] and that's what we we wanted to
[58:45] emphasize last week that he he's
[58:48] he's not in the noise he's not in the
[58:52] thunder he's not in the lightning
[58:54] but he's in the still small void
[58:58] so in the midst of those great times
[59:02] when you feel the joy of the lord the
[59:05] excitement's moving
[59:06] in the church always have that ear
[59:09] inclined to what's god
[59:11] speaking to me and brother man makes
[59:15] this
[59:15] expression when he began to talk about
[59:19] that story
[59:20] he said it has three parts
[59:23] has the mount carmel the juniper tree
[59:28] and the cave and i i thought
[59:32] about that a lot and and
[59:35] i i realized that you know we're so
[59:39] prone in our lives as
[59:42] christians to push
[59:45] the mount carmel experience it almost to
[59:49] the point
[59:50] that uh and you know the great mount
[59:54] carmel experience you know the
[59:56] fire comes down consumes it
[59:59] you know elijah says let the god of
[1:00:02] heaven answer and
[1:00:03] you know and i mean it's it's it's just
[1:00:06] a
[1:00:06] a great victory and and we
[1:00:10] preach a lot and we emphasize
[1:00:14] a lot the great mount carmel
[1:00:17] experiences and we it's almost like we
[1:00:20] encourage
[1:00:21] ourselves to have a you know to be
[1:00:24] victorious
[1:00:25] and to uh uh uh uh we want a mountaintop
[1:00:29] experience
[1:00:30] you know we want victory and and signs
[1:00:33] and wonders
[1:00:34] and uh uh you know and
[1:00:38] and you know nothing to stand in our way
[1:00:40] and if we have faith and
[1:00:43] and you know and we can do all things
[1:00:46] and
[1:00:47] all that and we put so much emphasizes
[1:00:50] sometimes on the victorious
[1:00:53] mount carmel experience that we forget
[1:00:57] there's another side of it and if we
[1:01:01] could uh and and those are the times we
[1:01:05] have to get through
[1:01:06] it and so i'd like to uh uh
[1:01:10] play this to you tonight
[1:01:14] and as you uh
[1:01:17] you listen to it i i just think
[1:01:20] it's so real
[1:01:24] do you know what i mean and and um
[1:01:28] he's dealing i think really with our the
[1:01:31] what we actually really go through in
[1:01:34] life
[1:01:35] you know and it seems sometimes that our
[1:01:38] life has
[1:01:39] ups and downs and it's got great times
[1:01:42] and it's got other times
[1:01:44] that aren't so uh great and sometimes we
[1:01:48] can feel
[1:01:49] a little down and and if we
[1:01:52] can if we can understand those
[1:01:55] both sides of it and grow a little bit
[1:01:58] we
[1:01:59] we talk a little bit about that maturity
[1:02:02] that comes and i think this is a little
[1:02:06] statement of the things that are in here
[1:02:09] that will just uh
[1:02:12] it it helps you you know what i mean
[1:02:14] there's those little stones that you can
[1:02:16] put in your foundation and you can know
[1:02:20] i've got something that's holding me
[1:02:22] that's rock solid and
[1:02:24] you know leslie and i were coming back
[1:02:27] from
[1:02:28] uh lunch today and so
[1:02:31] you know what we preached this morning
[1:02:34] you know is that
[1:02:35] that god is is moving all that he has
[1:02:39] and all that he's offered the church
[1:02:42] it's it's ripening in
[1:02:43] every believer so when the grain is ripe
[1:02:47] it's
[1:02:48] all ripe it's all grain it's all full of
[1:02:51] him
[1:02:52] it's all full of life you know that
[1:02:54] we've come to the final stage
[1:02:57] where the very life of christ is in his
[1:03:00] bride
[1:03:01] and the bridegroom and the bride have an
[1:03:04] invisible union
[1:03:06] and they become one and she becomes one
[1:03:09] with the word
[1:03:11] and so when you when that starts to
[1:03:14] become a reality
[1:03:16] then you begin to see god in everybody
[1:03:19] and so we're driving up the street and
[1:03:22] we come around the corner and
[1:03:24] just fellowship and around the things
[1:03:26] and we look up the street and
[1:03:28] and we see some people up
[1:03:31] the street and uh uh and then leslie
[1:03:34] looks at me and she says
[1:03:36] it looks like there's a revival going on
[1:03:38] on our street
[1:03:40] and and there was we have a little lady
[1:03:42] in our neighborhood and she likes to get
[1:03:45] out
[1:03:45] and and jog a little and and
[1:03:48] a nice lady and and here david junior
[1:03:52] and
[1:03:54] the lamborghini are walking up the
[1:03:57] street
[1:03:58] together that's my nickname for him you
[1:04:01] know
[1:04:01] me and leslie just love him to death you
[1:04:03] know brother lambert so
[1:04:06] and and we look up the street and here's
[1:04:08] david
[1:04:09] and and that lady and brother lambert
[1:04:12] and they're all in the middle of the
[1:04:13] street praying
[1:04:16] you know and i don't know what she
[1:04:17] wanted to be prayed about
[1:04:19] and everything but it was like i thought
[1:04:21] praise god we're in the millennium
[1:04:24] you know what i mean neighbors praying
[1:04:26] on the street
[1:04:27] right in the street you know what i mean
[1:04:29] i'm surprised somebody didn't call the
[1:04:31] police and said
[1:04:32] that offends me you know what i mean
[1:04:36] they want to get rid of the bible in
[1:04:38] school they want to they've already done
[1:04:40] it i guess no prayer no nothing they had
[1:04:43] one
[1:04:44] a county or some courthouse
[1:04:47] they made them take the 10 commandments
[1:04:49] down out of the front of the courthouse
[1:04:51] because it
[1:04:52] offends somebody well you know what the
[1:04:55] word of god says right blessed is he
[1:04:57] who's not offended in me and i thought
[1:05:01] they're just out there praying with the
[1:05:02] neighbor
[1:05:03] lady you know right in the middle of the
[1:05:05] street
[1:05:06] i thought that was good that made me
[1:05:09] excited
[1:05:10] and so i i honestly played this this
[1:05:13] evening for you
[1:05:14] because this 35 minutes or so it's not
[1:05:17] terribly long but if you listen
[1:05:19] it's it's just
[1:05:23] full of statements and wisdom
[1:05:28] and understanding and that
[1:05:31] will will really bless you and
[1:05:35] and so i i guess i don't want to explain
[1:05:38] it i just want you to
[1:05:39] listen to it and it'll be a wonderful
[1:05:42] blessing so
[1:05:44] we're just going to start uh
[1:05:47] at the eighth paragraph just about seven
[1:05:50] minutes in
[1:05:52] and if you listen to the tape from the
[1:05:54] beginning
[1:05:55] brother branham had some young girls
[1:05:57] sing a special
[1:05:58] that he heard his daughter and i
[1:06:02] may have been the beeler girl i'm not
[1:06:04] sure playing at his house and
[1:06:06] but it it this tape is a wonderful tape
[1:06:10] and i'm sorry i broke it up into two
[1:06:12] parts and
[1:06:13] and i know people would think you should
[1:06:15] play the first part
[1:06:18] you know the second part second but i
[1:06:21] played the second part
[1:06:22] second and the first first and i tried
[1:06:25] to figure out a scripture for that
[1:06:27] so you know but i couldn't i know and i
[1:06:31] i don't know if you
[1:06:32] notice i know people have but i guess i
[1:06:35] had got something in my eye or something
[1:06:37] and it turned red
[1:06:38] but uh that's okay i i see
[1:06:42] just fine so anyway lord bless you i i
[1:06:45] really feel you'll enjoy
[1:06:47] this next thing and then if afterwards

[1:06:57] testimony they'd just like to testify
[1:07:00] maybe we'll just give a few minutes for
[1:07:02] another
[1:07:03] uh testimony amen god bless you i i
[1:07:06] really believe you'll enjoy this
[1:07:08] what hear us doubt uh god bless you
[1:07:12] mark uh first
[1:07:16] in 1959. god bless you
[1:07:20] glorious some years ago in england
[1:07:24] there was a man he thought he would go
[1:07:27] out
[1:07:28] and have a little friendly drink at
[1:07:30] christmas time
[1:07:31] just for fellowship and he went out
[1:07:34] among his neighbors and he was
[1:07:36] exchanging presents and everybody would
[1:07:39] say to him now
[1:07:40] john just take a drink of this and
[1:07:44] a little sip here and a little sip there
[1:07:47] and he got really intoxicated
[1:07:51] and on his road home there'd come a snow
[1:07:53] about six inches and
[1:07:56] and his little boy was following him he
[1:07:58] couldn't pack him he was too drunk
[1:08:00] and his armies rode home and he happened
[1:08:03] to turn around and notice his little boy
[1:08:05] just
[1:08:05] almost watering in the snow
[1:08:08] and he said son why are you
[1:08:12] uh watering in the snow
[1:08:15] he said daddy i'm trying to follow your
[1:08:18] footsteps and he picked the little lad
[1:08:23] up in his arms and said
[1:08:24] god from this day on i'll never take
[1:08:27] another drink
[1:08:30] somebody's going to follow your
[1:08:32] footsteps
[1:08:34] let's walk that straight line from the
[1:08:37] cradle to calvary
[1:08:39] that's the footsteps let's have them to
[1:08:42] walk in
[1:08:44] now i know tonight is communion night
[1:08:48] and i'll just have a short time to speak
[1:08:50] to you
[1:08:52] in the word i i love to talk about him
[1:08:56] because he's so
[1:08:57] real to me
[1:09:00] i was reading a little article sometime
[1:09:03] ago
[1:09:04] thinking back to the girls again
[1:09:07] it happened out in the west there was a
[1:09:10] one howling stormy night in the
[1:09:13] winds high and there was
[1:09:16] uh some had a prayer meeting
[1:09:22] and the one that led the prayer meeting
[1:09:24] was a very
[1:09:26] attractive little lady
[1:09:29] not thinking about the dangers she would
[1:09:32] be in but
[1:09:33] she lived kindly cater cornered across
[1:09:36] the little city
[1:09:39] and usually on the streets there was
[1:09:41] lots of people at that time of night
[1:09:43] when the prayer meeting closer songs had
[1:09:46] been
[1:09:47] to the lord and their hearts were happy
[1:09:49] and
[1:09:50] i guess all together they felt about
[1:09:52] like brother beeler did a while ago and
[1:09:54] he was testifying
[1:09:57] just so happy they couldn't contain the
[1:09:59] joy and just
[1:10:00] had to leave it roll out someway
[1:10:03] after the last amen had been said they
[1:10:06] all made their way to
[1:10:07] their homes and the little young lady
[1:10:10] picked up her coat
[1:10:11] and pulled a collar up and latched over
[1:10:14] the front of it and started down the
[1:10:16] street
[1:10:17] and she come to find out that the
[1:10:21] whole night had run everybody into their
[1:10:24] own fireplace
[1:10:25] and she found herself alone on the
[1:10:28] streets and it seems to be like
[1:10:31] a danger begin to
[1:10:34] haunt her you know i'm so glad that the
[1:10:37] holy spirit can
[1:10:38] warn us of things that's coming
[1:10:42] escape those dangers
[1:10:45] and she had never thought of being
[1:10:47] afraid and
[1:10:48] she just got to singing that old song no
[1:10:52] never alone and as she went all across
[1:10:56] the city seemed like no one was
[1:10:59] going to bother her but all of a sudden
[1:11:02] there rose that great
[1:11:03] fear again and she happened to look
[1:11:06] standing close and there stood a real
[1:11:10] hideous looking man looking right at her
[1:11:14] holding his arms out like this coming
[1:11:16] towards her
[1:11:17] there's no way to get away and it's a
[1:11:21] true story
[1:11:22] so she could not run he'd catch her
[1:11:26] there was only one thing to do she
[1:11:28] couldn't scream the winds was blowing so
[1:11:30] hard
[1:11:30] almost lifting her body from the street
[1:11:33] she'll never make anyone hear
[1:11:35] the snow just a blinding
[1:11:38] and there's only one thing to do that
[1:11:40] was pray
[1:11:43] so she began under her voice whispering
[1:11:46] a prayer to god and she said
[1:11:48] she never knew where it come from but
[1:11:51] all of a sudden by the side of the door
[1:11:54] stood a great big dog and he had his
[1:11:57] bristles up
[1:11:58] and he walked out to her side and come
[1:12:01] on the
[1:12:02] side which the man would be on and begin
[1:12:05] growling viciously as he passed on by
[1:12:08] the man and as soon as the man
[1:12:10] went on down the street the dog turned
[1:12:12] and went back and laid down in the door
[1:12:16] god will care for his own
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:21] god sometimes he works through even a
[1:12:24] dog or an
[1:12:25] animal or some other way to
[1:12:28] show his glory and his protection amen
[1:12:31] i'm so happy that i know him in the
[1:12:34] forgiveness of my sins and with the
[1:12:36] assurance
[1:12:38] that my sins are under the blood as i
[1:12:40] confess them
[1:12:41] daily to him
[1:12:45] this morning in the message i might have
[1:12:49] seemed a little
[1:12:50] choppy or a little rude
[1:12:53] but not a very much of a text for
[1:12:57] uh a healing service
[1:13:00] but i've lived long enough to know this
[1:13:04] brother tony if a man will
[1:13:07] just do as he fails led to do
[1:13:11] god taking care of the rest of it in a
[1:13:13] master way
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:16] first time it ever happened like that
[1:13:18] year
[1:13:19] uh we usually give out prayer cards and
[1:13:21] stand up to people but
[1:13:23] the holy spirit had me to ask how many
[1:13:25] strangers was in the building
[1:13:28] which would cover it completely and then
[1:13:32] he made knowing to them their desires
[1:13:34] and
[1:13:35] pronounce their healings and so forth
[1:13:38] amen
[1:13:39] just goes to show that obedience is
[1:13:42] better than
[1:13:43] sacrifice hardening unto the
[1:13:46] and the fats of rams
[1:13:49] so tonight i've chosen a little
[1:13:51] scripture here for
[1:13:53] just a few moments to speak
[1:13:56] and before we do that let us bow our
[1:13:59] heads just a moment in prayer
[1:14:04] lord thou
[1:14:07] art god forevermore
[1:14:11] and we thank and praise thee for
[1:14:15] the privilege that we have of coming
[1:14:17] before thee
[1:14:19] in the way of prayer knowing this
[1:14:23] first that it is promised to us
[1:14:26] that if you asked anything in my name
[1:14:30] i'll do it and we have the assurance
[1:14:34] that you'll grant
[1:14:35] our request
[1:14:38] and there's been so much already done
[1:14:41] tonight
[1:14:44] that we feel that if we should just
[1:14:46] close the service and go home
[1:14:49] we could say it has been good to be here
[1:14:53] do you hear these songs of zion
[1:14:57] saying in the audience you hear
[1:15:00] the people as they give out their
[1:15:03] voices in prayer and in meditations
[1:15:08] and in hymns as the scripture says
[1:15:11] making mary in your heart singing
[1:15:14] spiritual
[1:15:14] songs do you hear these little teenage
[1:15:18] girls
[1:15:19] in this dark hour as it's been expressed
[1:15:22] tonight through our brother dealer that
[1:15:24] we're living in
[1:15:27] and to hear them sing the songs of zion
[1:15:33] hear brother bieler's expression to you
[1:15:36] how he appreciated you and what you had
[1:15:39] done
[1:15:40] and how that you crippled him up to let
[1:15:42] him realize
[1:15:45] what would he do without that arm now
[1:15:49] it just goes to show that we are
[1:15:51] protected by your
[1:15:53] grace and power
[1:15:56] let us all take heed tonight lord for
[1:16:00] i believe that it's time for us to take
[1:16:03] inventory
[1:16:05] checking up time for we don't know what
[1:16:08] time
[1:16:08] it's going to be checking out time
[1:16:12] it may be later than we think so let us
[1:16:15] consider
[1:16:16] our ways tonight and our thoughts
[1:16:19] and we pray that you'd speak to us for a
[1:16:22] few moments in the word
[1:16:24] that bless us in the communing service
[1:16:26] afterwards
[1:16:28] as we take the broken parts of this
[1:16:31] kosher bread and wine that represents
[1:16:35] your broken
[1:16:36] body and shed blood for the remission of
[1:16:38] our sins
[1:16:41] our most beloved pastor tonight
[1:16:46] wasn't feeling too well but
[1:16:49] in our telephone conversation he has
[1:16:53] placed it up on the altar
[1:16:56] i'm sure you'll receive it lord
[1:17:00] not further offer a prayer for him
[1:17:04] for we love him and we need him
[1:17:08] we pray for he and his family and for
[1:17:10] every family that's cheering
[1:17:12] for all the spoken requests tonight and
[1:17:14] the silent
[1:17:15] also bless us further in the meetings
[1:17:19] for
[1:17:19] we asked it in jesus name thy son
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:27] i want to read just a little potion of
[1:17:29] scriptures here
[1:17:31] found in first kings 19
[1:17:36] and beginning at the ninth verse
[1:17:43] and he came tether unto a cave
[1:17:47] and lodged there and behold the word of
[1:17:51] the lord came
[1:17:52] unto him and said unto him what does
[1:17:55] thou
[1:17:55] hear elijah
[1:17:59] and he said i have been zealous
[1:18:02] or jealous for the lord god of host and
[1:18:06] far his children of israel
[1:18:08] have forsaken thy covenant
[1:18:12] thrown down thine altars and slaying thy
[1:18:15] prophets
[1:18:16] with a sword and i even i
[1:18:19] alone am left and they seek my life to
[1:18:22] take it
[1:18:25] and he said go forth and stand up on the
[1:18:29] mount
[1:18:30] before the lord and behold the lord pass
[1:18:34] by
[1:18:35] and a great storm
[1:18:39] when went and rent the mountain and
[1:18:41] breaking pieces
[1:18:42] the rocks before the lord but the lord
[1:18:46] was not
[1:18:47] in the wind and after the wind
[1:18:50] an earthquake but the lord was not in
[1:18:53] the
[1:18:54] earthquake and after the earthquake fire
[1:18:58] but the lord was not in the fire
[1:19:01] and after the fire a still
[1:19:04] small voice
[1:19:08] and it was so when elijah heard it
[1:19:13] that he wrapped his face in his mantle
[1:19:17] and went out and stood in the entrance
[1:19:20] of the cave
[1:19:22] and behold there came a voice unto him
[1:19:25] and said what does thou hear
[1:19:28] elijah
[1:19:31] i want to take for a text for a few
[1:19:34] moments
[1:19:37] what does thou hear
[1:19:42] elijah had a hard day
[1:19:48] he'd been on mount carmel he had seen
[1:19:51] the glory of the lord come down
[1:19:55] he had prayed fire out of the heavens
[1:19:57] and
[1:19:58] and then prayed rain down upon the earth
[1:20:03] and under all
[1:20:05] this stream his nerves were about
[1:20:08] broken oh how i can
[1:20:12] feel for him and here we find him
[1:20:17] first preaching to a
[1:20:20] backslidden nation of people
[1:20:25] and to a jezebel that wanted her way
[1:20:30] and the people had come to a place that
[1:20:34] they had forsaken
[1:20:36] god forsook all of his promises and
[1:20:40] all of his commandments and no longer
[1:20:43] kept his statues and
[1:20:44] cared nothing faring
[1:20:48] and elijah in the midst of all of it he
[1:20:51] could not
[1:20:52] compromise he had to stand
[1:20:56] true to his convictions
[1:21:00] oh how that reflects in this day
[1:21:05] and they had a queen there by the name
[1:21:08] of jezebel
[1:21:10] and she had let all the children of
[1:21:12] israel astray with her
[1:21:14] modern fantastic way of living
[1:21:18] she'd cause them to commit fornications
[1:21:22] and to do evil things
[1:21:25] if that isn't a good parallel to the
[1:21:28] dean
[1:21:30] but elijah in the midst of it all yet
[1:21:33] many other children of israel thousands
[1:21:36] of them had
[1:21:37] compromised and wanted to live the
[1:21:40] modern
[1:21:41] trend of life yet elijah would not
[1:21:44] compromise
[1:21:45] he told jezebel her place and how she
[1:21:49] must do
[1:21:51] oh she hated that prophet
[1:21:55] but just the same she wouldn't claim him
[1:21:58] but
[1:21:59] he was her pastor
[1:22:02] all there's a lot of times they don't
[1:22:04] want to claim it
[1:22:06] but a god-sent man to a community is a
[1:22:09] pastor of the entire community
[1:22:12] whether he's baptist presbyterian or who
[1:22:14] it is god
[1:22:15] anoints his man and he will not
[1:22:19] compromise and the people sometimes
[1:22:21] hates him
[1:22:23] because he stands for truth but yet he's
[1:22:26] god's pastor for the hour
[1:22:30] oh she despised him she'd do
[1:22:34] anything she could to kill him
[1:22:37] but yet he was true to god's principles
[1:22:41] god's standards her modern
[1:22:44] parties and socials and her painting of
[1:22:48] her face and the wearing of her clothes
[1:22:50] had polluted that nation
[1:22:54] old elijah wasn't easy he told her right
[1:22:57] where she was standing
[1:23:00] god sent us some more elijah's in this
[1:23:02] day
[1:23:04] he'll not compromise with sin
[1:23:07] somebody who preached the truth no
[1:23:10] matter
[1:23:10] how bad it hurts god
[1:23:14] still got servants in every community
[1:23:17] that won't compromise with the things of
[1:23:19] the world
[1:23:21] elijah didn't like the modern trend of
[1:23:23] things
[1:23:24] so he stood true to god
[1:23:28] and the showdown came
[1:23:32] and the showdown has come again
[1:23:36] and elijah up on mount carmel
[1:23:39] when they thought that all the days of
[1:23:41] miracles were passed and there could not
[1:23:43] be nothing else like miracles
[1:23:45] there was one man who believed in it
[1:23:49] and he said bring up all your prophets
[1:23:53] bring them up here on the mountain and
[1:23:55] let's prove and see who's gone
[1:23:59] i love that scripture
[1:24:02] oh if there ever was a time
[1:24:05] in a place that the
[1:24:09] true power of god ought to be
[1:24:12] made manifest is today let's prove
[1:24:15] what's gone
[1:24:17] if education is the way out to freedom
[1:24:20] why don't it act
[1:24:23] if social standings and so forth is a
[1:24:26] way out
[1:24:27] why don't it act if paying other nations
[1:24:32] to be our buddies and we find out they
[1:24:34] turn heels against us
[1:24:36] just as soon as they can and you can't
[1:24:39] buy a
[1:24:40] friendship with money friendship is a
[1:24:43] gift
[1:24:44] of god if the great churches and great
[1:24:48] teachers
[1:24:48] is the way out why don't we have more
[1:24:50] god in our communities
[1:24:53] why is it we're on the constant move
[1:24:56] backwards
[1:24:57] if the educational program and the
[1:25:00] well-trained pulpit
[1:25:02] and the well-trained choir and
[1:25:05] constantly we get
[1:25:06] further away from god all the time
[1:25:10] then it won't work what's
[1:25:14] science done science you say the time
[1:25:18] will come when science can do this and
[1:25:20] do that
[1:25:20] what have they done they've brought us
[1:25:23] to a place until they're destroying the
[1:25:25] whole world
[1:25:28] what are they doing they're wrecking the
[1:25:31] world instead of making it better
[1:25:34] not long ago when captain al farar
[1:25:38] of the fbi over the juvenile parts of
[1:25:41] the
[1:25:42] united states had me in his office after
[1:25:45] i
[1:25:45] led him to christ down in the shooting
[1:25:47] gallery
[1:25:48] he said brother branham i'm a baptist i
[1:25:51] hear you as a baptist i said yes sir
[1:25:54] he said but i haven't got that holy
[1:25:56] ghost that you're talking about
[1:26:00] he said you think it'd be for me i said
[1:26:02] yes sir
[1:26:03] he said well i'll order a nice sweet
[1:26:05] somewhere in some nice hotel room
[1:26:09] and let you and i go up there and maybe
[1:26:11] he'll come to the hotel room and
[1:26:13] fill me with this spirit i said you
[1:26:16] don't have a hoe to have to have a hotel
[1:26:18] suite
[1:26:20] say well where would he meet me and i
[1:26:22] said right here
[1:26:24] he said he wouldn't come in this gallery
[1:26:26] would he a shooting galley here i said
[1:26:29] he went in the belly of a whale for one
[1:26:31] into a fiery furnace for another he'll
[1:26:35] meet you on any grounds that you'll meet
[1:26:37] him on
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:43] god wants to meet you he wants to talk
[1:26:45] it over with you
[1:26:47] he'll come to where you are
[1:26:50] now jezebel had
[1:26:53] polluted the land and elijah and
[1:26:56] nerves have been on a strain and he had
[1:26:59] performed
[1:27:00] great miracles and done signs upon the
[1:27:03] hill
[1:27:04] to prove that god was still god
[1:27:07] and could answer in the way by a miracle
[1:27:12] and what did it bring the results of
[1:27:14] threat for his own life what did it
[1:27:18] bring instead of a universal revival
[1:27:22] that brought a threat to his life
[1:27:25] jezebel when ahab told her these things
[1:27:29] she said may the gods do to me and more
[1:27:32] too
[1:27:33] if i don't cut his head off for this
[1:27:34] time tomorrow night
[1:27:37] and elijah who was trying with a heart
[1:27:41] in him of god trying to show the people
[1:27:44] that god was still god
[1:27:48] and it backfired on him and he ran out
[1:27:51] into the wilderness when he heard it
[1:27:53] and there he laid under the juniper tree
[1:27:58] trying to find consolation he had sent
[1:28:01] his servant away and left him
[1:28:04] now our story goes in three different
[1:28:08] places
[1:28:09] one mount carmel the next under the
[1:28:12] juniper tree
[1:28:13] and the third place god meets him is in
[1:28:15] a cave
[1:28:18] and it's very strange pastor here knows
[1:28:21] and other ministers watch after you
[1:28:24] mount carmel's
[1:28:25] you're going to have a juniper tree
[1:28:29] whenever a man has a blessing and the
[1:28:31] power of god
[1:28:32] pours down and does something for you
[1:28:35] look out
[1:28:35] satan's on the track just remember the
[1:28:39] next day
[1:28:40] that monday after a good day on sunday
[1:28:44] it's going to be a hard thing because
[1:28:47] he's going to
[1:28:48] do everything he can to knock that
[1:28:50] confidence out of you
[1:28:52] that the holy spirit is still in you the
[1:28:54] day before
[1:28:57] so elijah had a big day and he's
[1:29:00] nervous anyhow all prophets are
[1:29:03] was declared insane jesus christ was
[1:29:06] declared insane
[1:29:08] every one of the apostles was declared
[1:29:10] insane by the public
[1:29:12] because their ministry was so
[1:29:14] supernatural until the people thought
[1:29:16] they were out of their minds
[1:29:18] everyone that lives godly in christ
[1:29:20] jesus
[1:29:22] will suffer persecutions you become a
[1:29:24] different
[1:29:25] person as brother bieler said about his
[1:29:29] sign in the back you become
[1:29:31] born again you become a new creature
[1:29:35] in christ old things have passed away
[1:29:38] the
[1:29:38] carnal things of the world has the war
[1:29:41] hold on you
[1:29:42] and you have no more halt on them when
[1:29:45] you pass from death unto life
[1:29:48] amen when god gets a hold of a man the
[1:29:50] first thing he does in a church
[1:29:52] is bring it from worldliness to holiness
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] and he brings it from death unto life
[1:30:00] amen it's born again it's new
[1:30:03] its ideas are new what we need is a
[1:30:06] revival like that today
[1:30:10] really is true oh we've had a dip of the
[1:30:14] spirit
[1:30:15] we've had spiritual blessings and
[1:30:17] spiritual uprises
[1:30:19] but we don't need that no more we need
[1:30:22] a revival of the spirit of the living
[1:30:25] god
[1:30:26] in the hearts of the people we don't
[1:30:30] need so much of the dips of the spirit
[1:30:32] our spiritual awakening we need a
[1:30:35] revival
[1:30:36] let's revive what we've got
[1:30:40] not a spiritual awakening sometimes that
[1:30:43] causes mixed multitudes
[1:30:45] but we need a revive let us sift down
[1:30:49] shake down and i'll cut out
[1:30:53] all the things like standing by the
[1:30:56] seashore
[1:30:57] i was talking to some brethren over in
[1:30:59] puerto rico a few weeks ago that when i
[1:31:02] seen the great sea
[1:31:03] in a great storm the waves were higher
[1:31:06] than this tabernacle
[1:31:08] and i said you know what it hasn't got
[1:31:10] one more
[1:31:11] drop of water in it than when it's
[1:31:13] perfectly calm
[1:31:14] but what does that churning and jumping
[1:31:18] in
[1:31:18] what does it mean it throws all the
[1:31:21] trash out of it upon the bank
[1:31:23] that's what the church needs is a
[1:31:26] revival to shake from it
[1:31:28] all the worldliness and the things of
[1:31:31] the world and bring back
[1:31:33] purity and holiness of god in the hearts
[1:31:37] of its believers
[1:31:38] humility one man this suit is something
[1:31:42] that don't get a revival once in a while
[1:31:43] their spirit
[1:31:44] they become so carnal and so indifferent
[1:31:47] until they get
[1:31:48] self-styled starchy
[1:31:52] self-righteous they
[1:31:55] read and study and that's good but that
[1:31:58] ain't the thing we're talking about
[1:32:00] you know more about the word it's good
[1:32:02] to know the word but it's better to know
[1:32:04] the author of the word
[1:32:06] see that little something that you leave
[1:32:08] out
[1:32:09] that's something in the heart that makes
[1:32:11] you what you are
[1:32:13] that's the thing i tell you elijah and
[1:32:17] his
[1:32:18] nerves on the age anyhow i always
[1:32:21] felt sorry for him his nerves is about
[1:32:25] ready to break anyhow and that great
[1:32:27] pound from jezebel finished the stroke
[1:32:31] then he run went into the wilderness and
[1:32:34] laid under the juniper tree
[1:32:37] oh that experience of the juniper tree
[1:32:42] there's many of us find ourselves under
[1:32:44] the juniper tree
[1:32:46] i get myself under there many times to a
[1:32:50] place that
[1:32:51] you don't know what to do you're
[1:32:53] flustered
[1:32:56] frankly i'm right under it now
[1:32:59] and wondering oh god what would you have
[1:33:02] me
[1:33:03] do you know people under the juniper
[1:33:06] tree
[1:33:07] is like elijah they like to sleep i i
[1:33:10] preach to more tired people than anybody
[1:33:12] in the world
[1:33:15] people are so tired they they
[1:33:18] they're so mentally strained until
[1:33:20] they're filling the insane institutions
[1:33:23] and
[1:33:23] hospitals everywhere they're one in such
[1:33:26] a
[1:33:26] nervous condition until they don't know
[1:33:29] what they do
[1:33:30] believe in what they want they're just
[1:33:33] laying there they don't know what to do
[1:33:35] oh it's such a
[1:33:36] sad sight listen here my brother
[1:33:40] you can't drink it off
[1:33:44] you can't shout it off
[1:33:48] neither can you play cards till it's
[1:33:51] dull
[1:33:52] and you could take a thousand siestas
[1:33:54] and try to sleep it off and you can't do
[1:33:57] it
[1:33:57] amen all of our little remedies
[1:34:01] only thing it does is help the symptoms
[1:34:04] we've got to have a cure for the disease
[1:34:09] we got to have all the psychiatrists in
[1:34:12] the world
[1:34:13] cannot cure it it only helps the
[1:34:16] symptoms the
[1:34:18] cure is in the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:22] not take a rest at the seashore
[1:34:26] not go get a anthem uh choirs to sing
[1:34:29] anthems
[1:34:31] that's what we're trying to do today
[1:34:34] sing it off
[1:34:36] oh we'll make ourselves like the joneses
[1:34:40] and we're we're trying to do something
[1:34:42] different
[1:34:43] trying to educate it out there's only
[1:34:46] one way to do that
[1:34:47] face the facts that's right
[1:34:51] oh if you're upset and frustrated
[1:34:55] don't your church come to christ
[1:34:58] hallelujah that's the only remedy
[1:35:02] don't apply and turn a new page
[1:35:05] just get a new life
[1:35:09] christ is the answer amen
[1:35:12] very late under the juniper tree
[1:35:15] he didn't know what to do his nerves was
[1:35:17] broke he was
[1:35:18] shaking he was crying no doubt
[1:35:22] and he was in a terrible condition
[1:35:25] many of us hit those places especially
[1:35:29] after a mount carmel experience
[1:35:34] that's the me the other day by someone
[1:35:37] about that
[1:35:39] and how what would we what can we be
[1:35:42] done
[1:35:42] and what can be done for us at that time
[1:35:46] there's only one thing to do commit
[1:35:48] yourself to god
[1:35:50] amen now i know that a man can overwork
[1:35:55] and himself man could underwork himself
[1:35:58] a man god knowed this man need feeding
[1:36:02] he needed something to eat
[1:36:06] and honor this place here where he was
[1:36:07] laying god
[1:36:09] had to do something for him
[1:36:12] god has to do something for every man
[1:36:15] that comes under the juniper tree
[1:36:17] or he'll go to pieces he has to do it
[1:36:21] if his servant's laying another tree
[1:36:23] yonder don't know what to do
[1:36:25] he's carried out his commission elijah
[1:36:28] said oh
[1:36:29] lord let me die
[1:36:32] i've had those feelings after come out
[1:36:35] of a meeting
[1:36:37] and look like i tried and preached and
[1:36:40] begged and persuaded
[1:36:44] seen the angel of god sweep to a meeting
[1:36:47] and do signs and wonders and sit in a
[1:36:50] car on the outside in your gosh i wasn't
[1:36:52] in the psychology
[1:36:54] there's nothing to it not under that
[1:36:56] that's all nonsense
[1:36:59] oh then i'll crawl under the juniper
[1:37:02] tree
[1:37:03] i think lord what did you what'd you let
[1:37:05] me
[1:37:06] do it for what can it be done but we all
[1:37:09] hit
[1:37:09] those experiences but the mercy of
[1:37:13] jehovah to his servant
[1:37:16] god knows your trials just know this he
[1:37:19] knows all about it
[1:37:23] so he comes down he knows his servant
[1:37:26] needs some rest
[1:37:29] so he just puts him to sleep for a
[1:37:31] little while
[1:37:33] while he's laying there waiting to
[1:37:35] recuperate her
[1:37:36] praying to die lord my father's died
[1:37:40] before me
[1:37:41] and now take my life i've done done
[1:37:45] enough i've fought a good fight i've
[1:37:47] finished the course
[1:37:48] but there was work to be done yet god
[1:37:51] wasn't through with his prophet
[1:37:53] he still had work no matter how much we
[1:37:57] cry out and
[1:37:58] think this that other nothing can take
[1:38:00] us until
[1:38:01] god is finished with us
[1:38:04] i'm so glad to know that
[1:38:07] sometimes you feel like as i did one
[1:38:10] time
[1:38:10] put a pistol against my head to commit
[1:38:12] suicide
[1:38:13] but i couldn't do it i took my glove off
[1:38:16] the lead on a
[1:38:17] high voltage line where i was working
[1:38:19] but i couldn't do it
[1:38:22] something still helped the same
[1:38:25] god that was with elijah that same
[1:38:28] god today you see me under the juniper
[1:38:32] tree
[1:38:33] my wife and baby laying here in the
[1:38:34] grave and my daddy and my brother and i
[1:38:37] oh i was just about gone myself
[1:38:42] i've later the juniper tree it's hard
[1:38:47] i got to a place i saw beside myself
[1:38:50] i'll try to make a gun shoot my brains
[1:38:52] out and it wouldn't do it
[1:38:55] see there's work yet to be done
[1:38:59] something has to be done god wasn't
[1:39:02] finished he'll always take care of you
[1:39:09] poor tired weary servant
[1:39:12] he saw him he knowed where he was
[1:39:16] he knows where you're at tonight you may
[1:39:19] be under a juniper tree
[1:39:21] everything's gone but remember he knows
[1:39:23] where you're at
[1:39:26] we don't need a whole lot of re-fix it
[1:39:29] up
[1:39:30] like the old colored woman sat down in
[1:39:32] the south
[1:39:35] she had an accident a card hit her
[1:39:38] and it was it hurt her pretty bad
[1:39:41] and the lawyer said you want to sue for
[1:39:43] damages
[1:39:45] she said lossy mercy no honey so that
[1:39:48] has enough damage i want some repair
[1:39:51] and i think she spoke well for this
[1:39:54] community in this
[1:39:55] church tonight in this hell bound
[1:39:58] america
[1:39:59] amen it ain't backslidden it's already
[1:40:02] gone
[1:40:03] it ain't it ain't on its road to hell
[1:40:06] it's already met hell
[1:40:09] it ain't lost going to be lost it's
[1:40:11] already lost
[1:40:16] it doesn't need a sue for damages it
[1:40:19] needs a repair a truth
[1:40:23] he knows where you are he knows where
[1:40:27] you're land
[1:40:28] and he sent an angel and the angel
[1:40:32] touched him and he went to sleep
[1:40:35] and when he woke up there was some
[1:40:38] corn cakes or some kind of cakes baked
[1:40:40] lamb with the side of him
[1:40:43] and he said elijah rise up and eat
[1:40:46] there's a grace of
[1:40:47] god to his servant see he's
[1:40:50] resting him you know jesus said come
[1:40:53] aside
[1:40:54] into the wilderness and let's rest a
[1:40:56] little while
[1:40:58] some of these guys that think you don't
[1:40:59] have to rest we find out they burn out
[1:41:01] pretty quick too
[1:41:05] they don't think arrests they find
[1:41:07] themselves wrecked up somewhere
[1:41:10] i think that's where our brother billy
[1:41:12] grimm is tonight
[1:41:14] kind over shoot the mark these human
[1:41:17] bodies are strong but they need
[1:41:19] rest then you can take a little rest and
[1:41:22] go somewhere they'll criticize you say i
[1:41:24] thought he's a preacher look at him out
[1:41:26] on the bank fishing or
[1:41:28] something like that but that doesn't
[1:41:30] matter
[1:41:33] jehovah will take care of his own
[1:41:36] while he was laying there under the tree
[1:41:40] weary and upset god quietened his nerves
[1:41:43] he fed him woke him up again and fed him
[1:41:46] again
[1:41:47] and put him back to sleep you know i've
[1:41:49] often wondered
[1:41:50] what was in those cakes
[1:41:53] what kind of a vitamin did he get in
[1:41:55] those cakes
[1:41:58] however whatever there was in there it
[1:42:00] lasted him 40 days and 40 nights
[1:42:04] he went in the strength of those cakes
[1:42:07] god knows tonight i need some of them
[1:42:10] and i'm sure that this church needs some
[1:42:13] of them
[1:42:14] come aside away from the world and let's
[1:42:17] rest around
[1:42:18] let's talk a while you don't have time
[1:42:22] to rest you say john wesley said that
[1:42:25] one time
[1:42:26] he said i'm afraid to rest i ain't got
[1:42:29] time to rest
[1:42:31] and you find yourself broke up if you
[1:42:33] don't take these rests
[1:42:47] that's where we started from
[1:42:51] so it gets it's good as you know
[1:42:55] from last time you know there's
[1:43:00] little words of wisdom and
[1:43:05] and when you listen to a tape you know
[1:43:10] it's it's so important sometimes just to
[1:43:12] listen to every little statement
[1:43:15] and you know that he
[1:43:18] he said that if you have a
[1:43:21] a mount carmel experience you just
[1:43:24] better be ready
[1:43:26] for the juniper trees coming
[1:43:31] you know when you feel on top of the
[1:43:33] mountain and you feel
[1:43:34] everything's going good he said watch
[1:43:36] out you're going to find yourself
[1:43:39] under a juniper tree and you know
[1:43:43] sometimes we
[1:43:44] if we take that as being
[1:43:48] something that is uh
[1:43:52] a negative or wrong that we did
[1:43:55] something wrong but there's a purpose
[1:43:57] for it
[1:43:58] there there's a reason for it because
[1:44:00] when he went when he went there
[1:44:03] under that juniper tree if you know
[1:44:06] eventually it caused them to go
[1:44:09] to the cave and hear from god
[1:44:13] you know but he also says something that
[1:44:15] i i took he said you know
[1:44:17] you've got to have rest
[1:44:20] he said you can overwork he said you can
[1:44:23] underwork too but he said you can
[1:44:25] overwork
[1:44:27] and he says and you've got to rest and
[1:44:29] you know
[1:44:30] that rest is if you when you begin to
[1:44:34] talk about it
[1:44:34] he says you've got to get alone and
[1:44:36] you've got to just quiet
[1:44:38] your spirit just rest
[1:44:42] you know someone that's always you know
[1:44:46] carrying on they've always got to say
[1:44:48] something they've always got to talk
[1:44:49] they've always got to have the amen
[1:44:52] they've always got to shout you
[1:44:53] you find out really uh it's those that
[1:44:58] maybe don't have that deep experience
[1:45:00] you know what i mean because they
[1:45:02] they just haven't got alone with
[1:45:05] the lord and found that peace they're
[1:45:08] like whistling in a graveyard
[1:45:10] you know what i mean they need and
[1:45:12] that's what he's saying you need to get
[1:45:14] to that place
[1:45:15] where you rest and and he calms your
[1:45:18] nerves and you
[1:45:19] you you spend that time alone with them
[1:45:23] and you rest your spirit and you get
[1:45:26] away from all the
[1:45:28] uh the the trials and
[1:45:31] er and all under the juniper tree said
[1:45:34] he
[1:45:34] he got in that juniper tree he got in
[1:45:37] that condition where
[1:45:38] he just had such a great experience did
[1:45:41] you hear the prophet of god
[1:45:42] he said i come out of those meetings and
[1:45:44] i do all those things
[1:45:46] and then i'd sit there in the car crying
[1:45:48] say it's a bunch of nonsense
[1:45:53] you understand so i mean if you don't
[1:45:55] understand
[1:45:56] that in your lives that it's not always
[1:45:58] a mountaintop
[1:46:01] it's not always a victory every day if
[1:46:04] you're a christian
[1:46:05] you're going to find yourself under
[1:46:07] those juniper trees
[1:46:09] you're going to have those experiences
[1:46:11] but what did he said god knows where
[1:46:13] you're at
[1:46:14] he knows what's he trying to do he's
[1:46:16] trying to get you to get you
[1:46:19] to rest
[1:46:22] get you just to be still and know that
[1:46:25] i'm god
[1:46:26] get you to a place where you can what
[1:46:28] listen
[1:46:30] brother man preaches a message called
[1:46:32] hear ye him
[1:46:34] and he says you know we do all the
[1:46:36] talking
[1:46:38] and we never listen we we do all the
[1:46:41] saying we do
[1:46:42] all the we do all the carrying on and
[1:46:45] the
[1:46:46] and and going going going you know we
[1:46:49] get excited about something and god's
[1:46:51] moving
[1:46:52] and we talk and talk and talk about it
[1:46:54] and then if we're not
[1:46:56] careful all of a sudden it seems like
[1:46:58] the wind's gone out of the sail
[1:47:01] he's still god you're still on the sea
[1:47:04] he said remember the ocean it was all in
[1:47:07] the upward he says for there's not
[1:47:09] one more ounce of water in that ocean
[1:47:12] than there was when it was going through
[1:47:14] the revival
[1:47:15] there's not one less god in you when
[1:47:18] you're under the juniper tree
[1:47:19] as there is in you when you're on the
[1:47:21] mountaintop
[1:47:24] it's not measured by that he say even in
[1:47:27] that tape he said
[1:47:28] it's measured by the heart that's inside
[1:47:31] of you
[1:47:32] and you know so that when you come to
[1:47:35] these places
[1:47:36] and and you realize that it's not it
[1:47:39] it's not always trying to climb to that
[1:47:42] mountaintop it's not always
[1:47:44] trying to climb up there to that victory
[1:47:46] it's not always trying to press that
[1:47:49] we don't have to preach to you every
[1:47:51] time to try to get on a mountaintop we
[1:47:54] don't have to
[1:47:54] preach to try to get up to to have some
[1:47:58] experience but what we want to know is
[1:48:00] we want to come to that place
[1:48:02] where we know when we're down in the
[1:48:04] valley that god's in the valley with
[1:48:07] us he knows where we're at he's got a
[1:48:10] purpose and everything he allows and
[1:48:12] everything he's done
[1:48:13] he's just not on the mountain he's in
[1:48:15] the valleys too
[1:48:17] he's under the juniper trees
[1:48:20] and and you know what he does was is he
[1:48:23] leads you to a cave
[1:48:26] that's what he said there was three
[1:48:28] parts to it the mountaintop experience
[1:48:32] that we all have and he says after that
[1:48:35] you better be ready because if you have
[1:48:38] a mountaintop experience you better be
[1:48:40] ready for a juniper tree
[1:48:43] you better be ready for to find yourself
[1:48:46] down in the dumps and to find yourself
[1:48:48] with a letdown
[1:48:50] and to find yourself back to the reality
[1:48:53] that you're just a human being
[1:48:55] especially when god moves through you
[1:48:57] and you know it's god and
[1:48:58] and you you say things and you feel that
[1:49:01] anointing
[1:49:02] and the power of god and you just feel
[1:49:04] like boy i just testified
[1:49:06] and i prayed for somebody and they got
[1:49:08] healed and
[1:49:09] and i led someone to the lord and we
[1:49:11] baptized them
[1:49:13] and all those things don't be don't get
[1:49:15] shocked
[1:49:18] when you hit a desert spot or you hit a
[1:49:21] dry spell
[1:49:23] don't let that throw you don't go
[1:49:26] running
[1:49:27] and trying to find another mountain he's
[1:49:30] there with you under the juniper tree
[1:49:35] you know you don't have to look at la we
[1:49:36] don't have to say okay we better beat it
[1:49:38] up again we better get another meeting
[1:49:40] here we better get something
[1:49:42] else going on it doesn't matter praise
[1:49:44] god for the mountaintops
[1:49:46] but you know god he's got a reason
[1:49:49] that he doesn't let a person stay up
[1:49:52] there all the time
[1:49:55] you know why because they get to
[1:49:56] thinking it's themselves
[1:49:58] they get to thinking that they're the
[1:50:00] ones that's doing it and they're the
[1:50:02] ones that's got the power
[1:50:03] and they're the ones that are chosen and
[1:50:06] elected
[1:50:08] it's all by grace
[1:50:12] but it's all by grace all by mercy
[1:50:16] and so when we find ourselves down it
[1:50:18] doesn't make us any less of a preacher
[1:50:21] doesn't make us any less a believer it
[1:50:25] doesn't mean that we love him any less
[1:50:28] he does it that way because he wants to
[1:50:32] get us to a cave
[1:50:34] he wants to feed us those cakes
[1:50:38] give us some more word give us some
[1:50:41] deeper understanding
[1:50:42] give us some things the prophet of god
[1:50:45] said
[1:50:46] sometimes we go through these schools of
[1:50:48] suffering so we know how other people
[1:50:50] feel you know you go through the
[1:50:54] ups and the downs so when you see the
[1:50:57] ups and the downs you're not
[1:50:58] you're not worried about things you're
[1:51:01] not moved about things
[1:51:04] people that have been in this message
[1:51:06] brother gary's probably been
[1:51:07] in the message longer in any of us in
[1:51:10] here
[1:51:10] but here how many things are we some
[1:51:12] coming down the river
[1:51:14] how many different movements were going
[1:51:15] to take us there how many different
[1:51:17] doctrines
[1:51:18] was going to be the answer how many
[1:51:20] great exciting revivals did we
[1:51:23] see spin through the land that this is
[1:51:25] it this is
[1:51:26] it this is what we've got to have this
[1:51:28] is the revelation
[1:51:29] we've seen so many mountaintops
[1:51:32] that that's the only place we think god
[1:51:35] is
[1:51:38] when you're when you're into that
[1:51:39] juniper tree you can have as much
[1:51:41] fellowship with god as you can
[1:51:46] anytime like he said brother beeler i
[1:51:49] from what i gather he must have had
[1:51:52] something done
[1:51:53] hurt his arm in some way and and and he
[1:51:56] was rejoicing that
[1:51:58] god uh showed him what life would be
[1:52:01] like without that arm and
[1:52:02] and things like that see there's
[1:52:04] wonderful things that come
[1:52:05] anyplace in your life because he knows
[1:52:08] where you are
[1:52:09] he knows how to talk to you he knows how
[1:52:12] to speak to you he's not forsaking you
[1:52:14] or left you because your things have not
[1:52:17] gone the way that we think they ought to
[1:52:20] but we see what he's always going to do
[1:52:22] he's always going to press us into that
[1:52:25] place to that cave where we seek his
[1:52:29] face
[1:52:31] and he's always got a still small
[1:52:34] voice for us when we don't know what to
[1:52:37] do
[1:52:38] or we seem to not know what's going on
[1:52:43] just remember he's still the god of the
[1:52:45] mountain
[1:52:47] it's still god in the valley
[1:52:50] they sing that song i i like
[1:52:53] so much you know no matter where i am
[1:52:58] he's god no matter where i am you know
[1:53:00] the song
[1:53:01] i'm trying to talk about about in the
[1:53:03] storm he's the god of the storm
[1:53:06] i mean that's the kind of god he is that
[1:53:08] that's what we've got to know
[1:53:10] and i i think that that it's that solid
[1:53:15] steady person
[1:53:19] you know i like to see a guy that's got
[1:53:21] some years behind him
[1:53:24] you know what i mean that that that
[1:53:28] year after year after year after year
[1:53:31] he's just
[1:53:32] trying to serve god through in and outs
[1:53:35] and through struggles
[1:53:36] okay i don't know if you guys ever used
[1:53:39] the
[1:53:39] phrase but we used to use it out
[1:53:43] when i was in electrical doing

[1:54:49] amen
[1:54:50] that's the god that i want to know he's
[1:54:52] been through the valleys he's been
[1:54:54] through the
[1:54:54] he's been through the trials he's been
[1:54:56] through he's been in the cave
[1:54:58] and he's heard god talk to him that's
[1:55:01] where character is
[1:55:03] that's what you're going to take with
[1:55:05] you we don't always take the mountain
[1:55:08] top experiences you know if it's
[1:55:11] sometimes it's
[1:55:12] i like it when we i've heard the
[1:55:14] testimonies last
[1:55:15] week you know i was down and i cried out
[1:55:20] and god heard me
[1:55:23] you know it's not always doesn't have to
[1:55:25] be i did this and i did that and i did
[1:55:28] this and i did that
[1:55:30] okay and everything you know a real
[1:55:32] testimony is not what you've done for
[1:55:33] god anyway it's what god's done for you
[1:55:36] that that's a real testimony that that's
[1:55:40] really so
[1:55:40] don't don't don't worry some of some of
[1:55:43] you have been under the juniper maybe
[1:55:44] you've been under there for a while
[1:55:47] maybe there's sickness you've been under
[1:55:48] a while maybe there's financial
[1:55:50] struggles
[1:55:51] you've been under a while god still
[1:55:53] knows where you are
[1:55:55] amen he's got a still small voice coming
[1:55:58] for you
[1:55:59] if you'll just stay there if you'll stay
[1:56:01] true to them if you'll just stay
[1:56:04] there and and and prove it out for a
[1:56:06] while
[1:56:08] you know prove that you're back prove
[1:56:11] that this is the time prove this is for
[1:56:14] real
[1:56:16] you know let someone see you in the
[1:56:17] storm
[1:56:21] that's what the juniper tree is for
[1:56:24] that's what the storms
[1:56:25] are for so you can prove you're really
[1:56:28] who you are
[1:56:29] not who you say you are not how you
[1:56:32] describe your own
[1:56:33] experience i'm a believer
[1:56:37] be a believer
[1:56:42] you know what i mean that's why they're
[1:56:43] there they're there to give you an
[1:56:46] opportunity
[1:56:47] to prove that you stick with it through
[1:56:51] through thick and thin kind of like a
[1:56:53] marriage valve
[1:56:56] you know for better for worse well you
[1:56:58] took that vow don't think you're only
[1:57:00] going to get the better
[1:57:04] i know exactly what that bow means for
[1:57:06] better for worse i got the better leslie
[1:57:09] got the worst
[1:57:12] work worked out perfect for me
[1:57:15] i thought that was a pretty good vow i
[1:57:18] got the best part of that deal
[1:57:21] but that's why these things are there
[1:57:24] because where does character come from
[1:57:27] the fiery furnace of affliction
[1:57:30] and what's the only thing you're going
[1:57:31] to take with you is your character
[1:57:35] that which has been proven
[1:57:38] by testing and by trial peter said it
[1:57:42] this way thinking not strange that the
[1:57:44] fiery darts the
[1:57:45] enemy that the trying of your
[1:57:49] faith is more precious than gold
[1:57:53] so there's a lot of things in this tape
[1:57:55] tonight
[1:57:56] that you need rest
[1:58:00] you know you don't you you don't think
[1:58:02] you need rest
[1:58:04] now i'm just talking about sleeping you
[1:58:07] need to stop
[1:58:10] and rest and be still
[1:58:13] in the presence of the lord sometimes we
[1:58:16] struggle
[1:58:17] struggle to gain spiritual height to
[1:58:20] become more like god
[1:58:22] we read more we prayed more you hear him
[1:58:24] say he even said it you can study study
[1:58:27] and study
[1:58:27] but that's without what you need
[1:58:32] just to be still and know he's god
[1:58:37] just to know he knows your valley he
[1:58:40] knows your trouble
[1:58:41] he knows what's on your heart he knows
[1:58:44] what you've been crying out for
[1:58:46] he knows what tree you're under we all
[1:58:48] pack up some burden
[1:58:51] there's a cross that's that's a
[1:58:54] portion of suffering that's allotted to
[1:58:58] all of us
[1:58:59] all them that are godly in christ jesus
[1:59:02] shall suffer
[1:59:04] but it's there but he's still god
[1:59:08] and he still knows where you are and he
[1:59:11] still has an answer
[1:59:13] and and i'm telling you that
[1:59:16] that mountaintop experience
[1:59:20] i love them i i love them
[1:59:25] okay you know and and i know the
[1:59:29] ministers know it too
[1:59:31] and i know that now that the church
[1:59:34] is moving to where the laity
[1:59:37] is going to be doing the same signs and
[1:59:40] wonders that the preachers are doing
[1:59:42] that the laity is going to be winning
[1:59:44] souls to the lord
[1:59:46] just like the preachers win souls to the
[1:59:48] lord
[1:59:49] that the maturity is coming for every
[1:59:52] believer
[1:59:53] that they become in union with christ
[1:59:55] where
[1:59:56] the signs and wonders aren't following
[1:59:58] the minister they're following whosoever
[2:00:00] believes
[2:00:02] when we see people praying on the street
[2:00:05] out there like we saw today and you
[2:00:07] finally you've got to know the
[2:00:09] enemy is going to come right behind you
[2:00:12] and say you hypocrite who are you to be
[2:00:15] testifying
[2:00:16] who are you to be talking he's going to
[2:00:18] try to push you
[2:00:20] down in that juniper tree he's going to
[2:00:23] try to
[2:00:24] rob you what did he say he's going to
[2:00:26] rob you of
[2:00:27] all the confidence that you had on
[2:00:30] sunday
[2:00:34] be ready for the confidence robber
[2:00:38] that's what he is he breaks into your
[2:00:40] house
[2:00:41] like a thief and tries to steal
[2:00:44] everything away from you
[2:00:46] you go through those things if you know
[2:00:49] him
[2:00:50] and you you know and that's what he said
[2:00:52] how do you overcome
[2:00:54] you know it the satan at every one of
[2:00:56] his tricks
[2:00:58] so all what you say well what's the
[2:01:01] answer to it
[2:01:02] rest what was the answer to the juniper
[2:01:06] tree
[2:01:08] rest eat some cake

[2:02:46] and i just think of all the good things
[2:02:50] and i just start thinking about him and
[2:02:53] pretty soon what it don't matter if the
[2:02:54] people hate me
[2:02:59] right he loves me
[2:03:02] it don't matter if if they criticize me
[2:03:05] and it doesn't matter if i'm feeling
[2:03:08] full of failures they're not my people
[2:03:10] anyway
[2:03:11] they're his people and then i just
[2:03:15] remember i'm not serving them for honor
[2:03:17] i'm not serving them for presidents i'm
[2:03:20] not supportive i'm serving them because
[2:03:22] i love them
[2:03:24] and i want to i want to i want to tell
[2:03:26] people the truth
[2:03:28] and pretty soon all the burdens go away
[2:03:31] and just a few moments in his presence
[2:03:34] and you're full of rest again
[2:03:36] and you're full of peace again
[2:03:41] you know and i like what brother branham
[2:03:43] said
[2:03:44] he said i preached to more tired people
[2:03:48] i preached the more snickering laughing
[2:03:50] teenagers than you could ever
[2:03:53] imagine more note writers and
[2:03:56] pencil dryers and yeah and
[2:04:00] thought wanderers but guess what
[2:04:04] he knows where every one of them is at
[2:04:07] and it's his duty
[2:04:09] and it's it's it's it's good
[2:04:12] and god's good so understand that
[2:04:17] because and i i want to say it
[2:04:20] like this you're all entering into the
[2:04:24] end time ministry
[2:04:27] because the last ministry on this earth
[2:04:29] is the bride
[2:04:33] the age ends and it becomes the bright
[2:04:37] age
[2:04:38] and the last one that ministers is the
[2:04:41] bride
[2:04:42] of the lord jesus and
[2:04:46] she lives with
[2:04:49] everything that's a part of it just like
[2:04:52] you kids at school
[2:04:53] you get one of your friends in the
[2:04:55] hallway and they open that door
[2:04:58] you tell them about the lord and you
[2:05:00] testify why you have long hair why you
[2:05:03] why you wear dresses what you believe
[2:05:06] you pour your heart out
[2:05:07] out to them and you can just feel like
[2:05:10] god's just standing inside of you
[2:05:14] well you're speaking in fact you you
[2:05:16] even feel like you're
[2:05:18] preaching to yourself that you just want
[2:05:20] to sit down and listen to yourself
[2:05:22] talk about the gospel things come out of
[2:05:25] your mind
[2:05:26] things come out of your heart that that
[2:05:28] you don't even know where they're come
[2:05:30] from you didn't even know you thought so
[2:05:32] good
[2:05:32] you didn't even know you could put it
[2:05:34] together so good you're just on
[2:05:36] you're on that mountaintop listen here
[2:05:38] friend i'm gonna tell you about the god
[2:05:40] that you don't know about you know what
[2:05:42] i mean and god did this
[2:05:44] and god did this and god sent a
[2:05:45] messenger and this is why we do this and
[2:05:48] we don't cut our hair but it's a
[2:05:49] nazarite balance
[2:05:52] and all of a sudden
[2:05:56] there you are and you say what
[2:05:59] did i just do
[2:06:04] what did i just say what are the
[2:06:07] consequences
[2:06:09] of this
[2:06:14] and and if you if you don't understand
[2:06:17] it
[2:06:20] that's when you get under that juniper
[2:06:22] tree
[2:06:23] and the best way to take care of it is
[2:06:26] you get to that cave
[2:06:30] that where he took him i took him to
[2:06:32] that cave
[2:06:33] to get some rest some eat some cakes
[2:06:37] to fortify you again that you can get
[2:06:41] that rest in that piece
[2:06:42] and you can sit there and says you know
[2:06:44] lord what i told my friend was the truth
[2:06:48] and i don't care what the consequences
[2:06:50] are
[2:06:51] renew me strengthen me because i believe
[2:06:54] this
[2:06:55] with all my heart and when you know how
[2:06:59] to handle it
[2:07:01] then you're more victorious
[2:07:04] than ever to be able to stand
[2:07:08] and to preach because you know he's
[2:07:10] coming after you
[2:07:13] but you know what it don't shake you a
[2:07:15] bit
[2:07:16] why because i have a cave
[2:07:21] i have a place i can run to i have a
[2:07:23] place i can hide
[2:07:25] i have a place in the storm where i have
[2:07:28] cakes that can feed me and
[2:07:33] renew me come unto me
[2:07:36] all you that are heavy laden and i'll
[2:07:39] give you rest
[2:07:41] amen i just i i was this tape
[2:07:45] just meant a lot to me personally and i
[2:07:48] i hope that it
[2:07:49] helps you and you can share it um
[2:07:52] with your loved ones because every now
[2:07:55] and then if you're in a marriage
[2:07:57] one of your partners will fall into the
[2:08:00] dump
[2:08:01] and you just gotta help them i mean i i
[2:08:04] can't help it but there's a dump there
[2:08:06] i don't know you guys ever used that
[2:08:08] turn terminology down in the dumps
[2:08:11] you know have you ever been to a dump
[2:08:13] it's a big hole in the ground
[2:08:14] full of trash of course nowadays there's
[2:08:17] so much trash it's become a mountain but
[2:08:20] nevertheless that's what it is
[2:08:23] and and but if you just go to the cave
[2:08:27] you know what you do you go to the cave
[2:08:30] with them
[2:08:31] and you rest and you wait on the lord
[2:08:33] you quiet your spirit too
[2:08:36] you eat those cakes too you create that
[2:08:39] atmosphere too
[2:08:40] and then pretty soon you walk out you
[2:08:43] put your mantle on
[2:08:44] and you're ready to hear from god again
[2:08:46] amen
[2:08:47] the lord bless you tonight amen i didn't
[2:08:50] know i just wanted to give an
[2:08:51] opportunity if anybody
[2:08:53] felt that they really wanted to testify
[2:08:55] last week and they
[2:08:57] didn't have an opportunity i i'd like to
[2:09:00] give
[2:09:00] the opportunity there if nobody has a
[2:09:02] testimony i
[2:09:04] i certainly understand that it's kind of
[2:09:07] right on the spot but anyway i i just
[2:09:11] like to testify that
[2:09:12] that i spend a lot of time under the
[2:09:15] juniper tree
[2:09:16] but he's dug me out of there a lot of
[2:09:17] times too and there's a lot of blessings
[2:09:20] in the cave did anybody don't want to
[2:09:23] testify that mr go ahead
[2:09:44] saints um i don't even know where to
[2:09:48] start
[2:09:49] so the lord put on my heart this
[2:09:53] scripture
[2:09:55] the the weekend we we had at the camp
[2:09:57] that
[2:09:58] we were out in louisiana there and the
[2:10:01] way the lord moved and spoke to me
[2:10:04] like never before it's in ezekiel
[2:10:07] chapter 37
[2:10:09] he says the hand of the lord was upon me
[2:10:11] and carried me out
[2:10:13] in the spirit of the lord and set me
[2:10:14] down in the midst of the valley
[2:10:16] which was full of bones and caused me to
[2:10:19] pass by them round about
[2:10:20] and behold there were very many in the
[2:10:23] open valley
[2:10:24] and lo they were very dry and he said
[2:10:26] unto me son of man can these bones live
[2:10:29] and i answered o lord god thou knowest
[2:10:31] again he said unto me prophesy
[2:10:34] upon these bones and say unto them o ye
[2:10:36] dry bones hear the word of the lord
[2:10:38] thus saith the lord god unto these bones
[2:10:41] behold i will
[2:10:42] cause breath to enter into you and ye
[2:10:44] shall live
[2:10:45] and i will lay sinews upon you and will
[2:10:47] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[2:10:49] with skin
[2:10:50] and put breath in you and ye shall live
[2:10:53] and ye shall know that i am the lord so
[2:10:56] i prophesied as i was commanded
[2:10:58] and as i prophesied there was a noise
[2:11:00] and behold the shaking and the bones
[2:11:02] came together
[2:11:03] bone to his bone and when i beheld lo
[2:11:06] the sinews in the flesh came up upon
[2:11:08] them and the skin
[2:11:09] covered them above but there was no
[2:11:11] breath in them
[2:11:12] then he said unto me prophesy unto the
[2:11:15] wind prophesy son of man
[2:11:17] and say to the wind thus saith the lord
[2:11:18] god come from the four winds o
[2:11:20] breath and breathe upon the slain
[2:11:24] that they may live so i prophesied as he
[2:11:26] commanded me and the breath came unto
[2:11:28] them
[2:11:29] and they lived and stood up upon their
[2:11:31] feet an exceeding great army
[2:11:34] then he says then he said unto me son of
[2:11:36] man these bones are the whole house of
[2:11:38] israel behold they say our bones are
[2:11:40] dried
[2:11:41] and our hope is lost we are cut off for
[2:11:43] our parts
[2:11:45] cut off for our parts so the lord was
[2:11:48] speaking to me because
[2:11:49] sometimes i find we get in a condition
[2:11:52] where
[2:11:53] the devil says we're dead there's no
[2:11:56] hope
[2:11:57] there's no life there's no way to get
[2:11:59] out of it
[2:12:00] sermon that brother andrew spencer
[2:12:02] preached ain't no grave gonna hold my
[2:12:03] body down
[2:12:05] spoke so loud to me personally
[2:12:08] because seeing the condition uh
[2:12:12] this a lot of my club close friends and
[2:12:15] family are in that you know some some
[2:12:17] are in the grave
[2:12:18] some may be in a dead condition the
[2:12:19] devil may be whispering in my ear
[2:12:22] that oh well there's no hope for them
[2:12:24] does not even hope for you
[2:12:26] and whatnot but i heard here he said
[2:12:28] prophesied to these dead bones and
[2:12:29] they'll live
[2:12:30] i don't know if y'all read that but
[2:12:32] that's what i heard so in the next
[2:12:34] when i read when i read that and the
[2:12:36] minister was preaching
[2:12:38] i felt i was filled with so much joy
[2:12:41] and to see my sister there at the altar
[2:12:45] confirmed everything and then he says in
[2:12:49] chapter chapter 12 therefore prophesy
[2:12:51] and say unto them thus saith the lord
[2:12:53] god behold all my people i will open
[2:12:56] your graves and cause you to come up out
[2:12:58] of your graves
[2:12:59] and bring you into the land of israel
[2:13:02] the way the way this scripture was
[2:13:04] revealed to me is
[2:13:05] the grave is the condition you're in so
[2:13:08] you can be the grave could be
[2:13:09] the sin that's bothering you whether
[2:13:11] you're in drugs
[2:13:13] whether you're in lust whether whatever
[2:13:15] the condition you're in
[2:13:16] that's the grave you're in the lord says
[2:13:18] here that he'll take you out of that
[2:13:19] grave
[2:13:20] and i i was like lord you've done it
[2:13:23] over and over
[2:13:24] and over and over and over again
[2:13:27] but yet for some reason when a new grave
[2:13:30] presents itself
[2:13:32] something says can can god still do it
[2:13:35] can he still do it but he said he'd
[2:13:37] never leave me
[2:13:38] he'd never forsake me would he be with
[2:13:40] me even in me until the end
[2:13:42] i just want to give you all words of
[2:13:43] encouragement and let you know
[2:13:45] it doesn't matter what grave you're in
[2:13:46] doesn't matter what condition you're in
[2:13:48] doesn't matter how dry your loved ones
[2:13:50] may be the lord said son of man prophesy
[2:14:01] you know when our brother shared that it
[2:14:03] brought back to my mind real quick
[2:14:06] in that tape uh you know you you
[2:14:09] you get that impending doom there's one
[2:14:12] more thing out there that's going to get
[2:14:14] me
[2:14:14] remember that girl she was walking and
[2:14:17] all of a sudden she felt the dread
[2:14:19] she felt that through me she said all of
[2:14:22] a sudden this guy appeared
[2:14:24] he said but god provided a dog
[2:14:28] right and he uses things and what did he
[2:14:30] say he says he's your protector
[2:14:33] amen i like that brother because that's
[2:14:36] what we've got to believe we got to
[2:14:37] believe all things are possible
[2:14:39] anybody else wanted to testify and they
[2:14:41] didn't have a chance or they got a
[2:14:44] chance or that they would like to
[2:14:45] testify somebody knew
[2:14:53] you kelly you got here just bring her
[2:14:54] the mic that probably work just as easy
[2:14:57] here oh you got one okay great
[2:15:00] we'll do it that way and then make it
[2:15:02] simple
[2:15:07] and you can all crane your neck a little
[2:15:08] bit
[2:15:15] so um i just want to tell y'all uh
[2:15:19] we're you know really thankful to be
[2:15:21] here
[2:15:23] we um
[2:15:27] we are allowed now to um serve the lord
[2:15:30] with
[2:15:31] freedom and peace that we just have not
[2:15:33] known in all our lives
[2:15:34] we talk about it all the time
[2:15:38] when we share that with our sons our
[2:15:41] oldest boy we're like levi we we never
[2:15:44] we never had this
[2:15:46] we appreciate our pastor and how the
[2:15:49] word is so
[2:15:52] so pure so balanced
[2:15:57] anna
[2:16:02] the lord's brought us to a real place of
[2:16:04] peace
[2:16:07] so one day i was sitting in church and
[2:16:08] uh it's been it's been a month or so and
[2:16:11] um
[2:16:12] he dropped that scripture and thou has
[2:16:14] brought me into a large place
[2:16:17] and i knew i didn't think it so i
[2:16:19] thought oh that sounds like the word i
[2:16:21] go and find it it's a scripture where
[2:16:22] brother david said
[2:16:24] thou has brought me into a large place
[2:16:26] and i
[2:16:27] that's what he's done for us here
[2:16:31] so we had you know our son been
[2:16:34] uh decided he's gonna go wild
[2:16:38] and he got in trouble with cocaine and
[2:16:42] was telling us about it and i knew that
[2:16:44] the greatest thing i had was prayer
[2:16:47] and so i kept praying and praying and
[2:16:50] the last
[2:16:51] few weeks i just started praying lord
[2:16:53] just bring him home
[2:16:55] bring him home he needs to be home and
[2:16:58] uh i turned in a anonymous
[2:17:02] request in church here i knew if i could
[2:17:05] just get the prayer before the people
[2:17:07] because every single prayer request i've
[2:17:09] turned in has been answered
[2:17:11] so that was a thursday and i thought if
[2:17:12] i can just make it till sunday
[2:17:14] that you know get that prayer before the
[2:17:16] people
[2:17:18] and that was a sunday i turned it in and
[2:17:20] that night
[2:17:21] um brother david said it was sunday
[2:17:24] night and he said why don't we just
[2:17:25] you know sing a little while why we just
[2:17:28] entertained the lord
[2:17:29] and so we were singing a little while
[2:17:32] and
[2:17:33] my phone had a text pop up and i do look
[2:17:36] at it in case it was him
[2:17:38] and i got the text before i left the
[2:17:40] sanctuary mom i need to come home
[2:17:44] i need to get well i need i need to get
[2:17:47] off of cocaine i need to get myself
[2:17:49] straightened out
[2:17:50] well at this point he is trying to do it
[2:17:52] by himself but i'm still glad he's safe
[2:17:55] he's he's with us he's being cooperative
[2:17:58] and it's still a mighty answer to prayer
[2:18:00] that he's that we've got this part of
[2:18:02] the package
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:07] anyway there's been brothers here that
[2:18:10] there's brothers that have spent years
[2:18:12] literally years hanging on for levi
[2:18:15] there's
[2:18:16] they have spent hours and hours of time
[2:18:18] of their life
[2:18:20] and i can't ever thank them enough
[2:18:22] there's brothers that spent
[2:18:24] money lots of money to
[2:18:27] you know to show love to my son there's
[2:18:30] um
[2:18:31] there's a brother that's driven many
[2:18:32] many many miles
[2:18:35] to amarillo too just to see levi
[2:18:38] just prayed lord let me go i just
[2:18:40] appreciate
[2:18:42] as a mother i appreciate that so much i
[2:18:45] we couldn't have imagined that it's
[2:18:46] greater than we could have asked or
[2:18:48] think
[2:18:50] um and so i just want to say
[2:18:54] the rest of my package is coming
[2:18:58] it's an absolute it because god promised
[2:19:01] it so many which aways
[2:19:03] there's no way around it it's the most
[2:19:05] secure thing as our children
[2:19:07] and you if you want to know which ways
[2:19:09] he promised it come ask me
[2:19:11] because i know the quotes i've studied
[2:19:13] the the verses
[2:19:15] and he promised it every which away
[2:19:18] that he could possibly say it levi is
[2:19:21] coming
[2:19:23] and that's a certainty and that's my
[2:19:26] testimony and in the meanwhile i'll wait
[2:19:28] i will wait
[2:19:29] because i ain't too good to wait on the
[2:19:32] lord i will wait for his time
[2:19:34] and i will be a blessing i we we only
[2:19:37] want to be a blessing here we
[2:19:38] we do love you all if there's anything
[2:19:40] we can do for anybody
[2:19:42] let us know we will do it and uh
[2:19:46] my that's my testimony is levi's home
[2:19:48] the rest is coming
[2:19:50] and we love jesus so much amen
[2:20:04] amen isn't that a promise he who starts
[2:20:06] at work
[2:20:07] we'll finish it till the end
[2:20:10] amen amen another testimony
[2:20:28] about probably six months ago it might
[2:20:31] have been less than that
[2:20:32] i don't remember the time or the day
[2:20:36] but we went out of town and i had
[2:20:39] antibiotics that the doctor prescribed
[2:20:41] that i
[2:20:41] i didn't take with me i had forgotten
[2:20:44] them
[2:20:45] and uh i told my wife on the way there
[2:20:49] i forgot my antibiotics you know and
[2:20:52] so i started having some discomfort and
[2:20:54] some pain on the trip there
[2:20:57] and i just i just gave it to the lord i
[2:21:00] told her i said
[2:21:01] it'll be fine you know i i believe that
[2:21:05] by the time we get there it'll be gone
[2:21:09] well it wasn't gone by the time we got
[2:21:10] there but by the time
[2:21:12] we got ready to drive home it was
[2:21:14] completely gone
[2:21:16] and then um we got back here
[2:21:20] and i had uh
[2:21:23] the sitting kind of got to me in my back
[2:21:26] and
[2:21:27] the long services and stuff and
[2:21:30] then we ended up helping you
[2:21:34] and it's just the grace of god because
[2:21:37] my back has been giving me a fit all
[2:21:39] week and then we got out there moving
[2:21:41] around and it went away
[2:21:43] you know and i had been praying about it
[2:21:45] and so just
[2:21:46] i give it to the lord because he he did
[2:21:49] two things for me in a short period of
[2:21:52] time and
[2:21:53] i just thank god for also my son
[2:21:57] and i know he's coming
[2:22:00] amen thank you
[2:22:10] so i hope you caught the lesson if any
[2:22:13] of your
[2:22:14] back pain or your down come work for me
[2:22:16] you know
[2:22:18] you'll feel better no i i know
[2:22:21] let me tell you tommy didn't tell you
[2:22:23] what he was doing
[2:22:25] but he was like lifting
[2:22:28] 60 pound blocks probably
[2:22:31] about 700 of them that we
[2:22:35] set on all that wall that
[2:22:38] in the back and i know the lord was with
[2:22:41] him because the wall's straight you know
[2:22:46] so it really was god really and i really
[2:22:50] thank him for
[2:22:51] all that he did to get in there and help
[2:22:54] so it was really wonderful somebody else
[2:22:56] have a
[2:22:57] a testimony we want sure they want to
[2:23:01] get caught mean
[2:23:05] i want to share a testimony
[2:23:14] i would probably sit here for hours to
[2:23:15] testify but we don't have hours so we're
[2:23:17] going to just take a few minutes
[2:23:19] um you know just like we heard last
[2:23:22] wednesday or last wednesday at the
[2:23:24] church
[2:23:24] services that um prayer meeting on
[2:23:27] tuesday was wonderful if you've never
[2:23:29] been i recommend you come
[2:23:32] but uh brother matthew had asked me to
[2:23:34] come to the prayer meeting and just to
[2:23:36] play the piano
[2:23:38] and i said okay so i get to the prayer
[2:23:41] meeting and
[2:23:42] i'm praying a little bit before i go up
[2:23:43] and
[2:23:45] um i'm going up and i'm starting to play
[2:23:50] and you know the presence of the lord
[2:23:52] came down
[2:23:55] and i believe is maybe around the time
[2:23:58] where even the
[2:23:58] sister that was given the testimony on
[2:24:00] wednesday that brother matthew read is
[2:24:03] maybe when it were around that time
[2:24:04] where she got the victory but
[2:24:07] you know i was playing a piano and you
[2:24:10] know
[2:24:10] a lot of the people that are musically
[2:24:12] and talented they probably know but you
[2:24:14] really can't pray and try to play a
[2:24:15] piano at the same time
[2:24:18] so my hard desire was to just worship
[2:24:21] the lord and the presence because it was
[2:24:23] is very wonderful so all of a sudden i
[2:24:27] start closing my eyes
[2:24:30] and um i i get in his presence so deep
[2:24:34] where i'm
[2:24:36] praying and i'm weeping
[2:24:39] and uh i'm not even realizing that i'm
[2:24:41] not concentrating to play the piano
[2:24:45] so i wasn't thinking about the next song
[2:24:48] i wasn't thinking about messing up
[2:24:50] i wasn't thinking about i i was just
[2:24:53] praying
[2:24:55] and i probably played for about five
[2:24:58] minutes where i
[2:24:59] i was just praying and i could say this
[2:25:02] i know it wasn't me because i
[2:25:03] i wasn't concentrating on playing
[2:25:05] anything so it had to have been him
[2:25:07] whatever that was i know it was
[2:25:09] supernatural but i was just
[2:25:11] i was just i was just praising him in
[2:25:14] in that peaceful still
[2:25:18] atmosphere where you just never wanted
[2:25:20] to leave
[2:25:21] and it was it was supernatural because
[2:25:25] i've been playing a piano ever since i
[2:25:27] was eight years old and
[2:25:28] i've never had that happen to me in my
[2:25:30] life so i'm just thankful
[2:25:33] and uh i don't know if this would be an
[2:25:35] encouragement to the church but brother
[2:25:37] david mentioned uh brother andre that
[2:25:40] he uh he was baptized yesterday and
[2:25:44] and um if he doesn't mind just sharing a
[2:25:47] few words just part of his testimony but
[2:25:50] you know the the presence of the lord
[2:25:51] was was really moving at the camp
[2:25:53] yesterday while we were ministering
[2:25:54] out there and and you know as as we were
[2:25:58] trying to talk to
[2:25:59] our brother andre just craziness was
[2:26:02] going around the camp
[2:26:04] and you know people were just arguing
[2:26:06] and you know that they were just trying
[2:26:08] to do a turmoil
[2:26:10] and uh we were sitting at the table just
[2:26:13] eating lunch and even there
[2:26:16] all that turmoil was going on but the
[2:26:18] presence of the lord was there and it
[2:26:19] was peace and
[2:26:21] it was that sweet atmosphere and that's
[2:26:23] when
[2:26:24] the lord spoke to him so brother andre
[2:26:26] if do you want to say a few words or
[2:26:32] okay
[2:26:36] so yeah i'm brother andre
[2:26:42] i am not a public speaker you know
[2:26:52] i am definitely not a public speaker but
[2:26:54] uh
[2:26:55] sometimes it calls for you to get out
[2:26:57] your comfort zone in order to grow in
[2:26:58] christ so
[2:26:59] i'm gonna go with what i'm asked to do
[2:27:02] so yeah i met
[2:27:03] these guys at the uh campground
[2:27:05] yesterday it's a place that i usually
[2:27:06] don't go
[2:27:07] and i'm gonna just say i ended up there
[2:27:09] by very extenuating circumstances
[2:27:12] um i had asked the lord to take me to a
[2:27:15] place where
[2:27:18] i can see him working you know what i'm
[2:27:20] saying and
[2:27:21] i ask him for a deliverance from
[2:27:23] something or the path to a deliverance
[2:27:26] from something and he presented that
[2:27:28] through the guys that were working at
[2:27:29] that camp yesterday
[2:27:31] they brought me to bedford know what i'm
[2:27:33] saying and um
[2:27:36] i was presented with something that i've
[2:27:39] never experienced with a church before
[2:27:41] and that's just
[2:27:41] absolute loving in care know what i'm
[2:27:44] saying i mean they showed me complete
[2:27:46] love
[2:27:46] they put me in a hotel last night you
[2:27:49] know i'm homeless
[2:27:50] don't have anywhere to stay so it's been
[2:27:51] kind of hard uh they fed me
[2:27:54] they brought me to church this morning
[2:27:55] and since i've been here i've just
[2:27:57] experienced nothing but
[2:27:58] love from each and every person that
[2:27:59] i've met shook hands with
[2:28:01] introduce themselves to him and i just
[2:28:02] like to say thank you
[2:28:16] that's how they know you're his
[2:28:17] disciples
[2:28:19] by your love for another keep up brother
[2:28:22] andre in prayer
[2:28:23] i mean he's well experienced he knows
[2:28:26] what the battle is
[2:28:28] ahead of him but now he's got a helper
[2:28:32] one that can do battle on his behalf and
[2:28:36] i believe he's going to have a total
[2:28:37] victorious life and
[2:28:39] that god's going to do wonderful things
[2:28:42] for him we can be confident of that
[2:28:44] amen appreciate that brother so much and
[2:28:47] god does love you
[2:28:48] the love that you feel from these people
[2:28:51] is just the love they got from the lord
[2:28:53] jesus
[2:28:54] and all they've done is they've shared
[2:28:56] his love
[2:28:58] as he loved them so does
[2:29:01] do they love you and that's where our
[2:29:03] love comes from
[2:29:05] amen we love him because he first
[2:29:08] loved us and anybody else have a
[2:29:12] testimony brother tim praise the lord
[2:29:25] as that brother said i'm not a very good
[2:29:27] public speaker either
[2:29:28] because
[2:29:34] when your heart's in your throat makes
[2:29:35] it tough to talk
[2:29:46] i'm turning to scripture in the book of
[2:29:50] acts
[2:30:01] and i don't really have to turn to it
[2:30:02] because
[2:30:07] i've heard it all my life
[2:30:22] probably more than anyone in here
[2:30:29] i can say i've been blessed with god
[2:30:38] all of you may not know my background
[2:30:42] when i was born into a message believe
[2:30:44] me
[2:30:46] home and family
[2:30:51] and if you know me i'm hard headed
[2:30:53] enough to know that that's the only way
[2:30:55] i can make it
[2:31:02] and if you also know me you know i like
[2:31:04] cake
[2:31:05] so i could use some
[2:31:08] some cake to sustain me
[2:31:13] but in the book of acts it says for in
[2:31:16] him
[2:31:18] we live and move and have our being
[2:31:25] and paul preached
[2:31:29] the resurrection of the lord jesus
[2:31:32] that's what led him to having his head
[2:31:36] cut off
[2:31:37] because he believed in and preached with
[2:31:39] fire conviction
[2:31:41] the resurrection
[2:31:46] and if we believe that and live that and
[2:31:48] minister that
[2:31:51] we're going to undergo the same
[2:31:53] persecution
[2:31:55] and in this life even
[2:32:00] the way people live now they believe
[2:32:03] some strange things
[2:32:04] they act out very strange things they
[2:32:06] live demonic lives
[2:32:08] in front of the public
[2:32:11] without reproach but i'm telling you if
[2:32:14] you live this message
[2:32:16] there will be a reproach and if we're
[2:32:19] without reproach
[2:32:21] something's wrong
[2:32:27] i was spending time with co-worker this
[2:32:30] past week
[2:32:31] i've had to go out of town quite a bit
[2:32:33] oklahoma city we have a plant up there
[2:32:35] in north little rock and
[2:32:39] there's just a very small crew in
[2:32:42] north little rock and
[2:32:46] one of the workers there it's been there
[2:32:47] about 18 or 20 years is also a pastor
[2:32:51] so we get to talk and break time and
[2:32:55] after work quite a lot of discussions
[2:32:58] and things
[2:32:59] and when you hear someone
[2:33:02] speaking out of love and conviction
[2:33:08] but yet it doesn't ring quite true to
[2:33:10] you
[2:33:12] you often want to interject the truth
[2:33:15] and
[2:33:16] you know they say politics and religion
[2:33:18] is not a very good thing to talk about
[2:33:19] at work
[2:33:20] but
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:23] but when you hear a hearts cry you want
[2:33:26] to you want to respond to that and
[2:33:27] answer that
[2:33:29] so as it turns out we were talking about
[2:33:32] over in
[2:33:33] in john how
[2:33:38] and there was a difference in opinion
[2:33:40] but i believe there is a race of people
[2:33:42] or a dispensation of time to a certain
[2:33:45] people that god would not impute sin
[2:33:49] and it's a little confusing you read
[2:33:52] that it's like
[2:33:53] well if you say you haven't sinned
[2:33:55] you're a liar
[2:33:58] but who knows the mind of god and when
[2:34:00] he puts it in the sea of god's
[2:34:02] forgetfulness
[2:34:03] it's as if you never did it anyway
[2:34:06] so in god's eyes if god says you hadn't
[2:34:09] sinned
[2:34:10] then how can man call you a sinner
[2:34:13] but i believe church that's what true
[2:34:15] conversion is
[2:34:17] and
[2:34:22] as we continue to talk they think
[2:34:25] my you know you get basically you
[2:34:29] you go all the way back to the beginning
[2:34:33] and
[2:34:36] i expressed the truth of serpency
[2:34:40] and that's been a reproach i gladly bear
[2:34:44] that reproach
[2:34:46] and the times of and that was several
[2:34:48] years ago
[2:34:50] and when the time comes now we talk
[2:34:53] about things they're just a little cold
[2:34:54] reservation
[2:34:57] oh that's brother that's tim he believes
[2:34:59] you know such and such
[2:35:02] and you're looked at strangely it's okay
[2:35:05] we know the truth
[2:35:06] well this weekend the manager who's not
[2:35:10] the pastor by the way
[2:35:12] we were working hand in hand and we were
[2:35:14] discussing quite a few things
[2:35:17] and we were back in genesis again and
[2:35:20] how
[2:35:21] god created man in his own image
[2:35:24] and male and female created he them
[2:35:28] and god took the feminist spirit out of
[2:35:30] adam i was telling him these things he
[2:35:31] said wait a minute tim
[2:35:33] this sounds so like a sci-fi movie or
[2:35:36] something this is a script out of a
[2:35:37] sci-fi
[2:35:38] i said no kevin this is the greatest
[2:35:40] love story that's ever been told
[2:35:43] and brother sister we are the principal
[2:35:46] character
[2:35:47] in that love story over in the book of
[2:35:51] revelations
[2:35:52] 22 12 it says behold i come quickly
[2:35:55] and my reward is with me
[2:35:59] think of that we are his reward
[2:36:08] we had this machine that was it's a 1973
[2:36:11] baler
[2:36:13] that just stopped working about three
[2:36:15] weeks ago
[2:36:16] during that time i also took vacation
[2:36:18] and it seems like when i go out
[2:36:20] everything's put on hold and i'm
[2:36:22] kind of the troubleshooter for the
[2:36:23] company and
[2:36:25] we're supposed to fix this machine
[2:36:28] of course the boss's boss and
[2:36:30] everybody's
[2:36:31] on the phone wanting to know why can't
[2:36:33] we fix this machine
[2:36:35] so i got to respond to it
[2:36:39] and usually in areas of maintenance or
[2:36:41] mechanical
[2:36:43] i can fix it this had a
[2:36:47] an old plc
[2:36:50] attached to it that had been added after
[2:36:52] the factory years later
[2:36:54] and it's kind of like when the brain
[2:36:57] shuts off
[2:36:58] you don't know what the brain says what
[2:36:59] the faults are and we had no
[2:37:01] data on this to fix it with and
[2:37:05] so we just tried to change it out put a
[2:37:08] new one in
[2:37:08] and things still didn't work well
[2:37:12] we had told everyone that this thing
[2:37:15] will be up on friday
[2:37:17] of course it was late on friday and it
[2:37:19] still wasn't working
[2:37:20] and we're about to call it quits and uh
[2:37:25] and kevin said let's just go over there
[2:37:28] and try it one more time
[2:37:30] so we went back and uh i made a couple
[2:37:32] little adjustments
[2:37:34] and it just started working
[2:37:38] and uh this is the same guy i was
[2:37:40] talking to that day at lunch
[2:37:42] trying to express the truth to him and
[2:37:45] he turns and looks at me and says
[2:37:46] tim you know that wasn't anything short
[2:37:49] of a miracle
[2:37:50] that that machine worked and i said
[2:37:51] that's true kevin so
[2:37:55] i pray that somehow i can be
[2:37:58] the right kind of influence you know you
[2:38:00] live your life
[2:38:02] uh you put your best foot forward you
[2:38:04] try to walk circumspectfully
[2:38:06] but young people you'll you like just as
[2:38:08] the old ones
[2:38:09] you're setting a pattern of good works
[2:38:11] if you follow the scriptures
[2:38:14] you know the seed that you sow is going
[2:38:16] to come to harvest
[2:38:18] and i believe it's harvest time
[2:38:23] and just as brother david said today
[2:38:25] he's talking about that's
[2:38:27] some of the very things i was talking to
[2:38:28] kevin about not knowing what he was
[2:38:30] going to preach
[2:38:33] how the seed had to go into the ground
[2:38:35] and die for it to
[2:38:38] come up okay the son of man
[2:38:43] jesus expressed himself to the jews as
[2:38:45] son of man
[2:38:46] he said when he went into the ground and
[2:38:48] died the son of god
[2:38:51] spanned the church ages he comes in
[2:38:53] three sons names we've been taught
[2:38:55] son of god our son of man son of god and
[2:38:57] son of david but at the end of that son
[2:38:59] of god
[2:39:00] ministry there's another coming of the
[2:39:02] son of man we are part of that that
[2:39:04] to me son of man because we talked about
[2:39:07] melchizedek
[2:39:08] and i asked kevin who was melchizedek i
[2:39:10] said that was god in the flesh
[2:39:12] the same way you and i are okay if
[2:39:15] you're tabernacling deity
[2:39:18] you're you're if god has children
[2:39:20] they're going to be gods right
[2:39:22] i don't want to take too much time but i
[2:39:24] just want to add my
[2:39:27] little two cents worth it's even worth
[2:39:29] that to say hey i'm behind
[2:39:31] the push to get out of here and but
[2:39:34] you know the last one may already be in
[2:39:38] they may already be in we're just
[2:39:40] waiting on the the
[2:39:41] cup of the amorites the wickedness and
[2:39:43] then we know we have plenty of that too
[2:39:45] so lord bless you
[2:39:46] keep you give us strength we pray
[2:39:59] what was the son of man ministry brother
[2:40:01] tim exactly
[2:40:03] god in flesh what's this bride going to
[2:40:06] be
[2:40:07] god in flesh that's the result of the
[2:40:10] son of man ministry
[2:40:12] and there wasn't one other ministry that
[2:40:15] could produce it
[2:40:19] amen it's the only ministry that can
[2:40:22] produce
[2:40:23] god in flesh and if that same spirit
[2:40:26] that was in jesus christ dwell in you
[2:40:29] it will also equip in your mortal body i
[2:40:32] i it just i just appreciate that so much
[2:40:35] because that's what he brought
[2:40:37] that's what paul preached was
[2:40:40] resurrection
[2:40:41] that's what brother branham brought was
[2:40:44] resurrection
[2:40:45] and he said i preached the same thing
[2:40:49] paul preached amen lord richly bless you
[2:40:53] i don't know 7 20 maybe we can fit
[2:40:57] one more testimony in before 7 30 does
[2:41:00] anybody else
[2:41:01] have a testimony davey go ahead
[2:41:06] i think we've all just felt
[2:41:13] i'm sure we would express it maybe
[2:41:15] differently and
[2:41:16] that being on my heart you ask
[2:41:20] you know yourself well lord what's that
[2:41:22] mean for me and
[2:41:24] what am i to do where do you want me
[2:41:29] how do i go forward in need and
[2:41:32] i could say there's been a lot of times
[2:41:34] i haven't been faithful to the
[2:41:36] opportunities he's given me
[2:41:38] to be the son of god he wants me to be
[2:41:42] and the answer and i'm so satisfied with
[2:41:45] the testimonies i've heard i
[2:41:46] feel they say so much of the same thing
[2:41:49] but
[2:41:50] um be faithful to the opportunities that
