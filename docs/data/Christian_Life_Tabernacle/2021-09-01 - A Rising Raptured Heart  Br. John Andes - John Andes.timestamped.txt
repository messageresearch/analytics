[35:55] and just coming into teenage years
[35:58] i had a little
[36:00] a plaque a little brown plaque that hung
[36:02] on the brown
[36:04] paneling
[36:06] sister leslie of
[36:08] my room
[36:10] i remember it till this day
[36:13] and um just coming into my teenage years
[36:16] and this little plaque said only one
[36:18] life
[36:19] till soon be passed
[36:22] only what's done for christ
[36:24] will last
[36:26] and tonight i just want to say being a
[36:28] christian is the greatest privilege
[36:32] serving the lord jesus is an honor
[36:35] walking in the light of this message
[36:38] and being filled with the holy ghost is
[36:40] the greatest privilege a mortal can have
[36:43] and i'm so thankful here tonight in
[36:45] dallas texas here you are here we are
[36:47] gathered in his precious name that we
[36:49] can know that the lord knows all of us
[36:53] and um you know when i left the state of
[36:55] washington this morning it was 55
[36:58] degrees
[36:59] and brother brother matthew picked me up
[37:02] it was a hundred degrees here i thought
[37:04] is that incredible
[37:06] in just a few hours it's like i flew to
[37:08] another world
[37:10] but i'm thankful that in the spiritual
[37:12] realm
[37:13] god's just the shank
[37:15] and uh
[37:17] a few weeks ago we were
[37:19] making plans and for our airline ticket
[37:21] to go to north carolina for this weekend
[37:24] ministering saturday and sunday for
[37:26] brother berry coffee
[37:28] and i thought well i was going to leave
[37:30] on thursday i said can we just leave on
[37:32] wednesday
[37:33] and visit the dallas texas church so
[37:36] here we are tonight
[37:38] the lord must pre-plan that
[37:41] and had in his great mind that we would
[37:43] all be together tonight so are we family
[37:46] can i feel at home
[37:48] so i just want to say that i'm here for
[37:50] your your week six week checkup
[37:58] all right
[37:59] the traveling heart doctor is in
[38:03] the heart surgeon
[38:05] i'm not speaking of myself i'm speaking
[38:07] of the lord jesus the heart surgeon that
[38:09] does house calls
[38:12] is doing a heart checkup tonight
[38:14] and this isn't a routine checkup it's
[38:17] very very important we've got a pass
[38:20] and so
[38:21] we were here sunday
[38:23] july the 25th and we spoke a couple
[38:26] services
[38:28] for you i know all the minister brothers
[38:30] weren't here
[38:32] so we just took our liberty and we used
[38:34] the spare tire that weekend do you all
[38:36] remember that
[38:38] and
[38:39] we spoke on the heart of the matters
[38:43] in the morning and then healing for
[38:45] spiritual heart trouble
[38:48] and i'm not going to call this part
[38:50] three
[38:51] but i the lord laid a message on my
[38:53] heart for tonight
[38:55] so that's why we're here we're
[38:57] we're here to do a heart checkup for you
[39:00] that was five and a half weeks ago
[39:03] so if some of you might remember i'm
[39:05] just coming into the subject
[39:07] for tonight we we spoke about spiritual
[39:10] heart trouble
[39:12] and moving from brokenhearted
[39:15] to healing
[39:17] and a new heart and a new spirit
[39:20] god's been promised to give us out of
[39:22] ezekiel 36 that we would receive his
[39:25] spirit
[39:27] and his heart
[39:29] and how many believe the great physician
[39:31] still heals
[39:35] i'm just getting started all right i'm
[39:37] the heart specialist and we put on our
[39:39] glasses and our little gown and i'm just
[39:41] checking to make sure y'all are still
[39:43] alive hey man
[39:44] the great physician heals
[39:47] and um i've even got the binoculars back
[39:51] again
[39:52] do you all remember this
[39:55] you got to look through the binoculars
[39:57] look through god's word
[39:59] we want to see things the way god sees
[40:01] them and this would be like kind of
[40:03] seeing something far away
[40:06] and sometimes we need to do that
[40:09] but tonight i've got another
[40:13] tool we're going to use
[40:15] this is a magnifying glass
[40:18] do you all know what this is
[40:20] well it's it's unusual object but when
[40:22] you're dealing with heart issues and
[40:24] things get kind of delicate
[40:26] you got to get a magnifying glass you
[40:28] got to bring it up a little closer you
[40:30] got to go a little bit down inside of
[40:32] the inside and
[40:34] so i'm not going to use the binoculars
[40:35] tonight
[40:37] is that okay
[40:38] they're going to sit right here
[40:41] but by the grace of god we've got to
[40:42] look a little deeper this is part three
[40:44] of heart surgery
[40:46] and
[40:48] this is the six week checkup
[40:52] so um
[40:53] we're going to take our liberty tonight
[40:55] brother david is is here and he's
[40:57] welcomed us to be able to speak to you
[41:00] i didn't come here to speak i just was
[41:02] wanting to be with you
[41:04] just fellowship a little bit
[41:06] but um
[41:09] if you might remember
[41:11] and you can turn in your bibles to
[41:13] malachi 4
[41:16] in just a moment we'll stand and read
[41:18] that and then first thessalonians
[41:21] chapter 4
[41:23] the rapture
[41:26] chapter
[41:27] just a moment we'll we'll have you stand
[41:32] nice to see you sister parks
[41:35] hey man your husband did really good
[41:36] sunday morning with that psalm reading i
[41:39] was tuning in and heard brother parks
[41:42] reading the psalm
[41:44] and speaking about the presence of god
[41:46] and i just thought it was so fantastic
[41:48] do you all think it's fantastic
[41:57] so now sunday night
[41:59] almost six weeks ago
[42:02] we ended the service
[42:05] speaking about a deacon
[42:07] in a church brother johnson's church and
[42:10] a sunday school teacher that he was
[42:12] married to in the church she was the
[42:14] sunday school teacher and the deacon
[42:17] and
[42:18] both of them were living with
[42:20] unconfessed sin
[42:22] and it started to cause heart trouble
[42:25] actually for her it was a mental
[42:29] uh problem panic attacks and things and
[42:32] it affected their relationship it
[42:34] affected their marriage but it affected
[42:36] the church
[42:38] and brother branham said that's why
[42:39] brother johnson couldn't have a revival
[42:42] in his church is because well you have a
[42:44] deacon that's living in sin
[42:46] not just
[42:48] years ago in the war
[42:51] but just three days ago
[42:53] with a woman at his work and so
[42:56] then you have his wife which was the
[42:58] sunday school teacher
[43:00] that had also lived untrue do you all
[43:02] remember this story
[43:05] and so tonight we're going to go a
[43:07] little bit deeper in that because since
[43:09] that service
[43:10] i found something else brother branham
[43:12] said about that
[43:14] case and i actually someone was in a
[43:16] service i was preaching and actually was
[43:18] family to those to that deacon
[43:22] and and uh and that sister and i have
[43:24] their names tonight i'm going to give
[43:26] them to you
[43:27] in just a few minutes but going to the
[43:30] heart of the matter is not always easy
[43:34] and it's a delicate thing when you start
[43:36] talking even on a wednesday night it's
[43:38] going to be more of a sunday morning
[43:39] service i hope you all ready for tonight
[43:42] sometimes it's a little delicate and
[43:44] it's important to be under experienced
[43:46] hands and to have the mind of the great
[43:48] physician to know what he once done
[43:51] in the matter to have his heart and to
[43:54] follow his mind and his will about it so
[43:57] tonight
[43:58] i'd like to speak on a rising
[44:01] raptured heart
[44:03] and we're going to go from brokenness
[44:05] we're going to come from a diseased
[44:07] heart and a troubled heart
[44:09] to now a rising
[44:11] raptured heart
[44:13] and you've got to go through this for
[44:15] the rapture
[44:17] you've got to go through the heart
[44:18] transplant the heart surgery
[44:21] and tonight's a checkup but we've got to
[44:23] pass the examination
[44:25] and so as we stand to our feet and
[44:27] we have prayed
[44:30] to the lord jesus
[44:32] and welcomed him
[44:35] to the service
[44:37] so let's just let him now take
[44:40] take us you know brother brother was
[44:42] speaking to us before the service about
[44:44] how he went in for surgery and it wasn't
[44:46] a nice comfortable
[44:48] bed it actually was a very hard surface
[44:52] and actually chilly cold on his back so
[44:55] sometimes hearing the word isn't always
[44:57] cozy and comfortable but it's exactly
[45:00] what we need i mean when we walk out of
[45:02] here we've got to know that there's been
[45:04] a change
[45:05] a new heart a new spirit a new attitude
[45:08] wouldn't that be great if god would just
[45:09] fill us all tonight just
[45:12] lord bless your word now as we turn to
[45:14] malachi chapter 4 verse 5
[45:17] and 6.
[45:22] behold
[45:24] this is god speaking
[45:27] i will send you elijah the prophet
[45:30] before the coming of the great and
[45:32] dreadful day of the lord
[45:35] and he shall turn the heart
[45:38] of the fathers
[45:40] to the children
[45:42] i have a quote right in front of me
[45:44] from the church age book
[45:47] laodicean church age well brother
[45:48] branham said that was fulfilled in the
[45:51] ministry of john
[45:53] john the baptist the hearts of the
[45:55] fathers were turned to the children the
[45:57] spirit of elijah
[45:59] but the last part of this verse here
[46:02] verse 6
[46:03] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[46:05] to the children
[46:06] and the heart of the children
[46:09] to their fathers
[46:11] lest i come and smite the earth with the
[46:13] curse that's you and me
[46:16] and brother branham said in in the
[46:18] church age book he said
[46:20] that is yet to take place
[46:22] the hearts of the last day children will
[46:24] be turned back to the pentecostal
[46:27] fathers
[46:28] john got the fathers ready for jesus to
[46:31] welcome the children into the fold now
[46:33] this prophet
[46:34] upon whom the spirit of elijah falls
[46:37] will prepare the children to welcome
[46:40] back
[46:41] jesus
[46:43] do you want to be ready for that where
[46:45] our hearts have been turned
[46:48] not our minds but our hearts
[46:51] tonight i'm speaking about a raptured
[46:53] heart
[46:55] we're speaking about this this is the
[46:56] subject for tonight
[46:58] a rising
[47:00] raptured heart
[47:02] so let's turn to first thessalonians
[47:04] chapter 4 verse 13.
[47:08] real familiar verses i know
[47:17] uh this is the rapture scriptures
[47:19] verses
[47:22] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[47:24] paul
[47:26] not wanting the church to be ignorant
[47:29] i would not have you to be ignorant
[47:30] brethren concerning them which are
[47:33] asleep
[47:34] they've passed away
[47:36] that you sorrow not
[47:38] even as others which have no hope
[47:42] we do have hope
[47:44] for if we believe that jesus died and
[47:46] rose again even so them
[47:48] also which sleep in jesus will god bring
[47:52] with him
[47:54] for this we say unto you by the word of
[47:57] the lord
[47:59] that we
[48:00] let's all say we
[48:02] we which are alive and remain unto the
[48:06] coming of the lord shall not prevent or
[48:09] hinder them which are asleep
[48:13] for the lord
[48:14] verse 16
[48:16] himself
[48:18] shall descend from heaven
[48:20] with a shout out
[48:22] now this is jesus coming back for his
[48:25] bride verse 16 is a very important
[48:28] scripture for us us tonight speaking
[48:30] about a raptured heart you've got to be
[48:32] able to recognize
[48:34] that we have received a shout of a
[48:36] message
[48:38] the lord himself shall descend from
[48:40] heaven with a shout
[48:41] with the voice of the archangel
[48:44] and with the trump of god and the dead
[48:47] in christ shall rise first
[48:49] then we which are alive and remain
[48:53] shall be caught up
[48:55] together with them in the clouds
[48:59] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[49:03] we ever be with the lord there's going
[49:04] to be people that are alive and remain
[49:08] unto the coming of the lord whose hearts
[49:10] have been turned back
[49:12] so they're not backslidden they're not
[49:14] in the world
[49:16] but they're ready to go they they're
[49:18] arise they've arisen they've been
[49:20] quickened
[49:22] because they've received a message
[49:25] i believe i'm looking into some of their
[49:27] faces tonight
[49:28] hallelujah look into the faces of
[49:31] believers and say these are some of the
[49:34] ones that's alive and remain to the
[49:36] coming of the lord their hearts have
[49:38] been turned
[49:40] they've received a new heart
[49:43] the old stony heart was taken away and
[49:46] god put in a new heart that's risen
[49:50] now tonight when you hear these things
[49:52] about the coming of the lord and the
[49:54] rapture and if tonight was our last
[49:56] service or the resurrected saints could
[49:59] be here at any moment does that bring
[50:01] fear to your heart
[50:03] does that bring dread does is there a
[50:06] question mark about where you stand with
[50:08] the lord that's why we have wednesday
[50:10] night services
[50:12] it's just to bring another chat to our
[50:15] lives that we're ready to go
[50:17] and we're willing to be honest we're
[50:19] willing to come into the operating room
[50:21] and just let the great physician do his
[50:24] work
[50:27] and be humble about it be honest
[50:30] and say lord i want to go in the rapture
[50:33] i'm willing to look forward i'm willing
[50:35] to lay aside every weight every sin i
[50:38] want to arise
[50:40] i want to receive this rapturing heart
[50:44] verse 318
[50:46] wherefore comfort one another with these
[50:49] words
[50:50] it should bring comfort to the church
[50:53] speaking about the rapture god bless you
[50:55] you can have your seats
[51:02] as we speak about
[51:04] a rising
[51:06] raptured heart
[51:11] let me just continue on from the sunday
[51:13] night as we
[51:14] were closing five and a half weeks ago
[51:17] about this man
[51:19] that was in his vehicle
[51:23] he's a deacon of a church
[51:25] the pastor's name was brother johnson
[51:28] his wife
[51:30] is a sunday school teacher
[51:32] of the church and he's driving down his
[51:34] road he's it was before the days of cell
[51:37] phone
[51:39] so he's just about to his house but as
[51:42] he's driving down the road there's a lot
[51:44] of guilt
[51:45] in his conscience there's a lot of guilt
[51:47] in his heart because he's just going
[51:49] back in his mind to what happened years
[51:52] ago
[51:53] in the time of the war
[51:55] when he was just newly married
[51:57] and he had went over to europe
[52:00] and he had committed an act with someone
[52:04] and broke his marriage vow
[52:06] and now he's just carrying that for
[52:08] years even though he's a deacon in the
[52:10] church his wife is a sunday school
[52:13] teacher but you know she's been going
[52:15] through a lot of things lately too in
[52:18] fact financially it's almost ruined
[52:21] their family he she's going to a
[52:23] psychiatrist
[52:25] and it's almost broke their family
[52:27] things aren't right with his wife things
[52:29] aren't right with him he can shake hands
[52:31] with people he consider him he can be
[52:34] kind to the pastor he can
[52:36] be in service his wife can be in service
[52:38] with the little sunday school children
[52:40] but as he's now just pulling into the
[52:42] driveway of his house and puts it in
[52:45] park he's about ready to go inside but
[52:47] then all of a sudden he's overcome again
[52:50] with this guilt of uh what he's gone
[52:53] through and what he's carrying
[52:56] he's a tall man he's got black hair
[52:59] kind of combed over to one side kind of
[53:01] wavy
[53:03] kind of a middle-aged
[53:05] man and he actually works for the
[53:07] chevrolet
[53:08] company
[53:10] and then as he gets out of his vehicle
[53:12] and goes into the house he's just
[53:14] sitting there just
[53:16] kind of pondering these things and
[53:19] all of a sudden you know he just begins
[53:21] to remember not what happened in the war
[53:24] but just about three days ago
[53:27] again
[53:29] the same spirit that it took over him
[53:31] years ago
[53:33] there was a woman that worked in the
[53:34] office and wearing a pink dress and they
[53:38] get into a green chevrolet car this is
[53:40] just three days ago
[53:42] and and he's again caught up in the same
[53:45] act again and he thinks that nobody
[53:47] knows about that and nobody would even
[53:50] know that he has been caught up with it
[53:52] years ago and now three days ago and so
[53:56] he gets into the house and he's just
[53:58] pondering these things and thinking
[54:00] about that and the phone rings at the
[54:02] house and it's his wife
[54:04] and she says i gotta meet you i gotta
[54:06] meet you
[54:07] and he's like what what is there
[54:09] something wrong and i've got to meet you
[54:11] and they make a certain place and
[54:14] and they meet and he gets in his vehicle
[54:16] and drives and meets
[54:18] her in the car
[54:21] and they pull in together and as they're
[54:24] just sitting there
[54:26] in the vehicle
[54:28] she begins to confess
[54:30] of her sin
[54:33] she begins to confess of what happened
[54:35] years ago when she was younger just
[54:37] newly married and lonesome and she when
[54:40] her husband was away and how she had
[54:42] been with a man
[54:44] and uh
[54:45] and the train almost hit them and
[54:48] my
[54:49] and she's just
[54:50] now sitting in the passenger side
[54:52] talking to her husband and confessing
[54:55] that she had been wrong and
[54:57] honey would you forgive me of my sin it
[55:00] caused serious
[55:01] mental and heart trouble in her own life
[55:04] honey would you forgive me
[55:06] would you forgive me
[55:08] of my sin and here's the man sitting on
[55:10] this side
[55:12] hearing all this from his wife knowing
[55:14] what's already on his mind but he's very
[55:17] quick to say i forgive you yes honey
[55:22] i forgive you
[55:23] she's weeping she's repenting
[55:26] and then she continues on and says but
[55:28] honey
[55:29] aren't you
[55:31] also guilty of the same thing
[55:34] years ago when you went over to france
[55:37] and
[55:38] wasn't you with a
[55:40] a woman there and
[55:42] then not just years ago but just three
[55:45] days ago wasn't you with that lady from
[55:47] your work in that green car and she had
[55:50] on a pink dress and and didn't this just
[55:53] happen a few days ago honey
[55:57] and the man is just hearing all this and
[56:00] he's saying like where have you been or
[56:04] how did you know these things he's not
[56:06] denying he's not giving an excuse he's
[56:08] not quick his blood pressure is not just
[56:10] boiling but he just realizes where have
[56:13] you been
[56:14] how do you know these things
[56:19] and he said yes honey
[56:20] all of that is true
[56:23] all of what you said is true years ago
[56:25] when i went to europe i was
[56:28] involved in an act
[56:30] i want you to know i'm sorry about that
[56:34] and it's true honey
[56:36] even though i'm a deacon in the church
[56:38] and we've been serving for years this
[56:39] spirit's been plaguing and tormenting my
[56:42] mind just a three days ago i was
[56:44] involved with
[56:46] the lady at my work the chevrolet
[56:48] company and
[56:49] i'm sorry i'm totally wrong i've been a
[56:52] wrong husband to you and
[56:54] i'm not even worthy to be a husband
[56:58] remember they had three children and
[57:00] he just was thinking about these things
[57:03] and they began to weep and begin to cry
[57:06] together and they both were confessing
[57:08] with tears running down their cheeks and
[57:11] they put their arms around
[57:13] one another
[57:15] after they had confessed the wrong and
[57:17] they cut well what do we do now i mean
[57:19] do we leave one another do we separate
[57:22] is life over no
[57:24] i think we need to go on and serve god
[57:27] together will you forgive me honey yes
[57:30] will you forgive me honey
[57:32] yes
[57:33] let's make this right and put it behind
[57:36] us and go on and serve the lord oh god
[57:38] would you forgive us as they pray
[57:40] together
[57:42] honey what do we do now well i think
[57:44] it'd be good to go back and visit
[57:46] brother branham and
[57:47] visit his house so they go driving back
[57:50] but as this man is now driving back he's
[57:53] already thinking about brother johnson
[57:56] the the pastor of the church and he says
[57:59] my my my
[58:00] he said i'm the deacon of the church now
[58:03] this is something brother john has now
[58:04] heard since i was with you last since
[58:07] our last heart surgery and ending that
[58:09] sunday night this is a quote out of
[58:12] florida that i heard brother brown i'm
[58:13] now actually speaking about this again
[58:16] about this brother because if you
[58:17] remember we closed that service
[58:19] wondering what that man was gonna do
[58:21] what that sister was gonna do should
[58:23] they you know should he step down from
[58:25] his position should she step down you
[58:28] know and put some time into their
[58:30] marriage and maybe sit together on the
[58:32] pew and all this is going through this
[58:34] this man's mind he's he's thinking it's
[58:37] i'm absolutely guilty i'm no good to be
[58:39] called a husband a father of my children
[58:41] or a deacon in that church and as soon
[58:44] as i can get brother johnson i'm going
[58:46] to resign from my job he said
[58:49] how many think that's amazing
[58:51] i'm going to step down as soon as i can
[58:53] get a hold of brother johnson i'm going
[58:55] to resign from my job
[58:59] as soon as brother branham heard that he
[59:01] said
[59:01] don't you do that
[59:04] just get right with god
[59:06] and continue with your job
[59:09] see i said no need of doing that he said
[59:11] oh if god would forgive me i said sure
[59:14] he'd forgive you you confess to your
[59:17] wife and ask her to forgive you
[59:19] you're all forgiven with one another yes
[59:22] i said now sit down now is the time and
[59:24] that's when brother branham
[59:27] when they came back to his house they
[59:29] were weeping and crying and making these
[59:32] things right now brother branham is
[59:34] counseling this brother
[59:36] don't resign from your position
[59:38] he said no need of doing that
[59:41] if god will forgive you sure he forgive
[59:44] you you confess to your wife and ask her
[59:46] to forgive you you all forgive one
[59:48] another now brother branham is praying
[59:50] for the wife that was very very
[59:52] tormented heavenly father this demon
[59:55] that has tormented this girl for all
[59:57] these years and has no legal right to
[59:59] hold her now because it's done been
[1:00:02] found and made right now come out of her
[1:00:05] in the name of jesus christ and brother
[1:00:07] branham says she's perfectly normal and
[1:00:10] well from that time on
[1:00:14] can we say praise the lord and i what
[1:00:16] what a miracle what a testimony of
[1:00:18] something that happened maybe years ago
[1:00:21] but i felt to bring it into even this
[1:00:24] congregation uh almost six weeks ago and
[1:00:27] then tonight to come back with a
[1:00:29] follow-up to let you know that most of
[1:00:31] us probably would have felt that brother
[1:00:33] needs to resign and maybe the sister
[1:00:36] needs to resign and but that's not
[1:00:38] brother branham's counsel to them he
[1:00:39] said if you've made this right with god
[1:00:42] and made it right with the other person
[1:00:44] you need to go on and serve god
[1:00:48] now how many like to know the rest of
[1:00:50] the story
[1:00:52] i was speaking about this just a few
[1:00:53] days ago in tucson arizona
[1:00:56] and after the morning service i got a
[1:00:58] phone call from a brother that was in
[1:01:00] the morning service he said i'm actually
[1:01:02] family
[1:01:03] with that
[1:01:04] with that man and that woman
[1:01:08] and uh they've been they've spoken
[1:01:10] together and been together it was
[1:01:12] actually a cousin
[1:01:14] and uh of a grandpa of this very couple

[1:01:19] brother wilbert shane

[1:01:25] shane that was the sunday school teacher
[1:01:27] she had a name
[1:01:30] her name was mary
[1:01:33] and i wanted to bring this tonight
[1:01:35] because the brother that was giving me
[1:01:36] this testimony that been on
[1:01:39] conversations and actually family of
[1:01:41] wilbur shane and mary shane not only did
[1:01:45] this man this deacon stay with his wife
[1:01:48] and continue to serve in that church but
[1:01:51] he later pastored that same church
[1:01:54] and as they gave their hearts back to
[1:01:56] the lord and repented and went on he
[1:01:59] pastored that church and he retired when
[1:02:01] he was 85 years old and he's only died
[1:02:04] just five years ago
[1:02:06] one day before he was 100 years old
[1:02:10] 99 years old here's a man
[1:02:13] brother wilbur is his name he was the
[1:02:15] deacon
[1:02:17] and his wife sister mary
[1:02:20] that god did a glorious work of
[1:02:22] restoring their heart and restoring
[1:02:25] their mental state and bringing their
[1:02:28] marriage and bringing relationship and
[1:02:30] bringing the whole church now back where
[1:02:33] now we can have a revival
[1:02:37] praise god it's not just brother johnson
[1:02:40] plowing and wondering what's going on in
[1:02:42] my church but it's now a deacon is made
[1:02:45] right the sunday school teacher is made
[1:02:48] right we can talk about noah and the ark
[1:02:50] and jesus dying on the cross and daniel
[1:02:53] and the lion's den but now we got some
[1:02:56] spirit in it
[1:02:58] our heart has been restored
[1:03:00] now we can have someone shaking your
[1:03:02] hand or or greeting you or maybe praying
[1:03:05] not with just a mechanical voice but
[1:03:07] with something inside of him

[1:03:12] his goodness has followed me and i have
[1:03:16] personally experienced god forgiven my
[1:03:19] life you talk about a changed family
[1:03:22] those two or three children that they
[1:03:24] had seeing their mother and father now
[1:03:27] with one another in tears and being
[1:03:29] honest and now coming back from brother
[1:03:31] branham's home that demon spirit that
[1:03:34] had tormented her it was gone now
[1:03:38] that guilt over that deacon that had
[1:03:41] just been wondering how i should handle
[1:03:44] this it was totally gone they they could
[1:03:47] be free now
[1:03:48] and i pray now as we bring this back to
[1:03:52] this church service tonight
[1:03:55] that if there's anyone that has had
[1:03:57] something happen in your past or
[1:03:59] something happened in your life that god
[1:04:02] would be speaking to you tonight in this
[1:04:05] heart examination time
[1:04:08] it's time for a rapture
[1:04:13] if there ever was a time we needed to be
[1:04:15] honest and open with the lord and with
[1:04:18] one another it's now
[1:04:21] and let the lord do a rising a raptured
[1:04:24] heart is a heart that's been turned back
[1:04:26] to god
[1:04:29] that's why we read malachi chapter 4 and
[1:04:31] maybe you can put that oh brother parks
[1:04:33] you're back there in the booth tonight
[1:04:35] god bless you nice to see you tonight
[1:04:37] malachi chapter 4
[1:04:39] verse 5 again maybe you'd like to turn
[1:04:41] there into the bible as we move now into
[1:04:43] another gear continuing on in the
[1:04:45] service do you appreciate the message of
[1:04:47] the hour
[1:04:48] we could just stop right there and say
[1:04:49] thank the lord for a message
[1:04:51] that restores people back
[1:04:54] to their ut to be conditioned
[1:04:57] doesn't just condemn them neither does
[1:04:59] it just compromise
[1:05:01] but it actually puts it under the blood
[1:05:04] and god can't even find that
[1:05:11] there was a senior pastor of this
[1:05:13] message
[1:05:14] if you if we just put that on the screen
[1:05:16] a few weeks ago we were fellowshipping
[1:05:18] about this
[1:05:21] and there was people in his church that
[1:05:23] was actually bringing accusations about
[1:05:25] one of their deacons and some of his
[1:05:27] past life and they were trying to bring
[1:05:30] up with this deacon's done this thing
[1:05:32] and that thing and surely they must be
[1:05:33] disqualified from being a deacon and
[1:05:36] this pastor was very troubled because it
[1:05:38] was his deacon
[1:05:41] i trust this is okay tonight i'm a
[1:05:43] visiting traveling heart surgeon
[1:05:47] but by the grace of god this very quote
[1:05:50] that i read to you
[1:05:51] out of florida
[1:05:53] about brother johnson's church and this
[1:05:55] deacon this pastor happened to come upon
[1:05:57] it and it totally changed the whole
[1:05:59] situation when he saw brother branham's
[1:06:02] attitude and how he applied the word of
[1:06:04] god to a deacon that had been in sin not
[1:06:07] just years ago but a few days ago and
[1:06:10] how he had actually brother branham
[1:06:12] counseled the brother to continue on
[1:06:15] you've made this right with god
[1:06:17] you've made this right with your wife
[1:06:20] continue to serve
[1:06:22] and continue to go on with god
[1:06:24] and also the sunday school teacher he
[1:06:26] brother branham did not counsel her to
[1:06:28] sit down for six months and
[1:06:30] you know we need to just kind of watch
[1:06:32] her behavior and see if she's gonna have
[1:06:34] church order and if she's gonna follow
[1:06:36] her husband we kind of need to watch
[1:06:37] that couple that's not how brother
[1:06:39] branham dealt with the situation but
[1:06:41] immediately he cast off that evil spirit
[1:06:45] and i believe it was under the blood
[1:06:48] and this pastor when he brought that
[1:06:50] quote to the people it dissolved the
[1:06:52] whole situation because he could see how
[1:06:55] a prophet had actually applied the word
[1:06:58] of god that if god can't see that sin
[1:07:02] if it's under the blood
[1:07:04] if you've made that right with the other
[1:07:06] person
[1:07:07] then it's no longer even in god's mind
[1:07:11] then who are you or who am i to be
[1:07:13] bringing up those sins there could be a
[1:07:16] lot of questions and i leave this to the
[1:07:18] sovereignty of a local church and a
[1:07:20] pastor how they handle their church but
[1:07:23] i'm i'm speaking from the message of the
[1:07:25] hour how did brother branham handle
[1:07:27] these things what did he say about
[1:07:29] certain things and i think it's good to
[1:07:31] know tonight we have an absolute
[1:07:35] we have an anchor
[1:07:37] and it's it's malachi 4 5. behold i will
[1:07:41] send you elijah the prophet
[1:07:44] before the coming of the great and
[1:07:45] dreadful day of the lord verse 6 and he
[1:07:48] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:07:49] the children
[1:07:51] and the heart let's all say heart
[1:07:54] it's the heart of the matter
[1:07:58] the heart of the children
[1:08:00] to their fathers can i ask you tonight
[1:08:03] are you fulfilling this part of malachi
[1:08:05] 4
[1:08:06] verse 6 where you would say i am a child
[1:08:10] of this end time whose heart has been
[1:08:14] turned back
[1:08:15] because every single believer that goes
[1:08:18] in the rapture will have that for a
[1:08:19] testimony my heart has been turned back
[1:08:22] i've received a new heart i've received
[1:08:25] a new spirit i received his heart i
[1:08:28] received his spirit there's got to come
[1:08:30] a generation that even on a wednesday
[1:08:33] night no matter how you feel
[1:08:35] you are the word made manifest
[1:08:41] hallelujah
[1:08:42] there's got to be enough power and blood
[1:08:45] to wipe away our complexes and wipe away
[1:08:48] our past life and if the blood of jesus
[1:08:50] you just sang about it
[1:08:52] if the blood of jesus is not rich enough
[1:08:55] and powerful enough to take away our
[1:08:58] sins there's no power that's greater
[1:09:00] than god's power
[1:09:02] but you've got to believe it you've got
[1:09:04] to finally anchor your faith and stop
[1:09:07] putting it back on yourself or putting
[1:09:09] it back on your spouse or putting it
[1:09:11] back on your father or your mother or
[1:09:14] something in your past or another
[1:09:16] minister you've got to say i'm
[1:09:18] fulfilling malachi 4 6
[1:09:22] whose hearts are going to be turned back
[1:09:25] hello believers are you rugged believers
[1:09:27] tonight
[1:09:29] this isn't for the childish and just for
[1:09:30] the immature these are for believers
[1:09:33] that put their eagle talons down in the
[1:09:35] word and say that is my absolute
[1:09:39] now first thessalonians chapter 4. we've
[1:09:41] got to go back there as we go now deeper
[1:09:44] into this message
[1:09:47] this is the rapture
[1:09:49] where brother john is speaking about
[1:09:50] tonight a rising raptured heart i'm
[1:09:53] going to bring you out of dallas texas
[1:09:56] and out of this local politics and
[1:09:58] culture and the weather 100 degrees
[1:10:01] today
[1:10:02] i'm trying to bring your mind up to a
[1:10:04] spiritual realm that we've got to live
[1:10:07] in a in a rising raptured heart
[1:10:11] that there is a global revival going on
[1:10:14] right now
[1:10:18] i think this church has been partakers
[1:10:20] of that even as of just even uh some
[1:10:23] months ago in the sweep of god through
[1:10:26] your assembly and it's happening in
[1:10:28] other states and in other countries
[1:10:29] where there are moves of god it's a
[1:10:31] sovereign move of god it's god answering
[1:10:34] his word that there has to be a
[1:10:37] generation whether you're young or
[1:10:39] whether you're old that you are going to
[1:10:41] manifest the rapture and the rapture is
[1:10:44] arising
[1:10:46] it's coming higher
[1:10:48] it's moving further than you have ever
[1:10:51] been before can i challenge you with
[1:10:53] that tonight lord take me further than
[1:10:56] i've ever been before this happened to
[1:10:58] me last week i began to just meditate on
[1:11:01] this lord take me to places that i've
[1:11:04] never even been before
[1:11:06] and i've been born and raised in this
[1:11:07] message but friends it's more than just
[1:11:09] regurgitating the same quote the same
[1:11:11] scriptures brother adam said the bible
[1:11:14] said quoting and putting it on the
[1:11:15] screen it's got to be where the holy
[1:11:17] ghost begins to strike a person
[1:11:20] and they know him
[1:11:25] do you know him tonight i'm i'm now
[1:11:27] taking the stethoscope and i'm looking
[1:11:29] deeper into your heart do you know him
[1:11:35] this church has been taught very good by
[1:11:36] your
[1:11:37] pastor and your ministry there are going
[1:11:39] to be people that come to him at that
[1:11:42] day
[1:11:43] and say lord lord haven't we done these
[1:11:45] things and oh the foolish virgin they
[1:11:47] they thought they had oil before we had
[1:11:49] or our lamps have gone out and we want
[1:11:52] the oil we want the holy ghost and they
[1:11:54] went to go and and they never got it
[1:11:58] the scripture never says that they got
[1:12:00] it
[1:12:00] they come back later knocking on the
[1:12:02] door and they say oh i don't even know
[1:12:04] you
[1:12:06] that's the foolish virgin that didn't
[1:12:08] have oil on their lamps
[1:12:11] that's not your type
[1:12:14] when i speak about arising and coming
[1:12:16] higher if you read matthew 25 the bible
[1:12:19] says they all slumbered and slept
[1:12:23] is that right
[1:12:25] i preached a whole message on this
[1:12:27] sunday but i'm not going to do that
[1:12:28] tonight to you but they all slumbered
[1:12:31] and slept means the wise
[1:12:34] virgins there was a season when they
[1:12:37] slumbered and they slept
[1:12:39] but then there came a word and a message
[1:12:41] saying that behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:12:45] behold your bridegroom is here
[1:12:48] and you were awakened you arose you you
[1:12:51] left your lane down and your dormant and
[1:12:54] your backslidden and your the way you
[1:12:56] thought in the world or the way you
[1:12:58] thought in denominations friend don't
[1:13:00] bring denominations into this message
[1:13:03] and expect us to bow down to your past
[1:13:07] belief system
[1:13:08] friends there's got to be a whole new
[1:13:10] heart given to you a whole new spirit a
[1:13:13] whole new appetite a whole new love
[1:13:17] i say god give us to that tonight
[1:13:19] friends this message has got to go
[1:13:21] beyond your intellect
[1:13:26] you'll never figure it out you'll never
[1:13:28] be smart enough you'll you'll never know
[1:13:30] where everything fits
[1:13:33] by that age you'll probably start losing
[1:13:35] your mind and you'll forget about where
[1:13:37] it went and what box it was in and
[1:13:39] you'll start mispronouncing and saying
[1:13:41] that it just happens we're all getting
[1:13:43] older brother john's getting older
[1:13:46] you're getting older
[1:13:48] and you don't like to hear that oh i'm
[1:13:50] not getting older oh i'm
[1:13:52] i'm strong we can do this no it's not by
[1:13:55] might nor by power it's by the holy
[1:13:57] spirit
[1:13:59] even tonight you know friends we're here
[1:14:00] on a wednesday but if we all were given
[1:14:03] a new heart and a new spirit and
[1:14:06] something stony something worldly taken
[1:14:08] away a a spirit that's laying there
[1:14:10] dormant maybe for years
[1:14:14] now i'm bringing it up to september the
[1:14:17] 1st
[1:14:18] 2021
[1:14:20] we need the same spirit of god
[1:14:23] that was in that private counseling
[1:14:25] session with william branham to be in
[1:14:28] this service tonight
[1:14:31] i'm going to say it again the the bride
[1:14:33] is hungry and thirsty
[1:14:37] that's why i said that it's delicate
[1:14:39] when we start taking these issues and
[1:14:42] really going down to the heart of the
[1:14:43] matter there's a lot of people that go
[1:14:45] like this and they start you know
[1:14:47] quivering it's just that same we're all
[1:14:50] in the flesh whether you're spiritual
[1:14:52] carnal we're all in the flesh we we got
[1:14:54] flesh but there's a spiritual part of us
[1:14:57] that we need to tap into
[1:15:00] and when you hear the word something
[1:15:01] begins to quiver something begins to
[1:15:03] move haven't you recognized that's the
[1:15:06] holy spirit
[1:15:10] so i'm going down to this part of the
[1:15:12] matter
[1:15:13] tonight and when i look at y'all like
[1:15:16] this you're all blurry
[1:15:19] because i'm not using these now
[1:15:22] i'm not focusing in on how you're
[1:15:23] dressed and
[1:15:25] and your hair i'm now coming down to the
[1:15:27] heart of the matter we
[1:15:28] remember last time we spoke about how
[1:15:30] long it takes for a heart surgery does
[1:15:33] anybody remember
[1:15:34] come on six weeks ago
[1:15:38] excellent brother jackson
[1:15:42] it can take between three
[1:15:44] and six hours for heart surgery
[1:15:47] so sunday morning sunday night wednesday
[1:15:49] night we're about close to six hours
[1:15:52] but by the time we finally get it by the
[1:15:54] time we finally
[1:15:56] get to the place that god uncovers all
[1:15:59] our our skin our sinew and pulls back
[1:16:03] and starts dealing with the heart of the
[1:16:05] matter it's not just well just take a
[1:16:07] little pill god bless you brother oh you
[1:16:09] played good tonight oh you're a nice
[1:16:11] deacon in our church you're a nice
[1:16:13] sunday school teacher they had tried
[1:16:15] that for years
[1:16:18] heavenly father
[1:16:20] we need our church services to be with
[1:16:22] the same intensity as when brother
[1:16:25] branham sat in front of a sister that
[1:16:27] was tormented and had trouble there has
[1:16:30] to be a burden in the church
[1:16:32] for those days to end that we just
[1:16:36] continue having services and it's never
[1:16:39] deals with the heart of the issue
[1:16:52] now when you look at first thessalonians
[1:16:54] 4 16
[1:16:56] the lord himself
[1:16:57] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:17:01] with the voice of an archangel with the
[1:17:03] trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:17:04] shall rise first
[1:17:06] then these things should already be
[1:17:08] happening as he descends
[1:17:13] in the rapture message december the 4th
[1:17:15] 1965 i was just in arizona this is yuma
[1:17:18] arizona brother branham said the word
[1:17:20] rapture and the bible is not even used
[1:17:22] at all we put that word in there but the
[1:17:25] bible says caught up
[1:17:27] being caught up and he and he's quoting
[1:17:29] out of first thessalonians here the
[1:17:31] order of the great rapture and he reads
[1:17:33] that down that we read in verse 13 14 15
[1:17:39] verse 16
[1:17:41] verse 17 can you put verse 17 up then we
[1:17:45] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:17:47] caught up together he's talking about
[1:17:49] the rapture
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:52] before that great catching away there
[1:17:55] has to be a catching up and a rising up
[1:17:58] now
[1:17:59] or you'll never have that rapture if you
[1:18:02] don't receive this appearing
[1:18:05] brother branham's just described
[1:18:07] giving this the word of god don't you
[1:18:08] just love a prophet
[1:18:10] you're not going to hear this in the
[1:18:11] denomination
[1:18:13] you're going to hear this out of the
[1:18:14] dallas globe or off your little cell
[1:18:17] phone device or wherever you get your
[1:18:19] media feed or whatever off of instagram
[1:18:22] we have heard thus sayeth the lord
[1:18:25] that the lord himself is going to
[1:18:27] descend he said there's three things
[1:18:29] that is to happen before the lord
[1:18:32] himself appears a shout a voice and a
[1:18:35] trumpet has to happen before jesus
[1:18:38] appears jesus does all three of them
[1:18:42] when he's descending
[1:18:44] are we together tonight this isn't too
[1:18:46] deep but we are going deep enough to let
[1:18:49] you know that the shout has already
[1:18:52] happened
[1:18:54] he's already done these as he's
[1:18:56] descending
[1:18:58] i'm quoting out of the rapture message
[1:19:01] shout voice trumpet has to happen before
[1:19:04] jesus appears he does all three of them
[1:19:06] while he's descending a shout it's the
[1:19:09] message going forth the living bread of
[1:19:12] life bringing forth the bride
[1:19:16] come out of her my people come out of
[1:19:19] the world come out of your nonsense come
[1:19:22] out of your busyness
[1:19:25] we need to preach this and message
[1:19:27] churches on september 1st come out of
[1:19:29] your busyness
[1:19:31] you that are hanging down to the things
[1:19:33] of this world sports fashion finances
[1:19:36] politics afghanistan whatever that's
[1:19:39] holding you down
[1:19:41] we need to feed off of a message
[1:19:44] that is to call us together and bring
[1:19:47] forth the bride
[1:19:52] arise bride
[1:19:54] where are you sons
[1:19:56] of the gospel sons of the message
[1:20:00] where are you daughters of the cross
[1:20:03] where are you tonight where are you
[1:20:05] young men middle age older brothers
[1:20:09] where your heart has been turned back
[1:20:12] and your vigorous strong like caleb that
[1:20:14] can say i'm stronger now than i was
[1:20:17] years ago
[1:20:19] but god is working with some of our
[1:20:21] younger ones in middle age the same
[1:20:23] experience you had he's trying to awaken
[1:20:26] them to a rise up
[1:20:29] i tell you friends it's not an easy age
[1:20:31] to be living in uh i'm preaching a
[1:20:33] sunday morning message on a wednesday
[1:20:35] night it's very difficult to cut through
[1:20:38] all the unbelief of laodicea and all the
[1:20:41] things of this world we're so tapped
[1:20:43] into school and university and jobs
[1:20:47] but in the midst of all of that the
[1:20:49] bride is rising i see you rising
[1:20:53] i see you sister coming out of that
[1:20:56] depression coming out of that trouble
[1:20:58] coming out of that heart trouble that
[1:21:01] you're in
[1:21:03] i see you brother arising and the
[1:21:05] questions and the inability to be honest
[1:21:08] with your wife or be honest with your
[1:21:10] children you've got to arise
[1:21:14] god's given you strength and courage
[1:21:17] that your life isn't over your ministry
[1:21:19] isn't over your service to the lord
[1:21:21] isn't over i'm breathing you hope
[1:21:24] tonight
[1:21:25] come on friends we ought to be mature
[1:21:27] enough that if this is for one person in
[1:21:29] your church you ought to be said oh god
[1:21:31] give a resurrection and a rising
[1:21:38] it took a deacon to be dealt with and a
[1:21:40] sunday school teacher to bring revival
[1:21:42] back to brother johnson's church
[1:21:44] does this church want a real revival
[1:21:47] to continue
[1:21:49] then there's got to be a laying aside
[1:21:51] of all our unbelief all the sin all the
[1:21:54] remember the number one heart disease in
[1:21:58] america what is it
[1:22:00] it's sin disease
[1:22:02] what's the number one killer
[1:22:05] remember you can google it and the world
[1:22:08] will tell you it's heart disease
[1:22:10] but brother branham said it's not true
[1:22:12] the number one killer
[1:22:14] is sin disease
[1:22:16] it's very simple sin unbelief not
[1:22:19] believing
[1:22:20] just not taking the word and and
[1:22:22] believing it
[1:22:25] oh god
[1:22:28] how many believe the perfect word has
[1:22:30] come no
[1:22:32] i'm in my examination part of tonight
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:36] how are you all doing tonight
[1:22:38] how are y'all doing tonight
[1:22:41] has the perfect word come
[1:22:44] then there ought to be a perfect faith
[1:22:47] if malachi 4 5 has come and a spirit of
[1:22:51] elijah's come with a rapturing message
[1:22:53] then where is the generation that's
[1:22:56] going to feed off of that message and
[1:22:58] have their heart literally turned back
[1:23:02] i'm asking you tonight where are you
[1:23:04] tonight
[1:23:06] you say well here i am i've been here
[1:23:09] well maybe god's calling one of your
[1:23:10] children one of your teenagers maybe
[1:23:12] your wife or husband the lights are just
[1:23:14] coming on tonight maybe tonight the key
[1:23:17] is in the lock of something you say oh
[1:23:19] we've heard that before well somebody
[1:23:21] else is maybe hearing it for the first
[1:23:23] time
[1:23:23] and the key is turning in the lock and
[1:23:25] the tumblers are working and something's
[1:23:27] moving inside of them that's the holy
[1:23:29] ghost
[1:23:31] it's like a magnet moving across
[1:23:39] but if a deacon
[1:23:40] and a sunday school teacher
[1:23:43] supposed to be mature in the word and
[1:23:45] down the road could be actually dealing
[1:23:47] with those type of issues
[1:23:51] cannot our children or our young people
[1:23:53] or a new convert be struggling
[1:23:55] i'm asking a question
[1:23:57] examination time
[1:24:00] someone has trouble someone has a heart
[1:24:01] issue someone has a
[1:24:03] and they're an older person they're
[1:24:05] somebody that should know better
[1:24:08] then is it even more where satan is
[1:24:11] trying to run rampant and cause
[1:24:12] spiritual
[1:24:14] cancer and choking out the hearts of
[1:24:17] god's people but god right at the end
[1:24:19] time is doing a great awakening and
[1:24:21] arising and coming out of her my people
[1:24:24] now it's time to go into
[1:24:27] because you can come out of but you've
[1:24:29] got to go in too
[1:24:31] god can take a stoney heart out of you
[1:24:33] but you've got to receive a new heart
[1:24:35] friends we need to re
[1:24:37] be feeding off the word more than ever
[1:24:41] are we doing okay tonight
[1:24:43] a shout is the message going forth
[1:24:49] a messenger getting the people ready
[1:24:52] the second is the voice of the
[1:24:54] resurrection
[1:24:55] the same voice a loud voice that in john
[1:24:58] saint john 11 that called lazarus from
[1:25:01] the grave my my the voice of the
[1:25:03] resurrection
[1:25:05] speak in your name
[1:25:07] not john mary sue
[1:25:09] and brother branham said not ormond
[1:25:11] neville you can hear him right on the
[1:25:13] tape it's not your name like that it's
[1:25:15] it's preaching the word and that's your
[1:25:18] representation
[1:25:20] and you grab ahold of that and say that
[1:25:22] is mine
[1:25:24] that is mine
[1:25:27] i am that generation
[1:25:29] i am those ones whose hearts are going
[1:25:31] to be turned back
[1:25:33] let me tell you what tonight how many
[1:25:35] believe in miracles
[1:25:38] how many would like to see a miracle
[1:25:40] just look around the room a little bit
[1:25:43] don't look at me i'm a miracle too but
[1:25:45] look around the room
[1:25:47] some of you can look around the room
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:51] we are miracles
[1:25:53] to even have a desire for god
[1:25:55] in this wicked age you are a walking
[1:25:59] living breathing
[1:26:01] and you ought to thank god for that
[1:26:03] desire
[1:26:05] who gave you that heart who gives you
[1:26:07] that desire who gives you that kind of
[1:26:10] spirit who gives you that kind of of
[1:26:12] love for the things of god why are you
[1:26:14] here tonight
[1:26:18] why is he appearing to us in these
[1:26:20] meetings for it's to awaken our desires
[1:26:24] it's that when he speaks to us and
[1:26:25] awakens
[1:26:27] these desires that the atmosphere could
[1:26:29] just be right
[1:26:31] and something dropped down there into
[1:26:33] that
[1:26:34] predestinated seed
[1:26:41] maybe we ought to just bow our heads and
[1:26:43] say lord forgive us of our sin
[1:26:46] forgive us of our unbelief
[1:26:48] if there's any sin in our church take it
[1:26:50] away lord
[1:26:52] maybe you were too busy maybe you came
[1:26:53] in late or maybe you came in driving on
[1:26:56] the stress of these dallas roads and
[1:26:59] maybe from and tonight and but tonight
[1:27:01] you could just say lord forgive me of
[1:27:03] any sin in my life
[1:27:04] can we all do that right now i'm
[1:27:06] continuing on with the examination
[1:27:09] lord if there's anything in my heart
[1:27:10] that's evil take it away
[1:27:14] if there's anything that's not right
[1:27:16] take it away reveal it to me lord give
[1:27:19] me a sensitive heart
[1:27:26] lord let the voice of the resurrection
[1:27:28] speak among us and let there be the
[1:27:30] trump of god the sound of a trumpet
[1:27:32] which brother bradham said as a calling
[1:27:34] together come to the feasts it's the
[1:27:36] lamb's supper in the sky and assembling
[1:27:39] together the bride
[1:27:40] the feast of the trumpets the wedding
[1:27:42] supper we've all heard it over the years
[1:27:45] but i believe it's time to arise
[1:27:49] i i was just in another state and it was
[1:27:52] so wonderful to have a song leader
[1:27:56] actually song leading and leading the
[1:27:59] congregation in worship
[1:28:01] his own father and mother left the
[1:28:03] message
[1:28:05] actually went on you know these websites
[1:28:07] and facebook and actually our
[1:28:08] anti-message and anti-brother branham
[1:28:12] i think it's just a a wonderful
[1:28:14] testimony that god would raise up a
[1:28:17] young man that's married and has
[1:28:18] children to be a testimony to the world
[1:28:21] that i'm not going to be like my daddy
[1:28:23] i'm not going to be like my mommy god's
[1:28:26] given me a personal testimony
[1:28:28] that this message is thus saith the lord
[1:28:33] i say god give us more young people like
[1:28:35] that you're not going to get into heaven
[1:28:37] off your mom and dad's coat tales and oh
[1:28:39] my daddy's a preacher my mom is this and
[1:28:42] or are they a good person maybe they're
[1:28:44] not a good person
[1:28:47] maybe your friend is not serving the
[1:28:49] lord maybe you are being influenced in a
[1:28:52] you're going down
[1:28:56] you don't have to go down
[1:28:58] this is an ascending message this is a
[1:29:00] rising
[1:29:02] friends i would let that thing go and i
[1:29:04] would grab ahold of the spirit of god
[1:29:06] that's saying let's arise
[1:29:09] it's time to go
[1:29:13] i have his name in front of me but i'm
[1:29:15] not going to give it publicly but i
[1:29:16] thought my
[1:29:17] it's so wonderful to have a brother that
[1:29:20] can be stronger and bigger than family
[1:29:23] ties
[1:29:24] blood
[1:29:25] ties and be able to rise up and say no
[1:29:28] daddy mommy i love you but i love the
[1:29:31] lord jesus and i'm raising my family and
[1:29:34] the fear and admonition of the lord
[1:29:38] sounds like the sons of korah
[1:29:41] sounds like the children of korah which
[1:29:44] i also preached on that sunday night i'm
[1:29:45] not going to get into it but there were
[1:29:47] 11 psalms
[1:29:49] that were written in the psalms
[1:29:51] that you can read that were written for
[1:29:53] the psalm for the sons of korah
[1:29:55] wonderful wonderful
[1:29:58] david caught that inspiration how many
[1:30:00] has ever heard of the korites
[1:30:02] amen they were acting second chronicles
[1:30:05] can you just put that up second
[1:30:06] chronicles chapter 20 verse 19. this is
[1:30:10] years later
[1:30:13] years later
[1:30:15] after the bible says in numbers that not
[1:30:18] withstanding the children of korah died
[1:30:20] not this is second chronicles 20 verse
[1:30:23] 19 and the levites of the children of
[1:30:25] the koa heights
[1:30:27] and of the children of the korites stood
[1:30:29] up to praise the lord god of israel with
[1:30:32] a loud voice on high
[1:30:36] they could have lived their whole lives
[1:30:37] saying who's your daddy who is the
[1:30:39] father of your tribe korah oh that's
[1:30:41] horrible
[1:30:43] dathan and the byram and
[1:30:44] all these horrible things but no years
[1:30:47] later after they were swallowed up in
[1:30:49] the book of numbers you find a whole a
[1:30:52] group of a tribe of the koaheitz and the
[1:30:54] korites stood up to praise the lord god
[1:30:57] of israel with a loud voice
[1:30:59] their testimony went on for years in the
[1:31:02] message that we didn't stand with our
[1:31:05] father when he got swallowed up
[1:31:08] okay maybe you all need to have that in
[1:31:10] front of you numbers chapter 26
[1:31:13] verse 10.
[1:31:15] well let's start at verse 9 numbers 26
[1:31:17] verse 9. can we speak about this
[1:31:20] i see some of you haven't heard this
[1:31:21] before
[1:31:24] numbers 26 verse 9 and the sons of eliab
[1:31:27] nemiel and dathan and abyram this is
[1:31:29] that dayton and abyram which were famous
[1:31:32] in the congregation who strove against
[1:31:34] moses and against aaron and the company
[1:31:37] of korah when they strove against the
[1:31:39] lord verse 10 and the earth opened up
[1:31:42] her mouth and swallowed them up together
[1:31:44] with korah when that that company died
[1:31:47] what time the fire devoured 250 men and
[1:31:51] they became a sign verse 11 our next
[1:31:54] verse notwithstanding the children of
[1:31:57] korah died not
[1:32:02] hallelujah there were sons there were
[1:32:04] young people there were people that were
[1:32:06] looking at their dad being swallowed
[1:32:08] being being other young people and
[1:32:10] grandmas and uncles and being swallowed
[1:32:13] up
[1:32:14] we've seen them being swallowed up over
[1:32:16] the years song leaders deacons preachers
[1:32:18] people and maybe your church
[1:32:21] but there were a group as a generation
[1:32:23] standing right there saying i'm not
[1:32:24] going to go down with those i'm
[1:32:26] believing
[1:32:28] i'm going to stand with moses
[1:32:30] was a type of the prophet i'm going to
[1:32:32] stand with aaron which is a type of the
[1:32:34] ministry i'm going all the way with
[1:32:36] christ
[1:32:38] i'm looking at you in dallas tonight
[1:32:39] saying where are you sons and daughters
[1:32:42] that those things around you might be
[1:32:43] getting swallowed up by the world your
[1:32:45] eyes are looking up to him
[1:32:49] and years later in second chronicle
[1:32:52] chronicles you could find of the levites
[1:32:54] and of the children of the core heights
[1:32:56] children of the korites they stood up to
[1:32:58] praise the lord of god of israel with a
[1:33:00] loud voice
[1:33:02] they were not ashamed
[1:33:04] they said let my voice ring with those
[1:33:06] that are praising shouting
[1:33:09] rejoicing on a wednesday night i'm gonna
[1:33:12] put my voices with the believers
[1:33:15] friends we might be ridiculed out there
[1:33:17] we might be talked about out there
[1:33:19] website social media your friends your
[1:33:22] boss whatever might look down on you but
[1:33:25] amongst the believers there ought to be
[1:33:27] arising

[1:33:30] to be
[1:33:31] when i'm with you there ought to be
[1:33:33] enough energy coming back and forth
[1:33:39] see your minds might not understand

[1:34:00] now i'm going back to our opening
[1:34:02] scripture six weeks ago
[1:34:04] he's beautiful
[1:34:06] for situation
[1:34:08] but now after bringing that quote to you
[1:34:10] about
[1:34:11] our brother oh just get his name right
[1:34:13] brother shane and sister shane and the
[1:34:15] goodness of god
[1:34:17] to their family
[1:34:19] i can say tonight the goodness of god is
[1:34:22] so great
[1:34:24] the riches of the goodness of god oh
[1:34:26] tonight i would encourage you to take
[1:34:29] the hand of someone and let him lead you
[1:34:32] to the place you need to go
[1:34:35] and that's not brother john that's not
[1:34:37] any minister that is the lord jesus
[1:34:40] christ
[1:34:42] take the hand of god and let him lead
[1:34:45] you to the place where you ought to go
[1:34:52] that's the great physician
[1:34:54] that is the healer is in the house
[1:34:58] that is the doctor that does personal
[1:35:00] house calls
[1:35:03] brother branham talked about those
[1:35:04] doctors
[1:35:05] and they'd go through rivers and go
[1:35:07] through streams it'd be rain and snowing
[1:35:10] and they'd go to to the houses of people
[1:35:12] that were needy
[1:35:14] is that true though it's a real doctor
[1:35:19] not just fellowshipping with the homes
[1:35:20] of everybody's healthy everybody's good
[1:35:24] everybody's patting me on the back
[1:35:26] sometimes we need to break out of our
[1:35:28] comfort zone i don't know who the lord's
[1:35:30] talking to you need to break out of your
[1:35:32] comfort zone and visit someone in the
[1:35:34] church that's needy
[1:35:38] you need to break out of your realm of
[1:35:40] just being with your friends and
[1:35:41] realized friends friends if we can't win
[1:35:44] our friends and those that we know for
[1:35:47] the lord
[1:35:48] then there's no way we're going to win
[1:35:49] someone in the world
[1:35:51] lord let our hearts be turned back to
[1:35:53] you
[1:35:54] we are in the last laps of the race my
[1:35:57] my precious friends

[1:36:03] weary

[1:36:08] you might have come in with huge issues
[1:36:10] and huge troubles
[1:36:12] say my problem is very very special no
[1:36:16] there's been literally
[1:36:18] millions and billions of people
[1:36:20] throughout the years
[1:36:22] there's nothing new under the sun
[1:36:26] it's satan just cycling people through
[1:36:29] his death
[1:36:30] death concentration camps and you need
[1:36:32] to rise up and say i'm not going to be a
[1:36:35] statistic i'm not going to be another
[1:36:37] number
[1:36:38] and i really feel tonight to say this
[1:36:40] very strongly i'll be leaving in a few
[1:36:42] hours tomorrow
[1:36:44] what more could god do for you
[1:36:47] what more could god do for dallas
[1:36:51] now i'm speaking very clearly as a heart
[1:36:53] surgeon you've received a prophet you
[1:36:55] have a pastor you have evangelists you
[1:36:58] have teachers you have apostles
[1:37:02] i'm really being serious tonight what
[1:37:04] more is it going to take to get your
[1:37:06] attention
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:10] what more can god do for you
[1:37:14] you've been to conventions you've been
[1:37:16] to camps you've had special services
[1:37:19] i'm being honest
[1:37:21] some of us are so spoiled
[1:37:23] we're spoiled so rotten we take
[1:37:25] everything for granted especially in
[1:37:27] america it's burnt over so many times
[1:37:30] and we need to say god give me a new
[1:37:32] heart give me a
[1:37:34] give me a fresh heart lord
[1:37:37] renew my love renew my passion
[1:37:40] give me feeling back again
[1:37:43] sometimes we lose our natural feeling
[1:37:46] our affection even for one another
[1:37:48] people that we ought to love the most
[1:37:53] now i'm just about starting to preach
[1:37:54] and it's time to end
[1:37:58] the things we ought to love the most we
[1:38:00] start to disdain we take it for granted
[1:38:04] we don't appreciate it we don't we're
[1:38:06] not thankful we're not grateful it's a
[1:38:09] sign of this age
[1:38:11] and it's going down this
[1:38:13] world is falling apart
[1:38:17] but in the midst of that chaos is a
[1:38:20] rising is a is an ascending is a is a
[1:38:23] rapture
[1:38:25] and that's what i came here for on this
[1:38:27] wednesday night is to remind you on the
[1:38:30] six-week
[1:38:31] look check-up for your heart
[1:38:33] make sure your heart is right

[1:38:54] we are hearing the last messages before
[1:38:57] the resurrection of the saints
[1:39:00] we have heard a shout
[1:39:02] out we're we've been under the influence
[1:39:04] of the voice of the resurrection for
[1:39:07] years
[1:39:10] and some of you still think the trumpet
[1:39:12] of god is
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:16] it's all part of a calling it's all part
[1:39:18] of god getting your attention
[1:39:21] that all happens before we see him in
[1:39:24] the sky
[1:39:25] there's got to be a people that are
[1:39:27] awake they're aroused
[1:39:29] watchy therefore
[1:39:32] have your lamps trimmed make sure
[1:39:35] there's oil in the lamp
[1:39:37] i'm just going to say it again brother
[1:39:39] jackson what more do we need to have as
[1:39:42] a church to get our attention
[1:39:49] it was last time we were here in the
[1:39:51] afternoon there was a man met me at the
[1:39:53] restaurant going out the door and he's
[1:39:55] talked about a a certain
[1:39:57] lady who had a
[1:39:59] certain heart born with a hole in her
[1:40:01] heart
[1:40:02] age four they found it and they stitched
[1:40:04] it up
[1:40:05] but she had gotten older through her
[1:40:07] teenage years and then into her 50s it
[1:40:09] almost killed her with scars there were
[1:40:12] scars on her heart and they did another
[1:40:14] heart surgery
[1:40:17] and they put in a pacemaker a heart
[1:40:19] defibrillator and her heartbeat is
[1:40:21] connected to her cell phone and even the
[1:40:24] doctors at the hospital and at the
[1:40:26] doctor's office every so often they have
[1:40:28] to do check-ups and updates and
[1:40:31] maintenance and a tune-up and the very
[1:40:34] words of this man to me was she can feel
[1:40:37] that
[1:40:39] i got the notes right here
[1:40:41] i'm not going off a memory because i
[1:40:43] can't remember hardly six weeks ago
[1:40:47] but if that happens in the natural
[1:40:49] that a person can receive another heart
[1:40:52] and receive a defibrillator and
[1:40:54] something happened when i was four years
[1:40:56] older i had a murmuring heart or i had
[1:40:58] an issue in my life and there's been
[1:41:00] scars brother john but years down the
[1:41:03] road you can be connected to another
[1:41:07] that has knowledge and has understanding
[1:41:09] that's why brother branham would preach
[1:41:11] lean not to your own
[1:41:16] understanding and they said every so
[1:41:19] often they have to do check-ups and
[1:41:21] updates and maintenance and they do a
[1:41:23] tune-up on her heart and she can feel
[1:41:26] that friends if we lose the feeling of
[1:41:29] what we believe we have lost
[1:41:32] christ in our midst
[1:41:34] in the old testament they called it
[1:41:36] ichabod it means christ walked out of
[1:41:39] the room
[1:41:41] you can name it claim it and whatever
[1:41:43] you want but if christ leaves the room
[1:41:45] chaos follows
[1:41:47] god put some feeling back in my heart
[1:41:49] again you're doing a checkup you're
[1:41:51] doing a tune-up then we got to feel it
[1:41:57] later on that same week we went on down
[1:42:00] and saw brother tim pruitt and sister
[1:42:02] karen pruitt with brother donny reagan
[1:42:04] and brother ron spencer and the brothers
[1:42:06] and then we came back and on friday
[1:42:08] morning was with some of your brothers
[1:42:10] in the church having a bible study and
[1:42:12] we talked to one another about the
[1:42:14] brokenhearted out of isaiah and luke
[1:42:17] when jesus took the scroll and and he
[1:42:19] began to read there that i've come to
[1:42:21] bind up those with the brokenhearted
[1:42:25] that only confirms that it's possible to
[1:42:28] have a broken heart
[1:42:31] and bro and brother branham said jesus
[1:42:33] died of a broken heart
[1:42:35] so if that was true in the male part is
[1:42:38] it possible that the bride
[1:42:40] have a broken heart but god's not going
[1:42:42] to leave you there
[1:42:44] receive a new heart
[1:42:46] receive the heart of god
[1:42:49] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:42:51] their strength
[1:42:53] just lift up your hands and thank the
[1:42:55] lord right now just just praise the lord
[1:42:57] for
[1:42:58] giving you a heart giving you a desire
[1:43:01] giving you something that would yearn
[1:43:08] so we have accepted the diagnosis of the
[1:43:11] doctor
[1:43:12] stop being in denial stop constantly
[1:43:15] pushing it back and not being truthful
[1:43:18] if you go that way friends you're going
[1:43:20] to continue to die and things will
[1:43:22] unravel spiritually
[1:43:28] you've got to take the prescription of
[1:43:30] the word
[1:43:31] when god reveals the condition
[1:43:34] you've got to walk in your healing
[1:43:36] and sometimes it gets very sensitive
[1:43:39] and very delicate
[1:43:41] but somebody's got to say it
[1:43:44] god anoint someone to say
[1:43:50] it there was a lady i just
[1:43:53] heard yesterday
[1:43:55] holy spirit
[1:43:56] was dealing with her heart
[1:43:59] to go to the doctor and get a checkup
[1:44:00] she's young she's vibrant i'm saying
[1:44:02] this in closing
[1:44:04] she's very healthy person
[1:44:06] just heard this yesterday
[1:44:09] something just witnessed in her heart
[1:44:10] you need to go to the doctor and get a
[1:44:12] checkup

[1:44:19] small voice

[1:44:22] there and they found a malignant
[1:44:25] tumor a cyst in her body
[1:44:27] and the doctor was able to go in and cut
[1:44:29] that out
[1:44:31] and in the doctor's words they said
[1:44:35] you better be thankful you came in
[1:44:37] because if that would have lingered in
[1:44:39] your body for another season of time and
[1:44:41] they mentioned it how long
[1:44:43] it could have been fatal to your life
[1:44:46] and she's rejoicing she's thanking the
[1:44:48] lord she's she's so mindful it's not
[1:44:51] medicine it's not doctors it's not the
[1:44:54] hospital

[1:44:57] but the holy spirit has a vision for
[1:45:00] your life and it's not for death it's

[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:39] oh
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:51:00] let's sing that first verse again
[1:51:06] and
[1:51:09] you know our
[1:51:10] nature it just seems like john was in
[1:51:12] our service with us
[1:51:15] sunday night
[1:51:18] our first nature is i'm going to go make
[1:51:20] all this right
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:25] you'll find yourself in the same place
[1:51:27] 40 years later
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:31] as i testify to you sunday
[1:51:33] things that i tried to fix with the
[1:51:35] mechanics
[1:51:37] for 50 years
[1:51:40] one day i realized
[1:51:41] i can't fix it
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:44] but there's a spirit
[1:51:49] there's a quickening power
[1:51:54] that
[1:51:55] goes beyond anything that
[1:51:58] we can do
[1:52:02] and it it's
[1:52:03] so easy
[1:52:06] you just ask
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:09] he says come unto me all ye that are
[1:52:11] heavy laden
[1:52:12] and i'll give you rest
[1:52:15] in no wise will i turn you away amen
[1:52:19] so if he spoke to your heart tonight and
[1:52:22] as he did mine
[1:52:26] i thought those words were
[1:52:29] so beautiful that brother branham said
[1:52:31] just
[1:52:32] make it right
[1:52:34] and go on
[1:52:37] you can't drive
[1:52:39] looking in the rear view mirror amen
[1:52:42] there comes a time you have to leave
[1:52:44] those things which are behind behind
[1:52:46] and press for the higher calling
[1:52:49] but i think
[1:52:50] what our brother's saying so much is
[1:52:53] that
[1:52:54] when you examine yourself you find out
[1:52:56] that
[1:52:58] the only thing that's missing
[1:53:00] is him
[1:53:04] and we let him into lots of places
[1:53:09] i'm sure those
[1:53:10] brother and sister they serve god many a
[1:53:13] good day
[1:53:15] they did a lot of great things for the
[1:53:17] kingdom of god
[1:53:19] but there comes that time that it
[1:53:21] becomes personal
[1:53:24] where
[1:53:25] i want
[1:53:27] that real personal
[1:53:30] touch
[1:53:31] from the lord
[1:53:34] and you can't do anything to get it
[1:53:36] but just surrender
[1:53:39] and invite them in
[1:53:41] and i don't care if you're in the back
[1:53:44] tonight or in the four year
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:51] in here on this platform
[1:53:54] wherever it is our answer
[1:53:58] is to get face to face
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:04] and that's all that we can do
[1:54:07] so for a moment as we sing this course
[1:54:10] again
[1:54:11] don't go back and meditate on
[1:54:14] all the things and
[1:54:16] how that you're sorry and
[1:54:19] how that you want to make it right
[1:54:22] just take a moment and look in his face
[1:54:26] and say lord you know all these things
[1:54:28] already
[1:54:31] i want to invite you in
[1:54:35] to every aspect of my life
[1:54:39] i'm asking your spirit to come into
[1:54:43] my body
[1:54:46] and bring this whole body into
[1:54:48] subjection to your word
[1:54:51] if the spirit that raised you from the
[1:54:53] dead
[1:54:56] would come dwell in me
[1:54:59] it would quicken this mortal body
[1:55:02] the one that i live in
[1:55:05] the one that
[1:55:06] i sin in
[1:55:08] it would transform not only my heart but
[1:55:11] this very
[1:55:12] life body
[1:55:13] that i'm in
[1:55:15] lord and that's what i need
[1:55:21] it's what i need lord it's what i want
[1:55:23] lord i can't make a step
[1:55:26] without you
[1:55:29] but with you lord i can overcome
[1:55:31] anything
[1:55:35] and make it personal tonight
[1:55:37] don't go and say i'm going to go home
[1:55:39] and give this up i'm not going to play
[1:55:41] this game again
[1:55:43] i'm never going to watch that program
[1:55:45] again i'm going to go throw the cd out
[1:55:48] of the car
[1:55:50] you let him apply the token
[1:55:53] amen let him come in here first
[1:55:56] and all those things will become easy to
[1:55:58] do
[1:56:01] they'll become so easy to do
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:06] so bow your heart
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:11] bend your knees
[1:56:14] ask the spirit to come
[1:56:19] turn your eyes from evil and
[1:56:21] turn them to the lord
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:24] and watch what god will do for you
[1:56:28] there'll be a transformation in you that
[1:56:30] you on the can't hardly comprehend
[1:56:33] it was possible

[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:12] brother craig
[2:01:13] desires to be baptized
[2:01:17] you know the great scripture that
[2:01:21] was spoken that
[2:01:23] the lord said go on to all the world
[2:01:25] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:01:28] the son and the holy ghost
[2:01:32] but the one things that the disciples
[2:01:34] had is they knew who he was
[2:01:38] they knew the father
[2:01:40] because the scripture said have no other
[2:01:42] gods before me
[2:01:44] they knew the father and by divine
[2:01:47] revelation
[2:01:49] they knew that jesus was his son
[2:01:52] and he the scripture said that he came
[2:01:54] in the father's name
[2:01:56] so they knew who he was
[2:01:58] so when they said go baptize in the name
[2:02:01] of the father the son and the holy ghost
[2:02:03] knowing who he was
[2:02:05] they knew what the name was
[2:02:07] that's why peter on the day said repent
[2:02:10] every one of you and be baptized in the
[2:02:12] name of the lord jesus christ having the
[2:02:15] keys and we'll read our baptismal
[2:02:17] scripture if the brothers we go get
[2:02:19] ready brother jackson taber craig get
[2:02:22] ready and we'll have a baptism those of
[2:02:24] you that have to go
[2:02:26] maybe you have to be there early for
[2:02:28] work or
[2:02:30] or something like that feel free to go
[2:02:32] those that would like to remain and
[2:02:35] fellowship and the baptism of our
[2:02:37] our our brother we certainly do this let
[2:02:40] us read our scriptures
[2:02:42] as we prepare it says in the acts
[2:02:45] the second chapter and the 36th verse it
[2:02:48] says therefore let all the house of
[2:02:50] israel
[2:02:52] know assuredly
[2:02:54] that god hath made the same jesus
[2:02:58] whom ye have crucified
[2:03:01] both lord and christ
[2:03:03] now when they heard this
[2:03:05] they were pricked in their heart
[2:03:08] and said unto peter
[2:03:10] and the rest of the apostles
[2:03:12] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:03:16] and peter said unto them repent
[2:03:19] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:03:22] name of jesus christ for the remission
[2:03:25] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:03:29] the holy ghost
[2:03:31] and for this promise is unto you
[2:03:34] and to your children
[2:03:36] and to all them that are far off
[2:03:39] even as many as the lord our god shall
[2:03:43] call
[2:03:44] and with many other words
[2:03:46] did they testify and exhort saying
[2:03:49] save yourself from this up towards
[2:03:52] generation
[2:03:53] amen wasn't that the word to us tonight
[2:03:56] save yourself from this mess
[2:03:58] that's out here
[2:04:00] there's no hope left
[2:04:02] our only hope is in jesus christ
[2:04:05] and his righteousness
[2:04:08] he's here for you
[2:04:10] you're not hiding anything
[2:04:12] he already knows
[2:04:14] the beginning from the end
[2:04:17] but he's here to offer you himself
[2:04:20] and he's nothing greater than a man can
[2:04:23] do no greater love can he show than to
[2:04:25] lay down his life jesus laid down his
[2:04:28] life that we can be transformed and come
[2:04:31] away from those things that burden us
[2:04:34] lord bless you let's pray for our
[2:04:36] brother as he
[2:04:37] follows obedience to the scripture that
[2:04:40] the promises of god will follow and god
[2:04:42] will fill his heart with all the love
[2:04:45] and goodness and answer every question
[2:04:48] he has in his life
[2:04:50] and i would i know that each of us
[2:04:52] desire to be perfect
[2:04:55] well i'll tell you i've been traveling
[2:04:56] the road aways and i'll tell you from

[2:12:35] little testimony before we baptize him
[2:12:38] go ahead our brother
[2:12:40] my name is craig's
[2:12:41] brothers and sisters i've been coming
[2:12:42] here about six months
[2:12:44] and came to the revelation that
[2:12:46] there is only one god in the way i was
[2:12:48] baptized was probably incorrect as for
[2:12:51] the remission of sins
[2:12:53] and kind of as a testimony to others
[2:12:55] that i believed
[2:12:57] so um
[2:12:58] i want that quickening power that
[2:13:00] i don't have and i've been a believer
[2:13:03] and had that seat for a long time so
[2:13:05] i want to be baptized in the name of
[2:13:07] jesus christ in the correct way and get
[2:13:10] that quickening power
[2:13:14] [Applause]
[2:13:19] the best way to get it is follow the
[2:13:21] formula
[2:13:22] right you're baptized you shall receive
[2:13:25] the gift of the holy ghost
[2:13:28] amen our precious brother
[2:13:30] according to the word of god
[2:13:33] and the commission and peter
[2:13:36] on the day of pentecost knowing who
[2:13:39] jesus was and knowing the father
[2:13:42] was one god he baptized in the name of
[2:13:45] the lord jesus christ and according to
[2:13:47] the word of god we baptize you in the
[2:13:50] name of the lord jesus christ
[2:13:55] [Applause]
