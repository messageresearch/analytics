bibles we'll try not to be too long we'll try not to be long i was thinking about what brethren said they said we could just come to church and read the scripture that would be enough uh let's open our bibles in a scripture that our pastor read last sunday hebrews 11. we're gonna start there yes that's from verse one it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of god and so that things which are seen or made of things that do not appear i just want you to pay attention it says by faith we understand you know oftentimes when we within our minds when we think about faith it means we don't understand it we don't have to understand and i was thinking about it and it just dawned on me that faith is the understanding that you don't have to understand everything that's right you don't have to know how god is going to work it out when is he going to work it out exactly you just understand that it's it's god is going to do it if you promise it in his word it's going to come to pass that's the understanding that faith brings to us it says by faith abel by faith abel offered up often offered up offered up offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his own gift and by and by it being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god it says but without faith it's impossible to please god to please it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of him that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of god of things not seen as yet move with fear prepare an ark for the saving of his house by which by the which he condemned the world and became heir to the righteousness which is by faith by faith abraham it was when he was called of god when he was called to go out into a place which uh which should after receive for inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing wherein they went by faith he's so adjourned in the land of promise as as in a stranger it's his country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which he had which which had foundation whose build and maker was god and through faith also sarah herself received strength to receive the seed and was delivered a child when she was past the age because he's so adjourned he so because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprung there even even of one and him as good as dead so many of the stars of the sky and multitude and and as the sense which is by the the shore immutable innumerable it says these die all in faith not having received the promise but having seen them far off were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that there were strangers in pilgrim on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country it says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had the opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he had prepared for them a city by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he had received the promise offered him only on for his only begotten son of whom he was it was said that in isaac shall the seed be called a accounting that god accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence he also received him in a figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and eso and received things and and concerning things to come by faith jacob when he was dying blessed both sons joseph and worship and worship and leaning upon the top of his staff by faith joseph when he died made mention of the of the departing of the children of israel and gave them commandment concerning his bones by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he had he was it was a proper child because they they saw he was proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses when he saw when he he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter let's also turn one more scripture back in mark i believe it's mark 11. and let's start from verse 20. it says and and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter called to remember and said unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curseth is withered away and jesus answered and said unto them have faith in god for verily verily for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he hath said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what so what what what things soever ye desire when he prayed believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when he stand praying forgive forgive forgive if ye have art against against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you don't you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses that's why i had father we ask you bless your word in the name of jesus christ you pray amen may have your seats tonight i just want to speak for a few minutes there was just uh something that that came to my heart even as our pastor was talking about faith last sunday um and i i've i've been i've been studying on on the the perfect faith and just going over and some of the things that brother branham says to to just understand the even the very context of what he speaks in that book we we know if you read it you one of the things you realize is the creation of the scroll was a challenge that god gave him god wanted to elevate his faith here he was and he was trying to find some food to eat and he had hunted and done everything that he could and he didn't have it and and something within his heart and he heard the voice he said well why did you just speak it and so and he stood there and we know the story of all the stages that he went through trying to think it was just going out of his own mind and the things and speaking the squirrel and asking for some completely unreasonable way that the scroll will get to the place just because he wanted to make sure that he was in a vision he wanted to make sure is this really happening and and then he we went so when he preached that message perfect faith he's basically encouraging us or trying to bring us to a place where we could be lifted up in a place and he says this is to help to rub some of the unbelievable some of the make-believe i think he says that's the word he uses i'm trying to rob some of the make-believe and some of the things to get you to the place and and and to get us to a place where we can actually come into contact with god and receive the type of faith that we desire and out tonight i want to just speak for a little bit i want to speak on faith inspires a faith a faith inspired attitude a faith inspired attitude and i just thought in my heart that real faith inspires an attitude um a person who believes you you don't see them walking with the head down and wondering what am i going to eat tomorrow what's going to happen to me today and you know they're not moved by natural circumstances and and and to me that's such a paradox because in most circumstances we all move by the things that goes around us and even speaking to myself and and to me even as speaking of this it's more something that my heart is desiring to acquire to receive to to move up to it's not necessarily just some type of education something that we read we say what branham says and we try to repeat it but but how do we get how do i get myself to become to the place where i can receive the type of faith that even our prophet is speaking of because i realize it seems like our attitude depends on what's happening on that day you know if things seems to fall apart the whole day my my i mean so is the attitude it seems like you know it just seems like oh i wish you know i had hoped this was going to go okay but it didn't i hope that one you know i i did everything i could so this could work out how did it go wrong and and and we seem to be and and if you woke up in the day where everything went away not sure what's going on here so is your attitude you feel like oh you know your attitude is great and you know you have a smile on your face and and you you feel like your faith is just you know reason up a little more you feel like god is hearing you and in a day's way it doesn't go like plan the heaven is shut up god is no longer interested in you you know he's forsaken you and he's pulled out all his blessings he taught that you are not the child that he taught you where you know all everything falls apart but how do we get to a place where we are not moved how do we get to a place where we are not shaken how do we get to a place it doesn't matter what's going on outside i'm going to stand here because the word of god said so because he promised and he's able to keep the promise so as i said you know the the the the the attitude and an inspired attitude the faith that that is that inspires an attitude when you read the word attitude it speaks about it it's uh and and it says it's a subtle way of thinking it's a feeling for someone or something typically is uh is it says it's reflected in a person's behavior so so one cannot claim to have faith and not not being reflected in the behavior so the attitude and the faith is directly connected because the person who has faith it's reflected in the attitude i was thinking about the prophet speaks about the slave from africa who was brought and he said that they took him and they took him and he was the son of a king and they took him and yeah he was in the strange place where he didn't know anybody and yet he was in sleeping with other slaves and everything and and yet the prophet said there was something different about this particular slave because when they came they realized everything they assigned him to do he did it perfectly and he did it he never wandered he never questioned he never he did everything orderly and he wasn't uh his wall didn't fall apart like the others where they lost hope and even though he knew perhaps he'll never go home even though he knew that that was perhaps the end of him but one thing that was different about this slave but him says that he knew who he was and that he knew that he was a son of a king he knew that as it was he was representative of a certain country and a certain place so the things around him didn't face him the world around him didn't cause him to fall into pieces and i began to think about it and i began to think even about myself it's very important we realize that we are not of this world and i want to say this this world could fall apart and it is falling apart your life can fall apart your the whole world you could lose your house you could lose your family you could lose everything what is it that's so important more than the eternal life that god has given you to come to the place where you realize that this life can be taken away i have another life already inside of me and there's another body already waiting for me and the reason why we fall apart because our focus becomes on the present we we we forget the blessings that's upon us we forget everything you know something goes wrong directly we go read the book of job and uh we sympathize with job and we forget that we're still sleeping in the house we have a car to drive we have food in the pantry we feel like oh i'm job and all my life is falling apart and oh i i have this sickness and directly we we feel like we have boiled like job had and we feel we have all those things and and yet we are some of the black blessed people there are on the face of the earth as and yet we are compared to other christians in other country we have it more than anybody how do we move from there and get to a place where we have a faith that is inspired a faith that inspires an attitude in us to realize that i have been blessed here and no one is going to move me until god is done with me jesus didn't create that faith within himself faith is a gift of god god placed something within him and he knew without a shadow of a doubt based on the relationship that he had with god that i have been placed here for a purpose so it says an attitude is a manner or it's a disposition it's a feeling of a position it's a feel a feeling or position etc it's regard a personal thing it's a tendency or orientation especially of the mind so you can have an orientation towards negativity or positivity towards something it's a thinking where something is going on and and and the mind begin to wander or something you think about it as a other uh as something being positive or being completely negative but adam speaks and he says this in the message uh uh moses he says he says now and and and i want you to to see how he's bringing this out it says now the only thing the only thing the only thing that is for you that is for you is to stimulate your is to stimulate the faith of the people that they might see god god's willingness to heal the people it says now as far as it comes to healing it's your faith in god your pastor can anoint you with oil at your own church and your faith in god will bring the same result now yeah and i want to say this it's it's in the atonement it's not something that somebody brings to you it's in the atonement it's in the price that was paid for it's part of calvary it's the benefit of calvary it's part of the work that god has already completed so as we sit here it's very important we realize as far as the work of god it's all completed we're not sitting here talking about a work that needs to be done that needs to be performed no the our faith gets us into a place where we receive that work where we walk into that work and it comes to pass within our life but as far as god is concerned the work is already completed so now he says god is a healer no ma he says no man is a healer god is a healer these gifts are only to show you what god's attitude towards the people what what's god's attitude towards the people to get you back to believe in god because if you haven't got faith enough to believe for your sickness for your sick body you haven't got enough faith to believe in rapture so now here he is is telling us these things are done so we can uh have our faith lifted up so we can come into such a faith where we can come to the place where we realize god's a healer nothing is going to change that you you can die of sickness today it doesn't mean god has stopped healing that's in the disposition of god and what he wants to do with you but as far as god is concerned his what it was in the beginning is still the same today he hasn't changed one bit so where we where where we come short is when we think that everything that god is in regards to us it changes based on who we are or it changes based on where we are no god is wanting to move us forward into faith so we can receive all of those blessings that are waiting for us so here he is he's showing what is god's attitude towards man god wants you to be healed god wants you to be safe god wants you to be prosperous he died for you he gave his life for you he he he done all that he could his attitude in fact says that he died for the sin of the whole world that's the kind of god he is he's not a a god who hates you he's not a god who's against you he's not a god who thinks evil about you he's a god who loves you even the evil that comes upon you is to return you back in the path that he wants for you to be and if we can come into that mindset it helps us come to the place where the the things that happen around us will not have to move us because we understand that all things work together for the good of them that love him all it is is god trying to bring me in the path that he's predestinated for me to be i don't have to worry about outside all i care about is what my father thinks god's attitude towards us he says that's what that's what he says and he continues on it says he says now i see now it says i see now if i could get my version of showing you god's attitude towards healing he says if you've been preaching divine healing and practice divine healing through the age and you have the gospel of the holy spirit then brother sister the same result would come right here this afternoon by healing it was the holy ghost it was it was by the holy ghost you believe that sure but when i got to preaching when i got to preaching of the of the power of the holy ghost and he began to take the word of god and place it out there it says every holy ghost filled child will reach out and grab that and grab and grab it like that my they they grab it they grab it right out it helps it says it's a they're hungering for it brother if you will turn around and realize he was wounded for your transgression you talk about god's attitude uh you know while we were yet sinner and i'll say this it will take us eternity to even comprehend the very love of god that it will allow even for us to come down as sinners and it will allow us to do all kinds of things our mind wanted to do it'll allow us to spew out all kind of nonsense and say all kinds of things we wanted and be caught up in all kinds of sin but yet he made a provision that one day will be changed you think about the love of god and that it would he send his only begotten pervador says it's not even that he sent his son but he himself will come and and and dwell in the mortal body and give the life of the only one who couldn't give his life who shouldn't give his life the only one who could condemn the only one who could stand and say i have the right to destroy the whole thing that he will come in and give his life and and through your stumbling and your failing and everything and and he's watching you as a baby just stepping out of sin and out and and go and mess up your faith and all and it's just watching and watching and being patient with you oh i tell you just just breaks the heart to realize that he could have taken your life away for one cuts word he had the right to do it but yet he let you live so that i can do what oh i say like david it says if you let this mortal leaves i'll praise you it says i just one more person just one more body all i want to use the whole strength that you have given me every aorta every strength within my body i want to use it to praise you why because there is no god like he is there's never been one even closer to him he's the creator of heaven and earth and he hasn't changed he would allow us to come to a place where we can even come into the knowledge of him and he would call us for a fellowship to come and sit around the table he will open to us the mysteries of the seven seals and the future homes and the serpent seas and all this thing so we can come into a fellowship like we've never known before but madame said i used to think god was against me that he hated me he was mad at me uh he was against it and and oftentimes that's the picture we get that's a picture that's a a mind you know that's why the scripture says that the the the faith is the substance of things not seen even as our pastor was preaching in other words we with the the evidence of faith is not found within our five senses if you get to a place where you can touch it you can explain it you can understand it it's no longer by faith it's no longer by phrase then it becomes by your mind it becomes by the senses but faith is the evidence of not seeing not seen what is the evidence of things not saying you as a right sinner who walked in sin couldn't save yourself couldn't do anything good about yourself one day you heard about the gospel you had faith dropped within your heart and through that faith god comes and he deposits something within your heart the holy spirit start quickens the seed that was inside of you and causes you to live a life that's clean compared to what you were living before what did that faith came to action the evidence is not found you you you couldn't it's like a pig in the in in a pigpen trying to clean himself with the water around him the evidence of it is not within the things of the world the earth cannot provide it science cannot provide it the things around cannot provide what can provide it is if you tap into this defined god by faith he drops it down and he makes it a reality within your life he says and jesus asked a question let me skip this it says this in unchanging god it says therefore if god's attitude towards one sinner and towards one sinner and wanted to repent and adam and eve and god made a way for them to repent and forgive them and forgive them that sinner and then he says and the next sinner comes god has got to do the same thing to that sinner it says oh or he did wrong when he acted the first for the first sinner it says and if a man was sick and god healed one man then is then if he ever if if ever another comes to god he's got to do the same thing he says he or he did wrong when he healed the first one if he comes he says if he comes on the same ground it says what a resting place for the soul that's seeking refuge a rest for a christian to know that i have a place i have a god i have a place where i can put all that i am in and i know that i'll get the same result every time to know that there's a person there's a god who died for me and he gave his life for me and i can reap the benefits of it and and live a life not having to worry about that anymore knowing that he made a way and that was the perfect way he didn't make a way so he can come back and take it out he made a way so you can continue now what i'm saying says it says and then it says and then and and jesus asked a question it says when i return to the earth will i find faith it says there's got to be a church full of faith and god god send these things down to stimulate faith our faith to prove what faith is it says see what i mean those things that's the way it can operate now now i want you now to listen to what he says now he he he he's discerning on the prayer line he speaks now he talks and he says he speaks in in the tape there's a black spot he says it says please at blank spots it says it says uh very highly elated when it says when when they give their prayer card when they got the prayer when they gave the prayer card you know the first the first night here he says you are really happy wasn't you it's talking uh he says know that that's right sister it's hap is it it is happening come on up on this time it says now but yet being my neighbor you know those things that are godly that are godly that are godly the truth is that right he says that's right it says if you'll do this if you will solemnly believe now which which which you know i'm telling you the truth all right now if you believe you if you believe that i tell you the truth what i tell you to be the truth and act upon the same it's going to leave you and never return again if you believe that what i tell you is the truth and you go act upon it it's going to leave you and never return again and listen to what it says and this just warmed my heart when i read it this afternoon and it says do you believe that it says i want you to be the happiest person in texas while you are here god inspired attitude that's a faith inspired attitude i want you to be the happiest person in texas while you are here and i said i claim that i want to claim now a christian is not meant to be this uh a sad face person where your attitude towards is up tomorrow it's down today it seems like you are making it tomorrow it seems like your life is falling apart oh but god take me lift me up to such a place where because of the word that you have told me now i want you to realize here this is the prophet speaking to this woman uh based upon what she had heard in other words we could see as it comes in a prayer line but what i'm going to say well you know you you have this and you have this will detect whatever this is he has and he says well if you believe what he just told you then go on it says you be the happiest person in texas and and he tells her it tells her that i want to say this the word of god did the same thing with you it came and it detected your sin it detected your weakness it detected your down part it told you everything about who you were and he didn't just stop there now he came and he says that you are not what you are supposed to be now that before the foundation god made you to be his son or his daughter and move forward to that display destination oh i tell you i want to send you tonight and say i'm moving in that direction with happiness what are we supposed to be down about he's giving us eternal life he told us we'll inherit the world it will never inherit everything he's given us food to eat it's giving us a place to sleep he's giving us a place to worship him he's giving us brothers and sisters that we can come and gather together with what have we said of hell you say well this is just a prayer line now listen to what it says i want you to be the happiest person in texas while you are here and when you get to indiana be the next happiest person because i'll be back right there oh i tell you i tell you we got to be competing in happiness not in sadness we got and i'm not talking about competition in the sense of the natural i'm talking about being one that's positive all the time i'm not talking about just a a a show-off or a put-on or something but one that realizes that i'm here because god blessed me here and his word identified who i am his word told me that i was a sinner it was word talked about how i was to come in this world but the same word told me that even though i came in the way that i came but that was not my beginning my beginning was in his mind we have to believe something we have to walk by something and i believe that oftentimes we walk by our minds by the tormenting by the things that the devil is approaching us and yet we are not realizing it what we are well whatever says he he comes to me and he he says oh you have no frames and nobody loves you and and he comes and he tries to bring me down he says i remembers it and then he says and when when when those things come and god comes on the scene i point back to him and says tell me what this is now tell me who this is now you know he'll come and put sickness upon you and put all kinds of things and try to show you that you're not what you were supposed to be and all those things that oh look at you you fall again and everything oh next time remind him he says when you're standing on the mountain top reminding him he said how did i get here there's a god who blessed me here there's a god who died for my sin i'm here just reaping the benefits of what was offered at calvary i'm here walking in the revelation of what our messenger gave us sorry i i think i forgot my phone it was in my pocket let me just silence every minute but one of them says we have the devil's answer and the devil's answer is the manifestation of the word it's you the devil's answer is not it's not a dead letter because the dead letter has been courted by all the churches it's been courted everywhere and the devil looks at it in fact he goes and he sits around but there has to be a group of people which are the manifestation of the letter they are moved by the spirit that wrote the letter and when they come into manifestation those are the ones that the devil is afraid of my brother how faith has to inspire an attitude an attitude that looks at the devil and say i have been i'm the weapon that's been made to defeat you i am the weapon how come you the weapon i am the word of god that says that there will be a bride in the last age i am the word of god that says that the manifestation of jesus christ will be in his bright body i am the manifestation of it says that we shall come anywhere that will put the devil under our feet that the seed of abraham will be manifested in the end time not the jews but a group of people which are part of the royal seed by the same faith that abraham has that will come and walk upon the face of the earth i tell you that's what i desire most if we fail to obtain to our inheritance then we are no different we're just another group of of of of gathering and well you know we might as well call ourselves a different name [Music] but there's a manifestation of this hour that's groaning within the hearts of the believer and they can taste it they've come close to it god is as well the chief wave in front of them they've seen it and nothing is going to stop them because they desire that more than anything the world can offer so when you get back to indiana be the next happiest person because i'm coming back right there i want to say let's not be driven the scripture says let this mind be in you that was also in christ who taught it not robbery to be equal with god now we know but when i made the statement on hundreds of times it says the right mental attitude to the divine promise will bring forth the good and i'm paraphrasing it and i want to ask you tonight what was jesus mental attitude what was his attitude the scripture says but says in perfect faith that he believed everything that the word said about him he believed everything that the word said about him we're going to go in the rapture i believe it how is it going to happen i don't understand but i understand that it's okay for me not to understand and i think it's not often time we focus on the big things but we are tripped by this things every day because the scripture says you shall be the salt of the earth and it says that that that the world will look upon us then they will thirst but how are they going to thirst if all i have is this bad attitude if i complain like everybody else and once bad attitude is there it doesn't come along it brings its cousin bad atmosphere and once bad atmosphere is there then things start to go wrong it's a chain they're connected you know i was going to print it out but i think we've heard it many times where it talks about the story about brother brian i'm washing dishes where just the atmosphere in the home seemed to not have been riding and everything in and you know he could have called everybody and say let's get on our knees and let's pray let's cast out all the devil that are tormenting you he could have but he stepped in and he began to just do the little things and he began to just to spread his own atmosphere he begins to just set up the right attitude and all of the sudden it was all contagious we we we sometimes are brought into despair we are brought into a place where we we become this this this price within our own self and and we just feel like the heaven is shut down and and and it seems like i've been trying and it seems like nothing is working i'd say perhaps we've been trying the wrong way perhaps we've been not identifying just how to take control of the situation says that faith is the master of circumstances now and i want to say this having said that that means to me that circumstances are always going to change how many here have been in circumstances where you thought i think this is the end of me i think i'm not going to live to pat to i'm not going to live to see tomorrow i think you know this is it i think god is done i think i i've done this is the last i'm not going to see tomorrow this is it and everything you're here you're here how did you survive that it's not in the jurisdiction of your thinking to predict what's going to come tomorrow it's not in the jurisdiction of what what's going on around you to determine what tomorrow is going to be why determining tomorrow is what the word says tomorrow is going to come that's why parvati says jesus he believed everything he believed everything that the word said about him and in believing everything that the word was said about him he had the confidence to walk in and act according to it but the things that stop us the most part says it's the heart condemnation we get to a place where we did it here we we did wrong here we did wrong here then when we stand we don't have confidence in god but i believe we can walk in the path where we can stay away from the things of the world and the god who's the master of all things will come and take the condemnation away you know i i always find it amazing it's always the last mistake you make is the biggest that's right you know you'll come and and you you make a mistake and and and the one that you've been thinking about being the biggest is no longer the biggest the satan comes and says oh there you are again i told you you were a failure i told you this i told you this if you follow that direction where are you going to end up he says but um says now all right it says now this is the angel of god that sends from from jesus christ to testify of the church in the last day in the last days are here it says it doesn't he he doesn't heal anybody but it will help bring your faith up to that place to a place and then he says and when you are seeing a person standing here on the platform to you all there and it says how can how many here is to be prayed for for the meeting it says for the meeting meeting closes it says let's see your hands it says i know there's a lot there's a lot over 50 here i see the prayer card around the holding and everything it says now notice when god is doing something here on the platform his attitude towards you out there also it says it's his attitude towards you out there also you believe that and while he's being done here on the platform remember if you believe with all your heart no doubt in your heart i will assure you god will put it right out and call you call you who are out there and raise you up from the building that's right now i i and this just hit my mind perhaps in a way that he never before i want to say this that's why it's so important even when we listen to those prayer lines it's you that is talking to it's you that is praying for it's all you have to do is take that person substitute yourself on that person where it is put whoever you want in that place and the results are bound to be the same this is not just us recording an event and people shouting and screaming and we can hear it and say oh i wish i was there i wish i could have been there oh god is not bound by time it's not bound by space his word is eternal so therefore when that is being performed you might as well put yourself there and say i receive it [Applause] that's the area but i'm saying it says faith knows no defeat you can't defeat faith because defeating faith is defeating god it says faith it's got muscles and a hairy chest in other words when face stands up nothing can speak amen when when one has already heard from god and he's standing there there's nothing that can move him but here we are moved and toast about in and and today we think we got our healing tomorrow we think we lost it you know today we think we delivered and tomorrow oh i i think it's back again i i think i need to go back for prayer and everything it says if you had perfect faith you wouldn't even come to the prayer line but how do we get from where we are to obtaining it and i say this it's to have the same disposition the same attitude and the same coming forth like jesus did because remember it's his attitude towards the word that produced everything because he came and he had a certain disposition a certain understanding that his life was given to him for a purpose and that he was bound to fulfill the purpose for which his life was given and he knew that god will not take his life unless he fulfilled the purpose for which he came and he knew that he would not be taken out of the earth that's why he could sleep when the winds were tossing just imagine that and his disciple came and says master cannot that we die if you die where do i go won't we die together i think the devil has got a mind and i know the battle is in our mind but i believe the word of god is a weapon but madam says that the word of god will defeat the devil any place any time under any circumstance when you take that word you put it within your heart with faith you are bound to achieve everything that god wants you to achieve so he says he says he speaks about the farmers it says now what does the farmer do he sows wheat well look at the harvest the next morning what if he goes out there and uncover it and says why aren't you sprout sprouted there's nothing to it i ain't gonna have no wheat well he isn't he says then he's not going he's not going to have wheat if he keeps on digging it up looking at it he will never have wheat you just saw it and let it alone and i think that's where our struggle is let it alone leave it alone leave it alone you've committed in god's hands leave it alone you've given it to god leave it alone you've done all that you could you do the man part and let god do the god part give it to god believe the word i i'll i'll tell you thinking about when i'm talking about how that he was sick to his time he was sick and they told him that if he continued to eat beans he's gonna die he went and he believed that he was healed and he continued to eat it and he's about to die and then i asked myself a question do i have the same attitude am i displaying that same attitude am i everywhere in my dealings in my things every day when i walk up in the morning am i displaying that same attitude or am i the attitude that i got to go dig it up let me go check perhaps it didn't stick i need to try again we torment it within our minds and we go dig it up something happen we go dig it up we go dig it up we're going to do he says leave it alone he says there it is it's up to god to bring it forth it's up to god to send the reign it's you that accept teach you that except on the on god's on it's you that accept god on his word hallelujah it's up to god to bring forth his word to pass you accept the word god brings the word to path it says no man is worth anything any a no man is worth more any more than his word and god is not worth a bit more than his word is and i say this with a challenge in faith that every promise of god will bring forth to pass if you take it in the right mental attitude that's right look at it and believe it i want to say this let's have that right man of attitude the scripture has gotten promised for our age and things that not just for our age even our personal life that we need to see we are called to be overcomers of this generation we are called to overcome the world that's around us we are influenced by the world but we need to overcome it we are called to overcome and to bring forth the manifestation of the bride of this hour we are called to overcome individually sin within our lives and unbelief and the things that torment us we are called to take all of that and to bring it under subjection we are called to come and preach this gospel to the sinners and how are we going to do that if we continually dwell in this kind of mindset the scripture says god is not a man that he should lie it's not a son of man that he can come and change his mind when he speaks his word in fact you find it in the world most time you know people will say good things about you and and think you're the best worker and all the things and everything you make one mistake and find out what you are they'll talk and talk your praises today and tomorrow and tomorrow you become nothing that's what the world is suffering oh you look at it it's just this one there's no perfect person the person rises my goodness they go dig up every wrong that he's ever done that's the world but with god it's not so in fact says if he takes it and he puts it in the sea of god forgetfulness it's no more to be remembered it's done as far as is concerned and if a man god digs it up it's up between him and god as far as god is concerned is done i tell you i want to work for this kind of god i want to give my life for this kind of god one who can come and even when i can make wrong even when i can fall who can come and look at me and say son you don't have to worry about it it was never about you to begin with it's about the work that i'm trying to achieve i'm just using you as a vessel i'm just using your mouthpiece and you feel like you have allowed me to speak therefore i'll speak to you that's what we are called to be mouthpieces and nothing more the power is god's power the healing is god's healing they're doing it god's doing oh i tell you if we can just do a better job speaking and doing the things that he wants us to do he will fulfill his word because it's his promise so i say to you that the scripture says let this mind that was in christ be also in you that he taught it not robbery to be equal with god my brother my sister we have been in this generation called to be equal with god we have been called to be god's bride in the image of god in the world like he was in the same property that he was have the same attribute like he did we have not been called to be any lower and if we can only accept that if we can only walk in that if you can let that dominate your mind take over your mind fill up your mind if you can let that consume you every bit if you can let that becomes the most desirable things that you want if you can let that become your goal he will take you there the thing is we have so many other goals we want to do this we want to do this we want to achieve this we want to achieve this but oh i want to have a single goal and my goal is to be what you call me to be my goal is to be the happiest christian in texas my goal is to be what you've called me to be my goal is to have a faith attitude an attitude that shows what god has done i tell you this faith inspires expectation it's my faith speaks about that woman oh mommy we're running just a thought it's not going to be too long if the musician could come oh she came and the gentile woman barbara says she never seen a miracle done before never she came and jesus looked at it and said you don't give the children bread to dogs do you the meats that's reserved to children the food that's reserved for children we don't give it to dogs do we she said you're right but even dogs it's from the crumb i tell you my brother my sister her eyes was on the price she knew what she was looking for and nothing could stop her she knew what she was there for and there was no bad attitude there was no nothing that was going to come within her way she knew who he was and there was nothing that was going to stop her receive what she wanted god i'll tell you this we have known who god is in this generation we have seen him with our eyes i'm not talking about the man but i'm talking about the god who was in the man god is known by his characteristics his characteristics have been made known to us in this ice age we have seen him and i can say with john what our hands has touched our eyes have seen you said well you didn't touch the prophet yes i didn't touch the prophet but i've touched god by touching you i've touched god by touching my brother my sister well our eyes have seen our eyes have behold the glory of the living god what glory he's taken a bunch of sinners and he's washed them clean and he's giving them his power within them so they can sit and glorify him my brother my sister when you look you're looking at god concerning eternal life what else are we going to talk about eternal life if we're not going to talk about the people around you you know we're not i think you know people want oh you know i'll tell you about moses i wasn't there when moses was there i'll tell you about jacob it's just the story i read but oh if i can talk about one that i've seen here that came it was a sinner and god changed his life and made him whole if i could talk about myself and where he took me and what he has made me that's the testimony of jesus christ don't just stop and say i'll read the bible you are the written bible manifested tonight you are here as an epistle the scripture says to manifest the glory of god we have seen god in this generation and i say this let's not stop short of our commission in the end time let's move forward with it wherever it takes us let us go why because i have seen god and i have to tell somebody that's why people run into all kinds of confusion with this message all they've seen is just the red stories and the red message books about what god did and everything and never seen one for themselves how can a man see a miracle perform god come down and do something and then look at that same god that same messenger and say this is of the devil a man will send sin and say if god doesn't come behind this don't believe it if he doesn't come and prove what i just preached don't believe it if he just doesn't come and stand behind what i just said don't believe it who has ever said that let's not forget what's been made available to us let's not just take this for granted but let the love of jesus christ abound within your heart let some fire be uh flamed up within your bones and say god i have seen you and i believe you i have touched you for myself i have i've come in contact with you my life is what it is today because i came in contact with you therefore i'm standing here i'm gonna have the right mental attitude i'm gonna speak my expectation i'm gonna walk by expectation why the same god who done before is here to do the same i'm here whatever i have not seen yet i'm here believing that god is gonna bring it to pass why because he's made himself available to me he's opened my eyes that i can see what a grace let's all stand today he says this always remember always remember church it says god's words are true i believe the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring you the past if you can look at it in the right way but remember he's been it's been my standard in life i try to do this the first thing i want the first thing i find out is whenever whenever it's the will of god or not then i know it's god's will the next thing is my objective towards it my motive and objective in doing it then if it's god's will if it's a will of god and my mother my motive my objective is right my motive is right i have faith that it's it that it will be done because firth it's the will of god my objective is to glorify him my motive is is to give him all the glory it's not a selfish motive about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work if the objective is to make to make money for yourself or something why it will not it will need it it will it will never succeed and then you will try to do something outside of his will outside of the will of the lord then it will work it won't work in the big to begin with so there it says so there is a genuine faith it says but you must come in the real channel of god to have that genuine faith there is a human faith there's faith of god and you must have a godly faith to believe now then have a godly faith you must have the mind of christ in you then that's how god is projected to you visions revelation i want you to catch that it's the word of god it's the will of god it's the mind of god i have the right motive i have the right objective then from then god is projected through you that's when how visions came why because everything is lined up it's projected through you it says then they says then god that's how that's how god projects he projects to you visions and revelation visions revelation all these things come by the mind of christ being in you you get it let the mind of christ be in you let's just bow our heads our gracious father lord you know others higher lord on this wednesday night service perhaps one of the difficult ones because father people come from work and their minds

of god and i love how he closed the service that here's a people with a faith-inspired attitude towards the word of god that he's revealed in the end time and you're the very manifestation of it you
