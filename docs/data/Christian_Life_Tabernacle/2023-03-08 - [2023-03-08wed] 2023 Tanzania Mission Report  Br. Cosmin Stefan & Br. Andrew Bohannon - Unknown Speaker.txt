number five eleven oh I like the old songbook someone might ask me Brother David is that because you're old yes Benjamin one day came to me and he looked me in the eye and that's very serious and he said Brother David are you old and he wanted to know if I was the definition of old and I'm the definition of getting younger day by day I've got every I haven't lost the hair I haven't lost an inch and death has no hold on me it's got no sting but amen let's listen because I think this is what we're all here for on Jordan stormy Banks I stand and cast The Wishful eye I am Bound for the promised land how many is Bound for the promised land amen so we can't let the old uh uh liar try to tell us there's something better here there's nothing because nothing's satisfying you know all the blessings of the Lord and all the spiritual move of the spirit is just a foretaste of Gloria divine just just enough to to to be salty that you want more if you want more I don't know how anybody wants anything of the world anymore it's it's just gone ballistic you know what I mean but keep the love of God in your heart forgive one another you know we we all we all make mistakes we all have failures we all have a flesh that Wars against the spirit and and you know Satan just waits till you're a little weary and you're a little down and and he gets you out of sorts and he punches and he's got a Punch coming you know what I mean but but don't get discouraged amen he saw you long time ago while you were yet a sinner he died for you I like that part I didn't I didn't get good and then he said this guy's good enough for me to die for it he looked at me and he said this poor miserable wretch he says if I don't die for him he don't have a chance all right amen so he died for me you know and I I thought well I've just got sins he can't forgive there's nothing more powerful in his blood amen so okay that's why we just we just set our heart here and and we look and and tonight we're all standing on that stormy Bank just across the river we've got a place amen on Jordan stormy thanks I stand [Music] again [Music] oh yes sir [Music] amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] never go with me boys [Music] [Music] descendants [Applause] [Music] land before the promise [Music] [Music] me forever be my father's face stand against [Music] amen amen amen at this time we'd like to invite cosmen and the and uh he can be seated really like cosmen and uh Andrew to come out so here they come Mrs Cosman this is Andrew amen and we're happy they made it back safely from uh in Africa on their trip you know the word of God says that one planet one water it and but it's God that gives the increase amen and to have our brothers to have a Zeal on their heart to go overseas and water the seed of God with the word of God and help them grow I I just think that's wonderful so what we're going to do tonight they're going to tell us about their trip and and the how the Lord worked I think we can sing a special no because we're good musicians so much tonight and I have I think they have some presentation and stuff so just remember they're people all over the world just like you same blood purchased them same devil fights them they're hungering for the same word and the church all over the world is built on the same thing Revelation and faith is our foundation and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and without faith it's impossible to please God every time the word of God is preached or shared it gives you an opportunity to believe to say Amen in the say I believe and it builds your faith so even when you're down in the dumps read your Bible listen to the word of God come hear the word of God because that that little seed inside of you when it hears the word of God it'll say I believe that amen and you'll just feel that Faith start rising up in you so I don't know what the brothers have planned for us I know that I'm gonna go down here so I can sit back and watch so Brothers we put the service in your hands to see me Andrew you gonna start first okay this is Andrew he's the tallest he goes first and are you coming to his husband after this is God all right Lord bless you both enjoy your matches praise the Lord aren't you thankful for a Godly Pastor they can still do the the song leading and you know what a real example what a real example of what it's like to be a servant and you know I'm just really thankful that we can come together tonight and have a little Fellowship you know it's a very unique service in that for one our pastor's song leading and for two we're going to give a report we're really excited what God has done but if we just take a moment maybe we can all stand and if we can offer a word of prayer we'll read a scripture and we'll trust the Lord will have his way in the service I know that you've come expecting and you've come believing and we just want to you know put the thought to the side that this is just another service there's something special that the Lord has in store for each one of us so as we read the word of God pull life right out of the word for the season of life that you're in because God has something very special for each and every one of us and every time God gives Revelation it's because there's something right around the corner that we need to overcome and it's by the word and faith in the word that we can overcome every obstacle that the devil puts in front of us amen so let's just if you have a special need and there's an atmosphere here that you believe that if you can just Touch the Hem of His Garment that he would meet your need and you just hold that in your heart and watch how he'll come and he'll he'll give you your heart's desire let's pray together our precious Lord how we thank you God for your presence Lord we thank you for your promise Lord that Lord when we've looked to the Unseen Lord that you're there Lord and by faith in the word Lord we can draw dividends from your promises Heavenly Father Lord we're looking right now to the death of your innocent son and what it meant Oh God it it loosed us from the bondage of sin Lord how we love you Lord our hearts go out to you in this service Lord father we need you Lord we need Revelation Lord so we call upon the name that's above every name that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father do for us what we cannot do for ourselves will you open the word of God to every heart here that's Longing For Truth Lord wants to see you o God lift it up once again out of History Lord and is a present tense to meet them at their point of need father we're thankful Lord that you've brought many that were sick oh God on beds that were ill and and not feeling well and they're in the house of God to rejoice and to thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord thank you for your healing virtue father how we love you Lord the few words that we would say Lord may bring you glory and honor father will will our hearts be lifted up as we unite together in this great hour what you've done in this day and what you're doing now in this time in this local body Lord we just want to give you praise in honor Lord and may each heart hear Lord when we leave Lord may they have touched you and received from you something of an eternal value that would help them along the life's way in Jesus Christ's name amen so I just wanted to read in John chapter 17 something that the Lord put on my heart and as our pastor was ministering this Sunday morning and something the Lord definitely impressed upon my heart I feel like if we just go right to chapter 17 and verse 17 it says this and will try not to labor too much but we do have something on our heart and we just we'll just lay something here and if we have time something after the the presentation of our mission trip maybe we can share a few things maybe a few minutes of what the Lord's laid on our heart but we just figured if we can open the word of God and God could speak through his word amen so it says here sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth amen you may have your seeds you know it it was a a accumulation of time for me personally I I um just in December we went to Romania I hadn't been on a trip a mission trip for six years I went to Honduras in 2017 and the Lord was so gracious and um when uh brother Elias who's the pastor that extended the invitation to come to Africa I met him in 2017 in a men's retreat in Newport and it was the first time that he came to America and he traveled through here he ministered one day here and really was blessed by him Ministry and I even remember what he preached it was so profound to me but he just has a real Meek humble Spirit really loves the Lord and so we had lunch together and he told me he said you know brother you know it's different in Africa you should come sometime and you know I held that in my heart and I prayed about it and he he would reach out to me and say come brother come and he stayed with me this this has been six years in the making and so I just um you know in in September you know I felt like you know God has done so much for me and I finally just told my wife I said honey and this was in September I said look I just feel like I'm just not doing what the Lord's telling me and you might feel the same way but this is the way God deals with his sons and daughters you know you you make a vow in your heart you say you know I'm just going to do it and so just like our pastor read about those two sons one said he would do it and didn't and then the other said he wouldn't do it but then he ended up doing it so I felt like that was fitted and it was it was the way that the Lord had dealt with my heart and so whenever this opportunity came up I had a battle because around this time brother Cosman had asked me to pray about something and and so he didn't know what I'm sharing with you at the time I told him later but he didn't know that I had already had a burden but I just I had made every excuse in the book okay so by the time brother cosman's asking me I didn't have any more excuses and so it was now up to me and so you know how sometimes we say if if I'm going to do something if it's it would be worth it if one Soul if would be transformed and I really in my heart I felt so compelled that even if one Soul wasn't affected I'm doing the will of the Lord and so I think I think it's a time where we just we want to fulfill our calling every one of us have a Ministry everyone has a calling everybody has a fulfillment and so I'm just falling on the sword tonight letting you know that I was being dilatory about my duty but I feel like it's a time where we must wait on our ministry every single one of us there's a character that God's developing in each one of us to be able to take the word of God and let it deal with this world first and then you can go out into the world because it's no longer you that liveth but it's Christ in you amen so as we accepted brother cosman's called to pray about it and then when he began to share it with me the picture became real clear that now you know it's not time to be a coward it's time to be brave and to stand up for what I believe and I never experienced what what I was going to come into but there's this theme that I feel like I'm entering into I'm coming into a lot of first I've never been here before and I feel like I can identify with Abraham God was calling him to a land that he had never been this is a land of Faith so every day every step of the way we must be willing to venture out on the promises and Watch God's hand work in our lives so this was just another extension for me and so I'm really grateful that we can share a few things that the Lord put on our heart and so we definitely want to bring you greetings from Brother Elias and I found in brother Elias that he's been laboring and he's very missionary minded so he's been laboring Mo you know they don't deal with things like things in America where there's a lot of pollution with with um you know the things that we have a lot of what they have it seems like there's a lot of tribal um influences and culture and so there's a lot of things that are still needing to be dealt with in the word of God but they're very different and so as brother Elias has gone out he's made contact with different people and different churches has rose up and gone out and so from these we're going to share with you a few places that we visited we visited four different places and so these are offshoots of people that have wit that he's witnessed to and then they become pastors and they go out into the bush they go out into the where they have to take boats and run out and all kinds of stuff so these churches that we visited are actually they're the fruit of this message and so they're they're hungry for the truth they receive the truth they do the same thing that we do and when Revelation strikes us so maybe I'll give this opportunity for brother Cosman I can't do this stuff very well but he's very good at it so I'll turn it over to our brother Cosman and let him kind of share from his heart a few things and then uh we'll just run it that way come brother Cosman foreign he takes care of our needs he knows how to lead us he knows how to guide us and um I'm not going to be very long you know when we try to give a testimony you know sometimes if you go into every detail things could take quite long so we're just gonna just say a few things but you know um this is a testimony service and the word the word of God is a testimony it's um it's a testimony for a Believer when he sees the word come to pass because otherwise it's insane and when you're convinced of the life of the word then you become concerned about others because that's what the Life of Christ is it wants to share the very thing that it has it wants to it wants to pour out the very life that now we received he wants to give it out and there has to be somebody that would receive it otherwise you wouldn't have it so if you have it now it's needed to be sewn to somebody else because it's needed God's still calling and so I um I you know I just kind of had this in my mind you know a test that God puts before you in the word of God plus a ceremony is a testimony you know because now God puts a test for you and then there's a ceremony there's a victory at the end of that and that becomes Living Word now and you know being led of the Holy Spirit and walk into the into the footsteps of the word is what we're called to do we're called to let go of our own flesh we're called to let go of our ideas our thoughts our accomplishments all that this flesh wants to do but to concentrate on one thing that's Eternal and that's fulfilling the very word that was sent for us to fulfill and if we're busy and carried away into the things that may be take away our concentration on what the image should be then you'll throw a test and then you know he he he works his kids out his children out for his good I'm just going to read a quote and and a little quote because I want to make sure I say this if it's not for the word of God we wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for the message of the hour we wouldn't even be able to come up and say anything before the people because it's not what we can come up with it's not an idea or a revelation that I could come up with but the very word that came came to take flesh and not only to be preached but to be lived the word of God has to be lived John 16 says I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot hear them now verse 13 it says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you the word of God coming as a guide to show us the truth and I believe that we all know the message of the hour and what this message is and how we can go and find food in due season where it heals a womb where it provides Deliverance where it provides expectation where he could speak to us brother Branham says this and 1962 a guide he says see you need the guide he will guide you to truth and Truth is the word he says he will guide you it always been it he says and it always has been that way I love it I love it because it's so simple we don't have to complicate it we don't have to come with our own way of saying well this is the way it should be you know sometimes we can force ourselves into scripture and and and it cannot be the will of the Lord but it has to be revealed that has to be in due time it has to do in due season and if we're not sensitive enough to recognize him by his word and how he is revealing himself then we're missing the very steps of how what he wants what he wants us to walk into it says God don't ever change nothing because he's infinite and he knows what's best his omnipresent his omniscient he's everything it's right God is so he don't have to change he says he is a confirmer of the way he's leading the Holy Ghost will guide the guide is the confirmer of the same word that he's teaching so now that he's teaching he actually come comes back and confirms the very reward that he's teaching you if it doesn't take flesh it'll remain as a Doctrine every word has to take flesh I love it because this is the prophet's words this is the word that was came that came for for us for for his sons and his daughters it says now Luke was led by the guide it says to say go he into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth now shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues take up serpents that drink deadly things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and the Bible said that they went forth everywhere led by the guide you know preached the word with signs following what was it the guide vindicating that was the truth so the essence wasn't the signs and the Wonders that came following because of his presence of the word but it was the word that came that changed or that could change an individual and so I met brother Eliason 2017 myself and he's he's become a really good friend of mine over the years we've just been communicating I I can relate to brother Elias a little bit because the way that you know maybe Africa is it was the way that I grew up when I was a little child and so I know sometimes the hardness of you know life and not having and the things that maybe take place in a country like that and so I always was there for him in in a word of encouragement if you need anything not financially at all but just as a friend because you know sometimes it's good to have friends where we can sharpen one another they were we're brothers we know we believe the same word it produces the same fruit you know we're we're brothers it doesn't have to be just here we're you know this is a worldwide bride oh and so brother Elias has asked me for the past maybe a year and a half to just kind of think about going and you know the word at that time was dealing with my life in a different direction and so you know that's where we were going and so you know he asked me again I would say three four months ago and I told him I would pray about it and it was a it was a really tough time for me because I was busy with work and then at the same time my grandmother had passed away and so I just come back you know there was a lot of things that were transitioning in my life and so I had to sit back and just be patient and wait upon the Lord I'm like Lord I could make a wrong choice and and so um you know I I've just I told him I said I would pray about it well I didn't answer within a weekend so he wrote me a message and it says brother Cosman he said if you'd help I can ask my my church to fast and pray for you and I'm like oh okay um I said okay and so he said okay so he had the church fast and pray for her I would say a few days and he's like okay we'll have you decided anything and I told him I said you know brother lies I'll commit myself to come and um I told them one thing as we were on the phone you know Saints it's always good to have expectation because expectation brings the word to be manifested in its proper time or season and and so I told Brother Elias has like it's like brother brother Elias you know I it was a really hard decision for me but I said I said I'm under great expectation because I know the devil was trying to fight something and and so he was encouraged and so at that at that time I I had related to my brother Adrian that I was I was going to go and so he comp he was compelled himself to join with us too and so at that point it was just me and him going together just knowing that brother Alaska was going to take us and so and then brother Andrew just ended up coming towards the end whenever time got closer to the date but you know everything that we do is with the desire of the word to be fulfilled if there's no fruit coming out of the very life that we live then then it's dead you know it it starts losing its value it starts losing its beauty it does it starts losing the very essence the very existence of what it is a tree cannot look and it's perfect will or it's perfect Beauty unless it's fully grown It's gotta It's gotta have its fruit and so you know I I've I've had that desire for my life I was like Lord you know I want to walk in your will I want to be in your word I want to make sure that I follow the footsteps of your word and so whatever Direction You Lead Me I'll Follow and so I know that if I do that safer because I will make a wrong choice and so um now that we're traveling 28 hours yeah I text this picture to some of the brothers and Brother David as we were just Landing this was 30 minutes away from Landing and that cloud was from my window me and Andrew were sitting right behind each other and that was a cloud and he was right above tanzania's right above Kilimanjaro where we were arriving and um this is just a picture but I actually took a video it's a cloud within itself and there's lightning just going up and down the way you see it it was for a good 10 minutes and it was constant you know I took a earlier picture where you could almost you can almost see a face to it but I don't know I'm a spiritual guy so I'm like Lord you're doing something great now I have even greater expectation that you're moving why why can't we do that Saints why can't we have expectation to know that we could even see God and his own creation leading his sons and his daughters I got I got comforted by that and so as we were just um Landing down brother Elias ended up just receiving Us in really nicely he had a brother out there at the airport and the process in Tanzania is really hard because you have to get a Visa and all of these things and so he had a brother that was working at the airport and so he bypassed a few things and we ended up leaving a lot faster because the lines were really long and so he really saved us there um so once we arrived we ended up checking into a a room and then so the next day this was Tuesday we arrived I think we were traveling for a little bit and then we arrived Tuesday evening and then Wednesday we had two Services already scheduled so we had 10 services in eight days we had two on Wednesday two on Thursday Two on Friday one on Saturday two on Sunday and then one on Tuesday and so we arrived there Tuesday night really tired and then now we're we're arriving at our first church and this is about 40 kilometers away from Arusha most of you guys may know Tanzania I know some of the people from Africa that you guys know where that's at but this is in a town called Le guruki Tanzania Le guruki it's about 40 kilometers away from the main town it's a small little church the pastor of this church his name is Malachi and uh brother Andrew was saying about when you're convinced and the word comes in your life now you start being concerned and so because the very life that now brother Malachi had received he started being concerned about other lives and brother Elias was showing us a few pictures about how he takes a canoe across Rivers into the jungle with his motorcycle and they canoe his bicycle his motorcycle to the other side of the Jungle and then from there he takes a bike and he goes into the jungle and he's talking to people that has never heard about God doesn't even know who God is doesn't even know what the Bible is doesn't know how to read the Bible doesn't know the stories of the Bible so he sits there on a tree log but their alas was telling us and he starts from from from the basis he says okay this is what God is this is this is what happened here in the Redemption here's what happened so he's walking them with the message of the hour and the Bible together and they're just loving it their their life is changed um and so this is Brother Malachi's church here where he's pastoring and um if I can say something you know one thing that I noticed when we were there it's very different than it is here everybody walks everywhere I'm serious you're driving down the highway and there's tons of people just walking and they have these motorbikes and these they look like golf carts with three wheels they're everywhere and it's not like if you have like a car with four-wheel drive or something that's kind of rare you you obviously have wealth and so the thing about when we were going to this church like once we got off the main road and we turned it's a dirt road and it's bumpy and there's there there's Shepherds driving cattle over the road and this road is like and so as we were going I mean what what's interesting about this church it always hasn't been like this they used to get dropped off at a bus and they would walk seven hours to get to this church this has been a labor of love for years and so these people they now that they've come to this they can really appreciate what was to now what is and so they don't take for granted what they have you can tell that the people they really sacrifice and they really want something from God and so this pastor here is just giving his all and not only is he shepherding he's he you know he helps with the the brothers to teach them and they also go out so not only is is brother Malachi going out and trying to establish like they don't even know this is the word of God so he has to teach them very basic things like this is God's word this is his promise to learn how to reverence it they don't even understand these people are in the bush they can't read and so he has to take time tediously going through laboring laboring laboring start at the very Basics and yet they have to stay there in labor and so this was very profound and thought provoking for me so I just wanted to lay that in there before we moved on go ahead you're doing very good say those details to me are common so um but it's very true you know when when you're when you're living in those conditions it really takes the love of God to be able to just long for The Fellowship of the word and so you can see the labor of love and and brother Malachi's Ministry and so this is the congregation that they have there you know there is and this and this picture here that we have just down the street there's a Maasai Church which is a I believe it was kind of a Pentecostal Maasai church and so brother Malachi I just felt the love and invited them to come in through and sat in the services that we had here on Wednesday so this was a picture of the congregation this is all of them here together in front of the building that's brother Malachi he's he's the pastor there that's brother Andrew so forget about that guy but then um brother Malachi actually um his father was a tribal leader and so he had multiple wives this is the thing that the word of God does for them that's a little bit different than what we would probably be accustomed to so the Lord really dealt with him and then from him like his brother has now come out and is serving the lord under the the message of the hour and then also I believe there's like 27 people from his family that her the father had three wives and just a branch of uh you know if you have cattle you have wives there it's just different and so it's really amazing how God this message even can take the Clutter of our Humanity all of the the deception all of the confusion and it pulls people out it calls them out of the man's thinking it calls him out of religion and it brings them to a Life of Christ and so I was really struck by his testimony because he really is humble he loves the Lord he's a true servant amen and then we got fed we ate it all we ate it all just the beginning they had meetings this was meetings for them so um I don't ever turn down food and so we we ate and we ate really good you know the people of Tanzania really love they they the Believers there they're just so loving we we really were received with open arms and you know um if you get to know one another and you just sit there and even if you don't get to speak the same language it's it's just a love language between the way that you act with one another that shows your sons you know you believe the same message you produces the same fruit it produces the Same Love yes brother Elias is in the middle but the Malachi is to the right I want to say this also about that first service brother Cosman brother Adrian ended up speaking but there was a few people that had a real urgent need and so we were able to visit with them and the Lord really met him in a supernatural way so there was victory in the camp that picture with all of us together at the end I believe it's largely because there's people that are burdened and their faith and love is going to work in prayer even from here they were praying the Lord really moved in a special way and so in this in this little time of Fellowship just two services and we were gone but God really blessed the people and so we were encouraged our little our little Mustard Seed Faith and God really came down he moved in a way that I believe that people grabbed the word of God and they were changed and it made a difference so on the second the second church that we ended up visiting was uh uh uh go ahead brother go ahead you're doing good brother he does so much better but you can't even say his name come on try it please help me nope sorry okay so the second church was in marourani Tanzania the pastor here is Pastor Lawrence wonderful brother these were the services on Thursday but the Andrew ended up taking this one and so this was the church where we found it this location was very tough to get to roads were really tight and it was really sandy roads and and the roads really do beat you up like the way you I mean it's just tough you know you um get tired this is a video here you can see the surroundings it's just in the middle of nowhere [Music] so I just took a quick video because I was I was in another world just blown away and so I was really excited the president's Lord already was dealing with me and oh here I am getting ready the expectation I go to college they were ready for the word [Music] [Music] they really like to sing this was the congregation um and they stayed they stayed in between church services there was a church service at 10 o'clock in the morning and then I think we got out at maybe 12 31 and then the second one was around three o'clock 3 30. and so people will just so if I could say this about no that's fine so what they did is they took the church pews and they put them under a tree that was their Fellowship Hall and so I was like praise God they got a fellowship hall and it was nice under the shade you in the sun you sweating but uh it was really amazing after the first service this one dear solar name was hope and she had been teetering and the message really spoke to her because I what I spoke on is is you know why halt between two opinions and she made the decision she came forward and really said I'm I'm determined now I'm making my choice and so she was really touched by that she was the only person that came up after the service and so but but I thought it was real special she ended up with her whole countenance she was just beaming with joy and I know that the Lord really undertook for her so and this brother um he also this brother so he he he's been going out he's been one of the Troopers that are just going out into the bush and he's giving everything and anything that he can and he's in a little bit of a financial straight but the Lord really gave him a word and so he was just I mean we just couldn't let go of one another he was so happy and the Lord really really blessed him so these are the fruits of your labor as well so we're you know when one gets to Victory we all get the victory you know so we're a body and so I just want a fellowship with you what God did as we were there and so it makes so much so much of a difference they're encouraged and so uh this is the pastor here on this next slide we probably pick it up a little bit I don't want to labor too long but this is the pastor Lawrence am I saying that right yes and so and so they just really humble brother doesn't have much but really is giving is all and he also he was really uh privileged and felt privileged to have us come to his home and when we when we left after the service and he they invited us to come and have some fellowship some lunch at their home and and uh one brother his name was brother good luck and so I was like Wow praise God brother good luck I'm like this is amazing I'm home you know and so when I got out of the truck you know uh the thing is when you walk there there's not there's not a whole lot of pre-made sidewalks I seen one guy with the broom we might show the picture later but he was brooming dirt I'm like he's brooming the path that's a dirt path and he's brooming dirt and so I just you know things just don't make sense sometimes because you're just not used to it you know and so but the one brother came up to me and he had his uh towel and he's like Dusty my he's dusting my pants off and I'm like ah this is what it really means to be a servant this is what it really means to be foot washing I mean he's he's I mean at the travel and this brother he wants to he wants to take your books he wants to take your he wants to take the load off of you he's trying to you know help do something isn't that what we want to do we just want to do something for God and his people and so it really touched my heart uh that that brother good luck was and uh yeah so and then the food was amazing the mangoes and go ahead brother yeah but David warned me through a Texas at mangoes and pineapples and that's what we went for avocados and avocados and cucumbers and so the again the such a love this this was on Friday we went to namanga Pastor here's brother Jeremy and this this brother his name is Elias also and this brother lost his wife he's also a minister he's been going out and he's now pastoring another church he was under brother Jeremiah and working with him the pastor that's been pastoring at this church they've been there for five years and so brother this brother lives that I'm standing next to he also is burdened with the word and so he's gone out in areas that they've witnessed to and now he started with two or three and now it's come up to nine and so he's really given his all to help Shepherd them and to have a place where people can come out of the Bush come out of the Woodworks and and if they're really hungry for God so he's laboring for that but he did lose his wife and so I think that was about four years ago and one thing that he asked me to pray about and I'll ask you is you know that financial burden when his wife got sick he's still packing that and he's even married now with a small child and so you know I believe that just you know he's part of our body and if we can take and undergird that in prayer I believe God could undertake but these brothers he helped translate the service also in the evening for us because brother Elias was interpreting most all the services and he was just really starting to get wore out so he he helped us with the translation go ahead brother costume we're going to try to run up a little bit faster yeah that's their building there um they had dirt floors the building I think that they were in was just really just simple and this is a a video so the man walking with his son his name's Reuben and that was his second time visiting the church someone had invited him this was the second time I believe it was his first time bringing his son but I was going to minister I believe this yeah this was this was the service that I was ministering and at the end of it he came up and he gave his heart to the Lord he was very hardened and the the whatever circumstances that he was in he was broken and he had that that real dog fight like you ain't gonna stare me down I'm gonna win this but the Lord really started melting his heart and they really dealt with him and I believe that he really was changed and so um if you can go to the next you can play [Music] [Music] this is a picture of their this was after everything was done and we were all happy and rejoicing but it was hard because now it's time to say goodbye this is Brother Jeremiah and he's the pastor there like I said he'd been serving as Pastor there five years and one thing that was very pronounced to me that when we turned the service over to him he wanted to communicate something because most of the time after we turned the service they were speaking Swahili and so we didn't really understand anything they said afterwards because no one will start bringing back to English to us but he stopped and he asked the brother to come up and he said and he testified he said what was preached today saved us 40 Years of confusion so I'm just saying what he said and you know what this word this message clears the confusion if it's preached under inspiration by the Holy Ghost God changes lives he clears the confusion this message is the truth amen It cast out the darkness and so there's another young man here standing with brother Cosman and he too he he was tottering between the line but at that at this Junction of time he said you know what I'm making the decision I'm going to the water I'm taking Jesus Christ's name in water baptism I'm not ashamed he might have been writing the church views for years but at this time he had made his decision and I could really see some boldness rise up in him so this man was changed amen and then these two sisters this one sister to the right yes so the one sister to the right she's she was sick and she come and she wanted to receive healing from God and I just asked her I said are you a Christian and she said no and I said you know we can have two things that we can do for you we can pray for you as a sinner or we can pray for you that you'll get saved and you don't have to worry and she made she waited she waited she was like you know I just want healing I said you know what that's our God he's no respecter of persons if you just want God for healing if you just want him so you can dodge hell he's willing to do it he's willing to do it but this sister on the other side she's the one I believe that invited her friend and she was touched by the Lord and so I believe that her her love for her friend she's on the road amen amen so that's a wonderful testimony of what the Lord's doing when we bear one another's burden that was a lost friend she come to the service she didn't even know God had a hook for her you know Divine Healing is just a bait on the hook all right sometimes you go and get sick but we're not majoring on a minor we're saying you you must be born again right so this was a wonderful time the pastor's office was on the backside of the building and uh just really really humble just to be able to have partake of that meal was they were very gracious it was a wonderful treat and then when we yeah another thing that happened while we were here there was he said the tribe but these kind of the the the the the kind of uh people that that they come in contact with are the people that actually still live with in the wilderness and the boys raise up and to prove their manhood they go out with the spear and they go kill a lion and then they become like hey this is proof that I can lead I go kill a lion and so you know the whole bone in the nose and the Hoops that stretch out and they got all the you know stuff and just glitter and all this you know worship to these other things but but this one sister you can tell that she was a Christian but she had the the mark of that tribal uh characteristic it was a mark on her but when she came up those her ears were dangling she didn't have any of that jewelry and she'd even know she's like ah I don't really need prayer for anything God has provided everything I've never I need it I don't know why I'm here she was smiling and beaming and it just dawned on me I said sister go and tell people that God he meets every need you know sometimes we just need instruction sometimes we don't just like the brother said about the guide sometimes we just need the guy to tell us what to do next go into the world and testify that God is our provider he meets every need so I thought praise God he can take someone from the bush that had the mark and to restore him into a daughter of God knowing that it's the same God that provides for you the same God that provides for me amen and this now is uh this is Brother alliance's Church they they had a previous church building that he told us that they actually their old building was like this and they built the new building around the old building I was like wow they saved money on scaffolding you could just stand on the roof and but they were able to still have church and so I just it was a head scratcher for me but but uh very very beautiful church and um and um yeah go ahead brother this was on the drive there we were just the roads are very different so we were going to end up having services Friday night Saturday night Saturday night you know nothing just Saturday night Sunday morning Sunday evening and then Tuesday okay what he said this is a view from the church going out that was their little Fellowship Hall area where the tent was they were just hanging out one thing I'll say about being in the sun for more than about 15 minutes things are very different there they're they're using heavy jackets I mean they they cover their skin I was my arm got sunburned and it's just different there so a lot of the people they cover themselves and it's hot so anyway you notice they're under the tree or they're under the Pavilion a lot of people ain't just standing around in the Sun and that's because it's hot this is this is one of our favorite songs we heard on this trip [Music] [Music] we were worshiping the Lord all right [Music] and his brother Elias that's his home church he pastures and this was like Sunday morning brother cosmon took the service on Sunday morning this is our brother Elias's home I believe this was Tuesday evening after the Tuesday evening service uh brother Andrew ended up preaching that one I think we were at his house just eating and just more food this is when we were going to expose to get Fufu so we were really excited about that so on Monday um so Monday was my anniversary that was one of the things that I had to overcome but I called my wife was like honey the brothers are going to take a day go drive three hours somewhere it's going to be a safari where they see something where there's animals and it's Caldera where there was a volcanic eruption that collapsed but now it's just a natural habitat where these tribal people live with these animals it's pretty bizarre pretty neat but I was so tired one thing that happened for me I think my average night of sleep was like two and a half hours and I just you know it was three flights 26 hours just in the air or 23 something like that it was really physically taxing but so worth it the Lord was gracious but I was thinking oh if I could just rest I got one more service I could just rest never have I had preached four services in one week so I mean I had a lot to overcome so then when I talked to my kids and my wife they're like ah you should go you never did so when I'm going one of the things that as you drive and you start going through there they call it an African massage I mean it's like George rattling and so when he first said I thought he said an African message I was like man I got to talk to this driver some more because I ended up it was just real Sovereign how the Lord dealt but this is uh brother Peter and so I call him brother he's just he was a nominal person and when a Believer and but when we I ended up going and so they were waiting for me I was getting some things done and so I was the last one and so I had the front seat next to him and he was standing there and kind of giving an introduction where he asked if I would oh you know pray for the day and so I ended up in the front seat for probably the first hour just him and I fellowshipping and he was so blessed and I was too and at the end of our our trip and and while we went out there we had such great Fellowship the Lord it was so amazing because he says he's been doing this 16 years and on the journey he says never never not one time has he seen Lions through the main path the Lions would come way way down in another area so not only he said oh look there's something ahead and was it the lions that came first no it was giraffes he's like this is this is this doesn't happen he goes your God must be real he's now he's testifying to us I'm like so he sees giraffes you know and then and then we saw zebras and then we saw Lions he was like what is going on he goes the Safari's over we already could go back and we weren't we still had another two hours to go and so I just thought you know what that's what our God does he testifies he gives witness of the Holy Ghost so that people can you know what this is something to Marvel at this is different what we're talking about is different this is not the same thing that the church world has this is something that's alive and real and God's vindicating he's coming behind his Believers and he'll stand behind you when you stand behind this word amen this this could be a good part for the Trojan to enjoy there's some animals in here that brother Andrew took a lot of good pictures he's a good photographer this is the gorongoro crater but their Elias just wanted to bless us with a small little trip on our day off and so he scheduled this I don't know I think uh a few weeks before we got there but he's like hey do you enjoy this you can rest a little bit and so the drive into the crater was about three hours it was 160 kilometers and so this was the view of the crater before you go in the crater and you start looking inside where the animals and you know the Lord really blessed me with this because you know we see God in nature we see his Redemption plan of what he's created in nature because that's who he is that's his nature that's what he does his life you know you can tell a tree by the way grows and all these things in the grass and just a just the beauty of his creation and so this really spoke to me very deeply and and I was blessed from that perspective this is a group of Maasai on the side of the road um these tribes the the government is actually starting to sponsor those who are willing to leave that land and they're providing shelter in different areas because they don't really this has become such a tourist place that they you know people kind of get alarmed with the guy with the spear and a machete you know and they they have they feel and the the guide was telling us that they feel that the cattle whether it's on your land whether it came from your cow or any of that it's theirs they were given cattle and so they'll just take it and then they'll they'll go to Arms with you and so you know from that standpoint a lot of them they're still there and Uh something's so profound and I'll just stop here for just a second something's so profound happened to me while I was there and and it's giving me a message but there was a man that was one of these men that live out in the jungle and he had a spear in one hand and a cell phone in the other you gave me a message so if the Lord permit I want to share that with you so you know we're living in a blending time so but anyway that's that's for later Lord willing this is um the African Buffalo I believe the Bison beautiful beautiful you know beautiful scenery it was Tanzania is really a good looking country really nice there's the zebras are the kids enjoying these like this I took a video for you too here's the one right here yes you know it's so peaceful when man does not disturb the creation of God you know when he goes in and perverts it and try to do his own thing and and then you realize otherwise it's just peaceful there's just um this was the end of the crater where we stopped and I took that picture it really spoke to me because you see it's a very beautiful tree it's planted by the water you know it's providing shade it's got a bunch of rocks in it it's got a lot of Revelation um there's a big one right here to the left but you know that's that's the creation of God brother Branham says this and we'll just kind of close this portion here slowly but brother bam says this it says and then you take a tree it says take a tree it reflects the tree of life which is in heaven the Tree of Life something that he gave us an image of that we can look and say you know Lord a tree of life it says all these things are struggling for perfection and everything in the natural as Hebrew says here was made of things which do not appear it says in other words they are Supernatural and the Supernatural is reflecting the natural see now then the natural was eternal the natural was eternal or is to be Everlasting with the supernatural but sin unbelief perverted the natural and it says and so and if that is so which I believe it is this is the prophet saying it it says then everything that's happening on Earth is a type of spiritual things happening see and so a Son of God is led by the spirit of God by the spirit of Truth and for me personally I I don't want to be too spiritual but you know I think expectation is good because if we have expectation now he can walk us into the footsteps of the word if we're walking the footsteps of Jesus we know Jesus is the word and so if he goes before us if he if his word goes before us then we know we're following the right direction this is Tuesday brother Andrew took the last service I believe but but Andrew's got a testimony brother Jerome here you know it isn't God good you know to be able to give us a part in Redemption you know he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and he put us on he put us on uh how do they say it you're you're you're you're a joint heirs with Christ and this this um one thing as we kind of close the testimony and the mission trip I want to say this you never know what God has in mind until sometimes you're in it and so the thing that I I want to say is is uh maybe if if we can just take maybe about five or ten minutes I want to share a burden with you from my heart and if I could just have you consider something and it's out of uh your Bible if you want to turn with me I just I'll just share this from the standpoint of what the Lord spoke to my heart that I feel like complements what our pastor was saying out of John 17 but over in the book of First Peter the third chapter and if I forget now please be in prayer for brother Otis um he is he is a warrior and he is fighting and so we just trust that he'll be back in the house of the Lord worshiping the Lord and overcoming all obstacles so in First Peter chapter 3 in verse 1 it says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear and then if we skip down if we could read there in verse 10 says for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking no guile let him assure evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good but and if ye suffered for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their Terror neither be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in your heart and be ready always to give an answer to the to every man that asks you for the reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as a evil doers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ for it is better if the will of God be so that ye suffer doing well for doing for then for evil doing and so I would encourage you to read the entire chapter but something the Lord spoke to my heart and and I didn't understand it but it was just the phrase be ready always you know as we're journeying in the last stretch of this road as the scripture has admonished us to be ready always you know America needs missionaries more than anywhere in the world people who actually live by the word of God not just by a Creed not just by a concept but by a new birth experience led into the storehouse spiritual food and due season where Christ is living in a people not human beings taking on Concepts but God himself living out his life the admonition that I would say is just like was said here and you know Peter he knew what it was like you know Peter came to a place where he said who do men say I the son of man am and Peter got this great Revelation he said Thou Art the Christ see his his mouth had spoken some things but immediately he turned and he said this plan that's going to be for my king my Messiah be it far from me and all of a sudden Jesus is saying get thee behind me Satan so Peter knows a little bit about what he's talking about here you know there's something that happens sometimes in life where you might say some things and the word of God comes and corrects us but that doesn't change that you're a son or a daughter of God it just means God's bringing us somewhere God's showing us something and so as we're going forward we're looking and we're saying now I want to be ready always what is it saying he's saying but sanctify the Lord God in your heart and I thought what what are you trying to say because the the scripture says in John 17 he says thy sanctify them through Thy word and see I'm I'm I am such in a place in my life and I know you are I want to be free in the spirit I want the word of God to shine forth I don't want my bad attitude I don't want something of my mistakes of yesterday to affect my today because there's a world that I am living out every day I'm making contact I want to sanctify the Lord God in my heart God has made his Abode in my heart God has come in he's cleansed me amen he showed me that I'm not just this bag of bones I'm not just my mind when I think about it but I'm the thought of God manifested just like you are you were in the back part of God's mind and you've come here to be tested come here to be tried come here to face difficulties and yet not speak guile not to revile when someone reviles you but you can hold your peace because there's a God in your heart there's somebody who Sanctified you with the blood amen amen sanctify the Lord God in your heart and be ready be ready see what God is trying to teach us teach me is you know what I want to be ready always he said I'll be with you and in you always even till the end this is not just sometimes this is always he's an ever-present help in a time of trouble it's the I am walking with us we're walking with him hand in hand amen amen amen so we want to sanctify the Lord God in our heart and be ready always not just to say anything but now he's saying for what reason he said be ready to give an answer well we got answers for a lot of things we got an answer for why the government does this and why our boss did that and why our daughter did that and why my mom did that we got answers for all kinds of stuff but the Bible's saying give an answer of the hope that's in you what is the hope that's in you I didn't choose God God chose you God chose me this is not some kind of workup your name was on a book before this world ever came to pass before it was ever here in existence and you're only here to manifest God in that wonderful be ready always be Sanctified it's God speaking through human lips when you speak this word with the spirit of God in you it's God speaking sanctify the Lord God in your heart and be ready to give an answer to every man what the hope that you have amen I'm not angry I'm happy give it to every man not just some men every man be willing God wants to use your testimony but we want to do it in meekness and in fear you know when you really catch the revelation that you're a part of God you're not just the sum and substance of your flesh your memory your reasonings your imaginations your conscience you're you're you're outside man it don't believe you're inside man is really confused your memory it tells you it's a make-believer but when your soul is converted it's a real believer Lord help me you know it's just so special that we can do what the word said do because you're the word you have the potentials to express what we're speaking on but having a good conscience and this is the thing just like what was said you know Jesus when he was reviled you know he Sanctified himself he showed us a way you know he said if someone comes to you and he smites you on the cheek you have it in you to turn the cheek we don't have to defend ourselves because we have a great defender and sometimes I believe that if we'll just wait God wants to reveal something a quality of himself in us and through us I just feel like I I have more than what I have time for maybe just I don't know how to transition but you know something that you know was on my heart to share you know this this you know the church is a type of of uh of a woman and I believe Peter is expressing here something that you know has a spiritual you know brother Branham said this nature this flesh we were married to it and this is like a husband this flesh and so even in this scripture if you take the type and you realize we're the Bride of Jesus Christ you know and this flesh it's going to be won by a chaste conversation see the scripture says in First Peter in in First Peter chapter 3 says likewise women and this is also dealing with the natural course but if you see the subjection to our own husband we're subject to our husband which is the revealed word of the hour and he says if any obey not the word he can maybe won by the chase conversation you know this Inside Man is the one that's getting the victory that's causing this out man outside man to come subject it must come subject amen but we want to fight from the inside not from the outside and it says this in in verse 3 says who's adorning let it not be outward we don't want it to be outward we don't want religion we want God on the inside but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which in the sight of God is a great price amen amen I just maybe I'll just take just a little bit of a you know I want to encourage you you know something in the dietary Church age and I'll just try to read a quote and just close because I feel like I can go way too long and we've already been here for a while but I really want to share this with you you know the thyatarian was a dominating female and so in this age the the admonition came in Revelations chapter 2 and verse 19 I believe it was or or 18. but you know we want to always be ready from the standpoint of being servants you know part of our commission you know we're here on Earth because we've been created by Christ Jesus to be here to show forth his workmanship we are his workmanship don't don't think oh well because I don't go to Africa where I don't go to China or if I don't go to Mexico if I don't know you right now can fulfill the commission you can go into your world you can display God to a world that's either going to receive your testimony and it's going to change them or they're going to look at you and say fanaticism there's no way that's God and it brings about a fulfillment so I I say this let's not worry about the what other people decide but let's play our part you know and in this dietary Church age where there was this church that it was a a dominating female this is um it says I know your service Jesus said he is the greatest of all he that is greatest of all servant to all and a wise man commended on this saying here's what he said only history would prove the truth of this that word daikum that man was right that man was right and all truly great men in history have been servants those who demand to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they use when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you will find that truly the great were those who served others history can never Acclaim those who much was done but it forever will praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow hit that example see him as he bowed himself over the feet of his Apostles and washed their tired dirty feet he was he's he said you don't know what I'm doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought to do you also ought to do he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights amen and one day in Judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord and it is hard to always be a servant but those who are spent those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne aren't you grateful this is plain language let the word of God interpret it by letting it come to pass in our lives to take the humble road to take the meek I honor my king he's making his Abode he's teaching me how to be a servant to not fear what man can say not fear the accusations of the this that and the other the accuser of the brethren we are not Divided We Are One one in heart one in purpose I'm going to serve God even if in my death I'm going to bring Praises up to his name because he's my healer I know my redeemer liveth amen you willing to do that amen I believe you are it's it's it is hard to be always a servant but those who've been and been for others one day will be seated with it it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master for the Dawn Till the Setting Sun and let us talk of all his wondrous love and care and when life's all over and all the work on Earth is done and the roles up come will be Called Up Yonder and I know that I really wanted to go through and try to read a little bit more but I encourage you to take your church age book let God speak to you you know there's there's spiritual food and I know that you do but if you could just take that and just with what God placed on my heart let him break it even more wide open you know I'm just a man but I I know that God he spoke to my heart and I believe that was for this service so I trust the Lord has blessed you and maybe as we wouldn't stand we can just maybe sing only believe as we would turn the service back over to our pastor and if we just in preparations for singing that song If you want to Bow your heart before the Lord tonight and you just you want to say God you spoke to my heart and I
