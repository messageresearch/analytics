[44:26] [Music]
[44:35] Oh. And Lord, I've counted
[44:39] all
[44:41] the weak places I see.
[44:45] Oh, in me. Oh, and it will be stripped.
[44:51] He'll take it all away this morning.
[44:55] Oh, by the power of your love
[45:03] [Music]
[45:05] and holy
[45:09] Lord.
[45:11] Let your love.
[45:15] Hallelujah.
[45:17] Oh, bring me near.
[45:21] [Music]
[45:25] Hold and draw me to you. Oh, draw me to
[45:32] [Music]
[45:40] Oh, and I rise up like it is.
[45:48] Oh, and I will soul,
[45:51] Lord, and your spirit leads me all. Oh,
[45:56] in the power of love.
[45:59] Let's all stand and sing that second
[46:01] verse as you read brother Matthew.
[46:05] Oh, Lord, I'm f.
[46:09] Open my eyes this morning, Lord.
[46:13] Let me see you face to face.
[46:17] Oh, and know allies of your love. Oh, as
[46:23] you
[46:26] [Music]
[46:28] me.
[46:29] [Music]
[46:35] Oh
[46:37] my mind.
[46:40] Oh, as we unfold
[46:45] in my life.
[46:47] Oh, we live in every
[46:50] hallelujah.
[46:53] [Music]
[46:54] Oh,
[46:56] [Music]
[47:04] and
[47:06] [Music]
[47:22] me.
[47:24] Oh, draw me to your side.
[47:31] [Music]
[47:33] And I
[47:38] I'll rise up like the eagle
[47:42] [Music]
[47:46] and I will soar with you.
[47:49] Your spirit leads me on
[47:53] by the power of your love.
[47:58] Lord, unveil my eyes.
[48:01] [Music]
[48:06] my eyes.
[48:08] Let me see you face.
[48:13] You face
[48:15] the knowledge of your love.
[48:20] as you
[48:23] me
[48:27] as you live in me.
[48:33] Lord, renew
[48:35] my mind
[48:38] as your will unfold
[48:42] in my life.
[48:44] Oh, living every day
[48:51] in the power of your love.
[48:55] Oh, Holy Ghost,
[48:58] Holy Ghost,
[49:01] hold
[49:04] me close and let you surround
[49:12] me.
[49:13] [Music]
[49:16] Bring
[49:19] me
[49:21] and draw me to your side.
[49:29] Oh,
[49:33] I will. I'll rise up my
[49:43] and I will surren
[49:46] [Music]
[49:50] the power of your love.
[49:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[49:58] I think this might just be an
[49:59] opportunity
[50:01] if you haven't taken it in a while, why
[50:04] don't you just use right now just to
[50:06] start to talk to him. Don't worry about
[50:08] your neighbor.
[50:11] You know, I I I just want to say he's
[50:14] worthy of praise.
[50:17] I say he's worthy to tell him, Lord,
[50:20] you're the King of Kings.
[50:23] You're the Lord of glory. You're the
[50:25] great I am the creator of heavens and
[50:28] earth, Lord. And I worship you. And I
[50:31] worship you alone, Lord. And I want to
[50:33] give you glory. And I want to give you
[50:35] honor, Lord. I I want to lift your name
[50:37] up on high because you are worthy to be
[50:39] praised, Lord. Your works cannot be
[50:42] compared. They they can't be fathom,
[50:44] Lord. The depth of your love, your
[50:46] greatness, Lord, it's too high. It's too
[50:49] low. It's too wide. We can't even begin
[50:51] to comprehend, Lord. And we just want to
[50:53] tell you we thank you Lord. We thank you
[50:55] for your love. We thank you for your
[50:57] grace. We thank you for your mercy Lord.
[50:59] Thank you for this message. Thank thank
[51:01] you for pulling us out of Lady Osia and
[51:04] pulling us out of the muck and mire.
[51:06] Lord uh giving us Isab that we might
[51:08] see. Lord we just want to worship you
[51:10] this morning a little bit. Tell you how
[51:12] much we love you and appreciate you
[51:16] Lord. I believe you desire and seek
[51:18] those that would worship you.
[51:22] Lord, not in spirit only, but in truth.
[51:26] And Lord, you've given us truth.
[51:29] You've illuminated our path and opened
[51:31] our eyes that we might see.
[51:34] And Lord, because of what you've done in
[51:36] this day, in this age, Lord, we can
[51:38] declare that you are the same yesterday,
[51:41] today, and forever. You are not just a
[51:44] God of 2,000 years ago. Lord, you are
[51:47] present here amongst us right now to
[51:49] minister to our needs. So, we just
[51:51] surrender to you that you would have
[51:53] your will and way in this service. We
[51:55] ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:56] Christ we pray.
[51:58] Amen. Hallelujah. It's good to be in his
[52:01] presence. Let's just go ahead and turn
[52:02] in our Bibles to First Thessalonians
[52:06] chapter 4.
[52:11] Amen. We were going to maybe minister
[52:13] along a certain line, but I kind of got
[52:16] pulled back into this sermon as we
[52:19] listened to why Christ speak. And uh we
[52:22] ministered a couple
[52:24] uh weeks ago on a Sunday morning on the
[52:27] pull of the rapture. And we just uh we
[52:29] were bringing that out of why Christ
[52:30] speak. And just want to pick up on that
[52:32] thought, but we'll we'll title this uh
[52:34] speak and go forward.
[52:37] In 1 Thessalonians 4:16,
[52:41] I sure like this. It says, "For the Lord
[52:44] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[52:47] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[52:50] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[52:52] Christ shall rise first. Then we which
[52:54] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[52:56] together with them in the clouds to meet
[52:58] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[53:01] ever be with the Lord.
[53:05] Wherefore comfort
[53:07] one another with these words, Amen. You
[53:11] may have your seats.
[53:14] Brother Brandham would say in why cry
[53:17] speak
[53:20] in paragraph 49 he says just as we know
[53:23] as a man asked me a few moments ago
[53:25] about the coming and the rapture we know
[53:29] we've lived the time out and the time of
[53:32] the rapture is at hand.
[53:35] And we're looking for a rapturing faith
[53:39] that can pull the church together and
[53:41] give it some supernatural strength that
[53:44] can change these bodies that we live in.
[53:48] Well, I like how our text said, "Comfort
[53:51] one another with these words." We are
[53:53] going in a rapture.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; These bodies will be changed. And uh I
[53:59] just pull for an inspiration from
[54:01] paragraph 239. Why Christ speak? He
[54:04] says, "Speak to the people
[54:07] and let's go forward."
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Speak to the people and let's go
[54:12] forward. Amen. We got an objective.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's glory.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; I like that objective.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; A lot of people got objectives out
[54:22] there.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Things they're wanting to accomplish and
[54:26] they have goals and ambitions and, you
[54:28] know, they they some people believe,
[54:30] well, I I've been raised up for this
[54:32] purpose. you know, I I'm going to be a
[54:34] ball player or I'm going to be an
[54:35] architect. You know, I have a goal and
[54:38] objective in my life and and there's
[54:41] things that I want to accomplish and and
[54:44] and you know, they they go through great
[54:45] measures and lengths to be educated and
[54:48] and those things are okay. But I would
[54:50] say this, if if God ever gives you a a a
[54:54] career or profession, uh uh you it's
[54:57] it's not that you are an architect, but
[54:59] you are a Christian and your objective
[55:03] is glory, and you are just holding the
[55:05] office of an architect.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Because when people come in contact,
[55:09] your trade might be an architect, but
[55:11] your objective is glory.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; I I I say that that comfort one another
[55:16] with these words. You ain't working for
[55:18] a paycheck. I say if you want to be in
[55:20] bondage and you want to and you just
[55:22] want to tie right in with the rat race
[55:24] and everything and and you're just
[55:26] working to pay the bills and you're just
[55:28] working to get a paycheck and oh if I
[55:31] can just get a raise I'll be able to
[55:33] afford that car and then and if I can do
[55:35] this and oh I tell you what that's not
[55:37] really a good objective those things are
[55:39] okay and it's nice to strive to have uh
[55:41] nice things you know even scripturally
[55:44] it says oh you know above all I would
[55:45] have you to prosper but even the world
[55:47] and Christianity has taken in that and
[55:49] made a prosperity mess out of the gospel
[55:52] of Jesus Christ. I would say there's one
[55:53] thing that God would want you to prosper
[55:55] in is that is in the word. He wants you
[55:58] to prosper in the message of the hour
[55:59] and in his objective and his objective
[56:02] is glory. And I say, praise God, we got
[56:04] an objective.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Lady OCA ain't got nothing on me.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; I it it's tried and and designed to try
[56:13] to pull you into its objective. Have you
[56:16] ever uh uh uh got got talking to
[56:18] somebody and they have something to sell
[56:20] you or they want to talk you talk you
[56:22] into something here recently? I I I I
[56:24] had an invitation to maybe uh uh witness
[56:27] to an a a gentleman and and he had
[56:30] questions and and I thought, you know,
[56:32] I'd certainly want to help him. And the
[56:34] more I got to talking to him, all he had
[56:36] was questions.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; And I found out he wasn't really looking
[56:40] for answers. He was just wanting to
[56:42] question.
[56:43] And I thought, "My, this sounds really
[56:45] really really familiar." He says, 'Well,
[56:48] aren't you, aren't you open to other
[56:50] ideas? You know, I, you know, I've
[56:52] talked to people and they're so rigid
[56:54] and they're so they're so set in their
[56:56] ways, but but are you open to maybe
[56:58] considering h something you haven't
[57:00] thought of before? Or are you open to
[57:02] maybe considering another way?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And I said, let me ask you something,
[57:07] sir. I said, I want to tell you, I'm
[57:09] happily married.
[57:11] And I said, "I love my wife and she
[57:13] loves me."
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Now, do you think it would be fair for a
[57:17] man to come to her and say, "I want to
[57:18] ask you, are you open to another way of
[57:20] thinking?"
[57:22] &gt;&gt; I said, "You see, I'm in a relationship
[57:24] with my Lord,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; and I am married to him, and I'm not
[57:28] open to any suggestions. I'm not open to
[57:31] any other way.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; I have an objective."
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; We got an objective. That's glory.
[57:40] Let's move to it.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; We're headed to the promised land.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[57:50] believe.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer?
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Speak to the people. Haven't I proved
[57:56] it? Haven't I even had my picture made
[57:59] among you
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and everything else and done everything
[58:05] that could be done to prove that I'm
[58:07] with you? Doesn't the magazines just a
[58:10] few weeks ago packed the article when
[58:12] you said here at the pulpit that would
[58:14] take place out here and three months
[58:16] beforehands and there it went taking
[58:18] place and vindicate even the science
[58:21] knows about it.
[58:23] Everybody you following the prophet
[58:25] &gt;&gt; and everything that I've done and you're
[58:27] still waiting
[58:29] speak to the people and go forward to
[58:33] your objective.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have an objective.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; What is our objective? What is your
[58:42] objective?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; What is your objective?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Glory. I I like that. And and and it
[58:51] wasn't my idea. That was God's mind to
[58:53] you. You have an objective. And I'd say
[58:56] we ought to remind ourselves with that.
[58:57] We ought to comfort one another with
[58:59] these words that we got an objective. We
[59:02] are going into the promises of God. We
[59:04] are going into a rapture. I have an
[59:06] objective. My objective is rapture. My
[59:10] objective is body change. My objective
[59:12] is the word of God. My objective is the
[59:15] message of the hour. My objective is not
[59:18] Lady Osia. My objective is not my job.
[59:20] Yes, in Lady Osia. And in my job, I will
[59:23] declare the works of the Lord. For ye
[59:25] are the light of the world. Let let the
[59:28] world see your good works that it might
[59:30] glorify God. But we have an objective.
[59:38] And I want to say that there is no
[59:41] obstacle.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; There is no trial.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; There's no Red Sea.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; There ain't no death. There ain't no
[59:52] devil. There ain't no demon
[59:55] &gt;&gt; that can stop you from moving forward
[59:57] into your objective.
[1:00:01] Uh maybe I should say that again because
[1:00:03] some of us need some deliverance. Some
[1:00:05] of us need to be reminded because even
[1:00:07] the prophet of God in this sermon, why
[1:00:09] Christ speak, he said Moses forgot. He
[1:00:12] said others didn't. Samson, he knew and
[1:00:14] others knew. But you know Moses somehow
[1:00:16] forgot. He forgot that he was anointed
[1:00:18] and he was called and he was elected for
[1:00:20] the job and he forgot. I say it's good
[1:00:22] to be reminded that we have an objective
[1:00:24] and we are going forward into every
[1:00:26] promise of God and there ain't no trial.
[1:00:30] There ain't no devil. There ain't no
[1:00:32] hardship. There ain't no fault. There
[1:00:34] ain't no failure. There's nothing that's
[1:00:36] going to hinder me from moving into my
[1:00:39] objective. And my objective is glory.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's move into it. Let's go
[1:00:46] forward. Let's move into our objective.
[1:00:50] We have an objective. Oh, I like that.
[1:00:55] I'm so glad that's I tell you what, you
[1:00:57] know, a lot of times when uh uh when
[1:00:59] maybe uh uh things might need to be done
[1:01:01] and you're handing out chores or or
[1:01:03] maybe you're trying to build something,
[1:01:05] you know, you start handing out jobs and
[1:01:07] hey, I need you to do this and and you
[1:01:09] to do that and and maybe you're putting
[1:01:11] together a skit, you know, and and
[1:01:13] you're getting a little parts and and I
[1:01:15] and I remember one time we did a little
[1:01:17] play and and about uh uh uh Rebecca and
[1:01:21] Isaac, you know, and and and we had to
[1:01:23] hand out parts. You know, some people
[1:01:24] had to be camels.
[1:01:27] Is there still any camels here? Are all
[1:01:29] the camels gone? I know. Somebody had to
[1:01:33] be a palm tree. I don't know. Is our
[1:01:35] palm tree still here, man? All of All of
[1:01:38] Hey, I think I see them back there.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you might have forgot, Brother
[1:01:42] Tuanda, but you were a palm tree,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; right? We But we all had to play a part,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; you know? I got to be Rebecca's father.
[1:01:53] A and and I I Jackson got to be uh uh
[1:01:57] oh, how how could I forget his name? Mel
[1:01:59] uh Ellie. Uh uh oh. Oh my. That's that's
[1:02:03] a shame. But all the parts,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; All the parts
[1:02:11] had to be played.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; And somebody was like, "Oh, I want the
[1:02:15] lead part. I I I want to I want to be
[1:02:17] Rebecca. I want to be Isaac.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I want to be Elizer. I want to I want to
[1:02:23] I want to be the main character.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; And I just think, oh, to think that God
[1:02:28] when he was laying out his great plan
[1:02:30] and he was coming to the climax of
[1:02:33] everything that he had ever desired
[1:02:36] and how his first masterpiece uh fell
[1:02:40] into the earth and he built back into
[1:02:42] another masterpiece in Christ Jesus. And
[1:02:44] now through 2,000 years, he was building
[1:02:47] up again into a great climax to have a
[1:02:50] bride. And when the parts were being
[1:02:52] handed out, he said, "I want you to play
[1:02:55] that part. And I want you to play that
[1:02:57] part." What is my objective? Your
[1:02:59] objective is glory. Your objective is
[1:03:01] rapture. Your objective is body change.
[1:03:04] You're the main character.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; You're the apple of his eye. He died for
[1:03:11] you. He went to Calvary for you. He went
[1:03:13] to hell for you. He rose from the grave
[1:03:16] and has ascended up on high. I say he's
[1:03:19] worthy to be praised. And he has elected
[1:03:22] you and called you and given you an
[1:03:24] objective.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, that makes me happy.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And there ain't no devil.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; There ain't no demon. And there ain't no
[1:03:35] church member that can take your part.
[1:03:39] You don't have to be sitting over there
[1:03:41] wondering and worrying, "Well, Lord, I
[1:03:44] thought you gave me a gift to be this,
[1:03:46] and I I thought you called me to do
[1:03:48] this."
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; That's not faith.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; See, faith doesn't fear.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't wonder. As you move
[1:03:55] further in the message, Brother Random
[1:03:58] starts talking about having faith in
[1:03:59] your anointing.
[1:04:01] having faith in your calling, what
[1:04:02] you've been called to do,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; and how Satan wants to get you to reason
[1:04:08] and to wonder. Oh, oh, well, well, maybe
[1:04:10] maybe this or maybe that. No, I say it's
[1:04:12] time to have faith in who we are.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; As we would read in the scripture in
[1:04:17] Exodus 14
[1:04:19] and 14, it would say, "The Lord shall
[1:04:21] fight for you,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; and you shall hold your peace." And the
[1:04:27] Lord said unto Moses,
[1:04:29] "Wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak
[1:04:33] unto the children of Israel
[1:04:35] that they go forward." We're ministering
[1:04:37] on the thought speak and go forward.
[1:04:40] Let's go forward to our objective. Every
[1:04:44] promise in the Bible is yours. Amen. A
[1:04:48] every promise that God has given you, I
[1:04:51] want to tell you, it's yours. You don't
[1:04:54] have to wonder. You don't you don't have
[1:04:55] to fear. You don't you don't have to
[1:04:57] think about somebody else is going to
[1:04:59] take your part. You don't have to worry
[1:05:00] about uh uh the enemy catching up to you
[1:05:02] and tearing you down. No, I think it's
[1:05:05] if you go on and just read a little bit
[1:05:06] further, here comes the armies of of of
[1:05:10] Egypt coming after uh uh uh the children
[1:05:13] of Israel. And what does the scripture
[1:05:14] says? The very pillar of cloud that was
[1:05:17] leading them and guiding them. What did
[1:05:18] it do? It went back and it stood between
[1:05:21] the enemy and between the camp of
[1:05:24] Israel. I want to tell you this message,
[1:05:26] this pillar of fire, this cloud that has
[1:05:29] descended, the Lord himself shall
[1:05:32] descend. What is it? It's the mighty
[1:05:34] angel coming down clothed with a cloud.
[1:05:37] And what is he doing? I say he stands
[1:05:39] between you and the enemy. The devil
[1:05:42] tries to shift you out. The devil tries
[1:05:44] to tear you down. But I want to say this
[1:05:45] word is your protection. This word is
[1:05:48] keeping you. This word is guiding you.
[1:05:51] This word is going to show you the way.
[1:05:53] This word will part the Red Sea. Any
[1:05:55] devil, any demon that tries to get in
[1:05:58] the way of your objective, you can speak
[1:06:01] the word and go forward.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Well, how we going to do it?
[1:06:09] How we going to go in a rapture?
[1:06:12] How we going to possess the promised
[1:06:14] land?
[1:06:16] How are we going to defeat the enemy?
[1:06:21] How are how how are we going to do these
[1:06:22] things? Brother Matthew, I was listening
[1:06:25] to the greatest battle ever fought and
[1:06:28] and uh oh my uh uh brother Brandham
[1:06:30] started to he starts to talk about, you
[1:06:32] know, uh that's what Satan's kingdom
[1:06:34] does is Satan brings sickness and
[1:06:37] disease and he brings all of these
[1:06:40] things onto the children of God. But he
[1:06:43] said, he said, "But God's children,
[1:06:45] God's army is ordained to cast it out."
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "We cast down reasoning. We
[1:06:50] cast out devils. We cast down sickness."
[1:06:53] Satan brings all these things onto the
[1:06:55] believer. But we, as the army of God,
[1:06:57] what do we do? We cast it down.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; He he he goes a little bit further and
[1:07:04] he starts to talk about uh uh Grant, I
[1:07:07] believe it is. And he said he said you
[1:07:09] know how how did how did Grant take
[1:07:11] Richmond you know that that great
[1:07:13] victory there in the Civil War I believe
[1:07:15] as he as he came to Richmond Virginia
[1:07:18] and it says how you know he says how did
[1:07:20] rich how did he take it he said as he
[1:07:22] come to it he said that's how each one
[1:07:25] of us how are you going to get the
[1:07:27] victory I would say as you come to it
[1:07:29] how are you gonna go through the Red Sea
[1:07:30] as you come to it how is bitter water
[1:07:32] gonna be made sweet as you come to it
[1:07:35] how are you gonna drink water in the
[1:07:36] middle of the desert as you come to it.
[1:07:38] How are you going to cross over the
[1:07:40] river Jordan? As you come to it, you
[1:07:42] don't need to be fearing and you don't
[1:07:43] need to be wondering how is God going to
[1:07:45] do it? How am I going to take a body
[1:07:48] change? How am I going to go into a
[1:07:49] rapture? All I know is I'm walking with
[1:07:51] Jehovah. I have the pillar of fire that
[1:07:54] is with me and I will overcome as I come
[1:07:57] to it. As I have the need
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; that why why are you crying about it? If
[1:08:05] there is a need there, I will overcome
[1:08:07] for you as you have the need.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, he I laid this in there. He said,
[1:08:13] "God's method is to cast out evil, cast
[1:08:16] down reasoning, cast down superstitions,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; cast down worry.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; We We should stay there a little while
[1:08:27] this morning. Some of us are worrying
[1:08:29] about our kids.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Some of us are worrying about our
[1:08:32] health. Some of us are worrying about
[1:08:34] our job.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; It's not healthy.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Plenty of people come through the prayer
[1:08:41] line and brother Brandham, discern the
[1:08:43] thoughts and intents of their heart. Uh
[1:08:45] worried or nervousness or trying to
[1:08:47] cross bridges before you get there and
[1:08:49] and you're worried. Is my boy going to
[1:08:51] be saved? Is my girl cast that down?
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, you demon of glory. I cast you
[1:08:58] down.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I am a child of God. I have been elected
[1:09:03] and I have an objective and my objective
[1:09:05] is to take the sword of the world and
[1:09:07] cast you down.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, let's get the worry and the gloom
[1:09:14] off the bride of Christ.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; We are not wondering. We are not
[1:09:19] fearful. I am not worried. My kids will
[1:09:22] be saved. They will be born again. They
[1:09:25] will go in a rapture. Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] I am not worried. I am not wondering. I
[1:09:32] am not fearful.
[1:09:34] Why? Because I am elected. I am called.
[1:09:37] I'll get my mommy. I'll get my daddy.
[1:09:41] I'll get my brother. I'll get my sister.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I am of the faith of Abraham. Lord, I'm
[1:09:48] coming for you. You might not go in a
[1:09:50] rapture, but I will rescue you out of
[1:09:53] the hands of Satan.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I claim you for the glory of God.
[1:10:00] I am not worried, devil.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; You had me worried. You had me fearful.
[1:10:07] You had me doubt. Oh, but the word of
[1:10:09] the Lord has come.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And now that word is in my mouth.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; There's power in confession.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; I say it's time.
[1:10:24] The bride of Jesus Christ takes the
[1:10:28] revealed word and starts speaking.
[1:10:32] Speak.
[1:10:34] Speak and go forward.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; I am the bride.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And I have an objective. Devil, I cast
[1:10:47] you out in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:51] worry. You can't stay here any longer.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Doubt, fear, anxiety, depression.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; I cast you out.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; I have an objective.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; If my brother's in bondage,
[1:11:12] I have an objective.
[1:11:16] If the devil comes on the scene,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; you got a problem, devil.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:11:26] the Lord.
[1:11:28] Oh my. The mighty angel has descended
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; clothed in a cloud.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; What do you say? We seen the picture.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; The science has declared it.
[1:11:43] But where was his feet?
[1:11:45] His feet were as pillars of fire.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And his feet, hey, that's one objective
[1:11:52] or position I don't mind having because
[1:11:54] if you're the feet of the Lord and I say
[1:11:57] on that day of Pentecost, what was it?
[1:11:58] It was pillars of fire. And the Lord has
[1:12:01] descended with a shout. It's our
[1:12:03] headship. But he got a body pillars of
[1:12:06] fire walking around the earth possessing
[1:12:08] the land having dominion. Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Cast down worry.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Cast down diseases.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Cast down sin.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You're above it.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; I want him to read it.
[1:12:35] This is out of greatest battle ever
[1:12:36] fought.
[1:12:40] Who's this speaking?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Matthew, uh, was that
[1:12:49] pre63? Oh, don't miss it.
[1:12:53] Are you going to limit God to space and
[1:12:54] time and your calendar? God will do what
[1:12:57] he will.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; And according to divine promise, God had
[1:13:01] come and veiled himself in a man.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And it was none other than Jehovah
[1:13:05] speaking.
[1:13:08] And he said,
[1:13:11] "You're above it. Cast down disease.
[1:13:14] Cast down sin. You're above it.
[1:13:16] Resurrected in Christ Jesus,
[1:13:19] setting in heavenly places with every
[1:13:23] devil under your foot."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; I like that objective.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's You mean that's I've called you
[1:13:35] to play this part? What is it? Let me
[1:13:38] read you the script.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Let me read you the part I want you to
[1:13:43] play.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Am I the palm tree? Am I the camel? What
[1:13:47] am I? No, you're the bride of Jesus
[1:13:49] Christ. You're bone of my bone. You are
[1:13:52] flesh of my flesh, life of my life. You
[1:13:55] are power of my power. And here is your
[1:13:58] script. Cast down worry. Cast down
[1:14:02] disease. Cast down sin.
[1:14:06] Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; You're above it.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Resurrected in Christ Jesus, sitting in
[1:14:11] heavenly places with every devil under
[1:14:15] your foot.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Well, where you at, devil?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz I am going to put my foot on your
[1:14:24] head.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put my foot on your neck
[1:14:28] because footsteps are possession.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; The Red Sea wasn't a challenge. It was a
[1:14:35] victory. And I want to tell you, every
[1:14:37] trial, every battle, every demon, every
[1:14:40] disease, every challenge that the devil
[1:14:42] throws at you, it's just another
[1:14:44] victory.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; You are victorious in the name of Jesus
[1:14:51] Christ.
[1:14:55] He says this in paragraph 353,
[1:14:58] that's how soldiers take sin,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; sickness.
[1:15:04] just as they come to it.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I I some somebody just came into a
[1:15:11] trial.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Well, then I say prepare yourself for
[1:15:15] victory.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Devil, you you messed with the wrong
[1:15:22] one.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they got that saying in the world.
[1:15:27] You picked the wrong one, homie.
[1:15:33] Sorry, I used to talk like it.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I used to run like it. And there's a few
[1:15:39] times I had to apologize because I
[1:15:40] realized I got into something was a
[1:15:42] little bigger than me.
[1:15:45] And then you grow up a little bit more
[1:15:46] and get a little bit bigger. And then
[1:15:47] you think, oh, then you lose your common
[1:15:50] sense. You should have said sorry, but
[1:15:52] you you don't know how you you don't owe
[1:15:55] the do the devil any apology.
[1:15:58] You you can't cross the Red Sea. You
[1:16:00] can't have your family. You can't have
[1:16:02] your health. Who Who says who?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Says you.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Who do you think you are, Goliath? You
[1:16:09] come to me in the name of science and
[1:16:11] education and the gods of this evil age.
[1:16:14] I come to you in the name of the Lord
[1:16:16] Jesus Christ. The same God that whooped
[1:16:19] you at Calvary. The same God that poured
[1:16:21] out his spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[1:16:23] The same God that was in brother Paul.
[1:16:25] The same God that was in brother
[1:16:27] Brandham. The same God is here right now
[1:16:30] to take you through that Red Sea.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Cast it out.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's the way they overcome doubts and
[1:16:39] fears and things is when one rises, they
[1:16:42] chop them down.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Move out of the way.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That was a profession.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Did you see it?
[1:16:53] Hey, I had I went through a season of a
[1:16:57] spooky spirit preached and didn't
[1:16:58] realize I was preaching my life for six
[1:17:00] months. A spirit moved up on me and
[1:17:02] started talking to me. You know what I
[1:17:03] had to do? I actually dismissed myself
[1:17:05] and took that thing to a back room and
[1:17:07] started speaking to it.
[1:17:11] And the prophet of God said it, you
[1:17:13] don't know it. You run into devils all
[1:17:14] the time. If you don't, you will.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; There's a real devil. You better
[1:17:19] recognize them real. But when you
[1:17:20] recognize I'm real, then you recognize,
[1:17:23] hey, devil, greater is he that is in me
[1:17:27] than you. Greater is he that is in me
[1:17:29] than that cancer. Greater is he that is
[1:17:32] in me than that worry. Greater is he
[1:17:34] that is in me than that diabetes.
[1:17:36] Greater is he that is in me than that
[1:17:39] anxiety.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Cast it out.
[1:17:48] Move out of
[1:17:51] the way.
[1:17:53] Oh my. That's it. God cast them out like
[1:17:56] he did in heaven. Our great chief
[1:17:59] captain showed us how it was done.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; We have an objective.
[1:18:08] We know where we are going.
[1:18:13] We know who the enemy is.
[1:18:17] We have a vindicated message,
[1:18:20] a pillar of fire, signs and wonders
[1:18:22] leading us into every promise of the
[1:18:26] hour. As Paul would write in Philippians
[1:18:29] 3:13, he said, "Brethren, I count not
[1:18:32] myself to have apprehended, but this one
[1:18:35] thing I do, forgetting those things
[1:18:37] which are behind, and reaching forth
[1:18:39] unto the things which are before, I
[1:18:41] press
[1:18:43] toward the mark, I press toward the
[1:18:46] objective
[1:18:50] of the prize of the high calling of God
[1:18:52] in Christ Jesus." Continuing on now,
[1:18:55] just laying this principle back in. Why
[1:18:57] Christ speak? Just picking up in the
[1:18:59] message 161.
[1:19:02] For you see,
[1:19:04] faith
[1:19:06] sees
[1:19:08] what God wants done.
[1:19:13] Oh, I hope this goes in.
[1:19:16] Faith doesn't look at the present time.
[1:19:20] Faith doesn't see this here.
[1:19:23] Faith looks to see what God wants
[1:19:27] and it works accordingly.
[1:19:31] Now, we've read a little bit about what
[1:19:32] God wants,
[1:19:34] his objective,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; what you're called for.
[1:19:41] God wants and it works accordingly.
[1:19:44] That's what faith does. It sees what God
[1:19:47] wants and what God wants done. And faith
[1:19:50] operates through that.
[1:19:54] Oh my. There's where we get ourselves in
[1:19:56] trouble. We try to operate through what
[1:19:59] we want and what not not what we need.
[1:20:03] Oh, isn't that like it is with the kids?
[1:20:06] You they say, "I'm hungry. What do you
[1:20:08] want to eat? I want a popsicle." Well,
[1:20:10] you ain't hungry.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; I'm hungry. What do you want to eat? I
[1:20:15] want ice cream.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; That's not what you need. That's what
[1:20:18] you want.
[1:20:20] And many times we're baby fashioned.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; We're telling God what we want and not
[1:20:26] what we need.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you better be very careful
[1:20:29] cuz he might give you what you want. And
[1:20:31] you find out it wasn't what you need.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And then you have to come back and say,
[1:20:34] "Lord, I'm sorry. I asked for what I
[1:20:37] wanted, but what I wanted wasn't what I
[1:20:39] needed. Lord, I need you to take that
[1:20:41] one away."
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; We could preach right there for a while.
[1:20:45] Lord, take my wants. Take my desires,
[1:20:49] Lord. Mold me and shape me, oh God, and
[1:20:52] bring me into that stature of a perfect
[1:20:54] man, Lord, where my wants are not my
[1:20:57] wants, but my needs are your word.
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need your word. I
[1:21:09] need revelation.
[1:21:13] I need the objective Lord
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; to become my reality.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, in the whole message, brother lays
[1:21:22] in, uh, Brother Brandham's laying in how
[1:21:24] Moses, he was born for the job. He was
[1:21:28] born with the equipment. He had
[1:21:30] intellectual faith. He knew he was a
[1:21:32] deliverer. He knew all these things. I'm
[1:21:35] called. I'm going in a rapture. I'm the
[1:21:38] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:41] all intellectual faith.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I can't miss it. You know, I'm
[1:21:46] predestinated.
[1:21:48] That's sure. Sure, Moses. Sure. Grow up
[1:21:51] a little bit. But
[1:21:55] with all that knowledge,
[1:21:57] there was one thing he lacked.
[1:22:01] Don't miss it.
[1:22:03] With all of that knowledge, with all
[1:22:06] that understanding,
[1:22:08] with all that
[1:22:10] intellectual faith. There was one thing
[1:22:12] he lacked and that was the pillar fire
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; and that is what Malachi 4:5,
[1:22:20] Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10 1-7 has
[1:22:25] made available to you is the pillar of
[1:22:29] fire.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's God's provided way.
[1:22:38] It's that word, that message.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; It makes a way for you to come into his
[1:22:43] presence.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; When you read in Psalms 119, he says,
[1:22:45] "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet." The
[1:22:49] word is like a lantern that the prophet
[1:22:51] of God said that carries you into his
[1:22:54] presence. The very message of Malachi
[1:22:57] 4:5 has come to carry you into the
[1:23:01] presence of God.
[1:23:04] And then in his presence of the pillar
[1:23:07] of fire, he could anoint
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; that understanding
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; brotherham said the pillar the pillar of
[1:23:16] fire had what Moses lacked.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants done.
[1:23:30] faith.
[1:23:32] We were ending on that quote. It says
[1:23:34] faith operates through that, right? So,
[1:23:36] we want to operate through the word. We
[1:23:38] want to operate through through what God
[1:23:40] has called us to. What what what God's
[1:23:42] objective for our life is. And I want to
[1:23:44] tell you if there's if something is
[1:23:46] contrary to the objective, you have a
[1:23:48] right as a child of God to cast that
[1:23:50] thing out.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Your objective is glory.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Fear is contrary. Worry is contrary.
[1:23:57] Doubt is contrary. Cast it out.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Faith is long range vision. It don't
[1:24:06] lower its sight. It holds to the target.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; See, Satan's He's always trying to get
[1:24:14] you to question your calling to cause
[1:24:17] confusion, doubt, and and fear. Trying
[1:24:20] to get you to lean to your own
[1:24:21] understanding and get you to reason and
[1:24:24] to compromise with the word.
[1:24:28] God gives you an objective. God gives
[1:24:29] you a word.
[1:24:32] We take God at his word. We believe him
[1:24:34] for the word. And what does Satan want
[1:24:35] to do? He wants to come and offer you a
[1:24:37] way that God will carry it out. It's
[1:24:39] exactly what he did to Eve.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Well, oh, oh, no, no, no. You'll be like
[1:24:43] God. No, this is what God wants.
[1:24:46] Oh, really? And what did she do? She
[1:24:48] turned towards reasoning. She turned
[1:24:50] from the word of God to an explanation.
[1:24:53] And oh my goodness, how many times are
[1:24:55] we guilty of trying to explain the will
[1:24:58] of God for our own life instead of
[1:25:00] saying what a prophet said.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Now paragraph 168 just continuing. He
[1:25:05] says notice faith sees what God wants
[1:25:08] you to see. Faith sees what God sees
[1:25:13] and reasoning and senses see what the
[1:25:16] world wants you to see.
[1:25:19] Notice reasoning. Why? It's only human
[1:25:22] senses only reason that it well ain't
[1:25:25] this just as good.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; See that's just exactly when you use
[1:25:30] those senses which are contrary to the
[1:25:32] word. See then that's what the world
[1:25:35] wants you to see.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; But faith don't look at the bills. I
[1:25:41] mean faith don't look at that.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Faith don't look at well my company's
[1:25:48] going out of business. How am I going to
[1:25:50] pay the bills? The same way you always
[1:25:53] paid the bills.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Your work wasn't paying the bills. He
[1:25:57] was paying the bills.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Don't give Lady OC any credit. Don't
[1:26:02] give your job any credit. If God give
[1:26:04] you the job, he'll give you another one.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; You don't have to fear.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Cast that thing down. Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; You cast down reasonings.
[1:26:22] Faith don't look at that. Faith looks at
[1:26:24] what God sees. You know, you cast down
[1:26:26] reasons.
[1:26:28] Brother Brandon would carry on. And in
[1:26:29] what paragraph 173, he he would say that
[1:26:32] faith brought Moses into obedience. And
[1:26:35] we could minister a while on that. But I
[1:26:37] want to say that faith uh uh when faith
[1:26:39] and revelation in this word starts to
[1:26:41] become a reality to to you. I it it it
[1:26:45] it produces an obedience to the word.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; You're no longer struggling with your
[1:26:52] dress. You're no longer struggling with
[1:26:53] with outside things. You know, it's a
[1:26:56] honing down. You know, first it's like
[1:26:58] my the big sledgehammer just chopping
[1:27:00] big old chunks off of your life and the
[1:27:02] sanctification and then washing you up
[1:27:04] and and setting you free and and now my
[1:27:06] you're you're you're you know uh now
[1:27:08] you're dressing right, you're acting
[1:27:09] right. You're you you know you're living
[1:27:11] life but living right. But then it's
[1:27:13] it's a fine honing down to where now you
[1:27:15] become a vessel, a sacrifice that's
[1:27:18] poured out for others because eternal
[1:27:20] life is living for others. you're no
[1:27:22] longer uh trying to fix yourself up and
[1:27:25] patch yourself up and and get you
[1:27:26] feeling good enough to go to church. Oh,
[1:27:28] I better read my Bible and listen to a
[1:27:30] message because I got church tomorrow
[1:27:31] and I don't want to go in church feeling
[1:27:33] unrighteous and unholy, you know, so so
[1:27:35] I better start praying and and I'm going
[1:27:37] to I'm going to listen to a little of
[1:27:38] the message, you know, so I'm kind of up
[1:27:40] to date, you know, like so I can kind of
[1:27:42] come in and feel good about myself, you
[1:27:44] know, you after you've been put through
[1:27:46] the ringer a little bit and and you
[1:27:48] start to realize, I don't know what I
[1:27:49] thought I knew and and God, I really
[1:27:51] need your help and and I really need the
[1:27:52] Holy Ghost, Lord, and I really don't
[1:27:54] understand the message and and I really
[1:27:56] don't know who the son of man is. Lord,
[1:27:57] I've really never even come face to face
[1:27:59] with the pillar of fire, but oh God, by
[1:28:01] your grace and by your mercy, Lord, I
[1:28:03] believe you've called me and you've
[1:28:04] elected me. Lord, I want to meet you
[1:28:06] face to face. I want to see that word
[1:28:07] and that reality that Moses had and
[1:28:09] brother Brandham had and the apostles
[1:28:11] had. Lord, I want that reality in my
[1:28:13] life. Lead me and guide me, build me up.
[1:28:15] Oh, give me your mind. And now you're
[1:28:17] walking in his presence.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; D out to your own ideas and your
[1:28:22] thoughts and your thinking. And it
[1:28:23] brings you into an obedience
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; to his word and to the message of the
[1:28:28] hour.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you might be doing
[1:28:31] something you don't even know that's not
[1:28:33] pleasing to the Lord.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; But then God anoint the pastor and say
[1:28:36] you ought not be wearing them high heels
[1:28:38] and the Holy Ghost goes, "Oh,
[1:28:40] I won't wear those anymore." But you
[1:28:42] prove you ain't got what you think you
[1:28:44] got when you wear them every Sunday.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; That's gospel. That's Bible.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[1:28:51] your life, you know it by its
[1:28:54] characteristics.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; It's identified by its fruits.
[1:29:00] I I I just got to say it, you know, uh
[1:29:04] in in my profession of being a a
[1:29:06] certified arborist, one of the things we
[1:29:08] have to do is is it's called tree
[1:29:10] identification,
[1:29:11] you know, and so we can look at the bark
[1:29:14] and the leaf and the way it grows and
[1:29:15] its pattern and its shape. And even when
[1:29:18] it when it starts to sprout out of the
[1:29:20] ground, many times we can look at a
[1:29:22] little sapling and know that's an elm
[1:29:25] tree or or that's an oak tree.
[1:29:28] And and you know, I was thinking about
[1:29:29] it, how it's that it's identified by its
[1:29:33] characteristics. And if you don't know
[1:29:35] what it is, just wait a little while.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Let it grow up into its maturity. And
[1:29:40] when it starts bearing for its fruit,
[1:29:42] you know it's an apple tree.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And I sit there as an arrest and I say,
[1:29:47] "You're an apple tree."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And then it struck me, I'm not telling
[1:29:53] that apple tree, it's an apple tree.
[1:29:54] Right?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling that elm sapling it's an
[1:29:58] elm sapling.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; That elm sapling's telling me
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; I'm an elm tree. That apple tree is
[1:30:05] telling me I'm an apple tree. Why?
[1:30:09] Because it's bearing forth its fruit.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; You want to tell me you're the bride?
[1:30:16] Bear the fruits of the word.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; You want to tell me you're going in a
[1:30:21] rapture? Bear the fruits of the message.
[1:30:24] You want to tell me your objective's
[1:30:26] glory?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Start living for glory.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Stop living for your paycheck.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Stop living for your boss and start
[1:30:37] living for Jesus.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; See, faith brings you into obedience.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; 177
[1:30:50] There is no fear in faith.
[1:30:53] Faith knows about it. Faith, as I've
[1:30:56] always said, it's got great big muscles
[1:30:57] and hair on a chest. Faith says shut up.
[1:31:01] Kids, that's the only time you can say
[1:31:03] shut up is when you're talking to the
[1:31:04] devil.
[1:31:06] At least I'll tell my own kids that. If
[1:31:08] I ever hear you saying shut up, like,
[1:31:10] well, my my girls are giving the devil a
[1:31:12] whooping.
[1:31:14] Better not be talking to heaven that
[1:31:15] way,
[1:31:17] right? We respect one another.
[1:31:20] If I hear shut up, I'll be like, "Hey,
[1:31:21] let me get in on that." It's a good old
[1:31:23] beatd down.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Shut up. Where's that devil at? I join
[1:31:27] my voice. Shut up, devil. You can't have
[1:31:30] my son. You got to have my children.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; You can't have my health.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Shut up and sit down.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on as we try to
[1:31:42] just move through this a little bit. He
[1:31:45] he goes on and says, "Mo, Moses didn't
[1:31:47] fear Pharaoh.
[1:31:49] He didn't care what Pharaoh had to say.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; I say that's where we need to get is
[1:31:55] where we don't care what this world has
[1:31:58] to say.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care what social media has to
[1:32:01] say. I don't care what the news has to
[1:32:03] say. I don't care what my co-workers
[1:32:05] have to say. The God of this evil age
[1:32:07] has to say. I don't care nothing about
[1:32:10] it
[1:32:13] because I am not wondering. I am not
[1:32:15] fearful. I'm not just, oh, am I gonna
[1:32:18] make it? Am I gonna get there? Let me
[1:32:20] let me uh let me see what so and so
[1:32:23] said. And oh, am I really being a good
[1:32:24] Christian? No, there's no fear.
[1:32:31] We know who we are.
[1:32:34] I just want to read this in Romans 8:35.
[1:32:38] We know who we are,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Whose report will you believe?
[1:32:47] I said, "Whose report will you believe?
[1:32:49] We shall believe the report of the Lord,
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; not the doctor's report, not Pharaoh's
[1:32:55] report."
[1:32:59] Paul says this in Romans 8:35. He says,
[1:33:01] "Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:33:03] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:33:06] persecution
[1:33:08] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[1:33:10] sword?
[1:33:12] as is as it is written, for thy sake we
[1:33:15] are killed all the day long. We are
[1:33:17] counted as sheep for the slaughter.
[1:33:20] Nay, in all
[1:33:23] these things,
[1:33:25] come on, put your voice together. He's
[1:33:27] talking about you.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care what comes. Famine,
[1:33:32] pestilence,
[1:33:33] heartbreak, lust, loved ones,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; the grave. I don't care. Nay, in all
[1:33:40] these things
[1:33:43] we are more.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody say more.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; In all these things we are more than
[1:33:54] conquerors through him that loved us.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Devil, you are too late.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I know who I am.
[1:34:08] I know my objective
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; and my objective is to whoop you. My
[1:34:14] objective is to cast you out.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; My objective is to take God at his word.
[1:34:20] My objective is glory. My objective is
[1:34:23] rapture.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; My objective is revelation.
[1:34:32] My objective is seeking and saving that
[1:34:35] which is lost.
[1:34:37] My objective is laying hands on the sick
[1:34:40] and they shall recover. My objective is
[1:34:43] to cast out evil spirits in the name of
[1:34:46] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Devil, you come too late
[1:34:51] to try to make me question
[1:34:54] who I am and where I am going.
[1:34:59] I like this now as we maybe we'll spend
[1:35:02] a little time here. He said Pharaoh
[1:35:03] tried to use his wisdom
[1:35:07] to make an agreement
[1:35:10] with Moses. Pharaoh tried to use his
[1:35:12] wisdom to make an agreement with Moses.
[1:35:17] See, see, once the plague started coming
[1:35:22] and once God started moving in your life
[1:35:24] a little bit, once you started getting a
[1:35:27] little victory and going to church and
[1:35:28] and you started reading your Bible and
[1:35:30] you started to get around the right
[1:35:32] people,
[1:35:35] Satan said, "I need to make a deal."
[1:35:39] They're starting to really believe the
[1:35:40] message of the hour. They're actually
[1:35:42] starting to believe God wants them to go
[1:35:45] to that mountain and worship.
[1:35:48] So, I need to come up with a plan.
[1:35:52] He said, "You know what? I'll let you
[1:35:54] have church.
[1:35:56] I I'll let God I I I move in your life.
[1:36:00] I'll let you go to church three times a
[1:36:03] week.
[1:36:04] Some of you can't even get that, so you
[1:36:06] go twice. Some of you can't do that, so
[1:36:08] you go once.
[1:36:11] I I I know I know who got the I know who
[1:36:13] got the better end of that deal.
[1:36:16] Satan offering a deal.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, you believe the message of the hour.
[1:36:24] You believe God sent a prophet. Why
[1:36:26] don't you go worship once a week?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; But then come right back to the mud pits
[1:36:32] in Egypt. Come back and slosh around in
[1:36:35] Lady Oia. Come back and work for your
[1:36:38] paycheck. Just call yourself a message
[1:36:41] believer.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Just go worship for a little while.
[1:36:48] Oh, let God speak to you a moment.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Those I love, I rebuke and chasen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And if you are without correction, you
[1:36:56] are a bastard born child. But I want to
[1:36:59] say I have a heavenly father who is
[1:37:01] interested in my objective. And if I
[1:37:04] ain't living right, he will correct me.
[1:37:06] He will spank me. He will whoop me. He
[1:37:09] will get me down and out where I say,
[1:37:11] "Oh, God, help me. I ain't living right,
[1:37:15] Lord. I believe. Help my unbelief.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Give me the power to take you at your
[1:37:22] word, Lord.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; I want to be in church. I want to serve
[1:37:27] you. I want to dress right.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Then don't make a deal with the devil.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "How many Pharaohs do
[1:37:39] we got in the land today?"
[1:37:42] How many pharaohs do we got in the
[1:37:44] pulpit today?
[1:37:46] Says the bride can only go so far. You
[1:37:49] can only have this much of God. God can
[1:37:52] only move this much in your life. You
[1:37:55] can only overcome this much. You'll
[1:37:57] never get total victory.
[1:38:00] I rebuke that devil. You can't have the
[1:38:03] promise God gave you. It's too late. I
[1:38:05] rebuke that devil. I cast you down.
[1:38:14] just
[1:38:15] just worship a little bit. He said
[1:38:19] paragraph 181, haven't we got that kind
[1:38:21] today? If you just join church, that's
[1:38:24] all right. But you know,
[1:38:29] the faith that Moses had
[1:38:33] didn't believe
[1:38:35] in a so far religion.
[1:38:40] I feel good
[1:38:43] because I got the same faith.
[1:38:49] Moses
[1:38:51] didn't believe in a so far religion.
[1:38:54] He said, "We're all going."
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; See, Satan tried to say, "Well,
[1:39:01] maybe you got the Holy Ghost, but you
[1:39:04] just go. I'm going to keep your family.
[1:39:09] Hey, I got names written down on this
[1:39:11] tablet of some of your loved ones,
[1:39:15] and the devil's trying to say, "You're
[1:39:16] going to make it, but your family."
[1:39:21] Oh, but Moses had a different faith.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Moses wasn't making no deal with the
[1:39:28] devil.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; No matter how much the devil said, "It's
[1:39:33] too late." He crossed the line. He said
[1:39:36] too much.
[1:39:39] Moses said,
[1:39:41] "We're all going.
[1:39:44] We're going all the way.
[1:39:47] We're going to the promised land. We
[1:39:50] just don't go out here and make a
[1:39:52] denomination and stop. We go on
[1:39:54] through." Amen. I am going to the
[1:39:58] promised land.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; God promised us.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; We do not have a so far religion.
[1:40:08] We're all going.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I said we're all going.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; You mean my boy? Yeah, you can take your
[1:40:18] boy.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; The devil can't have him.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; We're all going.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; No, just you. Just you. No. No. I don't
[1:40:28] have a so far religion. I don't have a
[1:40:32] halfway religion.
[1:40:34] I have the faith that Moses had. I have
[1:40:37] the faith that Abraham had. I have the
[1:40:39] faith of the word. I ain't going
[1:40:41] halfway. I'm going all the way. And
[1:40:44] we're all going. And I'm taking you with
[1:40:47] me. Let's go forward. Speak the word.
[1:40:50] Let's go forward, church.
[1:40:55] Ephesians 6:16 says, "Above all, taking
[1:40:59] the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall
[1:41:02] be able to quench all
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; the fiery darts of the wicked,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; and take the helmet of salvation, and
[1:41:10] the sword of the spirit, which is the
[1:41:13] word of God." Remember, faith sees what
[1:41:16] God wants.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; We're going all the way.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; We're all going. We don't have a so far
[1:41:22] religion. We cast down worry. We cast
[1:41:26] down doubt. We cast down fear.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants. It sees his
[1:41:30] will. We're going all the way. Just like
[1:41:33] in Revelations 19, it said, "Out of his
[1:41:34] mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword,
[1:41:36] right? Goeth a sharp sword." I say,
[1:41:39] "It's time the bride starts speaking."
[1:41:43] There ought to be a sharp sword going
[1:41:45] out of your mouth, casting down
[1:41:48] reasoning, casting down doubt,
[1:41:50] possessing the land, claiming your
[1:41:52] family.
[1:41:55] We'll work towards a close. Paragraph
[1:41:58] 189.
[1:42:01] Look, friends,
[1:42:04] faith sees
[1:42:07] what God wants.
[1:42:11] Faith sees his will.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; His will is that you are delivered.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; His will is that you are free.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; His will is that your family be saved.
[1:42:24] His will is that you have your faith.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; So then now faith will cast down
[1:42:30] anything contrary to that word.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Right? Are we looking at what God's
[1:42:40] will is for your life?
[1:42:42] All right, as we work towards a close,
[1:42:44] paragraph 189,
[1:42:47] my you just can hardly you hardly work,
[1:42:50] you know, one paragraph, one sentence
[1:42:52] you could preach eternity on. He says,
[1:42:54] "Notice how beautiful. I love this." You
[1:42:57] know, finally Pharaoh said, "Get out."
[1:43:06] God just plagued him with the voice of
[1:43:08] Moses.
[1:43:10] He struck everything. He done everything
[1:43:13] there was to be done. He put the sun
[1:43:16] down in the middle of the day. He done
[1:43:18] everything else. He blackened the days.
[1:43:20] He brought frogs, fleas, life,
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; everything else. Fire, smoke, and death
[1:43:27] to families, and everything else. He
[1:43:30] done everything till finally Pharaoh had
[1:43:33] to say,
[1:43:35] "Get out.
[1:43:37] Take all you got and go."
[1:43:40] Oh my. Praise be to God.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; I think it's time as he said God plagued
[1:43:50] Moses of God plagued Pharaoh with Moses
[1:43:53] with thus sayeth the Lord. I say it's
[1:43:56] time the bride of Jesus Christ starts
[1:43:58] plaguing the devil with thus sayaith the
[1:44:00] Lord.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I think it's time we start plaguing the
[1:44:03] devil and telling him look I am going in
[1:44:06] a rapture. I have an objective. It's
[1:44:09] time to plague him with the voice of
[1:44:11] Malachi 4:5. It is the rising of the
[1:44:14] sun. It is victory day. It wasn't so
[1:44:18] from the beginning. Who is this Melzdc?
[1:44:21] There's a man here that can turn on the
[1:44:23] light. It is Christ, the mystery of God
[1:44:25] revealed. I say it's time to start
[1:44:27] plaguing the devil with thus sayeth the
[1:44:30] Lord. I am going to be healed. I am
[1:44:32] going to be delivered. I am going to
[1:44:34] have that baby. I'm going to get my son.
[1:44:37] I'm going to get my daughter. I'm
[1:44:39] casting out worry. I'm casting out
[1:44:41] doubt. I'm claiming my family. I'm
[1:44:44] moving into my objective.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:53] Oh, praise his wonderful name.
[1:44:56] What does Mark 11:23 say?
[1:44:59] For verily I say unto you,
[1:45:02] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:45:04] mountain,
[1:45:06] Be thou removed
[1:45:08] and be thou cast in the sea, and shall
[1:45:10] not doubt in his heart, but shall
[1:45:12] believe that those things which he hath
[1:45:15] shall come to pass, he shall have
[1:45:18] whatsoever he saith.
[1:45:22] Brother Brandham said that puts you back
[1:45:24] in the word.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; He wants to use your voice.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we're too fearful to
[1:45:31] speak.
[1:45:33] What happens if it don't come to pass?
[1:45:35] Well, what happens if it don't come to
[1:45:36] pass? It just means it is you speaking
[1:45:38] and not God.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Try again.
[1:45:48] Don't be afraid of failure.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Don't let fear look. Hey, I I've tried
[1:45:54] to work up things. I've tried to
[1:45:56] manufacture things.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I wasn't doing it for the devil. I was
[1:46:06] doing it for God. But, you know, at
[1:46:08] least I was trying to do something for
[1:46:10] God.
[1:46:13] Some of us, we're so afraid
[1:46:16] to be identified with some fanatic that
[1:46:19] we won't even make an effort.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Well, my I better not say a word. I
[1:46:23] better not shout. I better not doubt.
[1:46:24] You know, God forbid I be called a
[1:46:26] Pentecostal. Are you kidding me? That's
[1:46:28] the scarecrow.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I thought they're the imitator.
[1:46:34] But nowadays, if they were imitating us,
[1:46:36] we look like a bump on a pickle.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Because we forgot our objective.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words. I
[1:46:46] don't know about you, but I don't want
[1:46:48] to stay here.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I don't like Lady Osia.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; I don't like the devils. I don't like
[1:46:54] the Tommy rot. I don't like the
[1:46:56] confusion. I don't like the darkness.
[1:46:58] But I love his word and I love his bride
[1:47:01] and I love feeding on the body word. Son
[1:47:03] of man, I love feeding on my objective.
[1:47:06] And my objective is body change. My
[1:47:08] objective is rapture. My objective is to
[1:47:11] cast down reason, cast down doubt. And
[1:47:13] one of these days, in a moment, in a
[1:47:16] twinkling of an eye, I'm going to be
[1:47:17] gone.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words.
[1:47:22] I'm going in a rapture.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; You're going in a rapture. You're going
[1:47:27] in a rapture. You're going in a rapture.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; You got the lead role.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; You got the lead part.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want to stay here.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; It's going all the time.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; You better start speaking.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; If you say you old bag of bones,
[1:47:54] yeah, you little old rascal Matthew
[1:47:56] McGary, you're defying the armies of the
[1:47:58] living God. Who me? Yeah, you.
[1:48:01] You're a little doubting and you're a
[1:48:02] little fussing.
[1:48:04] What? Yeah, you. Sometimes you got to
[1:48:07] have a real hard conversation with
[1:48:09] yourself.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; You're my worst enemy, you bag of bones.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; I know you don't feel like it, but we're
[1:48:15] going to serve God.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to church anyhow.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; I know I might lose my job, but I will
[1:48:21] be found in the house of God on a
[1:48:24] Wednesday night because I have an
[1:48:25] objective.
[1:48:27] Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Put God first. I challenge you in the
[1:48:31] name of the Lord. Take God out his word.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; God will be in debt to no man.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Oh Lord, we've forsaken all
[1:48:46] and followed you.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; You think if you sacrifice your job to
[1:48:51] go to church that God is going to be in
[1:48:54] debt to you?
[1:48:58] He's blessed me a million times over.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; I drove an hour and a half, three hours
[1:49:05] round trip
[1:49:07] every Wednesday and every Sunday for
[1:49:10] three years because there was something
[1:49:13] pulsating in me. Give me the word.
[1:49:20] And
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; one time I got a blowout
[1:49:23] and then my spare blew out.
[1:49:27] I still made it there with about 10 15
[1:49:31] minutes left of preaching. But there was
[1:49:33] a faith in my heart that said,
[1:49:35] "Everybody else move over
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; cuz this 15 minutes is for me."
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I say if we start coming to the house of
[1:49:44] God with that kind of expectation,
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; God will be in debt to no man. You won't
[1:49:50] lose your job and faith and God write
[1:49:52] you an I owe you.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Brother David,
[1:49:57] appreciate you losing your job, man. I'm
[1:49:59] going to I have to catch you on the next
[1:50:01] one.
[1:50:03] It's like one time I was driving there
[1:50:04] on the road and I left this thing and I
[1:50:06] left that thing and I left another thing
[1:50:08] and and I finally got frustrated and I
[1:50:11] said out loud, "Give me a break." But
[1:50:15] you know, I forgot who was riding with
[1:50:17] me in the car. And the Lord said,
[1:50:19] "Haven't I already
[1:50:24] said,"Lord, I'm sorry. I'll be glad to
[1:50:26] turn around and go get my wallet that I
[1:50:28] left three times in a row and got
[1:50:29] something else. Give me a break. Haven't
[1:50:32] already." I saw my life and rewind. All
[1:50:34] the times he bailed me out. All of his
[1:50:36] mercy, all of his grace. Oh, he took me
[1:50:39] all the way back to Calvary where he
[1:50:41] nailed every thought, every sin,
[1:50:44] everything I ever done. He said, "It's
[1:50:46] paid. It's finished. It's thrown in the
[1:50:49] sea of God's forgetfulness." And you're
[1:50:50] asking me to give you a break. I've
[1:50:52] given you the greatest break humanity
[1:50:54] could ever have. I said, "You're free.
[1:50:57] You never did it in the first place. You
[1:50:59] are justified."
[1:51:04] And then we we think that sacrificing
[1:51:07] something for God, we're he's going to
[1:51:09] be indebted to us.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; You really want to start seeing the
[1:51:12] spirit of God move in your life? Start
[1:51:14] putting his word first.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Start putting his word in the way you
[1:51:18] dress. Start putting his word in the way
[1:51:20] you go to church. We we will we will
[1:51:22] have a real moving of the spirit where
[1:51:23] people are born again and filled with
[1:51:25] the Holy Ghost. Not just a one-time
[1:51:27] experience, but where you've met the
[1:51:28] Logos.
[1:51:30] And now you're like Moses with a stick
[1:51:33] in your hand going down to Egypt. Let my
[1:51:37] people go.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; There was nothing that can defeat Moses.
[1:51:43] And there's nothing that can defeat the
[1:51:45] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Mark 16:17.
[1:51:54] And these shines
[1:51:56] shall follow them that believe.
[1:52:02] In my name they shall cast out devils.
[1:52:04] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:52:07] shall take up serpents.
[1:52:09] And if they drink any deadly thing, it
[1:52:12] shall not hurt them.
[1:52:15] They shall lay hands on the sick
[1:52:19] and they shall recover.
[1:52:23] That is not the words of a man.
[1:52:27] That is thus saith the Lord.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; And if God anoints your faith and you
[1:52:33] are sick, I believe by a divine promise
[1:52:36] and a divine commission by almighty God
[1:52:38] that I can lay hands on you and you
[1:52:40] shall recover.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Moses had had enough. I mean, apologize.
[1:52:51] Pharaoh had had enough,
[1:52:55] man. Moses, you are a fanatic.
[1:53:00] You ever been called a fanatic?
[1:53:04] Moses,
[1:53:05] I'm tired of you glorifying God. I'm
[1:53:08] tired of you speaking, thus sayeth the
[1:53:10] Lord. I'm tired of you quoting Malachi
[1:53:13] 4:5 every day.
[1:53:16] I'm tired of you listening to tapes
[1:53:19] almost every day.
[1:53:21] I'm tired of you possessing your vessel
[1:53:24] in sanctification and honor. I can't
[1:53:27] even get a word in because you keep
[1:53:29] speaking the word.
[1:53:33] Now we're talking about a real
[1:53:35] overcomer. Shut up, devil.
[1:53:38] I ain't got time because I'm listening
[1:53:41] to my bridegroom.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; You ever You ever have your kids come in
[1:53:46] and they're trying to tell you
[1:53:47] something? You're like, I'm talking
[1:53:50] here. They're trying to interrupt you.
[1:53:52] You're like, hey, I'm having a
[1:53:53] conversation here. Well, if it's your
[1:53:55] kid, you know, depends on if it's
[1:53:58] something important. But sometimes the
[1:54:00] devil's just trying to interrupt an
[1:54:01] important conversation that you're
[1:54:04] having with the Lord.
[1:54:06] And sometimes we say, "Lord, hold on a
[1:54:08] minute." Yeah, devil. Wow. Well, you
[1:54:11] know, the other day, uh, you looked at
[1:54:13] this and you looked at that, you know,
[1:54:14] and and Brother Brandham said this over
[1:54:16] here and and so, you know, you really
[1:54:18] don't got the Holy Ghost. Really? Yeah.
[1:54:20] And, uh, God, hold on. Um, the serpent's
[1:54:24] talking and I need to find out what he
[1:54:26] has to say because I need to make a
[1:54:28] decision that if what you said is true
[1:54:32] and what he said is true, and I need to
[1:54:34] determine
[1:54:36] if I'm good enough. I need to determine
[1:54:39] if I can go all the way.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; It was never about what you determined.
[1:54:44] God already predetermined the outcome
[1:54:47] before he spoke one star into existence.
[1:54:50] He said, "You're going all the way.
[1:54:52] You're taking your family with you."
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have a halfway
[1:54:58] religion."
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're going all the way." And
[1:55:01] we're all going. Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh finally said, "Get out of here."
[1:55:09] The prophet of God said this in
[1:55:11] paragraph
[1:55:13] 19. He said, "I'm so glad
[1:55:16] that a man can so completely serve God
[1:55:19] till the devil don't know what to do
[1:55:21] with him." That's right. Just obey God
[1:55:25] so completely till the devil says, "Oh
[1:55:27] my, get away. I don't want to hear it no
[1:55:30] more. I say this bride ought to raise up
[1:55:33] right now and start speaking the word.
[1:55:36] Speak and go forward that that devil
[1:55:38] say, "Oh my goodness, I don't want to
[1:55:40] hear anymore. I can't take it." You say,
[1:55:43] "I am an overcomer. I am victorious. I
[1:55:46] can do all things through Jesus Christ
[1:55:48] that strengthens me." Greater is he that
[1:55:50] is in me than he that is in the world.
[1:55:52] What can separate us from the love of
[1:55:54] God? shall famine, shall peril, shall
[1:55:57] sword, shall death. What can we say?
[1:56:00] Nay, in all these things, and the
[1:56:03] devil's over there going, "Get away. I
[1:56:06] don't want to hear it anymore." I say,
[1:56:08] "Maybe that's how the rapture is going
[1:56:09] to go when we start speaking the word of
[1:56:12] God and start claiming God and taking
[1:56:14] him out his word."
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:25] Oh, hallelujah. Praise his wonderful
[1:56:27] name.
[1:56:31] Why cry?
[1:56:34] We haven't even gotten to why cry yet.
[1:56:39] Maybe we'll just lay a little in there
[1:56:40] so brother Billy can just pick up on it.
[1:56:45] Don't you love the spirit of the Lord?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Why cry? Speak the word.
[1:56:52] I am going all the way.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; I am going in the rapture.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; I do have an objective.
[1:57:02] Brother Brandham said, "Everywhere those
[1:57:04] early believers went, they went
[1:57:05] preaching the gospel. They went
[1:57:06] preaching the word and God confirmed it
[1:57:09] with signs and wonders following. They
[1:57:13] cast out evil spirits. They cast out
[1:57:14] devils." He said, "And that power is
[1:57:17] here greater and stronger than it ever
[1:57:18] was in the true word bride.
[1:57:22] Oh, hallelujah. He said, "Hold on to
[1:57:23] that word and fill your mouth with it.
[1:57:28] Fill your mouth with it." Remember,
[1:57:30] faith sees. Look, we'll just be about
[1:57:31] five more minutes. Faith sees what God
[1:57:34] wants. It holds to the objective. Faith
[1:57:38] knows no fear. Faith knows no defeat.
[1:57:41] Faith brings things where there's
[1:57:43] nothing to be brought. I love that
[1:57:45] quote.
[1:57:47] Faith brings things where there's
[1:57:48] nothing to be brought. That means in the
[1:57:51] in and where where where there is no
[1:57:54] possibility, God makes it possible.
[1:58:00] And in this message, Brother Brandham is
[1:58:02] showing how in everything we've been
[1:58:04] fellowshipping on,
[1:58:07] how Moses had been called and he had
[1:58:10] been elected and he had been chosen and
[1:58:12] he met the pillar of fire and now God
[1:58:14] commissioned him,
[1:58:17] right?
[1:58:18] And now he's proved by signs and wonders
[1:58:22] and vindication
[1:58:24] and has brought them out of Egypt by a
[1:58:28] strong and mighty hand.
[1:58:31] And now they come to the Red Sea
[1:58:36] and he says, "And Moses starts crying,
[1:58:39] what must I do?"
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And now what he's starting to do is show
[1:58:46] us. He says, "Even me." He's showing us
[1:58:49] with all the signs and all the
[1:58:51] vindication this great message that
[1:58:53] we've received. We've come out by a
[1:58:55] mighty hand out of Lady Osia. We've come
[1:58:57] out of denominations. We've seen the
[1:58:59] pillar of fire. He's had his picture
[1:59:01] taken. He He opened the seals. And what
[1:59:04] was in those seals? There were names in
[1:59:06] there. And he called your name and he
[1:59:09] showed you who you are and he said, "I
[1:59:12] got an objective for you. It's body
[1:59:14] change. We're going in a rapture." And
[1:59:16] then we come up to a little trial.
[1:59:19] Oh Lord,
[1:59:21] what am I going to do?
[1:59:25] Are you hearing the prophet?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; That's he's he's showing us that's how
[1:59:30] we become
[1:59:33] with all the evidence, with all the
[1:59:35] signs, with all the revelation.
[1:59:39] Then when the little trial comes up, we
[1:59:41] start to cry. when the Red Sea should
[1:59:44] have just been chocked up. Like, man, I
[1:59:46] don't know how he's going to do it, but
[1:59:47] this is going to be awesome.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Like, he brought us out of the strongest
[1:59:52] army that was ever in the land.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; And now there's a puddle of water in
[1:59:58] front of us. Lord, how you going to do
[2:00:00] it? Well, I've ordained you.
[2:00:04] I've called you. I've elected you.
[2:00:07] You're in the line of duty. There it is
[2:00:09] right there. Uh, we'll try to settle
[2:00:11] around these lines.
[2:00:14] Saints, we got to be in the line of
[2:00:16] duty.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Your line of duty is rapture.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Remember, that's the objective. We're
[2:00:23] going all the way. So then if something
[2:00:25] gets in the way of your line of duty,
[2:00:29] you can speak the word and go forward.
[2:00:34] And he starts to show how Moses started
[2:00:37] to cry out to God and he was looking for
[2:00:41] something that had already been given to
[2:00:44] him.
[2:00:46] God had already told him the Egyptians
[2:00:48] today you will see them no longer. God
[2:00:51] had already given him thus sayeth the
[2:00:54] Lord. And he's over crying and wondering
[2:00:57] what must he do? I say, "Is the prophet
[2:00:59] not trying to tell us the bride of Jesus
[2:01:02] Christ? I've already given you thus
[2:01:05] sayeth the Lord. I've already showed you
[2:01:08] that you're going in a rapture. I
[2:01:10] already showed you where you were in my
[2:01:11] mind before the foundation of the world.
[2:01:13] I've already showed you that I slipped
[2:01:15] the wedding band of predestination on
[2:01:17] you." I I tell you, you you have to
[2:01:19] listen all the way to 65 and come back
[2:01:20] and listen to this so you can even begin
[2:01:22] to start to understand it.
[2:01:24] He said, "Haven't I done all these
[2:01:26] things?" and you're crying and
[2:01:28] wondering.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go forward to the objective.
[2:01:37] Now, maybe we'll end on this quote.
[2:01:40] He says, "Oh my, I got to fellowship
[2:01:43] with brother Billy." I'll let him pick
[2:01:45] it up. But, but uh Brother Brandham says
[2:01:48] uh I I like this. We are just having a
[2:01:49] good time back there cuz uh brother
[2:01:52] brother Brandham says that God said to
[2:01:54] Moses, "Moses,
[2:01:56] I've already put you on the journey. I'm
[2:01:58] going to go rest."
[2:02:01] And I was thinking, I'm like, that was
[2:02:02] just like it was in the beginning. God
[2:02:04] formed his masterpiece. And now he had
[2:02:07] his masterpiece family on the earth and
[2:02:10] he said, "I'm going to go rest Adam.
[2:02:12] It's in your hands."
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Because why? What is he showing us here?
[2:02:17] God has brought us out. He set us on the
[2:02:20] journey. This is the hour of adoption.
[2:02:23] This is the hour of manifestation of
[2:02:25] sons and daughters of God with full
[2:02:28] authority and power and dominion over
[2:02:31] the earth again. Why can I say that?
[2:02:33] Because I already saw a sheath wave
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; stand on the earth and tell the storm to
[2:02:41] go back to where it came from.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; That's where he ends up. He's saying it
[2:02:46] was he in me
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; speaking squirrels
[2:02:51] bringing the dead off the floor.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; He's showing that's where we are now.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Friends, now is your adoption. It's not
[2:03:03] something that has to come in the
[2:03:06] future.
[2:03:11] Stop looking for something to come and
[2:03:16] recognize what's already here.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; He's here
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; to take you into every promise.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Well, how am I going to do it? As you
[2:03:29] come to it,
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; if this is the hour of adoption, it's
[2:03:34] time to be adopted.
[2:03:37] Well, brother Matthew, I thought I
[2:03:39] thought that that was the change of our
[2:03:40] That's the final of it.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; But you got to get adopted before that
[2:03:44] happens.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; You see, we're always trying to put
[2:03:48] something off in the future.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; But he's saying, Moses, I got I'm going
[2:03:53] to go rest.
[2:03:55] You take You know what my mind is? You
[2:03:59] know where I told you where you're
[2:04:00] going. Are you hearing them? He's
[2:04:03] telling you, "I've already given you my
[2:04:06] mind. I've already given you my word.
[2:04:09] You are my adopted sons and daughters of
[2:04:11] God. You are my bride. You are bone of
[2:04:14] my bone." You just speak the word and go
[2:04:16] forward.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Quit fussing and crying.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, should I have this? Lord, should I
[2:04:27] quit my job so I can go to church on
[2:04:28] Wednesday?
[2:04:30] There ain't no fear in faith. Cuz
[2:04:34] if it's genuine faith,
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; you won't even have to think twice about
[2:04:39] it.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Look, I ain't telling you to quit your
[2:04:42] job. Because you know what you're going
[2:04:45] to do if you quit your job without
[2:04:46] faith? You're going to be jobless with
[2:04:47] no faith.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; That's not a good place to be.
[2:04:57] But if you got faith,
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; my God will not be indebted to no man.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But we're scared of Pharaoh.
[2:05:12] We're scared of Lady Oia.
[2:05:15] We're scared of losing our house. We're
[2:05:17] scared of losing our car. It's all going
[2:05:20] to burn anyways.
[2:05:24] That's not your objective.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Your objective is glory.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Your objective
[2:05:35] is rapture.
[2:05:37] Here comes Pharaoh. What must I do? What
[2:05:40] must I do? See, isn't that just human
[2:05:42] beings begin to cry? What must I do?
[2:05:44] Here we see Moses expressing fully human
[2:05:46] nature. Always wants God to get behind
[2:05:49] you and push you into something. Lord,
[2:05:51] should I do this? Should I do that,
[2:05:54] Lord? Give me a sign,
[2:05:56] Lord. Should I be in church on
[2:05:58] Wednesday? Close the door. Are you
[2:05:59] kidding me?
[2:06:01] I'm sorry. That's just where little
[2:06:02] Matthew McI can relate. I I you know, I
[2:06:05] I those things are like I needed simple
[2:06:08] things like, "Okay, Lord. Yes, I can't.
[2:06:10] I I'll I'll take you at your word."
[2:06:16] Now, that's us today. You want God after
[2:06:18] all we've seen, yet you want God to push
[2:06:21] you to do something.
[2:06:24] See, yeah, Moses had just laxed around.
[2:06:28] Well, if Moses could lax around a little
[2:06:30] bit,
[2:06:32] Lord, forgive me. I've laxed around.
[2:06:36] I've gotten lazy. I've gotten soft.
[2:06:40] The pews maybe are too soft. The church
[2:06:43] is too wide and it's too cool and it's
[2:06:47] too nice
[2:06:48] that I just show up and say, "Bless me.
[2:06:52] I ain't got to fight for nothing. I just
[2:06:55] want Brother Billy to push me into
[2:06:56] worship. I want Brother David to push me
[2:06:58] into a good sermon and push me out the
[2:07:01] door and push me back to my job and then
[2:07:03] the choils of my job push me back in
[2:07:05] church and I'm just on a good old push
[2:07:07] around."
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; That ain't an adopted son of God.
[2:07:14] That ain't a man knowing his position.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; He said Moses just latched around
[2:07:22] God. I'll ask you see what you say.
[2:07:24] Yeah. But here God had ordained him for
[2:07:27] the job.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Proved that he was with him. Now put
[2:07:31] your name in here.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me read it like this if you'll
[2:07:34] just allow me. God has ordained you for
[2:07:38] the job.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Proved that he is with you.
[2:07:42] and here he is and this circumstance has
[2:07:45] come up in your life and you're crying
[2:07:47] about it. What can I do? Lord, what can
[2:07:49] I do?
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; And many times that's exactly what we're
[2:07:52] doing. We're looking for an answer or
[2:07:55] looking for something that God has
[2:07:56] already given us.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Remember, faith sees
[2:08:04] what God wants.
[2:08:07] The scripture says, "If ye then be risen
[2:08:10] with Christ, seek those things which are
[2:08:12] above.
[2:08:14] Where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[2:08:16] God, set your affections on things
[2:08:18] above, not on things of earth, your
[2:08:22] affection singular,
[2:08:24] not your affections."
[2:08:27] Your affection singular. Set your mind.
[2:08:30] Let this mind be in you which was also
[2:08:32] in Christ Jesus. Now, I keep saying
[2:08:35] this, but we'll just At least the
[2:08:37] musicians aren't sitting there. So, I'
[2:08:39] I've I've improved.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hallelujah.
[2:08:46] But remember, he said Moses already
[2:08:50] prophesied the Egyptians you see today,
[2:08:53] you will see them no more. And he says,
[2:08:54] and immediately he begins crying.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture, Brother Billy.
[2:09:00] Our objective is glory. Hallelujah.
[2:09:04] We're all going, "Praise God.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; I'm sick. Oh, my my job's shutting down.
[2:09:14] Oh, my family members. You mean I can't
[2:09:17] have that girl that I I loved? You mean
[2:09:21] Oh, you you mean I the Lord's dealing
[2:09:23] with my heart and I I got to move and uh
[2:09:26] Well, what am I going to do?
[2:09:30] Are you kidding me? I thought you just
[2:09:33] Did you forget? And that's exactly what
[2:09:35] God, brother Brandham said, Moses did.
[2:09:37] Moses forgot.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just need to be
[2:09:40] reminded.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; He said he immediately began to cry,
[2:09:43] Lord, what can I do? And brother Brandon
[2:09:46] said, God must have just got fed up with
[2:09:48] it.
[2:09:50] He said, God must have just finally got
[2:09:52] fed up. Why do you keep crying to me?
[2:09:55] Why do you keep coming to me, Lord? What
[2:09:57] must I do? Should I do this and should I
[2:09:59] do that? He said, he said he finally
[2:10:01] just got fed up. up. He said, "What are
[2:10:03] you crying to me about? Haven't I
[2:10:05] already identified that I'm among you?
[2:10:08] Haven't I already proved to you that I'm
[2:10:10] with you?" And he said in paragraph
[2:10:13] 2:30, he says, "What are you crying to
[2:10:15] me about? What are you looking at me
[2:10:17] for? What are you calling I be? Haven't
[2:10:19] I proved it to the people? Haven't I
[2:10:21] proved it to you? Haven't I called you?
[2:10:23] Isn't it the scripture? Didn't I promise
[2:10:25] to take this people to that land? Didn't
[2:10:28] I call you and tell you I would do it?
[2:10:33] Didn't I call and say I had sent you to
[2:10:36] do it?
[2:10:37] Put yourself in there. That it wasn't
[2:10:40] you.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; It was me.
[2:10:47] And I'd go down and be with your lips
[2:10:55] and whatever you said, I'd vindicate it
[2:10:57] and prove it. Haven't I done it? the
[2:11:01] musicians would come.
[2:11:03] Haven't I done it? Haven't I called you
[2:11:06] out of Lady Osia?
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Have I not shown you that I wrote your
[2:11:11] name in the lamb's book of life before
[2:11:12] the foundation of the world? Haven't I
[2:11:15] shown you that I nailed every sin and
[2:11:17] every fault and every failure to the
[2:11:19] cross and I put it in the sea of God's
[2:11:21] forgetfulness? I was wondering if we
[2:11:23] could we could sing that song. Um let me
[2:11:26] just see here real quick. I wanted to
[2:11:28] sing that song. Uh
[2:11:32] uh we believe I I believe we've sang
[2:11:35] that before. Uh they say this mountain
[2:11:37] can't be moved. We familiar with that?
[2:11:41] Maybe as we move into that, Billy, you
[2:11:42] can help me with that. But haven't I
[2:11:44] done it? I'm Let me just make it
[2:11:48] personal. Brother Ben, has he not done
[2:11:50] it? Has he not showed you that your
[2:11:53] name's on the Lamb Book of Life?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Has he not shown you you're going in a
[2:11:56] rapture? Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Then what are you crying to me for?
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Has God not already told you you're
[2:12:02] going in a rapture?
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Has he not already showed you you're
[2:12:05] going in a body change? What are you
[2:12:07] crying to me about it?
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; You're the elected, ordained bride of
[2:12:11] Jesus Christ.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go forward into the objective.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then when any little thing
[2:12:22] comes up,
[2:12:24] we act like a baby." when you ought to
[2:12:27] be a man.
[2:12:29] Speak to the people. Amen. Then move
[2:12:31] forward. There you are. Don't cry.
[2:12:34] Speak.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; What are you crying to me about? Just
[2:12:38] speak the word.
[2:12:42] Just speak to the people and go forward
[2:12:44] to your objective. Whatever it is, if
[2:12:48] it's sickness or whatever it is to raise
[2:12:51] the dead or whatever it is,
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; speak. I've proved it. Speak to the
[2:12:58] people. What a lesson. What a lesson. Oh
[2:13:00] my. At this stage of the journey, where
[2:13:03] we are standing, look where we are at
[2:13:06] now. Yes, sir. At the third pool.
[2:13:11] Oh, can you feel the pool of the
[2:13:12] rapture?
[2:13:16] We're right here at the door of the
[2:13:17] coming of the Lord. He was anointed for
[2:13:20] the job
[2:13:22] and still waiting for thus sayeth the
[2:13:25] Lord.
[2:13:27] And I find what the prophet is telling
[2:13:29] me. Son,
[2:13:32] I've anointed you for the job.
[2:13:35] I've called you. I have elected you. I
[2:13:39] have equipped you. I have filled you.
[2:13:42] You don't have to cry to me and wonder,
[2:13:45] can I have my health? Can I have this?
[2:13:47] or or or can I have my family? Can can
[2:13:50] can I uh put the word first?
[2:13:53] No.
[2:13:55] That's my objective.
[2:13:57] Now, the question is, are we going to
[2:13:59] take God at his word and make his word
[2:14:03] our objective?
[2:14:05] Because I wonder if what we've actually
[2:14:07] had happen is Lady Oia we've allowed to
[2:14:11] become distracted to where God by divine
[2:14:15] promise has given us a message and shown
[2:14:18] us our objective where we come from
[2:14:21] where we're going and has given us his
[2:14:23] mind. But yet then Satan tries to come
[2:14:26] in and offer some reasoning and offer a
[2:14:29] little different objective. And then
[2:14:31] that's where the confusion comes in.
[2:14:33] Let's all stand.
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:14:39] 239. Speak to the people
[2:14:43] and let's go forward. Amen. We've got an
[2:14:46] objective.
[2:14:48] That's glory.
[2:14:50] Let's move into it. We're headed to the
[2:14:53] promised land.
[2:14:55] All things
[2:14:58] are possible
[2:15:00] to them that believe.
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:06] Hallelujah.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; All things
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; are possible.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; I believe I am standing
[2:15:18] in front of the spoken word of almighty
[2:15:21] God.
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:25] I believe the mighty angel of
[2:15:27] Revelations 10 1-7
[2:15:31] has descended with a shout.
[2:15:36] And by the spoken word of God,
[2:15:40] you have come into manifestation
[2:15:43] and are that invincible army
[2:15:47] standing on the earth
[2:15:50] right now.
[2:15:54] Now, if we are who he said we are,
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Well, how are we going to do it, Matt?
[2:16:04] Brother Matt,
[2:16:06] h how am I going to overcome? How am I
[2:16:09] going to be healed? How am I going to go
[2:16:11] in a rapture?
[2:16:13] as you come to it.
[2:16:16] Look, if if you're sick and you have a
[2:16:18] need, if you need to be delivered, we
[2:16:22] can pray for you. And I believe in the
[2:16:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you'll be
[2:16:25] healed and you will be delivered
[2:16:28] because by faith,
[2:16:30] I'm looking at the objective
[2:16:35] that that's the part you you see,
[2:16:39] brothers, that's the part God's giving
[2:16:41] you to play.
[2:16:44] that we could lay hands, sisters, that's
[2:16:46] the part you've been given to play, to
[2:16:49] lay hands on the sick and they recover,
[2:16:53] to cast down reason, to cast out
[2:16:55] unbelief.
[2:16:57] So I say as as the word has gone forth,
[2:17:02] let's speak the word.
[2:17:04] Let's have faith in the objective.
[2:17:10] Let's have
[2:17:12] faith. Brother Brandham goes on. Oh, you
[2:17:15] can start going on into Samson. He says
[2:17:17] he used his anointed gift of faith. He
[2:17:20] talks about David. He said David had
[2:17:22] faith in his anointing.
[2:17:27] Sometimes we just forget.
[2:17:30] But I say this ought to be a time of
[2:17:31] remembrance. Oh yes, Lord. What? I have
[2:17:35] been crying, brother Billy. I've been
[2:17:38] over here crying and wondering when
[2:17:40] God's already given me a vindicated
[2:17:42] message to tell me to speak the word and
[2:17:44] go forward. I say, "Let's see some
[2:17:46] mighty miracles this morning." As we
[2:17:49] just sing this song in worship, if you
[2:17:51] need prayer, we'd be happy to pray with
