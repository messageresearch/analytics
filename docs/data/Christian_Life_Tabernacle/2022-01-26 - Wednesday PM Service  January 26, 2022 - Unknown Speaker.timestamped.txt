[18:39] lord liberated from organized
[18:42] religion lord

[18:47] spirit lord
[18:48] we pray god tonight lord as we've come
[18:51] together
[18:53] lord
[18:55] no doubt we didn't come to see a man
[18:57] lord we didn't come
[18:59] necessarily to see one another lord but
[19:01] we know that
[19:02] you said wherever two or three are
[19:04] gathered in my name
[19:06] i'll be in their midst
[19:08] father that's our consolation that's our
[19:10] comfort
[19:11] so we pray that you would have
[19:13] three minutes in this service lord
[19:15] lord will you speak to hearts lord
[19:17] change lives
[19:19] lord if those
[19:21] are longing for the baptism of the holy
[19:23] ghost lord we pray there be nothing that
[19:26] would hinder that being satisfied
[19:28] tonight lord you're the god that heals
[19:31] lord we pray you'd heal tonight lord
[19:34] and it's all by your word lord so as we
[19:36] commit ourselves to you oh god we pray
[19:39] father that you'd be glorified lord no
[19:41] doubt the songs the praise have already
[19:44] been sung lord so now come we ask that
[19:47] you would grant to us revelation lord we
[19:50] speak to each heart in jesus christ's
[19:52] name we pray amen
[20:00] praise the lord
[20:02] thank you musicians
[20:06] man if you have your bibles we'll go and
[20:08] do the word of god
[20:11] amen
[20:22] praise the lord
[20:24] i was at the job today for a brief time
[20:27] and
[20:29] someone
[20:30] the homeowner was saying
[20:32] something that struck me and
[20:34] my goodness the world has become so
[20:36] polluted with their own understanding
[20:39] and their own ways
[20:41] it's just striking how people
[20:45] they have to have it their way it's like
[20:47] almost like
[20:48] life is like burger king have it your
[20:50] way but you know what
[20:53] it just struck me how privileged we are
[20:55] that that we have a different spirit
[20:58] you know that we we could come under the
[21:01] headship and the leadership of the
[21:03] spirit of the living god and god can
[21:06] lead us
[21:07] i'm so grateful that aren't you tonight
[21:09] amen and he said something that just
[21:12] struck me he said you know i don't i
[21:13] don't go to church and i don't read my
[21:15] bible and i don't pray unless god
[21:18] actually
[21:19] compels me and moves me and i thought
[21:22] that was good in one way but a lot of
[21:24] times you don't realize how god's going
[21:27] to deal with you after you go to church
[21:29] after you pray and after you read your
[21:31] bible so i don't want to limit god in in
[21:34] what he can and can't do amen so if you
[21:37] have a need let's lay everything else to
[21:39] the side and let's let god speak amen
[21:42] just was thinking you know it's just
[21:45] been a wonderful treat for me personally
[21:48] i've been really ministered here of late
[21:50] and you know i just feel like it's a
[21:52] it's a time of manifestation and and
[21:55] something i wanted to share from my
[21:56] heart just how you know
[21:59] there's something within us there's a
[22:00] there's a there's a satisfying something
[22:03] that is it's it's crying out for
[22:06] fulfillment amen there's a seed of god
[22:09] inside that's crying out for fulfillment
[22:12] and and there's only one thing that that
[22:14] really can quicken that and that's the
[22:16] spirit of god amen
[22:18] and so i just want to speak to you
[22:20] tonight if the lord would permit us is
[22:23] there's a groaning for manifestation
[22:26] amen and if we just go into the word of
[22:28] god in philippians chapter 1.
[22:34] philippians chapter 1
[22:36] and we'll read
[22:38] verse 6
[22:40] through 21.
[22:50] just as a reminder we have a youth
[22:51] meeting this friday from six to nine for
[22:54] those of you that can make it
[22:57] we would like to see you then
[23:00] philippians chapter one and verse six it
[23:03] says being confident of this very thing
[23:06] that he
[23:07] which have begun a good work in you will
[23:09] perform it until the day
[23:11] of christ jesus jesus christ
[23:14] even as it is me for me to
[23:17] think this of you all because i have you
[23:20] in my heart and so much as
[23:23] both in my bonds and in the defense and
[23:25] confirmation of the gospel all year
[23:28] partakers of my grace you know i just
[23:30] started thinking about you know the
[23:31] testimony that paul he's now
[23:34] you know he he's he's experiencing
[23:37] something
[23:38] and and you know paul had a hard road
[23:40] you know
[23:42] and he was going to suffer many things
[23:44] for
[23:44] his namesake amen
[23:46] i just think about how that sometimes in
[23:49] life there's tensions and there's
[23:51] distress but that actually works for a
[23:54] greater weight and glory look at what
[23:57] happened with paul and how
[23:58] i mean we're actually being strengthened
[24:01] by the things that he suffered and what
[24:02] was poured out a life of christ
[24:05] and that's the same thing with you and i
[24:07] hey man so the the trials and the
[24:10] struggles they're not in vain amen
[24:13] he says for god is my record how greatly
[24:16] i have longed for you in all the bowels
[24:18] of jesus christ and this i pray that
[24:21] your love may abound more and more
[24:25] in the knowledge and in all judgment
[24:28] that ye may approve things that are
[24:30] excellent that ye may be in sincere and
[24:33] without offense
[24:35] till the day
[24:36] of christ amen you may have your seeds
[24:42] amen what a prayer
[24:44] amen i believe in in the prophet's
[24:46] prayer and and you know i think
[24:48] you know it's it's one of those things
[24:50] god works on both ends of the line you
[24:52] know he's praying and then there's got
[24:53] to be something to respond
[24:55] and and you know i just
[24:58] we'll read that
[25:00] through 21 he says
[25:03] being filled with the fruits of
[25:06] righteousness
[25:07] which are by jesus christ unto the glory
[25:11] and praise of god
[25:13] but i would ye should understand
[25:15] brethren that the things
[25:18] which happen unto me hath fallen out
[25:21] rather unto the furtherance of the
[25:24] gospel
[25:25] so that my bonds in christ are
[25:28] manifested in all the palace and all the
[25:31] other places
[25:32] and many of the brethren and the lord
[25:34] wax confident by my bonds
[25:37] are much more bold to speak the word
[25:40] without fear amen that's what happens is
[25:43] when you go through something and you
[25:45] you claim the word of god and god brings
[25:47] it to pass you realize that you now
[25:50] become more confident to speak the word
[25:52] of god amen so if that's that's one of
[25:55] the goals in our christian walk is to be
[25:58] able to recognize the tensions the
[26:00] struggles the stresses is that we could
[26:02] take god's promise and watch him
[26:05] materialize it amen there's something
[26:07] that's crying out for that manifestation
[26:10] and you know we don't want to just
[26:12] continue on just being like babes we
[26:14] want to start growing into the place
[26:16] where we recognize like i so appreciate
[26:19] brother randy that i was going to read
[26:21] something that he had said and and uh my
[26:23] goodness you know he said something in
[26:26] his sermon that i'm like that's that's
[26:28] it you know we want to recognize the
[26:30] road we're on and god is reproducing
[26:33] himself in a people amen it was the the
[26:36] word expressed and and now they take
[26:39] take the promises of god and and they
[26:41] apply it in life and now it sparks off a
[26:44] light amen
[26:46] my goodness
[26:49] uh something else and this is just kind
[26:51] of
[26:52] bringing the picture of you know
[26:56] brother billy mentioned this and and it
[26:58] struck me and i wrote it in my notes i
[27:01] thought
[27:01] you know
[27:03] he said
[27:09] he said the truth out of the mouth
[27:12] of god
[27:14] is a righteous judgment
[27:16] and and i tell you that really that
[27:18] really reverberates because in this in
[27:20] this age where people are just once
[27:23] again anointed to do whatever is right
[27:25] in their own sight amen but now the word
[27:28] of god is the very righteous judgment
[27:31] and
[27:32] it came out of the mouth of god and and
[27:34] we're his spokesmen so the very word of
[27:37] god is a righteous judgment and i just
[27:39] think
[27:40] um
[27:42] and then
[27:44] also
[27:45] these are all things that kind of were
[27:47] stirring on my heart
[27:48] it's starting to develop more of a
[27:50] picture of where we're at in time
[27:53] but um i say this like brother david he
[27:56] was speaking about
[27:59] a war
[28:01] that was disguised by prosperity
[28:05] you know
[28:06] we're we're so nourished in the word of
[28:09] god i thank god that you know he he's
[28:12] actually here to do for what we have
[28:15] need of you know
[28:18] it's it's it's profound that the seed of
[28:21] god within us
[28:23] it's calling for an expression
[28:26] it's calling for a manifestation and
[28:29] it's groaning for something because
[28:32] there was something that was lost
[28:35] amen you recognize in life there's
[28:38] there's just an unsettled feeling
[28:40] sometimes and you wonder
[28:42] what is this what is this unsettledness
[28:46] and
[28:46] and mankind had lost their their
[28:50] relationship and fellowship
[28:54] and there was a great chasm
[28:56] a sin chasm and and after that sin man
[28:59] had lost his estate and he began to go
[29:02] inward
[29:03] in his conceits in his considerations
[29:06] and he's not looking out for his fellow
[29:09] man
[29:11] but
[29:13] but there's a people at the end time
[29:15] amen that come in harmony
[29:17] with the original
[29:19] plan the original
[29:21] word where god and man now actually it's
[29:24] not about just uh what can i do and and
[29:28] my plan and
[29:30] my desires
[29:31] but it's now harmonizing with
[29:33] lord what is your will
[29:35] and how do you want me to perform it
[29:38] and i just believe it's by the spirit of
[29:40] the living god leading us amen there's
[29:42] there's people in life they don't want
[29:44] leadership only by what they can taste
[29:47] or touch or feel
[29:50] amen i'm glad i don't i'm not led by my
[29:52] feelings by my own thoughts amen
[30:01] read also in romans chapter 8
[30:04] in verse 18
[30:06] you know there's a great conflict that
[30:08] we war against and that's you know we
[30:11] have a humanity that
[30:14] it's still it's a nature and it's
[30:17] influenced
[30:18] right
[30:20] our lives we have a human life we have a
[30:22] nature and yet there's another nature
[30:25] inside
[30:26] amen and now those two are struggling
[30:29] who's gonna who's gonna be on display
[30:31] amen the world they only have one option
[30:34] they're just declaring the world
[30:37] but amen we're under a different
[30:38] influence there's a different
[30:40] intoxication for the believer amen
[30:45] there is a wine for the believer today
[30:48] the stimulation of revelation
[30:54] in
[30:56] romans chapter 8
[30:58] verse 18
[31:00] says this he says
[31:04] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[31:06] present time are not worthy to be
[31:09] compared with the glory
[31:13] which shall be revealed in us
[31:16] you know it's it's
[31:17] it's a it's amazing to me the word of
[31:21] god
[31:23] when there's a comparison there
[31:26] you know a lot of times we don't move
[31:27] unless there's a reward or some kind of
[31:31] motivation something to achieve and you
[31:34] know that's kind of what man has done
[31:36] they've gone out with science
[31:37] civilization and education and it's what
[31:39] man can achieve
[31:42] but i see
[31:43] another
[31:44] light in the scripture that says that
[31:47] the suffering of this present world is
[31:50] not worthy to be compared now this is
[31:53] the comparison that i want to to esteem
[31:56] this is the comparison that i want to
[31:58] lead me it's that there will be a glory
[32:01] which shall be revealed in us
[32:04] amen
[32:05] and what is that
[32:06] what is that glory what is that place
[32:09] that a believer can come to where
[32:12] it is the glory of god it's not my will
[32:14] but it's
[32:15] god's will
[32:21] amen
[32:26] i just think it's it's it's just not the
[32:29] way of man when you pray for revelation
[32:31] you're praying for suffering
[32:34] i just it's so contrary
[32:37] you know like who would want trials who
[32:39] wants suffering who wants tribulations
[32:42] who wants
[32:43] like rejection who wants reproaches
[32:48] but
[32:49] within the word of god
[32:51] paul's saying here that it's not even
[32:53] worthy to be compared for the earnest
[32:56] expectation of the creation waited for
[32:59] the manifestations of the sons of god
[33:02] for the creation
[33:03] was made subject to vanity not willing
[33:07] but by reason of him who hath subjected
[33:11] the same in hope because the creature
[33:13] itself also
[33:15] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[33:17] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[33:20] the children of god
[33:22] for we know that the whole creation
[33:25] groaneth and travail it in pain
[33:27] together until now and that that word
[33:31] vanity i was looking it up because it's
[33:34] it's interesting that
[33:36] there's a groaning that's happening and
[33:39] the whole creation is is there's an
[33:42] expectation but yet there's this vanity
[33:46] and and i the definition of vanity is an
[33:49] inflated pride in oneself
[33:52] it's it's
[33:54] or the appearance you know it's an
[33:56] emptiness it's a it's valueless and you
[34:00] know i just think about the sin nature
[34:02] of man i think about you know we didn't
[34:04] come here to this world choosing to be
[34:08] born right right we were subject to sin
[34:11] nature amen and now but the whole
[34:15] creation because that wasn't
[34:18] god's plans for his children that wasn't
[34:20] the first estate
[34:22] right
[34:24] so but we're now all subject to this
[34:26] vanity
[34:27] and and we've come into an atmosphere
[34:29] where it's completely polluted
[34:32] amen and even like a time where sickness
[34:36] and politics have gone
[34:39] absolutely
[34:40] to to to this degree
[34:42] and it's it's created a toxic atmosphere
[34:46] where you can hardly know
[34:48] who's saying
[34:50] the truth or who's just uh speaking lies
[34:53] like
[34:55] you know and so it creates an atmosphere
[34:58] where it it it tries to
[35:00] [Music]
[35:01] like stall the growth of the believer or
[35:03] or you lose your focus because what
[35:06] happens is the world can influence the
[35:08] believer to start acting out
[35:11] just like the world
[35:13] right i mean we're all subject to vanity
[35:17] but praise god he didn't leave us
[35:19] without a help
[35:21] amen
[35:23] i'm so thankful for that
[35:26] said i wouldn't leave you comfortless
[35:29] right
[35:40] so there's a these bird pains and
[35:44] it's it's interesting to me like even
[35:47] the scripture says
[35:52] in philippians i don't know if i read
[35:53] that but
[35:58] praise the lord you're feeling good
[36:01] i tell you god is so merciful i
[36:04] i
[36:06] was feeling really nervous and i got to
[36:08] thinking you know
[36:09] it it's the love of god that constrains
[36:12] us to move
[36:13] amen and and you know that
[36:16] you know the love of god
[36:18] it's in the believers and well i just i
[36:20] feel like it was just the the prayers of
[36:22] the saints you just start settling in
[36:24] and the wife every one time you came up
[36:27] here and you started testifying or
[36:29] something you know what i'm talking
[36:30] about
[36:35] praise the lord
[36:40] in philippians maybe they can put it up
[36:42] in the back i'm looking for chapter 1
[36:44] and
[36:45] verse
[36:46] 21.
[36:58] anybody can testify that god is real
[37:01] amen god's been there for you day by day
[37:04] moment by moment
[37:07] the scripture says there in uh
[37:09] philippians 1
[37:11] and 21 he says for me to live is christ
[37:14] and to die is gain you know i think
[37:16] about that and you know it's it's it's
[37:19] all glorious whether you live or die
[37:23] it's all glorious in the sight of god
[37:25] when you're when you're born again and
[37:26] you're a new creature in christ jesus
[37:29] there's really like the scripture says
[37:31] he works all things together for good
[37:35] and so my what it what an exchange you
[37:37] know you think about what the rags that
[37:39] we had and now god he gives us life and
[37:43] and now it's uh
[37:45] the results are so glorious and the
[37:48] manifestation of god is always in the
[37:50] flesh amen for the believer
[37:52] we get to be a partaker
[37:55] of that
[38:02] brother branham made this statement
[38:05] in a message called birth pains he says
[38:07] now i want to speak this afternoon on
[38:10] and announce birth pains now i know it
[38:13] sounds bad but it's the bible
[38:15] i believe that jesus here speaking of he
[38:18] said you will have sorrow but your
[38:21] sorrow will turn into joy speaking to
[38:23] his disciples
[38:25] knowing that the birth of christianity
[38:27] was coming into existence
[38:30] amen and now the old has to die in order
[38:34] for the new to be born you know
[38:37] that's that's just the way it is we go
[38:39] through seasons we go through different
[38:41] things and god's wanting to give us that
[38:44] elevated experience he wants to move us
[38:46] up into perfection he wants us to to lay
[38:49] aside every weight and sin that does so
[38:52] easily beset us and and even like our
[38:56] our brother peter said he said think it
[38:58] not strange when you come into these
[39:01] diverse temptations you know those those
[39:04] temptations those trials are actually
[39:07] squeezing you into a place many times
[39:11] where the only thing that can bring you
[39:13] out of that is the very seed word of god
[39:17] coming
[39:18] to manifestation amen don't you thank
[39:20] god sometimes
[39:23] well
[39:24] the trials the suffering
[39:27] it how can you count it all joy because
[39:30] the word of god said he'd work it for
[39:32] good
[39:34] amen
[39:38] says
[39:41] now the old has to die in order that the
[39:43] new is born to have anything that gives
[39:47] birth
[39:48] it has to the pains of distress
[39:52] and there certainly was going to go
[39:54] through pain and distress and anguish
[39:57] to get from law to grace
[40:01] amen naturally nature
[40:04] birth types the spiritual birth
[40:06] all things of the natural is types of
[40:09] the spiritual and we find out if we look
[40:12] the ground and we see a tree in the
[40:15] earth growing it is struggling for life
[40:18] that's going to show that there's a tree
[40:21] somewhere and it that it doesn't die
[40:25] amen don't you aren't you so glad that
[40:27] there's a place there's a there's you
[40:30] know there's a a life that you never die
[40:33] amen if we didn't have the hope
[40:36] we would be the most miserable people i
[40:39] mean it wouldn't even
[40:41] when you when you face the hard times
[40:43] when you face the persecutions and
[40:45] distress if we didn't have that hope
[40:48] my what would
[40:49] i mean it might as well just be like the
[40:51] world
[40:57] he said
[40:58] there's got to be a tree somewhere that
[41:00] doesn't die because it's crying out for
[41:03] something
[41:05] we find no matter how old how sick what
[41:08] condition they're crying out to live
[41:11] because it shows there's a life
[41:12] somewhere that we live
[41:14] live forever
[41:16] notice how perfect
[41:18] you know i just think about sometimes in
[41:20] life you know you
[41:22] you you really don't know where to turn
[41:24] when you're struggling but i just i
[41:26] think about how you know the examples
[41:29] you know of people who took god at his
[41:31] word
[41:32] and
[41:33] the the promise was manifest it seemed
[41:35] like it came to the very last hour the
[41:37] darkest hour you know even like paul and
[41:41] i think about i was listening to brother
[41:43] branham's life story
[41:45] this week and it just the the testimony
[41:48] it just become more valuable what god
[41:51] took our prophet messenger through
[41:53] and you know
[41:57] i mean he was broken he
[41:59] the
[42:00] the very love and life of christ
[42:02] actually
[42:04] it just is so profound in a believer i
[42:08] just you know to think about
[42:10] you know
[42:11] coming to a place and being an example
[42:14] of what obedience and and what
[42:16] disobedience
[42:18] you know we we're we're subject
[42:20] to the word of god and we're subject to
[42:22] mistakes
[42:24] my
[42:25] and to think that there's
[42:28] there's um
[42:29] witnesses that have gone before us
[42:32] and that we can we don't have to suffer
[42:34] the same heartache we can look to the
[42:36] example
[42:37] you know i appreciate our pastor one
[42:41] it's been a while you know and and uh
[42:43] and it just always stuck with me is
[42:46] you know he said you know
[42:49] um
[42:50] experience is a good teacher
[42:53] you know
[42:56] he said but that's not the best teacher
[42:59] and i'm like now you got my attention
[43:02] he said uh instruction you know heating
[43:05] instruction
[43:06] and and i got to thinking about you know
[43:08] if i had a job and they said hey you
[43:10] need a hard hat you need boots you need
[43:12] this that and the other you know if if i
[43:15] just said i was going to do my own thing
[43:17] i mean you get some lumps on your head
[43:18] doing it that way you know and that's
[43:20] how we are in our nature we're subject
[43:22] to this vanity like our own thinking
[43:24] what we can do and how we got it all
[43:27] thought out and planned out and oh my
[43:29] thank thank god for a provided word amen
[43:33] at the end time
[43:35] we don't have to just kind of wonder and
[43:36] try to figure things out because you
[43:38] can't figure out god
[43:40] god has to reveal it amen
[43:43] that's why we're depending upon the
[43:45] revelation
[43:47] and this groaning is not in vain amen
[43:50] the trials the distress the struggle
[43:53] it's actually to bring a warning of what
[43:56] is needed amen
[43:58] you know
[43:59] the the the relational struggles the job
[44:02] search you know the the the different
[44:05] you know needs that we have from
[44:07] sickness or or even when you look at how
[44:10] the world's just completely falling
[44:12] apart there's a word
[44:14] that's been provided amen
[44:18] and i thank god that there's a people
[44:20] it's not a it's not a message just for
[44:23] the minister just for the evangelist
[44:25] just for the deacons or the trustees
[44:28] but amen it's it's a people that are
[44:30] part of a body amen we have to find our
[44:34] place our position because god wants to
[44:36] materialize the very life of christ in
[44:39] you
[44:40] in your situations
[44:42] amen
[44:46] i just think about the truth
[44:49] you know something that
[44:51] that just it just strikes me when you
[44:54] when you consider
[44:55] you know our lives as individuals and
[44:58] how we're connected to each other and
[45:00] how that we have an influence you know
[45:02] brother branham made a statement i'll
[45:03] read it in a little bit but he said you
[45:05] know there was there was a uh uh
[45:08] you know the the church was losing the
[45:10] power and testimony or the power and
[45:13] influence of their testimony and i
[45:15] thought my i don't never want that to be
[45:17] my testimony that i've that i haven't
[45:20] identified with what god's provided can
[45:22] you imagine god providing all of this
[45:25] and this is carnal but like we're here
[45:27] at a bank with all this money you know
[45:30] and we just never went to it because oh
[45:33] you know i just i'm i'm okay i don't
[45:35] need that but it's like the promises of
[45:38] god can you imagine losing like someone
[45:41] taking god at his word
[45:43] and and just
[45:44] oh you know seeing the materialization
[45:47] because the testimonies and the power
[45:50] and influence it's not just to one
[45:52] another
[45:54] you know there's people out there that
[45:56] you know i hear it constantly you know
[45:59] they they they're looking for a hope you
[46:02] know and in simplicity this gospel
[46:04] [Music]
[46:05] oh my
[46:06] you know to think that there's a
[46:08] judgment coming
[46:10] you know but it's the gospel is so
[46:12] simple
[46:14] amen thank god for the simplicity of the
[46:16] gospel
[46:20] you know they want god
[46:22] the the man said to me
[46:25] he said you know
[46:26] i was i was believing on god
[46:28] for the the uh
[46:31] the uh fire policy
[46:33] i said fire policy
[46:35] yeah you know you know like some people
[46:37] just accept god to dodge hell
[46:41] you know and i thought my goodness what
[46:43] a shallow version of what's been
[46:46] provided
[46:47] my goodness i mean to be in fellowship
[46:50] where god
[46:51] he leads you to fulfillment to give you
[46:54] all of what's groaning what's longing in
[46:57] your heart my
[46:59] and then when they see your light
[47:02] you know you are the light of the world
[47:04] when they see your life yielded
[47:07] to the manifestation
[47:09] of the word of god they said now i i
[47:12] have some
[47:13] hope i could
[47:15] i can just inquire of them
[47:18] my
[47:25] you know i think about the
[47:28] the war disguised in prosperities when
[47:30] he was
[47:32] ministering i started thinking about
[47:34] samuel
[47:36] i'm sorry
[47:38] samson
[47:41] and
[47:42] in judges chapter 16
[47:46] in verse 16
[47:49] the
[47:52] you know the story and how that
[47:54] you know samson
[47:56] he was raised up to destroy his enemy
[48:00] and
[48:02] you know he ended up giving his strength
[48:04] to god and he gave his heart
[48:08] to delilah
[48:11] and
[48:12] and
[48:13] you know it just
[48:15] brother branham made this statement and
[48:16] he preached
[48:18] this message multiple times and it just
[48:21] it just
[48:22] it's so fitting for our day the
[48:24] parallels and
[48:26] brother branham said this and
[48:28] um once more in in 63
[48:32] in november 17th he says look at him
[48:35] humiliated broken
[48:37] a symbol of a fallen church spiritually
[48:39] stripped
[48:40] morally broken
[48:42] what an example of the conditions today
[48:45] samson
[48:48] this was samson the great
[48:51] so this was him
[48:53] a great mighty instrument of god
[48:57] why many philistines i would imagine the
[49:00] lord the war lord standing there looking
[49:03] there why the very remembrance of that
[49:07] of his name
[49:08] the whole country trembled
[49:12] just say samson
[49:14] then you all had to do
[49:16] just mention the name samson and
[49:18] everybody trembled at his name and now
[49:21] look why he said you know it used to be
[49:24] that the name of the lord jesus was a
[49:27] great
[49:28] reverence people honored
[49:32] highly honored it
[49:33] and the ones who honored it cast out
[49:36] evil spirits
[49:38] by it and could make nature obey their
[49:41] command at his name
[49:44] my
[49:47] but i think that samson here what
[49:50] i want to to parallel is is
[49:54] the modern condition of the church today
[49:56] it's a perfect parallel
[49:58] the church has lost has long lost its
[50:02] respect
[50:03] but
[50:04] not because
[50:05] god has filled the church but because
[50:07] the church failed god
[50:11] amen and it's
[50:12] the the
[50:14] and we ought to be standing in the same
[50:16] condition like the church was when
[50:19] ananias and sapphiras
[50:22] brought before the church but instead we
[50:24] have long compromised with the things of
[50:27] the world and brought it in
[50:29] and
[50:30] and it hasn't
[50:32] does impact the dignity that it should
[50:35] have
[50:38] and i guess as they stood there standing
[50:40] to their feet when the main event was
[50:43] taking place
[50:45] and just took themselves back
[50:48] for a few minutes i can imagine the
[50:50] philistines
[50:52] the warriors standing there with their
[50:54] fine jeweled women
[50:56] their arm
[50:57] arms around them drinking and toasting
[51:00] dagon
[51:01] my
[51:02] what a picture
[51:03] hail dagon of victorious over jehovah
[51:07] and we have
[51:08] showed them what we can do
[51:11] we showed this fella who claims so much
[51:15] and there is nothing to him
[51:17] can you imagine
[51:19] what
[51:20] what a like
[51:22] yielding your strength but not your
[51:25] heart how it
[51:27] god didn't fail samson
[51:29] amen god doesn't fail us
[51:33] you know a lot of times we go in doing
[51:34] our own thing amen we're all guilty
[51:38] but there's a grace amen there's a word
[51:39] for us there's a warning you know a word
[51:42] of warning
[51:44] and i think brother branham gave this
[51:46] this this example about the muhammadin
[51:49] and there was a foremost evangelist and
[51:52] he brought he said let's bring 30 people
[51:54] and and you pray for 15 and
[51:57] and he just wasn't up for the challenge
[51:59] but you know there's a people that have
[52:01] come in contact with god that know the
[52:03] power
[52:04] of the name of jesus christ because
[52:06] they've been blood washed they've been
[52:08] made new creatures in christ jesus amen
[52:11] can i get a witness is there somebody in
[52:13] here that knows the power of the
[52:14] resurrection by the shedding of the
[52:17] blood of the lamb amen
[52:22] amen
[52:23] these signs shall follow them
[52:26] that believe
[52:28] it is almost
[52:30] come
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] another celebration when the heathen
[52:35] god can speak to the church
[52:37] and they stand there helpless defeated
[52:40] spiritually stripped
[52:42] now there is something
[52:44] that's
[52:45] done that now this is god this is this
[52:48] is largely what's got my attention
[52:50] because you know when we come to the
[52:52] house of god it's it's where's my weak
[52:55] place you know because the chain is only
[52:57] as strong as its weakest link amen and
[53:00] we all bind our hearts together
[53:02] this is not a one-man thing this is god
[53:06] leading us as a body amen we must grow
[53:09] in the grace and knowledge of our lord
[53:11] jesus christ we all need one another
[53:14] there's no big one no little one
[53:17] amen it takes the prayers of the
[53:19] believers to make things happen amen
[53:23] he said
[53:25] he says this he says it's been the cares
[53:28] of the world entered into the church and
[53:30] it's got
[53:32] it no more than a lodge
[53:34] my
[53:35] i know that he's talking about
[53:38] the worldly church but amen god's
[53:40] dealing with us as individuals and i can
[53:43] testify god help me
[53:46] there is something that is is warning me
[53:48] you know you can get to where even the
[53:51] parables spoke about you know the seed
[53:53] that was sown and and you know
[53:56] different things the the ground and you
[53:59] know you think about how even the cares
[54:01] of the world can choke out the life of
[54:04] christ you know we can get so busy
[54:07] my if we could only remember the
[54:10] influence and power of our testimony
[54:12] what it was like to go before god in
[54:15] that desperate hour and that desperate
[54:18] kind i can't live another day unless you
[54:21] save me from myself you save me from
[54:23] this sin nature you give me a hope of a
[54:26] future that is not like the one
[54:29] the the the
[54:30] the reality that i have today i just
[54:33] feel to have a revival in my own heart
[54:36] you know brother branham said
[54:38] overcoming is to keep revised to keep in
[54:42] revival amen i don't want to grow cold i
[54:44] don't want to get so caught up into my
[54:47] daily routine the cares and pressures of
[54:50] this world the burdens of life
[54:53] packing
[54:54] a burden whether it's sickness or
[54:57] financial debt or the burdens
[55:01] that we have in prayer you know these
[55:04] are not weights that are supposed to
[55:05] destroy us these are things that are
[55:07] supposed to drive us
[55:09] into
[55:10] the groaning for manifestation amen god
[55:14] has made a way for us to overcome
[55:20] the church has lost the influence of its
[55:23] testimony that it's
[55:25] a living moving body of christ
[55:30] amen but they've lost the courage
[55:33] that's what samson had done
[55:36] lost its power
[55:38] amen thank god that he's promised a
[55:40] restoration amen these are things that
[55:43] in our individual life we don't want to
[55:45] lose the power and influence of our
[55:48] testimony you know we got the world that
[55:50] tries to influence us
[55:52] to do and to express
[55:54] that manifestation
[55:57] but praise god
[55:59] there's a spirit that when he has the
[56:01] preeminence
[56:03] that which is groaning that's what we're
[56:05] that deep that's calling for expression
[56:10] we love to see that expression amen
[56:19] you know as i was thinking about
[56:21] that scripture um
[56:24] ii peter
[56:27] you know you think about uh the
[56:30] atmosphere i know brother jeremy is
[56:32] speaking about you know atmosphere and
[56:34] you know the world has an atmosphere
[56:36] that they want to draw you into their
[56:38] atmosphere you know different spirits
[56:40] they want fellowship and so they're
[56:42] trying to pull you into you know hey you
[56:45] know have a business or get an education
[56:48] so you can have easy street and and
[56:50] different things but as a christian
[56:51] there's going to be a struggle amen
[56:54] and but the world they trying to pull
[56:56] you into their way and they're in
[56:58] a manifestation but
[57:01] i just think you know like the scripture
[57:03] says in
[57:04] [Music]
[57:05] ii peter
[57:07] chapter 3 and verse 1.
[57:17] says this
[57:20] second epistle beloved i now write unto
[57:23] you in both
[57:24] which i stir up your pure minds by the
[57:26] way of remembrance
[57:28] that ye
[57:29] may be mindful of the words which were
[57:31] spoken
[57:32] before by holy prophets and the
[57:34] commandments
[57:37] of us apostles of the lord and savior
[57:41] knowing this first
[57:43] that there shall come in the last days
[57:45] scoffers walking after their own lust
[57:48] you know that's that's golfers they have
[57:51] an influence
[57:54] you know scoffers this oh you holy
[57:56] roller or
[57:58] man you are going off the deep end you
[58:00] go to church three times a week man you
[58:03] overachiever you know they have all this
[58:04] scoffing
[58:06] trying to influence you to oh
[58:09] try to cool you off
[58:11] you know
[58:13] because they want fellowship
[58:19] he says
[58:20] and they're saying where is the promise
[58:23] of his coming
[58:25] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[58:27] things continue as they were
[58:30] from the beginning of creation
[58:33] for this they
[58:34] willingly are ignorant of that by the
[58:38] word of god the heavens were of old and
[58:40] the earth standing out of the water and
[58:42] in the water whereby the worlds that
[58:44] were was were being overflowed with
[58:47] water perished
[58:49] but the heavens and the earth which are
[58:51] now by the same word is kept store
[58:55] reserved unto a fiery
[58:57] fire against the day of judgment and
[58:59] perdition to the ungodly men
[59:01] but beloved
[59:03] and i'll just stop there for a minute
[59:04] because you know it's it's god's desire
[59:07] that
[59:08] no one would perish
[59:10] that all would come to the knowledge of
[59:12] the truth but praise god god doesn't he
[59:15] doesn't say by his desire he's saved by
[59:18] for knowledge amen he can predestinate
[59:22] amen thank god we're in that class
[59:24] tonight amen
[59:26] but you think about this attitude you
[59:28] know the scoffing and they say well
[59:30] where is the sign of his coming you know
[59:33] the promise of his coming things are
[59:35] just continuing as they are and you know
[59:38] people they they reject the word of god
[59:41] and yet they carry on they prosper in
[59:43] the way
[59:45] i mean they can print money
[59:47] and they say well
[59:48] you know we can keep this thing going
[59:52] and
[59:54] you know i just think about this
[59:56] it's a it's a condition i looked up this
[1:00:00] it's called a normalcy bias
[1:00:03] you know and this is a cognitive bias
[1:00:06] where man that leads people to
[1:00:09] disbelieve or minimize threats of
[1:00:12] warning you know
[1:00:15] it gets them to deny and to
[1:00:17] underestimate the possibility of
[1:00:20] disaster
[1:00:22] you know i think about you know as the
[1:00:25] the the
[1:00:26] the narrative oh you know this thing you
[1:00:30] know it'll go on and on and you know
[1:00:32] god is not mocked
[1:00:34] you know
[1:00:35] mankind is continually sowing
[1:00:38] away from the word of god and it always
[1:00:41] brings destruction
[1:00:43] when you consider when god sends a
[1:00:45] prophet that's god's mercy to the
[1:00:47] nations it's god's mercy to the world
[1:00:51] and now i mean that same spirit that was
[1:00:54] in him is in you now god sending you
[1:00:56] you're the mercy to the world
[1:00:59] it's the same spirit of christ in you
[1:01:03] now it's leading us
[1:01:05] in the midst of a crook and corrupt
[1:01:07] generation
[1:01:11] this
[1:01:12] normalcy bias
[1:01:15] one of the dangers of the effect
[1:01:19] is they disbelieve or minimize the
[1:01:21] threats
[1:01:23] and it leads to an unfair persecution
[1:01:26] of a group like the holocaust and other
[1:01:30] slaveries so you see the the condition
[1:01:32] of the world the atmosphere is ripe
[1:01:35] to bring a persecution
[1:01:39] and so
[1:01:40] those of us who
[1:01:42] have received the word for this hour
[1:01:45] you know we embrace
[1:01:47] our burden our cross amen because you
[1:01:50] know it's not very long before the fire
[1:01:53] is going to fall amen i don't want to be
[1:01:55] caught up
[1:01:56] with just the cares of this world
[1:01:58] because there is a a reward to those who
[1:02:02] diligently seek him amen there's a
[1:02:05] reward to those who who will lay their
[1:02:08] life down
[1:02:10] in christ and and god
[1:02:13] seek out that which was lost amen
[1:02:17] praise god
[1:02:18] we've become ambassadors for the king
[1:02:22] amen what a privilege that we have i
[1:02:25] mean so many people throughout all the
[1:02:28] the dispensations of the new testament
[1:02:30] that they wanted to live in this
[1:02:32] day i don't want to lose the influence
[1:02:35] and the power of our testimony the
[1:02:38] called out in the last day
[1:02:40] to receive the very life of christ
[1:02:43] to be restored
[1:02:45] full
[1:02:46] restoration
[1:02:48] to come into the fullness of christ why
[1:02:50] what a privilege
[1:03:01] brother branham makes a statement in in
[1:03:03] the messiah
[1:03:05] now we know that we have five gates on
[1:03:08] the outside see taste touch smell in
[1:03:10] here
[1:03:12] and and the five gates on the inside
[1:03:15] and brother branham goes into that about
[1:03:17] a man made
[1:03:19] in a system of a tabernacle the outer
[1:03:21] courts then the holies place and the
[1:03:23] holies of holies and the shekinah glory
[1:03:27] on the inside the veil
[1:03:30] now the outside gates of a man has a
[1:03:33] five senses that enter into the body and
[1:03:35] then inside
[1:03:36] in the soul and the soul is the nature
[1:03:38] of the spirit that's inside of the heart
[1:03:41] that produces the soul and makes the
[1:03:43] atmosphere in him
[1:03:45] now then inside that there's one gate
[1:03:48] and that one entrance is into the
[1:03:50] shekinah glory where god can enter in
[1:03:53] and take
[1:03:54] over the control tower and the only way
[1:03:57] that's through self-will
[1:03:59] we know this amen it's it's so good that
[1:04:02] we can come to a place that god's just
[1:04:04] like in the garden he placed man on
[1:04:06] freemore agency to choose or reject
[1:04:11] my i just i just think about
[1:04:15] what it my
[1:04:17] what a privilege it is to be those that
[1:04:19] that are able to humble themselves to
[1:04:22] the will of the father the word of god
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:31] but we must either choose right or wrong
[1:04:33] either one you want to now self-will
[1:04:36] then god comes into the man into the
[1:04:38] heart which is in the spirit and the
[1:04:40] spirit makes the soul
[1:04:42] now
[1:04:43] when a man is converted
[1:04:45] say just like a button in the heart
[1:04:49] that part is god
[1:04:51] when you're born again with the spirit
[1:04:53] of god god's spirit dwelling in you
[1:04:56] and he can let the spirit grow and take
[1:04:59] out all the roots of bitterness and
[1:05:01] press god's way through it again
[1:05:04] and then come back into the same
[1:05:06] condition that was in the garden of eden
[1:05:09] verily verily i say unto you if you say
[1:05:11] unto this mountain be moved and do not
[1:05:14] doubt in your heart but believe
[1:05:18] what you say it will come to pass and he
[1:05:20] puts that right back supreme again
[1:05:24] puts it right back in that condition
[1:05:26] amen and i think i thank god for
[1:05:29] you know god is in our midst
[1:05:32] restoring this we can even see it in the
[1:05:34] testimony of our brother standing here
[1:05:37] proclaiming
[1:05:39] the same god is going to move on the
[1:05:41] scene and it's already working amen
[1:05:44] i love it because even like our pastor
[1:05:46] says
[1:05:47] god can do nothing for you except you
[1:05:49] first
[1:05:50] proclaim it testify of it amen we don't
[1:05:53] want to just be sitting in in our
[1:05:56] service
[1:05:57] and and you know coming and getting the
[1:05:59] orders and not carrying them out amen
[1:06:02] there's people that you know
[1:06:04] i don't want to be encumbered with
[1:06:07] a a results
[1:06:09] ministry i'm not looking for results i
[1:06:12] want to be an obedient son amen i just
[1:06:14] want to go into hold the world
[1:06:16] and testify what god's done amen
[1:06:20] leave the results up to god amen
[1:06:27] i just think about how profound it was
[1:06:29] that god
[1:06:32] he allowed man to
[1:06:34] to have an article in the reader's
[1:06:35] digest
[1:06:37] he was talking about how they had
[1:06:40] they had a man that he didn't know it
[1:06:42] but he was praying for somebody
[1:06:44] and they they took the picture the x-ray
[1:06:47] of the light radiating a cosmic light
[1:06:50] radiating from the man as he was praying
[1:06:52] for the sick
[1:06:53] you know and and brother branham says
[1:06:54] now
[1:06:56] it's like they they putting the x-ray
[1:06:58] down and they found out the light coming
[1:07:00] from his hand and god knew what he was
[1:07:02] talking about when he said lay hands on
[1:07:04] the sick and they shall recover he know
[1:07:07] what he was speaking of and i want to
[1:07:09] see the church
[1:07:10] press into that place
[1:07:12] where they can come like god wants them
[1:07:15] to be amen isn't that your heart's
[1:07:16] desire do you have confidence that god
[1:07:19] will fulfill his word if you feel
[1:07:21] burdened for somebody and you know that
[1:07:24] if you lay hands on the sick if you
[1:07:26] speak to this mountain god will move
[1:07:28] that mountain
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:33] then god was made flesh and dwelt
[1:07:36] and and became the messiah then if we
[1:07:39] can yield ourselves and be anointed like
[1:07:42] he was we become messiahs little lights
[1:07:47] that's what the church is supposed to be
[1:07:49] lights little anointed ones that's god's
[1:07:52] church standing lights
[1:07:55] in the light of the messiah risen christ
[1:07:57] in his people anointed ones
[1:08:00] carrying forth the light
[1:08:02] into all the church ages
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:07] praise the lord that we got this you
[1:08:10] know
[1:08:13] you know i
[1:08:15] i tell you it just means so much more to
[1:08:17] me than ever
[1:08:18] the the the life
[1:08:20] that god brought william branham through
[1:08:23] you know because you see that he was
[1:08:27] like a first fruit of a restored son
[1:08:30] that that we can look to and and see now
[1:08:33] god's going to have a harvest time where
[1:08:35] he harvests he'll thrust the sickle for
[1:08:37] the last time before the fiery judgments
[1:08:40] falls
[1:08:41] and so i i was listening to the
[1:08:43] testimony just started pulsating
[1:08:46] something deep i can't explain it
[1:08:48] but there's something that resonates
[1:08:50] there's something that that that is
[1:08:52] groaning to to come to this place
[1:08:56] where god is dealing with us as
[1:08:58] individuals the same way he did not
[1:09:00] necessarily in the visions
[1:09:03] and because he fulfilled his part
[1:09:06] but i just think about
[1:09:08] something that he had said
[1:09:10] when uh it was a message is this the
[1:09:12] signs of the answer
[1:09:14] he said now the vision
[1:09:17] had my wife and my
[1:09:19] you know part of
[1:09:21] there was a groaning in his life he saw
[1:09:23] a vision and now there was something
[1:09:25] that was driving him to fulfillment
[1:09:28] you know i thank god that he just
[1:09:29] doesn't let us you know kind of uh just
[1:09:32] do in ourselves you know he's that great
[1:09:35] eagle that flaps his wings and takes the
[1:09:38] feathers out of the nest and then it
[1:09:40] starts getting to where we have to move
[1:09:42] it's like the issue's forced we can't
[1:09:44] stay in the same place we've got to move
[1:09:46] forward and so brother branham is
[1:09:49] talking about that vision he had in him
[1:09:52] and his wife and his children in that
[1:09:54] and
[1:09:54] it was the thing it was it was the
[1:09:57] covered wagon and the minute i was
[1:10:00] walking
[1:10:01] in there there was
[1:10:04] i was in that in my station wagon and
[1:10:06] that way we leave a couple of days not
[1:10:09] knowing where we were going
[1:10:12] not knowing
[1:10:13] where we're going to be to do when we
[1:10:16] get there
[1:10:17] just going
[1:10:19] god is strange to us
[1:10:21] because his ways are past finding out he
[1:10:24] wants obedience
[1:10:27] where are you going well that's none of
[1:10:29] your business just keep going
[1:10:33] where you want me to do lord
[1:10:35] that's nothing for you follow
[1:10:37] thou me
[1:10:39] just keep walking
[1:10:43] where will i stop
[1:10:45] what's that to you
[1:10:47] just keep walking so here i go in the
[1:10:49] name of jesus christ amen yeah i just
[1:10:52] feel like that's that's i just tell on
[1:10:55] myself sometimes you want to know where
[1:10:56] am i going you know what are you going
[1:10:59] to do with me
[1:11:00] when i get there
[1:11:02] you know i just said god help to get the
[1:11:04] fear out i don't i don't have to figure
[1:11:06] this thing out i don't have to know
[1:11:08] everything but you know what we have a
[1:11:10] promise that he would reveal it as we
[1:11:12] have need of it
[1:11:14] aren't you grateful that you're in that
[1:11:15] kind of relationship
[1:11:24] praise the lord i won't keep you very
[1:11:25] much longer
[1:11:28] just feel
[1:11:30] so good to be in his presence
[1:11:34] you know i just think about
[1:11:37] you know the lord he was
[1:11:39] born
[1:11:41] you know of a virgin
[1:11:43] and yet he he subjected himself
[1:11:47] to
[1:11:49] all manner of temptation
[1:11:51] all manner of sickness all manner of
[1:11:54] heartache
[1:11:55] he was
[1:11:56] burdened and
[1:11:58] he groaned in the spirit he came to a
[1:12:00] place where his wa his blood separated
[1:12:04] the water from the blood i mean what he
[1:12:07] did for us he was squeezed out
[1:12:10] and crushed amen for you and i
[1:12:14] and think about the
[1:12:20] the message
[1:12:22] brother branham talked about this in
[1:12:24] perfect faith he said
[1:12:28] now he never used his power for himself
[1:12:31] he used it for others
[1:12:33] that's what he was sent for
[1:12:35] and you think sometimes
[1:12:38] why would a man with so full of power
[1:12:41] like him
[1:12:42] would ever be sick yes sir i've read
[1:12:45] some book somewhere
[1:12:48] where he was raised up that boy the
[1:12:51] widow's son from naaman i believe it was
[1:12:54] the prince of the house of david and he
[1:12:56] sat on a rock and groaned with a
[1:12:58] headache see
[1:12:59] he bore our infirmities
[1:13:02] bear means to pack them
[1:13:05] see he bore
[1:13:07] he had
[1:13:08] all things like we have he had sickness
[1:13:11] he had temptations he had troubles he
[1:13:13] had frustrations
[1:13:15] just like we had
[1:13:19] because he had to be the right kind of
[1:13:20] mediator
[1:13:22] so that he can be a partaker a husband
[1:13:25] of the fruit
[1:13:27] before he would know
[1:13:30] my think about that you know
[1:13:34] god knows what you're going through
[1:13:36] god knows the suffering and the the
[1:13:38] frustrations he's
[1:13:41] he he subjected himself
[1:13:44] to those things
[1:13:46] so that you don't have to bear them
[1:13:47] alone amen
[1:13:50] praise the lord
[1:13:53] you know i got to thinking about
[1:13:55] you know
[1:13:57] in that testimony brother branham in
[1:13:59] perfect faith you know that's that's
[1:14:01] what we're coming to this perfect word
[1:14:03] brings a perfect faith and you know he
[1:14:05] was talking about jesus not
[1:14:07] using his power for himself but he came
[1:14:09] to give it and and i believe that god
[1:14:11] works on both ends of the line amen
[1:14:14] you know there's people that are on your
[1:14:16] heart burdens
[1:14:17] people who are
[1:14:19] without the lord
[1:14:20] some people they may be struggling in
[1:14:23] school
[1:14:24] they may maybe wondering what the
[1:14:26] meaning of life is some people may just
[1:14:28] you know
[1:14:29] be looking to just to have a friend
[1:14:32] you know
[1:14:33] and yet this
[1:14:36] one that bore the infirmity now wants to
[1:14:39] bear the infirmities of others through a
[1:14:41] body
[1:14:42] and you know a lot of times we're
[1:14:44] looking for a reward now
[1:14:47] but our reward comes later amen
[1:14:50] and you just think about
[1:14:52] you know god working on both ends of the
[1:14:53] line someone
[1:14:55] that you know
[1:14:56] somebody that you've been praying for
[1:14:59] they're crying out to god and
[1:15:01] god's using you
[1:15:03] to make a connection and i think about
[1:15:06] brother dao and how that
[1:15:09] it just it just struck me and i'll read
[1:15:11] it
[1:15:13] you know when
[1:15:14] um
[1:15:16] he said god told me the other day with
[1:15:18] brother dao here that i would shake his
[1:15:21] hand on the street again
[1:15:23] that very strange it wasn't he wasn't
[1:15:26] here this morning but two minutes longer
[1:15:31] and i would not have met him on the
[1:15:32] street but he stepped out of the car and
[1:15:34] i stepped out of the car in the time to
[1:15:36] shake his hand
[1:15:39] when he was coming on the street
[1:15:41] he didn't know me he didn't he had his
[1:15:43] glasses off and he couldn't see me but
[1:15:46] when he heard my voice he started crying
[1:15:50] what was it usually he doesn't do that
[1:15:55] but it was an answer to what was told
[1:15:57] him under the oxygen tent
[1:16:00] he would do it
[1:16:03] i said
[1:16:04] you also said in the church again it's
[1:16:07] your heart's desire
[1:16:09] and when we are having chicago meetings
[1:16:11] he wanted to come to the meeting
[1:16:15] his heart was for it
[1:16:16] i sent him a telegram greeting for us
[1:16:19] and the children and told him we were
[1:16:21] praying
[1:16:22] that he would get well quick
[1:16:24] a lovely brother who visited him and he
[1:16:27] wanted
[1:16:28] to come back so bad
[1:16:30] and here he sits tonight with us see
[1:16:33] that wasn't prearranged the same god
[1:16:35] arranged it and makes it work perfectly
[1:16:38] on the dot
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:40] there are certain things in your life
[1:16:42] that i just believe it's the same god
[1:16:44] that's working on the other end of the
[1:16:46] line for those
[1:16:48] that their burden they they have a
[1:16:51] desire and yet
[1:16:53] your your gift of faith can actually
[1:16:57] speak forth and even just be moved to
[1:17:01] send a telegram i'm praying for you and
[1:17:03] just watch god
[1:17:05] manifest the things that we're groaning
[1:17:07] for amen
[1:17:10] praise the lord
[1:17:15] we can invite the musicians to come
[1:17:18] trust that um
[1:17:21] the lord's
[1:17:23] good to you
[1:17:24] he's definitely good to me
[1:17:26] you know i was testifying to somebody
[1:17:28] the other day about how god he
[1:17:30] supernaturally healed my back
[1:17:33] and you know i told god i would never
[1:17:35] shy away from the testimony
[1:17:39] but you know what happens when you
[1:17:40] testify there's a test
[1:17:44] it wasn't
[1:17:46] i didn't even think two three hours and
[1:17:48] i was getting a catch in my back
[1:17:50] and all of a sudden
[1:17:51] i started feeling
[1:17:53] an attack
[1:17:54] but you know what
[1:17:56] i remember that jesus christ is the same
[1:17:59] yesterday today and forever and it
[1:18:01] wasn't very long that i was liberated
[1:18:03] again you know i thank god that god's
[1:18:06] power is greater than anything
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:10] why don't we stand
[1:18:21] praise the lord
[1:18:23] it's our opportunity to feed the seed
[1:18:25] and let the holy spirit quicken
[1:18:29] what's we're groaning for we're groaning
[1:18:31] for a manifestation we can't do it on
[1:18:33] our own but like the scripture says
[1:18:36] i believe it's in philippians that it's
[1:18:38] actually god in you to will and to do of
[1:18:42] his good pleasure
[1:18:43] our part is to
[1:18:45] go forward without murmuring
[1:18:47] or disputing amen god just have your way
[1:18:51] whatever you want to do you don't have
[1:18:53] to show me where i'm going you don't
[1:18:55] have to tell me what i'm going to do
[1:18:56] when i get there
[1:18:58] but if you'll just leave me
