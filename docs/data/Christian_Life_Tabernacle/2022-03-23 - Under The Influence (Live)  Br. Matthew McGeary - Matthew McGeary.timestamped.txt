[27:33] all god on me
[27:37] [Music]
[27:56] i pray that's everybody's desire
[28:02] is that the lord would pour out his
[28:03] presence upon you
[28:07] and i know that by divine promise he's
[28:09] here to do it
[28:11] maybe you've had a rough week
[28:14] maybe
[28:17] you're facing some
[28:19] trials maybe the greatest trials that
[28:21] you've ever faced in your life
[28:24] well i just want to encourage you that
[28:26] you've just stepped into a predestinated
[28:28] moment in time
[28:30] that if by faith
[28:33] that you can look past the veil of the
[28:35] flesh and look to the word of god and to
[28:37] know that god ordained this moment in
[28:39] time
[28:40] to speak to you
[28:42] outside of faith then we're just playing
[28:44] church we're no different
[28:46] from any college campus that would
[28:49] gather together and have some person
[28:52] grab some knowledge and try to present
[28:54] some information
[28:56] but i pray that we've come together for
[28:58] something far superior to what man can
[29:01] offer but we've come into a supernatural
[29:03] presence where the author and finisher
[29:06] of our faith has come and he has
[29:08] designed a service in such a way that
[29:10] would speak to your life do you believe
[29:12] that let's just approach
[29:14] our lord jesus heavenly father
[29:18] you are our all and all there's none
[29:19] like you
[29:21] or that's why many have
[29:23] made the sacrifice they've driven many
[29:26] miles they've made great efforts
[29:28] to be here overcome many obstacles
[29:32] because it's not a man's doing it's what
[29:34] you are doing lord you've placed a
[29:37] hunger and a thirst inside of the
[29:38] believer and they want to be in the
[29:40] house of god this tonight lord that you
[29:43] would speak to him
[29:45] lord in myself i know i'm just a man
[29:49] nothing i could give to your people that
[29:51] would
[29:54] in that seed but
[29:55] lord if you would come
[29:58] lord
[30:00] if you would just come by divine promise
[30:02] and
[30:03] break the bread of life and feed
[30:05] your sheep lord
[30:08] that they would receive revelation lord
[30:10] and they would go from this place
[30:12] encouraged and strengthened and closer
[30:14] to you i pray
[30:16] we ask all these things in your name the
[30:17] lord jesus christ amen
[30:21] praise the lord if you have your bibles
[30:22] we'll be reading out of second
[30:23] corinthians chapter three if i can get
[30:25] some volume
[30:26] on the monitors brother mike
[30:31] well we want to remember our pastor and
[30:33] brother david and sister leslie as
[30:35] they're in san diego
[30:37] uh we're thankful he has an opportunity
[30:38] to spend this time
[30:40] uh with his
[30:41] mom who's 99 soon to be
[30:44] 100 years old so we're just thankful
[30:46] for that there's many that are out that
[30:48] aren't feeling well
[30:50] so look around if you see somebody
[30:52] that's not here i just remember them in
[30:54] prayer because i know there's some
[30:56] sickness and things that are going
[30:57] around we pray the lord would be their
[30:58] portion for those that are streaming we
[31:00] know that god can meet you there
[31:02] amen so we're just glad to be here
[31:04] second corinthians chapter three
[31:08] we'll read verse three through six
[31:12] it says
[31:13] for
[31:14] as much as you are manifestly declared
[31:16] to be the epistles of christ ministered
[31:18] by us
[31:19] written not with ink but with the spirit
[31:21] of the living god not in tables of stone
[31:25] but in fleshly tables of the heart
[31:28] and such trust we have through christ to
[31:30] godward not that we are sufficient of
[31:32] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[31:36] but our sufficiency is
[31:38] of god
[31:40] who also hath made us able ministers of
[31:43] the new testament not of the letter but
[31:46] of the spirit
[31:48] notice that not of the letter
[31:51] but of the spirit
[31:55] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[31:58] giveth life amen you can have your seats
[32:01] as we'll just also turn in our bibles to
[32:04] hebrews chapter 10
[32:05] verse 16 through 21.
[32:19] i don't know if you can give me any more
[32:20] monitor up here but if i need to use the
[32:22] handheld i sure can we we're trying a
[32:24] new
[32:25] uh
[32:26] device here so just bear with us as we
[32:29] we work through some of the kinks there
[32:30] thank you brother hebrews
[32:32] chapter 10 we'll be reading 16-20 says
[32:35] this is the covenant that i will make
[32:37] with them after those days saith the
[32:38] lord i will put my laws into their
[32:41] hearts and their minds will i write them
[32:43] and their sins and iniquities will i
[32:45] remember no more now where remission of
[32:48] these is there is no more offering for
[32:50] sin having therefore brethren boldness
[32:52] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[32:55] of jesus by a new and living way which
[32:58] he hath consecrated for us through the
[33:00] veil
[33:01] that is to say his flesh
[33:03] and uh we spoke um a while back on the
[33:07] revelation of the new covenant and
[33:09] something that was on our heart we had
[33:11] spoke about abel ministers how how god
[33:13] has given us uh uh the the revelation of
[33:16] the new covenant or the new testament
[33:18] which is to bring us into the presence
[33:20] of god we spoke a little bit about
[33:22] apollos how he was going around and
[33:24] preaching he was a man that was fervent
[33:26] and he was he was preaching to the
[33:28] people in my he could inspire the people
[33:30] but yet what he was preaching wasn't the
[33:32] revelation of the hour he he wasn't
[33:34] walking in the light of the hour that's
[33:36] why when paul came through the coast he
[33:38] asked priscilla uh he had an aquila i
[33:41] believe it was he asked him look uh you
[33:43] know how were uh how are you baptized
[33:45] they said we haven't heard of the holy
[33:46] ghost
[33:48] well uh we haven't heard of such things
[33:50] well how were you baptized we were
[33:51] baptized into john's baptism but he said
[33:54] look you got to be baptized in the name
[33:55] of jesus christ and so though though
[33:58] apollos was going around preaching the
[33:59] word he wasn't an able minister to bring
[34:02] the people into the presence of god and
[34:04] say praise god we received a vindicated
[34:06] prophet enable a minister that was able
[34:09] to bring us into the presence of god
[34:11] that we're not looking to creeds and
[34:13] dogmas and a bunch of work up amongst
[34:15] the people but there was actually a
[34:17] manifestation of the word that proved
[34:19] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[34:21] today and forever and by faith we can
[34:23] come up into those higher heights and
[34:25] enter into that presence and so uh maybe
[34:27] what i would like to just title the
[34:29] sermon uh
[34:31] as we were moving maybe towards a second
[34:33] part but some time has gone by and i i
[34:35] was just really uh enthused about this
[34:37] thought about stimulation of revelation
[34:39] along these lines but but as i as uh
[34:42] brother david uh got a hold of me today
[34:44] about uh uh the service tonight i just
[34:47] started to to think upon the word and
[34:50] something that's on my heart that's just
[34:51] settling upon my heart i want to preach
[34:53] to you if i can title this service this
[34:55] evening under the influence
[34:57] i want to speak to you a little bit
[34:58] about being under the influence and and
[35:00] by i tell you what i was blessed by
[35:02] sunday service
[35:04] oh oh my when the word is open to you
[35:08] when you're when your understanding is
[35:10] open to you my it changes everything
[35:13] uh like jesus said he that heareth my
[35:15] words you know the prophet picks that up
[35:17] and says well it's not he that hears my
[35:18] words but it's he that understandeth my
[35:20] words because when understanding comes
[35:23] it changes things
[35:25] you don't think it changes things well
[35:27] you know a lot of times you know you you
[35:30] might you might be spending some time
[35:32] with an individual or or you might know
[35:34] your neighbor and you get along just
[35:35] fine but but what happens if you find
[35:37] out some information about them
[35:41] you you you might you might find out
[35:43] some information that was hidden or or
[35:46] was not previously made known to you and
[35:47] also that's going to influence the way
[35:49] you act
[35:51] you know if you find out somebody in the
[35:53] neighborhood you know uh uh uh you find
[35:55] out their criminal record or something
[35:57] like that you'd be like wait i'm going
[35:57] to keep my kids from over there
[36:02] it's going to have an influence it's
[36:03] going to have an effect on you
[36:05] my many times you might you might
[36:07] put out an invitation you want to invite
[36:09] people over and everything well you know
[36:11] some people might hear about it but but
[36:13] details make a difference
[36:16] wait did you say there was food there
[36:20] oh who's doing it where what time where
[36:22] is it going to be and all of a sudden
[36:24] something that didn't seem like a
[36:25] priority to you
[36:28] all sudden you start getting some
[36:30] information you start getting the facts
[36:31] and also your your understandings opened
[36:33] up you're like hey i'm gonna be there
[36:38] you know i i think it's that way a lot
[36:39] about like church you know you might
[36:41] hear there's some meetings going on and
[36:44] and you know you you know you might hear
[36:46] oh they're so and so it's getting
[36:47] together over there and that's fine and
[36:48] everything and then you find out who's
[36:50] preaching well because we all got
[36:51] favorites you're like well i'm gonna
[36:52] make that a priority
[36:55] uh-oh
[36:56] yeah i tell you what yeah this flesh
[36:58] this old carry-on has a way of having an
[37:00] effect on you it has an influence on you
[37:02] so we just want to speak a little bit
[37:04] about under the influence and just maybe
[37:06] laying a little foundation i think
[37:08] brother cosmic for giving us a little
[37:09] time this evening
[37:11] brother branham says in the token he
[37:12] says uh testament means covenant the new
[37:15] testament means the new covenant the old
[37:17] testament was the older under the lamb
[37:20] and the life could not come back on the
[37:21] believer the new testament was the lamb
[37:24] of god and his life comes back on us
[37:27] oh hallelujah
[37:29] blood's life see blood's blood is
[37:32] life in the new testament see life is
[37:34] from the blood of the lamb
[37:38] which means the new testament or new
[37:40] covenant that god after those days will
[37:43] i write my laws upon the fleshly tables
[37:45] of their heart see not upon the stony
[37:48] tables
[37:49] and a lamb's blood which you had to say
[37:52] yeah i got the blood over here now what
[37:55] does it say do
[37:57] i i i it's a shame but a lot of us are
[38:00] are serving the lord that way
[38:02] we're we're we're trying to follow the
[38:04] message that way and and we're doing it
[38:07] in such a way that where it's more of a
[38:09] a regulation or or what does it say over
[38:11] here and in yourself you're trying to
[38:13] carry out some commandments but he says
[38:15] but upon the tables of your heart oh and
[38:18] when the understanding is open up to you
[38:20] i tell you what sisters when the when
[38:22] the understanding has opened up to you
[38:23] why you shouldn't cut your hair you
[38:25] won't struggle with it anymore
[38:27] when i'm talking when you get a
[38:28] revelation i'm saying you're going to be
[38:30] tempted
[38:32] but as long as it remains up here in the
[38:34] intellect
[38:36] but when your understanding is open to
[38:39] you and the lord is revealing himself to
[38:41] you and his desires and something takes
[38:44] place it's going to influence you in
[38:46] such a way where where whenever that
[38:48] enemy tries to tip you to those things
[38:50] again
[38:51] you're going to shun the very appearance
[38:53] of evil you're going to say no to those
[38:55] things oh my i tell you what watch out
[38:57] the spirit of god is here you wonder why
[38:59] we struggle with some of those things
[39:01] it's because we're not coming subject to
[39:03] the message of the hour you wonder why
[39:05] there's problems in the home and you're
[39:06] going through things you're going and
[39:08] you won't make yourself subject to the
[39:10] word of god because you're just walking
[39:12] in religion but you're testifying to the
[39:14] church that you never come under oh
[39:16] hallelujah the subjection of the
[39:18] revelation of the hour and then you
[39:20] testify of how things aren't going right
[39:23] but i tell you all the presence of god
[39:25] is here this evening to convict you in
[39:27] your heart to bring you subject to the
[39:28] word of god that you'll lay down all
[39:30] your ideas and lay down everything that
[39:33] you thought was was right in your own
[39:34] mind and you'll follow the message of
[39:36] the hour regardless if you can't make
[39:39] sense of it but when the word is opened
[39:41] up to you and you know that it's god
[39:43] speaking to you it's not just a man's
[39:45] idea it's not just a theology it's not
[39:48] just a prophet's opinion oh but deity
[39:51] came down in the end time and he spoke a
[39:54] word to a bride and when that word
[39:56] strikes that seed on the inside
[39:58] something is quickened and brought forth
[40:00] to life it says yea an amen to the word
[40:03] you want to know whether you've got the
[40:04] holy ghost or not
[40:05] look at your life oh you say amen to the
[40:08] word if you're not saying amen to the
[40:10] word if you can look at the way you're
[40:12] living if you can look at the things
[40:14] that you're doing and see that you're
[40:15] not doing then your life is not saying
[40:18] amen to the word oh but let that
[40:20] quickening power come let it get shut up
[40:22] in your bones where there's a fire
[40:24] inside of you to serve the lord with all
[40:27] of your heart oh hallelujah then that's
[40:30] a life that's saying amen to the word
[40:34] it has an influence on you
[40:41] yeah i got the blood over here now what
[40:42] does it say do
[40:45] but upon the tables of your heart see
[40:47] the spirit covenant will i make with the
[40:49] people
[40:50] and it displays his power

[41:16] here

[41:43] uh children's book where we've all come
[41:46] together and we've heard some little
[41:47] fancy story about a prophet who had some
[41:50] signs about him no sir this is the end
[41:52] time revelation the very climax of god's
[41:56] great plan from the very beginning of
[41:58] the foundation of the world he saw fit
[42:00] that he'd have a bride standing in the
[42:02] end time that would be bone of his bone
[42:04] and flesh of his flesh and life of his
[42:06] life and power of his power there are
[42:09] the people that have gathered together
[42:10] in beverly that got the power of the
[42:13] holy ghost in action
[42:16] oh you might as well have a little fun
[42:17] tonight i feel the spirit of the lord
[42:19] you might as well just get a loosey
[42:20] goosey and just enjoy the presents
[42:22] that's what we come here for
[42:26] we get all starchy and come together all
[42:28] buttoned up in our little suits and we
[42:30] don't even know how to have a good time
[42:31] anymore you can go down to the ball
[42:33] games you can go down to the restaurant
[42:35] you got a smile on your face you're
[42:37] eating your little tacos you're just
[42:39] having a little good time but when you
[42:41] come to the house of god you sit there
[42:42] with folded arms you can't even have a
[42:44] good time what's the matter with us this
[42:46] is what you're living for
[42:49] i ain't living for the things out there
[42:51] in the world i'm living to be in the
[42:53] presence of almighty god you might as
[42:55] well start enjoying it because that's
[42:57] where you're going to spend all of
[42:58] eternity with him
[43:00] oh glory to god
[43:03] hallelujah
[43:05] oh it displays his power
[43:07] he that believeth on me the works
[43:09] that i do shall he do also
[43:13] and speaking on under the influence
[43:19] influence means the power or capacity
[43:23] of causing an
[43:24] effect in indirect or intangible ways
[43:28] i don't know if there's a handkerchief
[43:29] in my bag but if one of y'all can grab
[43:31] it
[43:33] i'm i'm good at doing that
[43:37] notice this it says influences the power
[43:40] or capacity
[43:42] of causing an effect it's in my black
[43:44] bag there on on the chair
[43:47] hopefully
[43:48] the power capacity of cause and effect
[43:51] in an indirect
[43:52] or intangible way
[43:55] it also means the act or power of
[43:57] producing an effect without apparent
[44:00] exertion
[44:01] of force
[44:02] or direct exercise of command
[44:05] you following that
[44:07] so there can be an influence upon
[44:09] something
[44:10] but you don't know where the influence
[44:12] is coming from
[44:14] i i i remember in in uh in sixth grade i
[44:17] did a little
[44:18] a project on magnets and i was just
[44:21] mesmerized by magnets
[44:24] you know you could you can take this
[44:26] magnet down here and maybe tie a string
[44:27] or something and you can make other
[44:29] things look like it's floating and
[44:30] suspended in air and and you know as you
[44:32] start you start getting it closer and
[44:35] closer together you start to feel the
[44:37] pull
[44:38] well glory to god that's just what
[44:40] happened in the end time down through
[44:42] luther down through the wesley until oh
[44:44] that word was gathered up into the seed
[44:46] and it was the rising of the sun and
[44:48] that great magnet of the son of man was
[44:51] shining forth in the ladies teen age and
[44:53] there was a wheat field full of seeds
[44:56] that were sprouting up oh they started
[44:58] to see that rising of the sun and
[45:00] they're getting closer they're getting
[45:01] closer all they just gets you just get
[45:02] pulled right to it
[45:05] that's what happens there's an invisible
[45:07] union look it's an unseen force
[45:10] something has taken place and you are
[45:13] magnetized to this word
[45:15] you heard that uh um you heard that uh
[45:19] how brother branham would talk about
[45:20] that story where where he went to that
[45:22] great factory and that magnet would
[45:24] sweep over uh uh uh all the metal parts
[45:27] and everything like that and brother
[45:28] brandon was watching it and all sudden
[45:30] all these things uh they would go up to
[45:32] the magnet but then other things would
[45:33] just lay there and brother ben said why
[45:35] is it that some of those things go up
[45:36] there but some of them stay there he
[45:38] goes well see you've got to be
[45:39] magnetized
[45:41] oh my what great inspiration you got to
[45:43] be magic you wonder why the preaching of
[45:45] this message has gone around the world
[45:47] seven times and men had stood and
[45:49] preached the message 40 50 60 years and
[45:51] people weren't drawn to it or they
[45:53] weren't magnetized to it or they walked
[45:55] away that's because there wasn't that
[45:58] that part of them that identified with
[46:00] that
[46:00] magnification
[46:02] thank you brother
[46:05] but something inside of you
[46:09] is magnetized to that
[46:12] there's something that god has placed
[46:14] into you oh and you're magnetized
[46:16] there's an influence on you right
[46:19] something is influenced and you don't
[46:21] you don't even know what it is
[46:24] praise god
[46:28] hallelujah
[46:30] we might be here a while
[46:33] but you but you watch that you can take
[46:35] you know you can put something on a
[46:36] table and put a little magnet under it
[46:38] and it looks like everything's fine it's
[46:39] just sitting there but start getting
[46:40] that that magnet a little bit closer and
[46:42] also it starts trembling
[46:44] it starts shaking why because it's
[46:46] coming under an influence oh many times
[46:49] children of god you don't know what's
[46:51] happening in your life but you're coming
[46:54] under the influence of the rising of the
[46:56] sun you're starting to come into the
[46:58] presence and all of a sudden there's an
[47:00] influence that's starting to have an
[47:02] effect on your life you're starting to
[47:04] shake you're starting to tremble you
[47:05] really don't know what's going on that's
[47:07] why because you're being attracted
[47:11] and it displays its power the works that
[47:14] i do shall you do also
[47:16] these signs shall follow them that
[47:19] believe
[47:20] oh yeah we've we've healed the sick
[47:23] we've laid hands on the sick they've
[47:24] recovered
[47:27] we we've we've laid our hands and cast
[47:29] out demons
[47:32] don't tell me i've seen it
[47:34] i've watched demons gnash their teeth in
[47:36] my face
[47:37] and talk in tongues
[47:40] had it happen this weekend
[47:43] i got witnesses that could testify of it
[47:46] and try to contact them
[47:47] try to ask them if they want deliverance
[47:49] from the spirit but they're under such
[47:51] bondage they're they're incoherent and
[47:53] they're speaking to you in tongues and
[47:55] gnashing their teeth with wide eyes and
[47:56] looking you right in the face
[47:58] a demon staring right back at you well
[48:00] you better know where you're standing
[48:02] because there is a power in this word
[48:08] i could stare right back at that demon
[48:10] and say all right if i can't contact the
[48:12] individual if i can't even ask the
[48:14] individual if they want deliverance then
[48:16] i know by divine promise that i can lay
[48:18] my hands on this person and i can cast
[48:20] that devil out
[48:22] and by divine promise we laid hands on
[48:24] that a brother we cast that spirit out
[48:28] and there he come into his sane mind
[48:32] we had more work to do
[48:35] he had more spirits
[48:38] it wasn't just one spirit
[48:40] it wasn't just two spirits
[48:44] but that religious spirit was cast off
[48:46] of him
[48:48] so we could ask him look do you want
[48:50] deliverance
[48:53] we could cast spirits off of people all
[48:55] day long
[48:58] only to see them again a week or two
[49:00] later
[49:01] with the same spirits back on them
[49:06] so
[49:07] so you know don't rejoice that the
[49:09] spiritual subject to you
[49:12] rejoice that your name is written in
[49:14] heaven look i i i i
[49:16] if i lay my hands on somebody and i can
[49:19] cast spirits off them i don't want it to
[49:21] stop there
[49:24] i want them to get the power of the holy
[49:26] ghost that they can live in overcoming
[49:28] life
[49:30] look what good does it do to come to
[49:31] church and get all enthused and get all
[49:34] excited and get into such an atmosphere
[49:36] because the prophet of god said it takes
[49:38] atmosphere to do things we come under
[49:40] this great atmosphere we come into this
[49:41] great expectation and the word of god is
[49:43] preaching you're raised up into heavenly
[49:45] places but what happens when you go
[49:47] outside of these doors when you go back
[49:49] out into the world you go back to your
[49:51] job and you go back to the friends what
[49:52] kind of life are you living what's your
[49:54] home life like what's the atmosphere
[49:56] like in your home
[49:58] i'm telling you if you're living below
[50:00] your privileges it's time to stop
[50:04] why would you go another evening
[50:09] without receiving what's
[50:11] what god purchased for you
[50:14] the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:16] complete deliverance
[50:21] just in speaking upon revelation
[50:24] revelation is a revealing or an
[50:26] unveiling
[50:28] right
[50:30] not not not not what you can
[50:32] uh think up in your mind not what you
[50:34] can understand but but revelation is a
[50:37] revealing or an unveiling like in john 6
[50:40] when
[50:40] when jesus would say i am the the living
[50:43] bread which came down from heaven if any
[50:45] man eat of this bread he shall live
[50:47] forever and the bread that i will give
[50:48] is my flesh which i will give for the
[50:51] life of the world
[50:53] oh the jews they strove amongst
[50:55] themselves and he said what is he
[50:56] talking about how can this man give us
[50:59] his flesh to eat look that's a good
[51:00] question
[51:01] don't sit in your seat and look i'm like
[51:03] well man a bunch of unbelievers no it's
[51:05] a good question
[51:06] how in the world hear this man say i am
[51:08] the bread that came down out of heaven
[51:10] look your father's diddy man in the
[51:11] wilderness and every one of them is dead
[51:13] but i am the bread of life that cometh
[51:16] down how is that going to happen i don't
[51:18] understand how are you going to give me
[51:20] your flesh to eat
[51:23] then jesus said unto them verily i say
[51:24] unto you except you eat the flesh of the
[51:27] son of man
[51:29] and drink his blood ye have no life in
[51:32] you
[51:34] oh what does that even mean i tell you
[51:36] we need a spiritual revelation we need
[51:39] an unveiling we read things in the
[51:41] scripture all the time and we chalk it
[51:43] up to some history lesson but i say the
[51:45] word of god is the same yesterday today
[51:48] and forever unless you eat this flesh
[51:52] unless you drink my blood
[51:54] you have no life in you
[51:57] oh what does all these things mean here
[51:59] they come to to the upper room it's the
[52:01] last supper and jesus is speaking to him
[52:03] in matthew 26 27 it says and he took the
[52:06] cup he gave thanks and he gave it to him
[52:08] saying drink ye all of it
[52:12] for this is the my blood of the new
[52:14] testament
[52:15] which is shed for many for the remission
[52:17] of sins
[52:19] look look peter you don't know what i'm
[52:21] doing right now
[52:24] you don't know what i'm doing right now
[52:25] peter oh lord why are you washing my
[52:28] feet uh if not don't wash my feet look
[52:30] if you don't wash your feet you have no
[52:31] part of me okay then watch my watch my
[52:33] head watch them no peter you don't
[52:34] understand you don't understand
[52:37] what i'm doing right now peter
[52:39] you don't understand what i'm doing
[52:42] take this cup
[52:44] drink this cup it's the new testament of
[52:46] my blood
[52:48] oh well he wasn't just setting forth
[52:50] ordinances for the church he was saying
[52:52] do this in remembrance of me why why
[52:54] peter look you don't understand these
[52:56] things but you're going to understand
[52:58] hereafter because i'm going to send the
[53:00] holy ghost upon you i'm going to send
[53:02] you the great comforter he's going to
[53:04] teach you and lead you in all truth and
[53:06] righteousness that's what the church
[53:08] needs this evening we need the great
[53:09] comforter we need the tutor to lead us
[53:12] and guide us in all truth and
[53:13] righteousness you wonder why you're
[53:14] stumbling and going along the way that
[53:16] you are and you're not living an
[53:18] overcoming life it's because you need
[53:20] the baptism of the holy ghost i wonder
[53:22] if there's somebody here that'll get in
[53:24] desperation and you'll start crying out
[53:26] you'll start hungering you won't settle
[53:28] for just a bunch of education you won't
[53:30] understand for just a message theology
[53:32] but something in you is crying out for
[53:34] the influence of the holy ghost to break
[53:36] out on the inside of you and bring your
[53:38] life into subjection to the word of god
[53:40] of the hour oh glory to god ye must be
[53:43] born again i want the holy ghost and
[53:46] fire to quicken my mortal body
[53:48] hallelujah
[53:51] oh quickening power
[53:59] prophet says in the fourth seal
[54:01] now just think of the things we're
[54:03] coming through
[54:04] let you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[54:07] take this
[54:08] cup this is the blood
[54:12] of the new testament
[54:14] we're having communion now
[54:17] right
[54:19] we're eating it's flesh
[54:20] we're drinking his blood when we come to
[54:22] together in communion we're doing it in
[54:24] remembrance of him what what is this
[54:26] symbolize what what does this mean lord
[54:29] what is this all about the prophet of
[54:30] god would say now as oil symbolizes the
[54:33] holy spirit
[54:39] then we find out oil and wine is
[54:41] connected together in worship
[54:44] see always connected in worship
[54:46] and the wine i said
[54:48] which to me that the wine symbolizes
[54:52] that it was the power
[54:54] maybe i can bring me some paper towels
[54:55] or something
[55:00] please
[55:03] i can hardly see up here
[55:06] give me an old shirt give me something
[55:10] hallelujah glory everybody feeling all
[55:12] right
[55:13] i'm feeling pretty good
[55:16] i hope you feel all right
[55:18] don't let that bother you don't bother
[55:20] me
[55:21] god's gonna have his will god's gonna
[55:22] have his way
[55:23] i hope there's still some hungry hearts
[55:25] don't check out yet god got something
[55:27] for you
[55:29] god got something for you you don't you
[55:31] don't watch a show or you don't you
[55:32] don't put on something to watch and
[55:34] check out halfway through do you
[55:36] know you want to stay there for the
[55:37] climax well by god's grace he got a
[55:39] climax for you he got something he wants
[55:41] to deliver to you now that's what i'm
[55:42] talking about bring the whole roll
[55:43] praise god
[55:46] hallelujah
[55:51] i feel lost without that hanky
[55:54] i don't know why it seems like that's
[55:55] one of my greatest struggles to get get
[55:57] a get a handkerchief to the platform
[56:00] maybe i'll just start sewing them to my
[56:01] shirt
[56:04] then if i don't have one we're all in
[56:06] trouble
[56:07] all right and the wine i said which to
[56:09] me that the wine symbolizes now follow
[56:12] this thought here right let's try to
[56:13] pull it together here uh uh jesus said
[56:16] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[56:17] blood what does all this mean the
[56:19] prophet is picking this up in the forest
[56:20] seal he goes now oil symbolizes the holy
[56:22] spirit then we find out that oil and
[56:25] wine is connected together in worship
[56:28] see always connected in worship and the
[56:30] wine i said which to me that the wine
[56:32] symbolizes that it was the power it was
[56:35] the power of stimulation
[56:38] by revelation and that's when something
[56:41] has been
[56:42] revealed oh hallelujah that look
[56:47] stimulation by revelation so stimulation
[56:50] by revelation comes when something has
[56:53] been revealed or when your understanding
[56:55] is opened
[56:57] the pro our pastor was preaching on the
[56:59] opening of your understanding out of the
[57:01] rising of the sun because something is
[57:03] going to transpire that opens up your
[57:07] understanding that quickens your mortal
[57:10] body into a reality of the power of god
[57:13] in your life oh thank you jesus and
[57:16] that's when something has been revealed
[57:17] it gives stimulation to the believer
[57:20] because it's presented by revelation see
[57:22] it's something that god has said it's a
[57:25] mystery they can't understand it see and
[57:27] after a while god comes down and reveals
[57:31] it and then it's vending and then
[57:33] vindicates it
[57:40] it's something that god has said it's a
[57:42] mystery
[57:44] they can't understand it oh
[57:46] well put your spiritual thinking caps on
[57:52] they can't understand it
[57:54] just go ahead and hold up the whole
[57:55] bible
[57:56] men have been probing at this
[57:59] for 2000 years
[58:03] having a portion or a measure of it it
[58:06] was a mystery but when the seals were
[58:08] open what did the prophet said he said
[58:10] it became a brand new book it's a
[58:13] mystery they can't understand it's he
[58:15] but after a while
[58:17] god comes down
[58:20] god comes down
[58:23] oh hallelujah god comes down and reveals
[58:27] it and then vindicates it
[58:30] oh my glory to god i had i wrote down a
[58:32] little here no here our pastor said he
[58:35] said spiritual revealed word
[58:38] that will cause you to do what you do
[58:41] spiritual revealed word that will cause
[58:43] you to do what you do
[58:45] this is also quoting our pastor he said
[58:47] the opening of the un the opening of
[58:49] understanding is the key to move forward
[58:53] pray for revelation
[58:55] he said pray for revelation the church
[58:58] never understands the importance of
[59:00] revelation
[59:02] god cannot move you forward without
[59:04] increasing your understanding
[59:07] that's what our pastor said on sunday
[59:09] god cannot move you forward without
[59:12] increasing
[59:14] your understanding
[59:15] we ought to start praying for revelation
[59:18] we need to pray that god would continue
[59:20] to open our understanding i think a lot
[59:23] of times we get too comfortable
[59:26] with the understanding and the
[59:28] revelation that we have and we're just
[59:30] fine we got it from here god thanks for
[59:32] calling me out of the world thanks for
[59:34] giving me a good job thanks for giving
[59:36] me a home and a nice family but i can
[59:39] take it from here lord i'm pretty
[59:41] comfortable living the way that i'm
[59:42] living i'm pretty comfortable
[59:44] understanding malachi 4
[59:46] luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7 i kind
[59:49] of got that all buttoned up so i can be
[59:51] in my little social circle i can call
[59:53] myself a believer i can travel around
[59:55] the globe and hug everybody's neck but
[59:57] am i really pressing into the kingdom am
[1:00:00] i really living an overcoming life am i
[1:00:02] really hungering and thirsting for
[1:00:04] righteousness am i really praying for
[1:00:06] revelation and asking god to open my
[1:00:08] understanding are you going to your
[1:00:10] knees are you putting on the prophet's
[1:00:12] message are you listening to a tape and
[1:00:14] saying oh god reveal the message of the
[1:00:16] hour to me let me catch that are you
[1:00:18] rewinding it and going back you ever
[1:00:20] listen to the prophet's voice say i want
[1:00:22] to hear it again and you backed up 30
[1:00:24] seconds and you do it over and over and
[1:00:26] over and something in your heart is
[1:00:28] saying lord i want to understand it i
[1:00:30] want to catch it lord reveal it to me
[1:00:32] and you're praying for the revelation
[1:00:33] have you ever opened up your bible and
[1:00:35] you read a scripture anywhere in the
[1:00:37] bible and it says knowing that he which
[1:00:39] was raised up the lord jesus shall raise
[1:00:41] up also by jesus and shall present us
[1:00:43] with you for all things are for your
[1:00:45] sakes that the abundance grace might
[1:00:47] through the thanksgiving of many rebound
[1:00:49] to the glory of god oh do we just blow
[1:00:51] right over you say lord really what are
[1:00:53] you saying i want to see jesus christ in
[1:00:55] every line
[1:00:58] oh god open up our understanding
[1:01:03] look if if we're not careful we get
[1:01:04] satisfied with education
[1:01:07] we we get satisfied with knowing about
[1:01:10] the power
[1:01:14] and not displaying the power
[1:01:18] look i don't want to settle for an
[1:01:19] explanation of the message
[1:01:21] i don't want to just
[1:01:22] i just have a good education
[1:01:25] look why do you go to college
[1:01:28] to get an education
[1:01:31] and several
[1:01:33] hundred thousand dollars in debt many
[1:01:34] times
[1:01:37] what are you going to do with it
[1:01:40] is that your badge of honor yeah it's
[1:01:42] great when you graduate college
[1:01:44] but it's really great when you get a job
[1:01:54] kids we're proud of you
[1:01:56] you've been in school through 12th grade
[1:01:58] and you graduated that's great
[1:02:01] it'll be really great when you get a job
[1:02:04] that's why you're going
[1:02:07] you're going to college to get an
[1:02:09] education to be put to work
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:14] so we we come to the house of god we
[1:02:16] read our bibles we pray we we're getting
[1:02:19] an education we're listening to the
[1:02:21] world i'll tell you what i think a lot
[1:02:22] of us have been in boot camp too long
[1:02:25] what are you interests for the military
[1:02:28] right they ship you off to boot camp you
[1:02:30] go to boot camp for six months or so so
[1:02:32] they can put you into service
[1:02:35] a lot of you have been in boot camp for
[1:02:37] 10 years on the pew and you've never
[1:02:39] gone out in the battle
[1:02:41] every time something gets a little uh a
[1:02:44] little tough on you you gotta run to the
[1:02:46] church house you gotta run to big
[1:02:48] brother you gotta run somewhere you
[1:02:50] gotta run back to your drill sergeant
[1:02:54] oh oh drill sergeant how did we do that
[1:02:56] again
[1:02:59] well the drill sergeant was like look
[1:03:01] this is what the great captain taught us
[1:03:04] this is the what the great captain of
[1:03:05] the army taught him when that drill
[1:03:07] sergeant can look at you like look now
[1:03:08] son
[1:03:11] i've done all i can do for you
[1:03:14] i've taught you how to fire the gun i've
[1:03:16] taught you how to march i i've i've
[1:03:18] walked you through the book and shown
[1:03:20] you how to dress and to talk and
[1:03:22] everything but i tell you what if you'll
[1:03:24] just get the life of the captain inside
[1:03:26] of you
[1:03:28] you won't have to run back here anymore
[1:03:32] because the word will be written in your
[1:03:33] heart oh i'll make a new covenant with
[1:03:35] you there is power in the blood there's
[1:03:38] power in the word and if you'll ever get
[1:03:41] born again and filled with the look i'm
[1:03:43] not knocking you it's okay
[1:03:45] uh we're here for you the church is here
[1:03:47] for you but i'm saying there's higher
[1:03:49] heights for you to walk in
[1:03:51] that when you're out there on the
[1:03:54] enemy's grounds or you're out there and
[1:03:56] the enemy comes and tries to take you
[1:03:58] down he's going to knock on the door and
[1:04:01] it's not going to be little on you
[1:04:02] anymore he's knocking on but it's going
[1:04:04] to open up and say hi i'm jesus christ
[1:04:06] the one that defeated you on calvary
[1:04:09] that's what you want on the inside
[1:04:12] you want jesus christ the word the
[1:04:14] quickening power that quickens your
[1:04:16] mortal body to put the word into action
[1:04:22] oh my
[1:04:25] education
[1:04:27] i think a lot of us settle
[1:04:30] for education
[1:04:32] we settle for second-hand revelation
[1:04:35] right
[1:04:38] oh yeah
[1:04:43] i pulled this quote in here i really
[1:04:45] like it because this brother comes to
[1:04:46] brother branham and say now brother
[1:04:48] branham you know
[1:04:49] uh you really he's basically telling
[1:04:51] them you need to get educated you know
[1:04:53] the people you know you're kind of
[1:04:54] offended of the people you keep saying
[1:04:55] pulpit
[1:04:58] you keep saying pull pit it it's it's
[1:05:01] pulp i don't even know how to say it
[1:05:02] right myself
[1:05:03] but he he was telling brother brandon
[1:05:05] you're not educated you keep saying pull
[1:05:06] pit and it's pulpit it's pulpit
[1:05:10] and he's telling telling his brother you
[1:05:11] know they care brother that these people
[1:05:13] they they're educated brother branham
[1:05:15] said he goes well my beloved brother i
[1:05:17] differ with you then people don't care
[1:05:18] whether i say pulpit or pulpit the thing
[1:05:21] they want me to do is preach the word
[1:05:24] and live what i'm talking about
[1:05:26] i said that's the main thing so christ
[1:05:28] doesn't come by education christ comes
[1:05:31] by a surrendered heart believing him now
[1:05:33] education's fine but it will never
[1:05:36] substitute salvation it can't and but in
[1:05:39] them days the people had got away as
[1:05:41] soon as education comes in the
[1:05:44] phenomenon leaves the church oh my
[1:05:47] listen to it now as soon as education
[1:05:49] comes in the phenomenon leaves the
[1:05:52] church christ leaves he can't stand it
[1:05:54] they get so smart they know more than he
[1:05:56] does so the scripture is not given by
[1:05:59] education it's given by revelation not
[1:06:03] education revelation oh god open up our
[1:06:07] understanding that we might come under a
[1:06:09] revelation that is going to influence in
[1:06:11] such a way that there is stimulation by
[1:06:14] revelation that affects the way that we
[1:06:16] think it affects the way that we talk it
[1:06:19] affects the way that we dress
[1:06:24] look i like me some food
[1:06:28] i guess nobody else does
[1:06:30] i like some food
[1:06:33] you know you go out to a restaurant
[1:06:36] and uh oh you sit down and maybe you
[1:06:38] study over the menu
[1:06:40] and you look look at the menu and then
[1:06:41] you ask the server you say oh hey what
[1:06:43] should i order
[1:06:45] and i i think you should
[1:06:47] i'll tell you what's really good you
[1:06:48] ought to get the almond crusted
[1:06:51] mahi mahi with parmesan crumbles and a
[1:06:53] cherry wine sauce to top it off it's
[1:06:55] just
[1:06:57] like man
[1:06:59] that sounds pretty good right now i
[1:07:01] could go for some ima with the parmesan
[1:07:03] incredibles crust and all that sounds
[1:07:04] pretty good don't it
[1:07:06] and it starts to have an effect on you
[1:07:07] go well to the server you're like
[1:07:10] how is it do you like it
[1:07:13] oh i've never had it
[1:07:18] and you look at them and all of a sudden
[1:07:20] you realize that they're just speaking
[1:07:23] from education
[1:07:25] they're not speaking
[1:07:27] from an experience they haven't tasted
[1:07:29] it for themselves but i love it when you
[1:07:31] go to the restaurant oh you can tell if
[1:07:33] somebody's had it before you say what
[1:07:34] should i order like oh man i get this i
[1:07:36] eat this two times every time i come in
[1:07:38] i reckon you can actually tell they're
[1:07:40] speaking with some conviction
[1:07:43] they actually know
[1:07:44] what they're talking about because
[1:07:46] they've actually eaten it david said oh
[1:07:48] taste and see that the lord is good i
[1:07:52] wonder if there's somebody in the house
[1:07:53] of god that has actually tasted
[1:07:56] and seen that the lord is good oh my
[1:07:59] when you get a revelation of this
[1:08:01] message when you have taken a bite off
[1:08:04] of this body word son of man and you've
[1:08:06] chewed it up and you've digested it oh
[1:08:09] and you've gotten a little stimulation
[1:08:12] of revelation oh it does something to
[1:08:14] your body
[1:08:17] i'll have what he's having
[1:08:20] i have what he's having give me a little
[1:08:22] of that oh you get some brothers after
[1:08:23] the service they've heard a good word
[1:08:25] what are you doing they're licking the
[1:08:26] honey off of one another oh give me some
[1:08:28] of that i want a little of what he's
[1:08:30] having
[1:08:32] oh get a little understanding
[1:08:34] get a little education
[1:08:36] no yeah it's good to hear the word but
[1:08:39] you got to be a doer of the word
[1:08:43] listen to this quote
[1:08:44] thank you brother cosman we have time
[1:08:48] everybody with me
[1:08:52] the rise in the sun maybe if you you can
[1:08:54] pull that up
[1:08:55] paragraph 216.
[1:08:57] i believe our pastor just went down
[1:08:59] these lines
[1:09:11] the rising of the sun
[1:09:12] paragraph 216
[1:09:15] says your body ain't subject to sin no
[1:09:17] more
[1:09:19] your desires
[1:09:22] he said come out here you say shut your
[1:09:24] mouth
[1:09:26] oh we got the biggest shot in your mouth
[1:09:29] my you're an eagle right when the devil
[1:09:31] comes around when when he starts talking
[1:09:33] this this gibberish to you and
[1:09:34] everything what do you say shut your
[1:09:35] mouth
[1:09:36] you're an eagle
[1:09:38] did you ever see how independent an old
[1:09:40] eagle walks
[1:09:42] he don't hop like a vulture
[1:09:46] see to every dead and all the carrion
[1:09:48] laying on the ground no sir he walks
[1:09:50] proud shut your mouth
[1:09:53] oh here is a good dinner over here
[1:09:56] not for me see my desires has changed my
[1:09:59] appetite is different for man shall not
[1:10:02] live on the world a carry-on alone but
[1:10:05] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:10:08] mouth of god a genuine quickened eagle
[1:10:12] lives by that amen oh he he is raised up
[1:10:17] christ from the grave dwelling you has
[1:10:20] quickened your mortal body unto his
[1:10:22] presence you recognize it you are no
[1:10:25] longer a scavenger you're an eagle i
[1:10:27] want to take a little bit on that you
[1:10:29] are no longer a scavenger
[1:10:32] do you know what a scavenger is
[1:10:35] a scavenger eats on dead things or
[1:10:37] decaying things now that is your old
[1:10:40] nature
[1:10:42] remember we ministered a while back when
[1:10:43] the holy ghost comes in the prophet of
[1:10:46] god uh was given testimony uh to the uh
[1:10:50] uh i forget the brother's name there in
[1:10:51] south africa he was given the testimony
[1:10:53] he said when the holy ghost comes in
[1:10:56] it burns out the old nature and it's
[1:10:59] behind you now that old nature behind
[1:11:02] you is a scavenger
[1:11:04] but it's wanting to influence you
[1:11:07] it's wanting to have a position of
[1:11:10] influence in your life so real quickly
[1:11:12] when you find yourself feeding on the
[1:11:14] things of the world
[1:11:18] scavenger
[1:11:20] hopping from one thing to the next we we
[1:11:22] i tell you what we got some we got some
[1:11:24] digital scavengers
[1:11:27] if we're ever living in an age
[1:11:30] where we can hop from this dead decaying
[1:11:32] dying thing to the next it's this age
[1:11:35] and if you ever find yourself scrolling
[1:11:38] or or listening
[1:11:40] or watching and jumping from this thing
[1:11:43] to the next thing that is a scavenger
[1:11:46] nature
[1:11:50] i wonder if you've ever rolled through
[1:11:52] the message in the bible like that
[1:11:57] have you ever just put in parentheses
[1:11:59] son of man
[1:12:02] and just walked through the bible in the
[1:12:04] message
[1:12:05] oh you're so educated and you work that
[1:12:08] phone and that computer so well but you
[1:12:10] can't do it for god
[1:12:13] you think it's a coincidence we have the
[1:12:14] table
[1:12:16] or is that something god gave us
[1:12:19] do you think it's a coincidence that we
[1:12:21] can plug in
[1:12:23] a phrase and search it
[1:12:26] and find out what thus saith the lord
[1:12:28] said about it
[1:12:29] look i tell you what it fixed a lot of
[1:12:31] problems in the message can somebody say
[1:12:33] amen there were men going around giving
[1:12:36] what their understanding of the message
[1:12:38] was and saying brother branham said this
[1:12:41] and brother branham said that and having
[1:12:43] confidence in a man who was charismatic
[1:12:46] you would take that word or that
[1:12:47] understanding and say my i wonder that
[1:12:50] the prophet said that and then blue and
[1:12:52] behold god gives us the whole message so
[1:12:54] at the touch of your fingertips you can
[1:12:56] type in anything you can search it out
[1:12:58] and you come to find out how you never
[1:13:00] said that
[1:13:05] please
[1:13:06] whatever comes over this pulpit i know i
[1:13:09] got a full uh support from my pastor
[1:13:12] said search it out in the message
[1:13:15] [Music]
[1:13:18] search it out in the bible but my
[1:13:20] goodness uh the world has its search
[1:13:23] engines
[1:13:27] and boy we just put those to good use
[1:13:29] why don't you put those that hunger and
[1:13:32] thirst after right that's your search
[1:13:34] engine why don't you start searching the
[1:13:36] search to the scriptures in them you
[1:13:38] think you have eternal life but there
[1:13:40] they that testify of the message of the
[1:13:43] hour the rising of the sun the son of
[1:13:45] man ministry the mighty angel coming
[1:13:48] down putting one foot on land and one on
[1:13:50] sea and loosen the seven seals
[1:13:53] why don't you search that put that
[1:13:56] in your search engine
[1:13:58] you're not a scavenger
[1:14:00] quit feeding on that nonsense
[1:14:03] we got to come together church
[1:14:05] we got real needs and real people in
[1:14:07] bondage in our church
[1:14:11] it's going to take all of us together
[1:14:14] whether prophet god say you want to see
[1:14:16] somebody you want to see something big
[1:14:17] you want to see the third pool really do
[1:14:18] something
[1:14:20] it takes all of us together
[1:14:23] what are you doing on your computer at
[1:14:25] 10 at night 12 at night two in the
[1:14:26] morning
[1:14:29] it's a curse
[1:14:32] are we so blind church
[1:14:35] to realize we're living in the hour
[1:14:38] of the coming of the lord
[1:14:40] we have heard the shout
[1:14:42] out christ has come to unite himself
[1:14:45] with the pride and what are we doing
[1:14:49] i think it's a paradox
[1:14:53] look up your redemption drawleth
[1:14:59] hold on
[1:15:02] look up here no i'm too busy looking
[1:15:04] down god
[1:15:08] i think it's a paradox
[1:15:10] in the hour
[1:15:11] when any chart should really be looking
[1:15:13] up your redemption draws an eye
[1:15:15] we got our heads buried in some
[1:15:17] information and some education that has
[1:15:19] nothing to do with where we're going
[1:15:21] yeah i get on my hobby horse every once
[1:15:22] in a while and it needs to be said but

[1:22:39] oh you think i'm beside my yeah i'm a
[1:22:41] little stimulated
[1:22:45] because when you get a little revelation
[1:22:47] it comes with a little stimulation
[1:22:53] what happens you start talking funny
[1:22:57] you start walking funny
[1:23:00] look i hate to say it
[1:23:02] all right we're gone now we're off the
[1:23:04] notes
[1:23:04] let's have church look i hate to say it
[1:23:08] but i've been drunk before
[1:23:11] and you know what i've actually gotten
[1:23:13] arrested for being publicly intoxicated
[1:23:16] yeah it's a shame
[1:23:18] but you know what something had got an
[1:23:21] influence over my body where i wasn't
[1:23:22] acting normal
[1:23:24] i wasn't talking normal
[1:23:27] and it was obvious to the public
[1:23:32] so you know what they did
[1:23:35] they arrested me
[1:23:37] because i was talking funny
[1:23:40] i was walking funny and i was acting
[1:23:43] funny
[1:23:45] now the prophet of god said that
[1:23:47] stimulation of revelation he said the
[1:23:49] way wine makes a natural man act
[1:23:53] he said revelation does the same thing
[1:23:55] to a believer
[1:23:57] what do you think happened to them on
[1:23:59] the day of pentecost when tongues like
[1:24:01] fire like a rushing mighty wind came
[1:24:04] breaking down upon them and they were
[1:24:05] filled with all he goes oh they started
[1:24:08] talking different they started acting
[1:24:10] different they busted out of the door
[1:24:12] and you know what they were publicly
[1:24:13] intoxicated
[1:24:15] oh watch it brother matthew you're
[1:24:17] talking about being drunk no these men
[1:24:20] aren't drunk as you suppose but this is
[1:24:22] that which the prophet joel prophesied i
[1:24:24] will send my spirit upon them they'll
[1:24:26] speak in new tongues they'll dream
[1:24:28] dreams they'll have visions what is it
[1:24:30] it's the power of the holy ghost is
[1:24:32] there a church tonight that believes
[1:24:34] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:24:37] today and forever and you're not afraid
[1:24:38] of a little stimulation
[1:24:44] watch out brother matthew you're getting
[1:24:46] fanatical now well that's true
[1:24:50] that's true
[1:24:52] maybe i'll just read what the prophet
[1:24:53] said
[1:24:56] oh my where are we at now
[1:25:00] prophet of god said oh the greatest
[1:25:01] pleasure i know of
[1:25:03] is to be prayed up until i can realize
[1:25:04] that i'm in the presence of god
[1:25:06] and recognize it
[1:25:08] i think that ought to be the thrill of
[1:25:10] the church is the presence of the holy
[1:25:12] ghost seeing that god that made the
[1:25:14] promise standing among us
[1:25:17] feel his presence and see his word and
[1:25:19] see it vindicated it ought to give faith
[1:25:22] to make cripples walk
[1:25:24] blind see deaf here
[1:25:27] and dumb speak
[1:25:29] oh can you smell that church
[1:25:32] can you hear that
[1:25:35] what is it brother matthew
[1:25:36] the chef's cooking up something
[1:25:40] i think i think your order's being ready

[1:25:44] brother matthew that sounds kind of
[1:25:46] weird well that's all right

[1:38:41] we have a divine promise if you're
[1:38:42] battling something we cast that devil
[1:38:44] out
[1:38:45] and you have a divine promise if you've
[1:38:46] repented of your sins you shall receive
[1:38:49] the gift of the holy ghost you can
[1:38:50] receive the gift of the holy ghost while
[1:38:52] we're preaching the word you can receive
[1:38:53] the holy ghost by the laying of hands
[1:38:55] you can receive the holy ghost why don't
[1:38:57] you receive the holy ghost
[1:38:59] it's a promise to you
[1:39:01] the prophet of god says this
[1:39:04] make some lanes out there i'm about to
[1:39:06] take off
[1:39:08] now oil typifies the spirit
[1:39:11] and wine simulates a stimulation of
[1:39:13] revelation
[1:39:15] oh i like to run all over the place
[1:39:18] wonder i didn't wake up the neighborhood
[1:39:22] when the lord showed me that
[1:39:24] stimulation of revelation see oil and
[1:39:27] wine in the bible is associated together
[1:39:29] always i got the coordinates on it and
[1:39:32] look there's a string of them like that
[1:39:34] where wine and oil goes together all the
[1:39:36] time when the truth of the promised word
[1:39:38] of god has been truly revealed to his
[1:39:41] saints that's filled with oil they all
[1:39:44] get stimulated
[1:39:46] wine is a stimulation glory i feel it
[1:39:50] right now stimulated with joy shouts see
[1:39:54] when it does it has the same effect upon
[1:39:56] them that wine does upon the natural man
[1:40:02] well go ahead and criticize it when
[1:40:03] somebody gets all
[1:40:05] loopy
[1:40:07] acting funny
[1:40:08] i'm just saying what the prophet said
[1:40:12] because the revelation it has the same
[1:40:15] effect upon him that wine does upon the
[1:40:17] natural man because when the revelation
[1:40:20] has been given of the truth of god and
[1:40:22] the true believer filled with oil and
[1:40:24] the revelation is revealed the
[1:40:26] stimulation becomes so great
[1:40:29] that it makes him behave himself on
[1:40:31] normally right
[1:40:32] glory the congregation rejoices they're
[1:40:35] screaming and they're shouting and the
[1:40:37] prophet of god says see that's what's
[1:40:39] the matter with them now that's right
[1:40:41] makes them behave themselves unseemly
[1:40:44] now if you want a scripture for this
[1:40:45] just start reading acts 2 oh glory to
[1:40:48] god they were gathered there in the
[1:40:50] upper room what did jesus tell and
[1:40:52] behold i send the promise of my father
[1:40:55] upon you but tarry ye in the city of
[1:40:57] jerusalem until you be endured with
[1:40:59] power from on high look just stay there
[1:41:02] until the promise of my father is
[1:41:04] quickened stay there until the promise
[1:41:06] becomes a reality stay there until god
[1:41:09] interprets his promised word by bringing
[1:41:11] it to pass stay in his promised word
[1:41:13] until it becomes life in you his spirit
[1:41:18] the musicians will come
[1:41:22] once they got it they were stimulated
[1:41:25] by revelation they were under the
[1:41:26] influence
[1:41:28] of the holy ghost
[1:41:29] they weren't scared no more
[1:41:34] they come out talking funny
[1:41:36] acting funny
[1:41:38] completely transformed they were
[1:41:40] publicly intoxicated
[1:41:42] by the holy ghost
[1:41:46] the prophet goes on to say look
[1:41:49] there has to be an effect
[1:41:52] of the quickening power in your life
[1:41:55] that brings forth a change
[1:42:00] revelation changes you
[1:42:04] stimulation of revelation makes you act
[1:42:07] different
[1:42:10] the reason why you're struggling with
[1:42:12] the same things
[1:42:13] look
[1:42:14] look if you're a son or daughter of god
[1:42:17] he's going to rebuke and chasten you
[1:42:20] be thankful for that
[1:42:23] this is not condemnation because there's
[1:42:24] no condemnation to them that in christ
[1:42:26] jesus
[1:42:27] this is the drill sergeant saying hey
[1:42:29] we're going to war this is how we do
[1:42:30] things
[1:42:32] we got to fight a battle
[1:42:34] so so what are they what do they call
[1:42:36] insanity if you keep doing something
[1:42:37] over and over and you get the same
[1:42:38] results that's insanity right but they
[1:42:40] say something like that if you keep
[1:42:42] running in the same thing over and over
[1:42:44] and over and you're not living an
[1:42:45] overcoming life that's the grace of god
[1:42:48] showing you allowing you to come to the
[1:42:50] trial allowing you to come to the battle
[1:42:53] showing you that look my son my daughter
[1:42:55] i actually have more for you there's an
[1:42:58] opening of your understanding and a
[1:43:00] revelation that i can give you that will
[1:43:03] so stimulate you that'll make you so
[1:43:06] intoxicated by the word of the hour by
[1:43:08] my flesh that i give you to eat and by
[1:43:11] my blood that i give you to drink that
[1:43:13] you'll be so stimulated with revelation
[1:43:15] you'll start talking different you'll
[1:43:17] start acting different you'll start
[1:43:19] walking different you'll start dressing
[1:43:21] different you'll start testifying to
[1:43:23] your neighbors and to your boss and to
[1:43:25] everybody around you while that's what
[1:43:27] happens to drunk people everybody in the
[1:43:30] town just knows that they're the town
[1:43:32] drunk i think somebody ought to get so
[1:43:35] stimulated with the message of the hour
[1:43:37] that everybody in the town knows that
[1:43:40] you're a message believer
[1:43:44] oh but brother matthew they'll shut us
[1:43:45] down
[1:43:47] well that's all right
[1:43:49] they tried to shut the apostles down
[1:43:53] they were scared because why
[1:43:56] they didn't want to get shut down they
[1:43:58] had actually taken their captain and
[1:43:59] crucified him
[1:44:03] but when the life that was in the
[1:44:04] captain came back on them they didn't
[1:44:05] care anymore
[1:44:07] you can't shut me up anymore
[1:44:09] i got a story to tell
[1:44:12] that same jesus who you crucified
[1:44:15] oh hallelujah the same jesus that struck
[1:44:17] me down on the road to damascus oh glory
[1:44:20] to god he told me to rise up paul i got
[1:44:22] something for you to do rise up right i
[1:44:25] got something for you to do i got a
[1:44:27] testimony for you to live out before
[1:44:29] lady will see you let's all stand
[1:44:35] well here's my
[1:44:38] here's my inspiration
[1:44:40] oh i love this quote right here
[1:44:47] stay with me for a moment
[1:44:52] then i can see simon
[1:44:54] because he had the keys you know
[1:44:56] now wait a minute boys
[1:44:59] this scripture has something to say
[1:45:01] about this
[1:45:03] he never told us just how many days to
[1:45:05] wait
[1:45:05] he said you stay there until
[1:45:08] you stay there until joel's prophecy
[1:45:10] comes to pass until isaiah's prophecy is
[1:45:12] vindicated for with stammering lips and
[1:45:14] with other tongues will i speak to this
[1:45:16] people and this is the refreshment
[1:45:21] this is the refreshment
[1:45:23] does anybody want a refreshment
[1:45:26] maybe you've lost the joy of your
[1:45:27] salvation
[1:45:30] maybe you've gotten cold
[1:45:34] god's dealing with hearts right now
[1:45:38] god's speaking to you why don't you let
[1:45:39] him deal with your heart
[1:45:44] and this is the refreshment
[1:45:47] this is the wine that's poured out
[1:45:50] what is wine
[1:45:52] in the bible
[1:45:54] refreshments
[1:45:57] this is the refreshments that comes
[1:46:00] from the presence of the lord
[1:46:02] see it's got to be scriptural now see
[1:46:05] so you see wine represents stimulation
[1:46:07] of revelation and when the holy ghost
[1:46:10] fell
[1:46:14] everybody
[1:46:18] look inwardly don't look on on others
[1:46:21] right now
[1:46:26] you see wine represents stimulation of
[1:46:28] revelation when the holy ghost fell and
[1:46:30] they seen the fire of god fall upon them
[1:46:32] my that began to stimulate them
[1:46:34] and the first thing you know
[1:46:36] they got so stimulated till the people
[1:46:39] actually thought they were drunk
[1:46:43] but they were stimulated
[1:46:47] by revelation
[1:46:50] oh god if you've ever been stimulated by
[1:46:52] revelation
[1:46:57] so
[1:46:58] we could tell some testimonies
[1:47:01] here it is
[1:47:03] god's vindicated revelation made plain
[1:47:05] to them
[1:47:06] they was happy about it
[1:47:08] god promised it here it was revealed to
[1:47:11] them and vindicated them here was a man
[1:47:14] standing there saying this is that this
[1:47:17] is it and there it was being vindicated
[1:47:20] by the same size that we have today
[1:47:22] there is stimulation
[1:47:24] by revelation they really had it
[1:47:27] now i want to tell you there's a
[1:47:28] presence of god here right now
[1:47:32] that's moving
[1:47:34] amongst the people
[1:47:37] look church we're writing another book
[1:47:38] of acts
[1:47:41] that is not something for the future
[1:47:44] because the same life that is in the
[1:47:46] vine is in the branches
[1:47:49] he said i am the vine you are the
[1:47:51] branches
[1:47:52] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:47:54] spirit and life oh help me i'm looking
[1:47:56] for a place to close but god's dealing
[1:47:57] with hearts right now
[1:47:59] why don't you open up your heart and
[1:48:00] receive it
[1:48:04] why don't you confess
[1:48:06] that you're not living where you should
[1:48:08] be living
[1:48:09] why don't you confess that you know what
[1:48:11] i've been coming to church not not to
[1:48:13] man but in your heart to god and say
[1:48:15] lord i've been coming here long enough
[1:48:17] and i've been blending in but i want
[1:48:20] stimulation of revelation i realize that
[1:48:22] i'm not acting right in my home i
[1:48:24] realize that i'm not acting right with
[1:48:26] my friends i realize that this spirit
[1:48:28] that's supposed to come upon me and the
[1:48:30] believer and quicken the mortal body has
[1:48:33] not happened in my life don't be
[1:48:35] condemned that means it's here to
[1:48:37] quicken you
[1:48:38] just stimulate you and open up your
[1:48:40] understanding
[1:48:43] oh praise this wonderful name what are
[1:48:44] we playing
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:49] what
[1:48:52] you unravel me

[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:03] i know it's a wednesday night but let's
[1:49:04] all do with your heart
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:24] i
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:49] i just want to say this as we
[1:49:51] take it just lightly play
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:55] the world's going one way
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:50:00] it's a time of decision church
[1:50:04] you can't be a scavenger anymore
[1:50:08] it's too late an hour
[1:50:10] the world's going off into complete
[1:50:12] apostasy complete a sanity
[1:50:16] they're under an influence
[1:50:18] of the devil they're under the influence
[1:50:20] of the god of this evil age
[1:50:23] but there is an influence of the holy
[1:50:25] ghost
[1:50:26] there is an influence that the bride of
[1:50:28] jesus christ
[1:50:30] is under
[1:50:32] that's taken us beyond the camp of
[1:50:34] tradition
[1:50:35] that's taken us beyond the camp of
[1:50:37] reasoning that has taken us beyond
[1:50:40] the camp of what we can figure out
[1:50:45] i want to invite somebody here
[1:50:48] that was honest in their heart
[1:50:52] to look at the word of god and say you
[1:50:54] know what
[1:50:56] i realize
[1:50:57] that there is a stimulation of
[1:50:59] revelation
[1:51:01] to change my life that i have not
[1:51:03] received like i see there in the word
[1:51:07] and you're willing to lay down all your
[1:51:09] pride
[1:51:10] you're willing to lay it all down and
[1:51:11] say you know what lord i'm gonna lift my
[1:51:14] hands tonight
[1:51:15] and ask lord jesus you give me that
[1:51:17] stimulation by revelation i i see the
[1:51:20] world pressing one way but oh god i know
[1:51:23] you're pressing another way like that
[1:51:25] great magnet that went over those scraps
[1:51:28] of metal lord my life is shaking i don't
[1:51:31] know what i'm gonna do
[1:51:33] i but i i know your word's true but it
[1:51:36] just seems like i haven't been able to
[1:51:37] come up higher i want to tell you the
[1:51:39] magnets it's it's passing over you right
[1:51:42] now why don't you just look up to him

[1:51:46] and say oh god here i am lord take me
[1:51:48] now i surrender all i surrender all to
[1:51:51] you oh may i be attracted to your word
[1:51:54] that i might receive that stimulation
[1:51:57] of revelation
