Description:
[2023-04-16pm] Sunday Evening Service
Br. Matthew McGeary
April 16, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

maybe each one of you can turn and look at your neighbor and say the Kingdom of Heaven is in you why don't you do that you know that's the truth it's not way out there somewhere but it's right here then if then if a world that's dying and needs truth it needs Jesus Christ where are they gonna find it could you imagine having the cure to cancer and having the cure to to the virus and everything and just hoarding it all to yourself it's all mine glory to God I'm going to heaven well if that was the attitude then you really don't got what you think you have but when you got the cure to death when you got the cure to the Grave when you got the quickening power oh you want to tell somebody hey I got what you're looking for look I know what it was like when I was out in the world when I came across some good stuff I wanted all my friends to try it out I wanted everybody you think that's good check this out and then we come to God we come to Christ the word like well you know I'll just keep no that's not how it works the Kingdom of Heaven is within you amen we have several birthdays today and we want to tell brother Marion happy birthday and Joseph and Lily and Aya and Adrian all of you are precious to us happy birthday to you let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father You're The Great I Am you're a savior you're Our Redeemer and to think that we are standing in the very place of the fullness of redemption that everyone every patriarch every apostle every Prophet that lived before us would want to live right now [Music] we're humbled Lord may we not take it for granted may we not be distracted by what the world has to offer may we be focused Christians with a focused faith on the goal and the objective Lord not forgetting that we're in a great battle and a war has been set in a ray and we're the very ones that you wanted to be here to sum it all up we're thankful lord it's not according to Ability or intellect but it's all because of you Lord that we're here and you're the reason for our victory and we know that you've said that we are your Victory it's because you live in US we just want to Avail ourselves to you tonight that you could come and break the bread of life to your people Lord your word says that my sheep know my voice May It Be Your Voice according to the word that speaks to your children Lord and that's the voice we want to follow we love you now we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray and praise the Lord if you're just turning your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 5 we'll read verse 12 and 14. man I've been enjoying the nice weather outside we know it's soon to depart but you know it's uh it's easy to look into nature and realize that you know even as Believers we go through seasons we go through uh many times there's Winters and there's Summers but I sure like the spring everything's springing forth with life and you have all the uh the different colors of green emerging out and it's just wonderful to to be able to see that amen just reading out of Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 12 through 14. for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age so who does strong meat belong to them that are of full age now I don't want to count out the young people I believe you can be a full age and be 10 11 12 years old that's not up to me that's up to your hunger and thirst for righteousness and that's up to God and if you want to be a mature rugged soldier in a full age I believe God can apprehend your life and Your Vessel and he can make you rugged men of the Gospel full age but I'm only 10 11 years old well that's all right we can use an anointed Born Again full of the Holy Ghost 10 and 11 year old to sweep this thing on into the coming of the Lord even those by the reason of the use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil let's also turn into Genesis uh chapter 1. I enjoyed the word this morning once again my voice is pretty rough so if you give me all the all the juice you got brother Mike that would be wonderful and I can just get try to gauge the volume by by lowering or raising the mic so Genesis chapter one and we'll just read the first three verses here it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light amen you may have your seats well how many are overcoming in this evil generation amen it's by the blood of the Lamb it's by the word of the testimony it's by the word of the Lord how many has the victory oh aren't you thankful for the victory there's something about having the victory it just makes you excited and I like a lot of those veins our brother hit down you know a a victory doesn't mean you're on the Mountaintop that that's that's when it's easy you know that that's when it's easy you know in the church setting and in the church camp and here on a on a Sunday night or a Wednesday night you know it hey that's why we come together is to get the victory but I want to take the victory home with me I want to take it to my job I want to take it back to my family and when the tough gets going and and you feel like you're down in the dumps and you don't know what you're in and you're out one thing you know that he is with you and you have the victory look the how does it say you know this the sunshine doesn't mean God's for you and the storm clouds doesn't mean he's against you he's with you no matter what you know if you make your bed in hell what he's there if it's in heaven he is there it's so good to be Overcomers in this evil and wicked generation the prophet of God would say this in the church age book he's saying I remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless and exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is thrown into the Lake of Fire so notice that what what the Antichrist spirit is always trying to do is discredit God's word he's wanting to try to add to he's always wanting to try to take away but I I maybe want to bring to your attention as we just maybe allow God to have his way this evening but you know if the prophet of God says that one of his ways is to discredit the word of God we really need to recognize who we are because you are the word of God and one thing we will stand up for will stand up for the written word we'll stand up for the spoken word we'll stand up for our brothers and we'll stand up for our sisters but when that Old Devil comes and he tries to start discrediting the word which you are we actually start to give them a little ear we start to actually reason a little bit and we actually start to give them ground when he starts to come in and say well you might not be the Bride of Jesus Christ maybe you're just foolish virgin but you you've done a lot of good things to the bride and you'll make it in on a cup of water and then if you start to try to bank on that and say you know that's not a bad thought you know I am kind of a bad person I really haven't been living an overcoming life but you know I'm just going to keep doing good to the bride look you're coming off of your ground you're actually allowing him to discredit the word of God because you are the word of God the message that has been spoken through Malachi 4 5 has spoken a bride into existence and you are that bride and when the devil tries to discredit who you are in your position in the word then he's trying to make you cold formal and Powerless but you got to stand your ground and say devil ain't backing up I ain't gonna quit I know who I am and I am persuaded I've committed my life to Jesus Christ and he is the one that's residing over this vessel he is at the command center he's the one that's controlling my heart my mind my life my eyes and he told me that I'm an overcomer he told me that I'm Victorious and I'm not going to allow you to discredit the word of God in Me amen we got to start taking sides with the word it's so easy to to come off our ground when it comes to us just think of how much you would fight for your brother think about how much you would fight for the sister think how much you would fight for your savior well your savior did all for you that you could be who you are in this generation so stand up for yourself don't back up he cannot stand revelation he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army I'm so thankful to be living in the Realms of the manifestation of what has been spoken by a Prophet this is not something coming off in the future this is not something we're looking for some climactic event but I believe that I'm standing in the presence of a mighty Victorious Army that gots the victory we're not just trying to rally the troops because we've been wounded and and we didn't win the battle and now we're all running back and saying oh the messenger's been taken off the scene what are we going to do how are we going to go in a Rapture we're waiting for some tent Vision or something I don't know what God's gonna do I don't know how he's going to do it but one thing I know is what he said and he said Christ is here and then if his if he's here then why do you have to fear there's a man here that can turn on the light and the Darkness of Lady you'll see it with all the dark and Gloom and everything around him people don't know which way to go there's a man here and what is his name his name is Jesus Jesus Christ is here to turn on the light so you can see I think it's profound I believe the next sermon he preaches that evening is Look Away to Jesus is that I believe that's right I love the message you can just it'll preach to you in titles you couldn't look to you couldn't even look away to Jesus if there wasn't a man here that could turn on the light but thanks be to God we have received a message to turn on the light so you can look away to Jesus look away and live you can do the Greater Works if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her now I might just be fullness enough to believe it but I believe Satan is powerless before me I believe Satan is powerless before you now remember Satan wants to discredit that word and say then why are you sick now let's just go back into the into our scripture you see God has a pattern and he never changes his pattern if that excuse would work then how could Jesus have a headache how could Jesus have infirmities how could all of these happen to the word made flesh that there it was something that Jesus had to go through that he could be a high priest that's touched by the feeling of your infirmity and also you are a testimony your life is an example it's the very word living out through you dear in that infirmity remember oh what remember what it means to be unconquered remember what it means to to be victorious it's not always the things that you do it's the things that you don't do so then it's in the trial it's in the sickness when you do it looks like there's no way out you can't see light at the end of the tunnel and you stand there and you say My God Is A Healer he healed me in the body he's given me a promise and I'm not gonna back up and I'm not gonna quit oh that means you are an invincible Army in the face of all obstacles Hallelujah God has raised up a bride in the face of all obstacles when it looks like all hope is gone it looks like you're never going to get the victory you stand right there in the face of the devil and say I don't care what you throw at me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I won't back up I'm not going to quit this message is true whether it heals me on this side or that side my God Is A Healer now that's an invincible Army now you're starting to sound like an invincible Army I love the story about Jonathan you know Jonathan got a revelation uh you know Saul was his daddy and Saul really wasn't doing too good job taking care of the Kingdom Jonathan got sitting around there he said you know what let's just go take care of these Philistines he told his armor bear come on let's go let's go kill these fellas because Jonathan had a revelation Jonathan got a revelation he said you know what I come to find out it's not so much how many of uh of us that we are it's who's with us he told his army bear come on let's go if God can save us with ten thousand he could save us with ten and he took his armor Bearer over there and he slew all them Philistines because he had a revelation that God is with me we the are the elected chosen bride of Jesus Christ and nothing can stand before us I think it's time that we go to battle it's time that we go fight for our brothers and sisters we got some of them out there I'm going to get them I'm going to bring him into the house of God why because we are the Invincible Army of God by God's spirit we discern and withstand yeah brother Matthew that sounds all fine and dandy but what about getting down to where we live what about when we're all alone what about when we're on the job what about me when I'm in my trial yes by God's spirit we need to discern what is right and wrong we need to rightly divide the word of Truth Prophet would say we need Revelation by the spirit God wants to reveal his word to us by the spirit as the prophet would start to lay open that church-aged book he would start out look it's good to be a student of the word it's good to study but it takes more than that it's going to take a supernatural Revelation by the spirit to give you the very meaning of the things that are set forth in the book and just drawing from our text out of Genesis chapter 1 and verse 3 and the spirit of God moved I'd like to speak to you a little tonight on end the spirit of God move the prophet of God would say in the power of transformation he would say now in Genesis chapter 1. the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters we realize that the water and the Bible said in the beginning back there that the world was without form and was void there was nothing but just a darkness of Chaos what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but way into the darkness Yonder without light or anything and the churning of the water and the wandering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a terrific mass of something lost like it was couldn't find its way and that's what we become we become wandering Stars away from God without hope without God just churning around in darkness not knowing where we're going and God took that great chaos of Darkness and transformed it into a Garden of Eden by his word now we know the scripture says in John 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God John 4 24 would say and God is a spirit so many times you might get confused in the scripture and it says and the spirit of God it says God created the Heaven and the spirit of God moved and God said and we hear God and the word and the spirit and if and if we if we're not careful you you might get lost in that but we want to just lay a foundation that as Jesus would say in John 4 24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and John 6 63 he would say it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing but the words that I speak they are spirit and they are alive because God has an order God has a pattern he has a way that he unfolds himself he has channels and offices and times and seasons so something could be right you could even have the right Revelation or inspiration but if it's not in the right season or the right place or the right person you can be dead wrong because God has a pattern and so that something that set forth in creation as you see the word as it's even written there it's because God has a pattern or a way that he unfolds himself that's what the prophet would be able to pick that up and and explain things that no man would ever be able to go in and be able to go before Genesis 1 1. because it was the mind of God coming to the bride to reveal the hidden things to reveal the secret things to you and you we we have to realize I think one of the challenges if we're not careful and it's just man it's something that's in us and I believe it's part of something that we we must always overcome and be extremely sensitive to but we're always wanting to eliminate the paradox we're always wanting to take the supernatural out of the equation and be able to do the simple math and say well this is why but then then faith is not required because faith has to be a part of the equation so there's many things uh that that are in the word and if you keep trying to tackle down a line to go down a line and trying to make everything make sense you'll drive yourself crazy and the and the prophet of God even told ministers he said you mustn't do that you you will have a mental breakdown if you keep trying to just uh make sense out of everything and you study too much and you just study study study he said that can actually have a negative effect on you we never want to try to eliminate the Paradox we want to believe it by faith and then pray for Revelation by the spirit because if you ever come to a conclusion intellectually then it can be intellectually taken away from you but when it's revealed to you by the spirit of God then heavens and earth will pass away but that Revelation Hallelujah that Revelation that has been opened up to you is something that will never pass away it doesn't matter what happens in your life it doesn't matter if you go by the way of the Grave because that Revelation is something that's internal it's in your DNA and it must come up on that day of the Resurrection because the Revelation is the very revelation of the person of Christ and who he is he's wanting to express himself in you so we look into the scriptures God has orders and patterns and you know we we've dealt many times on the subjects where the rain falls on the just and the unjust but what makes the difference what makes the just just in the unjust unjust the rain's not the problem I like the rain I enjoy the rain it brings forth life the prophet of God said the rain was for the wheat but you see in that field there were some cocoa barrels and you know it's I I just hate weeds with a Godly hate but I don't know what it is about them guys but they can just have I mean they don't need any fertilizer they don't they just they just need a little drop of water and actually Hallelujah here I am and they're like you think there's just one of us just watch out it's Clover weed season you go out in your yard and you're like what is that it's like we are called crabgrass and we come to take over like I've been spending all this money on my yard I've been watering and weed feeding everything where did you come from because in that field there's also tears but the rain you don't when you when you water your lawn guess what you're doing you're watering the weeds do you just tear up your sometimes you do but we gotta we gotta follow the pattern in the scripture right if we get carnal you got the bulldozer out there you're like dude why do you have a parking lot in the backyard there ain't going to be one more weed in my backyard it's all concrete We're Playing Basketball you don't even play basketball as long as there ain't no weeds and guess what give it a little time their weeds will be growing in cracks in your concrete but see there's a pattern what did he say let him grow up together don't try to pull them all out there's coming forth a harvest rain and in the right season in the right time I'll send my angels and I'll bind them all together so allow the scriptural pattern to unfold I have a way of doing things as the word would say the rain falls on the just and the unjust we'll have false tries to raise up false anointed ones we will be Anointed with the real Holy Ghost but what makes them unjust there's nothing in them to Quicken they can never stay true to the word now that's a pattern they can't do it and I'm thankful it's set up that way because the prophet told us they will always deviate from the word now that's the saith the Lord so something about that unjust or that false seed will always deviate from the word and Joel 2 28 what did he say I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so then you start to understand he didn't say I will pour out my spirit upon only the elect I will pour out my spirit upon only my sons and my daughters no he said I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh you know I just fellowship and not long ago with my brother David and he made a wonderful statement you know the scripture says do good to those that despitefully use you and you want to know why people in denominational systems are blessed and they put together these rock and roll songs and they sing praises to the Lord and and they have their little lodges that they go to and they are blessed you want to know who they're blessed by they're blessed by the Lord because he does good to those that despitefully use him they will use his name because they just want to take away their reproach they want to be just like Isaiah 4 they want to dress any way they want to dress they want to act any way they want they want to say give us our own bread we'll have our own doctrines we'll have our own uh uh uh uh ways about believing the word the only thing we want to do Lord Jesus is be called by your name Lord You're so far off also wonder you're such a a good God I was so lost and now you came and I am saved and I am blessed and keep drinking up that milk but let the rough get going because strong meat don't don't let that be something like a doctrinal something out in the way of Yonder that you're forever striving to get to but I believe part of the strong me part of being full age is being settled being in your position knowing what God where God has placed you and what you've been called for and that you're not so easily shaken and that situations can happen in the church or in the family and at work and you're not on edge you're not nervous you're not anxious because the scripture says be anxious for nothing and you're able to sit back and look to the Lord and say Lord what would you have me to do I believe that's strong meat when you're settled and you're not so easily moved and you're completely trusting upon the Lord and God has a pattern as we just move down this line as first John 4 1 will say believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world brother Branham says here in the pergamian church age but what we have in this day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God if they see blood oil or fire they are happy it matters not what is in the word so once again we're we're wanting to look what makes the difference the word it's the word that makes the difference a true move of the spirit of God will be by the word of God but a false move or just an outpouring upon All Flesh can be something that's mixed and mingled but it's it's it deviates from the word of God and from that moving you get a mixed bag of fruit now I just love God in his grace there's many and I'm sure there's many sitting here that could testify of being out in denomination and being in a service and God will speak to you where you're at and he'll start to grow that seed that seed will start to Spring forth in life but you because of God's scriptural pattern you can only go so far in that you'll come to a place that you cannot progress any further because you've got to come out of the condition you're in to go any higher because if it's not the fullness of the word then it can never produce the full seed or the full wheat plant you have to come out of that you have to come to the full word so the full word could be born in you he says but a true move of the spirit but God has warned us about that he said in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two Spirits would be so close together that only the very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived how can you tell the spirits apart give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one so if you have questions about something that's going on and you you see some things going on and you you have a question about well is God in that is that really uh is that really of the Lord then just give it the word test and don't take hearsay for it get around and give them the word test and if they come back to you the individual comes back to you and everything is saying Amen to the word then you can say well praise God that's a true move of the spirit because if it wasn't a true move of the spirit it would be void of the word that's what I want to see I just want to see the word because if the word is there now we will move a little bit further I need to move a little further we'll just keep going because we'll get right to where I'm going and and we'll we'll uh turn some of those gazes into amens a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word I say oh God don't let me be that well I'll say this the little I do know of the word let it be a revelation Let It Be substance Let It Be substance Faith Lord and that's what he's saying don't don't let the devil twist that on you they know little or nothing about God and the revelation of the person of who he is because remember he said you got the church Spirit and the church people but you have the bride Spirit and the bride people there's a lot of people that got a church spirit and they will out Church you man they will out Church you you won't be able to outchurch them but we're not called to out church the church spirit we're not called to build bigger buildings and have bigger hoop laws and and all of these things were called to be what God made us a humble a a a a a called out elect group that bears the reproach of Jesus Christ that searches for lost souls that are of the Kingdom bearing the reproach going about seeking who we can save not not a big program of something we can do on some big stage but an individual personal work of Christ in you in in the area or in the life where he placed you every one of you in here has a Ministry and you have a field to harvest and you have a responsibility to that so I just want to say that as we look at this generation of sign Seekers and things you know we it's easy to look back into maybe the days of brother Branham and how he came to the Pentecostals and he would he would call the restoration of the gifts that he would end up calling that like the Pentecostal age and it was from that age which was the age of the shut that that that full word that was born in the manifestation of the age they rejected it they excommunicated it out of the age so then Christ was on the outside of the church and he was saying come out of her my people and be not a partaker of her plagues but you know Spirits don't die that those Spirits are coming and trying to tempt the very bride of Jesus Christ and offer things to you to try to tempt you and to deceive you in the prophet of God would say oh yes this false spirit in the last days is so close to the real it can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word so Spirits don't die Satan don't care how much you shout how much you dance how much you get loud all the weeds do it too they're the first ones to say Amen they're the first ones to dance and Shout they're the first ones to run around the building so that has nothing to do it but if your life is deviating from the word the devil don't care how Victorious you are in church he doesn't care how Victorious you are in Camp but if when you're out there on the job site and you and you and you can't express the life of Jesus Christ and you keep failing and you keep the guys keep calling it around the water bucket and they keep using the lord's name in vain and they keep telling dirty jokes and you just kind of sit around there and chuckle at it no you are Duty bound to stand up for you who are as it was brought to our attention don't you realize this whole age is designed with a Target on your back to take you down see you saw you you start to allow the devil to make you think you're some little insignificant then you start to belittle your job you start to belittle your attention it's just little on me going to the store man they probably have a they probably have a pepper rally down in hell all right everybody gather up one of the young people's going to the mall again what are we gonna do come on we can get him this time well you know boss last time last time I I do I I I I I I I I I tried to get together every sexy dressed demon in the in the city and send them in there and running by him and he didn't even turn his head well let's try something else let's try to get get him flustered let's try to get him distracted why don't we try to get him in a wreck or cut him off before he even gets there and then you get in the mall and you're all flustered and you're all frustrated and you're off your game and all sudden you start looking at something uh you don't think the devil look he's after you he knows that if he can slow you down he's buying more time because when you catch a revelation of Who You Are and the two spirits that are warned or the one Spirit but the two spirits in the church one of them that is warring against you trying to take you down and to realize that he's after you I ain't trying to put you into fear what did the prophet say you gotta recognize the devil real but then when you recognize them real do you recognize that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so you don't get knocked off your game when that person Cuts in front of you say oh God bless you they must be in a hurry I hope everything's that okay out there work I try to do that you know and then and then we're not careful you know you go you take the one lane off all the way up all the way up and you get in there and you're like oh I'm sorry guy back there you get down the road and all sometimes it comes up and cuts you up like hey come on man you hypocrite oh yeah this is where God Wants to Rule and reign everybody can be a Christian on Sunday morning but what about in your car in your quiet time when it's just you and who depends on who you invite depends on what kind of atmosphere and I I have been so convicted to think that there's things I've done with my Lord Jesus sitting right next to me and then you start to think would I do that if the Lord was sitting next to me well come on do we believe the very basics that we've been taught by our Lord that I am with you the Kingdom of Heaven is within you we lack revelation I lack revelation because there's many times throughout my day if his person was visible there it's because my lacking that I'm not keeping him in the Forefront Lord thou art with me Lord what would you have me to do greater is he that is in me Lord that person's in need they did this they did that because Jesus there was a pattern Jesus was always going somewhere with purpose he was always doing what God showed him to do and so we want to have that kind of purpose we want to follow that pattern that's been set for us and just speaking about patterns and you know we made that we read that quote about the the rain falling on the just and the unjust and the spirits uh working within the church and and how God has a pattern and what I was wanting to move towards is God has a way of doing things because when you start to look into the Bible and the prophet of God would take time to explain this when he talks about the uh the King David where King David got a revelation to bring the ark back to the city and there it's not that the Revelation was wrong the Revelation was right but what David failed to do is David didn't go through the right Channel and so when you start to look at things what we're talking about is there can be the Revelation can be right it can be it can be the right word but there has to be a time there has to be a season and there has to be the right channel for it and David what did he do he went ahead and he consulted his friends and he consulted the congregation but he didn't consult the prophet that was there concerning the desire or the Revelation that he had and I want to tell you that's where a lot of ministers and that's where a lot of people get themselves in a lot of trouble is because they get a revelation they get an inspiration and they run out on that Revelation and so much of it being right but when they don't consult the Holy Spirit they don't consult the prophet of God and run that back through the message they'll get themselves on a limb somewhere they shouldn't be and if they would have just consulted the message of the hour it would have protected him from making the air and I've watched Men catch a revelation but if in that revelation there's a partial a lack of understanding or or it's 99 right if you run off on that eventually you run back into another word that's contrary because the word always corrects the air and men will be bound by pride and I've watched them the word come in to correct the air and they will explain away the word that's there to correct the air because they don't want to Humble themselves to the word of God oh friends we gotta humble ourselves to the word of God lord if I'm wrong I'm wrong forgive me I don't want to be wrong or correct me send your spirit move upon my life let me look into the bible let me look into the message Lord give me a revelation because if I'm wrong Lord I know that you can correct me because those that I love I rebuke and chasten but David didn't consult the prophet so what did he do he went ahead and he started to have himself a Revival look into your Bible he got all the musicians there he set it all up and they all started to come in they were bringing the Ark of God home but what happened because he never consulted the messenger because he never consulted the prophet David was going through the wrong Channel it was the wrong time and it was the wrong season and the prophet of God said they were walking right into death and the fruits of that was that user died what did he do he reached out and he touched the cart and God smote him dead it brought forth death that false Revival that David was having it brought forth death because he didn't go through the right Channel I got to look into that maybe another time I can pick it up but but I was really uh uh really enjoying it because David named that place pereza and pereza means the breach of yuza it caused a breach so it went into a season it wasn't the time for the word to be restored back to the city but then there came a time after the breach there came a time after the breach when it came time for the word to be restored and I started to get excited about that I started to think look just just in the age of Pentecost what was it it was the restoration of gifts it was a true move of the spirit and if they would have waited on their Prophet messenger if they would have waited for the teaching Reign because all of them were hungering and they were thirsting they were crying out to God for a Revival and God by Divine promise the mechanics of Joel 2 28 he poured out a spirit upon them and now there was a manifestation of diverse manifestations of spirits and all of these things and if they if they would have stayed there and waited on the leadership of the Lord they would have received the prophet messenger in the time and season that was supposed to bring them into the full restoration of the word but what they thought in their spirit this must be it look at everything that's happening we're screaming we're shouting we're dancing we're speaking in tongues this is that restoration that was promised to come and they living in that age of man and that intellect they started to make dogmas and Creeds and were they little did they know they were walking right into death what did the prophet of God said he said tongues was a sign of death but they didn't wait if they would have waited on the teaching rain if they would have waited for the prophet Messenger to properly place them if they would have consulted the messenger of the age and not gotten ahead of God's program they would have come to the fullness of the word but they denominated and they died but what came a breach Hallelujah and then the messenger of the age that came with that teaching reign right the former in the latter rain you had you had to have the former Aid and the prophet of God taught how could you even have the latter rain when the former rain hadn't even come the former and the teaching Reign had to come what is the teachers right it's a sowing it's a sowing of seed well it's not just a sowing of seed in 1963 it's not just a sowing of seed in the 50s it's not just a sowing of it's a sowing of seed when were you born when were you born it's a sign of seed for your time and your season it was the word of God being sown into the age that that spoken word in the time of season that Harvest rain Hallelujah the Harvest rain the message of the hour Christ the word what came after the breach the Harvest rain to bring forth the life what did he say it's literally these Divine mystery truths that restore the heart back to the original Faith so it was after the breach all the age before brought for death and chaos but then there came a season of preach that Malachi 4 5 and Luke 17 30 that the veil was pulled away what was it it was Christ coming down with an open book it was the Harvest rain to bring forth the seed word that had been sown Hallelujah Oh Glory to God because God has a channel I don't do anything but what I reveal my secrets to my servants the prophet so just as David who was anointed he didn't consult the prophet just as in the age of Pentecost they were anointed but they didn't consult the prophet Spirits don't die Satan will try to get you so anointed you'll try to get you so worked up he'll try to get you so enthused you'll catch a hold of something but if you're not careful look that's why God has given you a pastor if you need if you need to counsel if you need to talk to him you can approach him as you're approaching God but if you're going to approach him like he's approaching God quit being carnal and approach your pastor and tell your pastor what you're going to do and tell him and you're just looking for him to justify what you've already made up in your heart to do it'll never work and so many times the only reason you're talking to your pastor is because you want to do something you know you don't she shouldn't be doing because you as a son and daughter of God have access to the throne you have access to the Holy Spirit to get on your knees and seek God and say Lord I need a revelation I need an answer but because you're unsettled because you don't have peace in your spirit you go to your pastor looking to justify the decision when you just need to repent and say Lord I'm sorry I'll wait on you well that's fresh so you might as well eat it up we're talking about people of full age full age the Bride of Jesus Christ an invincible Army and if you truly are torn and you have a question I promise you you can say I'm approaching my pastor like I'm approaching God and you come in there and you lay it down before and you say just tell me I need to know I don't care if what he tells you is wrong God will not hold you accountable I believe that with all my heart because you didn't approach a man you approached God see God has offices and channels and we have to have the right reverence we have to have the right respect we have to have the right reproach because if not what are we even do in church are we just playing games are we running some big Corporation and we got the president of the company and we got the CEO and we got all this and I'm just trying to work my way up the ladder so I can get my two cents in no my headquarters was Heaven Jesus Christ is the Great Captain and he set an order in the church and if we'll be faithful to that order God will bless us he'll lead us and he'll guide us see the order David had to go through was the prophet now look at Elijah one day the prophet God speaks to Elijah says look I need you to go down to zeropath I have a widow there that's going to sustain you now I find this remarkable there's a famine in the land the prophet of God will say this Widow is there a path she didn't mix with all the other people she wasn't just some make-believer but she was set aside she was consecrated but now she's in a famine right and she is now basically at the end of her Road you talk about us a bad situation I don't know how long the mother could stretch out some Mill and oil for her baby I don't know how many days I don't know how bloated the stomach was of that boy I don't know how bad the condition was but when it got down to the end of the road and she said you know what I've done all I can do I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to mix the oil and the meal together you see the oil represents the spirit the meal represents Christ the word she mixed it together but you see even though she had mixed it together there was one more component she needed she could have the spirit and because she could have the word but there was one more thing she needed because without that there was no manifestation of the word what did she need she needed Elijah and there in her time of need she went out to that gate to grab them two sticks and the Very things you have to eat it was standing there at the gate what was it it was the prophet It Was Elijah it was the one that could set the order for the events to take place and bring the supernatural without Elijah there the spirit of God is not moving follow me she had the oil she had the meal but she needed the profit now watch the order I'm about you go get me a drink of water I believe he had to come back okay now I'm about to go oh give me something to eat well I'll get you some water we got a little about that around here but oh well the thing you're requiring of me now you see I've I've been struggling for a long time I haven't been mixing down there with the denominations and everything and I haven't been given in to all those things I haven't been buying into the mark this is all I have and I've gone as as far as God's brought me till now and I'm gonna go in there I'm going to bake a cake for me and my son and we're gonna eat it and die and what did the prophet tell her go and do as you said but give me one first you see the order see we got to give the word preeminence so he gave her the promise and the crews will not run dry and the barrel will not go empty but if she would have went in there and not had given the prophet the first place the promise would have never come to pass because it wasn't the right order so we have all these promises in the word we have the Holy Spirit that's been promised to the church we have all these promises that are laying in there but if we don't give the word preeminence then we're not going to get the results of the word and what is Elijah of today it's the Lord Jesus Christ that's what Elijah to the bride today is it is the Lord Jesus Christ we have to give the word the preeminence and what happened when she gave the word preeminence and the spirit of God moved and she had what she hadn't eat of oh we could just start to run down the Bible when Abraham was obedient to the word of God he took Isaac up on that mountain he said God is able to give us a sacrifice and he raised back that knife and the spirit of God moved because he was obedient to the word and all of a sudden there was a ram caught in the thicket you see you have to be obedient to the word you got to give the word preeminence and then watch the spirit of God move on the scene so we're talking about a true move of the spirit of God according to the word and the word alone that can't be right praise His wonderful name who Lord help me we'll just try to be a few more moments so just drawing back to our text where we were in the beginning in the beginning so we mentioned those scriptures Genesis 1 1-3 and and John 1 1 all of these things and the prophet would help us understand this so much better you know in the beginning was Elohim the self-existing one and he would say there I see I see the words those thoughts of gods now forming into the logos and and like a little one playing before the father what is this this is an order and a pattern of God God forming himself into the logos which was Christ the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us what was it it was God unfolding himself down to human beings that's always been his plan that's always been his pattern if you look at his pattern from the very beginning the prophet of God would say he was God the logos the word that went out of God when it began to brood upon the Earth and it brought forth marine life when the spirit of God the logos the word which God said let there be and they're with the logos which was the word and the word because all this was in the logos the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age and as the logos begin to breathe upon the Earth there come marine life and a building up and bird life on onto animal life and finally there comes something in the representation representation or looked like the thing that was brooding over it God a man in the very image of God I'm just going to ask the musicians to stand to come and because we will um not turn this corner would be here a while but I just want to maybe just maybe if we can pick this up at another time but even there God wasn't done unfolding himself there was a part of Adam that needed to become flesh there was something in Adam and if I could say like that there was a revelation inside of Adam that still had to come into manifestation and be expressed the prophet of God would say this in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he would say and when the word is revealed it expresses itself that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself so I just want to maybe end along these lines just as you see on on on the Earth here this Earth was in this great chaos it was in this great condition it was this wandering star it seemed like it didn't even know where it was going and there was this great Chaos on it and what does the scripture say it says and the spirit of God moved well don't you realize that's exactly how you showed up in this world you showed up as a Wandering Star wondering oh where did I come from where am I going you showed up in the most wicked age an age that's designed to frustrate you and make you pull your hair out and make you wish you were never here I mean look you wonder why the news is filled with all of the things that's filled with is it's complete Insanity I believe the prophet of God said in 1963 said if this continues another 50 Years it'll be complete Insanity we're here and we're 10 15 years past complete Insanity y'all are witnessing uh it's not even my it's just be a lot of Beast out there I mean just there's they are even lacking the basic principle fundamentals of what it means to be a human being they have no common sense that they have been grabbed by a monster Darkness has totally overtake them and and and and God called you to be here he called you young people he had spoke a word and he wanted you to be the ones to be in to to express his very image in this day now you would be the ones to stand up against social media that you would be the ones to stand up against fashion that you would be the ones to be a lighthouse and testify of the truth in this dark generation yeah you showed up in this like a Wandering Star but what happened all of a sudden and the spirit of God moved what was it it was a deep calling to a deep and God said let there be and something started to transform in your heart and in your life because you're right where God placed you we're talking about an order we're talking about a pattern and you're right on time you're right in the season that you're called to be in you sometimes wonder well why me why am I going through this what the prophet said the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you now we're trying to tie something together before we end just to not leave it hanging too too much apart strong meat strong meat belongs to them at our full age that you your senses either exercise to discern between right and wrong and Good and Evil and when you can look at the test and be mature enough to say this is the greatest thing that ever happened to me though you slay me Lord yet I'll trust you that's what he's looking for that's the kind of character that's the kind of Believers this message produces you don't need to be pampered and babied I know we need encouragement and I love encouragement more than anybody I need to hear who I am in Christ but there's the rugged part of the Christian that when you're going through the trial and you feel all alone that there's a christ-like character that's being molded in you because those that suffer look you cannot Reign if you don't suffer so then you can look at the trial that's what the prophet said you cannot you cannot Reign unless you suffer so then that's the overcoming to him that overcometh will I grant for them to sit with me now we're talking about being full age embracing the trial and saying you know what this temptation this sickness if this is what God has allowed me to come in contact with just as Paul prayed oh God I I beseech you Lord of this infirmity take it away from you Paul Brian my grace is sufficient for you just keep going on keep going on with God maybe if you know that song um something keeps holding me I like to sing it and be be flat if possible let's just all stand second Timothy says for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and then persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day yeah that's strong meat that you can stand the test that you can stand in the face of the trial what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it has to be the spirit and the word I was so encouraged to hear a testimony from one of the young sisters from that was at camp because when it's a revelation to you it's not something you have today and it's gone tomorrow but it becomes the very fabric of Who You Are and then everything that's not of that you just said God take it away from me Lord I don't want to have that attitude I don't want to have that thought I don't want to have that thinking Lord help me to be a better husband Lord help me to love my wife more help me be more like you Lord you said husbands love your wife as Christ loved the church oh God I'm coming so short if you'll help me Lord yeah that's strong meat so easy to be selfish and look on your own need but when we really start looking on the needs of others and start to Bear their cross and start to Bear their burden and they know that we are his disciples by the love that we show one to another it's something that's constant it's alive it's not a workup it's not a check box well I did I visited that Widow and I went to I went to the the hospital and I passed out this track and I'm doing a good job no it's something that exudes out of you something that's pushing out of you Lord who can I serve today Lord who can I pray for today something that's there to stay it's a revelation this sister got up to testify she said you know I went to Camp I add a lot of fear and the devil was was fighting against me and telling me over and over and over that I wasn't going to get nothing out of the service and I had a good service and the devil come back and he was right there there in my mind you're not going to get nothing out of the service but I loved her testimony she said I went up through the prayer line and I went up there with a need upon my heart and I said oh Lord speak to me Lord speak to me she said something happened something took place and she said and I can stand before you tonight and testify I got more than an emotion I got power I said Hallelujah there it is that's overcoming power when you can come back and stand there say I got yeah I was excited yeah I streamed yeah I shouted but I got something more than a shout I got the power of almighty God living and reigning in my being that's an overcoming Church Hallelujah are we there the trials of this life we're getting stronger oh I fell was more than I could bear and I was on the verge of giving over the strength Within Myself just was not there but something keeps holding me [Music] every day I see [Music] to overcome my goodness [Music] oh he's a reality something keeps holy [Music] his temptation foreign [Music] I don't believe me I try [Music] something keeps holding me with every headbound as they saw them play Lord Jesus we're thankful [Music] that you foresaw us before you even form this world and that we were in you and written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Lord that gives us a confidence and a courage to overcome by your word and this wicked and adulterous generation where the whole world has forsaken you Lord but Lord we don't want to forsake you we want to have our thoughts and our Ambitions and all of our hopes and plans solely on you and your word and what your will would be for our life we truly want to be Overcomers Lord we know Lord that by your spirit you're giving us revelation father if we go through the right channel in the right order and we feed upon this message Lord we know that we are the final voice to this generation but if it's not under the messenger of the age Lord then it won't accomplish what your will is Lord we have to come through your channel of inspiration Lord and stay on track so we're so thankful for this message Lord we're so thankful for your word and we know Lord you've given us your holy spirit that we could be Overcomers and that we could point back to the word and say it is written it is written get behind me Satan it is written and Lord I just want to make an invitation to anybody here who's suffering or feels they don't have the victory there's somebody here that wants to be born again or receive the Holy Ghost Lord I believe it's in atmospheres like this where births take place for your Prophet taught us it takes atmosphere to do things and Lord we've sung the songs we've preached the word now's a good time just to Worship You Lord and to search our hearts and just to give you the glory and the honor and the praise that you so richly deserve we love you now Lord we commit these people to you and we ask these things you name the Lord Jesus Christ amen the trials of this life we're getting stronger all I fell was more than I could be I was all on the verge of giving over just was not there something keeps holding me [Music] he's guided because giving me victory please and something keeps holding and you're welcome to stay in worship you are dismissed as Cosmic comes to lead us in a few songs that moments like these pass you by we allow you to be dismissed because sometimes there's a nervous energy that needs to go you be dismissed but if something's dealing with you hard you come you let God do above and beyond what you could even think or ask because he's the same yesterday today and forever let's just sing that chorus as brother cosmon comes something keeps holding me every day I [Music] die thank you there's nothing please we have a testimony so it's always a good time to testify we had a little break there so go ahead sister and testify God bless you so I went to Louisiana Camp last last weekend and I truly believe that the Lord did something for me um at first um it started um maybe around last year July just you know going through battles so many mind battles and I just I just felt like I'm not gonna make it and then I came down here at the altar and um brother Matthew and sister Gabrielle prayed for me and that day I really entered into a trial like I didn't think I was gonna make it up but I just kept on persevere and I said the Lord would bring me out I know different the difference that this message makes in each and every person so I'm Gonna Keep On standing I'm Gonna Keep On standing and he kept on getting worse and worse and I said I'm Gonna Keep On persevering because I know God has something for me and the enemy is trying to keep me away from it and so come January um we had a little get-together brother Matthew's house and you know just in activities and fellowship and all that and then brother Matthew spoke to us for like 100 or 10 minutes but I feel like that 10 minutes was for me it was exactly what I needed for what I was going through so I put brother Matthew aside and I was just telling him everything that I was going through and he just began speaking as he was speaking you could notice that it was no longer him that was speaking it was God that was speaking to me and let me know that everything's gonna be okay that you were predestinated before the foundations of the world that no matter what the devil throws at you as soon as you get that revelation of who you are the enemy can stop you and I kept on persevering and then I listened to a tape by Brother Branham and he was talking about persevering and then in that sermon he talks about a gentle woman and he said great is your faith he says that thing that you have been persevering about God has done he's gonna do something for you at that point I was so scared to go to Louisiana again but I don't know why I had this fear and I I just put it in the back I was like it's okay you know maybe it's just not the leader of the Lord to just be there and then literally two weeks before I'm talking to Ella I'm like hey are you going to Camp he's like yeah I'm going with my family I'm gonna stay in the hotel I was like oh can I come with you guys I don't know where I was like and then you know I didn't actually make my decision until the Wednesday before we left for camp but I think that's the greatest decision I've ever made to just not I'm not gonna let that fear hold me that anxiety hold me because God did something for me last year and he's going to do something for me again and then we got there that Friday in the afternoon and we got there in the middle of the skit and I walked in and I started shaking that anxious feeling as this is going on and I sat there and I said Lord you know my heart I prayed this weekend to be such a peaceful weekend to give me a peace as the person's understanding and that anxiety started going away and then it would come back you'll go and everybody just said Lord please give me that peace and that peace did come even throughout the weekend I was just in prayer just you know meditating in my heart that the Lord is going to do something for me and that Friday night they called anybody who wanted the Holy Ghost out he knew that I had the Holy Ghost but I just needed that refill even just that reassurance to know that everything's gonna be okay I went to the altar obviously like no emotion didn't feel anything but I just said the Lord is still gonna do something just because I don't have any emotion just because I don't scream I don't shout like everybody else doesn't mean that the Lord didn't give me something I didn't do something for me I went back to my suit and I sat down you know just just having that faith that God has done something he has done something obviously just going through mind battles that weekend and I said and I just said Lord I'm just going to let you have full control of this weekend I just went through the weekend just persevering and as I was approaching the prayer line those mind battles just coming just coming I was like you know what Satan I'm gonna draw my sword and I'm Gonna Take You Down I have and I was just I was just claiming the promises that God has for me and I was just as I stopped to that prayer line but the wrong Spencer stopped me he said remember every promise in the book is yours God has given it to you so you go out and you claim your Victory and I just went through it was such a peaceful parallel I could not experience I cannot express the peace I felt within me and that doubt said it come and I just said unbelief I know yeah yeah and from that moment on even though that the thoughts of dollars try to come by and I said you've been defeated I am a child of God you have no authority to tell me who I am because I know who I am I know what the word has spoken of me God bless you well that was wonderful you know I thought what's so amazing about that testimony is you could even see an order and a pattern you know God speaks to somebody's heart and tells you who you are but if you just run off and don't water that what does she do what was her next step and I was listening to the message see God knows how to deal with his children and God knows how to feed you and nourish you you come to church and then you water that you have to water it in prayer you have to water it was listening to the tapes you have to water it in Fellowship you have to water it with with saying and drawing your sword and so I thought that was beautiful to see somebody overcoming God bless you hey I've all a little did she know this but I've told told my wife when I see that sister walk by a little time to say there's my hero because I watched her stand up here one time and testify and say God delivered me and and and I that took courage to stand up and and that to me is the true sign of victory is when you can stand up unashamed and just say God delivered me from this it reminds me of the woman at the well a woman that was supposed to be ashamed and an outcast of her past but it didn't matter when it came down to it and she met Jesus she ran back into the town and some come see a man who told me all the things that I'd done all the things that you did you should be ashamed of yourself nope I met the master and he delivered me of them all there's a true testimony is when you met Jesus Everything Has Changed well praise the Lord let's sing a song of Victory then what's that song he's under my feet devil you're under my feet let's all stand and we're just going to all testify with you I don't even know if I can sing it do we have it in the board or hey I got somebody that can sing
