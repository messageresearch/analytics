[3:38] my heart shall not fear the war should
[3:40] rise against me in this will I be
[3:43] confident one thing have I desired of
[3:46] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[3:49] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[3:52] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[3:55] of the Lord and inquire in his Temple
[3:58] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[4:01] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[4:04] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[4:07] me up upon a rock and now shall mine

[41:22] baptism after service this morning so uh
[41:26] we'll try to be
[41:28] not too long man let's open our Bibles
[41:31] uh Ephesians chapter 2 uh let's start
[41:34] with
[41:40] there it said that and ye had we
[41:44] quickened who were dead in trespass and
[41:47] sin wherein in the time pass ye walk
[41:50] according to the course of this world
[41:53] according to the prince of the power of
[41:55] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[41:59] the children of disobedient among whom
[42:02] also we all had our conversation in time
[42:05] pass in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[42:08] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[42:12] and were by Nature the children of rra
[42:14] even as others but God who's rich in
[42:18] Mercy aren't you glad is rich in Mercy
[42:21] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[42:25] even when we were dead in sin
[42:28] in sins had quickened us together with
[42:31] Christ by Grace ye are saved it says
[42:34] that and had raised us up together and
[42:37] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[42:39] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[42:44] that he might show the exceeding reaches
[42:46] of his grace and his kindness towards us
[42:50] through Christ Jesus for by Grace ye are
[42:53] saved through
[42:55] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[42:59] the gift of God not of your work not of
[43:02] works let it let lest any man should
[43:05] boast for we are his workmanship created
[43:09] in Christ Jesus unto good works it says
[43:13] which God had before for ordained that
[43:16] we should walk in them let's also turn
[43:18] in Hebrews 11
[43:21] And1 a very familiar scripture reading
[43:24] it says now Faith is the sub substance
[43:27] of things hoped for the evidence of
[43:30] Things Not Seen for by it the elders
[43:33] obtain a good report through faith we
[43:36] understand that the worlds were framed
[43:39] by the word of God so that things which
[43:43] are seen were not made of things that do
[43:46] appear Let's uh jump to verse eight it
[43:49] says that by faith Abraham when he was
[43:54] called to go out into a place which he
[43:57] should after receive for inheritance
[44:00] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[44:04] whether he went by faith he sojourned in
[44:07] the land of
[44:09] promise it says as in a strange country
[44:13] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[44:16] Jacob The Heirs with him of the of the
[44:20] same promise for he looked for a city
[44:25] which had foundations
[44:28] whose Builder and maker was God let's
[44:31] also turn in 2 Corinthians chapter
[44:34] 4 it would say
[44:37] that we for we preach not ourselves but
[44:42] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[44:46] servant for jesus' sake for God who
[44:49] commanded the light to shine out of
[44:51] darkness and shine in our hearts to give
[44:55] us to G to give the light of the
[44:58] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[45:00] face of Jesus Christ it says but we have
[45:05] this treasure in Earth and vessel that
[45:08] the Excellency of the power may be of
[45:11] God and not of us we are troubl on every
[45:15] side yet not distress we are perplexed
[45:19] but not in despair persecuted but not
[45:22] forsaken cast down but not destroyed it
[45:26] says all always bearing about in the
[45:29] body the dying of the lord of the Lord
[45:32] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[45:35] be made manifest in our body for we
[45:39] which live are always delivered unto
[45:42] death for jesus' sake that the life also
[45:46] of Jesus might be made manifest in our
[45:48] mortal flesh so that so then death
[45:52] worketh in us but life in you it says we
[45:56] have the Same Spirit of Faith according
[45:59] as it is written I believe and therefore
[46:03] I have spoken we also believe and
[46:07] therefore speak knowing that he which
[46:11] raised us raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[46:15] raise us up also by Jesus and shall
[46:18] present us with you for all things for
[46:23] all things are for your sakes
[46:27] that the abundance Grace might through
[46:30] the Thanksgiving of many re uh rebound
[46:33] that to the glory of God for which cause
[46:37] we faint not but though our outward men
[46:41] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[46:45] by day isn't that true we get old we get
[46:48] wrinkled we get all of this but the
[46:51] Inner Man grew this by day it says for a
[46:54] light Affliction which is which is but
[46:57] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[47:01] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory I
[47:05] want you to remember that while it says
[47:08] while we look not at the things which
[47:11] are seen But at the things which are not
[47:15] seen for the things which are seen are
[47:18] temporal but the things which are not
[47:21] which are not sinen are Eternal our
[47:24] gracious father we ask you bless your
[47:26] word to us in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:28] Christ we pray amen amen God bless you
[47:30] may have your
[47:39] seats I trust you happy to be gathered
[47:42] in the house of God this morning I would
[47:44] like to speak
[47:46] on faith to move into the
[47:50] Unseen Faith to mooving to the Unseen as
[47:54] we read the scriptures and and and
[47:56] there's many more we probably would read
[48:00] some I want to say this God
[48:04] uh wants his his church
[48:08] uh to to move and to return to the
[48:13] original faith that was once delivered
[48:15] to the Saints we know that we know even
[48:18] the word of the hour the message which
[48:20] we have received we know that it's it's
[48:23] a message that was sent to return us to
[48:26] the original Faith of Our
[48:28] Father and when and when you speak about
[48:31] that Faith you go back you will find out
[48:33] that that faith has some characteristics
[48:35] attached to it you'll find out that
[48:39] Faith even as edges went by and and we
[48:42] see mankind today I it's amazing I can
[48:45] even say what people call Faith today is
[48:47] not even Faith it's some form of
[48:50] intellectual understanding that men has
[48:52] come up with and and they attributed it
[48:55] as Faith but we find out will say that
[48:58] faith can only come from the word of God
[49:01] said if you look at a tree and you you
[49:03] claim that if you touch a tree or a pole
[49:06] that by touching it something will
[49:08] happen it says that's not Faith why
[49:11] because that's just your own imagination
[49:14] that it will happen there's no God in it
[49:16] what you need the faith that really
[49:18] comes is what comes based on the
[49:20] promises that God has given that's what
[49:23] really faith is and I want to say as
[49:26] individual you can go back human if you
[49:28] can go back right into the Garden of
[49:30] Eden and and and one of the things
[49:32] you'll realize is God created meant to
[49:35] operate by faith you can go back right
[49:37] from Adam when he uh uh uh perhaps move
[49:41] a tree when he would speak and when he
[49:43] would name animal it was not an a an
[49:47] intellectual Affair it was a faith
[49:49] Affair it was created in the image of
[49:52] God God operate by faith and therefore
[49:55] man operated by faith God made man to
[49:58] live by faith to achieve by faith before
[50:01] the foundation even of the world when
[50:03] God created man we can see man in that
[50:07] very State he was operating by faith he
[50:09] didn't he didn't wonder whether his word
[50:12] was going to come to pass he didn't
[50:13] wonder what he said if it really was
[50:15] going to happen he knew he had a
[50:18] connection with his maker he was made in
[50:20] the image of his maker and he knew what
[50:22] he spoke would come to pass he didn't
[50:25] doubt it there was no thing as doubt and
[50:27] he didn't question what he was saying he
[50:29] knew that he was connected to the
[50:31] purpose of God he knew within his God
[50:34] that what he wanted was what God wanted
[50:37] he wanted he knew one thing that he was
[50:39] placed there to be the god of the earth
[50:41] to be in charge of what was around him
[50:44] and he knew that he was endued with
[50:46] power from above for him to operate and
[50:48] work the things that were around him he
[50:51] knew that it was his responsibility to
[50:53] keep the Earth in check to subdue and
[50:56] and to to bring things in the uh uh uh
[50:59] in the in the light and in the position
[51:02] that God wanted them to be and we find
[51:04] out that is sin that came and makx up
[51:06] the whole thing sin came and and and and
[51:10] and and and took man away from what was
[51:12] God's intended purpose by in the
[51:15] beginning but God he gave us faith in
[51:19] order for us to get access into the
[51:21] Unseen realm of
[51:23] God and I want to say this God gave us
[51:27] the the the the the faith in order to
[51:29] introduce us into the Unseen Realm Of
[51:32] Heaven that men lost in the beginning
[51:35] because we understand that when man lost
[51:37] when man fail that he was separated away
[51:40] from God and he began to operate by the
[51:43] five senses he began to think and he
[51:45] began to work through the five senses
[51:47] and coming up with his own reasoning but
[51:50] we understand that God placed within the
[51:53] man there was still a faith that God
[51:55] wanted to connect
[51:57] uh uh with a man through to use it but
[52:00] say we have been given Faith it's the
[52:02] ability that God has given us in order
[52:04] to uh connect with this world with this
[52:07] this invisible world that's around us we
[52:10] may not be able to see it or touch it or
[52:13] or be able to understand it with our own
[52:15] mind just exactly or be able to explain
[52:17] it with our own words but we know one
[52:20] thing that we are given the five senses
[52:23] it was given for us to contact the world
[52:25] around us but it was they were given to
[52:27] us the fifth sense the prophet will say
[52:30] in order for us to contact God so it was
[52:33] given to us in order to take us right
[52:36] back into the same condition that we
[52:38] were in the beginning and the five
[52:40] senses were given to us to touch the
[52:43] world that was around us we find out
[52:45] that it was given because this ability
[52:48] that God placed in man we needed a way
[52:50] for us to get access into it we needed a
[52:53] way for us to go back and the only way
[52:56] way we could go back it became by the
[52:58] faith that God introduced that the faith
[53:01] that God deposited into the heart of
[53:04] man I want to say this I was reading
[53:06] this uh but when I inan the message
[53:08] unseen it would speak and and I begin to
[53:11] think uh uh uh about the he speaks about
[53:14] the story in second king chapter 6 and
[53:17] this is the story of Elijah and G gah he
[53:21] says this and and we we know the story
[53:23] very well uh this is when uh the king of
[53:26] Syria is going to war with the king of
[53:29] Israel and and they they they try to set
[53:32] up traps so many times and and every
[53:35] time they will set up a trap and and the
[53:38] the the Elijah will will call the king
[53:40] of uh Israel and they will tell him and
[53:43] says don't don't go this direction and
[53:45] and stay away from this place and stay
[53:47] away from that place and and they would
[53:50] do that and the king of Syria came empty
[53:52] came up empty every time and he got
[53:54] frustrated and then this but but but
[53:57] when I'm he's talking about that story
[53:58] it says therefore it says therefore the
[54:01] heart of the king of Syria was soared
[54:03] and troubled for the thing and he and he
[54:05] called his servant and said unto them
[54:08] will ye not show me which one of us is
[54:11] for the king of Israel so he was
[54:14] frustrated because every plan that he
[54:16] would make he would spoil it and
[54:18] everything he would try to trap the king
[54:20] of Israel against the war he would come
[54:23] up and and find out that the king of
[54:25] Israel was able to made it and and he
[54:27] will say that oh he says and one of his
[54:30] servants said it says None my Lord it
[54:33] says oh
[54:34] King but Elijah the prophet that is in
[54:38] Israel he says that is in Israel he tell
[54:42] the king of Israel the words that thou
[54:45] speaketh in the bed chamber and he said
[54:48] go and spy where where he is and that I
[54:52] may send and fetch him and then it says
[54:55] and he was told to him saying behold he
[54:58] is in dayon and and therefore he send uh
[55:02] th horses and Chariot and a great host
[55:05] and they came by night and they
[55:07] compassed the city about and and when
[55:09] the servant of the man of God uh was
[55:12] risen and early and he passed the city
[55:15] he passed he passed City both the horses
[55:18] and the and the Chariot and his servant
[55:21] said unto him he says alas my master how
[55:25] shall we do and he answered this is
[55:28] Elijah now answering it and he answered
[55:30] he says fear not for there there be with
[55:34] us more than they that be with them and
[55:39] Elias pray and say Lord I pray thee open
[55:43] his eyes that he may see and the Lord
[55:46] opened the eyes of the young man and he
[55:49] saw and behold the mountain was full of
[55:52] horses and Chariots of Fire about Elijah
[55:56] Oh I thought oh if we can just come to
[55:59] an understanding this morning here is
[56:01] this young man and and and and and all
[56:04] he can see was that there were Compass
[56:07] about and all he could see that there
[56:09] were uh that the king of Syria came with
[56:11] Chariot and horses and they were
[56:13] everywhere around the city and blocking
[56:16] the whole city so that they can besiege
[56:18] them and find out where they could come
[56:20] and and and and find the prophet of God
[56:23] but here he is and the prophet now is
[56:25] talking and and speaking to this young
[56:27] man and and and is's trying to make him
[56:30] understand that the reality is just not
[56:33] what your five senses is telling you
[56:35] that really the the whole reality is not
[56:39] just what you can take and what you can
[56:41] touch and smell and see with your eyes
[56:44] and how you can add up numbers within
[56:46] your mind and come up with a conclusion
[56:49] what the prophet was trying to get this
[56:51] young man to do is to bring him in an
[56:54] understanding that there's an uncen just
[56:56] around the corner you may not be able to
[56:59] see it with your eyes but there's an
[57:01] unseen realm there's a host around us
[57:04] that's there to protect you there's a
[57:06] host of God I like this because the
[57:09] prophet didn't pray that God will change
[57:11] the circumstance no the prophet prayed
[57:14] so that the young man could not only see
[57:16] what he was seeing but also take into
[57:19] consideration that there was a Heavenly
[57:21] Host present the prophet didn't pray for
[57:24] God to come and and block this so do
[57:26] that no the prophet prayed so that our
[57:29] eyes could see the reality of what's
[57:31] Happening oh this morning when we run
[57:34] into trouble if we can only understand
[57:37] that they that are with us are more than
[57:39] those that are against
[57:42] us often time when we run against
[57:45] difficulties we cramble and and we think
[57:48] oh this is the end of me the young man
[57:50] was there looking at it and said oh I
[57:52] don't know how we're going to get out of
[57:54] the circumstance I don't know what's
[57:56] going to happen through us this looks
[57:57] like the end of us but oh my the prophet
[58:00] pray so that his eyes can open so he can
[58:04] see that the reality was not coming from
[58:07] his eyes the reality comes from The
[58:09] Unseen real what was happening in heaven
[58:12] in fact the prophet will say one place
[58:14] that when he prayed the the the reason
[58:17] when the prophet prayed the reason he
[58:19] was praying the prophet he himself he
[58:22] ended understanding that the angel of
[58:25] God in Camp around those that fear him
[58:28] so what he was praying is for the
[58:30] scripture to open up to him he wasn't
[58:33] praying so that God will somehow send
[58:36] the angels and send the Chariot and send
[58:38] all no those chariots were already dead
[58:41] to begin with the the the Chariots of
[58:44] Fire existed before the Chariots of Fire
[58:47] were already around the mountain what he
[58:49] needed was a revelation for him to see
[58:54] those and that's what happened within
[58:56] our life what we need is to understand
[58:59] that the sin that's bounding you is not
[59:01] the end of you what you need to know is
[59:04] salvation is already
[59:06] there but Matthew preached last Sunday
[59:09] they said what is greater is it sin or
[59:12] is it the Savior what is greater is it
[59:14] healing or is it sickness before
[59:17] sickness can come upon you there was
[59:19] already a God Who provided healing for
[59:24] it what we need is a God to bring us to
[59:28] open up our eyes for us to see the
[59:30] Unseen
[59:32] realm to see what God is working that's
[59:36] why the prophet will pray it says oh
[59:39] that what the will What's Done in heaven
[59:41] may be done on Earth so because the
[59:44] understanding is not us trying to
[59:47] necessarily uh uh change what uh uh
[59:50] what's happening and everything what God
[59:52] is wanting us to do is to come to a
[59:55] place
[59:56] where we put Heaven into the equation of
[59:59] what we're trying to
[1:00:02] do when when when things gets hard when
[1:00:06] the doctors say there's no option for
[1:00:08] you when when when you try everything
[1:00:11] you don't know how to get out of it
[1:00:12] don't stop there God wants you to know
[1:00:15] there's unseen resources untapped
[1:00:19] resources that exist for you and what
[1:00:21] you see with your eyes it's the devil
[1:00:24] trying to lie to you is coming from the
[1:00:27] five senses but God has given you an in
[1:00:30] Man by which you can tap into an unseen
[1:00:33] resources and come up with a different
[1:00:38] result so he he came and he prayed for
[1:00:43] for God to open up this young man's eyes
[1:00:46] he said oh
[1:00:48] God if you can open this young man's
[1:00:50] eyes that he may see and the prophet
[1:00:55] will speak about that in the message the
[1:00:57] uh looking into the Unseen paragraph 34
[1:01:01] he
[1:01:03] says he says like Elijah told Gesa his
[1:01:08] servant a a daughter and he says why
[1:01:13] they looked they looked at around and
[1:01:15] there was a Syrian Army it says there
[1:01:18] was everything to smash them down
[1:01:21] because this man of God was able to tell
[1:01:24] the king of Israel what the king of
[1:01:27] Syria was thinking about was thinking in
[1:01:31] his bed chamber if you can put it up
[1:01:33] there it says bam says let me say this
[1:01:37] tonight my audience that God still
[1:01:41] lives and he's just the same tonight as
[1:01:45] he was then he can still know your
[1:01:48] thoughts and what you are thinking about
[1:01:51] right now and then he says then you
[1:01:55] should watch the fruits of the spirit to
[1:01:58] see that it's that it's the it's that if
[1:02:01] that God of history but it that is if
[1:02:05] it's that God of History it raised again
[1:02:08] certainly in paragraph 55 uh 35 he says
[1:02:13] and when the Great crisis come which
[1:02:16] always does then gaha being just a lukew
[1:02:20] church member when he had not seen what
[1:02:23] Elijah had seen because Elijah was used
[1:02:26] to walking by faith and he he was
[1:02:30] looking into the Unseen all the time he
[1:02:32] knew that God has said in Psalm in the
[1:02:36] Psalms that the angel of God are
[1:02:38] encamped about those that fear Him it
[1:02:41] says that was that was enough for Elijah
[1:02:44] but gazah had just gotten half believed
[1:02:47] believer believed it it says he uh he
[1:02:52] weigh just the church member so Elijah
[1:02:54] said to the Lord it said Lord God give a
[1:02:58] sign here just open this this man's eyes
[1:03:01] and let him see what's around him and
[1:03:04] when God opened his eyes he saw horses
[1:03:07] of fire drawn by Chariots of Fire and
[1:03:11] they were all around the old Prophet
[1:03:14] they were there all the time but he just
[1:03:17] didn't see
[1:03:21] them oh God you've left me no is there
[1:03:25] all the time oh God I don't know what to
[1:03:28] do he's there if you're in the fire he's
[1:03:31] there with you in the fire if you're in
[1:03:33] difficulties he's there with you in the
[1:03:35] difficulties he wants you to know he's
[1:03:37] never left you he's never forsake you
[1:03:40] that's his Word of Promise toward you oh
[1:03:42] my brother my sister what we receive in
[1:03:44] this end time is God sending the prophet
[1:03:47] to remind you that you were
[1:03:49] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:03:52] the world it's not a new message it's
[1:03:54] the oldest message there ever
[1:03:59] was it's the same thing that was brought
[1:04:02] to job when the god came to him and says
[1:04:05] where were you when the sons of God
[1:04:07] shouted for Joy where were you are you
[1:04:09] going to cry out just because there's
[1:04:11] this uh little Temptation that's upon
[1:04:14] you are you going to cry out just
[1:04:15] because this is happening that's
[1:04:17] happening don't you forget that before
[1:04:19] the foundation of the world there was a
[1:04:21] time where the sons of God shouted for
[1:04:24] Joy that's right
[1:04:26] he he doesn't want us to just fall apart
[1:04:29] when things don't work out he doesn't
[1:04:31] want us to just give in when things
[1:04:34] don't work out God is looking for people
[1:04:36] with a backbone people that will stand
[1:04:39] upon the promise whether they can see it
[1:04:42] or don't see it they know that as long
[1:04:44] as there's a God in heaven I shall
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:51] live it says and tonight I say the same
[1:04:55] thing that God who stood Yonder in
[1:04:59] chapter one of the book of act and and
[1:05:02] and and he was taken up and in the sky
[1:05:06] and and be and became under his feet
[1:05:09] that said Jesus said lo I am with you
[1:05:13] always I will never leave you nor
[1:05:15] forsake you and works and it says and
[1:05:19] the works that I do ye shall ye ye shall
[1:05:22] always the works that I do shall you
[1:05:25] always I will be with you even in you to
[1:05:29] the end of the
[1:05:33] world he wants you to know that his
[1:05:36] angels are
[1:05:38] here how many can believe that he wants
[1:05:41] you to know that God is here he's not
[1:05:44] here because I said it he's here because
[1:05:48] his word promised that he will be
[1:05:53] here and and I and I let me let me even
[1:05:56] say this God is not here just when
[1:06:00] everybody atmosphere is charged and we
[1:06:02] screaming oh God oh God then God is here
[1:06:05] there's no less God than they will be at
[1:06:08] that time there's just enough God right
[1:06:11] now than there will be if this room was
[1:06:14] all shouting and
[1:06:16] screaming a shout don't bring God he's
[1:06:19] already here our problems don't take God
[1:06:22] away he's already here your sick don't
[1:06:26] move him away whatever situation you're
[1:06:28] going on if what you need is to come to
[1:06:31] an understanding that he here because
[1:06:33] his word says he's
[1:06:35] [Applause]
[1:06:37] here we the one that have a problem we
[1:06:40] run him over here we feel like there's
[1:06:43] more of him over this side than there is
[1:06:46] less of him on this side we feel like oh
[1:06:49] if we can bring more of him on this side
[1:06:51] then he will help us that's your own
[1:06:53] mind that's doing that
[1:06:56] and I will not help
[1:06:58] you what we need is to come where we are
[1:07:01] a founded Believers that's founded upon
[1:07:04] the faith of God to stand and say I
[1:07:07] don't care what's going on God is here
[1:07:10] because he promised that he will never
[1:07:12] leave
[1:07:14] me let me just jump butam speaks about
[1:07:18] uh uh uh Christopher Columbus he said
[1:07:20] yeah he was he was given a boat and and
[1:07:24] to come and explore and everything and
[1:07:26] then he says with a boat is given a
[1:07:29] bunch of coward people that didn't want
[1:07:31] to do what he was what he wanted to do
[1:07:34] they were there a bunch of slaves that
[1:07:36] were all scared so every time they'll go
[1:07:39] they'll look at him and says oh great
[1:07:41] Rovers what if there's a snake under the
[1:07:44] water that will pull down this
[1:07:47] boat he didn't respond he said well what
[1:07:50] if we get swallowed up with the wave or
[1:07:53] what if something will happen and
[1:07:55] everything what if we fall off through
[1:07:57] the age of the Earth a bunch of CED
[1:08:00] people that didn't want to do it the
[1:08:02] prophet said he looked at all of them he
[1:08:04] says whatever happened we're going to
[1:08:06] keep selling on whatever happens we're
[1:08:09] going to keep going on if we're going to
[1:08:11] fall to the edge of the Earth we're
[1:08:13] going to fall but he but whatam said he
[1:08:15] had a vision that there was something on
[1:08:18] the other side my brother my sister
[1:08:21] that's what we need this morning whether
[1:08:23] death whatever happen the Prophet the
[1:08:26] word promises that after this life
[1:08:28] there's another life coming up so if we
[1:08:30] die we're going to live
[1:08:34] again we can't be a bunch of coward
[1:08:36] people and scared oh oh if I do this
[1:08:40] what's going to happen as long as God is
[1:08:42] with you you go do
[1:08:50] it that's what God is looking for
[1:08:56] I was talking about a Jeff the other day
[1:08:59] and you know sometimes I feel like I
[1:09:01] forgot the name of the man but if I
[1:09:03] speak the story you understand his
[1:09:05] master send him and says I want you to
[1:09:08] go up and he was at the
[1:09:11] camp and he said they said I want you to
[1:09:13] go up and cut me this Jager tree and
[1:09:16] bring it down to Camp so he goes up the
[1:09:19] hills and he cuts down a tree and
[1:09:22] goodness he can barely move it he's
[1:09:25] trying by all his strength he can't move
[1:09:29] it he looked there and he says oh God I
[1:09:32] fa completely what you send me to do
[1:09:35] looking at it they just look in the SP
[1:09:37] like I can't do it and then he looked at
[1:09:40] him and
[1:09:41] said what are you
[1:09:43] doing can you not see that stream over
[1:09:47] there it says okay just roll the roll
[1:09:50] the tree into the stream and then ride
[1:09:54] on it my brother my sister that's what
[1:09:57] God wants us to do this morning he's
[1:09:59] giving you the word you said I don't
[1:10:01] know how I'm going to live it I don't
[1:10:03] know how I'm going to fulfill the word I
[1:10:04] don't know he said what I'm asking you
[1:10:07] is to write on the word of God whatever
[1:10:10] I send you I just want you to write on
[1:10:12] it oh I need the Rapture right upon the
[1:10:15] word I need healing right upon the word
[1:10:18] he's not asking you to produce it by
[1:10:20] yourself just write on it
[1:10:26] the word will produce what the word is
[1:10:29] asking for let me say that again the
[1:10:32] word will produce what the word is
[1:10:34] asking for it's not for you to produce
[1:10:37] it it's for the word to produce it in
[1:10:48] you so yeah we are giving access into
[1:10:51] the Unseen realm and and what God is
[1:10:54] wanting is oh before you can launch and
[1:10:58] make a
[1:10:59] decision
[1:11:05] now I want to say this I may not be able
[1:11:09] to get to it what what do you what
[1:11:12] what's inside of you is more important
[1:11:15] than your
[1:11:18] flesh don't forget that you have a soul
[1:11:21] that's worth a thousand world
[1:11:25] so but says this it said when we make
[1:11:29] decisions according to this flesh we are
[1:11:33] robbing that inner
[1:11:36] man we are robbing away from the inner
[1:11:39] man so what he wants us to do when we
[1:11:43] come time to make our choices and our
[1:11:46] decisions we don't need to make it
[1:11:48] through the five senses he wants us to
[1:11:51] take into consideration the inner man
[1:11:54] who's worth $10,000 and worlds and be
[1:11:56] able to make it by day because if you
[1:11:59] make it by the flesh you shall rip
[1:12:01] what's off the flesh but if you make it
[1:12:03] according to the Inner Man you will reip
[1:12:05] an eternal
[1:12:06] benefit I I hope I really said that
[1:12:09] right so what we need to do is when we
[1:12:12] want to make a
[1:12:13] decision take into consideration that
[1:12:16] there's a heaven that's for
[1:12:18] you take into consideration that you got
[1:12:21] the whole host of Heaven for you waiting
[1:12:24] to go to battlef for you waiting to
[1:12:26] defend you waiting to do everything that
[1:12:29] you're looking for but you cannot
[1:12:31] consider that you cannot wait for that
[1:12:33] to happen if you're making that decision
[1:12:36] according to the temporal
[1:12:39] things he will
[1:12:41] say we we have to take that into
[1:12:45] consideration and I thought about here
[1:12:48] he
[1:12:49] is you think about just this this king
[1:12:53] of Israel what what a benefit it was for
[1:12:58] them to have a prophet in the
[1:13:02] camp what benefit it was to have one
[1:13:06] that was known to be a prophet in the
[1:13:09] camp just how much benefit how much life
[1:13:15] how how their lives were spare how that
[1:13:19] they want to a lot of battles because
[1:13:21] they had one who was called the prophet
[1:13:24] in the camp
[1:13:31] and and you can go and read it it's
[1:13:33] basically the whole history of Israel
[1:13:36] you you you would think how how can you
[1:13:39] how can you win a battle just by going
[1:13:41] around the walls and
[1:13:47] singing Tell me another Army that's done
[1:13:51] that how can you win a war by taking the
[1:13:56] numbers
[1:13:59] down by saying we there's too many of us
[1:14:03] we need to cut down the
[1:14:06] numbers tell me another Army that does
[1:14:14] that you see the the it was an
[1:14:18] understanding of the Unseen resources
[1:14:21] that was at their disposal they knew it
[1:14:24] very well that if we would listen to The
[1:14:27] Prophet if we would follow what God has
[1:14:29] told us through the prophet that's where
[1:14:31] our success lies and let me say this you
[1:14:34] will never be successful by not
[1:14:37] listening to the
[1:14:40] prophet I'm
[1:14:42] sorry we will never be successful
[1:14:45] outside of the Prophet you say well we
[1:14:48] follow God has ask you which
[1:14:51] God when did he speak to you because the
[1:14:55] word of God only comes to the
[1:15:00] prophet you see that's the confusion of
[1:15:02] denomination everybody thinks they have
[1:15:05] access direct to God God can talk to
[1:15:07] them no God only talks to the
[1:15:17] prophet that's the order he's
[1:15:21] established you know people have the
[1:15:23] audacity to take the Bible and try to
[1:15:25] correct the
[1:15:27] prophet who are
[1:15:31] you the scripture says it was by the
[1:15:35] prophet that Israel was called out it
[1:15:38] was by the prophet that the Lord
[1:15:40] protected them it was always by the
[1:15:43] prophet it was by the word of God and
[1:15:45] let me say this today Rapture will only
[1:15:48] come by the word of the
[1:15:52] Prophet the Lord God should do nothing
[1:15:55] except it Reveals His secret to the
[1:16:01] prophet you want to be successful follow
[1:16:04] the prophet follow the prophet in your
[1:16:07] marriage in your business in every
[1:16:09] decision you make everything include the
[1:16:12] prophet that's the
[1:16:16] success you keep the prophet
[1:16:19] out you keep God
[1:16:22] out because the prophet doesn't speak in
[1:16:25] his own word anyway he speaks the words
[1:16:27] of God whatever comes out of the Prophet
[1:16:31] butam says that Jesus came by the words
[1:16:34] of the
[1:16:35] prophet and the bride will come by the
[1:16:38] words of the
[1:16:45] Prophet so the word will say the prophet
[1:16:48] will say so faith is now given if we can
[1:16:52] come to an understanding there's this
[1:16:54] unseen real but Apostle spoke about the
[1:16:57] resources that's made available to the
[1:16:59] believer let me say this I I and and
[1:17:03] through science I believe most of us
[1:17:05] here all of us here should have the
[1:17:07] understanding to know that our eyes
[1:17:09] can't see everything that's
[1:17:11] right we and and we know that we can't
[1:17:14] hear everything you know my kids hear
[1:17:16] things that I don't hear you know
[1:17:18] they're like What's that I'm like I
[1:17:21] can't
[1:17:22] hear my eyes can't see like other eyes
[1:17:25] cannot can
[1:17:27] see so we can truly just by science we
[1:17:32] can understand that our very five senses
[1:17:35] are extremely limited not limited but
[1:17:38] extremely Limited in fact you may even
[1:17:41] hear something that don't
[1:17:46] exist and you may get confused someone
[1:17:49] say something you hear
[1:17:50] another and how can we make eternal
[1:17:55] decisions on those five
[1:17:57] senses how can we make decisions that
[1:18:00] have eternal consequences based on
[1:18:05] that butam says one place that man was
[1:18:09] not even created to think for
[1:18:14] himself he was made so that the mind
[1:18:17] that is in Christ be in
[1:18:19] him think about this the the devil is
[1:18:22] the auor of the thinking
[1:18:26] will I really die if I ate this will
[1:18:29] will this really happen God told them
[1:18:31] the day you eat you die no questions no
[1:18:36] thinking it's the devil who introduced
[1:18:39] the thinking behind and said will that
[1:18:42] really it wants to reason with him the
[1:18:44] word of God is not given for
[1:18:51] reasoning but when will say I love this
[1:18:54] this is a message of super sense
[1:18:56] paragraph uh 53 he says it says this is
[1:19:01] preached in December 27 paragraph 53
[1:19:04] says now God gave you those senses but
[1:19:07] you are given for you as a gift and it
[1:19:10] depends on how on how it depends on how
[1:19:15] you what you yield your senses to you
[1:19:18] will be it says will be the will be will
[1:19:21] be the way that your life is controlled
[1:19:26] the way you yield those senses five
[1:19:28] senses it says what you see what you
[1:19:31] hear what you taste and smell and feel
[1:19:34] whatever those senses are yielded to
[1:19:36] they will do they will dominate
[1:19:39] you so think about that so we we we our
[1:19:43] yielding of our senses is very important
[1:19:46] now it continue it says and we are
[1:19:49] grateful to God that we have the five
[1:19:52] senses but by no no
[1:19:55] means was these five senses given to
[1:19:59] guide
[1:20:00] you he says there were given to you for
[1:20:04] Earthly contact but they were given but
[1:20:08] it says but it was given you the six
[1:20:10] sense and the six sense is beyond beyond
[1:20:14] only only the only to the belong only to
[1:20:17] the Christian and you cannot have the
[1:20:20] six sense until you become a Christian
[1:20:25] I I think that's very clear you are not
[1:20:28] born again you don't have access to the
[1:20:30] six
[1:20:31] cents if you ever thought that you were
[1:20:33] not born again but somehow no you
[1:20:36] don't it's as clear as could be access
[1:20:40] to the six cense requires a new birth so
[1:20:43] you get access to the six cense when you
[1:20:45] are born again you you said there the
[1:20:48] until you become a Christian and it says
[1:20:50] and is the only is the only way that you
[1:20:53] can ever have any more than five natural
[1:20:56] senses for your natural person but the
[1:20:59] six sense is better known to the
[1:21:01] Christian as Faith it's the only listen
[1:21:05] to this it's the one that governs and
[1:21:08] guides you and it is the superior to all
[1:21:12] the other senses it's a superior to all
[1:21:15] the senses to the other five
[1:21:18] senses so let me say this that's why I
[1:21:21] let me repeat again don't be quick to
[1:21:24] make making a decision without the
[1:21:27] understanding that the one that really
[1:21:28] does the guiding is the six
[1:21:32] sense I I thought about
[1:21:35] David uh David he goes and he goes
[1:21:39] to he comes back to the
[1:21:42] camp and they find out that all the
[1:21:45] families and everybody was
[1:21:47] taken now David could have went to war
[1:21:51] but the scripture says that David came
[1:21:53] in
[1:21:54] he he came and everybody started blaming
[1:21:58] him it's your fault if we didn't go if
[1:22:00] we didn't do this this was never going
[1:22:02] to happen in everything David went and
[1:22:05] he sat there even though he had the
[1:22:07] right to go to war he consulted with God
[1:22:10] first waited to hear from God and God
[1:22:13] spoke to him and said go to war then he
[1:22:15] went to war that's what God wants us to
[1:22:17] do whenever difficulties come whenever
[1:22:20] challenges come whenever we get ready to
[1:22:22] make a decision he doesn't want you just
[1:22:24] to run just because you are right it
[1:22:27] doesn't mean you have to do it just
[1:22:29] because this happened it doesn't mean
[1:22:30] you have to react and he wants you to
[1:22:33] consult with him he wants you to go and
[1:22:35] know what word am I standing on what
[1:22:38] what what is my six sense telling me
[1:22:41] what is it that I really have to do what
[1:22:43] is it am I doing this as a temporary
[1:22:46] decision or is it something now will
[1:22:48] take me a long way
[1:22:55] we fell we fell trapped to that many
[1:23:00] times we make decisions
[1:23:02] because we were
[1:23:05] desperate we felt like we needed it
[1:23:07] quicker we felt like if I waited it was
[1:23:10] going to take too long we feel like oh I
[1:23:12] want to we did it for
[1:23:15] self-preservation God don't want you to
[1:23:17] preserve yourself he wants you to be he
[1:23:20] wants to be the one who's preserving you
[1:23:22] he wants to be the one guiding you he
[1:23:24] wants when all is said and none he wants
[1:23:27] to be the one who's got his hand on
[1:23:31] you he continues on and it says
[1:23:34] paragraph 55 it says now I would say
[1:23:38] that I would say it says I would not say
[1:23:41] that because you have received the six
[1:23:44] sense that the five senses are no no no
[1:23:46] good for no more yes they are those five
[1:23:50] five senses were given to you by God I
[1:23:53] like the way the prophet put that things
[1:23:55] those five senses were given to you by
[1:23:57] God but they are not to be
[1:23:59] used but when the five senses act
[1:24:04] contrary to the word of God then they
[1:24:06] are
[1:24:12] lying you're not saved I'm
[1:24:16] saved I don't care what my S is
[1:24:20] tell the the the saving is not a fact
[1:24:24] to the
[1:24:27] senses you you're not Sav when you feel
[1:24:30] like you're sitting in Heavenly places
[1:24:32] you could be in a hell that's right God
[1:24:35] is
[1:24:37] there everything could be going on fire
[1:24:41] god is
[1:24:44] there our emotions are not there to
[1:24:47] bring God God is already
[1:24:50] there oh if we can get beyond the five
[1:24:54] cent said and I'm speaking even to
[1:24:56] myself you know it's not because we come
[1:24:58] and the church is half empty then God is
[1:25:00] not here as much as you no remember the
[1:25:03] prophet say a spoonful of the ocean
[1:25:06] water is equal to the whole
[1:25:12] ocean if we can fix our understanding oh
[1:25:16] I say that's what the message of the end
[1:25:18] time came to do it wasn't that God
[1:25:22] was uh he came to necessarily do
[1:25:25] something new but he came to open our
[1:25:27] eyes so we can get the vision of what
[1:25:30] happened in
[1:25:37] heaven Oh my he talks about a uh Moses
[1:25:41] he says Moses stood there he had access
[1:25:45] to everything Naturally
[1:25:50] Speaking he was he had he was the prince
[1:25:54] he had if he wanted to save the children
[1:25:58] of Israel he could have just waited a
[1:26:00] couple of years until he became pharaoh
[1:26:03] and then he took them out or just let
[1:26:06] them go but that was in God's program
[1:26:09] butam says every time he stood upon the
[1:26:11] balcony when Pharaoh looked and he saw a
[1:26:14] bunch of slave every time when he looked
[1:26:17] he saw the people of God and brother
[1:26:20] says by Vision he looked at Egypt being
[1:26:23] the greatest army that there was he saw
[1:26:26] them in
[1:26:29] flame I want you to think about that
[1:26:31] yeah they are the greatest army that
[1:26:34] existed he's looking at them because why
[1:26:37] he was looking through the Unseen
[1:26:44] eyes I wonder if we look our situations
[1:26:47] to the
[1:26:48] endc I wonder if we consider the end in
[1:26:52] our decision making I wonder if we are
[1:26:54] considering that there's more than what
[1:26:57] our eyes could
[1:27:00] see will continue on in the super sense
[1:27:04] he says that paragraph 57 he says and
[1:27:07] the super sense is the holy spirit Faith
[1:27:09] the faith of God that dwelleth in you
[1:27:13] and he will it says and if you will let
[1:27:17] the five senses be yielded to the six
[1:27:19] sense it will guide you and bring all
[1:27:22] the other five senses under control
[1:27:24] control of the super sense for it says
[1:27:27] for it's for it's for it's far above the
[1:27:30] natural sense and the spiritual uh man
[1:27:34] is above the
[1:27:35] natural it says it's as far high as the
[1:27:39] heavens is above the natural man and is
[1:27:43] the five senses it says and he makes you
[1:27:46] believe things that you cannot see
[1:27:55] it makes you
[1:27:57] act where you where you do not think the
[1:28:00] five senses would ever think about it
[1:28:04] the devil can get into these five senses
[1:28:07] and lie to you but it cannot touch the
[1:28:10] super sense that's far beyond his reach
[1:28:14] that come that come from God it's called
[1:28:17] faith and faith is that great
[1:28:22] thing that's why we need to operate
[1:28:24] faith is that great thing he wants us to
[1:28:27] operate by the six sense he wants you to
[1:28:30] know that there's an army I was thinking
[1:28:32] about this I thought yeah we are you
[1:28:34] know we live in the age of AI and all
[1:28:37] the great things that man is able to do
[1:28:39] artificial intelligence but when I'm
[1:28:41] speaks about in the countdown here is
[1:28:43] men went from horse and buggy and they
[1:28:45] went to uh uh bicycles and uh uh
[1:28:49] Automobiles and you he went to cars and
[1:28:51] airplanes and then astronaut but God
[1:28:54] says but God has a different order their
[1:28:57] astronaut has to go and be put into an
[1:29:00] isolation clothing that he can go if he
[1:29:02] breathe the air from outside he will die
[1:29:04] but our astronaut went up there without
[1:29:11] nothing man is always because remember
[1:29:15] says that man gets into and let me just
[1:29:20] let me
[1:29:21] just for the sake of time now now let me
[1:29:25] say this and then we'll get into that we
[1:29:28] we understand that we we live in what is
[1:29:31] known as the three dimension so we have
[1:29:34] time we have light we have matter so we
[1:29:38] we understand that that's that's the
[1:29:40] dimension that we are in and and we
[1:29:43] understand that there's what is known as
[1:29:44] the fourth
[1:29:46] dimension and I'm will talk about it we
[1:29:48] know uh television and radio in fact it
[1:29:52] would say that if we would have a
[1:29:53] perfect receiver here will be able to
[1:29:55] receive those things they are here
[1:29:57] there's video flying in this room
[1:29:59] there's sounds that are flying in this
[1:30:01] room our eyes are not made to see them
[1:30:04] but if we put a perfect receiver we'll
[1:30:06] be able to get them we understand that
[1:30:08] and we understand that the the The Fifth
[1:30:10] Dimension is known as the region of the
[1:30:12] lost and we know that there's the region
[1:30:15] of the Lost there's the demon spirit and
[1:30:17] then there's
[1:30:19] hell excuse me for a second
[1:30:45] is the the we we go from this three
[1:30:48] dimension that we live in which is time
[1:30:50] light and matter we move on to the
[1:30:53] fourth Dimension which is the the the
[1:30:56] signal the the the the the radio and and
[1:30:59] and the television and the signals and
[1:31:01] all those things we go in The Fifth
[1:31:03] Dimension that that representation of
[1:31:06] the region of the Lost and the region of
[1:31:09] uh of demons and then hell where where
[1:31:12] where Satan uh is H and and then we we
[1:31:16] go we understand that banam talks about
[1:31:19] the sixth Dimension which is heaven uh
[1:31:22] where where where those that are resting
[1:31:24] knows that die in Christ where they are
[1:31:25] found and then we know that that's where
[1:31:28] bam went when he went through the the
[1:31:30] the beyond the curtain and when he asked
[1:31:32] where Jesus was they said it was a
[1:31:34] dimension above which was the seventh
[1:31:36] Dimension so he would come and but he
[1:31:38] was residing in the seven Dimension so
[1:31:41] we understand those are the Realms and I
[1:31:43] want to say this the realm that we are
[1:31:45] in is the realm of manifestation so the
[1:31:49] the the demons are pricing into this
[1:31:51] realm and they need a human body in
[1:31:54] order for them to be manifested but we
[1:31:56] also understand that God's holy spirit
[1:31:59] is placing in this Dimension that's why
[1:32:01] prop will say that as Heaven is
[1:32:04] represented on this Dimension so is
[1:32:06] heaven also so hell is represented by
[1:32:09] the demons and they'll go upon the
[1:32:11] people and manifest themselves and we
[1:32:14] understand that was also say that the
[1:32:16] same way that heaven is here and heaven
[1:32:19] heaven has has to be manifested in the
[1:32:22] people
[1:32:23] amen so there's a battle going on around
[1:32:26] us at all the time why because the holy
[1:32:29] spirit is here to motivate you to entice
[1:32:33] you to move you is wanting you to cause
[1:32:36] you so you can realize you're in a great
[1:32:38] battle so when the Devil comes and he
[1:32:41] changes the vision of what's in front of
[1:32:43] you what you don't need is to broke down
[1:32:45] and fail what you need is to call for a
[1:32:48] heavenly vision to be manifested
[1:32:55] I thought about
[1:32:57] Jonah my
[1:32:59] goodness you think about impossible
[1:33:02] situation Not only was he in the ocean
[1:33:06] but he was in the Well's
[1:33:11] belly and the scripture says but but I
[1:33:14] like how it says everywhere he
[1:33:17] turned he looked I mean would you even
[1:33:21] know which way is north south or east
[1:33:23] are you looking up or are you looking
[1:33:28] down but job look and he says this is
[1:33:32] lying
[1:33:33] vanity he called it he looked at it he
[1:33:36] call it lying vanity it says once again
[1:33:39] will I look towards your Holy Temple my
[1:33:42] brother my sister let me say this in the
[1:33:44] name of the Lord the invisible the
[1:33:47] Unseen is more real than what you
[1:33:51] see let me say that again what we see
[1:33:55] what we touch is not real what's more
[1:33:58] real is what comes from the
[1:34:02] UN oh I have pain and yeah I have pain I
[1:34:06] can feel it I know you can feel it but I
[1:34:08] want you to call the heavenly
[1:34:17] vision
[1:34:19] oh if we can only move to those senses
[1:34:26] one one says in a message looking into
[1:34:28] the Unseen I know we have a baptism so
[1:34:31] I'll come to a close soon I love this
[1:34:35] and if you didn't get anything if you
[1:34:38] can only understand this if you can put
[1:34:40] it up there looking into the Unseen
[1:34:42] paragraph n the same one I've been
[1:34:44] reading preaching 58 this uh 58 October
[1:34:50] 3rd he says this
[1:34:54] N9 it
[1:34:56] says now may the Lord add a blessing to
[1:34:59] the reading of his
[1:35:01] word isn't it a strange thing that man
[1:35:06] who was made in the image of God and in
[1:35:09] the likeness of God was called of him to
[1:35:13] walk by faith believing that God is and
[1:35:18] would choose to walk by sight instead of
[1:35:21] by faith after his makeup his being and
[1:35:27] all that dwell in him was fashioned in
[1:35:30] the likeness of God think about it I
[1:35:34] think that's a strong statement you were
[1:35:38] not made to walk by the five
[1:35:40] senses it's isn't that even the message
[1:35:43] of the hour he's coming to let you know
[1:35:45] before you were flesh made you were
[1:35:47] Heavenly made
[1:35:51] first I I thought our prayers should be
[1:35:54] like Jesus everywhere we go we said
[1:35:56] father I want what was done in heaven to
[1:35:59] be made known on
[1:36:03] Earth everywhere we go our desire is the
[1:36:06] manifestation of what was H in heaven to
[1:36:10] be made we are representative of heaven
[1:36:13] we are not representative of this flesh
[1:36:15] of this Earth we were placed in this
[1:36:18] Earth so that the heaven can be
[1:36:20] manifested throughout yes sir
[1:36:24] it
[1:36:25] says and all that dwell in him was
[1:36:28] fashion in the likeness of God and God
[1:36:31] who is that great Jehovah who call those
[1:36:34] things which were not as though they
[1:36:38] were calling out of the Unseen into the
[1:36:43] visible realm and man was made to live
[1:36:47] with God in the in this manner and yet
[1:36:51] he chooses to walk by his sight he
[1:36:54] wanted to be his own boss he wanted no
[1:36:57] man to tell him what to do that's just
[1:37:00] the nature of
[1:37:04] man I say God take away that nature take
[1:37:07] away that nature I have surrendered my
[1:37:10] works when I got born again I have given
[1:37:13] up all my rights I don't want to have
[1:37:15] the nature of man I don't want to have
[1:37:17] the thinking of man I want the thoughts
[1:37:19] of Christ to become my thoughts let me
[1:37:21] say this you will achieve more by faith
[1:37:24] that you can ever achieve with any of
[1:37:27] your
[1:37:28] senses we can put all our heads together
[1:37:31] what we'll achieve by faith will be a
[1:37:34] lot greater than what we can achieve
[1:37:36] with our own
[1:37:37] mind God wants us to achieve by faith he
[1:37:40] wants us to come together let me say you
[1:37:43] talk about atomic bomb the Christian has
[1:37:45] a much bigger atomic bomb than what men
[1:37:48] can create tell me one thing that men
[1:37:51] can create that's greater than what can
[1:37:53] God create
[1:37:55] they're still trying to figure out how
[1:37:56] the Red Sea open they're still trying to
[1:37:59] figure out how the Sun
[1:38:03] stop was it the Earth that stopped was
[1:38:06] it the sun I don't know you go figure
[1:38:08] that
[1:38:09] out all I know is man spoke and it came
[1:38:13] to
[1:38:17] pass let's
[1:38:20] use that sense let's walk by faith and
[1:38:24] not by sight but when I'm says
[1:38:27] Abraham Abraham he went no not knowing
[1:38:32] where he was going he went from tent to
[1:38:36] tent looking and waiting for that City
[1:38:39] whose build a maker was
[1:38:42] God but when I'm says it was by the
[1:38:45] Unseen by faith he saw Isaac before
[1:38:49] Isaac could even be manifested oh my
[1:38:52] brother my sister let me say this if you
[1:38:54] walk with the Unseen this morning you
[1:38:56] will see your rapture you'll see your
[1:38:59] body change you'll see whatever you have
[1:39:01] need of you'll see that God walking next
[1:39:04] to you you'll see that victory that you
[1:39:06] are looking for you'll see the good
[1:39:08] health next to you you'll see everything
[1:39:10] now but the only way you can see it is
[1:39:13] through the Unseen it's not through your
[1:39:15] natural eyes the way it works is it
[1:39:17] comes from The Unseen into the natural
[1:39:21] how did you get here this morning
[1:39:28] how did you believe this
[1:39:32] message did you look at the message and
[1:39:34] say well let me find out if this Prophet
[1:39:37] is really true I'm going to study the
[1:39:39] Bible and prove
[1:39:42] it if that's you you're at the wrong
[1:39:49] place it was God but when says you
[1:39:53] stumble into sub Mission somewhere and
[1:39:56] you heard the preacher preaching you
[1:39:58] couldn't even remember what the preacher
[1:40:00] was saying but something within the
[1:40:02] heart was beating you said oh God save
[1:40:05] my soul oh God I have need of you and he
[1:40:08] took you from wherever you are drunken
[1:40:11] prostitute murderers whatever you were
[1:40:14] he brought you into a son and a daughter
[1:40:16] of God what did that bam says faith did
[1:40:19] that when you believe God gave you a
[1:40:22] faith to drive out of those
[1:40:26] things and if we started by faith we're
[1:40:29] going to change it later
[1:40:32] no that faith is here building up but
[1:40:35] what I'm says it's the accumulation of
[1:40:37] all the faith it's the accumulation of
[1:40:41] all that you have seen all that you have
[1:40:44] heard all that your eyes have seen
[1:40:46] everything that God has been dying doing
[1:40:49] since the beginning the foundation of
[1:40:51] the world is accumulated in this same
[1:40:53] time it's accumulated so much that we
[1:40:56] saw God in the human
[1:41:00] flesh the believer we read it it's the
[1:41:03] faith of God that moves in you those are
[1:41:07] no words to just entice our intellect
[1:41:10] that's the reality of the Living
[1:41:13] God I I don't want to do things by my
[1:41:16] strength I want the faith of God to come
[1:41:18] in my heart raise me up at a bed in the
[1:41:21] morning say you're going to go to church
[1:41:23] today you said I'm not feeling well the
[1:41:25] Faith said whether you feel well you
[1:41:27] don't feel well we're going to
[1:41:30] [Applause]
[1:41:31] church I know when when I've messed up I
[1:41:34] don't know what to do I don't want to
[1:41:36] see anybody the faith of God comes
[1:41:38] inside of you and said stand up you're
[1:41:40] not going to stay down stand up we're
[1:41:43] going to
[1:41:45] go when I don't know how to pay my bills
[1:41:48] I don't know what's going on and I don't
[1:41:50] know what what I'm going to do and
[1:41:51] everything the faith of God comes and
[1:41:53] say you don't have to worry I've got you
[1:41:56] I'm going to take care of you when I'm
[1:41:58] sick the faith of God said I'm the Lord
[1:42:01] God that healed all th diseases that's
[1:42:03] how God want us he wants
[1:42:07] fellowship and not some type of
[1:42:10] religion he wants
[1:42:12] Fellowship where we become one with him
[1:42:16] where people will looking and say you
[1:42:18] surely are crazy you said I'm crazy for
[1:42:21] Jesus amen
[1:42:24] there's nothing wrong with that I think
[1:42:25] the problem is some people don't want to
[1:42:27] be called crazy I call myself crazy to
[1:42:29] begin
[1:42:31] with so I'm not ashamed for anybody to
[1:42:34] add and call me crazy it's just going to
[1:42:37] confirm what I've been thinking for a
[1:42:38] long
[1:42:46] time let me say this we are called to
[1:42:50] walk by faith there's unseen but one
[1:42:55] says if the world with the five senses
[1:42:58] they reach out into this other dimension
[1:43:01] and they pull down things vaccine
[1:43:05] cars uh planes what where are they
[1:43:08] getting it from they're not getting in
[1:43:09] from this Dimension you know the prophet
[1:43:11] say that they're coming in they're
[1:43:12] bringing it from the other dimension he
[1:43:14] says how much more a Christian how much
[1:43:17] more untapped resources do we have we
[1:43:21] are not made to live and try to support
[1:43:24] ourselves we are made to call on things
[1:43:28] that are not as though they were and the
[1:43:31] reality that the devil is beinging
[1:43:33] before us butam says we are called to
[1:43:36] look at those things that are as though
[1:43:38] they were
[1:43:40] not if the musician could
[1:43:49] come but says paragraph 10
[1:43:55] but man is like a
[1:43:58] sheep and the Sheep
[1:44:01] cannot find its way back I'm
[1:44:06] told when it's lost it's totally
[1:44:14] lost it
[1:44:16] says and that's the way with men when
[1:44:21] he's lost is
[1:44:24] absolutely
[1:44:27] helpless he must have a Shepherd to
[1:44:30] guide
[1:44:31] him and man when he
[1:44:34] chooses as the day goes on we find out
[1:44:38] that
[1:44:39] continually getting
[1:44:42] worse choosing rather to walk by
[1:44:48] sight then instead by faith in then
[1:44:52] instead by Faith by the
[1:44:58] Unseen and when he does that he robs the
[1:45:02] inner man which is the
[1:45:05] soul and that's the Eternal part of that
[1:45:10] man you you would think today that man
[1:45:14] will make much better decision that men
[1:45:17] in the 70s or
[1:45:21] 60s you would think think
[1:45:24] thing but today it's completely
[1:45:28] rabbish I mean it's foolishness to see
[1:45:31] the things that men is coming out of
[1:45:33] men's mouth to see the debates that you
[1:45:36] hear either on politics or other stuff
[1:45:39] you're like is this what man has turned
[1:45:42] into this is the prophet speaking it it
[1:45:44] says once he's made the wrong decision
[1:45:47] the more he continues he's only showing
[1:45:50] his foolishness continually
[1:45:54] you know it's like a man finding an
[1:45:56] error the more you push him the more you
[1:45:58] just he's just digging it right I mean
[1:46:00] it's just continually you know the best
[1:46:04] thing to do sometimes when you're wrong
[1:46:05] is just to shut
[1:46:10] up it's just
[1:46:16] digging God is saying look
[1:46:19] come you you made wrong you you made the
[1:46:22] wrong decision you walk by the flesh you
[1:46:24] walk by the five senses that was okay
[1:46:27] but now it's time to turn around now
[1:46:30] it's time to walk by the spirit now it's
[1:46:32] time to put the five senses to put the
[1:46:35] six Senses Into the equation now it's
[1:46:37] time to consider heaven now it's time to
[1:46:40] consider all the other resources that
[1:46:42] are made available and let me say this
[1:46:44] you are not made to be successful
[1:46:47] without the heaven
[1:46:53] Heaven is your success Heaven is your
[1:46:56] blueprint the word of God is how you
[1:46:59] become successful the the success that
[1:47:02] comes from the Christian is the ability
[1:47:05] to apply what the six sense is working
[1:47:08] in
[1:47:09] us let's all stand
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:29] but bam says in paragraph
[1:47:32] 11 of that same message it
[1:47:35] says men shall not leave by bread alone
[1:47:39] sayth the Lord but by every word that
[1:47:40] proceeded out of the mouth of God and
[1:47:43] then it says and the man's physical
[1:47:49] being to take care of it is not not all
[1:47:53] the reasons God put him on here on Earth
[1:47:57] think about it to take care of your
[1:47:59] physical Reon is not altogether the
[1:48:02] reason why you are putting in here
[1:48:04] because what it does with a physical
[1:48:07] being amount to very little his
[1:48:11] soul is soul what
[1:48:13] counts it's the inward man that did not
[1:48:18] come from the earth it comes from heaven
[1:48:21] and that's the Eternal part of of the
[1:48:23] human being but
[1:48:25] yet strange that he tries to figure out
[1:48:29] his own way out and we find out so so in
[1:48:34] the
[1:48:34] scriptures that when man chooses to walk
[1:48:38] by his own way and do the and do the way
[1:48:42] that he wants to do God just let him
[1:48:46] alone he says man must not think for
[1:48:51] himself he must have he must he must let
[1:48:54] the mind that was in Christ be in him we
[1:48:57] are not to think for ourselves we are we
[1:49:00] are to call anything contrary to what is
[1:49:04] said as though it is not no matter what
[1:49:07] or I see or what our eyes claim to be we
[1:49:12] do not live by what we see we live by
[1:49:16] what we believe I love that I love that
[1:49:21] imagine this morning and you know the
[1:49:23] doctors is giv the notes and saying you
[1:49:26] will never amount to nothing you will
[1:49:28] die and you have cancer you will never
[1:49:30] have a child and this will happen
[1:49:32] imagine that's the what the doctors have
[1:49:35] given you imagine that's the reality
[1:49:37] that the world has presented to
[1:49:40] you yes he the prophet saying that you
[1:49:42] cannot live by that we live by what we
[1:49:45] believe oh this morning if I can say you
[1:49:48] know what the doctor say I'm going to
[1:49:50] live God said the doctor said I'm I'm
[1:49:52] going to die God said I'm going to live
[1:49:54] the doctor say I'm sick I'm well the
[1:49:57] doctor said I can't have a baby God has
[1:49:59] not said that I imagine if we can
[1:50:02] replace what the doctors are saying with
[1:50:05] what the word is saying imagine how much
[1:50:08] success will
[1:50:12] get but if we feel like we are stuck and
[1:50:14] we feel that's the outter man that's
[1:50:17] talking to you don't talk to the outer
[1:50:20] man let the inner man talk to you for a
[1:50:22] moment
[1:50:23] let that six sense talk to you let that
[1:50:25] six sense be lifted up that's why the
[1:50:28] preaching of the word is to energize the
[1:50:30] faith that's inside of us so we can
[1:50:33] contact the Unseen RAM and know that
[1:50:36] that God is living and he's here this
[1:50:38] morning and today why to make his word a
[1:50:42] reality
[1:50:44] amen if you have a it upon your heart
[1:50:46] why don't you just lift your hand up to
[1:50:48] him I want to say within my heart this
[1:50:50] morning I said Lord I I I have walked by
[1:50:53] the five senses so many times and I made
[1:50:57] decisions day in and day out by the five
[1:50:59] senses every time and you know a child
[1:51:02] is sick it's the five senses that goes
[1:51:04] out first and this happen the five
[1:51:06] senses jumps out first and this Happ in
[1:51:08] the five cents Lord I I I don't mind but
[1:51:11] I want to I want the six cents to be
[1:51:14] activated this morning Father I want
[1:51:16] when even when the five senses come I
[1:51:19] don't want to stop right there I want to
[1:51:21] include the six senses in the equation I
[1:51:23] want to include heaven in the equation I
[1:51:26] want to think for a moment about the
[1:51:28] antip resources that you have for me I
[1:51:31] want to consider what your possibility
[1:51:34] is I want to look upon the Eternal I
[1:51:37] want to know that all things are
[1:51:38] possible I want to know that this is not
[1:51:40] the end of me I want to know that
[1:51:42] there's a God and there's an army and
[1:51:45] there's everything made available to
[1:51:47] fight for me I want to consider that
[1:51:50] before I can make my final decision if
[1:51:53] that's your heart desire just lift up to
[1:51:55] him and you pray to him this morning in
[1:51:57] your own mouth and say Lord I want the

[2:04:03] amen praise
[2:04:05] God I I tell you this is what the church
[2:04:08] was built for this is this is when the
[2:04:12] church is at best is when souls are
[2:04:14] being born that's the purpose of the
[2:04:16] soul the the church is to gather up the
[2:04:19] souls those elected ones from every
[2:04:22] generation that we bring in into the
[2:04:24] kingdom of God because remember it says
[2:04:26] this promise is to you and unto you and
[2:04:28] unto your children's children as many as
[2:04:31] our Lord God shall call so a Kurt wants
[2:04:33] to be baptized and the scripture says
[2:04:35] here in uh acts
[2:04:39] 237 it says now when they when they
[2:04:42] heard this they were pricked in their
[2:04:44] heart and said unto Peter and the rest
[2:04:47] of the Apostle men and Brethren what
[2:04:49] shall we do then Peter said unto them
[2:04:52] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:04:55] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:04:58] remission of your sins and ye shall
[2:05:00] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[2:05:03] the promise is unto you and and your
[2:05:05] children and to all that are far off
[2:05:08] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:05:11] call and with many other words did he
[2:05:14] testify and exort saying save yourself
[2:05:16] from this unto generation I'm so glad
[2:05:20] because this is really what faith will
[2:05:23] do we heard it this morning Faith gives
[2:05:26] you access to the other Kingdom so when
[2:05:28] our brother gets baptized there's the
[2:05:30] promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:33] and let me say this to anybody and and I
[2:05:36] you know especially our young people
[2:05:38] they always run it do I have the Holy
[2:05:39] Ghost you receiving the Holy Ghost is
[2:05:42] not up to you you follow the formula God
[2:05:46] is obligated to give it to
[2:05:48] you it you follow you you repent repent
[2:05:51] and you are baptized God it becomes
[2:05:54] God's obligation to give it to you in
[2:05:57] fact let me even say this what caus you
[2:05:59] to come to be baptized it's the Holy
[2:06:01] Ghost working in you it's the spirit of
[2:06:04] God working in you knocking and working
[2:06:06] and bringing the seed that was
[2:06:09] predestinated into the perfect
[2:06:11] manifestation and we are happy to see it
[2:06:13] and I told him I said now you get the
[2:06:16] six sense now you get access to that
[2:06:19] other dimension now the Unseen will be
[2:06:21] made visible for you amen Amen brother
[2:06:25] CCT we as we are commissioned to go into
[2:06:29] all the world the scripture says go into
[2:06:31] the all the world and baptize them in
[2:06:34] the name of the Father the Son and the
[2:06:36] Holy Spirit and by divine revelation we
[2:06:40] have been uh uh told and we have been
[2:06:43] taught by the prophet at the end time
[2:06:45] that the name of the Father and Son and
[2:06:47] Holy Spirit is the name of the Lord
[2:06:49] Jesus Christ so therefore we baptize you
[2:06:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:08] Christ amen there's another one so
[2:07:11] sister Twilight
[2:07:16] yes you want to say something no no okay
[2:07:22] all right so the same promise as we read
[2:07:25] it said when they heard that were
[2:07:26] pricked in the heart and they asked men
[2:07:28] and Brethren what shall we do there's
[2:07:30] only one formula repent and be baptized
[2:07:34] and you shall re in the name of the Lord
[2:07:36] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[2:07:37] blessings and here's the blessings that
[2:07:40] comes with this when you are repent you
[2:07:42] you repent you are baptized you are
[2:07:44] automatically part of the kingdom and
[2:07:46] let me say this there's no other way
[2:07:49] into the kingdom except by the new birth
[2:07:51] and the new birth is not your own
[2:07:53] imagination is the obedience to the word
[2:07:56] The Obedience to the word of God that en
[2:07:59] entitles you to the Token so a sister is
[2:08:02] obeying the word of God she's been
[2:08:04] pricked within her hearts and she wants
[2:08:06] to be baptized and therefore by being
[2:08:08] baptized she will by default receive the
[2:08:12] gift of the Holy Ghost so sister tler we
[2:08:15] as I said we are commissioned to go into
[2:08:17] all the world and baptize every single
[2:08:19] one of them that will believe and there
[2:08:21] therefore we baptize you in the name of
[2:08:23] the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:08:25] which by divine revelation we believe is
[2:08:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:30] therefore we baptize you in the name of
[2:08:31] the Lord Jesus Christ
