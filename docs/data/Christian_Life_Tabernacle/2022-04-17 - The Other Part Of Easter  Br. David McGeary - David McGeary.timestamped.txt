[0:00] man's forefather
[0:01] and that's what thrills our heart we ask
[0:04] you to bless us this evening as we have
[0:06] this little time of fellowship
[0:09] waiting for our campers to arrive or we
[0:12] just ask that you bless us now in jesus
[0:15] precious name we pray
[0:17] amen and if you have your bibles let's
[0:20] open back again to the book of luke
[0:25] the gospel of luke
[0:31] the 46th verse
[0:36] of the 24th chapter and
[0:39] just a little evangelistic thought for
[0:41] this evening just to
[0:45] abide our time
[0:47] and
[0:49] rejoice in god's word
[0:51] so the 46th verse
[0:54] it says and he said unto them now we
[0:56] know that this is the
[0:58] story of the two
[1:04] disciples
[1:05] walking back from on the road to emmaus
[1:08] and
[1:09] and so
[1:10] they're on this journey and
[1:13] they're talking within themselves and
[1:15] then all of a sudden a stranger
[1:17] pulls out
[1:19] beside them and
[1:21] and
[1:22] we notice there's several places in the
[1:24] scriptures that they they looked and
[1:27] they didn't know him
[1:30] when he stood on the bank when when they
[1:33] were there they looked and they they
[1:35] didn't know him
[1:36] they didn't know who he was
[1:38] and now here's again
[1:40] uh this is a place that they didn't know
[1:43] so we know that there had to be
[1:45] something that he did
[1:47] that opened their eyes
[1:49] and so uh so now we're gonna build on
[1:52] that a little bit and he says and he and
[1:55] he said and then he opened 45th verse
[1:58] then he opened their understanding
[2:00] that they might understand the
[2:02] scriptures
[2:03] and said unto them
[2:05] thus it is written and thus it behooves
[2:09] christ to suffer and to rise from the
[2:13] dead the third day
[2:15] and that repentance and remission of
[2:18] sins should be preached
[2:21] in his name
[2:22] among all nations beginning at jerusalem
[2:26] and ye are witnesses of these things
[2:30] and behold i send
[2:32] the promise of my father
[2:35] unto you
[2:36] but carry ye in the city of jerusalem
[2:40] until ye are endued with power from on
[2:43] high
[2:45] and he led them
[2:47] out
[2:48] as far as bethany and he lifted up his
[2:52] hands and blessed them and it came to
[2:55] pass while he blessed them
[2:57] he
[2:58] he was
[2:59] parted from them and carried into heaven
[3:04] and they worshiped him and returned to
[3:06] jerusalem with great joy and were
[3:08] continually in the temple praising and
[3:12] blessing god
[3:14] amen
[3:15] amen god bless you may see that seated
[3:19] and
[3:20] so
[3:20] if if i had a little
[3:23] title
[3:25] uh just for us to have a
[3:27] a a good time
[3:30] in the lord i i would like to uh
[3:34] uh title this um
[3:37] this
[3:38] the
[3:39] the other part of easter
[3:43] and so i and i say it from this
[3:46] standpoint
[3:47] from the aspect that easter had to have
[3:50] two parts
[3:53] uh
[3:54] it uh
[3:57] so there had to be something that
[4:01] went with it
[4:02] and so jesus in this
[4:05] part of scripture
[4:07] he points out the two parts
[4:10] that were
[4:12] there that were necessary for easter
[4:16] really to be completed
[4:18] and so we noticed one
[4:21] that there in the
[4:24] uh the 46th verse
[4:28] and he said unto them
[4:30] thus it is written
[4:32] and thus it behoove christ to suffer
[4:35] and derise from the dead the third day
[4:39] so the first part of easter was the
[4:42] event itself
[4:45] so the event had to take place it
[4:48] couldn't be
[4:49] something that was prophesied about
[4:52] in the
[4:53] prophecies and in the scriptures it
[4:56] couldn't be something that was written
[4:59] that
[5:00] people could look
[5:01] and still be looking for to come to pass
[5:06] and that's what we have we have the jews
[5:08] today are still looking for
[5:11] the word of god to come to pass they
[5:14] they haven't recognized that it's come
[5:17] to pass
[5:19] therefore they're still looking
[5:22] and their whole their whole approach is
[5:26] speaking about something may that may
[5:29] happen in the future
[5:32] but
[5:33] so the event had to take place that was
[5:36] the first part of the event of easter
[5:40] now the second
[5:41] part of it is that
[5:44] he said to them ye are my witnesses
[5:48] so in other words the event wouldn't be
[5:50] any good
[5:51] it wouldn't have
[5:53] accomplished anything it would have not
[5:56] been beneficial in any way
[5:58] if that was the end of it
[6:04] he rose from the dead
[6:06] nobody knew
[6:10] you know what i mean
[6:11] it that
[6:13] in this story we wouldn't be here today
[6:16] if part two
[6:19] didn't take place
[6:21] you know they have uh
[6:23] they have these uh epoxies
[6:27] uh you know you've seen them in paints
[6:29] and different things they have part a
[6:31] and part b
[6:34] and without
[6:36] part a doesn't work if it stands alone
[6:39] and part b doesn't work if it stands
[6:42] alone
[6:43] they have to be mixed together
[6:47] to produce the results now i hope i can
[6:50] i just want it to be simple but i want
[6:52] you to to to realize that
[6:55] that
[6:56] the
[6:58] that easter
[6:59] and the resurrection couldn't stand
[7:02] alone
[7:03] by itself it had to be witnessed
[7:08] no the part b or or the other
[7:11] part of
[7:13] of the easter or of the event
[7:17] was that there had to be somebody to
[7:19] spread the news
[7:22] and we find out that's why in the
[7:24] scripture that jesus commissions them
[7:28] to go into all the world
[7:31] and to spread
[7:33] the news
[7:34] that that because the the resurrection
[7:39] and easter as
[7:41] unbelievable as the event was
[7:45] if nobody ever heard about it
[7:49] if it was never shared
[7:52] it was never
[7:54] brought out
[7:56] if if
[7:57] it would it just remained
[8:00] uh
[8:01] an event that had transpired
[8:05] yet we have this saying
[8:07] if if a tree
[8:09] uh falls alone in the woods
[8:12] does anybody hear it
[8:16] but think about this
[8:18] he broke this down into two parts
[8:23] that he was going to
[8:24] rise and then he was going to have
[8:27] witnesses
[8:28] and so we're talking about this he says
[8:31] now
[8:32] he says
[8:34] now he wasn't
[8:36] just going to send them out
[8:39] as
[8:40] witnesses
[8:42] to tell a story
[8:45] all right so you come up to somebody and
[8:48] i come by you
[8:49] your
[8:50] your workplace one day and i say hey
[8:54] such and such
[8:56] rose from the dead
[9:00] well you would say well i don't even
[9:02] know who you're talking about
[9:04] and
[9:05] and second hand i don't even know
[9:07] whether that's true or not
[9:09] you understand he wasn't going to send
[9:11] them out
[9:12] with the fable
[9:14] he wasn't going to send them out with a
[9:17] a story
[9:18] he wasn't going to go ask them to
[9:23] share something
[9:25] that was so incredible
[9:28] that nobody would believe it
[9:31] we saw in this morning's message that
[9:34] the boy that received this site from
[9:36] youth they wouldn't believe that
[9:40] they had no record of it they had no
[9:43] proof of it
[9:44] and there the only proof they had them
[9:46] was the witness
[9:49] the person that actually
[9:52] the
[9:53] the the healing
[9:55] power of the lord jesus touched
[9:58] he was the only one that could be the
[10:00] true witness
[10:03] in other words they could have looked at
[10:05] the parents and said boy he been faking
[10:07] you out
[10:10] you just thought he was blind
[10:14] he just acted like he was blind
[10:16] they could they could have said anything
[10:18] else they wanted but the the person that
[10:21] had received the miracle
[10:26] was the one that was testifying to the
[10:29] miracle
[10:31] therefore
[10:32] that miracle now
[10:34] no longer was just a story but that
[10:38] miracle was living in flesh
[10:44] so there was the very recipient
[10:48] of
[10:49] the miracle
[10:51] standing there
[10:53] so we see that jesus wasn't going to ask
[10:57] them
[10:59] to fulfill part two
[11:02] in any other way
[11:06] but a supernatural way
[11:09] because if the event
[11:11] was supernatural
[11:14] you understanding then there had to be a
[11:17] supernatural element
[11:21] of the witnessing of it
[11:24] else
[11:24] you're just talking about
[11:27] somebody that did something right
[11:30] right
[11:31] and that wasn't going to go very far
[11:35] that wasn't going to move
[11:37] people
[11:39] why they had already had in the
[11:41] scriptures
[11:44] several people that rosed up
[11:46] and claimed to be the messiah
[11:48] and carried this person away and that
[11:51] person away
[11:52] they're
[11:53] they're already it was
[11:56] all kinds of
[11:58] uh i i don't have a better word to call
[12:00] them than than
[12:02] cons you know
[12:04] just uh people who had
[12:06] went out and conned people we we did it
[12:09] every day at at uh
[12:12] welcome back everybody
[12:14] every day at uh the church here there's
[12:17] somebody that comes by
[12:20] and and they have they have such a sad
[12:23] sob story
[12:25] and and they're they're looking to
[12:28] uh
[12:28] get a few dollars from the church and
[12:31] and so they they have a hard
[12:34] a story you know and and they're
[12:36] counting on tugging on your heart but so
[12:39] many times it is ingenuine
[12:42] one person come on one time and wanted
[12:45] groceries all my babies are at home
[12:46] grocery i live right close by we uh
[12:50] said fine that's great write us a
[12:52] grocery list
[12:54] give us your address
[12:57] and we'll bring the groceries to you
[13:01] well now there's no evidence of it
[13:05] you understand they don't have anything
[13:07] to back up their story
[13:09] that wasn't it was just a story
[13:12] so it was a story without a story
[13:17] you know it was a story without part b
[13:21] part a was oh i'm hungry and everything
[13:24] part b is that there's something there
[13:28] that witnesses that their story was true
[13:32] and if that person was really hungry and
[13:35] really starving and really want food for
[13:37] their baby they would have wrote out
[13:39] that grocery list and they would have
[13:41] been happy
[13:43] that you brought it to them
[13:46] but if that wasn't their intention
[13:49] you understand if that wasn't their
[13:51] purpose
[13:52] if they had what we would call a scheme
[13:56] or something up their sleeves that they
[13:58] really wanted that money for
[14:01] something else
[14:02] after then the the part b isn't there
[14:07] and the story doesn't stand up
[14:10] so he wasn't going to send them out
[14:14] without part b
[14:17] without the other part of easter
[14:21] because what good would an easter have
[14:24] been
[14:25] if it was just
[14:27] for
[14:28] the one person that
[14:31] participated in the event
[14:35] our gospel would be look what happened
[14:38] to jesus
[14:41] and then all she would have as a moral
[14:43] code
[14:45] but he wasn't going to do that
[14:48] he wasn't going to spread this story
[14:50] he wasn't going to have this if i could
[14:53] use the expression stick
[14:57] right okay have this new stick
[15:01] have this news take hold
[15:03] have this news have an effect
[15:06] so he had to give it something
[15:10] that made it effectual
[15:13] he had to give it something to this news
[15:19] that would show in evidence
[15:24] that it was real
[15:27] now how how is he going to do this
[15:31] he wasn't he's got to get this what he
[15:34] had just done
[15:37] what he had just
[15:38] done he's standing there and look at
[15:42] what he had just
[15:43] done
[15:45] he had just paid the price
[15:47] for the sins of the world
[15:53] just think of that
[15:56] nobody saw that
[15:59] when he was there dying
[16:02] who perceived that that was the lamb of
[16:04] god
[16:05] that took away the sins of the world we
[16:08] already know what they perceived
[16:11] we thought this was he
[16:13] who was going to deliver
[16:16] us
[16:17] from the romans we thought this was he
[16:20] that was going to to to separate us from
[16:24] the bondage that we're in and restore
[16:27] the glory of israel
[16:31] they didn't know they were in an exodus
[16:36] that's what they thought
[16:40] so
[16:41] how was
[16:42] he going to
[16:47] spread this great news
[16:50] what he had just done
[16:52] he had just forgiven
[16:55] the sins of man
[16:58] he had just broken
[17:01] the curse of death
[17:04] he had just
[17:06] demonstrated
[17:08] the power
[17:11] of the gospel
[17:14] and the power of the resurrection
[17:17] the power of the spirit
[17:20] that was in him
[17:23] that's what he said no man taketh my
[17:26] life
[17:27] i have power to lay it down and i have
[17:30] power to take it up again
[17:36] the event
[17:38] couldn't stand on its own
[17:42] the event had to have a witness
[17:48] it had to be testified to
[17:50] and and we could go into many bible
[17:53] teachings about
[17:55] about what a testament is and and how in
[17:58] the old testament there had to be a
[18:01] testament there had to be somebody that
[18:02] testified that the event had taken place
[18:06] testified that that this was their
[18:08] property and and so in fact in the
[18:11] scriptures we even know where the man
[18:13] went and buried things that they could
[18:15] be dug up as a testament
[18:18] so he understood that the event that he
[18:22] had just accomplished the
[18:24] the tremendous things that he had done
[18:27] that they had to have somebody that
[18:30] could testify to it
[18:35] now they saw it with their own eyes
[18:39] so they could
[18:40] believe but his gospel
[18:44] wasn't just for them
[18:49] there's a bunch of gentiles over here
[18:53] that got to get this gospel
[18:56] there's a bunch of sinners
[18:59] so now he's he understands i'm speaking
[19:03] maybe on a narrative
[19:05] from
[19:06] the lord jesus's perspective
[19:10] that he looks out he knows what he's
[19:12] done and now he's got to have these
[19:15] people
[19:17] go
[19:18] testify of it and spread the news
[19:25] now what
[19:27] has to happen
[19:29] that people will believe them
[19:34] in other words nobody's going to believe
[19:36] this story
[19:38] he already knows unbelief is great
[19:42] he already knows that it's going to be
[19:44] all that the father had given him
[19:48] so he knows that he has got to
[19:51] have something that something has got to
[19:53] take place
[19:55] to give the
[19:56] testifiers
[19:59] validity
[20:04] you know that they too
[20:08] have some
[20:09] valid
[20:11] evidence
[20:13] that the event took place
[20:16] because you couldn't go into a courtroom
[20:19] and say i heard
[20:23] so what's he do
[20:26] i like this
[20:28] he says before you can go out
[20:31] and be my
[20:32] witnesses i want you to go back to
[20:35] jerusalem
[20:38] and i want you to tarry
[20:42] because i have a promise
[20:45] of the father i want you to go back and
[20:48] tell you are endued with power from
[20:52] unknown
[20:54] because
[20:55] in other words you go back and you wait
[20:58] for part b
[21:00] and when you get the same spirit
[21:04] that raised me up from the dead i'm
[21:07] going to impart it in you in different
[21:10] measures
[21:12] for different purposes for different
[21:16] places that i'm going to send you
[21:19] i'm going to equip each of you
[21:23] individually
[21:26] with a portion of this resurrection
[21:29] power
[21:30] that you may perform the works that i
[21:35] have for ordained that you should walk
[21:38] in
[21:41] and that's one of the
[21:43] uh things that people miss
[21:46] is that part b is individual
[21:51] and it's personal
[21:53] and it's formulated
[21:56] excuse those expressions just for you
[22:02] we sometimes preach it
[22:04] like it's a one blanket policy
[22:09] fits all
[22:11] why they don't even make hamburgers that
[22:13] way
[22:15] anymore
[22:17] right
[22:18] everything's got to be personalized
[22:22] just the way you wanted i think it was
[22:24] whataburger had
[22:26] 5700 different ways they could make your
[22:29] hamburger
[22:33] so god make personalizes it
[22:36] you understand he's going to give you
[22:41] part b
[22:44] just for you
[22:47] and your personality he's going to
[22:50] tailor make it
[22:52] so it fits you
[22:54] for the work
[22:56] that he has for you to do
[23:01] so you might say well i'm real shy and i
[23:04] can't get
[23:05] in front of people and
[23:08] and i can't testify and you put all our
[23:11] excuses
[23:14] up on the table
[23:16] and he says okay i see all those things
[23:18] i'll tell you what i'm going to do
[23:21] i'm going to give you something
[23:23] that works
[23:27] for you and because i can give it to you
[23:30] and that it'll work for you i can make
[23:33] you a witness
[23:35] and so what does he tell him to do he
[23:38] says
[23:38] he says
[23:41] he says now it behooved me that this
[23:43] event take place
[23:46] and the reason this took the event took
[23:48] place because the event had to take
[23:50] place before you could be witnesses of
[23:53] it
[23:54] the benefits had to be displayed
[23:58] in other words i had to prove
[24:01] personally to you that the product works
[24:09] you know how many people they always
[24:11] hear the same i mean you won't take a
[24:13] medicine a doctor wouldn't take
[24:17] how'd you like to be in the office and
[24:19] the doctor comes up and says now here i
[24:21] want to give you this shot he said no i
[24:23] personally wouldn't take this shot
[24:24] myself
[24:30] you know what i mean
[24:31] because you know i'm not so sure of the
[24:33] side effects
[24:36] you know
[24:37] well you're not gonna take
[24:40] something
[24:42] right that the doctor wouldn't take
[24:46] but when the doctor tells you you know i
[24:48] i in fact i was sick one time and i had
[24:52] to get well and the doctor says i'm
[24:53] telling you i'm gonna give you something
[24:56] that i don't prescribe
[24:59] to any other patients
[25:02] he says but this is what i take myself
[25:09] buddy i said bring it on
[25:13] that's what i want
[25:15] to make me better
[25:17] i want what you got well now when i go
[25:19] to the doctor i don't even wait for them
[25:22] i say what do you take
[25:25] [Music]
[25:27] i want the drugs you use
[25:30] don't give me nothing that you won't use
[25:32] i don't want no second-hand experience i
[25:34] want someone to give me something that
[25:36] they've experienced themselves
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:44] so
[25:45] he already showed he took the medicine
[25:47] that's right that's right
[25:49] he already went to death
[25:53] he didn't have to
[25:55] they didn't have one thing
[25:59] that they could mark them with
[26:02] who of you can convict me of sin
[26:04] there wasn't one thing labeled anywhere
[26:07] one thing that that they could testify
[26:10] even brought in liars
[26:14] to testify
[26:16] to
[26:19] but he had to go prove
[26:23] that what he had
[26:26] could raise him from the dead
[26:30] he had confidence
[26:32] in what the word said he was
[26:36] he said for this cause i have come
[26:39] into the world
[26:41] that i might lay down my life
[26:44] for my own
[26:45] and that if i lay down my life for my
[26:48] own
[26:49] they will not have to taste death
[26:51] because i tasted death for them
[26:55] so what does he do so we understand he
[26:58] proved the event was true
[27:00] he proved that what he had
[27:04] was valid
[27:06] but in order to spread this news
[27:11] and that's what we're talking about
[27:12] because
[27:14] easter
[27:15] without the spreading of the news
[27:19] is
[27:19] uneffectual
[27:22] it only remains
[27:24] for one man
[27:27] but his resurrection wasn't for him
[27:31] it was for us
[27:33] he didn't even have to die
[27:36] but he laid
[27:38] down his life
[27:40] so now what's he going to do he's going
[27:42] to say
[27:44] he says
[27:45] that
[27:46] repentance
[27:48] and remission of sins
[27:51] this is the 47th birth should be
[27:54] preached
[27:55] in his name
[27:57] among all nations
[28:01] so i went to the grave
[28:04] and i rose again
[28:06] so that repentance
[28:09] and remission of sins
[28:12] could be preached
[28:13] to all nations
[28:16] now
[28:18] can you how is that going to work
[28:22] i'm just going to walk up to you and say
[28:23] guess what
[28:25] you need to repent
[28:29] gotta look at you
[28:32] for what
[28:35] why
[28:37] i like what i'm doing
[28:40] and who are you in the first place
[28:43] to tell me to repent
[28:45] i know you
[28:49] so there
[28:51] he he was going to have to give these
[28:54] witnesses
[28:57] something to witness
[29:00] with
[29:02] that's the trouble too many today's
[29:05] witness something that they don't even
[29:07] know what they're talking about brother
[29:09] branham talked about those choir members
[29:11] she sang and squeaked something you know
[29:13] what i mean he said it was the most
[29:15] horrible awful sound he ever heard
[29:17] because they were preaching and singing
[29:20] about something they knew nothing about
[29:24] there it is he wasn't going to do that
[29:26] to his own
[29:28] because the scripture said he loved his
[29:30] own till the end is that right
[29:33] and so what was he going to do he says
[29:35] now litmus he says begin of him and ye
[29:38] are witnesses of these things
[29:43] but he says
[29:44] do something first
[29:47] behold i send you the promise of my
[29:50] father upon you but terry in
[29:53] the city of in jerusalem until ye be
[29:57] endued with power
[30:00] from on high
[30:03] that's part b
[30:06] is power
[30:07] from on high
[30:09] he said go there because
[30:11] it's it's not just going to be a story
[30:16] right
[30:17] it's not going to be a guess what
[30:19] hey guess what
[30:21] remember that guy in jerusalem
[30:24] yeah he rose from the dead oh
[30:28] can i see him
[30:29] no he went up into the sky
[30:33] oh okay
[30:38] prophet if god said this in the tape we
[30:40] just listened to
[30:42] he said
[30:45] if you didn't have
[30:48] something to witness
[30:50] they would think that you were
[30:52] insane
[30:55] you're just telling a story
[30:59] it's like any other story
[31:02] but he says no this is not going to be
[31:05] it's not going to be something that uh
[31:09] it is just a story i'm not going to send
[31:12] you out there just to get to give a
[31:15] testimony i am going to give you
[31:21] the same power that raised me up
[31:25] i'm going to put it in you in measure
[31:28] custom like i said to you personally
[31:31] that you too can testify
[31:35] that you too have an experience that
[31:38] you're not talking about it second hand
[31:41] you're talking about it because you've
[31:43] got the same spirit that i got
[31:48] go there and wait
[31:51] until you got it
[31:56] because i am not going to send you out
[31:59] there alone
[32:02] i will be with you
[32:04] even in you
[32:06] till the end
[32:11] i will make you witnesses
[32:14] i will make you witness this
[32:17] resurrection
[32:19] not because you saw it
[32:22] but because you
[32:24] too
[32:25] experienced
[32:27] the power
[32:30] i think so many times
[32:33] that we we fail to understand
[32:36] when we witness the gospel
[32:39] that we're not witnessing it from the
[32:42] intellectual standpoint
[32:45] we're not
[32:46] trying to get to man's minds
[32:50] we're trying to get to man's souls
[32:54] we're trying to get to their spirit
[32:58] as we read in
[33:00] in
[33:01] timothy
[33:04] this morning
[33:05] he said every person that's going to go
[33:08] forth
[33:09] and witness my gospel they're going to
[33:12] have a characteristic
[33:15] did you catch it on the tape this
[33:16] morning he says you feel that right now
[33:19] don't you
[33:21] that's him
[33:25] is that right
[33:26] that was him
[33:28] he said
[33:30] that
[33:30] that was
[33:32] uh uh you feel this present
[33:34] it's a real
[33:36] sweet and a real meek
[33:40] and a real humble spirit
[33:45] why could he be that way
[33:47] because he had the goods
[33:50] to back up what you're saying
[33:54] he had the love
[33:58] to back up
[34:00] to be present
[34:02] and and so we find out he he makes this
[34:05] statement
[34:07] he says
[34:08] in meekness instructing those that
[34:11] oppose themselves
[34:12] if god preventure would give them
[34:15] repentance
[34:17] to acknowledge the truth and that they
[34:21] may recover themselves out of the snare
[34:23] of the devil
[34:25] who are taken captive by him at his will
[34:29] so now the devil's going around
[34:31] captivating people right
[34:34] is that true
[34:35] it's what he does
[34:37] he's a roaring lion
[34:40] speaking about who he may devour
[34:43] when jesus came
[34:45] who did he go to
[34:47] he didn't go to the religious people
[34:50] he went to those who were in bondage who
[34:52] were broken-hearted to bind up the
[34:55] brokenhearted to to deliver them from
[34:58] devils he went to people whom the enemy
[35:03] held captive
[35:06] that's who he was interested in
[35:09] he was interested in those that had need
[35:12] of a physician
[35:15] that's his spirit
[35:17] because his own
[35:20] were captivated
[35:22] his own
[35:24] were in bondage
[35:29] and so he
[35:30] sends them there to terry
[35:34] because now he's going to give them
[35:41] the
[35:43] portion
[35:44] of the event themselves
[35:47] he is now going to impart to them
[35:51] the resurrection power
[35:54] so they have something
[35:56] that they could
[35:59] testify to
[36:01] now why would anybody want to hear it
[36:05] everything why did why would anybody
[36:07] want to hear
[36:10] the gospel
[36:12] in other words here comes peter
[36:15] out of the upper room
[36:17] he's just been
[36:19] endued with
[36:21] power from on high
[36:24] and these people are are they they think
[36:27] they're drunk
[36:29] because they're speaking in languages
[36:33] that they don't understand
[36:37] but yet there's those there that are
[36:39] understanding them
[36:41] and of course that critic
[36:43] rises to the surface don't ever think
[36:46] you're ever going to do anything for god
[36:48] without meeting mr critic
[36:52] without meeting mr doubt
[36:56] without meeting the old guy who's ready
[36:58] to argue
[37:01] with you
[37:03] you know though you meet them all the
[37:05] time they're going to pull out their
[37:07] bible and they're going to go through
[37:09] their intellectual
[37:11] thing and all you can do look look at
[37:13] them and say sorry buddy you're missing
[37:15] part b
[37:17] [Applause]
[37:19] you don't have anything
[37:22] that makes this stick
[37:25] you don't have anything to prove
[37:28] what you're talking about the very
[37:31] spirit in which you're bringing it in is
[37:35] the very evidence that you don't possess
[37:37] what you're talking about
[37:43] so this spirit
[37:46] on the day of pentecost
[37:50] peter comes out
[37:54] and they're
[37:55] they're they're saying
[37:57] and we're talking about
[38:00] uh if i could say this the other part of
[38:02] easter the other part of easter
[38:06] is god
[38:08] equipping
[38:10] his witnesses
[38:14] that's the other part of easter
[38:17] is him
[38:18] giving them
[38:21] something to witness with
[38:26] go into all the world and preach the
[38:28] gospel right
[38:30] and these signs
[38:32] shall follow them
[38:35] go into all the world and tell them
[38:38] that the resurrection has come
[38:41] and the captain have been set free
[38:44] and and
[38:45] these things will happen
[38:47] you will lay your hands on the sick and
[38:49] they recover you shall lay your hands on
[38:52] the blind and they shall receive their
[38:54] sight you shall cast out demons because
[38:57] when he sent the news out and when he
[39:01] accomplished the event he empowered the
[39:05] witnesses to witness the right thing
[39:12] that's why we played the tape this
[39:13] morning because
[39:15] that was the witness
[39:19] and the proof of the resurrection
[39:23] it wasn't an easter bunny
[39:27] it wasn't a church organization
[39:30] god never chose man to lead his church
[39:34] he chose his holy spirit to lead the
[39:37] church
[39:39] he chose men
[39:41] and women that were endued with power
[39:45] from on high
[39:46] that that power would lead their actions
[39:50] and their decisions that their light
[39:53] could so shine and by their works they
[39:56] would glorify the father in heaven
[40:01] see man didn't make up part b
[40:06] that's the trouble man has chose creeds
[40:08] and dogmas and organizations to witness
[40:12] they've replaced witnessing with
[40:14] programs
[40:16] instead of individual experience
[40:21] they elected a group of men
[40:26] nickelodeons
[40:28] high priest
[40:29] and educated
[40:31] and
[40:32] tuned with doctrines
[40:35] to be those who spread the gospel
[40:39] and they pay them to do it
[40:42] and that's not
[40:44] the other part
[40:47] without
[40:49] part b
[40:50] you can never testify
[40:53] to part a
[40:57] and without
[40:59] receiving it yourself
[41:03] until you knew what you were talking
[41:05] about
[41:07] everybody could see through your story
[41:11] what did it do for you oh nothing i
[41:13] still drink and smoke but i'll tell you
[41:15] something that's really true
[41:19] i still hate half the people on my block
[41:23] i still dry i still try to drive
[41:25] everybody off the road that cuts in
[41:27] front of me oh yeah
[41:30] oh i can see what you've got i want that
[41:34] no
[41:36] there was a whole nother part
[41:38] of easter
[41:41] there's a whole other plan to make
[41:44] easter
[41:46] become beneficial
[41:51] so it had to go beyond something that
[41:53] was more than a story there had to be
[41:58] there there had to be something that
[42:00] showed
[42:01] there was a power
[42:03] that could raise a man from the dead
[42:08] how are they going to believe
[42:10] that a man rose from the dead
[42:13] and that he forgave their sins if they
[42:16] didn't have a power
[42:18] that they could show
[42:21] that
[42:22] proved
[42:23] that this power was able to raise
[42:27] somebody from the dead
[42:30] you couldn't get by with that in the
[42:32] sales world
[42:36] i don't know but i know the first thing
[42:39] like a kirby vacuum cleaner salesman
[42:41] used to do he would go in and take one
[42:43] of your rugs and he'd suck off 10 pounds
[42:46] of dirt out of it
[42:48] and then he'd empty his bag i'd never
[42:50] seen him empty his bag before he went
[42:52] over your carpet but
[42:54] i don't know
[42:58] but they want to prove to you
[43:01] that
[43:03] their product does what it says you know
[43:06] that's why most people don't witness the
[43:08] resurrection they don't witness the lord
[43:11] because they don't possess nothing
[43:16] they've got the story
[43:18] they've got the event
[43:21] and i'm leading up to a quick close here
[43:24] is but they don't have
[43:28] part b
[43:31] they've got part a memorized
[43:34] it's like somebody that goes to mechanic
[43:36] school has never worked on a car
[43:40] they got no experience
[43:43] and he didn't want him to go out there
[43:44] without experience
[43:46] he didn't want him to be testifying
[43:48] about something they didn't have
[43:51] so he's going to do something on their
[43:53] behalf
[43:55] you understand so he's not going to send
[43:57] them out alone
[43:59] to testify
[44:01] i'm going to be with you amen
[44:04] even in you
[44:07] i'm gonna be there
[44:09] and i'm gonna work and so we find on the
[44:11] day of pentecost
[44:12] peter comes out
[44:14] and he says men and brethren these are
[44:16] not drunk if you suppose this is what
[44:18] was prophesied by joel
[44:21] this is a fulfillment of the word
[44:26] they didn't testify
[44:27] about the experience on itself
[44:32] they testified about the experience
[44:35] in the word
[44:37] because the holy spirit doesn't come to
[44:40] testify of itself it comes to testify of
[44:42] him
[44:45] amen
[44:47] they had to it had to bear record
[44:50] to the word the spell give you the
[44:52] spirit but he will bring you in
[44:54] remembrance of all things that i have
[44:56] said amen
[45:00] because faith has to have the anchor
[45:02] place right
[45:05] and the anchor places the word of god
[45:08] so many people try to anchor in a
[45:10] sensation
[45:14] and yet they have that very spirit in
[45:16] them but if they could bring that spirit
[45:18] back to the word the word would bear
[45:21] witness and they would understand what
[45:23] it is they're testifying to
[45:27] so i want to just point out to you just
[45:29] real quick
[45:32] that
[45:34] how he equipped them
[45:36] so they come out on the day of pentecost
[45:40] they say they're not
[45:42] they're not drunk
[45:44] and they go preaching the gospel right
[45:47] the same jesus that you crucified you
[45:50] know god made them both lord and lord he
[45:52] said unto david sit ye here at my right
[45:54] hand what are they doing
[45:57] they're preaching the
[45:58] gospel they're preaching the scriptures
[46:02] they're preaching what had taken place
[46:07] i hope you can tie this these two
[46:09] together
[46:11] with today
[46:13] they're preaching the fulfillment
[46:16] of scripture
[46:18] for their day
[46:22] that's what they're doing
[46:24] because that's what they're commissioned
[46:25] to do
[46:27] he's not out there preaching build an
[46:29] ark
[46:30] he's not out there preaching noah built
[46:33] an ark and and moses did this
[46:37] they're preaching the present day
[46:40] witness
[46:42] of the power and the work that god done
[46:46] in that day
[46:49] and now so they're out there testifying
[46:51] and they're preaching but something
[46:54] takes place
[46:58] their hearts
[47:01] are pricked
[47:06] they're doing
[47:07] what they're commissioned to do
[47:10] go tell
[47:14] right
[47:15] go preach it
[47:17] go share it
[47:20] i'll be with you
[47:24] i've empowered you
[47:26] i've commissioned you
[47:28] so the first thing that happens is is
[47:30] god pricks their heart
[47:34] these people fell under conviction
[47:38] know what it means to have your heart
[47:40] pricked
[47:42] they identified
[47:44] themselves
[47:46] with
[47:47] what they had just
[47:50] done the great lord
[47:55] how many of them actually might have
[47:57] been there
[47:59] and cried crucify him
[48:02] you know we all
[48:03] through our sins
[48:05] cried crucify him
[48:09] because when he went there he went there
[48:11] with your sins
[48:13] you say well i didn't even commit him
[48:15] yet yeah he knew you were going to
[48:17] commit him
[48:19] that's why he took the sins of the world
[48:22] on himself you know that's how just god
[48:25] he is he isn't just just god to say oh i
[48:28] just picked these few he took
[48:29] everybody's sins on
[48:31] anybody could
[48:33] uh had repentance
[48:36] but they just didn't accept it
[48:40] so their hearts were pricked
[48:44] just think of that
[48:46] what a beautiful thing it is to have
[48:48] your heart print
[48:50] the gospel of our prophet went out
[48:53] how many people sat there never
[48:55] recognized who he was never recognized
[48:58] what was transpiring never recognized
[49:02] what he was witnessing
[49:04] that jesus christ was the same yesterday
[49:07] and forever
[49:08] that that there was a ministry of
[49:10] malachi 4 5 that was supposed to come
[49:13] before the end time and that were in the
[49:15] end time you understand when they went
[49:18] out
[49:19] they only gave the hope
[49:23] that people would be raised from the
[49:25] dead again
[49:28] but you understand what you're
[49:30] testifying to
[49:32] you're actually testifying that you're
[49:34] living in the time where you could
[49:36] actually be part of a rapture
[49:43] not the hope that one day your body
[49:46] would come out but actually now you're
[49:48] testifying and saying you know what this
[49:51] world is getting wicked the the the
[49:54] wickedness of the animal rights is
[49:56] fulfilled all the prophecies concerning
[49:59] the end time are coming to pass there's
[50:01] a rapture at hand
[50:06] why should i believe you
[50:10] why should i believe your
[50:12] interpretation of the gospel
[50:15] because he promised
[50:18] to give part b
[50:21] he can't give part b
[50:24] unless they're testifying
[50:27] and witnessing parday
[50:34] if they're not witnessing the
[50:36] resurrection and the life that catholic
[50:38] priest down there who's taking that
[50:41] little round thing up and going
[50:47] he's not witnessing
[50:50] part a that's right therefore he doesn't
[50:53] have part b
[50:55] he the part b is the power
[50:58] that was imparted
[51:00] in the upper room
[51:02] not for the purpose of demonstration but
[51:05] for the purpose of proving that part a
[51:10] the event actually happened
[51:14] and that's what we were talking about
[51:16] this morning brother branham standing
[51:18] there what's he keep pointing to the
[51:20] event happened this is the proof of the
[51:23] resurrection
[51:27] an easter bunny story ain't no proof
[51:31] you think he's going to send them out
[51:34] to share the resurrection without giving
[51:38] them the proof
[51:40] of the resurrection
[51:45] no
[51:48] to every believer
[51:51] he's going to impart to them
[51:55] a portion of it
[51:58] he's going to give them
[52:01] a portion of what he had so they could
[52:05] use it
[52:07] to witness
[52:09] we've got backwards
[52:12] we think he gave it to us
[52:14] as something we as a bomb we could put
[52:17] in our medicine cabinet and every time
[52:20] we're spiritually weak or we sin or
[52:22] reduce something bad we can just go grab
[52:25] a little bit of this powder and put it
[52:27] on us you know
[52:29] no
[52:31] it was to transform us
[52:37] we talked about so god's working on
[52:39] their behalf
[52:42] they're talking about something they're
[52:43] witnessing
[52:45] they're saying god's come and forgiving
[52:46] your sins
[52:49] he's brought to us life
[52:52] that the grave has no victory over us
[52:56] and that's pricking people's hearts
[53:00] so now they're preaching this word
[53:02] so how what do they have so peter goes
[53:05] up to the gate called beautiful right
[53:08] and here's this guy sitting there now
[53:10] we're talking about god had given these
[53:12] men part b
[53:14] to prove that part a exists
[53:18] that the event was true that jesus did
[53:21] raise from the dead
[53:25] and so he goes there and he
[53:29] says silver and gold
[53:32] have i none
[53:36] but i'm going to share with you
[53:40] something i have
[53:44] i was in a room
[53:46] and jesus told me
[53:49] he would send a power in my life
[53:52] that would allow
[53:54] me to witness
[53:59] what has been accomplished
[54:02] in this day
[54:04] i don't have silver
[54:06] i don't
[54:07] have cold
[54:10] he says but in the name
[54:13] of the lord jesus
[54:15] rise up and walk
[54:18] now i want you to notice something go
[54:20] when you go back and read that story
[54:23] they question them
[54:25] and jesus responds why do you look upon
[54:28] us
[54:30] as that we've done this
[54:33] by our own power
[54:37] we didn't do this by our own power
[54:40] we did this because
[54:43] the savior
[54:45] the messiah
[54:47] the one that fulfilled the scriptures he
[54:49] gave us this power he gave us this
[54:53] spirit he gave us this thing
[54:57] by which we did this we didn't do this
[55:01] by ourselves
[55:03] in other words god wasn't going to
[55:05] spread this gospel by word only
[55:08] he wasn't going to do it by word only he
[55:10] was going to do it by power and
[55:13] demonstration because if he was going to
[55:16] witness to a power
[55:18] a power that was so great it could raise
[55:21] somebody from the dead the only thing
[55:24] that could witness to that power was the
[55:27] power itself
[55:36] you know it's like a it would be like a
[55:38] uh
[55:40] a hot air balloon
[55:44] testifying to the sound barrier
[55:50] the only person that could testify to
[55:52] that
[55:55] was a person that did it
[56:00] and i noticed
[56:01] when brother bram said a lot of you grew
[56:03] up and never heard a sonic boom
[56:06] because they finally outlawed them
[56:08] over any residential areas
[56:12] but i've i've heard them
[56:15] boom boom boom it was fabulous
[56:18] i loved it
[56:20] i'd look up for the plane but we always
[56:22] learned that you didn't look where the
[56:24] boom took place
[56:26] you looked about five miles past
[56:28] it because it follows
[56:33] and when you break the spiritual sound
[56:36] barrier
[56:37] the psalmic boom is following you
[56:40] you're not trying to produce the sonic
[56:43] boom you have the resurrection you have
[56:46] the life you're you're testifying to it
[56:49] you're witnessing to it you're telling
[56:51] people that's why he never said go out
[56:54] and produce these signs he says you be a
[56:57] witness and these signs will follow you
[57:04] the church has got way too much in to
[57:07] manufacturing
[57:09] we have a meeting let's manufacture
[57:11] these songs
[57:13] preach the gospel
[57:16] let the holy spirit
[57:18] prick their heart
[57:21] let them go beyond the camp
[57:24] and ask
[57:25] for that experience resurrection to come
[57:29] into their life personally
[57:31] and then go tell the world
[57:35] tell them how your candle got lit
[57:39] tell him all the things that you've read
[57:42] he'll be there
[57:44] he'll stand behind you
[57:46] he'll bear record
[57:48] he'll bear witness
[57:52] don't be afraid to say you know he said
[57:55] that we could lay our hands on the sick
[57:56] and they'd recover
[57:58] i'm not talking about in the church
[58:00] service
[58:01] i'm talking across the lunch table
[58:06] i'm talking at the gas pump
[58:10] i'm talking about you're testifying to
[58:12] something that you possess
[58:15] so he put it on display
[58:18] and and you know
[58:20] and we'll close now because i think you
[58:22] understand what my point is
[58:24] so there's another that was acts uh
[58:27] 4 and 13 where he said silver and gold
[58:30] have a nun but you go over to acts 25
[58:34] that's another great testimony
[58:38] because
[58:40] here's the disciples
[58:42] they had just done these great works
[58:46] and they told them don't go preach in
[58:48] this name anymore
[58:52] that's what the world tells us
[58:54] don't tell this jesus story no more
[58:57] don't tell this william branham story no
[59:00] more don't talk about these signs and
[59:02] wonders all you would have to do is take
[59:04] somebody and play for them
[59:07] the portion of tape that we played and
[59:10] they would actually have to have nothing
[59:12] in them to believe with not to see the
[59:15] things that were transpiring
[59:19] but we're not looking for them
[59:22] we're looking for those whom god would
[59:24] pre-adventure
[59:27] would prick in their hearts
[59:30] and bring them to repentance
[59:33] and the acknowledgement of the truth
[59:37] that they too could
[59:40] recover themselves
[59:42] from the captivity
[59:45] that they've been put under
[59:47] by satan
[59:48] that's what we're preaching
[59:51] that's the good news
[59:53] there's a power here
[59:55] that can deliver you from captivity that
[59:58] can deliver you from death that can give
[1:00:01] you eternal life and that's what i'm
[1:00:03] testifying to and they have every right
[1:00:07] to look at you and say
[1:00:09] prove it
[1:00:13] and you have every right to stand there
[1:00:15] and say
[1:00:16] praise god
[1:00:20] i know what i'm talking about
[1:00:23] and you start telling him what he did
[1:00:25] for you and you start telling it and
[1:00:26] then pretty soon you know that you have
[1:00:28] it's well have you ever testified to
[1:00:30] somebody and all of a sudden you feel
[1:00:32] the anointing just welling up inside you
[1:00:34] words are coming out of your mouth you
[1:00:37] know why because you didn't take no
[1:00:38] thought what to say but the spirit is in
[1:00:41] you bearing record to the witness
[1:00:45] that what that we preach that jesus
[1:00:47] christ rose from the dead is true and
[1:00:50] he's alive and he's with me and even in
[1:00:54] me till the end because he does what he
[1:00:58] says
[1:01:02] so verse 25
[1:01:05] reads like this he said then all of a
[1:01:07] sudden somebody shows up
[1:01:09] to the scribes and pharisees and says
[1:01:11] the men whom ye put in prison
[1:01:15] are
[1:01:16] standing in the temple
[1:01:24] and teaching to the people
[1:01:29] what were these guys
[1:01:31] they were witnesses
[1:01:33] what did the prophet god said in the
[1:01:35] rising of the son
[1:01:37] he said they went from cowards
[1:01:40] to heroes
[1:01:42] he went from cowards
[1:01:44] to boldness
[1:01:45] because they were quickened
[1:01:49] they received part
[1:01:50] b part a by itself is no proof
[1:01:56] i i was visiting with orlando in the
[1:01:58] parking lot we talked and i says it
[1:02:00] wasn't that a wonderful easter message
[1:02:02] he said i am easter
[1:02:05] and i thought that's right
[1:02:07] because easter isn't complete without a
[1:02:09] witness
[1:02:11] easter wasn't good good if he couldn't
[1:02:14] transfer the power that rose him up to
[1:02:18] somebody else that they can bear witness
[1:02:20] of it if it just stayed in jesus it was
[1:02:23] a jesus thing this isn't a jesus thing
[1:02:27] it's a body thing his whole body is
[1:02:30] going to resurrect
[1:02:35] he bore witness and he gave witness
[1:02:38] and he shared the power
[1:02:40] that
[1:02:43] the that
[1:02:44] there would be
[1:02:46] a boldness to the believer what they
[1:02:48] testified of
[1:02:51] and just think of this now
[1:02:54] in their day
[1:02:59] they they were talking about life
[1:03:02] and eternal life
[1:03:06] and the hope of the resurrection
[1:03:09] and of the twinkling
[1:03:11] of in a twinkling of the eye
[1:03:14] their body would be changed
[1:03:16] but you know what you're witnessing to
[1:03:19] you're witnessing the hour
[1:03:21] of
[1:03:22] the change
[1:03:27] not just the imparting
[1:03:29] of the holy spirit
[1:03:32] i hope this doesn't
[1:03:34] but actually the imparting of the
[1:03:37] resurrection
[1:03:42] he is not just giving his power
[1:03:44] to witness
[1:03:47] but he's giving us the power
[1:03:51] to translate
[1:03:53] the power to change
[1:03:56] that's what was possessed in this
[1:03:58] message amen
[1:04:00] it wasn't only part a
[1:04:04] the witnessing of the promise
[1:04:07] but it was part b
[1:04:09] giving the life
[1:04:11] and the resurrection
[1:04:13] and the rapture
[1:04:15] to its pers
[1:04:17] participants
[1:04:22] this is something that is is so
[1:04:25] wonderful
[1:04:26] that what we're testifying to
[1:04:29] we're testifying now that through this
[1:04:31] messenger and through this message and
[1:04:34] through this opening of the seals and
[1:04:36] this quickening power that opens the
[1:04:39] seals that there's now something that
[1:04:41] god's imparting to his bride that they
[1:04:45] can testify to and prove by their own
[1:04:49] lives and their own works and their own
[1:04:52] approach to life that this event is at
[1:04:55] hand amen
[1:05:00] and you too can be a part of it
[1:05:04] and he will impart to you
[1:05:06] the quickening power
[1:05:08] because you're not selling it
[1:05:12] without demonstration
[1:05:15] you're not
[1:05:16] sharing it
[1:05:18] without proof
[1:05:20] because you possess it
[1:05:22] and i'd like to close
[1:05:25] with this i see some of our people have
[1:05:27] got back and
[1:05:29] it says
[1:05:35] he said if i can get
[1:05:38] myself out of the way
[1:05:40] so when william branham's not
[1:05:42] even thought of
[1:05:44] and you're not even thought of
[1:05:48] till we can see jesus glory amongst us
[1:05:51] see
[1:05:52] that's our desire
[1:05:54] that's the quickening
[1:05:56] give us the quickening power
[1:05:59] and it gives us joy
[1:06:03] to know
[1:06:04] that we are with him
[1:06:06] bone
[1:06:07] both flesh and bone of him
[1:06:11] being the bride of him
[1:06:14] and seeing his same vindicated methods
[1:06:19] proving in us
[1:06:21] that he is now
[1:06:23] risen
[1:06:24] from
[1:06:25] the dead
[1:06:26] so you see what i'm saying the same
[1:06:29] vindicating methods
[1:06:32] we saw the vindicating methods
[1:06:35] now that was done in a great group
[1:06:39] to prove to many beyond a shadow of a
[1:06:41] doubt that there was a messenger but you
[1:06:45] have those same
[1:06:48] those same i like how he says it those
[1:06:52] same vindicated methods working in you
[1:06:56] when you're one-on-one
[1:07:02] you can pray with the person
[1:07:04] that you're talking about
[1:07:06] and they can be set free
[1:07:09] you can lay your hands on the sick
[1:07:11] people
[1:07:12] and they could be made well
[1:07:15] this last thing he said wouldn't be a
[1:07:17] public show
[1:07:22] it would be heart to heart
[1:07:24] faith the faith
[1:07:26] person to person
[1:07:28] do you remember in the tape this morning
[1:07:30] he says nothing's hid for you now
[1:07:32] because me and you have connected
[1:07:35] in spirit
[1:07:36] realm
[1:07:42] you know if we could connect with people
[1:07:45] in the spirit realm connect with them
[1:07:47] feel their burden
[1:07:49] remember the prophet of god put his
[1:07:51] shoulder up because see if the guy's
[1:07:53] coat would fit he put his shoe up
[1:07:56] he said this is somebody's daddy
[1:07:58] somewhere this could be
[1:08:01] my daddy
[1:08:04] look at the empty
[1:08:07] look at the personal desire
[1:08:10] look at the love
[1:08:13] trying to show
[1:08:14] that what i've got
[1:08:17] and he didn't have nothing else to give
[1:08:18] him
[1:08:20] so he just
[1:08:21] prayed for him and his uh eyesight came
[1:08:23] back
[1:08:25] is that impossible for you
[1:08:27] no
[1:08:28] it won't be a public show
[1:08:31] because you don't need to give the world
[1:08:33] a message
[1:08:35] you need to deliver the message you're
[1:08:37] commissioned to give
[1:08:39] and like i said that spirit's
[1:08:41] tailor-made for your heart
[1:08:43] for your life
[1:08:45] for whom you come in contact with
[1:08:47] because your footsteps are ordered by
[1:08:49] the lord and you are foreordained to
[1:08:53] good works we're not trying to clone
[1:08:55] jesus we're not trying to clone brother
[1:08:58] branham we're trying to bring part b
[1:09:00] to the world to show that part a is
[1:09:03] there so the power of the resurrection
[1:09:06] and eternal life will stick
[1:09:09] and he goes on and he closes and so that
[1:09:12] same vindicated method
[1:09:14] proves in us that he is now risen from
[1:09:18] the dead that same vindicated method the
[1:09:21] same method he used for peter the same
[1:09:24] method he used for the disciples the
[1:09:27] same method he used for paul that same
[1:09:30] method is in you working in you so that
[1:09:35] you can prove
[1:09:37] that he's resurrected
[1:09:39] he says no wonder he said fear not
[1:09:43] for notice
[1:09:45] we are redeemed by him
[1:09:47] and now risen with him
[1:09:50] that's what easter means to people
[1:09:53] risen
[1:09:54] with
[1:09:55] him
[1:09:58] notice now we have his spirit in us
[1:10:02] the abstract deed fully paid
[1:10:06] no you don't say well i hope i make it
[1:10:10] you've already made it
[1:10:13] not i will make it i have already made
[1:10:18] it
[1:10:19] i
[1:10:20] i never
[1:10:22] made it he made it
[1:10:24] for me
[1:10:27] see not me him well brother branham say
[1:10:31] i don't care what they say
[1:10:35] there he made it for me
[1:10:37] that's all i want
[1:10:39] i'm caring about
[1:10:41] i just want to see him manifested
[1:10:45] how can you do it
[1:10:47] call him down
[1:10:54] no
[1:10:56] he is in you
[1:10:59] see
[1:11:01] he is in you
[1:11:03] well then lord if i can get myself out
[1:11:05] of the way
[1:11:07] you can manifest
[1:11:11] might tell how can you do it because
[1:11:14] you're ordained
[1:11:16] it's so
[1:11:17] all the father hath given me
[1:11:20] will come
[1:11:22] glory
[1:11:27] we've got way too much into trying to
[1:11:29] calm them down
[1:11:33] someone comes to be prayed for we call
[1:11:35] them down
[1:11:37] you witness to somebody you call them
[1:11:39] down
[1:11:40] don't you understand
[1:11:43] that's not how he
[1:11:44] the church was led
[1:11:46] he imparted to you
[1:11:49] the spirit
[1:11:51] that does the work
[1:11:54] you're a part of the resurrection
[1:11:57] you are the resurrection there will be
[1:11:59] no resurrection without you you are the
[1:12:02] rapture the rapture isn't for somebody
[1:12:05] else the rapture is for me and for you
[1:12:08] and that's what we're testifying to and
[1:12:11] he uses the same method he pricks the
[1:12:14] heart of the person you're talking to
[1:12:18] he allows you to demonstrate what that
[1:12:22] he did for you
[1:12:24] and then you can pray
[1:12:27] and perform
[1:12:29] the work
[1:12:30] that their heart
[1:12:33] is desiring
[1:12:37] so simple
[1:12:39] so beautiful
[1:12:40] but it's the life
[1:12:42] of the resurrection
[1:12:45] in the church
[1:12:47] you testify
[1:12:48] god will prick their heart
[1:12:53] you can prove to them by what that he
[1:12:55] did in you
[1:12:56] and then you can share
[1:12:59] that life
[1:13:01] do you know he said on that day in
[1:13:02] calvary that he give every believer the
[1:13:05] power to impart
[1:13:08] eternal life
[1:13:09] through god's word
[1:13:11] remember
[1:13:12] you're the other part
[1:13:15] of easter
[1:13:17] and our easter
[1:13:20] is the rapture
[1:13:22] and you are a part
[1:13:25] of the rapture
[1:13:26] so lord richly bless you i just thought
[1:13:29] that easter was such a wonderful day and
[1:13:32] just to think
[1:13:33] that he gave us the spark
[1:13:37] he is the spark
[1:13:39] he is i am the resurrection in the life
[1:13:43] no man comes unto the father but by me
[1:13:46] lord if that's true i need you come into
[1:13:49] me put the same power in me because if
[1:13:52] the same power that raised up christ

[1:14:31] the same vindicated methods
[1:14:35] we saw this morning as we played those
[1:14:37] vindicated message
[1:14:40] and father how the church
[1:14:42] and individuals
[1:14:45] have got away from having confidence
[1:14:50] in the quickening power
[1:14:53] having confidence in that what you did
[1:14:56] for them
[1:14:57] he will do for others
[1:15:00] lord having confidence that they can
[1:15:02] share this
[1:15:04] that you will stand behind them in their
[1:15:06] commission
[1:15:08] that they don't walk out alone
[1:15:11] but it's you
[1:15:13] they don't have to call you down
[1:15:15] because you're there
[1:15:17] in them

[1:15:35] the holder of the abstract he went
[1:15:38] through so many ways for this message to
[1:15:41] try to get us to understand that we are
[1:15:44] possessors of it
[1:15:46] not going to receive it we already have
[1:15:50] it
[1:15:50] and our commission is to share what we
[1:15:53] have
[1:15:55] if we don't have it to share

[1:16:01] personal private place

[1:31:48] amen we have
[1:31:50] three
[1:31:51] uh candidates for
[1:31:53] baptism you know and this is the part i
[1:31:56] like
[1:31:58] because
[1:31:59] when you go to a revival
[1:32:02] the spirit
[1:32:04] falls
[1:32:06] everywhere
[1:32:07] it falls on the just it falls on the
[1:32:10] unjust
[1:32:11] people are healed people are delivered
[1:32:15] but when you go to water baptism
[1:32:18] that's you personally
[1:32:20] going taking a portion of that
[1:32:24] pillar of fire and bringing it to
[1:32:26] yourself
[1:32:28] in your life
[1:32:31] amen this is
[1:32:32] this is an individual coming up said
[1:32:35] i've sat under the anointing
[1:32:37] my heart was pricked i saw the spirit
[1:32:41] deliver people
[1:32:42] and do all types of signs and wonders
[1:32:46] but now i'm here to possess
[1:32:49] a portion
[1:32:51] that lick of fire
[1:32:53] as we just got done preaching that
[1:32:55] belongs to me personally
[1:32:59] and as i said that holy spirit is
[1:33:03] that quickening power has been molded
[1:33:06] and created by god to fit you as an
[1:33:09] individual
[1:33:10] you say it's the same spirit odds the
[1:33:13] same fear but it manifests different in
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:17] because he's chosen you
[1:33:19] to manifest it's hope so
[1:33:22] matthew and i believe brother andrew are
[1:33:24] going to baptize
[1:33:25] our candidates and i believe we have
[1:33:28] feel free to take pictures if somebody
[1:33:30] has a camera make sure that you can
[1:33:32] share their baptism with them don't run
[1:33:35] out for your cameras we have them
[1:33:38] here but
[1:33:39] anyway
[1:33:44] we have a microphone
[1:33:51] all right
[1:33:52] hold the knife
[1:34:08] so
[1:34:10] she knows and i know right
[1:34:12] okay god bless you sir
[1:34:14] um i'm
[1:34:16] nervous but
[1:34:18] i'm not i'm always very nervous to talk
[1:34:21] in front of an audience like this
[1:34:24] but
[1:34:24] i don't know why but
[1:34:26] i'm not nervous at all
[1:34:29] and i get like really really nervous
[1:34:33] and i would have like these terrible
[1:34:35] thoughts in my mind
[1:34:39] and now i don't have them anymore
[1:34:46] and i'm just so excited
[1:34:54] praise god she wanted to be baptized
[1:34:56] after she heard the word and she saw the
[1:34:58] effect of the testimony inside of the
[1:35:00] van the lord moved on our heart to
[1:35:03] fulfill the word of god and be baptized
[1:35:05] in the name of the lord jesus christ so
[1:35:07] we're so thankful that you can have the
[1:35:08] opportunity to stand before you
[1:35:10] and and be identified with those in the
[1:35:14] name of jesus that not only
[1:35:17] are they identified in his death but in
[1:35:19] the resurrection
[1:35:20] praise god
[1:35:32] i just wanted to read the scripture here
[1:35:34] in mark
[1:35:36] chapter 16
[1:35:38] where jesus appears to the eleven and he
[1:35:40] says unto them he says go into all the
[1:35:42] world
[1:35:43] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:35:47] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:35:50] be saved
[1:35:52] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:35:53] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:35:57] that believe
[1:35:58] and we have a believer in the water
[1:36:01] amen these signs shall follow them
[1:36:04] that believe
[1:36:06] and so we're just so thankful to be able
[1:36:08] to fulfill the commission
[1:36:11] and it says in my name shall they cast
[1:36:13] out devils they shall speak with new
[1:36:15] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:36:17] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:36:19] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:36:21] the sick and they shall recover what a
[1:36:24] blessing it is as a body to be
[1:36:27] able to fulfill the great commission
[1:36:29] you know
[1:36:30] we all have a part in this every single
[1:36:32] one of us and we're just thankful so we
[1:36:34] just want to read the scripture now out
[1:36:35] of acts

[1:36:41] were pricked in their heart and said
[1:36:42] unto peter and to the rest of the
[1:36:44] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[1:36:46] do then peter said unto them repent and
[1:36:48] be baptized
[1:36:49] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:36:51] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:36:53] and ye shall receive the gift
