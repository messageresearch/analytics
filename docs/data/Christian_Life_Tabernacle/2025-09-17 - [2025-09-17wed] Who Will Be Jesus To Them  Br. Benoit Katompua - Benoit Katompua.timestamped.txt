[32:03] Amen. You may be seated just a moment.
[32:06] We have a couple of announcements to
[32:08] make and and uh uh and then uh uh we're
[32:13] going to have brother Ben to administer
[32:16] for us. Uh I just want to rem uh remind
[32:19] us all those that are listening also
[32:23] that uh about October 19th is going to
[32:27] be our young family day and that's for
[32:30] everybody that has children. Sunday
[32:33] school and age and younger, you're uh
[32:37] welcome to come out. Grandmas are
[32:39] welcome also. And uh so we just want you
[32:44] to rem remember that. And also this
[32:47] Saturday, Lord willing, Saturday's a big
[32:49] day. It's brothers Matthew's birthday
[32:52] and brother Jay's birthday, but it's
[32:55] also a work day uh on the on the
[33:00] pavilion. So, uh, we, uh, we want to do
[33:04] that, uh, and see if we can maybe do a
[33:08] work a little bit on the Cornish and
[33:10] decking and staining, some paneling,
[33:12] and, uh, see if we can get that all
[33:15] finished by the 19th. Uh and then also
[33:19] Saturday morning, I'd like to meet with
[33:21] all the ministers and those who feel
[33:24] that they might have a call or are
[33:27] praying about the ministry, you know,
[33:30] for just about an hour or so uh over
[33:33] maybe some coffee and some snacks of
[33:37] some sort. So, uh, if you're a minister
[33:39] and and or you feel you got a call to
[33:42] the ministry, you're wondering about it,
[33:44] we'd just like to all meet together, uh,
[33:47] we're going to kind of discuss our path
[33:49] forward and, uh, we'd love to have you,
[33:53] uh, uh, there. So, uh, um, and also
[33:59] we're going are looking at enlarging the
[34:02] platform, uh, just a little bit so we
[34:05] can have some more musicians join us and
[34:08] have some of our local ministers join us
[34:10] up here on the platform. So, we'll make
[34:13] it look pretty and uh, so just help us
[34:17] pray about that. And then this Sunday
[34:20] morning, uh, I'm going to be ministering
[34:23] out of, uh, the message end time
[34:25] evangelism.
[34:27] And then brother Matthew's going to
[34:29] follow up Sunday evening. And we're
[34:32] looking forward for a wonderful time in
[34:34] the Lord as we're uh, we'll continue to
[34:38] express to you what uh, I feel God's
[34:42] doing. You know, Brother Brandham said
[34:44] that every time there's a world turmoil
[34:49] that God's fixing to do something.
[34:53] And and you know, there's been some
[34:55] events in our country in the last uh few
[35:01] weeks that have really
[35:05] I mean things are just tore up. uh
[35:08] people are just going
[35:11] crazy. I mean, I don't know another word
[35:13] for it that if they're everybody's
[35:16] pointing fingers and blaming and and and
[35:20] you know, I I feel, you know, my heart
[35:23] goes out. Uh three officers lost their
[35:27] life in Pennsylvania. Uh there's just
[35:31] ter events going and that's all that
[35:35] what that is. We still know God's got a
[35:38] plan and and and we've got to go
[35:42] forward. And this is a statement that
[35:44] brother Brandon made and I think it's
[35:47] beautiful. He said, "The word has to
[35:50] unfold itself."
[35:54] The unfailing word must unfold
[35:58] itself.
[36:00] It's got to in order because the word is
[36:06] God. And if it worked on others all down
[36:10] through the age, it'll work the same way
[36:14] right now because it's God.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Don't never forget that. So unbelief
[36:25] doesn't stop God. The terrible
[36:28] environment doesn't keep us from having
[36:30] an undying faith to bring every promise
[36:33] of God to pass. So, let us just stand
[36:37] again and we'll sing uh Amazing Grace as
[36:41] we invite brother Ben to come and open
[36:44] the scriptures and and and fellowship
[36:47] with us. And uh you know I I I'm looking
[36:51] forward for a fresh start in my life and
[36:55] and more of the presence of God and the
[36:58] power of God and and and
[37:01] maybe time to draw our sword and start
[37:05] fighting back at the devil. Don't you
[37:07] think?
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's tormented us long
[37:10] enough.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; So let's get ready to wave goodbye to
[37:14] him.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Get into the presence of the Lord. love
[37:18] them and worship them and we'll see what
[37:21] God has for us. I think he's got a lot
[37:23] of wonderful things for us. Amen. And
[37:26] especially for those around us, we
[37:28] believe God's grace is mighty. Let's
[37:30] sing it as we invite Brother Ben this
[37:32] evening.
[37:34] Oh may
[37:37] sing great
[37:41] how sweet
[37:44] the sound
[37:47] that save
[37:53] like me.
[37:59] I once
[38:02] was lost
[38:05] but now
[38:10] [Music]
[38:16] I see. Let's sing that second verse.
[38:20] It's so true.
[38:22] Such praise
[38:25] and all
[38:28] my heart

[39:47] Praise God.
[39:50] Praise
[39:51] God.
[39:53] Hallelujah.
[39:55] The Lord put this uh song on my heart as
[39:58] I was studying. If y'all could help me
[40:01] sing it. All I want to see is Jesus. You
[40:04] know, with with everything that
[40:07] our pastor's been the Lord's led him to
[40:10] show us within the word.
[40:14] Truly, when you look at yourself, your
[40:17] heart's cry is to see him. Not to see
[40:20] yourself,
[40:21] &gt;&gt; not to see your failures and
[40:22] shortcomings, but to see him.
[40:26] And oh I know the time is near where
[40:32] everything that I hold thee will lay
[40:37] before the holy
[40:40] cons.
[40:46] All my words and all my deeds and every
[40:51] prayer said on my knees will lay before
[40:56] the holy God soon to be fire.
[41:03] All I want to see
[41:07] is Jesus.
[41:12] Oh, all I want to see
[41:16] is him in me.
[41:21] All I want to see
[41:24] is Jesus
[41:30] shine
[41:33] through me.
[41:38] hurt and selfinflicted
[41:41] pain and everything that I thought gain.
[41:47] Oh, they before the holy
[41:51] consuming
[41:53] fire.
[41:56] Words of knowledge in his name and
[42:00] healing hands that touch the lake will
[42:05] lay before the holy
[42:08] ghost consuming
[42:11] fire.
[42:13] All I want to see
[42:17] is Jesus.
[42:20] [Music]
[42:22] All I want to see
[42:26] is heaven with me.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer?
[42:31] All I want to see is Jesus
[42:39] shine
[42:43] through me
[42:46] and hear him say,
[42:50] "Oh, well done.
[42:55] Oh my gracious
[43:01] one.
[43:04] Well done.
[43:08] Well done.
[43:11] [Music]
[43:13] I faithful.
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:17] [Music]
[43:23] All I want to see
[43:26] is Jesus.
[43:31] All I want to see
[43:35] is
[43:37] me.
[43:40] All I want to see is Jesus
[43:48] shine.
[43:51] [Music]
[43:55] Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly
[43:56] father. Lord, that's truly our heart's
[43:59] desire. Lord, when it's all said and
[44:02] done, Lord,
[44:04] I believe it's every true believer's
[44:06] heart's desire to not see themsel, Lord,
[44:10] but to see you, Lord Jesus. Your prophet
[44:14] Paul spoke and said, "It's no more I
[44:16] that liveth, but Christ that liveth in
[44:18] me." He said that he must die daily so
[44:22] that you might live, Lord Jesus. Father,
[44:26] that's my heart's desire. That's your
[44:28] people's desire that Ben gets out of the
[44:31] way, Lord. And it be you that the world
[44:33] sees, Father. It be you that all those
[44:37] that we encounter may be able to see,
[44:39] Father. Can they really see your light
[44:41] in your life in us, Father? Lord, if
[44:43] there's anything in your way hindering
[44:46] you from having full preeminence and
[44:48] control in our lives and in our hearts
[44:51] so we could shine forth your light,
[44:53] Father, we ask, Lord, that you remove
[44:55] that obstacle out of the way. Nothing
[44:57] stands before your perfect will, Father.
[45:00] Then your prophet said in this hour that
[45:02] God would have a bride and she would
[45:04] manifest all that was said of her to
[45:06] manifest. There will not be one that
[45:09] fails to manifest what it is they were
[45:11] supposed to, Lord Jesus. Because you
[45:13] never send your word and it return to
[45:15] you void, but it always lands exactly
[45:18] where you want it to, Lord Jesus. We ask
[45:21] you to just have your way in the
[45:22] service. Father, set me aside, Lord.
[45:26] calm my nerves, Lord Jesus. And Father,
[45:28] may you use my lips, Lord, to be able to
[45:31] say something, Father. If it's but a
[45:33] minute, if it's but five minute, if it's
[45:35] but just a sentence, a word, something
[45:37] that blesses one person, Lord Jesus,
[45:40] that it was good for us to have made a
[45:41] sacrifice to come into your house. Lord,
[45:44] we thank you, Lord Jesus. Just ask you
[45:46] to have the preeminence now, Father. We
[45:49] ask this in your precious and mighty and
[45:51] wonderful name. Amen.
[45:54] Thank you musicians. As you're standing,
[45:57] go ahead and turn in the
[46:03] the book of uh St. John, chapter 20,
[46:20] my the Bible I normally use.
[46:24] the cover of it broke. So, I had to
[46:28] bring my study Bible. And if you know,
[46:32] the Thompson chain Bible is big. So,
[46:35] carrying this thing around is and then
[46:37] turning pages and it's all different,
[46:42] but nevertheless,
[46:44] it's the word of the Lord.
[46:49] Let's read in verse 19. Starting in
[46:52] verse 19,
[46:55] he says, "Then then the same day at
[46:57] evening being the first day of the week,
[47:00] when the doors were shut, where the
[47:02] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[47:04] Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the
[47:06] midst, and said unto them, Peace be unto
[47:09] you." And when he had said so, he showed
[47:11] unto them his hands and his side. Then
[47:15] were the disciples glad when they saw
[47:17] the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again,
[47:19] "Peace be unto you. As my Father had
[47:22] sent me, even so send I you." And when
[47:26] he had said this, he breathed on them,
[47:29] and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy
[47:31] Ghost. Whosoever sins ye remit, they are
[47:34] remitted unto them. And whosoever sins
[47:37] ye retain, they are retained. We're
[47:40] going to read that 23rd verse again
[47:42] because it it struck me. Whosoever sins
[47:45] ye remit, they are remitted unto them.
[47:49] And whosoever sins ye retain, they are
[47:52] retained. May the Lord add a blessing to
[47:54] the reading of his word. You may be
[47:56] seated.
[48:04] You know, as our a pastor was
[48:05] ministering on Sunday, speaking of
[48:10] the greater work, you know, the great
[48:12] commission, go ye into all the world and
[48:14] preach the gospel. The most important
[48:17] thing that was given to us, the Lord
[48:20] gave us power not for us to be content
[48:23] with calling ourselves believers. Not
[48:25] for us to be content with being Holy
[48:28] Ghost filled. It's not to downplay the
[48:31] power of the Holy Ghost or the necessity
[48:33] of the Holy Ghost. You need the Holy
[48:35] Ghost to be a part of his kingdom. You
[48:38] need the Holy Ghost to do anything for
[48:39] him. But you can't be satisfied with
[48:42] just receiving the Holy Ghost because he
[48:45] doesn't just give it to you just so you
[48:47] can say, "I've got it." But he gives it
[48:49] to you for a purpose. He gives it to you
[48:52] to fulfill something,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; right? And he gave them a commission and
[48:56] told them, "Go ye into all the world,
[48:58] preach the gospel." But before they
[49:00] could go, they had to wait to be endued
[49:02] with power from on high. So the power he
[49:05] gives you is for purpose. It's not for
[49:07] for nothing. It's not to rest. It's not
[49:10] to settle, but it's got a there there's
[49:12] something in mind with what he gives
[49:14] you.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as as I was just pondering uh
[49:18] the sermons our our pastor has been been
[49:21] led to show us and I really appreciated
[49:24] uh once again looking at the
[49:28] 20th century prophet film that they made
[49:30] to see the prophet you know you hear the
[49:32] voice and then you see his you see his
[49:34] face you see him talk you see his
[49:35] mannerisms you see how he carried
[49:37] himself such humility and then you see
[49:39] in deep call to the deep you see the
[49:42] same thing and what what I found
[49:44] interesting was you know there was a man
[49:47] who spoke to you and said I'm waiting
[49:48] for somebody and then right then and
[49:51] there the person he was waiting for
[49:53] arrives at that point he says I'll take
[49:56] every spirit in this building under my
[49:58] control you see the kind of power he had
[50:01] and then you see his actions
[50:03] &gt;&gt; after receiving such power
[50:05] &gt;&gt; right and then when you try when you try
[50:07] to align that with us in this hour you
[50:09] start looking within yourself and it's
[50:11] like well so I hear this person say
[50:14] they've got power and this is their
[50:16] behavior. I hear that person say they've
[50:17] got power and this is their behavior. I
[50:20] see this person says they've got power
[50:22] and that's the behavior. But then you
[50:24] see the very sheath offering itself that
[50:26] was supposed to be waved over you to
[50:29] show you what a mature son looks like.
[50:31] What a man with power and authority
[50:33] looks like. Brother Brandham would
[50:35] highlight in his sermon and mention and
[50:37] say that the greatest anointing that was
[50:39] ever on a man was on Jesus Christ when
[50:42] he when he spoke and said uh I I believe
[50:45] he speaks about the commission that he
[50:46] was given that he was called to preach
[50:48] the acceptable year of the Lord to set
[50:50] the captive free for the lame to walk.
[50:52] And he's speaking of all these things.
[50:54] Brother Brandham said that was the
[50:55] greatest anointing that was ever on a
[50:58] man. And he specifies and says, "The
[51:00] Lord sat down."
[51:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; With with such power as that
[51:05] &gt;&gt; he sat down.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; I You know that sometimes, you know,
[51:11] that that'll that'll start turning your
[51:12] mind a bit. You're like, "Well, you mean
[51:15] the Lord Jesus Christ, God himself in
[51:18] the flesh with all power and authority,
[51:21] &gt;&gt; he himself with all that power, he
[51:23] didn't boast.
[51:25] In fact, he told you, "I come not to
[51:27] speak of myself,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; but with all that power, he sat down
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and and you know, just you look at that
[51:35] attitude that he had and then you mirror
[51:38] that and you look at the sheath offering
[51:40] that was given to us. You see there's
[51:42] there's kindred spirits here
[51:44] &gt;&gt; because he says if that same spirit that
[51:46] was in Christ dwell in you, it'll also
[51:48] quicken your mortal body. It'll bring
[51:50] you, it should bring you to the same
[51:52] maturity.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Me like in in what sense?
[51:56] No one, no one is telling you how to
[51:58] act, how to behave, how to be be who God
[52:02] made you.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; But don't mistake enthusiasm for power,
[52:08] &gt;&gt; right? Enthusiasm is is good. You you
[52:10] want to be excited. You want to be
[52:12] happy. But that doesn't mean power.
[52:15] Power is knowing what he said,
[52:19] &gt;&gt; believing 100% on what he said and
[52:22] standing on what he said. That's true
[52:25] power. When you can get a son that knows
[52:28] what the word says of him and he has a
[52:31] promise and an obstacle is before him
[52:33] and he says, "Lord, you said in your
[52:35] word,"
[52:37] &gt;&gt; if he can have a 100% faith in that
[52:39] word, that is a powerful man. That's the
[52:43] same kind of power. I've often wondered,
[52:47] you know, uh Josh, the Lord, you know
[52:50] what? I'm just gonna let go and let God.
[52:52] But you know, I've often wondered, we we
[52:55] look at Joshua, right? When Joshua
[52:57] stopped the son
[52:59] &gt;&gt; and he spoke, I wonder how he did it.
[53:03] Was it, "Oh, son, you better listen to
[53:05] me now, son. Pause where you're at."
[53:09] Or was it simply, I have need of you to
[53:12] pause.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; What authority.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Son, stop.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; I've got something I have to do.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And you setting is not in the plan.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; I've got to fulfill this thing God asked
[53:26] me to do. I need you to stay put exactly
[53:30] where you're at. Oh yeah.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; If we get the same kind of attitude.
[53:34] See, when you align yourself with the
[53:36] word, when you align yourself with what
[53:39] he said,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; you all you have to do is say what he
[53:43] said.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Simply put, just say what he said. We
[53:47] saw the example. They would come up.
[53:49] Brother Brandham would pray and said,
[53:51] "Sister, go and be well in Jesus name."
[53:53] And as she walks off, the spirit tells
[53:56] him, "Get get her back." He gets home.
[53:58] He said, "Wait a minute. a lie was
[54:00] spoken over you. See, all he said was,
[54:03] "Go and be well." Then the spirit said,
[54:05] "Hold on. I'm not done." And he got her
[54:07] attention again. And then he discerned
[54:10] the thoughts in her mind.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; But the simplicity and then other times
[54:14] he just says, "Go and be well.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; You are healed. Go and be well." And you
[54:18] and you start to see this is what
[54:20] brother Brandham described when he
[54:22] preaches Abraham's covenant about Adam
[54:24] having unconscious faith that there was
[54:27] no thought. Adam knew whatever he said,
[54:30] he was given the authority for that
[54:31] thing to come to pass. So when a son
[54:34] comes to maturity, which is being
[54:36] brought back to that same condition Adam
[54:39] was in, all you have to do if you're a
[54:42] true son, is speak the word.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; There's there's nothing else. There's no
[54:47] workup you have to do.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; All you've got to do is say, "Lord, your
[54:52] word says." Now, if your nature is an
[54:54] excitable person, be as excitable as you
[54:57] possibly can. That's who God made you.
[55:01] If your nature is to be still and to be
[55:03] quiet and not be so loud, be who God
[55:07] made you. Do not let anyone, nor I, I
[55:11] trust not even our pastor would tell you
[55:13] or any of the ministers to be any kind
[55:15] of way except how God made you. There's
[55:19] a reason for that. He's a God of
[55:21] variety,
[55:22] &gt;&gt; but what stays constant is his word.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; So whether you're enthused, whether
[55:28] you're not, as long as the word is on
[55:30] your lips, you've got full authority
[55:33] &gt;&gt; to speak whatever it is you desire and
[55:36] it come to pass.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; In Mark uh 16, it says, and this is just
[55:44] some of the commission that he gives.
[55:46] Mark 16:15-18. And he said unto them,
[55:48] "Go ye into all the world and preach the
[55:51] gospel. To every creature. He that
[55:54] believeth and is baptized shall be
[55:56] saved, but he that believeth not shall
[55:58] be damned. And these signs shall follow
[56:02] them that believe. In my name shall they
[56:05] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[56:07] new tongues. They shall take up
[56:09] serpents. And if they drink any deadly
[56:10] thing, it shall not hurt them. They
[56:13] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[56:15] shall recover. And Jesus came and spake
[56:18] unto them. This is Matthew 28:18.
[56:21] And Jesus came and spake unto them,
[56:23] saying, All power is given unto me in
[56:27] heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and
[56:30] teach all nations, baptizing them in the
[56:34] name of the Father and the Son and the
[56:36] Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all
[56:39] things whatsoever I have commanded you.
[56:43] See, I I have to drop this in there
[56:45] because the Lord just gave it to me.
[56:47] Notice he says, "Go ye therefore and
[56:49] teach all nations."
[56:53] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter where you're from,
[56:55] &gt;&gt; what part of the country you're from.
[56:57] Let's just catch what he says here. Go
[57:00] and teach all nations. You tell me if he
[57:02] gives them a different message.
[57:04] Baptizing them in the name of the Father
[57:07] and the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
[57:09] teaching them to observe all things
[57:12] whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo,
[57:15] I am with you always, even unto the end
[57:19] of the world. Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; So, what what does that mean?
[57:24] That means
[57:26] all that he has commanded
[57:28] &gt;&gt; in this hour we received the message
[57:31] which was Jesus Christ himself.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't America's message.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It wasn't India's message.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Asia's message. It was the
[57:44] message according to this scripture. I
[57:48] moved to believe it's all the same for
[57:51] everybody and we all have to fall in
[57:53] line with the same message. We can't
[57:56] have something tailor made to our ideas,
[58:00] to our ways of living, to the ways we
[58:03] were raised because a true disciple, and
[58:06] we'll get into this later, but a true
[58:08] disciple is not just one that follows,
[58:11] right? He he called pe uh Matthew,
[58:14] James, John. He called those his
[58:15] disciples because they followed him. But
[58:18] they weren't really true disciples till
[58:21] they received the spirit.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Because being a disciple, according to
[58:26] the definition, is to imitate the life.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; They couldn't imitate the life without
[58:32] the life in them.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. So they were they were it
[58:35] was the earnest of disciplehip.
[58:38] Once they received the spirit and they
[58:40] were endued with power then they could
[58:42] actually live the life of a disciple and
[58:46] they could not just be a follower but an
[58:49] imitator.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Watch the life.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; This is what it says. And this is why
[58:53] it's important what the Lord put on our
[58:56] pastor to show us. You have to have
[58:58] something you're looking towards. You
[59:00] have to have an example that you're
[59:02] focused on. If you don't have a target,
[59:05] you don't know what you're striving to
[59:07] achieve.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not st I'm not striving to achieve a
[59:12] certain kind of I if if I could say
[59:15] energy, a certain kind of uh uh uh uh uh
[59:19] uh matching your personality, matching
[59:22] this. I'm not striving for that. What
[59:24] I'm striving for is is is the same meek
[59:28] spirit, the humble, the humility that he
[59:31] had, the lowering of himself, the kind
[59:35] of spirit that makes you stand by
[59:37] someone and say, "Hey, man, my my shoes
[59:39] and your feet. I I hope that I hope
[59:41] these can fit you." That say, "Man, my
[59:43] coat. I'd love to give you my coat."
[59:44] It's that we have something we're
[59:47] looking towards. And this is an example
[59:49] for us because our Bible tells us to be
[59:53] disciples.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; He commisss them to make disciples not
[59:58] unto themselves. Paul never said follow
[1:00:02] me. I know your mind goes Paul said
[1:00:04] follow me like but then he says like I
[1:00:06] follow Christ. So his example was
[1:00:09] Christ. He wasn't asking them to follow
[1:00:12] him the person. He says I'm following
[1:00:15] him. You follow me as I'm following him.
[1:00:19] If Paul misaligned, that's why he said,
[1:00:22] "Even if an angel from heaven come down
[1:00:24] and say anything against what I have
[1:00:26] spoken to you, let him be accursed."
[1:00:29] Because Paul knew what he was saying was
[1:00:31] not of himself. He knew who gave them
[1:00:33] the word. Therefore,
[1:00:36] my example
[1:00:38] on what maturity looks like,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; on what Jesus in the flesh looks like,
[1:00:45] my first example is our prophet.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; The sheath offering shows us what it
[1:00:50] means for a son to come to true maturity
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; and have all power in his hands.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Don't let that offend you. And don't put
[1:01:01] that in the office of a prophet
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; because it's also given to you a son to
[1:01:06] have the same power as he had.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Was it a prophet that moved the
[1:01:11] chandelier or was it a son?
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Was it a prophet that stopped the storm
[1:01:17] or was it a son?
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; It was a son. If we're not careful, you
[1:01:22] start to place things in the realms of a
[1:01:24] prophet and you and you leave it there
[1:01:28] and you deny yourself the full maturity
[1:01:30] because you say, "I could never achieve
[1:01:32] that because that was only supposed to
[1:01:34] happen in that vessel." But I'm sorry.
[1:01:37] Since I was young and knew this message,
[1:01:40] I didn't live it all my life the best I
[1:01:43] could. But something in my heart said,
[1:01:46] "I I want to be able to create
[1:01:48] squirrels.
[1:01:51] Think of a child. If you ask a child,
[1:01:54] you say, "What do you want?" And the
[1:01:56] child says, my my dad told me a story
[1:01:58] one time of of um he'd be my great
[1:02:01] uncle. He had his kids sitting around
[1:02:03] and they were praying and he said,
[1:02:05] "Well, you know, ask God anything you
[1:02:07] want. God will give it to you." The
[1:02:08] little girl says, "You said ask
[1:02:10] anything." You know, when a when a child
[1:02:13] specifies, "Ask anything." You know what
[1:02:15] they're about to ask is crazy. She said,
[1:02:16] "You said ask anything." He said, "Yes,
[1:02:18] ask anything." and God will give it to
[1:02:20] you. She said, "Lord, give me beignet."
[1:02:24] Beignet, which is which is it's it's
[1:02:26] it's how do I explain it to you? We'll
[1:02:29] call it African donuts. She says, "Give
[1:02:32] me beignet." Translation, "Give me
[1:02:34] African donut." The father says, "No,
[1:02:36] no, no. It doesn't work like that."
[1:02:39] My dad, when he told that story to my
[1:02:41] dad, my dad said, "You just stopped
[1:02:43] God." A childlike faith
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; that just speaks what it wants.
[1:02:48] expecting to receive it because you told
[1:02:51] the child, "Ask anything, it'll be given
[1:02:53] to you." Then you say that to the child,
[1:02:56] then you hinder the child from doing the
[1:02:58] very thing you just told them to do.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Who knows? Maybe in the asking of Lord,
[1:03:04] give me bign,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; somebody would have stopped by a couple
[1:03:07] minutes after and said, "I don't know
[1:03:09] why, but I I'm here to leave this for
[1:03:12] you. I I don't know what's moved on me,
[1:03:15] but I've got to bring this to you." We
[1:03:17] have to have childlike faith
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; where you just know daddy's going to
[1:03:22] make it happen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what I ask for.
[1:03:25] Daddy's going to make it happen because
[1:03:27] daddy's able to do anything.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Daddy's got the power to do anything.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith God wants us to
[1:03:35] have.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; That's what a son looks like.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He just speaks
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and he's foolish enough to believe it'll
[1:03:44] be given to him.
[1:03:46] But we need that kind of foolish faith
[1:03:48] sometimes.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we organize too much in our
[1:03:51] minds and plan out how God's supposed to
[1:03:54] do something.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to let faith loose.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Let faith loose. God could have taught
[1:04:03] her a valuable lesson that could have
[1:04:05] changed and done something for her for
[1:04:08] her entire life that she could have been
[1:04:10] able to point back to and said the same
[1:04:12] God that I asked give me Beign and
[1:04:14] provided it is the same God in this
[1:04:16] circumstance when I ask something will
[1:04:19] give it to me. Have you ever asked for
[1:04:21] something that seemed impossible
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; and then in the foolishness God grants
[1:04:26] it to you?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; I know what that looks like.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. for when I graduated high school.
[1:04:32] Just just to give an example, when I
[1:04:34] graduated high school,
[1:04:36] I I I needed some clothes to
[1:04:40] for graduation. I needed some pants. I
[1:04:42] needed a shirt. I needed some some
[1:04:44] things. It was a need. It wasn't a want.
[1:04:46] It was a need. And you know, I, you
[1:04:49] know, was praying about it. Uh my dad
[1:04:51] and mom were weren't able to get it for
[1:04:53] me at the time. And I was just, Lord,
[1:04:55] you know, I I have this need. Father,
[1:04:58] you know the need. And whatever you do,
[1:05:00] whether you give it to me or not, I'll
[1:05:01] go in jeans. It doesn't matter. But I
[1:05:05] have need of this thing. And I left it
[1:05:07] alone. And you know, just wondering, my
[1:05:10] mom's like, she was she was bugging me
[1:05:11] all week.
[1:05:13] Listen to a child. My mom was bugging me
[1:05:15] all week. But she she was, "Ben, Ben,
[1:05:17] Ben, your uncle's been calling you. You
[1:05:19] got to you got to you got to call him
[1:05:20] back." I'm like, "Man, what's he calling
[1:05:22] me for?" like I'm I'm so I was I'll call
[1:05:26] him. And I I I call him and and he says,
[1:05:29] "Hey, uh nephew." I was like, "Yeah,
[1:05:31] yeah." He said, "Um, hey, I've been
[1:05:33] wanting to take you shopping and I've
[1:05:35] been trying to get a hold of you and
[1:05:36] you're not answering."
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm like, before I even made the
[1:05:39] request, God already had the answer for
[1:05:42] what I had need of prepared. Mom didn't
[1:05:44] speak to him. My dad didn't speak to
[1:05:46] him. Something moved on his heart before
[1:05:49] I could ever speak. and what I asked
[1:05:51] for, he already had the answer coming.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; This goes to show you sometimes it's
[1:05:56] it's not in the asking alone. The asking
[1:05:59] is a part to play. But he's a good
[1:06:01] father. He knows what you have need of
[1:06:04] before you even ask. But you have to
[1:06:06] make the exercise of asking so that when
[1:06:09] you receive, you know, ask shall be
[1:06:11] given. It's a law. You have to have that
[1:06:14] law there. If you don't ask, you'll
[1:06:17] never receive.
[1:06:19] And he says uh
[1:06:23] in John 13:34, "A new commandment I give
[1:06:27] you, that ye love one another as I have
[1:06:31] loved you. That ye also love one
[1:06:34] another. By this shall all men know that
[1:06:37] ye are my disciples if you love one to
[1:06:40] another." This is where my inspiration
[1:06:44] kind of uh uh um comes in. He says,
[1:06:48] by this. What's this?
[1:06:52] That you love one another as I have
[1:06:55] loved you.
[1:06:57] See
[1:06:59] the kind of love the Lord had.
[1:07:02] Just go back to each one of the
[1:07:04] disciples when he called them, what they
[1:07:06] were doing, the kind of life they were
[1:07:09] living, and what he pulled them out of.
[1:07:12] Yet, having not yet received the spirit,
[1:07:15] yet he still loved them. Don't let the
[1:07:18] devil tell you because you don't know if
[1:07:19] you've got the Holy Ghost or not that
[1:07:21] God don't love you. That's not how God
[1:07:23] works. If you're his child, he loved you
[1:07:26] when you were unlovable.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; He cared about you when no one else did.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He desired to save you when you thought
[1:07:32] you couldn't be saved. His circumstances
[1:07:35] and conditions isn't based on ours. It's
[1:07:38] predestination.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; His choice, his election, what he
[1:07:42] desires. It's a plan that was there
[1:07:44] before you came in. You can't mess up
[1:07:47] his plan. It's his perfect plan.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; But it it it it struck me in that
[1:07:53] thought and my title meant to give it
[1:07:56] earlier but is who will be Jesus to
[1:07:59] them?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Because he asks us love one another as I
[1:08:05] have loved you that ye also love one
[1:08:08] another. By this shall all men. The sign
[1:08:11] that all men will look at and know that
[1:08:14] you're a disciple of God is not how many
[1:08:17] miracles you've done.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Not how many Hail Marys you've done,
[1:08:23] not how many church services you've
[1:08:25] attended.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; It's love.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Love puffet not.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Love is patient. Yes,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; this this is what he's saying. You'll
[1:08:40] know you're my disciples by the love.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And I begin to see something in me.
[1:08:47] Who will be Jesus to them?
[1:08:52] Do they see Jesus in me?
[1:08:56] Does my life match his? If I'm to be his
[1:08:59] disciple,
[1:09:00] does it align?
[1:09:03] Do my attributes do am I resembling him?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Is my heart like his
[1:09:10] my actions and my father I do nothing
[1:09:14] lest you show with me first or am I
[1:09:19] ask questions later do it first. It's
[1:09:23] better to ask for forgiveness than
[1:09:25] permission.
[1:09:26] That's not how God works. Permission
[1:09:29] first because if not you will mess it
[1:09:32] up. He might give you a vision of
[1:09:34] something and if you act before it's
[1:09:36] time, you will surely mess it up
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean he won't work it out
[1:09:44] because he worked all things.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Even those things you do that you messed
[1:09:49] up, he will find some way
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; to get it back in line.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; So don't fret if you've already messed
[1:09:57] it up.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Don't fret if you've already
[1:10:01] royally messed it up.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; He'll take care of it.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; All you have to do as a son,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; get back in line.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I've made a mess of things."
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; But you, you're the mess. You fix all
[1:10:18] messes.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; When the puzzle pieces don't fit, you
[1:10:22] switch them out with the correct ones.
[1:10:24] When I try to force a picture, force an
[1:10:27] image, and it's the wrong one, you
[1:10:29] change the image. I was never meant to
[1:10:31] manifest this image.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; It's It's like if you if if you ever
[1:10:37] It's just
[1:10:39] you think of a puzzle. You got a picture
[1:10:42] you're looking at and you're making the
[1:10:44] puzzle
[1:10:45] and you put all the pieces together and
[1:10:48] they fit, but the image isn't right.
[1:10:54] All the pieces fit or you made them fit,
[1:10:58] but it doesn't make the image.
[1:11:04] He didn't ask you when you saw the wrong
[1:11:07] image to then go, "Oh man, I got to fix
[1:11:09] this. I got to I got to correct this. I
[1:11:11] got to change this. I need to No, no,
[1:11:13] no, no, no. Step back and look at the
[1:11:16] big picture. The image you created is
[1:11:19] attached to this flesh. His image has no
[1:11:22] part with you.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; You You can't participate in the image
[1:11:25] he creates. He uses your vessel to do
[1:11:29] his perfect will.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He uses your voice to speak. He uses
[1:11:33] your hands to work. This is what God
[1:11:36] does. He corrects the image himself.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; It it's it struck me when we look at our
[1:11:44] attitudes.
[1:11:48] He commisss them make disciples. He
[1:11:52] tells them you'll know them. You'll know
[1:11:55] they will know that you are disciples of
[1:11:57] me by your love one for another. Then it
[1:12:00] struck me. It behooves me to look at
[1:12:03] some of the things the Lord Jesus did
[1:12:07] that showed who he was and if I have the
[1:12:10] same attitude towards the same things.
[1:12:14] You see, we're so quick at times when we
[1:12:18] see somebody in fault, when we see
[1:12:21] somebody in the wrong. I'm drawing my
[1:12:24] inspiration from the sermon uh that our
[1:12:26] pastor preached out of
[1:12:30] taking sides with Jesus. I didn't know
[1:12:32] that it was in there when this thought
[1:12:34] came to my mind because we finished a
[1:12:37] portion we were listening to and then I
[1:12:40] the Lord put this thought in my mind
[1:12:41] before I was asked to speak and as I was
[1:12:44] thinking I'm like Lord I need what
[1:12:46] sermon am I going to find this in I I
[1:12:48] see it in your word so your prophet had
[1:12:50] to have preached it
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; and I was you know what our pastor's
[1:12:54] been in taking sides with Jesus let me
[1:12:57] just listen to that and I listen to
[1:12:59] after he gets done with that first part
[1:13:02] and he starts now preaching taking sides
[1:13:04] with Jesus. And I said, "Lord, you work
[1:13:06] all things. You make everything
[1:13:08] perfect."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Because then the the Lord just started
[1:13:11] everything line by line by line,
[1:13:14] ministering to me, dealing with me. But
[1:13:17] I saw we look at one another, we judge,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; we gossip,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; we ridicule.
[1:13:29] Oftent times, if you're honest with
[1:13:31] yourself, you set traps for people,
[1:13:34] whether it's in a line of questioning to
[1:13:37] get them to say something and then for
[1:13:40] you to anchor in that thing that they
[1:13:41] said to then have something to gossip
[1:13:43] about, something to talk about. But I I
[1:13:48] found it completely contradictory to the
[1:13:52] life and action of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:54] Christ.
[1:13:56] I took three examples and we're going to
[1:13:58] walk through the examples. I won't be
[1:14:00] much longer. There's a lot to say, but I
[1:14:03] can't say it all.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; We we look at these things and we judge.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; We say, "Man, that man, that person did
[1:14:14] wrong. If he had the Holy Ghost, he
[1:14:15] wouldn't have acted that way.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Man, that person did this. You You don't
[1:14:21] understand. I mean, if he was a true
[1:14:23] believer, he wouldn't behave that way.
[1:14:25] Then I start looking at Jesus in the
[1:14:27] Bible and I start realizing
[1:14:30] every person that everybody else judged,
[1:14:33] he had a heart for.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; You call this person a prostitute. You
[1:14:40] call this person this. You say all these
[1:14:42] things about them.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; We don't even give a second glance. It's
[1:14:47] as if we walk with a meter of sin in our
[1:14:50] hands and we see somebody living in sin
[1:14:54] automatically, man. If the Lord Jesus
[1:14:56] was here today, man, he would just he
[1:14:58] would tear this nation apart.
[1:15:01] But we know his heart because he's told
[1:15:04] it to us. He would love to have saved
[1:15:07] everybody. That's the kind of attitude
[1:15:10] he had.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He wasn't there with a measuring stick.
[1:15:14] He knew who was his child and who
[1:15:16] wasn't.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Yet he still told Cain, "If you do as
[1:15:20] your brother,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; but I wonder if we do that."
[1:15:26] Do we have the attribute in the life of
[1:15:28] Christ? This struck me. The greater
[1:15:31] works is the saving of souls.
[1:15:36] You can't expect somebody else
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; to reach the people you have access to
[1:15:42] at your job.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Don't put it on me.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Don't put it on brother Billy. Don't put
[1:15:48] it on our pastor.
[1:15:51] He placed you there
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; because you could reach them.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; You have to be Jesus to them.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Your life must be salty.
[1:16:03] you're the example.
[1:16:05] But I wondered, I saw it within myself
[1:16:08] where I'm walking around, it's like,
[1:16:09] "Oh, pity, man. That if the Lord was
[1:16:12] here, man, he just wouldn't like that."
[1:16:16] That's not how God's attitude was.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; He hated the sin,
[1:16:22] not the sinner.
[1:16:24] when he's so wrong and everybody's
[1:16:27] piling and piling. Brother Brandham
[1:16:29] showed it to you in his own life with
[1:16:31] the woman at the restaurant that he
[1:16:33] walks in and he has a measuring stick of
[1:16:36] sin and he's judging and condemning her
[1:16:40] and the Lord showed him himself
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; and he had to be Jesus to her.
[1:16:48] Hey, though your sins are many, the
[1:16:51] blood of Jesus will cleanse it all. You
[1:16:54] haven't gone too far.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; You haven't done too much.
[1:16:58] What's our attitude?
[1:17:02] I started looking at
[1:17:05] the prostitute that they brought to him.
[1:17:09] I I I want to I want to read this. But
[1:17:15] Jesus went onto the Mount of Olives.
[1:17:17] John 8. And early in the morning, he
[1:17:19] came again into the temple. And all the
[1:17:22] people came unto him, and he sat down
[1:17:25] and taught them. And the scribes and
[1:17:27] Pharisees brought him a woman taken in
[1:17:30] adultery. They caught her in the act,
[1:17:35] and brought her to him to be judged.
[1:17:38] And it it opened up to me and struck me.
[1:17:42] How many times does somebody bring to
[1:17:45] you a brother, a sister's fault,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; expecting you to judge, to say something
[1:17:51] about it,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; rather than looking at the moment the
[1:17:56] same way Christ did,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; they're trying to get Jesus to say
[1:18:02] something, judge her. Though the law
[1:18:05] condemned her,
[1:18:08] You could find me somebody in sin.
[1:18:12] What would your attitude be towards that
[1:18:14] believer?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Would we say the same way Jesus did or
[1:18:20] would we be ready there to cast the
[1:18:22] first stone?
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, you sinner, you. If you had any
[1:18:26] ounce of Holy Ghost in you, you wouldn't
[1:18:28] do that.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; That wasn't Jesus's attitude.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; We're maturing.
[1:18:36] Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; We're headed somewhere.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; We have to be sons imparting
[1:18:41] eternal life to others.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; When everybody else wants to pile up and
[1:18:46] judge and condemn, open up your heart.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Draw them in.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; People are yearning for Jesus.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; They need something real.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And if you're not that example,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; they may miss their opportunity.
[1:19:05] You have to speak. You have to show the
[1:19:07] life, show the love, the care.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; We're so quick to have a stern hand of
[1:19:13] judgment when wrong takes place. But God
[1:19:16] was merciful.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I trust all of you. I I've seen it.
[1:19:23] Somebody bring me someone's fault,
[1:19:25] someone's error. Man, could you believe
[1:19:27] brother so and so did this, this, this?
[1:19:29] Sister so and so did this, that, and the
[1:19:31] third.
[1:19:32] If you're not careful, you start saying,
[1:19:34] "Man, I really don't, man. Yeah, man,
[1:19:36] that's unfort that that that happened.
[1:19:38] Man, how could they have done that?" And
[1:19:40] you start adding to it. When you're
[1:19:43] called to kill it,
[1:19:46] you you'll hear Brother Brandham say it
[1:19:48] in the sermon.
[1:19:49] You're supposed to cover it.
[1:19:52] Love covers a multitude of sins.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to say, "Oh, those are
[1:19:59] your sins, brother. Come here. I I I'll
[1:20:02] still accept you.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I'll still love you
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; if you show the life of Christ. Brother
[1:20:09] Brandham said, "The greatest power there
[1:20:11] is is love."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Love heals. Love saves.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You have to be able to have true love.
[1:20:19] Even for your enemy, even for the one
[1:20:21] that does something despicable, you have
[1:20:24] to be able to love him.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That's the life of Christ.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Loving the unlovable. Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Forgiving the unforgivable.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; The commission is he whose sins you
[1:20:36] remit shall be remitted. He whose sins
[1:20:39] you retain shall be retained. I don't
[1:20:42] know about you. I don't want to retain
[1:20:44] any of your sins.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; It's not given to me.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Because how you judge is how you're
[1:20:52] judged.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; There's grace, an abundance of grace.
[1:20:56] That should be our attitude.
[1:20:59] He says, "They say unto him, Master,
[1:21:02] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[1:21:04] very act. Now Moses in the law commanded
[1:21:07] us that such should be stoned. But what
[1:21:11] sayest thou?"
[1:21:14] This they said, tempting him,
[1:21:17] that they might have to accuse him. But
[1:21:20] Jesus stooped down with his finger,
[1:21:22] wrote on the ground as though he heard
[1:21:24] them not. So when they continued asking
[1:21:27] him, he lifted up himself and said unto
[1:21:29] them, he that is without sin among you,
[1:21:32] let him first cast a stone at her. And
[1:21:35] again he stooped down and wrote on the
[1:21:37] ground.
[1:21:39] And they which heard it, being convicted
[1:21:41] by their own conscience, went out one by
[1:21:44] one, beginning at the eldest, even unto
[1:21:47] the last. And Jesus was left alone,
[1:21:51] and the woman standing in the midst.
[1:21:54] See, sometimes When somebody brings you
[1:21:58] someone's fault, someone's error,
[1:22:03] the person that brought it to you, you
[1:22:06] should send them away.
[1:22:08] Go to the person. Hey,
[1:22:13] I was told you were did this and so
[1:22:15] happened. You want to see your brother?
[1:22:18] Let's pray together and overcome this.
[1:22:21] That should be our attitude. We
[1:22:23] shouldn't join in the gossip. We
[1:22:26] shouldn't join in the tearing down of
[1:22:27] one another. We should be uplifting one
[1:22:30] another. That's what Jesus did. And I I
[1:22:34] begin to ask myself
[1:22:37] when Jesus lifted up himself. He's alone
[1:22:39] with her
[1:22:41] and saw none but the woman. He said unto
[1:22:45] her,"Woman,
[1:22:46] where are thine accusers?
[1:22:49] Hath no man condemned thee?"
[1:22:52] She said, "No, man, Lord." And Jesus
[1:22:56] said unto her, "Neither do I condemn
[1:22:58] thee. Go and sin no more."
[1:23:01] Is that the kind of attitude we want?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of attitude we ought to
[1:23:07] have.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; That's a mature son. That's the son,
[1:23:12] the first of the race.
[1:23:16] And you then you start matching it
[1:23:18] because it's important. You got to watch
[1:23:20] the life. This is what was playing in my
[1:23:23] mind. Then I go to brother Brandham and
[1:23:25] I see his attitude towards people that
[1:23:28] were in the same condition.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; The women in this ain't asylum who
[1:23:33] thinks all hope is lost. Her flesh
[1:23:35] accuses her because of the sins she
[1:23:37] made. All the things she did.
[1:23:41] Yet he be he was Jesus to her.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Restored her.
[1:23:50] I want that to be me.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to see fault
[1:23:58] and dwell on it.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see fault and add fuel
[1:24:04] to the fire.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I want to live the life of Christ.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Help my brother.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Pray for my brother.
[1:24:14] Hey, you know you you want to spread
[1:24:17] that stuff. If you really love them,
[1:24:19] you'd pray for them.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; It doesn't do you no good to tell me his
[1:24:24] faults.
[1:24:26] Why add that image to your brother, to
[1:24:29] your sister,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; of what someone else did, the fault they
[1:24:33] had. If you loved them, you'd pray for
[1:24:36] them.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't share it. You wouldn't
[1:24:39] continue to add fuel to that fire.
[1:24:44] Then it brought me to another one, the
[1:24:46] woman at the well. Let's remember in the
[1:24:49] first example, they brought someone to
[1:24:52] him.
[1:24:54] This is now Jesus having the burden.
[1:24:58] Brother Brandham shows us in the story
[1:25:00] of the woman at the well. He said the
[1:25:01] Lord said, I have need to go by Samaria.
[1:25:06] He had a need
[1:25:09] to go and restore someone. That's why he
[1:25:12] went. It struck me. It says he was weary
[1:25:17] after the long journey, he was tired.
[1:25:21] Yet, it was that time that he had to do
[1:25:24] something for God. I wonder how many
[1:25:27] times after a long day of work,
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; we say, "All my opportunity to be Jesus
[1:25:33] to somebody has ran out.
[1:25:36] Now it's time for me to rest. I am
[1:25:38] tired. I've done so much. Don't you know
[1:25:41] how busy I am? I've got to spend time
[1:25:45] with my family.
[1:25:47] I've got to do this. I've got to do
[1:25:49] that. We got all the excuses in the
[1:25:51] book.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; But there's no time slot for being Jesus
[1:25:57] to someone. Always be aware of the
[1:26:01] opportunity that presents itself to shed
[1:26:03] the light and the life of Christ.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; You want to be an example at all times,
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; not just when you're out at work because
[1:26:12] if you're not careful, you will miss the
[1:26:15] opportunities to be Jesus in your own
[1:26:17] household
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; because you're tired,
[1:26:21] you're exhausted. This is home. This is
[1:26:24] where my brain shuts down. I don't want
[1:26:27] to deal with anything else. That wasn't
[1:26:29] Jesus's attitude.
[1:26:32] Though he was weary,
[1:26:34] he had work to do.
[1:26:36] I must be about my father's business.
[1:26:41] He says, "When therefore John 4, when
[1:26:43] therefore the Lord knew how the
[1:26:44] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[1:26:46] baptized more disciples than John,
[1:26:48] though Jesus himself baptized not but
[1:26:50] his disciples, he left Judea and
[1:26:53] departed again unto Galilee. and he must
[1:26:56] needs to go through Samaria. Then cometh
[1:26:58] he to the city of Samaria, which is
[1:27:00] called Cyra, near to the parcel of
[1:27:03] ground that Jacob gave to his son
[1:27:05] Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there.
[1:27:09] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[1:27:11] journey, sat thus
[1:27:14] on the well, and it was about the sixth
[1:27:16] hour. There cometh the woman of Samaria
[1:27:18] to draw water. Jesus said unto her,
[1:27:21] "Give me to drink." for his disciples
[1:27:24] were gone away unto the city to buy me.
[1:27:27] Then saith the woman of Samaria unto
[1:27:29] him, How is it that thou being a Jew
[1:27:31] askketh drink of me,
[1:27:34] which I'm a woman of Samaria? For the
[1:27:36] Jews have no dealings with the
[1:27:38] Samaritans. Here we are again with
[1:27:40] traditions and customs. Jesus answered
[1:27:42] and said unto her, If thou kneest the
[1:27:44] gift of God, and who it is that say to
[1:27:47] thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest
[1:27:49] have asked of him, and he would have
[1:27:50] given thee living water. The woman said
[1:27:52] unto him, "Sir, thou has nothing to draw
[1:27:55] with, and the well is deep. From whence
[1:27:57] then hast thou that living water? Art
[1:27:59] thou greater than our father Jacob,
[1:28:01] which gave us well, and drank thereof
[1:28:04] himself, and the children and his
[1:28:06] cattle?" Jesus answered, said unto her,
[1:28:08] "Whosoever drinkketh of the water shall
[1:28:11] th of of this water shall thirst again.
[1:28:13] But whosoever drinkketh of the water
[1:28:15] that I give shall give him shall never
[1:28:17] thirst. But the water that I shall give
[1:28:19] him shall be in him a well of water
[1:28:23] springing up into everlasting life.
[1:28:27] You become the well when you drink of
[1:28:30] the well.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; That's a part of the commission. You got
[1:28:34] to drink.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; So when somebody else is thirsty,
[1:28:38] somebody else needs a drawing from that
[1:28:40] well of everlasting life. You're a
[1:28:43] source of water to them.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; You, we have a pivotal role to play.
[1:28:51] We cannot squander this responsibility
[1:28:54] to be sons. There's a mission at hand.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; There's a war going on. Look at the
[1:29:01] state of our nation.
[1:29:04] Spiritual warfare is rampant.
[1:29:07] We can't have lazy soldiers.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the soldier is not the
[1:29:12] minister.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; It's the believer.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; You're the soldier.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; The battlefield is everywhere.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It's in your mind.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; It's at work. It's at school.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; At home.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; There's you. There's no resting from the
[1:29:29] war. If you're not guarded and ready,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; catch what's going on. Don't let your
[1:29:36] guards down.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Be ready at all times.
[1:29:41] That's the kind of life Jesus had. They
[1:29:44] tried to throw this and that and this
[1:29:46] and that to try to stumble him
[1:29:50] to try to throw a shadow over what he
[1:29:52] was doing. But it failed every time.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Why? He was the very word.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It should be the same with you. Why?
[1:30:03] Because you are the very word. Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; What was said of him, he fulfilled and
[1:30:08] believed 100%. What was said of you, you
[1:30:12] ought to fulfill and believe 100%. If
[1:30:14] nothing stood before him, nothing should
[1:30:17] stand against you.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; You and him are one.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; All power that was given to him is given
[1:30:24] unto you.
[1:30:31] The the the last example that came to me
[1:30:34] was the woman with the alabaster box.
[1:30:37] The first example,
[1:30:40] they brought someone to him to be the
[1:30:42] judge.
[1:30:44] The second example, he had need to go
[1:30:46] save somebody
[1:30:48] to go add a soul. And once he did, she
[1:30:52] became a living well because she ran out
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; testifying of the water she just took
[1:30:58] drink of.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I Your testimony is so important.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Never stop sharing your testimony.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; If you want the quickest way to kill the
[1:31:11] joy in your life is to stop talking
[1:31:13] about what he did for you.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That is the for sure way to kill the joy
[1:31:18] of your salvation. stop sharing. But if
[1:31:21] you've lost it and you want to gain back
[1:31:24] the joy of your salvation, start telling
[1:31:27] people how your candle got lit, what he
[1:31:30] did for you.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Something just begins to well up.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Living waters, it begins to well up and
[1:31:37] it flows.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; They can see that a thirst comes and
[1:31:42] says, "Wow, if God could do that for him
[1:31:44] in that condition, in that circumstance,
[1:31:46] how much more me? Can there be God for
[1:31:48] me?" Yes, there can. No, but I've done
[1:31:50] so much you don't understand, brother.
[1:31:52] It doesn't matter. There still can be
[1:31:54] God for you.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I've been an atheist my whole life. It
[1:31:58] don't matter. There's still God for you.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Give me the circumstance. The well is
[1:32:05] there to f to to quench that thirst.
[1:32:08] Regardless of what it is, the
[1:32:10] everlasting well is everlasting.
[1:32:15] In this example, she comes to him.
[1:32:20] See, it's easy to have people brought to
[1:32:22] us and we're given the opportunity to
[1:32:25] either be Jesus to them
[1:32:28] or to just judge them.
[1:32:31] And at other times we meet people
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; and because we've been desensitized to
[1:32:37] being sensitive to the voice, the still
[1:32:39] small voice, we miss the opportunities
[1:32:42] to have moments like the woman at the
[1:32:44] well
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; to go and do the work. An example that
[1:32:48] struck me what happened with brother
[1:32:50] Paul.
[1:32:53] Something spoke in him, I got to go pray
[1:32:55] for that little girl.
[1:32:57] And because an action came behind it, it
[1:33:00] wasn't just the burden, but an action
[1:33:03] followed. And because the action
[1:33:05] followed the burden, the miracle came on
[1:33:08] the scene.
[1:33:10] Sometimes God puts someone on your mind.
[1:33:12] Pray for this person. Reach out to this
[1:33:14] person. See how they're doing. And you
[1:33:17] just
[1:33:19] no,
[1:33:21] I'm busy.
[1:33:22] And you miss the opportunity to be Jesus
[1:33:24] to somebody.
[1:33:27] I I I will never forget it. I was
[1:33:30] working with brother Tommy somewhere in
[1:33:32] uh
[1:33:33] I I believe we were in in in a uh
[1:33:36] Lewisville doing a job and we went into
[1:33:40] a uh burger spot and I saw this blind
[1:33:44] man. He wasn't just blind, he had no
[1:33:47] eyes.
[1:33:50] What a sight.
[1:33:52] and something bubbled up in me.
[1:33:56] Go and pray for him.
[1:33:59] I said, "No, Lord, it can't be me."
[1:34:03] I know. I've heard the story of Brother
[1:34:04] Brandon praying for that little girl.
[1:34:08] And the eyes come down
[1:34:10] and he said, "Oh, sorry, Brother Brandon
[1:34:12] made a mistake. What color eyes do you
[1:34:14] want?"
[1:34:18] And it was given to her. I see. I had
[1:34:21] attributed that only to a prophet,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; not to a son.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; So here, the Lord's put the desire in my
[1:34:27] heart to pray for this person that's got
[1:34:29] no eyes. And his his father must have
[1:34:32] been in his 80s with a cane watching
[1:34:35] over his little boy that was maybe in
[1:34:38] his 30s.
[1:34:41] And yet, I didn't listen to that voice.
[1:34:45] I missed an opportunity. I'm not sitting
[1:34:48] here telling you my prayer would have
[1:34:50] given him eyes. That's not what I'm
[1:34:52] telling you. What I'm telling you is God
[1:34:55] was trying to transmit orders to me and
[1:34:58] I disobeyed the order. Do you know what
[1:35:01] happens in the military
[1:35:03] when your bosses give you orders and you
[1:35:05] don't obey? You get discharged.
[1:35:09] You're not fit to be in the military if
[1:35:11] you do not know how to obey orders.
[1:35:14] If we're not careful, God gives you
[1:35:16] order after order after order after
[1:35:19] order, and you deny every single one of
[1:35:22] them. Then we have the audacity to say,
[1:35:25] "Where are the miracles?
[1:35:28] Where is the God of Elijah?
[1:35:31] I know he said divine healing is still
[1:35:33] real, but Father, I haven't seen it in a
[1:35:36] while. I know he said saving deliverance
[1:35:40] is real, but because we're denying
[1:35:42] orders.
[1:35:45] I I'm not here just to work, try to make
[1:35:49] a living, pay bills, that's that's not
[1:35:52] what we're here for.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; We've got a job to do. We've got orders
[1:35:57] to fulfill. Go ye into all the world.
[1:36:01] Preach the gospel.
[1:36:03] Be Jesus to somebody.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Show the life. Be salty. These are our
[1:36:09] orders. These signs shall follow them
[1:36:12] that believe.
[1:36:14] Imagine what would have happened if
[1:36:16] Peter and them would have missed blind
[1:36:19] Barnameus.
[1:36:22] What would have happened? They couldn't
[1:36:24] have said, "Silver and gold have none.
[1:36:28] Oh no, we've been endued with power.
[1:36:30] That's all. We're just going to sit down
[1:36:31] and do nothing."
[1:36:33] That wouldn't work because the
[1:36:35] commission he gave them
[1:36:38] was to be endued with power and do the
[1:36:40] work. It's the same with us.
[1:36:44] He gives us power to do the work.
[1:36:48] You got to be honest with yourself. I
[1:36:50] got honest, Ben. You're lazy.
[1:36:53] You're You squander your responsibility.
[1:36:57] You got a part to play. Yes.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Don't pat yourself on the back for
[1:37:02] praying in the morning and reading your
[1:37:03] Bible and that's all you did.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; That's your duty. You're supposed to do
[1:37:09] that.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You don't get a a medal for doing your
[1:37:13] due diligence. Do what you're supposed
[1:37:16] to feed every day. But you're feeding
[1:37:18] for a purpose
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; to become the word so you can give the
[1:37:22] word.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; But if you're just feeding and hoarding,
[1:37:25] you're selfish.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. You're just eat and you
[1:37:30] never give anybody.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You got to share.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; God does something for you. Tell
[1:37:37] somebody.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Tell that coworker that doesn't like
[1:37:40] you. Hey man, you know the Lord did
[1:37:42] something for me. He might he might look
[1:37:43] at you like, "Why is this guy talking to
[1:37:45] me?"
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Share.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You never know.
[1:37:50] It might strike something in him that
[1:37:53] somebody else will reach out to him and
[1:37:55] say something to him and then somebody
[1:37:57] else. You don't know how God's soldiers
[1:38:00] are intertwined.
[1:38:03] You might meet somebody and say
[1:38:05] something and somehow they end up
[1:38:07] meeting somebody else that's a believer
[1:38:08] at this church and says something to
[1:38:10] them and gets them into the house of the
[1:38:12] Lord.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And not just the house, but gets them to
[1:38:16] him.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what brother Brandham said.
[1:38:20] He said, "All these men were bringing
[1:38:22] people to church, but they weren't
[1:38:24] leading them to Christ. They weren't
[1:38:26] leading them all the way.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; They had to meet the person. Get a hold
[1:38:31] of the person."
[1:38:35] Brother Brandham, the the scripture says
[1:38:37] in Luke, "And one of the Pharisees
[1:38:40] desired him that he would eat with him.
[1:38:42] And he went into the Pharisees house and
[1:38:44] sat down to meet. And behold, a woman in
[1:38:46] the city which was a sinner when she
[1:38:48] knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
[1:38:51] Pharisees house and brother Brandham
[1:38:53] kind of expands on this story. We we I
[1:38:55] thank God for a prophet. I really do
[1:38:57] because brother Brandham said this
[1:38:59] Pharisee invited him to set a trap.
[1:39:02] This wasn't a oh I just want you to come
[1:39:05] and spend. No, this was a trap that he
[1:39:07] tried to set for Jesus. And and when
[1:39:10] that woman with the alabaster box came
[1:39:12] and all of them knew who she was, he
[1:39:16] was, "Oh, this is gonna be good. We
[1:39:19] gonna get him now."
[1:39:22] And Jesus just sits there,
[1:39:25] lets her tears wash his feet,
[1:39:29] puts oil on him, and kisses him.
[1:39:33] Look at the attitude of Jesus.
[1:39:37] And behold, woman in the city which was
[1:39:39] a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat
[1:39:41] at meet in the Pharisees house, brought
[1:39:43] an alabaster box of ointment, and stood
[1:39:45] at his feet behind him weeping, and
[1:39:48] began to wash his feet with tears, and
[1:39:50] did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:39:51] head, and kissed his feet, and anointed
[1:39:54] them with ointment. Now when the
[1:39:55] Pharisees which had bidden him solid, he
[1:39:58] spake with themselves, saying, "This
[1:40:00] man, if he were a prophet, would have
[1:40:02] known who and what manner of woman
[1:40:05] this is that touchth him, for she is a
[1:40:08] sinner." And Jesus answering unto him,
[1:40:11] Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.
[1:40:14] And he said, Master, say on. There was a
[1:40:17] certain creditor which had two debtors,
[1:40:20] the one owed 500 pence and the other 50.
[1:40:23] and when they had nothing to pay, he
[1:40:25] frankly forgave them both. Tell me,
[1:40:27] therefore, which of them will love him
[1:40:29] most. Simon answered and said, I suppose
[1:40:32] that he to whom he forgave most. He said
[1:40:35] unto him, Thou has rightly judged. And
[1:40:38] he turned to the woman, and said unto
[1:40:40] Simon, Seeest thou this woman?
[1:40:43] I entered into thine house, and thou
[1:40:45] gavest me no water for my feet, but she
[1:40:48] hath washed my feet with tears, and
[1:40:50] wiped them with hairs of her head. Thou
[1:40:52] gavest me no kiss. But this woman, since
[1:40:54] the time I came in, hath not ceased to
[1:40:56] kiss my feet. My head with oil, thou
[1:40:58] didest not anoint. But this woman had
[1:41:00] anointed my feet with ointment.
[1:41:02] Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins
[1:41:04] which are many are forgiven, for she
[1:41:06] loved much. But to whom little is
[1:41:09] forgiven, the same loveth little. And he
[1:41:11] said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
[1:41:14] And they sat at me with him be to say
[1:41:16] within themselves, Who is this that
[1:41:18] forgiveth sins also? And he said unto
[1:41:21] the woman, "Thy faith has saved thee. Go
[1:41:24] in peace." This is his attitude.
[1:41:29] I wonder if we would allow somebody that
[1:41:31] we thought was the worst of the worst
[1:41:33] sinners to do something for us
[1:41:36] and by that be a blessing to them
[1:41:41] or do we just I'm going to distance
[1:41:42] myself completely. I'm not saying go
[1:41:45] into these places. I'm not telling you
[1:41:47] to go to a club. I'm not telling you to
[1:41:50] go I'm not telling you to go in places
[1:41:52] you have no business being.
[1:41:54] But what I'm saying is if somebody is
[1:41:57] brought to you,
[1:42:01] they come to you because they see
[1:42:02] something in you and they want to do a
[1:42:05] service for you. That may be their
[1:42:08] opportunity
[1:42:10] for their sins to be forgiven.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You could be Jesus to them.
[1:42:17] He who has done good to the least of my
[1:42:19] children has done it unto me.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; We have to open our hearts.
[1:42:27] Be more like him.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; I I I want to anchor this with with a
[1:42:32] couple quotes. I won't be much longer
[1:42:34] and we'll close.
[1:42:37] Brother Brandham says
[1:42:40] in uh taking sides with Jesus paragraph
[1:42:42] 130,
[1:42:44] you know, the real Christian way is to
[1:42:46] hide everything you can from a brother.
[1:42:49] Don't tell his bad things. Just tell his
[1:42:52] good things. Just tell what you know
[1:42:54] about him is good. If anything is bad,
[1:42:57] let it alone. Poor fellow has got enough
[1:43:01] against him. Anyhow,
[1:43:03] you see this the attitude of a prophet,
[1:43:07] the attitude of a son,
[1:43:10] they've got enough against them already.
[1:43:13] I I I I really ask myself when I see
[1:43:17] somebody that's really down in sin.
[1:43:20] Am I so quick to judge because I forget
[1:43:23] how much is against them?
[1:43:27] Did I forget what it was that was
[1:43:28] against me before I met him?
[1:43:31] the oppression, how hard it was to do
[1:43:34] right, to live right, to think right.
[1:43:38] Did I forget?
[1:43:42] Am am I no longer sensitive?
[1:43:46] Have I lost patience?
[1:43:49] What's my attitude
[1:43:52] to someone like that? Do I say, "Oh man,
[1:43:55] they've got so much against them already
[1:43:56] as it is. Lord, forgive them." or am I
[1:44:00] man if God was here God would judge
[1:44:02] them.
[1:44:04] That's the kind of life that will send
[1:44:05] you to hell.
[1:44:07] This is things we say out of our mouths
[1:44:08] if you're honest with yourself.
[1:44:13] He says poor fellow has got enough
[1:44:16] against him anyhow. Don't try to take a
[1:44:18] pull and shove a man further into the
[1:44:21] ditch.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; The Christian attitude is pick him up
[1:44:25] and take him out of the ditch. See,
[1:44:28] don't never try to shove him down. He is
[1:44:32] down already.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Try to help him up.
[1:44:38] Some of the attitude we have is when we
[1:44:41] see somebody of of of what we would
[1:44:43] consider value do something wrong, we
[1:44:47] start getting excited that we caught
[1:44:49] them doing something wrong.
[1:44:54] Brother David,
[1:44:57] I got him.
[1:45:01] What?
[1:45:04] You'll hear brother Brandham, Brother
[1:45:06] Brandham say here soon that you're all
[1:45:09] bound to make a mistake.
[1:45:14] The same attitude you have towards
[1:45:16] somebody else, remember what goes around
[1:45:20] comes around. If you have a bad attitude
[1:45:23] towards people,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; if you're always quick to judge,
[1:45:28] don't be mistaken.
[1:45:30] When your time comes, you will see the
[1:45:33] same attitude given back to you.
[1:45:36] You'll realize just how unfair it is
[1:45:41] that a weak moment becomes your
[1:45:43] identity.
[1:45:45] Rather than saying, "Come here, my
[1:45:47] brother. Come here, my sister.
[1:45:50] I I know you've fallen. I know you've
[1:45:52] made an error. Let's pray. We're going
[1:45:56] to get this devil out today.
[1:45:58] We're going to pray till we break
[1:46:00] through.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I want that love in me. That's my
[1:46:04] heart's desire. When I see wrong, come
[1:46:08] on, brother. Let's pray. Let's get this
[1:46:10] out.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I refuse for this to be your identity.
[1:46:14] That's the devil's lie.
[1:46:18] Brother Ram says, "Try to help him." But
[1:46:20] too many of us today, too many people
[1:46:23] today, I might say, try to do that. If
[1:46:26] they could just get something another
[1:46:28] that they could say that was real bad.
[1:46:31] Now, for instance, if one of you
[1:46:33] brethren would make a mistake and do
[1:46:34] something is wrong, which are subject to
[1:46:36] do it.
[1:46:38] I am too.
[1:46:41] Every one of us.
[1:46:43] No one is left here. Every one of us.
[1:46:46] But as we go along, let's remember we
[1:46:49] are brothers.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; We are brothers.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; And if we go, if we got any fighting,
[1:46:57] let's fight with one another.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Bring it together. Bring it before our
[1:47:02] brethren and settle it.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; We got to be better about settling
[1:47:06] things.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; We let things linger.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; You know what it does?
[1:47:20] I'm just going to say it.
[1:47:23] I'm not married yet.
[1:47:35] But um
[1:47:37] the people you love the most
[1:47:41] have the greatest capacity to annoy you.
[1:47:48] the greatest capacity to cause anger out
[1:47:52] of you, to cause frustration.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; My eyes are closed cuz I don't want to
[1:47:56] see your faces.
[1:47:59] But the one you love so much that you
[1:48:02] said, "Honey, I'll love you in the good
[1:48:04] times and the bad times. Through thick
[1:48:08] and thin,
[1:48:10] we'll always be together." and then they
[1:48:12] do something wrong and it's all get away
[1:48:14] from me. I don't want to be next to this
[1:48:16] person.
[1:48:18] Let's just be honest with ourselves.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; This is our attitude.
[1:48:23] You're not my favorite person right now.
[1:48:25] I really don't like you.
[1:48:28] And we let it linger
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; and linger and linger rather than settle
[1:48:34] it. We marinate in whatever it was that
[1:48:38] took place. Right?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; And then next week something else
[1:48:43] happens. Remember what you did last
[1:48:45] week.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; When you settle something,
[1:48:50] this is how Jesus settle something. You
[1:48:52] sin. You make it right. See your
[1:48:54] forgetfulness. That's it.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; I know some of you that have been
[1:49:00] married for years say, "Oh, poor Ben."
[1:49:04] You don't know.
[1:49:06] It's easy to say.
[1:49:09] forgive throw in sea of forgetfulness.
[1:49:11] But the woman, you have to understand,
[1:49:15] she remembers everything.
[1:49:19] She will remind you of that sin you
[1:49:22] committed at 12:01
[1:49:26] a.m.
[1:49:27] June 30th, 1990.
[1:49:32] It wasn't settled.
[1:49:35] We got to get better at settling things.
[1:49:38] If you ask for forgiveness, restore thy
[1:49:41] brethren, restore your husband, restore
[1:49:44] your wife. You've forgiven, right?
[1:49:47] Restore them.
[1:49:49] Don't bring it back up.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; And that's all I'm saying.
[1:49:54] He says, "Bring it together and settle
[1:49:57] it." Now, they used to in the Brandon
[1:49:59] family. Now, I don't advise married
[1:50:01] couples to do this part here because
[1:50:03] this isn't this is interesting. If one
[1:50:05] of the little ones done something, they
[1:50:07] was going to tell Bill about it cuz I
[1:50:09] was the biggest and I had to stand there
[1:50:11] and see which was right and wrong. Well,
[1:50:13] my decision was that if they which was
[1:50:15] right and wrong, if they still didn't
[1:50:17] believe it, then they go around behind
[1:50:19] my back and fought it out.
[1:50:22] But they were still brothers. You see,
[1:50:24] they'd fight in the backyard with one
[1:50:26] another and fight in the front yard for
[1:50:29] one another.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; So that's the way it is. See, and we're
[1:50:33] still brothers.
[1:50:36] How we let things leak out to the front
[1:50:38] yard.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Rather than keeping it in the backyard,
[1:50:42] we want to bring it out for all to see.
[1:50:46] You've you've probably heard the phrase,
[1:50:47] "I'll defend you in public. I'll correct
[1:50:50] it in private."
[1:50:53] That's the believer's attitude. The
[1:50:55] opportunity to correct is not when
[1:50:58] everybody else is throwing the stone.
[1:51:00] That's when you defend.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Billy Paul gave a testimony here
[1:51:05] at the church in 2008 about an argument
[1:51:08] he had with his wife and he was right in
[1:51:11] his story. He says, "I was right." He
[1:51:14] said, "I went to my dad cuz I wanted my
[1:51:16] dad to say, you were right. I told my
[1:51:19] dad what happened. My dad took her
[1:51:21] side."
[1:51:23] He said after she had left, he said,
[1:51:26] "Now, Billy, you know you was wrong."
[1:51:30] And she goes, he goes, "But dad," he
[1:51:32] said, "now I taught you better." I
[1:51:35] believe he said, "No, you know better."
[1:51:38] Ain't that funny? A prophet that knows
[1:51:40] the sins you've committed,
[1:51:43] knows you were right, yet tells you
[1:51:46] you're wrong.
[1:51:52] Well, that's the way we got to do this.
[1:51:54] If you got something against somebody,
[1:51:56] your brother, don't tell somebody else
[1:51:58] about it. If it's wrong, go to him and
[1:52:02] tell him. And then if he's going to
[1:52:04] argue with you, then take somebody else
[1:52:06] with you. Then bring it up the way the
[1:52:08] Bible said.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; But Jesus, they just tried to find every
[1:52:11] little shadow they could to try to
[1:52:14] belittle him in the sight of the people.
[1:52:16] And that's what the devil wants.
[1:52:20] They want to they want to hurt your
[1:52:24] influence before the people.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; That's the way you want this advice.
[1:52:30] That's the way you want to watch careful
[1:52:34] what you do. Yes, sir.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Walk like real men of God. Talk like men
[1:52:39] of God. See, act like men of God. Live
[1:52:43] like men of God. Because the devil, your
[1:52:46] adversary, is going about like a roaring
[1:52:49] lion trying to devour what he can.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; There's so much in here, but I look at
[1:52:56] the time. I'm going to jump to to uh to
[1:52:59] close.
[1:53:11] Let me find it here.
[1:53:23] So, brother Brandham says,
[1:53:30] this is about the woman with the
[1:53:31] alabaster box. He says, "And Jesus sit
[1:53:34] and watched her, never moved the foot
[1:53:36] till she got done." If you're going to
[1:53:38] do something for Jesus, Jesus sat and
[1:53:40] watched you do it sometime. Uh-huh. He
[1:53:43] lets you go ahead till you get finished.
[1:53:45] Then the reward comes. Maybe you run the
[1:53:48] whole race of life working for him. But
[1:53:50] don't worry, there's a reward at the
[1:53:52] end. If you just take your way with his
[1:53:55] side, you might not see one person
[1:53:58] healed
[1:54:01] that you pray for.
[1:54:04] Just keep on praying for them.
[1:54:06] I've often said if I prayed for 500 a
[1:54:10] night, see this this this is good to me
[1:54:13] because it doesn't matter how hard you
[1:54:15] prayed,
[1:54:17] it's not how hard you pray that brings
[1:54:19] the answer. God is sovereign. You might
[1:54:23] pray for the saving of a life and he
[1:54:25] saves it. You might pray for saving of a
[1:54:27] life and he takes it. Either or. It
[1:54:31] doesn't disprove the word.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; It remains the same. Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; His sovereign timing is his business.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; We don't know that. We just make our
[1:54:42] requests known
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; and have faith. What we ask for shall be
[1:54:45] given. But his perfect will gets done in
[1:54:48] the end.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; He says, I've often said, if I prayed
[1:54:52] for 500 a night, all 500 dead in the
[1:54:56] morning, tomorrow night, I'll be
[1:54:57] preaching divine healing and pray for
[1:54:59] the sick. See, don't have one thing to
[1:55:02] do with it. See, he'll let you come
[1:55:04] right down through defeats and
[1:55:07] everything else till you come right down
[1:55:09] to the end of the road and finish your
[1:55:11] work like he led that woman. She wanted
[1:55:14] to do him a service. So, he just held
[1:55:16] his feet out there and let her wash him.
[1:55:19] Oh, if he'd have said, "Don't do that,"
[1:55:21] she'd have jumped and run. But he let
[1:55:24] her do the service. And after she got
[1:55:26] through, finished the service that she
[1:55:28] was going to do, when he looked up, that
[1:55:30] hypocrite standing back there, was
[1:55:32] trying to cast the blackness on his
[1:55:34] name, said, "Simon, I've got something
[1:55:36] to say to you. Not to her, but to you
[1:55:39] standing back there in your heart.
[1:55:41] That's the reason you brought me down
[1:55:43] here. You have no fellowship with me."
[1:55:45] Didn't I know it? But you brought me
[1:55:47] down here and you set me back here to
[1:55:50] make fun of me.
[1:55:53] Let you never give me no water to wash
[1:55:55] my feet. You never give me nothing to
[1:55:58] soothe me. Me sitting here burning and
[1:56:00] hurting. You never give me no oil for my
[1:56:02] face. You was ashamed to kiss me.
[1:56:04] Welcome or shake my hand. See, you was
[1:56:06] ashamed
[1:56:09] to to k You was ashamed before your
[1:56:11] company. You was ashamed to do it. This
[1:56:14] woman, since she has come in, she has
[1:56:16] did nothing but rub my feet and bathe
[1:56:18] them with the very tears of her eyes,
[1:56:20] wiped them with the towel of her own
[1:56:22] hair. Then I'll just show you whether
[1:56:25] I'm a prophet or not. Amen. I like that.
[1:56:29] Now, I want to speak to you just a
[1:56:31] minute. Your sins, which are many, are
[1:56:34] all forgiven. H Did they blight his
[1:56:38] name?
[1:56:39] They thought they had it. They thought
[1:56:41] they had stopped it. They thought they'd
[1:56:44] fixed him so his revival could never be
[1:56:47] in that community. They thought they had
[1:56:49] ruined his influence, but it just taken
[1:56:52] one person,
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; this is us, it just taken one person
[1:56:57] that loved him to turn the whole
[1:56:59] situation
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; who will be Jesus to them. Notice what
[1:57:03] brother Brandham says after this. How do
[1:57:05] you know that you're not that person
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; for your community?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. or somebody that you'll meet.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Take sides with him.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Do him a service.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Do something for him.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Know what I mean, brethren? Take your
[1:57:22] side with Jesus. Take him. Make him your
[1:57:25] choice. Do service for him. Regardless
[1:57:28] of whatever anybody else or you're ever
[1:57:31] repaid or anything, don't make any
[1:57:34] difference. Wait till the work is over.
[1:57:38] How would you like for him to say even
[1:57:40] though you had prayed for sick and and
[1:57:41] they didn't get well though you prayed
[1:57:43] to get to speak with tongues and they
[1:57:44] and you didn't do it you prayed to
[1:57:46] prophesy you didn't do it but yet the
[1:57:48] only thing you can do is tell the story
[1:57:51] of Jesus in your church in your
[1:57:53] community at work you couldn't even do
[1:57:56] one thing didn't lead one person that
[1:57:58] woman didn't lead one to Christ but she
[1:58:00] done a service for him and what
[1:58:02] difference does it make at the end of
[1:58:04] the road if he will say and I say unto
[1:58:06] you all your sins though there not one
[1:58:09] prayer was answered for you but you come
[1:58:12] on the basis of my word. This is the
[1:58:15] importance of coming on the basis of the
[1:58:18] word.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Whether the act is performed or not, so
[1:58:23] long as you come on the basis of the
[1:58:25] word, you're anchored.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; You cannot be moved.
[1:58:29] He says, "But you come on the basis of
[1:58:31] the word. You come because you believed
[1:58:33] me and you did me a service and I say
[1:58:37] that the many sins that you have done is
[1:58:40] all forgiven you." That would be good
[1:58:42] enough for me. Amen. Yes, sir. All
[1:58:47] right. If the musicians would come,
[1:58:53] let's all stand.
[1:58:58] Brother Brandham says they want to say
[1:59:00] the days of miracles are passed and so
[1:59:02] forth. Let them go ahead and say it, but
[1:59:05] let us do the service for the Lord. They
[1:59:08] hated him because they were jealous of
[1:59:10] him. That's the only reason they were
[1:59:12] jealous. They were trying to destroy his
[1:59:15] influence before the people the same as
[1:59:18] they're doing now.
[1:59:22] They if they can just destroy the
[1:59:24] influence of the message before the
[1:59:27] people, then they've got the thing
[1:59:30] whipped. What do you think our pastor's
[1:59:32] been waring against
[1:59:35] when he's talking about getting back to
[1:59:37] the main thing? getting back to the
[1:59:40] original being the message
[1:59:44] because a lot of things is going on in
[1:59:46] this world that's trying to ruin or
[1:59:48] tarnish the influence of the message.
[1:59:52] But the message stands alone. We need
[1:59:55] somebody to take the message and live
[1:59:59] the message. The message isn't the
[2:00:01] problem.
[2:00:03] It's the people.
[2:00:05] You get somebody that fully surrenders
[2:00:07] themsel to the word, to the message of
[2:00:10] the hour, you will see a lived life
[2:00:13] guaranteed
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; because you come on the basis of the
[2:00:17] word.
[2:00:19] My question to you, who will be Jesus to
[2:00:22] them?
[2:00:24] If not you, who?
[2:00:28] Who can fill your shoes?
[2:00:31] We've got work to do. a lot of work to
[2:00:34] do.
[2:00:37] Our focus was swayed.
[2:00:40] We got too busy trying to fix other
[2:00:42] people's problems
[2:00:46] rather than looking for saved souls,
[2:00:49] trying to correct with this brother,
[2:00:51] that brother, this brother, this.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; The word does the correction.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Preach the word.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus still spoke the word. Even after
[2:01:00] what brother Brandham says in this
[2:01:01] sermon, he still preached the word and
[2:01:04] told you what was right and what was
[2:01:06] wrong. He still told you what the life
[2:01:08] was, what the Holy Ghost was. It didn't
[2:01:11] stop him from preaching sound doctrine.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; But what he was trying to tell us is
[2:01:16] what good does it do you to try to
[2:01:19] correct every doctrine and the life
[2:01:21] doesn't follow.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; We've got to watch for one another.
[2:01:29] see the opportunities God gives us to be
[2:01:32] Jesus to somebody.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's what's important.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "I'd rather have
[2:01:37] somebody with the wrong doctrine and the
[2:01:40] right spirit
[2:01:42] than the right doctrine and the wrong
[2:01:44] spirit." Because the right spirit will
[2:01:46] correct the wrong doctrine.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Let's put our focus back to the word,
[2:01:53] back to manifesting the life of Christ
[2:01:56] in us.
[2:01:58] and let's go be Jesus to someone, to
[2:02:02] somebody. Our prophet said, "Who's going
[2:02:04] to reach your community,
[2:02:07] your people, where you go every day?"
[2:02:11] We got to do it. Let's bow our heads.
[2:02:16] Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[2:02:22] my heart is heavy. father
[2:02:26] all the distractions of this world
[2:02:28] trying to figure this and that and this
[2:02:30] and that out and then squandering the
[2:02:33] main thing which is the saving of souls.
[2:02:38] You spoke in that day at Calvary and you
[2:02:41] said the greater works is the saving of
[2:02:43] souls.
[2:02:45] That's what you put us here for Lord
[2:02:47] Jesus.
[2:02:50] freely give and so freely give. Time and
[2:02:52] time again, we can look throughout the
[2:02:54] Bible and see the main thing, the main
[2:02:57] theme was never about miracles. It was
[2:03:02] never about signs and wonders. It was
[2:03:04] always about restoring sons and
[2:03:06] daughters. Since the beginning, we saw
[2:03:10] the example in Adam restoring Eve, a
[2:03:13] perfect type of Jesus. Father, it's
[2:03:16] always been about the saving of souls.
[2:03:20] Lord,
[2:03:22] I ask forgiveness for myself for
[2:03:25] squandering my responsibility and
[2:03:27] getting distracted.
[2:03:30] Lord, I pray
[2:03:32] the fire you lit in me in the beginning.
[2:03:34] Lord Jesus,
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; light it once more. Let it burn twice as
[2:03:40] much as it did the first time. Lord,
[2:03:44] I've got so much I want to do for you,
[2:03:46] Lord,
[2:03:48] but I wanted to move past want to do.
[2:03:51] And as our pastor said, just do it.
[2:03:55] Move into the action. Let the uncction
[2:03:58] of the spirit lead us and guide us. Lord
[2:04:00] Jesus,
[2:04:03] your children have come into your house,
[2:04:05] Lord. Father, if there's anyone here
[2:04:10] that says,
[2:04:12] "Brother Ben,
[2:04:15] I want to be Jesus to somebody."
[2:04:19] That's what my commission is, to be
[2:04:21] Jesus to somebody. And And I've gotten
[2:04:24] distracted, too. I've swayed away.
[2:04:30] You know, I I I haven't really done a
[2:04:32] good job of covering one another.
[2:04:36] I've gossiped a lot.
[2:04:40] I shared too much
[2:04:43] when I should have when I should have
[2:04:45] killed it when it got to me.
[2:04:48] If you could be honest with yourself,
[2:04:51] my eyes are closed. I can't see. I don't
[2:04:54] want to see.
[2:04:56] But if you lift your hands to him and
[2:05:00] you say, "Brother Ben,
[2:05:04] I need him to come back in my life."
[2:05:08] Make aresh in me his life.
[2:05:12] If that's your honest desire, lift up
[2:05:14] your hands.
[2:05:17] Lord, you see the hands that are raised
[2:05:19] in the building. I don't see it.
[2:05:23] You never asked for me to see it. It's
[2:05:26] your business, Lord. You see the honest
[2:05:29] hearts. It's in moments like these our
[2:05:32] prophet would say, a voice would speak
[2:05:34] to you and say, "Don't raise your hand.
[2:05:38] Somebody might see that you have need."
[2:05:41] But then God would come and say, "How
[2:05:44] how else will I know if you don't lift
[2:05:45] your hands?" Though he knoweth all
[2:05:48] things, he loves to see action.
[2:05:51] If there's a voice speaking to you
[2:05:54] saying, "I can't lift my hands and let
[2:05:56] them know, you know, I'm a minister.
[2:05:59] If if my hands are lifted, then what are
[2:06:02] they going to think of me?"
[2:06:05] The hour is too far gone to care about
[2:06:07] status.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; We need true surrendered hearts, true
[2:06:12] soldiers aligned with the word, with one
[2:06:15] job in one accord to save souls. Let's
[2:06:19] tear down our prestige.
[2:06:22] We have none but thee. We're all equal
[2:06:26] in your eyes, Lord Jesus. Father, if
[2:06:28] anyone needs you, it's me, Lord. I need
[2:06:32] you. I need to be more like you, Father.
[2:06:35] I need to keep your name on my lips
[2:06:38] more, Lord Jesus. It's not good enough
[2:06:40] that only those in church know what I
[2:06:42] believe, Father. But I ought to be able
[2:06:45] to speak your word to all those that I
[2:06:47] see. If I see a need to be able to
[2:06:51] minister to the need, Lord,
[2:06:53] I don't want to miss another
[2:06:55] opportunity, Lord, though it be physical
[2:06:57] blindness or a spiritual blindness. I
[2:07:00] don't want to miss an opportunity to
[2:07:01] open someone's eyes, Lord Jesus, by
[2:07:04] showing him you, Lord. If I could be the
[2:07:07] vessel you use to transmit healing,
[2:07:09] Lord, deliverance, whatever you desire,
[2:07:13] Lord, I I'm just a vessel. You use how
[2:07:15] you see fit, Father.
[2:07:18] But if all I do is just share the good
[2:07:21] news of Jesus, Father, I want to
[2:07:23] faithfully share the good news of Jesus.
[2:07:26] If not one miracle ever comes of me,
[2:07:28] Father,
[2:07:29] Lord, I pray that I I could be
[2:07:31] faithfully found in sharing you, Lord.
[2:07:35] We need you in this hour. Lord,
[2:07:39] touch your people. Father,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; be with each and every single one of us,
[2:07:45] Lord. We ask this in Jesus precious
[2:07:48] name.
[2:07:50] Amen.
[2:07:58] Invite our our pastor. Let's sing this
[2:08:02] song.
[2:08:05] Can you help me sing?
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; I really
[2:08:11] want to see

[2:09:09] need to be Jesus for ourselves,
