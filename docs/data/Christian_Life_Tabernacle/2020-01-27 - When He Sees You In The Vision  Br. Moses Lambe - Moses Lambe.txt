Description:
When He Sees You In The Vision
Br. Moses Lambe
Wednesday Evening Service: January 27,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas.

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

blood of jesus because you said jehovah of the old was jesus of the new so we're thankful tonight lord that we can come under the shadow of the almighty we can gather together pour out our hearts to you lord and ask lord that you be in our midst and expect you to do something for us tonight lord lord when this many of the of your children get together lord there's little licks of fire coming

water of these these songs that lord we sing from our hearts and pour out our our needs and our cares to you and when the word comes forth lord we say amen amen so be it and lord be it unto us what

your blessings upon us we ask these things in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ amen sister linsley's got a testimony she wants to come at this time you may have your sins god bless you god bless you i'd like to give two testimonies first to give god all the praise and the glory secondly the testimonies are because two other people gave their testimonies so may this be an encouragement for us to share our testimonies no matter how big or small they may be you don't know whose life they may change about 15 years ago i backslid i moved out of my parents home and did my own thing for a few years during this time my grandpa had a dream he had a dream that i had died in a red car during that time i had gotten a red car not that long ago brother moses ministered here he shared a testimony about a brother who called him one evening all upset because his wife had a dream that brother moses died immediately the lord comforted brother moses brother moses proceeded to tell him that he couldn't die because he had already died he died to the world a long time ago he told the brother good night and went on to have a peaceful rest that night with no fear of his life being in danger right away the lord quickened to me my grandpa's dream and how the family and i have lived with a little fear in the back of our minds that getting into a red vehicle which i definitely avoided at all possible i'm sorry back then after a few years in the world the lord gave me the opportunity to get out of the life of sin i was living in and i knew in my heart it was time one of the very last things i did before leaving was get rid of the red car i was driving i believe in my grandpa's dream the red car was a symbol that i was headed to a spiritual death and getting rid of it was the end to dying of that life to rededicate my life and live a life for god after service i shared this with my husband and we both agreed we shared this i'm sorry we were just so thankful to the lord for this burden lift that i have carried for so long for so many years to be completely lifted the very next day we were picking up an suv rental for a long road trip we were taking normally where we would go you can choose your own vehicle but this time we chose to go with a different place because of their pricing when we arrived the guy only had one vehicle left and we picked up our keys walked out and it was a red suv by the grace of god we had a wonderful trip without any worries or anything all right if you don't mind i have one other one okay my second testimony comes from this past sunday evening first i'd like to thank the lord jesus for healing my husband and i from the awful combat demon this past sunday was our first sunday back to church by the grace of god and we are both doing wonderfully with many side symptoms left over such as still regaining our taste and smell and such but one symptom i was most alarmed about was some pain i had in my lungs right between the transition from exhaling to inhaling brother david junior opened up the service saying he was an expectation for the lord to do something that night i was grateful and because it shifted my mindset and i truly was looking for something to happen not sure i just something sunday night sister sarah gordon gave a testimony of how the lord healed her lungs from hurting whenever she coughed and she tried to go singing now i'm not going to sing you all know my husband does that even though my symptoms wasn't exactly the same i held on to her testimony for the lord to heal my lungs i went through the rest of the service not feeling much different even a few times having to remind myself to take a deep breath but i kept on believing when we got to the end and we were singing songs of worship i sang to the lord with a deeper sincerity that only the lord would have given me i thought maybe this was it but this time it was truly just all worshiping the lord after we got home that evening i went to text sister sarah this is what i said i appreciate your testimony about your lungs thank you so much for sharing i'm believing and have accepted my healing for my lungs as i typed the last part my lungs felt different i continued on typing another line something about i'm just waiting for my lungs to catch up to the faith or something like that but before i sent it i paused because i knew something was different i had taken some short breaths over and over because i wasn't sure if the pain really was gone or if i was just imagining it but i went ahead and deleted that last line and i sent it and i kept taking a bunch of breasts and i was not imagining it quickly my eyes filled with tears i got up and went around the corner to where randy was cooking up some eggs i believe and if you know anything about him he enjoys being in the kitchen i came around the corner and said randy with my eye my tear-filled eyes tapping on my lungs i was afraid to say anything and he just looks at me and asks can you breathe better and i just nodded my head and said i believe the lord just healed my lungs we just thanked the lord and went on i just couldn't believe it i wasn't doing anything special just simply sitting there sending a text but what i do know is i truly believe believed what i said you can imagine much to my amazement when i woke the next morning i still had no pain and by the grace of god i still have no pain thank you lord jesus for your deliverance and your divine healing power that is still working god bless you [Applause] amen let's just sing that song this evening when the when the redeemed or gathering in amen kfc i am thinking of a rapture [Music] our gallery [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] like

[Applause] jesus [Music] by his name to be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] so then to me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh let's just pray mighty and never leaving god we thank you because you've not changed god [Music] your people have gathered tonight and that's the cry of their heart that they'll rather have jesus than anything else that the world can afford lord as we lift up our hearts lord may they may be to you a sweet smelling perfume father but we thank you because you are faithful to your word you said that where two or three would gather in your name that you would come so in the name of jesus we just surrender our beings to you lord and that for the glory of your mighty name we can leave from here saying that our hearts not burn within us while you speak to us father we just thank you lord i'm just a man your prophet said to open the pages of the bible it just requires a human hand or a muscle but for the holy spirit to interpret it he's the only one that can do that lord so take control of our beings and our minds anoint our hearts our ears to listen to the voice of the spirit of god and lord give us something in our hearts so we can leave better christians we thank you for this wonderful opportunity and we recommend all things into your hands those faithful hands that have never failed the hands of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you tonight saints while we're standing we'll just read the scripture it's a blessing to be in the house of god one more time aren't you happy amen may god bless you tonight let's just open our bibles in the book of isaiah chapter 55 and we're going to read from verse 8 to verse 11 isaiah chapter 55 from verse 8 to verse 11. that's what the word of god says he says for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not heather but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it lord anointed bless your word in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated as we it's such a blessing to be in the house of the lord you know it's different when you're sitting down down there you know and it's different when you're standing up up here but i'm thankful to god because he helped me one day understand how this is i was in oklahoma and i had to translate for a brother and i was very nervous i said brother i i don't feel comfortable i just feel nervous because it's the word of god your feet get to shake and you start having the butterflies in your stomach and but while he was standing there about to preach something told me if he doesn't speak you don't speak so why are you worried and i thought about it i said why have i been so upset and worried for nothing if that brother doesn't speak i don't have to say anything so i can just stand here anyway they're not going to blame me but if he speaks and i have to say what he says he said but what is it like when we yield to the spirit of god if he doesn't speak i don't have to say anything amen so i have peace of mind to know that i can say let's read the word and we go home if he doesn't say anything i don't have to say anything because i cannot make up something just because i'm here but when i learn that it's all because the spirit of god is willing to speak to a child of god and i'm just a vessel a channel that he wants to use then i get quiet and i relax and i have peace because it's not my duty it's the duty of the holy spirit one day i had to come to church here about eight or nine years ago and i was in wichita falls i didn't have any money to put gas in my car but it was a sunday morning and i wanted to come to church because the whole night i was thinking how i'm going to be in church sunday morning but i said i don't have any money so i woke up that morning and i said well i'll just stay home i read the scripture my heart was just trouble i started turning on the bed and walking in the room i said lord i so i went to the bathroom and i dressed up and i said i'm going to go to church somewhere i say it doesn't matter where i go and i i dressed up i wore my shirt my pants put my tie on i was walking down the street but right before i made a left of my apartment there was a man sitting there smoking and someone said stop and have church without man i said no how am i gonna waste a whole sunday morning sitting down with this guy who's smoking in front of his porch anyway i know i better go to church and i started walking away from him something said go to church with that guy i said lord i want to waste the whole morning like this i just go back and i turn around i went to the guy i said how you do it so when he saw me i had my bible in my hand he'd just flip your cigarette turn it off and put it under his foot i said how are you doing he said well i'm not a bad man i said i haven't said anything well he still had that little puff coming out of his mouth so he kind of blew it far away pretty quick saying you know i used to go to church before i said i haven't said anything but you know the man in his own self knew he was doing something wrong i hadn't spoken anything yet but because he knows what the word of god says and i was holding the bible in my hand i hadn't spoken the word and something within him started talking to him and so he invited me and he said come on seven maybe we started talking he said you know i used to go to church before and i had experiences with the lord and something happened and i just kind of walked away you know and one thing led to another and i started drinking i started smoking said but i love the lord jesus he said you might come into my house tomorrow i say oh yeah i'm coming tomorrow so we started being friends i started visiting him and one day i come there he's cooking he said i'm cooking just for you he said there's been some people come here trying to preach to me and jehovah witness and everything say but i don't like those people i say hey i'm not trying to say hate somebody now i just want to come visit i don't know if you i'm different or anything is that there's something different about you i said okay then he goes around where he smokes you know where to turn put your ass your ass straight right beside the ashtray was this thing he said well i want to he took it off he started dusting it like this he said i want you to use this and put in your bible when i took a hold of it i said what i smelled it oh my goodness i couldn't even stand it i said okay i just took it i didn't say anything you know but if my mother said there's not a day in the world i'm putting that thing in my bible because it smells like cigarette it's all dirty never am i gonna put that in my bible but i took it i went home and one day i was reading and i didn't find nothing to put in my bible and i stuck it there and i forgot it and i started switching pages and switching pages and then one day it just hit me oh that thing is in your bible i said man let me go grab it out so i went real quick and i took it out i said oh my god i put this it wasn't smelling anymore and i smelled it again i said i wasn't smelling anymore and something hit me right there if you stay in the word of god whether you want it or not unconsciously the word of god begins to work on you brother peter was walking with jesus and he didn't know that jesus was transforming him little by little to the point where his rough language and way of speaking was changing and he didn't even know it and one day when he got to where they asked him were you not with him oh no i was not with that guy hmm then he went somewhere else and i asked him again were you not with that guy he said no then i said but you speak like one of them so how did they speak they had a particular way of speaking hallelujah the change was already happening because he was hanging around to change our lives and he didn't even realize the way he was speaking had changed he took somebody else to see that so tonight while you're sitting in the presence of the word of god be conscious that this world has power to change you this world has power to come where you are and meet you at the point of your need oh for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord not a man for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts we have to go into that before we proceed amen as long as it's way over there is the thought of god as long as it's way out there we don't have access to it so it requires somebody to go up into that atmosphere and to catch the thought of god and then he has to come all the way down here again and give that thought to us but god is wanting to influence the happenings of the earth and being up there he has to do something but he put a law and said god cannot do anything on the earth without first revealing his secrets to his servants the prophets so the prophet can cast the thought of god hallelujah and bring it down to us so if you want to know what god is wanting to do on the earth you have to locate the prophet of god and he can tell you what the invisible god is trying to do on the earth how we follow it he's still way out there but somebody has access to it and it brings it down to you because god wants you to know what he's wanting to do deuteronomy says the secret things belong to the lord but those that are revealed belong to us he belongs to us and to our children so we can do the will of god now how can you do the will of god if you don't know it if it's hidden how would you know it and god's desire is for his will to be known by you and i so he's not a mysterious out there hidden oh far away god he wants to be known by you and i therefore the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not heather but waters the earth and maketh it bring forth and blood that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater he says so shall my word that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return void so all god has to do is to let loose of his word all god has to do is to say one thing to your life because it comes from eternity he cannot return to eternity without fulfilling why god sent it so when you take the whole of the word of god and you hang on your whole life to it hallelujah that word cannot go back without fulfilling exactly why it was sent forth it was a sick person hear the word of god he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your inequity hi let's read it in fact i'm just hallelujah isaiah 53 5. but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity of our peace was upon him and with his tribes we are here i have a grandma and wished our faults i met her many years ago that's having a testimony for another time so when i went to hell my back's hurting my neck's hurting pray for me my and i had to pray for grandma all the time and god healed her every time so one day i said what if i'm not here how she gonna do it so i said grandma what if i'm not here he said i'll call you i said what if you call me and my phone doesn't work should i leave you a voicemail i said what if i don't answer you i'll just wait and i'll call you again she's from kentucky so she's hardheaded i said well grandma i've got to talk to you she said what moses what are you going to tell me i said grandma sit down here you know i'm a nurse she said i know you're a nurse say grandma i want to give you a pee that works every time there's no overdose with this pill and you can take it however you want it he said what's that new pill you're going to show me i said grandma's not a new appeals at godspeed she said what is it i say grandma's isaiah 50 35. she said oh i know it since i was a little girl i said wonderful grandma you knew it but now you've got to use it so i take it in the morning in the afternoon at night let me know how it works so about four or five days she called me oh my mo can you come home i said grandma you took the pill she said hold on i'll take it and i'll call you back i said okay she hung up she never called me back so i called her the next day i said hey grandma how you feeling say oh i'm doing good i thought the pill worked she said oh yeah so grandma's call started dropping she didn't call me for that it was different stuff because you have to be anchored to the word of god in the word of god there's power to bring about what it says he will do and we let it at that but he says his word shall not return void but it will fulfill the purpose for which it's sent and it will prosper in the thing where onto head so if the word of god is somewhere hallelujah you can't expect it to prosper anything way onto its hand because the word of god is not interested to stay in the book the bible does not go to the rapture the cds are not going to the rapture the tape is not going to the rapture who then is going hallelujah we got kind of quiet there for a minute he shall not return to him void let's read another scripture isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14. i'm not very good at giving titles to sermon but as we go we just find one isaiah 7 14 says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel i don't know about you but for the past days i've just been rejoicing in the world i'm sitting there i feel like just jumping through the roof because i can hear god speaking to me and i see how the spirit of god is walking in continuity because you're to say oh is it just the services i will travel to another town for morning service sunday and i'll come sit here sunday night and they are preaching to me the same semen i had sunday morning so you wonder why is he screaming i'm not screaming because i love to scream brother but you are sitting here sunday morning you travel two hours away and they preach to you the same sermon over again and it's not one time it's not two times so do you expect me to just sit back and say oh we're just fine and everything's just cool no because i see the spirit of god leading to something amen and you must follow the leading of the spirit of god and we see him working oh therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel isaiah said over there the thoughts of god they are high over there and his ways are not our ways but now we see him again seeing a vision because this man of all like first peter says they did not prophesy by themselves but they were moved by the holy spirit and they prophesied so isaiah is watching something unfolding and he sees a young lady walking down the road let's say virgin he sees her pregnant oh wow oh then he comes down here and he speaks behold a virgin shall conceive he just caught the thought of god and now he's speaking it amen and that word he speaks then he himself he dies but because the giver of the word was god that word cannot fail and that word cannot return to eternity without fulfilling its purpose on the earth so it slept for a hundred years 200 years hallelujah when he spoke it they say oh i say you've got some little problems there because uh our biology teacher didn't teach us like that in the science class that's not what they said you know you you've got to go through the process but that's not what it is isaiah what are we talking about but the word of god is not to be reasoned it's not to be a calculator it's to be believed how prophecy only believed because all things are possible to them that believe and isaiah spoke the word of god and he continued on and he said baby it's going to happen no no no no no he said please talk the word of god and that was it a hundred years 200 300 400 that word was traveling do you know that that word was even faster than time time had to catch up to it because when god speaks his word it's present tense hallelujah that's why you can start rejoicing when you get a word from god when john ryan came to the prayer line the brother said do you believe you say yeah i believe said god healed you go to your seat he goes sit down he get up he said pastor you said i i see the brother said you said you believe so he wanted to put the revolution on the prophet and they reminded him you are the believer he kind of scratched his head but when he caught it he walked outside he said praise god for healing me came back to the meeting said extra extra praise god for healing me he was still blind he still couldn't see but his friends say i see because the symptoms did not define the word of god he disbelieved his symptoms and he believed the word of god and he began to testify hallelujah i see blind man see look at him praise god i can see and he goes to get the haircut oh we heard you went up there to that meeting over there say oh oh yes i didn't only go to the meeting but god healed me in the meeting and he still blind and god heard him testify of his greatness god heard him in the middle of trial holding on to the word god heard him in the middle of all the laughter in the middle of all the fun in the middle of all he grabbed onto the word said my god is awesome god is awesome god is awesome my god is awesome even though you're blind he's great my god is great my god is great my god is great are you serious he's awesome he's awesome god said oh i can't leave that man like that i've got to come down and all know his faith he said because he's too dead hello to my word watch me bring it to pass and his eyes came open because he believed what was told to him so this world begin to travel over time 700 something years past somebody could have said ah isaiah you prophesied some weird things though how many years passed now are you serious i knew you were always i knew you were wrong isaiah i knew and then when the time of that word arrived when the time for that word to become reality arrived heaven mobilized itself to bring to pass that word because the one that promised is faithful because the one that said it his nature is unfailingness he can never fail he's the very definition of faithfulness so when the time for that word to come become reality came heaven send some messengers say go and look for the participants of this vision i want you to inform them that they are part of this vision the vision only said a virgin shall conceive there was no name yet [Applause] it have no name tag to it yet but when the moment of present tense arrived they begin to call names now they begin to tag names to virgin is no more diversion it's not systematic [Applause] and they have to come and inform sister mary she's part of the vision maybe one day she came to church oh but right they preach about they say oh she said amen to that she go home but she didn't know that amen was going to cost us something when you put your aim into the word of god brother sister you are signing you are saying i endorse this document i endorsed this word of god [Applause] and when she endorsed it hallelujah she began to go home then the angel came to our sister mary you see that vision that isaiah spoke about you see that thing that they've been waiting for for hundreds of years is is you the prophet she didn't question and i love what aaron said the other day is that she didn't question but she wanted to know she wanted to give me preach to me brother amen just just pray to me because we walk by the word of god just tell me what's going to happen said this that shall come to you is the holy spirit himself he will overshadow you he said what and that we shall be born he's called the son of god now she went to church every day and she did not know that she was the one there were many virgins all over the place but she was the one to bring that promise to reality and when she began to hear how this was going to happen she said beat it unto me let what you say happen to me let that your will happen to me as you say it so she let the word of god come in because it's the vision that came looking for her she didn't go looking for the vision it's the vision that came and told her you come here but i'm a bad person bye but but when the vision called for moses hey i can't speak good you know i don't so he begin to preach to god now god let me tell you something i don't know how to speak plus they won't even believe me when i go over there what will i say and god's looking at this man doing all his jumping and drama and say so you mean to tell me that i'm not the omniscient god so you mean to inform me about your status for you mean to teach me about your weaknesses so now i don't know anything and you know everything say my love for you has overridden your weaknesses say i override everything hallelujah say everything that you have mentioned i cancel them all because it's me looking for you and in the vision i saw you it was not somebody else it was you and when mary said breathe unto me i call it to your heart that word say amen itself get into sister mary now i got into her while they were revealing to her her role in the vision they even told her about her cousin she didn't ask for that information but because she was part of the vision they gave her all the details so there are people arguing about the vision over there no when he comes he'll be a military man no when it comes to be a big pastor no when it comes it'll be this and that why in the corner over there god you're telling people you do this you do that this is your role you go here you go there i mean it doesn't take your high knowledge brother it doesn't take how many years sister is the grace of god at least any man should boast it's all the grace of god did mary say oh choose me choose me choose me no why are you here tonight you yourself you got yourself ready you entered your car you drove here what drove you here something in your heart you know you could be making over time you could be doing different things right now but because tonight the vision said you were sitting where you are sitting you were dressed how you were dressed you were oh bro you yourself couldn't help it but you had to come and when the angel goes to pastor zechariah who has been praying for many years says zechariah you're going to have a son his name shall be john and they give him the details i'm kind of old you know and my wife too so we kind of took ourselves off that list we're not on the possible list i'm just trying to make it simple we just no we say so you're preaching all these years and you're praying all this time and when the time comes you're not believing say i've got some children that come to church in expectation i don't want you to preach unbelief to them you're going to be down for a few days no more preaching for zechariah while over there there's a sister she just rejoices and she says oh i've got to go find somebody else that knows about the move of god right now i've got to go and testify to elizabeth now was she physically pregnant physically she was not swollen but she had received the word of god and there's no difference to god between that and the reality and now she began to walk over there to go see her cousin elizabeth she only spoke to elizabeth the baby that was inside sister elizabeth he said hallelujah and she felt oh what is it that the mother of a lord comes to me so she was transmitting life already just by receiving the word of god she was not a spectator no she was a participant in the vision of god one of my brother's friends who's a marine brother obi he told me a story one time we used to be roommates he he had some funny stories he said brother moses when we went to training for the marine corps we had one of the the guys there one of our trainers tried to scare us try to get us kind of afraid so we can go ring the bell and we're in the bellman you quit just so we over there in the training first day he tells us hey boys i've got to tell you all right now i want to make it clear what's the difference between a participant and a spectator he said he told us the chicken and pig story i said brother we'll be shaking the pig story he said yeah let me tell you say he said there was a farm and there was a chicken and a pig and the chicken asked the pig what are we eating for breakfast the pig say i don't know she can say i have an idea let's eat eggs and bacon and the pig oh yeah sounds pretty good i like that there you go i started thinking for a minute i'm gonna be the baker in the he's gonna lay his egg and that's it but i've got to die so we eat the bacon so no let's change the menu because he knew he was going to have to die and he was not ready to die for that chicken to eat bacon that's the difference between a participant and a spectator the chicken was a spectator but the pig was the active participant in the meal because he was gonna be on the plate the chicken just lay the eggs and that's it but think about this it sounds very simple but for us to live something had to die even if you're a vegetarian something had to die for you to live if something doesn't die you don't live so when jesus christ comes on the scene his disciples they loved him but don't forget he was in the mind of god this is the plan of god has been fulfilled so he was fulfilling a vision so now the vision itself was walking and he now begin to call some people hallelujah one day he sees peter by the seashore says you follow me and he began to follow him he didn't preach to peter long sermon brother he just said follow me and that was it peter left everything he was doing he started following him i have decided to follow jesus john james he begins to call them but now why is he calling these people he said in the book of john's i think he's 17 he's praying for them he said father i pray for these that you have given me he said i knew them before the world began so he's just coming to collect the folks he used to be with see come on come on come on come on come on follow me follow me where were they before with him so he's looking for the ones that were with him before and they begin to follow you now while he was healing the people he was awesome they could go anyone say oh do you know my god my master i follow he's a healer of disease weren't you there he can feed people if you're hungry come to my church do you want to be rich oh forget it come here you know he can multiply bread and fish he can heal the sick but they forgot he said the son can do nothing in himself but what he see the father do that doeth the son likewise so everything he was doing was something he had seen everything he was doing was something he had seen when lazarus is sick he still has the fever they call him calm your friend lazarus is sick because it's still possible to eat him come while he's still sick he just has a fever when he looks at the vision lazarus is dead he said no no i'm not going there right now so lazarus dies and they tell him if you had been here lazarus would not have died but the vision said he had to die in the vision he was dead and brought back to life so why would he heal him he will be disrupting the vision so he waits for him to die then he comes on the scene but is he late so when he gets there say lord if you had been here past tense he said no i am the resurrection he said lord i know in the future so she went she rewinded and fast forwarded but she forgot about right now say have i not told you sister say where have you laid him and when they go over there to the tomb brother when they get there he's not shaken up he's not all anxious everybody has tried and while they're crying he said just roll that stone away and when the road was thrown away did he enter there now if you say you're wrong if you say you're right so both ways kind of you kind of write because he entered there in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so when he speaks is there difference between what he says and himself his word and him so he stood there and he sent his word he said lazarus come forth lazarus who was run brother his nose was all the way inside the worms were feasting on his body the worm's head want the worst head how the worms begin to run away his nerves begin to reconnect new heart came down begin to beat his lungs begin to breathe again the prophet said he his word went and cut him took his soul and brought it back to his body he came back to life and he began to come out of the because the word went and looked for him in the vision he had to come out of the grave amen we are going somewhere i don't want to be long where david didn't tell me when to stop it's 8 o'clock my sister warned me she said you preached too long then one day he tells his disciples peter say i'm going to die but after three days i'll come back lord we've told everybody that you're going to be the one then you're going to die no lord you can't die we believe you but we've never seen somebody come back from the dead yet so if you're dying now we know for sure you're going to come back say lord i won't die with you just in case you don't come back i don't have nobody to deal with and jesus rebukes peter and he says away from me get behind me satan what if there was a brother that heard that discussion he just called peter satan whoa and we thought he was the best guy was it peter there was somebody hiding behind peter trying to push peter to do something wrong to stop what the vision of god i see and jesus who's a discerner of the thoughts of the hearts of man could see behind peter that devil so you and i can see when your brother is going wrong against you not your brother there's something that's trying to push him do something wrong to you if you can discern that you become an overcomer you take your brother you cut the devil away and peter said oh lord you can't die no say get behind me you're satan because the vision said he had to die if he didn't die peter would not have life the life that was in him could only come out if he died if the corn of wheat does not die he cannot reproduce and he had to die late on his life so when he goes on the cross and he's there they're all crying and weeping the bible says when he died they went back to their business everybody was sad depressed because nobody had come back from the dead before who would announce his death and come back to life nobody had done it before so even though this was a hard one to swallow it was difficult to accept he was gonna come back to life how are you gonna do this lord and when he dies the bible it he went down to the place where there had been some other believers who had believed him across the ages and they all saw him as he was to them and the prophet said when daniel saw him what did he see he saw him how he had seen him in his day he said when isaiah saw him say oh that's in the air he's the one i told you all about and when death food is stinging him thinking it was over trying to take it out couldn't take it out trying to take it out couldn't take it out say oh what have i done oh what have i done i've lost my sting that's why a christian is not scared of death paul said oh death where's your sting that was this thing used to scare believers is who was it elijah running away when the who killed you tomorrow as you killed prophet saw we're gonna kill you and he was running everywhere they scared everybody with death but the life had come and he himself was gonna take the care of the trouble of death and he's dealt with the question of death once and for all and when he comes back he said don't worry i'm gonna come and i'll dwell inside of you hallelujah i'm gonna leave inside of you so you too can trample over the devil and over our death over hell of all these things and they were waiting for him there waiting and waiting the vision had said by joel and he was gonna do it that he was gonna pour out his spirit in our flesh joel has seen them doing it and he spoke it and while they're sitting there he comes down the pit of fire and begins to spread on one another and when he enters them now the same brother peter who before was running away now he's not running away he's standing up there he said man and brethren here is this this is that which was spoken by joel we are the reality of what joe spoke about we are the manifestation of what joe spoke about because in him was the very one that made the promise and the brother said when he preached that sermon there was three thousand converts he said the devil did not turn on his bed that but one day he was going to pray and while he's going to pray there's somebody there who hasn't walked for many years so over up here to give me some dollars there you know i i heard you y'all have money he said silver and gold have i not but i've got something in the name of the lord jesus rise up and walk what did he have then he had the very god of heaven dwelling within his soul and now he was manifesting the very life of him whom he used to accompany now he was no more a spectator now he was a participant the prophet narrates two visions we're going to speak about before we close he said god sent him to colorado to go and pray for somebody and he sees a vision where there's a man in a grey car who's a doctor leaving a house and then he sees the mama at the door crying because the doctor has said he couldn't do anything else for the baby he said but he sees a lady with a brown coat who takes his hat and puts it on the bed then there comes another lady with a red coat who takes the hat and puts it on the tv at the moment she put the hat on the tv he said he was there and that was the time to pray for the baby so he goes to colorado and he's walking in the street as he walked on the street he said he heard a clunk clunk oh my god and he looks around he sees a man with a gray car and he says that's the vision now he's seeing the vision life he said and he goes to the man asked him are you a doc let me just read it can i can we read it oh god okay here it is oh lord okay for instance here some time ago i was near denver colorado where it was there was a man that was sitting in a wheelchair and a mystic affair came out in the paper i was praying he sent me over there to pray for a baby and the same day i seen a vision of this baby where the little little doctor came out of a place and they had a forward little gray forward and he had this i went up and as i opened the gate to go in there was one of these old holes hanging beside the gate and i went in the lady met me at the door and she took my hat and laid on the bed there was a lady come with a red sweater and on and sat down and the baby was dying and then another lady come in down with the brown coat and taking my hat laid it on the television and i went over and put my hand on the baby and i looked in here and he stood by my side the baby got well okay said not long after that three or four days after the vision well i called to a place in colorado to a man had tb and i went to pray for him something told me to go over and pray for him and i got to the plane and went over and after praying for that that man i don't know what ever happened to him i was waiting for the plane and i said i just i he i just felt like i want to walk and i was walking down this street going along and i seen a doctor with a gray suit on packing a little i thought that fellow looks familiar to me because he has seen that fella somewhere before and i i look little said a little gray forward i said it's a vision that's what come to me the other day see and i seen i said i'll i'll watch him he come out i said how'd he do he spoke got in a car very polite i looked laying behind the gate and they lay that hole i said this is it i went to the door knocked on the door and the lady come to the door with the red sweater on i said how do you do and she said how'd he do and i said i'm a minister of the gospel have you sickness she said a baby i said his leg i said he's laying in the bed to the left as you go in the door describe how she said where is your parish i said the world is my parish i said my name is branham she never heard of me i said may i have a prayer for your baby she said you may sir she said we are christians here i stepped in she took my hat and laid it on the bed now the other lady with the brown coat hadn't come in here so i waited an hour hallelujah so he sat there waiting an hour if i was that mama i'd be like what are you doing here waiting now i don't know you first of all you come to my house asking for a sick baby and you sit in there for an hour who are you again so i waited for hour the lady wondered what all the waiting about it was an hour the lady had not come in yet and while when she come in she sat down in the place where the lady with the red sweater on was supposed to be sitting so that wasn't right and my heart was still on the bed i couldn't tell them so who could tell them hallelujah the prophet can't tell them what the wrong was he can't tell them what to do he said i couldn't tell them but they had to do it how the angel of the lord wasn't there yet that was a sign to me went to pray and they was working with the baby after a while the lady picked up my hat and laid on the radio on the television then i walked over to the bed and said thou said the lord the baby will leave started reaching out for his mother and taking the courage off of him that was it while they were weeping i slipped out the door they never knew who i was nothing about it next one i was going down the street i thought i heard some squeaking it was a wheelchair i was going right along in front of me and it was a man in a wheelchair with a bible crying and i seen him going along just rejoice so while he sees the man on the wheelchair crying with the bible that is his him going along rejoicing oh god have mercy and i see him going along just rejoicing out of the wheelchair i thought that's strange i went down institute to where there's a 10 cent store a street come this way i was over the other day looking at the place never said nothing to nobody and i looked at the place and there was and i seen i thought well this is stood there at the corner and i heard that squeaking so now it's real now the vision hadn't been over 20 minutes and the man come holding a bible weeping i thought well here it is i say how did you sir and the lady that was pushing him i said what's the matter sir he said i am i said you've got a mighty fine book there he said i believe every word of it and i said do you believe it's contents all through he said i do's her with all my heart and i said what's the matter hear this said the doctor just discouraged me i've been crippled up with arthritis he tells me i'll never walk again i said the contents of that book said that there was a man died so that you can walk again he said the lord jesus and i said yes sir do you believe that he said i do i said rise up from there for thus saith the lord you shall walk and the man jumped up and they had they thought they had the salvation army on the corner i run through the 10 cent store went out the alley and back down the other way and cut my cab and went to the airplane they don't know today whatever happened see that's right they don't know nothing about it see it isn't for self-glory is for the glory of the lord jesus christ now let's rewind a little those two ladies who had to move that hat who told them what to do where was the other one before she came to that house maybe she was walking on the street and someone told her you've got to go to that lady's house right now and when you get over there just go in when you see the hat over there move it who was doing that telling me because the opponent said i couldn't tell you what to do that's where we understand what he told us he said i didn't come to create a denomination i didn't come so people can follow me i didn't come so you make a group no i came to see established a relationship between man and his creator because when you are in a relationship with a creator he can talk to you he can tell you things hallelujah he told adam things every evening he come for fellowship with adam and they would have communion they would talk one to another and brother i came to see that reestablished and that vision could not happen if the heart had not been moved now if a hat is so important that the baby had to stay sick till that hat was moved how much more is the position of the sons and daughters of god in christ amen that's close i don't want to be low 8 28 okay let me close my bible malachi sees a vision and he sees a man walking and they tell him that's elijah he's going to restore the hearts he sees what he's going to do and he prophesies and he goes away and when the time for malachi 4 5 to come the life happens the whole of heaven mobilizes so that this word can come to reality and then they come and inform the prophet it's you so i only have a fifth grade education i don't think i can do this i know all of that it's you do you know the prophets that he didn't believe he could ever be a christian he said because he had a temperament that could fight a buzz saw so he never thought he could be a christian he said one time he went to school he fought with his friends they mashed up all his mouth and he had to eat his food from a straw he said the next day he got his rifle he went through the corner there was fire with him when they came he said who's gonna be the first to die and they all run away and when he pulled the trigger do you know what the trigger said the trigger said i can't say amen to that because you have to fulfill the scripture so you you yourself cannot stop it from happening because if you had killed somebody that morning we wouldn't be where we are today and one day when the trials of life became so difficult on him and hard and his wife passed away and the baby passed away and said lord i just want to die let me take away my life he tried to grab that cable the cable didn't say amen to that he said let me get my pistol and work it out the garden didn't say amen to that you know why because there was something that was written about him and he himself could not stop it isn't that wonderful that he looked at all my faults he looked at all my weaknesses he looked at all my wrongs he looked at everything do you have time for one last vision you all said it man amen one day mama hazard's child and he grows in the church i enjoy brother ben david's testimony the other day because that was what i was when he was speaking how that he grew up in the church he knew how to coach he could talk with message believers and all just get along and you just kind of slide you know easy just call quotes here there oh he's a good one and the mama raised up her child in the way of the lord and the child went away from god but she went to the neology school in theology school you better watch it because when god takes your case in his hand you cannot do anything about it when god takes your fire and begins to review your pages your mom and i can rest so young people let me just tell you right now if your mom and dad are praying to god about you you cannot do anything you can try just forget it i tried hard i'll be drinking with my friends when i hear my ear you don't have to be and there's nobody talking to you but there's somebody talking to god and this mom raised her child in the fear of the lord and he went away god in the world but when the world stung him who did he go to his friends he went back to his mama because he had experimented love true love the kind of love that wouldn't you know just put you aside the kind of love that would take you in tell you what's right but still love you and he came back home the prophet said he the mom was calling him baby a big grown man she said my baby and the whole night she began to consult heaven oh god of heaven i'm like that woman in the bible i didn't have no child you promised me this one and now here is i'm like the shunammite woman but where is your elijah where is that malachi 4-5 and why she's over there talking to god she catches a thought of god and she sees a vision in that vision she sees him walking down the street his clothes he has on amen and she's looking at the whole happening and her son comes back to life oh she just said oh thank you lord she comes down when she reaches home she just walks outside and set out brother she was there from about three a.m in the morning waiting so she believed what she had seen and she was waiting for it to come to pass and while she's waiting god informs a participant over there that flight you have let's put on hold for a minute just keep walking but lord i've got to fight to catch you just keep walking left right who was telling him where to go and that mother was just sitting there just waiting and when she sees him she says how are you person so he used to be the one they asked how do you know now he's the one asking the lady how do you know i'm a person and she tells him last night i was talking to god and god showed me you god told me you are coming and she takes him in the house and the boy was crying mama is dark in the room mama is dark in the room and he said let's pray she kneels down so when he heard that mama pray he knew she knew how to pray he said he didn't have to pray long he said he just grabbed his feet and prayed then he stopped saying mama it's light in the room mama is light in the room where did the darkness go [Applause] darkness is just the absence of light that's all it is but in the vision that the mom saw her son was healed so i asked myself so even vaccinating people can be in the vision i say amen because when the grace of god looks beyond your fault and sees your need and that you were there you cannot help yourself in the vision you are not a halfway christian that's why i said be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may do or show was the perfect will of god but was that his will to be like jesus to be like jesus all the thigh lord to be like you [Music] all through life's journey from earth to be like indictment the prophet said listen at that prophet standing there look at him fearless standing there upon the bunch and condemning them and indicting them said this is the scripture this is that that was spoke of the prophet of by the prophet i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy on my handmaids and my servants made servants i will pour out my spirit and i will show signs in the heavens above and on the earth fire and pillars of smoke and vapor proving it by the word that it was the word they laughed and made fun of it and they went to judgment and the city was burned and they eat one another's children and to there they scattered people throughout the whole world showing the holy spirit still remains the word of god to bring this word to make it to live he said jesus was the person man god hallelujah he was the manifestation of god he was god in body form to reflect the word of god for that age to make that age see god's promise for that age not hear this as we close and the holy ghost is the same thing today is the spirit of god upon the written word of god trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever saint john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also jesus christ the same yesterday and forever see constantly trying to find its way to reflect itself in this age do you love the lord amen i was in cameroon in a small town and we're preaching a simple sermon there was a nine-year-old sitting in the front and he kept staring at me so hard i was scared and he was turning me throughout the service and he wouldn't move left or right so when the service was over everybody was so blessed the wall just rejoicing and i was wondering i kept wondering why was this child staring at me like that so we got in the car and he was on his daddy's lap and the pastor asked him samuel did god show you anything or is there anything that we need to know from the lord i ask myself why are they asking a nine-year-old boy that kind of a question i didn't know i never been there never knew the boy he said yeah i saw something i said oh so when that tall brother was preaching then he pointed me so when that thought brother was preaching i saw jesus i said he said i saw jesus and the pastor asked him did you see him in his mouth or in his heart he said i don't know i just saw jesus but my memory began to go back come on man you lied yesterday are you sure this guy this cannot be because my memory is not my friend your memory is not your friend bro it will remind you of how disqualified you are it would remind you of how unworthy you are but when you lift your eyes and look to calvary and you look at the one that calls you worthy it's high time you believe what he says about you and doubt what your memory says about you because you cannot help yourself anyway he's the one that called you now if he's the one that called you who are you to disqualify yourself because paul said what can separate us from this love that came and looked for us from this love that came and called us from this love that paid the price for me he began to name all the things and there was nothing found worthy to disqualify you from the love of god in christ jesus because when he looked at the vision he saw you there and because he saw you there now he came looking for you it's not adam that look for god when adam went his way and god said adam where are you the reason why you came tonight is because god convinced you at your house there's gonna be service tonight i want to speak to you go and listen because when i look at the vision you are sitting there do you know even the color of your dress your clothes you have now god knew it so tell god god if you knew the kind of clothes that i have on tonight how much more of my needs if you know the number of hair that i have even after my hair cut how much more how much more of your desires there was a song with singing sunday it says and i want to see your desires fulfilled in me and the desire of god is to look at you with a steve and see himself the brothers say he's free he went with his friends i want to quit but he's just hard he went with friends to the junkyard and his friend was showing how he separated the cars he said they put a big magnet and they just pass it over the cars and they begin to magnetize them except but there was one there i kind of did magnetize so he asked him he said why did that one not get magnetized and because he got a big boat like this and it's bolted to the earth that one can go but as we close the prophet said you and i where do we come from we cannot be bolted to this earth we cannot be held down here he said when the rain comes down and the drops on the leaves when the sun begins to shine he said the the drops begin to rejoice you know why hallelujah because they know in the rays of the sun there is power to change them from liquid into people so when they see that sunshine hallelujah it doesn't matter if it's till 6 am they don't care because they know at some point the sun is gonna get to his intense power and it's going to transform them from that state and they'll be cut away from here one of these days brothers this is your skin that is trying to tell you oh you got covered oh you got this and that look it doesn't matter what kind of disease comes on you because there is a promise of god that is more powerful than every disease past disease present ones even future ones the brother said there's going to be disease come that it would require divine healing because there'll be no medicine for it said they are cooking up their things in their labs but don't worry god knows living either god is putting faith in people hallelujah how do we come here we recharge our bodies every day hallelujah do you think it's for nothing no god is calling us say hey there's more for you come up here don't just step down on the bench brother sister open your vessel say lord here's my vessel feel it low all the way because david said my cup runneth over he said my cup is full no if your cup is full it's for you alone but when your cup runs over whether peter is walking one day hallelujah and just cast people in the shadow just touch his shadow the prophet lost his bag with his clothes and his bible oh brother let's buy another one he said oh brother just wait don't worry about it just wait said no brother brother because if somebody gets it two things can happen if he's a believer he'll cut it all to pieces and send the pieces everywhere i don't believe that we just throw it away he said no brother just wait why because even his clothes were charged with virtue i wanted to read a quote here can i read it oh my this one just did something to me oh i wish i can find it oh it's not here this is my i think it's in my bag the prophet said what if i just paraphrased what if if we have to be like christ we must have his virtue he said what if somebody comes to you for virtue and tries to pull virtue from you and you check bounce is it insufficient funds when you have an almighty god but you have insufficient funds is it his fault oh one day was mexico there was a brother and his more music he's his grandma he's here god bless you my friends i invited them to come over his grandma was sick and we are just preached about how god sent his word for every situation and we're about to leave i said brother i haven't seen your mom where's your mom he said brother she's sick she's sick with the covet i said okay can we call her on the phone he said yeah we can call on the phone i said brother call your mom because we cannot preach what we just preach and then we hear about disease i thought i said brother we cannot heal her but we just preach that we got a god that heals her i said can we just kind of experiment say let's experiment this he said brother i'll call her he called on the phone he said oh my son i can barely talk what do you need he said mom i have some brothers here i want to pray for you he said oh prayer is the good thing just pray for me i said sister we just spoke this morning about how the word of god would meet every situation i just wanted to remind you about the scripture can i read it to you oh yeah read it to me brother regards to reading it who says so sister this word of god is going to meet with your disease when it meets your disease it's going to be a little battle but the word of god has never failed before so we know what to expect she said brother i said yeah we think about it so complicated sometimes i said very simple the word of god has never failed before so don't worry about it just let it meet your situation she said okay brother i believe let's pray man was sunday evening we prayed i said okay brother god bless you and i came back home so tuesday i called him i said brother how are you doing he's all doing good i said um how's your mom say so brother she's out outside the house she's over there eating with her daughters they're talking i said oh she's doing good he said oh brother you wouldn't believe it i said i'll check with her on thursday i called back there i said brother how's your mom say oh she's sweeping [Applause] hallelujah he's not a human being we are nothing it's the god of heaven the brother say he does not have any hands if it's not for your hands my brother he don't have no mouth if it's not for your mouth he don't have no ears if it's not for your ears oh we have a song to sing back home in africa say lord make me a practical instrument for you use me o lord just like the brother said the other day they said just surrender because when you surrender then he can do something and to surrender me you got to raise your hands say lord i can't fight no more lord i can't do this halfway christianity no more you're going to have to do something for me lord you being the same yesterday today and forever do something for me lord i believe your word is the same i believe you're true lord here i am for you and when brother jacob was going to meet the age of lord he went like this after the meeting but he came back limping and a prince before he went like this nothing but when god broke him he came back victorious when his wife saw him he was limping yes but something had changed about that man i believe the lord has really been ministering to us these days telling us hey there's more there's more for you come i have this these blessings for you do you want them look when i see you in the vision you you are your whole your will you're serving me you're full of my life don't stay just here come up higher as i invite the musicians to come i don't want to be used of your time either but sometimes it's just hard you have to find a way to stop you can't find it but it's because there's someone that's still hungry you can't pull the plate away someone's still eating you're a bad server if you come and take the dish away when they're still working on it but as we just bow our heads and talk to the lord this evening think about what job saw you know in that congregation there was not anybody who wasn't rejoicing there was not anybody there who was a halfway believer so all those who were there in that congregation they were singing they were praising god let's just say our song holy words every truth and as he began to look in that congregation and those people were rejoicing and praising the lord he could identify with somebody there [Music] and that person looked very much like him that's why god sent us his word because we look in the mirror of the word and we can see ourselves and we can say god that's me god that's me [Music] as we prayed together and call on the lord i definitely know he spoke to somebody's heart he spoke to my heart in the room i was saying lord god you'd have to speak to your people because i cannot do it and i know he did speak to our hearts tonight [Music] think about the vision that god has of you not even your own because yours not you're not worthy but think about what he saw in you how he saw you oh it's wonderful let us pray heavenly father i can say that as another servant i've done my job but i've put my whole confidence in the holy spirit he's the preacher that never fails god he's the one that meets the needs of your children where they are lord there may be some on the internet listening but here we are tonight god as your children begin to open their cops say lord fill me through and through lord god lord bring me where you want me to be let your desires in you let your will be fulfilled in me father god remember my brother remember my sister lord i pray in the name of jesus christ that you would minister to our hearts when we sleep at night when we work lord with this message that you've given us lord constantly speak to our hearts to transform us into the very image of your son jesus christ [Music] that's your desire that's your goal and you're not coming short you're not coming for a church that short of that so being aware of that we just surrender to you like our brother was preaching sunday night that you would make of us what you want lord god we thank you tonight for your spirit your presence among us and lord we want to take advantage of that while you're here if there be someone that doesn't know you lord please would you go to their seat because you came to my seat when i was in church one night and you took a hold of me in the back all the way and you called me and said you come here you're not of the world lord i pray for those that are hungering for a deeper walk with you father meet them where they are i pray for those that are struggling with some things father god you are the deliverer i pray for those lord that are just hungering for your feeling of the holy spirit oh god thank you because we have a promise we can hold on to with all of our faith you said in your word if we repent lord and we baptize the name of jesus christ our lord you shall give us the gift of the holy spirit it's a gift from you so we accept it lord we thank you tonight for david lord for restoring him lord for him always desire to be at the post of duty lord may you continue to inspire him lord and to bless him to anoint him because lord we see your blessings we see the leading of your spirit so we surrender him into your hands father father the ministers that help people that sing and pray lord someday we're not gonna have to pray anymore but i pray for those that are putting their shoulder to the wheel lord bless each one in jesus name and that lord when we get over there we don't have to push no more wagons do no more struggling but you wipe our tears god we give you the glory tonight we bless you for all that you are in jesus name amen holy words [Music] it's [Music] amen did you find something for you to take personally tonight [Music] you know i thought it's the how perfect the word of god is you know the prophet of god said in the beginning was the word he said but the word was a thought if you could say the word was a vision a thought and then the vision was expressed became the word but then the vision was made flesh it was fulfilled so you know you're part of the vision and that was beautiful what was so beautiful tonight that that you're part of the vision of the bride so when he saw the bride he saw you right the book of life was a vision he said the reason that he could raise that little girl from the dead jairus's daughter because he knew her name was on the lamb's book of life so just think of it and and you know make how his brother moses went through that vision with the praying for the baby everybody had a part to play in that vision [Music] you have a part to play in the vision you know moses there's nobody that's a a maverick or a loner or on their own they're a part of something because this body is fitted and joined together this vision is put together with every member supplying a need to the other so just think of it that each person has a part that they have to play in the vision so god's got to place you in your part of fulfillment nobody can take your place think of it nobody can take your place nobody could fulfill your part of the vision the vision can't go on without you that's why i had to forgive you because you were part of the vision of the lamb book of life it's just it's so beautiful and and so he has to place you in your part of the vision and don't you want to surrender to that i mean i've i've been so thrilled lately i've heard so many wonderful testimonials sister lindsey tonight people have come to me all over the church god's moving god's work and you know why he's fulfilling a vision he saw a bride didn't he without spot or without wrinkle he saw a body of believers an elect lady a bride working in unity uniting time and sign coming together one with him in the word there's something to be a part of church pray in your heart i i think our brother admonished us tonight is if you surrender he'll fulfill your part of the vision because the word has to be made flesh amen lord richly bless you is there anybody tonight that the presence of the lord is here that needs special prayer maybe you're sick or you have a special burden or something and that you would like to maybe come tonight and have special prayer if there's nobody that's good too but we just want to make the opportunity for somebody and would you all pray together this is a part of you amen so our brother has a special need brother moses would you come with me [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] yes [Music] so [Music] oh

our heads before we to dismiss and and uh we'll sing that song for dip uh dismissal god is good is he good all the time amen don't you love him don't you just want to see him you know what's beautiful
