Description:
A War Disguised By Prosperity
Br. David McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: January 12, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you just to be with us tonight in this time of fellowship in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you tonight if you have your bibles and and we just have a a simple thought tonight and just as we're building and and going down our our life's road we'd like to turn over in the book of proverbs and uh to proverbs the 16th chapter of proverbs and the 25th verse and then we'll turn back a page to proverbs now if you don't turn your bible you're going to think i'm repeating myself so for these just as we read proverbs 16 and 25 there is a way that seemeth a right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death let's flip back over and turn the page over if your bibles are like mine to the 14th chapter and we'll read in the 12th verse there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that mirth is heaviness the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways that's a quite a statement that if you just uh hold it there for a minute the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end of that way of death a backslider is filled with his own ways and a good man shall be satisfied from himself the simple believeth every word and that's not every word of god that's anything that anybody tells you the the the simple believeth the internet just throwing that out there to try to bring from perspective uh but the prudent man looketh well to his going the prudent man looked at the well to where he's going where he's ending up what's really happening okay and there is going and a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool rageth and is confident heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us tonight in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you tonight you know i i enjoy sometimes just sitting down and just taking a few moments to look at the scriptures uh the the the scriptures uh are are marvelous to us in fact we understand really what a messenger is or any prophet is he's a divine interpreter of the word of god and so we know there's certain things you can't do with the word of god is that you can't misplace it you can't take it out of season there there's uh it it always remains the same it can't be rewritten or changed and it has one meaning it's not given to multiple uh thoughts and we find that today i just want to cover some basis as we go on fellowshipping a little more oh we're draining the water out of the baptistry i'm sorry you can't hear it but i feel like i'm going down the drain i hope i'm not i i hope that uh uh you know as the crowds get smaller you start to think that you're going down the drain but i then i go look up what the prophet of god said he said you know the word of god doesn't always draw everybody amen so we we we're we're talking about our way okay and there is a way jesus said i am the way and i realized that more and more that the brother brown always emphasized to us and and we've got to understand he never came to point to himself the purpose that was within his heart was he had a message that was given to him from almighty god to deliver to his people and the purpose was not to convert the whole world he knew who his own were my sheep hear my voice and they will not follow he knew that there was elected people that would hear what was being said and that the spirit of god would increase their understanding we understand in this age of all ages that satan appears as an angel of light so he doesn't appear to be evil he appears it appears to be right and and so we we find out that that in the hour that we're living in that there is a way away god's always had a way of doing things a wise man he looketh up he looketh to his ways he he he he he look as to his going the scripture says it looks so what what what he's going what way is he going what's going on but but uh a foolish man he just listens to everything sure you know what i mean if somebody comes along and says oh everything's okay and everything's fine he says everything's okay everything's fine you know uh that someone says there's no lawlessness in our country yeah there's no lawlessness everything's fine uh you know look at my my brother he is uh uh my brother michael uh he's uh four years older than i am and uh and you know he lives in austin and and uh and he would be he's an old hippie is is what he is you know and uh and he's got a lot of what we would refer to as open uh politics and and everything and he only listens to one voice of reason that that's all he's got the people that he listens to and and and he'll he'll bring up things to me and i don't even want to go there you know what i mean but he just will bring it up to me anyway and so i i went down to see him and and david junior and i gave him a pickup truck and and uh so you're gonna have to borrow andrew's truck or tommy's truck if you want to move and uh so uh and he he comes up to me and he says you know isn't it amazing that that they're telling all these lies about riots and uh people burning things in the street and breaking into stores and stealing things now i i i was breathless and i said okay great things are better than i thought they were you know what i mean i was worried that the world was coming to an end you know that all the signs that the scripture were were telling me what was transpiring really aren't true and i i thought and i thought i just wanted to say michael you've got to be kidding me look around you and you know my brother lived in a uh he lived in a very middle nice middle class part of town and now all down his block and everything and right down around the corner and everything everybody set up tents you know what i mean and and i think that he feels it's my fault you know it's somebody's fault you know what i mean and i'm saying this because these are the political arguments and i think that we've really got to put the mind of christ in our hearts and our lives and really look at the word of god so i i would say in that respect that my my brother would be what you would consider given to the politics of things and how many knows we're living in a very political cri climate everybody you know what politics is you know what the definition of politics is it's too it's people's ideas in order to gain power that's what it is it's it's the pursuit of power that exactly all if you look up the definition of politics politics is people politicking for the desire to achieve power now let's listen to what brother branham said if you can find it it's in the message knoweth it not that was preached august 15 of 1965. i was reading the titles that brother branham preached in 1965 and if you just read the titles you can start to be able to get an understanding of what that he was trying to tell the believer and the church world and the world because god never sends judgment without sending a warning first another and it isn't just of a flashing red light when god sent his warning and his revealing of the son of petition and and turned on the light in our hour and told us about the god of this evil age and there's the god of this evil age in other words what this age was worshiping science education their own thinking their own system their own development the way that they feel is right because that's what they worship they worship their own way the way that they're going the way that they're transpiring the way one man spoke the other day and he says my my my great desire is to be buried on mars now think of that right where you're sitting right now and i believe that he believes he has that capability of doing that no they may bury his bones on mars but that ain't where he's going to stay he's going to end up in the sun do you know what i mean by that right okay so okay the very god of this evil age is man worshiping education science knowledge achievement that's what they worship they worship achievement if you say is that true what do they invest in they that's what they invest in that's where they put their their treasures isn't that what the scripture said they put their treasures in it now i want the simplicity of god's word we've got to be able to come back and let the simplicity of god's words enter our minds and our thought processes everything so complicated and everything's moving so fast that that people want to think if you just sit back and take the simplicity of god's word you're you're a or you're not very spiritual you know and paul said if i speak with tongues and angels of men and angels and i i know all the mysteries and everything and don't have the love of god shed abroad in my heart i'm nothing and and and so what what do you think would be really the judge of a wise person in light of what that were talking about it wouldn't the the wise person as the scripture said it is that a a wise man feareth and departeth from evil another how would you what would you feel a wise man really was a man that invested in in in a a technology uh that uh maybe produced alcohol quicker and cheaper than it's ever been produced before and have millions of people die from automobile accidents and and all those things well what would you consider how wise would that be you know so what we get is we get a hunger for spiritual things or spiritual conversation or we could start getting a hunger for the stimulation of our mind and our spiritual senses and looking at things that are going on out here in these realms that we can't touch but we don't even recognize what is actually happening right now what's going on right now what what's transpiring right now if i had a sermon title i i was going to to call this a war disguised by prosperity a war disguised by prosperity so we we talk about this way and now here's what the prophet of god said this is on paragraph 6 44 of and knoweth it not and it says we will never do any good with politics now just set let that settle in for a minute we all know what's going on we have what the world calls conservatives and and and and and they want to hold things the way they are you know i mean if it ain't broke don't fix it you don't it ain't one's right and the other is wrong they're both wrong they're both wrong and then you have what you have what's called progressive thinking which is a more modern thinking that wants to change things they want to give everybody free education they want to give everybody free medical they want to give they want to take all the student debt and it can throw it away well hey they want free health care for everybody tell me that every single one of those isn't a good decent thing let's just do it and then you got some you got these people over here trying to draw a picture tonight that wait a minute that's my money what are you doing with your money i'm keeping it for myself well you look at that and he says you've already got enough you've got planes and mansions and land and boats and yachts and all this stuff hey share that with these with people and if you're not careful you get caught right up in it going back and forth and exo okay i could present the conservative idea i can present you the liberal or the progressive idea and if you don't watch yourself you get sucked into making a choice in which either choice is evil where does a man make the right choice when both choices that are presented to him are evil remember that's why this voice we had in this day this guide that we had in this day that quite that away seemeth right unto a man but the end of that way is death all politic outcome is death it's death so he goes on to say he says it'll never go do any good with politics it's rotten god's idea of having a king a righteous king is right how many knows we're going to get a king hallelujah is right but politics just simply spread out you can buy anything out cheat lie steal everything else i as i said a few sundays ago and look where we're at see nothing but just a crooked mass of everything but a righteous king can make his own laws and you can kill a man you know good politics that's all right you get out of it see he said it's it is the the democracy is a good idea but it won't work just like communism all things in common it sounds good but it won't work no god's way of having a king like david was was right and you got one mind centered over you've got one mind centered over how many knows what the scripture tells us let the mind that is in christ being you you have one mind centered over we're looking at the world that we're in we're having men coming up with all kinds of ideas and ways we just read it in the world falling apart they're trying to keep coming up with systems to hold the world together and the more they're trying to hold the world together the farther apart it's getting one mind amen that's a king that there's one mind that's in the center of it all now that's what the prophet of god's telling us that's what he came and told the world here we are fighting communism and communism is fighting us there's a cold war going on and what are they battling for they're battling for prosperity but they don't want one mind then paul comes along and says let this mind be in you now you have a messenger that's standing here in our day telling us the mind of god to god politics is corrupt one way or the other it doesn't matter it's all corrupt it's just men fighting for their own well-being and for power and influence at the end of that way is death a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but a fool rageth and is confident let's look what he goes on to say come here it sounds good but it won't work god's ways are king you got one mind centered over like one liter and a bunch of geese and so forth you can't take two or three of them then you mess them all together and you come up with any kind of idea what do you think he's trying to create in you a bunch of your own ideas and men start having their own way someone told leslie that used to go to our church she said have you left the message she says we just follow jesus oh you're still in the message praise god so you're not wearing pants you're not cutting your hair you're not putting on makeup well that don't matter wait a minute it don't matter compared to what compared to what a way seemeth right unto them a man but the end of that way is death away seemeth right unto a man compared to what see that that's what satan's eden is as i talked a little bit about god of this evil age about all the good that's coming out we can tell how great it is and how good and well man is man is doing why there's hospitals going up like we've never had them before praise god there's doctors offices on every corner and there's new diseases every day and new plagues and and millions of us are dying hallelujah and we're sitting here trying to whether worried or not who should wear masks and who shouldn't and what's your political statement and i'm thinking wait a minute we got the wrong mind we got the wrong mind we've got to get back to something amen he said he says and we find out the condition today ready for the coming of the lord let's turn over to paragraph 82. you don't mind these little bible studies like this do you i mean just just some real down-home word teaching and no need to get excited you know what i'm saying but it excites me you know so let's look at this statement and we we've been doing it we've been going through this message slowly and peeling out one sentence at a time one mind over it all i hope that sinks in tonight god's way is to have everybody ruled by one mind not you going out there and getting with your friends and they want to talk politics because that's where they're at and they want to point out hatred and how bad history's been to them and okay and all that and and and and how how terrible it was and it can i it and you know uh in my younger days i i really studied a lot about irish uh uh history and how brutal the english work to the irish and how tough the irish had it when they came to this country but they just formed the mafia they solved their problem they just became evil oh you don't think they did who how do you think that how do you think the irish came out of their depression and their low spot they became the biggest bootleggers that's what they did they were gangsters they were irish just drinkers you know what i mean unless you're born again and they went that's how they got out of it with evil how do you think anybody ever gets on top of another man they rage with evil the bible tells us that and they're confident because they think their way is right god is no respecter of person but listen to what he says here let me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass the whole world is groping in insanity and will get worse and worse and worse until there'll be a bunch of maniacs and it's almost that way now now this is the voice of warning this is the voice that was standing here 50 years ago telling people that their mind was being moved away from the mind of god's word moved away from the scriptures moved away to from the word that god had in his mind in the first place and man was now leaning to their own understanding and fortifying it with a deception of an angel appearing as an angel of light we saw the angel appear two times that come to my mind once in the garden of eden surely you won't die and once on mount him to again amount temptation if thou be the son of god it is written both times using reasoning scriptures remember satan does not worry a bit about using scripture the foolish man believes the simple believeth every word oh well this is great amen you just throw out a scripture how does that work let me tell you how clever he is we have so many people today that think many ideas all of which are okay we just love jesus i believe in three gods you know i believe in a little fat guy that puts his hand arms together and got a little thing on his forehead and sits there you know buddha's just as good as jesus no look we're starting to get so sympathetic oh you're a buddhist wow that's wonderful you're hearty krishna oh that's good yeah we all going to go to heaven that's not what he said my sheep know my voice all the father hath given me will come there's an elected group of people who is a minority they're not of this world they're in this world do you count yourselves if not you're going to count yourself with general christianity we're all christians all our ideas are fine they all they're all okay they all go they all were all okay and why do they have different ideas because you get one group that majors on one point of it they just measure on grace grace grace grace well i love grace grace forgave me but should we sin that grace may abound god forbid and they'll they'll major up on another point you have the holy ghost how do you know compared to what well i spoke in tongues compared to when i read the bible i look back at the upper room and they got the holy ghost and they spoke with tongues and they'd go to two or three scriptures well if you're going to take it all let's go take it all so what they do they each one majors on an idea this is why a voice came in our day and said you've got to take all of the word of god people are getting caught up excuse me and into arguments with people because they can't see the whole picture they get sucked in to the one train of thought argument what about the whole picture what about the voice that was telling us look at where it's going what are these things compared to what are they compared to let's just keep reading here the whole world is groping in insanity and will get worse can you imagine a man driving with his lights off on the wrong side of the road a ricky young kid supposed to be right out of high school and kill a bunch of people how many know about the sport the athlete that was driving 140 miles an hour and ran into the back of a lady it's going on all the time out there i suppose someone could look right there and find out how many deaths are caused by alcohol if in this country a year young kid supposed to be right out of high school killed a bunch of people does that stop them the next one comes right behind him doing the same thing can you imagine a young man that thinks any cell anything of himself getting out here and acting the way they do i just want to drop a tidbit here one of the biggest problems a young amongst young women and young men is self-esteem i believe they call it shaming i think that's a thing they shame you about everything they shame you about your bald head they shame you about your big nose they shame me about i know about it i just went to my doctor he spent the whole time shaming me your blood pressure's too high your sugar's too high you're too heavy you know what i mean i said but god still knows where the hair in my head is and so he brought this young this young doctor in from uh gambia which is somewhere by ghana and togo right there on the west coast and he's sitting over there and i says well not i'm going to give you a lesson right now i says i like but dr joseph is a good guy i said but i'm going to give you a lesson i said if god wants me to stay here there's not enough disease and sickness and devils to take me. and i said and if god wants to take me there's not enough doctors medicine and science to keep me here my doctor just throws up his hand says i can't tell him anything i said you guys are not prolonging my life you're just trying to choose the way it ends you see what i'm saying man i'm not going to get caught in that trap i went to the doctor one time he said you got asthma wrote me a bunch of asthma medicine and everything i went out got in my truck put put on a tape cassette and he said anybody know what that is and brother brown comes on he says that come scratching the door throw it out you know i said i'm not i'm not believing that i just never went back never had a speck of asthma anywhere i don't know where he got that diagnosis he must have had stock in the medicine you might think what's motivating the things people tell you isn't that what the scripture says he says the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh well to his going what is motivating me here anyway let's just read i'll close he says that don't stop him no any man thinks anything of himself getting out here and acting the way they do self-esteem they don't have one head they don't have a voice they don't know who to listen to right and and this is what the scripture is a backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways and a good man shall be satisfied from himself not worry to what other people think not work he's satisfied with the goodness and the love of god that's in his heart amazing scripture isn't it can you imagine a young woman in the bloom of womanhood beautiful well-built shape profile face beautiful and the very thing of her being pretty shows that we're at the end time see she was went all together to worldly features she's gone all together to worldly features don't judge yourself by the world i mean it's it's just insanity if you start looking you know i i think that i think you need to get in your prayer closet and pray a little bit if you're looking over your shoulder at the mirror and it says see all together to worldly features worldly things and not the beauty of holiness and sweetness in her soul he's back there telling the people years ago i'm talking about the message that was preached the message that we're forgetting the abcs what brother bran what the war was about but he disguised the war with prosperity because we became blind miserable poor wretched and naked and didn't know it because we prosper right and have goods that's what cathy said we have need of nothing we've got it all and the war am i insane okay and the war is going on over the issues that we're discussing and you've been privileged by god to give you eyes have that you can understand that you're neglected separated called out people and you're not given to think the way the world is you're given to have the mind of christ and be under the one mind of the word we started preaching mysteries and left the message behind really these are abc's this is what we're built on we're built on satan appearing as an angel of light and another mighty angel poking his foot on the land and the sea he said the sweetener i've seen women on the outside of them wasn't nothing to look at but you speak to them one time talk to them a few minutes they're real genuine something that you can't get away from see beauty of the outside is of the devil it's of the world and we have a prophet they're yelling at us they spend more on cosmetics than they do food see we we we we don't we don't get the thing so that man comes up with all these ideas they major on one point they forget the rest of it and that's the deception can you imagine anybody saying that something that's written in the word of god doesn't matter that don't matter it don't matter how you're baptized it don't matter if you smoke as long as you do it in moderation it don't matter it don't matter it don't matter nothing matters that's the point it doesn't matter compared to what because men compare themselves one to another and the scripture says you're fools because you're comparing yourselves one to another you're okay i'm okay and if then the world's out here comparing themselves one to another so the anybody's id is okay right and then they'll say and so they'll major on one point if you want to major on that point and forget the rest that's okay many ideas all of which are okay and it takes away from the deity of god it completely does away with one of the am i i'm just i'm just inspired it takes away from one of the statements that brother branham screamed out over this generation remember he came to bring judgment to this world he called to set you free and drive the all in their ear he came to call you out and they go back into to slavery okay and so it does completely away with the deity of god in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god in the beginning god in the beginning it's a good idea it's if many ideas are okay major on one point but the whole idea is your ideas are okay compared to what compared to what and here's this voice screaming back to the word back to the word back to the word how can you say you're filled with the spirit of god and deny the word this message wasn't just brother bannon coming up it was the word made flesh so the gentiles could absolutely look at the word made flesh and crucify it again i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the word those are the things that we should have eyes have to see but in the world just pining us surely you won't die surely god doesn't mean that why because he's got an eden we come from a garden not from skyscrapers we came from a place there wasn't no cement and steel man's just been progressing and progressing and progressing now they're starting to go up in space and take joy rides in space and and it's gone you know and we just got to come back to the thing so what do they do they take away from the deity of god and they take away from the absoluteness of god that god has a way he's got a truth he's got a way and his way is his word in the beginning was the way and this is what we've got to do just in our own lives you young people you you go to school and they feed you all kinds of stuff and they make you read romeo and juliet and and crazy stuff like that grapes of wrath and of mice and men and war and peace and peace and death and you know does anybody read any of that stuff anybody know what i'm talking about that's kind of stuff i had to read i hated it i never could read i'd have people read to me and then have them tell me stuff and i wanted to get out of there and i still want to get out of here i thank god for jesus christ i thank god for the word of god i thank god for the blood i thank god for i sav that i can see you know one of the things we're asked to have in this day is i sap that we can see to be clothed in white rain of it so your nakedness does not appear other words don't put on these ideas of the world so you're wearing these ideas and they can see that you're naked of the word of god don't get it so carnal in your mind that you just think he's talking about good dresses and and shirts and stuff he's talking about spiritual nakedness a person can be you can see and still be blind that's what he's trying to con don't let the world put the world on you that that it shows that you're not covered with the word so if you don't have the word you might have clothes on but you're naked you're without covering and gold tried in fire real christian character to discern between good and evil and know the difference and let me bring it back in closing we ought to be thankful for our election else we would be in that and not know it though our way would be the way of death because sent a voice in this day the trump of an archangel that we could hear and that we could understand that that that there was a trump there was a shout get yourself ready come out from amongst my people i know it's been years how many years ago did paul preach how many years ago did peter preach it don't matter what our clock says because we're not clock people we're eternal people we don't have clock life you can't say oh ben you know in uh was it 2030 and in 2037 brother mcgeary died well that's kind of victory to the fact that i was born again and grave has no victory and death has no sting and i don't die you say on my grave on such and such day brother mcgeary left this dimension into another dimension because the gift of god is eternal life through christ jesus so when we can hold these anchors when we can hold these fundamental principles when we can understand the war is going on the war for your mind the war for your thinking the war for your headship right and that's the capstone as john said little children god is love god is his word you can't separate love and the word and faith in the word so we're part of something and i feel that as i've watched people fall away i i understand that i've i failed in not making clear the deception of this present world and how that we've let fancy sermons move us away from literally what's transpiring in our daily lives and how satan is trying to grab control of your mind using politics education civilization and we're losing the headship of the one mind of god and they shame us for it shame on you thinking you're elected shame on you thinking you're called out shame on you ferc thinking and i i i look out at once i said you know fool me once it's my fault it's your fault fool me twice is my fault right i ain't gonna buy their lie not when it's been so prevalently made and exposed god of this evil age satan's eden doing god a service without it being his will god's provided way seed is not heir with the shock i mean message after message after message in this 1965 pointing out the deception what i say is sometimes we can get to balanced over here on who we are and where we come from and everything that we get sucked out of the battle and the enemy creeps in he's not working on what you believe he's working on what you don't see so let's put up our guards let's let's let's be and and i don't want to leave that part out of the message can if i fail to get down and teach some of these people the basic abcs of the vision of recognizing the day and its message then i ask you to forgive me because men fail but god's word never fails so always in your life look at which way you're going those are great words of advice great scripture so let's just continue forward let's not be ashamed when we preach against the things in the abcs and holiness and godliness and add that in with the mysteries and the revelation of who we are and our names are on the lamb's book of light we don't want our nakedness to appear we want to take all the word of god every part when it hurts we want to take that when it feels good we want to take that but we want any man to be able to come into the gospel and have hope that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god bless you brother and in christ alone my hope is found it is my light my strength my song all this cornerstone this solid ground firm to the furious drought and stone oh white heights of love one depths of peace when fears are still and striving stays o my comforter my all in all here in the love of christ i stand in christ alone good to confess fullness
