[5:33] Good morning. Welcome to the house of
[5:35] the Lord. We seem to be few in number
[5:38] this morning, but we're going to make a
[5:40] joyful noise and lift our voices. And
[5:45] you know, there's only 120 in the upper
[5:46] room. Amen.
[5:49] But they let the whole area know their
[5:51] presence when they came out of there.
[5:53] Amen. Let's sing that course they were
[5:55] playing. Grace, grace, God's grace.
[6:00] Oh, it's grace.
[6:04] Grace.
[6:06] God's
[6:09] grace.
[6:11] Grace light will
[6:16] man
[6:19] within
[6:20] [Music]
[6:22] grace.
[6:24] Praise
[6:27] God's
[6:30] grace.
[6:32] Grace that is greater
[6:37] than all
[6:39] lies. Let's sing the chorus again. Oh,
[6:43] praise.
[6:48] God's
[6:51] grace.
[6:53] Grace love that will pardon
[6:58] and
[7:01] within
[7:04] grace
[7:07] lives.
[7:09] God's
[7:12] grace.
[7:14] Praise that
[7:17] is greater
[7:19] than
[7:22] our sin. Let's stand as we sing it one
[7:24] more time. Oh, praise
[7:28] him
[7:30] [Music]
[7:32] God's
[7:34] grace.
[7:37] Grace that will pardon
[7:42] things
[7:44] within
[7:47] his grace.
[7:50] Praise
[7:53] God.
[7:55] [Music]
[7:58] Grace
[8:01] is greater
[8:03] than all
[8:05] our sins.
[8:08] Amen. Unmmerited favor, the outpouring
[8:11] of grace. What a blessing it is. Um I
[8:14] must admit I feel a little bit uh out of
[8:17] place here this morning, but uh we're
[8:20] going to do the best we can. Sometimes
[8:21] you think uh if the pitcher, and I'll
[8:24] use a baseball analogy, is not doing so
[8:26] well, they go to the bullpin and get a
[8:28] reliever. Sometimes they call him the
[8:30] ace. Sometimes he's better than the guy
[8:32] that started out. But I'm one of those
[8:34] position players. When they run out of
[8:35] relief players, they just get a position
[8:38] player. Just lob it up there and let
[8:39] them hit it. We'll take care of you. So,
[8:41] I'm relying on you guys to back me up
[8:43] and take care of me. So, amen. Lord,
[8:46] bless. Uh let's just open with prayer.
[8:49] We'll give him the honor and the glory
[8:50] in first place. Amen. Our gracious Lord,
[8:54] we truly ask that you would have the
[8:56] preeminence.
[8:57] Lord, there be nothing said or done
[9:00] that's outside your control in your Holy
[9:02] Spirit. We pray, Lord, that you just
[9:04] envelop this place, Lord, as we come
[9:06] with prepared hearts to hear your word.
[9:09] Lord, we want to sing the songs and
[9:11] praise you and worship you, Lord. Let
[9:13] them sink down on the inside, but
[9:14] mostly, Lord, they're to prepare our
[9:17] hearts and create an atmosphere that the
[9:20] true word of God can come
[9:22] &gt;&gt; and make manifest and do something for
[9:24] us that's of eternal value. So Lord,
[9:27] just lay the flesh aside. We pray all
[9:29] the faults, the failures, they're many.
[9:32] Lord, there's many needs, but we just
[9:34] put them all on your altar this morning
[9:36] and pray that you'd just lead, guide,
[9:38] and direct as you'd see fit. Lord, we
[9:40] worship you in spirit and in truth this
[9:42] morning. We ask this in the name of the
[9:44] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'll grab your Bibles, if you
[9:50] don't have a Bible, refer to the screen.
[9:52] We're going to read from Psalms 86 this
[9:54] morning.
[9:56] Psalm 86
[10:01] and I couldn't help but notice verse 9.
[10:07] All nations whom thou hast made shall
[10:10] come and worship before thee. Amen.
[10:13] There's many, many nations gathered here
[10:15] this morning represented and but we've
[10:18] all come to worship him. Amen. All
[10:20] right. We'll just uh read responsively
[10:22] and we'll join together there on the
[10:24] last of Psalm 86.
[10:27] Bow down thine ear, O Lord, hear me, for
[10:31] I am poor and needy.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Preserve my soul, I am
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry
[10:43] unto thee daily.
[10:51] For thou, Lord, art good and ready to
[10:53] forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all
[10:56] them that call upon thee.
[11:08] Thou wilt answer me.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All nations whom thou has
[11:19] made shall come and worship before thee,
[11:22] oh Lord, and shall glorify thy name.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to the truth. And this is a
[11:32] prayer of David. Teach me thy way, O
[11:34] Lord. I will walk in thy truth. Unite my
[11:38] heart to fear thy name.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; For great is thy mercy toward me and
[11:49] thou has delivered my soul from the
[11:51] lowest hell.
[12:02] But thou, oh Lord, art God full of
[12:04] compassion and gracious and
[12:06] long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy
[12:08] and truth.
[12:18] Show me a token for good that they which
[12:21] hate me may see it and be ashamed
[12:24] because thou Lord has hope in me and
[12:27] comforted me. Amen. Blessed be the name
[12:29] of the Lord. If we could let's sing that
[12:31] song. They come. They come from the east
[12:33] and west. Man, just uh before you're
[12:36] seated, just turn around and bless
[12:38] someone by shaking their hand and say,
[12:39] "Welcome to the house of the Lord."
[12:41] Enjoy ourselves this morning in the
[12:42] spirit of holiness and lifting up his
[12:45] name. Amen.
[12:48] Oh, they come from the east and west.
[12:54] They come from the lands of God
[12:59] to feast with the king tonight as his
[13:04] guest. How blessed these pilgrims are.
[13:11] Beholding his pal.
[13:14] [Music]
[13:23] as partaker
[13:26] of his grace as risen his
[13:34] since Jesus has set me free.
[13:40] I'm happy as far can be.
[13:46] No longer I bear the burden of care. His
[13:52] yoke is so sweet to me.
[13:58] My soul was as black as night.
[14:04] The darkness has taken flight.
[14:10] And now I shout the victory
[14:16] for Jesus.
[14:19] Let's go to the last one.
[14:23] is coming
[14:27] before it the ransom stand.
[14:33] No longer our tears, no sorrow is flown,
[14:39] nor death in that goodly land.
[14:45] For my Savior has gone before,
[14:51] preparing the way for me.
[14:55] [Music]
[14:57] Soon we'll be to find the Lord.
[15:02] [Music]
[15:06] Amen.
[15:08] Since Jesus has set me free.
[15:14] Time as far as can be.
[15:20] No longer I bear the burden of pain. His
[15:26] yoke is so sweet to me.
[15:30] [Music]
[15:32] My soul was as black as night.
[15:38] The darkness has taken.
[15:42] [Music]
[15:44] Now I shout
[15:49] for Jesus.
[15:52] Jesus is coming soon.
[15:56] Jesus is coming soon.
[16:02] [Music]
[16:08] Our Lord, this moment should come for
[16:13] those who are free from sin.
[16:19] Oh, then would it bring you joy
[16:24] or sorrow and deep despair.
[16:31] When our Lord in glory comes, we'll meet
[16:37] him by
[16:40] him.
[16:42] Since Jesus has set me free,
[16:48] I'm happy as far can be.
[16:53] No longer I bear the burden of car. His
[17:00] yoke is so sweet to me.
[17:05] My soul was as black as night,
[17:11] but darkness has taken down.
[17:17] Now I shout
[17:21] [Music]
[17:23] for Jesus
[17:25] [Music]
[17:26] free.
[17:28] Amen. You may be seated. Amen.
[17:32] You know, there are times when uh
[17:35] especially on Wednesday night, it seems
[17:37] that you know, you get uh a little
[17:40] depressed by the work day and and things
[17:42] uh tend to just come down on you heavy
[17:46] and and you think, well, I'm going to go
[17:48] to the house of the Lord. And you think,
[17:49] well, I'm going to set myself aside and
[17:51] come in to worship the Lord. and and the
[17:53] burdens of this world and just this old
[17:56] sin nature just continue to to rob you
[17:59] of your victory
[18:01] and and you get somebody up here that
[18:02] sings a song and say, "Oh, I know that
[18:04] one." And it energize you a little bit.
[18:07] And sometimes it's uh we're reluctant to
[18:11] lift our voice and sing because well I
[18:13] may be like me a little off key or a
[18:16] little too loud offensive brother sister
[18:19] you hear me singing.
[18:24] I think it puts the devil under our
[18:26] feet.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram taught us if we raise our
[18:31] hand we defy gravity. That act alone can
[18:34] bring the presence of the Lord. We lift
[18:35] our voices and sing.
[18:38] Doesn't matter. We make a joyful noise
[18:40] unto the Lord. Amen. So, I encourage you
[18:42] this morning, even you young sisters
[18:45] that think, "Oh, my voice may be cracky
[18:47] this morning." Raise your voice and
[18:49] sing. Give God everything that we have.
[18:52] Amen. Amen. I want to sing this course.
[18:54] Uh it's in the old belief song book
[18:57] number 113. It's leave it there. Take
[19:00] your burdens to the Lord and leave it
[19:02] there for others can pull it up.
[19:04] I mean, we may sing some that you're not
[19:07] used to singing, but we're going to
[19:08] we're going to try them this morning.
[19:09] Amen.
[19:13] [Music]
[19:15] Let's start out. If the world from you
[19:17] withhold of its silver and its gold.
[19:19] Yeah.
[19:20] If the world from you withholds of its
[19:24] silver and its gold and you have to get
[19:29] along with bigger f
[19:34] just remember in his word how he feeds a
[19:39] little.
[19:40] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[19:44] it there.
[19:47] Leave it there. there. Oh, leave it
[19:51] there.
[19:53] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[19:57] it there.
[20:00] For if you trust and never doubt, he
[20:04] will surely bring them home. Take your
[20:08] burdens to the Lord and leave it.
[20:13] If your body suffers pain and your
[20:17] health can be and your soul is all
[20:22] sinking in despair,
[20:27] Jesus knows the pain you feel. He can
[20:31] save and he can heal. Take your burdens
[20:35] to the Lord and leave it there.
[20:40] will leave it there.
[20:43] Oh, leave it there.
[20:47] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[20:50] it there.

[20:53] If you trust and never down, he will
[20:57] surely bring you. Take your burdens to
[21:02] the Lord and healing them.
[21:07] When your eneies are saved and your
[21:11] heart begins to don't forget that God in
[21:16] heaven answers prayer
[21:20] for he will make a way for you and he
[21:24] will lead you safely.
[21:27] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[21:30] it there.
[21:33] Leave it there.
[21:37] Leave it there.
[21:40] Take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[21:44] it there.
[21:47] If you trust and never doubt, he will
[21:51] surely bring you up. and your burdens to
[21:56] alone. Leave it there.
[22:00] When your youthful days are gone and old
[22:04] age on and your body
[22:09] need,
[22:11] [Music]
[22:14] he will never leave you there. He'll go
[22:18] with you again. Take your burdens to the
[22:23] Lord and leave it there.

[22:49] to the Lord and leave it there.
[22:54] Amen.
[22:55] Amen. Let's try to segue into sunlight.
[22:58] Sunlight in my soul today. Amen.
[23:06] It was number 46 if that matters.
[23:12] Amen. Uh, I will say I was in church a
[23:15] lot growing up and sometimes the only
[23:18] thing to read was the little blue book
[23:19] on the back of the pew and you just flip
[23:22] through it and you just seem to memorize
[23:24] those numbers. Of course, every song
[23:26] leader everywhere they always had their
[23:28] favorite. So, we knew the the person
[23:30] that was leading singing more than
[23:32] likely they're going to sing this song.
[23:34] But we may, like I said, scatter around
[23:36] this morning. But, amen. We enjoy the
[23:39] freedom of the Holy Spirit this morning.
[23:42] Let's start out on a on a verse
[23:45] somewhere there. All right, here we go.
[23:48] I wondered in the shade till Jesus came
[23:53] to me and with the sunlight of his love
[23:57] it all my darkness.
[24:01] Sunlight, sunlight
[24:04] in my soul today.
[24:07] Sunlight,
[24:09] sunlight,
[24:10] all along the way.
[24:13] Since the Savior found me and he took
[24:17] away my sin, you're right, Lord. I have
[24:20] had the sunlight.
[24:25] All right, let's start it over there.
[24:27] She warned me it was too high, but I
[24:29] must say, uh, I was telling the brothers
[24:32] back there, my key is B flat. Doesn't
[24:36] matter what key it is. I'm on B flat. So
[24:38] I try to raise it up a little. Sometimes
[24:40] I get too high. So Amen. Let's start it
[24:43] off.
[24:48] Jesus came to me and with the sunlight
[24:53] of his love it all my darkness.
[24:58] Sunlight, sunlight
[25:01] in my soul today.
[25:04] Sunlight,
[25:05] sunlight.
[25:07] All along the way,
[25:10] since the Savior found me and he took
[25:14] away my sin,
[25:16] I have had the sunlight of his love.
[25:21] [Music]
[25:27] Roll.
[25:29] However dark the world may be, I have
[25:32] sunlight in my soul,
[25:35] sunlight,
[25:37] sunlight
[25:38] in my soul today.
[25:42] Sunlight,
[25:43] sunlight.
[25:45] All along the way,
[25:48] since a savior found me and took away my
[25:53] sin,
[25:54] I have had the sunlight of his love.
[26:02] Walking in the light of God, I speak
[26:06] communion find. I press with holy vigor
[26:11] on hand and leave the world behind.
[26:15] Oh, sunlight
[26:17] sunlight
[26:18] in my soul today.
[26:22] Sunlight,
[26:23] sunlight.
[26:25] All along the way.
[26:28] Since the savior found me and took away
[26:32] my sin.
[26:34] I have had the sunlight of his love.
[26:39] [Music]
[26:41] Goodbye.
[26:44] that journey or the pain. And in the
[26:48] sunlight of his love, I ring the golden
[26:52] flame.
[26:54] Sunlight, sunlight,
[26:57] in my soul today.
[27:00] Sunlight,
[27:02] sunlight,
[27:04] all along the way.
[27:06] Since the Savior found me, took away my
[27:11] sin.
[27:13] I have had the sunlight of his love.
[27:17] Soon I shall see. Soon I shall see him
[27:21] as he the light that came to me.
[27:26] Behold the brightness of his face
[27:29] throughout eternity.
[27:33] Sunlight, sunlight
[27:36] in my soul today.
[27:39] Sunlight,
[27:41] sunlight,
[27:42] all along the way.
[27:45] Since a savior found me, took away my
[27:50] sin.
[27:52] I have met the sunlight of his love.
[27:58] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[28:01] Lord.
[28:03] Amen. Amen. Let's tone it down just a
[28:05] little bit. We'll before we read the
[28:07] prayer requests and make a few
[28:08] announcements. Let's sing that little
[28:10] course. I think uh Bill and Gloria
[28:13] Gaither may have written this course.
[28:14] It's called Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There's
[28:17] just something about that name.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[28:25] Jesus.
[28:26] [Music]
[28:28] Jesus,
[28:34] there's just something
[28:37] about
[28:40] that name.
[28:42] Amen. It's true.
[28:46] Oh, master,
[28:49] savior
[28:52] Jesus.
[28:57] Like the frame rings
[29:01] after
[29:03] the rain.
[29:07] [Music]
[29:10] Jesus.
[29:13] Jesus.
[29:15] Jesus.
[29:18] [Music]
[29:20] Let all heaven
[29:24] and earth
[29:26] proclaim.
[29:33] Kings
[29:35] and kingdoms
[29:38] shall all
[29:41] pass away.
[29:43] But there's something
[29:47] about
[29:49] that. Let's worship him now. Sing it
[29:52] again.
[29:55] Oh Jesus.
[29:57] [Music]
[29:59] Jesus.
[30:02] My Jesus.
[30:07] There's just something
[30:10] about
[30:12] that name.
[30:19] Master,
[30:22] Savior
[30:25] Jesus.
[30:30] Like the brains
[30:34] after
[30:36] the rain.
[30:39] [Music]
[30:42] Oh Jesus,
[30:45] Jesus.
[30:48] Jesus.
[30:53] Let all heaven
[30:57] and earth
[30:59] proclaim.
[31:04] [Music]
[31:06] Kings
[31:08] and kingdoms
[31:11] shall all
[31:13] pass away.
[31:16] Oh, there's something
[31:20] about
[31:22] that king.
[31:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. That line says, "Kings
[31:28] and kingdoms will all pass away." They
[31:30] might not be a king. They may be a
[31:32] proposed president, a dictator,
[31:34] whatever. All those kingdoms are going
[31:35] to fade and pass away. I don't care what
[31:37] kind of power they flex or say, "Oh,
[31:39] we've got this arsenal or that arsenal.
[31:41] We can outdo you." It's all going to
[31:44] fail. and they're just instruments in
[31:46] God's hands. Amen. Amen. There's a
[31:48] couple announcements we need to make
[31:51] concerning u a little bit of a date
[31:53] correction. This little fall festival
[31:56] thing that we're going to have this uh
[31:58] for the children, the families of young
[32:00] children, Sunday school, uh will be
[32:03] October the 18th. Okay, brother David
[32:05] continues to say the 19th, but the
[32:08] Saturday preceding the 19th, the 18th is
[32:10] the day we're going to do that. So, and
[32:13] then also after service,
[32:16] uh this is the last call for the lost
[32:18] and found items that we've already made
[32:21] announcements before. They're going to
[32:22] be in the little best Bule outside in
[32:24] the hallway. When you go out those
[32:26] double doors, just sift through those,
[32:29] find something that's yours, you can
[32:30] claim it and take it. If not, it will be
[32:33] donated. So, today is the last call on
[32:35] the lost and found. Okay.
[32:38] Um
[32:40] our sister put in a prayer request.
[32:41] Sister Zomada, I think her name is.
[32:45] Pardon sister if I mispronounced that.
[32:46] We want to pray for her her father who
[32:49] will undergo surgery this coming
[32:50] Tuesday. Juan Pablo is his name and she
[32:53] asked God bless you all. So,
[32:56] uh, my daughter, Sister Joy, is not up
[32:58] here on the platform this morning. She
[32:59] has strained her right wrist and would
[33:01] like some prayer for that. She's just
[33:03] trying to get it completely healed
[33:05] before she gets back in service. And
[33:07] then brother Inten
[33:09] Inten from Colorado, Denver, Colorado,
[33:12] lost his son. So we want to remember him
[33:14] in prayer. All right. All right. If we
[33:17] could, let's just all stand and give
[33:18] reverence. And brother Jose, would you
[33:20] mind coming and asking the Lord's
[33:21] blessings on that?

[43:33] How great th
[43:35] [Music]
[43:36] great.
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:46] How wonderful.
[43:49] You know, I was dwelling on uh
[43:53] the idea of what language will we all
[43:56] communicate with uh for eternity. And uh
[44:00] you know, there's such music and
[44:01] language, you know, I love the Spanish
[44:03] language and uh and even French. It has
[44:07] a lip to it and a cadence and and you
[44:09] really enjoy that.
[44:10] when they sang that last chorus there.
[44:13] When you know the meaning, it makes a
[44:15] difference. And I'm thankful that the
[44:18] Lord knows all languages. Doesn't matter
[44:21] the uh the earnings, the yearnings of
[44:23] our heart and the groanings, he
[44:25] understands that as well. Amen. Amen.
[44:28] And uh we're getting ready now to uh
[44:31] turn our hearts to the word. And I just
[44:33] feel like Elijah
[44:35] when he was on the top of Mount Carmel
[44:37] actually he was he was still down in the
[44:39] valley. It says after he had slayed the
[44:41] prophets of Jezebel and
[44:46] he said I hear the sound of abundance of
[44:48] rain
[44:51] and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
[44:54] and he went to the top of Mount Carmel.
[44:56] He put his head between his knees and he
[44:58] told his servant says go check for a
[45:00] cloud. go look. And he said he looked
[45:02] out toward the sea and there was
[45:03] nothing. He said, "Go seven times." He
[45:06] came back on the seventh time. Well,
[45:07] there arises out of the to see a little
[45:08] cloud the size of a man's hand.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; It's happening. Whether we realize it or
[45:14] not, it's happening.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things going on. He
[45:18] told he said, "Tell Ahab to get up." He
[45:21] said, "Arise, get thee up, eat, and
[45:23] drink."
[45:24] And he said, "Prepare his chariot." And
[45:26] said, "Don't let the rain stop you." And
[45:28] I believe it's the last miracle
[45:30] performed uh on or with Elijah. The
[45:34] Bible says that Ahab took off on his
[45:37] chair and he said, "Don't stop for the
[45:38] rain." He headed to the gates of
[45:40] Jezrael.
[45:42] The Bible says the hand of the Lord was
[45:45] upon Elijah.
[45:47] Amen.
[45:51] And he he put his mantel about him,
[45:53] girded his loins, and he took off. And
[45:55] he beat Ahab to the gates of Jezrael.
[45:58] The Bible says he overtook him and beat
[46:00] him to the He outran a horse and
[46:01] chariot. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name
[46:04] of the Lord. He's going to get us out of
[46:06] here before the first bomb will fall.
[46:08] Amen. Let's sing. Think about his love.
[46:10] Think about his love before I get
[46:12] longwinded and try to take over the
[46:14] preacher's job. But we got brother Billy
[46:16] prepared and he's going to bring us a
[46:17] good message. Let's enter in and worship
[46:20] the Lord.
[46:23] You know, tithe and offering is a part
[46:24] of worship. Sing is a part of worship,
[46:26] but it's all a preparation for what's
[46:28] coming next. Amen.
[46:31] Oh, think about his love
[46:37] and think about his goodness.
[46:44] will think about his grace
[46:50] that's brought us through.
[46:57] For as high as the heavens above,
[47:04] so great is the measure
[47:08] of our father's love.
[47:16] [Music]
[47:17] Oh, praise and
[47:21] of our father.
[47:27] [Music]
[47:29] Oh, think about his love
[47:35] and think about his goodness.
[47:39] [Music]
[47:42] Think about his grace. While we were yet
[47:46] sinners, Christ died for us that brought
[47:49] us through.
[47:52] [Music]
[47:55] For as high as the heavens above,
[48:02] so great is the measure
[48:07] of our father's
[48:10] love.
[48:14] [Music]
[48:16] Great is the measure
[48:20] of our father. Let's sing it one more
[48:23] time.
[48:25] [Music]
[48:27] Oh, think about his love.
[48:34] Think about his goodness.
[48:38] [Music]
[48:40] Think about his grace. Think on these
[48:44] things
[48:46] that's brought us through.
[48:52] [Music]
[48:53] For as high as the heavens are,
[49:00] so
[49:01] great is the measure
[49:05] of our
[49:08] love.
[49:10] [Music]
[49:14] Praise the
[49:19] Father.
[49:21] Let's sing Sweep Over My Soul. As
[49:23] brother Billy comes, we sing Sweep Over
[49:25] My Soul. Can we all stand together?
[49:28] Oh, sweep over
[49:31] my soul.
[49:34] Sweep over
[49:37] my soul.
[49:38] [Music]
[49:40] Sweet peace,
[49:43] sweep over
[49:45] my soul.
[49:50] For my rest
[49:53] is complete.
[49:56] While I sing
[49:59] at your feet,
[50:01] sweet spirit,
[50:04] sweep over
[50:07] my soul.
[50:10] [Music]
[50:12] Oh, sweep over
[50:15] my soul.
[50:18] Sweep over
[50:20] my soul.
[50:23] Sweet spirit.
[50:26] sweep over
[50:28] my soul.
[50:34] My rest
[50:37] is complete
[50:39] while I sing.
[50:42] [Music]
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Oh sweet spirit.
[50:48] Oh sweep over.
[50:51] Why don't we just sing it one more time?
[50:52] Sweep over my soul this morning. Oh, as
[50:56] sweet
[50:59] my soul.
[51:01] Sweep over
[51:04] my soul.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, sweet spirit praise.
[51:10] Sweep over
[51:12] my soul.
[51:17] And my grace
[51:20] is complete.
[51:23] By the se
[51:26] at your feet,
[51:28] sweet spirit,
[51:32] sweep over
[51:34] my soul.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Is that your heart desire this morning?
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We certainly want to be. We gather
[51:44] in his presence and we're here to hear
[51:46] from him. And uh I believe he will speak
[51:49] to us this morning. He said, "Where two
[51:51] or three I gather in my name, I'll be in
[51:53] the midst." Amen. We want to welcome all
[51:55] our visitors this morning. Brother Gary,
[51:57] Sister Barbara, it's good to see you.
[51:59] All of those that are visiting this
[52:00] morning, remembering as Brother David,
[52:02] uh, Brother Tim mentioned, Brother David
[52:05] and Sister Lesie as they are at the
[52:07] memorial service, and I know there are
[52:09] some of the deacons and brothers that
[52:11] are at the men's meeting. So, want to
[52:13] remember them. Let's just bow our heads
[52:14] this morning. Our gracious father, we're
[52:16] so thankful to be gather in your
[52:18] presence.
[52:20] Lord Jesus, what if it wasn't for you,
[52:22] Lord, where would we be this morning?
[52:25] Father, your word even said that, Lord,
[52:28] bless the Lord, oh my soul, forget not
[52:30] all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thy
[52:33] iniquity and health all thy diseases.
[52:36] Lord, we can certainly gather this
[52:38] morning and know that all that we have
[52:41] need of, you've taken care of it, Lord.
[52:43] Lord, we've come to honor the
[52:45] resurrection this morning, Lord. We may
[52:48] not have much but we want to know let
[52:50] everybody know which side we are on. The
[52:53] side of the Lord Jesus who died and he
[52:56] gave his life for us Lord. We believe
[52:58] that you promised that there was to be a
[53:00] life's transfer that the same life that
[53:03] raised you from the dead will also be in
[53:05] the believers Lord. And we are here as
[53:08] those that have partaken have tasted of
[53:10] that life Lord. And we cry out this
[53:13] morning and say Lord we want more of
[53:15] that life in us. Lord, come and speak to
[53:17] us the words of life. And Father, we
[53:20] know that men's word can kill, but your
[53:23] word will give life. And and we we don't
[53:26] desire to just speak as a man and speak
[53:28] the words of men. But Lord, we desire
[53:31] this morning to stand upon the unfailing
[53:34] word of God and speak the promises which
[53:36] you've made us, you've made for us for
[53:39] this generation that it may bring life
[53:41] unto us. We commit the service to you.
[53:44] We ask that you be with us at this
[53:46] moment. Father, guide our lips and our
[53:48] minds that it may be focused on you at
[53:50] this moment. We ask this in the name of
[53:52] the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[53:56] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[53:57] God. Amen. How many appreciate brother
[53:59] Tim this morning?
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm
[54:04] Amen.
[54:06] Amen. I like those good old songs. Amen.
[54:09] Amen. They make you feel alive. It's
[54:11] not, you know, just some of those little
[54:14] songs that sometimes, but I like some of
[54:16] those good ones that just, you know,
[54:18] reminds us so much of what God has done
[54:20] for us through the ages. Amen. Why don't
[54:22] we open our Bibles this morning, Isaiah
[54:26] 53, a very familiar scripture reading.
[54:29] We'll read a little bit. We'll sit and
[54:30] then we'll continue on uh later on.
[54:37] Amen.
[54:48] It says, "Who had believed our report
[54:51] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[54:53] revealed?" How many can say me?
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've believed the report. For he
[55:00] shall grow up before him as a tender
[55:04] plant and as the root out of the dry
[55:07] ground. He had no form, no comeliness.
[55:12] And when we shall see him, there's no
[55:16] beauty that we should desire him. He is
[55:19] despised and rejected of men, a man of
[55:23] sorrow and acquainted with grief.
[55:26] and we hid as it were our face from him.
[55:31] He was despised and we esteem him not.
[55:35] Surely he had borne our griefs and
[55:39] carried our sorrow. Yet we did esteem
[55:43] him stricken, smitten of God and
[55:46] afflicted.
[55:48] But he was wounded for our
[55:50] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[55:53] iniquity. The chastisement of our peace
[55:56] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[55:59] healed. Father, we ask that you bless
[56:01] your word to us this morning. In the
[56:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask.
[56:05] Amen. God bless. You may have your seats
[56:07] this morning.
[56:15] I want to speak this morning and
[56:19] desiring to not be too long and desiring
[56:22] to just uh speak something that's been
[56:25] on my heart uh following the some of the
[56:28] services that we have heard from the
[56:31] brothers preach from our own pastor
[56:33] preach and and and just something has
[56:36] been in my heart um and especially for
[56:40] myself and I I believe the the really
[56:42] the first person you should preach to is
[56:44] yourself. And and this is just something
[56:47] that's been in my heart. I know Brother
[56:49] David preached on um uh faith in our
[56:52] dying, faith in death and in our death
[56:57] and and taking side with Jesus. We we
[57:00] heard that. I listened to the tapes and
[57:02] he made some comment. Uh then uh uh uh
[57:07] brother Benoya came and preached uh
[57:09] being Jesus to somebody. Amen. And then
[57:12] brother Paul last Wednesday they
[57:15] preached on being members of the family
[57:17] and the benefit of being part of the
[57:19] family. And then just just been on my
[57:22] heart and and I believe the best way as
[57:25] Christians to do is to always apply the
[57:27] word to yourself and and and desire to
[57:30] be a better Christian. desire that how
[57:33] we can best apply the word to oursel not
[57:36] to other people ourselves first because
[57:39] I believe you know Barbana will say many
[57:41] times God only need one person
[57:45] it only takes one person to be on fire
[57:47] it only takes one person to actually be
[57:50] changed to affect the others so when we
[57:53] hear we apply it to ourselves so we be
[57:55] the one that would first be changed so
[57:58] that change can also be applied or
[58:01] viewed food uh by others or even desired
[58:04] by others. So I was reading this and we
[58:07] didn't read the whole scripture uh but
[58:10] we'll read it in a moment. Um uh Isaiah
[58:13] 53 but Brandham uses this scripture to
[58:16] preach a message called the masterpiece.
[58:19] The identify masterpiece is where
[58:21] actually I get my inspiration from. And
[58:24] what I want to title this is uh the uh
[58:27] God bringing forth his masterpiece image
[58:31] and also uh God's process of building
[58:35] his masterpiece.
[58:37] I I I would just try to uh spend a
[58:40] little more time on the actual process
[58:44] because I believe uh even in looking at
[58:46] it from what we have heard I believe
[58:49] this will be very helpful uh to us as a
[58:53] as a group as a body even as an
[58:55] individual to to apply in our own life.
[58:57] So we find out that we what we call we
[59:02] are called in this end time brother will
[59:04] say that we are called to be uh God's
[59:07] image projected to this generation. We
[59:10] are called to be God's image. We are
[59:12] called uh to be the very thoughts of God
[59:16] manifested for the generation that we
[59:18] are living in. That's the message of the
[59:20] hour. Uh that's what we believe and and
[59:24] that's the promise for this age. And
[59:27] there is no other promises. The promises
[59:30] of this age is that Jesus will be
[59:33] manifested to a group of people even as
[59:35] we sing the song that come from east and
[59:37] west. That God will gather up a people
[59:39] for his own name's sake. That he will
[59:42] manifest himself to that people. The
[59:45] same way he did with the Jews, he will
[59:47] do with the Gentile. If you go read the
[59:50] history of the Bible, there's never I've
[59:52] always been amazed how that the Jews uh
[59:56] the how that they anchor the desire and
[59:59] everything about them was for the coming
[1:00:01] of the Messiah. Uh it didn't matter what
[1:00:04] condition they found theel themselves
[1:00:06] in. You can go from Genesis all the way
[1:00:09] to the end. They always believe in the
[1:00:12] promise of Messiah. You can go through
[1:00:15] the Jews and you can go even through the
[1:00:16] very Samaritan. Regardless of what was
[1:00:19] happening, whether they were in bondage,
[1:00:20] whether they were in Egypt, they knew
[1:00:23] that there was a promise of the Messiah
[1:00:25] to come someday. And I believe that same
[1:00:27] promise has been made to us by the New
[1:00:30] Testament that we shall also receive the
[1:00:33] promise of the Messiah in this age. And
[1:00:35] I believe God has made himself known
[1:00:38] unto us like never before in the
[1:00:40] generation that we are living in. So we
[1:00:43] are called, we can certainly say we are
[1:00:45] called, we are called to be the elected
[1:00:49] chosen bride of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:52] And we are called to be out of the world
[1:00:56] and into the bright age. That's the
[1:00:59] message of the hour. And the reason for
[1:01:02] that is because the prophet don't want
[1:01:03] us to be those that will wonder not know
[1:01:07] what time you're living in, what
[1:01:08] generation you're living in, what is
[1:01:10] your message for your hour because that
[1:01:13] becomes important because it's the only
[1:01:16] thing that God will accept.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; It becomes the only way in. Everything
[1:01:22] else becomes just a noise or a way to
[1:01:25] have a good time. And the only way in it
[1:01:28] becomes the provided way for your age
[1:01:31] that you are living in. And uh and and
[1:01:34] we can say the scripture will speak in
[1:01:36] uh Ephesians 2 and 10. It says for we
[1:01:39] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:01:43] Jesus unto good works that which is uh
[1:01:47] which God had for ordained that we
[1:01:50] should walk in them. Now I want to say
[1:01:52] this as the scripture says we are
[1:01:54] created. We are his workmanship. Even as
[1:01:58] we gather here we'll believe with all of
[1:02:00] our hearts that we are God's creation.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; We are created for the workmanship of
[1:02:07] God and not of the devil.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; That's our identification in the hour
[1:02:13] that we are living in. I have been
[1:02:15] created to praise God. I have been
[1:02:18] created to be a Christian. I have been
[1:02:21] created to live a life that's pleasing
[1:02:24] to the one who created me. I've not been
[1:02:26] created to be an instrument to the
[1:02:28] devil. I've not been created to dwell in
[1:02:32] sin day in and day out and do the things
[1:02:34] of the world and not be satisfied. My
[1:02:37] satisfaction is that I have been created
[1:02:41] by God and for God.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; We we we need to have that understanding
[1:02:48] every day when we wake up. I am a
[1:02:50] Christian because God created me. In
[1:02:53] fact, not just even Christian. I am
[1:02:55] alive. I am an individual created by the
[1:02:59] power of God to serve God.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Not to serve the devil. Not to take my
[1:03:04] life and use it for things that are of
[1:03:06] no value. But so that when all is said
[1:03:09] and done, I'm living a Christian life in
[1:03:12] my life. Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; It says in Peter uh uh 1 Peter 2:9, it
[1:03:18] says, "But ye are a chosen generation, a
[1:03:22] royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[1:03:25] peculiar people." You are not created to
[1:03:29] be like everybody else.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; You need to embrace that. You are not
[1:03:34] created to be like the world. You are
[1:03:36] created to be different. And God created
[1:03:39] you to be different so that in your
[1:03:42] difference you will worship him in the
[1:03:45] way that you are. Oh, like brother Tim
[1:03:47] said, "Oh, I don't have a good voice."
[1:03:49] God wants to hear your voice. Whether
[1:03:51] it's good or not, he created you. He's
[1:03:54] the one that gave you that voice. He
[1:03:56] wants to hear it. But if you would shut
[1:03:58] down your voice because another one is
[1:04:00] better, then you are failing the mission
[1:04:02] that God created you.
[1:04:05] and whatever manner of God means you.
[1:04:07] That's why I was saying I was telling
[1:04:08] brother David the other day. I said, "Oh
[1:04:10] my, if God made me, if I had the ability
[1:04:13] to shout and jump and and jump on this
[1:04:16] pulpit, I'll do it.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; If God created me to be that way, I'll
[1:04:21] be what God created me to be. I don't
[1:04:23] want to be ashamed because I'm around
[1:04:25] people to act in a manner that I was not
[1:04:28] created. I want to be free. I want to be
[1:04:31] free in the presence of God or wherever
[1:04:33] I find myself to express exactly what
[1:04:36] God called me to be. Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; I one one thing I love about our pastor
[1:04:42] even our gathering we such a gathering
[1:04:44] of so many different places
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; and and we've always cultivated the the
[1:04:50] the the culture the atmosphere that it
[1:04:53] doesn't matter what language you speak
[1:04:55] where you come from that you should feel
[1:04:58] free in the presence of the Lord not to
[1:05:01] feel like well I have to act like the
[1:05:03] other one but whatever you are whatever
[1:05:05] God made you wherever you come from in
[1:05:07] your own tongue, in your own language,
[1:05:09] in your own culture, you will praise him
[1:05:13] for the glory of what he's done for you.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; United together for the purpose, one
[1:05:18] purpose and that is to worship him.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; So we find out that as we speak, we we
[1:05:25] we have a goal. We know what we are here
[1:05:27] for. So when in this message but when
[1:05:30] I'm we'll speak about the masterpiece.
[1:05:32] Now the very definition of a masterpiece
[1:05:34] is a work and an outstanding artistry or
[1:05:38] a skill or a workmanship. It's a when
[1:05:42] you look at at something and and you see
[1:05:45] the details. You know, many times you'll
[1:05:47] see painting and and those that know how
[1:05:49] to appreciate it will look at the stroke
[1:05:52] and the thing around it and just know,
[1:05:54] oh, this is so beautiful and everything
[1:05:57] and within it it has the very uh
[1:06:00] character and nature of the artist that
[1:06:03] painted it, you can look and see and
[1:06:05] people that knows art and and some of us
[1:06:08] can look at it, we don't see anything.
[1:06:10] But yet it's a masterpiece because the
[1:06:13] and the only way you can learn to
[1:06:15] appreciate it is to get into the the
[1:06:19] understanding of the art and know the
[1:06:21] understanding of the one that painted it
[1:06:22] for you to become appreciative of it.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; But what I'm will make a statement in it
[1:06:27] in this and it will say that the trouble
[1:06:30] with us is sometimes that our very
[1:06:32] definition of masterpiece is completely
[1:06:36] opposite with what God will call a
[1:06:38] masterpiece.
[1:06:40] when when we think even what the the
[1:06:43] scripture speaks about uh uh what we are
[1:06:46] to be even as I said this morning we'll
[1:06:48] find out that uh h understanding
[1:06:52] sometimes is oh we ought to be uh this
[1:06:54] glamour and greatness and oh we we ought
[1:06:58] to be the final voice to the final
[1:07:00] church and and in our minds we will uh
[1:07:03] somehow paint even an image that doesn't
[1:07:05] necessarily exist and we'll think about
[1:07:08] uh uh uh as just a situation where every
[1:07:12] time we open our mouth and we just speak
[1:07:14] the word and things happen everywhere
[1:07:15] along the way or we'll just uh uh call
[1:07:18] things that are not as though they were
[1:07:20] even though that's true but we we forget
[1:07:23] to understand within what framework God
[1:07:26] is trying to bring that masterpiece
[1:07:28] I
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; and he's warning us because we we if we
[1:07:32] are not careful we take the promises we
[1:07:35] run ahead of God we build our own
[1:07:38] imagery And we don't see that happen and
[1:07:40] we get discouraged. But let me say this,
[1:07:42] God has never been left without a
[1:07:45] witness. When God gives his word, God is
[1:07:48] on interpreter. He brings forth the
[1:07:50] interpretation so you would know what is
[1:07:53] it that you need to look after or to
[1:07:55] look for.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So when God definition of the
[1:07:59] masterpiece comes is very precise on
[1:08:02] what is supposed to do or what is
[1:08:04] supposed to be. So and and the the
[1:08:08] scripture will tell us even that here we
[1:08:10] are it says that what God call great men
[1:08:13] calls foolish.
[1:08:17] What God call great men call foolish.
[1:08:20] And it will say that God will even use
[1:08:22] the simple things to confound the wise.
[1:08:26] Why is it that way? Because God didn't
[1:08:28] want us to have the understanding even
[1:08:31] of what we will to be by some type of
[1:08:34] intellectual understanding. But it's by
[1:08:36] revelation and the revelation of
[1:08:39] understanding that God pattern never
[1:08:42] breaks from revelation all from Genesis
[1:08:45] all the way to Revelation that is always
[1:08:47] the same. We can look at what happened
[1:08:50] in the past and see that it's the same
[1:08:52] God walking along with us. He doesn't
[1:08:55] want us to have some type of
[1:08:56] denominational understanding of these
[1:08:59] promises, but he want to quicken it by
[1:09:02] revelation so we can come into the
[1:09:05] understanding of what he says. In 1
[1:09:07] Corinthians 1:27 it say but God has
[1:09:11] chosen the foolish things of the world
[1:09:13] to confound the wise and God has chosen
[1:09:16] the weak things
[1:09:18] not the strong things but the weak
[1:09:21] things of the world to confound the
[1:09:24] things that which are which are mighty.
[1:09:27] So what we call great God call foolish.
[1:09:31] So we we that's why it's important that
[1:09:35] our definition of the masterpiece or or
[1:09:38] our definition of what we ought to be is
[1:09:41] derived from the scripture by revelation
[1:09:44] and not our own interpretation of what's
[1:09:47] been said.
[1:09:50] When you look at it, even as we read
[1:09:53] in Isaiah 53,
[1:09:56] God now is trying to define the very
[1:10:00] masterpiece that he wants to create. He
[1:10:04] said he had no form, no comeliness
[1:10:08] that when we see him, there's no beauty
[1:10:11] that we should desire him. Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; When when you when the image when God
[1:10:18] now is building his own masterpiece,
[1:10:21] when he's now giving you what this image
[1:10:24] of this masterpiece is, he's saying that
[1:10:27] there won't be any beauty that you
[1:10:28] should desire him. He's saying that he's
[1:10:31] despised and rejected of men. He's a man
[1:10:35] of sorrow. He's acquainted with grief.
[1:10:38] And it says and we uh as it it were we
[1:10:42] hid our face from him. He was despised
[1:10:45] and esteem we esteem him not. Surely he
[1:10:49] has borne our grieavves and carried our
[1:10:52] sorrow. And yet we esteemed him
[1:10:55] stricken. Oh smitten of God. How many
[1:10:59] times you go back in the Old Testament
[1:11:01] and you you read the story of Job and
[1:11:03] others. They looked at him the very
[1:11:05] masterpiece of God that God was building
[1:11:08] and men looked at him and said you are a
[1:11:10] sacred sinner you must have done
[1:11:12] something wrong that's why God rejected
[1:11:14] why their imagery of what the
[1:11:16] masterpiece was to be was completely
[1:11:20] wrong was derived from their own
[1:11:23] intellectual understanding and not from
[1:11:26] God's pattern of the scripture
[1:11:29] he says he was wounded for our
[1:11:31] transgression I love this He was bruised
[1:11:34] for our iniquity. The chastisement of
[1:11:37] our peace was upon him and with his
[1:11:39] stripes we were healed. It says all we
[1:11:43] like sheep have gone astray. We have
[1:11:46] turned everyone to his own way and the
[1:11:51] Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us
[1:11:55] all. So the masterpiece
[1:11:57] God takes what you did wrong and delays
[1:12:01] upon him. The masterpiece is one that
[1:12:04] can take the the pain of others, what
[1:12:07] what others have done wrong, where they
[1:12:09] need to be accused and die, and yet he
[1:12:12] produces life out of it. One that will
[1:12:14] take and and and the situation, he
[1:12:17] didn't do any wrong. He's the only one
[1:12:19] who had the right kid to condemn, but
[1:12:21] yet he was the one that was stricken
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; for us all. And then it will say, "And
[1:12:26] he was oppressed."
[1:12:29] He was oppressed and and he was
[1:12:31] afflicted and yet he opened not his
[1:12:33] mouth. He says he was brought as a lamb
[1:12:37] to the slaughter and the sheep before
[1:12:39] her shear as a dumb. He opened not his
[1:12:43] mouth. He says he was taken from prison
[1:12:46] and from judgment and he and and who
[1:12:49] shall declare his generation. Let me say
[1:12:53] this. He was not the only one because
[1:12:56] here God is promising that who is going
[1:12:58] to declare the generation of such man.
[1:13:01] The generation of a people that desire
[1:13:05] to take what the word of God said there
[1:13:07] would be. The one that will take the
[1:13:09] pain of others and take it away. The one
[1:13:12] that will look at a situation and and
[1:13:14] try to bring peace into it. The one that
[1:13:16] will look and and even though they are
[1:13:19] not wrong, they would accept to take the
[1:13:21] sin of others so they can p purge them.
[1:13:24] Those that could be like brother Benoa
[1:13:26] said Jesus to the others.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There is such a
[1:13:31] generation he promised they will come.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because if the same spirit that was
[1:13:36] in Jesus is also in you, it will also
[1:13:39] quicken your mortal body. It will
[1:13:42] produce the same works that he did. It
[1:13:44] will produce the same generation in the
[1:13:47] time that we are living in.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; That's the that's the masterpiece that
[1:13:52] we are talking about.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; He said he was cut off out of the land
[1:13:56] of the living for transgression of my
[1:13:59] people and it was shricken.
[1:14:02] He says he was he he has made his grave
[1:14:05] with the wicked and with the rich in his
[1:14:08] death because he had done no no e no no
[1:14:12] no no no violence neither shall he
[1:14:14] deceive neither there is deceive in his
[1:14:18] mouth
[1:14:19] yet it pleased the Lord to bruce him he
[1:14:23] had put him to grieve
[1:14:26] when now shall make his soul an offering
[1:14:28] to sin he shall see I said and he shall
[1:14:32] see his seed and shall prolong in days
[1:14:36] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:14:37] prosper in his hand. But what I'm said
[1:14:40] in a message smearing a church age says
[1:14:43] what why does God why does God stand by?
[1:14:47] It says the reason is in Romans 8:17. He
[1:14:51] says, "And if a children then heir of
[1:14:56] God and join air." So now he he's
[1:15:00] talking about uh what actually what it
[1:15:04] takes to bring you to a place where you
[1:15:06] are actually in the position where you
[1:15:09] can rule. What it will take for you to
[1:15:11] become this masterpiece that can
[1:15:14] actually be put to work. So now he's
[1:15:16] talking and it says, "And if so be it
[1:15:19] that we suffer with him while we may be
[1:15:21] so also glorified with him. For I reckon
[1:15:24] that the suffering of this present time
[1:15:26] is not worthy to be compared with the
[1:15:28] glory that shall be revealed in us.
[1:15:31] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:15:34] reign with him." Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; But I say so people we have designed a
[1:15:39] Christianity in the end time that is
[1:15:42] void of every trial that's void of every
[1:15:45] suffering. Our our picture of being the
[1:15:48] bride Christ is that we just speak the
[1:15:51] word and it happens to come and if we
[1:15:53] speak it takes two seconds to come that
[1:15:55] means he didn't answer. We we there's no
[1:15:58] suffering at all. There's no commitment.
[1:16:01] There's no perseverance. and and and
[1:16:04] said that's not even the image of the
[1:16:06] original. The original is built with
[1:16:09] resistance.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; We we we become those uh we pray two
[1:16:14] seconds if it doesn't come we go on
[1:16:17] praying onto somebody else and we pray
[1:16:19] and all of the sudden if something
[1:16:21] happened we don't even know if it's God
[1:16:23] or if it's not God that gave it to us.
[1:16:26] Why? Because that was not part of the
[1:16:29] original. That's not how the masterpiece
[1:16:32] was built.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. And
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; and I want to say this, it's very
[1:16:36] important. That's not how the
[1:16:39] masterpiece is built. The masterpiece is
[1:16:42] built in suffering. The masterpiece is
[1:16:45] is built in waiting. The masterpiece is
[1:16:47] built in perseverance. That if God said
[1:16:50] it, I'm not going to move until it
[1:16:52] happens. If God said, I'm not going
[1:16:55] anywhere until it happens. If God
[1:16:57] promised to change my life, I'm not
[1:17:00] going anywhere until I see that change.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Now, the the the challenge of it, and
[1:17:08] we'll get to it, is we we can't stand
[1:17:11] still long enough. God don't want you to
[1:17:14] move to and fro. He wants you to stand
[1:17:17] upon his word and don't move. Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you just remember that, I'll
[1:17:25] repeat that in a moment again. He wants
[1:17:27] you to stand still and don't move. Don't
[1:17:30] move until he makes it happen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; We we were talking with the brothers. We
[1:17:36] watched the videos of of the deep call
[1:17:39] unto the deep. We saw him here. The
[1:17:42] prophet, he knew that he had a promise.
[1:17:45] God told him that you go through this
[1:17:47] that I will come. And he stood there for
[1:17:49] about an hour and a half
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; just talking and wondering and and you
[1:17:54] can feel the atmosphere in the room just
[1:17:57] getting very tense and maybe people
[1:18:00] wondering when is this going to happen?
[1:18:02] What's going on? But he stood there. He
[1:18:05] didn't make up anything. He continued to
[1:18:08] just talk and talk and talk and he said
[1:18:10] perhaps if I done something wrong
[1:18:12] forgive me. Perhaps I said something to
[1:18:14] grieve him. And all of the sudden he
[1:18:17] came. My brother, my sister, he's not
[1:18:19] going to come if you keep moving back
[1:18:21] and forth. He wants you to stand firm
[1:18:24] like the saints of all to say, "I'll
[1:18:27] stand here until the Lord does it."
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; That's how character is built.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Character is not built in somebody two
[1:18:36] minutes here, two minutes over there,
[1:18:38] but one that can stand for the results,
[1:18:40] stand there until it comes to pass.
[1:18:49] So when we see this characteristics of
[1:18:55] this masterpiece and
[1:18:58] he was only interested in one thing.
[1:19:02] What what is the father desire for my
[1:19:04] life?
[1:19:05] What is it that the father actually
[1:19:07] desire for me to bring out of my life?
[1:19:11] He but the scripture says that he did
[1:19:13] nothing except what the father showed
[1:19:16] him. He was in but one of them said one
[1:19:19] place he said he was so one with the
[1:19:22] word until he became the word. Now we
[1:19:26] understand at another place he said it
[1:19:28] was the word but I thought it was so
[1:19:30] important that he says that because
[1:19:32] that's where we come here. We can become
[1:19:35] one with what was spoken until we become
[1:19:38] that which was spoken.
[1:19:42] We can be so one with this word of God,
[1:19:46] with the promises of our time until we
[1:19:49] become that very word that was spoken
[1:19:51] coming to pass.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He He did nothing and his desire was to
[1:19:58] please the father.
[1:20:00] He had no agenda of his own.
[1:20:04] He he didn't care about what people were
[1:20:06] going to think about him. He didn't
[1:20:09] care. He was not in the business of
[1:20:11] pleasing people. He was in the business
[1:20:13] of doing one thing alone and that was to
[1:20:16] be about the father's business. When you
[1:20:19] go read this, but when I'm talks about
[1:20:21] where the inspiration of this message
[1:20:23] came from and he was to go um he said uh
[1:20:26] that he never meet uh this lady um um uh
[1:20:30] Amy Simple McFerson. They said they
[1:20:32] actually never met her and that uh he
[1:20:35] knew his son and he had preached there
[1:20:38] and so he was down and he heard about
[1:20:40] and he was you know just thanking God
[1:20:42] for her life and they took her to the
[1:20:44] place is called Forest Lawn. I've
[1:20:46] actually visited the head of the
[1:20:47] opportunity to go visit that place. And
[1:20:50] so when you get in, you actually see the
[1:20:52] very statue that that that statue that
[1:20:55] talks about the Moses statue that
[1:20:57] Brennanom uses for the inspiration. And
[1:20:59] if you go, you'll see that statue of
[1:21:01] Moses that that he's talking about. He
[1:21:04] will talk about the story of
[1:21:05] Michelangelo, how that he was uh he was
[1:21:09] there, he got inspired to build Moses
[1:21:12] statue and then he came and he took a a
[1:21:15] a piece of marble and he took and he he
[1:21:18] build it and he build it and the the the
[1:21:20] the story goes that he was so inspired
[1:21:23] that statue were built by so much
[1:21:25] inspiration until when he was done he he
[1:21:29] took a a hammer and he struck it on the
[1:21:31] knee and he said speak Why? Because he
[1:21:35] was it was so real to him what he did.
[1:21:37] It was so real and he was surprised. He
[1:21:40] he he actually so was so real to him
[1:21:43] that he expected that statue to speak
[1:21:45] and move.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; That's where the inspiration came from.
[1:21:53] And he said when I heard it, I stood
[1:21:55] there. He said I walked away a little
[1:21:56] bit and then my mind just started going.
[1:21:59] And and I just want for the sake of
[1:22:01] illustration, ver if you could just come
[1:22:03] up for a moment. Yeah.
[1:22:07] So I want you to just picture this with
[1:22:11] me for a moment. Like I said, I don't
[1:22:12] want to be too long this morning. So
[1:22:15] there and and and and the prophet uses
[1:22:18] it to illustrate what God was doing.
[1:22:22] Now, the first thing I want you to
[1:22:24] realize is the inspiration
[1:22:28] was not the block's inspiration. It was
[1:22:31] Michelangelo inspiration.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And but one of them said he didn't even
[1:22:35] write it on the paper. He said he had
[1:22:37] that image in his mind for years.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; For years. He knew what he wanted at the
[1:22:44] end. So, I want you to picture me as
[1:22:47] Michelangelo and my brother here as the
[1:22:49] block. And in the sense of God, I am the
[1:22:53] one with the inspiration. And this is
[1:22:55] the block that has to become the image.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to realize that it's
[1:23:01] very important that even if he knew what
[1:23:05] I was bringing him into, he couldn't
[1:23:07] bring that himself.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; You with me this morning? Don't I? And I
[1:23:12] I said I'm not going to be long, so
[1:23:14] let's just write together. Let's all get
[1:23:16] together so we can get to it really
[1:23:18] fast. He cannot I can tell him that
[1:23:21] within you there is an image of my of
[1:23:25] Moses. Within you there is the image of
[1:23:27] the bride. He in himself he has no power
[1:23:31] to bring that image to come to pass. He
[1:23:34] needed Michelangelo to bring that that
[1:23:37] image to come to pass.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? So the
[1:23:41] same way we are sitting here a preacher
[1:23:44] can tell you that you are a son of God.
[1:23:46] You were elected before the foundation
[1:23:48] of the world. You were with God in the
[1:23:51] beginning. I cannot make that image come
[1:23:53] to pass. God has to make that image come
[1:23:56] to pass to you. You have to receive and
[1:23:59] believe the inspiration that in this
[1:24:02] generation we have received a man who
[1:24:05] had the mind of God, the original image
[1:24:07] of what God wants to do. And let me say
[1:24:10] this, if that inspiration fall upon
[1:24:13] Picasso or upon uh uh uh Dainci or some
[1:24:18] that it was never going to produce the
[1:24:20] same image.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; The image was to come by one messenger,
[1:24:25] by one person, the one who was inspired
[1:24:28] by God to bring a bride in the same
[1:24:31] time. Not a preacher, not a pastor, but
[1:24:34] one messenger for this generation to
[1:24:37] bring forth the image of the bride. And
[1:24:40] let me say this, that's the only image
[1:24:42] God will accept.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; No other image. You can build your own
[1:24:49] image. It's not acceptable. You can
[1:24:51] build your own religion. It's not
[1:24:53] acceptable. What you need is the message
[1:24:56] of the hour. What you need is to
[1:24:58] understand that God in this generation
[1:25:01] provided a way for you to get out of
[1:25:03] here.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:25:09] so I want you to imagine this as just a
[1:25:12] block of of marble standing here in
[1:25:14] front and it's not helpful for this
[1:25:18] block to be moving away from me.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? This block
[1:25:25] moving and shifting away from me will
[1:25:28] not produce the image. This block need
[1:25:31] to trust me that by the word by the
[1:25:34] instruments that I've been given that I
[1:25:37] can bring out of it the image that it
[1:25:39] needs to be. It's not helpful if we
[1:25:42] don't trust or eat the message.
[1:25:45] It's never if you don't eat the message,
[1:25:48] you can't produce the image. The
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; the words of a preacher are not enough.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; The word of a pastor are not enough. You
[1:25:59] got to hit the message yourself.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; We get criticized for playing tapes.
[1:26:07] That's wonderful. But guess what? That
[1:26:09] voice is inspired to bring you into the
[1:26:12] image.
[1:26:18] So this block it will stand and it will
[1:26:22] taste and I love it. It says for years
[1:26:26] not it it didn't it's not an overnight
[1:26:29] job.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a twominute job. And it it it
[1:26:35] takes time.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; It takes effort.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; It takes dying. It takes committing to
[1:26:43] the Jesus it day in and day out for you
[1:26:47] to come into that masterpiece.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Today we feel like oh but praise God I'm
[1:26:54] saved but says the new birth is only the
[1:26:57] beginning.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; God is trying I'm sorry. I hope it's
[1:27:04] okay. Yeah. Sorry.
[1:27:08] He's trying to build you in the statue
[1:27:11] of a perfect man.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Now what he said that is the seed that's
[1:27:16] in you, you you don't need anything from
[1:27:19] outside. It will push out of its own
[1:27:21] self all the virtues that are needed.
[1:27:25] But for it to push out, you need to be
[1:27:27] drinking.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Because remember he talked about the
[1:27:30] farmer when the seed is in the ground
[1:27:33] you don't go pull the seed out and look
[1:27:35] is it ready? Is it not ready? No, it's
[1:27:37] just a process of pouring water day in
[1:27:40] and day out. It's just a process of that
[1:27:42] process alone. That's why I said God has
[1:27:44] a method to do things. You just keep
[1:27:47] drinking. Let me say this. You don't
[1:27:49] need even need the change to be a parent
[1:27:52] to yourself. You just stay there with
[1:27:54] sincerity. Let me say this. God will
[1:27:58] make the change. Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; We We don't There's no such thing as
[1:28:04] overnight Christian. You need time.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, my brother, my sister,
[1:28:15] it gets wonderful. It gets beautiful.
[1:28:18] Day in and day out, they will work on
[1:28:20] you. And all of the sudden, the things
[1:28:22] that seem to have been very hard will
[1:28:25] start to fall away one by one. But it
[1:28:28] cannot happen if you keep shifting. If
[1:28:31] today you here, tomorrow you over there,
[1:28:34] no commitment to the cause, nothing. No,
[1:28:37] we need to be as a blood that stands
[1:28:39] right there and say, "Lord, here I am. I
[1:28:41] am willing to die." Now, so the image
[1:28:46] was in Michelangelo and here he is
[1:28:48] looking at the block and he's looking
[1:28:51] and and he takes and he picks a
[1:28:53] predestinated block for him to sit it in
[1:28:55] front of him. And the method by which
[1:28:58] he's going to bring it, he had an a
[1:29:00] hammer and a chisel. So out of the
[1:29:03] block, he's taking the block and it's
[1:29:06] chopping away or chipping away every
[1:29:09] portion of that block that never was
[1:29:12] part of the original image.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So now you cannot know, you can cry out
[1:29:19] and say, "Oh, I want this." You can't
[1:29:22] remove it yourself. You need the one
[1:29:24] that has the original image to chop it
[1:29:26] away from you.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be changed. Come to the
[1:29:31] one who knows the change that you need.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we write our own prescription.
[1:29:36] Brother Tim, I need this. I No, you just
[1:29:39] go to him. He knows what you need.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; So he he he takes it. It's very
[1:29:48] important. The obligation of the block
[1:29:50] is to remain still.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The obligation of the block
[1:29:57] is to not move and to trust that the one
[1:30:00] who's doing the chipping has the image
[1:30:03] that needs to be brought out.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you if you go. Thank you very
[1:30:08] much. So it's very important that we
[1:30:11] have that within our mind when we come
[1:30:13] to church. I I don't come with some
[1:30:16] preconceived I I just come and say Lord
[1:30:18] I know you you have a portion today that
[1:30:21] you want to do. Lord I do I have needs.
[1:30:24] Yes, I lay before you. You know my heart
[1:30:26] desire. You know my deeds. But I have to
[1:30:28] trust the process that the Lord will
[1:30:31] chip it away from me one by one by me
[1:30:34] standing in front of him. So when you
[1:30:36] stand there, when the word of God is
[1:30:38] being preached, it's God chipping away
[1:30:41] all the parts of you that's never part
[1:30:44] of the original. He's forming you into
[1:30:47] this image of the perfect church, into
[1:30:50] the image of the perfect bride, into the
[1:30:53] image that he desired for you to be.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; That's the process.
[1:31:03] It's the dying out.
[1:31:06] It's the chipping away of the things of
[1:31:08] the world. It's him doing the work that
[1:31:12] he promised.
[1:31:13] Only him has the original image of what
[1:31:17] he's trying to bring out.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Now let me ask you a question. Now when
[1:31:25] it's important, this is very imperative
[1:31:29] that what we say we are matches what we
[1:31:35] do.
[1:31:37] We
[1:31:39] and this is uh let me just speak to
[1:31:41] myself. There's so many claims we f we
[1:31:45] say we are but yet our life fell so
[1:31:48] short of those things.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; There's so many things we claim oh I'm
[1:31:53] this or I'm that but yet when we look at
[1:31:56] our lives we we we have such a
[1:31:59] deficiency in whatever we claim we are.
[1:32:03] My brother say, "So what you need is to
[1:32:05] come into the presence of the one that
[1:32:07] has the image.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; What we need is to come into the
[1:32:12] presence of the one that has the image
[1:32:14] and say, "Lord, I I know you called me
[1:32:17] to be a bride. I know you call me to be
[1:32:19] all those things. But one thing I know
[1:32:21] is within my own self, I cannot bring
[1:32:24] that image out of myself. Whether I want
[1:32:28] whether whatever I do, I will never come
[1:32:31] into the image by myself. I need you to
[1:32:34] perform a work on me to remove the
[1:32:37] things of the world so that I can become
[1:32:40] into the image that you call me to be.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we fail to understand the
[1:32:48] very process by which he's bringing us.
[1:32:50] So it it comes and and it's dying out
[1:32:54] and it's him and shaping the part and
[1:32:57] removing all the part that were not part
[1:32:59] of the original him doing the work. And
[1:33:02] says this in paragraph 64 of the uh
[1:33:06] sorry 51 of the identify m masterpiece.
[1:33:09] He says let us turn our thoughts. It
[1:33:12] says uh thoughts from Michelangelo, this
[1:33:15] great sculptor to the mighty God who in
[1:33:18] the beginning before there was a day and
[1:33:20] dawn and before there was an atom or
[1:33:23] molecule, God in his mind had a man
[1:33:28] had a man what a man should be like,
[1:33:31] should look like, what he should be, and
[1:33:35] how or what he should act like.
[1:33:41] Now I that's the key. I wouldn't even
[1:33:44] know how to act
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; until I know what the image supposed to
[1:33:49] be.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know what to do. And
[1:33:53] what we do most of the time is we run
[1:33:55] and do our own action. No, my brother,
[1:33:58] my sister, the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:00] tells you how to act. It tells you what
[1:34:03] to do. It tells you what you are. Why?
[1:34:06] because it's that which has been given
[1:34:08] to mold you into the image.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; But what speaks and and and let me just
[1:34:15] run for the sake of time. He said that
[1:34:17] the first family God gave them he placed
[1:34:21] them behind the word of God for their
[1:34:23] protection. And he says another place he
[1:34:26] says the word of God was their strength.
[1:34:29] The word of God was the uh uh the uh uh
[1:34:32] uh uh whatever gave them everything that
[1:34:35] they needed in order for them to be
[1:34:37] protected.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, we have taken this word of
[1:34:44] God and
[1:34:46] we come to church and like oh there we
[1:34:48] goes again and oh I don't have to dress
[1:34:51] like this and oh I don't have to do
[1:34:54] that. It becomes almost like a burden.
[1:34:57] Oh I I don't have to talk like this. My
[1:34:59] brother, my sister, you failing to
[1:35:01] understand the goal.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; When we do that, we are failing to
[1:35:07] understand the goal. The devil, your
[1:35:10] image that the devil has is the image
[1:35:13] that's been given to you by your
[1:35:14] parents.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; But your true original image of what
[1:35:19] you're supposed to be, it comes from the
[1:35:21] word and it comes from God. And when you
[1:35:24] come to God, when he's telling you,
[1:35:26] "Don't do this, don't do that," it's not
[1:35:29] God trying to cause you to suffer. It's
[1:35:32] God trying to bring you in the image of
[1:35:35] what you were actually supposed to be
[1:35:37] from the beginning. It's not a
[1:35:39] condemnation. It's not some type of
[1:35:42] rule. It's liberty so you can become
[1:35:45] what you're really supposed to be. Let
[1:35:47] me say this. Drinking, smoking, and all
[1:35:50] those things will only bring heartache.
[1:35:52] But being a Christian will bring
[1:35:54] happiness.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; My question is which one brings you
[1:35:57] happiness? Does drinking bring you
[1:35:59] happiness? Then go do it.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; If you really drink and become very
[1:36:05] happy, I'll say go do it.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; But if you go drink and become
[1:36:10] miserable, then you read the remedy this
[1:36:13] morning. Then what you need is God this
[1:36:15] morning. You need to come and drink from
[1:36:17] his fountain because he will bring you
[1:36:20] into what he calls you to be.
[1:36:26] We
[1:36:29] I wonder
[1:36:31] when we look at ourselves this morning
[1:36:34] and me included,
[1:36:36] we look at the way we dress.
[1:36:40] My question for you is where did you get
[1:36:43] that image from?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Because that image either came from God
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; or it came from the devil. Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; You're not a thought generator. You got
[1:36:53] it from someplace. You either by being
[1:36:56] influenced by God or you influenced by
[1:36:58] the devil. When we look at ourselves
[1:37:01] daily when we go to purchase our clothes
[1:37:04] and and it used to be just the sisters,
[1:37:06] but now it's the brothers, you know,
[1:37:08] pants are too tight and you sit down and
[1:37:11] the socks are showing off and and the
[1:37:13] the jacket is like you took your little
[1:37:15] brother jacket on. What's going on?
[1:37:23] the the way you dress, you are emulating
[1:37:26] somebody.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that's just you. You got
[1:37:30] it from somebody.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And my question is, is it God or is it
[1:37:35] the devil?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; The way we treat one another,
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; where did we get that from? My brother,
[1:37:44] my sister, the scripture says we need to
[1:37:46] provoke one another to godliness.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; We need to provoke one another in the
[1:37:52] things of God. We need to love one
[1:37:55] another. We need to follow the scripture
[1:37:57] way of doing things.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; We We don't need to have little group.
[1:38:04] Oh, this is my group and that's your
[1:38:06] group and that's one group. I my brother
[1:38:08] I I'm just here. I hope this is helpful.
[1:38:11] I'm just trying to help even my own
[1:38:12] self. We need that every part of the
[1:38:15] masterpiece, let me say this, is here to
[1:38:18] play a role.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; God didn't place you here so you could
[1:38:23] just come to church and go out and come
[1:38:24] and go out. No, you are part of this
[1:38:27] body to play a role to influence
[1:38:30] somebody. Whether you know it or you
[1:38:32] don't know it, your life is influencing
[1:38:35] somebody.
[1:38:42] Where do we get it from?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; We have concerts.
[1:38:50] Our weddings have become like parties.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Nightclub. I mean, it's the same as
[1:38:55] going to a nightclub. So, so we don't do
[1:38:58] we don't go to the nightclub. You
[1:39:00] understand, brother Tim? But we can
[1:39:01] create another version that is similar
[1:39:04] to where we let out our steam.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; We we we we don't want to look like we
[1:39:16] are copying. We just need to create
[1:39:19] something that's similar that we will
[1:39:21] call Christians.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; What is our image?
[1:39:31] Where did you get the image from?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; You either are his image
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; or you are somebody else's image.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to help myself. Let me
[1:39:40] say this. Just because we and I don't
[1:39:43] care. We could be from the same place or
[1:39:46] the same country or whatever. But don't
[1:39:48] associate to do something that's not
[1:39:50] Christian.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, just because we're from
[1:39:54] Congo, we from Mexico, we're from
[1:39:56] America." No, you are here as the
[1:39:59] Christian, a chosen people, a call out
[1:40:02] people. When we act, we act as
[1:40:05] Christians.
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:16] And that's the one that came directly
[1:40:18] from the message of the hour. The only
[1:40:21] one that has been presented to us as the
[1:40:24] message of the hour.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; We were fellowshipping and
[1:40:30] you know often time we talk so much
[1:40:32] about brother Brandham's ministry but so
[1:40:35] much about his life we can learn about
[1:40:37] the things which he was doing.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; How many people he was even helping
[1:40:42] without people knowing.
[1:40:45] How many times he did things that he
[1:40:47] never even made it public. How many
[1:40:50] times he did things that he never even
[1:40:52] mention it
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; that everything that he did he did for
[1:40:56] the good of the body. He Let me say this
[1:40:59] and and you may hate me for this brother
[1:41:02] Brham. He's our masterpiece in the end
[1:41:04] time.
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; That's the one to make our example.
[1:41:11] That's the one to look to to follow
[1:41:14] after. If you need a physical, remember
[1:41:17] God is was an invisible God. The
[1:41:20] children of Israel knew him by the body
[1:41:23] of Jesus Christ. He who was hidden him
[1:41:26] who was in the scripture says the
[1:41:28] invisible God made himself visible in
[1:41:31] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. When
[1:41:34] they saw him, they knew what God was.
[1:41:37] You wouldn't know who God was unless you
[1:41:39] saw Jesus Christ. Everything else it was
[1:41:42] just scriptures and understanding and
[1:41:44] prescription and the things of which
[1:41:46] they know. But their true understanding
[1:41:49] came when it was manifested in the
[1:41:51] physical body before them. And we in
[1:41:54] this generation we have had the
[1:41:57] opportunity or see a receive with one
[1:41:59] who came into that position with the
[1:42:02] manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:04] in the human body.
[1:42:11] What did he do? We hear so many times,
[1:42:15] oh, but couldn't be here and he was
[1:42:18] called away and everything right there
[1:42:20] is said, oh, but I couldn't do that. If
[1:42:23] I do that, I'll hurt the brother's
[1:42:25] ministry. Nobody will believe him.
[1:42:31] The masterpiece
[1:42:33] is to take
[1:42:35] the sickness
[1:42:38] and bring healing.
[1:42:40] To take the wrong and make it right
[1:42:44] is to bridge the gap. The barbam says it
[1:42:46] was a go between between men and God. He
[1:42:51] had the right butam says he had the
[1:42:53] right to marry. He had the right to have
[1:42:55] a family. is the masterpiece image is to
[1:42:59] lay down your right
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; so you could be used of him
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; in the way that he desire for us to be.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; The masterpiece is when we come to a
[1:43:10] place where it's not about us.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; It's not about anything we can do but
[1:43:15] it's about him coming and using each one
[1:43:18] of you young, old, no matter what age
[1:43:22] you are. God is here to bring you into
[1:43:25] that masterpiece. But whenam says you
[1:43:27] could be a wash woman, whatever you are.
[1:43:29] It doesn't matter what you do as a job.
[1:43:32] God wants to use you as a masterpiece
[1:43:35] where you are.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; If we can only have that understanding.
[1:43:38] He doesn't want we we need when when you
[1:43:41] wake up in the morning, pay attention to
[1:43:44] the image you are projecting. Is it
[1:43:46] Christ's image or is it the world's
[1:43:48] image?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you when you choose
[1:43:52] what you should listen to, what how you
[1:43:54] should reinact or even in our
[1:43:56] conversation. If somebody's bringing
[1:43:58] negative things, stop it.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Don't continue it.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Say that I'm not here to bring
[1:44:04] negativity. I'm not here to share the
[1:44:06] the the this one that and this that. I'm
[1:44:09] here so I not another person. I can be
[1:44:12] the masterpiece.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to be a masterpiece,
[1:44:16] that's your business. I want to be the
[1:44:18] masterpiece. Amen.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says remember there's only one
[1:44:25] form of eternal life.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; It says and even our name and our
[1:44:31] thoughts
[1:44:33] where did uh where we were were with God
[1:44:36] before the beginning of the before there
[1:44:38] was a foundation of the world because we
[1:44:40] were we were possessed. We were we were
[1:44:44] possessed of eternal life. Eternal we
[1:44:47] possess eternal life. And to be that we
[1:44:50] have to be part of God. And then it says
[1:44:53] so you would have to be as much as in
[1:44:58] his thought cuz we have eternal life and
[1:45:02] was predestinated to this life and our
[1:45:05] names were put in the lamb's book of
[1:45:07] life before the foundation of the world
[1:45:09] according to the revelation. Now it says
[1:45:12] God has us in his thinking. We and then
[1:45:17] we have eternal life because then he
[1:45:19] spoke to us. He spoke us and we came
[1:45:23] into existence. And a word is a thought
[1:45:28] expressed. A thought manifested rather.
[1:45:31] God had us in the beginning in his
[1:45:35] thoughts.
[1:45:38] Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; So your life as you're sitting here this
[1:45:41] morning
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; is a manifestation of somebody's
[1:45:44] thought.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; It's the manifestation of God's thought.
[1:45:51] And the way for us to completely come
[1:45:54] into that thought is to let the one with
[1:45:58] the inspiration work upon us so we can
[1:46:02] manifest the true image of what that
[1:46:05] inspiration was. He said as it says man,
[1:46:10] it says now man,
[1:46:13] he says now when a man when Adam first a
[1:46:16] man was how perfect he was, he looked
[1:46:19] like God and he says and the great Holy
[1:46:21] Spirit I love this. The great Holy
[1:46:24] Spirit brooding over the earth. Now I
[1:46:28] want you to go when you go look at this
[1:46:29] word brooding biblically speaking it
[1:46:32] says it refers to a protective nature or
[1:46:37] a creative work of the Holy Spirit much
[1:46:41] like a bird hovering over the nest to
[1:46:44] bring forth new life.
[1:46:48] So, so I if I could just put for I want
[1:46:51] you God with a thought brooding over his
[1:46:55] own seed so that the thoughts that he
[1:46:58] had will be made into life.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; That was the original process of
[1:47:06] creation.
[1:47:08] It was God brooding over his own seed by
[1:47:13] the Holy Spirit bringing it to come to
[1:47:16] pass. You cannot bring the image outside
[1:47:19] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; In fact, let me say this. The confusion
[1:47:26] comes is when we take our carnal minds
[1:47:29] and we try to interpret what the
[1:47:31] scripture says.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; But that's why there's the need for the
[1:47:37] new birth. Because what the new birth
[1:47:39] does to a Christian is it takes away the
[1:47:42] carnal mind and it gives you the mind of
[1:47:45] God. The scripture says this, a conno
[1:47:48] mind cannot understand the spiritual
[1:47:50] things because these two things are
[1:47:52] contrary. in order for you to understand
[1:47:54] even what the new birth is or what the
[1:47:57] word of God is is to come into the
[1:48:00] nature of that word and let that word
[1:48:03] now be revealed to you because at that
[1:48:05] time you will have the same mind that
[1:48:08] was also in Christ
[1:48:16] like a bird come out
[1:48:19] maybe an animal at different things
[1:48:24] trying to look for time. Keep coming
[1:48:26] more and more into the foam and was
[1:48:29] brooding until finally they came up a
[1:48:33] species just exactly like the one who
[1:48:35] was doing the brooding.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; God
[1:48:39] looking himself
[1:48:41] directly straight at Adam and seeing
[1:48:43] himself.
[1:48:45] Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; You know what Banam said? This message
[1:48:52] is to bring us right back in that same
[1:48:54] condition.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; This is message. This message is not so
[1:48:57] we can get the Holy Spirit. No, it's to
[1:49:00] he says we are today the same way that
[1:49:03] Adam was making our choices today. Do we
[1:49:08] want to be that image or do we want to
[1:49:10] be something else? We today this morning
[1:49:14] we are making our choices. We are faced
[1:49:16] with the same exact question that Adam
[1:49:20] was faced. Will we believe the word of
[1:49:23] God or will we take what the enemy is
[1:49:25] offering? Because he says it's the two
[1:49:27] kingdoms that are running. The devil and
[1:49:30] Holy Spirit is here to inspire his
[1:49:32] people. And God's Holy Spirit is here so
[1:49:35] he can also inspire his people
[1:49:38] until after he came. Exactly. One that
[1:49:42] was in the doing in the image of the one
[1:49:44] that was doing the birding. It says God
[1:49:47] God or man was made in the image of God.
[1:49:52] Then he placed him in the great garden
[1:49:55] like Michelangelo placed his great work.
[1:49:58] He says and all the great sculptor God
[1:50:01] placed his handiwork in the garden of
[1:50:04] Eden made him and help made help
[1:50:09] with the complete satisfaction. He was
[1:50:11] to God till even he rested. It was just
[1:50:16] it was just it says it was just a rest.
[1:50:18] His work had been finished. Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; It says in another place it says
[1:50:26] it says man man in the beginning he was
[1:50:31] made
[1:50:32] man in is it says man is a god. He's
[1:50:37] absolutely a god. This is in the message
[1:50:39] the uncertain uh um uncertain sound.
[1:50:43] Absolutely a god. He was made in the
[1:50:47] image of God, being a son of God. And
[1:50:50] he's the heir of all things that that
[1:50:54] that God is. And man was given a a a
[1:50:58] domain. And the domain was the earth. He
[1:51:01] have power. You have power over the
[1:51:04] fish, over the fouls, of the air, over
[1:51:08] everything. He could just speak and
[1:51:11] everything obeyed him because he was
[1:51:13] God. He was God within himself.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Not universal God.
[1:51:24] But I mean the God of heaven and earth.
[1:51:33] And let me ask this morning, what what
[1:51:36] is our deepest desire
[1:51:40] when we come to church or within our own
[1:51:42] lives? If we don't desire, if we don't
[1:51:46] strive to become this masterpiece, then
[1:51:48] what is it that we desire?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; If we don't strive that that we can work
[1:51:54] within the midst of where God has placed
[1:51:57] us, let me ask this. What work are we
[1:51:59] going to present when all is said and
[1:52:01] done?
[1:52:03] Is it the houses we've built?
[1:52:06] Is it the the the places we've visited?
[1:52:10] The work that we were placed here to do
[1:52:12] is God's work.
[1:52:15] It's God's work within our own families.
[1:52:18] It's God's work within our workplaces.
[1:52:20] It's God's work within the framework of
[1:52:22] the church. We are all here. But says,
[1:52:24] we are all made to be different so that
[1:52:27] God can use that difference to manifest
[1:52:30] himself.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; However different you find yourself, God
[1:52:36] didn't make you so you can fit into the
[1:52:39] world. He make you so you don't fit in.
[1:52:42] And the reason you don't fit in because
[1:52:44] you have another place
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; is not so you can cut yourself up and
[1:52:50] and trying to just make things happen.
[1:52:52] No, he made you that way so you don't
[1:52:55] fit because he has a place that he has
[1:52:58] prepared for you.
[1:53:02] But one says the trouble with Israel was
[1:53:05] that they were made to be a different
[1:53:08] nation, but yet they wanted to be like
[1:53:11] all the other nation. They wanted a king
[1:53:14] like everybody else. They wanted the
[1:53:16] music like everybody else. They wanted
[1:53:18] everything like everybody else. They
[1:53:20] wanted to prosper. They wanted they they
[1:53:23] didn't want when people looked at them
[1:53:26] and looked at the other nation to see
[1:53:28] the difference that God wanted them to
[1:53:30] have. My brother, my sister, that will
[1:53:33] lead to death.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; The only way we can prosper is by
[1:53:39] remaining what God called us to be
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and be happy about it.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; When you are called weird, rejoice.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, that guy's weird. Praise God.
[1:53:53] That guy is crazy. Praise God.
[1:53:59] There's no value in imitation.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; There's no value in being somebody else
[1:54:05] because that's a limited version.
[1:54:07] There's a version of you that's more
[1:54:09] powerful and that's what God has made
[1:54:11] you.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; If the musician could come
[1:54:25] But when I'm talking
[1:54:32] in this message, it will talk about
[1:54:37] there was an instrument that was being
[1:54:39] sold at an auction
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and they called out for the price and
[1:54:47] said, "If I could just say $5. Nobody
[1:54:51] was interested.
[1:54:54] They went down $4,
[1:54:57] $3,
[1:54:59] $2.
[1:55:02] Nobody's interested. I said, "Then an
[1:55:05] old man walked up and he took that old
[1:55:08] instrument and he dusted it off and
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; and he took it and he began to play.
[1:55:14] And as he began to play, it was by the
[1:55:18] sound of it Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; It was by the life that came out of the
[1:55:22] instrument the value began to raise.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; $100, 200, 300. People were beating for
[1:55:30] it. Why? Because now they recognize the
[1:55:33] value that was locked into the
[1:55:35] instrument.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; You can only recognize the value in you
[1:55:40] by letting God play your instrument.
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:47] The only one who can interpret your life
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; If you let somebody else interpret your
[1:55:56] life, they will bring down your value.
[1:55:59] But if you let God interpret your life,
[1:56:01] your value will go up. Why? Because he's
[1:56:04] the one who created the instrument and
[1:56:07] he knows what the instrument's supposed
[1:56:09] to sound like. Let's all stand this
[1:56:12] morning.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; That's our desire this morning. We want
[1:56:15] to be that.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm reminded by the old mechanic and
[1:56:20] this young man is there with a car and
[1:56:23] he opened the book. He replaced all the
[1:56:25] parts that he knew and he did this and
[1:56:28] he did that and it still wouldn't work.
[1:56:32] He stood there confounded.
[1:56:34] What do I do? And I feel like that's
[1:56:37] what we do with our lives.
[1:56:39] Oh Lord, I want this to take away from
[1:56:41] me. I want this to take away from me. My
[1:56:43] brother, my sister, I tell you, we all
[1:56:45] have a long list of stuff we want taken
[1:56:48] out.
[1:56:51] But my question this morning is, why
[1:56:54] don't you go to the master and let him
[1:56:57] order those things? Perhaps what you
[1:57:00] think you need to taken out, it's
[1:57:02] something that you really need in order
[1:57:04] for you to do something.
[1:57:06] Paul said, "I want this to be taken away
[1:57:09] from me. I I pray I pray to the Lord
[1:57:11] twice and I want this taken away." He
[1:57:13] came and he said, "My grace is
[1:57:16] sufficient." And I'm not talking about
[1:57:18] sin this morning. I'm talking about
[1:57:21] perhaps what we have in our minds as
[1:57:23] what we need to be is contrary to his
[1:57:26] will. Oh Lord, I want to be this. I want
[1:57:28] that job. I want to go here. I want No.
[1:57:31] what we need is to surrender to him and
[1:57:34] let him lead us.
[1:57:38] So this young mechanic put all and he
[1:57:41] was almost tired and just looking and
[1:57:43] butam said and then the man came dressed
[1:57:47] in the suit and
[1:57:49] he looked at him and he said oh what's
[1:57:51] going on and said well you know the book
[1:57:53] says to do this and the book says to do
[1:57:55] this and I follow the book to the letter
[1:57:57] and it's not happening and and and all
[1:57:59] of the things I did all that I know I
[1:58:01] cried out to the Lord oh Lord oh Lord
[1:58:03] and it wouldn't happen. He said, "Okay,
[1:58:06] wh why don't you touch and tighten up
[1:58:08] over there a little bit?" That looked
[1:58:11] very strange. He could have said, "No,
[1:58:13] that's not going to work." But you know
[1:58:15] what? He had done all that he could and
[1:58:17] he couldn't fix himself. He done all
[1:58:20] that he could and it didn't work. Why
[1:58:22] not take the advice of this one? Even
[1:58:24] though he didn't know him, he said,
[1:58:26] "Okay, I'll do that." And then he said,
[1:58:27] "Well, yeah, then go ahead and tighten
[1:58:29] up the other one over there. Go ahead
[1:58:31] and tight." And it says, "Okay, go ahead
[1:58:33] and start." He started it and then the
[1:58:36] car started. Why? Because he was the
[1:58:39] engineer, the inventor of the very
[1:58:42] engine and only him knew how it's
[1:58:45] supposed to work.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we have such an
[1:58:50] opportunity. We come here to church, we
[1:58:54] hear the word of God, and that's the
[1:58:56] inventor of your soul. And that's the
[1:58:59] one who knows how you're supposed to
[1:59:01] function,
[1:59:03] not you yourself. He knows the way. He
[1:59:06] knows what you have need of. He put you
[1:59:09] in that difficulty so you can learn
[1:59:11] something. He placed you in a threshing
[1:59:13] floor for a reason. He did it took you
[1:59:16] through all of that so you could have a
[1:59:18] testimony. Let me say this. When all is
[1:59:20] said and done, what is interested in
[1:59:22] that you may have a character that's fit
[1:59:25] to rule?
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:30] No, we want glamour.
[1:59:33] We want greatness. We want everybody to
[1:59:36] pat us in the back. Good job. Oh, that's
[1:59:39] a mighty preacher. That's a mighty son
[1:59:42] of God. Whereas he was rejected. He was
[1:59:45] not thought of as even much. My brother,
[1:59:48] my sister, don't take your queue from
[1:59:50] the world. Don't take your queue from
[1:59:52] the people. Take your queue from your
[1:59:54] master.
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:58] Let us be like that young man that was
[2:00:01] playing an instrument. It didn't matter
[2:00:03] when people were clapping or whatever
[2:00:05] was happening. He was only interested in
[2:00:07] one person and that's the guy sitting in
[2:00:09] the balcony. Why? Because the praises of
[2:00:13] men will lift you up but they will drop
[2:00:15] you down. But the praises of your master
[2:00:18] will give you strength for the journey.
[2:00:20] Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; We don't need a temporary fix. We need
[2:00:28] something permanent. We don't need to
[2:00:30] come and and and then get lifted up and
[2:00:33] then down and then up and then down. No,
[2:00:36] God brings the permanence. Something
[2:00:38] that lasts forever. Something whether it
[2:00:41] be in hell, wherever it is, it will
[2:00:44] stand. Like David, it will say, "If I go
[2:00:46] down in hell, be all thou art dare.
[2:00:50] [Music]
[2:00:53] the ruggedness
[2:00:56] that was part of the characteristics of
[2:00:58] the masterpiece.
[2:01:01] Let's not be just some happy golucky
[2:01:04] Christian and you know on the bed of
[2:01:07] ease. There were those that were burned.
[2:01:10] There were those that lay down the lies.
[2:01:13] There's those that were fed to the
[2:01:15] lions. There were those that throughout
[2:01:18] the ages, we can go throughout the dark
[2:01:20] ages and see all of them. There's those
[2:01:22] in this generation that lives in
[2:01:25] countries that are hunted because they
[2:01:27] are Christians.
[2:01:29] They're those that died that didn't even
[2:01:31] do anything wrong.
[2:01:32] [Music]
[2:01:34] It's not made to be easy.
[2:01:37] It's no, it's made for those that will
[2:01:40] stand and say, "Lord, don't matter
[2:01:44] whether it be good or bad, whether it be
[2:01:46] sunshine or rain, I will stand here
[2:01:49] until you do it." Those are the kind of
[2:01:52] people God is looking for. Is that your
[2:01:53] heart desire this morning? Say, "Lord,
[2:01:55] don't don't let me just, you know,
[2:01:57] something happen and then I fall down.
[2:01:59] Strengthen me. Let me be let me be a a a
[2:02:02] man and a woman of character. One one
[2:02:05] that can take a punch. One that can
[2:02:07] stand there. One that's not going to run
[2:02:09] away. One that actually desires to see
[2:02:12] the reality of God in the not just in my
[2:02:16] life in the life of all of us gather
[2:02:18] here that we may be here for one
[2:02:20] another. Those that will pray for one
[2:02:22] another. Those that will fast for one
[2:02:24] another. Those that when you hear
[2:02:26] somebody's hurt, your heart hurt.
[2:02:30] Not just, oh, as long as I'm good. You
[2:02:32] know, people use the new birth just to
[2:02:34] say, "Oh, praise God. I'm saved." No,
[2:02:36] that's not what it was given for.
[2:02:39] It was given so you can become a soldier
[2:02:42] to be placed on the on the field in the
[2:02:45] line of duty. Let's just bow our heads
[2:02:47] this morning. If you so heart desire, I
[2:02:50] I know I I probably didn't go the way I
[2:02:52] wanted to go, but I just fell in my
[2:02:54] heart to go the way I went. Amen. If
[2:02:56] your heart desire, just lift your hand
[2:02:57] out to him. Why don't you just pray
[2:03:00] within your own heart then ask him and
[2:03:02] say, "Lord,
[2:03:03] I lift my hands this morning." Even as
[2:03:06] brother Tim said, we broken we breaking
[2:03:08] gravity this morning. And we're crying
[2:03:11] out to you, Father. We desire that
[2:03:16] work of you that you promise will be
[2:03:18] done in our hearts. Amen.
[2:03:21] Your prophet told us that
[2:03:24] all that the seed needed to do in the
[2:03:26] end time was to lay in the presence of
[2:03:28] the son. That it was the responsibility
[2:03:31] of the son to bake all the grain out of
[2:03:34] it. It was the responsibility of the son
[2:03:38] to actually bring it into the maturity
[2:03:41] that he could become food at the
[2:03:45] master's table. Lord God, we know and we
[2:03:49] speak with sincerity of our hearts this
[2:03:51] morning. Lord, in the state that we are
[2:03:54] in, we cannot come into that maturity by
[2:03:57] our own self. Lord, we need you this
[2:04:00] morning. We need the Holy Spirit that
[2:04:03] spoke the word, Father, the same Holy
[2:04:06] Spirit to come and vindicate the word in
[2:04:08] our lives, Lord. That you take away the
[2:04:10] parts of us that's not yours and you
[2:04:12] chip away the worldliness and you chip
[2:04:15] away all the things of the world,
[2:04:17] Father, that we may walk into the
[2:04:19] perfect image of what you had for us in
[2:04:21] the beginning. We desire that and
[2:04:24] nothing more. Father, we want to be
[2:04:26] Jesus. We want to be those that would
[2:04:28] reflect the image of the master in the
[2:04:31] end time. Father, I pray that's our
[2:04:34] heart's desire. Father, if there be any
[2:04:36] sick among us and if there be any need
[2:04:38] with a little bit hand, Lord, may you
[2:04:40] just come by our way and speak to us and
[2:04:42] help us. We love you and we commit all
[2:04:44] that we are to you, Father. Receive us
[2:04:47] into your kingdom today. Father, let
[2:04:49] your grace and your mercy always
[2:04:51] accompany us. Father, let your word
[2:04:53] become a reality to each individual that
[2:04:56] we may claim for our own self that we
[2:04:58] have met the Lord Jesus Christ. We love
[2:05:00] you and we ask all of these things in
[2:05:02] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[2:05:03] pray. Amen.
[2:05:08] Oh, pleasing.
[2:05:13] Oh, let me be pleasing
[2:05:17] to you.
[2:05:20] Let everything
[2:05:23] that I do
[2:05:27] be pleasing
[2:05:30] to you.
[2:05:34] Praise.
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:05:38] Oh, I let everything
[2:05:42] I pursue
[2:05:47] be pleasing,
[2:05:50] oh Lord.
[2:05:53] If you desire prayer this morning, just
[2:05:55] come here and pray for you. Let's sing
[2:05:56] it again as brother Tim comes. Oh, I
[2:06:00] believe
[2:06:02] in you.
[2:06:05] Oh,
[2:06:10] you
[2:06:11] [Music]

[2:06:23] to you.
[2:06:26] Praise.
[2:06:28] [Music]
[2:06:31] Let everything
[2:06:35] I praise you.
[2:06:39] Be pleasing,
[2:06:43] oh Lord,
[2:06:45] unto you.
[2:06:50] Amen. Man, I'm appreciative of the
[2:06:53] effort brother Billy put forward today.
[2:06:55] Amen. It's it's the very truth. And uh
[2:06:59] we know the truth shall set you free.
[2:07:02] Amen. it. May we all say as we leave
[2:07:04] here, it's good to be in the house of
[2:07:06] the Lord. Yes.

[2:26:09] Lord. It's by your promised word. Lord,
[2:26:12] there's many things we attribute to you.
[2:26:15] And Lord, one of them is that you're
