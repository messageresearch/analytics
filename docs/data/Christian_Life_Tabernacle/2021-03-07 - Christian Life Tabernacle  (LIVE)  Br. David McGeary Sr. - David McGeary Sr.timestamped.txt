[20:40] amen amen brother jeff howard is a
[20:44] testimony
[20:45] amen if he could come at this time
[21:04] good evening
[21:07] well uh
[21:12] i wanted to start by uh saying that i
[21:15] i've been reading
[21:16] in fox's book of martyrs
[21:20] off and on for a while and uh you know
[21:22] it's it's easy for us to get the wrong
[21:24] impression of those saints that were
[21:27] in the time of luther you know and uh
[21:30] but let me tell you what
[21:32] just as a brother i would admonish you
[21:34] to read that book if you have extra time
[21:36] but those saints back then hit 13
[21:40] even before luther 1300s 1400s 1500s
[21:45] those people had an absolute i mean they
[21:48] had an
[21:48] absolute and they they lived lives that
[21:53] you know sometimes i read that and i'm
[21:54] like i'm just i feel
[21:56] flat you know what i mean they just it
[21:58] just flattens me out to look at how
[22:00] those people lived how
[22:02] the word was everything to them and they
[22:05] knew what this they had the revelation
[22:07] of what this universal
[22:09] thing was that was persecuting them and
[22:11] they called it what it was whenever they
[22:13] were brought up before
[22:15] those councils and uh
[22:18] you know and i just has a confession i
[22:21] kind of live in a state of desperation
[22:23] i'm always hungering and thirsting for
[22:24] more of god but
[22:26] i tell you after reading these these
[22:27] testimonies of these people
[22:29] it uh it just you know you you
[22:32] you're like oh my god lord i'm you know
[22:35] compared to them what you know what kind
[22:38] of an experience do i have i mean these
[22:40] people would deny themselves
[22:42] some of them were people of means and
[22:43] they would they would they would limit
[22:45] themselves to a meal a day
[22:48] didn't have to do it they would limit
[22:50] them so it would dress modestly
[22:52] you know uh constantly fasting and
[22:56] praying and they were in their bibles i
[22:57] tell you that what they had you know the
[22:59] scrolls
[23:00] well the other day i was uh on the road
[23:03] and uh
[23:05] and i was going to visit some people
[23:07] that are dear to me a
[23:09] brother that i was uh
[23:12] blessed to meet and uh and by the grace
[23:16] of god was
[23:19] you know i guess it was my lot to share
[23:21] the message uh with him
[23:23] and uh i was on my way to his house and
[23:25] it's it's quite a drive and on the way
[23:27] there i was uh
[23:29] you know just running over some things
[23:32] in my life before the lord and
[23:34] you know and i i see something and then
[23:36] i go well
[23:37] that's the word you know and i was like
[23:39] that's the word being made flesh in me i
[23:41] like that you know this this verse you
[23:43] know and that's driving a little further
[23:44] and
[23:45] some other aspects of my life came up
[23:48] before me and i go well that's the word
[23:49] that's the word being made flesh in me i
[23:51] was like thank you lord for that you
[23:53] know
[23:53] and it's been going on off and on for a
[23:55] while just different other things out of
[23:57] the epistles that i see are manifesting
[23:58] in my life
[24:00] and then uh it happened again a third
[24:02] time i thought of something and i go
[24:03] well that's the word
[24:04] and you know and uh and and then it just
[24:07] all of a sudden his tears started
[24:09] streaming out my face while i'm driving
[24:10] down the road and i said oh god i said
[24:13] make this word live in me
[24:16] and uh and i was pulling up to a light
[24:20] red light and i stopped and right after
[24:22] i said that i saw one of these
[24:24] billboards that you know changes every
[24:26] few seconds
[24:28] and it and right after i'd said that i
[24:30] stop at this light i look over the
[24:31] billboard it said believe you can
[24:36] and then the light turned green and i
[24:38] was turning
[24:39] and i'm going this way i'm taking a
[24:40] left-hand turn something had me look to
[24:43] the right
[24:43] and there was a regular billboard to the
[24:46] right hand side and it said
[24:47] you can and i knew it was the lord you
[24:51] know there are certain things you just
[24:52] can feel it in your spirit you know it's
[24:54] not coincident
[24:55] right and and so i just didn't want to
[24:57] take that to myself but i believe that
[24:59] you know what i mean saying that to all
[25:01] of his children you know
[25:03] that uh that we we're we're yearning for
[25:05] higher ground we're learning for a
[25:06] greater manifestation there's a power
[25:08] that's coming to the church
[25:10] and and we can just see the things that
[25:12] are coming in place and i believe
[25:14] it with all my heart that some of us
[25:16] will be brought up before
[25:18] you know uh and to testify and
[25:22] uh looking at what these people did and
[25:24] how the how god gave them grace to put
[25:26] words in their mouth
[25:27] that these people could not speak
[25:29] against you know
[25:31] and anyway just wanted to share that
[25:44] amen
[25:47] i believe it was the old fisherman who
[25:49] looked at the young boy and said
[25:52] amen god is everywhere amen you just
[25:55] have to have an eye
[25:56] to see him yeah man are we thankful for
[25:58] that
[26:03] sister nikki writes my neighbor daughter
[26:06] lauren
[26:07] has an internal bleed internal bleeding
[26:10] and has been back and forth
[26:12] to the hospital for a transfusion of an
[26:15] iron
[26:16] he said she has an mri tomorrow
[26:19] and the parents are praying that the
[26:21] doctors will be able to find out where
[26:24] the bleeding is
[26:25] where the bleeding is coming from amen i
[26:28] mean i believe we can
[26:29] just lift her in prayer tonight and and
[26:32] that the same god
[26:33] a man can just come on the scene for her
[26:35] and and help her

[26:46] amen we could just take that before him
[26:48] and pray that he will touch him and
[26:50] if you had the knee upon your heart just
[26:52] lift your hand up to him but a daniel
