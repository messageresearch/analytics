Description:
By Way of Remembrance
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Evening Service: October 11,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

lord let that be my guide just ask you to bless this service tonight we pray and jesus precious and holy name we ask you to be with us thank you for your goodness to us and for giving us our many shortcomings in sin lord you promised you'd never forsake us and that's where we rest this evening once again thank you lord we praise your wonderful name just bless your word to us now we pray in jesus name amen if you have your bibles let's turn over in the book of exodus in the 12th chapter of the book of exodus let's start with the 22nd verse and and let's just read the 13th verse before we jump to the 22nd verse and thus and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt and then on the 22nd verse and ye shall take a bunch of hips up and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lineal of the two sides of the post with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of this house until morning for the lord will pass through and smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lineal and the two sideposts the lord will pass over the door and ye shall not suffer the destroyer to come into your house and smite you and you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever and it shall come to pass when ye become to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what meaneth ye by this service that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lord's passover who passed over the house of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our home our houses and the people will bow the head and worship and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so they did father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen and you may be seated the man makes this statement he says they think just because they belong to church that it's that is all that's necessary oh brother that means no more to god than to be a mason or anything else or any lodge to belong to church that don't mean nothing to god you've got to be a son and daughter of god you've got to be born of god and god is the word and when i come and when i come part of my father i become all my father when you become part of god you become god in full his whole word you believe all of it any man and he said basically anything less than that is spiritual amnesia so we talked this morning and about that spiritual amnesia is a disease we can look tonight and see that a lot of people have suffered from it that they forgot there was a evening service you know and and that's okay because we're going to talk tonight maybe they're listening we would hope so but we're going to talk tonight about way the way to fight spiritual amnesia amen that that's what we want to know i believe the prophet certainly identified it this morning as a disease and and that in fact he actually said it he says this is a disease and it is contagious and we tried to point out this morning that it it it wasn't a a a preaching idea or it wasn't a text you know i will use the thought of amnesia to to draw a text to preach on certain things and and it's not a cliche you know or you tell somebody well you just got amnesia you know what i mean uh but it was actually described to us this morning a messenger telling the people that this is an actual real living alive spiritual disease that is affecting people and we found out that that disease could be passed along it's contagious so you can catch spiritual amnesia from somebody they can they can cause you to get amnesia and we understood what amnesia is is somebody who forgets who they are and where they're going they they don't have any memory and so they don't know where they're they don't know who they are they don't know where they come from and they don't know where they're going so we find out that the way to fight spiritual amnesia is by way of remembrance you've got to remember either you remember or you've forgotten i use that word a lot more lately here as i've added a few marks on the calendar you know we were i think leslie and i were talking and this november i believe it'll be our 49th uh wedding anniversary you know well you know i can't remember all of it you know and uh but it it what we'll do sometimes is we'll maybe talk about certain things certain places we've been certain times we at certain things will remember and leslie is a picture taker if you don't know that i can she got a picture of every restaurant i've ever eaten in so i can certainly go back over and look at those things but sometimes a picture brings up a memory and they have something that they call memorabilia it's certain things that you have in order to remember but remembering the lord was a a very important thing and that was god's complaint about israel time and time again was that they forgot they forgot you forgot you forgot what i've done for you you you forgot you forgot the name of the lord you forgot to serve me you forgot my commandments and and and we know that one of the things that pleases god is to remember him so we find out here in exodus we find out that the lord delivered israel and it was a mighty deliverance by a mighty hand it wasn't it wasn't just a weak escape the scripture doesn't say that the israelites snuck out one night and the egyptians couldn't find them no this deliverance was so powerful that the i mean i i just i love it i just get it actually makes me just chuckle inside they looted the land they borrowed money from all the egyptians knowing they would never pay it back i mean they just took everything they took trees they took plants they took gold they took money they took fruits the egyptians says take whatever you want just get out of here so massive and so powerful was the hand of the lord in their deliverance that i love the statement that's made in the film uh ten commandments when finally pharaoh sits on the altar and his wife is chatting him and he finally looks at her he says moses says god is god and and i just i just get thrilled over that story you know what i mean if you left egypt because of you shouldn't have been wanting for nothing when you left egypt and so they did a great ravage of the land and they had money and they had everything they needed to go in and and and so moses commanded them you keep this service you do this by way of remembrance to remember i don't want you to forget what that i did for you that i smoked the firstborn i smote the first cat the first mouse the first cockroach because whatever it was in egypt he smote every firstborn creature in the land the the scripture describes him as the destroyer he came through and he utterly destroyed egypt and and that was the the power of god and so god wanted to remember and that's what keeps you from having amnesia where you forget and we understood this morning that amnesia was a disease and therefore it started out in small steps that you could start getting a little bit of amnesia that's what he said he says you've got a little amnesia work in here you bought it you've got to be careful and then if he made the statement don't get it don't get amnesia don't get this so we try to push it past the place in our hearts and our minds and understanding it's as real as this so-called uh virus that's going on now now is it amazing that the natural types the spiritual here's this great virus going on and yet spiritually there's another virus at work there's another spirit at work another disease at work so we understand that we can start getting this he said pastors get it deacons get it you know so i guess we could all get it so when we get it we need to know a way to fight it we need to know what's the cure for it and the cure for amnesia is remembrance so we want to we want to be able to remember the lord a good sermon is remember the lord and that's why we have communion communion is one of the things that god instituted so can you say well he said keep this service forever well when it came over to the new testament in in that in that second exodus when it moved over to that exodus jesus celebrated the passover and he took bread and now he reinstituted that passover in a new exodus and so now that passover in that new exodus was do you this in remembrance of me so now they were celebrating the same service but now the service was done in memorand so he said he delivered it was in remembrance of the great destroyer and the great deliverance by the blood on the doorpost the blood of the lamb now there was the lamb and his blood was going to keep the destroyer off of us so he instituted communion as being a what a way of remembrance and that's what he said so he said that it's by a way of remembrance so i want to just talk about ways that that we can keep god on our minds and in our hearts by way of remembrance we should remember the lord every day amen amen the scripture tell us make melody in your heart uh edify yourselves with psalms and songs and and things of edification because if you don't resist this spirit of amnesia it will you will get it okay it's not a it's not a sermon title it's not a it wasn't a thought to use as preaching it's an actual spiritual disease that actually exists forgetting the lord failing to remember the lord people that don't come and take communion have amnesia they just did because that's what he said he said as long as you come together you keep this service forever in remembrance of the deliverance that you see received by the sacrificial lamb and that's why we have communion so we want to start looking at ways that and i wrote down some of these just as a a believer and some of them are the things that i try to practice and things that we just want to share because we're brothers and sisters but one of the ways to remember the lord is to see the invisible things of god in the visible things around us paul stated in romans that they are without excuse they didn't want to retain god in their thinking but he said they are without excuse because the invisible things of god are clearly seen in the invisible in the visible things around us so we should be able to see god and just think when these things become so common to us and and they become just they almost become scientific and and the science of it and all the knowledge that we have and everything that the science has done the purpose of that science was to cause us to forget that it was god that created the stars it was god that hung the stars it was god that framed the earth and that was peter's complaint he said they they don't remember that it was god that framed the earth you go read it in peter he talks about that they for they forgot that god was the creator and they forgot that one day he's going to destroy it but they didn't want to keep that so how do we keep god in our mind we look to god and we see the invisible things we look to the creation and we remember that god created the heavens and earth that it was created science wants to have a different uh explanation they want to show and it's describe it by science we know how fast light moves we we know we can shoot a man up into space and bring them back down and they've scientifically explained they talk about the tithe and they talk about the moon and they they've got it all figured out but they they don't want to retain the creator and so we can't forget that the very world we live on was formed by god and and we don't want this amnesia just to slip in so when we step out our doors we need to hear the birds singing we need to watch the clouds we need to look at the grass what's that saying that they always said stop and smell the flowers well so many of them are fake nowadays you know but but the real things of god are real you understand you've got to see god real remember the little boy asked what the guy who he was fishing with where's god and the man's just started to start to running down the face he said he's everywhere i see him in the water i see him here i see him everywhere if you're not seeing god in the world that's around you you don't see the creation of god you don't see the magnificence of god then you've got amnesia caused by science so how do you fight that you take it beyond the science and you take it back to the beginning our very book that we live by starts with in the beginning god created that's where we go back we go back with all that's going on the the real world not man's perversion of it but the real order and the real creation in the real sun and moon and stars and all those things was made as god expressing himself that we could see the invisible things of god in the visible things around us so we're we were we don't have an excuse for getting this amnesia this is one of the things that god gave us to fight amnesia is seen him in his creation ask ourselves how often do we stop and worship god in his creation we worship our dashboard we worship our computer screen because we're spending all our time in front of it and and those are the things that allow this amnesia to get on you you know and so uh that's one of the things that god gave us to fight spiritual amnesia was the glory of his creation i thank god for it don't you amen another thing that you want to do and we saw in this scripture remember to fight amnesia you have memory amnesia is the loss of memory and identification you don't have anybody to identify with i don't identify with that i don't identify with that there's a a a lot of things that are in the world that i i just don't identify with i'll tell you one thing i don't identify with and that's jogging i see those people running down the street i want to get out and lay hands on them really hey don't register know i know people that love to jog i i don't know i could probably use some of it but i don't identify with it and so you you've got to have you you've got to have something you identify with and so one of the things to do is bring to your remembrance his mighty works bring to your remembrance this is the god that you're identifying with what is it that you're identifying with well we're we're identifying uh uh with the mighty works he did in egypt as we saw here but this is a god that sent a prophet there and he created fleas and he created frogs and and he created turned the water to blood and had hail stones fall down what are you remembering you're remembering how mighty this god is that we serve that he parted the waters that he did those things and by remembering those things and bringing those things to your remembrance and remembering the mighty works that he did now you're remembering what it is that you're identifying with i'm identifying with a god that has is a mighty god that his works and and his might is wondrously to be performed it's it's powerful we've sometimes got to remind ourselves that our god is powerful that all things are under his feet that we're not serving a religion we're children of the mighty creator we're children of god and if you don't remember that and you don't dwell on that and you don't take time to remind yourself and edify yourself and then you forget all that he's done to show that he's god then it starts to slip from you so we're talking about tonight you in other words you have got to go out and fight this disease look at everybody out there staying six feet away from another they're putting masks on their face they're washing their hands you know i'll tell you according to scripture you can't wash your hands of it you just know that story right know your stories so anyway so uh we look at those things we talk about jericho remember jericho remember the story of rahab how many is identified with rahab sure we have lost and in sin and something come by and and told us you remember those stories you got to look at those stories you got to keep them alive you got to go read them you've got to get in and marching around the city seven times the walls were so thick that you could ride a chariots on them but then that trumpet sounded oh now can't you get into all the types amen the wall come dumbling down the trumpet sound and joshua the holy spirit the mighty angel uh deliverance and ec and so you've got to go back and and and and remember those things you've got to keep them alive in your memory if not all you're looking at is this present-day confusion you're only seeing what's before your eyes and when you see what's before your eyes you've got to remember that there's a god that has delivered people all down through time you got to remember that you serve a mighty god you need to be reminded of how mighty he is you've got to go look at his history look at what he's done look what's put on in charge what's been laid out before us to show if you do that then you are fighting this disease that whole purpose is is to get you to forget even jesus looked at his disciples and said you are worried because you brought no bread have you forgot the loaves and fishes and the baskets and and all the things you've already forgot that you see because the the whole purpose of satan's civilization is to get us tied up to where our minds are occupied because the battle's in our mind and if he can get our minds off the things of god then amnesia can start to set in so you remember you remember jericho remember david and goliath you know you guys type that out in your life put yourself in the story put yourself in the types giddy and daniel you know remember those things remember his judgments noah uh samson you say wait a minute sam says yeah samson was judgment he killed more philistines in his death he brought the whole place down so these are the kind of gods that we serve this we've got to remember the god we serve he's personal and he's mighty okay why do you know why is it important to know what he's done because we know if he's did it anytime one way he'll do it again so if you put yourself in the story if you've got a goliath then you know that you're a david you identify with the story you you use the story to type your life to type out what's going on in your life you look at the stories you look at those those things you place yourself in it you said this same god that did it for them can do something for me he's a creator he creates solutions [Music] he he changes things the scripture says that prayer changes things and and so you do that you say well why are we talking we know these things but you've got to know that why these things are been placed in god's word that has been placed in god's words because they're for you to fight the amnesia to fight this disease this is a real disease that's spreading a man made a statement here a while ago kind of an outstanding statement he said the the message shouldn't be called the voice of god and i'm sure he was referring to a certain institution but brother branham said i am the voice of god to you the message was the voice of god it was you know what i mean but see the whole thing of these things is to come in and the side track is and to think on things and the scripture tells whichever so things are good think on these things because these are the things that fight us from getting in spiritual amnesia amen the other thing he said it's about know who you are and know that you're his disciples i like it it is in the gospel of saint john if you want to turn to it you feel free but it's the first john the fifth chapter and it says by this we know and we'll just read from the first verse just a few verses whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that begotteth love him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so one of the ways that we know is we've got to know that we're his disciples and we know that we're his disciples because we keep his commandments so one of the ways to fight amnesia is to keep the commandments keep his commandments not only the 10 commandments but we know that again i mentioned communion you got to keep that ordinance you foot washing water baptism but there's a lot of other things he talked about visiting the widow and their affliction helping the fatherless uh going the extra mile you know all the things that are commandments of the lord heck have you ever spent time just thinking on the things god didn't leave us see we're too religious religion is a doorway for amnesia it moves everything into into religious belief and religious association and religious but none of the actual things that he said we do visit the sick all these things that are the commandments of god that that they're given for us to keep you know uh just little things like like uh uh go if a guy sues you for your coat give them your cloak also you know could lend and can to and not to be asked to uh be paid back i know a lot of people like that one i'm going to borrow and i'd have to pay back but you know do what's on your heart but that's to the lender it ain't to the borrower so don't misplace god's word and and there's all these great things that are the commandments of the lord and if you're going to fight amnesia because it is a disease that's trying to get on you i've got i i just saw it today i read it today he said it's a contagious disease that anybody can get so if you stick your head in the ground and say there's no such thing as amnesia i'm not forgetting anything you know and and we forget to give our church offerings we forget to pay our tithes we forget to look out after the well-being of others we forget to to to to be mindful to let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus that every man looks upon the things of other above his own thing if that's not happening then amnesia's coming in you may not be totally taken over yet but when amnesia reaches its full fledge uh manifestation the scripture says that you no longer wish to teach god in your thinking and you don't want anything spiritual in your life you have transformed from the spiritual mind to the carnal mind now we don't want to go there but you don't think that satan's like a roaring lion going about whom he may devour you say well what's he doing how's he devouring he's going about spreading this disease this virus called spiritual amnesia to get god's children to forget who they are to forget his commandments to forget to lay for themselves a pattern of good work ask yourself how many you don't have to raise your hand how many of you have a pattern of good works things a pattern is something that's repeated in your life something that you do for people over and over in your life you help people you have a work maybe it's just going by and saying a word of encouragement somebody checking out somebody it's not a one-time thing that something pops up and you do it because it popped up but you in your life have good works that you do you have a pattern of good works it doesn't have to be to the same person but maybe you you you whatever it might be it's something that you continually practice a good work the work is practiced doesn't have to be on the same person but you continually maybe give clothes to somebody you continually donate this food bank you continuously have a pattern of good work something in your life that you deep good you say why are you saying that because what we're talking about is things that keep you away from the disease if not you get all weary does that ring a bell what did you hear this morning weary causes amnesia he says it causes it you get down you get weary life's a burden and and it's hard and i'm struggling and pretty soon that eats you up and the more he can make life weary some the quicker you're forgetting about the god that's the creator and you forgot that jesus said the righteous won't beg bread that god's always on time he came right at the right time he's always right on time you think of daniel in the lion stand in went daniel but he stopped the mouths of the lion inn went shadrach meshach and abednego but he stopped they went in before the victory came but the victory was right on time that's the kind of god you serve so that's how we know that we we we we fight these things we lay for ourselves a pattern of good works uh we keep his commandments we go the extra mile we do the things that he said do we're mindful of the word of god the prophet of god says that every time the church doors are open that we ought to be there now i know there are circumstances but you can't have a pattern you know and i understand some people work on sunday i wish that our civilization hadn't developed a society that works you know when i first came to texas there was nothing open on sunday no grocery stores no nothing they opened up at noon can you imagine a world that respected church that much you think they have any respect for church now no shut them down we'll let ten of you go in there i don't know i'm in conflict because the word of god i read my bible the other day forsake not assembling yourselves together unless there's a c19 virus it doesn't say that i mean i read the scriptures and moses is the only guy that can lay hands on anybody because his arms are six feet long i mean what are you doing you understand things are coming straight up in conflict with the word of god and we try to ration out a reasoning who's a major reasoner in the scripture eve she went to reasoning i don't know i know what the scripture says the scripture says if we keep his commandments nothing will harm us we can take up a deadly thing and it won't harm us i just know what the word says do you understand but we with this amnesia's coming in to this fear remember he said if you knew that you were going to be shot in the morning what would you do i'd have faith why he says worry's only going to make it worse but if i have faith it might deliver me [Applause] it's sad when you have to tell people if you're sick stay home and here's jesus saying bring all you that are heavy laden and sick come unto me bring him in but if you forgot that this is the kind of god we have and we put more power in the disease than we do the creator right and i'm not talking a lot and i said this at the beginning the only reason we've taken some of the stances we can is for them i don't put on my mask because i'm afraid of going in the store i'll put on math for those that are afraid you know it's it's for them so you know i'll i'll bear the reproach i went in to see my locksmith you know i was thinking about buying a safe and he didn't have his mask on i said you don't have to put that mask on because of me he said you don't have to put your mask on because of me either i said oh my we're going to have a revival right here see what do you understand if you don't if if you don't bring the word of god in your remembrance you're going to let something else sell you a bill of goods and that brings me to the next thing i want to talk about is study to show yourself approved second timothy 2 and 15 know the promises of god know what he promised you and i mean when i say study that means you take specific areas of the only word that comes to my mind is research but i'll put it this way seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open study what protections do you have in the word of god what promises did he make to you you know what what what what are the things that he promised us we need to study we need to know his promises we need to know that he'll throw our mistakes in the sea of his forgetfulness to be remembered no more we've got to know when we confess our faults and we confess our sins that he's faithful and just to forgive them and with god forgive means forget we have a hard time doing that because of this carnal census but if we could just study you're not going to get resist this spirit just coming to church on sunday if karen a minister just preached what's on his heart for an hour and a half two hours and and not have any more studying going on in your life one of the commandments we have is read our bible and pray in other words look at it this way not read your bible anybody can read but read with revelation read with study greed to that we might increase in the knowledge of his will and that we might know what the scripture says what his might is towards us i used to be able to give you the chapter and verse of that but it's in there maybe maybe it's crossed one of your minds you know you know or he he talks about that that you're that you might increase in the knowledge and might learn his might towards us that's what we've got to study how are we going to fight this disease because it's after us it wants to take our god out of our mind it wants to take our god out of our thinking he's fine if you can just have this god on sunday isn't that enough that was pharaoh go off and on sundays and worship and then when you're done come on back and build bricks is anybody tired of building satan's eden if anybody tired of being under the task master of this world you know this ain't our home i'm a justice traveling through i i remember that i've studied to show myself approved they're not going to work me forever you know what i mean and they're not going to bury me in the ground they might throw this carcass but i'll tell you something i've got a new one waiting amen you know and and on that other side i might be handsome everybody just judges you by a worldly standard everybody in heaven is going to have big noses hallelujah oh no a carnal mind is what enemy against god is it it sets you apart from god and if once you get apart from god satan can start taking things out of your memory he takes them out of your memory one by one the little foxes spoil the vine a little bit he robs you he takes you he makes you forget all that he's done for you he makes you forget you know yeah we we need to a study to know the promises just say ask yourself how many promises do you know that god's made to you that you've memorized them they're part of your life i'll tell you a promise that i quote all the time in my heart he who started a good work in you will finish it till the end i have not chosen him he hath chosen me amen i just remind myself of that and remind myself because if i don't remind myself of that satan's going to try to point out what a failure i am and praise god he saved the failure yeah that's why we build ourselves in a statue of a perfect man because a man who doesn't have these things cannot see afar off and has forgotten he's got spiritual amnesia so we got to know the promises of god we've got to know what power has been commissioned to us the works that i do you shall do also and and that brings me to the last thing that i want to say that is very important and that's to keep the commission and that also comes under keeping his commandments and he commissioned us to go into all the world that commission got destroyed when satan established nickelodeonism and made the five-fold ministry offices in the carnal church instead of gifts in the believer believe me sisters you can testify there's lots of circumstances and lots of situations that i would feel extremely uncomfortable in that you can stand there in that gap and make a difference in somebody's life so you you've got to carry out the commission and therefore one of the greatest things that we have to fight spiritual amnesia is testifying testify don't let what he's done go unnoticed god does things for us and and you rejoice but you never share them you don't share all the things that god's done for you you don't share it you know and i'm just not talking about a testimony service at church you ought to tell people that you come and contact god did it for me if somebody opens the door you can say you know i used to be like that but god but god and testify because you've got to keep the works and the love of god alive else they'll be forgotten they'll be forgotten all the things that's god's done for us i don't want them to be forgotten you know i i like to talk to adrian and and and cosmine and i i i'd like to have them give me their testimony of how that they came from their country and how that they got over here and the way god opened the door for him and all these great things i love to hear those things i love testimonies because i know that god's still doing god's done some remarkable things for people remarkable all right brother matt testify i used to be an atheist well what changed that you think one day he decided that he didn't want to be an atheist no more he thought he'd try christianity for a while no god put his hand on him i don't want to embarrass him and everything but you know you know i'm going to tell it you can get mad at me later but heidi went and got him out of jail one time you know that's that's how the things that god did i've seen their testimony what is that it's the hand of god in two people's lives with transforming power why do we keep that in the lid brother billy paul tells the testimony of he's sitting in this barber shop and this barber's cutting his hair and all of a sudden his the barber pulled out the man sent from god book and said this is your dad he said if that was my dad i'd tell the whole world if this is my god i'll tell the whole world you know why he doesn't want you to testify because he wants you to forget that is the thing that hurts the lord more than anything is when his children forget what he's done for him you want to fight amnesia and you want to recover from amnesia maybe satan got you in the case and you backslid and you're away from god if you will go back and do the things that he says to do you will recover and you will remember that he said i will not leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you even till the end and i'll lead you in the paths of righteousness how many have got off the path of righteousness in their life and you find out he leads you right back amen he's a shepherd he leaves the 99 to go after the one you understand i just want to tell you is that you're not going to fight this disease unless you fight this disease if you don't fight it you're going to get it amen i know it's pretty simple but it's real and we see the effects of it all over the place and the only thing we can do is take our weapon and fight back right resist the devil and he will flee it never said hope the devil will leave you alone because he won't but this word will defeat him any place anytime under any circumstance so let's fight spiritual amnesia and if you're fighting spiritual media you're studying you're testifying you're doing laying for yourself a pattern of good works then you become a front-line worker to deliver other people who have this spiritual amnesia and people will all of a sudden remember god loves me and you say you know i was really down but god took care of me god just made this happen the lord make a way he's a waymaker and you just start testifying and you bring god alive and satan hates that when they threw peter in jail and they said okay you can go they scourged him and they said now don't you testify in the in this name no more he said what is it better for me to believe you or to obey god amen the gates of hell will prevail against this revelation but praise god i'm gonna i'm gonna you know you know i i that reminds me of that song i'm gonna lift my hands i'm gonna praise his name i'm gonna go in the world i'm gonna tell them that jesus christ is alive he's the same yesterday and today and forever i'm going to testify for what he does i'm going to study in god's word to know his promises i'm going to have a pattern of good works in my life i'm going to worship him in the creation all that he's all in i'm going to see him every day in the stars the thing i'm going to go outside at night and praise his name i'm going to praise his name in the morning when the sun rises i'm going to praise his name in the evening when you see those magnificent sunsets i always tell you that shows that you're in love i remember scott walker scott walker lived with me for for a while going to school and and we knew something was going on we knew it just as as plain as day scott walker lived in hawaii and one day he walks in our house and he says you know i've never seen a sunset like tonight the most beautiful sunset in all the world and me

was mary or uh uh uh lester and mary come by and leslie pointed to the couch and they were over there talking and she's i didn't know yeah that's what love does to you i thought let me tell you i've lived in fort worth for a long time and i've been to hawaii and there ain't no sunsets in fort worth like hawaii unless you're in love not that what love does yeah i'll never forget it you know someone gave me a ticket to a a game and i was glad to go to it because uh she was going to be playing in the band and there comes the band you know big famous marching band and there's one girl in a skirt and i was sitting in front of a bunch of people and they started saying i was way up you know on the nosebleed that's the best shot i could get but they said oh look at that girl in a skirt and everything and they said some remark i'll never i just got me i have to be honest with you i can be got pretty easy i'm working on it and i said well i thought this was texas christian university and she's the only christian in the whole school you guys need to change your name and they underst we left that subject in a hurry but i don't want to forget you want to forget the lord no i want the lord to be in my life and i i know that there's a devil that's trying to fight me and give me amnesia and if i do the simple things that the word of god tells me to do i'll be able to fight this
