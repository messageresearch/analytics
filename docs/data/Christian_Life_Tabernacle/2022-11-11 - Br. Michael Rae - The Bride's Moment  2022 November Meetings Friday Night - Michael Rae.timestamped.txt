[59:32] I pray
[59:35] [Music]
[59:44] amen just before
[59:46] brother Michael comes you know
[59:50] every year I just have like a theme in
[59:54] my heart
[59:56] and I thought
[59:58] these words that the Lord spoke and he
[1:00:03] said
[1:00:05] the people draw anion to me with their
[1:00:08] mouth and honor me with their lips
[1:00:12] but their heart is far from me
[1:00:16] and I I thought in my heart like James
[1:00:19] said he said draw an eye unto me and
[1:00:22] I'll draw an eye into you
[1:00:24] and I thought for this year that was my
[1:00:27] theme of my heart I want to draw an iron
[1:00:31] to him in my heart
[1:00:33] you know what I mean I want it to be
[1:00:35] more personal than it's ever been I I
[1:00:39] want the love affair
[1:00:41] to grow and I just think it's a a
[1:00:46] beautiful thing that God's doing you
[1:00:49] know these are kind of like
[1:00:51] home meetings we're welcome for all our
[1:00:53] visitors and all that came but this this
[1:00:57] meeting was
[1:00:59] I think really set for us that we could
[1:01:03] take that next step to draw closer and
[1:01:07] that's that's really what I want I want
[1:01:10] to be touched in my heart
[1:01:12] you know what I mean something just deep
[1:01:14] and Rich and I thought of this prayer
[1:01:17] that brother Branham prayed uh
[1:01:20] in the message invisible Union and I
[1:01:24] thought this is my prayer and I hope
[1:01:26] it's your prayer too
[1:01:28] Lord God
[1:01:30] I am asking
[1:01:32] the bride tonight
[1:01:34] the ones that I feel has pulled away and
[1:01:39] waiting
[1:01:40] may they separate themselves from
[1:01:43] everything in the world
[1:01:45] they must lay in the presence of the
[1:01:49] warm s-o-n light of the son of God
[1:01:54] bathing in his word
[1:01:57] in his love
[1:01:58] granted
[1:02:00] dear God yes I want to bathe
[1:02:04] in his love
[1:02:05] this weekend
[1:02:07] don't you that I know he loves us
[1:02:11] I know he cares for us and I know he
[1:02:13] wants to do for us exceedingly and
[1:02:16] abundantly above what you got you can
[1:02:19] either ask or think
[1:02:21] but it's very simple if you draw nigh
[1:02:25] unto him and not and I thought beyond my
[1:02:29] lips Beyond My Singing Lord I want my
[1:02:32] heart Amen to draw an eye unto you uh
[1:02:36] isn't that your heart's desire tonight
[1:02:38] so it's a real privilege for us to have
[1:02:42] brother Michael with us
[1:02:44] I think the first time he ever preached
[1:02:46] away from his house
[1:02:48] there's home church he preached here for
[1:02:51] us and then he came back again with his
[1:02:54] father and preach for us and we're nice
[1:02:56] to have him back today I know you'll be

[1:07:24] just a tidbit of what's going to come
[1:07:25] out of our mouths when we've been there
[1:07:27] 10 000 years amen amen will be shouting
[1:07:30] on the streets of Glory it'll be a whole
[1:07:32] lot louder I'm sure
[1:07:36] well it's sure good to be here tonight
[1:07:38] what an honor it is
[1:07:40] be with you as butter David said indeed
[1:07:41] it was my first trip away from home
[1:07:45] was here so this is like home away from
[1:07:46] home
[1:07:48] so we're just so thankful we can come
[1:07:50] here and sojourn with you
[1:07:52] share our heart and our burdens tonight
[1:07:54] I'll just be the appetizer and then
[1:07:56] butter Tom he'll be the full full course
[1:07:58] in the next couple of services all right
[1:08:00] and there's a few brothers that we were
[1:08:03] today they took us so just had to take a
[1:08:04] little break for her lunch and
[1:08:06] my goodness we had more than appetizers
[1:08:08] so if anybody was there and and you know
[1:08:11] it and they start to nod off because
[1:08:13] they are in food coma you just hit them
[1:08:16] and say wake up
[1:08:18] maybe but tonight maybe we'll fill up
[1:08:21] with a little bit different food tonight
[1:08:22] I mean that's what our desire is tonight
[1:08:26] well we'll just go straight to the word
[1:08:27] then and we'll turn to our scriptures
[1:08:31] we'll turn to Matthew 16 tonight
[1:08:39] very very
[1:08:40] we could say calm in Scripture something
[1:08:43] that I'm sure you've heard probably many
[1:08:45] have preached on somebody's probably
[1:08:47] preached on here
[1:08:49] but it's I'd say a really uh
[1:08:52] critical scripture
[1:08:54] Matthew 16 we'll start in 13.
[1:09:00] and you were worshiping I was sitting in
[1:09:02] the back there my goodness it just
[1:09:03] sounded so beautiful
[1:09:05] the people of Lord have a right to shout
[1:09:07] and sing amen for the way is growing
[1:09:10] dark
[1:09:11] but that ain't our future sir amen
[1:09:15] Matthew 16 we'll start verse 13 when
[1:09:18] Jesus came into the coats of caesarea
[1:09:20] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[1:09:22] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[1:09:26] and they said well some say that thou
[1:09:29] art John the Baptist
[1:09:30] some Elias and others Jeremiahs or one
[1:09:34] of the prophets
[1:09:35] well you saith unto them but whom say ye
[1:09:37] that I am it had to be personal
[1:09:41] has to be personal tonight you can say
[1:09:43] well so-and-so says this is who you are
[1:09:45] so and so is that but who do you say who
[1:09:48] do you recognize him to be that's what
[1:09:50] Jesus is asking them and so Simon Peter
[1:09:52] something struck him quite strongly amen
[1:09:55] something struck him he says Thou Art
[1:09:57] the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:10:00] Amen and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:10:02] him blessed art thou Simon barjona for
[1:10:04] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:10:06] unto thee by my Father which is in
[1:10:08] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[1:10:11] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll
[1:10:13] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:10:16] shall not Prevail against him amen isn't
[1:10:19] that a precious scripture amen what a
[1:10:21] promise the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:10:23] Prevail against it maybe you just can
[1:10:25] skip over a couple books into John 17.
[1:10:28] we'll just read one little verse there
[1:10:41] John 17 verse 1 right at the top
[1:10:44] very short portion
[1:10:48] these words spake Jesus
[1:10:51] and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[1:10:53] said father
[1:10:54] the hour
[1:10:56] is come I'm just going to stop right
[1:10:59] there the hour
[1:11:00] is calm amen let's just pray
[1:11:05] Heavenly Father tonight we have come to
[1:11:08] gather around your precious bleeding
[1:11:10] word
[1:11:11] Lord our that's what draws us together
[1:11:14] that's what unifies our heart is not
[1:11:16] Lord just natural friendships and
[1:11:19] different Lord ways that we come
[1:11:21] together but Lord It's Your word that
[1:11:23] unifies us Lord that we can come from
[1:11:25] different parts of the world in the East
[1:11:27] and the west but Lord something in our
[1:11:29] heart connects us it's your word tonight
[1:11:32] and Lord we want and desire that word to
[1:11:34] really Lord just to be to become a
[1:11:36] Living Word Lord it may be somebody
[1:11:38] that's come Lord year over year and it's
[1:11:40] just Lord maybe just a letter but Lord
[1:11:43] tonight he could become Living Word to
[1:11:45] their heart and Lord when that happens
[1:11:46] Lord nothing's the same Lord Peter Lord
[1:11:50] when he had that Revelation strike his
[1:11:52] soul lord I'm sure Nothing Was the Same
[1:11:54] Lord because the Lord it was revealed to
[1:11:56] him exactly who you were so Lord I pray
[1:11:59] tonight that would be the the Lord the
[1:12:01] tonight what you would do to each and
[1:12:03] every heart is reveal who you are to
[1:12:06] your people we pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:12:08] name we commit this weekend now in this
[1:12:10] service amen
[1:12:12] hey man you may have receipts
[1:12:18] I'm still as nervous as I was four years
[1:12:20] ago
[1:12:21] nothing's changed there I can tell you
[1:12:23] that
[1:12:25] we'll just take a little scripture we'll
[1:12:28] enjoy the the word tonight
[1:12:31] The Hours come I'm going to just take a
[1:12:33] little bit I want to speak tonight about
[1:12:34] the bride's moment
[1:12:36] the bride's moment
[1:12:38] and it we have little moments we would
[1:12:40] call it what a moment in life is maybe
[1:12:42] just a short
[1:12:44] little piece of time something that we
[1:12:47] we can live we you know a capturable
[1:12:49] moment or something we live we go
[1:12:50] through a little event we say well I
[1:12:52] want a great moment that was I just
[1:12:53] don't know how amazing that that time
[1:12:55] was and I pray maybe this will be that
[1:12:57] at the end of these next few days you
[1:12:59] say what a moment we had in the presence
[1:13:01] of the Lord and so that'll be a time
[1:13:02] that you can you capture in your memory
[1:13:04] say wow what a moment that was right we
[1:13:07] so we have these These Times our lives
[1:13:09] are filled with moments is essentially
[1:13:10] what happens I think even Apple has got
[1:13:12] that figured out you know when they pop
[1:13:14] up on your phone you know a new moment
[1:13:15] and so they put a whole bunch of
[1:13:17] pictures together you say yeah exactly I
[1:13:19] got a couple Apple people here with me
[1:13:20] all right you see that and so that's
[1:13:22] what it is these are these are moments
[1:13:24] in time but sometimes you know we miss
[1:13:27] moments uh you know they pass by like
[1:13:30] this fast and and we just don't miss it
[1:13:33] we say wow I wish I really held on to
[1:13:34] that that aspect of my life or maybe
[1:13:36] that portion of time maybe we'll this
[1:13:38] weekend will blow by and you'll be like
[1:13:39] man I just didn't pay attention the way
[1:13:41] I should have but that moment is now
[1:13:43] gone
[1:13:44] and so we want to hold on to that amen
[1:13:46] life does that it just like Fades it's
[1:13:48] like Vapor scripture said life is like a
[1:13:50] vapor right and so it just kind of goes
[1:13:52] like a puff of smoke it just suddenly
[1:13:54] the time is gone and the moment has
[1:13:56] disappeared and that happens that
[1:13:58] probably the older ones in here to be
[1:13:59] like yeah where did time go now you know
[1:14:01] from the kids to the grandkids and it
[1:14:02] just disappeared on you and suddenly
[1:14:04] it's uh you know time is gone and you're
[1:14:06] wishing oh to be back at 20 or 25 or 40.
[1:14:11] okay maybe you're not surely somebody's
[1:14:15] wishing they could go back to 20.
[1:14:18] I'm wishing I could go back to 20.
[1:14:22] but people don't we don't pay attention
[1:14:23] to moments sometimes many times many
[1:14:26] times I I know you've all seen it it's
[1:14:28] an easy way to to give an example but uh
[1:14:31] you know everybody goes to like a big
[1:14:33] event and they're just like yeah this is
[1:14:34] amazing
[1:14:36] right they're taking they're looking at
[1:14:37] the moment through this device right
[1:14:39] here they're like yeah let's just you
[1:14:40] know a big family deal or maybe a real
[1:14:42] special time you're like yeah this is
[1:14:44] yeah let's take the picture and they
[1:14:45] live the moment through this
[1:14:48] everything's going on around them and
[1:14:50] they're like yeah this four and a half
[1:14:51] inch screen is just the best way to take
[1:14:53] it in so take the moment in here and
[1:14:55] they actually miss what's going on
[1:14:58] right
[1:15:01] and I wonder how many how many years are
[1:15:05] going to pass by they said man how many
[1:15:07] moments did I really miss
[1:15:09] how many moments have I missed thus far
[1:15:11] and so we want to capture we want to we
[1:15:12] want to live right here we want to live
[1:15:14] in the now right we want to live kind of
[1:15:17] right now everything to God is right now
[1:15:19] God don't have past or future he has now
[1:15:22] and so time is an interesting concept
[1:15:24] okay we we consume ourselves with time
[1:15:28] don't we and uh and we consume ourselves
[1:15:31] with the passing of it we're concerned
[1:15:32] with future and we're concerned with
[1:15:34] with the past and and so it actually it
[1:15:37] stops us from enjoying
[1:15:39] the presence of now
[1:15:41] the presence of right now and we
[1:15:42] actually get duped into into remaining
[1:15:45] in two different places we get either we
[1:15:48] get we either have to we stay either in
[1:15:50] past and mulling over what has happened
[1:15:52] and we we Ponder this and we think about
[1:15:54] the past and we really chew on that one
[1:15:57] or or we're into the other side and
[1:15:59] we're waiting constantly for what's
[1:16:01] happening ahead of us we're always oh
[1:16:03] you know what's my future going to be
[1:16:04] like or what I'm going to do when I grow
[1:16:06] up and all these types of things and so
[1:16:07] we're stuck in either the past or the
[1:16:10] future but those are really you can't
[1:16:12] really hold on to those moments you know
[1:16:15] the past is it's I can't grab it and I
[1:16:18] can't grab the future but I'm living
[1:16:19] right here right now it's a tangible
[1:16:22] piece of time I can touch it because
[1:16:25] it's right here it's right now but 15
[1:16:27] minutes from now I got nothing nothing
[1:16:31] so how much do we stay back there and
[1:16:33] few past and how often do we stay trying
[1:16:35] to look in the future and we miss the
[1:16:37] moment we missed it now
[1:16:41] and so we get distracted
[1:16:43] in these aspects
[1:16:45] but you know we're all unavoidably
[1:16:47] victims of time to some degree
[1:16:50] because it's become accepted state of
[1:16:52] Norm in this fast-paced kind of highly
[1:16:54] motivated world that we live in very
[1:16:56] high strung I would I'm sure you'd all
[1:16:58] agree but it's important that we
[1:17:01] understand to not be present is to be
[1:17:04] torn between essentially these two
[1:17:06] worlds it's in one or the other and
[1:17:09] neither of them exist at the end of the
[1:17:12] day it's just kind of something out
[1:17:13] there and it's something back there but
[1:17:15] this moment right here right now it
[1:17:19] exists right now
[1:17:21] that's what you have
[1:17:27] man so many people they Ponder the past
[1:17:30] can't get past maybe a grudge can't get
[1:17:32] past maybe a memory of something that
[1:17:34] happened to them something it's
[1:17:35] hindering them and they get stuck there
[1:17:38] and they never actually ever really can
[1:17:40] move forward and some some people
[1:17:42] brother Brandon even talks about those
[1:17:44] that build Bridges and they worry so
[1:17:46] much they become so nervous because
[1:17:48] they're they're building these bridges
[1:17:49] in life in their mind he says they
[1:17:51] actually never come to pass they don't
[1:17:54] even happen and so you get so worried
[1:17:55] about future and just miss everything
[1:17:59] forget the past
[1:18:01] don't live in a rearview mirror
[1:18:03] you don't drive that way do you I sure
[1:18:05] hope not you're going down the road and
[1:18:07] you're like yeah and you're looking in
[1:18:08] the rearview mirror the whole time no
[1:18:10] I'm sorry please tell me what would
[1:18:12] happen
[1:18:13] yeah we'd crash you're done
[1:18:17] so don't live life that way live it in
[1:18:19] the rear view mirror oh my everything
[1:18:21] that happened in the past and what this
[1:18:22] happened how this happened to me this
[1:18:24] person did that to me oh why did they do
[1:18:25] that oh my goodness and you're gonna
[1:18:26] crash because you have no clue what's
[1:18:28] going on right now just move on well I
[1:18:30] even said that forgive those things
[1:18:31] which are behind
[1:18:36] very fast-paced world you know I can
[1:18:38] imagine
[1:18:39] I was thinking about this When I Was
[1:18:40] preparing for and I was thinking about
[1:18:42] what it what would have happened
[1:18:45] to the at the pool of Bethesda if you
[1:18:48] got lost in the past
[1:18:50] or the future
[1:18:51] and you were sitting there on your on
[1:18:54] the steps to the pool or something like
[1:18:56] that and maybe you could have been right
[1:18:57] there right at the front end of it and
[1:19:00] you could have been sitting there in
[1:19:01] your in your tatters or your your
[1:19:03] Affliction of some sort and you could
[1:19:05] get lost lost in how come I'm this way
[1:19:08] and how good has happened to me and your
[1:19:10] mind is just wandered off or what's
[1:19:12] gonna happen to me in the future I can't
[1:19:14] even find my my food for tomorrow and
[1:19:16] you're sitting there and you get lost in
[1:19:17] it and the angel starts to trouble the
[1:19:19] water and you're somewhere else
[1:19:21] somewhere in your mind somewhere in the
[1:19:23] past somewhere in the future and you
[1:19:25] miss the moment someone else is like the
[1:19:28] water's moving and I'm in and you're
[1:19:29] like whoa but I was right there and you
[1:19:30] missed it
[1:19:33] missed the moment
[1:19:36] help us tonight
[1:19:37] as the angel starts to stir the waters
[1:19:39] as he starts to stir this weekend in
[1:19:42] your soul you say oh no I don't want to
[1:19:44] be my mind somewhere else pondering
[1:19:46] about what tomorrow may hold right now
[1:19:48] the Angels turn the water saying look up
[1:19:51] your Redemption draws now the water is
[1:19:54] turned you need to be right attentive is
[1:19:58] that have been really lame
[1:20:00] to miss it
[1:20:03] miss it
[1:20:05] but Abraham says I see a woman sitting
[1:20:07] way back there she's got a blue and
[1:20:09] white polka dot dress she's got a lump
[1:20:12] in her left side have faith don't doubt
[1:20:15] don't miss it
[1:20:17] oh God Miss Griffith have faith in God
[1:20:21] believe with all your heart and the
[1:20:22] almighty will heal and make you well
[1:20:25] you know how many he says that number of
[1:20:27] times to people he says don't miss it oh
[1:20:30] God he then he calls out their name
[1:20:31] because he's trying to catch their
[1:20:33] attention don't miss the moment the
[1:20:35] angel is moving right beside you he's
[1:20:37] right over you don't miss it
[1:20:42] he says if you can only take a spiritual
[1:20:44] Looking Glass
[1:20:46] and look into your soul he says and
[1:20:48] you'd find out what it looks like he
[1:20:49] says the greatest devil and the chiefest
[1:20:52] of all is unbelief
[1:20:55] is unbelief
[1:20:58] how about demon of doubt
[1:21:00] wages
[1:21:01] and has claimed so many
[1:21:04] and I want to take this this this aspect
[1:21:07] of Doubt because I want to bring it and
[1:21:09] tie it together with missing your moment
[1:21:11] because somebody so often people miss
[1:21:14] their moment because they're doubting
[1:21:16] what God is able to do for them and so
[1:21:19] that's what brother Brian had to stir
[1:21:20] their their faith up call their name out
[1:21:22] and say don't you know don't basically
[1:21:24] don't disbelieve don't doubt because
[1:21:26] they're sitting there well you know I
[1:21:28] don't know is this really Mrs so-and-so
[1:21:30] Mrs Griffith catch their attention their
[1:21:33] faith spikes because doubt is hanging
[1:21:35] there trying to hinder the moving of God
[1:21:39] in your life
[1:21:41] and miss your moment
[1:21:43] that's all the devil's really caring
[1:21:44] about tonight he's just sitting here
[1:21:46] what can I do to distract you so that
[1:21:50] you miss the moment this weekend tonight
[1:21:53] even and so he's going to throw whatever
[1:21:55] he can at you he's throwing to all you
[1:21:57] teenagers something about tomorrow or
[1:21:59] your schoolwork or your work or
[1:22:00] something like that or your friends
[1:22:01] doing this or this is happening and how
[1:22:03] can they put that on Instagram I mean
[1:22:05] that no so he's there he's just throwing
[1:22:07] at you something
[1:22:08] so did you miss the moment
[1:22:13] and doubt the chiefest of all Devils is
[1:22:16] what better Branham says is the Kingpin
[1:22:19] of trying to do that and hinder God
[1:22:21] moving in your life
[1:22:23] if we look at Cain as an extreme example
[1:22:26] he was he here he was with Abel God had
[1:22:29] just said hey just do as your brother
[1:22:30] who is your brother Abel simple
[1:22:33] he was in this moment here the sacrifice
[1:22:36] if he had just done that his sacrifice
[1:22:37] would have been accepted he labored Cain
[1:22:40] was a good old church boy and here he
[1:22:42] was in the Garden of Eden but Abraham
[1:22:43] says there was no scriptures written the
[1:22:45] two boys came neighbor they both wanted
[1:22:47] to make a sacrifice and find favor with
[1:22:48] God and he says so Cain Khan built an
[1:22:51] altar Abel built an altar well if that's
[1:22:53] all God requires God would be unjust to
[1:22:55] condemn Cain so Cain made a sacrifice so
[1:22:58] did Abel Cain worshiped so did Abel Cain
[1:23:01] did everything Abel did so if a church
[1:23:03] so if belonging to church going to
[1:23:06] church making sacrifice praying and
[1:23:08] worshiping to God is all God requires
[1:23:10] then God would be unjust to condemn Cain
[1:23:14] so there's got to be more than that
[1:23:17] got him more than that but Kane doubted
[1:23:20] and disbelieved really what happened in
[1:23:23] the garden he didn't he didn't believe
[1:23:24] so he would he was not going to believe
[1:23:26] well here's Abel he's killing a lamb
[1:23:28] he's he's put a completely different
[1:23:30] sacrifice and he said no there's no way
[1:23:33] I've got the the fruits this is the
[1:23:35] fruits of my labor this is what I'm
[1:23:36] doing he had no he had no desire he
[1:23:38] couldn't there was nothing even in him
[1:23:39] to believe that and to say well you know
[1:23:42] and accept the sacrifice and that that
[1:23:45] unbelief and that doubt hindered him
[1:23:47] from having an accepted sacrifice
[1:23:52] it wasn't even in him it wasn't even in
[1:23:55] him but so that's an extreme example
[1:23:57] doubt raining in his heart imagine poor
[1:24:02] Noah's naysayers
[1:24:03] you know this is what hindered them
[1:24:05] really it's gonna rain Noah what even is
[1:24:08] that you're telling me water's coming
[1:24:09] from the sky it's gonna it's gonna
[1:24:11] sprinkle down and and there's going to
[1:24:12] be enough of it to flood this place
[1:24:14] you're insane I've never even seen this
[1:24:16] before what even is that God we get
[1:24:18] moisture from the ground but no but God
[1:24:21] told me
[1:24:22] don't believe it don't believe forget it
[1:24:24] Noah you're you're off your rocker into
[1:24:26] the world are you kidding me you mean
[1:24:28] this place is going to completely be
[1:24:29] destroyed and God just spoke to you
[1:24:34] right because what was happening was
[1:24:36] doubt unbelief that was hindering them
[1:24:38] from being saved
[1:24:42] yes I think of those like Nicodemus who
[1:24:43] came to his moment my goodness Nicodemus
[1:24:45] came to Jesus by night he had a secret
[1:24:47] meeting with Jesus he had a face-to-face
[1:24:49] encounter he was in the presence of the
[1:24:52] Almighty
[1:24:54] yes
[1:24:55] how is this that we must be born again
[1:24:59] I have to re-enter my mother's womb he
[1:25:02] just couldn't get there how can this be
[1:25:05] and doubt was raining there I don't even
[1:25:08] see how this can be it and see he was
[1:25:10] trying but doubt was hindering him here
[1:25:12] he was face to face with Christ can you
[1:25:15] imagine that
[1:25:16] not many people had a one-on-one private
[1:25:20] moment
[1:25:23] some were going through the crowds they
[1:25:25] were just we'll get there just trying to
[1:25:27] get there there was hundreds of people
[1:25:28] but Nicodemus had a private meeting by
[1:25:32] night
[1:25:34] and he misses moment
[1:25:37] he couldn't believe
[1:25:38] he doubt was raining there Rich Young
[1:25:40] Ruler same same aspect another
[1:25:43] one-on-one encounter but just couldn't
[1:25:45] believe the words that were being said
[1:25:47] just sell all you have just give your
[1:25:49] possessions and follow me nah
[1:25:52] is that really what I need to do really
[1:25:54] I mean if I have all my possessions I
[1:25:56] could make a huge tithe check and the
[1:25:58] work of you know the work of the
[1:26:00] disciples and Jesus would be just
[1:26:02] greatly benefited sell everything I got
[1:26:05] nah and again
[1:26:08] found himself in hell
[1:26:11] imagine Judas he also walked with Christ
[1:26:14] day to day
[1:26:16] but his heart impenetrable
[1:26:20] those at Pentecost
[1:26:21] these are on new wine
[1:26:23] they weren't catching the moment
[1:26:25] what God was doing
[1:26:27] and so doubt
[1:26:29] he's out there Desiring to hinder a move
[1:26:33] within some when God's people he's chief
[1:26:36] chief is chief of the devil that's what
[1:26:38] he is
[1:26:39] and so they're there to create confusion
[1:26:41] create uncertainty and just cast a
[1:26:44] little bit of Reasonable Doubt
[1:26:47] that's a legal term actually just a
[1:26:50] reasonable doubt if you can get enough
[1:26:52] of that the jury is like well you know I
[1:26:54] don't know if I can believe this
[1:26:56] it'll throw it out of court because
[1:26:58] there's Reasonable Doubt this didn't
[1:27:00] happen right and so that's really all
[1:27:02] the devil is trying to do he's just
[1:27:04] trying to cast enough Reasonable Doubt
[1:27:06] really is that really what God is
[1:27:08] Desiring is that really what I need to
[1:27:10] do just enough just needs a little
[1:27:12] Shadow of Doubt
[1:27:16] he says Butter Brown says the devil
[1:27:18] would like to prove that different he's
[1:27:21] trying to be he talks about him being
[1:27:23] trying to be exposed he hates to be
[1:27:24] exposed in those books he is exposed for
[1:27:27] exactly what he is Jesus said about
[1:27:28] Satan he has no pardon me I have no
[1:27:30] pardon him and he says the devil would
[1:27:31] love to prove that different but he
[1:27:33] cannot so he does all he can to destroy
[1:27:36] confidence in the word okay why do you
[1:27:40] think all of this message all this
[1:27:42] message is tough and believe the sign
[1:27:43] and all this aspect because he's just
[1:27:45] trying to destroy confidence in the word
[1:27:47] it's a tactic of the devil see it for
[1:27:49] what it is it's just trying to put doubt
[1:27:51] in you and I's heart
[1:27:53] yeah amen when the church disbelieves
[1:27:56] Satan and believes the spirit of
[1:27:57] revelation of the word the gates of hell
[1:28:00] cannot Prevail amen and so forget that
[1:28:03] reject the Reasonable Doubt he's just
[1:28:05] trying to play something in your heart
[1:28:09] can you imagine
[1:28:10] God's Court law didn't work that way
[1:28:13] this doesn't work that way so you'd
[1:28:15] think in the in the current man's idea
[1:28:17] or I should say in Satan's Court he
[1:28:19] would bring up those Noah those
[1:28:21] scientists in Noah's days they'd tell
[1:28:23] them all about the scientific
[1:28:24] achievement of the day and why there's
[1:28:26] no moisture in the air and why there's
[1:28:28] just an impossibility for it to flood
[1:28:30] and where the moisture is going to come
[1:28:31] from it's completely lunacy and so they
[1:28:34] would be casting not just Reasonable
[1:28:35] Doubt incredible amounts of doubt
[1:28:38] but God's court of law isn't working
[1:28:39] that way we can say it that way he says
[1:28:42] no if Noah God understand and he'd just
[1:28:44] say well God spoke to me and he told me
[1:28:47] that it's going to have a flood and I
[1:28:49] must build an ark and I believed it well
[1:28:52] in God's court of law he's saying that's
[1:28:54] that's the way it would go he'd throw
[1:28:57] the gala down and say case dismissed out
[1:28:59] of court it's totally opposite God wants
[1:29:02] Faith he wants you to believe he wants
[1:29:04] you to cast inside reasoning cast aside
[1:29:06] all doubt
[1:29:09] a man
[1:29:12] I wonder
[1:29:14] if you put no if you put yourself on the
[1:29:16] stand
[1:29:17] what would your testimony be
[1:29:20] we don't want to be on the Reasonable
[1:29:22] Doubt side
[1:29:23] you'll say no
[1:29:24] God sent a message
[1:29:26] God sent a prophet
[1:29:28] God came in my day and unveiled himself
[1:29:31] before me and sent a message to capture
[1:29:34] my heart oh really that's what you
[1:29:36] believe in Satan's gonna throw it in you
[1:29:38] really well what about all this all
[1:29:40] these different issues with the cloud
[1:29:41] this and that and the other really and
[1:29:43] he's just going to throw a little bit of
[1:29:44] this a little bit of Doubt on God's core
[1:29:46] understand you say ah I believe it I
[1:29:49] might not understand it all but I
[1:29:51] believe it and he's saying bam case
[1:29:53] dismissed
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:59] I really don't care how many Fall Away
[1:30:02] for one reason or another
[1:30:05] Branham actually says he goes you know
[1:30:06] he says you've seen so many
[1:30:09] impersonators come along saying this and
[1:30:11] glory to God I got this and Hallelujah I
[1:30:13] got this and you find out they haven't
[1:30:16] got nothing
[1:30:18] this is a quote and the devil did that
[1:30:20] to rise a doubt in your heart
[1:30:25] look at that
[1:30:27] you find they got nothing and the rise
[1:30:29] of doubt in your heart he did that
[1:30:31] purposely to do that but remember
[1:30:35] if the devil's going to do that and put
[1:30:37] an impersonator in our midst just to
[1:30:40] rise in doubt in your heart amen you say
[1:30:43] well you know what really a fake here
[1:30:45] and some how come that person you know
[1:30:47] left in the Years hey over the years
[1:30:48] you've seen a lot of people come and go
[1:30:50] this is how it is but it's purposely
[1:30:51] done to rise it down in your heart but
[1:30:54] brother Branham says he goes but
[1:30:55] remember the only remember that only
[1:30:58] says one thing that if there's an
[1:31:00] impersonator there is a genuine if
[1:31:03] there's an imposter there's the real
[1:31:05] thing there's gonna be somebody somebody
[1:31:08] that's gonna say no I'm the real thing I
[1:31:11] don't care what you do I don't care what
[1:31:13] you doubt but I believe it 100 percent
[1:31:16] hey man he says there's a genuine Holy
[1:31:19] Ghost there's a genuine spirit of God
[1:31:21] there's a genuine power of God there is
[1:31:23] a Son of God that's reflecting himself
[1:31:26] tonight as the Holy Spirit to show forth
[1:31:29] his life he's standing here tonight in
[1:31:32] the midst of you Amen in the form of the
[1:31:35] Holy Spirit to pound all the dross out
[1:31:38] of you all the doubts out of you and
[1:31:41] reflect to you the resurrection amen he
[1:31:44] said he's not dead oh sir
[1:31:47] hey man he's alive
[1:31:50] a man's a doubts
[1:31:52] trying to hinder you from from receiving
[1:31:55] in your moment what God has ordained for
[1:31:58] you but Abraham says the chiefest of all
[1:32:01] and so now it can hinder somebody from
[1:32:04] receiving what God has designed for them
[1:32:06] if you read in Matthew 13 it says and
[1:32:08] when he'd come to his own country
[1:32:09] speaking of Jesus he taught them in
[1:32:11] their synagogue in so much that they
[1:32:13] were astonished and said when's hath
[1:32:15] this man this wisdom and these Mighty
[1:32:17] works is this not The Carpenter's son is
[1:32:20] not this his mother it's called Mary and
[1:32:22] his brother and are James and and Joseph
[1:32:24] and Simon and Judas and his sisters are
[1:32:26] they not with us as well so they're just
[1:32:28] talking to themselves when when's had
[1:32:31] this man done all these things and
[1:32:33] they're offended him in him
[1:32:35] but Jesus said unto them he said a
[1:32:38] prophet's not on not without honoring
[1:32:40] his own country and in his own house and
[1:32:42] he did not many mighty works because of
[1:32:48] their unbelief
[1:32:50] think of it
[1:32:51] because of their unbelief
[1:32:54] here the king of glory was walking in
[1:32:57] their midst
[1:32:58] it where isn't that his son his or his
[1:33:01] brothers James and his sisters and such
[1:33:03] this is all they could see
[1:33:05] because of their unbelief and he said
[1:33:07] the scripture says and he did not many
[1:33:10] mighty works because of their unbelief
[1:33:13] it's not because Jesus lacked power
[1:33:16] because they wouldn't believe
[1:33:19] and he was there and he could have done
[1:33:20] so much for them but they said I don't
[1:33:23] believe it cannot be who is this
[1:33:28] but I am so glad tonight
[1:33:31] that there is something
[1:33:34] that God is able to penetrate that demon
[1:33:38] of doubt it is not it might be the most
[1:33:41] powerful in Hell's domain but it is not
[1:33:45] the most powerful in God's domain amen
[1:33:48] and butter Branham talks about this he
[1:33:50] actually talks about there's those that
[1:33:51] are that are just straight unbelievers
[1:33:53] they're just they don't even have the
[1:33:55] seed inside of them to believe but he
[1:33:58] said that's different he says that there
[1:34:00] he actually tells them to leave the
[1:34:01] service at the end in prayer lines and
[1:34:03] when he's Discerning he says if you
[1:34:05] don't believe he said I just recommend
[1:34:06] you get out okay because it would be a
[1:34:08] bad it's a it was a terrible time a
[1:34:10] terrible position to be in as God is
[1:34:12] moving in the service and they don't
[1:34:14] believe he said but as a Believer he
[1:34:17] said if there he talked about a
[1:34:18] Christian he says you might just have
[1:34:20] weak faith
[1:34:22] he says well he goes we can take care of
[1:34:24] them
[1:34:33] the moving of God in your life
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:38] and so he gave an example he said there
[1:34:40] was a man in a service he said service
[1:34:42] after service brother Brandon would come
[1:34:44] to the come to the the uh at the end of
[1:34:46] a service he said who who would like to
[1:34:48] receive Christ
[1:34:49] who would like to receive Christ tonight
[1:34:51] and and this young man he would stand up
[1:34:53] and he'd acknowledge yes I I want to
[1:34:55] serve the Lord and I want to give my
[1:34:57] life to the Lord and so then brother
[1:34:58] Branham he'd pray for the different ones
[1:35:00] that did that and and he'd do it again
[1:35:02] at next service or so he'd say well who
[1:35:04] would like to give their Hawks to the
[1:35:05] Lord and stand for Christ and this man
[1:35:07] would stand up again I want to stand for
[1:35:10] Christ oh okay and brother Brandon
[1:35:11] praise from the game he'd do it again
[1:35:13] and again and again he said this
[1:35:16] happened many times and months passed he
[1:35:18] said even Revival is coming he would
[1:35:20] stand you know and he then brother Brown
[1:35:23] says mine this is it just didn't quite
[1:35:25] you know he didn't need to talk to this
[1:35:27] man and so brother Brown went out and
[1:35:28] and uh seen him on the street
[1:35:31] and he says uh are you a Christian yet
[1:35:36] after many times standing up he had
[1:35:39] something in his heart he had a yearning
[1:35:41] he had to hit a desire but something
[1:35:43] just wasn't clicking for him he just
[1:35:45] wasn't able to really press through in a
[1:35:48] set so so brother brother Branham beats
[1:35:49] him on the street and says you a
[1:35:51] Christian yet
[1:35:53] you know what his response was he says
[1:35:54] no I said well he's honest you know he'd
[1:35:59] stood up
[1:36:00] many times
[1:36:01] here brother Brandon I was asking him he
[1:36:03] says no
[1:36:04] he says but remember me
[1:36:06] so that was what an appropriate response
[1:36:10] he says now
[1:36:13] he did this again then in another
[1:36:15] service
[1:36:16] and he said he said now those that like
[1:36:18] to stand for Christ if you'd like to
[1:36:19] give your heart to the Lord this is
[1:36:21] after this time in the street he said I
[1:36:23] said to him Little Brown says I said
[1:36:24] come here a minute
[1:36:26] he walked up think about this
[1:36:28] so now come here a minute he says what's
[1:36:30] the matter with you
[1:36:32] this is better Branham
[1:36:34] imagine if someone stood in the church
[1:36:36] and better better David said you know
[1:36:38] who would like to give their heart to
[1:36:39] the Lord tonight he'll just stand and
[1:36:40] give their life to Christ and a few of
[1:36:42] you would stand up and maybe someone say
[1:36:44] no I'm consecrating my life to him and
[1:36:46] Brother David said you know I've seen
[1:36:47] that person stand up like 15 times he's
[1:36:49] saying come here a minute I want to talk
[1:36:52] to you
[1:36:53] this is what brother Brown did
[1:36:57] he says what's the matter with you
[1:36:59] he says I don't know
[1:37:01] I said do you want to become a Christian
[1:37:04] okay he says yes sir
[1:37:07] he says well why don't you become a
[1:37:09] Christian
[1:37:10] he said I don't know
[1:37:12] I said there's just something
[1:37:15] he says down in your heart you want to
[1:37:17] be a Christian
[1:37:19] but there's something that won't let you
[1:37:21] be a Christian is that right
[1:37:24] he said that's it
[1:37:26] I said brother Brian he said that's a
[1:37:28] devil
[1:37:29] he said and that's unbelief
[1:37:31] and I said you believe that
[1:37:35] look at how simple this is
[1:37:37] you believe that
[1:37:39] my goodness something though was rising
[1:37:42] up and starting to strike this man's
[1:37:44] heart it was just brother Brandon was
[1:37:47] Discerning what it was he says that's
[1:37:49] just unbelief not the unbeliever that
[1:37:51] doesn't even have it there he had
[1:37:52] something in his heart that desired God
[1:37:55] to come in and change him but he was
[1:37:57] being hindered by something but Abraham
[1:37:59] says it's the devil it's unbelief you
[1:38:02] believe that he said yes sir I said Do
[1:38:05] you believe if I'll ask God to break
[1:38:07] that power of unbelief above you that
[1:38:11] you'll be a Christian
[1:38:13] amen he said yes sir amen and in just
[1:38:17] that time we bowed our head he let out a
[1:38:19] scream he jumped in the air like that
[1:38:21] and it was gone and the man is a staunch
[1:38:24] Christian today amen he said Do you
[1:38:27] believe if I pray that that power of
[1:38:30] unbelief above you you'll be a Christian
[1:38:32] just that simple just as simple yes I
[1:38:35] believe you could be in that exact
[1:38:37] position tonight you could have stood up
[1:38:40] 18 times over the last five years
[1:38:42] Desiring something of God to move you
[1:38:45] but it's just something a little demon
[1:38:47] of Doubt but the same God that delivered
[1:38:49] that man if you said Lord there's a
[1:38:52] demon of unbelief that is trying to
[1:38:54] cause me doubt but at your word it's
[1:38:57] your word it can be gone because it
[1:39:00] cannot have power over your God he might
[1:39:03] have might be the cheapest but he cannot
[1:39:05] cannot overcome the power of almighty
[1:39:08] God
[1:39:10] he said watch just the devil that
[1:39:13] unbelieved that little old snickering
[1:39:15] thing there little Shadow to keep him
[1:39:17] from breaking into it
[1:39:20] recognize it for what it is it's just a
[1:39:22] shadow that's trying to stop you from
[1:39:25] breaking into it
[1:39:29] amen but the power of God
[1:39:33] the power of almighty God
[1:39:35] is greater than
[1:39:37] greater than every darkness and every
[1:39:41] enemy amen and something revealed to him
[1:39:44] he says my
[1:39:45] and he believed it and it was over in a
[1:39:49] moment
[1:39:50] he had a moment
[1:39:51] he was in the moment he could have been
[1:39:53] why is he calling me up like that why is
[1:39:56] he pulling me out like that in the
[1:39:57] audience and making me embarrassed like
[1:39:59] that because he was concerned over his
[1:40:01] soul that's all that mattered he said
[1:40:03] young man I want to talk to you you come
[1:40:05] here and here he was in the presence of
[1:40:07] a prophet he said it's a demon of
[1:40:09] unbelief you believe that I do you
[1:40:11] believe if I pray the power of darkness
[1:40:13] is gone I do done
[1:40:16] over it's that simple it's not a
[1:40:19] complicated thing this is do you believe
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:28] faith to believe a better Brian says
[1:40:31] there's a revelation
[1:40:33] he says the importance of Revelation by
[1:40:35] the spirit to a True Believer can never
[1:40:37] be overemphasized never ever be
[1:40:40] overemphasized he said it means more to
[1:40:42] you
[1:40:43] the Revelation your Revelation he says
[1:40:46] which is Faith it means more to you than
[1:40:48] perhaps you realize
[1:40:50] he says no I'm not talking about the
[1:40:52] Book of Revelation I'm talking about all
[1:40:54] Revelation it's tremendously important
[1:40:57] to the church amen because we know the
[1:41:00] gates of hell can't Prevail against it
[1:41:01] is what the scripture says
[1:41:04] Butter Brown says how could God build
[1:41:06] the church Upon A man speaking of those
[1:41:08] thinking that it was Peter that they
[1:41:10] were building the church on that he
[1:41:11] denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while
[1:41:12] doing it can't build his church Upon A
[1:41:14] man born in sin and it wasn't some rock
[1:41:16] laying out there as though God had
[1:41:18] hallowed the ground at that spot he said
[1:41:20] and isn't as the Protestant State the
[1:41:22] church is built on Jesus it was on
[1:41:24] Revelation read it the way it's written
[1:41:26] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but
[1:41:29] my father hath revealed it and Upon This
[1:41:32] Rock Revelation I'll build my church he
[1:41:35] said the church is built on Revelation
[1:41:37] and that is what the devil is wanting to
[1:41:40] hinder you from his from from receiving
[1:41:42] and causing the devil because if you can
[1:41:44] get that if he can drop a revelation in
[1:41:47] your heart of who he is he cannot
[1:41:49] Prevail over you
[1:41:54] brother Brian he says he says it Expo
[1:41:57] Revelation exposes Satan it Reveals His
[1:42:00] Works he says he fights that he can't
[1:42:04] stand that to the devil now he knows
[1:42:06] that if he can get the people but this
[1:42:08] is speaking the Lord if he knows even
[1:42:09] get the people true revelation of the
[1:42:11] true church and what she is what she
[1:42:14] stands for and that she can do the
[1:42:16] Greater Works she's an invincible Army
[1:42:18] amen so why do you think the devil is
[1:42:20] trying to send out his chief one get
[1:42:22] down get out there I need the biggest
[1:42:24] guns of hell out there because I can't
[1:42:27] get them to believe that they're an
[1:42:28] invincible Army so I'm going to make
[1:42:30] them doubt who they are doubt that
[1:42:32] they're a child of God doubt that God
[1:42:34] can conquer everything and they'll be
[1:42:37] not invincible
[1:42:40] and Satan he says will be powerless
[1:42:41] before him he'll be he said he will be
[1:42:45] as definitely thwarted today as when
[1:42:46] Christ withstood his every effort to
[1:42:48] gain power over him in the desert he
[1:42:50] says oh we love it Satan hates it but we
[1:42:53] love it amen may God pour it on
[1:42:57] each and every one of us amen
[1:43:00] fat butter brownie even says the Visage
[1:43:01] of Satan is actually he even changes his
[1:43:03] countenance when he's being exposed hey
[1:43:06] man can you imagine he says you see
[1:43:07] those faces Satan knows he's going to be
[1:43:09] exposed when something's being revealed
[1:43:11] to somebody he says in the most peculiar
[1:43:13] change comes over their countenance he
[1:43:14] says Satan is afraid
[1:43:17] let's change his face tonight Satan's
[1:43:20] afraid he's afraid that something's
[1:43:22] going to be imparted into your soul and
[1:43:24] say oh his whole face changes he drops
[1:43:27] with just complete dismay in all sorrow
[1:43:29] are you kidding me they're getting it
[1:43:31] tonight change his face tonight till God
[1:43:34] cast that demon of Doubt away I want to
[1:43:37] receive everything I want this moment to
[1:43:39] be mine
[1:43:41] Hallelujah
[1:43:45] hey man
[1:43:47] it's different
[1:43:49] it's not learning
[1:43:50] it's not message teaching and just oh
[1:43:52] you know what just learn it you're
[1:43:53] learning your ABCs something different
[1:43:55] than that if you can learn it you can
[1:43:57] unlearn it but when it is dropped in
[1:43:59] your soul when it's something that Wells
[1:44:02] up and it just strikes you say oh my
[1:44:04] goodness that's Jesus Christ he's my
[1:44:07] savior I was a wretch but now I'm free I
[1:44:10] was lost but now I'm found and God
[1:44:12] revealed who he is to you that's why
[1:44:14] they're gonna be those here that are
[1:44:15] here for 40 years 50 years 60 years
[1:44:18] because nothing can change you
[1:44:20] yeah
[1:44:22] and they're standing in the face of the
[1:44:24] enemy saying yeah Impostors imposters
[1:44:26] but genuine
[1:44:28] genuine
[1:44:29] that's why we have our veterans in front
[1:44:31] of us and you we respect them with
[1:44:33] everyone because they've been standing
[1:44:35] high waters come enemy has come and
[1:44:38] battered them and bruised them but
[1:44:40] they're still standing
[1:44:49] amen it's a precious place where God
[1:44:52] reveals himself to you they're precious
[1:44:55] moments
[1:44:57] so precious brother Brown he says he
[1:44:59] says the devil can lie he says he can
[1:45:01] get those five senses and lie to you
[1:45:05] but he can't touch that super sense of
[1:45:09] Faith he can't touch it
[1:45:12] that's why he hates it
[1:45:13] that's why he combats it that's why he
[1:45:16] don't want you to get to church that's
[1:45:17] why he don't want you on your knees
[1:45:19] that's why he don't want you in the
[1:45:20] scripture that's why he doesn't want you
[1:45:22] reading a message because he's combating
[1:45:24] he hates it he can put everything he can
[1:45:26] lie to you on every level but he cannot
[1:45:28] get his little fingers on so on your
[1:45:31] Sixth Sense
[1:45:33] hey man it's beyond his reach Amen
[1:45:36] brother Brown says it's called faith
[1:45:37] faith is that great thing amen it's a
[1:45:40] place where God reveals to you that you
[1:45:42] alone are more than able amen beyond the
[1:45:45] reach of Darkness beyond the reach of
[1:45:47] Doubt beyond the reach of the enemy he
[1:45:49] can't grasp it there it's that sacred
[1:45:51] Sans place
[1:45:57] he says when doubts come fears begin to
[1:45:59] rise there's always that certain place
[1:46:01] that you can go back to that time where
[1:46:04] God met you and the devil can't tread on
[1:46:07] those sacred Sands
[1:46:09] he could tread on a lot of places he can
[1:46:12] bring up memory and he can storm Polo
[1:46:13] over it he can bring up imagination he
[1:46:15] can just ride like a chariot like jehu
[1:46:18] all through it and he can tread all over
[1:46:19] but there's a spacious precious place
[1:46:22] there's a special place that he cannot
[1:46:25] put a toenail on because it's where you
[1:46:27] and God had communion that's where you
[1:46:30] and God had Fellowship God met you and
[1:46:33] he you drove his take down God you
[1:46:35] became personal to me and the devil
[1:46:37] can't go there
[1:46:39] you go there you go back to those sacred
[1:46:42] moments you go back to those Precious
[1:46:44] Places and say that's where God met me
[1:46:46] and God will meet you again and again
[1:46:48] and you'll have those moments and every
[1:46:50] one of them every one of those moments
[1:46:52] is Untouchable by Darkness
[1:46:55] amen
[1:47:00] I'm so glad there's a place
[1:47:03] that he can't even go
[1:47:08] think about it
[1:47:10] I think about that little little story
[1:47:11] but around talks about that little eagle
[1:47:14] think about when
[1:47:16] he was all pecking there like a chicken
[1:47:19] he was pecking in the chicken yard here
[1:47:22] he is uh you know here like an eagle
[1:47:24] stands yay tall they're pretty big
[1:47:25] things and he's just like walking with
[1:47:27] his big talents all over the chicken
[1:47:29] yard with these little shrubs of
[1:47:32] chickens all around him and he's he
[1:47:34] hasn't figured out this isn't my place
[1:47:36] she's like all right you know we pack I
[1:47:39] guess this is what we do and that's just
[1:47:41] what he knows he knows the worms is what
[1:47:44] I eat the dirt is where I scratch he's
[1:47:46] got a Talon about the size of my finger
[1:47:48] and he's like all right meanwhile the
[1:47:50] chicken is it's like scratching hard
[1:47:51] he's just like what he must have
[1:47:53] provided a lot of worms for a lot of
[1:47:54] chickens he was the pro Digger but can
[1:47:57] you imagine
[1:47:59] okay that's what he was but can you
[1:48:01] imagine he hears something he heared a
[1:48:04] scream he said wait a second that's I
[1:48:06] haven't heard that before something
[1:48:08] started speaking to him you're sitting
[1:48:10] in a service you're like I've been in
[1:48:11] the service for 10 years but something
[1:48:13] struck something called out to you and
[1:48:16] you said whoa whoa wait a second what's
[1:48:18] that and you look up you look up your
[1:48:20] Redemption is drawing nice hey wait a
[1:48:23] second
[1:48:24] that looks like me
[1:48:26] he's got really big wings like me
[1:48:28] nothing like this little shrub of a
[1:48:30] chicken here with a little drumette come
[1:48:32] out of his bottom come on and he starts
[1:48:34] looking and viewing yeah yup Talons beat
[1:48:37] yup that's me and he started to
[1:48:39] recognize who he is he said I'm an eagle
[1:48:43] that's who I am I've been born to fly so
[1:48:46] here he says forget the chicken yard I'm
[1:48:48] going to go up and he starts to Flap
[1:48:50] Them Wings this service keeps going
[1:48:52] forward you start listening to more
[1:48:53] words and you're like wow and you start
[1:48:55] to Flap them little wings of yours and
[1:48:57] you start to fly I want to ask you the
[1:48:59] question do you think anything
[1:49:02] anything someone could have told that
[1:49:04] eagle actually you're not an eagle
[1:49:07] you're a chicken
[1:49:09] get back to the Head yard
[1:49:11] do you think anything could do that
[1:49:13] never
[1:49:14] never to be an insane Eagle it's not
[1:49:16] even happy music really I'm now soaring
[1:49:18] 10 000 feet in the air and I those those
[1:49:21] chickens are actually my prey they were
[1:49:24] who I was teaching but now they're fat
[1:49:26] and they're blunt but I'm gonna eat them
[1:49:27] you think he's going back never neither
[1:49:31] are you ever going back when God reveals
[1:49:35] who you are never can you go back to the
[1:49:38] pan peck of the world
[1:49:42] never leather band says because
[1:49:44] something is inside you amen
[1:49:51] that's why faith Revelation is so
[1:49:54] important because it's what recognizes
[1:49:56] that God is present and on the scene
[1:50:01] if Cain had a revelation can you imagine
[1:50:03] God spoke to him face to face
[1:50:05] but he had nothing Zippo I can't even
[1:50:08] imagine
[1:50:09] come on Kane just do as your brother God
[1:50:13] speak you to him
[1:50:14] nothing void of any ability to recognize
[1:50:18] that God was there yeah
[1:50:24] it's brother Branham when he was told he
[1:50:26] says he can get the people to believe
[1:50:29] faith
[1:50:31] not even cancer will stand before your
[1:50:34] prayer
[1:50:35] amen
[1:50:41] brother says so
[1:50:43] then you see why Satan is so against the
[1:50:45] Book of Revelation he said anything
[1:50:46] that's revealed spiritual Revelation
[1:50:48] Satan is against it because it's reveal
[1:50:50] the revealing of Christ all right he
[1:50:54] said Let the church go on with his great
[1:50:55] denomination organization little flowery
[1:50:57] messages and so forth let him go on
[1:50:59] Satan won't bother that they don't have
[1:51:01] no troubles everybody pass them on the
[1:51:03] back
[1:51:04] but when there comes a time that God
[1:51:07] through the Holy Ghost revealed Christ
[1:51:10] back to the church with power and
[1:51:12] demonstration and healing and of the
[1:51:14] sick and signs and such he said he would
[1:51:16] follow the Believers come to pass it and
[1:51:18] Satan turns over in his bed and does
[1:51:21] something about it when God starts to
[1:51:24] reveal himself to the Church of who he
[1:51:26] is and God starts to move the power of
[1:51:28] God is on his people that turns the
[1:51:30] devil in his bed wait a second the
[1:51:33] denomination he don't care he's snoring
[1:51:36] logs he's that got nothing to do I don't
[1:51:38] have to worry but when God is revealed
[1:51:40] and he's moving in his people and they
[1:51:42] start recognizing God is on the scene
[1:51:44] Satan is turning over in his bed saying
[1:51:48] oh dear goodness I got to get up these
[1:51:50] people are seeing who they are they're
[1:51:51] actually serving they know that there's
[1:51:53] a living God in the scene that there's a
[1:51:55] message of this hour bringing a bride to
[1:51:57] her position I'm getting out of bed
[1:52:00] I'd say get him out of bed
[1:52:02] get him out of bed don't leave him
[1:52:03] sitting there don't know don't don't
[1:52:05] leave the devil like yeah whatever I
[1:52:06] don't need to worry about them make him
[1:52:08] worry about you
[1:52:11] be a disrupter
[1:52:12] of his sleep
[1:52:15] get him up morning noon and night
[1:52:17] yeah there were those in the scriptures
[1:52:19] that were a disrupter they were
[1:52:21] disruptor of the enemy that was there
[1:52:23] was able can you imagine what a
[1:52:25] disrupture when God revealed to him
[1:52:28] it was blood
[1:52:29] and he put a lamb on the altar that was
[1:52:32] a disrupter can you imagine Satan saying
[1:52:35] are you kidding me he knows exactly what
[1:52:37] it was in the garden he was trying to
[1:52:39] hide it hurricane had no even
[1:52:40] understanding of it but Abel did because
[1:52:43] it was revealed to him that what
[1:52:45] happened in the garden here right at the
[1:52:46] beginning Satan's like no way he knows
[1:52:49] exactly and he's actually doing putting
[1:52:51] a lamb on the altar as a foreshadow of
[1:52:54] what's to come of a land that's coming
[1:52:55] on the cross oh no not already not the
[1:52:59] first person
[1:53:01] yeah
[1:53:03] shamgar
[1:53:05] think of it
[1:53:07] it was revealed to him
[1:53:08] who he was
[1:53:10] he says now wait a second you know the
[1:53:12] story we know shamgar his little Ox code
[1:53:14] and brother Brandon dramatizes that so
[1:53:16] well talks about his little children and
[1:53:18] how they weren't eating and nothing like
[1:53:19] that but something struck him something
[1:53:22] was revealed to him he said wait a
[1:53:23] second
[1:53:24] I am an Israelite I'm in circumcised I
[1:53:27] am part of God's people and I am not
[1:53:30] going to allow this to come against me
[1:53:32] and so it was it struck him and here he
[1:53:34] was in position with faith struck he
[1:53:36] took his Ox gold and he was in his
[1:53:38] moment and what did he do he defeated
[1:53:40] them all
[1:53:46] When Faith strikes you when Revelation
[1:53:49] strikes you
[1:53:50] and you live that moment you're a
[1:53:53] disrupter of the enemy's Kingdom I think
[1:53:55] my goodness time the devil must have
[1:53:57] thought he had it with Samson he just
[1:53:59] had it there he locked him up cut off
[1:54:02] his hair put his eyes out he said yeah
[1:54:06] I beat him got it
[1:54:09] and so there was Samson
[1:54:11] sitting grinding out
[1:54:13] on the grinder down in prison there
[1:54:16] but something started to well up with
[1:54:18] him
[1:54:19] some started to well up in him he
[1:54:21] started to realize wait a second
[1:54:25] I am under a covenant I started to reach
[1:54:28] back during those days and his hair
[1:54:30] started to grow back he says I'm a
[1:54:33] chosen one he started to realize who he
[1:54:35] is and what God brought him for and the
[1:54:38] moment came when he could come out there
[1:54:40] and he stood on those pillars and hear
[1:54:42] the devil thinking that he was going to
[1:54:44] take him down but he recognized he was
[1:54:46] in his moment he knew who he was he said
[1:54:48] God wants more once more and he could
[1:54:51] reach back and take strength from who he
[1:54:54] was and he killed more more in that
[1:54:57] moment than he did all through Past
[1:54:59] Times you can do more in surrender and
[1:55:02] dying to yourself and realizing who you
[1:55:04] are then all the pastimes
[1:55:11] great
[1:55:13] amen
[1:55:15] so revelation
[1:55:18] brings a recognition
[1:55:22] which brings you a moment
[1:55:24] in his presence
[1:55:27] and there's a little woman
[1:55:29] that had a blood issue
[1:55:31] and all them people passing by
[1:55:34] all them people standing you can imagine
[1:55:36] what it was and Jesus was moving through
[1:55:37] the crowds oh my goodness incredible
[1:55:40] times and people were trying to get to
[1:55:42] the front trying to get to there and oh
[1:55:43] there goes the rabbi oh that's that guy
[1:55:46] over there that claims to be a prophet
[1:55:47] oh there's that fanatic over there and
[1:55:49] all such as that he said but but what
[1:55:52] happened he said that little woman had
[1:55:53] an issue of blood and she had heard
[1:55:55] about him she had heard that he had been
[1:55:57] healing the people she'd heard that
[1:55:59] there's there's something different
[1:56:01] about this man no no he's a fanatic I
[1:56:03] knew what he's doing out there so he
[1:56:04] killed him he's a prophet or something
[1:56:05] like that so she's hearing it she's
[1:56:07] hearing all the different things of the
[1:56:09] day she's got all the doubt being cast
[1:56:11] out there Chief Demon's like yeah did
[1:56:13] you hear this did you hear that she
[1:56:15] heard it she heard it but he says but
[1:56:17] what happened the little woman had an
[1:56:19] issue of blood and she had heard about
[1:56:21] him and when she come down there
[1:56:22] regardless of what anybody said he said
[1:56:25] she recognized who he was this is the
[1:56:28] importance of recognizing who he is if
[1:56:31] he can reveal to you and you can receive
[1:56:33] that she said if I could only touch His
[1:56:36] Garment
[1:56:38] but because she was recognizing she was
[1:56:41] ensuring that she wasn't going to miss
[1:56:43] her moment
[1:56:46] she said I knew that is
[1:56:48] that's something different
[1:56:49] that's Jesus Nazareth he he must be
[1:56:52] somebody he's more than a prophet I got
[1:56:54] to get to him and he says and when that
[1:56:56] genuine faith in God became a positive
[1:56:58] thing to her what did it release it
[1:57:00] released his power to heal her
[1:57:04] incredible quote if you can recognize
[1:57:07] he's on the scene if you can recognize
[1:57:09] he's here there's a power that's
[1:57:12] released to her you and I there was a
[1:57:14] power brother Brown said of healing to
[1:57:16] that was released to her she said it can
[1:57:18] if I can just touch him in such a way he
[1:57:21] turned around and told her what was
[1:57:22] wrong with her he said your faith has
[1:57:23] saved saved you what did he said Faith
[1:57:26] others standing there
[1:57:28] might have been sicker than she but you
[1:57:31] see she recognized his presence
[1:57:34] I wonder how many services we go by and
[1:57:38] we don't recognize his presence and then
[1:57:40] someone just strikes it it's just just
[1:57:42] reaches the throne and the Lord just
[1:57:45] blesses them and they receive something
[1:57:46] through the service because they
[1:57:48] recognized his presence in their midst
[1:57:51] and everyone else can be like I don't
[1:57:52] know why why are they so happy why are
[1:57:54] they so calling out on God why are they
[1:57:56] receiving what am I missing they
[1:57:58] recognize something
[1:57:59] they recognized his presence
[1:58:02] God help us that we don't miss God
[1:58:04] moving on the scene as we're here in a
[1:58:07] service we can and we counter you're
[1:58:09] living in your little prayer room and
[1:58:10] his presence come and it's just
[1:58:13] you know
[1:58:14] commonness
[1:58:15] don't miss him tonight
[1:58:17] don't miss him don't miss him tomorrow
[1:58:20] recognize his presence she did and she
[1:58:23] received the healing
[1:58:25] he says understanding by sicker than her
[1:58:28] she recognized his presence she knowed
[1:58:31] that was her opportunity that was her
[1:58:34] moment she says I ain't gonna worry
[1:58:36] about the past I ain't gonna worry about
[1:58:37] the future I've got a moment right here
[1:58:40] right now he's in my midst oh he's a
[1:58:43] long he's still a hundred and something
[1:58:44] feet off and there's a thousands and
[1:58:46] hundreds of people but he's right there
[1:58:48] and he's just right there it's like I
[1:58:50] can almost just feel it I gotta get
[1:58:52] there somehow and so then it takes a
[1:58:54] little effort to press in to a service
[1:58:57] it takes some effort to get into the
[1:58:59] atmosphere and say oh God you have
[1:59:01] something for me there's something for
[1:59:03] me I need something from you he's just
[1:59:05] right there he's just in your midst but
[1:59:07] is he can you recognize it and she did
[1:59:08] whatever it took she tore over the
[1:59:10] people she got underneath the people she
[1:59:12] crawled down on the ground skinning up
[1:59:14] her knees and this and that and the
[1:59:15] other she's like I gotta get there
[1:59:17] whatever it takes because he's here
[1:59:21] he's here
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:25] where there are two or three
[1:59:26] gathering in my name there I am in their
[1:59:29] midst
[1:59:31] now maybe I pray not just two or three
[1:59:33] recognize he's in our midst but that all
[1:59:37] that you might receive and draw
[1:59:40] something from the master tonight
[1:59:44] he says but we've got to recognize his
[1:59:46] presence and now how you recognize his
[1:59:49] presence is when the promised word for
[1:59:51] this age is made manifest
[1:59:54] Glory Glory he said not the promised
[1:59:57] word of Moses age not any other things
[2:00:00] but the promised word of this age
[2:00:02] amen made manifest
[2:00:05] my goodness and God didn't do it under a
[2:00:08] little bushel no God made himself
[2:00:10] manifest in this day in front of the
[2:00:12] world
[2:00:14] then you know he's here
[2:00:17] and he doesn't do it to entertain
[2:00:19] he's not doing this entertainment but
[2:00:20] Abraham talks about it he says not doing
[2:00:22] God doesn't show these things entertain
[2:00:23] he wants you to recognize his presence
[2:00:26] because he wants a relationship with you
[2:00:28] he wants communion not just to show off
[2:00:31] too many people wanted Jesus to show off
[2:00:33] and they got nothing nothing
[2:00:35] but then they were summoning that said I
[2:00:37] I just want to communion with him I need
[2:00:39] to get to his feet I need to worship him
[2:00:41] that person
[2:00:43] that person
[2:00:45] that was different
[2:00:46] how we know about the little lady who
[2:00:48] did just that and she rushed real
[2:00:50] quickly he went with an alabaster box
[2:00:51] and she had to get to Jesus as well she
[2:00:54] recognized somebody was here that needed
[2:00:56] to meet her need she was a wretch she
[2:00:58] was a sinner she had a terrible terrible
[2:01:00] background and terrible life who knows
[2:01:02] what had brought even brought her there
[2:01:03] but he she said he's a prophet as she
[2:01:06] goes she's thinking in her memory I know
[2:01:08] of another person you know the word
[2:01:10] traveled like really quick in those days
[2:01:11] and she heard it of another person that
[2:01:13] was just like her that had a character
[2:01:15] like hers and if God can do that to her
[2:01:18] if God can move on the scene for the
[2:01:19] woman at the well surely he can do it
[2:01:21] for me Rahab recognized something and
[2:01:24] she got what she needed I'm like a Rahab
[2:01:26] I'm like a little Harlot I need
[2:01:28] something from him he's a prophet I need
[2:01:30] to get there but she recognized his
[2:01:32] presence in their midst and so she had
[2:01:34] an opportunity and she recognized him
[2:01:36] and she was forgiven
[2:01:38] Glory up there he says I'll recognize
[2:01:41] he's the son of God I'll do him as
[2:01:43] service I don't care what they do but
[2:01:46] I'll do something what is he asking you
[2:01:48] to do what is God asking you to do she
[2:01:50] got there on his feet she started
[2:01:52] weeping and crying and and all her hair
[2:01:55] all about her and she's starting to wash
[2:01:56] his feet with her tears and just
[2:01:58] worshiping and communing with him and
[2:01:59] here everybody's just looking around
[2:02:01] like what is she doing does he even know
[2:02:03] who she is
[2:02:05] think of the dichotomy here think of the
[2:02:08] disparity between everybody here
[2:02:09] everybody else it's like she's just a
[2:02:12] prostitute here what kind of man is that
[2:02:15] would even let her at her feet but she
[2:02:17] recognized something
[2:02:18] it's the minority that recognizes Jesus
[2:02:21] in our midst
[2:02:25] she sought she recognized his presence
[2:02:27] what did it do it washed what did it
[2:02:30] release to her brother Brown said
[2:02:31] forgiveness
[2:02:34] it released
[2:02:37] forgiveness to one It released healing
[2:02:40] to another it released forgiveness if
[2:02:43] you can recognize he's in your midst
[2:02:46] it's your moment she could have been
[2:02:48] looking there at me like oh I don't know
[2:02:49] I don't know if I can really get in
[2:02:51] there I mean it would it just caused me
[2:02:52] so much shame I mean look what would
[2:02:54] they think of me well you know what do
[2:02:55] they think you already doesn't really
[2:02:56] matter you know what they think about
[2:02:58] you I know but in front of everybody I
[2:03:00] have to like go in there oh but he's
[2:03:02] he's all alone and no one's even
[2:03:03] welcoming him Wally I know but maybe
[2:03:05] just wait for him to leave and then you
[2:03:07] can do it just secretly on the side
[2:03:08] street or something like that no but but
[2:03:10] look at him there and she's warring in
[2:03:11] her mind her opportunity was right there
[2:03:13] think of it doubt it's just coming in
[2:03:15] there no no you don't need it now do it
[2:03:17] some other day maybe tomorrow tomorrow
[2:03:19] Brandon says the devil does he says
[2:03:21] that's Catholicism tomorrow you can you
[2:03:23] can do that tomorrow delaying it another
[2:03:25] day he said she said no no I must do it
[2:03:28] I must do it I must get to his feet and
[2:03:30] she tore through she tore through that
[2:03:33] little room she busted past all them
[2:03:35] Pharisees he said I must get to his feet
[2:03:38] [Applause]
[2:03:41] and because she could do that because
[2:03:45] she pressed through all the doubt all
[2:03:48] the guilt all everything all the shame
[2:03:51] because she could do that for
[2:03:53] forgiveness was released to her
[2:03:57] and here Simon is standing there
[2:04:01] what's that
[2:04:02] unrecognized and look what he got
[2:04:08] terrible
[2:04:09] what a moment pilate stood there too
[2:04:12] yeah there he was
[2:04:14] face to face
[2:04:17] with the King of Kings he said I liked
[2:04:20] it I desire a miracle from him
[2:04:23] this is his what he saw
[2:04:27] Miracle Man in a miracle from him I want
[2:04:29] to see something
[2:04:30] this is all he was seeing but around him
[2:04:32] says right in the presence of God turned
[2:04:33] it down because what
[2:04:36] had he appreciated the opinion of the
[2:04:39] public more than he appreciated having
[2:04:41] the opportunity to be in the presence of
[2:04:43] God
[2:04:45] opinion of the public
[2:04:48] what are my friends going to say about
[2:04:51] ah if I really stand fervently for God
[2:04:53] in my school ah but you know I don't
[2:04:56] mock me I don't know I'm kind of like
[2:04:58] the top guy in my in my class you know I
[2:05:00] really don't want to have you know any
[2:05:02] of that shame
[2:05:03] it says pilot
[2:05:05] that's where Pilot was I don't know the
[2:05:08] public will and have a great opinion of
[2:05:10] me and he appreciated that more his
[2:05:12] popularity with the people and his
[2:05:14] position in Rome and then he appreciated
[2:05:17] having the opportunity to be in the
[2:05:20] presence of God
[2:05:23] bye
[2:05:26] mother Brown says what happened the
[2:05:28] woman was forgiven
[2:05:30] and given eternal life
[2:05:31] and pilate lost his mind and went insane
[2:05:34] and committed suicide drowning himself
[2:05:36] in Switzerland brother Brown says that
[2:05:40] God help us
[2:05:42] not to put something in the way
[2:05:45] of your moment
[2:05:52] maybe one more
[2:05:54] Little Martha
[2:05:57] you know Martha she gets a bad rap
[2:06:00] sometimes well you know Mary
[2:06:02] I want to be Mary
[2:06:04] yes Mary had her moment
[2:06:06] I defeated Jesus so you do want to be
[2:06:09] like Mary
[2:06:10] and not miss that opportunity
[2:06:12] you know when Martha
[2:06:14] but then something something must have
[2:06:15] changed
[2:06:16] I love Martha
[2:06:18] because Martha didn't run out because
[2:06:20] now her brother had died
[2:06:23] her whole world had changed
[2:06:26] the she was a breadwinner I'm sure for
[2:06:28] their family her sister and herself and
[2:06:32] her world got turned upside down
[2:06:34] and so here they've been calling no
[2:06:36] Jesus would you come you know if the
[2:06:38] friend your dear friend is is sick and
[2:06:40] needs you to come and he doesn't come
[2:06:43] and he delays here they are now days
[2:06:46] have gone a few days have gone by
[2:06:48] and now Lazarus has died
[2:06:51] and you can imagine just the whole
[2:06:52] thoughts that were going there and oh my
[2:06:54] you don't think the devil took every
[2:06:56] opportunity he could to just pound her
[2:06:58] with every bit of Doubt really he said
[2:07:01] he's your friend and he didn't even come
[2:07:03] out here to heal to heal you've seen how
[2:07:06] many other healings and how many other
[2:07:07] Miracles and he couldn't even come and
[2:07:08] save your friend your brother come on
[2:07:10] really you serve that kind of God
[2:07:15] but here
[2:07:17] Martha then Runs Out
[2:07:19] Jesus now is on the scene
[2:07:21] and she runs out to find Jesus and she
[2:07:23] said Lord
[2:07:24] Brown says watch that Sixth Sense watch
[2:07:27] this Faith now in action he says Lord if
[2:07:31] thou would have been here my brother
[2:07:33] would not have died
[2:07:36] but it doesn't end there she she said oh
[2:07:39] it's it's over all is done if you
[2:07:42] weren't here if you had been here he
[2:07:43] wouldn't have died and period that's not
[2:07:46] where it ends
[2:07:48] but she says even now even this moment
[2:07:52] because she recognized somebody was on
[2:07:56] the scene the king of glory was there
[2:07:58] Lord this could have happened he's dead
[2:08:01] already I know this he was sick you
[2:08:03] didn't come I just I take you at your
[2:08:05] will whatever you desire but even now
[2:08:07] even now you can deal with it even now
[2:08:11] you can raise him up
[2:08:13] why because you recognize who is in our
[2:08:16] midst she says whatever you ask of God
[2:08:18] God will give it to you he said that's
[2:08:20] the Sixth Sense she recognized somebody
[2:08:22] was there and I'm not gonna pass up my
[2:08:25] opportunity he's right here she ran to
[2:08:27] meet him she said oh I gotta get to him
[2:08:30] even now oh God even now I have an issue
[2:08:33] even now I have a body a problem in my
[2:08:36] body I need healing my son needs
[2:08:38] Deliverance I've had circumstances but
[2:08:40] even now you're here in our midst even
[2:08:43] now you can deal with it
[2:08:45] yeah
[2:08:47] Jesus pulled himself together he says I
[2:08:50] am the resurrection in the life he that
[2:08:52] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[2:08:54] shall he live oh he says whosoever
[2:08:56] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[2:08:58] die here she's hearing this now from
[2:09:00] Jesus and you can imagine the reasoning
[2:09:02] is going on but Abraham says what are
[2:09:03] you going to say reasoning there's a man
[2:09:05] laying down there dead and worms
[2:09:07] crawling through him never die the
[2:09:09] resurrection and doubt is still working
[2:09:10] his action he's still he's still hitting
[2:09:13] hard and she's trying to get him and he
[2:09:15] says oh but he's just got through saying
[2:09:17] he was a resurrection into life that's
[2:09:19] God's word that's the Sixth Sense he
[2:09:21] said it's beyond Doctor's Care well it's
[2:09:23] beyond Hope they've got cancer Beyond
[2:09:25] it's ravaging through their body he was
[2:09:28] dead in the Tomb gone into these far
[2:09:32] past four stage cancer he oh he said his
[2:09:34] Beyond thoughts of scientific research
[2:09:36] defy all reasonings cast them down why
[2:09:40] it's witnessing to God's word he said I
[2:09:43] am not I will be but I am the
[2:09:46] resurrection and the life and whosoever
[2:09:49] believeth in me he said that's the Sixth
[2:09:51] Sense he says oh he said oh thy brother
[2:09:53] shall rise again
[2:09:57] brother Brown says to the Grave they
[2:09:58] went two of them he said something had
[2:10:01] to happen
[2:10:02] oh my can you imagine if Jesus said I
[2:10:06] just couldn't imagine when Martha cried
[2:10:07] out but even now
[2:10:09] oh it's one of my favorite lines of
[2:10:11] Martha she just cried out even now I
[2:10:14] don't care about the circumstances of
[2:10:15] the past right now you're here right now
[2:10:19] I need you
[2:10:20] amen
[2:10:23] and she knowed if she could only get to
[2:10:25] him she could get only close to him and
[2:10:27] present the case just to hear one
[2:10:29] promise from him that's all she wanted
[2:10:31] and when he said I'm the resurrection
[2:10:33] and the life and he that believeth on me
[2:10:35] though are dead that's all Martha wanted
[2:10:37] to hear that's all she wanted to hear
[2:10:39] all she wanted because Sixth Sense Faith
[2:10:42] was moving her to confess and believe
[2:10:45] him
[2:10:46] and you know what Drew for her yeah yeah
[2:10:48] you know what her faith Drew for her
[2:10:52] Resurrection
[2:10:55] somewhat healing they came and they
[2:10:58] recognized the opportunity and said I
[2:10:59] have a need I got healed I need healing
[2:11:01] and God gave it to them there was one
[2:11:03] who needed forgiveness a wretched sinner
[2:11:05] far from Jesus and she came and bowed
[2:11:07] down his feet and said oh God I worship
[2:11:09] you and he did empowered you from him
[2:11:12] and forgave her but there's one like a
[2:11:15] Marta who said oh I believe you're the
[2:11:18] resurrection and the life and she
[2:11:19] recognized the presence of God and it
[2:11:21] drew down Resurrection
[2:11:25] Hallelujah
[2:11:30] what a position she was in what a moment
[2:11:33] yeah I wonder
[2:11:35] tonight
[2:11:36] what power do you need released
[2:11:41] [Applause]
[2:11:42] they received it in Scripture because
[2:11:44] they recognized
[2:11:46] he's here oh how many times brother
[2:11:49] Brown say he's here
[2:11:52] and how many missed it and how many was
[2:11:56] released to them what they needed
[2:12:00] you've got to put it into your world now
[2:12:02] you he's not a God he Hebrews 13 8.
[2:12:07] means yesterday today and forever
[2:12:14] bam says when he's not recognized
[2:12:17] his power is always not revealed when
[2:12:20] he's not recognized
[2:12:22] and so then the opposite must apply
[2:12:25] when he is recognized
[2:12:27] his power is revealed
[2:12:32] I said Lord are we recognizing Our
[2:12:34] Moment
[2:12:36] today
[2:12:38] are we going to go through this next set
[2:12:39] of meetings
[2:12:40] and just kind of let it
[2:12:42] go buy us
[2:12:44] and not take God starts walking down the
[2:12:47] aisle here and he starts pricking a
[2:12:49] heart starts pricking a heart it's a
[2:12:51] still small voice
[2:12:53] he doesn't come out with big shoutings
[2:12:55] and Lightnings and thunderings it's that
[2:12:57] still Small Voice and so and that's why
[2:12:59] that doubt is out there so much and just
[2:13:02] throwing every reason he can because
[2:13:03] he's trying to drown it out everything
[2:13:05] he can but God is moving you just get
[2:13:07] quiet enough God is moving he said Lord
[2:13:10] I really need you in this area of my
[2:13:13] life
[2:13:20] as we close
[2:13:23] you don't always think
[2:13:26] we can look back
[2:13:28] in the scriptures
[2:13:31] and we can think of that I always think
[2:13:32] how the disciples were
[2:13:34] so often Jesus was saying something to
[2:13:36] them he'd tell him he even told him
[2:13:38] about how he would die
[2:13:40] three days he'd be raised out he talked
[2:13:42] about this to them
[2:13:43] but then when it happened it totally
[2:13:45] missed it
[2:13:46] it totally missed that Jesus had talked
[2:13:49] to them about it
[2:13:52] and in the moment they totally missed
[2:13:54] what was actually happening even though
[2:13:55] they'd been told this is going to happen
[2:13:57] and then they're in the moment they're
[2:13:58] even forewarned and then it happened and
[2:14:01] totally went over their heads they
[2:14:03] thought well Elias was supposed to come
[2:14:05] yeah he did come that was John the
[2:14:07] Baptist oh
[2:14:08] these are the disciples
[2:14:12] and I wonder
[2:14:13] I wonder
[2:14:15] here we are in this age when the word
[2:14:18] has been revealed
[2:14:20] and the messages come to unveil Christ
[2:14:22] This is the End Time age with an end
[2:14:25] time message
[2:14:27] we cannot be like the disciples
[2:14:30] there's no extra time
[2:14:35] there's no extra time that they could be
[2:14:37] after didn't I tell you onto a mass as
[2:14:40] Jesus was telling him all the scriptures
[2:14:42] and it was now post oh oh and then their
[2:14:46] eyes were opening oh he told us about
[2:14:48] these things now we remember but it
[2:14:50] already passed
[2:14:51] God gave us an end-time message to
[2:14:54] reveal everything to show us the full
[2:14:57] opening of the word there is no oh oh
[2:15:00] that's what he meant because after
[2:15:01] Rapture there's no other opportunity
[2:15:04] don't miss the moment we're in now
[2:15:09] there's no extra time there's no
[2:15:12] overtime Rapture comes like oh it's tied
[2:15:14] and we've got to go in overtime I gotta
[2:15:16] chat no there's no chance God gave a
[2:15:18] message for the now he gave it for this
[2:15:20] moment today tonight so that you could
[2:15:23] recognize I have come in this hour to
[2:15:26] reveal who I am to pull a bride out of
[2:15:28] this hate don't miss the moment
[2:15:32] oh yeah
[2:15:35] Lord help us recognize
[2:15:38] Where We Are
[2:15:41] I know scripture brother Brown talks
[2:15:43] about when she recognizes who she is and
[2:15:45] he talks about releasing a power but our
[2:15:47] brand it's for me this is the bride's
[2:15:52] moment
[2:15:53] this is where we're at
[2:15:55] we can't miss it
[2:15:56] this is her moment this is what it's all
[2:15:59] come to is this time we can recognize
[2:16:01] the Son of God son of man being revealed
[2:16:04] in this day it's our moment to catch it
[2:16:06] amen he said if recognition can release
[2:16:09] healing if recognition can release
[2:16:11] Deliverance if recognition can release
[2:16:14] natural Resurrection the same
[2:16:18] recognition that God is on the scene
[2:16:21] here revealing a message to you
[2:16:23] recognizing this day and its message
[2:16:26] will release to a bride Resurrection in
[2:16:30] a rapture
[2:16:32] not recognizing there's no Resurrection
[2:16:40] it's a special power
[2:16:42] that's released to this bride
[2:16:45] but Abraham says but to the church the
[2:16:47] bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[2:16:48] where it's revealed to her that
[2:16:50] Revelation the true bride of Christ will
[2:16:52] be waiting for that revelation of the
[2:16:55] rapture
[2:16:56] what a moment yeah you know when you're
[2:16:59] expecting something
[2:17:01] and you're right on the edge you're just
[2:17:03] waiting for it to happen you know the
[2:17:05] moment has come for such and such to
[2:17:07] happen you are acutely aware of
[2:17:10] everything you're just looking what is
[2:17:13] is this what is this going to happen
[2:17:14] you're just waiting for it you don't
[2:17:16] know maybe exactly when but you're just
[2:17:18] waiting there's a moment the moment's
[2:17:20] coming here it is and you're just
[2:17:21] acutely in tune with what's happening
[2:17:24] that's where the bride is that's where
[2:17:26] his people are we're just we should be
[2:17:28] waiting just really acutely aware the
[2:17:30] signs of the times the messenger has
[2:17:32] come Malachi 4 has been revealed the
[2:17:34] word of God has been unveiled and you're
[2:17:36] just in tune because the moment is here
[2:17:42] isn't that where the wise virgin were
[2:17:45] right we had the wise and the foolish
[2:17:46] virgin and they're the foolish virgin
[2:17:47] they didn't have no oil in their lamp as
[2:17:49] we close
[2:17:51] and they you know they trimmed their
[2:17:53] lamps and these poor foolish version
[2:17:55] they recognize that you know what I
[2:17:57] gotta go find some some oil
[2:18:00] they weren't ready
[2:18:02] they weren't ready
[2:18:04] the shout went forth the bridegroom
[2:18:06] cometh
[2:18:07] and here's oh my goodness I don't have
[2:18:09] oil and so they clearly they missed the
[2:18:13] moment
[2:18:14] but there is a people yeah
[2:18:16] there's a people that are ready
[2:18:19] they have been waiting the call went out
[2:18:22] and they have oil in their lamp and
[2:18:25] they're saying all right and she's in
[2:18:27] her position now for something to happen
[2:18:29] the bride was coming and she's made
[2:18:31] she's trimmed her lamb nice and clean
[2:18:33] and everything's looking looking perfect
[2:18:35] she's got oil in her life she's living a
[2:18:37] holy life she's walking in step with the
[2:18:39] word whatever the word is saying she's
[2:18:41] doing and she says waiting there the
[2:18:43] broad groom cometh the bride room comes
[2:18:45] and so she's just waiting there the
[2:18:46] moment of Crossing is just about here
[2:18:49] here we are the fullness we have the
[2:18:53] fullness of all healing brother Brahm
[2:18:54] says that he Divine Healing is the
[2:18:56] earnest of our resurrection and the
[2:18:58] fullness of Deliverance now the fullness
[2:19:00] of Peace it's right here right at the
[2:19:02] tip of time and we're recognizing the
[2:19:04] bride recognizing this is the moment
[2:19:06] this is what it's all come to I'm here
[2:19:08] I'm ready I am aware the shout has gone
[2:19:11] forth and then there's going to come a
[2:19:13] time when the scripture says actually it
[2:19:15] says and then they went to buy the
[2:19:17] foolish version the bridegroom came and
[2:19:20] I put there the door opened because if
[2:19:23] you go open then they were ready that
[2:19:25] went in with him and the door was shut
[2:19:26] so when the bridegroom come the door
[2:19:28] opened okay that's kind of just if we it
[2:19:30] had to open for it to shut all right and
[2:19:33] I just thought my here we are at this
[2:19:35] time where we've recognized who we are
[2:19:38] we know exactly we're in position we're
[2:19:40] waiting for the moment and it's like at
[2:19:42] the wedding when the bride is standing
[2:19:44] there and she's ready and waiting she's
[2:19:47] adorned herself she's all ready and she
[2:19:49] stands at our church she stands at the
[2:19:51] door the door is shut you know nobody
[2:19:53] can see her quite yet everything's been
[2:19:55] away in the moment as

[2:20:01] perfect she's adorned herself and she's
[2:20:03] she's there everything is is perfectly
[2:20:05] in order and now
[2:20:08] the door opens
[2:20:10] and the bride
[2:20:12] walks forth this is her moment
[2:20:15] everything has been built up to this
[2:20:18] time can you imagine if she's there and

[2:20:49] called but the door is about to be there
[2:20:51] where the bride is in her moment it's
[2:20:54] her time to cross over from time into

[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:14] I I certainly wish I was more musically
[2:29:17] inclined
[2:29:19] but God didn't give me that
[2:29:22] but I'll tell you one thing I do have is
[2:29:25] I enjoy the word of God
[2:29:28] and you know something really struck my
[2:29:31] heart
[2:29:32] as our brother was preaching about a
[2:29:34] moment you know God gives us these
[2:29:39] moments all through life
[2:29:41] and if you're not ready
[2:29:44] and I don't know who is here Wednesday
[2:29:46] evening
[2:29:47] but I don't I think this I never seen a
[2:29:50] glove
[2:29:51] come together like this
[2:29:54] you know expecting looking for a moment
[2:29:59] and and God's got a moment for you
[2:30:02] he knows what you have need of and he
[2:30:04] has the moment and we here don't don't
[2:30:08] miss a moment but you ever think and and
[2:30:11] for you that you're if you have
[2:30:13] something
[2:30:14] in your life that's hindering you ask
[2:30:18] God for a moment
[2:30:20] and then when he comes recognize it let
[2:30:23] John do it recognize the doubt I love
[2:30:26] that about the boy coming up didn't you
[2:30:29] and he said yeah can you wreck it do you
[2:30:32] believe that that doubts the devil
[2:30:35] and the minute he recognized Satan for
[2:30:38] what he was and then he could recognize
[2:30:41] him for what he was then he knew that
[2:30:45] greater he is in you than he who is in
[2:30:49] the world and he was able to get this
[2:30:51] but why do you think that God in your
[2:30:55] life
[2:30:56] has laid out all the plans
[2:30:59] for you to have moments yeah do you know
[2:31:02] it's scriptural let me read a scripture
[2:31:05] to you
[2:31:06] behold I show you a mystery
[2:31:10] we shall not all sleep
[2:31:12] but we shall be changed
[2:31:15] for in a moment
[2:31:22] in a
[2:31:24] moment
[2:31:25] how important is the recognition of a
[2:31:30] moment
[2:31:33] foreign
[2:31:35] just think of it
[2:31:37] I mean this isn't just a nice sermon
[2:31:40] right right by a guy that really knows
[2:31:43] how to preach
[2:31:47] you know what I mean
[2:31:49] with the lovely Spirit you just gotta
[2:31:52] love the guy
[2:31:53] even if you don't want it
[2:32:00] but it's more than that
[2:32:03] you see how easy it is
[2:32:06] to miss the moment of him telling us
[2:32:09] about a moment
[2:32:12] that's coming
[2:32:14] because
[2:32:16] I'm showing you a mystery
[2:32:19] it's going to be in the moment
[2:32:23] how quick of a moment
[2:32:25] in the twinkling of an eye
[2:32:28] the last Trump
[2:32:30] for the Trump shall sound
[2:32:33] and the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:32:35] Incorruptible and we shall
[2:32:39] be changed
[2:32:43] you know God always prepares his people
[2:32:48] he always provides for them
[2:32:51] what they have needed
[2:32:54] and now here comes the voice of God
[2:32:57] out to us through the word of God saying
[2:33:02] church it's done in moments yes
[2:33:05] it's done in moments
[2:33:08] you've got to be prepared to receive the
[2:33:11] moment
[2:33:12] will he give you all little
[2:33:14] opportunities a moment you want a
[2:33:16] Deliverance in your life he will bring
[2:33:19] you a moment
[2:33:22] that you can grab a hold of
[2:33:27] you you have anxiety attacks
[2:33:29] ask for a moment
[2:33:32] in expectation brother Branham said do
[2:33:35] you need healing
[2:33:37] expect healing he'll give you heals you
[2:33:41] need salvation expect salvation he'll
[2:33:44] give you salvation you need Deliverance
[2:33:48] I need Deliverance I need a moment
[2:33:52] I'm looking for the moment
[2:33:56] that he comes to deliver me
[2:34:02] that's faith
[2:34:04] it's you can't look back
[2:34:07] you can't look forward
[2:34:09] because Deliverance comes now
[2:34:13] so as we go forward just think of this
[2:34:16] what he's doing because he's telling us
[2:34:20] the rapture we call it rapture
[2:34:23] the catching away
[2:34:24] the changing
[2:34:26] he says it so beautifully I'm showing
[2:34:29] you a mystery
[2:34:31] I'm showing you a mystery I'm telling
[2:34:33] you something I'm opening something up
[2:34:36] to you I'm giving you a revelation look
[2:34:39] at how the sermon unfolded first it
[2:34:42] started out Revelation Revelation the
[2:34:46] greatest thing is revelation and now we
[2:34:50] realize that he says yeah I I show you a
[2:34:54] mystery we shall not all sleep
[2:34:58] but we shall be
[2:35:00] changed in
[2:35:03] a
[2:35:05] moment
[2:35:06] don't you think it would be a good idea
[2:35:09] if we practiced
[2:35:12] catching the moment
[2:35:17] if you look at your own life
[2:35:20] individually
[2:35:22] and ask yourself am I catching the
[2:35:25] moment because I need to be able to
[2:35:28] catch the moment
[2:35:30] because it's going to be
[2:35:32] in a moment
[2:35:34] I think it was more profound tonight
[2:35:38] than maybe we were able to grab a hold
[2:35:40] of
[2:35:42] it's maybe a little more
[2:35:45] serious
[2:35:47] because God's very gentle he's very kind
[2:35:51] he's very sweet
[2:35:54] he speaks his word in such a a lovely
[2:35:57] way but in another way he's crying out
[2:36:00] to us and letting us know Church
[2:36:04] get ready
[2:36:06] because it's just going to be
[2:36:10] in a moment
[2:36:12] now
[2:36:13] maybe you need a moment this weekend
[2:36:18] so I'll I'll accept that and you we
[2:36:22] could have a Revival right now
[2:36:25] you know I mean Tom would never have to
[2:36:27] preach Mike wouldn't have to preach
[2:36:28] again
[2:36:34] but I want that moment too
[2:36:37] but let's start looking for Our Moment
[2:36:39] amen
[2:36:42] you got bitterness Lord give me a moment
[2:36:48] I need a moment
[2:36:50] just give me a moment
[2:36:54] I've said that a lot of times give me a
[2:36:57] moment to get ready
[2:36:58] just give me a moment before I speak
[2:37:03] just give me a moment
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:07] if you're tormented by something
[2:37:09] [Music]
[2:37:11] if you have a failure
[2:37:14] in your life that just keeps coming up
[2:37:18] and you do everything you can
[2:37:22] he sees that
[2:37:25] he sees your effort he sees your trying
[2:37:28] he sees the The Cry of your heart
[2:37:33] he sees the weakness of your flesh
[2:37:36] he was tempted every way that you're
[2:37:38] tempted
[2:37:39] [Music]
[2:37:42] gotta ask for the moment
[2:37:44] [Music]
[2:37:47] you've got to say Lord I need the moment
[2:37:50] [Music]
[2:37:52] you got to expect the moment you got to
[2:37:54] believe that he will give you
[2:37:56] that opportunity
[2:37:58] to walk away from that sickness
[2:38:02] to walk away from this sin that so
[2:38:05] easily besets you he will provide that
[2:38:08] to you he's Jehovah Jireh he will
[2:38:12] provide you the moment
[2:38:15] [Music]
[2:38:18] do you want the moment
[2:38:22] it may be tomorrow morning it may be
[2:38:24] tomorrow night it may be tonight
[2:38:29] but I want a moment
[2:38:33] do I say just a moment
[2:38:36] will I get my moment
[2:38:39] because the Rapture itself
[2:38:43] the same moment that gave you
[2:38:45] deliverance we heard the Lord say
[2:38:47] tonight
[2:38:48] is the same moment that gives you
[2:38:50] Resurrection
[2:38:53] the same moment that gives you healing
[2:38:55] is the same moment
[2:38:58] the only thing that's stopping you
[2:39:01] [Music]
[2:39:04] is that lying voice
[2:39:09] I want you to tell the devil that he is
[2:39:12] how many knows the definition of the
[2:39:14] devil
[2:39:16] he's the father
[2:39:18] of all lies
[2:39:21] and there's no truth in him
[2:39:27] our messenger told us he said that God
[2:39:29] cast his vote for you
[2:39:33] Satan cast his vote
[2:39:35] [Music]
[2:39:37] against you
[2:39:38] now is who you cast your vote with
[2:39:44] so when you hear that
[2:39:47] voice
[2:39:49] that voice that discourages you
[2:39:52] that voice that reminds you of how many
[2:39:56] times you failed
[2:40:00] are you going to accept that moment
[2:40:04] are you going to accept the moment says
[2:40:06] come unto me all ye that are heavy laden
[2:40:09] and I'll give you rest
[2:40:14] cast your cares upon me
[2:40:17] for I care for you cast your cares upon
[2:40:20] Him
[2:40:21] because he careth you what moment
[2:40:23] are you gonna take tonight because
[2:40:27] you've got to realize
[2:40:30] that was more than Michael speaking to
[2:40:34] us tonight that was Elohim
[2:40:37] veiled in flesh
[2:40:40] revealing to us
[2:40:43] a mystery
[2:40:45] I show you a mystery
[2:40:48] we're all knocking asleep in sin
[2:40:53] but we're going to be changed
[2:40:56] you realize you're going to be changed
[2:40:58] before you're going to be changed
[2:41:03] oh
[2:41:04] you got to be changed
[2:41:08] change me
[2:41:10] Hallelujah give me a moment
[2:41:13] change me
[2:41:15] I'm here
[2:41:16] [Music]
[2:41:17] I'm sitting right here right now
[2:41:20] In This Moment
[2:41:22] there's so many things I don't like
[2:41:25] about myself
[2:41:28] but you promised me
[2:41:30] that I could be different
[2:41:33] I promise your spirit
[2:41:36] would come by
[2:41:40] and make me different
[2:41:41] [Music]
[2:41:44] if I miss this change
[2:41:48] if I can miss the change from coming
[2:41:52] from lust to freedom from it
[2:41:57] if I could miss the moment of coming
[2:42:00] from Fear to comfort how am I Ever Gonna
[2:42:05] Catch the moment of the rapture
[2:42:11] let's prepare our hearts
[2:42:15] let's realize that you've got to decide
[2:42:19] that you want a moment
[2:42:22] [Music]
[2:42:23] you got to understand
[2:42:27] that he wants to give you that moment
[2:42:31] behold I stand at the door and knock

[2:43:10] God keeps all his appointments
[2:43:14] do you believe he has a moment for you
[2:43:17] that's the first question I was do you
[2:43:19] believe
[2:43:20] that he's got a moment for you
[2:43:24] do you believe he's got a moment for
[2:43:26] someone that's on your heart you believe
[2:43:29] that he's got a moment for a loved one
[2:43:31] you believe he's got a moment for you to
[2:43:34] receive his Spirit to be free
[2:43:37] would you start looking for that moment
[2:43:40] would you start believing for that
[2:43:42] moment would you just start tonight quit
[2:43:45] listening to that slime bag

[2:44:01] your moments now
[2:44:03] touched a Hem of His Garment
[2:44:08] if it's not now be an expectation
[2:44:12] because he's going to come by
[2:44:15] in a rush of a wind
[2:44:18] in a little still small voice
[2:44:21] in a little quickening power and he'll
[2:44:24] touch you in just an instant
[2:44:28] latch onto it yes
