bad and i couldn't stand up straight all that well and uh i just prayed that night you know and and believed that i would be healed in the morning and i got up the next morning and i was just stiff it really it wasn't bad at all and as the week went on it just it just went away and i really i really i thought it was going to be pretty bad but i guess the lord just uh he looks out for us and i just

presence [Music] [Music] [Applause] is amen hallelujah as they just continue to to play that we just want to go before the lord i can testify there's nothing like his presence amen and sometimes there's deeper depths of his presence and i'll say this if you've never had his presence come down on when you're all alone maybe at your bedside or you're in your prayer closet or even in your car why don't you just start to have a longing for that when it's just you you and him alone and his presence come down my it'll do something for you let's just go before the lord jesus heavenly father truly as the author penned this song and said there's nothing like your presence lord we know that in your presence lord there's fullness of joy there's fullness of life there's deliverance there's healings there's answered questions there's peace lord and we're thankful that we have a divine promise that says where two or three are gathered that you would be in our midst and lord even more than that you said that you'd be with us that you'd be even in us until the end of the world lord and you said greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world lord you told us that the kingdom of heaven doesn't come with observation but the kingdom of heaven is within us lord lord grant us a greater revelation of these things lord we thank you for your word we thank you for this gathering we thank you for your presence lord we thank you for the blood of jesus christ that cleanses us from all of our sins that we can come here and worship you in spirit and in truth lord we just commit ourselves to you now lord as humbly as we know how just asking that you'd come and break the bread of life lord as only you can now we pray we ask these things in your name the lord jesus christ amen and praise the lord if you have your bibles let's just turn in isaiah 29 and we'll read verse 11 here maybe just to help us to have a place to to start from isaiah 29 11. it says in the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that has learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed amen we just ask the lord to bless the reading of his word he may be seated and i just trust that the lord could will help this little thought that we have on our heart just be able to speak to you in a way that will illuminate the word and draw you closer to him and into higher heights you know as we think of the words right here that are written here in isaiah saying that and the vision of all has become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that has learned saying read this i pray thee and saith i cannot afford a sealed you know certainly in our hearts when we read this it makes us start to think of the seven seals and the book of redemption that was sealed and that no man could look there upon maybe we even start to think of john there in revelations 5 looking and saying no no man is worthy to look there on or to read the things that are in the book but by god's grace we we we know the rest of the story the lion of the tribe of judah he prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof so this book of redemption that was sealed that no one could look at uh it was sealed up until the end time but there was a divine promise that at the end time that the book would be loosed and the seven seals would be revealed and so now a book of redemption which is the bible that had been sealed down through the ages now comes a time where it is unsealed and the very mysteries and the very things that are in the book or the very vision because if you look at what it says it says the vision was put into a book and so we know before the foundation of the world and we start talking about the logos we get back into the very mind of god and the very thoughts of god and it wasn't until that god and those thoughts were spoken and he spoke the word and then that word that was spoken it's been written into the scriptures by the prophets who the word of the lord came to but before that word was even ever written into the book there was a vision or a thought or or something that god had had in his mind that he was going to reveal in the end time and we just kind of want to speak to you a little along the lines of the vision of the bride and if we just move into the book of habakkuk chapter 2 if you'll read with me as maybe they would put it on the screen it says and the lord answered habakkuk 2 2 answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it now just it just makes me even think to the scripture that we just read there's only one way that you could read it is if it's revealed to you it says the learned had looked at it they had no way to comprehend or understand it so there has to be something transpire to give the ability to the one that readeth it that he may run it says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and it not lie though at terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry and i just want to pull from a quote here out of god does doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him just to tie this scripture in with what the prophet said he says now when he speaks of a vision now just remember we're we're speaking about uh the bride's vision so we want to maybe understand what a vision is or how it works or what it means to us it says when he speaks of his vision whether it's wrath or whether it's healing it may linger but it's got to come to pass if he speaks it in the name of the lord see it might be a blessing that he speaks for you he might be he might tell you certain thing and you can't see it all you you say how can it be well he told me thus saith the lord this is going to happen and that was going to happen and it ain't happened that man's wrong now you'll be judged for disbelieving it but it's going to happen anyhow see it's got to happen though it linger though it linger my i wonder if there's something that you're believing for i wonder if there's things that you've looked into the word and something in your heart has cried out for an attribute of god to be manifested in you and you've prayed for and you've asked for it and you've called before the doors of heaven if you will and you've asked over and over and over now i believe god in his word there's something in your heart of faith that has latched onto a promise because that's what really even causes us to ask god for it because there's something in the in the word or something in a believer that knows that we can go to our heavenly father and ask him for something if we ask him for bread he's not going to give us a stone if we ask him for things that we can find in the word we believe in our heart knowing that he said if you ask of me if you ask anything in my name you shall have it now if it's lingering is it is it in the lingering that we start to doubt is it in the lingering that we get confused is it in the lingering of the manifestation of the promise where we start to get discouraged and we start to let down and we start to allow doubt to come into our mind where we start to disbelieve or start to allow doubt to to to start to interfere with our our heart and our mind and we get begin to start questioning did he really mean what he said well i want to tell you yes he meant what he said so that very promise that you're believing in that very sound that you're hanging on for that very healing and that very manifestation in your body although it may linger i want to tell you he said by his stripes you are healed though it linger i want to encourage you don't get discouraged don't doubt you stand on the word of promise you keep believing it you keep spinning it because though it lingered the bible said yet will it speak in its season my it will come to pass and just when it comes to past the joy bells will start to roll oh let that word become a positive confession go on and speak it and put it in your mouth why don't you go ahead and just start to testify why didn't you go to receive it like faith receives something it receives those things that are not and cause them as though they are oh you might feel weak and feeble you might feel cashed down and down trodden but let me be a john ryan let me look into the wire there was a vision that was given unto john ryan and said you were healed well what happened a little doubt started to creep in and he came back he told the prophet i thought you said i was healed and what does the prophet say back to him he said i thought you believed okay i'm learning now i'm learning so and linger i believe but throw it linger now i'm gonna start to put my the my faith where my mouth is i'm about to go start speaking the word of god and say extra extra all about it by his stripes i'm healed what are you talking about brother what are you talking about sister you look just as sick as you ever a matter of fact it looks like you're even getting sicker i don't care what the doctor says i don't care what you're looking at i'm looking at a divine promise of almighty god that said i am healed and though the manifestation of it might linger oh in its season it's going to come to pass and it'll speak for itself though it would linger yet will it speak in its season it'll come to pass the prophet's only looking off and seeing something he's talking about what he's looking at he ain't thinking about here and what you look like now he's looking what you're going to be and when he speaks that if it's in the word of the lord it's already bespoke and there's nothing in the world that can stop it oh my i just want to start looking into the scripture right now and looking at all the promises that are laying in the word and when this seventh sealed mystery book of redemption was loosed and the seven seals were revealed and my name was called because my name was on that title d my name was in there i heard my name i want to be present for the reading of the will i want to know all that has been given to me i want to know all that is mine and it's in the the hearing of that word it's in the vision being made known unto us and when we start to hear these things we start to believe it we start to receive it we start to act on it and if we can look in there and call those things as other not say you know what though it might not look like it now but just like the prophet said he ain't thinking about hearing what you look like now you're not worried about your condition now he's looking at something that you're going to be and so i know there's been a word that has been spoken of us there has been a prophetic word in a vision concerning the bride and the image of christ that you are coming into and you might not see all of the attributes of god and the very things that he's spoken of you in yourself now but if the word has been spoken if the word or that vision has already been seen that was in his mind before the foundation of the world then it's going to come to pass and nothing can stop it i just was rejoicing in the words that we heard this sunday and our pastor speaking about the carriers of the promise praise praise god that we can look into the word and we're called to believe it it's not up to us in our own ability as a man or as a human to bring the promised word to past but we are called to believe it we're called to believe every single word what you know well people want to know if they they have the holy ghost and and the devil's able to get people uh uh cornered into a place where where they just don't even know who they are and we think of the word test look uh do you believe what he said why don't you give yourself the word test do you believe what the word says look you're called to believe the word and that's what abraham did and it was accounted unto him for righteousness he believed god's word and he he considered him faithful to fulfill the promise that he had gave him and he just went forth believing with no ability to fulfill the promise in himself you could imagine maybe the conversation he'd be having with sarah and them feeling so insignificant and maybe in their minds filling the brink of insanity and a man with a testimony getting older in age saying i'm going to be the father of nations imagine the rebuke imagine the reproach amongst his neighbors and his friends and his family when he would tell them oh i'm going to be the father of many nations god has come down and he's spoken directly to me i i've i've had a visitation i've had a vision from the lord all you can imagine maybe in their mind and their ability and i wonder i believe many times we feel like that too that we're called to go into a rapture we're called to go into a body change what that's going to look like and how it's going to happen at what time and what day i don't know i don't know if it's gonna be at nine o'clock six o'clock twelve o'clock is it going to be at one time frame around the whole globe is it going to be a sweep well i believe the rapture cycle has already started i've heard a word that started to lift me off from the face of the earth i have heard the shout oh behold the lord cometh with a shout oh we've heard the midnight cries says go ye out to meet him so all i know is i've accepted and received my eleazar that is leading me to the promised land and all i know is i just want to be faithful and believe the word that i've received how it's going to happen i don't know i'm not called to make it happen i'm called to believe it until it happens so just being encouraged on that and and now brother billy came behind that and started to talk about the pattern of god oh and how there was a pattern there in heaven that god had something in his mind and then moses oh he came down with that pattern he laid it out in the tabernacle it was a pattern something that he had received from heaven and we know we can say the same thing that i came from god and i'm going back to god what we're doing now is the spiritual amnesia is being stripped away we had the shock of sin and we bypassed our theophany and we've ended up on down here we didn't even really know are the fullness that we had with the father in the beginning oh job where were you when i laid the foundation of the world where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy you were there i was fellowship with brother billy about that you know we had a choice brother billy said this he goes could you imagine if we hope i ain't stealing any of the thunder brother billy but he said could you imagine if we were standing over there and here the lord came and said you know what i want to ask you who will stand with me who will stand against this lucifer the one that is sowing these seeds of confusion who will stand with me and oh there was the sons of god that will stand with you we'll stand with you and say do you know what you're signing up for i don't care what i'm signing up for but if it's standing next to you i stand with you well if it means pain if it means things that i've never even experienced let me be found faithful standing next to your side and he says well do you realize there's going to be something called a shock of sin something is going to happen to you and there's going to be a shock of sin and you're actually going to bypass your theophany and the very state that you're in now and you're going to come down into an earthly form into an earthly a place in a realm of time and it's in that time you're going to experience sickness you're going to experience death you're going to experience all these things and the greatest or worst thing that you're going to experience you're not even going to know who you are your very identity that you have with me in the beginning oh you're not even going to know who you are well lord is that what you want for me because i'll stand with you yes yes that's my plan that's what i had in my mind from the very beginning lord i'll go whatever you want me to do lord i'll go and oh what has happened there's sons of god that was with him in the very beginning and now you found yourself in the deepest darkest uh worst age of all ages in a mock of unbelief all surrounded by a bunch of prostitutes and darkness that's so evil and men lovers of men and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god oh it's such a sickness all over the face of the earth but there's a part of you that didn't come from here there's a part of you that can't identify and what it was it was his very heart purpose it was his very plan that as lucifer would come into a perfect eden there in the garden of eden and in a perfect eden that lucifer would deceive his children and they would fall he would allow a bride in the end time in satan's eden with all the obstacles and he said she'll do what eve couldn't do and that's believe the word and hold on to every single word can you imagine you have the opportunity and the privilege to live in the age that all the saints of old wanted to live in and now you are here and what is the word doing the vision the sealed book has been opened and now you're starting to realize who you are what was my plan in the plan of redemption where was i before i bypassed my theophany and you're starting to receive your identification as the revelation of the seals as unfolded to you which is christ oh and it's bringing you up into higher heights it's bringing you up into a realm where all things are possible oh what a wonderful word we've been feasting on this day this scripture is fulfilled oh we're walking right into that pattern paul said according as he has chosen you in him before the foundation of the world uh such wonderful things that were as this message unfolds we start to get a greater revelation of what these things mean in romans 8 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god jesus would say in john 5 19 he said the son can do nothing but what the father shows him and then the prophet of god would pick that up and you say now notice that when jesus said that the son can do nothing but what the father shows him to do notice that he didn't say here he said but shows him what to do he said what was it he was before i do anything i see by vision what the father shows me to do and then i go do it see now the word says in proverbs 29 18 it says where there is no vision that people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he and i want to focus on this portion right here in proverbs it says where there is no vision the people perish now the prophet of god would take this scripture and the voice of god in the last days and he would say it's a very outstanding time we realize that we're speaking from in the scriptures and really where he's pulling this text from he's going to refer um to samuel it says the word was precious in them days there was no open vision so the word of god was precious in them days there was no open vision and so now he's reading uh from this place in the scripture he says it's a very outstanding time we realize that what we're speaking from in the scriptures that has said there was no open vision in the days of samuel therefore where there's no vision the bible said the people perish we must have a vision and a vision comes to the prophets and it's the word of the lord spoken to them now this brother branham just said we must have a vision now maybe that might seem a little uh intimidating well i'm not a prophet brother matthew i can i can hardly have a spiritual dream a matter of fact i have more nightmares than i do spiritual dreams and now the prophet over here is saying we must have a vision and yes i hear jesus saying i do nothing but what the father shows me and hear the prophets tying that in and he's saying oh that he would have a vision well how am i ever going to go into that the scripture says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus let us go on unto perfection all of these things that have been spoken in the word and there's that part of us that came from god there in the beginning that believes that word but then we sit back with our carnal mind and we wonder what okay i got to have visions now so what it was going to take to have a vision now do i got to fashion to pray well maybe if i fast for eight days yog start having a vision do i gotta fast 12 days 20 days you go long enough without food i promise you i have a vision but you want a vision from the lord so if the prophet is saying here we must have a vision we must have a vision and if we must have a vision i want a vision so something in my heart is saying lord give me a vision i want a vision if i must have a vision lord then give me a vision how how can we have a vision he says a vision comes to the prophets and what is the vision now if we must have a vision he says the vision comes to the prophet and it's the word of the lord spoken to them now that's where just my heart purpose and what i'm speaking on to you tonight is the bride's vision it says where there's no vision the people perish what struck my heart is that where there's no vision the people perish what started to strike my heart with that scripture is praise god he has a vision concerning you praise god there is a vision concerning the bride of jesus christ because where there's no vision there's no word and where there's no word the people perish but all thank god in the end time god has sent a prophet with a vision and a word pertaining to a bride and he has called your name and he has revealed to you the vision the sealed book that was sealed has been open and now what is it doing it's revealing itself to you and that vision is concerning you it's a word from god that has come to the prophet that's how visions come that's how the word of the lord comes if god's going to do anything he reveals it unto his prophets the word of the lord comes to his prophet and now the prophet takes the word or the vision that he has received and he gives it out to the people and many times people don't understand when this man that has veiled like badger skin is standing there and he's speaking forth the word of god and they're rejecting that word they're not rejecting a man they're rejecting god to reject the prophet's message is to reject the vision of the word and when you've come into that place there's nothing left for it left for you but judgment this is a message of grace this is a message of love this is a message of unity this message is the greatest thing oh brother matthew you say message message message message message way too much well that might be the phonetic way that we describe what we've received at this hour call it the gospel the good news call it the words of jesus christ call it whatever you want to call it but i know i have met my redeemer i know that i have heard him speak my name in this day and it has changed me it's changed the way i acted it's changed the way i talk oh it's given me joy peace love and hope everything that the world could never give me and so much more oh that's what the gospel of jesus christ has done for me but not a gospel of 2000 years ago not a gospel of a glare in another age because we know that that gospel of another age can't do for you what we have need of in this hour it got to be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever according to the prophet's vision when the word said we could go through all of the familiar scriptures that were familiar with but there had to come a day where he could stand there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled we must have a vision and just thinking along these lines of a vision i love the story you'll find it in first kings it starts to speak about how elijah there was at the brook cherith there was a famine in the land and god was feeding his prophet there with the ravens and he was there uh uh brother branham takes this text to preach spiritual food and due season and there he was shut away in a secret place where god was was was feeding him but then the lord moved upon him and said now i want you to to go down to their path because i've commanded a widow woman to sustain thee so elijah he gets up and he goes down to their path and there he finds this widow woman now god think of this now god had given the prophet a word of the lord or a vision and now he's leading his prophet down to a widow woman and brother branham said he she wasn't like everybody else that had taken the mark of the beast but she had kept herself separate from all of those unbelievers and there she was in that condition a believer a widow woman with her only child and there she is she's coming out what is she doing she's going to get a couple of sticks that she can go in and make a fire and she's going to eat that cake and she's going to die i believe her think of her condition now and now here comes a prophet coming on down to her and he comes there maybe to the gate and the conversation goes says hey fetch me a little drink of water now that's maybe something that she had a little bit extra of being a good believer that was something that she was willing to share and and maybe she only had enough water to go one or two more days but she figured you know i'm going to die anyways but maybe i'll just do something something in my heart says i'll do something for this weary traveler and he goes and he says as she starts to go he see he asked something of her and she was willing to do it many times what god is testing you is when he's asking you to do something when it's hard to do it and i believe that's what the word of the lord is going forth in this hour he's starting to challenge you on your education he's starting to challenge on your place of employment he's starting to challenge you on your hours and stuff that you do with entertainment on your phone he's starting to challenge you in areas of your life where it takes sacrifice and it's uncomfortable oh but we live in ladies we don't want to be uncomfortable you wanna you want a glass of water i'd get you a glass of water you want this or that i'll get you something but when it starts to affect your comfort when it starts to affect where you live it starts to affect what you drive if it starts to affect your education if it starts to affect your phd and your lld and all those other things that you're looking after if it starts to affect that lord i'm not willing to lay those things down i gotta have an education to make it ladies i got to have these nice things to make it ladies and what you do what do you start to do you start to substitute the word of god for the things of the world thinking that those are the things that are supplying your need and the very thing that you have need of is the word and you're sacrificing the word for your own enjoyment for your own pleasure and here the prophet is standing there says oh give me a drink of water come to church on sunday morning i can do that oh come to church on sunday night maybe i can do that ty's ten percent oh my goodness it's getting a little bit hard but maybe i could do it why don't you go ahead and come to church on a wednesday i just don't think i can do it i'll lose my job i've spent all this time to get this profession and i don't want to lose this profession but the spirit of the lord is calling out for the manifestations of the sons of daughters and through this hour to come to perfection where every word is thus saith the lord and they won't let one of them drop oh is there a house of god that would say be it unto me according to thy word let me manifest this word lord jesus and now the prophet of god is requiring something now noticeable this is part of the vision and so now he says to her now i want you to not only get me a drink of water but go ahead and bring me a cake all of a sudden now the conversation changes now you know you're requesting something of me that is a sacrifice between life and death oh that's where every believer has to come down to where you're willing to lay yourself down at the altar and you're willing to die and say lord jesus no matter whatever it takes if it's this friend if it's this family if it's this job no matter whatever it is lord i'm willing to die for the sake of your word and now it's getting down home where she has to make a decision and she's standing there oh a drink of water's good but now i want you to bring me a cake all right all right prophet now i don't think you maybe know what you're requiring of me but what i love about this she doesn't know that there was a vision pertaining to her she doesn't know that in her condition in that very hour of calamity where she is going to eat a cake and die there has been a word or a vision from the lord come to a prophet who has now come on the scene and he's going to speak the very word that's going to sustain her in the time of the drought woo hallelujah thank god there's been a prophet that has come on the scene with thus saith the lord to sustain the bride in a drought in an age where there's spiritual wickedness on every hand but he has spoken a word to sustain a bride and a feeder in this hour and now here she is she's standing there says all right bring me a cake first she's all right well hold on here maybe you don't understand the gravity of the situation you don't understand how many college hours i don't know why we keep going there sometimes we need to speak it though sometimes there might be a young a man of god who's called to the mission field or he's called to preach and he's weighing in the balance all of the money and the spending and his earnings and his visa and everything that has been laid out before him and he's walked in the footsteps of god and maybe it's all been not in vain but to bring him to this place now where he would stand like this widow woman and he would look standing there looking at the prophet you'd say bring me a cake first well i was gonna go in there and i was i was just gonna bake a cake and me and my son were going to die said okay i know the gravity of your situation but i want you to do as thou has said go ahead and go in there and bake a cake but bring me one first now all of a sudden i want to say now it was her part in the vision because now it was her opportunity to put god first and what does she do she goes in there and she does now what the vision had said she would do she goes in there and as she's going the prophet says thus saith the lord oh that barrel of meal will never run dry that cruce of oil will never run dry until i sin rain upon the earth why because she had put the lord first and that's what god is calling for us to do is to put him first the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of god in his righteousness and all of these other things will be added unto you that's the vision of the lord that he's speaking to you in this hour is that you put him first and everything else he'll take care of it makes me think of of the prophet elisha there he was traveling and and there was this uh uh believer that saul and traveling by and she constrained him one day and said why don't you just stay here i i i maybe we'll make why don't you stay at our place and rest here a little while and as elisha would travel on by there uh they they that she spoke to her husband they built them a little partition built them a little uh a lean two off the side of the house and said look we've made your little apartment here you just come and go as you feel need uh if you're traveling or whatnot this is always a place for you and one day the prophet of god he gets up and he says you know gaza what can we do to repay this this woman and this man for all the kindness and the hospitality that they have shown unto us and gaheza says well prophet elijah he says uh though the woman is barren and the man is old in age and they have no son and so then the prophet of god comes to cure and says look because of what you have done unto me according to the time of life does that sound familiar reminds me of melchizedek coming to there to abraham in the in the plains of memory he had given him a promise and there he was faithfully believing it oh but he appeared unto him there melchizedek said according to the time of life thou shalt have a son so marvel to me that in that story sarah laughs but in this story this this lady also says to the prophet says oh man of god don't lie to me man of god don't lie to me why would i i'm my my husband's old i'm getting there in age and i've been barren why would you tell me that i'm going to have a son don't lie to me not that she was uh uh she she wasn't telling the prophet that he was lying almost something or her heart if i could say it like this would be oh let it be true let it be true don't lie to me and the prophet would say it like this he'd say and he said well just go in other words and you'll see just go on because he had already seen the vision it was all over oh if we could start to understand that there's already been a vision there's already been a word there's already been something that has come to the prophet of the hour and he has spoken a word concerning you and it's already all over you keep getting all worried you're getting all flustered that you're not seeing evidences and signs and things in your life but although it tarry don't worry it's going to come to pass that right season it will speak for itself you keep believing that word of promise i think of the scripture as we were just referring to john 5 19 it says that i have needs to go by samaria jonathan 5 19 he says i do nothing but what the father shows me i have needs to go by samaria well why was he going by samaria because now he had received a vision of the lord now for him to go into samaria because there was a predestinated seed there that he was going to harvest that he was going to bring to manifestation we know the story at the woman at the well we just continue here let's read out of daniel 12. it says in uh verse 8 it says and i heard but i understood not then said i oh my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the end time go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the end time prophet of god is going to pick this up here and the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel in 61. he says the end time message shall reveal it the last church age glory there you are oh my it shakes me to think of it the mystery the things that the church world bats their eyes at and says it's nonsense the mystery of who jesus christ was not a third person not the second person not the third person but the person of god all these mr other mysteries of god will be revealed because it's wrote here in this book and be revealed to the end time generation they can no more see it in the seminaries and the schools and denominations then the jews could see jesus being the messiah no wonder they try to think you're crazy no wonder they think you're foolish no wonder they can't understand why you don't cluck up with them because there's a power and a vision behind it a word of god that's been revealed to get the church in order for the rapture and the going home oh there's a power and a vision behind you you're hearing what the prophet saying there is a power and a vision behind this word well what is the power what is the vision what is the word it's the revelation of jesus christ the very sealed book that had been hidden down through the ages what is the revelation of jesus christ when you get in there into the book of revelation which is the revelation what does the prophet start to talk about he starts to talk about something that is veiled and then it's unveiled and that's what's been unveiled in our day is jesus christ and that revealing comes with a power and a vision behind it you realize that there is a power and a vision behind you and that nothing is going to let that vision fail nothing when the prophet had that vision of the bride coming back around marching onward christian soldiers and there's a few just maybe getting back out of step he says oh get back in line get back in line oh we're marching onward christian soldiers we're marching forward victorious you've already been seen in the vision oh man i know about you that makes me happy that makes me excited to know that the things that i've seen in the word and the things that i've heard the prophet say that there's a power and a vision behind those things that's going to bring it to pass i'm rejoicing in that because where there is no vision the people perish but thank god i've received a vision thank god that i've received a word that's going to bring me back to where i came from oh we can just start thinking of certain types here in the scripture you know i was just thinking of how that scripture we just are laboring on where there's no vision the people perish and i i uh when i was picking out granite for my my house there for the kitchen island and you know for the countertops there you you go to all these uh uh granite stone yards where they have all these stones that are hewn out in it's just maybe an acre uh full of uh maybe a half acre some of them bigger than others but you just go and then there's all these stones that have been hewed out of the earth and you and you go look at all of them and they just my you just start to look at it you start to think how awesome that god is this stuff that was buried in the earth it's so beautiful and then maybe they they take that stone and they put it in the house and then they they polish it all up and boy it just looks so beautiful and you start to think my that this stone was elected this stone was chosen because this stone had a vision for it all of the other stone and all the other earth that was laid out there and i just started thinking of mighty angelo and how he had he'd gotten that stone there and what was he going to do he had a vision and he had something in his mind that he was going to shape and he wanted to bring that that stone into the form of moses and as brother billy had alluded to when he was preaching about the pattern of god talking about a remnant look it's all the same fabric but a pattern's laid out out over it and here the master he's taking that stone and he's shaping it into the image or the vision that he had in his mind think of that what what made this stone so special that it was predestinated that it was elected that god had a vision pertaining to it that he wanted to mold it and make it into something and we love how brother random takes that type there and he preaches the message the masterpiece and i'm just so thankful that i can look into the word and see myself standing there to know that god has had a vision pertaining to me that he's shaping me and that he's molding me and he he's working on me to bring me into that image that he's not gonna let me go to the wayside i'm not like all the other religions and denominations and all those that have rejected the word but we say lord if it's hard if it's cutting lord jesus whatever you would have for me lord i believe it if you gotta take the the the the block and knock it this way and knock off this corner and you gotta get out the chisel and you gotta crack this over here lord whatever it is that you have to do to me lord be it unto me according to thy word the prophet of god says in the masterpiece he says if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she's just smit a smitten piece of him there's the masterpiece it was smitten mikey angelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but god is going to do it he's going to bring this little bride that's spitting right back to the side of the original word and there he is there's the masterpiece the family back in the garden of eden oh you realize that you're his vision you are the vision of god you are the word of god made flesh in this hour the very thoughts of god being expressed but all we just see all the hard work we see all the flesh man we see all we see that gap we see all the insufficiencies oh but if we could just stay focused on what god is doing as the musicians come we'll find a place to to finish as i was just thinking about this pondering you you're his vision i'm his vision with all of this with all these failures with all of this gross darkness with what i did last week and what i did three weeks ago lord how could i be your vision how could i be your vision that you're wanting to have in this last days when i see all my faults and failures this bag of bones you mean lord you you've called me you've elected me you've chosen me this sinful nature this is what your vision was well you're not looking through the eyes of god you're not looking through the blood you're not looking from that vision or from that high spot where god had a perfect picture of you and now he's bringing that perfect picture into that full manifestation i think of that the the the scripture there i believe in ezekiel it says can these dry bones live what this bag of bones this flesh man can i live can i manifest this message okay can these bag of bones live son of man oh what did he say he said thou knowest and what did he tell the prophet he said prophesy he told him to speak the word and when he spoke the word all of a sudden as that word and that vision was uttered all of a sudden out there all of those dry bones oh they started to wake up out of the dust they started to wake up out of the earth all this sinew and the flesh all started to come upon him and they started to stand up and that fourth messenger that life messenger breathed the word into him oh and they became a victorious army they started walking in the vision why because the word had come to the prophet and he had spoken the word i love this out of the church age book let's all just stand [Music] i think about it a son of man revealing the son of man this day this scripture is fulfilled god has come in the last days and he has spoken a word concerning you a word that cannot fail and there in the church age book he says in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each age came forth in the designated season decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a mini-member body whereas once god was manifested to one member even our lord jesus christ oh i think of the scripture here in ephesians 5 it says husbands love your wives as christ has loved the church and gave himself for it that he verse 26 that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might do it the word that's be revealed in this hour is none other than jesus christ taking his bride washing you cleansing you sanctifying you he's justified you he's glorifying you he's saying come on unto me all ye who are heavy laden and i'll give you rest don't worry about all the trials don't worry about all the problems i understand that you don't have enough oil in the cruise i understand that you don't have enough meal to bake but i'm just asking you to give me up my portion first just come unto me all year heavy laden and i will give you rest because what am i doing that i might present paul says that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blame [Music] and without blemish oh thank you lord thank you lord that this is the vision that i'm holy [Music] without blame before i'm in love i just want to close if you'll just listen to this last statement here things that are to be it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the bible says so jesus said be therefore perfect even as your heavenly father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people come now not quit looking at the negative this is the vision and the word of the lord coming to you to tell you that you are a perfect people coming to a perfect kingdom because you have to stand to be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen oh i believe we're living in an hour where there's a bride that can read that right there and the prophet of god said here is the vision here's the word of the lord and he says she stands perfect i believe there's a bride here tonight that can say this day this scripture is fulfilled oh the devil wants me to back down off of that well i'm waiting for this to catch up over there i'm waiting for these things to happen i'm waiting to see these certain manifestations in my life no i'm not looking at my ideas i'm not looking at my vision that's what jesus christ came to do he came to sanctify you and paired you from all of your ideas he came to take away your vision that you had he came to take away what you thought you were going to do and he came to give you his mind he came to give you his word he came to reveal his vision that was written in that mystery that was hidden before the foundation of the world and now you're just finding out who you really are that you can manifest what's been spoken greater than all [Music] my sins [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] greater than
