Lord, we're grateful that we don't have to be here in this building, but Lord, that you're a great physician that can make house calls. Lord, I pray in Jesus' name that you would go to each and everyone that is home, that is sick, that is not well, that is not here with us, and that you would restore them, Lord God. Lord, we call upon you as a great comforter, Lord, that you would comfort our brother and his time of loss, oh God, that you'd be his portion, Lord, the many needs that are on the hearts of people. Lord, the song we sang earlier, God still moves. Regardless of how much time or how many symptoms or how many circumstances pile up, Lord, you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You do still move. Because you live, we can face tomorrow. Lord, we commit every need present in your hands, Lord, asking that you would have your will and way and that you would move in a mighty way. We love you and just ask that you'd speak to our hearts, Lord. May your word be anointed, Lord. May it bring forth that which you've purposed it to do. May we be molded and shaped into your image, Lord God. May we surrender our will and Lord, we just desire to be what you have created us to be. We love you and thank you Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. [Music] Oh, and this is my desire [Music] to honor you. Lord, with all my heart I worship you. [Music] All I have within me, Lord, and I give you praise. All that I adore is in you. [Music] [Applause] Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. [Music] I live for you, oh Lord. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.

Hallelujah. I think this might just be an opportunity if you haven't taken it in a while, why don't you just use right now just to start to talk to him. Don't worry about your neighbor. You know, I I I just want to say he's worthy of praise. I say he's worthy to tell him, Lord, you're the King of Kings. You're the Lord of glory. You're the great I am the creator of heavens and earth, Lord. And I worship you. And I worship you alone, Lord. And I want to give you glory. And I want to give you honor, Lord. I I want to lift your name up on high because you are worthy to be praised, Lord. Your works cannot be compared. They they can't be fathom, Lord. The depth of your love, your greatness, Lord, it's too high. It's too low. It's too wide. We can't even begin to comprehend, Lord. And we just want to tell you we thank you Lord. We thank you for your love. We thank you for your grace. We thank you for your mercy Lord. Thank you for this message. Thank thank you for pulling us out of Lady Osia and pulling us out of the muck and mire. Lord uh giving us Isab that we might see. Lord we just want to worship you this morning a little bit. Tell you how much we love you and appreciate you Lord. I believe you desire and seek those that would worship you. Lord, not in spirit only, but in truth. And Lord, you've given us truth. You've illuminated our path and opened our eyes that we might see. And Lord, because of what you've done in this day, in this age, Lord, we can declare that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are not just a God of 2,000 years ago. Lord, you are present here amongst us right now to minister to our needs. So, we just surrender to you that you would have your will and way in this service. We ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Hallelujah. It's good to be in his presence. Let's just go ahead and turn in our Bibles to First Thessalonians chapter 4. Amen. We were going to maybe minister along a certain line, but I kind of got pulled back into this sermon as we listened to why Christ speak. And uh we ministered a couple uh weeks ago on a Sunday morning on the pull of the rapture. And we just uh we were bringing that out of why Christ speak. And just want to pick up on that thought, but we'll we'll title this uh speak and go forward. In 1 Thessalonians 4:16, I sure like this. It says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words, Amen. You may have your seats. Brother Brandham would say in why cry speak in paragraph 49 he says just as we know as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture we know we've lived the time out and the time of the rapture is at hand. And we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in. Well, I like how our text said, "Comfort one another with these words." We are going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; These bodies will be changed. And uh I just pull for an inspiration from paragraph 239. Why Christ speak? He says, "Speak to the people and let's go forward." &gt;&gt; Speak to the people and let's go forward. Amen. We got an objective. &gt;&gt; That's glory. &gt;&gt; I like that objective. &gt;&gt; A lot of people got objectives out there. &gt;&gt; Things they're wanting to accomplish and they have goals and ambitions and, you know, they they some people believe, well, I I've been raised up for this purpose. you know, I I'm going to be a ball player or I'm going to be an architect. You know, I have a goal and objective in my life and and there's things that I want to accomplish and and and you know, they they go through great measures and lengths to be educated and and those things are okay. But I would say this, if if God ever gives you a a a career or profession, uh uh you it's it's not that you are an architect, but you are a Christian and your objective is glory, and you are just holding the office of an architect. &gt;&gt; Because when people come in contact, your trade might be an architect, but your objective is glory. &gt;&gt; I I I say that that comfort one another with these words. You ain't working for a paycheck. I say if you want to be in bondage and you want to and you just want to tie right in with the rat race and everything and and you're just working to pay the bills and you're just working to get a paycheck and oh if I can just get a raise I'll be able to afford that car and then and if I can do this and oh I tell you what that's not really a good objective those things are okay and it's nice to strive to have uh nice things you know even scripturally it says oh you know above all I would have you to prosper but even the world and Christianity has taken in that and made a prosperity mess out of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I would say there's one thing that God would want you to prosper in is that is in the word. He wants you to prosper in the message of the hour and in his objective and his objective is glory. And I say, praise God, we got an objective. &gt;&gt; Lady OCA ain't got nothing on me. &gt;&gt; I it it's tried and and designed to try to pull you into its objective. Have you ever uh uh uh got got talking to somebody and they have something to sell you or they want to talk you talk you into something here recently? I I I I had an invitation to maybe uh uh witness to an a a gentleman and and he had questions and and I thought, you know, I'd certainly want to help him. And the more I got to talking to him, all he had was questions. &gt;&gt; And I found out he wasn't really looking for answers. He was just wanting to question. And I thought, "My, this sounds really really really familiar." He says, 'Well, aren't you, aren't you open to other ideas? You know, I, you know, I've talked to people and they're so rigid and they're so they're so set in their ways, but but are you open to maybe considering h something you haven't thought of before? Or are you open to maybe considering another way? &gt;&gt; And I said, let me ask you something, sir. I said, I want to tell you, I'm happily married. And I said, "I love my wife and she loves me." &gt;&gt; Now, do you think it would be fair for a man to come to her and say, "I want to ask you, are you open to another way of thinking?" &gt;&gt; I said, "You see, I'm in a relationship with my Lord, &gt;&gt; and I am married to him, and I'm not open to any suggestions. I'm not open to any other way. &gt;&gt; I have an objective." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We got an objective. That's glory. Let's move to it. &gt;&gt; We're headed to the promised land. &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; Speak to the people. Haven't I proved it? Haven't I even had my picture made among you &gt;&gt; and everything else and done everything that could be done to prove that I'm with you? Doesn't the magazines just a few weeks ago packed the article when you said here at the pulpit that would take place out here and three months beforehands and there it went taking place and vindicate even the science knows about it. Everybody you following the prophet &gt;&gt; and everything that I've done and you're still waiting speak to the people and go forward to your objective. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have an objective. &gt;&gt; What is our objective? What is your objective? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What is your objective? &gt;&gt; Glory. I I like that. And and and it wasn't my idea. That was God's mind to you. You have an objective. And I'd say we ought to remind ourselves with that. We ought to comfort one another with these words that we got an objective. We are going into the promises of God. We are going into a rapture. I have an objective. My objective is rapture. My objective is body change. My objective is the word of God. My objective is the message of the hour. My objective is not Lady Osia. My objective is not my job. Yes, in Lady Osia. And in my job, I will declare the works of the Lord. For ye are the light of the world. Let let the world see your good works that it might glorify God. But we have an objective. And I want to say that there is no obstacle. &gt;&gt; There is no trial. &gt;&gt; There's no Red Sea. &gt;&gt; There ain't no death. There ain't no devil. There ain't no demon &gt;&gt; that can stop you from moving forward into your objective. Uh maybe I should say that again because some of us need some deliverance. Some of us need to be reminded because even the prophet of God in this sermon, why Christ speak, he said Moses forgot. He said others didn't. Samson, he knew and others knew. But you know Moses somehow forgot. He forgot that he was anointed and he was called and he was elected for the job and he forgot. I say it's good to be reminded that we have an objective and we are going forward into every promise of God and there ain't no trial. There ain't no devil. There ain't no hardship. There ain't no fault. There ain't no failure. There's nothing that's going to hinder me from moving into my objective. And my objective is glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's move into it. Let's go forward. Let's move into our objective. We have an objective. Oh, I like that. I'm so glad that's I tell you what, you know, a lot of times when uh uh when maybe uh uh things might need to be done and you're handing out chores or or maybe you're trying to build something, you know, you start handing out jobs and hey, I need you to do this and and you to do that and and maybe you're putting together a skit, you know, and and you're getting a little parts and and I and I remember one time we did a little play and and about uh uh uh Rebecca and Isaac, you know, and and and we had to hand out parts. You know, some people had to be camels. Is there still any camels here? Are all the camels gone? I know. Somebody had to be a palm tree. I don't know. Is our palm tree still here, man? All of All of Hey, I think I see them back there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you might have forgot, Brother Tuanda, but you were a palm tree, &gt;&gt; right? We But we all had to play a part, &gt;&gt; you know? I got to be Rebecca's father. A and and I I Jackson got to be uh uh oh, how how could I forget his name? Mel uh Ellie. Uh uh oh. Oh my. That's that's a shame. But all the parts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; All the parts had to be played. &gt;&gt; And somebody was like, "Oh, I want the lead part. I I I want to I want to be Rebecca. I want to be Isaac. &gt;&gt; I want to be Elizer. I want to I want to I want to be the main character. &gt;&gt; And I just think, oh, to think that God when he was laying out his great plan and he was coming to the climax of everything that he had ever desired and how his first masterpiece uh fell into the earth and he built back into another masterpiece in Christ Jesus. And now through 2,000 years, he was building up again into a great climax to have a bride. And when the parts were being handed out, he said, "I want you to play that part. And I want you to play that part." What is my objective? Your objective is glory. Your objective is rapture. Your objective is body change. You're the main character. &gt;&gt; You're the apple of his eye. He died for you. He went to Calvary for you. He went to hell for you. He rose from the grave and has ascended up on high. I say he's worthy to be praised. And he has elected you and called you and given you an objective. &gt;&gt; Oh, that makes me happy. &gt;&gt; And there ain't no devil. &gt;&gt; There ain't no demon. And there ain't no church member that can take your part. You don't have to be sitting over there wondering and worrying, "Well, Lord, I thought you gave me a gift to be this, and I I thought you called me to do this." &gt;&gt; That's not faith. &gt;&gt; See, faith doesn't fear. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't wonder. As you move further in the message, Brother Random starts talking about having faith in your anointing. having faith in your calling, what you've been called to do, &gt;&gt; and how Satan wants to get you to reason and to wonder. Oh, oh, well, well, maybe maybe this or maybe that. No, I say it's time to have faith in who we are. &gt;&gt; As we would read in the scripture in Exodus 14 and 14, it would say, "The Lord shall fight for you, &gt;&gt; and you shall hold your peace." And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward." We're ministering on the thought speak and go forward. Let's go forward to our objective. Every promise in the Bible is yours. Amen. A every promise that God has given you, I want to tell you, it's yours. You don't have to wonder. You don't you don't have to fear. You don't you don't have to think about somebody else is going to take your part. You don't have to worry about uh uh the enemy catching up to you and tearing you down. No, I think it's if you go on and just read a little bit further, here comes the armies of of of Egypt coming after uh uh uh the children of Israel. And what does the scripture says? The very pillar of cloud that was leading them and guiding them. What did it do? It went back and it stood between the enemy and between the camp of Israel. I want to tell you this message, this pillar of fire, this cloud that has descended, the Lord himself shall descend. What is it? It's the mighty angel coming down clothed with a cloud. And what is he doing? I say he stands between you and the enemy. The devil tries to shift you out. The devil tries to tear you down. But I want to say this word is your protection. This word is keeping you. This word is guiding you. This word is going to show you the way. This word will part the Red Sea. Any devil, any demon that tries to get in the way of your objective, you can speak the word and go forward. &gt;&gt; Well, how we going to do it? How we going to go in a rapture? How we going to possess the promised land? How are we going to defeat the enemy? How are how how are we going to do these things? Brother Matthew, I was listening to the greatest battle ever fought and and uh oh my uh uh brother Brandham started to he starts to talk about, you know, uh that's what Satan's kingdom does is Satan brings sickness and disease and he brings all of these things onto the children of God. But he said, he said, "But God's children, God's army is ordained to cast it out." &gt;&gt; He said, "We cast down reasoning. We cast out devils. We cast down sickness." Satan brings all these things onto the believer. But we, as the army of God, what do we do? We cast it down. &gt;&gt; He he he goes a little bit further and he starts to talk about uh uh Grant, I believe it is. And he said he said you know how how did how did Grant take Richmond you know that that great victory there in the Civil War I believe as he as he came to Richmond Virginia and it says how you know he says how did rich how did he take it he said as he come to it he said that's how each one of us how are you going to get the victory I would say as you come to it how are you gonna go through the Red Sea as you come to it how is bitter water gonna be made sweet as you come to it how are you gonna drink water in the middle of the desert as you come to it. How are you going to cross over the river Jordan? As you come to it, you don't need to be fearing and you don't need to be wondering how is God going to do it? How am I going to take a body change? How am I going to go into a rapture? All I know is I'm walking with Jehovah. I have the pillar of fire that is with me and I will overcome as I come to it. As I have the need &gt;&gt; that why why are you crying about it? If there is a need there, I will overcome for you as you have the need. &gt;&gt; Oh, he I laid this in there. He said, "God's method is to cast out evil, cast down reasoning, cast down superstitions, &gt;&gt; cast down worry. &gt;&gt; We We should stay there a little while this morning. Some of us are worrying about our kids. &gt;&gt; Some of us are worrying about our health. Some of us are worrying about our job. &gt;&gt; It's not healthy. &gt;&gt; Plenty of people come through the prayer line and brother Brandham, discern the thoughts and intents of their heart. Uh worried or nervousness or trying to cross bridges before you get there and and you're worried. Is my boy going to be saved? Is my girl cast that down? &gt;&gt; Hey, you demon of glory. I cast you down. &gt;&gt; I am a child of God. I have been elected and I have an objective and my objective is to take the sword of the world and cast you down. &gt;&gt; Hey, let's get the worry and the gloom off the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; We are not wondering. We are not fearful. I am not worried. My kids will be saved. They will be born again. They will go in a rapture. Hallelujah. I am not worried. I am not wondering. I am not fearful. Why? Because I am elected. I am called. I'll get my mommy. I'll get my daddy. I'll get my brother. I'll get my sister. &gt;&gt; I am of the faith of Abraham. Lord, I'm coming for you. You might not go in a rapture, but I will rescue you out of the hands of Satan. &gt;&gt; I claim you for the glory of God. I am not worried, devil. &gt;&gt; You had me worried. You had me fearful. You had me doubt. Oh, but the word of the Lord has come. &gt;&gt; And now that word is in my mouth. &gt;&gt; There's power in confession. &gt;&gt; I say it's time. The bride of Jesus Christ takes the revealed word and starts speaking. Speak. Speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; I am the bride. &gt;&gt; And I have an objective. Devil, I cast you out in the name of Jesus Christ. worry. You can't stay here any longer. &gt;&gt; Doubt, fear, anxiety, depression. &gt;&gt; I cast you out. &gt;&gt; I have an objective. &gt;&gt; If my brother's in bondage, I have an objective. If the devil comes on the scene, &gt;&gt; you got a problem, devil. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord. Oh my. The mighty angel has descended &gt;&gt; clothed in a cloud. &gt;&gt; What do you say? We seen the picture. &gt;&gt; The science has declared it. But where was his feet? His feet were as pillars of fire. &gt;&gt; And his feet, hey, that's one objective or position I don't mind having because if you're the feet of the Lord and I say on that day of Pentecost, what was it? It was pillars of fire. And the Lord has descended with a shout. It's our headship. But he got a body pillars of fire walking around the earth possessing the land having dominion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cast down worry. &gt;&gt; Cast down diseases. &gt;&gt; Cast down sin. &gt;&gt; You're above it. &gt;&gt; I want him to read it. This is out of greatest battle ever fought. Who's this speaking? &gt;&gt; The mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Matthew, uh, was that pre63? Oh, don't miss it. Are you going to limit God to space and time and your calendar? God will do what he will. &gt;&gt; And according to divine promise, God had come and veiled himself in a man. &gt;&gt; And it was none other than Jehovah speaking. And he said, "You're above it. Cast down disease. Cast down sin. You're above it. Resurrected in Christ Jesus, setting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot." &gt;&gt; I like that objective. &gt;&gt; That's You mean that's I've called you to play this part? What is it? Let me read you the script. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read you the part I want you to play. &gt;&gt; Am I the palm tree? Am I the camel? What am I? No, you're the bride of Jesus Christ. You're bone of my bone. You are flesh of my flesh, life of my life. You are power of my power. And here is your script. Cast down worry. Cast down disease. Cast down sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're above it. &gt;&gt; Resurrected in Christ Jesus, sitting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot. &gt;&gt; Well, where you at, devil? &gt;&gt; Cuz I am going to put my foot on your head. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put my foot on your neck because footsteps are possession. &gt;&gt; The Red Sea wasn't a challenge. It was a victory. And I want to tell you, every trial, every battle, every demon, every disease, every challenge that the devil throws at you, it's just another victory. &gt;&gt; You are victorious in the name of Jesus Christ. He says this in paragraph 353, that's how soldiers take sin, &gt;&gt; sickness. just as they come to it. &gt;&gt; Well, I I some somebody just came into a trial. &gt;&gt; Well, then I say prepare yourself for victory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Devil, you you messed with the wrong one. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they got that saying in the world. You picked the wrong one, homie. Sorry, I used to talk like it. &gt;&gt; I used to run like it. And there's a few times I had to apologize because I realized I got into something was a little bigger than me. And then you grow up a little bit more and get a little bit bigger. And then you think, oh, then you lose your common sense. You should have said sorry, but you you don't know how you you don't owe the do the devil any apology. You you can't cross the Red Sea. You can't have your family. You can't have your health. Who Who says who? &gt;&gt; Says you. &gt;&gt; Who do you think you are, Goliath? You come to me in the name of science and education and the gods of this evil age. I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The same God that whooped you at Calvary. The same God that poured out his spirit on the day of Pentecost. The same God that was in brother Paul. The same God that was in brother Brandham. The same God is here right now to take you through that Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Cast it out. &gt;&gt; That's the way they overcome doubts and fears and things is when one rises, they chop them down. &gt;&gt; Move out of the way. &gt;&gt; That was a profession. &gt;&gt; Did you see it? Hey, I had I went through a season of a spooky spirit preached and didn't realize I was preaching my life for six months. A spirit moved up on me and started talking to me. You know what I had to do? I actually dismissed myself and took that thing to a back room and started speaking to it. And the prophet of God said it, you don't know it. You run into devils all the time. If you don't, you will. &gt;&gt; There's a real devil. You better recognize them real. But when you recognize I'm real, then you recognize, hey, devil, greater is he that is in me than you. Greater is he that is in me than that cancer. Greater is he that is in me than that worry. Greater is he that is in me than that diabetes. Greater is he that is in me than that anxiety. &gt;&gt; Cast it out. Move out of the way. Oh my. That's it. God cast them out like he did in heaven. Our great chief captain showed us how it was done. &gt;&gt; We have an objective. We know where we are going. We know who the enemy is. We have a vindicated message, a pillar of fire, signs and wonders leading us into every promise of the hour. As Paul would write in Philippians 3:13, he said, "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto the things which are before, I press toward the mark, I press toward the objective of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." Continuing on now, just laying this principle back in. Why Christ speak? Just picking up in the message 161. For you see, faith sees what God wants done. Oh, I hope this goes in. Faith doesn't look at the present time. Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly. Now, we've read a little bit about what God wants, his objective, &gt;&gt; what you're called for. God wants and it works accordingly. That's what faith does. It sees what God wants and what God wants done. And faith operates through that. Oh my. There's where we get ourselves in trouble. We try to operate through what we want and what not not what we need. Oh, isn't that like it is with the kids? You they say, "I'm hungry. What do you want to eat? I want a popsicle." Well, you ain't hungry. &gt;&gt; I'm hungry. What do you want to eat? I want ice cream. &gt;&gt; That's not what you need. That's what you want. And many times we're baby fashioned. &gt;&gt; We're telling God what we want and not what we need. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you better be very careful cuz he might give you what you want. And you find out it wasn't what you need. &gt;&gt; And then you have to come back and say, "Lord, I'm sorry. I asked for what I wanted, but what I wanted wasn't what I needed. Lord, I need you to take that one away." &gt;&gt; We could preach right there for a while. Lord, take my wants. Take my desires, Lord. Mold me and shape me, oh God, and bring me into that stature of a perfect man, Lord, where my wants are not my wants, but my needs are your word. [Music] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. I need your word. I need revelation. I need the objective Lord &gt;&gt; to become my reality. &gt;&gt; Oh, in the whole message, brother lays in, uh, Brother Brandham's laying in how Moses, he was born for the job. He was born with the equipment. He had intellectual faith. He knew he was a deliverer. He knew all these things. I'm called. I'm going in a rapture. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ. all intellectual faith. &gt;&gt; I can't miss it. You know, I'm predestinated. That's sure. Sure, Moses. Sure. Grow up a little bit. But with all that knowledge, there was one thing he lacked. Don't miss it. With all of that knowledge, with all that understanding, with all that intellectual faith. There was one thing he lacked and that was the pillar fire &gt;&gt; and that is what Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10 1-7 has made available to you is the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's God's provided way. It's that word, that message. &gt;&gt; It makes a way for you to come into his presence. &gt;&gt; When you read in Psalms 119, he says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet." The word is like a lantern that the prophet of God said that carries you into his presence. The very message of Malachi 4:5 has come to carry you into the presence of God. And then in his presence of the pillar of fire, he could anoint &gt;&gt; that understanding &gt;&gt; brotherham said the pillar the pillar of fire had what Moses lacked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants done. faith. We were ending on that quote. It says faith operates through that, right? So, we want to operate through the word. We want to operate through through what God has called us to. What what what God's objective for our life is. And I want to tell you if there's if something is contrary to the objective, you have a right as a child of God to cast that thing out. &gt;&gt; Your objective is glory. &gt;&gt; Fear is contrary. Worry is contrary. Doubt is contrary. Cast it out. &gt;&gt; Faith is long range vision. It don't lower its sight. It holds to the target. &gt;&gt; See, Satan's He's always trying to get you to question your calling to cause confusion, doubt, and and fear. Trying to get you to lean to your own understanding and get you to reason and to compromise with the word. God gives you an objective. God gives you a word. We take God at his word. We believe him for the word. And what does Satan want to do? He wants to come and offer you a way that God will carry it out. It's exactly what he did to Eve. &gt;&gt; Well, oh, oh, no, no, no. You'll be like God. No, this is what God wants. Oh, really? And what did she do? She turned towards reasoning. She turned from the word of God to an explanation. And oh my goodness, how many times are we guilty of trying to explain the will of God for our own life instead of saying what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; Now paragraph 168 just continuing. He says notice faith sees what God wants you to see. Faith sees what God sees and reasoning and senses see what the world wants you to see. Notice reasoning. Why? It's only human senses only reason that it well ain't this just as good. &gt;&gt; See that's just exactly when you use those senses which are contrary to the word. See then that's what the world wants you to see. &gt;&gt; But faith don't look at the bills. I mean faith don't look at that. &gt;&gt; Faith don't look at well my company's going out of business. How am I going to pay the bills? The same way you always paid the bills. &gt;&gt; Your work wasn't paying the bills. He was paying the bills. &gt;&gt; Don't give Lady OC any credit. Don't give your job any credit. If God give you the job, he'll give you another one. &gt;&gt; You don't have to fear. &gt;&gt; Cast that thing down. Amen. &gt;&gt; You cast down reasonings. Faith don't look at that. Faith looks at what God sees. You know, you cast down reasons. Brother Brandon would carry on. And in what paragraph 173, he he would say that faith brought Moses into obedience. And we could minister a while on that. But I want to say that faith uh uh when faith and revelation in this word starts to become a reality to to you. I it it it it produces an obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; You're no longer struggling with your dress. You're no longer struggling with with outside things. You know, it's a honing down. You know, first it's like my the big sledgehammer just chopping big old chunks off of your life and the sanctification and then washing you up and and setting you free and and now my you're you're you're you know uh now you're dressing right, you're acting right. You're you you know you're living life but living right. But then it's it's a fine honing down to where now you become a vessel, a sacrifice that's poured out for others because eternal life is living for others. you're no longer uh trying to fix yourself up and patch yourself up and and get you feeling good enough to go to church. Oh, I better read my Bible and listen to a message because I got church tomorrow and I don't want to go in church feeling unrighteous and unholy, you know, so so I better start praying and and I'm going to I'm going to listen to a little of the message, you know, so I'm kind of up to date, you know, like so I can kind of come in and feel good about myself, you know, you after you've been put through the ringer a little bit and and you start to realize, I don't know what I thought I knew and and God, I really need your help and and I really need the Holy Ghost, Lord, and I really don't understand the message and and I really don't know who the son of man is. Lord, I've really never even come face to face with the pillar of fire, but oh God, by your grace and by your mercy, Lord, I believe you've called me and you've elected me. Lord, I want to meet you face to face. I want to see that word and that reality that Moses had and brother Brandham had and the apostles had. Lord, I want that reality in my life. Lead me and guide me, build me up. Oh, give me your mind. And now you're walking in his presence. &gt;&gt; D out to your own ideas and your thoughts and your thinking. And it brings you into an obedience &gt;&gt; to his word and to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you might be doing something you don't even know that's not pleasing to the Lord. &gt;&gt; But then God anoint the pastor and say you ought not be wearing them high heels and the Holy Ghost goes, "Oh, I won't wear those anymore." But you prove you ain't got what you think you got when you wear them every Sunday. &gt;&gt; That's gospel. That's Bible. &gt;&gt; That's the message. your life, you know it by its characteristics. &gt;&gt; It's identified by its fruits. I I I just got to say it, you know, uh in in my profession of being a a certified arborist, one of the things we have to do is is it's called tree identification, you know, and so we can look at the bark and the leaf and the way it grows and its pattern and its shape. And even when it when it starts to sprout out of the ground, many times we can look at a little sapling and know that's an elm tree or or that's an oak tree. And and you know, I was thinking about it, how it's that it's identified by its characteristics. And if you don't know what it is, just wait a little while. &gt;&gt; Let it grow up into its maturity. And when it starts bearing for its fruit, you know it's an apple tree. &gt;&gt; And I sit there as an arrest and I say, "You're an apple tree." &gt;&gt; And then it struck me, I'm not telling that apple tree, it's an apple tree. Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not telling that elm sapling it's an elm sapling. &gt;&gt; That elm sapling's telling me &gt;&gt; I'm an elm tree. That apple tree is telling me I'm an apple tree. Why? Because it's bearing forth its fruit. &gt;&gt; You want to tell me you're the bride? Bear the fruits of the word. &gt;&gt; You want to tell me you're going in a rapture? Bear the fruits of the message. You want to tell me your objective's glory? &gt;&gt; Start living for glory. &gt;&gt; Stop living for your paycheck. &gt;&gt; Stop living for your boss and start living for Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, faith brings you into obedience. &gt;&gt; 177 There is no fear in faith. Faith knows about it. Faith, as I've always said, it's got great big muscles and hair on a chest. Faith says shut up. Kids, that's the only time you can say shut up is when you're talking to the devil. At least I'll tell my own kids that. If I ever hear you saying shut up, like, well, my my girls are giving the devil a whooping. Better not be talking to heaven that way, right? We respect one another. If I hear shut up, I'll be like, "Hey, let me get in on that." It's a good old beatd down. &gt;&gt; Shut up. Where's that devil at? I join my voice. Shut up, devil. You can't have my son. You got to have my children. &gt;&gt; You can't have my health. &gt;&gt; Shut up and sit down. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on as we try to just move through this a little bit. He he goes on and says, "Mo, Moses didn't fear Pharaoh. He didn't care what Pharaoh had to say. &gt;&gt; I say that's where we need to get is where we don't care what this world has to say. &gt;&gt; I don't care what social media has to say. I don't care what the news has to say. I don't care what my co-workers have to say. The God of this evil age has to say. I don't care nothing about it because I am not wondering. I am not fearful. I'm not just, oh, am I gonna make it? Am I gonna get there? Let me let me uh let me see what so and so said. And oh, am I really being a good Christian? No, there's no fear. We know who we are. I just want to read this in Romans 8:35. We know who we are, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Whose report will you believe? I said, "Whose report will you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord, &gt;&gt; not the doctor's report, not Pharaoh's report." Paul says this in Romans 8:35. He says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? as is as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things, come on, put your voice together. He's talking about you. &gt;&gt; I don't care what comes. Famine, pestilence, heartbreak, lust, loved ones, &gt;&gt; the grave. I don't care. Nay, in all these things we are more. &gt;&gt; Somebody say more. &gt;&gt; In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; Devil, you are too late. &gt;&gt; I know who I am. I know my objective &gt;&gt; and my objective is to whoop you. My objective is to cast you out. &gt;&gt; My objective is to take God at his word. My objective is glory. My objective is rapture. &gt;&gt; My objective is revelation. My objective is seeking and saving that which is lost. My objective is laying hands on the sick and they shall recover. My objective is to cast out evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Devil, you come too late to try to make me question who I am and where I am going. I like this now as we maybe we'll spend a little time here. He said Pharaoh tried to use his wisdom to make an agreement with Moses. Pharaoh tried to use his wisdom to make an agreement with Moses. See, see, once the plague started coming and once God started moving in your life a little bit, once you started getting a little victory and going to church and and you started reading your Bible and you started to get around the right people, Satan said, "I need to make a deal." They're starting to really believe the message of the hour. They're actually starting to believe God wants them to go to that mountain and worship. So, I need to come up with a plan. He said, "You know what? I'll let you have church. I I'll let God I I I move in your life. I'll let you go to church three times a week. Some of you can't even get that, so you go twice. Some of you can't do that, so you go once. I I I know I know who got the I know who got the better end of that deal. Satan offering a deal. &gt;&gt; Oh, you believe the message of the hour. You believe God sent a prophet. Why don't you go worship once a week? &gt;&gt; But then come right back to the mud pits in Egypt. Come back and slosh around in Lady Oia. Come back and work for your paycheck. Just call yourself a message believer. &gt;&gt; Just go worship for a little while. Oh, let God speak to you a moment. &gt;&gt; Those I love, I rebuke and chasen. &gt;&gt; And if you are without correction, you are a bastard born child. But I want to say I have a heavenly father who is interested in my objective. And if I ain't living right, he will correct me. He will spank me. He will whoop me. He will get me down and out where I say, "Oh, God, help me. I ain't living right, Lord. I believe. Help my unbelief. &gt;&gt; Give me the power to take you at your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be in church. I want to serve you. I want to dress right. &gt;&gt; Then don't make a deal with the devil. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "How many Pharaohs do we got in the land today?" How many pharaohs do we got in the pulpit today? Says the bride can only go so far. You can only have this much of God. God can only move this much in your life. You can only overcome this much. You'll never get total victory. I rebuke that devil. You can't have the promise God gave you. It's too late. I rebuke that devil. I cast you down. just just worship a little bit. He said paragraph 181, haven't we got that kind today? If you just join church, that's all right. But you know, the faith that Moses had didn't believe in a so far religion. I feel good because I got the same faith. Moses didn't believe in a so far religion. He said, "We're all going." &gt;&gt; See, Satan tried to say, "Well, maybe you got the Holy Ghost, but you just go. I'm going to keep your family. Hey, I got names written down on this tablet of some of your loved ones, and the devil's trying to say, "You're going to make it, but your family." Oh, but Moses had a different faith. &gt;&gt; Moses wasn't making no deal with the devil. &gt;&gt; No matter how much the devil said, "It's too late." He crossed the line. He said too much. Moses said, "We're all going. We're going all the way. We're going to the promised land. We just don't go out here and make a denomination and stop. We go on through." Amen. I am going to the promised land. &gt;&gt; God promised us. &gt;&gt; We do not have a so far religion. We're all going. &gt;&gt; I said we're all going. &gt;&gt; You mean my boy? Yeah, you can take your boy. &gt;&gt; The devil can't have him. &gt;&gt; We're all going. &gt;&gt; No, just you. Just you. No. No. I don't have a so far religion. I don't have a halfway religion. I have the faith that Moses had. I have the faith that Abraham had. I have the faith of the word. I ain't going halfway. I'm going all the way. And we're all going. And I'm taking you with me. Let's go forward. Speak the word. Let's go forward, church. Ephesians 6:16 says, "Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all &gt;&gt; the fiery darts of the wicked, &gt;&gt; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God." Remember, faith sees what God wants. &gt;&gt; We're going all the way. &gt;&gt; We're all going. We don't have a so far religion. We cast down worry. We cast down doubt. We cast down fear. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants. It sees his will. We're going all the way. Just like in Revelations 19, it said, "Out of his mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword, right? Goeth a sharp sword." I say, "It's time the bride starts speaking." There ought to be a sharp sword going out of your mouth, casting down reasoning, casting down doubt, possessing the land, claiming your family. We'll work towards a close. Paragraph 189. Look, friends, faith sees what God wants. Faith sees his will. &gt;&gt; His will is that you are delivered. &gt;&gt; His will is that you are free. &gt;&gt; His will is that your family be saved. His will is that you have your faith. &gt;&gt; So then now faith will cast down anything contrary to that word. &gt;&gt; Right? Are we looking at what God's will is for your life? All right, as we work towards a close, paragraph 189, my you just can hardly you hardly work, you know, one paragraph, one sentence you could preach eternity on. He says, "Notice how beautiful. I love this." You know, finally Pharaoh said, "Get out." God just plagued him with the voice of Moses. He struck everything. He done everything there was to be done. He put the sun down in the middle of the day. He done everything else. He blackened the days. He brought frogs, fleas, life, &gt;&gt; everything else. Fire, smoke, and death to families, and everything else. He done everything till finally Pharaoh had to say, "Get out. Take all you got and go." Oh my. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; I think it's time as he said God plagued Moses of God plagued Pharaoh with Moses with thus sayeth the Lord. I say it's time the bride of Jesus Christ starts plaguing the devil with thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; I think it's time we start plaguing the devil and telling him look I am going in a rapture. I have an objective. It's time to plague him with the voice of Malachi 4:5. It is the rising of the sun. It is victory day. It wasn't so from the beginning. Who is this Melzdc? There's a man here that can turn on the light. It is Christ, the mystery of God revealed. I say it's time to start plaguing the devil with thus sayeth the Lord. I am going to be healed. I am going to be delivered. I am going to have that baby. I'm going to get my son. I'm going to get my daughter. I'm casting out worry. I'm casting out doubt. I'm claiming my family. I'm moving into my objective. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, praise his wonderful name. What does Mark 11:23 say? For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he hath shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Brother Brandham said that puts you back in the word. &gt;&gt; He wants to use your voice. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we're too fearful to speak. What happens if it don't come to pass? Well, what happens if it don't come to pass? It just means it is you speaking and not God. &gt;&gt; Try again. Don't be afraid of failure. &gt;&gt; Don't let fear look. Hey, I I've tried to work up things. I've tried to manufacture things. &gt;&gt; I wasn't doing it for the devil. I was doing it for God. But, you know, at least I was trying to do something for God. Some of us, we're so afraid to be identified with some fanatic that we won't even make an effort. &gt;&gt; Well, my I better not say a word. I better not shout. I better not doubt. You know, God forbid I be called a Pentecostal. Are you kidding me? That's the scarecrow. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I thought they're the imitator. But nowadays, if they were imitating us, we look like a bump on a pickle. &gt;&gt; Because we forgot our objective. &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words. I don't know about you, but I don't want to stay here. &gt;&gt; I don't like Lady Osia. &gt;&gt; I don't like the devils. I don't like the Tommy rot. I don't like the confusion. I don't like the darkness. But I love his word and I love his bride and I love feeding on the body word. Son of man, I love feeding on my objective. And my objective is body change. My objective is rapture. My objective is to cast down reason, cast down doubt. And one of these days, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, I'm going to be gone. &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words. I'm going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; You're going in a rapture. You're going in a rapture. You're going in a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got the lead role. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got the lead part. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't want to stay here. &gt;&gt; It's going all the time. &gt;&gt; You better start speaking. &gt;&gt; If you say you old bag of bones, yeah, you little old rascal Matthew McGary, you're defying the armies of the living God. Who me? Yeah, you. You're a little doubting and you're a little fussing. What? Yeah, you. Sometimes you got to have a real hard conversation with yourself. &gt;&gt; You're my worst enemy, you bag of bones. &gt;&gt; I know you don't feel like it, but we're going to serve God. &gt;&gt; We're going to church anyhow. &gt;&gt; I know I might lose my job, but I will be found in the house of God on a Wednesday night because I have an objective. Amen. &gt;&gt; Put God first. I challenge you in the name of the Lord. Take God out his word. &gt;&gt; God will be in debt to no man. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Oh Lord, we've forsaken all and followed you. &gt;&gt; You think if you sacrifice your job to go to church that God is going to be in debt to you? He's blessed me a million times over. &gt;&gt; I drove an hour and a half, three hours round trip every Wednesday and every Sunday for three years because there was something pulsating in me. Give me the word. And &gt;&gt; one time I got a blowout and then my spare blew out. I still made it there with about 10 15 minutes left of preaching. But there was a faith in my heart that said, "Everybody else move over &gt;&gt; cuz this 15 minutes is for me." &gt;&gt; I say if we start coming to the house of God with that kind of expectation, &gt;&gt; God will be in debt to no man. You won't lose your job and faith and God write you an I owe you. &gt;&gt; Brother David, appreciate you losing your job, man. I'm going to I have to catch you on the next one. It's like one time I was driving there on the road and I left this thing and I left that thing and I left another thing and and I finally got frustrated and I said out loud, "Give me a break." But you know, I forgot who was riding with me in the car. And the Lord said, "Haven't I already said,"Lord, I'm sorry. I'll be glad to turn around and go get my wallet that I left three times in a row and got something else. Give me a break. Haven't already." I saw my life and rewind. All the times he bailed me out. All of his mercy, all of his grace. Oh, he took me all the way back to Calvary where he nailed every thought, every sin, everything I ever done. He said, "It's paid. It's finished. It's thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness." And you're asking me to give you a break. I've given you the greatest break humanity could ever have. I said, "You're free. You never did it in the first place. You are justified." And then we we think that sacrificing something for God, we're he's going to be indebted to us. &gt;&gt; You really want to start seeing the spirit of God move in your life? Start putting his word first. &gt;&gt; Start putting his word in the way you dress. Start putting his word in the way you go to church. We we will we will have a real moving of the spirit where people are born again and filled with the Holy Ghost. Not just a one-time experience, but where you've met the Logos. And now you're like Moses with a stick in your hand going down to Egypt. Let my people go. &gt;&gt; There was nothing that can defeat Moses. And there's nothing that can defeat the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Mark 16:17. And these shines shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. That is not the words of a man. That is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if God anoints your faith and you are sick, I believe by a divine promise and a divine commission by almighty God that I can lay hands on you and you shall recover. &gt;&gt; Moses had had enough. I mean, apologize. Pharaoh had had enough, man. Moses, you are a fanatic. You ever been called a fanatic? Moses, I'm tired of you glorifying God. I'm tired of you speaking, thus sayeth the Lord. I'm tired of you quoting Malachi 4:5 every day. I'm tired of you listening to tapes almost every day. I'm tired of you possessing your vessel in sanctification and honor. I can't even get a word in because you keep speaking the word. Now we're talking about a real overcomer. Shut up, devil. I ain't got time because I'm listening to my bridegroom. &gt;&gt; You ever You ever have your kids come in and they're trying to tell you something? You're like, I'm talking here. They're trying to interrupt you. You're like, hey, I'm having a conversation here. Well, if it's your kid, you know, depends on if it's something important. But sometimes the devil's just trying to interrupt an important conversation that you're having with the Lord. And sometimes we say, "Lord, hold on a minute." Yeah, devil. Wow. Well, you know, the other day, uh, you looked at this and you looked at that, you know, and and Brother Brandham said this over here and and so, you know, you really don't got the Holy Ghost. Really? Yeah. And, uh, God, hold on. Um, the serpent's talking and I need to find out what he has to say because I need to make a decision that if what you said is true and what he said is true, and I need to determine if I'm good enough. I need to determine if I can go all the way. &gt;&gt; It was never about what you determined. God already predetermined the outcome before he spoke one star into existence. He said, "You're going all the way. You're taking your family with you." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have a halfway religion." &gt;&gt; He said, "We're going all the way." And we're all going. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh finally said, "Get out of here." The prophet of God said this in paragraph 19. He said, "I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God till the devil don't know what to do with him." That's right. Just obey God so completely till the devil says, "Oh my, get away. I don't want to hear it no more. I say this bride ought to raise up right now and start speaking the word. Speak and go forward that that devil say, "Oh my goodness, I don't want to hear anymore. I can't take it." You say, "I am an overcomer. I am victorious. I can do all things through Jesus Christ that strengthens me." Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. What can separate us from the love of God? shall famine, shall peril, shall sword, shall death. What can we say? Nay, in all these things, and the devil's over there going, "Get away. I don't want to hear it anymore." I say, "Maybe that's how the rapture is going to go when we start speaking the word of God and start claiming God and taking him out his word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name. Why cry? We haven't even gotten to why cry yet. Maybe we'll just lay a little in there so brother Billy can just pick up on it. Don't you love the spirit of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Why cry? Speak the word. I am going all the way. &gt;&gt; I am going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; I do have an objective. Brother Brandham said, "Everywhere those early believers went, they went preaching the gospel. They went preaching the word and God confirmed it with signs and wonders following. They cast out evil spirits. They cast out devils." He said, "And that power is here greater and stronger than it ever was in the true word bride. Oh, hallelujah. He said, "Hold on to that word and fill your mouth with it. Fill your mouth with it." Remember, faith sees. Look, we'll just be about five more minutes. Faith sees what God wants. It holds to the objective. Faith knows no fear. Faith knows no defeat. Faith brings things where there's nothing to be brought. I love that quote. Faith brings things where there's nothing to be brought. That means in the in and where where where there is no possibility, God makes it possible. And in this message, Brother Brandham is showing how in everything we've been fellowshipping on, how Moses had been called and he had been elected and he had been chosen and he met the pillar of fire and now God commissioned him, right? And now he's proved by signs and wonders and vindication and has brought them out of Egypt by a strong and mighty hand. And now they come to the Red Sea and he says, "And Moses starts crying, what must I do?" &gt;&gt; And now what he's starting to do is show us. He says, "Even me." He's showing us with all the signs and all the vindication this great message that we've received. We've come out by a mighty hand out of Lady Osia. We've come out of denominations. We've seen the pillar of fire. He's had his picture taken. He He opened the seals. And what was in those seals? There were names in there. And he called your name and he showed you who you are and he said, "I got an objective for you. It's body change. We're going in a rapture." And then we come up to a little trial. Oh Lord, what am I going to do? Are you hearing the prophet? &gt;&gt; That's he's he's showing us that's how we become with all the evidence, with all the signs, with all the revelation. Then when the little trial comes up, we start to cry. when the Red Sea should have just been chocked up. Like, man, I don't know how he's going to do it, but this is going to be awesome. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like, he brought us out of the strongest army that was ever in the land. &gt;&gt; And now there's a puddle of water in front of us. Lord, how you going to do it? Well, I've ordained you. I've called you. I've elected you. You're in the line of duty. There it is right there. Uh, we'll try to settle around these lines. Saints, we got to be in the line of duty. &gt;&gt; Your line of duty is rapture. &gt;&gt; Remember, that's the objective. We're going all the way. So then if something gets in the way of your line of duty, you can speak the word and go forward. And he starts to show how Moses started to cry out to God and he was looking for something that had already been given to him. God had already told him the Egyptians today you will see them no longer. God had already given him thus sayeth the Lord. And he's over crying and wondering what must he do? I say, "Is the prophet not trying to tell us the bride of Jesus Christ? I've already given you thus sayeth the Lord. I've already showed you that you're going in a rapture. I already showed you where you were in my mind before the foundation of the world. I've already showed you that I slipped the wedding band of predestination on you." I I tell you, you you have to listen all the way to 65 and come back and listen to this so you can even begin to start to understand it. He said, "Haven't I done all these things?" and you're crying and wondering. &gt;&gt; Speak. &gt;&gt; Let's go forward to the objective. Now, maybe we'll end on this quote. He says, "Oh my, I got to fellowship with brother Billy." I'll let him pick it up. But, but uh Brother Brandham says uh I I like this. We are just having a good time back there cuz uh brother brother Brandham says that God said to Moses, "Moses, I've already put you on the journey. I'm going to go rest." And I was thinking, I'm like, that was just like it was in the beginning. God formed his masterpiece. And now he had his masterpiece family on the earth and he said, "I'm going to go rest Adam. It's in your hands." &gt;&gt; Because why? What is he showing us here? God has brought us out. He set us on the journey. This is the hour of adoption. This is the hour of manifestation of sons and daughters of God with full authority and power and dominion over the earth again. Why can I say that? Because I already saw a sheath wave &gt;&gt; stand on the earth and tell the storm to go back to where it came from. &gt;&gt; That's where he ends up. He's saying it was he in me &gt;&gt; speaking squirrels bringing the dead off the floor. &gt;&gt; He's showing that's where we are now. &gt;&gt; Friends, now is your adoption. It's not something that has to come in the future. Stop looking for something to come and recognize what's already here. &gt;&gt; He's here &gt;&gt; to take you into every promise. &gt;&gt; Well, how am I going to do it? As you come to it, &gt;&gt; if this is the hour of adoption, it's time to be adopted. Well, brother Matthew, I thought I thought that that was the change of our That's the final of it. &gt;&gt; But you got to get adopted before that happens. &gt;&gt; You see, we're always trying to put something off in the future. &gt;&gt; But he's saying, Moses, I got I'm going to go rest. You take You know what my mind is? You know where I told you where you're going. Are you hearing them? He's telling you, "I've already given you my mind. I've already given you my word. You are my adopted sons and daughters of God. You are my bride. You are bone of my bone." You just speak the word and go forward. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Quit fussing and crying. &gt;&gt; Lord, should I have this? Lord, should I quit my job so I can go to church on Wednesday? There ain't no fear in faith. Cuz if it's genuine faith, &gt;&gt; you won't even have to think twice about it. &gt;&gt; Look, I ain't telling you to quit your job. Because you know what you're going to do if you quit your job without faith? You're going to be jobless with no faith. &gt;&gt; That's not a good place to be. But if you got faith, &gt;&gt; my God will not be indebted to no man. &gt;&gt; But we're scared of Pharaoh. We're scared of Lady Oia. We're scared of losing our house. We're scared of losing our car. It's all going to burn anyways. That's not your objective. &gt;&gt; Your objective is glory. &gt;&gt; Your objective is rapture. Here comes Pharaoh. What must I do? What must I do? See, isn't that just human beings begin to cry? What must I do? Here we see Moses expressing fully human nature. Always wants God to get behind you and push you into something. Lord, should I do this? Should I do that, Lord? Give me a sign, Lord. Should I be in church on Wednesday? Close the door. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry. That's just where little Matthew McI can relate. I I you know, I I those things are like I needed simple things like, "Okay, Lord. Yes, I can't. I I'll I'll take you at your word." Now, that's us today. You want God after all we've seen, yet you want God to push you to do something. See, yeah, Moses had just laxed around. Well, if Moses could lax around a little bit, Lord, forgive me. I've laxed around. I've gotten lazy. I've gotten soft. The pews maybe are too soft. The church is too wide and it's too cool and it's too nice that I just show up and say, "Bless me. I ain't got to fight for nothing. I just want Brother Billy to push me into worship. I want Brother David to push me into a good sermon and push me out the door and push me back to my job and then the choils of my job push me back in church and I'm just on a good old push around." &gt;&gt; That ain't an adopted son of God. That ain't a man knowing his position. &gt;&gt; He said Moses just latched around God. I'll ask you see what you say. Yeah. But here God had ordained him for the job. &gt;&gt; Proved that he was with him. Now put your name in here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me read it like this if you'll just allow me. God has ordained you for the job. &gt;&gt; Proved that he is with you. and here he is and this circumstance has come up in your life and you're crying about it. What can I do? Lord, what can I do? &gt;&gt; And many times that's exactly what we're doing. We're looking for an answer or looking for something that God has already given us. &gt;&gt; Remember, faith sees what God wants. The scripture says, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above. Where Christ siteth on the right hand of God, set your affections on things above, not on things of earth, your affection singular, not your affections." Your affection singular. Set your mind. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. Now, I keep saying this, but we'll just At least the musicians aren't sitting there. So, I' I've I've improved. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hallelujah. But remember, he said Moses already prophesied the Egyptians you see today, you will see them no more. And he says, and immediately he begins crying. &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture, Brother Billy. Our objective is glory. Hallelujah. We're all going, "Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, wait. &gt;&gt; I'm sick. Oh, my my job's shutting down. Oh, my family members. You mean I can't have that girl that I I loved? You mean Oh, you you mean I the Lord's dealing with my heart and I I got to move and uh Well, what am I going to do? Are you kidding me? I thought you just Did you forget? And that's exactly what God, brother Brandham said, Moses did. Moses forgot. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just need to be reminded. &gt;&gt; He said he immediately began to cry, Lord, what can I do? And brother Brandon said, God must have just got fed up with it. He said, God must have just finally got fed up. Why do you keep crying to me? Why do you keep coming to me, Lord? What must I do? Should I do this and should I do that? He said, he said he finally just got fed up. up. He said, "What are you crying to me about? Haven't I already identified that I'm among you? Haven't I already proved to you that I'm with you?" And he said in paragraph 2:30, he says, "What are you crying to me about? What are you looking at me for? What are you calling I be? Haven't I proved it to the people? Haven't I proved it to you? Haven't I called you? Isn't it the scripture? Didn't I promise to take this people to that land? Didn't I call you and tell you I would do it? Didn't I call and say I had sent you to do it? Put yourself in there. That it wasn't you. &gt;&gt; It was me. And I'd go down and be with your lips and whatever you said, I'd vindicate it and prove it. Haven't I done it? the musicians would come. Haven't I done it? Haven't I called you out of Lady Osia? &gt;&gt; Have I not shown you that I wrote your name in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world? Haven't I shown you that I nailed every sin and every fault and every failure to the cross and I put it in the sea of God's forgetfulness? I was wondering if we could we could sing that song. Um let me just see here real quick. I wanted to sing that song. Uh uh we believe I I believe we've sang that before. Uh they say this mountain can't be moved. We familiar with that? Maybe as we move into that, Billy, you can help me with that. But haven't I done it? I'm Let me just make it personal. Brother Ben, has he not done it? Has he not showed you that your name's on the Lamb Book of Life? &gt;&gt; Has he not shown you you're going in a rapture? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then what are you crying to me for? &gt;&gt; Has God not already told you you're going in a rapture? &gt;&gt; Has he not already showed you you're going in a body change? What are you crying to me about it? &gt;&gt; You're the elected, ordained bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's go forward into the objective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then when any little thing comes up, we act like a baby." when you ought to be a man. Speak to the people. Amen. Then move forward. There you are. Don't cry. Speak. &gt;&gt; What are you crying to me about? Just speak the word. Just speak to the people and go forward to your objective. Whatever it is, if it's sickness or whatever it is to raise the dead or whatever it is, &gt;&gt; speak. I've proved it. Speak to the people. What a lesson. What a lesson. Oh my. At this stage of the journey, where we are standing, look where we are at now. Yes, sir. At the third pool. Oh, can you feel the pool of the rapture? We're right here at the door of the coming of the Lord. He was anointed for the job and still waiting for thus sayeth the Lord. And I find what the prophet is telling me. Son, I've anointed you for the job. I've called you. I have elected you. I have equipped you. I have filled you. You don't have to cry to me and wonder, can I have my health? Can I have this? or or or can I have my family? Can can can I uh put the word first? No. That's my objective. Now, the question is, are we going to take God at his word and make his word our objective? Because I wonder if what we've actually had happen is Lady Oia we've allowed to become distracted to where God by divine promise has given us a message and shown us our objective where we come from where we're going and has given us his mind. But yet then Satan tries to come in and offer some reasoning and offer a little different objective. And then that's where the confusion comes in. Let's all stand. [Music] 239. Speak to the people and let's go forward. Amen. We've got an objective. That's glory. Let's move into it. We're headed to the promised land. All things are possible to them that believe. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All things &gt;&gt; are possible. &gt;&gt; I believe I am standing in front of the spoken word of almighty God. [Music] I believe the mighty angel of Revelations 10 1-7 has descended with a shout. And by the spoken word of God, you have come into manifestation and are that invincible army standing on the earth right now. Now, if we are who he said we are, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Well, how are we going to do it, Matt? Brother Matt, h how am I going to overcome? How am I going to be healed? How am I going to go in a rapture? as you come to it. Look, if if you're sick and you have a need, if you need to be delivered, we can pray for you. And I believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you'll be healed and you will be delivered because by faith, I'm looking at the objective that that's the part you you see, brothers, that's the part God's giving you to play. that we could lay hands, sisters, that's the part you've been given to play, to lay hands on the sick and they recover, to cast down reason, to cast out unbelief. So I say as as the word has gone forth, let's speak the word. Let's have faith in the objective. Let's have faith. Brother Brandham goes on. Oh, you can start going on into Samson. He says he used his anointed gift of faith. He talks about David. He said David had faith in his anointing. Sometimes we just forget. But I say this ought to be a time of remembrance. Oh yes, Lord. What? I have been crying, brother Billy. I've been over here crying and wondering when God's already given me a vindicated message to tell me to speak the word and go forward. I say, "Let's see some mighty miracles this morning." As we just sing this song in worship, if you need prayer, we'd be happy to pray with you. Let's just worship the Lord. Brother Billy, help me with this song. [Music] This one will break. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, by they don't know you like we do. Oh, there is power in your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
