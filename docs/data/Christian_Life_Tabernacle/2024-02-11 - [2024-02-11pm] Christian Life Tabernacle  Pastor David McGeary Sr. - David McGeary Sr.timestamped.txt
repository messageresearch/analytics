[13:24] hallelujah amen every day that goes by
[13:27] amen there's that expectation
[13:29] amen for that soon coming time amen I
[13:32] know brother Jerome had is special if he
[13:34] could come at this
[13:52] time real quick
[13:55] testimony uh coming up next week is
[13:58] going to be my birthday birthday and uh
[14:01] I'm turning
[14:02] 64 and Clayton the Lord Clayton don't
[14:05] live that long so it's really a major
[14:08] accomplishment for the family um but a
[14:13] real quick testimony I just wanted to
[14:14] thank God for his goodness and and for
[14:17] his Mercy
[14:20] um um I was thinking today um how I
[14:25] ended up playing this instrument and in
[14:27] a real quick testimony I was in
[14:29] kindergarten and all the kids we were we
[14:31] were lined up around the wall and uh uh
[14:35] the teacher came out and she had all
[14:36] these instruments in a sack and she was
[14:39] passing them out and and so I could see
[14:43] a instrument that looked like this so I
[14:46] that's what I wanted so when she got to
[14:48] me I reached for it and she said no and
[14:51] she gave me a drum and I don't have any
[14:55] rhythm you know uh in the world when I
[14:58] was in the world call myself I dance
[15:00] like George Jefferson for some of you
[15:02] who might so I have no rhythm at all so
[15:06] anyway uh that's I guess that's why I
[15:08] became a message believer you know you
[15:10] can't dance so
[15:12] anyway
[15:14] um so that bothered me all of my life so
[15:17] when I turned 40 I look back over my
[15:20] life and I realized the things that I
[15:22] hadn't
[15:23] accomplished and I reached for that
[15:25] instrument and the lady wouldn't give it
[15:26] to me so at 40
[15:29] uh I went down to the music store and I
[15:32] told the guy and behind the counter I
[15:34] wanted to buy this he said well do you
[15:38] play I said no he said you want to buy
[15:41] this I said yeah I want to buy that
[15:43] that's what I want to play and you know
[15:46] he wanted to make his commission so he
[15:48] sold it to me and uh so I took it home
[15:51] and uh with no Talent no ability and it
[15:55] sounded like somebody killing a
[15:57] cat
[15:59] um I wish I was like brother John I told
[16:02] him the first time I met him see when we
[16:04] were standing in line to meet God he got
[16:06] my voice and all of my talent
[16:09] uh but uh I sound like a seventh grade
[16:12] girl and I play like a seventh grade
[16:13] girl but uh I brought it home and I kept
[16:18] blowing it and blowing it and finally I
[16:19] got some sound to come out of it and and
[16:22] so but anyway to me this is a major
[16:26] accomplishment for me to finally reach
[16:28] out and get that instrument that the
[16:30] lady wouldn't give to me so uh but
[16:33] anyway I'm going to attempt by the mercy
[16:35] of God to play uh all of creation and
[16:38] it's by a group called Mercy Me It's TR

[28:47] tonight and we just ask you to bless our
[28:49] time of
[28:50] Fellowship together may we be encouraged
[28:53] father may we come to the faith that you
[28:56] provided for us father the revelation of
[29:00] what great part we play and what our
[29:03] position is we just ask that you'd Lift
[29:06] us up tonight in Jesus precious name we
[29:10] pray
[29:12] amen amen amen let's read our scripture
[29:15] in Romans tonight we won't be long we
[29:18] had a little more of a lengthy service
[29:20] this morning but
[29:22] um we just we we felt there was a few
[29:25] things that we wanted to make sure we
[29:29] understood and and so in Romans the uh
[29:33] uh uh 12th chapter we've read this uh
[29:38] verse it says I beseech ye therefore
[29:41] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[29:46] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[29:49] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[29:53] your reasonable service and be not
[29:56] conformed to this world but ye be ye
[30:01] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[30:05] that ye may prove what is that good and
[30:11] acceptable and perfect will of God
[30:14] father bless your word in your name we
[30:16] pray amen you may be
[30:19] seated and we know that the the word
[30:23] means uh transformed meanss to be made
[30:28] different to be made different and so we
[30:31] see a great secret here is if we can uh
[30:37] renew our mind or if I could use a word
[30:42] change the way that we think we can come
[30:45] to find out what the perfect and
[30:48] acceptable will of God is and I think
[30:51] that's what we all want no matter what
[30:53] our difficulties are we want to be in
[30:56] God's will there's just a part of us
[30:59] that uh we want to do what's right uh we
[31:03] know that there's a heaven to shun and a
[31:07] heaven to gain and too many times our
[31:11] thinking is I just don't want to go to
[31:13] hell but God's got more of that than
[31:17] that for us and so we want to pick up uh
[31:21] where we left off this morning and and
[31:25] uh just follow along I hope in this next
[31:28] few minutes you can uh
[31:32] uh understand what it is that we're
[31:36] talking about if faith I believe there
[31:40] was kind of an old type of faith that we
[31:45] had to have in days gone by and it it
[31:49] was more of a hope so or of a hanging on
[31:54] to you know I believe God can I believe
[31:57] God can I believe God will and and if I
[32:02] could say that that was sort of the only
[32:05] Faith uh that we could have but when the
[32:10] time came of a
[32:11] restoration of faith and a Ministry to
[32:15] restore back the Faith of Our Fathers we
[32:18] begin to see that there was a a a a
[32:22] greater understanding of faith and that
[32:25] Faith was a revelation amen and it was
[32:28] not something that you were hoping for
[32:30] but it was actually a substance that you
[32:35] could lay hold of and have and our
[32:38] Prophet would would would give
[32:40] testimonies and and and make Faith so
[32:44] real to us that we could almost feel
[32:47] like we could reach out and grab it and
[32:49] take hold of it how many times when you
[32:52] would sit back and listen to a prayer
[32:54] line or listen to a discernment and it
[32:57] would just feel like he was actually
[32:59] Discerning you or he would mention the
[33:02] very uh problem that that you had and
[33:05] you could actually feel his presence
[33:09] right there with you like like he was
[33:11] standing in the room and I believe he
[33:14] was and and he would touch you and and
[33:18] and you would become well and and it was
[33:21] a a a wonderful uh uh just
[33:25] uplifting of his spirit and so there's
[33:29] and so our faith if I could say this is
[33:33] is in not so much in the promises
[33:37] haven't changed but it's our approach to
[33:41] those promises why there are promises
[33:44] not just because they're what that we
[33:47] have need of but actually those promises
[33:51] are what we
[33:52] are and and as we read this morning we
[33:56] begin to to to have uh uh we heard some
[34:00] very tremendous statements and one of
[34:03] the things that we heard was what what
[34:06] the seed of life was what the seed of
[34:09] life was was the word of God so the word
[34:12] of God's what produced life and then we
[34:15] went on and and we realized it said here
[34:20] that I believe the Bible is the word the
[34:23] whole truth and Jesus is the word made
[34:28] manifest and his word is one and the
[34:34] same so his word he and his word are one
[34:39] in the same another Jesus wasn't
[34:42] preaching something and living something
[34:44] else he preached what he was so the
[34:48] things that Jesus preached was what he
[34:52] was when he said turn the other cheek we
[34:55] saw him that's exactly what he did he
[34:58] had 10,000 angels He could have called
[35:00] down and delivered them from the cross
[35:03] but but he if I could say that he turned
[35:06] the other cheek for for our sake and and
[35:10] so we we we we looked at that and we
[35:13] said and he and his word is one and the
[35:16] same and what was he now look he
[35:23] was that seed and remember the the seed
[35:28] is what to bring forth of its own kind
[35:31] so he was the
[35:35] one that was going to bring forth of his
[35:39] own kind so that that's what that's what
[35:43] he comes for now he's the kinsman
[35:46] redeemer he's coming back to do one
[35:49] thing and and that is he's coming back
[35:53] so now he can reproduce the seed he is
[35:58] the what the Original Seed he was what
[36:02] God originally was going to plan right
[36:06] and remember we we read this great
[36:09] statement uh here that he was that seed
[36:14] that Eve should have produced do you get
[36:19] it so okay so so now he's he's here Eve
[36:24] would have produced it but now he find
[36:26] of Virgin Mary in a type to be a carrier
[36:31] and so and so Eve would have produced it
[36:34] so if Eve would have produced
[36:39] him she would have and that her
[36:43] offspring would have produced
[36:47] you right okay well you're trying to I I
[36:51] really believe the prophet of God's
[36:52] trying to bring us all to something that
[36:56] if Jesus was that seed that she would
[36:59] have produced and if that seed's in you
[37:02] then you would have been produced
[37:05] also so you can you can because we were
[37:08] in him at Calvary right we were in him
[37:12] to beginning the bride is part of him we
[37:15] are the word of God we've heard all
[37:17] those things but now I believe we're
[37:20] coming to a time where they're coming
[37:22] together to give us a faith that's
[37:25] greater than we've ever had before a
[37:28] rapturing faith cuz we're certainly
[37:30] going to need this he said he was the
[37:33] seed that he would have produ would have
[37:36] produced do you get
[37:38] it he was the seed that Eve was to
[37:44] produce but she hybrid it by
[37:48] disbelieving God's word and when she
[37:51] hybrid it she she died right because man
[37:55] wasn't meant to die
[37:58] die man was meant to live now this is
[38:01] the part that I just want to touch on a
[38:03] little bit this evening he was that seed
[38:08] and the only way that life could be in
[38:13] in reproduction of life the life had to
[38:17] come through the seed
[38:20] so in other words if I could say this
[38:24] God was interested in
[38:27] reproduction that was what he planned
[38:29] all from the beginning that everything
[38:32] would come forth of its kind so and he
[38:35] told Adam and Eve to to go and and and
[38:40] and plenish and and and reproduce and
[38:43] and fill the Earth that's what he told
[38:45] her to do so so that was God's plan in
[38:49] the beginning but once it got
[38:52] hybrid and it and the plan went and
[38:56] death came came in something had to come
[38:59] along right and and put the plan back on
[39:05] course and and so I I just want to read
[39:08] these statements so I can get to the
[39:10] point so life had to come
[39:12] through the seed so the reproduction
[39:16] life the life that Eve would have
[39:19] produced we had lost
[39:21] that so now he's coming to restore that
[39:25] life back and remember that's what he
[39:28] said right he said that he had to go to
[39:30] Calvary and die that that life might
[39:34] come back over and bring the seeds that
[39:37] were to come back to life and and and so
[39:42] he said and Jesus had to be broken open
[39:47] in order for that
[39:49] seed uh to let forth its life to water
[39:53] other seeds that was to come
[39:56] so that's that's been God's Great
[40:00] purpose is to uh uh germinate that seed
[40:05] now he could have he never could do it
[40:08] uh under the condition that everybody
[40:12] was in so another word
[40:15] um I don't I want to go fast but I don't
[40:18] want to go too fast he said he
[40:21] says he told Eve he said I'll give you a
[40:25] seed to The Serpent and the serpent had
[40:30] already defiled her he said but thy seed
[40:35] that I will give you shall
[40:38] bruise his head I'll take that thing
[40:44] back
[40:45] again amen I just
[40:50] wish everybody could see that see I've
[40:54] come to conquer and correct what evees
[41:00] done only way I can do it is through a
[41:04] woman
[41:06] that believed the seed where a a woman
[41:12] didn't believe the seed a woman believed
[41:16] the word where one didn't believe it so
[41:19] the only way he can reproduce is to have
[41:22] a woman right a bride something that he
[41:27] can reproduce the Sons and Daughters of
[41:31] of of of God again so that's what his
[41:35] his his goal is because remember he
[41:38] already had your names written on the
[41:40] Lamb's Book of Life you were already in
[41:43] his thinking before the foundation of
[41:46] the world if you were ever saved you
[41:49] were always saved if you had eternal
[41:51] life you always had eternal life but you
[41:54] didn't know it
[41:57] you know you didn't know it this is the
[41:59] age that he wants us to know who we are
[42:03] he want in other words we have this
[42:06] negative thinking if I could just as
[42:10] brother BR said I wish I could just get
[42:12] that across to people that he's come to
[42:15] conquer and to correct what Eve done so
[42:19] when we come down through Eve what were
[42:21] we we're Sinners we're lost we better
[42:25] get saved
[42:26] if we we don't get saved then then oh
[42:29] we're we're just doomed you know and and
[42:33] and everything's kind of from a a
[42:36] negative uh a standpoint you know and
[42:39] and
[42:41] uh
[42:43] but Satan provided churches for
[42:47] that a whole church world oh you just
[42:49] need to get saved you need to get saved
[42:53] you need to get saved you need to repent
[42:55] of your sin you need to do good you know
[42:58] what I mean you you better repent but he
[43:01] don't want any more Sons and Daughters
[43:03] of
[43:05] God he couldn't handle the last one you
[43:09] know what I mean but that's what the
[43:10] scripture said in John uh uh what is it
[43:14] 3:12 he said as many as believed on him
[43:17] he gave power to become the Sons and
[43:20] Daughters of God so he's got churches
[43:23] out there that'll that'll he he's got
[43:26] hundreds of them all over he gave man
[43:29] religion but he doesn't give them a
[43:31] religion that'll transform them to what
[43:36] that they really are to make them
[43:38] different and there that they don't they
[43:41] just continue to remain in
[43:45] sin and what is sin it's unbelief that's
[43:49] right they don't really believe what
[43:50] he's done they don't really believe what
[43:53] he said and so when a message came which
[43:56] was the pure word of God to bring us
[44:00] back to the revelation of who we were
[44:04] and what the plan of God was so when he
[44:06] opened the seals the whole mystery was
[44:09] made clear and the first part of that
[44:12] mystery was the kinsman
[44:15] redeemer he didn't come to P make pigs
[44:21] Lambs he came to let you know that you
[44:24] were a lamb to begin
[44:29] you know he come to take you out of the
[44:32] pig pen and put you in the pastors of
[44:36] his word so it it it wasn't a a
[44:41] transformation uh making you from one
[44:45] species to a different species he just
[44:48] wanted you to bring you to the
[44:50] realization of what you really
[44:53] are what a different way of thinking
[44:57] what a
[44:58] transformation So you you're not always
[45:00] saying oh I'm no good I'm a sinner you
[45:03] know I I just need repentance I hope I
[45:06] make it to Heaven uh you know one day
[45:09] I'm going to try to do as many good
[45:10] works as I can because so when I come
[45:13] into the Judgment uh he'll look at me
[45:16] and he'll say oh you're a
[45:18] Believer no he don't look at you that
[45:22] way now that's right he looks at you as
[45:26] his
[45:28] children you're his daughters you're his
[45:32] sons you always were his daughters and
[45:35] sons your name was always on his Lamb's
[45:38] Book of Life but what what you know he
[45:42] said so he wants us to come he says
[45:46] wants us to believe that we could say
[45:48] I'm the seed of God Satan has no right
[45:52] to put these things on me I'm going
[45:55] going to drive him out the the squatter
[45:58] I'm going to get him off my land that's
[46:00] the kind of attitude that he wants us to
[46:03] have not oh I'm a sinner and and you
[46:06] know and that's that's how the ministry
[46:09] holds fear over the people always a
[46:12] threat that boy you disobey or you miss
[46:15] church you're going to hell you can miss
[46:17] church every day of your life all you're
[46:19] going to do is be
[46:22] miserable you're not going to have any
[46:24] Fellowship you're going to be battled
[46:26] all in the world but if your name's on
[46:29] the Lamb's Book of Life you'll be there
[46:31] now you might not have no
[46:33] reward you know what I mean but but all
[46:38] kinds of ways to make you feel that you
[46:41] better uh uh you better not miss it and
[46:46] and and you better obey and you better
[46:49] submit and and you better be there and
[46:52] where were you Tuesday night where were
[46:54] you this day what's wrong with you and
[46:57] all that fear as if your salvation's in
[46:59] the
[47:01] balance well that's no way to
[47:05] live you know that ain't Victorious
[47:08] living in fact we're we're told not to
[47:12] even have a negative
[47:14] thought but but to be positive to be to
[47:18] be to know that we're Sons and Daughters
[47:20] of God even to the point that we rejoice
[47:24] in chastisement
[47:27] thank you for correcting me Lord thank
[47:29] you for putting me on the right path
[47:32] thank you Father for dealing with me as
[47:35] a son and and not as an illegitimate
[47:39] born child uh you know we uh that's the
[47:44] appreciation that we we we want to have
[47:47] we don't want to we don't want to have
[47:49] such a a negative uh uh viewpoint but we
[47:53] want to understand that he he has come
[47:57] to
[48:00] reproduce to to to have his offspring to
[48:05] have his seed the seed that was there
[48:09] originally took a different route they
[48:13] entered into a marriage a hybrid
[48:16] marriage and they had another ruler over
[48:20] them the husband of
[48:23] sin and so now the the Sons and
[48:26] Daughters of God they found themselves
[48:28] in the world in the
[48:31] flesh with highbrid
[48:34] characteristics death all around us all
[48:37] of us came
[48:39] hybrid he said but now he's come back
[48:43] to take us back to
[48:47] correct what Eve had done and to take it
[48:52] back
[48:54] again amen what's he doing he's taking
[48:58] us back to Eden back to the beginning
[49:02] back to where we were as Sons and
[49:05] Daughters of God he can only do that he
[49:08] can only have done that when he finally
[49:10] got a bride somebody that heck that his
[49:14] seed was
[49:17] in oh yeah oh it's beautiful when we can
[49:21] when we can understand this that we're
[49:23] not here struggling Ling and trying to
[49:27] live right to get
[49:30] saved we're here claiming back our
[49:34] inheritance cuz we're join AES with him
[49:37] we're coming back to get restored back
[49:40] to us the Faith of Our Fathers restored
[49:43] back to us what our commission is what
[49:46] our inheritance is everything that he
[49:48] was I love that statement that he made
[49:52] everything that Adam lost Jesus
[49:58] was so he was what every Sons and
[50:02] Daughters would be what he possessed
[50:06] every son and daughter of God would
[50:10] possess so what he had is our what
[50:15] inheritance we're joint HS with him
[50:19] sitting in Heavenly places and as long
[50:22] as you keep looking at your flesh
[50:27] that's from the other
[50:31] Union that's what was borned in sin and
[50:35] shaped in iniquity now he has a
[50:39] spirit that's going to kill that
[50:43] man or break that marriage and that
[50:47] person's going to die the hybrid
[50:50] person's going to die why are they going
[50:54] is it going to die cuz the word of God
[50:57] is going to come to life cuz the germ
[51:01] seed he he paid the price for what Eve
[51:06] done now he's comes back with his Spirit
[51:10] to water that word to bring it to life
[51:13] the first Adam was what a living
[51:16] soul and if Eve had a f Fallen that
[51:20] living Soul would have continued to go
[51:22] on to produce Sons and Daughters of
[51:26] God but she hybrid it and when she
[51:29] hybrid it death came and now when we
[51:33] came into the world the seed that was in
[51:35] US came into the world it came into the
[51:38] world in a dying body right is that
[51:42] right something that was swn in
[51:45] corruption and in unbelief now the only
[51:48] thing that could transform that was the
[51:52] word yes
[51:54] sir and and so he came not just to
[51:59] preach at us but we're we were his
[52:03] Kinsmen so he came back paid the price
[52:07] so now he can continue the
[52:11] reproduction cycle that would have came
[52:15] through Eve in the
[52:18] beginning is to do what to bring Sons
[52:22] and Daughters of God back into
[52:27] existence to have them come out of the
[52:30] hbrd out of the bondage out of the
[52:33] obedience to the Flesh and to become
[52:38] Overcomers Hallelujah to him that is
[52:41] given to
[52:43] overcome amen I will suck with them I
[52:47] will share with them the evening
[52:49] Revelation so let let's just read these
[52:52] last uh uh a few
[52:56] great statements that the prophet of God
[52:59] said he said I've come to conquer and to
[53:04] and to uh he says I'll give you a seed
[53:08] and she'll bruise the head he'll take
[53:12] that thing back again so first of all
[53:15] he's come to take you
[53:18] back thank you Lord back to the
[53:22] word back to being sons and daughters of
[53:25] God back to having victory over this
[53:29] flesh that he's going to transform you
[53:33] from all this weakness that we are he's
[53:37] going to make us
[53:39] different and as many has Believe on him
[53:43] and received him he gave them power to
[53:46] become the Sons and Daughters of
[53:50] God he says and the only way I can do
[53:53] that is through a woman
[53:55] and that believes the seed where a woman
[53:59] didn't believe the seed a woman believe
[54:03] the word where one did not believe it
[54:07] what a beautiful uh uh expression of
[54:11] Mary and what she was a type of and as
[54:16] we go on and just read a little more he
[54:19] says he says all of God's Sons must be
[54:23] the same
[54:26] amen yes sir to be born of the word and
[54:31] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[54:36] again like in John 3 see to be born of
[54:42] water and spirit what does it do then it
[54:47] brings you right back
[54:49] again unto the place of where you should
[54:55] would have been at the
[54:59] beginning oh my what a
[55:03] wonderful thing that's going on to so
[55:06] we're not sitting here believing that we
[55:09] make
[55:10] it and oh I'm hoping I make the Rapture
[55:15] I I'm hoping uh that when I get there he
[55:19] judges me uh worthy you know what I mean
[55:23] no he's going to take care of it for
[55:25] there he's going to give you the same
[55:28] spirit that raised him from the dead and
[55:31] it's going to Quicken your mortal body
[55:34] also
[55:36] Hallelujah going to give you that spirit
[55:39] that he
[55:41] had he's going to bring you back to what
[55:44] you were in the beginning so now you're
[55:47] an owner and a possessor of the eternal
[55:50] life you always had so what are you're
[55:53] going you always had it
[55:56] but he's going to Quicken it to you he's
[55:59] going to make it alive in you because
[56:02] it's in the
[56:05] seed but he's The
[56:08] Germ of the seed he's the
[56:13] germinator Satan's the Terminator Jesus
[56:16] is the
[56:19] germinator I like that I just come to me
[56:22] I couldn't resist
[56:23] it
[56:25] all those other preachers can pull those
[56:27] things off and I don't ever get one but
[56:31] but I like it he's the
[56:34] lifegiver Satan's the deathgivers the
[56:37] wages of unbelief is what
[56:40] death the wages of sin is death the gift
[56:44] of God is eternal life through Christ
[56:48] Jesus in other words you're going to get
[56:51] it from him amen amen
[56:55] that's what he's going to give you amen
[56:58] so if Satan will he built all his
[57:01] churches to stop you short of that oh
[57:05] you
[57:07] believe that you're a sinner confess
[57:09] you're a sinner and and and confess the
[57:12] Lord and you shall be
[57:14] saved that's that's so
[57:19] future you you're you're clinging to a
[57:21] hope
[57:23] so St what he wanted to do he wanted to
[57:29] reproduce
[57:33] himself he wanted sons and daughters
[57:37] like
[57:40] himself that's what he wants and and he
[57:43] gave us something that will do that he
[57:47] gave us the pure
[57:49] unadulterated word of God that's what
[57:52] the word will do for us it will
[57:54] transform us change us into the image of
[57:59] his only begotten son look we're not if
[58:04] we can make that
[58:06] transformation Resurrection is
[58:11] automatic
[58:13] right death does not have any victory
[58:16] over you where's your sting where's your
[58:20] Victory I've ran the race I fought the
[58:22] fight I await the crown that awaits for
[58:25] me it doesn't matter you know some by
[58:28] the fire some by the you know uh one way
[58:31] there but it's all through the
[58:34] blood and so we we we we see that right
[58:37] now and this is what he's saying that we
[58:40] should
[58:43] have to to bring you back to the place
[58:47] where you were should have been at the
[58:49] beginning see that's the reason Christ's
[58:52] death brings us right back again where
[58:57] sons of
[59:01] God now we're now we're achieving
[59:04] something totally different now we're
[59:07] understanding wait a minute this this
[59:10] message wasn't just about correcting
[59:15] Doctrine this message doesn't wasn't
[59:18] about educating us to the
[59:22] Mysteries this message
[59:25] was about
[59:28] resurrection and
[59:31] reproduction and and now having a
[59:34] word that would produce and bring forth
[59:39] the
[59:40] seed but in order to make that
[59:42] transformation we have to renew our
[59:45] minds by the washing of the water of the
[59:48] word we have to get every other thinking
[59:50] out we have to get our own thinking out
[59:53] we have to get our own fear out we we've
[59:56] got to totally come back to this
[59:58] subjection of the word of God where we
[1:00:00] believe it's exactly what he
[1:00:03] said oh and it begins to make things it
[1:00:07] begins to make things so
[1:00:11] wonderful if Eve would have brought
[1:00:14] forth that child she would
[1:00:18] have finally done
[1:00:20] it did not God tell her multiply and
[1:00:25] replenish the
[1:00:27] Earth that was her
[1:00:30] purpose now there's a second
[1:00:34] Eve right an elected bride he's went
[1:00:38] through all these ages to get you
[1:00:42] here because he predestinated you to
[1:00:45] receive that
[1:00:47] word because he knew when you receive
[1:00:50] that word it would turn you and
[1:00:54] transform form you into the sons and
[1:00:57] daughters that you were in the
[1:01:00] beginning Satan says you
[1:01:04] can't he don't want any more Sons and
[1:01:07] Daughters of God he wants to discredit
[1:01:10] the word he wants to discredit you all
[1:01:13] his life he's been trying to pile stuff
[1:01:16] on you pile sin on you try to have a
[1:01:19] record against you to try to build up
[1:01:22] his case why you can't be a son and
[1:01:25] daughter of God don't look at his
[1:01:29] evidence because God threw it in the sea
[1:01:32] of God's forgetfulness to be remembered
[1:01:35] no more he can lay nothing to the charge
[1:01:40] of God's elect because the seed of God
[1:01:45] remains in them and that seed will
[1:01:48] produce what it's planted for let's just
[1:01:52] close here and because it it it's just
[1:01:54] so wonderful so you understand when the
[1:01:57] scripture says we're joint heirs with
[1:02:01] Christ we are now sitting in Heavenly
[1:02:05] places with
[1:02:06] him well Paul got caught
[1:02:09] up he understood it he understood I'm a
[1:02:14] Son of
[1:02:15] God I'm join
[1:02:19] HS I have a I have a crown of
[1:02:22] righteousness waiting for me
[1:02:25] he said we we'll be translated in a
[1:02:28] moment in the twinkling of an
[1:02:31] eye those that are dead in Christ
[1:02:33] they'll rise first those of us who
[1:02:36] remain will be caught up together with
[1:02:38] the Saints we're going to meet them in
[1:02:40] the air well he he he was seeing it yes
[1:02:44] sir of course we know that old seed was
[1:02:46] going to go into the ground old Satan
[1:02:48] wasn't going to leave it there he was on
[1:02:50] that horse rider right there in that
[1:02:52] first age what was a white White Horse
[1:02:54] it represented
[1:02:56] lies twisting the word putting in his
[1:03:00] Doctrine sowing that Trinity thinking
[1:03:03] that keeps a man from seeing the word of
[1:03:05] God they trying to come along all the
[1:03:07] ages and and and and then on another
[1:03:10] horse rider and another horse rider and
[1:03:13] God's fighting it off in every age with
[1:03:15] the Beast and finally we come into this
[1:03:18] age he's on a Pale Horse total confusion
[1:03:22] Doctrine all messed up but what comes
[1:03:24] swooping in amen an
[1:03:28] eagle amen a Seer a Divine interpreter
[1:03:33] of the word of God to restore us back to
[1:03:37] the original
[1:03:40] revelation of God's
[1:03:43] word oh
[1:03:46] my I like what brother Bram said this
[1:03:48] morning you just end up arguing with
[1:03:53] yourself and defeating your own
[1:03:57] purpose don't argue with God's
[1:04:00] word believe
[1:04:03] it amen he said you're a God believe
[1:04:06] what he said you
[1:04:07] were believe what he said you could
[1:04:10] become don't let this
[1:04:13] old man out here keep depriving you so
[1:04:18] he goes on he says this he
[1:04:21] says now now now this brings you right
[1:04:25] back to the spoken word then we are
[1:04:30] God's word made
[1:04:32] manifest see Jesus said the same thing
[1:04:37] he that believeth on
[1:04:40] me the things who I am what I come for
[1:04:46] and the purpose I do to bring a man back
[1:04:51] to believe the word of God and take
[1:04:55] nothing else with it the works that I do
[1:04:59] he'll do
[1:05:00] also so now look at what what he's
[1:05:03] really saying it's not to believe that
[1:05:06] he
[1:05:08] was Jesus
[1:05:10] was Jesus died but he he says this is
[1:05:15] what he wants us to believe he that
[1:05:19] believeth on
[1:05:21] me who I am
[1:05:25] who is he he's not a second person of
[1:05:27] the
[1:05:30] Trinity he was our
[1:05:35] Kinsman he was our
[1:05:38] brother he was of the same lineage that
[1:05:42] we
[1:05:42] were spoken word lineage from the Lamb's
[1:05:47] Book of Life The Original Seed he came
[1:05:51] into this world from the original seed
[1:05:56] that would have brought us in the world
[1:05:58] but we got the hybrid side of it cuz
[1:06:02] Eve uh got
[1:06:05] involved prophet of God said she took
[1:06:08] the route of a I just won't say what I
[1:06:11] should say what he said what's wrong
[1:06:13] with me I'll say exactly what he
[1:06:17] said he
[1:06:23] said
[1:06:31] I find it right
[1:06:33] here he
[1:06:47] said find
[1:06:51] it Well maybe I can't find it for reason
[1:06:54] but he said she took the path of a
[1:06:56] what he
[1:06:58] said you know what I mean and then and
[1:07:01] it threw us it threw us all all in in
[1:07:06] into death and that's what she did so
[1:07:10] now he's come to make it right now if we
[1:07:12] can believe so not only he says believe
[1:07:14] who I am and what I come
[1:07:19] for you understand so it's not it's not
[1:07:23] that's what I said Satan put all kinds
[1:07:25] of churches out there just giving you
[1:07:28] part of the formula you've got to
[1:07:30] believe who he was who was he he was a
[1:07:33] kinsman redeemer he was born and and and
[1:07:37] came into this world tempted the same
[1:07:40] way as we were
[1:07:42] tempted he suffered suffering just as we
[1:07:45] suffered it but he was without sin why
[1:07:50] was he without sin he doesn't he didn't
[1:07:53] come through the the hybrid system he
[1:07:56] came the original
[1:08:00] way oh I like it and so now he's here
[1:08:05] and he's got a
[1:08:07] purpose his purpose is to go redeem his
[1:08:11] own he's a quickening spirit he's now to
[1:08:15] go
[1:08:17] Quicken all the
[1:08:19] seed of God that's embedded in this
[1:08:24] Earth and bring them back to life to
[1:08:28] resurrect them in the the work of
[1:08:32] reproducing the word and bring them back
[1:08:36] to being the sons and daughters that
[1:08:39] they were in the
[1:08:41] beginning don't put it off in the
[1:08:44] future it's yours now to lay hold
[1:08:49] of it's yours now to gain the victory
[1:08:52] over it's it's yours now to tell Satan
[1:08:56] Satan you cannot have
[1:09:00] me I'm not going to be in your bondage
[1:09:03] no
[1:09:06] more you say well what what about
[1:09:08] sickness in your body God heals sickness
[1:09:11] in the body but don't you let a sickness
[1:09:14] rob you of your
[1:09:17] Victory you still keep your joy you
[1:09:20] still keep your hope you still keep your
[1:09:22] Victory it there no sign Gods against
[1:09:25] you when they asked Jesus about it he
[1:09:27] said that the glory of God might be
[1:09:30] revealed and so he he says so you you
[1:09:35] believe what I come for and the purpose
[1:09:39] I
[1:09:40] do to bring a man back to believe the
[1:09:45] word of God and take nothing else with
[1:09:50] it and then the works that I do heal do
[1:09:55] also oh my goodness as many as believe
[1:10:00] he gave them power to be the Sons and
[1:10:03] Daughters of God and then I'd like to
[1:10:05] read this last statement we notice then
[1:10:08] see the spoken word then we are God's
[1:10:12] word made manifest that's how God wants
[1:10:16] his church is to manifest himself he can
[1:10:22] how can he manifest himself unless his
[1:10:26] own seed is in that
[1:10:32] person can you imagine having that life
[1:10:35] in you all the time and it's laying
[1:10:40] dormant it's laying dormant all it's got
[1:10:44] to do you've heard the prophet say this
[1:10:46] over and over again when it gets in the
[1:10:48] right condition when it gets in the
[1:10:51] right channel when it gets in in the
[1:10:54] right atmosphere it'll bring forth
[1:10:58] what's the preaching of the word of God
[1:11:00] to do to bring us in the right Condition
[1:11:03] it's to put us in the right atmosphere
[1:11:06] it's to put the water on it the spirit
[1:11:10] on it that it can bring
[1:11:13] forth God's interested in
[1:11:17] reproducing Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:22] God that's why this is the bride
[1:11:26] age in
[1:11:28] type not the carnal way but the way it
[1:11:32] would have been in the beginning where
[1:11:35] he's got a bride a spiritual
[1:11:40] bride and that seed is in scattered
[1:11:45] out in all kinds of different people but
[1:11:49] it's still his seed and now that seed
[1:11:53] might be in one person a different
[1:11:56] person some person the outside doesn't
[1:11:58] matter it's the seed that makes the
[1:12:01] difference and that seed's there he
[1:12:05] sewed it he sewed it to this age and
[1:12:09] that seed hasn't changed it's pure seed
[1:12:12] but it needs to be germinated and it can
[1:12:15] only be germinated by one
[1:12:18] thing now a lot you might have tried to
[1:12:20] follow a lot of things and do a lot of
[1:12:23] things and try a lot of religions but
[1:12:26] sometime in your life it was planned
[1:12:29] that God would run the pure word of God
[1:12:33] across that seed and that seed would
[1:12:35] come to
[1:12:37] life and then that seed would begin to
[1:12:40] transform you bring this flesh under
[1:12:44] subjection that that word life can start
[1:12:47] to shine forth out of you Sons and
[1:12:51] Daughters of God so I I I don't want to
[1:12:54] battle a phantom
[1:12:59] enemy I don't want to try to become what
[1:13:03] Satan says a Christian
[1:13:06] is or what Satan
[1:13:09] says how I get
[1:13:12] there I don't want to spend my whole
[1:13:15] life trying to bring my my body into
[1:13:19] subjection so that I think by doing so
[1:13:23] I'm going to be
[1:13:25] saved I'm not bringing in my body into
[1:13:28] subjection of the purpose of gaining
[1:13:33] salvation I'm bringing this body in
[1:13:36] subjection because it was born in sin
[1:13:38] and shaped in iniquity and it becomes a
[1:13:41] hindrance to
[1:13:43] me all things are lawful for me but all
[1:13:47] things aren't expedient I'm not going to
[1:13:49] let this flesh ruin my position in
[1:13:53] Christ I'm going to take control of it
[1:13:56] I'm going to I'm going to bring it under
[1:13:58] subjection and I'm going to leave those
[1:14:00] things which are behind and I'm going to
[1:14:02] press for a higher
[1:14:04] calling because I
[1:14:08] am a son and a daughter of God that was
[1:14:13] sowed in me and that's the
[1:14:17] faith that's in
[1:14:20] you that's What Makes You Different
[1:14:24] that's why you can
[1:14:25] overcome not how you got here but what
[1:14:30] he put in you from the beginning we all
[1:14:34] got here different and we all find
[1:14:37] ourselves in different conditions with
[1:14:39] different failures but unbelief doesn't
[1:14:43] stop
[1:14:44] God oh no wonder he said when this
[1:14:47] church can realize who she is and the
[1:14:51] two spirits in the the framework of the
[1:14:54] church and withstand the the one she'll
[1:14:59] become an invincible
[1:15:02] Army you've got to withstand everything
[1:15:05] that's contrary to the word everything
[1:15:08] Satan tells you that's contrary to what
[1:15:11] God said you are you don't believe it no
[1:15:15] matter how good of a picture that he can
[1:15:17] paint and no matter what a
[1:15:20] failure you feel you might be he didn't
[1:15:23] see a
[1:15:25] failure he saw Sons and Daughters of God
[1:15:28] he saw his seed and he sent his
[1:15:32] Redeemer to bring that seed to life and
[1:15:36] that seed will
[1:15:38] produce what he said have faith in he
[1:15:44] that is in
[1:15:45] you that's your
[1:15:48] Victory you got to know
[1:15:51] that I I I I just he prophet of God said
[1:15:55] I only wish I could get
[1:15:58] everybody to see
[1:16:03] that your
[1:16:05] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:08] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:16:11] he put the wedding band of
[1:16:15] predestination on you over there in
[1:16:19] other words he married you there he knew
[1:16:22] by for knowledge the seed would be in
[1:16:26] you he knew it was going to show up in
[1:16:30] you and when it showed up in you he
[1:16:33] planned your life that this message word
[1:16:36] would come across and strike it some of
[1:16:39] you he put in a family that believed the
[1:16:41] message so you could hear it some of you
[1:16:45] he put you you were out in the world he
[1:16:47] had to put you through a desperate
[1:16:49] situation to get you to hear it but like
[1:16:53] that great Eagle it went out searching
[1:16:56] cuz it knew it had a seed
[1:16:59] somewhere and we're never going to rise
[1:17:03] above the battle of the flesh until we
[1:17:06] can accept our position in Christ Jesus
[1:17:10] our sunship our daughter ship we're
[1:17:15] placed by the spirit we're adopted into
[1:17:19] the plan of God and then we have the
[1:17:21] full Authority of our father because we
[1:17:25] too are the sons and daughters of God
[1:17:28] and we too have dominion and authority
[1:17:31] over Satan and we can take our rightful
[1:17:34] place as inheritors and owners of every
[1:17:39] promise in the book and the power to
[1:17:43] defeat Satan at every turn oh church I
[1:17:48] wish we could see ourselves the way he
[1:17:50] sees
[1:17:51] us I wish we could understand the great
[1:17:54] price he paid but I think if we keep
[1:17:57] plowing we keep opening it up we keep
[1:18:00] laying it out there one day someone's
[1:18:03] going to stand up and say you know
[1:18:04] something I come from God and I go to
[1:18:08] God Satan get behind me amen God bless
[1:18:13] you Amen brother Billy come dismiss us
[1:18:16] in prayer let's Stand Together can you
[1:18:18] love the
[1:18:19] Lord amen God's good that's good my my
[1:18:24] request and I'll just let you know how
[1:18:26] I'm doing uh him being able to see a
[1:18:29] little better uh U I have what's called
[1:18:33] floaters in my eye and and what that is
[1:18:37] is I as you know a blood vessel broke in
[1:18:39] my eye it filled my eye full of blood
[1:18:42] and and now my body is absorbing that
[1:18:45] blood but there's still uh little
[1:18:49] floaters and so I'll be reading and all
[1:18:51] of a sudden one of them floaters ERS
[1:18:53] will come along and then I'm I'm trying
[1:18:56] to look around it you know what I mean
[1:18:59] or try you know think I can shake it out
[1:19:01] of my way amen well there ain't no
[1:19:03] floater going to keep me from God's word
[1:19:07] amen I thought well Satan I can't read
[1:19:09] it but I can listen to it and the
[1:19:11] scripture says blessed is he that
[1:19:13] heareth the Prophecies of this book so I
[1:19:17] thank God for the tapes I don't know
[1:19:19] where I'd be with without them I I just
[1:19:22] can't imagine how them early Saints kept
[1:19:25] such a
[1:19:26] standard without a Bible without a book
[1:19:30] or without a
[1:19:32] tape you know what they did they kept
[1:19:35] their world out of their life so so they
[1:19:39] could be Spirit-filled
[1:19:41] every day of their life they stayed
[1:19:45] moist in the water of God's word at and
[1:19:49] it made the victory so uh the doctor is
[1:19:52] going to to give me a couple more weeks
[1:19:55] to see if my body will absorb that blood
[1:19:58] and he said if after 3 weeks if he
[1:20:00] doesn't he'll go in there and remove it
[1:20:03] and and take it out I'll have to have
[1:20:05] surgery so I don't like to go that way
[1:20:08] and he says I'm doing all this so I can
[1:20:12] stick a needle in your eye uh with a
[1:20:16] camera on the end of it so you're going
[1:20:18] to stick a laser in my eye and go and
[1:20:21] kill all the
[1:20:23] old blood
[1:20:24] vessels and then he'll stick a camera in
[1:20:27] my eye to see what he's doing and those
[1:20:30] floaters are the things that's keeping
[1:20:32] him from seeing I thought well what a
[1:20:34] wonderful thing I have to look forward
[1:20:36] to I'm sure glad I got
[1:20:39] Calvary amen I'm sure glad I got a lot
[1:20:42] of promises of God in between here and
[1:20:46] there but if that's the way he chooses
[1:20:49] to do it he's still the Healer right
[1:20:51] he's Still the One that's going to
[1:20:53] restore me and and just like my hair I
[1:20:56] haven't lost a one of them so let's keep
[1:20:59] positive let's believe let's start
[1:21:02] acting like who we are Sons and
[1:21:05] Daughters of God no negativity no
[1:21:08] sadness but victorious in Christ Jesus
[1:21:12] amen let's sing it oh glorious Victory
[1:21:15] oh
