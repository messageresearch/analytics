the twinkling of an eye father to ever be with the Lord father we look up because we know our Redemption draweth nigh bless your word to us tonight father we ask it in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles let's open to Galatians the first chapter of Galatians in read one verses 1 through 5. and um Paul speaking here writing to the church at galatia he said in chapter 1 verse 1 he says Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the Brethren who are with me unto the churches of galatia Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil age according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen father we ask me to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated the scripture tells us that in the last days perilous times shall come and I think that we look at Israel and we know about the time clock of what's going on there and we can also look at the condition of the world around us because the condition of the world around us testifies to where that we are and in every age the prophet of God said the Believers or the church nominal missed their place in that age and so I think that if we begin to understand but what is what is going on around us what is transpiring the what is finding its place and its position and so as we're going to listen to Just 30 minutes this evening of a portion out of this God of this evil age and I believe that brother Brandon preached this in the last part of his ministry the last year of his ministry and he he's warning the people of what is starting to take place that what Satan's doing how what he's rising to what he's taking control of to what it is and how that and and you'll hear it hear how that he's ascended to the place where he has become the object of worship and he said millions and millions of people Ark worshiping him and don't know it okay so that's our goal our goal is to is to establish our faith on two fronts Faith because we have discernment to see the evil of this age because it's been revealed to us it shouldn't discourage us it should build our faith Leslie and I were writing in the truck the other day and we had the news on and they begin to speak about how uh we're moving closer to a nuclear conflict that Russia is talking about making nuclear strikes and how that it's possible that China made invade Taiwan and and all this stuff again all and you know and it sounded like terrible news we're on the verge of nuclear war unless he said praise God it's happening men praise God it's happening you know what I mean and it's happening Church you understand the the move towards the mark of the beast the move towards uh uh these things are are are tremendous and there's all these little nuggets in God's word that that speaks to us and and tells us certain things and uh and so we're going to start up right around paragraph 70 uh five I believe it is and we're just going to go to the end of paragraph 115. It's just uh 30 minutes but I'd like just to to um uh Satan started out what brother Graham's going to start out saying to us he said notice how beautifully the scriptures tie themselves together in every age notice now and I think when you see these little statements brother Graham says notice now and it's almost like a signal take notice I'm going to say something and he goes on for a little bit and he he ministers and then he comes and he makes this statement he says the day we are living in you will you'll hear it in just a moment the day we are living in is called in the Bible the day of man man's day this is not God's day okay his Day's coming okay God is not the God of this Earth the Bible says he isn't he's the god of Heaven but this is but this is not God's day this is choosing day you understand because so to what in order for God to be just to Sodom and Gomorrah in order for God to be just for every other age in order for God to be just to eat in order for God to be just and he said just God he's got to present you with the same choice and he knew what choice you would make you understand that's why he loved Jacob and he hated Esau the children not yet being born neither having done any good or evil because he knew what was in Jacob's heart Jacob craved that Birthright he craved he craved his his life was was it was given to the value of that Birthright and if you ever study the birthright the firstborn got a two-thirds of The Possession the others got left there's blessings that came with the birthright and and they craved that now God's looking at us and asking ourselves do you crave the blessings that come with God's word do you crave the the the the life and the and the spirit that comes with God's word you crave the fruits of the word of God and and obedience to the word of God produces the spirit of the word of God that in other words the word is only manifested in the flesh when it's obeyed and we kind of went over that Sunday so we're moving now to to where he says it's choosing time so he's presenting us the choice but to choose this day whom you will serve as for me and my house will serve the Lord after and uh and Jesus challenged them too he says tell me where I haven't fulfilled the word of God you say that you have Moses but they are which which testifies of me so we're gonna watch in just the next 30 minutes as the scriptures before they were ever spoken years ago when they were spoken how they described the age that we're living in and what's going on now because we're still living in a scriptural world okay and what I mean by that is is the word is still coming to pass and and the word is still determining and controlling the course of man so command is on a a a a a road to describe destruction and it was prophesied and spoken of in the word of God that man would go down this road to destruction if we can sit back and if if nothing uh else could make a deduction if the scripture says they're on the road to destruction and this is the time that we're living in and this has come to pass how much closer must we be to the coming of the Lord occur or how much more sincere I should be because this is the most deceitful age and Satan has become the god of this age and he's got people worshiping him that don't even know it and it causes us to to to take heed and and and uh and and and Shake ourselves and realize that if if all these promises are coming to pass how much more is the promise of our Redemption coming to pass also and then I just thought I would read this other little statement because it to me it it was remarkable in its in its way how that uh how that the world testifies of the word of God and can't help it how many know that we have two great political movements in our country now one they referred to as the conservative movement which is a the people that that believe in traditional family uh values and church values and uh you know some form of moral uh fortitude and and that's all that way I can express it but listen to what the prophet of God said I just thought it's it struck me he says and notice he preached that kind of scientific social educated Progressive gospel to Eve and I thought you've got to be kidding me everything they're talking about today is Progressive I'm Progressive is the progressives we're progressing you know we're we're getting to work we're we're moving on and and I I just couldn't believe it I I I I thought you know there's no place they won't go they're passing a law that you can't have your dog stick its head out the window of a car yeah no that's serious they're going to put that to a vote that you can't have your dog have its head out the window because it might be damaging to the dog something might get in its eye or the wind might dry out its uh you know I I dogs love to stick their head out the window look you know something about a dog it won't eat something that's poison you know what I mean because they know it's not good for them they won't eat it you know what I mean and if they're not going to stick their head out the window if they think it's doing them harm oh but guess what man knows what's best you know I mean we're going to protect the dogs we don't care about humans you know what I mean we don't care about the all the the millions of unborn children we don't care about all these things but bless God we're going to stop people from having their poor dog dip their head out the window you know we used to stick our hands out the window to make hand signals how many knows what this is that's right right left this is no dog out the window and I want to I I I wanted just to add a touchy humor to it because I want us not to let what's happening in this world gobias without recognizing what it is what is happening can you you know they they say we've woke up where we've awakened to all the social injustice to all the history there after the classics now they want to get rid of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer and and these books and that books and do away with Alice in Wonderland and and uh uh I I don't know you know the little story where the girl clicks her heels and ends up in a tornado in Kansas somewhere okay pretty soon you it Kansas will be taken off of the map it's it's you understand it's absolutely insane what's taking place but watch it in the word of God how the prophet of God describes it how he shares with us how it's unfolding where it came from and and then the next part he talks to us how he did it and so we'll just listen to this portions very got some very strong um um statements in it but if you believe God's word then you've got to believe God's word for the age and and this is God's Divine interpretation of how the word of God is coming to pass in our day and I can say this to you a hundred percent you can bet your life on it I know that's not a good terminology to use I hope nobody misunderstands that but you can place the confidence of your life in this message I place my salvation in this message a hundred percent because it's the word of God so as we start with that paragraph and he says just watch how beautifully the scriptures blend together for each age sit back let's enjoy 30 minutes and we'll close quickly after and we'll be out of there and I hope that the parking lot lights help you this evening God richly bless you as we listen to the word of God notice how beautiful the scriptures tie themselves together in every age notice now and when the church world would not have the word of God to rule over them they accepted a murder Barabbas what did this do it exalted Satan the God of this evil age to the place that he's always wanted now listen for Satan is not spoke of as a god of any other age but this age he once spoke of the god of the age of Noah you once spoke of of the god of the age of Moses the god of the age of Elijah but this evil age he is the oh don't miss it he is the god of this evil age worshiped bye millions and billions of people and they don't know it but let's let the scripture uncover him this morning NSD then you'll know let the scripture as in the meetings of discernment when the Holy Spirit gets among his word and he clouds out this man and says you have no business living with this other woman what did you do that for 10 years ago when you run off of that man's wife what's he doing uncovered him exposing Satan that's got the man bound or the woman a woman's husband are the sins that they've done the things that they have done what does it do exposing the doctors take instruments and try to find what's wrong they can't do it we can't tell but then the Holy Spirit comes out and reveals what he is and exposes him see that's what the word of God is it is a light that shines in darkness and when you take a noise in the room it sounds mysterious a bunch of something working and you don't know what it is turn on the light quickly crickets roaches they're they are children of the darkness and when the light flashes they scatter away they went out from us because it was an obvious the Bible said see they cannot live in the light of the world for the god of Heaven is sent his light in this place they said he might lighten the path for his children's he might not walk in darkness and stumble but they might walk in the light of The Shining of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen notice Satan not called the god of any other age but this age it was his ambition to be like God from the very beginning let's read that we just take your time let's go back down let's see I got Rhoda Isaiah 14. let's go back here to Isaiah 14 just a minute and see what God Said the god what Satan did Isaiah 14 12. and 14. notice how art thou falling from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how are God cast down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has sit in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God sons of God now and I will set also upon the Mount of the congregation in the side of the North it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took two-thirds two-thirds of the stars of Heaven ascended himself above those stars and preached to them and deceived two-thirds of them you see it all right notice that's his ambition and now he is ready with his careful selected educated bride by his own knowledge see all painted up it is a deceit of big buildings and big denominations and paints of knowledge and Theology and smart and intellectual and educated to deceive the whole world and become a God that's what he's done all heading up into the person of the Antichrist which is already crowned the biker of God by his worldly loving scientific bride all dressed up in pop of intellectual religious education she is made religious like him and by his own interpretation of the word of God as it did Eve and as his son teen did now you said Satan's son show me one place in the Bible as a team was ever called Adam's son the Bible said he was the son of that evil one serpency all their cover's been took off now brother the pyramid has been opened as the Revelation showed notice what he will do is thought he thought God dwelled in worldly Beauty he did that in heaven sin never began in the Garden of Eden it began in heaven when Lucifer the son of the morning exalted himself in Beauty and one of the more beautiful kingdom than that of Michael and he thought that God dwelled in Beauty and noticed King he didn't want no blood sacrifice he come down and offered the fruit or or the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just exactly like Ableton offered a sacrifice fell down before God In Worship obedient and everweight but without the revelation of the word and the Word was from the beginning God's plan but God revealed by Revelation the very thing that he Vindicated and punctuated or that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of God God revealing to him what that his mother did not take an apple that a snake Giver but she had a sexual affair with the person of Satan in the form of the Beast not a reptile but the most smartest subtlest of all the field the image of man the only thing that the seed would mix in now science is trying to find him and they never will find him because ever born in his bodies change but the Bible declares it to be so notice what this fellow will do now this fella he will set in the temple of God that is the church revealing himself to be God now if you want to read that that's second Thessalonians uh two three and four in Revelations 13. 4 11 and 12 were spoke both prophets both John and Paul of what he would be in the last date now you read it because I've got wrote down here but to save time now the day we are living is called in the Bible the day of man 's day this is not God's day God is not the God of this Earth the Bible says he isn't he's the god of Heaven but this is not God's day this is choosing day either live for today and die choose God and live and God is the word and the word is the word manifested for the hour and today notice the day of man if you don't put that down as go to read but first Corinthians 5 1 5. First Corinthians 4 1 5 Pardon Me First Corinthians 4 1 if I was Paul speaking of being judged by man and man's day the days what do you call it the man's day for you say it's the day that the works by the knowledge of man is glorified look what all the brag of the Communists somebody trying to get somebody to the Moon God's trying to get somebody to heaven but look how they're spending millions and billions and trillions of dollars and a wasted effort when they get there the eagle to find nothing what's the matter with them I don't care about the move I want to pass the moon so fast won't even see it just keep going higher I want to pass the milky white way go on let's keep going yes and the world today is dedicating themselves to the knowledge which came by Satan and man's day is glorified not by the word of God but by the knowledge that he has now think that that's soaking and when you play this tape back on this point you're stopped for a while and think his works are exalted above God's word and manifested works the wisdom of Satan which he give to Eve at the beginning now listen don't miss this the wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the Vindicated word of God for the hour our churches proves that bother they're seminaries schools of learning that's learned more than God's word knows about they think and there Dr so and so and teacher so and so and Professor so-and-so has exalted their own knowledge so-called from Satan truth above the Vindicated promise of God made clear right before him and man fall apart his scientific achievements trying to prove God's word wrong just think of that he he is that is the man's theology explains God's word to the people and makes it of no effect again like he had it in the denominational age when Jesus appeared on the Earth Jesus said you hypocrites you by your tradition that's their interpretation has took the word of God and made it of no effect to the people and that's the same thing they've done today it doesn't have the effect notice they the people exalt him above all that's called God don't second Thessalonians say they would do it and the authority of a denominational Church the people believing that denomination more than to believe God in God is the word they'll freed their denominational Creed above the word which exalts him above all is called God and there's only one God and that's the word all that's called God so he asked God sets in the Church of the god proving that he is God because he's got the people worshiping him God is the word and he exhausts himself above all it's called God and there's only one God and that God is the word okay and all it's called God is the God of this age has exalted himself above the true Vindicated word of God at Saint John 1. see above all it's called God so that he as God sits in the temple of God with authority look and he is praised for it oh that's the people God see that deception he is praised for it and solemnly believed by the people of this evil age ah do you see the God and his servants of this evil age uh let's watch it be manifested he says he is making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of God but by his coming together in denominations and Creeds and intellectual and scientific and so forth he is making a better world for a man to live in and ignoring the promise of God that the only time the world will be fit to live in is in the millennium you know my feeling he's made a better world of sin in instead of living notice did he do it he legalized sin he legalized Whiskey Drinking cigarette smoking and in the church is legalized that a woman could be a member of the church with short hair now but he stopped just a minute she can wear shorts wear pants and still belong to his religious group which is absolutely contrary to the word of God he says it's all right see his knowledge what's that got to do with the woman just the same as taking a forbidden fruit or not the forbidden fruit that's what it is God said not to do it but he does it and she believes him and she loves him for it she hates God her own actions proves she does she says she loves him but she loves Satan she worships a god of fashion the god of the world the Hollywood goddesses she loves him but she hates the true word of God which is the only true God there is legalizes it in the churches there's no harm our women can do this that or the other but in the presence of the Living God she's not even permitted to come unless she's repent cease he is the god of worldly Beauty yes she wants to look beautiful and he is a god of beauty from the beginning he can and has achieved by his knowledge and Science and materials to make Beauty for his this model age this model a modern age rather of evil made Beauty notice it's noteworthy to notice at the beginning saith and his children never went the scientific way now we're going to talk about science for a few minutes if I say this not excusing my ignorance but a bunch of ignoramuses anything will deny the word of God it's noteworthy watch it SAS children never went the scientific Realm they were humble herdsmen farmers and so forth but Cain's children did why inspired by their daddy the devil change inspired by his daddy the devil and these inspired by that seed coming down what's the seed of God coming down do you ever age and what's worse heading up today Christians genuine Christians are not all about scientific research and stuff you know just a minute we'll get into that but Keynes did ask the nature of the Father the devil full of worldly knowledge Beauty and science and so forth King's Children was scientific they were educated they were the players of music instruments a modern Elvis Presley some of this stuff like at the school board let's happen up here in the lane every Saturday night Builders of City beautifying women for a personal lust as a devil giving women painting bobbing her hair put them in the shorts and things like that they as far as his own dirty lust that's pretty flat but I don't know any other way to say it now we know that Satan's gospel is a gospel of Science and progress he preached it in Eden not God Satan did the science of progress science and progress is Satan's gospel look where he's led us to today with it see notice he preached it in Eden to who to Adam's bride and she fell for it he deceived her into questioning one of God's words let's see what he might have said he must have said it is not scientific to die in this holy church or you will be schooled and educated not to believe in such unreasonable things as death I don't care if God's word did say it it's unreasonable oh look at him today God is a good god you're in his holy church why you cannot die but God said you would that settles it see him today or just belong to church think what you do or this that the other just come to church and be a good member cutting your hair that's nonsense and wearing shorts and putting on painting going to dances and a little fear once in a while won't hurt you as long as you don't indulge in it frankly I wish your children would take it so that they could learn where they liked it or not there he is the God of this age this evil age God is a good god I've heard that's the must you'll get sick amen God is also a God of Justice he ain't an old Dodie grandpa that can be pushed around his grandkids don't have any sin he's a God of Justice and holiness improved in the guard of Eden by his first children you cross that line of one of these words you're dead same thing applies today and notice he preached that kind of a scientific social educated Progressive gospel to Eve and Adam's bride believed it and he has succeeded in filling the so-called bride of Christ the Church of the second Adam with the same arguments that's right oh it's not it's not for God God is too good to do it why as long as you go to church if thou believest the devil believes not make believe but he actually believes he's not saved if thou believest he tells the second bride or the second Adam's bride the same as he told the first such as now Divine Healing there is no such thing we can prove that there's never been a case proved and this baptism in Jesus name now don't you realize that I'm the authority of the church he said we settled at it and I see a room and have three unclean spirits went out of the Dragon the false prophets and so forth we believe there is a trinity of gods hope for goodness sakes that's as Heathen as can be you never come before God but such a thing as that oh don't make any difference if you're baptized in the titles of father son Holy Ghost what differs does it make it made so much difference unto Paul commanded a bunch of Baptists that there had to be re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ before the Holy Ghost never come on and also calls that Apostle to scream out it said if an angel comes from heaven and preaches anything else let him be cursed sure it makes a difference oh my there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost in these days that was only for the apostles it's past and such a thing as prophets not even knowing of Miracles they're unscientific Malachi 4 that was for another age John 14 12 oh Jesus didn't really mean that Luke 17 30 all that was just a myth see it's misinterpreted it wasn't in the original when God Almighty comes down in our midst and proves it when he says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever he proves that soul okay who says not about it God interprets his own word he said he would do this thing in the last days there will be a light in the evening time as there is what part of America the same Sun that rises in the east of the same Sun it sets in the west the prophet said there would be a day it could be called date or night it's a dismal the clouds as over the face of the Sun but said about evening time it shall come light again the same Sun these Alpha and Omega same Sun that Rose in the East was predicted to rise in the west again in the last days just before the day was over I don't know how they interpreted God interprets his own word he proves it this is the evening time sad but she sure fell for it again Christ's Pride fell for it and took the intellectual knowledge of some Seminary preacher instead of believing the pure Vindicated word of God now ministers I enter in the land word of God you might disagree with this I'm not hurting you I'm just trying I'm talking to my own group I'm just trying to if you want to set in I'll sure be glad for you to hear it and then you listen at it but I'm just telling them what they have thought they have seen it to him but God proven that it's right this is the hour don't need anybody to interpret it your worldly knowledge don't have anything you might have a b-a-d-d-a-d or whatever it might be that don't mean one thing amen God interprets his word himself he promised it and here it is but by the knowledge of Seminary denominational preaching has caused the whole world to wander add to the Beast whose deadly womb was sealed from Pagan to paffle see where she's heading up she believes it she believes the knowledge that he tells her it is I watch it is that both engaged Brides believe Satan's knowledge against God's word the Bride of Adam belief Satan's knowledge against God's word and the bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge and his intellectual evil age against God's word and notice Eve in the natural that believed it and plunged the whole human race to death the natural Pride Adam the natural man of the earth his pride before he got to her to be wife plunge the whole human race into death whether it's scientific or not we die just the same cause God said we would well you're in holy Eden or holy church or holy denomination whatever it might be you'll die the day you disbelieve one word of God's word to be the truth that's the day you separate yourself not just a whole she'll add one word or take one away that's the day you die notice Adam's bride calls natural death to her race the human race and the second Adam's bride Christ engaged bride has plunged the whole Church to a denominational death to take the mark of the beast by the scientific intellectual big denominations we're Baptist we're Presbyterian we're Pentecostals and so forth we got this and we own more property we we're noted by the government we're all around the world and all such things in the best of the mayor of the city and so forth comes to us even the president comes to have mass said with us and we comes to this or that the other the whole world has been plunged to a spiritual denominational death the whole church she's dead you say you're covering a lot of territory Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah horn eight Souls were saved so shall it be at the coming of the son of man in the days of life where three was brought out of Solomon at that day that is already group already out remember but as it was then when the son of man will be manifested look what look where we're living now she has called the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program I'm picturing to you the God of this world when she as Eve had the very feeling of God's word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do that instead of caring for the baptism the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost is only for the disciples instead of keeping Divine Healing going what you ought to be now raised in the dead and doing great Miracles she's let Satan under his leadership of religious man take the word of God and try to say it that it was for another age and she's believed it when the Bible said the things that I do shall you do also Jesus said that going into all the words preach the gospel to every creature we're still creatures these signs shall follow every one of them that believe she denies every bit of it she denies all the supernatural as she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the Bible where priests and holy fathers so-called or Bishops archbishops or uh District transmitters gentle overseers and so forth has put their own interpretation to it and God has let them set their dead as 12 o'clock the only things left the last days is a bunch of little Pentecostal with a bunch of music hooped up as hard as you can rub them down for speaking in tongues and shouting and having a form of godliness but denying the word thereof tell them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ laugh your face that that God goes right I don't make this show just the same proven his word to be so notice the tree that Satan caused Eve to partake of was a tree of Good and Evil it was a mixed treat now look at today we're living in when he's calling out a bride he's got a church that claims to be doing good when it's Evil by denying the word a mystery I won't say they they have great societies they they they help the uh this and the Red Cross and Doris is it in all the schools they look here oh but just deny one word that's all you have to do to die no matter how intellectual how good it is Jesus said a little 11 11 is the whole lump one spot 11 ruins the lump one word of God displaced spoils the whole picture what about my arm being where my foot should be what if my ear was down here where my hands should be a little eleven eleven's a whole lot say how do you know it's right God proves it right he vindicates it he said that you're in a word then he proves it that's how we know we're trying not just an eye one words all it takes to die it brought the same results in this evil age spiritual death as it did physical death to the whole human race you don't hear that side of the message a whole lot do you you you understand but you realize what you've been called out of what you've been called to what privilege that it's been given to you to see the promised word of God for this hour coming to pass he promised that he would come he promised the son of man Ministry would be here he promised Luke 17 30 he promised Revelations 10 7. he promised these things and and by God's grace you've seen it you know and so you you get a good picture of what Satan's trying to do he's trying to get on that throne and be worshiped by people choosing His science and his education his economy his civilization the you know everything that he he's offering and and we we just know that it's just not what's going to get us there what's going to get us there is the word of God and and that's what that's what we're hanging to and and it's it's hard to believe that you are actually seeing Satan Ascend to his throne and take complete control of this world and it's just going to be that little elect lady just that few as it was in the days of Noah that are going to stay free from it so you know if you're not little thought is the Father's good pleasure to give you the help to give you the kingdom and his kingdom will prevail and and so I I just feel in my heart it's it's needful sometimes to to you know and not be discouraged and not and you know I know we shake our head in wonderment uh you just you just can't believe people can come up with what they're coming up with but it just shows that it's going to go into total chaos and it's exactly been prophesied and it's hard to believe that this was in 1965. and you cannot believe how tame 1965 would look according to the way that things are in the world today but he told us didn't he so let's take heed and and there's a lot of marvelous great things for us to rejoice in so you know if if uh you know if you have a loved one out of the Kingdom pray more than you ever have before for him and just ask God and don't be afraid to testify to the things you've seen but it is it's a Satan sold them education science and knowledge instead of the word of God he gave him a substitute and I I just with all my heart uh I I just hear brother Brandon crying out more than I ever have back to the word back to the word back to the word we're not against blessings but nothing is a substitute for God's word we're not against praising we're not against shouting we're not against worshiping we're not against singing he said but if you do that and deny the power of the word and that's what our great warning is to stay with God's word God bless you let's stand together this evening we will keep you much longer and and I I just hope that that you enjoyed the the word of God and and hearing it straight to see how important that was I'm going to give you the date of that sermon um so uh it was um see if I can find the date of it here I don't know if I all right August 1st 1965. so uh yeah just think of that very close to the end of his ministry he's he's letting the world know this is where it's going church we're going to go worship Satan by the millions and by the billions I don't even know how many people are in the world back then but I think there's eight billion now and he says billions of them worshiping Satan act and you just think of the stand that you're taking it used to be one in a million now it's one in a billion huh but praise God aren't you glad you're going to stand with this word despite yourself you'll overcome he really wants to he really wants to help us amen let's just bow our head then we'll sing this song for a song this evening amen our gracious father Lord we just heard straight gospel describing the very hour that we're living in this whole Progressive idea of man leaving the word and going to all their things legalizing Sodom and Gomorrah right in our day legalizing sin and legalizing marijuana and whiskey and and and drugs and nobody seems to be in control but it's Satan's ambition to worship Him Lord and father keep us from the deception it's what we're praying father is a pastor I I just my heart pours out because Lord I don't want the church your bride the people that Fellowship together to to let the bar down and let any of this lives that the enemies come in to make it seem like the message is out of date or it doesn't fit today the things that the messenger said okay there's so many things he left out that it doesn't apply Lord he's a liar father this word is ever so true and it'll never fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but this truth will not pass away Satan is the God of this evil age ascending himself above the stars of others taking the place that he'll be judged and condemned for
