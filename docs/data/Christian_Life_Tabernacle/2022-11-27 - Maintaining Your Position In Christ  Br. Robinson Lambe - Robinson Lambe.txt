Description:
Maintaining Your Position In Christ
Br. Robinson Lambe
November 27, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

so are you malambo Moses no Lambo lambine Moses right anyway I'm not a linguist you know what I mean so uh Even in our church someone will use somebody's last name and say yeah brother such and such I

richly bless you Brother Robinson God bless you tonight we're happy to have you brother God bless you Shalom to everyone God bless you since you are still standing for us to instead of you standing up again can we just open our Bibles and read from the book of Phil lemon it's just one chapter book of Philemon just one chapter we shall we shall read from this just verses 5 and 6. I read in the name of Jesus hearing of thy love and feet which thou has toward the lord Jesus and toward all the sins that the communication of thy feet may be effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus can we also read from the book of First Peter chapter 4 verse 15. for let none of you suffer as a murderer who was a thief or as an evil Doer o as a busy body in other men's matters well just for us to conclude okay you can be seated I really don't want while you are seated can I use this one yeah okay good shall drink a deadly thing no no I happen to be here with my wife yes I'm sorry I don't know where she seated I'm not seeing her okay she sit there right by her uh Hassan as Pastor rightly said Moses happens to be my fifth child of eight children I had four boys four girls but the Lord called one of them the boy and the other three uh doing well even the sisters are all in the message by the grace of God so I thank God for that Grace can you stand up sister let them at least you let them see Moises mother good [Applause] thank you for the appreciation she did it eight times for me to bring me children it was not easy for her so she's very precious to me uh very very precious when I had the first tree I decided to stop then the Lord showed her a vision how she was having a boy it happened the same way it happened to Buddha banam instead of the boy coming directly afterwards it's a girl who came so we knew that the prophecy was still to come then not only did the Lord say a boy was coming he also gave his name he's the only the only of my the only one who came with his name so Moses came with his name and subsequently we had two more then when we got to the seventh child I decided to stop again and this time we went in for an oppression the the the this something we call ligature the the Trump the the just stopped everything they cut the the ligation thank you sir that's a very big big way and so we were sure that we know we had no problem again with uh having kids one night one day into the day not during a night she was sleeping resting at the siesta in her room and then she saw somebody came in and carried an oppression on her and they removed some work was done in her body seemingly they destroyed the operation and sister conceived again it was a very very annoying experience for her because she was already tired of the whole thing she carried that child and the Lord as if the Lord wanted to give her a correction she carried that child for 12 months yes the last one 12 months the child was in the stomach and it was not easy at all for her so we got to eat and we said this time well God you know everything we just left it in the hands of the Lord but all of them are big the last one is 28 years old so you can imagine we got married with 20 and I think she was 17. I got married and we have been together for 47 years we have been together for 47 years bought for four years and not believe the message so I believe when in 1979 so I've been in the message on the preacher for 43 years so by the grace of God will live the peaceful life and we're still together to continue the fight may God bless her and bless our children I'm here to say thank you in fact this morning I was so tired we went to Moses took me to OK me to Mexico we went we came down through San Antonio the right to Del Rio as if that was not sufficient for him he carried me again to how many hours into Mexico so we're doing a lot of work there I spent almost a week there and we came in yesterday after a certain meeting here in Altus Altus you say Altus good so we had a wonderful time there with some breading and we had a patient we wanted to visit here so we came in the evening and when we finished with the patient I called Pastor McGary to announce to him that I was already in town and I felt so tired also was we had walked a lot we're getting over time 4 a.m 5 a.m traveling took the plane from the Rio six o'clock it's all night cold and all of that so I'm not sure that I'll be able to but I call him just to announce that I was coming and then this morning I was already saying I was tired he told me you're going to church and we must be on time I say I don't like getting ready to church so he made it quickly and I was evicted so I could not see the honorable Pastor Before Time to announce that I had I was already in church then when I went to see him he decided to put this burden on me to give me this responsibility of talking to beloved people like you while talking to him yesterday I kept telling I was not sure to meet him so I said well I'm again I want to appreciate you because you're doing a great job you are I know what it is and what it takes to deal with people of various Scholars tribes Nations and so forth if she stand in the middle in such a way that you can bring them together and work and help them in the service of the Lord so I was when I was talking to him he said no brother it's not me Lord I said stop all that receive your flowers I I I I I I like giving people's flowers when they are alive because when they when they are in a coffin you put all those things on their boxes they don't mean anything to him you learn to congratulate a man who's doing a great job and we I must say thank you well not because I'm studying here I am not used to flattering if you come to a country yeah maybe one of the the hardest creatures you can imagine had very hard and difficult to extract words or flattery for my mouth it doesn't resemble me but when something is good call it good it is true that the pastor of this church is Jesus Christ but he has an angel in the church he has a representative in the church and you must say thank you to that person we see them messages everywhere he went he spent time to appreciate the pastors the men of God who are walking and we shall not change those things because we want to we don't want to scare but I'm again you know we keep saying I will repeat God bless you sir for the wonderful work you're doing that you not only are taking good care of this makes draw of tongues countries everything but you are still open to other preachers who want to bring in a contribution to this church we I saw the other day I was watching your program here we're in Tampa called me say just open the link so so so so you see our meetings there and I follow the meetings I was very blessed I have my new year I was in the course of the meetings I took a lot of notes to the Brotherhood preached I don't know his name but one brother preached so well and I was so blessed I took a lot of notes and I praise the Lord for a good spirit like this for people like this who are really helping to project the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may God bless him indeed it's not blessing is blessing in deep but that's very important indeed that is in the reality of it that blessing should be given to him want to thank him for a wonderful wife a wonderful mother and wonderful children who are not a disgraced to their parents who have also stood by their father and embracing the message preaching the message leaving the message and collaborating with their father for the success of the Gospel may God bless his entire family in the name of Jesus I'm telling you I won't even think of coming here I'm honest I was I was I even negotiated with that young man directly lead me I want to sleep I was broken we had worked so hard so hard but he was interested in seeing me with his pastor brother McGarry I give all of you once more in the name of Jesus I bring your greetings from Cameroon uh many Braden asked me to greet and salute wherever I go let me share Christian love with them by the grace of God and move around in a few countries in Africa go to other places times to Congo we go to Ivory Coast we go to Nigeria we are running around the place encouraging the children of God and we are happy that the message which excuse me which God revealed to you in America is on fire in Africa now those Africans have seen that this message is authentic is from God and they are very concerned with the progress of the message is there no world clock here you don't have a clock okay great all right I'm not seeing you it's okay I have my I'll use my Watch because I know we I'm from a place we have a presently there's a war in our country the English people those who are English-speaking want to separate from the French speaking so in the section where I walk where I live it's because I work in both sections we preach in English and French but where I live in the angrophone section we hold meetings a bit early because we cannot afford to run around in the night so when I come I come to America and I see people coming to church maybe at seven and it's it's something a bit new for me of recent it's not it has not been the best for us tough but God has been our helper I was here more than five years ago and since then to come out of the place I could not because I had I was very concerned with my children the churches and so forth you have to hang around there because you don't know what can happen but the war is subsiding in the way not that maybe some Mondays we don't even we just call it ghost towns you know nobody goes out you just stay at home it's it's not easy but God is helping us and I thank God for all of you so we it's not because Pastor said time is we are we have not I will not exaggerate because I know many of you are tired you are just from your Thanksgiving holiday and many people are going back to work tomorrow so I think I just let me do something essential that can edify all of us so um I know what I know what I'm supposed to do when I come to a church which is in all of these a lot of because I happened I was telling the pastor to one of the churches which I am I'm pastoring is full of people from different churches not denomination different beliefs in the message so people who believe this or believe that we I have one one of those churches is a church which is let me call it a Cosmopolitan Church in terms of Doctrine so I have to at some point I felt the Lord warning me in my mind and telling me they are coming to your church your job is to most most of them come as students we are it's a university town so we have a very big English-speaking University a many people come in and those students who come in need a place to Fellowship so most the pastors direct most of them to me because I happen to be at least the Elder so when they come the Lord lead on my mind that as they are coming they should not go back Sinners because you were insisting on one Doctrine or teaching this one and you are confusing them you stay in the middle Let each and every one of them maintain their faith until they go back so I'm very very careful when I you know incorporate in a system like that one you must know what you say because there are so many things to say you don't need to drag this will be a fanatic but when I'm said if the devil cannot remove what you have from you what you believe you take what you have and make of you a fanatic and I think fanatism is a very dangerous activity and I like I just enjoyed I was telling the pastor that I was so happy the way this morning he just in a very pastoral manner handled and talked to his people I was I was so impressed if I even if I was going away with just what he was saying I was I thank God for a man like this there's a lot of wisdom you need a lot of wisdom to lead people a lot of wisdom to go about in situations and I think your pastor is very mature to handle situations and to encourage you people to stabilize you and to have a wonderful church so I'm glad to be in a media which is balanced which is but there's no fanatism there's no exaggeration where people are just wise and are careful very careful because we are walking in somebody's Vineyard and for him to create the church for Jesus okay I'm okay okay for Jesus to create the church he had to give his blood he died for this business this business called church is the business of Jesus Christ he did not invest money to do this business he didn't buy gold and King and and sold it or whatever no he gave his blood he died for this and because of the value of what he did we must be respectful we must speak with the fear of God we must live with the fear of God because it took God what you cannot imagine sacrifice to save one of us here you me and all the brothers so the Church of God is a wonderful place and we have to all of us maintain the church with the fear of God the love of God when I came to since I got here I've been talking a bit about something very simple well I don't know whether it's I don't know how I can call it I've been very interested in the world Ministry Ministry I shared it a lot in Tampa which tried to share in uh uh Acuna we went to Ministry and it all started with a verse that we can read we know very well in the book of the song of Solomon it's a love story and Solomon was talking about he said my Ministry I'm not taking good care of it it is it's a just let's see if we can't get to that it will help us a bit the rest of it is not what I've just that part that aspect that that particular part of the verse I was it I was so interested in that said what is that again just the Song of Solomon 9 4 5. okay just a minute please all right so what where are we it should be this chapter one verse 6. it's just part of just the last part of verse six not the entire verse he said but mine own Vineyard have I not kept my own Vineyard and this morning I was so impressed at the end of his preaching our brother was explaining to us that at some point God had to call up the prophet because the Holy Ghost had to continue the work to call on you to call on me ask us to come in and the meditating on this I discovered that he did not call us were not called to to build an altar around or to adore him he did not call us because we live in the D that people like to exalt other people on other people in such a way that they disappear under those people they themselves have no meaning for their life they are nothing and I became afraid of one thing we can be so eloquent about the balance works with message and so forth and we finally are nothing we are just historians we are just storytellers we Master a lot of wallabana we know little or nothing about ourselves as if it was all about Ghana alone maybe Branham and his children was all about him it was all about you that's why he sent the prophet to awaken you to remind you that you two are authorities in the service of God so I said I said my own portion so I have a portion which I can call a Ministry which is my responsibility so what then I asked what is say about this and I want you to the message his whole message about our the position of the Believers in Christ that's a whole message on its own and I said about this and I looked into a wonderful quotes of brother whatever said he said recognize your ministry just when I get away from this I was very close to the mic okay whatever said recognize have all the goods but I don't want to be long recognize your ministry just as Jesus recognize his ministry I said well this is too big see I must recognize my Ministry just as Jesus recognized his ministry I you sister brother all of us God does not call people for calling sick God calls people because he wants to attribute to them responsibilities two things first one I was saying that the tendency of human beings is the one called elevates a man you easily begin to adore him then you disappear under his ministry you become nothing and you are complexed you have a complex well I love what David said David said I Praise You Lord because I am a marvelous creature you don't see the marvels of God in your life you don't see the wonders of God in your life I was preaching one time in Ivory Coast and I got to I told the Brethren there I said there's a problem in on this Earth people don't believe their testimonies excuse me people don't believe their testimonies oh but I saw myself I was preaching I saw I was doing this I saw I saw you have been seeing all those things but do you believe what you see your brother did not believe all the strange things God was revealing to him you will not be seated while you are sitting belief is not an easy exercise it's very easy when it is already done when somebody has accomplished it then you come pressing that person and you refuse to know that Jesus gave a clean parable he said when he called the people it distributed to them talents he gave them everybody something to do that is why when you go to many churches you see that the weight is very much on the pastor maybe some Deacons maybe some other Christians were but the majority are just nice people in the church who are nice who are well seated but they do nothing about what they are supposed to do they don't even know who they are you don't even know that they matter they don't even know that they have their responsibility my own portion my responsibility I've not taken care what I'm supposed to do I'm not executing anything first of all I don't even know what I am I don't even know where I'm going just a matter of I believe the message I love the prophet I'm in The Message Church my pastor is brother magary very good address but I'm sorry you don't know why you are here you don't know why he sent you to Dallas he would have sent you to Minnesota or somewhere Dakota anyway sent you here for a purpose for a program and he's asking you to recognize it's all a matter of recognizing that sea Jesus recognized why God sent him here and for me not to forget I I'm thinking of something when somebody turned around and told complained to Jesus there is no no no no no no God forbid you are not going to die you don't you know how it is to touch current when you put your hand on current look at the reaction of Jesus get away from me Satan it was prompt it was hard it was direct you know why he touched the central team of why Jesus was on this Earth because if he did not die there will be no church like this one there'll be no denomination there'll be nothing there'll be nothing he came for that purpose he came to save me he came to save you and somebody turning to tell him that you should not die God forbid that you die his reaction was prompt I'm strong because he knew and he recognized that have been sent here this man is just touching what I would like the word in French that they say in French somewhere you are touching the what matters to me my life asking me not to go to the cross he recognized that that is being here was for a goal and they missed the prophet is asking you I have the coaches he should be here somewhere here how all those quotes about asking you to recognize you your position Who You Are if you ask many of you who are seated there who are you here you you have your very small address and they kept asking John the Baptist who are you see I am The Voice of the one who's kinded I am that's my address many of us have no address that's why we are caught in this other verse that I read in the book of Peter where he sees we find you meddling put in your hands in other people's matters you are playing a role which is not yours you occupying the post which is not your post what results can you have what good can you produce because you're not doing what you're supposed to do that when we the Bible talks of you are seated in Heavenly places he's talking about your position in Christ is the message about your position because we have a lot of inactive Christians we have a lot of visiting Christians we have a lot of people who have who are just deaf for being sick it's not a matter of being in one church or the other she here's let me read this one Believers position let me read at least this one now what a man in the Old Testament a Jewish man in Palestine where there was whatever he was the tribe of Joseph Ephraim what excuse me whatever it was he hard he's own loted grounds that belonged to him Old Testament you are Ephraim you are whatever explained it is inconformity with the Bible because those those modest every child that they put forth they gave that child a name which was correspond which corresponded to a special lot a special place in Palestine so when Moses Joshua was placing them he had no difficulties with knowing that what's your tribe what's your name oh great this is the place you are fishermen This one belongs to you you are Neftali this is your own Zone you are this confirming that those people went to their lord I was preaching in uh in in we're talking in Oklahoma altitude you don't go to some other places a lot it's all a matter all of Christianity all of belief is a matter of God removed you from there get you out and send you back Adam fell God removed him from There He sent Jesus to take us back he carried the Jews those Jews he said told Abraham I'll take them you are here now but I'll remove them from this place I'll take them there and I'll bring them back the whole exercise of Christianity all this activity that God is carrying out is a matter of removing you from where you were and bring you back to that place and there's a process that brings you back and you're going back to where you're supposed to be there is no mixture there's no disorder in the house of God I say no disorder everybody no and the prophet is even he goes further to say that you don't already know your position you fight for your position you defend your position it's not a matter of a church we are talking about the body of Christ not a matter of this local assembly you know to think that we have come here no no no no no we're talking to the children of God who are supposed to know exactly what God expects of them but God Express of you in your ministry I repeat your ministry you know at some point where I talk so much we talked about some good men of God in our country we encourage the borders and then I saw all you discovered that everybody is just there well and these are the good people we are there we just be worshiping and thanking God Elijah the prophet to bring back the hearts of the children to their fathers so when he finished his job God said you come and rest I'll continue with my children and this Holy Spirit himself has been going round and calling the children of God one after the other you see the wonderful work of the holy spirit is going around the world himself it's not a matter of somebody brought me to the message somebody no it's a seed that the spirit of God is setting hunting and when he comes to you he does not only reveal to you that you're a son of Abraham he also tells you what he expects of you because it is a chain of believers that's why the prophet preached the Seed of Abraham and the Bible says it he told Abraham that your seed will conquer it's not limited to a group of people everybody who thinks that he is a seed he is a Son of God he has that Seed of Abraham you want to go to heaven you want to go to the same heaven like Abraham or you must do the same exercise like Abraham I'm sorry to tell you you will not pretend there and go and eat from Abraham's suffering you must fight it and what does God do God gives you a promise God speaks to you God gives you a position to defend God gives you a responsibility to execute we are in the church some people think well this is what I might get his business well well well well no sir we are all implicated we are all commanded to do what we are supposed to do there's no visitor here you are Sons and Daughters of God invited by God to bring your contribution that is why Pastor Paul wrote to Philemon so I know about this is so put that on my account or but we hear about your love May your contribution be effectual that is not reaching to fill your head is reaching to provoke you is to it's written to to push you to get to work that's why it is written he said it say may your contribution you see the minister is not competition this one wants to preach so that they will know that he knows more he has more quotes and so this that's not the problem the ministry is is not competition it's contribution everybody has a contribution to make pair what God has told you don't say you're a woman you cannot don't say you have this color you cannot don't say because you're in Dallas you cannot my friend don't say because I'm not in my country well I'm just here I'm like no sir stop that you don't see that it's a matter of the general Body of Christ no matter where you find yourself no matter the country in which you are you're supposed to exercise the ministry that God has given you what does he say here whatever says but God has just begun to my humble opinion to adopting his sons positionally calling them out to one side giving them a certain Ministry anointing them for that purpose the purpose for which you are born is not the same for which I'm born the purpose that we are we are in for which we are in Dallas is not the same for all of us anointing them for that purpose and sending them out what what happened what happens when he does God has started calling them asking them to come he wants to dispatch them he wants to send them he wants to use them and you keep are you asking me already if I'm a woman do I have a Ministry it's all about preaching brother explains those things we have the court here he said you're a housewife it's a Ministry you are you are a doctor maybe it's your ministry maybe whatever is and he calls it a Ministry in Christ surprisingly you are a farmer is there I have the quote even because the Bible goes as far as teaching us that in the book of First God this is not to encourage the Pentecostal system but this is exactly what the Bible says it's not it's not the Pentecostal Bible it's our Bible and he sees here what does he say in First Corinthians chapter 12 what does he say here Clean and Clear he says um should have it somewhere verse there should be verse chapter 12 verse 28 and God has set some in the church first apostles secondly Prophets deadly teachers after that miracles he has said some in the church then Gifts of gifts of healings helps all of us in the world help in the plural but I'm surprised this when he comes it helps am I seeing well that's it let's see it's not all governments diversities of tongues is not only I had the five-fold Ministries for people to make offense until they are the super people it's already they who are working for God the others are there to be clapping a lot I'm not accompanying anybody to have I'm I'm accomplishing my responsibilities as I'm going to that place because I don't want to be a worker of iniquity when you get to that place they'll ask you they ask you to do this you do not do it they ask you to do that what do you do they gave you instructions and gave you the rules they told you what to do there can be no traffic jam traffic jam between us were different everybody is different and we are different in our attributions we are different in our activities we are different the expectation of God for me is not the same as you what God wants to get from you it's not it's not my problem I cannot execute all of the word of God I can only do and do very well the work the job my job description as a servant of God you are a wife you are somebody's wife there is a job description for that responsibility you are a teacher there is a job this option for that I'm talking about your ministry not not my own I don't know what God has asked you to do helps is it helps governments and that is why the church is suffering because you may have the the necessary blessing that this man needs you see when you take your telephone and you are calling somebody who's next to you surprisingly that call first goes to the satellite goes right up there before he lands on that person next to you and that's how it happens in many of our churches because you have the blessings of somebody in your pocket you have the help of somebody in your hand you have something that God has asked you to do bless my brother McGary you have the money to support the work of God you are blessing him we are talking through the satellite when you satellite you know what you're supposed to do when you carry out your responsibility because it is your responsibility observe yourself there is something that you do that makes somebody happy and there are many other things that you are trying to do that bring confusion into your life because it's not your ministry it's not your job people have carried all take big big titles he's a doctor of the world he's the teacher he you you what do you encumber yourself why do you torment yourself that thing doesn't resemble you the prophet was preaching you better you take your broom and sweep this house perfectly you have the same salary like a pastor you don't need to you don't need to take off somebody which is not yours said don't be found as a murderer oh Peter I like that your text soon I like this device I love so much I use it in many situations first Peter again let me just read it I love it wasn't none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil Doer oh as a busy body in other men's matters it's not your matter you're not concerned what you are talking about it you are meddling in people's things in order mess is that your matter is that your job how many people appreciate you when you do what you're doing there are you at the right position yes my brother it's a challenge it's difficult for us to begin to see and if we go as far when we read the message is preaching about perfection and he's talking about the bride that has to pray and the dead will rise do you think our responsibility is a small one do you think we have been called for calling sick just to be here and be quoting your own Lord your own person how clean is it how well kept is it what you're supposed to do maybe nobody has ever challenged you well I'm here to challenge you or you think that because you are young you're a young man as you are but David was a young man maybe younger than you I put one message sometime David became king at the age of 30. read your Bible Well which means that all those great victories that David had he had them before 10 was a child but he purposed ah somebody purposed in his mind his name was Daniel he told himself I'll do it if you think it's all about reading what brahavana said saying what barabalam did and whatever it's more than that it's more than that God is expecting a church which is Desiring to continue the ministry of William Branham your evil remain only at the level of our head our head they are mocking at us out there say you people believe a good message you have a great prophet you have you have you have true we have a great prophet but his products are not great I'm sorry don't be annoyed these products are very good at literature and the Bible is clear the letter killed it but the spirit gives life you are claiming a great prophet you are you are we were all very good we love that and you we are all these goliaths challenging us cancer all these sicknesses all these satanic powers and the sons of Saturn are glorifying themselves they're showing us on television there are great weapons that they are making they are showing us how they are destroying they have the capacity to send 10 000 miles they have this and have this what can the church show off what do you have on devils are controlling the world divorce builds are removing the clothes from our children's bodies devils are obliging human beings to go man to man woman to woman we see an eloquent Saturn proud devils where are the sons and daughters of God where are they they are quarreling in churches the best we have in the message is you are like this I am like this you are like this condemning one another hatred the whole place everybody wants to prove to his congregation that I am better than that that's a long day go to our countries it is still we have great churches and great hatred Lord of evil and wickedness you don't talk with brother one two three is somebody's name that is down and you are discussing the brother and you're speaking evil about you why is the church not strong because you are not people are not going about the business they are supposed to do if you are doing what you're supposed to do he's doing he's doing he's doing everybody is doing his own part of it the church will be strong I said strong your deep prayer it's not a Ministry that God can give a woman or a man Lord told my wife when she was young at some point they refused to send her to school so she got annoyed okay that she's going okay the answer to pray she will not she will not pray whoa they just presented her hair and showed her how they were moving people using some strong some kind of wreck or something and selling them there so you'll be one of them she went back the father said go and praise her I will not pray the winter showed her again to tell her that God was asking her to be a woman of Prayer now I I love I love what Samuel said Samuel said it is true you are spoken against me it is true you have you have you have is that also but God forbid that I stop praying for you it's my job you served me I pray for you don't deserve me I pray for you it's my job it's also a responsibility it's a Ministry you can change a lot of things in this church by your name but if I don't give a testimony of a boy and a girl he said if I have every any success I have here there are two people behind there who have been fasting and praying for me they didn't opt to come and be preaching with brother they said they sat and they're at their little spot there and they were making prayers and they were putting anointing and they were and whatever was moving and he knew you see they are praying for me oh I love your calm it's very important he said he has set you know what it means to set look at look at how these drums are set see how the organ or whatever all this everything here is set you're set in his church you come to America you enjoy the way things are set you go to the deepest part of America you see the houses they have their normal toilet the small restaurant the churches are well kept they follow all the principles set she had to set the light when they said they said stop you stop or eat this one body which has got disorder is the body of Christ I'm sorry to tell you people don't know where they are standing people don't know what role they are playing people don't know what contribution God is expecting from them you don't know so the church you have all you see all of this is well said in America all the churches were set but your minds are not well set sorry to say that the reason is simple if we were all of us were well sick and we know very well that sister this has got a special gift of healing for example this brother has got special Financial blessing there are things we [Music] the person knows that when I desire something excuse me in this light I know the person to talk to when their sisters a situation like this we know who can always easily easily carry out the responsibility you know but this resembles him God has given him the means to do that if I support our prayer I know in my various churches who is the prayer Warrior who are The Prayer Warriors I know them I don't come about and say brother I need some special prayers no I call one two three I know that those are the people once you call them and they go on their knees God listens to them because it's their job is the responsibility those who are there to receive messages from God We Are Spiritual Church after everything eh following the message you have Pillar of Fire it's not a simple thing it's God himself in the church and you're standing there so we Are Spiritual Church we don't undermine those things because God speaks continues to speak God has not abandoned the church to itself is still active and he wants to carry out his work but if you're a coach just imagine I don't know you will play What football here we play soccer a lot of soccer that's what I know about you are the coach of the team and in the game you know the person who give you the goal or the goals you know that in this my team this is my this is my Joker how you place him there you place this one day you place a coach the job of the coach is to please his people where they can deliver the goods where they can bring the success into the camp when the gay man who is supposed to deliver this is soccer this is not a I don't know you're very used to your football here which I don't understand that your own is complicated but this is soccer in soccer you always have the ninth yes when they give you that nine jersey it means that all of our hope is on you to put so no matter what you're playing everybody is directing the ball towards the the master I will not call any names here but some of you follow football you know what I'm talking about you know the Mastermind the man who knows his only thing the only thing he has God in his head I want to enter that goal I want to deal with cannot be at the back I want to go and put a goal so if the coach send the goalkeeper well you have to defend your post and you're running from Pillar To Post you're running for you abandon your post you expose your goalkeeper because you are not where you are supposed to be you are even jealous because each time there is a girl you saw the name of the person who made it exactly like in the day of of David he put the goal but he did not put the goal for himself he put it for Israel the work he did brought honor and glory to the entire Kingdom but the King was jealous you are not the you are not the you are not the one to do everything you're not a Superman God has placed other people to carry out various responsibilities and you have to tell them and don't forget you are accountable you will pay your render account for what you are supposed to do and you didn't do it oh I believe the message the message and so I love the story of of of of of of of Daniel he read the books the the the the books of pastor Pastor Jeremiah Jeremiah prophesied prophesied prophesied when the time came he took upon himself I said no you know the matter of Jeremiah I said but I was saying something today about this a lot it's a lot of some work for every generation I heard something like that is it correct said to every generation he said something like that got a lot a word to every period there is something that you have to do and all those living in that period have their role different roles to pray for the accomplishment of what God has said and you're one of them living in this critical moment where the third wall where bombs are moving around the place under normal circumstances the church has to be on its knees and everybody on position because the battle is strong our enemy the Bible says when the devil raises as a storm Rises as a storm God something like that he says God raises [Music] I say you you are the standard you are the people who are supposed to give meaning to the message we love you when you as you know it very we are happy you read it you meditate it some have gone as far as saying that they won't don't want to listen to preachers they don't want anything my friend so the only Ministry that is remaining now is just listening if that's all that we have to do the word we can what we congregate it's not possible faith comment by hearing the world not the world not the word of Christ Christ means Spirit revelation was saying in the morning and where are the men of God where are the preachers doing their job where are the Christians saying pastor stop that's my charge that's my program you can understand this when brother was preaching someday ah 6 45 I'll be on time who I preaching once someday and he was preaching there was a woman seated somewhere and that woman was got laid upon her to pray for a certain child I should start there free footage prayers this one is breaking praying for that child she goes to a point where she could no longer bear the pressure of the voice so she said Madam sister can I pray for your child so you go ahead and she prayed and the child go well instantly was in front I would say there's a woman there this is what happened what what what what happened so they tell you A woman has nothing to do nothing to do a woman can have a gift of healing all those gifts are possible those nine gifts that God can give to anybody this is the sacred place where we cannot admit a woman to stand here to talk to us but there's so many things that great women have done in the Bible I said great women there was a woman this Sunnah my woman saw the prophet coming and it bothered her to see that this man of God had to go from hotel to hotel coming to the town he's going to places eating small restaurant and whatever she told her husband let's find a place for this man she did it the husband said yes and you know the story I cannot I cannot talk too much about that then the day the prophet wanted to thank her or to say something good to her they did not call on the husband to show up they did not say call that couple we want to know they call that woman she was the one who was invited and she stood at the door excuse me and they told her you next year you will carry a baby you it was the product of her feet it was the grace that she received because she did what was correct what she was supposed to do read your Bible very well what happened to Dorcas this wonderful woman giving clothes helping supporting she will not say well all the brothers in the church who are problems he does the one of the pastor she was a woman observing how the sister is coming to church one pair of shoes all this while look at the other sister she doesn't have any dresses give to this shoe give to give and she died and the people said oh God she will not be buried I want to remind you your works will speak for you one day the things that trouble no Lord Somebody went as far as reminding God you cannot kill me I've done my job you're not kill me go and tell him that he's going to die you are going to diagnose his sister no God you cannot did he win the case did he win the case God said well I have no choice this man is correct he has been faithful he has done what he's supposed to do he has carried out his responsibility he will not die adding 15 years the same God who said you will die same God in the face in the face of the realities of what he has done put that sentence down we will keep we postpone it that one is he has won the case against me and here you are let me tell you we love brothers and sisters somebody said in the Bible I used to see uh when we go back at home you write the right when somebody's dead they write the program of the burial and the right under he has fought a good fight so so he don't worry about him he's going to heaven which fight did he fight because you want to please him the man who wrote that he has fought a good fight actually fought a good fight listen Paul was testifying himself I'm sorry to tell you Paul was testifying himself Samuel told the people of Israel say you who can stand to see that I have taken his wife I have taken his goat his what look at some point you must give account of what you have done with your life I'm sorry to tell you it's a bit hard you give it you'll give it I'm not saying the day of judgment already here you'll give it spend your money anyhow you live anyhow anyhow you get to a point where you are blocked and God is asking you give her your account nobody can testify you more than yourself nobody can because you know oh every time in English huh book of record no it's not much Book of Records is something that it is is they give you what you're supposed to do everything that you're supposed to do for example and your itinerary something like that you know what what has been expected of you all this why everything that you're supposed to do you have told you you know how far have you gone in the accomplishment of what is written there concerning you and so hey Paul could write see I afford a good fight he fought a good fight because when God called him God told him oh you would be my apostle you have to suffer for me you do this you do this he gave him a clean a job description of what is what is what was expected of him he knew and whatever said in the message somewhere in demonology he says do what God tells you to do no matter what all the prophets see nobody knows better about what you're supposed to do than yourself you know too well you know how much you have been running away from your responsibility you know you know how much of that responsibility you have accomplished you know you know your laziness of us waiting for you for you he listen he who does the work of God with negligence is a brother of the Destroyer you are the brother of Satan I hope I'm not wounding your church he who is the Bible and it's not me it's proverb he who does the work of God with the negligence is a brother to the Destroyer that's hard they're giving you a job to do they told you the purpose of your life they tell you what they're expecting of you your God and your creator and you take it with every negligence of yours you undermine it would have given me a better job and I would like to be like why don't you make me you will never be that brother you don't resemble even two twins are different everybody Hallelujah everybody is unique in your futures in everything you are alone and your faith also is individual when they call you they tell you you know very well maybe they talk to you in a dream go talk to you through the Bible and whatever said in this in the message read your name in the scriptures read the portion of the scriptures that make mention of you I'm talking of the scriptures Bible when the alarms Book of Life in the in the word of God you know you're hurting to do some business business business did you see that in the things that concern you have you ever seen anything concerning business in your life I see Brothers doing we have done a lot of foolish mistakes in our lives what I do in this world let me also do he doesn't concern you why are you meddling why are you going to other people's matter he is a businessman that resembles him that's his nature he is he's created in such a way that when he's doing business he's just natural go and force yourself into that God you'll be taking loans from here money from places very soon you're all you start comparable things are very tight very tired how do you get there how did you find yourself in the tight corner how did you find yourself who took you there jealousy invitation wanting to be like like this other brother no sorry to say it you think everybody wants to go to America you see all the brothers out there they're making papers did you ever see yourself in America do you have any proof somehow some indicate let me see even an indication that that showed you somehow when I see brothers so when he comes back here he's so good his family is fine and you can be fine and very fine where you are presently you can make wealth without traveling if God decides to bless you he can bless you anywhere anyhow when he knows that is my son understands why I'm going to give him money he understands why I'm putting all these dollars in his pocket not for his glory not for his honor but for the advancement of the kingdom of God and he says there is no Ministry for your good only for you is for the common good is for the people how many people are happy because of you how many faces have you put a smile on in your life how many people are glad because you exist when you pass many people praise God because you're on this Earth how many you are indifferent to people you are wicked you you just live anyhow you want God you but when I said at some point that if the pastor is happy God who is happy is that not very strong but if even the pastor doesn't appreciate you where are you what are you worth what are you doing what will I do in the question is what I do on Earth right here why are you here Jesus came he knew why he was here he lived for that Daniel knew why he was here he sacrificed the meat of Babylon he sacrificed the wine of Babylon he sacrificed he knew that I'm here because I'm supposed to prepare the going back of these people to that back to our land and because of that purpose that he had in his mind God looked at this this man marries and a visit from heaven and just also go and visit him and he visited him God will visit you when you do what you're supposed to do God will bless you Sister when you are executing to the letter your job performance what you're supposed to do and there is no there is no traffic you and me can never have any competition because everybody has got his own share and a definition of exactly what God is expecting from him I'm talking about you that's why today we are there's a lot of soccer in Qatar and so forth and they are talking about oh this big player oh this one sometimes get basket or players I want to I want to stop soon great basketball players came from America they were playing Angola those angulans has said I will not call any of them yeah I'm sorry they knew about these great people and they were changed according to them to play with it instead of playing the basketball they were admiring the Great hey play the game you will not play the game you had marry those Great America they were playing Angola so for them already just the fact that they were on the same stadium with these people it was such a greeting so you you don't play again you're oh whoa girl you touch That's What It Is Well you see it with brother I'll tell you oh so it's a man of God he's a powerful man of God there is no powerful man of God more than yourself I want to hear you say Amen admire yourself admire the definition that God has given you in your life admire the position that God has given you to occupy God has honored you by giving you a position amen you're honored you're honored Brothers she says you're honored if the president of America happens to appoint somebody here in in whatever thing in Dallas all of Dallas will hear about it everybody would like to go and meet him and give him a handshake you you think that the appointment of God is the one that you have to to minimize you have to to to to to to to look down on you have to to to to refuse to consider you think to be an elect of God it's a position that you can buy it's only the blood of Jesus that has made you what you are for you to be what you are God himself have to climb on the cross God himself to give you a position [Applause] God himself because of you as he was climbing he was calling your name [Music] he was calling your name when you become a Christian you think is the list of a position that a man can occupy some of you think being Christians is just something that you do because you lost you have nothing to do in life I have seen in my country some people they are fighting to be pastors fighting to be Apostle fighting because that's where they want they will have their own Glory all night since in the world nobody's seeing me after business nothing have done politics nothing so and now I just infiltrated and then I am I'm in every election in the church senior uh this advice out to the pastor this and there are four star in front at least I'm feeling that I'm something now he feels that is something because people are clapping you think that God Jehovah takes the Pains of calling you my son God the creator of Heaven and Earth gives you a position we were saying it yesterday down in Altus the position that you are fighting for Moses abandoned them because Moses knew that his position was not in this house with these beautiful women naked every one of them wants me to get married to her my name is Moses this doesn't resemble me this is not my Ministry being the son of pharaoh is not my Ministry the Bible says he considered a better position to suffer with no slaves out there than to remain in the glory of Egypt with the sin for a short time it's for a season I would use this for a season one day somebody was bearing another one it was a barrier somewhere and somebody said something interesting he said he said you see when two people are talking they say do you know who I am hey they challenge me he said just wait I'll show you who you are he went down somewhere and picked some ground and this is what you asked that's what you are dust you know where I am but don't try that with a Christian because it's covered by the blood of Jesus in Africa people take names of other people to go to witch doctors to go and make charms against them to do evil against them but be careful don't call the name of a Christian once you call the name of the Christian the tell you what have you done this is blood Hallelujah the honest is blood can we clap for Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus I say the blood of Jesus my friend you are protected you are blessed and when you are in the line of duty simple understand there is an angel standing by you I want to hear better amen another amen the angel of the Lord comforted by those who fear God and we see the American president is going somewhere motor kid motor kid motor kid soldiers bombs guns everywhere my friend I don't need any of that you don't need any of that he says you were close by you an angel you know what an angel is go and ask those those syrians when they came fighting Israel and the colonists today with all his guns and his ammunition and everything and the angel told him a true story the war 1967. and when you went back somebody asked him how did you retreat with all these soldiers that you had he said my friend what I saw what I saw you asked me to continue I saw an angel starting with this one that same position is your position every devil fighting you will see the angel of the Lord was landing on your roof entering into your business you have total Security in Jesus name I repeat Total Security [Music] but he can challenge you I know what I'm talking about verbalam said go to Africa you'll meet witchcraft crude not witchcraft crude witchcraft crude hear what I'm saying good you are preaching in the public whatever somebody just by the corner he's testing his magic on you some other one is standing there he's sending a snake to you not it's not it's not a vision real stories say when you are going there prepare well before you go you will meet it but in all of that for 43 years we have gone from danger to danger danger to Danger he has been faithful at every stage he has pulled us out of Danger full out of danger here they want to poison you you're out of the danger they're their food poison on the road on the road for it to smash and die you are the spirit of God is setting fire live on that stupid thing burning it wow what is happening fire there are things brother all you need to be doing what you're supposed to do you only need to be in the post which you are supposed to occupy and Joseph knew that all of my brother's future is in my hands and a rolling woman on the bed naked rolling on the bed naked sorry that is not in my performance document you are not part of it I'm sorry madam I cannot betray my race I cannot betray my cause don't come here you see you're a Christian today he's falling tomorrow he's coming he's with women tomorrow is smoking after his worldwide man you don't know what you are doing brother you don't know you are dreaming you are just joking if you value what God has made of you you're not allow you young sisters any Tom and dig to put his hand on your shoulder no we cannot because you know what you are what the purpose of your life and Joseph knew that he needed excuse me he needed to stay right because all his father and mother all his brothers dependent depended on him in you that if he comes here and he forgets himself in the house of potiphar with Potiphar's wife and all of this he will not walk talking to all the young people here in America you have all kinds of Television all kinds of Seduction all kinds of evil all kinds of things but you are not born for that that's not the purpose of which God sent you here that's what that's not what God made you an American he made you an American that you can also support the work of William Marion Branham he was an American like you because your brother and God told him no alcohol don't soil yourself because I have a great program for you and that same message that he gave to brother is the same to you he has a purpose he had not called you to join the message just to come here and say well I cannot stay in the house let me at least go and no no no you have a contribution to make you have something to do and we are saying let your contribution be effectual effectual is coming from the word effect let somebody let your neighbor feel the effect of your Christianity let your family feel the effect of your Christianity Let the church feel the effect of your Christianity that's the recommendation Paul was giving Philemon but God wrote it in the Bible so it becomes your recommendation too it applies to you it applies to you and I repeat as I'm going to end how many people are happy because you're on this Earth how many how many tell me how many people are joyful because they see you if they hear that you are sick how many people are they playing Lord he's so good to me he's such a nice man he's a wonderful person let him not die but if you're alive is Tainted with wickedness right that fool let him go [Music] you see there are names that when they call in church people are spontaneous in their in their reaction you say well that one does he come to church you see a brother he's a Christian but they're people whose testimonies within us amongst us I saw that we don't play with them at some point they begin to say oh Pastor is showing favoritism no it's not favoritism it's simply that this man's works his life he doing so well I was talking to we're talking about uh what are Moses we're talking a while ago about the the pastor's wife and what did you not tell me I was so happy for our testimony great things there are people whose perfume you like to smell and whose presence you like to be with their people even when you see them from a distance you disappear because once you meet the understand those the whole stories did we hear again uh London went to Paris Paris was how was that they Define me he said a Ministry this woman who came to barabbana shot and said after the meeting she completed she said oh thank you thank you thank you for what yes what's all this thanking me for he said she is the greatest gossiper in the neighborhood she thanked you because you did not touch her in the course of the preaching let me tell you people know you don't don't think that as you're walking around people don't know you they know you you don't even need to talk just the way you are walking people know you the way you live your life people know you and the life of Philemon Paul knew about it I've heard we know about the love that you are manifesting towards the Christian I can ask you a favor please if this man owes you put it on my account Paul was not only dealing spirituality with people he was also dealing with money with his quote whatever things he was doing it John wrote he said I've heard about this other man on a scene or whatever that man was see and your trip or whatever so we know we know he's the one blocking the burden when they want to come to that church we know foreign she blocks me bad testimony sorry their names are there he said I will not go again with with Barnabas because with the John John Mark somebody right because he abandoned us somebody because of the love of the world they know their names are there now it is not the past in reality we have those same people again in the church who are disturbing the work of God who are slowing down the activities of the spirit they refuse to do their work they refuse to carry out their responsibility and they want to do some other thing you go nowhere with that God will not bless you know one thing you have every blessing when you're doing what you are supposed to do you have all the backing of Heaven behind you hmm say Amen don't fear you have it you're working in very under very good conditions here we walk in rude conditions I have a car a double cabin it breaks down every one week I'm in the garage I'm in there each time I want to step out I'm going one hour journey to our journey I have to go and consult the mechanics tied this boat tied that one but I want to tell you something you get to the road those fun bears and whatever at some point they just got caught they got at every moment every day I have a problem there is a mechanic around the corner to help me it's not one time it's not two times not three times not ten times is a life of his own every time I step on and the thing decides to disturb us again that is somebody handy to say leave that vehicle that you can go I'll take care in the worst of places difficult places in the world one day I was going to bury a brother who died in Paris I will go with my wife I will go to a certain Hill what do you want me to do I put the thing that I looked at the whole thing I did not understand and somebody said no no no no no they said they say guys or somebody there's a local garage or some funny funny stuff [Music] and I went to that place got there at 10 am next day I wrote drove back to my place more than 250 kilometers because that small mechanics touching touching touching touching God is faithful and he's faithful to those who are faithful God is good nobody should tell you that God would he will never never let you down when you are in the line of your responsibility it will never he will be with you excuse me he will reinforce you if you miss money he'll give you the money he will give you if he meets Human Assistance he will send the bill to help you on one condition don't be found doing the wrong thing or studying in the wrong place or doing some other person's business it's not your job for me to conclude listen to this very well let me put my let me put my things so that I don't continue after that listen the act of the Lord the Ark of the Lord was somewhere and David decided to bring it to his where he was he was blessing some other brother and he was a bit hurt like just remove that thing for me let's take it he had a good thought you know what he did he went and looked for a beautiful chariot look for he wanted to carry the child in a very honorable manner according to him so look for chariot and the pudding act on top and they put a man who was not a priest somebody who didn't know about this I'm talking about position I'm talking about the position I'm talking about Ministry position Ministry your lord all of that is one thing to be well listen as they were going you know what they decided to do with that man you know the story took his hand where the ACT is falling before which act is falling to put his hand on the ark and it flushed him excuse that word he died you know I died because it was not so supposed to be carried on a chariot the Ark of the Lord was supposed to be positionally shoulders of the Levites that's his position and not by any Tom and the not any kind of person because of wrong position wrong positioning somebody lost his life don't lose your life we have seen in churches full rise get up and say you Pastor I don't agree with you when they're dead with emergency you're dead I've seen things that I cannot describe to you just somebody gets up and all of a sudden he wants to challenge the pastor he's speaking against the pastor he thinks he's the only one it's in the Bible [Applause] is he the only one sir it's not your job keep away from this man his name is Moses keep away even he his own brother what is he thinking what is not your job and God described to them who Moses was saying you there's two of you when I want to talk to you I use a dream I can talk in a vision for this one when I'm talking to him I take a representation and I talk to him face to face how do you mix yourself in things that don't concern you you know the relationship between God and Moses you know you know how far they have gone to get to this point that they are do you know how far this gentleman has gone to where you are and where you are continue and you are going you just come from nowhere you're just eating his name or whatever discussing talking you don't know what you're saying why'd you meddle in other people's business is that your business does it concern you do your part play your role God will bless you [Music] once more may God bless all of you we want to see a church where everybody is doing his own part everything anything you can do reveal to you for the advancement of the work of God do it and may God bless you in Jesus name shalom [Applause] amen you know I like the gospel that puts flesh on the word amen because that's that's really what it's all about isn't it is the word being made flesh and it's good to hear the way that the work can be made flesh it just come on my heart so much when uh he was talking you know you talk about things that are great in the scripture Paul's going about doing his way of Duty right he thinks he's going to go put all these Heretics in prison where they belong and just so happens on the way there he meets the angel of the Lord and he says who are he says you know I'm Jesus who you persecute you know and Paul was struck blind you know that right and he was taken over to Damascus and so because that's where he was headed so he's sitting in Damascus blind not talking not eating right and then the Lord goes to talk to ananias you know and ananias was just a disciple you know what I mean and I I love the story uh because uh the scripture says and there was a certain disciple at Damascus team ananias and to him said the Lord in the vision ananias and he said behold I'm here Lord he said the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas of one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth and he hath seen a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight here's God working on both ends right and ananias said Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to the Saints at Jerusalem and and here he hath Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name and this is a great story but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my namesake amen you know and then I thought because this has been in my Bible for days and days it says this it says you've got something to do God's got something for you to do hmm you know what message that's out of three kinds of believers the real believer puts the word in flesh the Nate believer keeps it intellectual the unbeliever doesn't listen to it at all I'll finish the paragraph you may have some heartaches and some troubles you must have some he he says you may have some disappointments but do we pray to shun them no Lord take me through them whatever they is whatever it is don't let me escape them if they're set for me just give me Grace to go through that that's all it's not easy to be a Christian yes but I'll tell you something there's no reward like it you cannot give God I don't care you can out give them I can tell you I've put that to test thousands of times you can't out give God and I know about the witch doctor yes I've had him try to slip stones in my pocket past messages to me have little things going uh you don't have to worry about it I like what the brother said fear not little flock that's the scripture we read this morning right fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure yes to give you the kingdom the kingdom Amen Let us be about the father's business amen God bless us this evening enjoyed that brother so very much brother Robson we just appreciate you we appreciate your son Moses we don't get to see him as much as we'd like but we're all praying Moses because I understand you're only half a man right now but one day that wife's gonna come back to be with you and to OB Twain and you'll be a one again yes then we can see the whole Moses standing because a great blessing for us so anyway Moses is waiting for his wife so let's all pray for him let's all Stand Together you love the Lord do

it's about you know I A lot of times you know as a preacher and as a pastor you start looking around at other places and you start comparing yourself and wondering all those things and you flip the Bible open and he says you know your fools to compare yourselves one to another that's a foolish thing amen was it to you if he tarries till I come follow thou me amen every one of you is important don't ever forget that you're important nobody can take your place Paul went through such a great effort to explain to us that we're a body fitted and joined together each member yes supplying the need of the other yes amen which of you can say that you're not the hand or you have no need of the hand or no need of the eye amen who can look at somebody and said I don't need you I need you I got lots of heavy stuff to lift I need you I need you I need your prayer I need your wisdom I need your counsel correct I need your honesty I need your voice can't make it without you how much would you

obligated we're commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel don't be ashamed of this gospel yes like our brother said you stand for him he'll stand for you amen oh I could just go on
