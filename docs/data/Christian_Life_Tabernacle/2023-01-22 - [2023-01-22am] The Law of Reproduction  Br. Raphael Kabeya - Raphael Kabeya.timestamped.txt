[15:12] morning
[15:13] no matter
[15:14] what we've done no matter how far we've
[15:18] gone there's been a blood that was shed
[15:20] for us that we can approach your throne
[15:23] of grace this morning and plead the
[15:24] precious blood of Jesus Christ that's
[15:27] been shed
[15:29] Lord in knowing that it's atoned for our
[15:31] sins and that we have been forgiven
[15:33] we've been Justified Lord as though we
[15:36] never did it in the first place that
[15:38] produces a boldness
[15:40] that we can come and ask you
[15:43] to come Lord move amongst us this
[15:46] morning
[15:47] may we come up into your thinking Lord
[15:50] be on the Realms of man beyond carnal
[15:53] thinking and enter into your thinking

[16:40] Raphael in a supernatural way I know in
[16:42] brother Billy Lord that there would be
[16:44] one voice to your people and we'd be
[16:46] able to look past the Veil
[16:48] and see you Lord speaking to us anoint
[16:50] our ears that we might hear from you

[16:57] amen praise the Lord we'll just ask
[16:59] brother Mike you can be seated
[17:01] and then at the reading of the word we
[17:03] can stand
[17:05] I don't know if as you are walking up if
[17:07] you saw that we we have the forms put up
[17:10] for the slab
[17:12] to tell you what where I'm getting
[17:13] excited
[17:15] as you as you come to the church on
[17:18] Wednesdays and Sundays you're we start
[17:20] to see the slab and the forms being put
[17:22] up so soon and very soon
[17:25] I'd rather for a Rapture but if the Lord
[17:27] tarries
[17:28] but it's going to take all of us
[17:30] together
[17:31] so I know that if you have time on the
[17:33] weekends there's always some cleaning up
[17:35] or some rake or shovel work that could
[17:38] be done it's going to take us as a body
[17:40] so we're just really excited about what
[17:42] God is doing amen
[17:51] morning God bless you
[17:54] know we're going to just keep reading in
[17:55] Psalm 103 this or 105 this morning there
[17:58] was
[18:00] there's a bigger chapter and
[18:02] you know I've just been reading through
[18:04] it and just seems to be full of so many
[18:06] little nuggets at least for me
[18:10] you know we were looking kind of last
[18:12] time at how
[18:14] you know it was a kind of a call to
[18:17] God's people
[18:19] to kind of remember
[18:21] refocus on
[18:23] who they were
[18:24] what they were about as a people
[18:28] you know that uh in an hour when the
[18:31] word
[18:32] and the presence of the Lord had been
[18:34] re-established in their midst
[18:37] you know it was
[18:39] you know a time to come together and
[18:41] just
[18:42] remember to resolve you know we were
[18:45] looking at that last time how at the
[18:46] beginning of each year people set
[18:48] resolutions to get things done within a
[18:50] certain period of time
[18:52] setting time restrictions or time frames
[18:56] of when they're going to complete a task
[18:58] or when they're going to see something
[19:00] done
[19:01] and we were just looking at that maybe
[19:03] how the world works
[19:05] that may be a measure that the world
[19:07] uses but that's not a measure that God
[19:09] uses
[19:11] he isn't a being of time it's all about
[19:14] his word that's his measuring stick and
[19:17] as the people of the word
[19:19] you know how our measuring sticks should
[19:21] be the same
[19:22] it's his word
[19:25] you know and we were just looking at
[19:26] that and there was a statement that
[19:28] David made in Psalm 19 or Psalm 105 19
[19:32] verse 19 that caught my attention
[19:35] and he said this until the time that his
[19:38] word came
[19:40] the word of the Lord Tried Him
[19:43] you know and kind of along those lines
[19:45] the margin in my Bible kind of has it in
[19:47] parentheses this way it says until the
[19:50] time that his word came to pass
[19:54] the word of the Lord tested him
[19:57] you know we're just going to read a
[19:59] small portion of this chapter this
[20:00] morning but you know starting in verse
[20:03] 16 there's just these few verses
[20:06] that talk about the story of Joseph
[20:11] you know we know the story well and
[20:13] you know often brother Branham would
[20:16] draw parallels between the life of
[20:19] Joseph
[20:20] in the life of Jesus
[20:23] you know the path that God had one walk
[20:25] was sort of bearing record to the path
[20:28] that the other would walk
[20:31] now Joseph was a young man who God spoke
[20:34] to
[20:35] concerning himself he got
[20:37] thus saith the Lord that one day he'd be
[20:40] in a position of authority that he would
[20:42] be a leader that he would be a ruler
[20:43] that his own brothers would bow down to
[20:45] him and yet
[20:47] you know his brothers as we know sold
[20:48] him into slavery in Egypt
[20:51] and set Joseph on a journey when he
[20:53] found himself in circumstances
[20:56] he found himself in a condition
[20:58] that was exactly the opposite
[21:01] of what the word had said concerning him
[21:05] couldn't be further removed from the
[21:08] position of authority
[21:10] than being in the bottom of a jail cell
[21:13] in Chains
[21:16] there was a period of time where thus
[21:18] saith the Lord had spoken one thing
[21:21] but the condition he found himself in
[21:24] said something entirely different
[21:27] the word that he had been given was now
[21:30] being used to test him
[21:33] you know and that
[21:36] that tells us a little bit about the
[21:38] timeline of God how
[21:40] God's measuring stick works
[21:43] you know he speaks a word
[21:46] we believe in that word
[21:48] and then there becomes this period of
[21:50] time
[21:51] where we're tested by that same word
[21:54] before that word comes to pass or is
[21:57] manifest
[21:58] in our lives
[22:01] you know there's a word that might be
[22:03] spoken concerning our circumstance or
[22:06] our condition or what we what he sees
[22:08] for us in the word and then we look at
[22:11] our condition and it's exactly the
[22:13] opposite
[22:15] until the time that his word came the
[22:19] word of the Lord Tried Him
[22:23] you know there's every single person on
[22:25] Earth
[22:26] whether they're Believers or not
[22:29] go through hard times
[22:31] whether it's financial trouble whether
[22:34] it's family trouble whether it's
[22:35] sickness whether it's mental trouble
[22:37] everybody has the same challenges but
[22:41] you know the unique thing about the
[22:43] people of God
[22:45] is as they have
[22:47] to look at their experience or their
[22:49] condition and compare that with what the
[22:51] word said about them
[22:53] and that's a different level of trial
[22:58] you know the test is not necessarily the
[23:00] hardship we go through
[23:03] the test is the fact that it is
[23:05] absolutely contradictory to what the
[23:08] word says about us
[23:10] until the time that the word came
[23:13] the word of the Lord Tried Him
[23:17] you know it says in verse 17 of Psalm
[23:19] 105 he sent a man before them even
[23:21] Joseph who was sold for a servant whose
[23:25] feet they hurt with Fetters he was laid
[23:27] in iron
[23:28] and similarly speaking of Jesus in
[23:31] Philip Philippians chapter 2 and verse 7
[23:33] it says but made himself of no
[23:35] reputation
[23:37] and took upon him the form of a servant
[23:39] and was made in the likeness of men
[23:42] and being found in fashion as a man he
[23:44] became obedient unto death
[23:46] even the death of the cross
[23:49] you know earlier in that very chapter it
[23:52] speaks of Jesus being in the form of God
[23:55] who thought himself not robbery to be
[23:57] equal with God
[23:59] you know and there was all kinds of word
[24:01] all kinds of promises and scriptures
[24:03] that spoke of him being a king
[24:06] that spoke of him sitting on the throne
[24:08] of David
[24:09] and yet in spite of that word the
[24:13] condition that he found himself in was
[24:14] that of a servant
[24:16] was that of one who had the reputation
[24:18] of being an illegitimate
[24:20] man from a little town called Nazareth
[24:24] the word said one thing what was
[24:26] manifest was something else at least at
[24:28] the time
[24:29] and he too as it says in Hebrews is
[24:32] tempted in all points like as we are
[24:34] having to walk a path that seems to
[24:37] contradict what the word has said about
[24:39] him
[24:41] you know we know says in James my
[24:44] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[24:46] into diverse Temptation knowing this
[24:48] that the trying of your faith
[24:50] out of your body
[24:51] out of your finances not of your mind
[24:54] but your faith
[24:56] that peace which is thus saith the Lord
[24:58] because Faith cometh by hearing
[25:02] blessed is the man that endureth
[25:04] temptation
[25:06] for when he has tried he shall receive
[25:08] the Crown of Life the timeline of God
[25:12] until the time that the word came the
[25:15] word of the Lord tested him
[25:18] we know how the story of Joseph ended we
[25:20] could we're going to read it here in a
[25:22] second in verse 20 the king sent and
[25:24] loosed him
[25:25] even the ruler of the people and let him
[25:27] go free
[25:28] he made him Lord of his house
[25:31] and ruler of all his substance to bind
[25:33] his princess at his pleasure and teach
[25:35] his Senators wisdom
[25:37] and then it says of Jesus in Philippians
[25:40] 2 wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[25:43] him
[25:44] and given him a name which is above
[25:46] every name wherefore at the name of
[25:48] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[25:51] heaven and things in the earth and
[25:53] things under the Earth you know as he
[25:55] went through that testing time where his
[25:57] condition was contrary to the word the
[25:59] devil tested him with that same thing if
[26:01] you bow to me I'll give you all the
[26:02] kingdoms of the Earth
[26:03] but when he waited for the manifestation
[26:05] of the the word of the Lord not only did
[26:09] he have the kingdoms of the earth that
[26:10] the ones in heaven and the ones beneath
[26:12] the Earth as well
[26:14] you know being tried by the very word of
[26:16] our faith the timeline of God
[26:21] but you know when all the evidences to
[26:23] the contrary
[26:25] it doesn't change anything about what
[26:27] thus saith the Lord
[26:29] has said concerning us whatever that may
[26:32] be
[26:33] you know and it just kind of spoke to me
[26:35] this morning especially when you think
[26:36] about the timeline of God not being one
[26:38] of dates or hours or how humans measure
[26:42] progress
[26:43] but it's about that space of time where
[26:45] the very word he's giving you he's
[26:47] testing Us by
[26:48] and then one day it will come to pass
[26:51] and it's just an encouragement there
[26:53] that Joseph saw his word fulfilled
[26:57] Jesus saw that word made manifest
[27:01] and and that's the case for each one of
[27:03] us here this morning so to me I thought
[27:05] that was just an interesting reminder of
[27:07] the timeline of God and hopefully an
[27:08] encouragement
[27:09] you know a reminder to refocus we want
[27:12] to go ahead and stand it's we're going
[27:14] to just read just a few verses here of
[27:16] Psalm 105.
[27:17] we're going to read starting in verse 16
[27:19] and
[27:21] read to verse 22. I'll just read that
[27:24] together
[27:26] moreover he called for a famine upon the
[27:29] land he break the whole staff of bread
[27:31] he sent a man before them even Joseph
[27:34] who was sold for a servant whose feet
[27:37] they hurt with Fetters he was laid in
[27:39] Iron until the time that his word came
[27:42] the word of the Lord Tried Him the king
[27:45] sent and loosed him even the ruler of
[27:47] the people and let him go free he made
[27:50] him Lord of his house and ruler of all
[27:53] his substance to bind his princes at his
[27:55] pleasure and teaches Senators wisdom
[27:58] amen

[51:28] hear from you that
[51:31] Lord you draw us back closer to you
[51:33] you'd pull us back
[51:36] as we heard Wednesday night you're
[51:39] coming to get us

[51:44] to bless us
[51:46] this morning in your precious and
[51:49] wonderful name we pray amen and amen you
[51:54] may see it just for a moment just say a
[51:56] few things and
[51:57] then we'll sing Amazing Grace before
[52:00] first of all
[52:04] I
[52:06] I really come to appreciate the
[52:09] musicians I just got to thinking when we
[52:11] were singing all those songs after
[52:13] writing a roll
[52:15] the musicians they just have to stay
[52:18] right with it
[52:19] you know and I thought that to me that's
[52:22] marvelous
[52:23] amen amen uh as Matthew made mention uh
[52:29] you can see the Forum boards have been
[52:31] set up and that kind of give you an idea
[52:34] of the size of the church and the
[52:36] walkways so we'll have a lot of empty
[52:39] space
[52:40] um in our new church when we come in it
[52:44] but uh we're going to have to warm it up
[52:46] with our spirits
[52:48] amen and with our attitude and with our
[52:52] Grace you know I got to thinking of the
[52:55] uh you know the power
[52:58] of one
[53:01] and um
[53:04] so you know we're starting to build so I
[53:07] do want uh to say that we have a couple
[53:10] boxes out there I think we have an
[53:12] offering box and a tithing box up
[53:15] uh and so if you have a suggestion of
[53:18] what you'd like to see in the church or
[53:21] anything that you have an idea that you
[53:24] would like to uh recommend just feel
[53:27] free to write it on there I mean if you
[53:29] want extra padding on the pews just
[53:31] write extra padding
[53:33] just write whatever that you would like
[53:37] to uh put in so we can know what you're
[53:41] thinking consider your thoughts
[53:44] um
[53:45] and uh don't if you don't see those
[53:48] thoughts uh manifested in any way I I do
[53:52] want you to know they were considered
[53:55] and
[53:57] um so anyway for that what it is also we
[54:01] we want to address a uh special need of
[54:05] the family has a need a sister Grace has
[54:10] died in Congo the mother of the family
[54:13] and so if any of you would like to help
[54:16] with their funeral expenses there
[54:19] um please see brother Billy uh and uh
[54:24] give to him any offering that you feel
[54:26] that you might want to give to help
[54:28] every little bit helps you know 5 10
[54:31] whatever the Lord would put on your
[54:34] heart if you would get brother brother
[54:35] Billy after church you'll be kind of in
[54:38] the front
[54:39] then you can just uh place it in that
[54:43] well that worked really good amen God
[54:46] bless you I was thinking again like I
[54:47] was saying about the power of one and we
[54:51] know we have one God don't we one Lord
[54:54] and savior
[54:55] we have one way you know we have one
[54:59] mediator between God and man one Spirit
[55:02] by with we're all baptized and if we
[55:05] read in Ephesians uh
[55:08] four it says uh this it says
[55:14] he's talking here in Ephesians 4 he says
[55:17] endeavoring this is the third verse he
[55:19] says endeavoring to keep the unity of
[55:22] the spirit in the bond of Peace there is
[55:25] one body
[55:27] one spirit
[55:29] even as ye are called in one hope
[55:34] of your calling one Lord One Faith one
[55:39] baptism one God father of us all and one
[55:43] brother who showed up to help on
[55:46] Saturday and as above all and through
[55:49] all and in you all
[55:51] amen the power of one huh okay amen I
[55:56] really like that scripture
[55:58] hey man you got to read into the
[56:01] scripture
[56:02] sometimes you got to read between the
[56:05] lines in order to get what's coming out
[56:11] amen so we just thought we'd reach out
[56:13] to you through the word of God and so we
[56:17] can Endeavor to keep the unity of the
[56:19] faith and and that we can go forward
[56:22] because it's certainly going to take us
[56:25] all so there's always something to do no
[56:27] matter how weak or how strong uh
[56:32] you know I used to think the rain was
[56:34] excuse and then I got called to preach
[56:37] one time in canis in Oh Canada
[56:40] and it was like 17 below zero and the
[56:43] wind was blowing and the snow was going
[56:46] I looked out the window and I thought
[56:47] praise God I don't have to preach this
[56:49] morning
[56:51] nobody's going to go to church in this
[56:53] Bang Bang Bang on the door for 20
[56:56] minutes we're leaving brother McGarry
[56:59] so I had to get back in the spirit
[57:02] real quick and get out of bed and uh and
[57:08] so I got out there and you know and the
[57:10] wind's blowing and you know I'm from
[57:12] Texas
[57:13] and everybody came to church
[57:17] the place was packed out with a
[57:20] full-blown blizzard going
[57:22] and and I always thought well
[57:26] you know
[57:27] well these people are used to it and
[57:30] then something else spoke in my heart
[57:31] and he said you know these people are
[57:33] going to rise up in judgment
[57:35] against the days that people who have
[57:39] had it better have missed just like that
[57:41] little widow woman's been a rise up in
[57:44] the day of judgment because she gave of
[57:46] what she had so don't forget being
[57:49] giving don't forget it's going to take
[57:51] an effort don't forget it's going to
[57:52] take a sacrifice no matter how little
[57:55] you think your sacrifice is too Littles
[57:58] make a great
[58:00] and together we can be great
[58:03] don't you believe that amen and just
[58:06] think of how he stuck with you so if I
[58:10] just think this is a great opportunity
[58:11] for us all to come together and
[58:13] accomplish something
[58:15] and before we turn the service over
[58:19] I we were working the other day and we
[58:21] have a neighbor that lives right behind
[58:23] us and
[58:25] you've seen his truck
[58:28] out here parked in the lot
[58:31] he does a a lot of free hauling
[58:34] for us and
[58:37] and um
[58:39] and you know he enjoys doing he's really
[58:41] been a blessing to us the other day he
[58:45] was helping us clean the parking lot
[58:46] shoveling dirt out and worked in helping
[58:50] brother John and
[58:52] and he stopped
[58:55] and he stood on his shovel
[58:58] and he took his hat off and he looked
[59:00] over at me
[59:01] and I could feel the spirit just fall
[59:05] down and he said you're not building
[59:07] that you're he said you're building this
[59:10] church for people you don't know
[59:15] and uh and and he was moved he said
[59:19] he said
[59:21] people need to know the way
[59:24] and then he looked at me and I I I
[59:27] understood his Hispanic brother and
[59:30] their respect for the elders he says
[59:33] there's not many people your age
[59:35] preaching the gospel the truth anymore
[59:39] and it struck me and he went on to say
[59:42] that how he got saved
[59:45] um and uh it moved but I I it
[59:49] struck my heart because I don't want to
[59:52] build this church for message people
[59:56] you understand that's not my goal
[59:59] to build a church for people who have
[1:00:02] already heard the message you know what
[1:00:05] I mean and they want to come join a
[1:00:07] fellowship and you know I want to build
[1:00:11] it for those who haven't heard
[1:00:14] I want to build it for your converts
[1:00:19] your converts the people that you're
[1:00:22] gonna
[1:00:23] come in contact that you want to have a
[1:00:26] place for them to Fellowship we're we're
[1:00:29] never going to be a church of great
[1:00:31] enticing words
[1:00:33] as we don't come with great enticing
[1:00:35] words but may we come with the power and
[1:00:38] the demonstration of the holy spirit
[1:00:40] that the people might know that Jesus
[1:00:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:00:45] forever
[1:00:46] and that they might know that the spirit
[1:00:49] that they feel and sense
[1:00:52] can dwell in them
[1:00:55] and and that's uh that that's the beauty
[1:00:59] and even as it says and this is the end
[1:01:03] of that scripture that I love as we
[1:01:05] stand together and prepare for our
[1:01:07] brother Raphael who's going to be
[1:01:09] returning home soon it's been a blessing
[1:01:12] for him to be here and uh he kind of
[1:01:16] took a sabbatical uh from his work at
[1:01:19] home
[1:01:20] and uh and uh I might take example of
[1:01:24] that
[1:01:25] is but it says in the sixth verse it
[1:01:27] says one God and Father
[1:01:30] of all
[1:01:32] who is above all
[1:01:35] and through all
[1:01:37] and in you all
[1:01:40] amen that's what we want to bring to the
[1:01:43] world a God that can dwell in us and can
[1:01:46] do for us exceedingly and abundantly
[1:01:50] above what we can ask or think we'll be
[1:01:52] ministering this evening so Lord richly

[1:05:06] commune and eat
[1:05:09] now it's time to go home
[1:05:16] uh because the ones that are home are
[1:05:18] waiting for us
[1:05:20] alone
[1:05:21] and let's all stand to read the word
[1:05:26] Genesis
[1:05:29] Genesis chapter 1 verse 24.
[1:05:42] anymore
[1:05:51] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:05:55] the living creatures after its kind
[1:05:57] cattle creeping things beast of the
[1:06:01] earth after his kind and it was so
[1:06:14] a table
[1:06:16] and God made the Beast of the earth
[1:06:18] after his kind and the Carol
[1:06:20] after the kind and everything that
[1:06:24] creepeth upon the Earth after his kind
[1:06:26] and God saw that it was good we do the
[1:06:30] phase is
[1:06:44] and God said let us make men in our
[1:06:46] image after our likeness and let them
[1:06:49] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:06:52] over the fall of the air and over the
[1:06:54] cattle and over
[1:06:56] all the Earth and over every creeping
[1:07:00] thing that creepeth upon the Earth
[1:07:10] so God created men in his own image in
[1:07:14] the image of God created the him male
[1:07:17] and female created heat them
[1:07:23] your seats
[1:07:33] I started the subject last time that I
[1:07:36] was not able to finish
[1:07:38] that I didn't even start hello uh
[1:07:45] told me a while ago to make sure that I
[1:07:48] finished my subject
[1:08:01] my subject is the law of reproduction
[1:08:08] we see we're gonna see how this law is
[1:08:10] functioning
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:19] we know that every life on Earth comes
[1:08:23] from us a germ
[1:08:27] we know that all of us sitting here we
[1:08:30] come from a germ of life
[1:08:32] say you just entered
[1:08:38] it's a very small germ that you cannot
[1:08:41] even see with the naked eye
[1:08:46] and we know as every one of us we come
[1:08:49] from our father
[1:08:54] the the spoken word says that we don't
[1:08:57] have any blood from our mothers
[1:09:01] because they sell of of of of blood
[1:09:05] comes from the male
[1:09:10] and that's what I can say this morning
[1:09:12] we all come from God our true father
[1:09:18] everything
[1:09:20] that we have come from our heavenly
[1:09:23] father who's the true male
[1:09:29] you understand that the woman doesn't
[1:09:31] give anything to literal to the child
[1:09:34] all comes from them
[1:09:37] the blood comes from the father and see
[1:09:42] and then everything comes from our
[1:09:45] heavenly father if
[1:09:49] and it's from that small cell that we
[1:09:52] cannot see with AI this is
[1:09:56] the cells that are multiplying around
[1:09:59] that one cell
[1:10:02] and everything reproduce itself
[1:10:05] according to his own kind
[1:10:09] the dog's germ will produce a dog
[1:10:14] a bird
[1:10:16] germ will produce a bird
[1:10:21] a human germ will produce a human
[1:10:26] if nothing comes into to to break away
[1:10:30] the program of God
[1:10:34] every seed has to bring forth according
[1:10:37] to his own kind
[1:10:40] of maturity and the product will be
[1:10:43] normal to grow to its maturity
[1:10:46] the message
[1:10:49] of malachite 4 that has gathered us here
[1:10:57] it's the spoken word that brought the
[1:11:00] world into existence
[1:11:02] in the beginning in Genesis
[1:11:06] it's the spoken word that brought the
[1:11:09] world into existence in in other words
[1:11:14] the alpha has become the Omega so it's
[1:11:17] only possible it was the thinking that
[1:11:21] was in the mind of God in the beginning
[1:11:25] when we receive them we have eternal
[1:11:28] life
[1:11:31] we have been recreated by the preaching
[1:11:34] of the word
[1:11:37] that's why our pastor here insists often
[1:11:40] times
[1:11:44] that it may be the spoken word that's
[1:11:47] been brought forth here
[1:11:51] because life is only in the spoken word
[1:11:57] are thinking our opinions and all those
[1:12:00] things
[1:12:01] they're good things
[1:12:04] but life is only in the spoken word
[1:12:10] now we don't have to belong to a church
[1:12:14] you didn't come to belong to the church
[1:12:20] and you have come to hear the word and
[1:12:23] be birth of the word
[1:12:27] because the word that's the Original
[1:12:29] Seed so this is
[1:12:33] how God brings forth his children
[1:12:36] download
[1:12:37] in the soul in the in the souls in the
[1:12:41] uh the the womb of their soul
[1:12:44] by the spoken word
[1:13:27] The Life of Christ
[1:13:30] foreign
[1:13:33] word
[1:13:44] it was not brought forth according to a
[1:13:47] certain theology or a certain model
[1:13:51] who
[1:13:54] the police
[1:13:58] it's this word that have caused others
[1:14:01] to become the imitators with once I can
[1:14:04] come and copy from it
[1:14:07] is a
[1:14:12] this word comes directly from God and it
[1:14:16] was not some thinking that came from
[1:14:18] somebody else somewhere
[1:14:23] this message is the original when you
[1:14:27] hear it it's different from everything
[1:14:28] else we've heard from churches
[1:14:34] you hear sometimes people say well it's
[1:14:37] the same word that's been preached to
[1:14:38] other churches
[1:14:39] this message is
[1:14:43] regardless of what church you came from
[1:14:46] when you hear this message
[1:14:50] is different from everything else we've
[1:14:52] been exposed and that's why
[1:15:08] because before you Satan has in front of
[1:15:12] him Christ in a man
[1:15:17] the message can never be conquered
[1:15:22] it can never be falsified
[1:15:25] because the message is God himself
[1:15:30] the churches can be falsified
[1:15:34] they can receive wrong things
[1:15:38] but the message can never be false
[1:15:41] I hope I don't know if I'm making myself
[1:15:44] understood
[1:15:46] that's why whoever receives the message
[1:15:49] correctly
[1:15:50] no one can seduce him
[1:15:53] no Doctrine can take and move him over
[1:15:57] because the message is God himself
[1:16:02] we are at the end
[1:16:06] we're going back to the original
[1:16:09] the spoken word that was in the
[1:16:12] beginning look
[1:16:15] foreign
[1:17:15] it will tie it will bring forth the sons
[1:17:18] and the daughters of God
[1:17:21] so the world can see God in human flesh
[1:17:26] to see God in the human flesh
[1:17:33] it's only given to men and women who
[1:17:36] will only receive the message alone
[1:17:40] we live in the end time in the age of
[1:17:43] loud this year
[1:17:46] it's the world most darkest age of all
[1:17:49] the ages
[1:17:52] it's the the most hypocrite age that
[1:17:55] there is with no light
[1:18:00] it's a time where there is a lot of
[1:18:04] deceited but God has promised a message
[1:18:09] or a messenger in this time of confusion
[1:18:13] at the evening time
[1:18:15] foreign
[1:19:15] to received the same thing that that you
[1:19:18] have like listening
[1:19:22] the church is not supposed to be
[1:19:24] surprised by the new things
[1:19:26] when you hear new things
[1:19:29] you ask malachite foreign
[1:21:04] the Full Gospel of Salvation
[1:21:08] justifications sanctification
[1:22:10] has to rest only upon what God has said
[1:22:37] in in giving a definition of what Allah
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:15] it will produce itself according to the
[1:23:18] original
[1:23:19] according to his own kind
[1:23:23] there's there's no uh uh trouble in
[1:23:26] there
[1:23:27] the seed of a bird will produce a bird
[1:23:36] the seed of a man will produce a human
[1:23:40] being
[1:24:35] when you mix it you get something that's
[1:24:38] that looks good but it's it's weak and
[1:24:41] it does
[1:24:49] it's the mixing of a horse and uh
[1:24:54] then a donkey it cannot produce itself
[1:24:59] he doesn't know his father or his mother
[1:25:03] it's the same with a Believer
[1:25:09] or rest himself upon malachite 4.
[1:25:16] a Believer who's only an admirer of
[1:25:19] preachers
[1:25:21] without knowing where that word comes
[1:25:24] from
[1:25:26] he doesn't even know who's his spiritual
[1:25:29] father
[1:25:43] rest only upon what God has said
[1:25:48] because all other ground is sinking sand
[1:25:52] god holds his word
[1:25:55] he's tied to his word
[1:25:58] the Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:26:01] the word of God will never pass away
[1:26:05] the doctrines
[1:26:09] people's tendency they they all go
[1:26:12] forward
[1:26:14] and people they they ex they accept them
[1:26:17] and it makes a lot of noise
[1:26:19] but after for a while it comes down
[1:26:23] and when the leader is taken out
[1:26:26] they are all forgotten
[1:26:29] but the word
[1:26:34] just remain with this word
[1:26:38] now to get into our subject
[1:26:41] s
[1:26:43] if every seed has to bring forth after
[1:26:46] its kind
[1:26:49] it's written that God created Man In His
[1:26:52] Image
[1:26:53] according to his likeness
[1:26:57] and then we can all believe
[1:27:01] that a man is of a Divine species
[1:27:10] man whether of the Divine species it was
[1:27:13] made it was created to be the word of
[1:27:16] God on Earth
[1:27:20] that's why the fall of Man was not the
[1:27:22] end of man
[1:27:26] it was the program of God to reveal his
[1:27:30] attributes to the produce remember
[1:27:32] because in order for him to reproduce
[1:27:34] himself
[1:27:38] God had to become the the the the the a
[1:27:42] Kingsman Redeemer for man
[1:27:45] so he could take the place of The Sinner
[1:27:48] because we know that the the price for
[1:27:52] sin is death and see you David
[1:27:54] then God had to give his own life
[1:27:58] eternal his eternal life
[1:28:02] so he can bring man in his original
[1:28:04] place the Son of God
[1:28:07] with all the attributes of God in him
[1:28:12] we believe we have all the attributes of
[1:28:15] God in us the Bible says
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:21] so are we in this world
[1:28:26] that's what we are yes do you believe
[1:28:29] that glory to God
[1:28:33] if we are born again of the spirit of
[1:28:36] God
[1:28:39] God doesn't have weak Parts in the gross
[1:28:43] party folks and strong Parts
[1:28:48] the the weakest part of God is
[1:28:51] omnipotent no some defensive defeated
[1:28:55] we are Sons and Daughters of God with
[1:28:57] all these attributes in Us
[1:29:01] in the souls that are in prison
[1:29:05] you are part of God
[1:29:07] and I'm a part of God
[1:29:12] but I'm not all God that neither are you
[1:29:15] all God all of God
[1:29:33] which God himself became flesh to die
[1:29:37] for us
[1:29:40] then we are all amateur Gods
[1:29:45] everything that God is we are in this
[1:29:48] world
[1:29:50] this message is to bring us back in that
[1:29:52] initial position
[1:29:55] because you know with me
[1:30:02] that every man or woman completely
[1:30:05] surrender to the word is all-powerful
[1:30:09] we are living outside over there
[1:30:12] in certain circumstances
[1:30:17] foreign
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:31:27] set forth his look towards even all the
[1:31:30] way to the beginning
[1:31:35] he looked and he saw all the way back to
[1:31:39] Genesis even a place where he himself
[1:31:41] was not and Moses says
[1:31:46] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:31:49] and the Earth and we believe that that's
[1:31:51] the same Prophet because he's a prophet
[1:31:54] he saw that
[1:31:56] but when William
[1:32:10] he begins to tell us clearly what God
[1:32:13] was before even there was a beginning
[1:32:16] before Genesis
[1:32:18] beginning of everything
[1:32:21] before there was anything
[1:32:25] the father was a star
[1:32:27] before there was an Adam
[1:32:31] God filled up our time in space
[1:32:37] he was himself dwelling in eternity he
[1:32:41] was eternity the spoken word says
[1:32:45] He was the great Fountain of love
[1:32:50] he was the the the the fountain that
[1:32:53] never ceases
[1:32:55] he was all in all foreign
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:57] foreign
[1:34:10] we go back
[1:34:15] I believe I talked on this a little bit
[1:34:18] uh the other day
[1:34:23] oh I struck it in Genesis first chapter
[1:34:26] 1 verse 26.
[1:34:30] When God call his name Lord God
[1:34:34] it's in the word
[1:34:37] which means
[1:34:40] the self-existing one
[1:34:43] existed there was nothing else existed
[1:34:47] but him
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:11] he made that
[1:35:23] it was a
[1:35:25] foreign
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:36:16] in him was a nature to be a father male
[1:36:20] exist but remember but he existed by
[1:36:23] himself
[1:36:27] there ain't nothing for him to be a
[1:36:30] father
[1:36:32] inside of this
[1:36:34] is
[1:36:48] down inside of him there was something
[1:36:51] else
[1:36:55] is an object of worship
[1:36:58] but it was self-existent
[1:37:04] so there was nothing to worship him
[1:37:07] in this great Jehovah
[1:38:11] to be healed
[1:38:22] so his attributes
[1:38:27] his nature produced what is today
[1:38:32] everything that we are today
[1:38:35] was produced by his nature
[1:38:39] there's attributes that was in him he
[1:38:43] continues
[1:38:45] some people say
[1:38:50] why didn't God just stop it in the
[1:38:53] beginning
[1:38:55] his cruel-hearted
[1:39:00] so John Lewis
[1:39:05] the one who condemned Joe or Jacob see
[1:39:09] he said
[1:39:20] they know
[1:39:22] he he
[1:39:25] there was no such thing just an existing
[1:39:28] part that it doesn't exist still existed
[1:39:31] if he existence he was going to be oh
[1:39:36] he he named them but his names is
[1:39:47] he called them all kinds of name but he
[1:39:49] just because he might have a lot of
[1:39:52] knowledge
[1:39:53] but he has nothing in here
[1:39:56] you see that
[1:39:59] now that's where it is
[1:40:03] the word tells here
[1:40:05] he's hidden
[1:40:08] and these Mysteries has been here
[1:40:12] remember the Bible says the pillar
[1:40:16] foreign
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:47] can go far if you can allow me to go
[1:40:49] back Janice Irvin says Genesis 1 and 26
[1:40:54] Mercury I'm going to speak on it on
[1:40:56] Wednesday called you a film when God
[1:40:59] made a man I found the film before he
[1:41:02] made a man
[1:41:08] this word means in Hebrews he exists
[1:41:11] upon women one that existed by himself
[1:41:14] all by himself
[1:41:17] nothing was before him
[1:41:22] he was the whole existence that ever
[1:41:25] been
[1:41:26] it was one that existed by himself
[1:41:33] the the one who's fulfilled himself in
[1:41:37] all things he can do office
[1:41:43] he existed by himself
[1:41:47] Genesis 2. when he made man he says I am
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:56] y a h u g e z uh
[1:42:02] j u v u h
[1:42:05] Jehovah Jehovah what does that mean
[1:42:10] he exists
[1:42:20] I created something by myself
[1:42:24] we come from him
[1:42:27] I created something by myself
[1:42:31] so I can make it my son
[1:42:35] your son is a human being
[1:42:38] if we are sons of God
[1:42:41] we are Gods
[1:42:43] to make it myself
[1:42:46] or one of my little ones temporarily to
[1:42:51] an amateur one glory to God
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:52] it doesn't exist by himself anymore
[1:43:54] foreign
[1:45:00] he jumped
[1:45:04] foreign
[1:46:30] completely submitted to the will of God
[1:46:33] which is his word
[1:46:35] everything will come subject to us
[1:46:41] is that the scripture
[1:46:45] if it was his property he was the god of
[1:46:49] the earth
[1:46:51] you could pronounce he could speak the
[1:46:54] word and something will come to pass
[1:46:57] the prophet said spoke the word and he
[1:47:00] came to pass
[1:47:01] we have a great God and ground Duty a
[1:47:04] great God
[1:47:05] in for one time
[1:47:09] I had a I had a lot of money in the bag
[1:47:13] I was uh
[1:47:17] um I was doing commissions
[1:47:25] and and those uh robbers and all those
[1:47:29] guys they know how to see who's got
[1:47:31] money
[1:47:32] on the security they came and they came
[1:47:35] and they presented themselves as a
[1:47:37] security agent
[1:47:38] and Mr followers there were two of them
[1:47:58] I opened the bag
[1:48:01] what is this it's money Supreme Society
[1:48:04] it's for a company

[1:48:17] I said Lord
[1:48:22] and they want to take it
[1:48:25] Lord help me in the name of Jesus
[1:48:29] in regard they look at me
[1:48:32] regardless they look at the money
[1:48:34] close your back Oliver go
[1:48:37] you see by Perfect
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:45] God is the present help in terms of me
[1:48:51] he's very wonderful let's go back
[1:48:56] he can speak the word and something will
[1:48:59] come to pass
[1:49:16] written in the book
[1:49:20] when the lamb was slain before the
[1:49:23] foundation
[1:49:30] the one who existed by himself
[1:49:35] it was like a a big
[1:49:38] diamonds he could never been anything
[1:49:41] else
[1:49:42] but inside of that diamond we have this
[1:49:45] is attribute
[1:49:46] there was an attribute for him to be a
[1:49:49] savior
[1:49:50] among the attributes
[1:49:54] inside of him
[1:49:57] there was an attribute to be a Healer if
[1:50:01] you are sick that's for you
[1:50:05] he was there to heal you
[1:50:10] and because there was nothing to be said
[1:50:13] nothing to hear Allah
[1:50:16] and those attributes reduce those things
[1:50:25] knowing all that was going to come to be
[1:50:28] manifest that means
[1:50:30] that it was going to be a savior
[1:50:36] it was gonna come to be made Flash and
[1:50:40] to dwell Among Us
[1:50:42] he knew that by his stripes
[1:50:48] he slayed
[1:50:51] there before the foundation
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:16] that the true life the real life can
[1:51:18] only be given to us by
[1:51:21] by the seed the original seeds
[1:51:24] to produce Christ
[1:51:28] the word seed comes by a channel
[1:51:32] the Ministries are are channels
[1:51:41] the original word come to pass through
[1:51:45] and when you receive it is
[1:51:48] you can only produce the Life of Christ
[1:51:51] in you
[1:51:53] the word comes by Channel
[1:51:56] a member of the Bible
[1:51:59] for him to get into the church
[1:52:02] in order to produce the Life of Christ
[1:52:06] if it's not the case
[1:52:10] it's a hybrid without life and that's a
[1:52:15] a bearing
[1:52:17] God doesn't allow
[1:52:27] because the myth s
[1:52:30] it will bring forth death and it will
[1:52:33] take God away from us
[1:52:36] in the spoken word is original
[1:52:39] seedham says
[1:52:45] now the power of the church that
[1:52:48] believes
[1:52:56] do you believe that is the church says
[1:53:00] amen
[1:53:03] let's say is in you
[1:53:06] is
[1:53:08] that Christ has all the power
[1:53:13] Matthew 28 and 18.
[1:53:20] is this is the word seed in his body
[1:53:27] if it's the word seed he has all the
[1:53:30] power if that word sin is in you then
[1:53:33] you have all the power and
[1:53:37] if it's him and us then it's the word
[1:53:40] seed in us what is it then
[1:53:44] everything that God was
[1:53:47] he poured into Christ
[1:53:49] and everything that Christ was
[1:53:52] he was poured into his church
[1:53:55] that's the that's the power the power
[1:54:00] is everything that God wants he poured
[1:54:04] into Christ and everything
[1:54:26] remember the law of law of reproduction
[1:54:29] of God now remember
[1:54:34] according to its kind is that true
[1:54:37] amen the assembly said amen
[1:54:42] the seed of Christ the word
[1:54:46] must come through his body
[1:54:49] Lassie must decrease the doer that the
[1:54:53] seed of Christ must
[1:55:00] be transmitted by his through his body
[1:55:02] in denomination not by denomination
[1:55:06] because a denomination reason it will it
[1:55:10] will bring forth thinking
[1:55:12] denomination
[1:55:16] it produces his own thinkings and give
[1:55:19] it to the church
[1:55:21] but his body is tied to the world
[1:55:26] and any seed has to be transmitted
[1:55:28] through it
[1:55:30] not by denomination
[1:55:34] but by by a seed word born again
[1:55:41] now remember guess
[1:56:10] [Music]
[1:56:22] and the body of Christ is made out of
[1:56:24] set five Ministries
[1:56:28] it's true that body that the seed is
[1:56:31] being transmitted through the body is
[1:56:33] that true
[1:56:35] the assembly said amen
[1:56:39] the Church of the Bible Sydney songs
[1:56:42] this this birthday
[1:56:44] it means the new birth
[1:56:47] will produce it itself
[1:56:52] the the the the new birth produces
[1:56:55] Christ himself
[1:56:57] in his body in his church
[1:57:01] and you see men and women
[1:57:05] they behave like people from on high
[1:57:09] it's part of the accommodation they
[1:57:11] speak like people from
[1:57:15] they are preoccupying themselves with
[1:57:17] things that edifies the people
[1:57:20] it's the word
[1:57:25] some people can have the confirmation of
[1:57:28] Hebrew 13 and 8.
[1:57:31] when the seed is preached properly
[1:57:35] Christians
[1:57:36] we will see Christ the same yesterday
[1:57:39] today and forever Hebrews 29.
[1:57:42] now want you to remember this my
[1:57:45] Christian Brothers
[1:57:49] it's by election that you've been
[1:57:52] predestinated to be son and daughter of
[1:57:54] God

[1:58:06] and the program of God

[1:58:14] I mean he yanked you out of the hands of
[1:58:16] Satan
[1:58:18] you were in place in worse places
[1:58:27] you had projects to become murderers
[1:58:30] the one that would smoke weed programs
[1:58:39] God was following
[1:58:53] [Applause]
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:42] when me
[1:59:52] God is humility
[1:59:57] today
[1:59:59] you are the proof of his vision that's
[2:00:02] why
[2:00:05] he's Whispering a secret of mystery
[2:00:09] it's the secret of God
[2:00:12] they are making you what you want
[2:00:15] a Son of God
[2:00:18] will only look upon his grace
[2:00:22] look look
[2:00:25] the devil is trying by all means every
[2:00:28] time
[2:00:30] to try to point you to your first world
[2:00:33] your first marriage with the world
[2:00:35] offender
[2:00:38] to accuse you and to keep you under
[2:00:41] condemnation

[2:00:52] but it's him that brought you through
[2:00:54] seduction into the place

[2:01:23] me but because you were among the the
[2:01:25] bad people
[2:01:27] you were you were being led by
