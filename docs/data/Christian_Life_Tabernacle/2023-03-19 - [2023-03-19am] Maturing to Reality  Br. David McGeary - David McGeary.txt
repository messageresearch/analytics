Description:
Maturing to Reality
Br. David McGeary
March 19, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you and I welcome everyone in the house of God Amen may have your seats as you invited brother Mike for I saw him reading this morning good morning hope that uh I think that cold probably uh wakes everybody up a little bit hopefully this morning a little bit of a bite we're going to read Psalm 19 this morning it's a very familiar Psalm I think to pretty much everybody in the room but you know when David begins he makes this statement he says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork and I was thinking about that and you know brother Brandon reminded us that the Stars the skies were the first Bible you know in David's day this was still one of the primary ways that God spoke to people showed them himself and notice how David is we're going to read this here in a little bit describes that first Bible says the heavens declare his glory and the firmament demonstrates his work verse 2 day unto Day uttereth speech and night into night showeth knowledge every day that first Bible speaks of God and every night it makes God known in verse 3 there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard there isn't a single person on the face of the Earth who doesn't sit under the ministry of that first Bible everybody sits under the witness of that first Bible he goes on to describe that witness we'll read it here in a little bit but the heavens declare his glory and the firmament shows his handiwork you know Paul says in Romans 1 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made and in Genesis 1 we read the account of him creating this first Bible you know it's in verse six and eight and then on in 14 and 19 and he describes how he arranged to the stars and how he arranged the sun and the path and the course of all of these things specifically to declare his glory and to make his handiwork known and when he had everything put in its place it said in verse 18 and God saw that it was good why was that was it because it was pretty was it because it was the right amount of time and the right amount of Seasons knows because everything was positioned just so to be an acceptable image of what he was wanting to declare it was good it was acceptable you know there's another Bible the one we hold in our hands or digitally or however we have it but you know there are all kinds of churches and people and religions that pour over this book you know trying to understand it from the back to the front in different languages and you know many of them can quote huge huge amounts of it but that was never the point of a Bible you know religion is to this Bible as astronomy is to the first Bible just as strong astronomers will peer at the skies to try to find the source of life or to try to find life all kinds of people will look at this Bible to try to find the source of life but you know I Think Jesus said it best in John 5 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me just as the heavens the first Bible declares the glory of God and chose his handiwork so also does this Bible declare the glory of God and show his handiwork see it's all about making a person known that was the whole point of a Bible you know and it doesn't matter whether the book has King James version on it or voice of God on it if it isn't about finding a person then it's just pouring over words and trying to understand teachings and order your life according to doctrines they are they which testify of me is what he said the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork you know there was a time when Jesus went up on a mountain and he took some of his disciples with him and the scriptures say he was transfigured before them and it's in Matthew 17 and there was something that was made manifest in Jesus that caused Peter to just want to build a tabernacle and start worshiping on the spot something was made known in him but there was a voice that came and it said this in verse 5 this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him you know just as God was pleased with his first Bible said that it was good it was acceptable because of what it spoke so also was he pleased with this son this firstborn son as he looked at him and said I am pleased with him hear him what he says you know he's so perfectly represents me just listen to what he says because he represents me just as the Stars the first Heavens represent him you know we read it's interesting as we read Psalm 19 we'll go here toward the end here David's makes an interesting statement verse 14 he says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer just as he looked at the first Bible and saw how it declared the glory of God and showed his handiwork now he was praying that he too would be acceptable just as the first Bible was acceptable you know I got to thinking about that and you know just like that first Bible and every Bible ever since has declared his glory and showed his handiwork you know my prayer is that may I declare his glory and show his handiwork you know it said that Jesus pleased the Lord and that it showed his image but you know he was the firstborn of many and it says in First John 3 now we are the sons of God and we know that when he shall appear the effect will be that will be just like him so just as he was pleasing just as he offered an acceptable declaration just as the first son offered an acceptable declaration so also is this our calling and that's my prayer for myself you know that may I declare his glory and show his handiwork we can go ahead and stand we're going to read Psalm 19 together you know may I like every Bible he's ever had have a life that is constantly speaking constantly making known him May there be nowhere I go that his voice is not heard through me you know Psalm 19 is the witness of the sons of God you know what is declared in heaven what is declared by his first son David prayed that it will be declared through him let's just reads Psalm 19 here together the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day and today utterance speech and night end of night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line has gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he said a tabernacle for the son which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run aways is going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweet are also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from Secret faults keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength My Redeemer amen God bless you have your seats man let's sing that's why we praise him that's why we say [Music] he came to me

on the inside we love you Lord and we love you because you first loved us and we thank you this morning and ask you to bless us be with us this morning Father may we walk from here strong Christians this morning in Jesus preciousness holy name we pray amen God bless you thank you musicians each one of you God bless you we certainly uh would like to turn in our vitals this morning to the First with the gospel of Saint John chapter 1 and um so it's great to see each one of you out in the house of the Lord I know it looks like a bomb went off outside but um where we've started and so there's a lot of empty ditches and a lot of dirt so we certainly asked the parents to watch their children we've tried to put fences up and and believe it or not that fence is for you it's not for the other person it's for you not to go past in Normandy people see a little opening and they think well I'll go through there because that's for everybody else no it's for everybody else but me I'm the only person that can fall in the ditch okay nobody else can fall into ditch but me so you leave the ditch to me please and so be be careful out there and they what happened was is we had a big storm as you know and all the pipes floated out of the ditch and they wanted to come this morning and dig and get all the ditches ready and I thought well I thought maybe I should have them come and then tell them no and invite him into church but we didn't do it I hope you enjoy the word this morning it's it's in my heart I I don't know exactly how to bring it out to you we're going to play 10 minutes of a portion of a sermon and we're going to build on it but let us read these scriptures here my subject this morning or if I had a title it would be called maturing to reality maturing to reality and it says um so let us read this and let's think on it just a moment in the beginning was the word so that's the original isn't it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so we know the word was an expression of himself the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he made all things there's nothing made that wasn't made from him he is the source of all life in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehendeth it not Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you this morning um you know this this scripture uh is a great thing because everything that a man needs is encompassed in the word of God when you look at the word of God it it it's given for instruction for reproof it's given for in teaching and so it within it is all the framework of what God has for us so the word gives us warning instruction part of instruction is warning yeah I if you ever read a instruction label I know you sisters do us men haven't learned that yet you know we look at the pictures and then we perceive it in our mind and then we go about it and if it don't come together right it's the manufacturers fault it's not ours or we have the great gift of modification we'll just drill a hole right or we'll bend it or we'll we'll get it to work the way we think it should work but yet the word of God is like instruction it tells you how to do it the right way and the word of God also has a lot of warnings and like you said when you read a warning label it it'll it'll warn you to put on glasses it'll warn you to have ventilation it'll have all these warnings there because these are the things that will harm you if you don't take heed to them and there's a couple of great warnings in the Scripture it said that in the last days perilous times shall come that's a warning and that men would no longer wish to retain God in their thinking they no longer want to consider things the way God considers them so it said that that in the last days perilous times shall come men should be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and that this reprobation would come from man pursuing that and no longer wishing to keep God in their knowledge what follows is reprobation and perilous times that's the word of God and you're never going to change the word of God it'll always come to pass exactly the way that God's word says it and so also the scripture tells us that Satan should appear as an angel of Light that he is so caught up in his own folly that he would appear as an angel of Light and deceive many in fact he would deceive the very elect if possible so that's how great this deception is that if it if it would deceive you then you have to understand that you're going to have to battle with that deception that you are not free from it you understand what I'm saying the very truth of the scripture says it would try to deceive the very elect if possible so the elect has got to realize this angel of Light is going to appear to them and try to deceive them and in the midst of this deception the world around them is no longer wishing to retain God in their knowledge so yeah you it it sets up a a setting for an extreme isolation for the believer the world has left God they don't retain them in their knowledge they're they're there's perilous times they're doing destructive things oh I I love the statement that somebody sent me and it's out of uh birth pains and the prophet of God talks about science and how that man will destroy themself he says God doesn't destroy man man takes their wisdom and their knowledge and destroys themselves and and and so and this angel of Light that's appearing and deceiving they all feel like they're they're going for uh that they're in some pursuit of something that's wonderful and and they they don't uh realize that once again the scripture warns us that they'll say peace and safety and sudden destruction will quickly come so get just that man it gets into a sense where where and it throws Us in such a battle because Satan is continually uh trying to deceive us and and we had a wonderful example of that in the message the other day that we listened to where the prophet of God said I was driving along and all of a sudden Satan came into the car now you know I'm nowhere near a prophet but I I experienced that one time in my life I was in Montana and I was driving in my truck and and all of a sudden I felt like somebody was sitting in the truck next to me and it was a weird feeling you know like all of a sudden I was carrying on the prophet of God Satan who is speaking to my conscience you know what I'm saying and and he said what if what if and you know and I I have a saying I keep it all the time in my heart and ifs but and wise are all Satan's lies amen anytime you hear well if or but or and you know those are all the things that Satan told Eve no you won't do that if you eat this you'll be this and he'll do this and and so you just can't listen but the prophet God said that he came in there and he said Jesus you know Jesus he said you know Jesus was just a great man he didn't deny him he said Jesus was just a great man and you know he was just like Oral Roberts and Billy Graham just great men and he he gained in popularity and and popularity and all of a sudden everybody got the calling him a god and so it just went on like that from there and here we are today uh calling him God and he was just a a great man and what a deception that appearing as an angel of Light uh uh trying to tempt you and and break you down because we know that the battle is in the mind and so that that's the Battleground that Satan chose to fight now God didn't choose that ground the enemy chose that ground because God doesn't have to fight you understand God don't have to fight for nothing in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word God and all things that were made at this this is this is such a great scripture all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made that's the sovereignty of God the rulership of God that's what makes him God there's nothing that made was made that he didn't make so if you don't have to defend himself he doesn't have to prove himself it's the enemy that appears as an angel of Light so with that great understanding that the word of God tells us things that we need to be mindful of we need to understand the day that we're living in we need to understand the spirits that we're battling and job said life is a constant Warfare and you can't get lulled to sleep you can't think that there's nothing at stake you can't think oh all's well you've got a the way that you know that all things well is that you put a Watchman on the tower and he watches and then you can and the Watchman Cries Out Watchmen what of the night what's been what are the might what do you hear what do you see what was the Watchman therefore the Watchman was there that the city would be called to arms and to be a prep for battle and in the book of Nehemiah I love the book of Nehemiah I love that book so much that I that we're building out here and I thought I'm just going to go back and do another teaching on the book of Nehemiah just for my own personal self I'm selfish you know well the scripture says to love your brother as you love yourself we need a real selfie not this fake selfie out here but we need a real selfie the real love of God shed abroad in our heart by the spirit of God but the the enemy those that were opposed to Israel they were they heard rumor that they were going to attack at night and so what they did is they gathered all the people from that were all outside the city they were all working how many knows the book of Nehemiah go back and start reading that book that book will set you on fire amen you'll all show up at church with a hammer and a nail you you know you wanna you'll have a mind of work you want to do something for God you know what I mean it just fires your soul up in there well so though they they put watches out Eric and the scripture says that that they they cut the people in half and half of them worked and the other half held two Spears one for themselves and one for the person that was working and that's their word and everybody that was working had one hand to the work and one hand on their sword in other words they all had their sword uh strapped so they were ready for battle ready for battle and and you cannot in this hour get long to sleep you must be ready for battle the enemy is not going to sit back he is not going to let you obtain what God wants you to obtain he's going to try to keep you from every promise he's going to try to fight you every step of the way he's like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he made to devour if he can keep you from missing your appointment he'll do everything he can and don't sit back and say well if I'm predestinated uh I will um you know I'll make it and if I'm not I won't that's not exactly the way that it works you know that's called Grace to disgrace the scripture also says you reap what you sow and he said some will obtain the award the their reward and others will retain it through fire oh yeah you might not you might not miss your reward that you might have to get it through fire I don't want to get it through fire I'd rather take the weight provided huh and then the then the permissive will so I I don't want to go God's permissive will some lazy life and some life without much very much God in it and no spiritual and no praying and touching and getting alone with God and getting in the spirit and seeking what the will of God is for my life and being on fire for God and just live some lukewarm life say well I'll get i'll get uh I'm predestinated so I'll be there okay I'll grant you that you know what I mean but I wouldn't want to take the consequences of that route because God's just and he couldn't take a man that dedicated his life and sacrificed for the kingdom of God and take him and reward him and then let you come in on some scapegoat a way of life he'll let you come in if you're predestinated but you'll also reap what you sow so as we approach this this morning I hope that in the next a little bit that as we go through this this morning that you will take it with sincerity sincerity what it is the Lord is Desiring uh for you and again our subject is maturity to reality we're going to play 10 minutes this morning of a section of the message and that's the one that we played Wednesday night we did have trouble with our internet Wednesday night uh uh we do everything we can to try to get people not to cut our wires but they just figure some way that they see those wires and they think oh I think I'll cut these but so we're going to listen from paragraph uh uh two 202 I know some of you have phones if you had turned uh all your outside calls and noise off and if you want to get it on your phone and read it I know they'll put it on the boards here and we're going to listen through over to the end of 2 30. and that that's about 10 minutes I I know that this 10 minutes in here is my son Matthew some of his favorite uh portions of the message because he quotes them to me all the time so I think he has this memorized so he probably can uh just we could probably just have him up here and tell us but I want you to listen for just 10 minutes closely to what he's being said and what is it that he's trying to get across to us now remember only my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow so because this is for his elected now I I can't understand how a man can stand there discern the thoughts of the tents of the heart have people that will testify that he praised prayed for them and through his ministry and his love they were raised from the dead demons cast out of all signs and manners of signs and wonders people coming by the thousands Jonesboro Arkansas the population of Jonesboro Arkansas I think quadrupled in one meeting they were camped everywhere the works and wonders that were done were beyond the imagination the story of the little girl that was blind and she was looking for her daddy and she bumped into brother Brandon who arranged that Hallelujah you know and she was going blindly all of a sudden grabbed him and and he she said mister can you get me in to see the Gila oh my goodness he said why he said I've lost my daddy well why don't you want me to take you to your daddy well if you take me to the Healer I'll find my daddy on my own he said well you know something I'm the guy you know I'm the one that's how he is you just might bump into him this morning and and that's the wonderful part about him he puts himself in your pathway that you can touch him for what you have need of so we're going to listen to this this morning just for 10 minutes and then we'll try to keep it as short as we can on the other side of this but I think this it will help you understand what motivated me and has caused this desire within the framework in my heart that I want to share with you today so thank you brother Mike and God bless you brother Steve it's good to see you man and uh each one this morning may you enjoy just 10 minutes so try to be attentive as you can for those that uh have the headphones I I trust the interpreters will be able to do the best they can if you can pull it up on your phone in Spanish or French or whatever language you have I don't know if it's in Swahili or any of the other dialects please feel free to do that this morning but God bless you just listen this morning for just 10 minutes thank you the one that we played Wednesday night thank you how many knows what we played Wednesday night the invisible Union of the bride of Christ thank you if that don't like I don't even know how to preach after that but so what I want to in my heart uh share with you when I talk about um this great uh subject this morning maturing to reality maturing to reality and we know just by the little bit that we listen to and I'm sure that you understood it we know that Eve being a type of the bride and God always referring to his church as a female or a wife or a woman we know that in the beginning well the prophet of God said Adam was one being but he couldn't um but Adam couldn't fall because God couldn't create anything like that so he separated the two to be a part and in separating those two now that part of Adam that could be uh deceived as he said he knew that she would do it else she wouldn't have been God but he said he did that because that he wanted he had attributes and I'll read that statement again in its paragraph 211 if you did want to put it up Mike it said but see the attribute that's in God had to be displayed now that's what he said the attributes that were in God had to be displayed well why did they have to be displayed because that was one of his threefold purpose was to make himself known and there was parts of God that man would have never known that he was If God Was A Healer you would have never known that God was a Healer until you were sick somebody had to get sick in order for God to heal him someone had to be lost in order for God to to find them and so he had these attributes to displayed so he knew that Eve would fall and give him the opportunity to display these attributes but as we read down here he says but you see the attribute that is in God had to be displayed he was a savior and to make everything perfect the way he had it then there could be nothing lost so the way he had it there could be nothing lost so he had to allow that little drop remember that little thing in time that we're in this little space of time that you were in but you are not of this world nor are you from this world you are from another kingdom you have another father beyond your Earthly father I I hope that can start to set in so you can I can express it to you in my heart and then he makes this statement he said in that state nothing could be lost he said oh don't be children be man in woman another word he's talking about a maturity don't be immature don't be uh don't be children and and so we we see there that he made a call out to the church to mature the whole message that we hear that our message brought to us over and over again he talks about the seed going into the ground about it coming up coming through all these different stages and what was it heading to it was heading to maturity Harvest time he talks about the time it comes that the seed comes to to maturity and and so in in getting us to bring us to this maturity he he's got to bring us to an understanding in other words a mature person understands things that a child can when I was a child I thought as a child right but when I matured and I became adult I began to think like an adult and so now he's approaching our immature thinking are immature actions the way that we're acting the way that we're thinking the things that we do are expressing and showing her lack of maturity now okay you you know some of you I think are being gifted with teenagers some of us already received that gift and from that day we've longed for them to mature but you know the the thing of it is if is that they they they they don't want you telling them what to do that they want you to to trust them because they want you to think they know better and the reality of it is they don't they're in the shore they're they're not capable of making right decisions because they're not capable of fighting off the influences that come to attack them in their weak places the desire to be accepted the desire to know where they stand with the people that around them in trying to find their identity to try to find out where they stand where that they fit in what their future holds for them all these battles and things that they're questing out in their life and may I say this something to the parents don't leave your kids abandoned out there to fight that by themselves talk to him about it pray with them read the scriptures let them know that you know what you're going through and that you've been through it yourself don't take nothing for granted don't let all the little young boys and girls go down the hall and all play in the room while you all sit around fellowshipping don't let them children because remember they don't have a born-again nature till they're born again they're still part of the First Union the first husband that had rule over them and what was the first husband that had rule over you was the nature that you're born with you came into the world what speaking lies why because you got the nature of the liar that's the nature you're born with because the way that you came you came through sin is that right through a natural union he said you got here not the way God wanted here but grow up he said be mature understand that I'm the way that I am because I was born in sin shaped in iniquity came in the world it didn't matter how Godly my parents were I know people in here that Godly Parents but they couldn't help it right because they had to come to a a birth they had that nature had to die and they had to be reunited with their original nature the one that God had from him in the beginning they had to be reunited with that and kind of and so he's he's he he's trying to tell us in this little a section that you've got to mature you you've got to mature and we're talking about maturing to reality and so what is reality it says though it's the state of things as they actually exist the actual fact that's what reality is it's the actual fact the actual fact was the day that you eat of this tree that day you'll die so a lie came right and what a lie is it's a perception so we're talking about maturing to reality or maturing to the state of things as they actually exist or as they actually are so if you're not living in a reality you're living in a perception is what you perceive that's only if you're maturing from reality to reality so if you're maturing from what that you perceive and the perceptions that you have to what is actually the fact and that's a big gap because what is perception perception is the ability to see hear and become aware of things through the census oh my to be able to perceive and become aware of things through the senses that is a perception what do you think this great thing everybody trying to get you to perceive it see it become aware of it and understand it from their Viewpoint or their angle they try they try it that's what sales is it's trying to change your perception get you to see it different way understand it a different way so the the perception through this census is not reality now take this impersonal today because a lot of it is the way that you're perceiving yourself how that you look at yourself what your perceptions are in the mirror oh mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all well don't answer that question because you'll come up with yourself every time and that's a perception it's what you've become aware of through your senses it becomes to you your perception becomes your reality you believe that things are the way that they are because of how you perceive them that is a lie that is a deception that is from the father of Lies there's only one reality and that's God's word that's the only thing that's actually the way that it is because everything that was made was made by him and without him nothing was made that was made that's reality that's the facts the way they really are if it's not the word it's not real it's a what it's a perception look it's a it is something that you become aware of through the census God doesn't deal in those realms how does God deal not by perception but by revelation that's how that's how God does it he doesn't he reveals to you only one thing and that's what his word because that's reality so to mature means to grow to your finished product to come to what that you really are not a perception of what you think you are there was two people in the temple worshiping one was sitting there oh God I've given my arms to you I've served you Lord oh Jehovah you know all that I have I bestowed up for you father I fed the pure fed the poor and I I've done these great works for you o God hear me Lord bless me that guy was living in perception he got all his information from someplace other than reality which was the word there's another fella in the back he's going oh God I'm a sinner I don't deserve to be here I was born in sin shaped in iniquity I came in the world speaking lies Lord I have all kinds of my own thoughts and I have all kinds of my own works and and I I haven't given myself over to you a hundred percent Lord I'm still battling all kinds of things in my flesh have mercy on me oh God which one was in reality one's living in perception but One's Gonna but and one was living in reality believe it or not if those two people the one in the back who didn't even feel worthy to go to the front was the one that was mature the other one was so immature that no doubt he probably ended up being one of the money changers in the courtyard that's deception so we find that perception comes through the senses it comes through what you see what you think what you remember what your Consciousness is all those things develop into a perception if you're living by perception you're living in a false reality you're not living the way that the word says it is no way that it actually is you're not living in a life the way that it actually is you're seeing all kinds of things from the Viewpoint of deception and have no idea really what God's word says about it when you look at a person we call it first impression foreign that's what we we call it first impression or in other words first perception what does the person perceive about you the first time that you see them if you would have meant me you would have perceived a hippie you're going to perceived the drug addict you either perceived the one that sought after pleasure that hated Authority didn't want to be subject to nothing did his own thing your perception may have been true to the senses but it was a reality the reality that wasn't me even though it was perceived even though there was evidence of the census I see the long hair did I smell the drugs I hear these words everything that just proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt it's a hippie but the word of God said I was a Son of God predestinated before the foundation of the world and what ruled over was perception what ruled over me was the perception of myself I thought I was cool I thought I was hip I knew the right people I knew rock and roll band people I knew the animals and kind of the birds wrong Garden you know I knew Steppenwolf wrong Garden oh I perceived you know I I had it going on perception she might sit there but you've got all kinds of perceptions we've got perceptions of one another we got perceptions of the church we've got perceptions of the ministry we've got perceptions of revivals we got perceptions of where we think God's moving and where he's not moving car absolutely living under all kinds of different perceptions can the truth of it is is that we need to mature to reality maturing to reality another if you're mature to reality you've got to mature to what the word really says about you regardless of your perception and so now our messenger just takes a little bit of time it says the reason that you're perceiving yourself the way that you do and you look at yourself the way you look at yourself is because of that nature you got when you were born into the world that's what the mirror says I'm really not a Christian I'm really not born again I'm really not an overcomer and there's I'm really haven't been Justified it's because I remember it he remembers it that's not what the word said I don't care what's your perception of yourself is I don't care what your senses are telling you I don't care what you're aware of I don't care how much evidence you have to prove that your perception is real it's not real unless it's the word reality is the word spoken word was the original seed everything that was sowed after that was a perception and in our own lives we get a perception of ourselves as a loser we get a perception of ourselves or it's fed to us little girls I know for a fact I've seen it myself I've got phone calls on it people have written me about it ask me about it not just once several times my little girl how how old is she she's 11. she thinks that she's gay no that's how bad the perception is if we get caught up in perception if we get caught up in determining life by our senses if if we've determined Life by the perilous times that we're living if we determine Life by Satan which appears as an angel of Light we are not living in the reality of God's word God's word said that we're more than conquerors God said word says that we're more than Victorious God's word says that we'll defeat Satan on every place every time every situation every circumstance God's word said he's the same yesterday today and forever and change is not I don't care what dress that Satan appears in the world's a mockery of itself I thought of the poor woman's movement of this time through history the scripture says that woman's the weaker vessel that's reality and just because I perceive themselves as being equal doesn't mean they're equal it's nothing wrong with that it's the perception that that's bad it's the perception she can make it on her own when the word of God said she couldn't make it on her own it's the same perception a man has when he thinks he can make it on his own without a husband we can't make it without him we are made to be sheep we are made to be followers the woman was a type of the church as husband and wife when they get into this thing well I'm equal and I can do the job just as good as as man can if if I have the same abilities he does and I can join the Army and I can fly a jet and I can do this can I can do that and they perceive themselves to be something that they're not and they've lived in that perception to Defying the reality of God's word which would bestow upon them blessings and life far beyond any life this false possession is going to give them so they finally come down to the time they're going to pick a woman of the year and you know what they pick a man that claims to be a woman once again a man can be a better woman than a woman can be a woman I'm telling you if you don't get out of your perceptions you will deceive yourself you can't live in perception you've got to live in the reality of God's word you've got to mature to reality the whole seed from the beginning through the church has went from one perception why what happened to Luther and the lutherans why did they denominate because they perceived they had it they perceived all they needed was justification they perceived that's all the farther they had to go my sins are forgiven and they stopped perception stops you from maturing it stops you from growing into what you can possibly be you say are you preaching in us no I'm preaching it myself this morning because I realized that it was my perception of the message that I thought that had reached the top I thought alls I needed was what I read and what I perceived I I finally got the understanding of it and then I began to see that he he's trying to tell us something and when he's always been preaching was you've got to mature you've got to mature that you've got to grow to something so what is he what is he trying to tell us here what is he trying to get us to grow into and and he begins and explains all about why that we the way we are the nature that we have why the way that we are why is he doing that because he's trying to wipe that perception out of your thinking then he tells you he justified you in other words you never did it in the first place well you know you did it your perception tells you did it you've got the memories that you did it you have the perception of your senses but the reality is you never did it not here because here isn't the first place here isn't the first place you've got to mature out of the perception and out of the awareness that you have of what you see from your senses that's why faith is the Sixth Sense Faith isn't governed by perception it's not governed by the false reality of the senses it's governed by one thing only God said so the father of our faith Abraham had to deny his perception Sarah she perceived it she said that dude's crazy me and my Lord together again I'm I'm 90 he's 100 or 80 or whatever they were but Abraham 's reality was based in one thing that God that promised it was able to perform it he had to move mature to reality God is trying to get this bride and this church and this end time message was given to mature this church into the reality of God's word another where you become to the place that what God Said is actually the fact it's actually the way that things are not your mind not your thoughts not what the scale says not what the mirror says I don't care what anything says I'm the best looking Son of God God could made because this is the way he made me Hallelujah there's nobody else thinks I'm gorgeous there's two people that think I'm gorgeous me and my wife it's the only two that matter him and you we think that we're there because we perceive we're there we think we have the Revelation because we perceive we have the Revelation lean not to your own understanding a whole message we don't lean to your perceptions don't lean to your understanding mature past it hear the word of God pray for Revelation there's only one way to receive reality and that's by divine revelation you've got to deny yourself so he goes on he begins to explain these beautiful things he talked about how it's not your fault Hallelujah it's not my fault I live the way I lived it's not my fault I did the things I did it's not your fault that's the nature you got but the reality is the reality is there was a German life in me but what did that life have to do it had to grow it had to mature it had to grow until it became in its full maturity it had to mature to what reality I had to mature to the place that I can look at myself and say it's not my fault who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect because the what seed of God remaineth in them I've got to mature to the reality that I know that that seed of God's in me because the word said so and if he said so that's the reality and the messenger came only to the elect only to those that had ear to hear to say the seed was in you before the foundation of the beginning of the world that's quite a statement but you realize you got to mature to that you've got to get rid of all the Mind battles you've got to say Amen if you do something you repent of it your sins go before you to be remembered no more you've got to mature to that reality he he says don't be children he said you had this verse but you have to be a good paragraph to 2 213 he says you have to be reunited again with another nature how am I going to be reunited with that other nature what's God's plan how did he lay it out in the scripture it came through justification it came to through sanctification it came through the being reborn not the restoration of the gifts the new birth which is what Jesus Christ in you how did you get there you died to that old nature you said I don't want this to have rule over me I don't want to be the way that I am I don't want to think this way I don't want to be weak I don't want to keep stumbling I hate this thing that so easily besets Me and You Begin to cry Abba Father if you've been to mature and you matured and you begin to mature why because the life is working its way through all the perceptions so it could come into maturity why because he became you that you might become him it isn't that what he goes on to say he goes on to say here and he's starting to talk and he's coming about the bride and he's talking how your name wasn't there and you got rid of your natural desire and that that that was Babylon and you were impregnated with the wrong thing but he came to pay that price now we say these things all the time but it's evident by our conversation by our actions by the things that so easily be sent us that we haven't matured to that reality you plant a seed you walk out there and you say there's my Field of Corn because you know in that seed is every ability for that seed to transform and be mature but it's got to go through the maturity process and every denomination every person's they stop the maturity process because they already perceived that they're mature Paul said you're yet children not being able to discern between Good and Evil we can't tell a false Revival from a word Revival is maturing now I'm I don't care about the rest of the world I don't if I could do away with the internet I'd do away with it today you know but it's other people that want it not me I only want to preach to the people that are in this room in the back too or if you're out in the car I don't want a worldwide Ministry I want to be faithful to the to those of you who have made the decision to sit and fellowship around God's word here but we need to mature to reality and we need to get rid of the false realities one of the greatest things brother Branham taught was the perception of symptoms what is perception the ability to see hear and become aware of something through the senses my arm hurts my headaches I'm sick the doctor says I'm sick the doctor says I have that the doctor says I have that all those things I can become aware of they're telling me they're true don't tell me they're not true I feel it prophet of God says you got a bad case of symptoms what's reality reality is by your stripes I'm Healed now you think you've got that no you don't we're fooling ourselves we've got a mature to that reality we've got to mature then we can look at those things that are and look at them as they are not because God's word said different that's maturing to reality that is not something that just you make up in your mind you've got to mature your life to it you've got to keep my Commandments he said if you keep my Commandments ask the father in my name anyway you can't take the keeping Commandments out of it and take the other part and call it faith that's not reality that's perception we got a whole lot of perception going on because we don't even sit down and get in front of the presence of the Lord and say Lord rid me of my perceptions I'm full of them I got more perceptions than all of you I've had 73 years to get them I don't know if there's anybody in here older than I am ah what are you here one month or two older than I am huh thank you brother James I was looking for something to bail me out perception it's a curse it's the curse that Eve got because she perceived what Satan was telling her was truth when the reality was the word he goes on he tells us he said you've got to be reunited again with another nature now let me ask you I just I'm here for you this morning because when when I leave this pulp but that Devil's gonna be in the seat of my truck and he's going to bring everything I've ever done and everything I've ever said and I only have one weapon to fight him with and the word of God said maybe I'll fail myself but I have not failed to declare unto them the truth of the Gospel you've got to mature you've got the hunger have you asked in your heart do you understand that the word says you're battling this nature you're battling The Temptations of your flesh you're battling your senses but the word of God says there's another nature for you to be United with have you ever sat down instead of fighting your perceptions and battling yourself and trying to get yourself in order falling down saying oh God I'll never do it again why am I this way and say wait a minute the reality of God's word says that there's another nature that I can have I don't perceive that nature but he said it's there Lord make that nature real I pray father because his flesh Wars against the spirit and Lord I'm caught in this battle but your word says reality says I have another nature and I can die to this fella let me mature to that reality let the word of God mature me let me hear it take it bite by bite word by word let it build my faith because I want to mature to that reality where I say if God said I have another nature I have another nature it's thus saith the Lord and I'm going to mature till I come to that perfection he goes on to say the bride knows where she's at very few and then he makes this statement in paragraph 221 but remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen you find before the grain can ripen everything in the stock has to be dead Hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it what is it that we're maturing to remember we read all those things earlier that if you don't know where you're going you can't get burned again unless you know what it does for you what does it mean to be borned again it means the old nature dies and the word nature the word comes into you what what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed to you personally what is the holy spirit it's Jesus Christ Living in you Prophet God said don't give me the shouting that's all that's good but don't shout no higher than you live he said don't judge it by that heathens do all the same thing how do you judge your life because you've matured into the reality of the word you live by the word you think the word the word is way it is the word is reality I don't care what everything says I don't care what my symptoms says the reality of it is though it's manifested I don't care I'm not judging it by the census I'm judging it I've matured to the place that if he says buy my stripes by his stripes I am healed I am healed I I don't care what the perception is prophet of God said he sat there and he'd eat a bite and he'd spit it up he'd take another bite he'd spend it out he'd take another bite he's faded on he said by his stripes I am healed never failed to walk in that reality though he suffered but one day he saw that little squirrel jump up and get stuck on that thorn and he lifted his hands and said on the wings of a snow white dove I've seen my Deliverance I've seen my healing so he goes on he just says it up close this morning you find before the grain can ripen everything else has to die Hallelujah can you see where yours where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in Bride formed same power same church same thing same word in Bride form what am I maturing to do I see that in my perception no but the word said that I'm going to be him and he's going to be in me the bride form that the word and the bride become one as he is so am I in this world that's the reality of the word now I've got to mature into that reality and the only way I'm going to mature to that reality is not looking at what I was but looking at what I'm going to be and denying every perception and put the vision of the well man in front of me and walk into it start looking at myself as a Christian start acting like a Christian start acting like he said start thinking like he said let this mind be in you that was in him we kind of mature to that it isn't going to fall out of the sky in the form of an anointing and then all of a sudden you say oh I've got it Hallelujah The Works that I do shall you do also start defeating them in your own sickness then you'll defeat them in others get the victory in your life and then you can get the victory in others I don't want to walk through that gate by myself I want to share that's what he did that's what he wanted again that's what he says and then he goes on to say he says he says you're the in Bride form same power same church the same word sucked through through these others and come up here come into the head here and all the life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming like into the head for a Rapture Hallelujah and then he says what is it he said you separated from your first Union by spiritual death have you done that have you finally told that guy he's a liar he's not what he says you are and the perception he's trying to sell you of yourself is not what the word of God says about you he said well you're a hothead well let me tell you something he threw that in the sea of God forgetfulness I'm going to overcome that I'm going to mature why because there's a seed in me and that seed in me has the power within itself to transform me in to what God said I would be we've got to mature out of our perceptions to the reality of What God Says if he says you separate First Union by Death now you're born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life The Germ that was in you at the beginning found you you found the seed now that seed's got to mature how does it mature it denies every perception it denies every reasoning it denies everything that that it says everything that's thrown in front of you everything that that comes about you even if everything that you've ever done can you accept one thing the reality of God's word that said that seed found me I don't care what you think about yourself because that's not real what's real is what he said whether you accept it or not whether you feel it or not or whether you see it or not what he said is truth what he said is the only reality is the only thing will last Heaven and Earth will pass away that perceptions will pass away but my word will not pass away forget yourself I'm tired of you Give Me Jesus right I'm not looking at you the way you look at yourselves we'd all be insane I'm looking at you the way that he sees you are redeemed son and daughter of God that's going to mature into the full statue of the love of God what is the Capstone herein is the love of God made known herein is the Capstone made known herein is how we know the Capstone has United with the bride as he is so are we in this world is that a reality to you or would you say I need to mature here I gotta quit being a child I've got to start taking my position in Christ I've got to start claiming the promises I gotta quit trusting in my degree I've got to get rid of this idea I've got to finish school before I can have a family I've got to get this rid of this idea I've got to pair pay my for my parents I got to get rid of this false idea that I got to pay for my wife oh just kills me perception is garbage the word is truth father Thy word is truth that's we pray father may they be one as We Are One the maturing to reality then he he goes on it's he says the the he's separating he said the germ of life that was in you found it he says he said Your name's now but now you're a new bride what's he saying he's telling all these things and then he comes down it wasn't he said you was accused but you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God from forgive forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom Warrior shame himself for you for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are predestinated seed how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it's no fault of your own oh to mature to that yes I did that yes I did that but you made me Satan it's no fault of my own you tricked me because you got my mother to pass on a different nature to me then I was really supposed to have and I've lived under that nature long enough but now I heard reality now I heard reality and the reality was that I'm not that person that's not my fault I was deceived into it lying preachers lying churches lying spirits that Satan that appeared as an angel of Light that would deceive the very elect if possible this is reality it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born an adulteress you're a sinner to begin with that's right you were deceived into it no you it ain't your fault you never did it how come you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life that little germ that was in you was to be you now I've got to mature into what that I was to be and I'm not David McGeary fighting this stinking flesh every day of my life I've got to surrender I've got to accept the fact I've got to accept my election I've got to call it the way the word says it I've got to live by God's word I've got to mature not to Sensations not to everything but I've got to mature to the place that it's Christ in me is my hope of glory if the same spirit that was in him dwells in me it'll Quicken my own mortal body I've got to mature out of my perceptions of religion out of my perceptions of worship out of all the things that man is coming up with and I've got to set this for me exactly what that he promised he promised that the I could be like him we always want the big works well how much little Works do you think he did every day in his life how many people do you think he pulled aside in the alley and talked to him and they got life how many people do you think he put his hand on and said go and sin no more he was a radiant Beauty of love shining in the lives of everybody he came in contact with don't you think we can mature to that Satan says you won't God says we will Satan says you've got too much flesh God said I threw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness Satan says I'm going to stop you nothing can stop God's word to come to pass Church don't be discouraged it's a day of rejoicing it's a day of rejoicing because we know that through the word of God we can mature out of our present condition and come into the full reality of Christ in us the hope of glory and I want to close with this this morning if I could just find it here I thought it was so beautiful how did he close this message with this request so where do I stand this morning I stand and I have to come to the realization that this body and this flesh and this nature is not my fault I didn't choose this I got it but I come to another reality that while I was yet a sinner he died for it and I realized something else as prodigal as I am the Good Shepherd leaves the 99. and finds the lost sheep and there's more rejoicing in heaven in him coming home I've got to realize that all these things in my mind all these things I'm thinking all these things that I'm seeing are not real they're just perception but I've got to mature to the reality of God's word that he took them all and threw him in the sea of God's forgetfulness and I've got to come to the place that what all things are possible all things how many things all things are possible I've got to come to the maturity if I ask anything in my father's name Hill granted I want to mature I don't want to stop here I want to get pulled from the shock into the full pure grain word and the prophet of God closed with this this morning I hope you took my words this morning as encouragement and if I'm shaking you a little bit this morning I'm not shaking you I'm shaking myself because time to see the greenness go out of the church and us to mature to real men and women yeah I don't care you can be 13 12 years old and be a real mature Christian Lord I'm asking the bride tonight the ones that feel has pulled away and waiting paragraph 340. and waiting may they separate themselves from everything in the world they must lay in the presence of the warm sunlight of the Son of God bathing in his word in his love granted Dear God what does the grain do in the Sun it matures into what it's to be in the first place what direction are we going in what are you trying to teach us where are you taking us pastor everything that I've been preaching and trying to tell you is that there's a maturity that we're going to mature into have we got there I don't know will we get there yes yes a prophet told us we would and that's thus saith the Lord to me do I need to lay in the Sun and ripen his word to mature yes am I doing it I need to do it more is the love of God shed abroad in my heart so my heart looks upon the needs of others though I speak with tongues of men and angels though I prophesy and have not charity it profiteth me nothing do I have room to mature I hope so I hope this isn't all that I can be Lord help me mature let me mature from perception to reality let me mature to the reality of your word
