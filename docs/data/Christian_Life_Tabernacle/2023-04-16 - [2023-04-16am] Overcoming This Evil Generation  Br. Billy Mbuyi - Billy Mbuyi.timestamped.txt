[9:25] Lord because time is in your hand
[9:28] Lord we commit ourselves into your hands
[9:30] Lord this morning and ask that you'd
[9:33] have your will and your way here Lord
[9:35] that you bring
[9:38] the word forth Lord and heal our disease
[9:42] Lord that you bring deliverance and joy
[9:44] and Victory
[9:45] Lord that your word would accomplish
[9:47] what you have set forth for it to do
[9:49] Lord
[9:51] Lord we
[9:53] are in anticipation an expectation Lord
[9:56] for you to visit us this morning Lord
[10:00] you said that whenever two or three were
[10:02] gathered together in Your Name Lord that
[10:04] you'd be in our midst Lord
[10:07] we're relying on that Lord
[10:10] come and keep your word
[10:13] let me just ask you feel welcome here
[10:15] and that you would just
[10:18] be gracious to us this morning in Jesus
[10:20] name we pray amen
[10:24] a bless you can turn around and just
[10:25] welcome somebody next to you just say
[10:27] God bless you I sure just don't ride by
[10:28] the mic with this song reading this
[10:30] morning
[10:37] you can also have your seats as what the
[10:39] Micah she's doing
[10:51] good morning
[10:54] [Applause]
[10:55] you know we've been uh
[10:57] we've been blessed over the years to
[10:59] have so many
[11:01] wonderful songs of the faith and of
[11:04] praise and worship
[11:06] and they can be an encouragement to us
[11:09] or
[11:10] they can be
[11:12] an expression of our praise
[11:15] but you know I I wonder you know as I
[11:17] was thinking about some of that is uh
[11:20] you know sometimes we enjoy the melody
[11:22] or the beat
[11:25] but I wonder if we pay attention to the
[11:27] words that we're singing
[11:31] you know if we're not careful we find
[11:33] ourselves singing something that
[11:36] you know we're responding to a song
[11:39] that isn't really Our Testimony
[11:42] it doesn't match our experience
[11:46] and for example
[11:49] there's an old gospel song that you know
[11:51] came to my mind this week as I was
[11:53] reading the psalm
[11:54] goes like this there's a River of Life
[11:58] flowing out from me
[12:01] it makes the lame to walk
[12:04] and the blind to see
[12:08] but I wonder how closely we listen to
[12:10] the words of that song
[12:13] it says there's a River of Life flowing
[12:16] out
[12:17] from me
[12:21] you know it's a life-giving river that
[12:23] changes how people walk
[12:26] it changes
[12:28] causes them to see
[12:31] it opens prison doors
[12:36] it's not something that happens to them
[12:37] when their favorite song is played in
[12:40] church
[12:42] but it's something that constantly
[12:43] proceeds
[12:45] from a people
[12:48] from me
[12:49] from you
[12:51] a river
[12:53] I was thinking about that as we were
[12:54] reading so as I was reading Psalm 46
[12:58] we're going to turn to that this morning
[13:02] you know there's a verse in verse 4
[13:04] that's very familiar I think to all of
[13:06] us
[13:09] it says there is a river
[13:13] the streams
[13:15] whereof shall make glad the city of God
[13:19] the holy place of the Tabernacle of the
[13:21] most high
[13:24] you know I wonder if there's anybody
[13:26] that's been to that River
[13:28] amen
[13:31] that I think we're all familiar with
[13:33] this River
[13:35] that the scripture speaks of this River
[13:38] of Life we sing about it and there's
[13:40] many scriptures about it we'll look at a
[13:41] couple of them this morning but
[13:43] you know as I was reading that a couple
[13:45] things about this River of Life
[13:48] kind of stuck out to me
[13:51] you know David
[13:52] says that this river is a source of
[13:55] gladness for the city of God
[13:58] you know and I got to thinking about
[14:00] that what is a city
[14:03] well you know it's a Dwelling Place
[14:07] it's a place of habitation
[14:10] it's a place where people live together
[14:15] dwell together in a community together
[14:21] but it's this the city of God is the
[14:24] place where he dwells with his people
[14:27] cohabitating dwelling together
[14:31] in Fellowship
[14:34] you know in fact he says this
[14:35] specifically in verse 5.
[14:38] he says God is in the midst of her
[14:43] she shall not be moved
[14:47] you know it's the it's a Dwelling Place
[14:49] of God a place that's established
[14:53] it's a place that's unmoving where God
[14:56] dwells with his people
[15:00] and this River
[15:02] is for those
[15:05] it's for those that are dwelling
[15:07] together with him
[15:10] you see there's a dwelling component
[15:13] of this River
[15:17] it makes glad those ones
[15:20] you know this isn't a place the river is
[15:22] not something you just visit every once
[15:25] in a while
[15:26] something you go and splash around in
[15:28] every once in a while when you have a
[15:29] good time
[15:32] but it's a constant state of being
[15:36] dwelling
[15:38] not just an occasional visit
[15:43] this isn't talking about something you
[15:45] visit on Sundays or Wednesdays or in
[15:48] special meetings
[15:50] but it's a benefit of being in a
[15:52] Dwelling Place
[15:54] in a constant state of being
[16:00] you know David says it this way in Psalm
[16:03] 1 and verse 2 and 3.
[16:07] speaking of one of those he says but his
[16:10] Delight
[16:12] what makes him happy
[16:13] what makes him glad
[16:16] is in the law of the Lord
[16:20] the word
[16:22] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[16:27] night
[16:28] constantly dwelling
[16:31] and he
[16:33] shall be like a tree planted
[16:37] by the rivers of water
[16:42] somebody who's very Delight is the word
[16:48] it's what makes him happy it's his
[16:50] Delight
[16:52] you notice the river is in his Delight
[16:54] the word is his delight and then the
[16:55] river is the benefit of dwelling in that
[16:58] word
[17:00] dwelling constantly in that word
[17:03] meditating day and night
[17:09] that person who's constantly dwelling in
[17:12] the word is like a tree planted by the
[17:14] rivers of water
[17:18] something that's planted is established
[17:21] it's a dwelling place it's a permanent
[17:24] place
[17:25] it's not a visit
[17:27] again not visiting the river
[17:30] constantly plugged into it
[17:34] you know it's uh
[17:37] those that are dwelling in the city of
[17:40] God benefit from this River as we'll
[17:42] read in psalm 46.
[17:45] those that are constantly dwelling in
[17:48] the word benefit from this River
[17:51] there's a dwelling component
[17:54] to being a beneficiary of that River of
[17:56] Life
[17:59] but the thing that also struck me is
[18:01] that this River has an effect
[18:04] you know in Psalm 46 it says it makes
[18:06] glad those in that Dwelling Place in
[18:08] Psalm 1 and verse 3 it says this and he
[18:11] shall be like a tree planted by the
[18:13] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[18:17] fruit
[18:18] in his season
[18:22] his Leaf also shall not wither
[18:25] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[18:30] so the effect of being plugged into this
[18:33] River
[18:34] is as it brings life
[18:37] it produces fruit
[18:40] it causes to grow it causes to be
[18:44] fruitful
[18:46] it's a life-giving effect
[18:50] that this water brings
[18:53] but Jesus said it this way in John 7 and
[18:56] verse 38.
[18:57] he said he that believeth on me as the
[19:01] scripture hath said out of his belly
[19:04] shall flow Rivers
[19:07] of Living Water
[19:10] see now this river is just not something
[19:12] you benefit from
[19:15] but it's something you produce
[19:17] it's something that flows out of you
[19:22] just like the song says there's a River
[19:24] of Life flowing out
[19:27] from me
[19:30] you see the effect of partaking of this
[19:32] River
[19:35] is is that you become a source of that
[19:37] River
[19:39] it's just not something you go and you
[19:40] Splash around and to have a good time
[19:42] but it's something that should cause you
[19:44] in turn
[19:46] to be a River of Life
[19:49] to bring forth life to someone else
[19:54] you know when Jesus was speaking to that
[19:56] Samaritan woman in John 4. the woman at
[19:59] the well he said this but whosoever
[20:01] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[20:03] him shall never thirst
[20:06] you know and sometimes we just stop
[20:08] right there
[20:10] that we you know our thirst is quenched
[20:13] when we drink of that water
[20:15] but he didn't stop there
[20:17] he said but the water that I shall give
[20:19] him shall be in him a well of water
[20:22] springing up
[20:24] into everlasting life
[20:26] see it's more than just about having our
[20:28] thirst quenched it's about becoming a
[20:31] source of life
[20:34] and that could only come by dwelling
[20:37] in that presence constantly
[20:41] there is a river the streams whereof
[20:44] shall make glad the city of God
[20:50] as the song says come to the river there
[20:52] come to the water there's a vast Supply
[20:56] but know this this isn't an invitation
[20:59] just to Splash around in the water a bit
[21:02] and have a good time
[21:04] as we'll read here in Psalm 46 this is
[21:07] about a dwelling place it's a call to
[21:09] come and dwell in that place
[21:12] where yes you benefit from the city but
[21:14] it's all about the dwelling
[21:17] it says in John 14 23 if a man loved me
[21:22] he will keep my words
[21:24] and my father will love him and we will
[21:26] come unto him and make our abode
[21:30] with him
[21:32] we can go ahead and stand this morning
[21:34] this was to turn to Psalm 46 you know
[21:36] more than anything this Psalm is a call
[21:39] to enter into a dwelling place as we'll
[21:41] read it's you know it starts in verse
[21:44] one God is our refuge and strength
[21:47] a very present help in a time of trouble
[21:50] and as you know we read this together
[21:52] consider what it would be to not have a
[21:54] refuge
[21:55] to not have a dwelling place to be
[21:58] planted next to that River
[22:01] in the hour that we're in it's almost
[22:03] like we'll be reading the front pages of
[22:05] the newspaper as we read this together
[22:07] but
[22:09] you know I'm grateful to have a Dwelling
[22:12] Place I'm grateful to have access to
[22:14] that River
[22:16] but you know the question is is it
[22:19] something we go and play around in every
[22:20] once in a while
[22:22] or is it something we're planted by is
[22:25] it something that's producing fruit is
[22:27] it something that's causing us to be
[22:29] able to impart life in others
[22:31] let's read that Psalm 46 together
[22:34] starting in verse 1 God is our refuge
[22:38] and strength a very present help and
[22:40] trouble therefore will not we fear
[22:43] though the Earth be removed and though
[22:45] the mountains be carried into the midst
[22:47] of the sea though the waters thereof
[22:49] Roar and be troubled though the
[22:51] mountains shake with the swelling
[22:53] thereof Selah there is a river the
[22:56] streams whereof shall make glad the city
[22:58] of God the holy place of the Tabernacles
[23:01] of the most high God is in the midst of
[23:04] her she shall not be moved God shall
[23:07] help her and that right early the heath
[23:10] enraged the kingdoms were moved he
[23:12] uttered his voice the Earth melted the
[23:15] Lord of hosts is with us the god of
[23:17] Jacob is our refuge Selah come Behold
[23:21] The Works of the Lord what desolations
[23:23] he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars
[23:26] to cease unto the end of the Earth he
[23:28] breakth the bow and cutteth the spear in
[23:31] sunder he burneth The Chariot in the
[23:33] fire be still and know that I am God I
[23:37] will be exalted among the Heathen I will
[23:39] be exalted in the Earth the Lord of
[23:42] hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our
[23:45] refuge Selah

[33:34] this morning Lord
[33:36] to know you by your name to know you by
[33:39] your attributes to Know You by this very
[33:41] message of the hour that you've provided
[33:43] for us Lord
[33:45] and Lord sometimes we just get carried
[33:47] away or sometimes we just get
[33:50] involved in things Lord and we just kind
[33:52] of
[33:53] get a little lukewarm Lauren
[33:56] but Lord there's come a time where a son
[33:58] just and a daughter knows that without
[34:02] you there's no life
[34:04] a year our life you're our peace you are
[34:07] everything Lord Jesus

[51:28] our Bibles this morning
[51:31] I try to work this thing out
[51:38] we will open to
[51:41] Revelation chapter 3 a very familiar
[51:44] scripture reading
[51:52] oh
[51:55] we'll start from the 14th verse
[52:03] amen
[52:05] are you happy to be in the house of God
[52:07] Amen good
[52:09] um it says and unto
[52:12] the angel of the Church of daudisi and
[52:15] write these things right
[52:19] these things say the amen and the
[52:22] faithful and the true witness the
[52:24] beginning of the creation of God it says
[52:28] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[52:30] cold nor hot I would I word that that
[52:34] were called oh hard it said so then
[52:38] because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold
[52:40] or hot nor hot I will spew thee out of
[52:44] my mouth
[52:45] because thou saith I'm rich and I'm
[52:48] increased with good I have need of
[52:50] nothing and knoweth not that thou are
[52:53] wretched and miserable and poor and
[52:55] blind and naked they said I cancel thee
[52:59] to buy of me gold Trident fire
[53:03] that thou may have to be rich and white
[53:06] Raymond that that thou may be clothed
[53:08] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[53:11] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[53:14] thyself that thou may have seen it says
[53:17] as many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[53:20] be zealous therefore and repent so so
[53:24] the the way back or or the Zeal that is
[53:28] calling for is is the the repentance the
[53:31] ability to recognize that you are wrong
[53:33] and repent and come back it says that
[53:36] that you come back that you repent and
[53:39] you be zealous therefore and repent it
[53:42] says behold I stand at the door and
[53:45] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[53:47] open the door I will come in
[53:50] to him and will sup with him and he with
[53:54] me
[53:56] to him that overcometh I will grant a
[53:59] seat with me in my throne even as I
[54:02] overcome and am set with my father in
[54:05] his throne he that has an ear let him
[54:08] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[54:10] Church Father we ask you blessed word to
[54:13] us this morning Lord that you may just
[54:15] come by our way and speak to us in the
[54:17] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen let me
[54:19] have your seats this morning
[54:23] so this morning we'll try not to be too
[54:28] long I want to speak on overcoming this
[54:31] evil generation
[54:33] and it's important as the description we
[54:36] just read of of the age that we are
[54:38] living in the prophet is telling us this
[54:41] is uh perhaps a summary of the age as
[54:44] you would say this is an evil age and it
[54:48] says the god of his of this evil age is
[54:51] Satan we know that when he said that
[54:54] Satan this is we we it calls this age or
[54:57] the time that we are living in he calls
[55:00] it Satan's Eden and it talks about how
[55:03] it's by through education science and
[55:05] technology that has become the god of
[55:08] this evil age is used uh men's knowledge
[55:12] to to create and to civilize and to do
[55:15] the things that we are in and everything
[55:17] around us is designed by him it says
[55:20] here that this is a lukewarm age meaning
[55:23] it's the age where people are not hot or
[55:27] cold they are lukewarm which is a mixing
[55:29] so in other words it's okay for you to
[55:32] be a little bit religious and a little
[55:35] bit in the world that will go through
[55:37] but we find out that the the requirement
[55:40] is that he would he would that that
[55:42] would be cold or hot that you'll be
[55:44] perfectly identified so so it's an age
[55:47] even as we we look at what's happening
[55:50] outside we can see Barbara will tell us
[55:53] it's the age of complete deception uh
[55:56] deception to where we we've gotten to a
[55:59] place where people don't even know
[56:00] whether they are men or woman talk about
[56:03] lukewarm talking about mixing talking
[56:05] about time where uh uh uh Satan's has
[56:09] become the god of this evil Age and and
[56:12] we can see as it was promised that is
[56:14] growing bigger and bigger we we could
[56:17] say you know five years ago that perhaps
[56:20] it was bad to be in this world and the
[56:22] things that were happening but we can
[56:24] surely say today is worse than it was
[56:27] five years ago
[56:28] when and we we are also guaranteed that
[56:31] if we continue to live it will be worse
[56:34] than it is today so it's not getting
[56:36] better it's getting worse then the
[56:38] prophet will talk about how the world is
[56:41] out of control and and the countries are
[56:44] out of control the economy is out of
[56:46] control I was sitting and thinking about
[56:48] this I realized the the people are
[56:51] applying things that they have applied
[56:53] in the past where they knew well if this
[56:56] happened we do this we should be able to
[56:57] stop it and now it's not working anymore
[57:01] they've run out of knowledge they they
[57:03] try to save faces and trying to assure
[57:06] that things are under control but we
[57:08] know they are not under control it's a
[57:10] complete chaos and and and the people
[57:13] are here it's a it's the age of a woman
[57:16] but the prophet will say the rights and
[57:19] people's rights and everything and and
[57:21] yes and you can ask yourself we live in
[57:23] such a time where we don't even have the
[57:26] proper definition of what a woman is
[57:28] it it's amazing people that are educated
[57:31] people that went to school people that
[57:34] are that have studied and understand
[57:36] they will stand there and and and will
[57:39] will not be able to answer a question of
[57:42] what a woman is and you will look at
[57:44] them and wonder what has happened to the
[57:46] man what has happened to this world it's
[57:49] what was promised will happen this is
[57:52] what happened when Jesus is taken out of
[57:54] the church this is what happened when
[57:56] God is no longer in schools this was
[57:59] what happened when God is taken out of
[58:01] our Lives all that's left is complete
[58:04] chaos oh my all that's left is is a
[58:08] complete wandering and and I begin to
[58:11] think about that this morning and I say
[58:13] aren't we glad for the message of the
[58:15] hour
[58:16] aren't we glad that God has sent us a
[58:19] message to take her out of this
[58:21] confusing situation out of this
[58:24] wandering situation of this endless mind
[58:27] game situation to bring us into the
[58:30] bright age to those that have received
[58:33] this message they're no longer they are
[58:35] in the world but they are not of the
[58:37] world they are no longer subject to the
[58:40] things of laodicea they are in the world
[58:42] but they are living in another Age The
[58:45] Prophet will tell us it's brought us the
[58:48] message to get us ready so we can go in
[58:51] the Rapture the word that we have
[58:53] received is not for us to look and try
[58:56] to comprehend the things that are
[58:58] happening in the world but it's a word
[59:00] that so that we can get ready and be
[59:02] taken out of here
[59:04] Oh my he would come and it would it
[59:07] would tell us how the believer it's not
[59:10] time to get distracted anymore it's not
[59:13] time to to to let your work become uh
[59:16] take uh become the most important thing
[59:19] it's not time to let the case of Life
[59:22] take you over it's time to understand
[59:24] that this world is going to an end the
[59:28] cup of iniquity is filling up every day
[59:31] and at any moment we will be gone out of
[59:34] here we are promised it could be in the
[59:36] next minute in the next hour it's not
[59:39] time to get distracted
[59:41] don't don't get caught outside don't get
[59:44] caught trying to or figure out things or
[59:47] don't get caught being into trouble and
[59:49] difficulties or getting the bolted I'll
[59:53] say this morning get in the ark of the
[59:55] word of God let it get you ready for you
[59:58] to be taken out of here let it be the
[1:00:00] first thing in your mind when you wake
[1:00:02] up Let it Be the thing that takes up
[1:00:04] most of your mind every day you walk
[1:00:06] around
[1:00:08] there's no promise there is no hope for
[1:00:12] this world it's gone the only hope we
[1:00:15] have is the word that we have received
[1:00:17] and let this word becomes everything to
[1:00:20] you and I want to say this let's make
[1:00:23] our lives more important this life of
[1:00:26] the Gospel more important than anything
[1:00:28] we have
[1:00:30] so here he is he gives us the
[1:00:32] description of the time that we are
[1:00:34] living in and and Jesus would say the
[1:00:37] prophet will say in the message that
[1:00:39] thou they see in church age it says and
[1:00:42] today when and this is paragraph 253
[1:00:45] says and and it says and today when
[1:00:48] Jesus is standing outside of the
[1:00:50] Pentecostal organization the baptism
[1:00:53] organ the Baptist organization Methodist
[1:00:56] organization trying to get back in with
[1:01:00] the Pentecost again it says the people
[1:01:03] are passing by
[1:01:06] the people are passing by it says after
[1:01:09] you it says after you your worldliness
[1:01:12] and the things has pushed him out of the
[1:01:16] church
[1:01:17] what push them out at the church instead
[1:01:20] of the church being the the body of
[1:01:22] Christ the representative of who he is
[1:01:25] his life being reflected in them they've
[1:01:28] they've allowed things to come in and in
[1:01:31] letting the things to come in it's
[1:01:33] pushed them out
[1:01:35] the way we push them out is by allowing
[1:01:38] the worldliness come into our life is by
[1:01:40] allowing our cares of life to come into
[1:01:43] our lives and take over in that way it's
[1:01:45] pushed out and and he says he pushed him
[1:01:48] out of the church and says he's standing
[1:01:51] trying crying to get back in again and
[1:01:56] oh it's the most pathetic things I've
[1:01:58] seen in my life he said had had no need
[1:02:03] of him he says outside knocking trying
[1:02:06] to get back in that's the same thing
[1:02:08] he's trying to do today
[1:02:11] why he he was outside if you could
[1:02:15] excuse me yeah he is the the the the the
[1:02:18] very uh Lord Of Glory the the very
[1:02:22] master who knows your life and who can
[1:02:25] guide you the one who made you the one
[1:02:27] who knows exactly what you have need of
[1:02:30] we've taken him and put him outside and
[1:02:33] we're trying to solve our problems for
[1:02:35] ourselves we've taken him and put him
[1:02:38] outside and we're trying to figure out
[1:02:40] life ourselves here he is the one who
[1:02:43] has all the solution we've taken him and
[1:02:45] put him out and now the prophet will
[1:02:47] tell us and because they have done that
[1:02:49] the Lord is no longer dealing with the
[1:02:52] church he's not knocking into the hearts
[1:02:54] of individual and those who have
[1:02:56] accepted him he's making himself known
[1:02:59] unto them
[1:03:01] this is not a group thing anymore this
[1:03:04] is not time to say well because my
[1:03:06] parents believe because no one believed
[1:03:09] that means I'm good now you're not good
[1:03:10] this is the time so you can know him for
[1:03:13] yourself this is the time where he's
[1:03:16] making himself known to the individual
[1:03:18] this is the time where he's opening up
[1:03:21] of himself and Whispering secret to
[1:03:24] those who will hear him
[1:03:25] now we're speaking about overcoming this
[1:03:28] evil Age and and the prophet will say in
[1:03:31] the marriage of the Lamb he says you see
[1:03:33] God could not push us through a little
[1:03:36] pipe pull us out the other end and then
[1:03:40] say blessed is he that overcometh
[1:03:43] so this this overcoming that we're
[1:03:46] talking about is not God taking you and
[1:03:49] doing everything for you and pushing you
[1:03:52] through and then you come to the other
[1:03:54] side you said bless God I'm an overcomer
[1:03:56] says no you had nothing to do to
[1:04:00] overcome he said he just pushed you
[1:04:02] through but you've got to make decisions
[1:04:05] for yourself it says I have to make
[1:04:08] decisions for myself in doing that we
[1:04:12] show our faith and respect to God so
[1:04:16] when we talk about this overcoming and
[1:04:18] and Oh Maya begin to realize what the
[1:04:21] Lord is speaking here it's so important
[1:04:23] we understand overcoming is not just a
[1:04:26] label that you are given overcoming is
[1:04:29] the process you have to go through when
[1:04:31] you're in the mud and you are down and
[1:04:34] you you taste of the defeat and and out
[1:04:37] of defeat something happened to you and
[1:04:39] you that was defeated you begin to stand
[1:04:43] up and to over overcome the things that
[1:04:45] they were challenging to you overcoming
[1:04:47] is wanting an experience so you can have
[1:04:51] an experience to know what is it that
[1:04:53] word that it is to be a sinner but at
[1:04:55] the same time he wants you to come to a
[1:04:57] place where you've tasted of his
[1:04:59] goodness and you know what it means to
[1:05:02] be a conqueror the very things that were
[1:05:04] taking you down now you have the ability
[1:05:07] to withstand them not another person but
[1:05:10] you the same person that went down let
[1:05:13] me tell you this the resurrection who
[1:05:15] the one who came up is not of the
[1:05:17] different person who went down the same
[1:05:20] Jesus that went down the same one who
[1:05:23] went down is the same one who
[1:05:24] Resurrected
[1:05:26] and therefore when we talk about her
[1:05:29] going through it's a learning process
[1:05:31] that God his warning is believing
[1:05:34] children to taste of and to be aware of
[1:05:37] so is trying to tutor us so we can
[1:05:40] become mature Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:42] so we can know what it means to taste
[1:05:45] victory
[1:05:47] oh my he's trying to give us an
[1:05:51] experience with the word so in other
[1:05:53] words when you say I know God Is A
[1:05:57] Healer in other words you've tasted of
[1:05:59] that healing yourself
[1:06:01] you know what it means to be sick but
[1:06:04] then you also know what it means for
[1:06:06] your body to begin to restore you know
[1:06:09] what it means for your body to begin
[1:06:11] just like the testimonies we heard this
[1:06:13] morning that is overcoming oh I began to
[1:06:16] think about Jacob my one who was born in
[1:06:20] China one who just knew how to to run
[1:06:23] everybody around and he just knew how to
[1:06:26] to do wrong in all his life that's what
[1:06:28] he knew oh but it came a time where he
[1:06:31] sinned caught up with himself but he
[1:06:34] stood there and he realized he was in
[1:06:36] complete the faith and he had to
[1:06:38] overcome something
[1:06:40] oh when the Angels showed up and he
[1:06:43] began to wrestle with an angel he went
[1:06:45] down and he went up and he he went down
[1:06:48] and he hold him he held him until the
[1:06:51] sun was coming up then the angel said
[1:06:53] let me go he said I will not let you go
[1:06:56] until you bless me that's overcoming
[1:06:58] that
[1:07:00] the overcome is not without a fight it's
[1:07:03] one who's gone in the mud and descends
[1:07:05] up is one who knows something about
[1:07:07] winning
[1:07:09] and let me tell you you never know
[1:07:11] something about winning unless you've
[1:07:13] been in a fight
[1:07:15] Oh my he he wants us to move from being
[1:07:19] paved into Sons and Daughters who
[1:07:22] understands something about the power of
[1:07:25] God and the power of His word
[1:07:28] and I want to say this
[1:07:30] God has secured our overcoming in Christ
[1:07:36] and his ear manifesting The Works of
[1:07:40] what he has already done
[1:07:42] in other words this overcoming it's not
[1:07:46] us that are fighting the devil for the
[1:07:49] first time no he's taken a devil he's
[1:07:53] not the truth out of him he's made him
[1:07:55] nothing he's taken the power out of him
[1:07:58] so that these believing children can
[1:08:01] come and claim what belongs to them
[1:08:05] he overcame for us
[1:08:08] but he wants you this morning to stand
[1:08:11] up and say I believe that God did
[1:08:14] something for me I believe that my
[1:08:16] healing I've already got it I believe
[1:08:19] that my Deliverance is already purchased
[1:08:21] for therefore I'm standing out of my I'm
[1:08:24] standing and raising her out of the mud
[1:08:27] therefore I'm raising out out of my
[1:08:29] situation and I'm going to the devil to
[1:08:31] claim what belongs to me
[1:08:36] oh my
[1:08:38] let me say this
[1:08:39] it's important we understand
[1:08:42] that the overcoming is what gives you
[1:08:45] character
[1:08:48] without overcoming oh without the
[1:08:51] overcoming you have no character
[1:08:53] without the overcoming you just
[1:08:55] wondering oh I thank Jesus he did this
[1:08:58] for me you go to the devil you grab it
[1:09:01] out of his dirty hands Jesus has already
[1:09:04] paid a price this has already overcome
[1:09:07] for you but it's now your turn let me
[1:09:10] say this faith in the word of God will
[1:09:12] produce the good why because he paid for
[1:09:15] the good what he needs us as believing
[1:09:17] children this morning is to stand upon
[1:09:20] the victory that he already won so we
[1:09:23] can go and claim whatever we have made
[1:09:25] of this morning
[1:09:27] I need Deliverance go get it I need
[1:09:30] healing go get it I need salvation go
[1:09:33] get it it's already paid for he already
[1:09:36] overcame the devil for you you just go
[1:09:39] through the hands and grab it
[1:09:43] oh my what a place to be now I want to
[1:09:48] say this the process of receiving what
[1:09:50] we are asking for it's not dependent on
[1:09:54] the devil
[1:09:55] it's dependent on the believer
[1:09:58] to come and take and ask what is it that
[1:10:01] they have need of
[1:10:03] we can't blame the devil anymore we
[1:10:05] can't say well I can't be healed because
[1:10:07] the devil no
[1:10:09] Christ's already paid the price in fact
[1:10:12] the prophet will stand time and time
[1:10:13] again he says I can't heal you and if
[1:10:16] any man says he can heal you he's a liar
[1:10:19] that process of healing that power of
[1:10:22] healing was already given to the
[1:10:24] believer and let me just read this Oh I
[1:10:27] thought this just burned my heart as I
[1:10:30] came across it and and there are things
[1:10:32] in life where you you you you walk
[1:10:35] around and you study the Bible you study
[1:10:38] the message you have a certain
[1:10:39] understanding and you walk in it so so
[1:10:42] long but yet there comes a time where
[1:10:44] the Prophet you read something it
[1:10:46] completely changes the view that you had
[1:10:50] now he's speaking here it says
[1:10:53] he he speaks here in the prayer I forgot
[1:10:56] the name of the message I didn't write
[1:10:57] it down he says oh I say sir he says
[1:11:01] this Lord give us your promise this give
[1:11:04] give to us this promise it says I asked
[1:11:08] the father he says ask the father
[1:11:10] anything in my name I will do it it says
[1:11:14] yeah that's our promise it isn't free it
[1:11:19] isn't our faith in our prayer then it's
[1:11:23] just our faith in doing what he said do
[1:11:28] oh my it's not because I prayed I felt
[1:11:32] like heaven came down no it's not even
[1:11:35] because I have this certain ability to
[1:11:37] do something it's not it's not because I
[1:11:40] feel good at doing it but I'm just doing
[1:11:43] it because that's what he said to do
[1:11:46] right that's why you can remove all of
[1:11:48] the emotions overcoming you you can
[1:11:51] overcome when you are at the weakest
[1:11:54] place that you've ever been
[1:11:55] it's not because I shouted that means I
[1:11:58] overcame you can be in the dump and you
[1:12:01] can overcome out of it you can feel like
[1:12:04] a failure still overcome you don't have
[1:12:06] to be at the mountain top to overcome
[1:12:08] you can be in the valley and still
[1:12:10] overcome why because you did what he
[1:12:13] said to do
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:18] in another place now he talks about
[1:12:20] David and it says now notice notice this
[1:12:24] channel on the other side he didn't
[1:12:25] believe neither he says he didn't
[1:12:27] believe it he says neither will cancel
[1:12:30] he laughed and he says am I a dog and
[1:12:34] and you send a kid to come here and
[1:12:37] fight me he said I'll pick him up I'll
[1:12:39] pick you up on the end of my Spear and
[1:12:43] let the bird eat your flesh he says why
[1:12:46] he had all he said all everything on his
[1:12:50] side this is Goliath speaking now listen
[1:12:53] to this it says but you see
[1:12:56] that didn't Shake David
[1:12:59] at all he says why
[1:13:01] it was revealed to him
[1:13:04] he had the faith in what it was doing
[1:13:09] he had the faith in what he was doing in
[1:13:13] other words he had an understanding him
[1:13:15] himself I'm doing what God told me to do
[1:13:18] I'm speaking because God told me to
[1:13:21] speak I tell you when Moses speak it's
[1:13:23] not because he felt Almighty all he knew
[1:13:26] is I met a god in the wilderness he told
[1:13:29] me to go to Sparrow and speak and I'm
[1:13:32] here standing before you and saying let
[1:13:34] my people go in other words he said it
[1:13:37] knowing that the word The God Who gave
[1:13:39] me the words to speak the God who
[1:13:41] inspired me to speak he will come and
[1:13:43] make his word true
[1:13:45] now he says he node he knowed he was
[1:13:49] going to do it and he did it he it's
[1:13:52] because that is that was it was revealed
[1:13:55] to him and he know where he was standing
[1:13:58] and then he says and if God will speak
[1:14:01] that right down to your heart tonight
[1:14:03] you said you want he says you are not
[1:14:06] going to be laying in the bed in the bed
[1:14:09] you are not going to be sitting sitting
[1:14:12] in that chair he says you are you are
[1:14:15] going to be well they could he says
[1:14:17] there couldn't be anything change your
[1:14:20] mind in it
[1:14:22] but until that happens every preacher in
[1:14:26] the world could pray and I don't it says
[1:14:29] I don't say it wouldn't help you it
[1:14:33] would I would encourage you but until
[1:14:36] until that Faith see healing power is in
[1:14:43] you
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:46] I don't it says I it don't come from the
[1:14:50] preacher
[1:14:51] it comes to you by revelation
[1:14:54] oh my brother my sister we have taken
[1:14:58] the power that's given to us and handed
[1:15:00] over to preachers we have taken the
[1:15:02] power that's handed to us and we've
[1:15:04] given it to other things the prophet is
[1:15:06] telling you this morning the power of
[1:15:09] Revelation comes from God and the power
[1:15:12] of healing is already in you the power
[1:15:15] of saving is already in you the power to
[1:15:18] be delivered is already in you this
[1:15:20] morning when you come it's a it's a sign
[1:15:24] that there's something in you that's
[1:15:26] already calling for the power to come to
[1:15:28] manifestation in other words it's just a
[1:15:31] deep calling unto the Deep
[1:15:34] why do you need saving unless say
[1:15:37] something in there that wants to be
[1:15:39] saved that's calling for a savior why do
[1:15:42] you need healing unless there's
[1:15:44] something in you that's already
[1:15:46] testifying of the healing
[1:15:52] in fact the prophet will send it says
[1:15:54] it's not me
[1:15:55] it's you that operate the gift it's not
[1:15:58] me that's doing it it's you you keep
[1:16:01] calling on God that the light will move
[1:16:04] and you will move from one person and
[1:16:05] it'll follow where the light is going
[1:16:07] what was it it was already in the people
[1:16:10] faith in the word will is what is going
[1:16:13] to produce the good
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:17] oh my I wish I had a voice to preach
[1:16:19] this morning we take all of that's given
[1:16:23] to the believer we hand it over
[1:16:26] we wait oh God I need this is all said
[1:16:29] the reason why you're asking it is
[1:16:31] because I placed it in you didn't they
[1:16:34] say that everything that the seed has
[1:16:36] need of is already inside of it then
[1:16:39] they promise that it's already whatever
[1:16:42] nutrients whatever all you need is a
[1:16:45] revelation this morning oh my God give
[1:16:48] us Revelation Quicken our hearts so we
[1:16:51] know what is it that we are capable of
[1:16:53] what is it that we can do why is it that
[1:16:56] we can manifest in our life
[1:16:58] it's not waiting for somebody to come
[1:17:01] and manifest it for you but it's in you
[1:17:03] already
[1:17:06] so yeah we are so I say this morning
[1:17:09] faith faith in the word
[1:17:13] faith in the word of God will produce
[1:17:15] the promise faith in the promises of God
[1:17:19] will bring God into manifestation for
[1:17:22] your life now the prophet will also say
[1:17:25] to overcome is to keep life in you now I
[1:17:28] want to say this there is something out
[1:17:31] there in this world that's constantly

[1:21:15] out of each age overcomes the temptation
[1:21:18] of that age and has got a scripture here
[1:21:21] for here he says I don't I don't think
[1:21:25] we really have time to make it but I
[1:21:28] know each one of the church ages same
[1:21:31] now it's just the same it's just like
[1:21:34] the same one who is it says see
[1:21:37] he said it at the beginning you are born
[1:21:40] defeated
[1:21:43] as I said in the beginning you were born
[1:21:45] defeated now this overcoming he's
[1:21:49] wanting to make it very clear it's not
[1:21:53] an Overcoming By The Elements of the
[1:21:55] world
[1:21:56] by one overcoming the World by the world
[1:22:00] it's not overcoming the World by
[1:22:03] thinking more of the world or by trying
[1:22:05] to rearrange the element of the world
[1:22:08] that's not where the overcoming comes
[1:22:10] from it says and that birth can never
[1:22:14] get you bring you to life because you
[1:22:17] are born defeated you are you are in a
[1:22:20] defeated World among defeated people
[1:22:22] among defeated Creed defeated
[1:22:25] denomination you've got to come to
[1:22:28] Victory somehow
[1:22:31] now that that covers everything that
[1:22:35] covers all that it is about Man part of
[1:22:38] the overcoming is the realization or the
[1:22:41] recognition that this flesh is already
[1:22:43] defeated there is nothing good that
[1:22:46] comes God can come out of this faith I'm
[1:22:49] born defeated there's no way it doesn't
[1:22:51] matter how good you try to do
[1:22:54] it doesn't matter how many times you try
[1:22:57] or for those of you that have lived a
[1:22:59] little longer you realize that however
[1:23:01] many times you try you will always find
[1:23:04] yourself to the same place
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:07] but it's not by education or by theology
[1:23:11] but this overcoming comes by the new
[1:23:14] birth one must be born again by the seed
[1:23:18] that's inside of them one must realize I
[1:23:21] cannot overcome by this flesh there has
[1:23:24] to be something else that God has placed
[1:23:27] inside of a Believer by which they can
[1:23:30] overcome now listen to this it says in
[1:23:33] first John chapter 5 verse 1 through 5
[1:23:36] it says whosoever believeth that Jesus
[1:23:39] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[1:23:42] loves of him that loves him that be God
[1:23:45] loved him also that is begotten of him
[1:23:49] it says by this we know that we love the
[1:23:53] children of God that we love the
[1:23:55] children of God when we love God and
[1:23:59] keep his commandment for this is the law
[1:24:02] the love of God
[1:24:09] previous he says for whatsoever is born
[1:24:13] of God
[1:24:15] overcometh the world
[1:24:18] so the secret to overcoming the world is
[1:24:22] to be born of God
[1:24:24] I want to be born of God I want to be
[1:24:28] born of God in my mind in my spirit in
[1:24:31] my soul in everything that I do I want
[1:24:34] to be part of God
[1:24:36] I want everything that comes out of
[1:24:39] those places to be vetted by the word of
[1:24:42] God to be brought forth by the word of
[1:24:44] God to be changed covered by the word of
[1:24:47] God the thinking of God the mind of God
[1:24:50] the spirit of God the soul of God
[1:24:52] functioning in me
[1:24:55] it says and this is the victory that
[1:24:58] overcomes the world if in our faith
[1:25:00] whosoever he says who is who is he that
[1:25:04] overcomes the world but he that
[1:25:06] believeth that Jesus is the son of God
[1:25:10] we are not called to overcome the world
[1:25:12] with the world
[1:25:16] I say that because we do it a lot
[1:25:19] including myself
[1:25:21] something will happen and
[1:25:24] my great mind
[1:25:27] starts to find solution
[1:25:29] starts to rearranged situations what if
[1:25:33] this didn't really happen what if I
[1:25:34] could go back and change over here what
[1:25:36] if I could do this it will only produce
[1:25:39] a bigger failure
[1:25:44] I was thinking and this just came to me
[1:25:48] I was
[1:25:50] it was when we were listening to the
[1:25:53] tape about faith and I was
[1:25:55] fellowshipping with Brother David and he
[1:25:57] just became so apparent and just spoke
[1:26:01] to my heart
[1:26:02] we're not going to get him too far
[1:26:05] so and this was when the prophet is here
[1:26:09] now speaking about we have to have an
[1:26:12] experience
[1:26:13] and it just came to my heart I was
[1:26:16] thinking about Yaris Goliath of the
[1:26:19] standing and challenging the children of
[1:26:21] Israel he's there standing there and
[1:26:23] boasting forth and and Burman says David
[1:26:26] at an experience and I thought if you go
[1:26:30] and you read the story and you begin to
[1:26:32] look at it Goliath the The Saul had an
[1:26:36] experience but he understood that his
[1:26:39] experience was not enough to fight
[1:26:41] Goliath
[1:26:43] the scripture says he was Head and
[1:26:46] Shoulders he was well trained in the
[1:26:50] sword and he just knew how to Willow the
[1:26:52] soul he had a special way to dress
[1:26:55] himself to war he he fought a lot of
[1:26:58] wars and he overcame it
[1:26:59] now but this one he knew this is
[1:27:02] different he summed up all his
[1:27:05] experience about everything now I'm
[1:27:07] talking about carnal and carnal mind and
[1:27:11] I'm talking about spiritual mind I'm
[1:27:13] talking about overcoming the world the
[1:27:15] with the world and overcoming the World
[1:27:17] by the word of God so here is one who
[1:27:20] had an understanding who just knew the
[1:27:22] tactics and everything but yet all of
[1:27:25] that was carnal it was something Saul
[1:27:27] was chosen by man
[1:27:30] so therefore everything that he could
[1:27:32] come up with was the best that men can
[1:27:34] come up with but before this giant that
[1:27:37] was not good enough but yet David yes
[1:27:40] who it was this little young child and
[1:27:42] who that just seemed like he was not
[1:27:44] even Faith to fight but he had a
[1:27:46] different kind of experience and his
[1:27:49] experience was God my father had let me
[1:27:53] watch the ship and when I was watching
[1:27:55] the ship a lion came to take it a lion
[1:27:59] came and he took one of the ships and he
[1:28:01] says I followed him I took it out of his
[1:28:04] mouth and I killed him so he knew
[1:28:07] something about positioning he knew
[1:28:09] something about when God places you
[1:28:11] somewhere when God calls you to do
[1:28:14] something that there's nothing that can
[1:28:16] stop you
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:20] he knew something about the bear coming
[1:28:23] up
[1:28:24] oh the bear came in because I was in my
[1:28:27] position he was in his heart to protect
[1:28:29] the sheep that God placed under his his
[1:28:32] care so he went and he slew it
[1:28:36] therefore when he stood there the
[1:28:39] experience spoke to him once again he
[1:28:42] knew that with this kind of experience I
[1:28:45] have just been anointed king of Israel
[1:28:48] and if that is the true that God has
[1:28:51] anointed me King over Israel I have the
[1:28:54] power to go and protect them
[1:28:59] my brother my sister worldly experience
[1:29:02] will not get you anywhere
[1:29:04] let's get this inspiration by the word
[1:29:06] of God let's get this inspiration by God
[1:29:09] and the scripture says as many as
[1:29:12] receive him to them give any power for
[1:29:15] them to become
[1:29:17] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:21] by inspiration of God
[1:29:24] coming upon you and leading you
[1:29:28] oh I want to overcome the world the evil
[1:29:32] age that I'm living in and the only way
[1:29:35] to overcome is by the word of God but
[1:29:39] when the scripture will say in John 16
[1:29:41] and 28 it says
[1:29:44] let me start from for the sake of time
[1:29:46] he says 31 it says Jesus answered and
[1:29:50] said Do you believe he says behold the
[1:29:53] hour has come the hour cometh here is
[1:29:56] now that ye shall be scattered in every
[1:30:00] man to his own and he shall live and
[1:30:03] shall leave them alone he says and yet
[1:30:06] I'm not alone because the father is with
[1:30:09] me this thing I've spoken to you that ye
[1:30:12] may have that ye might know that ye may
[1:30:15] have peace in the world
[1:30:17] they may have peace in the world ye
[1:30:20] shall have tribulation but be of good
[1:30:23] cheer I have overcome the world
[1:30:29] the one who's sending you he's the one
[1:30:32] who overcame the world
[1:30:34] the one I'm too glad we know someone who
[1:30:37] overcame the world Jesus remember what
[1:30:40] I'm says and what was the Holy Spirit
[1:30:43] given for or what is a holy ghost it
[1:30:45] says the the way the same way that God
[1:30:48] sent Jesus is the same way that he's
[1:30:50] sending you he says how did he send
[1:30:53] Jesus the father that sent him went in
[1:30:56] him so if the father that sent him went
[1:30:59] in him the Jesus who's sending you he's
[1:31:02] growing in you my brother my sister if I
[1:31:05] want to do something I want to find
[1:31:08] somebody who knows something about it
[1:31:11] don't give me give me something somebody
[1:31:13] was trying to learn together with
[1:31:19] her with give me somebody who knows what
[1:31:21] they're talking about so this Jesus is
[1:31:23] saying to you don't be fearful don't be
[1:31:27] afraid I have overcome the world and the
[1:31:30] prophet will tell you that everything
[1:31:32] that you went through he went through
[1:31:37] you say he doesn't know anything about
[1:31:39] my situation he does
[1:31:41] the headache that you go through the
[1:31:44] suffering that you go he knows something
[1:31:46] about being dead
[1:31:48] he knows something about being healed he
[1:31:52] knows something about having a headache
[1:31:54] he knows something about oh my carrying
[1:31:57] the burden of the Cross and getting to a
[1:32:00] place where you can't carry the weight
[1:32:02] and you crumble down
[1:32:04] and you need someone to help you
[1:32:08] if he doesn't know anything that you're
[1:32:11] going through then he cannot be the high
[1:32:14] priest
[1:32:15] makes him the high priest is that this
[1:32:18] morning whatever situation you're going
[1:32:20] through he knows about it
[1:32:22] and he himself has been through it
[1:32:25] therefore he can come and Whisper to
[1:32:27] your ears says I I know something about
[1:32:30] this
[1:32:31] you know comforting from someone who's
[1:32:34] been through where you've been is the
[1:32:36] one that helps
[1:32:38] it's not one who knows nothing about
[1:32:40] well at least one who's honest it will
[1:32:42] help but one who's been in the trenches
[1:32:45] to know what it means to be defeated he
[1:32:48] says you know I know something about
[1:32:50] being tempted
[1:32:53] you're a teenager oh yeah I was a
[1:32:55] teenager
[1:32:57] I know something about
[1:32:59] your mind and
[1:33:01] you're thinking and your body changing
[1:33:05] and the things you old folks he says I
[1:33:07] know what you go through he says I was a
[1:33:10] young man and I know what it means to
[1:33:12] work up and perhaps bill you feel your
[1:33:14] body tired and and things like that he
[1:33:17] fall asleep in the boat he didn't fake
[1:33:20] it he was tired and to fall asleep
[1:33:26] he says I know something about
[1:33:29] overcoming
[1:33:30] now he says to you
[1:33:33] that's why it's important and I know I'm
[1:33:35] not going to be able to get to the end
[1:33:37] but let me say this here
[1:33:39] when he gives you his word
[1:33:42] he's giving you the formula to
[1:33:44] overcoming
[1:33:48] the word of God is not something we just
[1:33:50] study and get excited and say oh
[1:33:52] wonderful no it's an overcoming power we
[1:33:56] are told that the word of God will
[1:33:58] defeat the Devil at any place any time
[1:34:00] under any circumcision
[1:34:02] says if God had anything better to give
[1:34:05] you he would have and he has what was it
[1:34:08] it was the word
[1:34:10] right so therefore whatever situation
[1:34:13] you're going through I don't care
[1:34:15] whether it's children marriage family
[1:34:18] whatever apply the word it's an it's the
[1:34:22] only formula that is guaranteed success
[1:34:27] sit down be honest with one another say
[1:34:30] I've messed up I did this wrong remember
[1:34:33] he says he overcame by the word and
[1:34:36] humility we
[1:34:38] to a place where we can humble ourselves
[1:34:41] and admit when we are wrong
[1:34:45] or not going okay say you know what it
[1:34:47] should have gone this way I'm sorry I
[1:34:50] don't want to go back and I don't want
[1:34:52] to sit here and say I was wrong you were
[1:34:53] right and and get in the fight you know
[1:34:55] what we gotta end this today
[1:34:59] take the word and and remember the
[1:35:02] prophet says this and I'm running just
[1:35:04] to try to get to a close now it's saying
[1:35:06] that it's when Jesus is out that when
[1:35:09] trouble sets in
[1:35:13] when we when the word is no longer the
[1:35:15] center of our relationship when the word
[1:35:19] is no longer what we gather around
[1:35:20] that's when trouble sets in and
[1:35:23] therefore I say to you bring back the
[1:35:25] word
[1:35:26] bring him back into the conversation do
[1:35:29] get to the word the word says humble
[1:35:32] yourself I don't care if it's not your
[1:35:34] fault you just say you know what
[1:35:36] I'm sorry it wasn't supposed to go this
[1:35:39] way I apologize let's find a way to get
[1:35:42] back together let's find a way to solve
[1:35:44] our problems because outside of this
[1:35:47] you are going into a devil's place
[1:35:51] you are you are you are walking in some
[1:35:54] place that is not guaranteed an answer
[1:35:56] that's not guaranteed an overcoming
[1:35:59] Victory outside of this you are
[1:36:03] venturing by yourself
[1:36:06] oh my
[1:36:09] let me go quickly here
[1:36:12] so now he says
[1:36:14] what what here are the comforting words
[1:36:17] of Jesus Christ I have overcome the
[1:36:20] world and if you ever want anything it
[1:36:24] says I have overcome this morning I have
[1:36:26] overcome the world this means it's a he
[1:36:30] is here saying he overcame he is the
[1:36:34] only one who knows how to overcome Satan
[1:36:38] and the world
[1:36:40] good
[1:36:42] what are you looking for
[1:36:46] you go read the doctor so and so on
[1:36:50] find out how to make your relationship
[1:36:52] better
[1:36:53] that's not the answer
[1:36:55] the answer is the word
[1:36:57] what is the word saying that I'm not
[1:37:00] doing
[1:37:02] a teenager I I don't know I'm constantly
[1:37:05] messing up what is the word says that I
[1:37:08] need to go apply so I can overcome the
[1:37:10] testimony we heard this morning I I need
[1:37:13] to overcome I realize I'm living a
[1:37:16] defeated life what do I do I need the
[1:37:19] Holy Ghost and the moment you say the
[1:37:21] Holy Ghost there's a holy ghost in you
[1:37:24] that's seeking for Revelation and that
[1:37:26] comes into place
[1:37:28] say this it's the blue
[1:37:30] for us to get out of this world into the
[1:37:33] Rapture there is no other way
[1:37:36] and and I want to say this because it's
[1:37:39] important the word of God was given to
[1:37:42] us in this generation to bring us back
[1:37:45] into God's original mind original idea
[1:37:50] of what he intended for you to be
[1:37:54] this word was not given so we can go to
[1:37:57] some Churches it's gone by it was given
[1:37:59] to us so we can move out of this world
[1:38:02] and go back into that original condition
[1:38:05] that God intended for you sin brought
[1:38:09] you in this condition but the word is
[1:38:11] here to bring you right back into that
[1:38:13] original condition
[1:38:15] and it's only when we use it
[1:38:18] that's what will bring us into the real
[1:38:20] you say what was it to be like Adam
[1:38:23] he obeyed the word
[1:38:25] he did what the world told him to do
[1:38:28] he named The Animal by the word that was
[1:38:30] inside of him he spoke the word when it
[1:38:33] was time to speak the word and may I not
[1:38:35] go too far in this generation have we
[1:38:37] not seen one come into that condition
[1:38:39] what did he come by by the word
[1:38:44] and humility
[1:38:48] if the musician could come
[1:38:51] we'll continue another time
[1:38:59] oh my
[1:39:01] isn't it wonderful
[1:39:04] overcome Jesus told us how to do it he
[1:39:08] overcome overcoming me overcome means to
[1:39:12] stand the test
[1:39:14] whatever tests the enemy let me say this
[1:39:18] the enemy is here to destroy families
[1:39:23] to wreak havoc to make you ineffective
[1:39:29] and we cannot take a chance
[1:39:32] to try to resolve things by our own mind
[1:39:35] and our own ability
[1:39:37] don't do that
[1:39:38] it will not work
[1:39:40] if it works it's going to work for two
[1:39:42] seconds and you'll find yourself worse
[1:39:44] off than you did before
[1:39:47] it's like holding a lie the longer you
[1:39:49] hold it the worse it gets
[1:39:51] the quicker you tell the truth the
[1:39:53] better it is
[1:39:58] he told us that what is it is it it
[1:40:00] means to stand the test that's right
[1:40:03] like all the like the old Saints like
[1:40:07] Jesus he says it admits in admits of the
[1:40:11] all his enemies he stood the test now he
[1:40:14] says one place that he came forth with a
[1:40:17] dirty name
[1:40:20] he was born with a dirty name
[1:40:23] he said the very birth was questionable
[1:40:26] think about a baby a child having to
[1:40:30] First even overcome the fact that some
[1:40:33] call him a legitimate and all kinds of
[1:40:35] things
[1:40:36] but he said he overcame every stage of
[1:40:39] it what was he doing it for he was doing
[1:40:42] it for you so when he comes at the end
[1:40:44] and he gives you his word that's why the
[1:40:47] fullness of the word we can't play
[1:40:49] around with these things the fullness of
[1:40:51] the word has come to the bride and you
[1:40:54] have to understand outside of that word
[1:40:56] there's no Victory all the victory that
[1:41:00] you ever need of is in that word
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:04] we get excited somebody comes and
[1:41:06] preaches some things that don't make no
[1:41:08] sense and everything everybody gets
[1:41:10] excited all the new doctrines and the
[1:41:12] newness and forget all of that stay with
[1:41:15] the word
[1:41:16] that's the only thing that's guaranteed
[1:41:18] to give you the victory is the message
[1:41:21] of the hour
[1:41:23] not a new doctrine not a new that's why
[1:41:26] I appreciate so much what our pastor
[1:41:29] does here he plays the tape so we know
[1:41:31] what the messenger said so we know what
[1:41:33] the word says so when we preach you know
[1:41:36] whether we are telling you the truth or
[1:41:38] not
[1:41:39] president
[1:41:42] every single one that comes behind the
[1:41:44] smoking we try to stay with what the
[1:41:46] prophet said we don't come here with our
[1:41:48] own mind we try to say what he said why
[1:41:50] because that's a weapon that will
[1:41:52] overcome and let me say this don't don't
[1:41:56] get caught up into excitement about
[1:41:59] other stuff gets excited in the word and
[1:42:02] stay with the word
[1:42:04] however humble it looks however simple
[1:42:07] it looks however whether it sounds dry
[1:42:10] or whatever if it's the word to take it
[1:42:13] [Applause]
[1:42:15] don't fall for somebody coming in and
[1:42:18] preaching and you go wow and everything
[1:42:20] stay with what if the messenger says it
[1:42:23] rejoice in it if it didn't say it stay
[1:42:27] away from it
[1:42:29] like I'm talking about the key to
[1:42:31] overcoming
[1:42:32] so he takes it's like someone writing a
[1:42:35] memoir about everything about their
[1:42:37] lives they come and they said
[1:42:40] I'm here you know I have overcome the
[1:42:42] world you said I do it says okay now
[1:42:45] he says I am come down in Revelation 10
[1:42:48] 7. and I'm coming here and I'm giving to
[1:42:51] my messenger the book The Secret of
[1:42:54] overcoming and I'm sending it to go to
[1:42:56] the bride and give him that book so she
[1:42:59] can eat it
[1:43:01] now remember when he had to when she
[1:43:03] when you add the book there's some
[1:43:05] bitter parts and some sweet so you don't
[1:43:07] have to say oh I'll just take the sweet
[1:43:08] part and no you eat the whole boat
[1:43:12] it will save you it will save your
[1:43:15] family it will deliver you it will solve
[1:43:18] your problems it will fix your marriage
[1:43:21] whatever the situation is
[1:43:24] that book isn't good enough to bring the
[1:43:27] solution to it
[1:43:30] all right I just can't feel I don't know
[1:43:32] where to stop I'm sorry so here it is it
[1:43:35] says to to stand the test and the ride
[1:43:38] of all senses in the midst of it enemy
[1:43:41] he stood the test he says everything he
[1:43:43] was it was tested against his student he
[1:43:46] stood his student this is in the message
[1:43:49] how can I overcome paragraph 103. he
[1:43:52] says
[1:43:53] in the face of sickness and him being
[1:43:57] the Messiah he healed them
[1:43:59] in the face of death he brought it back
[1:44:02] to life in the face of Calvary his own
[1:44:06] death he defeated it by surrendering
[1:44:10] himself
[1:44:14] overcoming is not just standing on top a
[1:44:16] mountain and shouting it
[1:44:21] Lord I don't know what's happening
[1:44:23] my world is upside down right now
[1:44:26] but I'm surrendering myself to you
[1:44:29] because I know in your able hands you
[1:44:32] are able to protect and secure me it
[1:44:35] doesn't matter if death is before me
[1:44:37] whatever is before me I will stand
[1:44:40] against it because I believe that thou
[1:44:42] are with me isn't that what David said
[1:44:46] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:44:49] shadow of death behold thou are there he
[1:44:52] says if I made my bed in hell Behold our
[1:44:55] if I go in the outermost part of the
[1:44:58] earth behold he says such knowledge is
[1:45:00] so wonderful for me I can't even attain
[1:45:03] it what kind of God it is is it is the
[1:45:06] one who's here to protect you
[1:45:08] and his word is our ticket out of him
[1:45:13] his word is the blueprint to overcoming
[1:45:17] his word is the formula for us to live
[1:45:21] in overcoming life let's all stand this
[1:45:23] morning
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:33] isn't it wonderful
[1:45:41] says you welcome the word in your midst
[1:45:46] and he will do what you promise you will
[1:45:48] do
[1:45:49] you want Rapture take the word
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:56] I believe it's not too far-fetched for
[1:45:58] me to say Rapture is already in you
[1:46:00] that's right you should know that
[1:46:03] how is it in You by the word of God
[1:46:09] it's the inspiration that we need the
[1:46:12] Revelation to come and shock us to bring
[1:46:15] that portion of the word to come to life
[1:46:17] in due season
[1:46:20] but we don't have to abandon what we
[1:46:23] know Works to go after things that we
[1:46:26] are that are questionable
[1:46:28] when we have the blueprint
[1:46:31] to the very success of God
[1:46:34] he himself coming he says you take the
[1:46:37] word it's him that you are taking I like
[1:46:40] a quote that brother Kaufman and I have
[1:46:42] talked about a few months ago he sent it
[1:46:45] to me he says that God gave to the
[1:46:48] believer his word which is himself
[1:46:52] he himself coming to dwell in you
[1:46:57] you take him
[1:46:59] and you don't have to worry about
[1:47:01] anything our gracious father how we are
[1:47:03] so thankful this morning
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:08] Lord I know
[1:47:10] we have circumstances and situation that
[1:47:13] we find ourselves in and sometimes we
[1:47:16] don't even know how to get ourselves out
[1:47:19] but Lord we come to you this morning
[1:47:24] we desire that we may bring you back as
[1:47:27] the center of our Lives Lord
[1:47:30] that you'll be the foundation on which
[1:47:32] we are built not our own minds not our
[1:47:36] own thinkings but your word
[1:47:38] we pray this morning that
[1:47:41] father God
[1:47:43] from Young to mature Believers this
[1:47:47] morning may you come by our way Lord and
[1:47:50] add a little bit more measure of
[1:47:52] yourself Lord
[1:47:55] father though you may make us overcome
[1:47:57] us
[1:47:58] by Your Word
[1:48:00] in humility
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] you would say that
[1:48:05] the greatest people I the ones that
[1:48:08] you'll come next to them and they make
[1:48:10] you feel like you are great
[1:48:13] Lord you've given us your word and
[1:48:15] you've made us feel like we are great
[1:48:18] but we're here to Humble ourselves to
[1:48:20] you oh God
[1:48:22] recognizing your greatness in this hour
[1:48:25] to know that it's you that's moving in
[1:48:27] US
[1:48:29] Lord if there be any need this morning
[1:48:33] Lord you said faith in your word will
[1:48:36] produce the good
[1:48:37] may you come and touch the absolute hand
[1:48:40] and the heart that's crying out to you
[1:48:43] the need that's been lifted up before
[1:48:45] you
[1:48:47] Lord God that you may become a reality
[1:48:49] to that person that it may have in a
[1:48:51] true experience like David this morning
[1:48:53] and say that the Lord is my helper
[1:48:57] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:48:59] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:49:02] strength of My Life whom shall I be
[1:49:05] afraid
[1:49:06] when the wicked even my enemy when they
[1:49:08] come upon me they stumble and they fall
[1:49:12] oh Father may you come this morning to
[1:49:15] each and every one Lord that is
[1:49:18] listening to this
[1:49:19] that you make yourself a reality to them
[1:49:22] we love you Lord we commit what we are
[1:49:25] to you we pray now that you send your
[1:49:27] Holy Ghost to come and make this world a
[1:49:30] reality to our hearts we love you and
[1:49:32] ask such things in the name of Jesus
[1:49:34] Christ amen
[1:49:36] let's just sing that is where the cause
[1:49:38] men come
[1:49:39] holy words
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:49] oh

[1:52:37] good morning
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:45] come with Open Hearts oh let the word of
[1:52:49] God impart amen
[1:52:52] brother Billy mentioned this in the
[1:52:53] service this morning and I was moved
[1:52:55] because the overcome the Overcomer
[1:52:58] already overcame
[1:53:02] and now he's in you
[1:53:04] so you can overcome by the same power
[1:53:07] that already overcame
[1:53:10] all you have to do
[1:53:13] is stick with the word and the word will
[1:53:16] tell you the next step you're walking
[1:53:18] into and that's the overcoming power
[1:53:22] we're only Reapers of what was already
[1:53:25] sowed
[1:53:27] so if the word of God is a seed
[1:53:29] we're not Reapers of that very word that
[1:53:32] came in our generation
[1:53:34] and now when we become that Revelation
[1:53:36] at word
[1:53:38] we now saw
[1:53:40] because it's not you that speaketh but
[1:53:43] it's Christ that lives inside of you
[1:53:46] what a privilege Saints it's not
[1:53:49] something we take for granted but it's
[1:53:52] something you love with humility with
[1:53:55] with the humbleness just knowing God
[1:53:57] desires
[1:53:58] to use you and to live inside of you
[1:54:04] amen that makes me happy
[1:54:07] that makes me want to just shout and
[1:54:10] praise the Lord because that's who we
[1:54:13] are that's our identity
[1:54:16] and not because of something that the
[1:54:18] world gave you but it's something that
[1:54:21] came from eternity that was already in
[1:54:23] you you're just now being made aware of
[1:54:25] it
[1:54:28] amen what a service
[1:54:31] what a word
[1:54:33] let it become flesh now
[1:54:35] I wanted to sing this song
[1:54:38] I'll Praise You In The Storm
[1:54:41] and you know we praise them in the storm
[1:54:44] because we love him for what he's doing
[1:54:46] for us every day
[1:54:48] we got to be mindful of the little
[1:54:50] things this takes care of your Saints
[1:54:52] your daily bread
[1:54:55] you know the things that we have
[1:54:57] sometimes you know
[1:54:59] we take it for granted but he's always
[1:55:01] there for you if you're there for him
[1:55:05] because he wants to have this fellowship
[1:55:07] with you
[1:55:09] I would say it this way if you need
[1:55:11] prayer this morning I know the the
[1:55:12] Lord's here this morning
[1:55:14] because his word came forth and it was
[1:55:17] the truth
[1:55:18] and if you desire something on your
[1:55:21] heart this morning ask for prayer
[1:55:24] and know that it's your faith that will
[1:55:27] touch you
[1:55:28] because it's already in you let's just
