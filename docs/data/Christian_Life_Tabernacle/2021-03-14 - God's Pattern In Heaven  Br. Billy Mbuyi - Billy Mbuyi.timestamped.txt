[29:59] hallelujah hey man we'll just
[30:02] ask the musicians to play something
[30:04] softly as we just
[30:05] use this opportunity to open our service
[30:07] in prayer
[30:09] take up the ties and offerings we just
[30:12] have some needs we want to read we'll
[30:14] just ask brother clever if
[30:16] he'll come and take the needs and then
[30:18] also he has a song special we'd like to
[30:21] ask him to sing for us but
[30:24] my sister sharon she just
[30:28] asked the church to be in prayer an
[30:30] urgent need came for her co-worker
[30:32] her co-worker's name is ashton he was
[30:34] working on a vehicle and it fell
[30:36] on them and they have no hope
[30:39] they're they're in the hospital and
[30:41] feeling that the doctors are just
[30:43] feeling there's no chance but
[30:45] sister sharon said i know with if god's
[30:48] people are praying for him then there's
[30:49] a chance
[30:51] and so we just want to plead that god
[30:54] can
[30:55] use this opportunity just to show them
[30:58] their grace and
[30:59] pray that sister sharon could be a light
[31:02] to them
[31:03] during this time so let's just remember
[31:06] them in prayer
[31:08] just also the other needs that
[31:12] that's been mentioned we're so grateful
[31:14] for the wonderful testimonies that we've
[31:16] been hearing
[31:16] sister melinda and brother kyle and
[31:20] a little celine just should it increase
[31:22] our faith amen

[31:52] burned really bad on his hands and so

[44:20] lord bless you um while they get ready i
[44:23] wanted to thank the lord um
[44:25] last wednesday um we stopped by the
[44:27] store real quick after
[44:29] church and i thought you know the boys
[44:31] didn't want to stop and they were tired
[44:33] and hungry
[44:34] and i said you know it was late so i
[44:36] picked up a bag of chips
[44:37] and i said that'll keep them busy in the
[44:39] car
[44:40] and when we were home my husband and i
[44:43] were trying to get them to brush their
[44:44] teeth and you know how
[44:46] get ready for bed take showers and i had
[44:49] esther on the counter
[44:50] and we were both right there and so he
[44:53] reaches over for a chip
[44:55] and i thought we're right here you know
[44:57] he's just gonna lick the dust off of it
[44:59] or whatever
[45:00] so i let him have a dorito which i know
[45:03] you know
[45:04] i wouldn't normally do such a thing but
[45:06] it was so late we were tired trying to
[45:08] get the other kids in bed
[45:10] and we were right there with him well i
[45:12] don't know how he got distracted
[45:14] he ends up i guess choking on it
[45:18] and we had grapes on the counter so i
[45:20] didn't know did he grab a grape i don't
[45:22] think he did
[45:23] but at this point it didn't matter i had
[45:25] to grab him i sat on my lap and i was
[45:27] trying to you know as a nurse you try to
[45:29] stay calm
[45:30] and that was the one thing they drilled
[45:32] you got to stay calm no matter whether
[45:34] it's bleeding or broken bones or
[45:36] but when it's breathing and they can't
[45:39] breathe and they're turning colors
[45:42] my husband i don't think he understood
[45:43] the severity of it he was
[45:45] you know putting dishes in the sink and
[45:47] by then i was praying inside i said lord
[45:51] he started gasping for air and i
[45:53] realized
[45:55] okay something needs to happen now i
[45:58] mean there's no calling 9-1-1
[46:00] when the baby's blue i mean you are
[46:03] 9-1-1 there
[46:04] and i said lord you're the only one who
[46:07] can help me now
[46:09] i you know i was beating his back i had
[46:12] flipped him over
[46:13] and by then i was ready to do the adult
[46:15] you know trying to get that out of him
[46:18] and he starts throwing up all the food
[46:20] that he had eaten but he still couldn't
[46:22] get that out of his
[46:23] you know where he was breathing he
[46:26] couldn't breathe
[46:28] and finally you know i think it was the
[46:30] second time that i
[46:32] beat him really hard and i said lord
[46:35] i need you to do something if you don't
[46:37] do anything
[46:38] this is it he's he can't breathe
[46:41] and the lord somehow that came out of
[46:44] his throat and
[46:45] i didn't still didn't know if it was a
[46:47] grape that he grabbed or if it was
[46:49] the chip but he took a deep breath and
[46:52] the color started to come back and i
[46:54] just wanted to thank the lord because
[46:57] you take these little things for granted
[46:59] and you don't you know
[47:00] my husband didn't realize it was so
[47:02] serious and he says well
[47:04] i didn't think he was really choking
[47:07] and so he had moved on and i was just
[47:10] praying
[47:11] um but you know i know you just i can't
[47:15] you know when you get excited and you
[47:17] can't think and you can't
[47:18] you know do anything for them so i try
[47:20] to stay calm but i just want to thank
[47:22] the lord for that and
[47:23] i was just reminded of that and i said
[47:25] lord i just got to give you glory for
[47:31] [Music]
[47:36] that
[47:45] sometimes in this life
[47:49] we might get discouraged

[47:56] just
[47:56] barely hanging on

[56:31] created the heavens
[56:32] and the earth the heaven and the earth
[56:34] and the earth was without form
[56:36] and void and darkness was upon the face
[56:39] of the deep and the spirit of god
[56:41] moved upon the face of the waters
[56:45] oh just uh let's keep and and and read
[56:48] uh genesis chapter 1 and 26
[56:52] it speaks about the creation of man and

[58:07] speaking unto the children of israel
[58:09] that they bring

[59:05] midst and it says according

[1:01:25] look to that look to that thou make them
[1:01:29] after their pattern which i have shown
[1:01:32] thee
[1:01:33] in the mount now you just want to spend
[1:01:36] a few moments
[1:01:39] try not to be too long just maybe a
[1:01:41] couple of minutes
[1:01:44] just something that struck me even as
[1:01:46] our pastor
[1:01:48] just the things that he's been preaching
[1:01:50] i want to speak
[1:01:51] on uh
[1:01:54] on god's pattern in heaven
[1:01:58] god's pattern in heaven certainly
[1:02:02] enjoy the word this morning and i think
[1:02:06] it's it's a very uh
[1:02:09] telling it's very telling and very
[1:02:12] important that we we we come into the
[1:02:16] word
[1:02:16] that's been revealed to us because it's
[1:02:19] the coming
[1:02:20] into it that brings the very
[1:02:21] manifestation of what we
[1:02:23] are supposed to be seeing um i and
[1:02:27] and i've been encouraged so much with
[1:02:29] even the very testimonies that people
[1:02:32] have given
[1:02:33] i i believe the the we we
[1:02:36] have heard the message long enough and
[1:02:39] we continue to hear it we walk in the
[1:02:41] word long enough we
[1:02:42] and we continue to walk in it but it
[1:02:45] comes a time where that word has to
[1:02:46] become a reality
[1:02:48] there comes a time where that word has
[1:02:50] to take on flesh and walk
[1:02:52] and act and and i could say this even in
[1:02:55] light of what we
[1:02:57] we expect or what we call as the
[1:02:58] manifestation of the third pool
[1:03:01] it's encouraging to see the signs of it
[1:03:04] because we are being told that it's
[1:03:06] going to come a time where we can't buy
[1:03:07] or sell
[1:03:08] there's going to come a time where
[1:03:10] they're going to lock down churches and
[1:03:11] if we're still here
[1:03:12] we have to have something that can work
[1:03:15] we have to have something that we will
[1:03:17] hear the word of god
[1:03:18] it would move upon us and we'll speak
[1:03:20] the word and i'm so encouraged because
[1:03:22] when you look at all of these testimony
[1:03:24] that have been given
[1:03:25] there's almost a common characteristics
[1:03:28] and that's when you speak the word
[1:03:30] when you ask why don't you pray why
[1:03:32] don't you ask
[1:03:33] why don't you tell him why don't you do
[1:03:35] this so it's move upon it's not just a
[1:03:37] believer sitting there
[1:03:39] and waiting oh god if you can oh god if
[1:03:41] you could just know
[1:03:42] it's actually come down to the
[1:03:44] manifestation of this
[1:03:46] hour which is that i have been empowered
[1:03:49] to do this
[1:03:50] i have been given power i have been
[1:03:52] chosen
[1:03:53] and called for this purpose that i can
[1:03:55] speak the word and god will move upon it
[1:03:58] god is the relationship has changed it's
[1:04:01] no longer god in heaven we live in a
[1:04:03] time where
[1:04:04] the god of creation who created all
[1:04:06] things who came and
[1:04:08] dwelt in his son the scripture says we
[1:04:10] live in a time where god is in his
[1:04:12] people
[1:04:14] when you want to see god you see his
[1:04:16] people it's no longer just something we
[1:04:18] can dream of but we see it when we hear
[1:04:20] those testimony
[1:04:22] we see god and we are encouraged by it
[1:04:25] so as we read the scripture here we see
[1:04:28] uh
[1:04:29] god's pattern in heaven we can look at
[1:04:32] it and i just hope it can connect with
[1:04:34] what was preached in the morning because
[1:04:35] it's very important we come to realize
[1:04:37] that we are we are carrying something
[1:04:41] we are not left at our own devices this
[1:04:43] is part of the master plan
[1:04:45] that a believer will carry out the word
[1:04:48] of god
[1:04:48] and god will come and vandicate that
[1:04:50] believer for the faith that they have
[1:04:52] shown
[1:04:52] in carrying out the word so it speaks
[1:04:55] here as we read in genesis it says
[1:04:57] the spirit of god moved upon the face of
[1:05:00] the earth we could look
[1:05:01] and and and we can see uh we know the
[1:05:04] scriptures very well we see
[1:05:06] that god came and he moved and he began
[1:05:08] to create
[1:05:09] things and and he came and we are told
[1:05:12] that
[1:05:12] god came and he said let her be now i i
[1:05:15] just want to stop there for a moment
[1:05:17] when he says let
[1:05:18] her be we know that barbara speaks about
[1:05:20] how that the word went forth and it took
[1:05:22] millions of years and
[1:05:24] and he brought forth what god was
[1:05:25] speaking about and our pastor touched
[1:05:28] this morning and said that
[1:05:29] uh uh uh that god brings his word
[1:05:32] by interpretation in other words when we
[1:05:35] see the interpretation then we
[1:05:36] understand what was spoken
[1:05:38] when the prophecy is given we have no
[1:05:40] idea when he says this is going to
[1:05:42] happen
[1:05:43] uh anybody any man can say whatever they
[1:05:45] want
[1:05:46] but when we see the manifestation of it
[1:05:48] that becomes the interpretation of what
[1:05:51] was spoken
[1:05:52] so when god said let her be now i just
[1:05:54] want to
[1:05:55] move you back just for a little bit let
[1:05:57] her be
[1:05:58] and then we know that when god said it
[1:06:00] something went out of him
[1:06:02] and he created what god wanted now but i
[1:06:05] want you to think about before the word
[1:06:07] was very spoken the very word was spoken
[1:06:10] letter b
[1:06:11] because when it's spoken it's spoken
[1:06:13] with an intention
[1:06:15] it's spoken with a specific motive and
[1:06:17] objective
[1:06:18] it's spoken and it's waiting for
[1:06:20] something specific to come out
[1:06:22] so before this god was sitting there
[1:06:25] with all his thoughts
[1:06:26] and he was sitting there with all his
[1:06:28] mind and i thought
[1:06:29] it's so we don't even have the
[1:06:32] vocabulary to begin to explain this i
[1:06:34] just
[1:06:34] thought about it for a moment i was lost
[1:06:36] even myself
[1:06:38] to just think about okay we say well
[1:06:40] this was in god's mind
[1:06:42] and oftentimes when we think mind we
[1:06:45] think our own mind
[1:06:46] where things come in and go out as quick
[1:06:48] as they come in and
[1:06:49] we walk up we're going to go do
[1:06:51] something we forget what we're about to
[1:06:52] do we got to go back and
[1:06:54] and by the time we get back we remember
[1:06:56] what we wanted to do
[1:06:57] so it's not even equal to what we would
[1:06:59] construct within our own mindset
[1:07:01] that in the mind of god but if i could
[1:07:04] just
[1:07:04] uh for a moment and say we you take a a
[1:07:08] brandon comes and he preached christ
[1:07:10] the mystery of god revealed and he began
[1:07:12] to tell us what actually when we say the
[1:07:15] mind of god what do we mean
[1:07:17] when we say the mind of god it says that
[1:07:19] god had threefold purposes
[1:07:22] in other words when we speak we say the
[1:07:24] mind of god
[1:07:25] we are looking at the fault purposes of
[1:07:27] god
[1:07:28] from the beginning the mission and what
[1:07:30] he was trying to achieve
[1:07:32] so when he said let her be you look in
[1:07:34] the threefold purposes
[1:07:36] what exactly did he want to do it says
[1:07:38] he wanted to know his people and he
[1:07:40] wanted to have dominion
[1:07:42] and he wanted to be one with him and he
[1:07:43] wanted to restore his kingdom
[1:07:45] so here he is at the very beginning he's
[1:07:47] speaking of his kingdom
[1:07:49] when he says let her be it was the
[1:07:52] heavens
[1:07:53] manifesting himself on earth
[1:07:56] when i say the heavens i don't want you
[1:07:58] to look at the sky
[1:08:00] i want you to think about this mind of
[1:08:02] god this god who created everything
[1:08:05] this god who had no one knew everything
[1:08:07] what was in his mind
[1:08:08] there was not even an expression or
[1:08:10] anything but then he said let there be
[1:08:13] out of this heaven of god something is
[1:08:16] being expressed on earth
[1:08:18] and and that prophet tells us that the
[1:08:20] earth is supposed to be
[1:08:22] or is created to be an image of what
[1:08:25] came from heaven
[1:08:26] so when he say letter b is modifying the
[1:08:29] things that we see and
[1:08:31] he's taking and breaking up the seas and
[1:08:33] he's doing this
[1:08:34] is taking what is in the heaven and
[1:08:36] manifesting it on a certain earth
[1:08:39] he's taken and he's doing all of that so
[1:08:42] we we see that so
[1:08:43] we can say the earth and the creation
[1:08:46] began to be made
[1:08:47] to match what was in god's mind
[1:08:52] and so everything now is being created
[1:08:55] to come back and match
[1:08:56] what god was speaking everything is
[1:08:58] being formed
[1:09:00] into the matching of what came from this
[1:09:02] heaven of god
[1:09:03] that he was speaking of so we find out
[1:09:06] we we that he began to speak and we find
[1:09:10] out that
[1:09:10] uh the mind of god and how he comes and
[1:09:14] and he explains it himself and we then
[1:09:16] began to look within our mind
[1:09:18] the scripture tells us that the lamb was
[1:09:21] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:09:24] so within this mind all of this has
[1:09:27] already taken place
[1:09:29] and yet on earth nothing has happened
[1:09:31] yet
[1:09:32] within this mind all of this planning
[1:09:34] has already taken earth
[1:09:35] and when the word is going forth the
[1:09:38] word is carrying out this mind
[1:09:40] that has already completed everything so
[1:09:43] that when it comes out
[1:09:44] it's perfectly no wonder when it came
[1:09:46] out god said this is good
[1:09:49] no wonder why when he spoke it came out
[1:09:51] it says this is good
[1:09:52] when it came out it says this is good
[1:09:55] why because it was the representation
[1:09:58] of what was in heaven is being seen on
[1:10:01] earth
[1:10:02] oh i tell you we serve almighty god
[1:10:04] that's why we don't have to worry
[1:10:06] tonight
[1:10:07] we're just like we heard it this morning
[1:10:09] if we have
[1:10:10] the message within our heart if we have
[1:10:13] this message if we are carriers of this
[1:10:15] seed if we are carriers of the package
[1:10:18] if we are carriers of the revelation of
[1:10:20] the end time
[1:10:21] that is going to manifest why because
[1:10:24] it's the mind
[1:10:25] it's a heaven being manifested on earth
[1:10:30] so now when i s when i'm speaking about
[1:10:33] uh
[1:10:33] uh uh a pattern i want us to have this
[1:10:37] in mind
[1:10:38] it's when you speak about pattern it
[1:10:40] speaks about a construct of something
[1:10:42] how something is built it's a it's a
[1:10:44] design
[1:10:45] it's a model and i can say this
[1:10:48] everything has a pattern
[1:10:50] you just have to see it everything has a
[1:10:53] pattern
[1:10:53] you know we could talk about building
[1:10:55] and how to build this and everything
[1:10:57] and and those that are in construction
[1:10:59] they can look at it
[1:11:00] and see the skeleton and know what wood
[1:11:03] and what type of wood will go where and
[1:11:05] how you would lay the foundation and how
[1:11:07] long
[1:11:08] and how the mixture of everything has to
[1:11:11] be exactly and all of that
[1:11:13] why because they have the pattern within
[1:11:15] the head
[1:11:16] you know we can speak about uh uh uh uh
[1:11:19] uh we can speak about computers those
[1:11:21] that are in computers can look at it
[1:11:23] and they can see you just have to say a
[1:11:26] few words they can put it together
[1:11:28] they understand how everything is built
[1:11:30] and all of those things
[1:11:31] so as we speak about this pattern we're
[1:11:33] seeing how that god is taking
[1:11:36] heaven and is bringing it down to
[1:11:38] manifest it on earth
[1:11:40] how because when we can identify the
[1:11:42] pattern then we can see god
[1:11:44] how it's moving but random calls himself
[1:11:47] a typologist
[1:11:49] why because he was able to go into the
[1:11:51] bible
[1:11:52] and identify the pattern by which god
[1:11:55] did things
[1:11:56] he was able to go and look at the type
[1:11:58] and look at one type and look at another
[1:12:00] and look at another
[1:12:01] and be able to determine that if god did
[1:12:04] this over here
[1:12:05] if he repeated it over here that same
[1:12:07] god if he comes back to do anything
[1:12:10] it cannot contradict the others because
[1:12:12] the scriptures cannot be broken
[1:12:22] so we see within this mind there was the
[1:12:25] perfect plan of god
[1:12:27] the perfect plan of redemption and how
[1:12:29] the god wanted to
[1:12:31] everything to play out and then it says
[1:12:33] as we read the scripture it says
[1:12:35] let us make man in our image
[1:12:39] now we we understand that god as we read
[1:12:42] in genesis chapter 1
[1:12:44] that he was let us make man in our image
[1:12:47] it was a spirit
[1:12:48] god is a spirit so he came and he made
[1:12:51] man
[1:12:51] and the man that he made was a spirit
[1:12:53] man
[1:12:54] but the the very focus that he made the
[1:12:57] man of the reason
[1:12:58] he said as we read in genesis was for
[1:13:00] him to have dominion
[1:13:02] what they have to rule over the earth
[1:13:04] was for him to take
[1:13:05] uh uh uh the earth and subdue it and
[1:13:08] and make it work according to his will
[1:13:11] and and and and be
[1:13:12] the god on earth be the manifestation of
[1:13:15] heaven
[1:13:16] on earth so the pattern of god is in
[1:13:20] heaven
[1:13:21] but it's it's reflected to reflect this
[1:13:24] this mind of his and all that he has
[1:13:26] done he wanted it
[1:13:28] displayed and reflected back back on
[1:13:30] earth so the purpose of making man
[1:13:32] was so he can do exactly what he did in
[1:13:35] heaven so he can do it on earth
[1:13:38] he wanted a perfect manifestation of who
[1:13:40] he was into earth
[1:13:42] and then we find out that men fall from
[1:13:44] that and so the scripture
[1:13:47] says that how it becomes very important
[1:13:50] that we see
[1:13:51] that the earth is to be made in the
[1:13:54] pattern of heaven
[1:13:57] in matthew 6 and 9 the scripture says
[1:14:00] jesus came and and the disciples came in
[1:14:03] and they came to him and he says that
[1:14:06] teach us how to pray
[1:14:08] just after what manner we should pray he
[1:14:10] says
[1:14:11] in verse 9 it says and in this manner
[1:14:13] they
[1:14:14] therefore ye pray said our father which
[1:14:17] are in heaven
[1:14:18] hallowed be thy name that kingdom comes
[1:14:22] and that will be done in earth as it is
[1:14:25] in heaven so everything was
[1:14:28] was with the purpose of of manifesting
[1:14:31] in this earth what was in heaven
[1:14:33] what's the the purpose that that that
[1:14:36] what when we look at the earth that we
[1:14:38] should be able to pick up
[1:14:40] what is it that's happening in heaven
[1:14:42] because god didn't do anything on earth
[1:14:44] unless he done it in heaven first
[1:14:46] so he says that will be done as
[1:14:49] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:14:52] day our daily bread
[1:14:54] and forgive us our debt and so as we
[1:14:56] forgive
[1:14:57] our debtors let us not uh lead us not
[1:15:00] into temptation but deliver us from evil
[1:15:03] from that is the kingdom and the power
[1:15:05] and the glory
[1:15:06] uh forever amen and then it says in
[1:15:10] 14 it says for for if ye forgive
[1:15:13] forgive men they trespasses your
[1:15:16] heavenly father will also forgive you
[1:15:19] but if you forgive not man for the
[1:15:22] trespasses
[1:15:23] therefore you will therefore therefore
[1:15:26] neither
[1:15:27] will your father forgive you their
[1:15:28] trespasses you know so here he is
[1:15:31] showing once again that god's will in
[1:15:33] heaven
[1:15:34] the desire was for that will to be
[1:15:36] manifested on earth
[1:15:38] the the and i'll say this the purpose of
[1:15:40] the revealing
[1:15:41] of the word of the hour as our pastor
[1:15:44] touched this morning today the scripture
[1:15:46] is fulfilled
[1:15:47] the purpose of that revealing of that
[1:15:50] message
[1:15:51] is not just to come so we can come to a
[1:15:54] place and say
[1:15:55] we have the holy ghost and we are happy
[1:15:57] about it but the purpose was to bring us
[1:16:00] right back into the beginning so we can
[1:16:02] get back in the same condition that adam
[1:16:05] was in the beginning
[1:16:06] the purpose was that this message was a
[1:16:09] restoration message
[1:16:10] that was to restore back the condition
[1:16:14] and to restore because remember what
[1:16:15] random says the the
[1:16:17] nature didn't fail the animal didn't
[1:16:20] fail
[1:16:21] none of them fell the only person that
[1:16:24] committed sin and felt was man
[1:16:27] and so the word that was coming and then
[1:16:29] we with him falling
[1:16:31] everything came into chaos everything
[1:16:34] came into chaos because men fell
[1:16:36] but the purpose of the message was so
[1:16:38] that god
[1:16:39] can come and reveal not just to reveal
[1:16:41] us pentecost because
[1:16:43] we have to be birthed as our pastor said
[1:16:45] we have to be birthed back into that
[1:16:47] kingdom
[1:16:48] we have to be now we are here looking
[1:16:51] back at the pattern that was back on
[1:16:53] heaven
[1:16:55] yeah yeah we are now sitting here today
[1:16:58] we it's not
[1:16:59] it's no longer as looking from the
[1:17:02] vantage of god sitting there
[1:17:04] and trying to reveal his mind but we
[1:17:06] have been given access to the word
[1:17:09] that shows us what the pattern was right
[1:17:11] back from the beginning
[1:17:12] so it comes it's to restore that man
[1:17:15] back into the condition
[1:17:17] where he can have dominion over the fish
[1:17:19] of the earth and where he can have
[1:17:21] dominion over
[1:17:22] over the animal over everything come
[1:17:24] back into the image of what god created
[1:17:26] him to be
[1:17:28] so bring us into the condition where the
[1:17:31] supernatural is happening in our lives
[1:17:33] bring us into a place where we can hear
[1:17:35] testimonies like we heard we're hearing
[1:17:37] today
[1:17:38] where god is constantly manifesting
[1:17:41] himself
[1:17:42] i tell you that's the purpose of god
[1:17:44] from the beginning
[1:17:45] who's this melchizedek god's intention
[1:17:48] was to dwell within a flesh with
[1:17:51] with his being he wanted to talk like
[1:17:54] you talking he wanted to hear like
[1:17:56] you're hearing
[1:17:57] he wanted to be one with his people he
[1:18:00] wanted to come and
[1:18:01] and and and and once again not just in
[1:18:04] creation from the beginning where he
[1:18:06] cast down devils
[1:18:08] not just from jesus christ where he died
[1:18:10] and defeated the enemy
[1:18:12] no from the very man that the devil
[1:18:14] caused to fall
[1:18:16] that god will come and dwell within the
[1:18:18] fallen flesh
[1:18:19] it will come and redeem it and bring it
[1:18:22] right back into a place where the same
[1:18:24] flesh
[1:18:24] will do the same oneness that he did
[1:18:26] when he was in the garden of eden
[1:18:29] that's the vantage point that we are
[1:18:31] looking this from and we can see the
[1:18:33] pattern in the world we can see the life
[1:18:35] of our prophet and see
[1:18:36] we see that pattern
[1:18:41] so now he comes and it says we see how
[1:18:45] this pattern has to be manifested it
[1:18:48] shows us
[1:18:49] and he tells as we read about moses now
[1:18:52] he tells moses he says
[1:18:54] now he gives him all the measurements
[1:18:56] and he says now i want you to go back
[1:18:58] up there and he says i want you to build
[1:19:01] this tabernacle
[1:19:03] this dwelling place of god where i can
[1:19:06] come down and dwell with you
[1:19:08] i want you to build it according to the
[1:19:09] specification
[1:19:11] god gave this specification god gave the
[1:19:15] measurements
[1:19:16] god gave how it should look god gave
[1:19:18] everything
[1:19:19] and moses took all this in traction and
[1:19:22] went and built it
[1:19:23] and god came and dwell in it oh i was so
[1:19:26] thankful for the message of the hour
[1:19:28] god has given us all the instructions
[1:19:31] it's giving us all the measurements
[1:19:33] it's told us about the new city that
[1:19:35] we're gonna go dwell in
[1:19:36] he's told us about the statue of the
[1:19:38] perfect man
[1:19:39] it's giving us the mystery about
[1:19:41] adoption he's giving us all those things
[1:19:44] why so we can just take it and follow it
[1:19:46] why because that's the pattern that will
[1:19:48] take us right back into where we came
[1:19:50] from
[1:19:52] it will take us right back that why it's
[1:19:54] the pattern of god
[1:19:56] if ever god ever done one thing one way
[1:19:59] he cannot change it
[1:20:00] he's obligated to do it the same way and
[1:20:04] and he sent a prophet messenger to come
[1:20:06] not just to preach the message or we can
[1:20:09] hear it
[1:20:09] he came and he demonstrated what he
[1:20:12] preached
[1:20:13] god took a man and he brought him right
[1:20:15] back into eternity
[1:20:17] manifesting the same thing that adam did
[1:20:20] so we can know that when we believe the
[1:20:22] same way he'll produce the same thing
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:29] so he comes and he gives them he says
[1:20:31] this these are the specs that i want you
[1:20:33] to follow
[1:20:34] i want you to build it according to this
[1:20:36] and i want you to follow this
[1:20:38] i want you to follow all this
[1:20:39] measurements and everything and it will
[1:20:41] produce
[1:20:42] it will produce the good so the children
[1:20:44] of god
[1:20:45] we said we we we are being given a
[1:20:48] pattern by which we can walk by
[1:20:50] the scripture says in first peter
[1:20:52] chapter 2 and verse 9
[1:20:54] it says ye also a lovely stone
[1:21:01] he says ye are built up
[1:21:05] a spiritual house of the holy priesthood
[1:21:09] he says to offer up sacrifice spiritual
[1:21:12] sacrifice is acceptable by
[1:21:14] to god by jesus christ wherefore also
[1:21:18] it is con it is contained in the
[1:21:20] scripture
[1:21:21] behold alain zion achieved cornerstone
[1:21:25] it says elect says precious
[1:21:29] and he that is that believeth on him
[1:21:32] shall not be
[1:21:33] confounded unto you therefore which are
[1:21:36] also
[1:21:37] which also believed he is a precious but
[1:21:40] unto them
[1:21:42] which are disobedient to the stone which
[1:21:45] the builder
[1:21:46] disallow the same is made the head
[1:21:49] corner the head of the corner it says
[1:21:52] and the stone
[1:21:54] it says in the stone of its stumbling
[1:21:57] and the rock of offense
[1:21:59] even to them which stumble at them
[1:22:02] and them words being disobedient
[1:22:05] were unto also where they were appointed
[1:22:09] it says
[1:22:10] but ye are a chosen generation
[1:22:14] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:22:17] a peculiar people that he should show
[1:22:20] forth the praises of him
[1:22:23] that has called you out of darkness into
[1:22:25] a marvelous light
[1:22:26] here he is giving a description of what
[1:22:30] is it the pattern that we need to be
[1:22:31] walking into
[1:22:33] you are a chosen people you are people
[1:22:36] that have been selected
[1:22:38] oh i tell you you know but imagine he
[1:22:39] was preaching the other day
[1:22:41] people want to do away with the prophet
[1:22:43] that's the devil right there
[1:22:45] because he knows a prophet is a pattern
[1:22:47] of god
[1:22:48] since the beginning the scripture says
[1:22:51] in amos that god will do nothing unless
[1:22:53] he reveals his secret
[1:22:55] to the prophet you do away with the
[1:22:57] prophet you don't have the word
[1:23:00] you don't have the word and i want to
[1:23:02] even say this
[1:23:03] it was men that chosen say to god we
[1:23:06] don't want you to speak we want you to
[1:23:08] pick a man
[1:23:09] that you could speak us to us through
[1:23:12] and god has kept the pattern from the
[1:23:14] beginning
[1:23:15] god speaks to one man that one man
[1:23:17] speaks to a generation
[1:23:19] and if you do away with that one man you
[1:23:21] don't have the word
[1:23:24] that's the pattern of god we're not
[1:23:26] going back in some half
[1:23:28] truth or some madman understanding on
[1:23:31] all of that
[1:23:31] we're going back with the blueprint
[1:23:34] we're going back with the pattern that
[1:23:35] has been established from the beginning
[1:23:37] a word of god by which we can walk by
[1:23:40] talk by
[1:23:41] live by why it produces the same thing
[1:23:44] that it produced from the beginning
[1:23:46] it has never changed
[1:23:51] that's the pattern of god you know and i
[1:23:54] wonder today
[1:23:55] what a man people wants to build their
[1:23:57] own way
[1:23:59] people that want to do away with
[1:24:00] everything you know man wants i wonder
[1:24:03] what pattern
[1:24:04] are we walking by every day when we walk
[1:24:06] up in the morning
[1:24:07] what pattern are we putting in our mind
[1:24:09] and we think oh if i work hard i'll make
[1:24:12] more money that's a
[1:24:13] trick of the devil oh if i do this i'll
[1:24:16] get this no
[1:24:17] you're not made to prosper by the
[1:24:19] economy of the world
[1:24:20] you are meant to prosper by the economy
[1:24:23] of the above
[1:24:24] follow the pattern
[1:24:27] follow the pattern you know and i'll
[1:24:29] just say this this has been on my mind
[1:24:31] for quite some time
[1:24:33] you know oftentimes we speak about even
[1:24:35] you know sisters and how they dress
[1:24:37] and all of those things and rightfully
[1:24:39] so because that's the word
[1:24:40] we gotta keep in line and make sure that
[1:24:42] because we are a people from that
[1:24:44] kingdom
[1:24:45] we are here to reflect back that kingdom
[1:24:48] and therefore we have to follow the
[1:24:50] pattern that has been given for us from
[1:24:52] above
[1:24:53] the world was not made to be in its own
[1:24:55] image
[1:24:56] it was meant to be a reflection of what
[1:24:58] came down from heaven
[1:25:00] into earth and i'll say this
[1:25:03] i see so many times even on young people
[1:25:06] you know there's this this pence that
[1:25:08] just
[1:25:09] seems to be a little too tight and and
[1:25:11] coming up and the socks are showing and
[1:25:14] and the suit looks like they bothered
[1:25:16] the young the the
[1:25:17] the the little one's jacket like i'm
[1:25:20] wearing my son's jacket or something
[1:25:22] and it's up here it seems like it can't
[1:25:24] close and the shoes looks to be like you
[1:25:26] can put two feet in it
[1:25:27] that's something that that's not the
[1:25:29] pattern of heaven
[1:25:33] that's not the pattern we have received
[1:25:35] there's a different pattern of modesty
[1:25:38] that we have received by the word of god
[1:25:40] and that's what we need to walk by
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:46] i'll say this that why is the pattern so
[1:25:50] important
[1:25:51] the scripture speaks about job it says
[1:25:53] that he looked
[1:25:55] he came to a place and the scriptures
[1:25:57] speak about how that things had come
[1:25:59] upon him
[1:26:00] and he looked at the he says in john 38
[1:26:03] and one and
[1:26:04] and and so he began to think about
[1:26:07] everything that was
[1:26:08] happening god came and the his callow
[1:26:11] was taking his children and all the
[1:26:13] things
[1:26:13] that he owed was being taken it he
[1:26:16] couldn't understand
[1:26:17] it and and the job began to pray and he
[1:26:19] began to
[1:26:20] intercede and and the scripture but it
[1:26:22] speaks about how
[1:26:23] he looked at nature he was able to see
[1:26:26] the pattern
[1:26:28] he was able to see something he says
[1:26:30] well when i look at the flower it says
[1:26:33] the life comes up and it comes all the
[1:26:36] way up it produces a flower it dies
[1:26:38] now not that the life dies the fly
[1:26:41] the life gets out of the flower
[1:26:44] the flower itself is just recovering it
[1:26:48] falls that life goes back right back
[1:26:50] into the root
[1:26:51] when the season comes again that same
[1:26:53] life comes back
[1:26:54] up into a leaf again and creates another
[1:26:57] one
[1:26:58] oh i tell you that's why the prophet
[1:27:00] tells us even the bible tells us
[1:27:02] a believer does not die there's no way
[1:27:04] you can die
[1:27:06] why because in heaven you'll be the same
[1:27:08] life
[1:27:09] the same life that's speaking to you
[1:27:11] tonight it'll be the same life that
[1:27:13] you're sitting with here
[1:27:14] it just be a different flesh why because
[1:27:17] this flesh
[1:27:18] is a corruptable it cannot make it to
[1:27:20] the other side
[1:27:21] in fact paul said that if this body be
[1:27:23] dissolved
[1:27:24] there's already another one
[1:27:26] [Applause]
[1:27:27] as part of the pattern of god that's
[1:27:30] waiting for you to receive that soul
[1:27:32] back into it amen
[1:27:35] so he looked and he sees the the pattern
[1:27:37] in everything he sees the pattern
[1:27:39] in everything around him so now he asks
[1:27:42] this question
[1:27:43] what becomes of man
[1:27:48] when men dies then what will become of
[1:27:50] him
[1:27:51] he says i see the pattern everywhere but
[1:27:54] i don't see anything for man
[1:27:56] you see at that time it was seemed like
[1:27:58] it was hidden he couldn't see the
[1:28:00] pattern
[1:28:01] but oh as we began to in the seat and he
[1:28:03] prayed
[1:28:04] that's how he a lot of i just spoke at
[1:28:06] that great revelation it says
[1:28:08] i know my redeeming living and i know
[1:28:11] that
[1:28:11] if i die that in this flesh i shall see
[1:28:14] god
[1:28:14] for myself why because he understood
[1:28:17] that if god
[1:28:18] ever done one thing one way he's
[1:28:20] obligated to do it again
[1:28:22] if i can see the pattern in the flowers
[1:28:24] if i can see the pattern in the trees
[1:28:26] that same pattern has to exist for
[1:28:29] mankind
[1:28:31] so in 38-1 it says
[1:28:34] after he had spoken all that he could
[1:28:36] speak
[1:28:38] the scripture says then the lord answer
[1:28:41] job
[1:28:42] out of the world it says
[1:28:46] who is this that dwelleth that that
[1:28:49] darkened counsel
[1:28:51] by words without knowledge who is this
[1:28:54] that speaking these things without
[1:28:55] understanding it says it says get up
[1:29:00] get up that alone like a man for i will
[1:29:03] demand of thee
[1:29:05] and answer doubt me it says
[1:29:08] where was thou when i laid the
[1:29:10] foundation of the world
[1:29:12] now i'm taking you back right back into
[1:29:14] this heaven of god
[1:29:15] it says declares that if god has
[1:29:18] understanding
[1:29:19] it says had that laid the measurement
[1:29:21] thereof if thou knoweth
[1:29:23] or if uh whoever stresses the line
[1:29:26] upon it where it says whereupon i'll
[1:29:29] doubt the foundation there was fastened
[1:29:31] and laid the cornerstone thereof it says
[1:29:35] when the sun
[1:29:35] when the morning stars sang together all
[1:29:38] the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:29:41] oh i looked at that and i began to think
[1:29:43] about you know but when i'm speaks about
[1:29:45] i believe it's in the message
[1:29:47] my life story says i went i went to this
[1:29:49] pentecostal church
[1:29:51] he says i got there and i was sitting
[1:29:53] there and it says then they call the men
[1:29:55] to preach it says
[1:29:56] then they call and they pick up this old
[1:29:59] man who was looked to be about 90 i'm
[1:30:01] not sure what agent said
[1:30:02] and he came he couldn't even stand
[1:30:04] straight and and he said they pulled him
[1:30:06] out of the congregation and said
[1:30:07] i felt sorry for the man because there
[1:30:09] were so many young people that could
[1:30:10] preach there
[1:30:11] why did they pick a man that looked like
[1:30:13] he couldn't even stand
[1:30:14] but he said oh that old man got up there
[1:30:17] it says he began to talk
[1:30:19] he says all the ministers that came
[1:30:20] before him that preached about god and
[1:30:23] and the things that we are facing and
[1:30:25] now we can overcome and all those things
[1:30:28] but he said when this old man came up
[1:30:30] here he didn't just preach about this
[1:30:32] it went right back into the pattern of
[1:30:35] god
[1:30:36] right back into the beginning when the
[1:30:38] sons of god shouted for joy
[1:30:40] i just want to say to us tonight there
[1:30:42] was a time where you
[1:30:44] shouted for joy
[1:30:48] what we're living here is only a
[1:30:50] reflection of what already played
[1:30:53] the scripture says there's nothing new
[1:30:55] under the sun
[1:30:56] so if we are here it's because we all we
[1:30:59] had a representation there
[1:31:01] and we are here only reflecting what's
[1:31:03] already been played up to him
[1:31:05] so i want to tell you tonight if you had
[1:31:08] victory over there
[1:31:09] there's no way you can lose
[1:31:17] there's no way you can be defeated
[1:31:19] because why he breaks the pattern
[1:31:22] oh i tell you god didn't take up his
[1:31:24] time for nothing
[1:31:26] he didn't sit there with the heavens and
[1:31:28] planning and
[1:31:29] killing the lambs and planting this and
[1:31:32] this and this
[1:31:33] so you can come back here and be
[1:31:34] defeated no the reason is
[1:31:37] the scripture says that we bypass our
[1:31:39] theophany
[1:31:40] we have no knowledge of what happened up
[1:31:42] there but the scripture says that back
[1:31:44] there
[1:31:44] we're already with him
[1:31:49] oh if we can only follow the pattern
[1:31:51] this is nothing new
[1:31:53] this is something that was already
[1:31:55] spoken that was already represented up
[1:31:57] there we're just walking right back into
[1:31:59] it
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:03] it says when the sun that's why
[1:32:06] you know barbara says the job the oldest
[1:32:08] spoke in the bible
[1:32:10] when he said it i just thought oh this
[1:32:12] is such true
[1:32:13] now it's coming it's my blessing even
[1:32:15] genesis
[1:32:17] it's bypassing even genesis going right
[1:32:21] back into
[1:32:22] what genesis says in the beginning god
[1:32:25] job comes and the the scripture says and
[1:32:27] speaking to him it says
[1:32:29] where were you before i even laid the
[1:32:31] very foundation
[1:32:32] where were you so he's taken him right
[1:32:35] back into a god
[1:32:37] he's sitting there with his own mind and
[1:32:39] he's thinking about all these things and
[1:32:41] how they're going to happen
[1:32:42] and within the mind the victory was
[1:32:45] already given even before the war
[1:32:46] started
[1:32:51] god is not a god who gives you something
[1:32:54] that will cause you to fail
[1:32:57] the very reason why he gives it to you
[1:33:01] is because you were with him because you
[1:33:04] were part of him
[1:33:05] you were victorious we only hear
[1:33:08] manifesting now which was already spoken
[1:33:11] so he says it says
[1:33:15] it speaks here it says i wish we had a
[1:33:18] little time to go in job 7 and 37 and
[1:33:20] see it says
[1:33:22] where it says whereas
[1:33:25] where was where it says
[1:33:28] where were you when i laid the
[1:33:30] foundation of the world
[1:33:33] before i let the foundation of the world
[1:33:35] declared as me
[1:33:37] it says where were you fasting at or
[1:33:40] were you
[1:33:42] or when when the morning stars sang for
[1:33:45] sang together and the sons of god
[1:33:47] started for joy tell me job
[1:33:49] buckle up yourself like a man i want to
[1:33:52] speak to you
[1:33:53] it says and now paul said he chose us
[1:33:56] in him the church before the foundation
[1:34:00] of the world
[1:34:01] it says watch watch we should that we
[1:34:04] should be holy
[1:34:05] it says not our holiness well you say
[1:34:08] you believe in holiness but brandon i
[1:34:10] said sure it says
[1:34:12] sure not mine but his
[1:34:15] my holiness is nothing is nothing his is
[1:34:19] perfect
[1:34:20] he says well you say do you believe that
[1:34:23] you can drink
[1:34:24] it says oh no i never said that
[1:34:27] look a grain of with can can only
[1:34:30] produce
[1:34:30] wheat it says it can't produce cocker
[1:34:33] bird
[1:34:34] there's no desire in it there's no life
[1:34:37] in it to produce cocker bird with
[1:34:40] it says if you if you are if you are in
[1:34:43] jesus christ
[1:34:45] it says it says don't be deceived
[1:34:48] you you had better search this close now
[1:34:50] see close now see
[1:34:52] if you keep on saying well i don't
[1:34:55] condemn me
[1:34:56] to do this and i don't condemn me to do
[1:34:59] that
[1:34:59] things through the things of the world
[1:35:01] and now i'm going to hurt just a little
[1:35:03] bit
[1:35:04] to pull back the further the feathers
[1:35:06] and back
[1:35:07] other the other way it says but it's
[1:35:10] it's one thing
[1:35:11] sure evidence that you've been you've
[1:35:13] you've been
[1:35:14] you've been to christ you've never been
[1:35:17] born
[1:35:17] if he says you've never been born again
[1:35:20] he says
[1:35:21] he that loveth the world and the things
[1:35:23] of the world the love of god is not even
[1:35:25] in him
[1:35:27] it says now if you just quit doing it
[1:35:29] because you know
[1:35:31] you ought to do it and quit doing this
[1:35:34] quit doing this it says that sign that
[1:35:37] you haven't got nowhere yet
[1:35:39] when you when it says when that thing
[1:35:41] becomes dead
[1:35:42] in you and their nature is gone away
[1:35:46] there is another person in there and
[1:35:49] it's it can only produce the holy words
[1:35:51] that was in christ in you
[1:35:53] produces christ like life now i
[1:35:56] i i again i i feel like it's very
[1:36:00] important
[1:36:00] that we see from what vantage point he's
[1:36:03] talking about
[1:36:04] because i don't think i'll have time to
[1:36:06] read it but he talks about at one place
[1:36:08] it says
[1:36:09] it's like a woman has good you know and
[1:36:11] they have goods and they want to sow
[1:36:13] something
[1:36:14] it said what they do is they take a
[1:36:16] pattern whatever
[1:36:17] if they want to make a skirt or whatever
[1:36:19] it says they will take a pattern and lay
[1:36:21] it on top of that goods and
[1:36:24] it's only the part that falls within
[1:36:26] that pattern
[1:36:27] that's the part that's accepted
[1:36:29] everything else will be rejected
[1:36:31] it says now remember the goods is the
[1:36:34] same
[1:36:35] it's but with the same price it's the
[1:36:37] same price it's same with everything
[1:36:39] but the pattern that's laid on top cuts
[1:36:42] out so you can
[1:36:43] only select a portion of what you want
[1:36:46] to use
[1:36:47] oh i tell you my brother my sister it's
[1:36:49] not about christianity
[1:36:51] it has nothing to do with the bible and
[1:36:54] all of that
[1:36:55] it's all about election and the people
[1:36:57] that god has chosen
[1:36:58] to be as members of this bride this is a
[1:37:02] pattern of himself his lady terror
[1:37:05] and he knows who's in there and who's
[1:37:07] not
[1:37:09] that's why he said you have not chosen
[1:37:11] me i have chosen you
[1:37:13] and not just that he has chosen you he's
[1:37:16] giving you a specific place and role for
[1:37:18] you to play that cannot be changed
[1:37:22] you're not a christian like just any
[1:37:24] other christian you're a different kind
[1:37:26] of christian
[1:37:28] why because you are being lifted up by
[1:37:30] the word like i said
[1:37:31] it's the revealing of the message god
[1:37:34] when
[1:37:35] pastor said it this morning you know
[1:37:37] when god shows these things when we look
[1:37:39] in the scriptures and we begin to see
[1:37:41] these things it's god
[1:37:43] opening your eyes so you can see the
[1:37:46] pattern
[1:37:49] how many people read about the woman
[1:37:51] with the purple dress and just said
[1:37:53] it means nothing it means nothing
[1:37:57] why because they so hell bound to just
[1:38:00] reject the message
[1:38:02] they don't matter what you say they
[1:38:04] don't have it within them to believe
[1:38:05] with
[1:38:06] they just want to reject nothing within
[1:38:08] them just didn't want to take the
[1:38:10] consideration
[1:38:11] i was thinking about what brethren says
[1:38:12] about the woman at the well
[1:38:14] and the priest see the difference is
[1:38:17] when the sons of the morning shouted for
[1:38:19] joy
[1:38:20] that woman was represented in there
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:24] and the priest had zero representation
[1:38:27] in there
[1:38:27] that's why all he could see was wrong
[1:38:30] wrong wrong wrong
[1:38:31] oh but when the woman when he came he
[1:38:33] says give me water
[1:38:35] and he says i know you had seven
[1:38:37] husbands six husbands and the one that
[1:38:39] you're dwelling with right now is not
[1:38:40] yours and everything
[1:38:41] that matched some pattern she said i
[1:38:44] know that the messiah will come
[1:38:47] and when he comes you will do the things
[1:38:49] that you just did
[1:38:50] why because she had a pattern within her
[1:38:53] heart
[1:38:53] i tell you it's the same thing with us
[1:38:55] in this evening life we heard the
[1:38:57] message it matched something that was
[1:38:59] within our heart
[1:39:00] a pattern that god established
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:04] how we're going back just follow the
[1:39:07] pattern
[1:39:08] just follow the pattern just follow the
[1:39:11] word
[1:39:12] it will pull you just a little by little
[1:39:15] it will just pull you little by little
[1:39:17] and before you know you go right back
[1:39:19] into eternity
[1:39:21] before you know you they're just
[1:39:22] shouting for joy the same picture of you
[1:39:25] that was up there
[1:39:26] is manifested right down here why the
[1:39:29] purpose of god
[1:39:30] is for heaven to be manifested on earth
[1:39:34] the purpose of god is for heaven to be
[1:39:36] seen on earth
[1:39:38] walking on earth talking on earth but
[1:39:40] one of them says that the earth is full
[1:39:42] with the devil
[1:39:43] this is set in seating
[1:39:47] we've been told there's 300 000 more
[1:39:49] demons and thousand thousand more demon
[1:39:51] upon the earth
[1:39:52] but it says heaven is also on earth and
[1:39:55] heavenly how is heaven manifested oh
[1:39:58] there's a projection up there in heaven
[1:40:00] and god has a son and a daughter down
[1:40:03] here that are manifesting his kingdom
[1:40:05] they just want to be just like their
[1:40:07] daddy
[1:40:09] that's why we can never be successful in
[1:40:13] following any other pattern
[1:40:16] but random says the church is become
[1:40:20] everybody copying one another you know
[1:40:23] this one does this the other doesn't
[1:40:25] you know we dress like the world we act
[1:40:27] like the world and
[1:40:29] there's a tick tock video everybody
[1:40:31] follows it
[1:40:32] there's the ice bucket challenge
[1:40:33] everybody does it
[1:40:35] there's this and this and everybody is
[1:40:37] following what pattern is that
[1:40:39] that's not the pattern of heaven that's
[1:40:41] not the pattern that's going to get us
[1:40:43] back over where we came from
[1:40:45] that's not the pattern that's going to
[1:40:46] give us what we have need of
[1:40:48] oh but there's a pattern by the word of
[1:40:50] god you believe the word you walk by it
[1:40:54] you become carry off the seed you
[1:40:56] testify of it even when people ridicule
[1:40:59] you
[1:40:59] that pattern will get you back where you
[1:41:01] came from if the musician could come
[1:41:06] that's the pattern of heaven that's the
[1:41:08] pattern would be called to walk by
[1:41:10] there's no other pattern on earth it's
[1:41:13] the panel of god
[1:41:14] he sends messengers he sends prophets to
[1:41:17] bring words to his people
[1:41:19] and when they receive it it's god that
[1:41:21] they're receiving
[1:41:23] and if god has brought them back with
[1:41:25] moses out of the wilderness
[1:41:27] and i'll say this perhaps i've said it
[1:41:29] before in the first accidents they were
[1:41:31] coming from a natural land to another
[1:41:33] natural land
[1:41:34] and they all died in the wilderness
[1:41:38] second exodus they were coming out of a
[1:41:41] spiritual conditioning to another
[1:41:44] they came here they are and they were
[1:41:46] persecuted and the church went into the
[1:41:48] ground
[1:41:49] oh but in the 10th exodus there's a
[1:41:51] promise that there's a people that are
[1:41:53] going to lift off the earth
[1:41:55] these people are not going to test that
[1:41:57] these people are going to take
[1:41:59] why it's the pattern of the end time god
[1:42:02] is gonna come and just take them off the
[1:42:04] earth
[1:42:05] why because they are a top of enoch why
[1:42:07] because
[1:42:08] it's the promise of the hour
[1:42:12] oh i'm so happy with what we have
[1:42:14] received
[1:42:15] i tell you my heart can contain what we
[1:42:17] have received
[1:42:18] there's nothing to be ashamed of don't
[1:42:21] be ashamed of him
[1:42:22] testify of him live for him
[1:42:25] walk for him do everything for him why
[1:42:28] that pattern will take you right back
[1:42:31] into eternity let's all stand
[1:42:33] if our pastor can come
[1:42:43] [Applause]
[1:42:45] hey man
[1:42:49] let's just sing that as you invite our
[1:42:50] pastor this time
[1:42:52] the generation the final voice
[1:42:56] the world oh that the coming of the lord
[1:43:01] is
[1:43:02] all living now
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:07] go become
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:22] oh
[1:43:24] sing it again
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:50] is
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:05] now you know why billy's my favorite
[1:44:07] preacher
[1:44:08] he is i'd rather listen to billy than
[1:44:10] anybody except for brother branham i'm
[1:44:13] sorry
[1:44:14] you're number two
[1:44:17] i mean now just think of
[1:44:20] really what he said right because so
[1:44:23] god's got this pattern he's laying this
[1:44:25] pattern here
[1:44:27] well you know he's got another pattern
[1:44:29] to fulfill don't you
[1:44:31] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:44:35] you know what i mean so he's already got
[1:44:38] something there that you've got to match
[1:44:42] up to
[1:44:43] so he's taking you here cutting you out
[1:44:45] here
[1:44:46] so he can place you in that pattern
[1:44:49] there
[1:44:50] so he took it from there to here
[1:44:54] and then he's going to take it from here
[1:44:56] to there
[1:44:58] this makes me kind of get happy why
[1:45:02] because if i was there and i manifest
[1:45:05] here i can't miss there
[1:45:07] he's not done until i'm there
[1:45:13] and he can't fail no wonder brother
[1:45:16] brahm said if you had eternal life
[1:45:19] you always had external life
[1:45:24] oh i feel sorry for someone that's not
[1:45:26] in this message
[1:45:27] they're just looking for here trying to
[1:45:29] find the whole thing
[1:45:31] oh this means this and if you go back
[1:45:33] and look at their messages over 20 years
[1:45:36] they've changed what they believed and
[1:45:38] the trend changes and they changed
[1:45:42] we got one that come here and he could
[1:45:45] take us from there
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:48] to there he never left us here
[1:45:52] he always put us there's a city
[1:45:56] there's a royal seed there's a lamb
[1:45:59] beyond the river
[1:46:00] there's a fruit tree there's a life tree
[1:46:03] there's a river of life
[1:46:04] and we'll be there amen let's do
[1:46:08] let's go if the spirit of christ dwells
[1:46:11] in you
[1:46:12] it will also quicken your mortal body
[1:46:15] amen so
[1:46:16] don't worry if he takes you and mold you
[1:46:18] because he already has a pattern of you
[1:46:21] what you are to be there so he's going
[1:46:24] to cut it out until we fit that pattern
[1:46:27] and when we fit that pattern
[1:46:31] here we go i don't care if it's one by
[1:46:34] one
[1:46:35] if you knew right now you could get into
[1:46:37] the perfect
[1:46:38] image of christ and he'd take you home
