the song to the preaching of the word may be pleasing To You O God we thank you Lord we commit everything into your hands ask this things in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you this morning wanna welcome everyone in the house of God all our visitors amen we know we have a lot of people out and out visiting and some in Kemp a man who certainly pray that the Lord will be with him this morning you turn around and welcome someone as invite brother Mike for a song reading this morning amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning good morning and happy Easter you know over the uh past few weeks you know Liz and I have been kind of going through this exercise of of trying to go through our family histories it's kind of something that I think her brother started us on we've been trying to piece together you know through ancestry and all that kind of stuff all the genealogies and it turns out that that's not easy to do um you know you're trying to you're able to get little pieces of history on somebody and then you know I don't know if this goes together or not right but you know a couple things kind of struck me as I was going through that first of all it is a lot of work you know it'll take uh it could be a full-time job if you let it but you know the second thing that struck me is it's amazing that just after the passing of just a generation or two there's very little That Remains of someone's life you might have a census record here a little newspaper clipping there some tax record or something like that but you know the sum total of an entire life is really just boiled down to a few small fragments of information at best you know no matter and it struck me as I was looking at that no matter what each one of these individuals poured their lives into spent 70 or 80 years investing in you know at the end of the day whatever they thought it was important to spend their whole life on with what's left behind is essentially nothing I mean maybe some evidence that they ever even existed at all and I was thinking of that in the verse that James said and James 4 14 he said for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away and there isn't any point where that becomes more apparent than when you're just trying to find what happened to somebody two generations ago you know I was thinking about that as I was reading Psalm 39 this week David said this in verse 4 he said Lord make me to know mine in and the measure of my days what it is that I may know how frail I am you know certainly it's a very sobering reminder of how much we spend our lives on things that just don't matter in this grand scheme of things you know and if the Lord tarries and outside of his work our lives would be no different than these who we read about in genealogies and ancestries he says in verse 5 he says behold thou has made my days as in hand breath and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity Selah surely every man walketh in a vain show surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not Who Shall Gather them think about that Selah you know the question is is you know you look at that and what a way to bring down things to brass tacks right at the end of the day that's we're nothing so what are we about is the question what is the purpose what are we here for you know it's interesting David Begins the psalm with an interesting statement he says I said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue you know here he is wrestling with this realization that you know man is essentially nothing that none of their efforts none of their accomplishments none of their labors none of their efforts mean anything and his response to all of that is I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue you know it's interesting to me that what concerned him was not his labors or his efforts or his works but what concerned him was his tongue he connected his ways with his tongue that which proceeded out of his mouth the thing he was focusing on was what came forth from his tongue you know the sum total of Our Lives is now measured by our accomplishments or our labors or our efforts you know even those who would seek to leave a name for themselves by attaching their name to a building or a bridge or to an organization or whatever at the end of the day doesn't matter what we do what it matters is what we speak you know we'll read here as we go through David's prayer that his prayer was that the Lord would guard what he spoke that which came from his tongue Jesus said in Matthew 12 34 he says for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words shalt thou be condemned you know what matters is the word that comes forth from us it gives witness to what we are you know Jesus described in this verse that what was in his heart is a man's treasure for good or for evil in fact he says in Matthew 6 21 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also they're one and the same and then out of the heart the mouth speaketh and what is spoken is ultimately how our value is determined not our accomplishments not our efforts not our labors Proverbs 18 21 says this death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof you know it's either what we speak is either part of what passes away like vapor or it's something that imparts life which we can only do if as Paul says in second Corinthians 4 7 we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency and power may be of God and not of us James 3 2 says if any man offend and not in word the same is a perfect a complete man enable also to Bridle the whole body that's the key you know as I was looking at all these genealogies and generations of men and women gone by and how at the end of the day nothing they pour their life into matters except their ability to impart life you know the one thing we bring in life of value God by God's grace is an ability if he has done a work in us to impart life in our time here is What comes forth out of our lips imparting life or is it just part of the vapor that becomes fragments of information that are in a Dustbin of History somewhere no wonder David's prayer was you know to teach us to number our days but his prayer was Lord guard my tongue not with my tongue protect my ways as we read that this morning let's go ahead and stand you know today is all about Resurrection how one came an imparted life in a curse of death but you know the question is is are we imparting life with our tongue do we have the ability to Speak Life to others or is what we consume our lives with including What comes forth out of our mouth that which will pass away as a vapor of History so as we think about the resurrection this morning the story of the life that was sent let's not make that something of history but let's make ourselves part of that action this continuous imparting of life let's read that Psalm 39 this morning together starting in verse 1 I said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my tongue I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me I was done with silence I held my peace even from good and my sorrow my heart was hot within me while I was musing the fire burned then spake I with my tongue Lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that I may know how frail I am behold thou has made my days as in hand bread and mine age is nothing before thee barely every man at his best state is altogether vanity Sila surely every man walketh in a vain show surely they are disquieted in vain a heapeth up riches and knoweth not Who Shall Gather them and now Lord what wait I for my hope is in vain deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish I was dumb I open not my mouth because thou didst it remove thy stroke away from me I am consumed by the blow of thine hand when thou with rebukes thus correct man for iniquity thou makeest his Beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is Vanity see them hear my prayer O Lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for I am a stranger with thee and a Sojourner as all my fathers were o spare me that I may recover strength before I go hence and be no more amen [Music] God bless you may have your seeds oh yes I spent in vanity [Music] was free birthday [Music] [Music] every day Grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] going on oh I know [Music] remember things [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] around me foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my God of Grace [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen [Music] today [Music] [Applause] before I will say [Music] true [Music] [Music]

man for the cover is a special this morning if you can come at this time God bless you the song I'm singing today is it's called Ten Thousand Angels and I thought it's interesting how as human beings we get easily frustrated with one another but you know Jesus put up with the lot for us he he didn't have to be on that cross he could have gotten off of it his Mercy endures forever so I I hope it's a blessing to you [Music] they pound the hands of Jesus in the garden way he prayed they led him through the streets in change they spat upon the savior so pure and free from sin they said crucify him he to blame he could have called Ten Thousand Angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have gone [Music] but he died alone for you and me upon his precious head the place the crown of thorns they left and said behold the key they struck him and they cursed him and mocked His holy name all alone he suffered air everything he could have called Ten Thousand Angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have gone ten thousands but he died alone for you and me when they nailed him to the cross his mother stood nearby it said woman behold nicer he cried I thirst for water but they gave them none to drink then the sinful work of man man was done he could have called Ten Thousand Angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have grown Ten Thousand Angels [Music] for you and me to the howling mob he you did he did not for Mercy Christ the cross of shame it took alone and when he cried it is finished he gave himself to die salvations wondrous plan was done he could [Music] have ten thousands to destroy the world and set him free he could have gone Ten Thousand Angels but he died alone for you [Music] I shall forever [Music] me to view the cross where my Jesus died for me however [Music] my fault in Soul hey look beyond all of my faults and saw I need he could have called Ten Thousand Angels angels to destroy the world and set him free he could have called Ten thousands but he died foreign for you and me [Music] [Applause] amen amen aren't you glad when he could have destroyed the whole thing he decided to go after his Fallen race a man to restore it the man we have a written request up here from Brother Tawanda writes please pray for my family and myself for various needs here and back home in Zimbabwe certainly want to remember them and pray

through a glass darkling [Music] wondering in our heart what things that you have prepared for us for those that love you just to think that there's so much wonders and Glory ahead of us oh Father it makes Our Hearts Leap with joy we ask you to bless us this morning on this Easter morning trust that you will be our portion this morning we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to uh uh I'm going to try to be short this morning now I'm going to really try to be sure if I don't succeed it's your fault amen do you love him this morning amen let's turn to it just a couple scriptures let's turn to the gospel of Saint John the 14th chapter and read the uh the 19th verse and I I think that sometimes when we read all these verses together and we never get the full benefit of how beautifully they stand out alone so I just take the 18th verse for example and if you just read it all by itself what a beautiful comfort and promise I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you oh my just think of that anytime you get down or you have the blues you can lift your hands up and know he said I will not leave you comfortless what what a glorious thing it says and then we go on to read yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also amen amen and let's turn over to Romans I believe it's the sixth chapter of Romans and uh found in the 23rd a verse and just uh short verse it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord God bless you may be seated well I don't know if we'll get the building done before the rapture but if we don't I'm okay with it how about you amen okay you know uh this great East area is marvelous for for so many reasons and and just so wonderful because we know that in his resurrection is also the promise of his coming and I I think that that should never leave our Focus that um he's coming he's coming back for us that seems to be a harder reality to grasp I saw an outstanding photograph here the other day I I wish I was more technically inclined I would have tried to show it to you but it was photographs of the city skylines across our country years ago at this time and across the city skylines on the skyscrapers all throughout the city were crosses all across the think and symbols of the resurrection and of God being the god of our country and they they showed in this hour now they went back and they took those same photographs and those skylines are dark and there's no mention of the Lord at all and I I think that it's kind of where man has gotten to the place that if you don't feel that he exists and you don't feel that that he's real and you don't feel that he's mindful of him you certainly aren't going to uh look for somebody that you don't believe exists you're just not going to be there you know and but if you really feel that he's real and that he's risen then you can know that he's alive to perform his word and I think that's what the whole our whole hope of Easter is and I thought of a lot of different things to preach this morning but I I this just came on my heart and and I just like to share it with you by just reading a little something to you this morning and just making very uh short comments uh Sharon said to me this morning she said Dad I said yes she says are we going to have service this evening I said yes she says well you're what about giving time for uh people won't be able to go to their Easter egg hunt she said if you have service this evening you know she is kind of uh what we call pulling your chain you know and I I just wonder why that man has drifted away from God why would they want us you know settle for Easter rabbits and and uh things like uh like that when there's such a wonderful uh reality in the Lord but I'd like to read this to you this morning if you would uh uh bear with me in this and I'd like to say I just want to talk about the reality of the Risen Savior the reality of the Risen savior and so this is a description of who that it was that raised from the dead and and I I I like to focus on that a moment who was it that really rose on that morning and and came alive and overcame death hell in the grave broke the curse of sin and that's what we said because the scripture tells us the wages of sin is death and we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity it came into the world speaking in life the very nature that we have is a nature of Destruction even self-destruction not only do we destroy one another but we destroy ourselves hey I don't know what it is why that we overeat and why that we over indulge and why that we drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes and take drugs I I I just was just the other day in my heart I was sitting there and I thought of what gets somebody started on up on some of these terrible drugs like like uh cocaine and act and I guess meth or speed or whatever they call it today are these things that are so destructive uh you know what I mean what place does somebody have to get to where they they give up on life and and can want to fall into addiction where it's so prevalent what the end of that road is there must be such a lack of Hope you you know what I mean because that could that there there's no hope at the end of the road there's no way out there's I'm stuck here and we were talking the other day uh uh some of the brothers and I and we got talking about death and I said you know I've said what wouldn't it be terrible to have eternal life here how would you like to live forever in this oh my I thought I thought in my heart I thought oh you know death death is a blessing you know because it's our our way out of here if you've got the great gift of God and the great hope that with no hope and with no uh reality beyond the perceptions that you see I can see why people are plunging into such fatalism because they lost hope but you know Easter is the hope of men it's the hope of life it's the hope of every circumstance that you're in that no matter if you have sickness that that that that has grabbed hold of this flesh you know one thing because that whatever allotted time that you have that you have a hope that one day you'll be whole whether here or there but this life is not the story that's written there was another story written on Easter and that was the story of another life another kingdom another land another world another hope of sin is death and and when a person only has this life and and and look and all that they could see at the end of this life it is we watch our parents get old and you know my mother will be a hundred and one years old this July and Leslie and I were talking the other day and and we're at that time where you come to a place she's doing really really good and she still wants to do things for herself and she still goes to church and cooks and everything sometimes you just think well she'll live forever and Leslie said David she said you know your mom's not going to live forever and I thought oh she could I plan on living forever but I don't want to live in this I don't want this to be my hope I don't want this to be my future I don't know because they're doing away with God and we have great difference in ideologies in different directions where man feels that they need to take the world and they're fussing and fighting and and arguing and and killing and doing everything because they're trying to carve out a hope for the future people think there's only one hope for the future if we can change the co-governing system in the whole economical system of the world and we can change this world and move it into a different direction and and get rid of this and get rid of that and do this and do this difference it's so vain why would you want to try to fix this world when you can get a ticket out of it okay at the end because they have no hope they can only see what lies ahead currency and value and I thought it was striking maybe you don't realize these things but um and I wouldn't want to burden you with them in any way but there's a big struggle in the world right now of which currency is going to be the currency that the world uses and these great countries are getting together the great oil producers and the great uh manufacturers of the world we know our greatest Manufacturing in the world is done in China and India and places that have vast populations and and low cost of Labor and they're wanting to get together with Russia and China and these places and they want to come up with doing uh The Exchange in a different currency than the dollar the dollar is what everybody uses but they're trying to change that because they're trying to change a world and why do you think they're working so hard to change this world to change the government to change this world because they know that they are dying man knows they can't continue like this they know they can't go on to this why our very life itself our very bodies testify of the world because that's where we came from you can live they know they can't live We Can't Live unless we do something but the wages of sin is death they can't change that but the gift of God was eternal life God has offered this world eternal life a new kingdom a new place to live a new land Beyond this land man's trying to get to the moon create of space stations if all kinds of things because they see right now that this Earth is in a struggle the very Work World itself is groaning those scientists know it they see it in the plant life they see it in the animal life they see it in the earth they know that this whole world right now is in anxiety men are like I told you before they're they're suffering with environmental anxiety why there's so much emphasis on the environment we've got to save the air we've got to save the water we've got to save this you know I think it would be a lot more important to save your soul but I want you to see they don't have hope they don't have hope the only hope that they have is in this life which they're watching deteriorate they're at the economies deteriorating the government's deteriorating violence is out of control there's there there they've lost all a Direction and they're and there's such an effort to try to save themselves and the future think how blessed you are this morning to know that he's risen that he overcame death this world will die whether it's a thousand years from now or 2 000 years from now this world cannot continue under the continual strain that man's putting upon it I saw a cartoon and I I didn't catch the cartoon I had to have it explained to me that there was a person that was ready to receive their paycheck and the person that was received their paycheck asked the person said oh could you just give me a dozen eggs instead and I thought well that's funny and they said oh they said uh dad eggs are are up twice three times or four times what they used to be because chickens are dying I guess and that's where eggs come from I finally figured it out no this this great struggle and so without hope what would your future be what's the plan for your future everybody wants to invest invest in the future I thought how many sermons brother Branham preached on investment so this morning we celebrate a hope that we have a piece that's her path to understanding because the wages of sin is death when man walked out of that Garden the day that they sinned they walked from eternal life to death that was the that was the wage of unbelief that's what they had unbelief the the fact that they disbelieved what they got in return and what they sold out for the Curiosity of what was in that tree of knowledge you understand you today are the witnesses of the tree of knowledge that Eve wanted to have a taste of do you think she thought it would take 6 000 years for this tree of knowledge to take over till where now what do you have a little thing you carry around with you a kid today doesn't even have to go to school foreign I think it's a girl whatever it is mine speaks like a girl you know I I'd say something that I think I'd get in trouble and and anyway I just I want to say it so bad I could almost bit but but I better not they don't have to go to school you can ask but anything I used to sit out and have to figure out what this and what this is I can ask my phone I've got 135 by 80 by 8 inches deep how many yards of concrete is that and then she'll say according to such and such you'll need you know 421 yards of concrete great why should I go to school why should I sit in a classroom you know and I went to Catholic school so I had nuns if you know you know what I mean you know you don't know what that meant did you well that meant that they kept going like this all the time to me and shaking my head you know what I mean hitting me with rulers anyway I'm you know I got arthritis in my hands today and and I'm blaming the nuns you know what I mean sure you don't need it because it's the tree of knowledge but what is it got man it's got them death oh no wonder Paul fit old death oh grave where's your Victory oh death where's your sting amen we have hope this morning so we know what the wages of sin are but the gift of God is eternal life and he said pretty soon the world won't see me no more do you understand they don't see him anymore they don't see them in nature they don't see them in mankind they don't see him anywhere in fact they no longer wish to retain him in their knowledge and because that they no longer want to keep the hope of eternal life that they no longer want to build their future on the hope of another kingdom because they no longer want to retain God in their knowledge he has given them over to a reprobate mind and and like if I can explain that in this very simply when you have a reprobate mind you do not think in Practical logic the very Simplicity of decency is gone it it just it common sense and common decency it is no longer what governs people they are now governed by their imagination whatever they can think whatever they can imagine you know we think so many times of the greatness of our country but you know you you get a viewpoint from the other world and we think oh Mexico's such a a a a terrible place to live how many shootings in schools that they have in Mexico last year anybody can count them no you can't they don't have them they love their kids if you heard on the Rope the side of the road or broke down on the side of the road in Mexico how many people do you think will stop almost everybody that goes by and they'll figure out some way to get you running whether it's duct tape baling wire or Coke bottle I don't care what it is they'll figure it out we had a carburetor bring a fuel pump go out one time and a guy sat on the hood the car with the hood open and with a coke bottle full of gas and poured a little bit of gas burn down the road we go a little bit more room down the road we go but we got there but what's going on here we're shooting people in shopping centers shooting people in restaurants shooting people in schools all they say peace and safety but sudden destruction comes this is not a place I want to live I want to have a hope of an exit I want to have a hope and it's this world is becoming darker it shall be light in the evening time the path to Glory we shall surely find I want you to lay it strong to you this morning that the wages of sin unbelief as death can no matter how dark it gets we have a hope because we have a promise a little while and leave me no more but you shall see me because I live Hallelujah you shall live also I will not forsake you I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again that where I am you may be also what a hope we have this morning this one I like to read this to you because I want us to understand who it is that Rose on that day what he is and what we have accessible to us he says but you shall see me for I shall be with you even in you until the end the hope of the Resurrection is not a future hope it's a present tense hope for he is a great hope and comfort in the time of trouble I'd like to describe how our messenger described him if you would listen and bear with my lack of ability to read there never was a life ever lived like his because he was the god manifested in the flesh when he was born he was the expression of what God the father is Philip have I been song along with you and you know not who I am he who hath seen me have seen the father and God the father being loved when Jesus was the full expression of love he was loved from the very first time his little baby hands stroked the pretty cheeks of his mother he was love and I think today that that's where many is failing to recognize that he was love who was it that Rose that morning what was he who was he what was his personality what was his nature he was love and I think today that's where many is failing to recognize that he was love God is love and they that love are born of God so loved the world that is the unlovable that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but would have everlasting life he expressed his love when he was here on Earth in so many different ways till it is undisputable that he was the most loving creature that ever lived and I think in his life here he was expressing God and the only way that God can be expressed to people is through love foreign listening to the prayers lines last week as we did and others that I've listened to recently I noticed some way that when the people would approached brother random and they would come up and I believe they'd always come from this way and he would begin to talk to him and you know how that he would say he says I'm in that you're a stranger to me I presume and then he will say he said now between me and the gentleman or me and the lady that great light that great Pillar of Fire is sitting in between and he said the great camera has cut a picture of it he says the vision follows that light and there's that's where the vision was because that's who knew he says now you notice he said don't be afraid he said you notice there's something different he says you notice how warm and sweet it is the spirit of God's never angry it's never combative those people would come up it wouldn't matter how dark their sins were what reproach they had where they were at when they got there there was a suite spirit of love and he says that's him you feel it it's real sweet remember the anointing is always sweet what is the anointing it's the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ now as I noticed that I read this and it really touched my heart and well did he he do this when he caught one of the most vile women that there was of his day perhaps they found her just guilty and no way out when she was found in adultery and they drug her up before him and said what do you say do for her and when he turned to her and said I don't condemn thee go and sin no more instead of being thrown her out to the streets to be drunk out like a bunch of wolves over her to Stone her and take her life his tender kind loving heart stoop way down into the sin that she was in and said I don't condemn thee just go and don't sin no more and when he was on his way down to the grave of Lazarus I think that was another great time that he expressed what God is to the human being not only is he a God that can forgive the lowest sin that could be committed and take the guilty and make them Guiltless by his pardoning love but after death has laid Us in silence he's still concerned about us I think he well expressed that on the road down with Martha and Mary when he come to the house where death had shut out the life of a loving person and on his road down to the Grave yet being God knowing that he would raise him from the dead knowing that it had been told him that his very word laid the power to raise him from the grave yet when he's seen Martha and Mary and those who love Lazarus crying the Bible said he wept what was it his great loving heart when he's seeing that knowing that his friends were in trouble he was troubled with them he was so moved by what they were suffering that he wept with them they're talking about who it was I'm so glad to know that he can be found amongst the Brokenhearted and our God knows he's not one that would leave us he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of Earthly reaching has come to its end he's still God and He Loves Us and he was the expression of God I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee I'll be with you even in you till the end and oh how I believe that he Longs for his people to be so Anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his spirit and reflect in the church the love of the Living God that will Express what he said he shows what he did to the whole human race the very God represents himself in Christ he expressed he he ex he expressed his opinion to the human race to forgive and to love those who were unlovable and I wonder on this Easter morning how short we followed that we could love those who love us but he loved those who did not love us and I thought this morning that's who Rose that's who Rose from the grave and he rose from the grave to show that he's still alive and he's still the same yesterday today and forever he still goes to the the unlovable he still joins with you in your trouble he still cares for you when nobody else cares he's still with you when everybody else forsakes you he sees that's that's who rose up it's not the historical fact that he rose up because that they look back if you go to Jerusalem you'll go to one place and there are people saying this is where that he's buried and then you go to another place and they call it the garden tomb and they say this is where he is buried and I like the historical place but he's not buried Hallelujah he's not buried he's alive and he's coming again but he's he's alive because he he he he's not going to forsake you he's alive because he wants to be here with you and the most beautiful part of it when I I think of that love that's the love that lifted each one of us about a sin that's the love that came to that hippie boy in California who is vile I mean when you run around with a group of guys they call themselves the Hell's Angels don't think that's no saintly bunch of Boy Scouts but it didn't matter he can go there what allows him to go there what he is he's love it's a great thing that he laid down his life for us through that price our sins were forgiven a lot of great soldiers has laid down their life on the battlefield to keep our country free and we appreciate that and it's a shame that we've let so many wonderful things that they've died for to become not but what we have is a great Memorial asked the other day as we did the service for brother Otis and we went to the military cemetery and and they take the flag and they fold the flag and and the extended attention it moved my heart and then they shoot those guns off what are they doing they're given honor the last the last respect to a soldier and then they play the taps and those tears just start to go because it's so awesome but he can never come back to fight again his service is history whatever rank he achieved that was the end of his service Not only was it the end of his service that marked the end of his service first country but it marked the end of his service for mankind wouldn't it have been sad if he would have stayed in that grave and that would have been the end of his service all the Miracles that he performed they would just be history and that would be the end of them there would have been nobody else raised again nobody else healed again no more Loaves and Fishes broken it would have been the end of it it would have been a historical God that we could serve and we could say this is what he did this is what he did surely he was the son of God no what there never was a man like him that done so many great works foreign Monument I've been to the George Washington Monument a great big needle sticking in the sky I banged a little Lincoln Memorial a great big statue there and they say all that they've done the father of our country the the freedom of the slaves and the holding of America together and Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the writing of the Constitution and all those things but all those things history they can never serve mankind again it's done and what they did was great but he said the world won't see me but Jews shall see me because I live you live also and that's because I live the life that I had the works that I did what that I did when I'm here I'm still here to do the same thing I'm still with you I didn't leave you I'm still here I'm still the same loving God that went on Calvary I'm still the same loving God that forgave the woman that was caught in the act I'm still the same loving God that raised up the Widow son I'm still the same loving God that cast out the Devils I'm still the same yesterday today and forever I've risen and I'm here and I'm accessible I'm here to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what I could ask or think do you believe he's risen do you believe he still can be touched that's the question is he a far off when he said he wouldn't be he offers to come into our lives foreign in fact he stands at the door and not and wants to come in and be for us what he was when he's here that same love of God the scripture says that he says it'll be the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit he was in fleshly formed then so he could die as sinner and pay our prices of Kinsmen Redeemer but then he went to Spirit form and in that Spirit form he wants to come into your heart and live in you and he's risen to do that I thought of all the greatness that he is never was a man like him never a man that loved like him never a man that did the work that he did and yet he's accessible how easy do you think it would be for you to get to the president try it sometime if you ever see a picture there's all these guys that got these cords coming out of their ears they're trained instinctly to lay down their life when the assassination attempt was made on Ronald Reagan they show the great film then I believe the gentleman's name was Hinckley they show him pulling out his gun and the Secret Service agent is standing there with this fat can he looks behind and they show him turning around and sticking his arms out guarding the president and taking a bullet how accessible do you think the president is a great businessman all these so-called movies Stars I'd call me hypnotic witches because they're trying to present you a world that doesn't exist some fantasy poison to corrupt your mind how accessible do you think they are they've all got bodyguards and yet the greatest person that there ever was in the whole world the most loving kind powerful merciful person is there for you personally any time you call Paul said we have not because we ask not and we ask not because we don't believe we don't believe what he really is we don't believe who he really is we don't believe the record that he left for us in the scriptures we don't believe it when the writer tried to tell us he's the same he hasn't changed he's the same loving merciful caring God that can weep with you that can bury your infirmities that can be touched by our infirmities he can feel with us he knows our heartaches he knows our troubles he knows what we're going through that's who Rose that's our hope that's why we can live because no matter how bad it gets he's there for us he's there to make intercession for us on our behalf he he didn't leave us alone it's wonderful what a wonderful hope we have this morning and Easter blessed be the name of the Lord don't go without them because we have life and we have life eternal and we have life abundantly and we can ask whatsoever we have need of and he'll granted he has our well-being in mind oh what a hope what a resurrection what a resurrection that is what a resurrection this is this morning that he's come back in our day the same one that Rose came back to the Gentile world and once again showed that he was present with us by putting himself on display once again and watch them it's the same love it's the same Mercy it's the same works it's the same kindness because he's the same so we're we're going to finish this journey and I don't think we have long to go but we can't finish it without him and that's what we need because the victory is in love divine the victory is it in hate the victory is an argument the victory isn't in fighting with swords the victory is hiding yourself in the Cliff of the rock the victory is letting the love that was in him be shed abroad in your heart that's the victory because that's what allows you to turn the other cheek that's what allows you to go the extra mile that's what allows you to give your clear coat that it sets you free why because I'm not bound by this world this world is not my home I feel like traveling on and I've got this one great hope that he rose from the dead that he could give me his spirit if it would have stayed there he could have never given it but what was in this tomb there was death in here all's I am is a grave that's all I am this tomb had death but he rolled back the stone and he came out so he could come to your store he could come to your stone and he could roll it back and he could replace death with life he could bring heartache with joy suffering with peace sickness with healing he's so wonderful he's so real and he loves you and he cares for you you say I'm dark Brother David you don't know how dark I am you don't know what's going on in secret he does and he's standing at the tomb of your heart and saying let me roll open the door I'll come in and make it better I'm here for you I've got your back you know when when I want someone to cover my back you know brother Sanders I like to get somebody like Benoit here I like to hear Daniel employee I like to get somebody that's big to have my back Shiloh those are the kind of guys I feel comfortable around those big guys you know they got my back just think who's got your back the creator of Heaven and Earth the Lord of Glory he's got your back of course Big John you're always got my back but you love them this morning that's who Rose
