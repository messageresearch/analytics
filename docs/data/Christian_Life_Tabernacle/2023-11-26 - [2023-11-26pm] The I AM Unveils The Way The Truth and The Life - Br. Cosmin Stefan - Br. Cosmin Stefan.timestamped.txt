[47:04] Us Lord here we
[47:08] are worth 86
[47:13] cents a hand of
[47:16] dust but Lord you chose to put your
[47:19] spirit of Life inside of
[47:22] us Lord you chose that we would be the
[47:25] very ones that would carry your
[47:27] image you
[47:30] chose your sons and daughter Lords
[47:33] to get to know you at a personal
[47:38] level Lord how thankful we're for that
[47:41] life if we make those decisions in the
[47:44] valley on the
[47:47] Mountaintop in the good and the bad
[47:50] times Lord you're always there for
[47:52] us so Lord what would we do without you
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] what would we what would we say without
[48:00] you the Bible says that let every man's
[48:03] word be a lie but your word to be
[48:07] true the only reason we know truth is
[48:09] because you came and you
[48:11] spoke everything else outside of that is
[48:14] false has no meaning has no
[48:17] life but Lord the truth shall set us
[48:22] free so we ask tonight that you would
[48:25] come Among Us Lord and that you would
[48:27] just touch our hearts
[48:30] and speak to our hearts Lord together
[48:33] and that your name would be glorified
[48:35] this tonight Lord we ask this now in the
[48:38] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:42] amen God bless
[48:46] you amen it's good to be in the house of
[48:48] the
[48:49] Lord let's just open our scriptures here
[48:52] to Matthew
[48:54] 25
[49:00] pray for me you know sometimes
[49:05] when the Lord puts a thought on a heart
[49:08] it's it's really hard to try to bring it
[49:10] to an understanding but it because it's
[49:12] by Revelation it's it can't you can't
[49:14] explain it it's something that God has
[49:17] to reveal amen and so um just we're
[49:22] going to just keep our Bibles out
[49:24] because we're going to just go through
[49:25] through what what the Lord's wanting to
[49:27] tell us tonight amen Matthew
[49:30] 25:
[49:38] 31-35 and it says when the son of man
[49:40] shall come in his
[49:42] glory and all the Holy Angels with him
[49:45] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[49:48] glory and before him shall be gathered
[49:51] all nations and he shall separate them
[49:54] one from then shall the king say unto
[49:57] them on his right hand Come Ye blessed
[49:59] of my father inherit a kingdom prepared
[50:02] for you for the from the foundation of
[50:04] the
[50:05] world Come Ye blessed of my father
[50:09] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[50:12] from the foundation of the world for
[50:15] when I was for I wasn't hungered and you
[50:18] gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave
[50:22] me drink I was a stranger and he took me
[50:25] in
[50:26] let's also turn to John
[50:29] 14 verses 6 and
[50:48] 7 Jesus said unto him I am the way I am
[50:52] the truth I am the life
[50:55] no man cometh unto the father but by
[50:58] me if ye had known me ye should have
[51:03] known my father also from henceforth ye
[51:07] know him and have seen him we just ask a
[51:10] blessing upon the reading of the word in
[51:12] Jesus Christ's name God bless you you
[51:13] can have your
[51:23] seats we were so blessed this morning
[51:25] morning by the message from Brother
[51:27] Billy I was really encouraged you know
[51:30] when when you say Amen to the word it it
[51:34] brings that life out because you're
[51:36] identifying with the very truth that's
[51:38] inside of you and so it's good to amen
[51:41] the word because amen means so be it so
[51:46] that means I want it that means that I
[51:48] want to I want to become the very word
[51:50] that we're we're we're speaking about is
[51:53] are not fairy tales
[51:56] the word of God is true and the reason
[51:59] is true is because it has a testimony
[52:01] because it has a witness behind it God
[52:04] always proved
[52:05] himself
[52:07] so um um I was thinking over the few
[52:11] days you know
[52:14] Thanksgiving and just like brother B BR
[52:16] brought out tonight you know
[52:18] Thanksgiving what does it mean well
[52:20] there's other people out in the world
[52:22] that think Thanksgiving was waking up at
[52:24] 4:00 in the morning and go to Black
[52:27] Friday and standing in the line for 4
[52:30] hours five 6 hours to you get a
[52:32] laptop and that was
[52:35] Thanksgiving that might have been maybe
[52:37] the motivation to say that satisfied me
[52:39] doing that I actually felt good thinking
[52:42] I'm getting a good deal but they didn't
[52:44] realize they raised the
[52:48] prices so so now you see based upon the
[52:53] decision um that was thanksgiv giving to
[52:55] them some of them watched the so or the
[52:58] football game you know they were they
[53:00] were thankful that the Cowboys
[53:04] lost I mean or maybe there whichever
[53:07] other team or what that was their
[53:08] Thanksgiving that was that was what
[53:10] they're thankful
[53:11] about but I was thinking over the last
[53:14] few days and I said
[53:16] Lord I'm so thankful for
[53:21] life I'm so thankful for life amen now
[53:25] life could have a meaning to some others
[53:28] but to a Christian life has another
[53:32] meaning so I said Lord I'm thankful for
[53:38] life I want to I want to just talk a
[53:41] little just a few moments about you know
[53:44] the I
[53:46] am unveils the way the truth and the
[53:51] life amen the I am unveils the way the
[53:57] truth and the
[53:59] life and so we read in Matthew chapter
[54:02] 25 about the separation of the sheep and
[54:06] the
[54:07] goats
[54:11] um and so I was looking into the
[54:15] character of a
[54:16] sheep and I just kind of looked a little
[54:19] a little bit and and and try to find out
[54:21] really what the character of her sheep
[54:23] was and then I also went to the goat and
[54:25] I wanted to also look on the character
[54:27] of a goat and so I'm just going to I'm
[54:30] just going to read a few just walk along
[54:33] with us we're just trying
[54:34] to have the Lord tell us something
[54:38] because you know there's also a
[54:41] true but then there's also a false
[54:43] that's being put before
[54:45] us and so we have to understand what the
[54:48] false is we have to understand what the
[54:49] unbelief is and you see based on the
[54:53] character based on the things that God's
[54:56] wed to show us we have to discern it so
[54:58] we could understand what we are and what
[55:01] our purpose is and how God wants to use
[55:06] us a Christian life is not just a life
[55:10] to sit around a Christian Life is a
[55:13] working active life in God that's right
[55:17] I'm why do we exist otherwise that's
[55:20] right what's purpose of
[55:22] life what's the purpose of life amen
[55:26] so I know everybody in this room
[55:29] everybody is a sheep we're not going to
[55:31] take
[55:32] identities everybody's
[55:34] sheep every one of us is sheep because
[55:37] if we weren't we weren't we we didn't
[55:38] listen to the voice of God to come
[55:40] tonight a sheep listens to the master a
[55:43] sheep listens to her Shepherd so we're
[55:45] sheep but we're going to drag the
[55:47] character of of the go along so we can
[55:50] have a balance we want to make sure that
[55:53] we understand that there's also going to
[55:54] be put in things before us that we have
[55:56] to make the right
[55:57] choices so a sheep a
[56:01] sheep has rectangular P pull pills it
[56:05] can see 320 degrees around
[56:09] her so she can see all her
[56:12] enemies from 270 to 320 degrees she can
[56:17] see around her her
[56:19] eyes sheep have an excellent sense of
[56:23] smell sheep are Meek animal this was an
[56:27] interesting one sheep can
[56:35] self-medicate sheep are highly social
[56:39] animals sheep always stays
[56:42] together now here's another one it says
[56:44] sheep are emotionally complex with
[56:47] distinct
[56:49] personalities and that's to always
[56:51] depend on the
[56:52] shepherd it's always for the shepherd to
[56:55] be able to talk to her to be able to
[56:57] tell
[56:59] her so now here's the
[57:02] goat goats are Socia they're sociable
[57:07] animals goats are not flock
[57:11] oriented so they don't they're not they
[57:14] don't they don't like to stay together
[57:15] they always want to go their own way
[57:17] goats are one of the cleanest animals
[57:21] much more cleaner than cows sheeps or
[57:23] dogs goats are curious and intelligent
[57:26] animals they're
[57:28] stubborn goats like to wonder and
[57:32] explore so I'm sorry I know these are
[57:35] just the
[57:36] ABCs these are these are just things
[57:38] that we know does everybody know what
[57:40] brother Braham says the ABCs
[57:42] are always believe
[57:45] Christ this is just a law of
[57:48] life this is what God created so he can
[57:51] make us understand the dependence on him
[57:55] so now a
[57:56] sheep she likes to be she likes to be
[58:00] self-medicated she's a Meek
[58:03] animal you see sometimes God when he
[58:07] makes us he makes us and he identifies
[58:09] us as
[58:10] sheep because it was always the I am
[58:14] that needed to talk to the Sheep to the
[58:17] individual to lead her and to guide her
[58:20] because he is the way he is the way he
[58:23] is the truth he is the life now how can
[58:26] you know
[58:28] him how can you know
[58:31] him how can we know him it's by the
[58:35] revealed word because now the very
[58:39] revelated word the very word that now I
[58:41] receive it no longer remains as Doctrine
[58:45] or thought but now it takes
[58:49] life and now we express the very life of
[58:52] God just like a sheep does if she
[58:55] follows and she goes and she eats what
[58:58] does she do she Bears
[59:00] wool right when she gets when she's
[59:03] always together now there's some that
[59:05] you know they they go astray but they
[59:06] listen to The Shepherd they'll always
[59:08] come
[59:09] back I I I remember one time I was with
[59:13] brother Andrew we were in Africa and you
[59:16] know there's a lot of goats in Africa
[59:19] there there's they're they're everywhere
[59:21] and so you know some sometimes we would
[59:23] crawl through some areas and and really
[59:25] you would see a goat in the middle of a
[59:28] place that you wouldn't even think an
[59:29] animal would be but they would be on a
[59:31] rock eating
[59:33] something they were so curious they got
[59:35] so far away that you they they they and
[59:38] and all of a sudden they were just alone
[59:41] they were alone in a place
[59:43] eating they were they were eating clean
[59:46] they were eating good they were keeping
[59:49] themselves
[59:50] good but they were wondering they never
[59:52] stayed
[59:53] together so brother bam says
[59:57] this in that day of Calvary he says
[1:00:01] Jesus
[1:00:02] said that day he would separate the
[1:00:05] people like the sheep and the goats this
[1:00:08] is out of that day of Calvary 19 and
[1:00:13] 60 now just listen to this and again
[1:00:15] don't take an identity just pull with
[1:00:17] the word and understand that God has
[1:00:20] made us to depend on him like sheep this
[1:00:22] is the whole purpose because the I am he
[1:00:26] is the way so now he's going to show you
[1:00:29] the way now he's going to walk you into
[1:00:32] a direction where you depend on him go
[1:00:34] back and pick up that
[1:00:36] wallet now he didn't have to listen to
[1:00:39] that voice
[1:00:41] yeah he didn't have to listen to that
[1:00:43] voice but something inside of him said
[1:00:46] that's the voice of God I'm going to go
[1:00:48] back and walk another two miles so I can
[1:00:52] I can know for myself if that was God or
[1:00:55] not amen and so when you see it's
[1:00:59] God now you know the
[1:01:02] voice because it has
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] life so now when it comes to pass you
[1:01:10] can recognize that voice and you can
[1:01:13] know if it's coming from the goat side
[1:01:15] where he wants to just go or if it's
[1:01:18] coming from the shepherd side where he
[1:01:19] always wants to keep
[1:01:22] together sheep live together together
[1:01:25] they smell alike they look alike they
[1:01:28] help each other you know when they get
[1:01:30] in the situation and they get their foot
[1:01:32] stuck in the fence there's going to be
[1:01:34] other sheep trying to get there trying
[1:01:35] to pull it out that's the family of God
[1:01:38] it's the law of
[1:01:39] God so brother bam says it says Jesus
[1:01:42] said at that day that he would separate
[1:01:45] the people like the sheep and the goats
[1:01:48] and he would say to the goat stand on
[1:01:50] the left side and to the Sheep stand on
[1:01:52] the right side and he said to the goats
[1:01:55] depart from me because I was hungry and
[1:01:57] you didn't feed me I was in prison and
[1:02:00] you didn't you did not visit me I was
[1:02:03] naked and you you you clothed me not I
[1:02:05] was thirsty and you gave me no drink I
[1:02:08] was sick and you didn't visit me so
[1:02:10] depart from
[1:02:12] me and to the Sheep he said I was hungry
[1:02:17] and you fed me I was naked and you gave
[1:02:19] me clothing I was sick and you
[1:02:21] ministered to me and notice don't don't
[1:02:25] fail to get this church
[1:02:27] so I want you I want I want you to pay
[1:02:30] attention because it's not a matter of
[1:02:31] doing the deed brother Bam's not talking
[1:02:34] about saying oh well somebody comes I
[1:02:37] you know I can put some foood on the
[1:02:39] table brother Bam's not talking about
[1:02:41] the actual works of the O of the of the
[1:02:44] of the source he says don't fail to get
[1:02:47] this church keep this in your heart
[1:02:50] forever so now I want to keep that in my
[1:02:52] heart forever he says it was so
[1:02:55] unconsciously done the people don't do
[1:02:58] it for a line of duty a man that gives
[1:03:02] you something or another it says because
[1:03:04] he ought to do it a man that feeds you
[1:03:07] because he ought to do it he's got a
[1:03:08] selfish idea he said it's your very life
[1:03:11] your very
[1:03:14] actions so it was surprising to these
[1:03:17] sheep that they said
[1:03:20] Lord why look at the attribute when were
[1:03:24] we hungry and we didn't feed you because
[1:03:27] that was the
[1:03:29] life when were you hungry and we fed you
[1:03:33] when were you naked and we gave you
[1:03:35] clothes when were we thirsty and we gave
[1:03:38] you drink when were you sick and we
[1:03:40] ministered to you it was so
[1:03:42] automatically out of love just their
[1:03:46] life lived in
[1:03:49] them he says good he says God let the
[1:03:53] people see what Calvary did for us
[1:03:57] automatically he says Lord we never knew
[1:04:00] that Look what Jesus turned and said in
[1:04:03] so much as you have done one un to these
[1:04:05] little ones unto me unselfish like not
[1:04:08] the second thought not to think about it
[1:04:12] but you are dead you are so dead to the
[1:04:15] things of the world and so alive in
[1:04:18] Christ and so walking on the highway
[1:04:21] that these things are just so automatic
[1:04:23] thing
[1:04:24] you just do it he says now not saying
[1:04:28] now the Lord would want me to do that
[1:04:30] it's not that see the the character of
[1:04:33] the goat always wanting to do his own
[1:04:36] thing always wanting to make sure that
[1:04:38] you know I I think there's maybe this
[1:04:40] other way that I can go or but you know
[1:04:42] there always there there has already
[1:04:44] been a provided way given to
[1:04:46] us why can't we stay with the provided
[1:04:49] way which already came to maturity in
[1:04:52] this generation that's right
[1:04:54] so now the I am will never leave you he
[1:04:59] will always show you the way he will
[1:05:02] always show you the truth but we have to
[1:05:05] have the right
[1:05:06] nature we have to have the right
[1:05:09] Nature by having the right nature like
[1:05:12] brother Billy was talking about it this
[1:05:13] morning I love that by having the right
[1:05:15] nature you fulfill the
[1:05:17] law by having the right nature you
[1:05:20] fulfilled the
[1:05:22] law now brother says here he says you
[1:05:26] you are just part of him his spirit is
[1:05:28] in you verse uh uh verse 43 and you act
[1:05:32] that way he acted do you get it there is
[1:05:36] a way that seem right up to a man but
[1:05:38] the Ender of his death not all that
[1:05:42] sayith Lord Lord shall enter in but they
[1:05:44] that do the will of the father just just
[1:05:47] from their
[1:05:48] hearts just
[1:05:50] freely now when we receive the Holy
[1:05:53] Ghost
[1:05:55] when we have the Life of
[1:05:59] Christ we become part of a
[1:06:03] family so now everybody has the right
[1:06:07] Spirit everybody has the same spirit
[1:06:09] because is the spirit of Christ the
[1:06:11] family of Christ so if the if the
[1:06:15] attribute of divine Love is in the
[1:06:17] spirit of Christ then that means that
[1:06:19] the Sheep the fold the flock that's the
[1:06:23] attribute of the flock always in
[1:06:26] love right because it ministers on to
[1:06:29] another and that's the character of the
[1:06:32] sheep that's what sheep do they stay
[1:06:35] together they travel together right and
[1:06:38] so and so we don't want to have we don't
[1:06:41] want to have the nature of the goat
[1:06:42] where it tries to wander so uh let's
[1:06:45] let's turn to John chapter
[1:06:47] 10 and let's see here what Jesus
[1:06:52] says we're just going to watch walk
[1:06:54] through some scriptures just enjoy the
[1:06:55] word of God
[1:07:01] tonight the I am is the way the truth
[1:07:05] and the
[1:07:07] life John
[1:07:09] 10 verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:07:13] entereth not by the door into the
[1:07:15] Sheepfold but climbeth up some other way
[1:07:19] the same is a thief and a robber but he
[1:07:22] that enter it in by the
[1:07:25] door is The Shepherd of the sheep so
[1:07:29] keep that in mind but he that enter in
[1:07:32] by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep
[1:07:35] to him the porter opened and the sheep
[1:07:39] hear his voice and he calth his own
[1:07:42] Sheep by name and leadth them
[1:07:47] out so your name he calls you by your
[1:07:50] name now what name is he calling you by
[1:07:54] he's calling you by his name he's
[1:07:57] calling you because you were in the name
[1:07:59] in the Lamb's Book of Life the name that
[1:08:01] was supposed to be in the
[1:08:03] beginning this is just your bypass this
[1:08:06] is just your Earthly name this is not
[1:08:08] your true
[1:08:09] identity the nature the goat nature
[1:08:12] wants to give you the the identity of
[1:08:15] Cosman because it wants to go do its own
[1:08:17] things you know I used to be a young I
[1:08:20] used to be a I can't say that but the
[1:08:22] Gary will will
[1:08:24] um I I when I was
[1:08:29] younger I'm sorry you know I know when I
[1:08:34] was
[1:08:35] younger you know I had that nature like
[1:08:38] a rooster you know you think you're 18
[1:08:40] you're you're about to be Invincible
[1:08:42] you're going to win the
[1:08:44] world you you're you're going to be the
[1:08:46] richest man in the world or you're going
[1:08:48] to be the best soccer star or you're
[1:08:50] going to be the best doctor you know
[1:08:52] just the just that nature of just
[1:08:55] thriving thinking I got this this is it
[1:08:59] and then you realize
[1:09:02] oh that's not
[1:09:06] life you know you you start going
[1:09:08] through things you know you start you
[1:09:10] start you
[1:09:12] start finding out that
[1:09:15] really
[1:09:17] life is a
[1:09:21] process it's a process of
[1:09:24] training it's a process of fing it's a
[1:09:28] process of Trials it's a process of life
[1:09:32] now depending on what you use to travel
[1:09:36] this
[1:09:36] life start identifying truly what you
[1:09:40] are and who you are in
[1:09:42] Christ and when he comes and we're ready
[1:09:46] then he can take us
[1:09:48] home amen so verse four and he and and
[1:09:54] he and when he put it forth his own
[1:09:57] sheep he goeth before
[1:10:00] them and the Sheep follow him for they
[1:10:04] know his
[1:10:06] voice they know his voice The
[1:10:10] Voice the I am the one that could speak
[1:10:14] to you in a tape I'm sorry it's there
[1:10:17] when we eat we
[1:10:18] eat the one that could speak through a
[1:10:21] Bible verse the one that could bring the
[1:10:24] the the very word of God that you know
[1:10:26] by the remembrance of your of the word
[1:10:28] inside of you when you eat the book you
[1:10:31] become the book so now all of a sudden
[1:10:33] that's that's the very life of the word
[1:10:36] you're no longer living by law we're no
[1:10:39] longer living like like like I well you
[1:10:41] know today I don't know because the law
[1:10:44] is not Grievious the Bible
[1:10:46] says my law is not Grievious so because
[1:10:50] God is
[1:10:51] love and it says that stranger they
[1:10:54] won't follow verse
[1:10:56] five a stranger they will not follow but
[1:10:59] they but will flee from him for they
[1:11:02] know not the voice of
[1:11:05] strangers the more you pay attention to
[1:11:07] the voice of God the more you pay
[1:11:08] attention to the one that speaks from
[1:11:10] within that you know comes to pass when
[1:11:13] he asks you to do something the more you
[1:11:15] know him so so now that's that's God he
[1:11:20] says he says this Parable spake ye unto
[1:11:23] them but they did they understood not
[1:11:25] the things that the things that they
[1:11:29] were which he spake unto them then Jesus
[1:11:32] said unto them
[1:11:33] again so here he is he's talking he's
[1:11:36] letting them know that he's going before
[1:11:39] them he's showing them the way of life
[1:11:42] he's showing The Obedience by the things
[1:11:45] that he
[1:11:48] suffered there was only one perfect
[1:11:51] sacrifice there was only one man that
[1:11:53] was able to overcome death Hell In The
[1:11:55] Grave amen there's only one name under
[1:11:58] heaven where anything has
[1:12:01] salvation there's only one name and that
[1:12:05] name is so important that that name
[1:12:07] wants to live inside of
[1:12:09] us and Jesus said unto them again verily
[1:12:12] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[1:12:17] the
[1:12:19] sheep hallelu the door I am am the door
[1:12:25] of the sheep and it says all that ever
[1:12:29] come before me are thieves and
[1:12:32] robbers but the Sheep did not hear them
[1:12:35] which is true he's always take care of
[1:12:38] them he's always walked with them
[1:12:40] because they were sheep right because
[1:12:44] they were wanting to be driven by the
[1:12:47] very Shepherd by the very Voice by her
[1:12:50] husband because now you're no longer
[1:12:52] living under under the law because you
[1:12:55] have the truth when you have the truth
[1:12:57] you're no longer under the law you
[1:12:59] should be made
[1:13:00] free so now law is not no longer
[1:13:03] something where I have to think about
[1:13:06] doing no it's automatic there it's a
[1:13:09] revelation it's a word it's something
[1:13:10] that you do because of the love of the
[1:13:12] god the love of the word amen and it
[1:13:16] says but the Sheep did not hear them he
[1:13:18] says I am the
[1:13:20] door by me if any man enter in he shall
[1:13:24] be saved and shall go out in and out and
[1:13:28] shall go in and out and find
[1:13:30] pasture the thief cometh not but for to
[1:13:34] steal and to kill and to
[1:13:37] destroy now if you have the nature of
[1:13:39] the goat and you go that direction then
[1:13:42] then then then the consequences brings
[1:13:45] that upon us because because the devil
[1:13:47] now has access you're no longer under
[1:13:49] the authority of the word and so
[1:13:52] depending on the decision you make
[1:13:53] depending on the on the unbelief
[1:13:56] depending on the life depending on the
[1:13:58] the personal relationship we have the
[1:14:01] decisions we make the voice we listen to
[1:14:04] it defines
[1:14:06] life it defines God manifested in life
[1:14:10] because he wants to have a marriage
[1:14:13] covenant with every one of his
[1:14:17] children it says I am come today that
[1:14:21] they might have life
[1:14:24] I am come
[1:14:26] today that they might have life and that
[1:14:29] they might have it more
[1:14:33] abundantly I am the Good
[1:14:36] Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his
[1:14:39] life for his
[1:14:44] sheep the Good
[1:14:46] Shepherd gave his life for his
[1:14:51] sheep how much
[1:14:54] more we which are part of the family of
[1:14:57] God the ones that that that that are are
[1:15:00] are Spirit of his Spirit bone of his
[1:15:02] bone flesh of his flesh we should be
[1:15:05] living for him that way because in death
[1:15:09] remember there's life in the beginning
[1:15:12] when everything was
[1:15:14] perfect and the first unbelief came what
[1:15:16] it produces death man had to till the
[1:15:20] soil even even the vegetables had to die
[1:15:24] to feed them everything was
[1:15:28] death and so now we come to the
[1:15:30] civilizations up until the second Adam
[1:15:33] and now he's restoring life now he's
[1:15:36] restoring the very life the perfect life
[1:15:39] that was in the beginning back to the
[1:15:42] beginning we're going just I love how
[1:15:44] Brother David even brought it out he
[1:15:46] says we're going backwards now we're
[1:15:48] going back to life because it's no
[1:15:50] longer about the letter it's now about
[1:15:52] the life of Jesus Christ overcoming in
[1:15:55] our life and it's no longer I that makes
[1:15:58] the decision it's no longer I that wants
[1:16:01] to go my Direction but it's Christ that
[1:16:03] speaks for me and by his blood I can
[1:16:08] overcome because remember when we pray
[1:16:10] brother bam said when we pray it's not
[1:16:13] you that prays but it's the blood of
[1:16:15] Jesus Christ that intervenes and ask for
[1:16:19] you ask anything in his
[1:16:21] name ask anything in his name and he'll
[1:16:24] give it to
[1:16:25] us now turn to uh John
[1:16:30] 17 because see this is a finished
[1:16:34] work this is something that God has
[1:16:37] already accomplished it just needs to
[1:16:39] take
[1:16:40] flesh it just needs to
[1:16:43] manifest but the only
[1:16:46] way is the I
[1:16:49] am because he is the way he is the truth
[1:16:52] he is is the
[1:16:54] life it says I pray for them verse uh
[1:16:58] ver chapter 19: 9- 15 it says I pray for
[1:17:03] them this is in the garden this is a
[1:17:06] very sacred moment this is a very
[1:17:08] special moment this is the moment where
[1:17:10] he intervenes for the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ this is the moment where he
[1:17:15] claims them this is the moment where he
[1:17:17] sanctifies them this is the moment where
[1:17:20] he's identifying them the very ones the
[1:17:23] elected the
[1:17:25] sheep and we're in this prayer we're
[1:17:28] here this is our life he says I pray for
[1:17:31] them I pray not for the world but for
[1:17:34] them which thou Hast given
[1:17:36] me for they are Dy right and all of mine
[1:17:42] are thine and all of thine are mine and
[1:17:46] I am glorified in them and now I am no
[1:17:50] more in the
[1:17:52] world
[1:17:53] but these are in the world so he's no
[1:17:56] longer in the world but you are in the
[1:17:59] world because by the power of the Holy
[1:18:01] Ghost by the power of the name of Jesus
[1:18:04] Christ now he has access to his bride
[1:18:07] but it says but these are in the world
[1:18:09] and I come to thee Holy Father keep
[1:18:12] through thy own name Those whom thou has
[1:18:15] given me that they may be one as we are
[1:18:18] one while I was with them in the world I
[1:18:22] kept them in thy name those that thou
[1:18:25] givest me I kept and none of them is
[1:18:29] lost none of them is
[1:18:32] lost but the son of predition it says
[1:18:35] that the scriptures might be fulfilled
[1:18:38] and now I come to thee and these things
[1:18:40] I speak in the world that they may have
[1:18:43] my joy fulfilled in themselves I have
[1:18:46] given them my Thy word and the world
[1:18:51] hated them because they are not of the
[1:18:55] world even as I am not of this
[1:18:58] world I pray not that thou shouldn't
[1:19:01] stake them out of the world but that
[1:19:04] thou should keep them from
[1:19:09] Evil because
[1:19:11] life has to be
[1:19:14] flesh life has to
[1:19:18] manifest we can't we we can't we God
[1:19:21] wants this character to be so polished
[1:19:23] he wants to have it so perfect because
[1:19:27] it's the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:19:29] back now in this generation this is this
[1:19:32] is the I am this is the truth this is
[1:19:34] the way this is the
[1:19:36] life this is the spirit of Christ this
[1:19:39] is the last this is the last age there's
[1:19:41] no
[1:19:44] more so this is the life this is this is
[1:19:47] the way this is the
[1:19:49] truth and and so brother Bram says says
[1:19:55] this we won't be we won't be too much
[1:19:57] longer tonight God bless
[1:20:01] you brother bam says in God's provided
[1:20:04] place of
[1:20:05] worship I'm trying to you know sometimes
[1:20:09] you you you hear these sayings you know
[1:20:10] it says I just want to nail the the nail
[1:20:13] to the Cross we I I Jesus Christ is the
[1:20:17] way Jesus Christ is the way he is the I
[1:20:21] am he is the truth he is the way he is
[1:20:23] the life he's the very one that was from
[1:20:25] the beginning to the end he's the very
[1:20:27] one that accomplished the work of
[1:20:30] Salvation it was him it was always him
[1:20:34] it says there's so many infallible
[1:20:35] proofs that Jesus is the place he is the
[1:20:39] gate paragraph 38 he is the name he is
[1:20:43] the only provided way that God has for
[1:20:46] men to meet and worship he is the way
[1:20:50] the truth the life the gate the door the
[1:20:54] alpha the Omega the beginning and the
[1:20:57] ending amen the rose of Sharon the lily
[1:21:00] of the valley the Morning Star the alpha
[1:21:03] the Omega he is the whole thing put
[1:21:06] together he is both the root and the
[1:21:09] offsprings of David he's the bride and
[1:21:11] The Morning Star in him dwells all the
[1:21:14] fullness of the godhead
[1:21:17] Bing where we are in there as Sons and
[1:21:20] Daughters to God he says in God's
[1:21:25] godhead in God's godhead Amen in God's
[1:21:29] godhead it says yes as Sons and
[1:21:32] Daughters we're in the family we're in
[1:21:37] there now how do we get into this place
[1:21:40] to worship that's a good question it
[1:21:44] says that's the next question how do we
[1:21:46] get into this place if Jesus is this
[1:21:49] place he is the name of God he is the
[1:21:52] place place of God's worship he is the
[1:21:55] only door to the
[1:21:57] Sheepfold and we want to find out how we
[1:22:02] get into him then now if you're into a
[1:22:05] door of course you come in like in the
[1:22:08] family you know when when when you have
[1:22:11] family you you you come in just like in
[1:22:14] the family and we was talking the other
[1:22:17] day at the breakfast about little sheep
[1:22:20] that God would not closed the door until
[1:22:24] he found that last sheep and brought him
[1:22:27] in if you've come in then you become a
[1:22:31] family you're a family of God you've
[1:22:33] come into God but you can't be a family
[1:22:38] of God under the Presbyterian Methodist
[1:22:40] Baptist or Pentecostal it says you can't
[1:22:43] do it you have to come into Jesus Christ
[1:22:46] well you say we did it well if you did
[1:22:49] it let's find out what the Bible says 1
[1:22:52] Corinthians chapter 12 the Bible says by
[1:22:55] one Spirit we are baptized into one
[1:22:58] body we're baptized into the body of
[1:23:01] Christ by one Holy Spirit we're not
[1:23:04] shook in it we're not joined in it we're
[1:23:06] not baptized with water in we are
[1:23:09] baptized with the Holy Ghost into the
[1:23:11] body of Jesus Christ how long does it
[1:23:14] last until you get there until you
[1:23:17] misbelieve your until you misbehave
[1:23:20] yourself Ephesians 4:30 grief not the
[1:23:23] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:23:26] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:23:30] that's right argue with him not with me
[1:23:33] that's what it says I'm reading it
[1:23:36] you're sealed into the day of your
[1:23:38] Redemption until the day that Jesus
[1:23:41] comes for you he said then think of it
[1:23:45] you are then not yourself you are a new
[1:23:48] creature for the Greek there means a new
[1:23:51] creation you've been recreated again the
[1:23:55] power of God comes upon you and you
[1:23:57] become a created a new creature webrings
[1:24:00] the whole physical being spiritual being
[1:24:04] and everything subject to the word of
[1:24:07] God no other
[1:24:09] way that's the word of
[1:24:12] God that's the I am that's the way
[1:24:15] that's the truth
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:19] so John 14 says that that I am the way
[1:24:23] the truth and the life and I wanted to
[1:24:28] just read a few quotes on I am the way
[1:24:33] brother brandham has a sermon on that it
[1:24:36] says a
[1:24:37] guide I am the
[1:24:39] way and so remember a Son of God walks
[1:24:45] only into the footstep that have been
[1:24:47] forward in before him because he knows
[1:24:50] the voice he knows that he knows he
[1:24:52] knows the decisions he can make he knows
[1:24:55] he knows his relationship with God he
[1:24:57] knows when God speaks to him he knows
[1:24:59] when when those things happen but the
[1:25:01] more you get closer to him the more now
[1:25:03] that God wants to show you the way and
[1:25:07] so it says you know when I was a child
[1:25:10] you know there would be things where I
[1:25:12] might have thought they were
[1:25:14] right but then God came and and put a
[1:25:17] condemnation in my heart and and and and
[1:25:19] I was like Lord I'm sorry I I shouldn't
[1:25:22] have done that so so now it's a matter
[1:25:25] of the repentance in my heart to know
[1:25:27] that I'm wrong if I know what the truth
[1:25:29] says now I can say Lord I'm sorry I I
[1:25:32] know I've done it I might have been
[1:25:34] maybe carried away or whatever it was
[1:25:36] but I Repent of that I'm sorry now
[1:25:39] that's the
[1:25:40] way amen that's the way that's how you
[1:25:45] know the way when you repent you know
[1:25:49] the way because now he tells you the
[1:25:51] next step he tells you what to do he
[1:25:54] tells you what you're going to be he
[1:25:55] tells you what the word that you're
[1:25:57] going to
[1:25:58] fulfill
[1:26:00] so it's brother bam says in the guide
[1:26:03] 1962 it says God sends a guide and God
[1:26:06] wants you to remember that his appointed
[1:26:09] guide and we must remember him here it
[1:26:12] says Jesus said I will not leave you but
[1:26:15] I'll pray for the I'll pray that the
[1:26:18] father he'll send you another
[1:26:20] comforter and this comforter when he was
[1:26:24] to come guide us to all truth and the
[1:26:28] word of God is truth and the word is
[1:26:31] Christ I am the way the truth the life
[1:26:34] he is the word in the beginning was the
[1:26:36] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:26:40] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:26:42] and dwelt among us then if we follow the
[1:26:46] true the real true guide the Holy Spirit
[1:26:50] he was to tell us what he had seen what
[1:26:55] he had heard and what he was to show us
[1:26:58] things that is to come amen there you
[1:27:01] are he's going to show you things to
[1:27:05] come and when the churches today reject
[1:27:08] that how can we ever expect to go to
[1:27:12] heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent to
[1:27:15] us to a guy for a guy will take up some
[1:27:19] Cardinals some Bishop some general
[1:27:21] overse or somebody like that to guide
[1:27:25] us that's that's
[1:27:28] deep I'm sorry that's
[1:27:31] true that is the
[1:27:34] truth because we would rather seek for
[1:27:37] men's
[1:27:38] pleasure than to seek for the word of
[1:27:40] God knowing that maybe it could bring
[1:27:42] condemnation I might have to
[1:27:45] repent but now the Sheep knows what to
[1:27:48] do because she's got the right character
[1:27:51] Lord I'm sorry sorry right Lead Me Guide
[1:27:54] Me show me the way it says it says when
[1:27:58] the Holy Spirit was given to us to guide
[1:28:00] us 27 and the Holy Spirit always speaks
[1:28:05] of the word I've got many things here to
[1:28:08] tell you you cannot understand it now
[1:28:10] but when he comes he'll guide you to it
[1:28:13] that's the reason of
[1:28:15] the
[1:28:19] okay that's the reason the come of the
[1:28:23] seals okay listen to where he's going
[1:28:27] he'll guide you that's the reason of the
[1:28:30] says the coming of the seals at the
[1:28:33] finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:28:36] mystery of God should be
[1:28:40] finished and it says to know who God is
[1:28:45] and what he is and how he lives his
[1:28:49] nature his
[1:28:51] being it says you're supposed to be all
[1:28:54] the way up here at that time see
[1:28:56] bringing us into the full stature of
[1:28:59] Sons and Daughters of God a church
[1:29:02] that's been washed in the blood of
[1:29:04] Christ that's bought without money is
[1:29:07] spay for by the blood of Jesus
[1:29:12] Christ so when the truth came we were
[1:29:16] able to see the
[1:29:19] way the
[1:29:20] truth and the
[1:29:25] life
[1:29:26] justification
[1:29:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] in one
[1:29:32] flesh and that was the first one that
[1:29:35] came to
[1:29:36] maturity by the full stature of a
[1:29:38] perfect Son by the revealed word by the
[1:29:41] very life that he was living it says 28
[1:29:45] it says now here we are a guide and he
[1:29:48] is God's provided guide now we're going
[1:29:52] through a Wilderness and we're on a road
[1:29:55] somewhere and we can't get along without
[1:29:58] this
[1:29:59] guide so remember the goat
[1:30:03] nature not getting along with the guide
[1:30:07] remember he's the one that knows the way
[1:30:09] amen you can't tell him that you know
[1:30:11] the
[1:30:12] way I'm sorry I just you know these are
[1:30:15] ABCs he knows the
[1:30:18] way he knows where he's taking us he
[1:30:21] knows exactly the word we need to where
[1:30:23] he's taking us so I must trust my
[1:30:27] shepherd I must trust the very one that
[1:30:29] wants me the receive full Redemption
[1:30:32] because it's by every Movement by Every
[1:30:34] Word by every every every every
[1:30:38] revelated word that now we have he's
[1:30:41] taking us on the
[1:30:43] way until we get translated like like
[1:30:47] Enoch it's a constant walk amen
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:54] says now here we are a guide and he is
[1:30:57] God's provided guide it says we're going
[1:30:59] through the
[1:31:02] Wilderness and we're on the road
[1:31:04] somewhere and we can't get along without
[1:31:06] this guide and dare anybody to try to
[1:31:09] substitute any other guide if you do
[1:31:13] he'll take you off the
[1:31:15] line this guy knows the way he knows
[1:31:19] every inch of the way he knows every
[1:31:21] thought that's in your heart he knows
[1:31:23] everything everybody that's here he
[1:31:25] knows who you are and what you've done
[1:31:28] and all about you he's the guide he's
[1:31:31] the Holy Spirit and he will reveal
[1:31:34] things to you and will tell you things
[1:31:37] that he's heard it says can't repeat
[1:31:39] your words your words right back and say
[1:31:43] what you've said amen tell you what
[1:31:45] you've been what you've got where you're
[1:31:49] going a guide is the correct guide and
[1:31:53] he will guide you to truth to all truth
[1:31:56] and his word is
[1:32:00] truth so the guide takes us to
[1:32:06] truth the guide takes you to the law in
[1:32:09] other words like brother Billy was
[1:32:11] talking about this morning that was a
[1:32:12] beautiful message the law the law has
[1:32:15] set us free because now we know the
[1:32:18] truth now he showed us the way
[1:32:22] and
[1:32:23] now he he he he he is the truth let's
[1:32:27] turn to John chapter
[1:32:31] 8 the
[1:32:39] truth we won't we won't be much longer
[1:32:42] I'm verse chap verses
[1:32:50] 25
[1:32:54] so then said they unto him who art
[1:32:58] thou and Jesus said unto them even the
[1:33:02] same that I said unto you from the
[1:33:04] beginning I have many things to say and
[1:33:07] to judge of you but he that sent me is
[1:33:14] true and I speak to the world those
[1:33:17] things which I have heard of him now
[1:33:20] that's the life of a believer
[1:33:23] as the life of a born again
[1:33:26] believer he that sent me is
[1:33:29] true and I speak I speak it says and I
[1:33:32] speak to the world those things which I
[1:33:34] have heard of him and they understand
[1:33:37] not that he spake of them of the father
[1:33:41] then he said unto them then Jesus said
[1:33:44] unto them when ye have lifted up the son
[1:33:47] of man then shall ye know that I am he
[1:33:52] and I that I do nothing of myself but as
[1:33:55] the it says as my father had taught me I
[1:33:59] speak these things and he that sent me
[1:34:03] is with me the father had not left me
[1:34:08] alone for I do always those things that
[1:34:11] please
[1:34:13] him I do always the things that please
[1:34:18] him I believe Hebrews 11:6 for it is
[1:34:21] impossible to please God without faith
[1:34:24] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:34:26] God now Faith in the truth faith in
[1:34:31] something that has life Faith in
[1:34:34] something that when you catch it it
[1:34:36] reflects the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:34:38] inside of us it's no longer um it's no
[1:34:42] longer um it's no longer a law it's no
[1:34:46] longer uh just dead words thinking about
[1:34:50] now it becomes a life now you're living
[1:34:52] the very revelated word in love and it's
[1:34:56] not Grievious to you you just said no
[1:34:58] Lord I can do better I can live a
[1:35:00] cleaner
[1:35:01] life and he spake these words and many
[1:35:05] believed and then he said to those Jews
[1:35:08] which believed on him if ye continue in
[1:35:11] my word then are ye my disciples indeed
[1:35:16] and ye shall know the
[1:35:20] truth
[1:35:22] and he and and says and ye shall know
[1:35:25] the truth and the truth shall set you
[1:35:29] free so the truth is the Fulfillment of
[1:35:32] the
[1:35:34] law the truth is the the Fulfillment of
[1:35:37] the law the law was only there to expose
[1:35:41] the devil the sin it was only there to
[1:35:44] let you know that hey if you steal
[1:35:46] that's not if you if you if you have any
[1:35:48] other God that's you know he just wants
[1:35:50] to catch your attention
[1:35:51] so now when you no longer are bound by
[1:35:54] that law but you're free in the spirit
[1:35:57] now you're fulfilling the law now it's
[1:36:01] something that God shows you by the
[1:36:04] truth so he shows you the way to the
[1:36:07] truth and then he shows you the truth he
[1:36:11] gives you the
[1:36:12] truth
[1:36:14] amen John
[1:36:16] 18 I just want to emphasize on the truth
[1:36:20] I want to
[1:36:21] um you know truth is very
[1:36:25] important truth is very
[1:36:28] important because if you believe anybody
[1:36:31] or anything they
[1:36:33] say you gather a lot of trash I'm
[1:36:37] sorry right you know you you know I do
[1:36:42] it it's okay I I have to repent of those
[1:36:45] things you know but sometimes you get
[1:36:46] caught up in the moment and you're just
[1:36:48] you know you're just looking at
[1:36:49] something and you're just you're reading
[1:36:51] more more than you should and all of a
[1:36:52] sudden you're like oh I should have
[1:36:53] never read that and you you you catch
[1:36:55] yourself you catch yourself but it's a
[1:36:58] matter of catching yourself faster and
[1:37:00] knowing you know what I I shouldn't even
[1:37:02] do that leave it alone now that's God
[1:37:05] leading you now you're being a sheep now
[1:37:08] you're going by but the heart that voice
[1:37:11] that tells you inside of you're being so
[1:37:13] sensitive to the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:37:14] grieving the Holy Ghost because if you
[1:37:17] grieve the Holy Ghost then you're no
[1:37:18] longer under the
[1:37:20] seal
[1:37:22] so grieve not the Holy Ghost because
[1:37:24] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:37:26] Redemption
[1:37:27] am you're sealed until the day of their
[1:37:30] Redemption that's what it's so important
[1:37:32] to have that marriage covenant so close
[1:37:34] with your with your husband with the
[1:37:36] with God where you you follow every
[1:37:39] leadership that he tells you to do you
[1:37:41] know sometimes we walk into stores and
[1:37:44] and things and we just we just pass by
[1:37:46] real fast we just check out or we just
[1:37:48] do you know and sometimes God said look
[1:37:50] your
[1:37:53] life could have
[1:37:55] reflected your
[1:37:59] kindness amen John
[1:38:03] 18
[1:38:06] truth so here's
[1:38:08] Jesus pilate's got before him and he's
[1:38:11] asked a question so verse
[1:38:14] 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment
[1:38:17] Hall again and called Jesus and said
[1:38:21] unto
[1:38:22] him verse 33 to 40 art thou the king of
[1:38:27] the
[1:38:27] Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this
[1:38:32] thing of
[1:38:34] thyself or did others tell it the of me
[1:38:38] like do you have a
[1:38:42] revelation or are you just saying what
[1:38:44] everybody else
[1:38:46] heard like do you know when you ask the
[1:38:49] question like do you know the Revel
[1:38:51] behind it or do you just listen and and
[1:38:54] you memorize it as as as just a
[1:38:58] language okay it says pilate answered am
[1:39:02] I a Jew it says thy own Nation so see
[1:39:05] now he's he's going the other nature he
[1:39:09] says thy own nation and the chief priest
[1:39:11] have delivered thee unto me what hast
[1:39:14] thou
[1:39:15] done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[1:39:19] this world if my kingdom were of this
[1:39:22] world then would my servants
[1:39:26] fight that I should not be delivered to
[1:39:29] the Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:39:33] hence pilate therefore said unto him art
[1:39:36] thou a king J art thou a king then he
[1:39:40] Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a
[1:39:43] king and it says to this end was I born
[1:39:48] and for this cause came I into the world
[1:39:51] that I should bear witness unto the
[1:39:56] truth that he should bear witness to be
[1:39:59] a witness of the truth everyone that is
[1:40:03] of the truth heareth my
[1:40:09] voice then pilate said unto him what is
[1:40:16] truth and when he had said this he went
[1:40:19] out again unto the Jews and said to them
[1:40:21] I find him no fault at
[1:40:24] all but ye have a custom that I should
[1:40:27] release unto one of the Passover will ye
[1:40:31] therefore that I release unto you a king
[1:40:33] of the Jews then cried they all again
[1:40:35] saying not this man but
[1:40:39] Barabas and Barabas was a
[1:40:42] robber so what is
[1:40:45] truth truth is the very word of God
[1:40:49] being lived in the love of God because
[1:40:53] now you're obeying the law now now he
[1:40:56] showed you the way he gave you the
[1:41:00] truth and those
[1:41:03] two produces the life amen
[1:41:07] right because now is the very life that
[1:41:10] you're walking
[1:41:13] by brother brandham says this in in the
[1:41:18] token he says God once gave a rainbow
[1:41:22] sign for a
[1:41:24] token it says got a rainbow signed for a
[1:41:27] token verse uh
[1:41:29] 61 6
[1:41:31] 1964 I've just got about 10 minutes and
[1:41:34] then have my prayer line he said he
[1:41:37] never remained true to that token he
[1:41:40] says he ever remained true to that token
[1:41:42] did he he does
[1:41:45] yet he spoke the rainbow that was a
[1:41:48] covenant that was a promise it's been in
[1:41:51] there every sense because God is true
[1:41:56] and when he speaks something it'll be
[1:41:58] there until he says
[1:42:01] so until he has the time for it it says
[1:42:05] all these thousands of years he's never
[1:42:08] once one time failed to display it he
[1:42:12] was true to that token shows us that he
[1:42:16] ever he says and never will fail to
[1:42:19] honor his token it says I don't care it
[1:42:22] says if Jesus don't come for 10,000
[1:42:25] years you might have the token he's
[1:42:28] still got to honor it no matter how
[1:42:31] things changes and whatever more he's
[1:42:34] got to honor that token he said he would
[1:42:38] he said he expects us now to display his
[1:42:40] token over our god-given faith to every
[1:42:44] unbeliever cult in the nation and in the
[1:42:47] world that believes that signs and
[1:42:48] wonders don't follow the Believers
[1:42:51] and be true to this token and show that
[1:42:55] the fair has been paid and we've been
[1:42:58] accepted for the resurrection having the
[1:43:01] token life inside of us now that's the
[1:43:05] kingdom of
[1:43:06] God that is God in our hearts that is
[1:43:11] God in our flesh that is now the word of
[1:43:14] God taking truth because you're no
[1:43:16] longer thinking about the ways of man
[1:43:19] and the lies of the devil and all of the
[1:43:21] influence of the world we can live by
[1:43:25] truth it says that's a cutting message
[1:43:28] but it's the truth that's what we need
[1:43:30] is truth God help us to know truth you
[1:43:34] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:43:36] set you free
[1:43:41] amen the
[1:43:43] life and we're
[1:43:45] closing Romans
[1:43:49] 6
[1:43:51] verse 22 and
[1:43:54] 23 it says but now being made free from
[1:43:57] sin and become servants to God ye have
[1:44:02] your fruits unto Holiness and the end
[1:44:07] everlasting life for the wages of sin is
[1:44:10] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:44:13] life through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:44:19] amen 8 1-4
[1:44:23] says there is therefore now no
[1:44:25] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:44:28] Jesus who
[1:44:29] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:44:34] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[1:44:37] in Christ Jesus had made me free from
[1:44:41] the law of sin and
[1:44:43] death for what the law could not
[1:44:47] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:44:51] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:44:54] of the sinful flesh and for sin
[1:44:57] condemned sin in the flesh that the
[1:45:00] righteousness of the law might be
[1:45:03] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:45:06] flesh but after the
[1:45:10] spirit we can stand we'll invite the
[1:45:12] musicians to come I wanted to read just
[1:45:14] two more quotes before
[1:45:16] closing but
[1:45:18] life the I am
[1:45:21] is the
[1:45:22] way the truth and the life and nobody
[1:45:28] could get there but by him by Jesus
[1:45:31] Christ he is the door he is the
[1:45:36] shepherd He is the
[1:45:38] truth he is
[1:45:40] everything brother brandham says this in
[1:45:43] the voice of the sign
[1:45:46] 1964 there's only one form of eternal
[1:45:50] life
[1:45:52] if you've got eternal life then you
[1:45:54] yourself was in God's thinking before
[1:45:57] the world was
[1:46:02] created you're an attribute of his
[1:46:05] thinking CU eternal life never did begin
[1:46:08] or never can end you are a part of God's
[1:46:13] economy
[1:46:16] always it's just
[1:46:19] reflecting so so now it's just
[1:46:21] reflecting it's already been prophesied
[1:46:23] just like brother Billy mentioned this
[1:46:25] morning the word has already been
[1:46:26] prophesied now it has to take reflection
[1:46:30] now it has to say says it's
[1:46:32] becoming it says now you've got one more
[1:46:35] picture to develop that's death then the
[1:46:39] negative becomes positive then you're in
[1:46:42] the bride and with Christ as he thought
[1:46:47] it says like husband and wife today so
[1:46:50] God Christ and it says and the church
[1:46:55] will be the same
[1:46:57] amen
[1:46:59] death that I Must Die daily that's right
[1:47:03] death not just in a carnal death like
[1:47:05] I'm just going to go in the ground no
[1:47:08] that was the law of life is you put away
[1:47:11] death you choose the word you choose the
[1:47:13] life you choose the you choose this way
[1:47:16] every day not just on Wednesdays or
[1:47:18] Sundays it's every day it's the life
[1:47:20] where I wake up in the morning and Lord
[1:47:22] take me protect me be with me Lord let
[1:47:25] me you know all of a sudden you start
[1:47:26] walking with God and I'm telling you you
[1:47:29] walk with God and he walks with you real
[1:47:32] close he's always there for you when
[1:47:35] you're in a situation he's there for you
[1:47:38] when you're in sickness he's there for
[1:47:40] you when you're in trouble he's there
[1:47:42] for you when you're lost he's there to
[1:47:45] show you back the
[1:47:47] way when you think you got to figure it
[1:47:49] out there's still Grace and he wants to
[1:47:51] show you again hey this is the way this
[1:47:53] is the truth This Is The Life yeah this
[1:47:57] is the very one that
[1:47:59] came and you know that it wasn't going
[1:48:02] to fail because he's already overcame to
[1:48:05] him that overcome and Revelation three
[1:48:07] says will I let to sit with me on my
[1:48:09] throne even as I overcame and I sat with
[1:48:12] my father on his
[1:48:14] throne an overcomer eternal
[1:48:19] life
[1:48:21] death then the negative becomes
[1:48:25] positive now brother bam says this and
[1:48:27] who's this mkis in
[1:48:30] closing 1965 it says and then you see he
[1:48:35] come right on he says he come right down
[1:48:37] verse 33 it says and then you see he
[1:48:41] come right down the regular line from
[1:48:45] attribute to it says before the
[1:48:47] foundation of the world his name is put
[1:48:51] on the Lamb's Book of
[1:48:54] Life it says then from that he become
[1:48:57] the word the
[1:49:00] theophany that could appear
[1:49:03] disappear and then he become flesh and
[1:49:06] returned back again resurrected that
[1:49:09] same body in a glorified
[1:49:14] condition but you bypass the
[1:49:17] theophany but you bypass the theop
[1:49:22] the theophany and become flesh man to be
[1:49:26] tempted by
[1:49:28] sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:49:32] is dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:49:35] for we have not yet the bodies but look
[1:49:39] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:49:42] God The Immortal Life inside of you it
[1:49:46] throws this body in subjection to God
[1:49:52] Hallelujah that's the spirit of God
[1:49:54] overcoming death this man is
[1:49:57] dead this man is death all he wants to
[1:50:00] do always run towards towards death
[1:50:02] that's the goat
[1:50:03] nature that's always that nature that
[1:50:06] takes you to death a way may see a ride
[1:50:08] unto a man but the Ender of his death
[1:50:10] but the BAM said it earlier that's that
[1:50:12] goat nature that's the one that always
[1:50:14] runs to
[1:50:15] death but the spirit of
[1:50:19] life is God himself wanting to show
[1:50:24] truly what life
[1:50:28] means it's a constant it's a constant
[1:50:31] life so you could be tempted by sin by
[1:50:34] unbelief so he can
[1:50:38] prove that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:40] does nothing but the word of
[1:50:45] God it says but look when this body
[1:50:47] receives the Holy Ghost The Immortal
[1:50:49] Life inside of you you it throws his
[1:50:51] body in subjection to God hallelujah he
[1:50:54] that's born of God does not commit sin
[1:50:58] he cannot
[1:50:59] sin therefore is no there is therefore
[1:51:03] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:51:05] Christ Jesus they walk not after the
[1:51:08] flesh but after the spirit there you are
[1:51:10] see that throws you body subject it says
[1:51:16] you don't have to say well oh if I could
[1:51:18] just quit drinking or if I could just
[1:51:20] get in
[1:51:22] Christ and it's all gone see because the
[1:51:26] body because your body is subject to the
[1:51:29] spirit it's no more subject to the
[1:51:32] things of the world they're
[1:51:34] dead they're dead your sins are buried
[1:51:38] in baptism and you are a new creation in
[1:51:42] Christ and your body becoming subject to
[1:51:45] the spirit try to live a right kind of a
[1:51:48] life
[1:51:51] my the importance of
[1:51:54] Life the I
[1:51:57] am the way the truth and the
[1:52:04] life he showed us what to be
[1:52:08] like I choose life every day I want to
[1:52:11] choose life every
[1:52:13] day Lord I I don't know the way but you
[1:52:18] know the way and the reason you know the
[1:52:21] way is cuz you already put the way
[1:52:22] inside of me and as a sheep I already
[1:52:26] know the way because I know the voice
[1:52:28] that tells me the way amen and when I
[1:52:30] know the way then I know that it comes
[1:52:33] to pass amen because God does nothing
[1:52:36] until he brings it to pass amen he
[1:52:38] always proves his word so now when you
[1:52:41] see God moving upon your life then now
[1:52:44] he can show you the way the truth and
[1:52:47] the life and before you know it it'll be
[1:52:50] like a moment and a twinkling of an
[1:52:54] eye and we'll be changed
[1:52:57] Saints will be changed the Life Meaning
[1:53:00] of Life Life the true kind of life was
[1:53:03] in the beginning
[1:53:06] amen Adam and Eve tasted
[1:53:10] life Jesus tasted life because he was
[1:53:13] able to live in a
[1:53:14] condition with all the sin around him
[1:53:17] and he was The Perfect Bride an adul
[1:53:19] ated lamb without a spot without a
[1:53:22] wrinkle amen that was a life amen so he
[1:53:26] came himself to show us what life is
[1:53:29] like every decision every way everything
[1:53:34] that you do is that life now that lives
[1:53:36] in you and it's no longer this death
[1:53:39] flesh this this 86 Cent
[1:53:42] Tabernacle but it's the it's the word of
[1:53:45] God made flesh and the
[1:53:47] spirit and it's the spirit now has
[1:53:50] subject upon this flesh and it says no
[1:53:53] dead flesh no dead Roman that's not what
[1:53:56] the word says you can have patience you
[1:53:59] can have meekness you can have humility
[1:54:01] you can love the Lord you can seek for
[1:54:04] the truth you can get on your knees you
[1:54:06] can say a longer prayer you can look
[1:54:09] into the message you can find
[1:54:11] life because life is in the truth
[1:54:15] hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is there
[1:54:17] to Quicken it so you can make a flesh so
[1:54:19] people can see you living a
[1:54:22] life hallu you don't have to say a word
[1:54:26] you
[1:54:27] walk like Peter walked in the
[1:54:31] shadow I'm I'm sorry this is truth it's
[1:54:35] not a fairy
[1:54:37] tale the presence of God so recognized
[1:54:41] in Peter's life that he
[1:54:43] Shadow was healing everyone that was
[1:54:46] walking on the
[1:54:47] street That's The Power of Jesus Christ

[2:01:23] about
[2:01:26] our Hallelujah aren't you thankful for
[2:01:30] life amen you
[2:01:33] know the scripture says I believe Paul
[2:01:36] says the life which I now live it says
[2:01:40] it's not his own life but I live by the
[2:01:42] faith of the Son of God who died and he
[2:01:45] gave himself for me you know we not have
[2:01:48] to great
[2:01:50] Exposition what we need in I would I I
[2:01:54] want to say this and forgive me if you
[2:01:55] don't agree with me we're not even
[2:01:58] looking for power we are looking for
[2:02:00] life amen
[2:02:04] amen I I my my desire is not to go raise
[2:02:09] everybody out of the grave no I want
[2:02:11] that life because if I have that life
[2:02:15] the life will direct me in the way that
[2:02:17] it wants me to go life will lead me when
[2:02:21] when when it's time just like he did
[2:02:22] with Jesus I only do what pleases the
[2:02:26] father people have great demonstration
[2:02:29] and they say it's the life it may not be
[2:02:31] the life because remember he said many
[2:02:33] will come in that day will say Lord if
[2:02:35] we not done this we he said depart from
[2:02:38] me you didn't do it by me you did it for
[2:02:41] so you can prove yourself so people can
[2:02:44] see
[2:02:45] you but if you have life the scripture
[2:02:48] says he that has the son has
[2:02:50] life I want the son tonight I I want his
[2:02:55] life within my life I want to him to
[2:02:58] remove the Stony heart and the dirty
[2:03:01] spirit and I want him to put a new
[2:03:04] spirit and they take his spirit and put
[2:03:06] into my spirit that's
[2:03:09] life you know the prophet will say that
[2:03:13] the the law was only a school Master
[2:03:16] because when there was no law there was
[2:03:18] no transgression because there was no
[2:03:21] law now the law was given to to to help
[2:03:25] to save but when the law showed up then
[2:03:28] everybody realized that they couldn't
[2:03:30] keep it they realized how they were
[2:03:33] rugged and they were all Sinners and
[2:03:35] they were all Breaking the Law like they
[2:03:38] were better off without it but it was
[2:03:40] there to save them but yet expose the
[2:03:43] nature of
[2:03:44] man but that was only God showing that
[2:03:48] the nature within you cannot keep my
[2:03:51] word what you need is a new spirit what
[2:03:54] you need is my spirit you cannot do it
[2:03:57] by the flesh but when you get my spirit
[2:04:00] my spirit will cause you to obey my law
[2:04:03] because it's only the spirit of God that
[2:04:05] obeys the law of
[2:04:08] God oh
[2:04:09] my that's what we need the life no
[2:04:14] demonstration no big guys no little use
[2:04:17] no going but Lord give me life keep me
[2:04:20] humble let me every day when I woke up
[2:04:23] this morning every morning that the life
[2:04:25] of God be flowing through me the life of
[2:04:28] God my motive and my objective let it be
[2:04:31] to show life what changes a person is
[2:04:34] when they see life it's not your
[2:04:36] theology right that's
[2:04:38] right it's not you can expend the whole
[2:04:43] Bible and like oh that's pretty
[2:04:46] cool but when they see life am something
[2:04:51] happens amen like that deer that mother
[2:04:54] deer you just stood there and this
[2:04:58] brother brenham's friend called Bert he
[2:05:00] just wanted to kill it and he continued
[2:05:02] to call the little fond and call and
[2:05:04] call and call finally showed up the
[2:05:06] mother stood there knowing that it was
[2:05:09] going to be
[2:05:11] killed andam said he saw something real
[2:05:15] something genuine I want to be genuine I
[2:05:18] I I don't want to be a fake I don't want
[2:05:20] to be one that will show up and try to
[2:05:23] make noise no I want to be as real as I
[2:05:26] could be I want to be at that life that
[2:05:29] Jesus had to luk pet right in the face
[2:05:31] and says I says if this Kingdom if this
[2:05:35] was my kingdom it says then my my
[2:05:37] servants will fight for me
[2:05:39] amen it says but those that follow me
[2:05:42] they hear the truth hallelujah my sheep
[2:05:45] know my voice and neither they will not
[2:05:47] follow is that your heart desire or not
[2:05:50] why don't we just lift our hands and
[2:05:51] just pray to him and ask him Lord the
[2:05:54] life is what we want oh God the life was
