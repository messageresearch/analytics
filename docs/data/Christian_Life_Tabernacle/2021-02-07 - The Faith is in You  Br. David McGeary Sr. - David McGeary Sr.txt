position in your kingdom and father we surrender you to to you this morning to allow you to make the changes in our life that would please you father we just asked this morning that your word would bless us and increase our understanding and help us but we don't have the ability to even begin to express all that you have prepared for your children lord we trust that you will deal with each heart individually this morning and personally and we just ask that you would bless it to us today in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning it's nice to be in the house of lord thank you musicians nice to have billy back and sister laurie back and there's you know there's some that have been out for a while now but we want to remember them in prayer and keep them in mind the green leaves and the alexanders and and bruce and ronda and and others have have been out and so we just trust that the lord would certainly be their portion i certainly miss them all um but we understand the kind of conditions that we're in uh kind of uncertainties and different things but the lord sure has been merciful and gracious to us and we've kind of battled through it you know some we have different ones that have come but it seems like it looks like everybody's already been infected and we've all we're all immune now i don't know but we trust the lord amen so let's read in our scriptures found in luke the gospel of saint luke and we want to read in this 16th in the 14th chapter i believe starting at the 16th verse and i'm going to read it from out of the message that we'll listen to a little bit this morning too and because he makes a comment in there so as i read it i'm going to read it out of the message because and so i can add the comment that brother branham makes and he says then said he unto a certain man then said he un unto him a certain man made a great supper and made many and sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one accord begin to make excuses the first said unto him i bought a piece of ground and i must need go and see it i pray thee have me excused and another said i have bought five yoke of ox and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused and another said i have married a wife therefore i cannot come so the servant came and showed his lord all these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant notice it's not servants servant go out quickly into the streets and the lame and the lane and the cities and bring in hither the poor and the maim and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou hath commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto his servant go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper lord bless his word lord bless you may be seated this morning we want to understand this morning that um we're really not here this morning for an evangelistic uh service uh as much as we are here to grow in god's word and to be taught uh the things of the lord and there's some certain things that are on my heart that i believe that the believer has to be founded in and understand so they're not easily shaken and and you know i could probably uh express these things to you but you know the reason i i like to play and show you these things that brother branham said is so that you can have that personal connection with it because he's the servant that was sent to go into the highways and the byways and to compel them to come in so but so that part of the word of god is a revelation that we have that god sent an angel in this day and he vindicated him by a pillar of fire and by signs and wonders and and we notice that uh and we'll play this now out of this message is your life uh worthy of the gospel and then we're going to play another little section after this but as we listen to this um it's it's going to emphasize on the rejection and the excuse and one of the things that i want to really have us be established in our heart this morning is that this is what that we are talking about and what it is that we believe this is uh this is fresh manna this is a gospel of fresh manna and it's fresh manna today and the reason it's fresh manna today is that it was stored up just like in the garners of egypt when there shall be a famine they stored up the word and the gospel tells us that in this age it's not a famine for meat and food but it's a famine for the pure word of god okay so in order to really receive the the pure word of god that word was stored up for us okay and in the fact that it was being stored up it allows us to go to the storehouse and receive fresh manna now it's been the the nature of man to not want to move forward they get comfortable they get set they want to build for themselves what they believe so they set up walls they build creeds they build dogmas they they say this is what we believe this is what we teach they put a period to all things and then they build a camp and they dwell in that camp and as long as they're in that camp they're comfortable and then they begin to pat one another on the back and say comparing themselves one with another you're okay i'm okay but what our hearts desire has been and what the brothers have ministered on all the brethren that is preached i was really enjoyed brother randy wednesday night and the minister of brothers that have come in our visiting ministers and and the things that it's god's speaking about it just seems like there's a calling to us to come into a place where we're about the father's business and there's a real clear cut line between the things that belong to god and the things that are of the world and we understand that the reason that this messenger was sent was also to fulfill malachi 4 5. and that was to return the hearts of the children back to their fathers another is the restoration of the faith or the a restoration in the revelation of a living christ a living lord and savior a living jesus that does the same things that he always done he's the same yesterday today and forever and a return to that faith and that revelation and so he sent this vindicated message and to bring us to catch the ears of the believer so in this section that we're going to listen to is i i really want you to tune in if you could when he begins to explain what the mark of the beast is because there's and and i say this because there's going to be all kinds of teachings and all kinds of ideas out there and we realize as we get closer to the end end time questions begin to arise you know isn't there supposed to be a mark of the beast what is the mark of the beast i i've heard that it's they're putting chips in your ear and don't get vaccinated because there's a microchip in there you know and they're they're following you everywhere and yeah and you get all these ideas of what it is and don't use a credit card or that little chip on your credit card they they they're keeping track of everything you buy and all your and it and that you we totally miss it okay and so he's talking about a feast that's offered in other words fresh manna isn't that the lady of age behold i stand at the door and knock if any man come into me can and let me in i will come in and i will sup with him in other words i will feed him the evening meal i will sup with them i'll provide them fresh food it's not a one-time thing i i hate i don't have a vocabulary to express it so forgive me but the message isn't a one-time complete thing it's eternal word of god brother abraham didn't make anything up it was always in the eternal word of god he's actually expressing what god had in mind in the beginning because he was made a messenger and made a prophet and a prophet is one that god makes that he can speak lip to ear to that he that he's he's made to be able to deal with god i would have to say that if i came in to the presence of god above the anointing i'm afraid i would wither and shake with fear to uh the awesomeness of the power of god and even to be able to take it physically but he's made that certain way to come in contact with and enter into the presence of god and god speak to him and then him stay all the prophets stayed exactly with what was revealed to them that's why he said isaiah when he prophesied a virgin shall conceive he said a virgin shall conceive and that's madness but yet it's what god had in his thinking so i believe that god had something in his thinking for each of you in this age that he predestined in 88 to jute to be in and that the the person the servant is who goes out and compels to you to come to that place so in in sharing this with you and listening this together we can all understand what the servant is compelling us to come to in other words what feast is it that the messenger wants us to come to if it's the feast of fresh manna a feast of fresh manna not an old historical story you understand i don't want a historical story of jesus i don't want a historical story of the church i don't want the doctrines of these things but i want to go into a higher place i want to be fed and be enlightened and have greater revelation i want to be fed fresh manna for today and you still can't escape the fact that it was the servant that came and compelled us to come into the feast you understand so if you do away with the servant you do away with the one that's got the power to compel you it am i making any sense this morning so you you have to make that connection and that understanding with the message of this hour that that's the servant that's going to cause the compel the compelling power within you to move into higher ground though he did send his servants out and they told everybody that there's a feast and that's what we do we go out can say there's manna and mannak and there's a feast and there's food prepared for you but when that person comes it's that servant that went out and compels the heart to come in so in saying those things let us look because when they went out everybody came up with an excuse so we need a self-examination that we are that we haven't built excuses you know we could put school in here we could put job in there you know we could have all these little different things but what was the excuse the excuses kept them from eating fresh man so it's very simple to say i believe the message i believe god sent a prophet excuse me and i believe everything that's there but there's still fresh feasting mana that's there for you personally so let's listen to this this is uh 18 minutes and it's a real good 18 minutes and i and like i said i'm not here to evangelize this morning i you know i'm i'm i'm not an evangelist i'm you know i guess god called me to be a pastor and it's what i am i didn't want to be but i didn't have a choice and that he sort of made it happen and always wanted to be an apostle you know go missionary well praise god there's a lot of missionary work to do right here in the united states but so uh for those of you i i hope that they've got the interpreters have got the information and we're trying to get a system in place where uh i don't know i'm not technical so i don't know but they can have the message pulled up uh if you can pull it up on your phone in your language we're starting in is your life worthy of the gospel it's 30 minutes into the tape and it's paragraph 42 and we'll listen for 18 minutes here and i think we end up i don't know we end up at the end of paragraph 76 and so i trust that we will sit here this morning in a bible atmosphere this morning and a sunday school atmosphere we'll learn of the word of god we can answer some of the questions that are out there and i just want to cover a few things this morning that i think will be beneficial to us so lord bless you this morning so as we begin to play out of is your life worthy of the gospel and just listen close this morning and we'll try to just do the best we can to share with you what's on our heart this morning god bless you jesus tell him that their excuses is what killed the prophets and what killed the righteous that come they accepted their creeds that man had given them instead of taking the word of god and by doing so had made the word of god of no effect now you've either got to say in this that this is god's will and god's desire or either something else that you can crop up that's better than what this is now you have to take one or the other you can't serve god and man and you've got to say this is the truth or that's part of the truth or it isn't all the truth or it isn't put together right or it's isn't interpreted right and the bible said that the word of god is no private interpretation no one else is supposed to put an interpretation to it it's written just the way god wants it interpreted just what it says that that's what's supposed to be just take it the way it said which wrote down here now they accept their creeds they make gods a promises of no effect to them they bypass that just skip away from it now if russia had accepted the pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the holy ghost fell in russia they wouldn't have been communist today now 75 years ago they had a great revival in russia god come among them and they had great revivals way into siberia and what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone and the churches can't have church uh only honor permission and they are doomed into judgment has gone off on this wild tantrum of communism sold out to the devil 50 years ago the holy ghost fell in england just after that come george jeffries and f.f bosworth and charles price smith wigglesworth those great warriors of the faith 50 years ago and offered england the holy ghost revival but what did they do they laughed at them put them in jail called them crazy thought they lost their minds the churches refused the people to come hear them and they healed the sick and cast out devils and done great works and because that england as a nation rejected the gospel her her sins is known throughout all the world there's hardly a a more of an apostate a nation in all the world even including rome and france than england she's a mother of apostasy right where uh finney and many of the great man preached in the hay market and charles g finney and wesley and on down and she turned it down and down even last week or two in the papers you find out where their great man has so weakened to the to this sect of women until spies come into their head man found some more of them the magazines is packed it their sin of scandal right in their government has sold their disgraceful name across the world why she rejected the truth she had her excuse and she's finished england is all washed up with god long time ago if america 15 years ago when the great healing revival continued on from pentecost broke out in the nation and there was a revivals on the capitol washington d.c the presidents vice presidents great people governors great things taking place governors and and man were healed that congressman up shaw had been a for for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it at all she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation and she's rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything i can think of and a religious system is rotten her than the morals she becomes and doing this she has now joined herself all these churches and the nation into the federation of churches and has taken the mark of the beast what a thing why christ give them the opportunity come to my feast the feast of pentecost which means fifty when the holy spirit poured out on russia they was called to a feast of pentecost spiritual feast and they turned it down england the holy ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down america the holy ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down he bit three times three times he sent out and they did not listen to the feast and he sent again and he said go and compel those people to come the table's got to be set the table's ready there's still room and i believe that maybe maybe within the next few months or something or a year or whatever it is god's going to send another shaking across the country for the somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone i was looking in this week's life magazine down at the world down at little rock or the other day or rather hot springs and there i seen i believe it was a governor of the state of new york where some kind of a striptease over in holland dancing with her now and here below that was another renowned man oh what a disgrace look at our nation today look at the condition of our of our nation look where she's went to how low she sunk look at our religious system today how can it be that the churches can ever get into the condition that they are now is because they have rejected and refused a message of god the invitation to come to the feast could you call a life like that worthy of the gospel could you call a life that could set and permit their their people to do the things to smoke cigarettes the other day down here a certain church a little league team was playing down here at the park and uh brother-in-law's little boy is a pitcher uh for one of the teams and so he was out there pitching and there was a church league playing and there was a pastor with these little fellows out there on the ground playing and the pastor smoked cigarette after cigarette of a real neighborly church right nearby and could you imagine a man and even people sitting in the audience noticed it but it's getting so that they don't even pay attention to it a certain great church of baptist church that i know of lets a church out from sunday school 15 extra minutes so that the pastor and all of them can stand outside and smoke before they come back in to serve the duty of the law john smith the founder of that church prayed so hard that god sent the revival until his eyes swole shut at night and his wife had to lead him to the table and feed him with a spoon if that man would turn over in his grave if he know that church had gotten that condition what is it they were bidding to come and turn it down that's the only thing and you remember jesus said in here that those that were bitten and turned it down would not taste his supper when god sends a holy ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down for some time he's going to turn it for his last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in the church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do so much and say i know it's right but never put a finger on it to help it yourself see you just listen to it because you say i believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it i could say i believe that's a ten thousand dollars that don't mean i got it thing i could say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what i mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't be have the privilege to come and receive it to you people who come here i'm not responsible for those who are or other ministers are speaking to but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you than to know that you can have eternal life what if i was giving away capsules here that scientifically proven scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well i'd i'd have to get a militia out here and swarm away from the place you wouldn't have to make an altar call it you just have to beat him away from it to live a thousand years and yet scientifically proven that the eternal god all these power of his resurrections which promise you eternal life and satan will put his legions out there and keep you away from it yet you can look it's sensible enough look in the face of it and see it's right but then turn it down see something some kind of excuse it's too hot i'm too tired i will tomorrow just some kind of an excuse that's all they do by rejecting the day of visitation it separates you from god now we noticed in the old testament they had what they call the jubilee year that was when all the people that was slaves could go free when the jubilee sounded and then if the man did not go out if there was some excuse that he could give that he didn't want to return to his land then he had to be marked in the ear with an awl by the post in the temple and then no matter how many jubilees come along that man was sold out he could never no more come back as a citizen in israel no more what did he do he rejected his invitation he didn't have to pay nothing the debt of his slavery was over his family was free he could go right back to his homeland and get his own possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't allowed no more with israel and his possession was given to another now the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that if we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that it's true and we reject it and refuse to do it or to listen to it we take on the mark of the beast now somebody said now there's going to be a a mark of the beast it's going to come someday let me tell you it's already come as soon as the holy ghost began to fall the mark of the beast began to take place see you only have two things one of them is accepted takes the seal of god to reject it takes the mark of the beast do you reject the seal of god is to take the mark of the beast everybody understand to reject the seal of god is to take the mark of the beast for the bible said all that was not sealed by the seal of god took the mark of the beast when the trumpet sounded all wanted to go free could go there but it was marked now you see the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future is when it's going to be made manifest when you realize that what you've already done see and so is the holy spirit it's to be manifested when we see the lord jesus coming in glory and feel that transforming power and see the dead rising out of the grave i know that a second longer will be changed and have a body like his it'll be made manifest then to see those who rejected it will be left down out then jesus said the virgins went out to meet christ some of them fell asleep the first watch second third fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch but in the seventh watch then came forth the sound behold the bridegroom coming out the needy and the ones that were sleeping awakened all the age back to pentecost woke up see from the seventh age the seventh church age all the way back through woke up and these that were in this church age of living they were changed and they went in at the very time they went in the sleeping version come and said we want to buy some of your oil but they said we just got enough for ourselves go to them and sell it and while they were trying to receive this aura the bridegroom came there has never been a time in the history of the world that the episcopalians baptists methodists presbyterians the papers are full the religious papers are praising god that those sleeping virgins are now trying to receive pentecost trying to receive the holy ghost and not the people realize that it will not happen according to the word of god while they were trying to come back the bridegroom come and talk away the bride they were cast into outer darkness for judgment because they rejected their invitation all peoples are forbidden to come god in every age has sent out his life and it's been rejected and now today is no different from any other date to reject the day of the visitation when god is making a visit to the church and to the people receive it then don't put it off the next year the next revival that's the hour today is a day of salvation and remember god has never sent a message in any day but what he vindicated with the supernatural jesus said himself if i do not the works of my father then believe me not but if i do the works you believe that works if you can't believe me when you see it clearly cut and made manifest now the time has come that she rejects it then she's bored in the ear with an awl then she'll never hear it now she takes herself to the confederation of churches to go right in to take the mark of the beast one of the great ambitions somebody gave me the paper and just now the this new pope has said is to unite the churches together they'll do it just as certain as i'm standing here and the protestants fall apart see because the church the bible said paul the prophet of the lord said that day will not come except there come a falling away first and then the man before the man of sin will be revealed he that set up in the temple of god opposing himself all that's above god he as god forgiving sins on the earth and so forth how that this thing happened but it couldn't happen until the falling away until the church began to get away from the spiritual feasts draw itself back and organize itself and then the revelation didn't stay with the church remember israel walked day and night by the pillar of fire when that pillar fire moved they moved with it and remember it was a fire at night and a cloud a day so it might come day or night any time but wherever it was there was a propitiation made that they would not fail to see it it was a light at night and a cloud in the daytime and they followed it yes sir that same thing martin luther saw it what did he do he come out of catholicism well what did they do they built a little fence around said we're lutherans this is it then wesley saw it moving away from there he went what they do build a little fence around and said this is it what did i do moved right on again pentecost saw it what they do moved out of the westland and nazarenes and so forth what did they do they built a little fence right called we're one this and we're trinity and we're the united and all this what did he do god moved right on out of it see we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the lord jesus christ if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow christ daily is not worthy amen all right we're here to bible study this morning right because we wanted we want to be established in good sound firm doctrine the mark of the beast when pentecost fell when god fell the holy ghost fell the mark of the beast fell because rejection is to take the mark there was many great statements about that he says and refuse to he says now the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that if if we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that it's true and reject it and refuse to do it or to listen to it we take the mark of the beast and so that there's a great explanation that he's talking and and as we listened he talked about they no longer kept the revelation uh it's it's kind of a great thing of appreciation but he said he says when god sends the holy ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down something he's going some day sometime he's going to turn it down for the last time and then you won't be a privileged character so do you understand that it's a privilege to have god knocking at your heart it's a privilege to have god dealing with you but but understand the consequences if you keep turning it down and keep turning it down and keep turning it down there comes a time where okay i get the message see we've we've predestinated ourselves to such a place that there's no consequences we can do whatever we want and that it just shows there's not that love affair now if you're battling something in your life and again you've got a problem and maybe it's less maybe it's alcohol maybe it's cigarettes maybe it's the flesh in any kinds of way there's a lot of difference when the spirit can bring you under conviction and you start crying in your heart have mercy on me father have mercy on me take this from me i don't want to be like that okay and then you you allow the spirit of god to work on you and the church doesn't condemn that person they wrap their arms around that person and they pray for that person until that person is filled with the deliverer which is the baptism of the holy ghost not a sympathizer i know it's right i i see it's right i think it's a great thing he said that's just sympathizing with it he says you're not a privileged character you ca you can sit in a church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel that's real easy to do isn't it because we've got the most vindicated most powerful explanation of the word nobody's ever been able to put the pieces of the puzzle together like brother brandon we can see the picture but that's not our question our question is what is my place what is my role you you understand it's an individual affair and and you know i like i always say if you're you're young enough to sit in a classroom at school and learn math and learn english and learn algebra and science and all the things they teach you're old enough to read your bible and hear from god you just don't want to get too far past 18 19 20 21 22 years old because it gets more difficult because your heart gets harder and your mind gets more polluted so now is the day of salvation when god deals with you go right now he says he said he he said and you agree with the gospel you might do so much and say i know that it's right but never put a finger on it to help it yourself you just listen to it because you say i believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it now let me ask a question i'm not to me you're all saints i don't see nothing but halos and wings okay but you know whether you're sympathizing or not you know whether you're keeping it in your heart and it's not going any further you know it's like the girls that leave leave home with their long dress and then they pin their skirts up on the bus you know or at school you know first thing they go and they pin and they you know and they slip off their shoes and put on their heels and they do all this stuff well you know you're not fooling you might fool your parents but you're you're you're not fooling the one that wants to give you eternal life he said if i had a pill here you would come running for this pill and yet what is the gospel that we're worthy of and there's you've got to ask you is your life worthy the gospel you've got to have have the answer to the question what is the gospel so you know what it is the gospel is the lord jesus came to this earth paid the price for all your sins well you were yet a sinner he was dying on the cross for you then the gospel is telling you that he died and that he has eternal life to offer you and that you can receive that eternal life in your life it's a life-changing thing but if you reject it what do you get the mark of the beast and he says and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't be you won't be have the privilege to come and receive it so this that's the gospel the gospel is in doctrines and teachings and and and uh theology the gospel is a god who is eternal quickening in you and putting in you that eternal life and that life that eternal life which we refer to as the spirit god above us creating heaven and earth god with us redeem us from redeeming us from sin now god in us eternal life because if the spirit that dwelleth in christ jesus dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body now now listen as i read this when the trumpet sounds and all want you this is paragraph 64. out of is your life worthy of the gospel if you could put that up so we can we want to settle some things in our heart okay because satan's the author of what and how does satan create confusion by offering different different explanations and when the trumpet sounded and all wanted to go free could go and them that didn't was marked now you say the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future is when it's going to be made manifest when you realize it's what you've all already done oh i thought this was supposed to happen and all of a sudden it's on and all of a sudden you realize what you've done you've rejected eternal life so one day that realization is going to come but what did he talk about making excuses making excuses someday later i'll get in the ho ho you better jump on it now let's listen to this great thing that's when it's madison and so is the holy spirit it's to be manifested when we see lord jesus coming in glory and feel the transforming power so what is that if that same spirit of eternal life is in you it will also quicken your mortal body so there's gonna come a time you understand so you don't have to worry about the rapture you don't have to worry about this you don't have to worry about when the quickening power is in you if the he gave you eternal life and if the same spirit that was in christ jesus in you at that time of quickening you feel the quickening taking place it's right there settle it settle it i'm going to live my life i'm going to live according to the word of god and when the rapture comes i will feel the transforming power begin to work in me because if i have the same spirit it will quicken my mortal body the only thing i've got to have is the spirit that'll quicken me we see jesus come and glory and feel the transforming power and see the dead rising out of the grave and know in a second longer we'll be changed and have a body like his it'll be made manifested then to those who rejected it they'll be left down and out and i talked about this now looking at this last little statement and we'll move on to our next tape that day will come this is paragraph 71 out of paragraph 71. that day will come except there come a falling away first before the man of sin will be revealed and the setting in the temple of god upholding his forth and now this thing's happened but it couldn't happen until to falling away until the church began to get away from the spiritual feast and draw itself back and organize itself they had to get away from what the spiritual feast i wonder if i i don't like to talk about the message in everybody but could it could we possibly as a group of people and of sympathizers with the gospel be getting away from the spiritual feast okay so we believe it we sympathize it we know what it says but we've we've lacked that sitting down and opening the door and supping with him and we don't want to do that we want to be careful he says but it couldn't happen until the falling away until the church began to get away from the spiritual feast and draw itself back and organize itself and then the revelation didn't stay with the church i want revelation so do you feel there's still revelation for you in the word of god you still there's still a feast that you can feast with the word of god that you can still grow can you can still be quickened and and the spirit of god is moving on you so the question was is your life worthy of the gospel so we realized that a life that's worthy of the gospel is a life that doesn't reject the word of god it takes correction it takes instructions i could say tonight right now i could say that without taking communion you will not be there but 50 of you won't come back for communion 50 of us kevin always miss communion what's your excuse it's the ordinances of god water baptism communion and foot washing that's the ordinances the three ordinances that we should perform the commission is to go into all the world and tell the world about eternal life but so we we end up playing this sympathizer game i'm not your judge your works express your faith you understand there's something about what you do that manifests your revelation so someone that continually misses communion has no revelation i don't believe that they would do it miss it if they had a revelation but if they had a revelation and i hope i don't sound condescending but what i want you to understand is really get a grip on what he looks at you know if you believe something then you act accordingly that's a quote you act accordingly right if you believe you get burned putting your hand over the fire you just don't go skating your hand in the fire naturally but we always stick our hand in the fire spiritually so okay let's just listen to eight minutes now so are are you seeing how i'm put trying to show you something that brother random says he says these things in all his messages he he lays them out there if he's just trying to get to the heart of his children his sons and daughters which are taught by the tudor which is the holy spirit so he can tutor them that they can be positionally placed and do something for it lift a finger and that what we're trying to bring the church to is where we start lifting our finger because we know if we sow will reap that's right we're going to pick up in paragraph 159 and we're going to go to the end of 175. these are up or let me let me see maybe i'll go a little past one we'll go through paragraph 183 and we'll stop at the end of point 83. we're going to talk about moses and david and how that their works expressed their revelation so we just talked about the offer of eternal life and it being rejected and that the mark of the beast and either you have the seal of god or you have the mark of the beast if i could say it like this either you have revelation or you don't intellect leaves you lukewarm it won't let you sell out but it won't let you go bad just kind of trying to figure out where you fit okay but now we're talking about people that are sold out and what that their actions were what were their works what was the evidence of their faith now you'll see what pharaoh thought the evidence of his faith was you'll see what goliath thought the evidence of the faith is and you'll be able now to understand what the world looks for as the evidence of your faith and the question is will he find faith when he comes back in other words will he find people doing the work of faith and so i i you understand why that i'm using but i'm not using that i want you to hear the gospel from the servant the one that i want to create that promise to create in us and to compel us to come eat the feast don't you think when that prophecy came past of the woman and vice president in a purple dress i mean we had people show up to church they've never been here in years and years because they were scared to death and then it wore off in a few days the revelation didn't stick with them and then they're gone right they didn't keep coming to the feast and the revelation didn't remain with the church now let's examine ourselves by comparing ourselves if i could use that word don't don't compare by looking at what real revelation did in real believers eight minutes and then we'll close here in just a little bit moses with a stick in his hand came to take the people from pharaoh now could you imagine moses the bible said that he was taught in all the wisdom of the egyptians he was smart he could teach their intellects things he is taught all their wisdom he didn't need to catch up on his education now you just think about a man out there in the wilderness with all that education and then god appearing to him and said moses take this stick in your hand and go down there in egypt and bring my children out with this switch you got your hand just lick the whole thing with this switch now what if moses said sir just a moment i thought i was talking to an intelligent being this great i am that you say you are now how in the world would i ever take this little old crooked stick i got here in my hand and take over an army of million a man armed with spears fighters and i'm not a fighter i'm a shepherd how can i ever do that there was no question why why the ground in his heart he was a predestinated person gifts and callings are without repentance god who told abraham that he would do that and there was the ground prepared and moses took this stick and went down there and tucked that nation out of a nation when he come with the stick in his hand and told pharaoh let him go pharaoh seen in moses the works that he had faith in what he was going to do or trying to do he had faith in the promise of the god and made the promise he went down to take it over no other man would have done that and no other man could have done it he was ordained to do it god beforehand had told abraham that's that's just what would happen and when the time of the promise drew nigh there was a little boy born a fair child and the parents amarama jose bell was not afraid of the king's commandments see there was something the grounds was already prepared oh god i hope i'm speaking to the ground prepared tonight if the seed can fall in the right place and it's going to be so if it isn't it won't happen that's the same thing would you say brother brahm that kind of takes it away from us if it does it takes away from christianity too see you can impersonate anything but if it really falls in the word of god falls in the right kind of ground it's going to bring forth its kind it's got to because it's a seed noah moses his works express faith in the promise of the god that he believed pharaoh the man could see what was not he couldn't see how moses is going to do it but he knows moses believed what he was talking about or he wouldn't be standing in the palace out of the stick in his hand said by this stick i'll take him out from him an old man 80 years old not an athlete an old man stoop short and whiskers hanging down to his probably his waistline gray hair if he had any and there was that stick in his hand saying i'm gonna take him out let the people go thus saith the lord if you don't do it god's going to judge you amen why that's he was he afraid why just one arrow one spear anything else would have ended he was fearless you know exactly where he was standing the god smithy pharaoh yes sir for god told him you will come to this mountain again and he knows he was going there hallelujah we know where we're going to at the end of this journey god has promised there's a land beyond the river be fearless in your testimony amen if it's revealed to you are fearless you don't care for the whole world what they say you're fearless when it's revealed to you that this is the truth coming from god then you'll be fearless not you can't be david with a shepherd slain expressed to the whole israelite army the faith that he had in their god now there was goliath on the other side and he stood out there and made his voice many times bigger than david had fingers 14 inches long and he was a man with big fella the philistine shine and here was david the smallest one it was even too little to be any army too much of a run they couldn't use him so his brothers is out there in the army and then glath is making his boast but david now remember it was revealed to david he thought here is the armies of the living god standing in their own land and there's a boasting uncircumcised philistine out there we'll call him cancer tonight we're calling paralytic why david was no kind of a match for him not with any kind of a weapon he was no match that man's shoulders was probably 10 12 foot across is probably standing 14 15 foot high a spear like a weaver's needle probably 20 foot long the blade on it maybe four foot across and a little david stand there with a little piece of leather gold skin or sheepskin with two pieces of string tied to it but it was revealed to him revelation struck him amen he said the god that took me out of the paws of the bear that took me out of the paws of the line how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised philistine to my hand his brothers way more able to do it saul head and shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them amen there it is they believed it could be done they believe that god could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to david now there's a difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that god is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get i don't care what's wrong with you what the odds that may be worse than david and god but if it's revealed to you and notice when it's revealed david becomes fearless he said the day i'll cut your head off our god by grace in that crucial moment when decisions had to be made that same god that produced a grace in that day and dropped that seed of faith in that little hunchback looking boys being in his heart that same god in this crucial moment can take that woman from the wheelchair that man and a child [Music] that little greed of faith is revealed to you and i don't care how long it takes now notice the giant on the other side didn't believe it neither would the cancer elect you said to my dog you send that kid out here to fight me so i'll pick you up on the end of the spear and let the birds eat your flesh why he had all the everything for his son but you see that didn't shake david at all why it was revealed to him he had faith in what he was doing he knowed he was going to do it and he did it it's because that it was revealed to him and he knowed where he's standing and if god would respond right down in your heart tonight said you're not going to be laying in that bed you're not going to be setting that chair you're going to be well there couldn't be anything change your mind in it but until that happens every preacher in the world could pray i don't say it wouldn't help you it would encourage you but until that faith see the healing power is in you it don't come from the preacher it comes to you by revelation by faith not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord my spirit by grace reveals this to you and there's nothing to take it away by faith revelation then david to prove his works now some of them said i know you're naughty this brother said you come up here to see the battle now you get on back where them sheep was he said let me speak to saul the general and saul said now son i admire your courage but you see you're nothing but a youth and he is a warrior from his youth you're no match for him he said i was standing my father's sheep he could base it on something amen oh brother and the god that saved your soul can he heal your body but just the same revealed you he's your healer as he was your savior but it's got to be revealed first that's the difference he had something to base his faith on he said now this never happened before but said the same god that delivered me from the pause of the line will deliver me from that uncircumcised philistine how you know david i believe it why it's been revealed to me and he said all right another great thing we want to have settled it's a revelation you understand that and so we want to talk just about a little bit because we see that moses believed what god revealed to him and his works showed it the actions that he took expressed it and and brought it to pass and i i don't want to go down that road of talking about revelation and and talking about faith because we have such a tendency to try to muster up faith instead of just waiting on the lord you know i mean it's because it's the same faith at revelation that saved you is the same revelation that heals you so it's a revelation but i want to take a moment to take a paragraph and just give us a kind of an understanding on this great paragraph because i find so many christians come under condemnation when he speaks about these signs shall follow them that believe and we get to the place that we think that we have to have miracles all the time and i i just want to uh i just felt in my heart in closing this morning just to give a little example so you can just be anchored in your heart i thought brother randy did a nice job on touching this so i need a couple brothers you brothers come up here i love your beard brother do you put dye in it to get it black i don't know mine comes out gray all right so here's two great men here sitting here you guys stand and look at me right over here all right you stand right here and look at me okay who wants to be the believer okay you you you hesitated too long so for today you are going to play the role of an unbeliever now we get to the place that we think that we've got to produce miracles that if i'm a i'm a believer then i ought to have miracles if you listen to what we said moses was a believer and because he was a believer he delivered the message the message was go tell pharaoh to let my people go that was the gospel that moses received so moses just went and delivered the message that's what he did david knowing he was anointed king knowing that god had delivered the bear and the lion in his hand he delivered the message now we get to the place that we think that we have to have some power within us but we don't we just have to have a revelation of what we believe now listen what he says here until that happened every preacher in the world could pray i don't say it wouldn't help you it would encourage you but until that faith seek the healing power is in you it don't come from the preacher it comes to you by revelation by faith so we're commissioned to go in the world and preach the gospel in other words to tell people about eternal life we believe that we have a revelation for that now all i can do is give the opportunity christ gave them the opportunity to come to my feast the feast of pentecost which meant 50. in other words all you can do is present the opportunity but where is it the healing power is in you so here is a sorry brother you're just this is a fleshly representation but i know the seeds in there so here is an unbeliever right in our story now all i can do to that unbeliever is present to him the opportunity jesus is here if you will repent of your sins and realize you're wrong and repent and be baptized in any lord you guys you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit god sent us the word of god fresh manna in this day not an old gospel but fresh manna that's delivered to this day and i i i lay it out there to him and he rejects it he's not a believer there's no faith in him there's no revelation right so he just rejects it he says sorry old man you're little nuts so he just walks away you can go say that thank you brother he just walked away the same gospel now the the healing isn't in the preacher it's in you because the scripture says to them that believe not are damned them that believed are saved saved from drinking safe from smoking say from alcohol not only eternal life but they're saved for whatever they're in bondage in now i bring the same gospel to him so really all i'm doing is i'm i'm giving them the opportunity right the opportunity to believe that i'm giving him the chance or the choice to reject or receive because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god now what's going to compel me into action is the fact that i have a revelation i'm the believer in the word and the word says if i go carry out my commission and i go preach the word of god tell the truth tell how my candle got lit i'm fearless in my testimony i'm not ashamed that the world rejects this message i'm not ashamed that they we don't believe in the trinity i've had a revelation from god that this is absolutely the truth it's fresh manna therefore i'm standing in front of the mayor with my gospel stick now he's going to see my unbeliever saul i believe what i'm believing i proved to him that i believe what i believe by the very testimony that comes out of my mouth the very fact that i live eat and breathe it but now i come to this guy i give him the same gospel that i gave the unbeliever i share the same thing but he's a believer god gives him the what the revelation now he becomes the believer and the sign follows him not the preacher i like what randy is the mailman he opens the letter he's the believer these signs shall follow them that believe what i say to them and so he's a believer now whatever it is that he has needed he accepts the word of god because it's revealed to him and the sign follows him it's not attached to the preacher see healing power is in you it don't come from the preacher it comes to you by revelation so all you can do is give somebody the opportunity to hear if i don't see you tomorrow i'll see in the rapture okay because you're a believer okay god bless you and you'll be there too because he said all that i love then all that love me will be there so you're there too see when when we let our revelation of what's been revealed to us because remember he said the revelation won't always stay with the church in other words they come cold they come lukewarm they're not on fire this i remember when i first saw malachi 4 5 at the end time message man i just couldn't be still but he says what do they do they pull back and they denominate i believe in church order because the holy spirit does all things decently but church order never was the identification of the church the identification of the church was people that carried out the commission go into all the world if you're ashamed of me before men i'll be ashamed of you before my father you don't have to worry all you have is you've got your faith you have what's revealed to you and the gospel is spread from faith to faith from revelation to revelation i say the word he gets the revelation so it came from revelation to revelation if he believes he can receive what he has need of if i lay my hands on him because he's sick and he believes he'll get well if the power is in me then i should be able to lay my hands on the unbeliever and get the same results no my work is standing with the stick my work is standing with the sling my work is expressing the revelation moses was expressing the revelation that god gave him david was expressing the revelation that god told him we express the revelation that god's given us there was a message that was sent to restore us in a union with the bridegroom to become one and my duty is to give opportunity because the signs they follow the believer not the speaker they follow they hear because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god so we understand what's transpiring there's people that live a life worthy of the gospel david and moses lived a life and testified to their revelation it proved that they believed and others that don't lift a finger to do anything about it are identified as sympathizers and what our hearts desire is is to get every member of this local body on fire for god working for god sharing this gospel reaching out all you can do is tell somebody and if it awakens that seed within them they will have the signs to prove that they believe but let's not neglect our commission to go into all the world preaching the gospel them that believe shall be saved and them that believe not shall be damned go out baptizing them in the name of the father son and holy ghost not three titles not three names but the name of the three offices in which god manifested himself and those that believe shall receive the holy ghost and there are so many other things there that just keep rolling on but i think if we could get a fun kind of a fundamental understanding of the mark of the beast that fundamental revelation of what's going to transpire at the rapture and that fundamental duty that we have is believers to share now from that point all you have to do is deal with the excuses right we don't want any of those but we're going to baptize somebody now and so brother billy if you could come and lead and worship and who's going to be baptized where are you brother okay our brother's going to come and be baptized this morning and and he just feels on his heart and he called he wants to be baptized he knows it's the right thing to do and so if he's believing we know the sign that will follow he shall receive the holy ghost if you need to go this morning let's just stand for a moment we'll have a word of prayer and while we're standing if you need to slip out we certainly understand that this morning and we just say a word of prayer together our gracious heavenly father this morning we've just taken a moment to go into the storehouse and receive some real foundation teaching [Music] about how we express that we're worthy of the gospel how we understand that the gospel is the gift of eternal life the revelation of eternal life and who the signs follow them that believe and lord we need you so much in our lives and i believe that we're all here this morning wanting to break through the higher ground wanting to be about your business and we want to express the revelation that you've given us we don't want to be sympathizers we want to be workers we want to share the hope that we have in our lord jesus the hope of the rapture the hope of this by his stripes we are healed the hope of deliverance we want to share that that same jesus is alive and present the same yesterday today and forever father we call out for to our hearts and our our body here together father we all want to be about your business we all want to be more dedicated to you than we've ever been before we really want to become workers we want to be doers of the word and not hearers only father just stir in our hearts this morning by way of bible teaching by real revelation that we can look in the mirror and examine ourselves and we could ask ourselves what could i do for the kingdom of god lord speak to me i want to be of service we ask these things this morning in your precious name we pray amen god bless you this morning [Music] a [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh his faithful [Music] followers [Music] [Music] it seems [Music] ten [Music] [Music] me [Music] let me [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] forever [Music]

gospel is being spread amen in that he's still calling and if he's still calling he's still filling with the holy ghost and all men will struggle with the flesh until they get supernatural help from above and it's it's a hard battle to win it's like satan trying to cast out satan because we're born in sin and shaped in iniquity but when we receive that great help from the outside the holy spirit and then the holy spirit comes in and cleanses us from all unrighteousness and our brother today wants to be baptized in the name lord jesus christ he's seen it in god's word and by carrying out and being obedient to god's word he's privileged to receive the promise that follows and we believe that that sign will come to the believer it's not by the preacher it's by the believer and our brother believes so if we turn in our scriptures to acts the second chapter and the 36th verse the men have just come out and their lives were manifesting what was prophesied by joel the outpouring of the spirit and so because that was manifested in them they began to testify men and brethren these are not drunk as you suppose but this is what was promised and we see what followed so it's beautiful therefore let all of the house of israel knowed surely that god hath made the same jesus whom he have crucified both lord and christ and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as our lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up-torch generation brother john has come today to save himself from this world and for the remission of his sins which he has repented of he's going to be baptized and how many believe you'll receive the holy ghost amen i certainly do amen do you have the handkerchief okay our gracious heavenly father brother john has come to be baptized he heard your servant compel him to this pool and father we're just here to carry out the commission the lord we believe with our brother that by being baptized that your spirit will come into his life and give him the deliverances and the leadership that his heart desires brother john according to the gospel and the commission to go into the world baptizing them in the name of the father the son and holy ghost on the day of pentecost when the first baptisms were performed by divine revelation peter knew what that name was it was the lord jesus christ and according to the scriptures i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ hey man let's just stand and sing i will offer up my life as our dismissal this morning [Music] oh i will love her of my [Music] [Music] lord receive the sacrifice of a broken heart oh jesus what can i give [Music] what [Music] could not tell not even [Music] [Music] jesus what can i give you and what can i bring you're so faithful and friend and to
