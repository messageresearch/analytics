[44:46] speaking in English but I hope you bear
[44:48] with me if you don't mind I just want to
[44:50] turn to the scripture right away let's
[44:52] turn to a book of uh uh Second
[44:54] Corinthians
[44:56] [Music]
[44:57] chapter
[44:59] 11 2 Corinthians chapter
[45:16] 11 2 Corinthians chapter 11 let's read
[45:19] from uh verse
[45:22] one would to God he could bear with me a
[45:26] little in my Folly and indeed bear with
[45:29] me for I jealous over you with Godly
[45:32] jealousy for I have exposed you to one
[45:35] husbands that I may present you as a
[45:38] chaste version to Christ but I fear lest
[45:42] by any means as a serpent begal leave
[45:45] through his subtlety so your mind should
[45:48] be corrupt from the Simplicity that is
[45:52] in Christ amen may the Lord bless his
[45:55] word let's just bow our head one more
[45:57] time dear heavenly
[45:59] father as we have opened up the the
[46:02] scripture but Lord it take you to open
[46:05] up yourself because the whole Bible is
[46:08] talking about you so Lord if you don't
[46:11] open it we're just a scratching the
[46:13] surface Lord we probably can sing we
[46:16] probably can pray we probably can even
[46:18] preach and people can even believe but
[46:20] Lord if you don't open up yourself all
[46:23] this effort is going to be in vain so
[46:25] Lord I I pray that your Holy Spirit open
[46:28] up your word to US Open up not to our
[46:30] mind but to our heart to our soul that's
[46:33] a place that you dwell that's a place
[46:36] that a miracle would happen because that
[46:38] word life is going to Spring forth so
[46:40] Lord I pray you to take the whole
[46:42] service control that every spirit and in
[46:44] your hand no matter it's a spirit of
[46:46] Doubt or Spirit of unbelief or Spirit of
[46:49] sickness Lord I put that all under your
[46:52] control as your presence are coming down
[46:55] lord I pray that that your word heals
[46:56] your people and we ask it in Jesus name
[46:59] amen you may be
[47:15] seated and we all know God in this hour
[47:18] has sented the prophet to us uh I wonder
[47:22] sometime if we were sufficiently
[47:24] impressed by a messenger that God has
[47:27] sended to us I wonder sometime if we're
[47:29] in sufficiently impressed by the voice
[47:32] that we heard that in this last hour is
[47:35] this a human voice or there is a voice
[47:38] behind that voice is this a man's voice
[47:41] or is a supernatural voice that is
[47:43] speaking to us in this hour by the
[47:46] Vindication of the Prophet then in this
[47:48] hour by the ministry that have been
[47:50] Vindicated like none like no other has
[47:53] ever been Vindicated and sometimes if
[47:56] we're born in a message if we're RIS up
[47:58] in a message a lot of time I find out
[48:01] people uh people doesn't lost their Bel
[48:04] to the message but intensity to believe
[48:07] is start to diminishing the level of
[48:10] dedication the fervency the passion to
[48:13] the word of God seems Seems like it just
[48:16] cannot break the cycle from one
[48:18] generation to another generation start
[48:20] to diminishing but I believe if the word
[48:23] of God God sent it to us if we believe
[48:26] and we know this is the last age this is
[48:28] the last hour God required a certain
[48:31] dedication certain conservation like no
[48:35] others it doesn't take you go back to
[48:37] the world in order for you to elect your
[48:39] pastor but David has shared as a
[48:41] testimony to us many uh many times to
[48:44] you and to to us and we know how he came
[48:47] out from the world and when I met him
[48:50] when I heard him preaching I can see the
[48:53] intensity of it I can see the dedication
[48:55] of it for brother Tom and the same thing
[48:58] and that when he shared his testimon
[49:00] when he preached the word I can saw that
[49:02] at a ferv say that a passion that's in
[49:05] there and I can see this in myself I was
[49:07] from the world and raise it up in the
[49:10] world and coming over into the
[49:12] denomination and been confused all those
[49:16] years about when I hear the word I was
[49:19] cleared it up I know this is the god
[49:21] means for me I know this is the word not
[49:24] only because I know the word because I
[49:26] know the word has a change my
[49:28] life and I can see that even for Michael
[49:31] that he was a born and a raised up in in
[49:33] a message but I don't see the U the
[49:37] lethargy is that a word of lethargy at
[49:39] of it is I don't see the the lacking of
[49:43] the intensity of the belief when a
[49:45] person that come to believe the word to
[49:48] uh to know that the word is the truth
[49:50] and to dedicate it our life and I can
[49:53] see that but also I also win this as the
[49:56] time goes on as the coming of the Lord
[49:59] is seemingly like a uh delay which is
[50:02] not delay at at all but God has his long
[50:05] time but seemingly the intensity of the
[50:07] peoples that believe to the word of God
[50:10] you said how how intense I I I I need to
[50:13] be I want to ask how dedicated you are
[50:16] how surrendered in your life you are how
[50:18] consecrated are you give yourself to the
[50:20] word of God and that shows the intensity
[50:23] of your belief that shows the cons ation
[50:26] the tottal surrender of a whole being to
[50:28] the word of God in this hour it's not by
[50:30] talk it's not by speaking not by word
[50:33] not by letter but better dedication all
[50:35] right you want to see some fruit that's
[50:37] the fruit that we want to see and when
[50:40] you saw that you know that the person
[50:42] give himself to the word and you saw how
[50:45] the Lord wizard that and led to the life
[50:48] of of God to be reflected in that person
[50:51] but as a time goes on you'll find out
[50:55] and that type of uh intensity start to
[50:57] lower start to getting uh diminishing
[51:00] but Paul said over here said I'm jealous
[51:03] over you I was thinking what Paul is a
[51:05] jealous about he said I fear Les by any
[51:09] memes that means that there's a lot of
[51:12] memes that it can fulfill what Paul was
[51:15] feared about is that fear Les be any
[51:18] memes as a serpent begal Eve through
[51:22] this subtlty so your mind should be
[51:24] corrupted from
[51:26] Simplicity which is the
[51:28] singleness that is in
[51:30] Christ Simplicity that means the
[51:32] singleness sincerity honesty the virtue
[51:36] of a one who is afraid from a pretends
[51:38] and hypocrisy not self-seeking openness
[51:42] of heart and manifest itself of a
[51:45] generosity that is the Simplicity that
[51:48] Paul was seeking at his a fear that a
[51:51] serpent might be G and how this the
[51:54] serpent started
[51:57] is not started from Earth this old
[52:00] serpent Started From
[52:02] Heaven how his is began that's how Paul
[52:06] would Trace his the back you can be in
[52:10] um deceived or be lost of the singleness
[52:15] of the sincerity the honesty the
[52:18] singleness of mind to God by the
[52:21] deceived of
[52:23] Satan and how Satan start started Satan
[52:26] started from not Earth but started From
[52:29] Heaven he was a cast out from Heaven why
[52:33] he was a casted out from Heaven he was a
[52:36] casted out because of a
[52:38] jealousy what is this jealousy about he
[52:40] wanted better Kingdom that Michael had
[52:43] he got some own idea he had his own
[52:47] sermon that he want to preach he had his
[52:50] own idea about what the kingdom of God
[52:52] should be run he has his own idea de
[52:55] about opinion about what is the word of
[52:58] God should be
[53:00] interpreted let's dramatize a little bit
[53:04] one day Satan just walk into the church
[53:06] of a God not the denomination but in
[53:10] heaven because he's a song leader sorry
[53:14] it's not I'm not talking about
[53:16] that he's a worship leader because he's
[53:20] the head of all of them he had a beauty
[53:24] if we see he got a Charisma he got a
[53:28] personality that no angel will possess
[53:31] he got a something that a better than
[53:33] anybody else he haded something that he
[53:36] want to see he wanted something I have
[53:39] something want to say you Worship the
[53:42] Lord you Worship the Lord aren't you
[53:45] tired you hear your pastor and the
[53:49] Archangel that god Jehovah constantly
[53:52] preaching to you the same subject all
[53:54] the time
[53:55] aren't you
[53:57] tired you're sinning every day holy holy
[54:02] holy are you run out of a
[54:05] word is that the only thing that you can
[54:07] think about come on get something else
[54:10] get some pump in it get some beat in it
[54:14] get some idea in
[54:17] it then the Fall start is the jealousy
[54:22] of the
[54:23] devil that make can become a
[54:26] zealous that he want to pushes his idea
[54:29] forward right after all jealousy and the
[54:32] zealous is the same
[54:34] word and so in the separation from
[54:37] unbeliever Brother Brandman said in
[54:39] heaven what may Lucifer jealous he goes
[54:42] over and Anor and puts him up a better
[54:45] Kingdom he wanted at a bigger Kingdom
[54:48] more brighter better and
[54:51] prettier he thought he got some B better
[54:54] idea
[54:55] he s he get a some better opinion and
[54:59] possess some
[55:01] equality I possess the quality that god
[55:04] Jehovah
[55:05] had why I have to be a secondary
[55:09] position why my idea doesn't get a push
[55:12] it through why I'm just become just a
[55:15] leading little worship why we have to be
[55:18] single-minded in one thing that what is
[55:20] the God has said isn't that sounds like
[55:23] we're in this age
[55:25] you know I heard to the people that even
[55:27] in a different area they said well we we
[55:29] need an eighth
[55:30] messenger seven is a good number but eth
[55:33] is even
[55:34] better they said we got some we need
[55:37] some new idea about this they don't say
[55:39] it but their way that action proves
[55:42] their thought is some louder than their
[55:45] voice can
[55:46] pronounce and their way of their action
[55:49] the things that we do instead of seeking
[55:51] single-minded for God sent out the
[55:53] prophet the message that be Vindicated
[55:55] in this hour through and through there
[55:57] no other Vindication they're tired and
[56:00] sick and tired with the Simplicity of
[56:02] this
[56:04] message because they don't have a faith
[56:07] to make it a work they want to make it a
[56:10] word of a god become more
[56:12] fancier because they don't have the
[56:14] Revel they're not to change the 1200
[56:17] message but they change their
[56:19] interpretation with their life about
[56:22] this
[56:23] messag
[56:27] that same spirit in heaven be cast it
[56:29] down to the Earth never die and they
[56:33] probably thinking why you have to
[56:34] uplifting this uh the Michael the god
[56:38] that all the time I want to go up to the
[56:41] north to set up on my own Throne to set
[56:45] up my own people to set up on my own
[56:48] idea I can make this work just as much
[56:51] as God can make it a work but God make
[56:54] it a work better Simplicity to believe
[56:57] his word the devil have a many thousands
[57:00] of a way to make the word seemingly work
[57:04] just as the same as what God make he can
[57:07] still get of the blessing he can still
[57:10] get to a miracle he can still by
[57:13] Believing by gift and by whatever can
[57:16] make the healing happen can go do all of
[57:18] that seemingly on the outskirt on the
[57:21] out surface just as much as the real
[57:24] believer is that but a cord of it is the
[57:28] Satan's spirit it's all started from the
[57:32] jealousy that he
[57:34] had and brother BR said he become the
[57:36] first one that had a Jealousy on Earth
[57:40] how he coming into the serpent and then
[57:44] from The Serpent and he passes his idea
[57:47] to Eve then that Eve give to the two two
[57:51] uh two child and that abble and kin and
[57:54] you find out that that spirit will never
[57:56] die and that happens unin he said now
[58:00] where did that jealousy come from he
[58:02] said where did that a murder come from
[58:05] where did all that kind of spirit of
[58:07] come from and out of Adam couldn't have
[58:11] come from Satan it's exactly where did
[58:14] he come from right and said now we find
[58:16] out he was the first murderer King and
[58:19] he was the first one to have a jealousy
[58:22] and Lucifer got the jealous of a Michael
[58:24] brought it right down to the Earth and
[58:26] transferred it into man and said Kim by
[58:30] taking on this evil took the first Mark
[58:33] God marked him no one was to kill him
[58:36] let let him alone but you remember soon
[58:39] as he marked him he went out from the
[58:41] presence of God when the jealousy
[58:43] started taking a hold of the the people
[58:46] that the person then it started went out
[58:48] from the presence of God they started
[58:50] having something of their own and they
[58:53] married a wife and the started a career
[58:56] and started the business and just a
[59:00] leave of the daily life but you see is
[59:02] because of the jealousy he want to have
[59:05] put his own idea what is his own idea to
[59:08] be pushed to force and that caus it all
[59:10] this fall as it happened but jealous it
[59:13] doesn't want to just to stay alone as a
[59:17] jealous do you find that that people
[59:19] they had a jealous usually they don't
[59:22] show it's all hide at a very deep please
[59:26] don't be quiet you make me thinking you
[59:27] have a
[59:31] jealous usually they hide it it very
[59:35] deep and they just try to use all
[59:37] different kind of a way try to make
[59:40] their idea more presentable and then
[59:44] people can see and when people have a
[59:46] jealous they will never stay alone just
[59:49] have a jealous because a jealous
[59:52] progress it will become a zealous
[59:55] but on the wrong way so when a person
[59:58] become a jealous you look at it this
[1:00:01] world it's a fall of
[1:00:02] them and why people you go on an
[1:00:06] Instagram if this person got a got go
[1:00:09] for a vacation they put all kinds of a
[1:00:11] poster on it and the other person just
[1:00:13] cannot handle it
[1:00:15] anymore you go Mexico I'm going to go to
[1:00:20] Hawaii nobody come to Texas though you
[1:00:24] do this I have to do that and then
[1:00:26] polish up their face almost you cannot
[1:00:29] recognize them and they had to beautify
[1:00:32] the filter to put a some many filtered
[1:00:34] on and when you look at is that who is
[1:00:37] that I remember one time with my
[1:00:41] wife and a one one girl that we used to
[1:00:44] know and uh and she was uh she came to
[1:00:47] my wife she said oh he said uh sister
[1:00:49] Tracy she said you know this is my uh
[1:00:52] graduation uh picture we got all all the
[1:00:54] students my wife's look at that and the
[1:00:57] girl said can you find me and said in on
[1:01:00] the phone my wife looking look she said
[1:01:03] where and she pointed she said that my
[1:01:06] wife said is that
[1:01:08] you they've been filter that so much you
[1:01:11] couldn't even recognize them well just
[1:01:14] because of this feel you know I don't
[1:01:15] look good I I I must be look as a
[1:01:18] certain certain star I must to be look
[1:01:20] at a have a fashion around like a
[1:01:23] certain certain people
[1:01:27] jealousy something hid it to deep it in
[1:01:29] there it just cannot handle somebody is
[1:01:32] look better than them they just cannot
[1:01:34] handle somebody can speak better than
[1:01:36] them they just can't handle somebody
[1:01:38] just have a nicer than them and they use
[1:01:41] all kinds of a way try to manipulate
[1:01:44] that so that it can getting better upper
[1:01:47] hand right but jealous making a person
[1:01:51] become a zealous and that's what a kin
[1:01:53] does
[1:01:55] and that's what he got inherited from
[1:01:57] his father when Devil's got a jealous he
[1:01:59] become a zealous and he want a zealous
[1:02:02] about his own program you find out that
[1:02:05] K when he was to become a jealous he
[1:02:07] become a zealous that jealousy will come
[1:02:10] into another the point they become a
[1:02:11] driven power that push it in him they
[1:02:14] becom so zealous that it wouldn't want
[1:02:17] God's idea he wouldn't want anybody can
[1:02:20] give him the uh give him a correction or
[1:02:22] give him instruction and even that voice
[1:02:26] was raise it up though there was a
[1:02:28] silent voice but that's a powerful voice
[1:02:31] because Abel got a revelation when Abel
[1:02:34] got a revelation though he doesn't speak
[1:02:36] one word it doesn't recall Abel got one
[1:02:40] word that had any talk with God but
[1:02:42] having many talk many words that again
[1:02:44] has a talk with God but when Abel when
[1:02:47] something was coming upon
[1:02:50] him and it's not his mom his daddy
[1:02:53] taught him and about it but he got a
[1:02:56] revelation it's not Apple because they
[1:02:59] under the old they're in they go through
[1:03:01] the same family they under the same
[1:03:03] tutorship of their mother and the father
[1:03:06] if they just by the tutorship they just
[1:03:07] by the teaching if they just by the the
[1:03:10] book on the Shelf if Justus about the
[1:03:12] teaching you this the teaching that try
[1:03:14] to reform a person and they should be on
[1:03:16] to the same level but thank God that
[1:03:19] Abel was on another level because God
[1:03:22] revealed attitude to him yeah it's not
[1:03:25] as a mom and daddy taught him young
[1:03:27] people it's not your mom and dad try to
[1:03:29] taught you taught you the message you
[1:03:33] must have a personal revelation from the
[1:03:36] Lord when you get a connected with him
[1:03:39] he become real to you then you become a
[1:03:41] consecrated then you become a
[1:03:43] sacrificial then you become a surrender
[1:03:46] s to him then you don't care what other
[1:03:49] people said you can sacrifice your whole
[1:03:52] life on the altar die is
[1:03:57] it
[1:04:00] Hallelujah but that jealousy become such
[1:04:03] a zealous power all right that a driven
[1:04:06] can he said if I can't if God can't
[1:04:10] receive my sacrifice as an apple or as a
[1:04:13] vegetables or
[1:04:16] flour I'm going to hush that voice The
[1:04:19] Voice are from the
[1:04:21] Revelation doesn't the Bible said that
[1:04:24] by Fai that Abel presented an offer to
[1:04:27] God and better than Ken has get by it
[1:04:32] and though he died yet he still speaking
[1:04:35] faith is a revelation Hallelujah without
[1:04:38] a revelation how you can get a faith
[1:04:40] without God himself a revealed to you
[1:04:42] how can you have a faith how can you
[1:04:44] give your life how can you surrender a
[1:04:46] whole being without a no reservation
[1:04:49] give your whole being to him not a one
[1:04:52] Speck of left in you that you're not
[1:04:54] giving to him and you're ready to die
[1:04:57] for the Revelation that the Lord had
[1:04:59] give it to you as Abel did that's was
[1:05:02] abble did but
[1:05:03] can that jealousy become of such a
[1:05:06] driven power to him that drive him and
[1:05:09] one day and he hes The Voice he killed
[1:05:13] his brother but you know what when the
[1:05:16] voice what is to become a
[1:05:19] revelation he had a voice that's come
[1:05:21] with it though he died
[1:05:24] but the the person the physical person
[1:05:27] it's died but the voice of a revelation
[1:05:30] never died it goes before God no matter
[1:05:34] how that they try to kill them they try
[1:05:38] to uh uh try to do everything they can
[1:05:41] doesn't have to be to kill physically
[1:05:43] and the people that they can kill that
[1:05:45] the person's of their
[1:05:47] reputation like the people in this earth
[1:05:51] that they try to do to the message and
[1:05:53] they try to uh degrade this message they
[1:05:56] try to uh said this message is wrong
[1:05:58] they try to find the fault that in the
[1:06:01] prophet and in the messenger they do
[1:06:04] everything they can but when that
[1:06:06] Revelation become a real that voice can
[1:06:09] never be killed and when you receive
[1:06:12] that voice into you not as a voice but
[1:06:15] as a voice that it didn't hear when God
[1:06:17] revealed to you though you die the
[1:06:20] Revelation voice will never
[1:06:22] die you Mom and said when you believe
[1:06:25] for your children sir it's not just by
[1:06:27] some teaching but by faith to the word
[1:06:30] of God believe under Jesus Christ that
[1:06:33] you and your house shall be saved when
[1:06:35] God make that it become a personal to
[1:06:37] you become a revelation to you though
[1:06:39] you die but that voice of revelation
[1:06:42] will never die and he will go before the
[1:06:44] Lord Lord will hear that that he will
[1:06:47] answer your
[1:06:51] prayer because thy voice can never be
[1:07:12] hared how many time you
[1:07:20] have till they all fell asleep
[1:07:24] when you fall in sleep I
[1:07:32] quit that voice of a revelation can
[1:07:35] never be
[1:07:37] hushed no matter is it from the outside
[1:07:40] or from the
[1:07:42] inside because that is from a revealed
[1:07:46] word and outside the devil we try to use
[1:07:49] a work we try to use a career we're try
[1:07:52] to use a beauty we try to use everything
[1:07:55] try to hush that voice but when you
[1:07:57] receive that when you're born again when
[1:08:01] it become a revelation to you is that
[1:08:04] something that is taught that voice can
[1:08:06] never be
[1:08:08] hushed on inside it can never be hushed
[1:08:11] it
[1:08:12] either your own mistake cannot hush that
[1:08:17] voice of Revelation your wrongdoing
[1:08:20] cannot hush that Revelation voice you're
[1:08:24] falling you're stumbling can that you
[1:08:27] said I made so many mistakes I done so
[1:08:29] many wrong but there's another voice
[1:08:31] inside our voice though you fall though
[1:08:34] you made a mistake though you
[1:08:37] weak but even yourself canot hares that
[1:08:40] voice because that voice is the voice of
[1:08:43] a
[1:08:44] revelation he will always Len it
[1:08:48] up because when God change you he's not
[1:08:51] just to change your mind he change your
[1:08:54] soul there's a predestinated aen in
[1:08:57] there so God has to reveal himself to
[1:09:00] you while you reveal himself to you to
[1:09:03] that Soul even when you fall even when
[1:09:06] you stumble even when you made a mistake
[1:09:09] but there was always the voice of a
[1:09:11] revealed word coming forth that Lord
[1:09:13] forgive
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:22] me
[1:09:27] you one over the message at a private
[1:09:29] interview brother brma talked
[1:09:31] to Sister Bruce many of you probably
[1:09:35] heard that that's the one message very
[1:09:37] short only a few minutes just before the
[1:09:40] Masterpiece and the sister Bruce has
[1:09:42] said to brother brand said to brother
[1:09:44] brand I made so many mistakes I've done
[1:09:47] so many wrong probably that's the same
[1:09:49] feeling that we feel I said so many
[1:09:52] things I shouldn't say I've done so many
[1:09:54] things I shouldn't
[1:09:56] do look at it what does the prophet say
[1:09:59] he said we got a blood sacrifice L
[1:10:02] there God don't even see it
[1:10:05] us he hears our voice he still hear you
[1:10:10] it's your voice it's your voice when you
[1:10:13] pray it's not a Jesus voice that has to
[1:10:15] pray it's your voice that is a pray is
[1:10:19] your voice when you say the cursed word
[1:10:21] to somebody else is your voice is to say
[1:10:24] the things that you shouldn't say that's
[1:10:26] the steal your voice said I never say in
[1:10:27] my mouth your thought is louder in
[1:10:30] heaven than on the
[1:10:33] earth that voice is your voice you can't
[1:10:35] deny
[1:10:36] it then he said he hear our voice but he
[1:10:40] sees the blood of Jesus
[1:10:43] Christ when we saw
[1:10:46] Roar connected
[1:10:48] with
[1:10:50] judgment when we saw we didn't made made
[1:10:53] a mistake connected with judgment from
[1:10:57] God lord vote unto me I done something
[1:11:00] wrong what am what I'm going to I'm
[1:11:02] going to miss the rapture we associate
[1:11:05] our wrongdoing with the legal side out
[1:11:08] of it but when you receive the voice of
[1:11:10] a revelation there's a blood still
[1:11:14] speaking loses your voice but in behind
[1:11:18] that voice there's a different life
[1:11:20] there's a different blood it's not a b c
[1:11:23] d oh but that blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:11:26] life of God living inside of you even
[1:11:29] before you have that life that see life
[1:11:32] already living inside of you but when
[1:11:34] you born again he wasn't manifested it
[1:11:37] out there's a blood Ste standing between
[1:11:41] you and God if there's no blood your
[1:11:43] voice will go before
[1:11:45] God no matter how righteous you are your
[1:11:48] voice is going to go before that and you
[1:11:50] are your voice and you are you said I
[1:11:52] live a holy life but your voice going to
[1:11:54] go before God without the blood your
[1:11:57] Holiness just like a rag without that
[1:12:00] blood judgment going to fall no matter
[1:12:02] how holy you are but with that blood in
[1:12:05] front of you there's a voice behind that
[1:12:08] voice when the voice of the human said I
[1:12:11] done wrong but when your voice that
[1:12:14] behind that voice said Lord I'm done
[1:12:17] wrong forgive me for that and that voice
[1:12:20] would Dr that voice that you done wrong
[1:12:23] put it in into the bleach and in the
[1:12:25] blood of Jesus Christ then there's
[1:12:27] another voice to come out Lord forgive
[1:12:33] them he
[1:12:36] sees the blood of a
[1:12:39] Christ that's it see he sees the blood
[1:12:43] of his own
[1:12:44] son is our voice I cannot deny that I
[1:12:49] done wrong that voice is go but it
[1:12:52] cannot filtered out out the blood of
[1:12:55] Jesus Christ is said then it's is said
[1:13:00] it's our voice but it's a Christ's blood
[1:13:04] then is a Christ that's talk through us
[1:13:08] to God so therefore we're no sinner no
[1:13:15] more how marvelous that is aren't you
[1:13:18] thankful to the bleeding bloody word
[1:13:21] that the Lord had given to us when you
[1:13:24] receive that voice you literally receive
[1:13:26] the life of Jesus Christ you receive
[1:13:28] that blood and now it's not your voice
[1:13:31] but that voice was speaking through you
[1:13:34] though you as filthy as you can be
[1:13:36] though you made a mistake as much as you
[1:13:38] can be but there is another voice behind
[1:13:41] that any human voice the wrong voice the
[1:13:44] wrong things that we do the wrong
[1:13:45] thought that we have but drop it into
[1:13:47] the blood of Jesus Christ then there is
[1:13:50] another voice and instead of our voice
[1:13:53] come com before God then God Associated
[1:13:56] your mistake to forgiveness then
[1:14:00] forgiveness to righteousness that
[1:14:02] righteousness means not you are forgiven
[1:14:05] but you never sin in the first
[1:14:11] place let me continue
[1:14:18] on we saw the
[1:14:21] jealousy that has uh
[1:14:24] negative a part of it but we know that
[1:14:27] anything that is uh what is on what is a
[1:14:31] negative there is a positive side of it
[1:14:34] devil is only the impersonator he can
[1:14:37] only impersonate there's nothing
[1:14:39] original about
[1:14:42] him everything he was just
[1:14:45] copy
[1:14:47] but there is a tress of another side of
[1:14:51] the jealousy God said my name is
[1:14:56] jealousy in the book of Exodus chapter
[1:14:59] 34 it said for Thou shalt worship no
[1:15:01] other God for the Lord whose name is
[1:15:05] jealous is a jealous
[1:15:07] God he is an original jealous
[1:15:12] God but when jealous come as I said a
[1:15:17] jealous also means
[1:15:20] zealous if there was the right jealous
[1:15:23] then it become a Force it would driven a
[1:15:27] person that he become a very zealous and
[1:15:31] when you are you jealous about your
[1:15:35] wife you
[1:15:37] should if any man can flirt with your
[1:15:39] wife you say Ah that's
[1:15:42] fine you're not much out of a husband
[1:15:44] you don't love her if you do love her
[1:15:47] you're jealous for her yes and that
[1:15:49] jealousy become a
[1:15:51] zealous some man can touch my wife I was

[1:15:55] AAL love

[1:16:16] a jealousy and the zealous about it to
[1:16:20] believe God you must be jealous about
[1:16:23] what your God is doing he's the only one
[1:16:25] that you believe he's the only one you
[1:16:28] dedicate your life brother bman said if
[1:16:30] your life is not centered around Jesus
[1:16:32] Christ if he is not in a preeminence in
[1:16:34] your life he said remember you don't
[1:16:37] have the Holy
[1:16:41] Ghost if you have a holy spirit holy
[1:16:44] spirit is a jealous he jealous about you

[1:17:05] his zealous are about you because they
[1:17:08] love you that love is a love of a
[1:17:14] jealousy in book of a
[1:17:18] number I just want to save some time so
[1:17:21] you don't have to turn to it in chapter
[1:17:23] uh 5 and
[1:17:25] 12 he said speaking unto the children of
[1:17:27] Israel say unto them if any man's wife
[1:17:31] got aside go aside and commit trespass
[1:17:35] against him that means that his wife
[1:17:37] commit
[1:17:38] adultery doing something uh behind her
[1:17:43] husband and the number said and a man
[1:17:46] lie with her carnally and he be hide hid
[1:17:51] from the eyes of her husband that means
[1:17:53] her husbands didn't cut her and to be
[1:17:57] kept close he keep it very secret and
[1:18:00] nobody
[1:18:01] knows and she' be defiled but in reality
[1:18:05] she was defiled because she betrayed her
[1:18:07] marriage vow and there be no witness
[1:18:11] against her what does that mean on the
[1:18:13] outside you can't see it no
[1:18:16] witness she done is very
[1:18:19] sacredly and neither should be taken
[1:18:22] with the matter
[1:18:23] nobody find him on the spot find her on
[1:18:26] the spot of what she
[1:18:32] did this is talked
[1:18:35] about that a woman or we see there's a
[1:18:39] wife that had a
[1:18:42] husband she only got one
[1:18:45] husband but somehow she lost the
[1:18:49] singleness the Simplicity the loyalty
[1:18:53] that to her
[1:18:54] husband and she didn't get it
[1:18:57] caught she still goes to
[1:19:01] church she's still reading her Bible
[1:19:04] come on she's still cooking dinner for
[1:19:07] her
[1:19:08] husband she still say
[1:19:13] hallelujah she do everything just like
[1:19:18] the normal wife that
[1:19:20] do if I was say should we just bride
[1:19:24] still the bride the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:19:27] she still do
[1:19:28] everything that a Believer supposed to
[1:19:31] do she come to the church she paying her
[1:19:36] ties she reading the scripture reading
[1:19:39] the message listening the once a while
[1:19:42] and can talk a message believer talk can
[1:19:45] go fellowship with the
[1:19:48] believer but you know what her husband
[1:19:51] just found something
[1:19:53] something wrong
[1:19:55] somewhere I could not have pinpointed
[1:19:58] it but I failed
[1:20:00] it she used to love me very
[1:20:05] much when her husband to the word
[1:20:08] speaking tears run down her
[1:20:12] eye but
[1:20:14] she just recently the husband said I
[1:20:18] don't see that tear
[1:20:21] anymore she used to be when they talking
[1:20:24] about a word her eyes was lock into
[1:20:28] it but just
[1:20:30] recently I can see that a thousand yard
[1:20:35] stair she coming to the church she's
[1:20:38] sitting at the same Pew that she always
[1:20:41] sit but when the pastor or sorry the
[1:20:45] husband say something really harsh she's
[1:20:49] just pretending she's making
[1:20:51] notes she
[1:20:54] wouldn't straight eye eye to eye to her
[1:20:57] husband anymore her husband is a very
[1:21:01] sensitive and she said what's wrong with
[1:21:04] her she's not as she used to
[1:21:07] be and someday her husband had going
[1:21:09] home and quickly she put something
[1:21:12] behind
[1:21:14] her her husband look at that just got a
[1:21:17] little start on honey what you
[1:21:21] reading
[1:21:24] oh oh it's fine nothing just you know
[1:21:27] somebody wrote some
[1:21:29] romance article or something talk about
[1:21:32] love or this and that you know it would
[1:21:34] be better for our marriage
[1:21:36] life and a husband who doesn't say
[1:21:39] anything let her go but in the private
[1:21:41] time the husband started thinking
[1:21:43] something wrong somewhere she's not like
[1:21:46] what she used to
[1:21:51] be she still do her duty to her
[1:21:56] husband still every day say oh oh honey
[1:22:00] I love
[1:22:01] you but there's no feeling in
[1:22:04] it there's no dedication in it and her
[1:22:09] husband started to feel the
[1:22:13] deadness and she used to be very
[1:22:17] outspoken talk about the word of a God
[1:22:20] but a word of a God in their family
[1:22:22] become
[1:22:25] rare even talking about it it seems as
[1:22:29] there is no Warmness that she that he
[1:22:33] always felt it it
[1:22:37] before and on the surface as the
[1:22:40] scripture said you cannot say anything
[1:22:42] wrong about her she's still dressed long
[1:22:46] skirt she still has her long hair and
[1:22:50] she's doing everything just like every
[1:22:52] everybody else as the Believers is
[1:22:55] doing but her husband is very sensitive
[1:22:58] a
[1:22:59] husband and he start to find during the
[1:23:02] service she used to say Amen all the
[1:23:04] time but she do say that anymore she
[1:23:07] used to live up their hands when he
[1:23:10] speaking about Lord Jesus and then the
[1:23:12] tear run down and sometimes she even run
[1:23:15] she even run out of her seat and go on
[1:23:19] start worshiping the Lord but now
[1:23:23] her husband doesn't see that
[1:23:26] anymore and her husband saw her she
[1:23:29] spent more time on a CNN the Fox
[1:23:33] News than a message of this hour she
[1:23:37] spend more time on shopping online
[1:23:40] shopping or Instagram or Facebook or
[1:23:43] this and that she spend more time on
[1:23:46] that and sometime her husband try to
[1:23:48] rebuke her that about and she give that
[1:23:51] a staring eye to her
[1:23:54] husband of course right away she oh no I
[1:23:57] shouldn't do that but in the inside of
[1:24:00] the inside something went wrong her
[1:24:03] husband realized something different and
[1:24:06] her husband start to seeing she go to
[1:24:09] the shower all the
[1:24:13] time one shower is enough two shower is
[1:24:18] extra but when he saw her going to the
[1:24:21] shower three four times a
[1:24:23] day her husband said something goes
[1:24:26] wrong
[1:24:28] here let's turn to the camera to this a
[1:24:31] little lady
[1:24:33] here I can see that her tears start
[1:24:35] running down when she taking
[1:24:37] shower oh God I lost my first
[1:24:43] love oh

[1:26:18] clean she needed something way powerful
[1:26:22] than a Baptist scrub than a Methodist
[1:26:27] scrub she needed something
[1:26:30] else and she couldn't do it no matter
[1:26:33] how she
[1:26:34] tried am I talking about
[1:26:42] you and the next verse of 5 and 14 it
[1:26:45] said and a spirit of a
[1:26:47] jealousy come upon him that is her
[1:26:51] husband
[1:26:53] and he be jealous of as his wife and she
[1:26:56] be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy
[1:26:59] come upon him and he be jealous of his
[1:27:01] wife and should be not
[1:27:04] defiled is that how much this woman
[1:27:07] tried to get read of the defilement that
[1:27:09] she
[1:27:10] had the job is laid in her
[1:27:15] husband the Bible said that the spirit
[1:27:17] of jealousy was upon
[1:27:20] him no matter how she tried but no
[1:27:24] matter how tried how many times today
[1:27:27] she tried to be clean she tried to be
[1:27:30] holy she tried to get rid of the the
[1:27:32] guilty feeling the condemnation but it
[1:27:35] doesn't l in her she cannot do it but he
[1:27:39] take that her husband who the spirit of
[1:27:42] jealousy upon him it's not that the
[1:27:45] spirit of jealousy upon her but it's a
[1:27:49] spirit upon spirit of jealousy upon upon
[1:27:52] her husband when her husband saw there's
[1:27:56] a need is her husband must become under
[1:28:00] the sin to do the rescue is her husband
[1:28:03] must be on the sin to do the Redemption
[1:28:07] work the church there's a church church
[1:28:10] church and they try to give this
[1:28:12] psychology they try to use this method
[1:28:15] but never going to work until God the
[1:28:17] hos are coming
[1:28:20] down it takes him
[1:28:23] yes to do the Redemption
[1:28:29] work it take him to be a personal God
[1:28:34] that to the people he take it himself
[1:28:37] not just to teaching his bride how to
[1:28:40] behave herself how to do this how to do
[1:28:42] that he taking him coming down as the
[1:28:46] hasip because as a husband he is the
[1:28:49] head if he's the head he must have take
[1:28:52] take the
[1:28:53] responsibility no other can take the
[1:28:56] responsibility the wife cannot take the
[1:28:59] responsibility but a husand must have
[1:29:01] taken a
[1:29:07] responsibility is in this last
[1:29:10] hour what we have to the message is God
[1:29:14] himself coming there when all the ages
[1:29:19] go to the age after age from the
[1:29:22] age from the epan age the per age the
[1:29:26] Philadelphia Age come to the Le age all
[1:29:29] age has been defiled and all the all
[1:29:33] those in this age those churches are
[1:29:36] denominated they only got a portion of
[1:29:38] the word and then it denominated on the
[1:29:41] justification then it denominated on the
[1:29:44] sanctification then it denominated on
[1:29:46] the gift of the Holy Ghost but in the
[1:29:48] last hour God said I'm going to come in
[1:29:51] down
[1:29:53] H there's no other cure there's no other
[1:29:56] remedy but a husband himself must have
[1:29:59] coming
[1:30:00] down I'm thinking about in all this age
[1:30:04] God sent to John said go write a letter
[1:30:09] to the angel of the Church of epici go
[1:30:14] write a letter to the Church of sardan
[1:30:18] go write a letter to the angel of the
[1:30:21] church of a Philadelphia go write a
[1:30:24] letter to the angel of the Church of the
[1:30:27] leod deia but when he come to the last
[1:30:31] hour but when he called the bride out of
[1:30:34] the Le DEA as the brother said this is
[1:30:38] the bright age and in the Book of
[1:30:40] Revelation chapter 10 and seven it said
[1:30:43] in the days of the voice of the seven
[1:30:46] messenger the seventh angel he said I
[1:30:50] will come down and speak to them in all
[1:30:53] this age it's just writing a letter
[1:30:56] writing a letter and writing a letter
[1:30:58] but when it come to the last of the age
[1:31:01] they said JN don't write a letter
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:08] anymore oh yes
[1:31:13] Lord it said I saw another Mighty angel
[1:31:18] coming down from heaven closed the with
[1:31:21] of cloud and a rimo is upon his head and
[1:31:25] is a face as a wore the Sun and is a
[1:31:28] feet as a pillar of fire and he had in
[1:31:31] his book in his hand a little book open
[1:31:35] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:31:38] and it's a left foot on the earth and it
[1:31:40] cried with a loud voice as one a lion
[1:31:44] roarers when Lon roarers All Things
[1:31:48] become silent when lion roar bucks even
[1:31:52] become silent they keep quiet we only
[1:31:55] got a white Ro in this day that is the
[1:31:58] message of this
[1:31:59] hour the line of a tribe of Judah has a
[1:32:03] coming down when he wor all the
[1:32:05] denomination voice ceased
[1:32:09] Hallelujah said when the line War when
[1:32:12] he had cried seven Thunder utters their
[1:32:19] voices all the Mist
[1:32:22] there the end that Thunder the first
[1:32:25] seal the second seal until the seven all
[1:32:28] the seal that was secret the S mystery
[1:32:31] is all revealed in the
[1:32:34] Thunders and when the s a voice I was
[1:32:38] about to
[1:32:40] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:32:43] saying unto me think about it John had
[1:32:47] to write all this letter to the first
[1:32:50] age second age
[1:32:52] third fourth fifth sixth seventh when
[1:32:56] all their Church ages is over but
[1:32:59] there's a bride age there's a calling
[1:33:02] out of the bride and John heard Thunders
[1:33:06] roaring seals opening Christ is the
[1:33:09] mystery of a God is revealed a token is
[1:33:12] there the things that are to be there
[1:33:14] John have never saw something like that
[1:33:17] he heard that the thers Roaring and he
[1:33:19] about to Rite that The Voice I said
[1:33:22] doing
[1:33:24] right he said sealed it
[1:33:27] up seal those things which the seven son
[1:33:30] Des Ed and Rise them not oh I was
[1:33:34] thinking John was thinking Lord this is
[1:33:39] every mystery is going to be revealed
[1:33:42] this is everything Lord I wrote the
[1:33:44] letter to all the churches why not this
[1:33:47] and John saw all what we are reading at
[1:33:51] today John saw all that God has revealed
[1:33:56] and it was about to write but the Lord
[1:33:59] said seal it
[1:34:01] up John you have done your
[1:34:05] part but this is my part to
[1:34:08] do you don't need to write anymore you
[1:34:11] don't need to write a letter to the
[1:34:12] church agents anymore they're all going
[1:34:14] to be denominated but in the last hour
[1:34:17] is that I'm going to com in
[1:34:20] down I'm going to coming down reveal my
[1:34:23] own self to the seventh messenger in the
[1:34:27] day of the voice of the seven message
[1:34:30] time shall be no more I will come
[1:34:33] down there's no need to write a letter
[1:34:36] anymore that denominated in the letter
[1:34:38] the letter kills but the spirit will
[1:34:41] make them
[1:34:43] live I said don't write it this is a
[1:34:46] man's
[1:34:49] job and I'm going to come in there
[1:34:52] in the day of the voice of Seven's Angel
[1:34:56] he said I'm going to coming down to
[1:34:58] reveal my own self who can he reveal but
[1:35:02] to his own
[1:35:04] bride and then you can take the book and
[1:35:08] then you can e the book and then you can
[1:35:12] prophesy that
[1:35:20] again because in the last of age in the
[1:35:23] last of time is a headship coming
[1:35:26] back is a husband coming back the bride
[1:35:30] has been defiled they've been
[1:35:33] denominated from a church to church
[1:35:35] church church bride bride bride bride
[1:35:37] but there must be a true one there must
[1:35:40] be a real one it's not in their own
[1:35:43] Holiness but in my righteousness I'm
[1:35:46] going to make them holy I'm going to
[1:35:48] make them righteous I'm going to clean
[1:35:50] them up
[1:36:00] God had forbidden John to write all of
[1:36:03] them but it reveal and his allation to
[1:36:06] tell us your headship is coming back to
[1:36:11] be United with is bride body because as
[1:36:15] the headship is taking the
[1:36:18] responsibility is it a headship to claim
[1:36:21] her up is her husband to do all the
[1:36:24] Redemption
[1:36:28] work I thinking about it in the book of
[1:36:32] Hosea the Lord ask Hosea said to marry a
[1:36:37] whoredom to take
[1:36:40] her how many heads of this whoredom has
[1:36:43] had how many head of is a harlot has
[1:36:46] already had he got all kinds of seed at
[1:36:48] the inside of her and she got all kind
[1:36:51] kind of head that is supposed to be her
[1:36:53] head but none of them is her head the
[1:36:56] Lord tell the prophet of Hosea said you
[1:36:59] go marry
[1:37:01] her you become her head you lead her not
[1:37:06] that all kinds of a men's idea to
[1:37:08] Leading her but you Prophet will be my
[1:37:11] representative and you bring that
[1:37:13] headship back to that
[1:37:15] woman and she's under a new headship
[1:37:19] because she's under a new headship all
[1:37:21] her past can be right it off all her G
[1:37:26] it doesn't matter she was a prostitute
[1:37:28] or hard but her headship changed it's
[1:37:32] not a denomination church headship not a
[1:37:35] man's idea headship but God himself
[1:37:38] through the prophet messenger become her
[1:37:43] head
[1:37:46] remember her body is still prostitute
[1:37:50] body she's still as filthy as she can be
[1:37:55] her past still in the record that on the
[1:37:58] book when people saw her they still see
[1:38:01] she's a whoredom when people saw her
[1:38:04] she's a prostitute but thank God her
[1:38:06] headship tanged when the head changed
[1:38:09] then the whole being was changed then
[1:38:11] when the head United with the body no
[1:38:14] matter how weak we are but we're head
[1:38:16] United with the body it take her to the
[1:38:19] Heavenly Place she's as holy as he can
[1:38:23] be because her headship now taking the
[1:38:33] responsibility the Bible said as she
[1:38:36] conceived and bared a daughter and God
[1:38:40] said unto her him called her name l
[1:38:45] l l for I will no more have mercy upon
[1:38:50] the house of Israel
[1:38:51] but I will utterly take them away now
[1:38:55] when she win the l h she conceive and
[1:38:58] bear a son then said God called his name
[1:39:02] loami for ye are not my people and I
[1:39:06] will not be your God what a hopeless
[1:39:09] helpless estate that is woman's at
[1:39:12] that but thank God is said yet the
[1:39:15] number of the children of Israel shall
[1:39:18] be as the sand of the sea which cannot
[1:39:21] be measured nor numbered and he shall
[1:39:24] come to pass that in the
[1:39:26] place where he was said unto them ye are
[1:39:30] not my people there it shall be said
[1:39:34] unto them ye are the sons of the Living
[1:39:39] God in the place that they were called
[1:39:42] you not my children you done things that
[1:39:44] the wrong but in the same place when the
[1:39:47] has sheep coming back and he said you
[1:39:49] are my son you are my wife you are my
[1:39:52] bride the Airship has a
[1:39:58] change when you United with the headship
[1:40:02] in his hour when a cloud was sh up on
[1:40:05] the Arizona sky it shows to us the
[1:40:08] headship is coming back and is united
[1:40:12] with the bride that in this
[1:40:14] hour is said in the
[1:40:17] place that you were said no mercy but in
[1:40:21] that same place that said you're the Son
[1:40:24] and Daughter of the Living God in the
[1:40:27] place that were you said I was sick but
[1:40:31] in that same place that he said I'm your
[1:40:33] healer in that place that call you are
[1:40:37] adulter but in the same place the
[1:40:39] redeeming power coming down said that
[1:40:42] you are an unadulterated bride of Jesus
[1:40:46] Christ the headship has coming
[1:40:49] back why because he is a Jehovah
[1:40:54] Shema if he is a Jehovah Shema then
[1:40:57] Ezekiel 4835 that means the Lord is
[1:41:01] there where in that City the name shall
[1:41:05] be called the Lord is there the C is the
[1:41:09] New Jerusalem it's the Bride of Jesus
[1:41:12] Christ it's not that you will be but he
[1:41:15] said I put my name in you and my name is
[1:41:18] Jehovah shemi and I will be in you I
[1:41:22] will be in you I will be there it's not
[1:41:26] I will be there but my name is I'll be
[1:41:31] there in the same place that you called
[1:41:35] a daughter but that my name is in there
[1:41:38] I a Jehovah Shem if I a Jehovah Shem
[1:41:42] that means I'm the Lord the present God
[1:41:46] that means wherever you are God is there
[1:41:49] in your difficulty he said
[1:41:51] Jehovah sh the H is there in your trials
[1:41:55] he said I'll be there and your difficult
[1:41:58] situation that you seem there's no hope
[1:42:01] he said my name is a Jehovah
[1:42:05] sh I put my name
[1:42:10] there if he is a Jehovah
[1:42:13] Gyra he must be Jehovah
[1:42:16] Shima what could to do to us if Jehovah
[1:42:20] Gyra is only
[1:42:22] was what could to do to us if Jehovah
[1:42:26] Tak the two is just
[1:42:28] was but I make sure in the Book of
[1:42:31] Ezekiel 48 the last one name of a God is
[1:42:35] said in my name is the Jehovah
[1:42:37] Shema I will be
[1:42:41] there I'm not just the past tense but I
[1:42:44] will always
[1:42:46] be I'm the god that Health me I'm
[1:42:50] Jehovah sh I heal you before I heal you
[1:42:53] now I will heal you in
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:42:58] future thank you Lord the headship is
[1:43:02] coming back because he's a jealousy
[1:43:06] about his own bride that's make him
[1:43:09] become zealous about his own
[1:43:15] bride God is a jealous God brother Bram
[1:43:18] said he's a jealous and in one his wife
[1:43:20] a pure he wants her a virgin chased
[1:43:24] nothing in the world into her at all all
[1:43:28] together is the word part of him we must
[1:43:31] be a part of the word not a part of the
[1:43:34] crade a part of the word and not a part
[1:43:36] of the church a part of the Bride church
[1:43:40] is a condemned we know that she goes to
[1:43:43] outer Darkness but a bride goes up
[1:43:48] Hallelujah Lord I don't want him to be
[1:43:50] like like the rest of the world I'm
[1:43:52] jealous of them aren't you thankful we
[1:43:55] have a prophet that are representing the
[1:43:58] Lord is that I'm jealous is that a
[1:44:00] prophet or is it God himself saying I'm
[1:44:03] jealous about
[1:44:05] you I want them to be real Christian I
[1:44:09] want them to look like it act like it
[1:44:12] and be like it and be
[1:44:14] genuine and that's the reason I'm
[1:44:17] zealous of my brethren I don't want them
[1:44:20] off in the little old Social Gospel just
[1:44:22] like you get out of some incubator out
[1:44:25] here I want them to be real man of a god
[1:44:28] stand and not compromise on that word
[1:44:32] and really let it out
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:41] there that's why God s is a prophet
[1:44:45] that's why he sended a
[1:44:47] messenger and in beyond the curtain of a
[1:44:50] Time
[1:44:51] brother BR said if that was the true on
[1:44:53] that day he said Jesus will come to you
[1:44:57] and you will present us to him a chased
[1:45:01] version judg the by the word that you
[1:45:04] preached to them then a voice RIS it up
[1:45:08] said if you haven't been go if you
[1:45:10] haven't went we won't be here how we
[1:45:14] thankful there is a faithful servant
[1:45:17] just like a Paul that I'm jealous I want
[1:45:20] to present God a Chase diversion and he
[1:45:24] fulfills
[1:45:28] that that's why we are
[1:45:31] zealous if God is a zealous and jealousy
[1:45:36] to his a bride and he sented a prophet
[1:45:39] jealous and zealous about God's bride we
[1:45:43] must be zealous amen it's not a we must
[1:45:47] there's a zealous right inside of you
[1:45:51] you just need to be
[1:45:53] inspired you just need to realize who
[1:45:56] you are and what is in
[1:45:58] you not just a little church right not
[1:46:02] just us 400 and no
[1:46:05] more there's way way beyond
[1:46:11] that if I preach to you just what Paul
[1:46:14] preached to brother Bram said to his
[1:46:16] church and his groups get in ours will
[1:46:18] too cuz we got to the same thing and he
[1:46:22] has it the same zealous same gospel if
[1:46:25] it is a message is the true and we are

[2:04:28] bleach try to find it again the coloring
[2:04:31] of sin goes back through the mediator
[2:04:35] and down through the time until the H
[2:04:37] accuser Satan and lays on him till the
[2:04:41] day of
[2:04:43] judgment then he
[2:04:45] said he said you never done that in the

[2:05:43] forgetfulness your old book of marriage
[2:05:46] is the divorced and dead
[2:05:50] it said that you are Justified it was
[2:05:53] accused he said you was accused so you

[2:07:14] Christ may the Lord will bless
[2:07:17] you
[2:07:32] I I won't be able to talk very long I I
[2:07:35] hope I don't
[2:07:37] cough but jealousy
[2:07:41] causes
[2:07:43] jealousy it turns you into a
[2:07:46] zealot and
[2:07:50] it just makes that Great
[2:07:53] Commission come alive in us going into
[2:07:56] all the world and preach the
[2:08:00] gospel you shall do these things these
[2:08:03] signs and these wonders in my
[2:08:07] name and you you see
[2:08:12] that
[2:08:14] that he who has been forgiven much loves
[2:08:21] much that building there is because I'm
[2:08:24] zealous and jealous of
[2:08:28] you this building here is
[2:08:33] because there's someone that's
[2:08:36] zealous and loves because there was
[2:08:39] somebody that was zealous of me when I
[2:08:43] was that woman that had so failed isn't
[2:08:48] that all all of you isn't that all of us
[2:08:51] we've had a God that loved us a God that
[2:08:54] was zealous of us a God that went and
[2:08:57] found us and sought us out brother Matt
[2:08:59] when we were just no way to even find
[2:09:03] our way to him he came and found
[2:09:06] us amen and when when we were unworthy
[2:09:10] he became our
[2:09:14] righteousness through everything in the
[2:09:16] sea of forgetfulness and started us all
[2:09:19] over that we could bear the word of God
[2:09:22] and the word of God could come
[2:09:24] to life in
[2:09:28] us you know they talked about all
[2:09:31] these sentences that were written and
[2:09:35] all those things and and we can't go to
[2:09:38] all those places and reach all those
[2:09:40] people but I can say There's 7 million
[2:09:43] people in Dallas Fort
[2:09:46] Worth that you can talk to
[2:09:50] that you can give books to that you can
[2:09:53] do a work for that you can really
[2:09:57] show and the prophet of God said that
[2:10:00] every
[2:10:02] person deserves the right to hear the
[2:10:05] gospel at least
[2:10:07] once so I I hope that we here tonight
[2:10:12] and um when I thought in my heart of
[2:10:16] these meetings and I thought Lord what
[2:10:20] what is
[2:10:22] um my desire and what is the theme of
[2:10:27] the meeting and it just came to my heart
[2:10:31] you know Lord show us the
[2:10:33] way you know show us the father show us
[2:10:37] the way what way should we go what
[2:10:42] direction should we go go in what what
[2:10:46] path should our lives take there's so
[2:10:49] much confusion there's so much fussing
[2:10:52] in the message is dividing up into
[2:10:55] different camps and and it it's just
[2:10:58] such absolutely Church splits after
[2:11:01] church splits and movement starting and
[2:11:04] people calling themselves under and I
[2:11:06] just pulled away and I thought Lord
[2:11:08] which
[2:11:10] direction should I
[2:11:13] go and it just hit me just so simply
[2:11:17] going into all the
[2:11:19] world and preach the
[2:11:22] gospel let your light so shine among men
[2:11:26] that your good works might glorify your
[2:11:29] father in
[2:11:31] Heaven let eat the word of God with
[2:11:34] singleness of heart work out your own
[2:11:37] salvation with fear and tremble keep the
[2:11:41] gospel simple keep it in your
[2:11:44] life live it and let your life light
[2:11:49] shine that your good
[2:11:52] works might
[2:11:54] glorify the
[2:11:56] father above that Satan has come in and
[2:12:00] beguiled you or taken you away from the
[2:12:04] Simplicity of the
[2:12:08] Gospel that's where God's hid and I I
[2:12:11] believe if we could just hear what the
[2:12:14] spirit of God is saying to to us get
[2:12:19] back on track get back on fire apply the
[2:12:25] token to your hearts to your lives to
[2:12:29] your mind fall back in love with God
[2:12:32] Amen make
[2:12:33] contact with your
[2:12:37] Bible even when brother George was with
[2:12:40] us read your Bible pray read the message
[2:12:45] get back to being zealous get back to
[2:12:48] being on fire and and watch the joy of
[2:12:52] the Lord and the peace that surpasseth
[2:12:56] understanding boil over in your life cuz
[2:13:01] we have to be blind not to think that
[2:13:04] this world's Fallen
[2:13:07] apart I mean it is
[2:13:12] absolutely
[2:13:13] going
[2:13:15] nowhere and the world's looking
[2:13:18] for a hope and they're looking for a
[2:13:22] path and they're looking for somebody to
[2:13:25] show them the way and Jesus says I am
[2:13:30] the way the truth the life no man comes
[2:13:34] un the father but by me and you know
[2:13:38] that way cuz that way is in you I think
[2:13:41] it's important that we get back to what
[2:13:44] it was that we were commissioned to to
[2:13:48] do in the first place and I don't want
[2:13:51] to be a scholar of this
[2:13:54] message I want to
[2:13:56] live the word of God so God bless you
