[17:10] When I woke up this morning,
[17:14] your presence filled the room.
[17:18] With a grateful heart, I just shook my
[17:22] head as I bowed in all of you.
[17:27] Lord, you have been so faithful,
[17:31] so loving, kind, and true.
[17:35] And every morning
[17:37] your mercies are new.
[17:43] Today my heart is overwhelmed
[17:47] by what you've done for me.
[17:51] And my mind cannot grasp the depths of
[17:56] your generosities,
[18:00] the riches of your mercies,
[18:04] the wonders of your ways.
[18:08] And my voice cries out in endless
[18:12] praise.
[18:14] You have been good.
[18:19] You have been good
[18:24] more than I could ever dream you would.
[18:31] You have been good.
[18:36] You have been good
[18:40] immeasurably
[18:43] more than you should.
[18:48] Lord,
[18:51] you have been good
[18:59] [Music]
[19:01] for my home and my old family.
[19:05] Every need you did provide.
[19:10] But most of all, on a rugged cross, you
[19:14] gave your life for mine.
[19:17] I'm forgiven, pardoned, sanctified, and
[19:22] I know that I've been redeemed.
[19:26] And one day I will worship at your feet.
[19:33] [Music]
[19:34] Good.
[19:37] You have been good.
[19:42] more than I could ever dream you would.
[19:49] You have been good.
[19:54] You have been good.
[19:58] It matters probably more than you
[20:03] should.
[20:06] Lord,
[20:09] you have been good.
[20:14] So no matter what the future holds or
[20:19] what tomorrow brings,

[21:03] Imaging
[21:05] more than you should.
[21:10] Lord,
[21:12] [Music]
[21:14] you have been good.
[21:17] [Music]
[21:19] I measurably
[21:21] more than you should.

[23:44] [Music]
[23:48] beyond this flesh
[23:51] that you can see now.
[23:54] Beyond those weaknesses
[23:57] of this flesh,
[23:59] there is a connection
[24:03] invisible.
[24:05] with Jesus Christ.
[24:10] I don't know how.
[24:14] I don't know why. I cannot explain
[24:19] the love of God for my soul
[24:22] down inside of me. When I hear the word,
[24:28] my heart say
[24:30] amen.
[24:32] [Music]
[24:33] I say amen.
[24:39] Beyond this flesh

[24:45] beyond the weaknesses
[24:48] of this flesh,
[24:50] there is a connection,
[24:54] invisible
[24:56] with Jesus Christ.
[24:59] [Music]
[25:02] I don't know how.
[25:04] I don't know why. I cannot explain
[25:10] the love of God for my soul. But down
[25:13] inside of me, when I hear the word,
[25:19] my heart say,
[25:21] "Amen."
[25:23] [Music]
[25:24] I say, "Amen.
[25:29] [Music]
[25:35] [Music]
[25:55] He has said I would be perfect.
[25:59] [Music]
[26:00] with the virtues of Jesus Christ
[26:03] himself.
[26:05] But I look around, I still see so much
[26:08] imperfection
[26:11] shown to me by the devil, my enemy
[26:16] trying to get me sad and depressed.
[26:22] But I stand right up on my two feet.
[26:27] I look at him straight in the eye
[26:31] and I say,
[26:33] "I don't know how.
[26:36] I don't know why. I cannot explain
[26:41] the love of God for my soul. But down
[26:44] inside of me, when I hear this message,
[26:49] my heart says, "Amen."
[26:55] I say amen.
[27:00] He has said I would be raptured
[27:05] to fly away in the sky
[27:11] and discover this other dimension.
[27:15] [Music]
[27:16] I can still feel the force of gravity
[27:22] trying to get me down.
[27:25] to this earth
[27:27] and get me stuck to this plane.
[27:32] I look at him straight in the eye
[27:36] and I say, "I don't know how.
[27:41] I don't know why. I cannot explain
[27:46] the love of Christ for my soul. Down
[27:50] inside of me. When I hear the word,

[30:40] beautiful to us and father what we
[30:42] desires is the manifestation of your
[30:45] promises in our lives. Father, when we
[30:48] hear testimonies like this, it lifts up
[30:50] our hearts, Lord, to know that our God
[30:53] is walking in the midst of the
[30:55] candlesticks and in his people, Lord,
[30:57] and he's there to make the word a
[30:59] reality. Father, I know that all you've
[31:01] asked for us to do is to believe. And
[31:04] when we believe, coming before you,
[31:06] Lord, I know one thing that your
[31:07] promises are true and amen that you will
[31:10] walk in our midst and make it true.
[31:12] Father, for every afflicted hand
[31:14] tonight, Father, may your spirit, Lord,
[31:17] may your angels just go behind it, Lord,
[31:20] and touch each one. And for the unspoken
[31:22] request and whatever the need is,
[31:24] Father, you are more than sufficient for
[31:26] all that we have need of. We lift up
[31:29] your name tonight. Not a man, but you,
[31:31] the Lord Jesus Christ, manifested in the
[31:34] age that we are living in to make
[31:36] yourself a reality. The true original
[31:39] word that was spoken in the beginning,
[31:41] we have it once again in our hands.
[31:43] Lord, lead us and guide us. Let us not
[31:45] be astray. Let us not look to the left
[31:48] and right, but look solely to Jesus
[31:50] Christ and him alone because you are the
[31:52] true bread of life that's been given for
[31:55] us to live. We commit everything we are.

[33:44] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand and sing it as we cross.
[33:48] Oh, and on the wings of the sto.
[33:58] [Music]
[34:11] Let's pray again. and our gracious
[34:13] father, we ask you to bless us in the
[34:15] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus, we
[34:17] pray. Amen. May God bless you. You may
[34:20] be seated this evening. We uh just going
[34:24] to say a a few words uh before uh we uh
[34:30] go forward and just uh to make the
[34:34] emphasis on what that were pointing out
[34:39] to us. So, I'd like to read that
[34:42] statement that I read to you this
[34:45] morning from the message of the rising
[34:49] of the sun. Um, like again, I don't have
[34:53] paragraphs in this book, but it says the
[34:56] first one
[34:58] uh
[35:00] all through he had he had been typed
[35:03] many times.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. And we and we'll see later
[35:08] that he was a type out of this uh uh out
[35:13] of this real the first fruits of them
[35:16] that slept. So I don't know if you can
[35:19] find that quote again. Um it's it's just
[35:24] right after he reads the
[35:27] a a scripture or two uh there in the
[35:31] rising of the sun. It's about page um
[35:36] page 15. I'm sorry I don't have a
[35:39] paragraph book, but I'll read it and
[35:41] then maybe they can find it. So listen,
[35:44] he says
[35:46] he says the first one. So he's talking
[35:49] about the you know that Jesus was the
[35:51] first one that rose out from the
[35:54] prophets. He's the first one that rose
[35:56] from the dead. He's placing the things
[35:58] that he was first. And he says, although
[36:01] it's been typed many times, as we'll see
[36:04] later, that he was a type, but this is
[36:09] really the first fruits of them that
[36:12] slept.
[36:14] And he was waved over the promised seed
[36:20] that that had promise of life.
[36:25] That's right.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; He was waved at the day of Pentecost
[36:29] when there came a sound from heaven like
[36:33] a waving
[36:35] mighty rushing wind
[36:39] and was waved over the people at
[36:42] Pentecost.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; People that was up at the Pentecostal
[36:47] waiting for the blessings to come.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; And to be waved again. We realize it in
[36:55] the last days.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; According to Luke 17:30,
[37:02] in the Sunday in in the s day, the
[37:06] Sunday again in the days that the son of
[37:10] man would be revealed or waved again
[37:14] over the people.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:17] So you know many times we hear the
[37:20] expression the word and many times when
[37:23] we talk about the word people think the
[37:25] Bible
[37:27] &gt;&gt; okay but this Bible wasn't even ex in
[37:30] existence
[37:32] &gt;&gt; and yet the word was still working and
[37:35] going and manifesting.
[37:38] So we we and but and we read the uh uh
[37:42] the other scripture
[37:44] uh that we read in the morning uh about
[37:48] uh according to uh uh you know to be
[37:53] back in in its full power according to
[37:56] Luke 17:30, Malachi 4:5 and other
[38:00] scriptures. So, if we if we could put up
[38:04] on the board uh Luke 17:30 and just put
[38:08] that scripture up on the board and so
[38:12] you would look at that scripture and uh
[38:17] they should be able to find that. It's a
[38:19] real common scripture in the message
[38:22] Luke 17:38.
[38:26] All right.
[38:27] Even thus shall it be in the day when
[38:30] the son of man is revealed. Now we say
[38:34] that's a scripture. We say that's the
[38:37] word. But the word of it was really when
[38:42] the son of man was standing there in
[38:44] flesh being revealed.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; So if you would look at the scripture,
[38:50] the scripture was the prophecy or the
[38:54] description. Yeah.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Then when it came, it was fulfilled.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; And so there was many uh scriptures
[39:03] concerning the coming Messiah written in
[39:06] the Old Testament. They considered that
[39:09] to be the word, the scrolls, the Old
[39:11] Testaments, the writings. But when that
[39:15] came from
[39:16] &gt;&gt; from prophecy, when it came from letter
[39:21] &gt;&gt; and was made flesh, then it was the word
[39:24] made flesh. In the beginning was the
[39:27] word. The word was with God and the word
[39:30] was made flesh. That's what we're built
[39:33] on. were not built on the word that was
[39:36] spoken or the word that was prophesied
[39:40] because you would still be looking for
[39:42] it
[39:42] &gt;&gt; as they are today. But if you are built
[39:45] on that word being fulfilled and made
[39:49] flesh,
[39:51] &gt;&gt; like we said this morning, you've got to
[39:54] have faith that you're dead, that your
[39:57] sins have been forgiven, and that old
[39:58] man has died. In other words, you can
[40:01] talk about Calvary. You can talk about
[40:03] what Jesus did, but until what he did
[40:06] becomes a reality to you and you know
[40:10] he's forgiven my sins, he's he's put
[40:14] that old man to rest and he's created in
[40:17] me a new creature. Then you know you've
[40:20] got scripture, but you don't have word
[40:25] &gt;&gt; because if I give you my word, it's not
[40:28] my word till what I promised you is
[40:31] fulfilled. Do
[40:32] &gt;&gt; you understand? It's like I I'm going to
[40:36] &gt;&gt; you know I get a lot of people's word
[40:38] they're going to pay me back.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; But until they keep their word,
[40:45] it's it's not word. I I hope I can kind
[40:48] of express that. So we understand this
[40:50] is the word in the day when the son of
[40:53] man shall be revealed. Malachi 4:5. We
[40:56] we can put that up there in the
[41:00] scripture.
[41:01] And uh uh
[41:10] boy, AI ain't very fast, is it?
[41:15] It says, "Behold, I will send you Elijah
[41:18] the prophet before the coming of the
[41:22] great and dreadful day of the Lord."
[41:24] That is a prophecy.
[41:27] That's what God said, right? But now
[41:31] that actually has transpired.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; That Elijah has come.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; He's he's been here. We we know
[41:39] Revelations
[41:41] uh 10 and and and seven. You you know
[41:45] that as it is in the days of the voice
[41:48] of the seventh angel, the mysteries of
[41:50] God shall be finished. That was written
[41:54] in here. You might say, "Well, that's
[41:56] the word. That's the Bible." But if it's
[42:00] it's it's an incomplete
[42:04] unfinished
[42:07] if it doesn't become a reality.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; So that's become a reality. Oh, you
[42:12] haven't found that yet in Revelations.
[42:17] Revelations is the last book in the
[42:19] Bible.
[42:21] I'm just having fun with Dylan back
[42:23] there. Forgive me. All right. Behold, in
[42:28] the days of the voice of the seventh
[42:31] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[42:35] mysteries of God should be finished, as
[42:38] he hath declared to his servants, the
[42:42] prophets.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; All right? So now that's come to pass.
[42:45] So, we've got these three scriptures
[42:48] here, three promises of God, three
[42:51] things that are going to be waved over
[42:57] the people.
[42:59] Okay? That's what God's going to do. We
[43:02] just read it in our thought. We talked
[43:04] about the sheep offering that that's
[43:06] what it was going to do. It was going to
[43:08] be waved over the people. the elected
[43:12] seed of God was going to have this waved
[43:15] over him because the sheep offering is
[43:19] is to show
[43:22] the seed that was planted what it's
[43:26] going to become.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; You that's the way it God put that in
[43:33] there in shadows and types and he said
[43:35] Jesus was the first one that came from
[43:38] the dead. you know, and and it uh uh uh
[43:45] Joel and went through that. He said,
[43:47] "Though the skin worms eat my flesh, yet
[43:50] shall I see God." You know, is there
[43:52] life after a plant witherth? And and so
[43:56] we see these things are spoken. So now
[43:59] what we're what we're sitting back this
[44:01] evening and we want to come back into
[44:04] the realization God is going to wave
[44:07] this in the last day over the people.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. So the the the voice that was
[44:14] waved can't be different than the voice
[44:17] of the bride.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; We hear that statement a lot. You are
[44:22] the voice in the last day. You are the
[44:25] voice. But if that voice doesn't have
[44:28] any similarity
[44:31] to what was waved,
[44:33] &gt;&gt; then it's you're not so sure that's the
[44:36] voice that he's
[44:38] &gt;&gt; of the last day.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be critical. You
[44:43] understand? I I'm I'm standing here
[44:45] doing my job
[44:48] &gt;&gt; as a shepherd,
[44:50] &gt;&gt; you know, warning the sheep. say you've
[44:55] got to be careful what road you're going
[44:57] down and where it's going to end up. It
[45:00] looks good. It sounds good.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. But let's examine it.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; By the word of God,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; right? Let's know it by its fruit.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; So now we're going to watch
[45:16] this evening. So I know you've all seen
[45:18] it. Okay? And I remember the first time
[45:22] I sat it I I watched that film. I was so
[45:25] nervous I couldn't hardly stand it.
[45:29] You know, he seems like he's fumbling
[45:31] around and he's looking for things to
[45:34] say and and I'm thinking, you got to be
[45:36] kidding me. you know, I thought he's
[45:39] just gonna go out there and go zap zap
[45:41] zap zap,
[45:44] you know, like Cesob de Mills or, you
[45:47] know, and then this guy shows up,
[45:51] you know, and then he finally says, you
[45:54] know, I'm waiting for something
[46:00] and and then he apologizes
[46:04] if I've said anything boastful. fault.
[46:08] But when that head goes back
[46:11] like this, he goes,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; "He's here,
[46:16] &gt;&gt; buddy." He says, "I take every spirit in
[46:18] this building under my control. I like
[46:21] to come out of my seat."
[46:23] &gt;&gt; But what I'm wanting to you to
[46:25] understand is watch what God presented.
[46:31] This is what God chose
[46:34] &gt;&gt; to wave over his elected.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; This is the nature, the personality, the
[46:40] man. And remember the other film we saw
[46:44] and brother Armbbrite and and I forget
[46:46] the other brother's name that came in.
[46:49] Brother Bram looked like a
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Excuse the expression.
[46:54] You know, he was a small man, maybe 5'7,
[46:57] I believed, 135 pounds. You You know
[47:01] what I mean? It's like you're starting
[47:03] to say, "Well,
[47:06] I would have picked Saul,
[47:08] &gt;&gt; right? But God picked David,
[47:12] &gt;&gt; I would have picked a great orator,
[47:15] but God picked a humble man from
[47:18] Kentucky with no education, no
[47:20] background."
[47:22] So you if you don't understand
[47:25] how God's presenting and filling his
[47:28] word, you have no bearing. You have no
[47:33] measuring stick.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; You understand? You don't have any way
[47:38] to measure any ministry.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, they preach what? They
[47:43] they preach out of brother Brandham's
[47:46] books. They preach out of the Bible."
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:51] But it wasn't the word.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Just because they grab this book
[47:58] &gt;&gt; and they take chosen quotes
[48:01] &gt;&gt; and they match them up any way that they
[48:03] want to present something that they
[48:07] believe in. And this goes for me too.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; You've got to examine me
[48:15] &gt;&gt; by the same method.
[48:17] Brother Rem says you answer the problem
[48:20] but but they answer by solving the
[48:22] problem. You know you subtract you add
[48:24] one way subtract the other. You should
[48:26] get it. So what if we did the
[48:28] subtracting side and see if we get the
[48:31] same answer. So what you're going to see
[48:33] is you're going to see God is now going
[48:37] to fulfill Malachi 4:5.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You're not seeing William Brandom
[48:42] standing there. You're seeing Malachi
[48:44] 4:5 standing there. William Brandham
[48:47] happened to be the name
[48:49] &gt;&gt; of the vessel
[48:50] &gt;&gt; you're seeing Luke 17:30
[48:53] &gt;&gt; the son of man
[48:56] &gt;&gt; revealing the thoughts and intents of
[48:58] the people
[48:59] &gt;&gt; God veiled in a prophetic ministry
[49:03] standing there look at what he chose
[49:06] look how he chose to present it look at
[49:09] the simplicity of the sermon look at the
[49:13] nature look at the humble He didn't pre
[49:16] preach great excessive words.
[49:22] Seemingly not a whole lot of enthusiasm
[49:25] or an emotion.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I saw that eagle and I I I cried
[49:31] like a baby
[49:33] and you're sitting back and saying what
[49:35] is the purpose of this? And then it's
[49:38] then also I can say the purpose of it
[49:40] was so in our day
[49:44] when things are drifting away from the
[49:47] messenger. They're drifting away from
[49:50] his nature. They're drifting away from
[49:53] the importance of his ministry and
[49:56] trying to put the importance of the
[49:58] ministry on the quote bride.
[50:04] In other words, he's gone now. You're
[50:08] it.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying you're not it without
[50:13] him.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; When you can present it and your voice
[50:18] becomes his voice,
[50:21] &gt;&gt; when your nature becomes his nature,
[50:23] because remember we read it this
[50:25] morning, he even becomes closer and more
[50:29] in the image of a son. He's starting to
[50:31] look a lot more like a son now.
[50:34] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[50:35] the heart, praying for the s like Paul
[50:37] said, that's where we want the gospel
[50:40] go. We don't want all the miracles to
[50:41] happen here. You're already believers.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; We want the miracles to happen out there
[50:46] where they might know that Jesus Christ
[50:48] is the same yesterday, today, and
[50:50] forever. So now, as we watch this, it's
[50:53] going to be an hour. We'll go right into
[50:55] communion.
[50:56] But what you're seeing is the way that
[51:00] God chose to fulfill
[51:04] the scripture in this day.
[51:08] You're seeing Revelations
[51:13] 3 and 14 and the the seeing the angel,
[51:18] seeing the messenger, you're seeing him.
[51:22] That's the voice.
[51:24] The bride is not going to have a
[51:27] different voice.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Look at the nature. Look at the manner.
[51:33] Look at the way.
[51:36] Paul said, "Be ye followers of me as I
[51:38] am of Christ." He's giving us the light.
[51:43] And when the word is fulfilled, that's
[51:46] the light for that age.
[51:50] And we are, as we read this morning, we
[51:53] are to become the children of the age,
[51:58] this age. So you see the messenger age,
[52:02] you see the spirit of the age, you see
[52:04] the manner of the age, you see the voice
[52:06] of the age. That's what God chose to
[52:09] wave over you.
[52:11] And then you can look at that depending
[52:13] on the effect of that upon you and your
[52:17] nature and your personality and what God
[52:20] makes that mean to you, you will see
[52:23] what it brings alive in you.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; So
[52:29] if if the scripture says that if the
[52:33] enemy comes in like a flood that God
[52:36] will raise up a standard.
[52:39] So, I'm presenting you the standard
[52:43] &gt;&gt; because Satan is promised to appear as
[52:46] an angel of light.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; So, he's not going to come in. Satan is
[52:53] not going to show up and tell you
[52:54] Malachi 4 is not true.
[52:58] He'll show up
[53:00] with Malachi 4:5, but it won't have any
[53:04] nature
[53:06] or any of the voice or any of the
[53:09] teachings.
[53:10] And so as you look at this, just watch
[53:14] this from, if I could humbly say this,
[53:18] from the viewpoint
[53:21] of what God chose
[53:24] to show you and to wave over you. And
[53:28] this is the voice of God to you in this
[53:32] last days. All his fumbling,
[53:35] all his story, everything, the whole
[53:39] picture. Get the picture. This is what w
[53:42] is captured. It's on tape. It's many
[53:46] places you can see. Handing out prayer
[53:48] cards, all those things. It's the way
[53:51] that God chose to do it. Not the way we
[53:55] want to make it,
[53:58] not what we want to turn it into, not
[54:01] how we think it should have been done.
[54:03] This is how God chose to do it. So, God
[54:07] bless you. I hope tonight that it's a
[54:09] blessing. And I'll tell you, this man
[54:13] had a wonderful
[54:16] personality
[54:17] &gt;&gt; and nature. I believe it was the nature
[54:20] of Jesus Christ and the God's Jesus was
[54:24] the personality of God.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know that
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the personality of God? And
[54:34] when you have the same spirit he had,
[54:37] you'll have that personality in nature.
[54:40] I guess we'll turn off the lights. Is
[54:42] that correct?
[54:45] Can you boys turn off those lights right
[54:47] there? You just hit those switches.
[54:50] Here we go. It's got to be a deacon's
[54:52] voice.
[54:54] One, two. Keep going. Going.
[54:59] All right. And hit the two inside ones.
[55:07] Oh, let's hit another one. One more.
[55:13] Good enough.
[55:16] Does that help?
[55:19] &gt;&gt; You know, I wired this place. I thought
[55:21] they ran this way,
[55:23] but uh shows you what I remember.
[55:27] This is This is wonderful. This is God
[55:32] waving the sheath offering over you. God
[55:35] bless you.
[55:47] Oh my. There's no two Holy Spirits.
[55:51] And that same Holy Spirit that led
[55:54] Simeon that night or that morning to the
[55:57] Christ has led you here tonight
[56:00] &gt;&gt; because you believe the promise of the
[56:02] Holy Spirit. And he's just as obligated
[56:05] to you as he was to Simeon.
[56:08] the same because he's God and he has to
[56:11] keep his word. Then I can see
[56:14] Simeon, he craved, he desired to see the
[56:18] Christ. He believed what the word of God
[56:20] had said to him. No matter what the
[56:21] critics said, he believed the word of
[56:23] God. There was a yearning in his heart
[56:26] to see the Christ and he believed he
[56:28] would. As David said, when the deep
[56:31] calleth to the deep, many of you in here
[56:35] believe in divine healing. Do you you
[56:38] believe in divine healing? The very
[56:40] reason that you believe in divine
[56:42] healing proves there is a divine
[56:44] healing. When we come to America, we
[56:46] found the American Indian. He was
[56:48] worshiping something of the sun, the
[56:51] moon, and nature because in him he's a
[56:55] human being and he knows he had a maker.
[56:58] So there was something within his human
[57:00] heart called out to worship. It is to
[57:03] every mortal. You might worship your
[57:04] automobile, your job, your house or
[57:07] something, you'll worship something. So
[57:10] if there's any idol, take it out and let
[57:12] Jesus Christ have first place.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Let him be first of all. Then the hunger
[57:19] deep, as David said, when the deep
[57:22] callest to the deep at the noise of thy
[57:26] water spouts.
[57:28] Now the deep calling to the deep. For
[57:31] instance, this if there is a deep in
[57:35] your calling, there has to be a deep to
[57:38] respond to that call. Maybe I'll make
[57:41] myself clear as this. I'm a great lover
[57:44] of nature. And going into the woods, I
[57:47] watch the sunset. I hear the animals
[57:51] scream of the wild. My mother's a half
[57:54] Indian. So, it is something about it in
[57:57] my blood that I I love nature. And when
[58:00] I hear the call from the wild, there's
[58:03] something sets my soul on fire. I can't
[58:06] help it.
[58:07] Just recently I was up in Colorado and I
[58:10] was standing up on a mountain and I was
[58:13] watching an old mother eagle as she
[58:16] brought her little ones from the nest
[58:17] and on her wings and set them down in a
[58:20] grassy pasture. And then she flew back
[58:24] up to the top very peak of the highest
[58:27] rock she could get to and she sat down.
[58:30] She began to watch while I was watching
[58:33] through by binoculars. My horse was
[58:35] hitched to a tree and I was watching and
[58:38] I said, "Lord, I like this." And it
[58:40] seemed to me that I smell if you was
[58:43] ever around an eagle's nest and they
[58:45] make it out of sharp sticks and things
[58:47] and then poor little eagles were just
[58:49] walking on those sticks and thorns. They
[58:53] never know nothing else. But one day the
[58:55] mother spread forth her wings and they
[58:57] stepped on the wings and went out. Now I
[59:00] looked at those little fellas and they
[59:02] were just having a a Pentecostal
[59:04] revival. They were just running around
[59:08] on that soft grass just picking here and
[59:12] chirping to one another and jumping over
[59:14] each other just as free as they could
[59:16] be. I thought, well, that's right. Now,
[59:19] there is like a man in the old nest of
[59:22] the world knows nothing but that what
[59:24] the devil can give him. But one day, God
[59:27] picks him up and sets him down in the
[59:30] shady green pasture.
[59:33] Oh, how he rejoices. He's free. There's
[59:37] nothing, no harm. I thought, well, why
[59:39] ain't those little fellas afraid? Wonder
[59:41] if they realize there's coyotes around
[59:43] that would pick them up. But every once
[59:46] in a while, they would look up and the
[59:48] old mother was sitting up there watching
[59:50] them. I thought, well, praise be to God.
[59:53] That's right. He taken me out of the
[59:56] nest of the world and he climbed the
[59:58] ramparts of glory setting on high
[1:00:00] watching over his heritage to see that
[1:00:04] no harm come. I thought if a coyote
[1:00:06] would start towards one of those
[1:00:07] illegals she'd flog him to death. I
[1:00:10] thought that's right. Let Satan take
[1:00:12] after a believer and he's got Jesus
[1:00:14] Christ on his hands. That's right. Let
[1:00:16] him take After a while she is watching
[1:00:19] her great majestic head looking around.
[1:00:22] She's on the highest rock that she could
[1:00:25] find cuz she could see everywhere. Her
[1:00:27] sharp eagle eyes watching. And after a
[1:00:30] while, I seen her raise her head through
[1:00:31] my 10 power binoculars. I seen her raise
[1:00:34] her head and look around. She was
[1:00:35] whipping the air and I thought, "What is
[1:00:37] it?" Way back in the north, a northerner
[1:00:40] started. The thunder roared. She let out
[1:00:43] a scream and down through there she
[1:00:45] went, throw forth those big wings right
[1:00:47] out on that grassy prairie. And every
[1:00:50] one of those little eagles ran over real
[1:00:53] quick. They were instructed perhaps
[1:00:54] before leaving the nest. They caught
[1:00:56] their little feet right in the feathers.
[1:00:58] Throw their little mouth down. Little
[1:00:59] Bill hooked it around the feather. And
[1:01:01] she raised with that bunch of eagles on
[1:01:04] her wings and went just as straight
[1:01:06] piercing that wind blowing nearly 50 mph
[1:01:08] then right into the cliff of the rock. I
[1:01:11] cried like a baby. How about some
[1:01:14] glorious day
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; when this revival is over, he'll come
[1:01:19] from glory, spread forth these great
[1:01:21] wings of power, and the little eagles
[1:01:23] will hook their bills into there and fly
[1:01:25] away
[1:01:27] into glory with him.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Deeps calling to the deep.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; If the deep's calling, there's a deep
[1:01:37] who respond. In other words, before
[1:01:39] there was a tree to grow on the earth,
[1:01:42] there had to be an earth to grow in
[1:01:43] first. God never made the tree for the
[1:01:46] earth. He made the earth for the tree.
[1:01:48] He made the earth and commanded the
[1:01:50] earth to bring forth a tree. And the
[1:01:52] earth was a calling till the tree come
[1:01:55] forth. Before there was a fin on a
[1:01:57] fish's back, there was no water for him
[1:01:59] to swim in. The reason he's got a fin is
[1:02:02] because there was water for him to swim
[1:02:03] in to use it. Everything that we have is
[1:02:06] for a purpose and for a cause. Here some
[1:02:09] time ago I was reading where a little
[1:02:12] boy eat the racers off a pencil. He eat
[1:02:14] all the rubber he could find. He even
[1:02:18] eat the pedal off of a bicycle. And they
[1:02:21] didn't know what was wrong with the
[1:02:22] little lad. So they took him down for an
[1:02:24] examination to the doctor at the clinic.
[1:02:27] And after examining, they found out his
[1:02:29] little body needed sulfur.
[1:02:32] And sulfur is in rubber. And he was
[1:02:34] eating the rubber to get the sulfur.
[1:02:37] Now, here it is. Get it? There had if
[1:02:41] there was something inside here calling
[1:02:43] for sulfur. There had to be a sulfur to
[1:02:46] respond to it before it could call. See
[1:02:50] what I mean? Now before there when the
[1:02:53] deep calls to the deep before there can
[1:02:57] be a deep call, there has to be a deed
[1:03:01] to respond to it. And then as sure as
[1:03:05] you people a few years ago who probably
[1:03:07] was sinners, maybe you were in some
[1:03:10] formal church that did not believe in
[1:03:12] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but you
[1:03:14] heard the message. There was something
[1:03:16] in there called out for more of God. You
[1:03:19] might have been living in a justified
[1:03:20] state before God, but you wanted the
[1:03:22] baptism of the spirit and you hungered
[1:03:25] for it. Now, the very reason that there
[1:03:28] is a Holy Spirit is because you were
[1:03:30] hungering for it. You had never hunger
[1:03:32] for it unless there was something in
[1:03:33] here to call for it out there. See what
[1:03:36] I mean? And then the very reason that
[1:03:38] you're here tonight, you believe in
[1:03:40] divine healing. And if there was even
[1:03:42] taught in the Bible, if you group of
[1:03:44] people believed in divine healing, there
[1:03:46] has to be a fountain open somewhere or
[1:03:50] you never have the desire for it. If you
[1:03:52] got the desire to be healed by God,
[1:03:54] there's a God to heal you. That's right.
[1:03:57] For the dean calls to the dean. That's
[1:03:59] the way it was with Simeon. He knew that
[1:04:02] there was coming a Christ and he knew
[1:04:04] that God promised him that he would see
[1:04:06] him before he died. Now notice then as
[1:04:11] Simeon was led, isn't this strange? Just
[1:04:15] when Jesus came on the scene, Simeon was
[1:04:19] led by the Holy Spirit right to Christ.
[1:04:22] by the Holy Spirit who gave the promise
[1:04:24] and the Holy Spirit who gave the promise
[1:04:26] of divine healing has led you here
[1:04:29] tonight right to the fountain where it's
[1:04:31] open tonight for whosoever will right
[1:04:34] now right in the same Holy Spirit
[1:04:37] leading leading sons of God who believe
[1:04:40] the promise of God you see what I mean
[1:04:43] every one of you sons and daughters of
[1:04:45] God is led here because you believe
[1:04:47] God's promise oh when I think of it then
[1:04:51] I'll I think way over in the corner was
[1:04:53] an old woman. We're taught that she was
[1:04:55] blind. Her name was Anna. She was the
[1:04:57] prophetess waiting for the coming of the
[1:04:59] Lord. God's under obligation to show her
[1:05:02] the Christ. And the Holy Spirit moved
[1:05:06] upon and and I can see that old blind
[1:05:09] prophetus that morning coming along
[1:05:11] through that building blind led by the
[1:05:13] Holy Spirit moving along the all along
[1:05:16] those people. come down along that line
[1:05:19] of women and stop right in front of the
[1:05:22] fountain for she was led by the Holy
[1:05:25] Spirit.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's here tonight. He has risen
[1:05:29] from the dead. He's given you the
[1:05:31] promise. The Holy Spirit's brought you
[1:05:33] together. If you wasn't here tonight, if
[1:05:36] the Holy Spirit hadn't brought you here,
[1:05:38] you'd be out somewhere in the world. But
[1:05:40] you're sitting here in this hot building
[1:05:41] fanning because why? You're expecting to
[1:05:44] see Jesus Christ come on the scene and
[1:05:47] confirm his word. Expectations. If you
[1:05:50] expect to come just to find something to
[1:05:51] criticize, the devil will sure show you
[1:05:54] plenty to criticize. You certainly will.
[1:05:56] You get what you expect. Some of them
[1:05:58] say, "Well, if I if I don't get up in a
[1:06:00] prayer line, if I see something like
[1:06:02] this, then I'll believe." You'll get
[1:06:04] what you expect. I'm expecting tonight
[1:06:06] to see the Holy Spirit come and manifest
[1:06:09] himself in power, pour out his glory up
[1:06:11] in this building here. Many receive the
[1:06:13] baptism of the Holy Spirit. Sinners weep
[1:06:15] they were at Calvary. Sick be healed.
[1:06:18] All manners of signs and wonders because
[1:06:20] Jesus Christ has promised it.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And I believe his promise. Shall we
[1:06:26] pray? Heavenly Father,
[1:06:29] as thy word is truth,
[1:06:33] confirm thy word with signs and wonders
[1:06:36] of the resurrected Jesus.
[1:06:40] We know that when he was on earth, he
[1:06:42] didn't claim to be a great person. He
[1:06:45] only claimed that you showed him visions
[1:06:47] what to do. He knew the thoughts of the
[1:06:50] people, their conditions. He knew when
[1:06:53] the woman had a blood and she had
[1:06:55] touched his garment, she was standing
[1:06:57] out there and she seen she could not be
[1:06:59] hid for Jesus was looking right at her.
[1:07:03] He knew. He said, "Thy faith has saved
[1:07:06] me."
[1:07:07] And father, we know that he is here
[1:07:11] tonight because he promised to be.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And our confidence is anchored in him,
[1:07:18] in his word. We're sure we have seen him
[1:07:23] in the manifestation of his great
[1:07:26] resurrection here on earth, working
[1:07:28] among his people in his church. And
[1:07:31] Lord, let us be today the lightgivers of
[1:07:34] this age that when the great drama is
[1:07:37] set at the end of the road
[1:07:40] and each one of us comes up before you
[1:07:44] and the great scream is pulled out and
[1:07:47] our lives of this generation is brought
[1:07:49] back before us. God, let me hear my
[1:07:51] voice screaming against unrighteousness
[1:07:54] and calling to people to believe on
[1:07:56] Jesus thy son. Bless the people here
[1:07:59] tonight. There's such intense heat and I
[1:08:03] pray God that you'll give them a special
[1:08:05] blessing. May the soothing powers of the
[1:08:08] Holy Spirit take away all the thoughts
[1:08:11] of this.
[1:08:13] And Lord,
[1:08:16] sanctify thy servant just now for the
[1:08:18] service coming on standing here
[1:08:21] realizing that eyes will be turned this
[1:08:23] way. And I pray, Father, that in
[1:08:26] humility that you'll let your great
[1:08:30] glorious power be known to everyone. And
[1:08:34] as thy unworthy servant has found grace
[1:08:38] in thy sight for tonight, may you take
[1:08:42] this unworthy person,
[1:08:44] move the being out and come in, Lord
[1:08:47] Jesus, and speak to your people.
[1:08:52] And when life is all over here on earth,
[1:08:55] the last prayer has been prayed,
[1:08:58] the battles are all done, smoke's dried
[1:09:02] up, gone away, arms are stacked, the
[1:09:04] Bible's closed,
[1:09:07] and we come up to your house.
[1:09:10] That great morning
[1:09:14] breaks eternal bright and fair
[1:09:18] when the chosen ones shall gather to
[1:09:20] their home beyond the sky. As the port
[1:09:22] said, Lord, as we see that great table
[1:09:25] stretched out there for that supper,
[1:09:29] thousands of miles long,
[1:09:32] looking across the table to each other,
[1:09:35] battle scarred veterans,
[1:09:38] tears of joy running down our cheeks.
[1:09:41] The king come out in his beauty.
[1:09:45] Holiness walk down along the table and
[1:09:47] take his own hands and wipe the tears
[1:09:49] from her eyes, saying, "Don't cry no
[1:09:51] more. It's all over. Enter into the joys
[1:09:54] of the Lord.
[1:09:57] The toils of the road will seem nothing.
[1:09:59] Then, Father, when we get to the end of
[1:10:02] the way, and help us tonight, Lord, to
[1:10:06] forgetting those things which are in the
[1:10:08] past, let us press the mark of the high
[1:10:11] calling now. And may your spirit come
[1:10:14] and manifest your son Jesus Christ to
[1:10:17] these people as I have tried as a mortal
[1:10:19] to tell them of you being the same
[1:10:22] yesterday, today, and forever. For we
[1:10:24] ask that in Jesus name, thy beloved
[1:10:26] child. Amen.
[1:10:32] The Lord bless you.
[1:10:35] And tonight
[1:10:38] just before the healing services,
[1:10:42] excuse me for being a baby, but there's
[1:10:45] something gets in my heart when I talk
[1:10:46] about him. I remember
[1:10:50] when I was first called by my ministers
[1:10:53] when they seen since a little baby
[1:10:56] visions had come, they'd said, "Billy,
[1:10:58] don't you never go to that. Said that's
[1:11:00] the devil." being taught that the
[1:11:03] clergyman I halfway believed that the
[1:11:06] visions would be of the wrong. Then when
[1:11:08] he come to me that night and told me who
[1:11:09] he was,
[1:11:11] oh my. And I know that he's here right
[1:11:14] now and I know his presence and I know I
[1:11:17] love him. I thought, how could I be a
[1:11:19] devil and love the Lord Jesus the way I
[1:11:22] do? How how could my heart believe for
[1:11:24] him and he knows my heart and he came
[1:11:27] and told me different. I believe him
[1:11:30] because it compares with God's word and
[1:11:31] their word does not compare with God's
[1:11:33] word for we're living in this day. And
[1:11:36] now Christian friend I want to say to
[1:11:39] you all course when it strikes me
[1:11:40] sometimes you might wonder what happens
[1:11:44] I I can't explain it. It's beyond me
[1:11:46] explaining but I get so weak that I
[1:11:49] can't hardly stand after maybe one or
[1:11:51] two people that I meet. You might not
[1:11:54] understand that but just read the
[1:11:56] scripture. It declares it. I believe the
[1:11:58] prophet Daniel had saw a vision. He said
[1:12:01] he was troubled at his head for many
[1:12:02] days. Is that right?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And Jesus one time when the woman with
[1:12:06] enough faith to pull him around to see
[1:12:08] who she was, he said, "I perceive that
[1:12:10] virtue, strength has gone out of me."
[1:12:14] And people right out there when it's not
[1:12:16] me, Christian, no, I am I'm just a man,
[1:12:21] chief of sinners, but one born out of
[1:12:24] season to you full gospel people. That's
[1:12:26] right. by grace, by God's grace, he lets
[1:12:30] me call you my brother and sister. And I
[1:12:33] I love you. And I I'm not here tonight
[1:12:38] to be seen or heard.
[1:12:41] I'm not here because of finance side
[1:12:43] that I you know that. So I'm here for
[1:12:47] one thing because I love Jesus and I
[1:12:50] love you. And I believe that the coming
[1:12:52] by this invitation maybe I could submit
[1:12:55] myself to him and he would do something
[1:12:58] through me that would make you love him
[1:13:00] more and believe him and be healed.
[1:13:02] That's my the only alternative I had of
[1:13:05] being here. God bless you. God bless you
[1:13:08] pastors again and businessmen. And I say
[1:13:10] to you now before it gets the week
[1:13:12] sometimes I can't leave the platform. my
[1:13:15] boy and manager them watches that and I
[1:13:18] want to say goodbye to you and God bless
[1:13:21] you and if I never meet you again this
[1:13:23] side of the great river I will see you
[1:13:26] in the morning where the and I'll have
[1:13:29] the testimony that I have now I love the
[1:13:31] Lord Jesus and the visions God gives me
[1:13:35] visions that is true the Bible before me
[1:13:38] and God who is my witness and knows and
[1:13:40] I can only uh declare and say as he
[1:13:44] would let me by his grace do. So pray
[1:13:47] for me. And one more thing I'd like to
[1:13:50] add. I'm going to Africa, India,
[1:13:52] Palestine, Germany, and remember in
[1:13:55] those lands like it was before. Don't
[1:13:57] think that witch doctors and all those
[1:14:00] different demonp possessed people are
[1:14:02] challenger on the ground.
[1:14:04] And you better know what you're speaking
[1:14:06] of. That's right. And when the winds are
[1:14:10] blowing hot and heavy,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. persecution is on. Can I remember
[1:14:15] in Washington DC that somebody's praying
[1:14:17] for me? Will you promise me that? If you
[1:14:19] will raise, thank you. God bless you.
[1:14:22] Thank you much. Now, I think last
[1:14:26] evening they gave out a 100 prayer cards
[1:14:31] last night and I believe that number was
[1:14:33] or that letter was why and I believe I
[1:14:37] called the first 15 of them last night.
[1:14:39] I think that is right, isn't it,
[1:14:40] brethren? the f first 15 of those cards
[1:14:43] that was given out.
[1:14:45] Now, we'll call some more of them. And
[1:14:49] maybe tonight, if faith is coming high,
[1:14:51] maybe we can get two or three groups of
[1:14:53] them. And if not, I ask every person
[1:14:56] here, how many people in here that
[1:14:57] doesn't have a prayer card and would
[1:14:59] want to be healed by God tonight? Just
[1:15:01] raise your hand. Doesn't have a prayer
[1:15:02] card.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Well, it's just, you can hardly tell.
[1:15:07] It's just solid everywhere. I'm going to
[1:15:09] ask you something. This may be my first
[1:15:11] time of ever meeting you. It's too bad
[1:15:13] that we can't stay a little longer in a
[1:15:15] meeting and you know how to accept
[1:15:17] divine healing. Divine Many times when
[1:15:20] people are healed a growth is a is a
[1:15:22] demon. Every sickness is of the devil.
[1:15:26] God would put sickness on his children.
[1:15:28] The devil does that. See, and if Satan
[1:15:31] cast out Satan, you say, "Well, the
[1:15:32] devil heals too." Well, Jesus said he
[1:15:35] couldn't. He said if Satan cast out
[1:15:37] Satan, his kingdom is divided. So he
[1:15:39] can't. Only God can heal. Medicine
[1:15:43] doctors do not claim to heal. Mayo
[1:15:45] brothers is one of our best authorities.
[1:15:47] They said we don't claim to heal. Said
[1:15:49] we only claim to assist nature. There's
[1:15:51] only one healer. That's God. They can
[1:15:53] sew a place up in your hand, but they
[1:15:54] can't heal it. They can only sew it up.
[1:15:56] A dentist can pull a tooth, but who's
[1:15:58] going to heal the place? But a doctor
[1:16:00] can take a pendic out, but who's going
[1:16:02] to heal the place he cut? God does.
[1:16:05] Medicine doesn't build tissues. Medicine
[1:16:07] is only an aid to God. is the healer.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; A doctor can set your arm, but when he
[1:16:12] comes and sets your arm and you don't go
[1:16:13] out and you're not well, the doctor does
[1:16:16] his part. What he's taught to do and
[1:16:18] knowledge to do, he sets your arm, but
[1:16:21] he leaves it for God to heal. That's
[1:16:23] right. All healing is of God.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; So now you just believe him. And
[1:16:27] sometimes when those gross of life go
[1:16:29] out of them as a demon, well then those
[1:16:31] gross die. If the life went out of you,
[1:16:34] of course you would die. your life will
[1:16:36] go from you, but the body's still there.
[1:16:39] It shrinks. There's an undertaker here
[1:16:41] knows that the human body, anybody, any
[1:16:44] uh flesh strengths when the life is
[1:16:46] gone. Watch a little animal when it's
[1:16:47] when it's uh killed on the road, it'll
[1:16:50] weigh or some of you hunters here, if
[1:16:53] you kill an animal, beef or butcher, and
[1:16:55] you lay it on the scale and weigh it
[1:16:57] now, just kill it and weigh it and in
[1:16:59] the morning weigh it again, see how many
[1:17:00] pounds lighter it is, then let it lay
[1:17:02] there for 2 or 3 days, then see how many
[1:17:04] pounds heavier it is. Well, now a growth
[1:17:06] when it dies, the demon goes out of the
[1:17:08] growth like tumor, cancer, cataract, so
[1:17:11] forth. When the demon goes out of it,
[1:17:13] which is alive, every person here come
[1:17:17] from one little germ
[1:17:19] and and you begin to develop cells and
[1:17:22] those cells uh come into as the nature
[1:17:25] of the life that was in it which made
[1:17:28] man. The cell from the dog makes the
[1:17:30] dog, the bird, the bird, ever after its
[1:17:33] nature, ever kind. But now a demon which
[1:17:36] is uh growth or it doesn't have to come
[1:17:39] in growth. It's starts developing cells.
[1:17:42] Say for instance cancer it starts to
[1:17:44] developing cells and becomes larger
[1:17:46] larger. Well now it's got a life
[1:17:49] and it's a living just the same as you
[1:17:52] was living and developing in the womb of
[1:17:54] your mother. The same thing you're
[1:17:55] developing. But now that life isn't your
[1:17:58] life. It's a different life. You've got
[1:17:59] life to live and that's a life of death
[1:18:02] or a spirit of death rather, pardon me.
[1:18:05] And it's death. Now, it doesn't belong
[1:18:07] in you. It wasn't in there before, but
[1:18:09] it's there now. Well, then who put that
[1:18:11] in there? It only has to come from one
[1:18:14] thing. That's the devil. And it's a
[1:18:17] germ. Cancer, tumor, any of those things
[1:18:19] come from a germ. And you come from a
[1:18:20] germ, too. See? So when that dies
[1:18:26] for instance like cataracts the person's
[1:18:28] got cataracts when the spirit leaves the
[1:18:31] people say oh I can see I can see and
[1:18:33] the next day they can see much better
[1:18:35] well then about after about 72 hours
[1:18:37] corruption that's in like the
[1:18:39] resurrection of Jesus now the cells
[1:18:41] didn't corrupt you raised before the
[1:18:42] three days night of course you see died
[1:18:44] on Friday afternoon raised Sunday
[1:18:45] morning because David said I'll not
[1:18:47] leave his soul in hell neither I suffer
[1:18:48] from the holy one to see corruption
[1:18:50] those cells begin to break in 72 heart
[1:18:52] and uh but and then when the patient
[1:18:54] when that begins to swell that growth
[1:18:56] getting bigger they'll of course your
[1:18:59] heart has to purify the bloodstream. A
[1:19:01] lady came to me last night, a very
[1:19:03] faintly godly looking woman with a big
[1:19:05] cancer that she said she come in the
[1:19:07] line and said it was all covered over
[1:19:08] her hair and said I stood looked at her
[1:19:10] and told her under the spirit she had
[1:19:11] cancer in her head but said it was going
[1:19:14] to come off and it come off and she's
[1:19:15] got it here I guess tonight. You're in a
[1:19:16] bottle of alcohol right here now. We've
[1:19:18] had thousands of them. Is the woman in
[1:19:20] the building? Would you stand up? If the
[1:19:22] woman's anywhere in the building with
[1:19:23] that cancer in the alcohol if she's
[1:19:25] anywhere in the building is she's
[1:19:27] standing up wave your hand or something
[1:19:28] so someone would see you. Uh yeah,
[1:19:31] there's the lady standing there. Okay.
[1:19:33] And um I've seen him stand right on the
[1:19:36] platform, just turn white and drop right
[1:19:38] off on a platform. See, now that's a
[1:19:40] miracle. Usually when the little growth
[1:19:43] is dead, the life goes out of it. But
[1:19:46] the growth, if it can't drop off, it's
[1:19:47] on the inside. And if it does, of
[1:19:50] course, it'll lay there for a few days
[1:19:52] and begin to swell up like any other
[1:19:54] flesh. The cells will begin to break.
[1:19:56] Then you get real sick with a fever. Of
[1:19:57] course, it's an infection like the heart
[1:20:00] pumps the blood and purifies the body.
[1:20:02] There's a big lump of flesh laying loose
[1:20:04] in your body. The patient gets violently
[1:20:06] sick. Then they say, "Oh,
[1:20:09] I felt so good when on the platform and
[1:20:11] for a day or two, but I guess I've lost
[1:20:13] my healing." Why brother, sister, that's
[1:20:15] the best sign in the world you've got
[1:20:16] your healing. See, and then you start
[1:20:19] disbelieving. And just as sure as your
[1:20:21] faith taking the life away, your
[1:20:23] unbelief will bring it back again. It
[1:20:26] will. It'll resurrect him. Remember
[1:20:27] Jesus said when the unclean spirit's
[1:20:29] gone out of the man, he walks in dry
[1:20:30] places. Then he returns with seven other
[1:20:32] spirits. Is that right? And the So let
[1:20:35] the good man of the house faith fear. No
[1:20:37] matter how you feel, it ain't what you
[1:20:38] feel, it's what you believe.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus never did say, "Did you feel it?"
[1:20:42] He said, "Did you believe it?" That was
[1:20:45] God bless you. All right. Now, let's
[1:20:47] see. I believe that was 100 prayer cards
[1:20:49] he gave out last night. And why? We
[1:20:51] never got to all of them. Let's take the
[1:20:53] last 15 of them tonight to try. Who has
[1:20:55] prayer card 80? That' be Oh, 85. Who has
[1:20:59] prayer card 85? Would you raise your
[1:21:01] hand as somebody here somewhere in the
[1:21:03] prayer card 85? All right. 86. Who has
[1:21:06] prayer card 86? All right. 87.
[1:21:10] 87.
[1:21:11] Do I see someone with prayer card 87,
[1:21:14] please? If you would you stand up. 80
[1:21:18] or 87 is what? See somebody maybe can't
[1:21:21] get up. Maybe they're on a stretcher.
[1:21:23] Maybe they're deaf. And and they say,
[1:21:25] "Well, no one helped me." And I I get
[1:21:27] the backy of it in my office. They say,
[1:21:30] "Well, I was there." And and you just
[1:21:32] said, "Uh, from so and so to so and so,
[1:21:34] and nobody helped me." And maybe he was
[1:21:35] deaf. Now, look, we got 85, 86, 87. Look
[1:21:39] on your neighbor's card and see he may
[1:21:41] be deaf. He can't hear. 87. Thank you,
[1:21:45] sister. 88. Who has 88? Prayer card. 88.
[1:21:48] Is it in the village? 88. All right. 89.
[1:21:52] is player card. 89. Can you get up? 89.
[1:21:56] Is it hand up for 89? All right. 89. All
[1:22:00] right. 90.
[1:22:02] 90.
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:12] And no matter what he says do, you do
[1:22:15] it. Just do it. Just just you go do just
[1:22:18] what it says do. Now I'm your brother
[1:22:20] and just a man. Now if he will come and
[1:22:25] and take this for frame and blessed
[1:22:31] enough to let his holy spirit work
[1:22:33] through it. Then you'll see Jesus Christ
[1:22:35] moving in the audience. And now, no
[1:22:38] matter how much he would vindicate
[1:22:39] himself here, if you don't believe him,
[1:22:42] he can't do nothing for you. Is that
[1:22:44] right?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; No matter if he'd stand right here by my
[1:22:47] side, visibly as you could see, well, if
[1:22:50] you didn't believe me, I couldn't do
[1:22:52] nothing for you. But my my words will be
[1:22:56] just what he has said out of his
[1:22:58] scripture. And I'll pray with all my
[1:23:00] heart that God will help you. cuz
[1:23:03] there'll be probably mothers and dads
[1:23:05] and so forth in here that's that's sick
[1:23:07] and afflicted and needy and I'll ask God
[1:23:10] to help you the best of my knowledge.
[1:23:12] All right, line up over here on the
[1:23:13] right. Now, let's all bow our heads just
[1:23:15] a moment. Kind father, we pray in the
[1:23:18] name of thy son Jesus. May the Holy
[1:23:21] Spirit come now and manifest the works
[1:23:24] of Jesus Christ. Bless these people
[1:23:26] everywhere and make them to be whole.
[1:23:30] Make them well. make them healthy,
[1:23:32] happy, and now in order to do this,
[1:23:35] Father, thou knowest the frail and uh th
[1:23:40] of thy servant. And I I don't know what
[1:23:43] to say or what to do. And now I have did
[1:23:46] this all at thy command. And I believe
[1:23:49] that you will be here tonight to bless
[1:23:52] and to help these people. And father, if
[1:23:55] you'll just let the Holy Spirit come to
[1:23:57] your servant and reveal these things to
[1:24:00] us, what we should do and how we should
[1:24:02] do them, then we will all be happy and
[1:24:06] rejoice. And this audience will believe
[1:24:08] on you with one heart and a heart. And
[1:24:10] Father, I ask you this as your servant.
[1:24:14] Let not one feeble person leave this
[1:24:16] building tonight. May they everyone go
[1:24:19] well and healthy and rejoicing.
[1:24:22] do it will you father I pray with grace
[1:24:26] in my heart and faith in Jesus Christ's
[1:24:28] name amen
[1:24:31] now many times is there someone on those
[1:24:36] lights someone at the lights that could
[1:24:38] move them now sometimes this Holy Spirit
[1:24:44] it comes and many of you seen this
[1:24:46] picture if I ever come again I'll bring
[1:24:47] you some of them as brother Moore was
[1:24:49] telling tonight it's been taken several
[1:24:52] times and in the books, I guess you all
[1:24:54] got them. We I only had two boxes. So, I
[1:24:57] uh I hope you enjoy them real well. And
[1:25:01] um they you look in there, you'll see
[1:25:03] another picture of it where it settled
[1:25:04] down in a newspaper photographer caught
[1:25:06] that one in Camden, Arkansas, but it
[1:25:08] wasn't authentic like this American
[1:25:10] Association. And they they got it and it
[1:25:13] was then it became authentic. So we and
[1:25:17] many thousands of people. I was standing
[1:25:19] on the river here some time ago
[1:25:21] baptizing 500 after a revival and it
[1:25:24] come right down where I was standing and
[1:25:26] people fainted and just there where it
[1:25:28] was and it was just like a roar noise of
[1:25:31] whipping fire. I pray that God will come
[1:25:33] visible before the audience tonight in
[1:25:35] that manner here. It's a capital once
[1:25:37] more glory if I can find favor with God.
[1:25:40] Now you realize it could come to some
[1:25:43] eyes and wouldn't to others. We don't
[1:25:45] want to think that, but it does. John
[1:25:47] was the one who bare record seeing the
[1:25:49] spirit of God over Jesus. Is that right?
[1:25:51] Never said the And the wise men followed
[1:25:54] a star. Do you believe that?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And it passed over every observatory in
[1:25:58] the land. Always in the orients
[1:26:01] and months are coming. And they kept
[1:26:03] time for the stars. They watched all
[1:26:05] night long. They kept time. And no one
[1:26:07] ever saw it. But the wise man did. For
[1:26:10] they were looking for it. You'd be
[1:26:13] looking for Christ tonight. You'll see
[1:26:14] him. The Lord Jesus bless you. All
[1:26:17] right.
[1:26:19] Billy, Paul, Brother Moore, somebody is
[1:26:22] ever is ready. All
[1:26:25] is got the whole line lined up. Billy,
[1:26:27] the whole 15. All 15 lined up.
[1:26:31] Now, to the rest of you, try the ones
[1:26:34] that hasn't got a prayer card and know
[1:26:37] you won't be in the line. I want you to
[1:26:38] look this way and just believe. And you
[1:26:41] believe with the same kind of faith that
[1:26:42] that woman had touched his garment and
[1:26:44] he turned and said, "Thy faith has saved
[1:26:47] thee." Do you believe he's the same
[1:26:49] tonight?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in all that howling mob,
[1:26:52] that poor little old blind man sitting
[1:26:54] down to the walls of Jericho, probably
[1:26:56] twice the distance of his building, a
[1:26:58] scream and a hollering, "Have mercy on
[1:26:59] me." Jesus perhaps never heard his call,
[1:27:03] but he felt his faith had moved and all
[1:27:07] that bunch of critics. And he turned and
[1:27:09] said, "Thy faith has saved thee." He
[1:27:11] turned into the audience and said
[1:27:12] differently, "Why reason ye in your
[1:27:14] heart?" Said to the woman at the well,
[1:27:16] "Go get your husband." And he said, "I
[1:27:19] can do nothing except the father shows
[1:27:21] me."
[1:27:26] I asked you something.
[1:27:29] If what I have said is the truth, if it
[1:27:32] is the truth, then God's obligated
[1:27:36] to his word. Not to me, but to his word.
[1:27:38] Is that right?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He's obligated to his word.
[1:27:43] And then he will bring that to pass just
[1:27:45] exactly the way he said he would do it.
[1:27:48] And if he does do it, will all of you
[1:27:52] then in here, if you haven't received
[1:27:54] Jesus Christ, would you be willing to do
[1:27:57] it? And you that you're that can see his
[1:27:59] mercy to others, he will have mercy to
[1:28:02] you if you'll just have faith and
[1:28:05] believe. Just pray and say, "Lord, I I'm
[1:28:09] a believer and I want you to heal me
[1:28:11] tonight and God will do it." We have
[1:28:15] just left Africa recently where I'm to
[1:28:18] return again in the next few weeks.
[1:28:21] Africa, India, Palestine, Germany and
[1:28:25] the ministry
[1:28:27] and at Durban, South Africa after about
[1:28:31] three or four people had passed through
[1:28:33] the prayer line and they seen the power
[1:28:36] of the Holy Spirit moving in the people
[1:28:39] and seen what God was doing, 30,000
[1:28:42] accepted Jesus as personal savior in one
[1:28:44] altar call.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; 30,000 at one time.
[1:28:49] So I believe if we'll take God's word as
[1:28:52] the rule
[1:28:55] and go into all the world and preach the
[1:28:57] gospel, the gospel came not in word only
[1:28:59] but through power and demonstration of
[1:29:01] the Holy Spirit. So the the gospel is
[1:29:05] demonstrating the power of the Holy
[1:29:07] Spirit. I've went into nations that say,
[1:29:10] "Now we don't want missionaries. We know
[1:29:12] more about it than you do." But the
[1:29:15] thing we want to see is somebody that's
[1:29:17] got faith enough to make God's word
[1:29:19] manifest. That's what they want to see.
[1:29:22] And that's how they get converted.
[1:29:25] That's how they find Christ is because
[1:29:28] they they believe in that manner.
[1:29:31] And I trust to God with all my heart
[1:29:34] that there will be many many here
[1:29:36] tonight who will find Christ the same to
[1:29:39] their hearts. May the Lord Jesus of
[1:29:42] Nazareth bless each and every one of you
[1:29:45] is my prayer.
[1:29:48] Now, okay.
[1:29:51] No man seeks God at any time. God seeks
[1:29:55] man.
[1:29:56] Never did a man seek God in all the
[1:29:58] world. God seeking man. When man first
[1:30:02] fell in the garden of Eden, it showed
[1:30:04] the strain of man. Man hid. God was
[1:30:06] hunting man. Jesus said, "No man can
[1:30:09] come to me except my father draws him."
[1:30:13] It has to be drawn of the father first
[1:30:15] and then I would like to explain
[1:30:18] something to you.
[1:30:20] Uh seeing a vision, how many people in
[1:30:23] here ever dreamed a dream? Let's see
[1:30:24] your hand. I guess twothirds of you.
[1:30:28] There is true that many people doesn't
[1:30:30] dream. That's your subconscious. We're
[1:30:32] taught here's your first conscience.
[1:30:34] Here's your subconscious. Now this
[1:30:36] subconscience is what I'm trying uh with
[1:30:39] the Holy Spirit to work on this first
[1:30:42] conscience. I might ask this man here,
[1:30:44] any man along here somewhere, do you
[1:30:46] believe? Oh yes, sir. You believe it
[1:30:48] here? Or what about this man down here?
[1:30:51] He's the one that runs the ship, not the
[1:30:53] man up in the pilot house. It's the man
[1:30:55] in the engine room. Sometimes when you
[1:30:57] go to sleep, you go into this
[1:30:59] subconscious and you dream.
[1:31:02] And you dream of things you did when you
[1:31:04] were here.
[1:31:06] Then when you wake up, you remember
[1:31:08] things that you dreamed. You people had
[1:31:10] dreams many years ago. You dreamed them.
[1:31:13] You still remembered. Well, there was
[1:31:15] some part of you somewhere. Isn't that
[1:31:18] right? Or you wouldn't remember
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; something that you dreamed many years
[1:31:22] ago. Now the man who sleeps sound, his
[1:31:25] subconscious is way back. It never gets
[1:31:27] to him. But a seer,
[1:31:30] his subconscious is not back there.
[1:31:32] Neither is it here. It's right here. He
[1:31:36] doesn't go to sleep. He's got his eyes
[1:31:38] open and he just sees. Now that
[1:31:43] God gave that man a place where he could
[1:31:45] sleep sound and not dream. God gave man
[1:31:48] the way to dream dreams. I'd say dream
[1:31:50] me a dream. You couldn't do it.
[1:31:53] And then God, what's in the church?
[1:31:55] Stum, apostles, prophets, gifts of
[1:31:59] healing. Is that right? They're all for
[1:32:01] the perfecting of the church.
[1:32:04] Paul said, "If there come, if you all
[1:32:06] speak with tongues and the unlearned
[1:32:08] comes in, won't he say you're all mad?"
[1:32:11] But if one prophesies and reveals the
[1:32:14] secrets of the heart, won't they fall
[1:32:16] down and say, "Truly, God is with you."
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Is that the gospel?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Well, wasn't that Jesus Christ
[1:32:23] yesterday,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; isn't he? Today,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; you can believe him by speaking with
[1:32:27] tongues.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; You can believe him by the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:30] And I believe him in the full measure
[1:32:31] that he is the same Lord Jesus. He's not
[1:32:35] dead. He rose from the dead and here
[1:32:38] tonight
[1:32:39] here at the platform now.
[1:32:43] And may he bless and help. I've never
[1:32:46] been in this country before. And as far
[1:32:49] as I know, there's not a living soul
[1:32:50] that I can see before me that I know.
[1:32:53] Very few here on the platform. Brother
[1:32:55] Boza, I remember him. I've seen the man
[1:32:58] there next to him. I don't remember his
[1:33:00] name, but and I, brother Lindsay, just a
[1:33:03] maybe three or four ministers sitting
[1:33:05] here that I know in the building, but
[1:33:08] God knows all of you. Is that true?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; He knows all of you.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Now, this lady standing here, God in
[1:33:14] heaven knows. I never seen her in my
[1:33:15] life as I know of.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Are we strangers, lady? Yes, we are
[1:33:19] perfect strangers.
[1:33:21] But God knows her. Now, if Jesus is the
[1:33:26] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:33:28] let's change a picture now. What he was
[1:33:30] yesterday when he was going to find out
[1:33:32] something about a woman, he said, "Bring
[1:33:34] me a dream." She said, "Wow, it's not
[1:33:39] customary for this to happen in Jews and
[1:33:41] so forth with the Samaritans." But Jesus
[1:33:43] speaking to her a little while, he found
[1:33:45] just where her trouble was. Is that
[1:33:46] right?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Well, now Jesus has risen from the dead
[1:33:50] now as living in us tonight. A little
[1:33:54] while the world sees me no more, yet you
[1:33:57] shall see me. For I I is the personal
[1:34:00] pronoun. I will be with you, even in you
[1:34:03] to the end of the world. That's the
[1:34:05] gospel truth. You might not have read it
[1:34:07] that way or thought of it that way, but
[1:34:09] that's the way it's written in the
[1:34:10] Bible. That's your theology might have
[1:34:13] bypassed it somewhere, but that's the
[1:34:15] way it's written in the Bible. I will be
[1:34:18] with you, even in you to the end of the
[1:34:20] world. Now,
[1:34:23] uh, you know, I'm waiting for something
[1:34:25] that is true. It's the angel of the law.
[1:34:28] That's true. I'm just as helpless as it
[1:34:30] could be, just like any of the rest of
[1:34:31] you. And I'm here perhaps as critics
[1:34:33] sitting here. How many ever seen his
[1:34:34] picture? Not of my meetings have seen
[1:34:36] where the scientific taken this picture.
[1:34:39] The great light. It comes in. You can
[1:34:41] watch it. Yes, many of you. It's all
[1:34:44] thousands of copies of it been sold so
[1:34:47] forth. The Douglas Studios in Houston,
[1:34:49] Texas has it where George J. Lacy the
[1:34:52] one of the best in the research in
[1:34:54] America taking everything to see it
[1:34:56] wasn't double exposure or something. And
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ vindicated himself as being
[1:35:01] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:35:04] Now, of course, I wait for him. Whether
[1:35:07] he will help me tonight, I do not know.
[1:35:10] And if I have said anything boastfully
[1:35:12] or anything that I've said out of the
[1:35:14] way, may God forgive me. I wouldn't mean
[1:35:16] to do it. I only mean with humbleness of
[1:35:19] heart to represent Jesus Christ who's
[1:35:21] listening to me now. And may his mercy
[1:35:24] be here tonight being I've spoke these
[1:35:26] things and that being his word. May he
[1:35:28] come and help us is my prayer. And now
[1:35:31] as the organ is here somewhere, if you
[1:35:34] will slowly please real low the song
[1:35:38] only believe. And everybody please be in
[1:35:40] a a mood of prayer if you will. You
[1:35:42] don't have to bow your heads let your
[1:35:43] ass now in the prayer line you that's
[1:35:46] coming what be if he rebukes you must if
[1:35:51] it's it'll be the truth if it is you
[1:35:53] must be willing to stand it in the
[1:35:55] audience anywhere if he says you must
[1:35:57] know it's not me it's him and go make it
[1:35:59] right the first thing you can do before
[1:36:02] you can find a cure you've got to find
[1:36:04] the cause before you can find a cure if
[1:36:07] you go to a doctor sick and upset and he
[1:36:09] gives you an aspirin he's not a good
[1:36:11] doctor, he's trying to get rid of you.
[1:36:13] If he's a good doctor, he'll diagnose
[1:36:15] the case till he finds the trouble and
[1:36:16] then start working from there. That's
[1:36:18] the same thing we have to do here. If an
[1:36:20] evil spirit, if there's unconfessed sin
[1:36:22] or something or some out of the will of
[1:36:24] God, you can anoint them all night long
[1:36:26] and cry and scream and do all you wish
[1:36:28] to. That demon will stay right there.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. He has a right to.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; But that's what you have to watch. God
[1:36:36] has put a curse on somebody for
[1:36:38] something, then you come along and take
[1:36:39] it off. You get in trouble like Moses
[1:36:41] did. That's right. Peace, the Holy
[1:36:44] Spirit.
[1:36:45] Now, in the name of Jesus Christ, the
[1:36:47] son of God, I take every person in here
[1:36:50] under my control for God's glory.
[1:36:55] Now, I want to talk to you a minute,
[1:36:56] sister.
[1:36:58] You're conscious that something's going
[1:37:00] on. Of course, it's just now happened.
[1:37:03] Now, if that is true, let the people see
[1:37:04] by your left lifted hand. That's right.
[1:37:06] See, if that's that prayer, that's
[1:37:08] right. See, now I I'm a stranger to you,
[1:37:12] never seen in my life. And now, if the
[1:37:15] Holy Spirit that I have spoke of of
[1:37:17] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:37:19] and forever. If I have truly witnessed
[1:37:22] that to the people and declared it to be
[1:37:26] the truth and he is the saint, then he
[1:37:30] will reveal to me something to you that
[1:37:34] would help you to believe him. If you're
[1:37:36] here, I don't know what you have need of
[1:37:38] whether uh but he does. Now, if God will
[1:37:42] permit that, would you accept your
[1:37:44] healing and or or whatever it is you
[1:37:46] want, finance or whatever it is you're
[1:37:47] here to seek him for, to ask him about
[1:37:50] or domestic troubles, whatever it might
[1:37:52] be, whatever it is, he'll know and he'll
[1:37:55] be able to let me know. Is that right?
[1:37:57] Right.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And that would make him the same as he
[1:37:59] talked to the woman at the well. Now,
[1:38:01] I'm only talking to you like he did to
[1:38:02] contact your spirit and I see you moving
[1:38:05] from you.
[1:38:07] You're
[1:38:09] you're You've had a I see a great crash
[1:38:12] of some sort. It's an accident.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And you it was a car wreck and you were
[1:38:17] thrown in the air like that.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And it strains you in somewhere in your
[1:38:21] neck. It's caused a a cancer to come
[1:38:23] into your neck or
[1:38:27] and you're some sort of a teach in the
[1:38:29] scripture and you believe that Jesus
[1:38:32] Christ makes you well.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:38:36] Father God, in the name of thy son Jesus
[1:38:40] Christ
[1:38:42] on the authority of God's word by a
[1:38:45] dying woman, I ask this evil thing to
[1:38:49] leave her. Satan, you are exposed. So
[1:38:53] come out of the woman as the church of
[1:38:55] the living God calls for you to leave in
[1:38:58] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Now, just for just a moment,
[1:39:05] I just want to talk to you. Of course,
[1:39:07] you know it's gone now. It'll stay that
[1:39:09] way. See how your throat left?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; It's all gone from her. The guarder has
[1:39:15] left her throat and she God bless you.
[1:39:18] Go on your road now and be thankful,
[1:39:20] happy, and rejoice and be fine.
[1:39:24] Now, just have faith in the Lord Jesus.
[1:39:28] Make him into your center of your
[1:39:29] thought right now. the Lord Jesus. As
[1:39:32] you think on these things,
[1:39:35] while they were thinking on these
[1:39:37] things, they were one accord.
[1:39:40] Remember Jesus the same yesterday,
[1:39:43] today,
[1:39:45] and forever.
[1:39:47] He is the same today. Now have faith.
[1:39:51] Watch this way audience and believe with
[1:39:53] all your heart and give me your
[1:39:54] undivided attention. Be in prayer.
[1:39:59] Keep faith in God.
[1:40:11] Now I believe this is the lady. Is this
[1:40:13] the patient?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Come near, sister.
[1:40:18] Of course, that won't hurt you now.
[1:40:19] That's that's just his presence that
[1:40:22] you're conscious of. And I an audience
[1:40:27] I I'm
[1:40:29] your brother. I This is not psychology.
[1:40:33] I felt that coming from the audience. It
[1:40:34] isn't. It's almighty God. See, you see
[1:40:38] it's not psychology. No, it is. Now,
[1:40:41] don't do that. Just think of being the
[1:40:43] Lord Jesus. See, and want a card.
[1:40:46] Now, sister, I just want to speak with
[1:40:48] you just a moment. We're strangers, I
[1:40:50] suppose. But Jesus Christ knows the both
[1:40:54] of us. This is our first time meeting on
[1:40:57] earth,
[1:40:58] but he knows you and he's fed you all
[1:41:01] your life. And he knows me. And if I,
[1:41:05] your brother,
[1:41:07] and by his grace, by a divine gift that
[1:41:11] I had nothing to do with the coming when
[1:41:13] I was born a little baby, the first
[1:41:16] thing I can remember was a vision. Now,
[1:41:22] I want you to look this way just a
[1:41:24] moment.
[1:41:26] Of course, you're sick
[1:41:28] and you're suffering with a condition.
[1:41:31] It's a it's a dark spirit around you.
[1:41:34] It's death and it's in a form of cancer.
[1:41:39] And the cancer is located on the breast.
[1:41:43] and you're a senior examined by someone
[1:41:47] strong and it's a you got a a ruptured
[1:41:50] condition and the rupture is in the
[1:41:52] bowels and you have a stomach trouble
[1:41:56] also a severe heart trouble it caused
[1:41:59] you fainting
[1:42:01] here a few days ago you sitting sideways
[1:42:03] on the side of a bed and nearly passed
[1:42:06] out looking towards your window
[1:42:12] are those things the truth truth.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was all true.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; All true.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Or whatever it was, of course, it's gone
[1:42:18] from you. But what do you think that was
[1:42:21] that knows your lie? Was it Jesus
[1:42:24] Christ? You accept it to be that?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; You're willing. You know that something
[1:42:31] supernatural is here.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; And if you believe it to be the Lord
[1:42:34] Jesus as I have preached it out of the
[1:42:36] word and you believe it to be the Lord
[1:42:39] Jesus.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; I know there's a dark spirit. see it
[1:42:42] hanging at you yet? It's something very
[1:42:44] serious.
[1:42:46] Say, "I see you.
[1:42:49] Your name is uh Eva."
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; And your last name is York.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; And you live in this city?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; And your house number is 6136 Street. Is
[1:43:03] that right?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You're going home to be well.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, you go and
[1:43:10] be made well. God bless you. Don't just
[1:43:13] go rejoicing.
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Just have faith. Don't doubt.
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:28] The scripture has said, "Go ye and sin
[1:43:31] no more, unless the worst thing come
[1:43:34] upon you."
[1:43:36] Sin is unbelief.
[1:43:40] Sin is not drinking, smoking, gambling.
[1:43:43] That's attributes of sin. You do that
[1:43:46] because you believe not.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Go and sin or disbelieve no
[1:43:51] more or worse things will come upon
[1:43:53] you." Have faith in God,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; believing with all your heart.
[1:44:08] I see the light following that woman.
[1:44:10] Yes, that's just that that's her just
[1:44:12] left. It's hanging by a colored person
[1:44:14] there. Yes. The lady there with that
[1:44:16] gall bladder and rupture. You believe
[1:44:18] the Lord Jesus make you well. Lady
[1:44:20] sitting there that white thing around
[1:44:22] your neck. If you believe it with all
[1:44:23] your heart, you may raise up and claim
[1:44:26] your healing and be made well in the
[1:44:27] name of the Lord Jesus. God bless you.
[1:44:31] Have faith.
[1:44:33] in God.
[1:44:36] Does thou believe.
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:47] You have a rupture, don't you, sir,
[1:44:49] sitting out there. Isn't that right? She
[1:44:50] was sitting there praying, "Lord, have
[1:44:52] that man speak to me." Is that right? If
[1:44:54] that's right, raise up your hands. Stand
[1:44:56] up on your feet. Your faith has healed
[1:44:58] you, brother. Go home. Jesus Christ
[1:45:00] makes you well.
[1:45:04] the same Lord Jesus. You don't need to
[1:45:06] be up here. You need to have faith.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Just believe God with all your heart and
[1:45:13] you shall have what you ask for. Jesus
[1:45:16] Christ will grant you if you will only
[1:45:19] believe. But you must have faith. You
[1:45:23] must believe him with all your heart and
[1:45:25] God will bring it to pass.
[1:45:30] the patient. Excuse me, sir.
[1:45:37] Do you believe with all your heart?
[1:45:40] You do. Now, you're just a bit excited
[1:45:44] because of the presence of his being
[1:45:47] standing here. And um
[1:45:52] I believe you're from out of town.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; You come from a capital, too. Richmond,
[1:45:58] Virginia. You have a cancer. It's in
[1:46:00] your inside of your mouth, on your jaw.
[1:46:02] Is that right?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; You want to go home and be well. Accept
[1:46:06] Jesus as your healer. And in the name of
[1:46:08] Jesus Christ, may it leave the man. Go
[1:46:11] away from
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you here. Go believing having
[1:46:16] faith with all.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; What he say? I know now that seeing you,
[1:46:24] you're becoming a youngl looking person,
[1:46:28] much younger than what you are in my
[1:46:30] presence.
[1:46:32] You are suffering with some sort of a
[1:46:36] headache
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; and it's u it's come many years ago
[1:46:40] about 25 years ago your headache started
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; and it's been bothering you ever since.
[1:46:46] You have been a great believer and you
[1:46:49] have you have prayed for this hour
[1:46:51] that's standing here now. You've said in
[1:46:54] prayer to God that if you could uh only
[1:46:57] get to me that if I would pray that your
[1:47:01] headaches would cease
[1:47:06] those things true
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; everything
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; that is true now you heard what said
[1:47:12] that that wasn't me that was just my
[1:47:14] voice was those ever what it was is
[1:47:17] something I I remember seeing a young
[1:47:18] person or something was it just the way
[1:47:20] it was said there just the said, "Now,
[1:47:23] you believe that God did it. You believe
[1:47:25] God did it." Now,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; you're sure that God is here. Just a
[1:47:31] moment. I see something else. A young
[1:47:34] woman seems to be standing near you.
[1:47:37] It's a It's a daughter. And um Yes, you
[1:47:41] were just fixing to go on a trip
[1:47:43] somewhere. You were going to see her.
[1:47:45] And she's from Indiana. Richmond,
[1:47:48] Indiana is where she lives. and she her
[1:47:51] husband is a minister and she has wrote
[1:47:54] you a letter or something telling you
[1:47:56] not to come because I was coming here.
[1:47:58] Is that right? You're healed. You can go
[1:48:01] on.
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:14] Now only believe. Have faith in God.
[1:48:19] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:48:21] and forever. And now
[1:48:25] just have faith and believe.
[1:48:29] God, God bless. You hear colored people
[1:48:31] shouting.
[1:48:33] He He is always ready to help and to
[1:48:37] believe to help the people in need. Just
[1:48:41] a moment. the lady
[1:48:44] now. I see the Holy Spirit standing in a
[1:48:47] corner.
[1:48:49] It's uh over a colored lady. She's
[1:48:52] looking this way. She has been and she's
[1:48:54] praying. She has a growth and that
[1:48:58] growth is in her throat.
[1:49:01] She's got her hand up. You accept your
[1:49:03] healing lady?
[1:49:05] The lady standing right behind you there
[1:49:08] also? She has a growth in his inner
[1:49:10] shoulder. Is that right, lady? Both of
[1:49:13] you, stand on your feet right now. The
[1:49:15] two ladies right there with the girls on
[1:49:16] the two-color lady. Jesus Christ healed
[1:49:20] you both. You can go home and be made
[1:49:21] well for God's glory. Your faith has
[1:49:24] healed you. God bless you. It's gone.
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:29] Have faith in God.
[1:49:32] Do not disbelieve,
[1:49:34] but believe that all things are possible
[1:49:37] to them that does believe.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:46] My, what a faith bank in the building.
[1:49:48] It looks real milky out over the
[1:49:50] building. You are certainly in the
[1:49:53] spirit of the Lord now. Anything could
[1:49:56] happen.
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:00] How do you do lady?
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[1:50:08] It's I mean, well, a prophet is a
[1:50:10] preacher. You don't expect me to be of
[1:50:13] the enemy. You expect me to be of God.
[1:50:15] Is that's the way you accept it? Well,
[1:50:17] then I can help you. For he told me if I
[1:50:20] would get the people to believe me and
[1:50:22] be sincere when I prayed that nothing
[1:50:24] would stand before the prayer. And now
[1:50:28] it isn't uh I that helps. It's God that
[1:50:32] does the healing. I question I said they
[1:50:35] won't believe me. He said there'll be
[1:50:37] two signs given to you as was to the
[1:50:39] prophet Moses. In this the people will
[1:50:42] believe and one of them was to reveal
[1:50:45] the secrets of the hearts of the people
[1:50:47] to them. Now you're not here for
[1:50:50] yourself. Although you're nervous and
[1:50:52] run down, but it's been caused by a
[1:50:54] disease of this child. This child here
[1:50:57] is suffering. It's been turned down by
[1:50:59] the doctors to die. It's leukemia.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? You brought the child
[1:51:06] from out of town. You've traveled coming
[1:51:09] from the west coming east. You have
[1:51:12] come. You've come from a a state that
[1:51:15] has mountains. It's Pennsylvania. And
[1:51:18] your city, I believe it's Chambersburg.
[1:51:20] Isn't that right? Bring the child to me.
[1:51:23] Little sister, dear, the Lord Jesus was
[1:51:27] sure he'd lay his hands upon you and
[1:51:30] death would leave you and you'd live. Do
[1:51:33] you believe that I am his servant?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Then in hisstead, I lay my hands on this
[1:51:38] child and bless it and ask that the
[1:51:43] demon leaves the child and that life
[1:51:46] comes to the child and it will live and
[1:51:48] be well. Come out of the child, Satan,
[1:51:52] by the authority of God's Bible with a
[1:51:54] divine gift ministered by an angel. I
[1:51:57] adure thee to leave the child. Come from
[1:52:00] the
[1:52:02] you get well. God bless you. Turn
[1:52:05] around. Wave to the audience.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you. The little girl with
[1:52:09] tremendous faith. Be well. God bless
[1:52:12] you. Honey go. You write your letter. Do
[1:52:15] you believe me as his prophet as his
[1:52:18] servant? Do you believe that God is near
[1:52:21] in his spirit and this which is now
[1:52:23] being done is of the Lord Jesus, not me.
[1:52:26] I'm a man. Yeah. If God will let me know
[1:52:29] what's wrong with you as a vindication
[1:52:31] that I am his prophet standing here
[1:52:33] revealing the truth as he said to the
[1:52:35] woman, "Go get your husband." She said,
[1:52:37] "I have none." He said, "You have five."
[1:52:40] She said, "I see you're a prophet." See,
[1:52:42] I perceive that you're a prophet. Now
[1:52:44] that same spirit that was on that son of
[1:52:47] God, he promised to send it back in the
[1:52:50] form of the Holy Ghost that would be
[1:52:51] with us and dwell with us to the end of
[1:52:53] the world. You believe it? If he can
[1:52:55] know your troubles now, can he? You got
[1:52:57] heart trouble. Is that right? Every
[1:52:59] person with heart trouble stand to your
[1:53:01] feet. You can be healed right now. No
[1:53:04] matter what it is, the heart trouble.
[1:53:06] Lord God, thou knowest our strength and
[1:53:09] how feeble we are and how weak and but
[1:53:12] Lord, we know how strong you are. And
[1:53:15] heart trouble is something our doctors
[1:53:16] cannot do anything by. But Lord, who
[1:53:19] made the heart? You did. And I now
[1:53:22] rebuke this demon power is holding these
[1:53:24] people to heart trouble. May it come out
[1:53:26] of every one of them in the name of
[1:53:28] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you,
[1:53:31] sister. I just want to say something to
[1:53:33] you. You feel different now than you
[1:53:35] felt in a long time, haven't you? I told
[1:53:37] the people know there's a real dark
[1:53:39] spirit. You had bad stuff when you lay
[1:53:41] down
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and now it's gone from you.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; You're healed. You I just
[1:53:47] You are all right.
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God, please.
[1:54:00] Everyone with one accord. Have faith.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; How do you do, sir? All right. Us being
[1:54:07] strangers one to another, but the Lord
[1:54:08] Jesus knows us both. Is that right? The
[1:54:11] God of heaven, who created the heavens
[1:54:13] and earth dwelt in Jesus Christ,
[1:54:15] promised to return again in us. And what
[1:54:18] he done, we do also. Do you believe me
[1:54:21] to be his prophet? The reason I say
[1:54:23] that, the angel of the Lord told me, get
[1:54:24] the people to believe you. And if they
[1:54:27] won't believe you, then you'll know the
[1:54:28] very secrets of their heart, and they'll
[1:54:30] have to believe it then. But you do
[1:54:32] believe me. And besides the reason that
[1:54:34] you do believe me, you are a minister of
[1:54:37] the gospel yourself. And you're here for
[1:54:39] a good cause. You're not sick. You're in
[1:54:41] need. And you want an oldfashioned
[1:54:43] revival to break in your community.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; That's what you're
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Every one of us wants that. Let's all
[1:54:50] stand for an old fashioned revival.
[1:54:53] Almighty God who has created heavens and
[1:54:56] earth. I ask now that every demon power
[1:54:59] in this building go the power of Jesus
[1:55:02] Christ be made manifest. Lord we but
[1:55:06] we're not defeated. Satan Iure thee in
[1:55:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Come
[1:55:12] out of the people. Stand up you
[1:55:15] people out of the wheelchairs. Give him
[1:55:17] praise everyone.
[1:55:24] Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Lift your hands and keep praising God.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Whatever your needs are, receive him.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:58] That's how God
[1:56:00] presented himself.
[1:56:04] And
[1:56:09] we can't be the prophet. We can't have
[1:56:12] that gift. But we can have that faith.
[1:56:17] We can't have that nature.
[1:56:19] And I I I know the film kind of breaks
[1:56:23] up a little bit and takes some of that,
[1:56:26] but he probably sat there for an hour
[1:56:28] and a half
[1:56:30] just waiting on the Lord.
[1:56:33] But when he came,
[1:56:37] you could see what he did, what he knew,
[1:56:40] what he was. That's the foundation and
[1:56:44] that's the spirit
[1:56:48] from which the word came.
[1:56:51] So when you have all the sermons we have
[1:56:54] choosing of a bride, God of this evil
[1:56:57] age, Christ the mystery of God revealed,
[1:57:01] the third exodus, uh the rapture,
[1:57:04] thirst, you name them. This is the
[1:57:07] source,
[1:57:09] the fountain from what that word's come.
[1:57:13] And you just can't go in there and take
[1:57:15] those words, separate them from the
[1:57:20] voice that gave them,
[1:57:24] put it in a more fashionable
[1:57:27] manner, something more appealing and
[1:57:31] more exciting
[1:57:33] and and and place it out there like this
[1:57:37] is oldfashioned.
[1:57:39] Then that's what he said. You believe me
[1:57:41] to be God's prophet? In other words, you
[1:57:44] believe that this is God. This isn't of
[1:57:46] the enemy. And and and
[1:57:53] like I said before and
[1:57:58] is that if we lose that
[1:58:01] then generations going to come and if
[1:58:03] the Lord carries the next generation and
[1:58:05] next and pretty soon we'll be so far
[1:58:07] away. people will be putting quotes
[1:58:10] together and ideas together and and and
[1:58:13] things together and and in just my
[1:58:17] lifetime I've seen several movements
[1:58:20] come on the scene. I've seen the people
[1:58:23] that believed in the seven thunders and
[1:58:25] what they were they were expecting
[1:58:27] something to happen. I've seen the
[1:58:29] people that started getting and came up
[1:58:32] with two souls and and and I mean it
[1:58:36] doesn't matter all all the different
[1:58:38] things that man does. Man will always do
[1:58:41] something.
[1:58:43] But this is what God chose to weigh over
[1:58:47] his elect. What you saw was Luke 17:30,
[1:58:52] Revelations 10:7, and Malachi 4:5. just
[1:58:58] the way God unfolded it. And that's what
[1:59:02] we always want to be anchored to. That's
[1:59:04] what the what how God chose to do it.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't very flashy,
[1:59:15] but it sure was powerful.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; When he prayed,
[1:59:20] it was simple.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; He prayed. What made the difference? Not
[1:59:26] the prayer, the faith.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; It was the man in the engine room
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; that made the difference. Not the man up
[1:59:34] here,
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; but the man that's in here. If that man
[1:59:38] believes, all things are possible. And I
[1:59:42] was so pleased by the testimony that
[1:59:45] Paul put in. Felt led to go to the
[1:59:47] hospital, pray for that little child,
[1:59:51] and and she was made well.
[1:59:56] You all have that within you because he
[1:59:59] lives within you.
[2:00:02] So let's just I I guess you know my
[2:00:05] heart and I don't know how to express
[2:00:07] that. I you know I I thought that God
[2:00:10] was good in a lot of ways. Brother
[2:00:14] Orlando
[2:00:15] uh text me. He said on his way home a
[2:00:19] guy comes speeding by him on a
[2:00:21] motorcycle going about 100 miles an
[2:00:23] hour. stopped, pulled back, looked over
[2:00:27] at him, waved at him, and then got up
[2:00:30] and did a wheelie
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; out away from him.
[2:00:36] You know, you to me, I thought, "Thank
[2:00:38] you, Lord."
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Because, you know,
[2:00:42] there's a lot of pressure because it
[2:00:45] appears that I'm standing against
[2:00:48] something,
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; but I'm not standing against anything.
[2:00:52] I'm standing for what God's done.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's stand together and open
[2:00:58] our Bibles.
[2:01:11] We'll turn to Corinians the 11th
[2:01:15] chapter. We'll read a scripture. the
[2:01:18] brothers, you can go prepare your
[2:01:20] communion and bring it forward at this
[2:01:23] time.
[2:01:25] And uh we'll read in the scripture of
[2:01:28] Paul speaking to the the church. Uh
[2:01:34] and he said and he's going to pass this
[2:01:37] commandment on to the church. He says in
[2:01:40] 11:23, for I have received of the Lord
[2:01:43] that which also I deliver unto you, that
[2:01:46] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[2:01:49] he was betrayed, he took bread, and when
[2:01:52] he had given thanks, he broke it and
[2:01:54] said, Take, eat. This is my body which
[2:01:58] is broken for you.
[2:02:00] This do in remembrance of me. And after
[2:02:06] the same manner also he took the cup
[2:02:08] when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is
[2:02:11] the new testament in my blood. This do
[2:02:16] ye as often as you drink it in
[2:02:19] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[2:02:22] eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
[2:02:25] show the Lord's death till he come.
[2:02:28] Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread
[2:02:30] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:02:33] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:02:36] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[2:02:38] examine himself. And so let him eat of
[2:02:42] that bread and drink of that cup. For he
[2:02:45] that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily
[2:02:47] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[2:02:49] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[2:02:53] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:02:55] among thee, and many sleep. For if we
[2:02:58] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[2:03:00] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[2:03:03] chastened of the Lord, that we should
[2:03:06] not be condemned with the world.
[2:03:09] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[2:03:11] together, carry one for another. If any
[2:03:14] man hunger, let him eat at home. That
[2:03:17] you come not together unto condemnation,
[2:03:20] and the rest will I set in order when I
[2:03:23] come. Isn't that wonderful that we have
[2:03:25] the opportunity to judge ourselves that
[2:03:28] we won't be condemned? God bless you. If
[2:03:31] the musicians would come
[2:03:34] and the brothers would come,
[2:03:39] we'll pray over
