[Music] la h [Music] h [Music] I yeah [Music] I [Music] I h [Music] h [Music] ah [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] oh I [Music] a h h [Music] why don't we all just stand we'll invite brother Tim to come and open our service in prayer and we'll have our Psalm reading as we're just looking as this will be our last Services as we close out the year and enter into a new year I'm looking forward to What the Lord Has for us [Music] amen good morning welcome to the house of the Lord man I don't know what the the saying is that you know you're under the weather I don't know what that really means but I'm determined this morning to be over the weather amen let's just bow our heads we go to the Lord in prayer our great ious and kind Heavenly Father Lord as our brothers said we come together Lord at the end of another what we Mark as a calendar year lord it's just a glimpse in your time of preparation for the soon appearing of our Lord Jesus Lord we thank you for what you've done for us the blessings you've been to us Lord in this place and in our families and our lives Lord we trust and rely on the sustaining Grace and power in the name of the Lord Jesus we come today Lord And We Gather under that name and ask your presence would be here with us Lord we may be weak in body maybe even weak in mind Lord but with every breath with every sense that we have Lord we cry out unto you Lord and give you honor glory and a praise for all that you have done all that you will do and truly Lord what you're doing right now pray Lord that this service wouldn't be in vain that this little group together here today Lord though many be absent and missing our hearts are with them Lord Lord we want to dedicate our our thoughts our Consciousness our awareness Lord you can go beyond that down in the depths of our soul lord we want to lean on you and ask you just come and fill us draw us closer to you Lord for having been in this service by the Simplicity of the ministering of your word Lord we know you Quicken life to us Grant it to us now we ask ask us now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you can remain standing I don't think I'd be very long but uh amen there's many many things when you get up here you want to you want to put before the people and try to be an encouragement a blessing and and if anything I would just say hey render this daily in our lives because it's not only the foundation we're we're uh encouraged to stand on but it gives us strength and if you if you'll draw from it he'll provide that strength and uh I uh we're going to read from Psalm 71 this morning but in my heart I was uh rehearsing Psalm 107 it says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the redeem redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy man it it is a blessing this morning just to count yourself as redeemed amen you know brother Bram taught us not not everyone can be redeemed that's like the dollar it used to be the Redemption was you could turn it in and get a get an amount of gold or silver certificate for that dollar bill we know that's not good anymore it's just the paper is not even worth hardly the the paper that's written on but I'm thankful this morning that there are lives that have been changed that have been renewed and and actually can claim Redemption this morning amen know I was thinking too of uh of old job you know we go through trials and and uh he's been one that we say oh the patience of Job if I could just withstand like he did we look in retrospect job wasn't in on the conversation that the devil the Lord had about job job didn't know the Lord considered him so high and the devil didn't know job's tenacity or his ability to stand either but he was willing to test him and the Lord put him through that test but at the outcome you know job endured that that extreme testing both of mind and body and he was delivered and he was restored many many times over what he had lost so what a blessing to us to look back and say hey the Lord thinks so highly of us even though we don't consider our ourselves very high but he put us right here at the very end of the age where we could endure that extreme testing amen and as Paul said to the Ephesians and he gave them much instruction Masters and students and teachers and even fathers and mothers but the very end of that he says but yet let me turn to it finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might if you look that up that word might is his unlimited ability the unlimited ability we're not standing on our own energy this morning our own strength of our legs we know that'll fail we're standing on his word am man amen let's turn to Psalm 71 this has been a real encouragement to me in the last couple months just open your Bible and read it and say thank you Lord for your word because it's a it's a time of confusion it's a time of wonderment we look at Israel we know it's God's time peace we look at our own lives the condition of our country politics we don't lean on those things or have even a hope that they're going to save us we're looking for the preparation of the ground being laid for the coming of the Lord all these things and all these signs have to come to pass amen amen let's just let's just read it in a way that our understanding might be open Amen in thee Oh Lord do I put my trust let me never be put to confusion deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me be thou my strong habitation whereinto I may continually Resort thou Hast given Commandments to save me for thou art my rock and my Fortress deliver me oh my God out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man for thou art My Hope Oh Lord God Thou Art my trust from my youth by thee have I been Holden up from the womb Thou Art he that took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually Of Thee I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honor all the day cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth for my enemies speak against me and they that lay weight for my soul take counsel together saying God hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him oh God be not far from me oh my God make haste for my help let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt but I will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more my mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for I know not the numbers thereof I will go into string of the Lord God I will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only oh God thou has taught me from my youth and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works now also when I am old and grey-headed oh God forsake me not until I have showed thy strength under this generation and thy power to everyone that is to come thy righteousness also oh God is very high who has done great things oh God who is like unto thee thou which has show me great and sore troubles shall Quicken me again and shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth amen Thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side I will also praise thee with a sultry even thy truth oh my God unto thee will I sing with the heart oh thou Holy One of Israel my lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing

why are people so tossed about he said the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss or or fume or worry about things a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right oh sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there is neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to the anchor holds all is [Music] well all is well we have heard the message

measures of [Music] Heaven let us pray our father in the light of your great glory in your great love for us uncomprehended love unmeasurable mercy and kindness Lord we find ourselves [Music] unworthy we haven't words in the vocabulary of man to express your greatness but father this morning we come before you once again needy asking that you would speak to us and help us and apply your blood to our lives and forgive us our many shortcomings and failings father we ask that you would encourage our hearts this morning that we may know that in you is where our hope lies we have confidence father that you're capable of doing all things and that there's nothing that you can't do there's no place that you can't find us there's no trouble that you can't Deliver Us from so this morning Father once again look upon our feeble beings father and show your mercy to us we ask it in the precious name of your son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles let's turn over to a scripture uh we'd like to read in Philippians we preach from this Qui often uh but I trust it'll be a a a blessing to you we're going to start in the seventh verse and uh if I could uh say this uh this is kind of New Year's and so I just thought it'd be a a little thought of you know approaching the New Year approaching the new year and and I I'd like to read this because because I like Paul's approach uh you know your attitude towards anything and your approach to something will have a great determination on the outcome how you approach it uh it will have a great uh uh result in determination of the outcome so let us just read here and Paul says this he says the seventh verse he says but what things were gained to me I count lost for Christ listen to this great attitude and approach that Paul had everything that I gain I count it lost for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but lost for the exceeding Excellence of the knowledge of of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death and if by any means I might obtain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already obtained neither were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated certainly when we come to this time of year uh we look back and think why a whole year has passed and if you're like me it seems like time is going faster and faster and and the days just seemed to roll by and and now we're going to be writing 24 you know I finally put 24 on my checks about in February sometimes I finally get used to it that time has moved on and and as time moves we find out that as we've traveled through time we could uh go back and look at the progression of man from the you know from walking to taming the horse to cart and Automobiles and planes and we're just moving and and we're going uh somewhere and uh and we're traveling and we find out that we're caught up in time and time's moving and all through life people have tried to stop time they've tried to stay right where they're at we have whole groups of people that try to still drive horse and Buggies and they try to live without electricity and and they they try to live in a day gone by because they they uh they don't they don't want uh uh time to go on they don't want things to change they they don't want civilization to advance but uh it's advancing whether we like it or not and and things are changing around us whether we like it or not and and so I like the way that uh it was put in uh Peter the second chapter uh uh second book of Peter and the third chapter in the first verse it says perilous times shall come and if you would continue to read that you would find out it lists all the characteristics of man and the corruption that we find ourselves in so it's not it's not uh necessarily that we can stop what's happening and we can't stop the progress and we can't stop the going forward but I think it would behoove us to have a great understanding of how to approach it you understand how are we going to get through it how are how are we going to f face this next year that set in front of us and we don't know all that's to come in this year I mean we don't know what lies ahead but we know who does and I think that's the thing that we've got to uh bring ourselves to that uh we don't have to know everything if we know him if we if we can find that spot and Paul's talking to here he says the thing that we need to I want to do is I need to obtain Christ I I I long for the power of the Resurrection that I might obtain that I might have him I caught everything is lost that I might have this life this this this uh great gift of God to us as we talked up at Christmas time how that the gift of God to us was was sight was light that we could look upon this world in a different way than than anybody else looks at it a different way that we know that something else is going on besides what the world is struggling with they're trying to struggle with homelessness they're trying to struggle with the immigration problem they're trying to understand the difference in politics and Views and it just seems like we're living at a day of mass confusion and so uh we we truly understand that that we've got to be able to take on something to be able to approach it we've got to take on a Viewpoint we've got to take on an attitude we've got to take on an understanding of how it's going to be in order for us to get through what lies ahead so I could say it like this we know that there's a a storm coming we know that it seemed like peace and safety and all of a sudden a a storm arose it remind me of when Paul set out for uh Rome and the they they were ready to go and the the sea was calm and the wind was southerly and appeared to be favorable and so they set sail because everything looks okay and everything appeared to be just fine and and and that's the way it is with us sometimes everything seems to be going good everything's fine you know we've finally got it together and you know we'll be able to pay our bills and we'll be able to do this and we able to do that and everything seems to be all right and then all of a sudden a great storm arises a great Tempest arises and there's a a storm on the sea and and uh uh we become afraid and and I I like this story a lot it means a lot to me that story of the great Tempest because there there's a part in that when they got into the storm they realized that they had to lighten their load they couldn't go through the storm carrying all the baggage that they had they they they they they just if they if they just they had to get down in there and they had to say this this becomes of no value to my survival in other words something rose up in their life that was greater than the possessions it was the life it was their their their very existence their their their survival all all all lied on on the decisions they had to make and they realized in order to to make it through this storm they would have to lighten their load they couldn't carry the things through the storm that they were carrying they they had to they they they had to realize that oh this this boy this is a a great treasure here uh you know this is a whatever it might be and they say this is no longer any value to me because if I keep this I'm going to sink and I want us to understand this this morning if I could put it a out to you that that's what Paul said he said I leave I leave those things behind and I I just like the way he says it he says this he says Brethren I count not my s to obtain but this one thing I do I forget those things which are behind and reach forth unto those things which are before so Paul realized that he couldn't make it through the Tempest he couldn't make it through the storm carrying all these things and that's I'd like to say to us this morning like if we're approaching this new year that we we've got to understand that it's not turning a new Leaf it's not doing the same things differently or it's not rearranging what you do when you do it you know it's not saying all right I'm not going to do this this way or it's not making promises uh it's not just dealing with the things that you dealt with last year dealing it with a different way you know sometimes what we need to do is just leave those things behind walk away from them just walk away leave them leave them behind he says I leave those things behind I walk away from them I I I I press for a higher calling in other words I forget the direction I was going in I forget what I was doing I forget the way that I was I I'm not going to be that person I'm going to absolutely leave it behind and I'm going to press for something greater I'm going to press for a high calling and and so many times we find out that uh that we just try to deal with it and we just say I'm going to deal with it differently or or I'm going to I'm going I'm not going to let it control me I'm going to control it and Paul says I found out I don't even rely on my own righteousness that's our own righteousness but to be able just to say I'm walking away I'm not going to carry it I cannot make it through the perilous times that lie ahead I can't be carrying this in my ship I can't be carrying this in my life because I I'm not going to be able to survive the storm and if I can say this we we've come to a place that we've got to lighten our load we we've got to get stuff off of our plate we've got to get stuff out of our Lives because there's a great Tempest that's lying in front of us and we can't be burdened with the cares of this world we can't be burdened with bitterness you got to walk away from it am you've got to walk away from from the hurt you've got to W walk away from the wrongdoing yes you were done wrong yes you didn't deserve it yes the people were wrong yes yes it's terrible what they've done yes they deserve to be smittened but the trouble is you can't survive the perilous times that lie ahead having that in your boat you won't make it you've got a light in your load your heart can't take it your mind can't take it you've got to come to the place sure you made a failure sure you made mistakes sure you you're a terrible person sure the person in the mirror is not what you who you want to be but you can't carry that with you you won't be able to survive the future all I know I don't know what lies out there but this will become a burden to me right I've got to lay it behind I've got to get it out of my boat I've got to walk away from it you can't fix it and rearrange it and paint it and try to take a different mindset to it or a different attitude towards it and still carry it you can't carry the burden or the load with a new attitude you've got to walk away that's what Paul said I walk away I lighten my load I take this out of my mind I take it out of the picture of my life I I to I totally get rid of it I I totally forget it if I could say it like this you leave it on the dock and you say I can't make this what's ahead right with this in my life I'm not going to paint it I'm not going to adjust it I'm not going to restack it I'm not going to say well maybe I can make room here by moving this here and this there he have you ever moved and you put the stuff in the truck and then you take it all out and you repack it you know what I mean because eventually you're going to try to get everything fit in in there uh so you can take it all this isn't a time for that this isn't a time to rearrange this isn't a time to repack this is a time to lighten the load to get rid of your burdens to walk away from them cuz there's a new life that's ahead of you you're pressing for something that you've never been you pressing to a place that you haven't experienced God's got things for us that we haven't even tasted yet it hasn't even entered into the hearts and the minds of man the things that God's prepared for him but there's one thing that you've got to be certain of is that you won't be able to get there carrying all this stuff you ever talk to somebody finds out they they move after from one place after they've lived there for a long long time you know what they realize we got a lot of stuff they call it downsizing yeah a friend one time he downsized from 375 to 350 he had so much stuff how much stuff do you have you can live without how much stuff I go through a junk drawer and oh someday I'm going to need this and someday I'm going to use that and this is a pretty good Gadget and that's a pretty good Gadget and you know before long I got two junk drawers and every now and then I'll take them drawers and I'll go get a box and I'll dump it all in the box and you know something I don't think about it and I make another junk drawer why because we hang on to things we hold on to things you know what there's a a program I saw my mom's one time it was called buried alive and I thought buried alive you know that that intrigued me so I thought I would go watch it forgive me if I I watched it but you know I don't need to defend myself because I I sat there and I I watched and you know it was it was a story about Hoarders it it it shocked me that it's a disease well we've got spiritual hoarders we got people that hoard stuff and hang on to stuff and hang on to fears hang on to doubts hang on to Old experiences hang on they hang on to all kinds of things traditions and and and everything and Paul PA said I count all those things as D I leave those things which are behind I walk away from them and there I'm not going to continue to carry this stuff with me I'm not going to hoard problems right I'm not going to hoard feelings I'm not going to hoard complexes I'm going to walk away I'm to walk away from fears people just love to have fears they're afraid of everything leave it on the dock leave it on the dock he's got you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand he's got you covered I don't need to carry this I don't have to be afraid I don't have to ho this fear this feeling of fear and then we realize is that if you carry that fear with you into this uncoming storm into these perilous times that fear is going to affect your judgments it's going to affect your Viewpoint it's going to Cloud your decisions it's going to Cloud your life it's going to keep you from stepping out it's going to keep you from rising in faith and you won't be able to get through the storm if you carry all this stuff it's time to get rid of some stuff selfishness self-preservation you can live for yourself you can't just be so hung up on how you look and what people think of you you know that's a form of selfishness oh I wonder how I look you know how do I look do I look fat how do I look praise God I got a Pulpit you know you get so worried about it you can't think about this you can't think that about because you're so thinking about yourself you can't think about somebody else what do they think what do they think nine chances out of 10 they don't think nothing but you're so hung up on yourself that you think people have got to be thinking about you surely I'm so good somebody's thinking of something I don't care whether it's good or bad but think of me think of me self you're worried about yourself oh I'm just worried you know what what I who's going to take care of me well I'm trusting he is he said he would can I want you to understand we can't we can't take these things with us we've got to walk away we got to leave them on the dock we got to leave those things behind we got to leave those things behind and apprehend something in other words if you leave selfishness behind you have to apprehend and press for the higher calling of living for others some people are so worried about Finance can you know what I mean they they they call the bank and and and I understand some people maybe they their past lives has caused them to be that way I I I had a little lady that went to our bank and she'd go in there about every three days and asked to tell her how much she had in her account she had a couple thousand dollar and she took a lot of security in that couple $100,000 but how many many tragedies are in the world today that $2,000 wouldn't cover the aspirin you can't be afraid you we've got to start leaving stuff behind we've got to stuff unloading we got to get this stuff out of our Lives we've got to get this stuff out of our mind we got to get this stuff out of our approach to life and how we live because we we can't can't live Godly in Christ Jesus with all this stuff on the boat time to go in clean out the garage have a garage sale you you want you want to you know the best thing to do with all that stuff is give it back to the devil where you borrowed it from in the first place God didn't give it to you you borrowed it from the Devil yes he lent it to you here why don't you pack some fear for a while why don't you pack some doubt for a while here I got a few complexes for you to carry why don't you put this in your wagon and put that in your wagon and you go through life and Satan's just out there donating to you he's donating some doubt he's donating some fear he's donating some anxiety he's donating some bitterness he's donating some complexes you know in this Old Wagon pretty soon you get down to the end of the road and you're why is life so hard why is life such a struggle oh why am I so burdened why don't why am a happy empty the wagon leave it behind lighten the L and you'll find out pretty soon you know what I I don't have to worry he's got me nothing will pluck me out of his hands because we can't go into the future carrying the stuff we've got and I'm not talking carnally I'm talking spiritual sometimes you can try all that you want to overcome a habit and if someone smokes you say would do you believe in nicotine patches I believe in anything doctors help patches anything that will help help you stop I believe in anything that'll help you stop drinking I'm not against anything that's good right but regardless of what you try one day you're going to have to walk away one day you got to say I cannot go on with this I can't carry this in my life it won't make it through what lies ahead you understand me it won't make it it'll sink your ship and I thought what a Time of the Year everybody wants to turn a new Leaf I'm not saying Turn new leaves I'm saying let's empty the wagon let's leave those things some of those things out of our Lives let's leave let's leave bitterness is lot of things in your life God's told you to make right make it right get it off the wagon I had something that bothered me for years I did I did something wrong and then I went to the brother years later and say brother I was wrong I did this I I don't know what was in my thinking forgive me and guess what my light got lighter cuz every time I'd meet a challenge or every time I'd come up to something that would pop up and I thought I've been carrying this thing for years what's wrong with me no matter where i' get or how far I would get up the mountain I'd come to that spot and I thought that thing would be there and I said 'y you know something I've got to get this out of my boat I've got to get this out of my life this step's getting hard I can't make it to that next level I had to lighten my load I had to empty my backpack I had to get stuff out of my wagon and you got to all any complexes all this stuff that's in your mind all this future we got to quit looking back we got to leave those things that are behind behind you can't do nothing about it but you can make a step higher and if you could approach this year not turning a new le but just applying the token if the token don't fit throw it away some of you it's as simple as going to your closet and getting rid of all them high heel shoes going through your wardrobe getting rid of all those tight dresses getting just rid of some stuff that just abs absolutely what good is it to you the messenger said you can't make this highway in them shoes you can't pass through the examiner wearing that you won't be able to go down the road you won't be able to go farther you won't be able to make the storm and we've been prophesied that the storm's coming and we just got to realize hey and I I'll sit here and say it as Paul said that I'm the chiefest and the most guilty of you all I've got lots of stuff I've got to unload but I got to know I've got to unload it that's the first place I've got to come to God I can't go farther keeping this I can't obtain the power of the Resurrection with this in my ship and it's time to do that and realize that and I'd like to now if you wouldn't bear with me because I think that one of the most important things that you've got to realize when you've got a full wagon and you've got stuff in your boat that don't belong and you've got complexes you've got attitudes you've got approach and and things that we've just covered up how many knows what religion is it's a covering you cover it up with Fellowship you cover it up with a sweet personality you you know what I mean I it's just my nature I come off the street you know but when someone's all ooey gooey I always wonder what's what's behind all that you know just be yourself and we just got to realize and I thought you know what what happens to me when I empty all my wagon and I get all this stuff out of my life you know what you'll find out you don't know who you are and that's why people hang on to stuff because that's become who they are they wouldn't even know how to relate I remember my great friend brother Brown his wife was Dorothy and Dorothy doesn't speak much but when she spoke she'd say more in one sentence than most people would say in a book and one day we were talking about some stuff going on and and you know taking sides with this and how people were handling this and talking like that and Dorothy just sat there you know like she was and she's in glory now so it's my friend brother Braham and she just sat there and and I'll never forget it and I was trying to analyze it and I was trying to discern which guy was right and which guy was wrong and trying to sit back and just trying to figure it out and put all the pieces and see where I stand then Dorothy spoke up she said you know some people just like like to fuss and then she said if they weren't fussing about this they'd be fussing about something else and it stopped me in my tracks you know what I needed to do I just needed to walk away from it I didn't fit in it I wasn't a part of it I didn't need to have a side I needed to take sides with Jesus now if there's things in Your Wagon and I'm not trying to go through a list till I find your number I think we all could do better I think there's burdens that we all carry but the scripture says cast your cares upon Him for he carth for you and I'd like to play this morning because I think this is a beautiful sermon for the new year called he carth for you how easy would it be to leave something behind to forgive somebody if you knew he would take care of it so if if you have your a device that you would like to read along with or or the board we're going to start in paragraph 64 and brother BR says this he says why is it man thirst and hunger because when he was made he was made and created with a little place in him that God dwelt to comfort him and when he shook himself away from God by sin then that place is vacant and that's why he's hungering for it reaching for it ask yourself this morning have you put stuff in that vacant spot do you have things in that spot that God reserved for himself s he says and the trouble today with us Christians I'm afraid is we're not doing all we can do to show our fallen brother that that's what's the matter with him are we maybe maybe as a pastor I'm not doing all I can do to show us that's what the matter with this we're carrying way too much personal stuff and we're supposed to die and get rid of it all he says that's what the matter with juvenile delinquency is because there's been a delinquency in the church and a delinquency in the home and that's made the juvenile a delinquency that's the reason that the beatnicks and so forth are on the streets of jumping up and down and growing all these things it's because they're trying to find something to satisfy now we want to pick up our messenger and what he says because he says this let me say this tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus there's nothing will satisfy like the coming of the power of the Holy G ghost that will change your life and your attitudes and give you comfort and eternal life you have room in your life for that let's get rid of the things that we can get rid of then we'll be successful in the storm God bless you I'd like to finish this year listening to our messenger God bless you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus there's nothing will satisfy like the coming of the power of the Holy Ghost that'll change your life and your attitudes and give you comfort in eternal life there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins when Sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain a wife might comfort in pth a friend might sit down and give good advice but there's only one thing that can take away sin that's the BL of the Lord Jesus what can take away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me hold again nothing but the blood of Jesus as the writer said oh precious is that flow that makes me white as snow no other Fountain know nothing but the blood of Jesus that's it that cleanses and purifies and brings in a fellowship a little while and the world will see me no more yet ye shall see me for I a personal pronoun will be with you even in you to the end of the world and when he the Holy Spirit has come he will com be the comforter the father will send in my name he'll show you things to come and bring things to your remembrance one as we set together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit coming through the word coming down comfort and giving consolation the coming of destruction of the world all the things that has been are now Vanishing all hopes is gone and the world has nowhere to stand they're drinking gambling Maring given in marriage because they have rejected the true foundation of comfort the Holy Spirit but we who believe in him are looking for our kingdom to come amen blessed be the name of the Lord where they feed them or sorrow or crying or heartaches but peace and joy and love and immortality shall take its place someday cast your cares if you have cares cast them on him for he carth for you the other leads to Eternal death this leads to eternal life and a man's made so he could want that comforter he's wanting a comforter because he was made that way that's the way God put him up together built the rooms in him Soul his conscience his sights his senses everything was put together and in this little room of something to make him happy to give him consolation to take weary and nervousness from him God set there with the Holy Spirit oh what a picture what a truth now my poor dejected friend if you're here and don't know that I'm a witness that that's the truth I'm a nervous upset person Irish on both sides and they're nervous and drunks and my mother's a half indied which should actually by birth make me a renegade that's right oh I'd be a terrible person half breed almost but what happened I found something that tuck that little room in me and give peace that passes understanding and come from Death unto life from Darkness unto life oh oh I could never deny that that's my life he's off standing y in the hospital when I come to closest of my 33 years of ministry come the closest to ever giving to Satan when my little girl Sharon Rose was dying in the hospital I stood there and the doctor didn't even know I was in the room he wouldn't let me go in because she had menitis he said Billy you'll give it to Billy Jr don't go in there and I said do and he set me down he told the nurse said go get some medicine and give him she come out with a little glass about that high and said take this brother brandom and I said just set it down and I wased your children she got out of the room and down through the hall I went down into the basement there laid my baby laying there with flies in its eyes a little mosquito bar of a thing over top his face he kicked it off I looked over to the little fell and his mother laying in the Marg her little brother Billy in a hospital seriously sick my father just died on my arms a few weeks before there and my brother killed instantly there was me nothing but a boy preacher and I looked over at her and I looked I said oh Sharon honey this is Daddy do you know me and I know she know me she's trying to look like wave goodbye to me and her little eyes is crossing she was suffering so hard I can see those little blue eyes Crossing then I looked at her and I fell on my knees and I said God there marmalad her in the the mar where the burier in the morning don't take my baby Lord let me raise her she's so sweet don't take her Lord just then look like a black sheep come unfolding just shut off the vision from her you take her anyhow I raised up and then Satan come to my side he said and then you'd serve him here you are nothing but a boy and you mean what have you done stood on the street corner everywhere you could and fasted till you so week you couldn't climb a telephone pole to do your work and what have you done but preached and cried and prayed one word from him would change the whole picture but would he do it no he won't do it he'll let her die and then you'll turn around and serve him I come almost almost in that hour when my legs wouldn't hold me up no longer I leaned on the the bed I said Sher you know Daddy and she hear weezing like she looked I know she was dying I thought just one word he wouldn't have to even speak it just looked his own mind would just change the picture and the menitis of lever and she'd be well just one word but yet he won't do it Satan said then you'll continue on to serving and I thought where would I go what could I do who could I go to where is my hope something happened to me I said a few years ago down here now I know that I love him I walked over to the bed put my hands on her little head I said darling God gave you and God's taken you away blessed be the name of the Lord though you slay me yet I'll Trust you yes sir I said I'll take you darling and lay you on your mother's arm now they in the in the Undertaker's Mark in about an hour from now but yet if he kills me there's nothing I can go to he's the only hope that I've ever found he's the only foundation he's the only comfort that I ever had and where could I go now for Comfort if it wasn't to him when I said that the Angels come and P her away and I just almost collapsed but something happened he was my comforter he came to me he cared for me I went up to the Grave day after day to meet the obligation of going there each day to mourn a while and pray the state senator was a member of my church a Baptist Church and so then I I was going up the road and Mr eer he said come up and and see me he stopped he R over and put his arms around me I had boots on it's right after the 37

overdose of medicine that killed him doctor killed him not knowing what he was doing give him a half grain of strect N and it killed him and and he died right on my arms look at me in the face two or three days after that I watched a dear Christian my sister andlaw my brothers wife and seen her raise up and look at the robin sitting in the tree and saying there's a land beyond the river there my wife di me holding her hands hand Bill you've talked about it you've preached about it but you don't know how glorious it is to move from this life to another all these things there i' seen him do all he said now he tuck everything that you've got what does he mean to you now I said th the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee or whom in heaven but thee oh he said does it mean that to you and I said it means that to me went on up on the hillside there where she was buried and I sat there a little while and seemed like an old Dove come out with singer coup late of the evening while I sat there and thought of her and the baby laying down there on her arm and seemed like the breeze blowing through the pine trees would say there's a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever and we only reach that Shore by faith degree one by one we gain the portal there to dwell with the immortal someday they'll ring those golden bells for you and me huah last things I told my wife when she died and I kissed her goodbye she said don't live saying O Billy get some good woman is fed with the spirit of God to raise my children she didn't know the baby is going to die the next day and she said said I'll meet you in that morning she said I said stand over there at the East side of the gate and when you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob those children of the Kingdom coming in you start screaming Bill Bill as loud as you can I'll get the children together and meet you there that was my last date with her by the help of God I still cast all my cars on him with the comfort of the holy spirit that someday I'll make that date real when I meet her there by the grace of God go I'll stay on the battlefield and preach till all my life is wasted away for the kingdom of God oh cast your cares on him he carth for you now he cares for you now we know let's ask a few minutes if he cares for us all right he cared for the leper when he was here on Earth there set the leop did you ever see a leper oh I've seen many of them hugged them in my arms I'm white with Leprosy looks like a seed wart turned inside out setting where nobody would touch him down in the Slime and dirt and filth of the street about as low as he could be where everybody was afraid to get around him he was a he was an outcast he was cast away from the Society of the city from the Society of the church from the societ body of of every thing there was in the city no one wanted nothing to do with him if they done anything that pitch him a piece of bread let him get it out of the dirt they wouldn't get near him but Jesus cared for him he walked right down with him and sat down I can just see him lay his hands up on him and said I will be thou pleasan oh he cared for him when nothing else could care he cared well nothing else will care for you he still cares there was an old blind beggar with his sleeves all torn whiskers all over his face and not nothing to eat set by a gat side one day begging and the Son of God on his way to Calvary to be crucified with the sins of the world on him but one screamed thou son of David have mercy mercy on me what a man of that Calvary what a man what a president with the mayor the governor of state one on the police force stop for such a thing as that seld them you'll find it but Jesus cared he cast his cares on him and he cared he said what would you that I would do for you he said Lord that I might receive my sight he said thy faith has saved thee he cared for him there was an immoral woman one time like an alcoholic or a prostitute so IMO to the women of the city wouldn't touch her she was an outcast she come out to get her water she had to wait till noon time she couldn't come with decent women nobody have anything to do with the woman she' been married and had a bunch of husbands and live in common law then nobody cared for her they were too stiff and starchy nobody cared but he cared for so much that he told her the secrets of her heart and forgive her sin and put something in her that she running into the city saying come see a man that's told me the things that I've done see that's what makes him great to me he isn't a stuffed shirt he was God's grace to the people it was God's love expressed in human flesh no matter how little or insignificant he cared immoral drunks alcoholics whatever it was I'll think of little Rosella Griffin in Chicago her books coming out now that came into the meeting so vile to the the great alcoholic synomous at turned her down and about six or eight famous hospitals of Chicago had wrote her name off the book never to come there even until she was so low until the only thing she had left was a coat that her mother gave her she cut it on the inside to put her bottles down in there such an alcoholic that she might not freeze to death Lane in the gutters at night time a young woman smart educated miserable hang sitting in the balcony up yonder in Indiana where we was having a meeting no one seemed to care if they know who it was he moved back from her but Jesus cared he moved me around and said the woman sitting Yonder her name is rosella Griffin she's an alcoholic she's been Give Up by the synomous and they can't do nothing far and all hopes is gone but she's believed on him thus saith the Lord From This Hour on no more alcohol and now she's a sweet loving Christian from place to place and from d to die from jail to jails preaching the gospel to save alcoholics Jesus cares so just cast your cares upon Him in your sorrow he cares when you lose your loved ones he cares he cares for the dead those who've died in Christ one day he was so weary in his way he could hardly go but there come a a band from the city a funeral procession and a little mother frantically throwing her hands in the air and ringing oh Jehovah why did you take him he's my only son he was tired and weary but he cared for that poor little heartbroken woman walked over to the the carriers that that carried the the casket and touched it and said sonrise why he cared he understands now we know by his life that he cares now the question is for us tonight do you care he cares but now do you care if you do not care then he can help you but if you care enough or care enough about yourself I've heard people make this insane remark I Don't Care What Becomes Of Me Oh My I sure be Care What Becomes Of Me sure I do I care I believe any person in their right mind cares I want to know what's going to happen to me and if I know he love me that no one else could love like that he cares for you he cares for you no matter how little you are how insignificant you are how poor how indifferent how many times you've tried and failed he still cares his love still knocks at your heart's door but are we ungrateful for that in a day here where I just told you I hope it didn't go over your head I hope it just didn't pass through lightly but you remember these words that everything's at the end civilization's at the end democracy at the end everything this nation is honeycombed just anytime to blow to pieces oh other nations the Worlds at the end for every martal thing must die that imortal can take its place we've got to come to this place we're here we're at the end and there's no other Foundation there's nothing else that you can and nothing else can care now but Jesus and He does care don't you care enough to submit your life to him to love him to go to the streets to go to your to your neighbor to everywhere with a sweet Gentle Spirit separate yourselves from the things of the world and live such a Peaceable sweet life that others will see Jesus in you don't you feel that you owe that to him let's not be ungrateful you people here last evening when I went out a little woman was standing at the door I hope she's here tonight when I went through she was standing there with a little baby it got to crying she wasn't a Christian but she didn't want the message to be interfered so she took her baby and slipped out with it when I went out the door she said oh I would have loved to hear the end of that message and I asked something you said to me this is Prov not providential this is of God I said lady are you a Christian she said no sir I hope to be sometime lovely looking little mother with a little baby in her arm I said he's here don't put it off too long and there we bowed our heads together there and prayed and I asked God to take years so and at the end when I got through praying she said I'm man and she began to wipe the tears from her eyes why she showed when she wanted the message though if she didn't get it maybe she had somebody here to get it she wanted somebody else to get it and what did it do God cared so he had her standing right there just exactly the place to receive it I said he cares he knows how to work things just right right are we grateful enough reminds me of a story of something happened in a city nearby some years ago a mother had sent her girl away to college her name was Mary and so the girl was a fine girl when she left home she' her mother had washed over a washboard and so forth to to pay her way through college and one day she went to visit home and she got mixed up out there with a mixed class of people and she got in fellowship with an unbelieving girl that was very worldly and ungodly and it's bad when you go to segregating with such as that separate yourselves from the things of the world come out don't be better try to act like you're better but don't Mar your garments with the sin don't be partakers of other men sins if you want to speak a word of encouragement to people all right but don't have to water with the pig you stay away from it that's right and she got down into the gutter with this girl and then when she come home the train stopped in front and the girl sitting at the window looked out and there was an old woman out there that was all scarred all over her face and her neck draw way in her little hands bony like that looking with all that was in her heart watching for someone to get off the train and this girl was with Mary she said Mary look at that old haggy looking woman said isn't she awful looking and that was Mary's mother and Mary because of the feeling of her friend she said yes she is buried and when they got off the the train mary caught in that stage her mother run said oh darling I'm so glad to see you and Mary turned her back to her mother and she said I don't know you and started to walk away and there had to be a conductor standing there and he jumped on his box and he said wait a minute and he attracted the attention of all around he said you child of misery how could you turn your back on your own mother because of that little flip that's with you aren't you ashamed of yourself Mary that I happen to know the case listen you here young woman to the other girl that had made the remark about it said that's her her mother and Mary will never see the day that she was half as pretty as her mother I knew her when she was young and said she was happily married and she had this little baby Mary and she was upstairs and she had the windows open so that the the breeze would the little cradle up there and said she went downstairs and was doing her washing hanging them up in the backyard and fire caught in the house and before she knew it the house is all of flame the neighbors running and when Mary's mother come around said she said my baby my baby it's upstairs and the fireman said the house is out of control there's no way to get to it now but what did she do she grabbed her little apron off of her that was wet with washed water and wrapped it around her face and run through those blazes and the policeman trying to stop her she run up the stairs real quick while her loving baby was laying there and she grabbed the baby and she thought the wet garment protected me but now if I take the baby back to it'll cut it to Pieces those Flames so she wrapped the baby in her own wet garment held it in her bosom and run through the blazes they tore the Beat from her face said that's the reason she's ugly she's ugly that you might be pretty and you mean you'd turn your back on your mother that made such a sacrifice in shame she bowed her head I think that's the way we ought to be this gospel El this comforter that we have this holy spirit that the world calls fanaticism that the people want to say they're Holy Rollers Are you ashamed Are you ashamed of the sacrifice that Jesus made down on the cross that we might have his comfort would you swap it for the comfort of the world a popularity of some neighbor God forbid may we cast our cares on him for he cares for us may we love him and cherish him with all that's in us always the disciples return back rejoicing because they were counted worthy to Bear the reproach of his name that's the way I feel tonight I don't care you can say I'm out of my mind you can call me Holy Roller and my Baptist Church told me I'd lose my mind or I would go be a Holy Roller my father and mother turned me from their house with nothing but a paper sack under my arm with some clothes under a little shirt and a change of under your clothes and a couple pair of socks is all I had my own people said you can't bring that stuff around here and remain our child and I went to knew all not KN where to go with no place to lay my head brother and the devil come to me in that hour the dying of my child many times I have come but I know where salvation lays I couldn't denight though it would kill me I can't tonight I passed from death into Life by the grace of God my cares are all cast on him for he cares for me and he cares for you let us bow our heads just a moment now what challenge is he meant and he can meet those challenges he could face those struggles because he had a pure heart and he wasn't carrying a bunch of stuff in his life and and that's what I'd like to just encourage you this Stephen you don't know what lies ahead but if if there's anything in there that you're ashamed of he cares he cares I knew Rosella Griffin I stayed in Rosella Griffin's home and of course I sat there and I wanted to know her testimony and all she wanted to do was know mind how did God save you how did you come to the Lord and oh she just rejoiced because she knew a God that can do that and that's this morning that's the God we know that's the god that we want to approach this New Year knowing that we have with us that's knowing that's going
