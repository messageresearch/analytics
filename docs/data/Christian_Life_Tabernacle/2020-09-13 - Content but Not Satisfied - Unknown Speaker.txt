rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee that's that's why i'm here tonight i didn't come here just to fulfill some religious obligation and though we're devout christians we're we're work we come sometimes we get caught up in the routine but we're here for one purpose lord if if i could just be drawn closer to you tonight lord and only he could come and break the bread of life and speak directly to your heart and what you have need of and that's what we're expecting amen so as we sing it let's just look to the lord jesus to come and minister personally to each one of us well i

here [Music] lessons let's just sing that first verse again and be closer [Music] lord [Music] amen is that your desire desire this evening you know i i was going to sing a song maybe we'll just save it to the end i just kind of felt like that fit so well with kind of the feeling on my heart this evening you know i feel like we can take even a deeper meaning to that we've heard the voice of the lord for our day and it told of his love to us amen he opened a word to us to show us just how much he loved us we know brother branham said god showed proved his love to us by his election by choosing you before the foundation of the world he proved his love to you amen and we've all heard that that voice in this hour and what is our desire is to rise up in faith to be drawn so close to him that we draw him out of heaven unto ourselves amen amen let's uh thank you musicians we're just going to go right into the word i said maybe we'll sing a song at the end of the the service lord will and we'll see what the lord would have let's turn uh if we could into the book of philippians i was really blessed this morning by the word that was that was preached you know i i appreciate brother billy for yielding himself but i thank the lord most of all because we know that was straight from the the throne of heaven amen you know we're we're not here to hear from a man you know you'll be sorely disappointed if you're here to hear from me because i don't have anything for you but if you come an expectation to hear from god you'll get exactly what you have need of amen the lord never disappoints amen he's i like that song he's an on-time god he may not come when you want him but he'll be there right on time amen so we we don't want our own will but we want his amen so let's start at uh chapter four and we'll read uh verses 10 through 13 these are familiar scriptures and then if you just want to keep it in your mind we're going to go to the the book of first timothy chapter 6 after that he said but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein you were also careful but you lacked opportunity not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content i know both how to be a based and i know how to abound everywhere and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need i can do all things through christ with strengtheneth me amen now let's turn to the book of first timothy chapter 6. some familiar scriptures here and we're going to do a little bit of reading uh just verses 1 through 11. it says let let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and stripes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be there with content but they that will be rich fall into temptation to the snare into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith that have pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou will man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness amen let's just bow our heads and word of prayer heavenly father lord we've as we sang the song lord we've come to we want to draw nearer unto you this evening oh god we haven't come lord as we heard our brother even speak during the song service not because of a ritual lord not just because we feel some just obligation lord to be here but we've come come lord because we desire to draw nearer unto you lord and we know that your word says as we see that day approaching to come together even the more lord and we see the hour is so dark lord and gross darkness lord covering even the people darkness that could be felt lord but we we've come under the light of your glorious gospel for this hour lord lord where you said lord jesus that if we would walk in the light as you were in the light lord we could have fellowship with you lord jesus and we've come lord to strengthen that fellowship lord to have a deeper walk with you a deeper understanding more sincere hearts lord more lord minds that are more pure than they were before hearts that are more cleansed than they were before lord we want to distance ourselves from anything that's not like you lord jesus lord we come to hear from you this evening we pray that every distraction everything of the outside world that would try to worm its way into the minds or the people lord to distract us we just bind every spirit that would be contrary to you in the name of the lord jesus christ lord for your word said that whatever we bind on earth will be found in heaven lord when we bind anything contrary to you lord that you would lord have your preeminence in the service and amongst your people lord may you just get me out of the way lord may the people have their hearts open to receive your word lord not the words of a man and we ask that in all things you would be glorified and you would have the preeminence in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats i was just so blessed this morning and i'm always appreciative of the how the lord works because you know you you know i hear i hear brother his brother billy was ministering this morning i just heard a few things that just struck me and said lord that's that's just exactly the thought that the lord have kind of been putting on my heart to minister and even talking with brother matthew in the back there before the service of how it's just so powerful how the lord will just he always dovetails the things together and you know we we understand as believers that we don't have none of these things happen by accident we don't believe in coincidences just things to happen just to happen you know we i believe in a god that's purposeful you know we're whereas man we we are certainly prone to just whims of our own desires that maybe don't don't profit anything oh today i want to do this or do that why just because i feel like doing it maybe you don't have a purpose behind it other than that you just like to do that thing whatever it might be but god we understand doesn't do anything without a purpose so and i i just say that as a maybe just even before we get fully into it in your own life when you see these things happen take note of those things we ought to we ought to take hold of those things and understand that god is ordering the footsteps of his chosen people amen these things don't happen by accident amen so we want to i just maybe want to if i could say it in a way i know sometimes things that are preached and in the in the hour that we live in it people you know we we have uh we have that saying you know you probably heard of people get triggered that's kind of the saying that they have now is people say something and they kind of pull back and oh my you're just trying to say something to hit something and you know and someone to get them upset or something that and if anything's said i just pray that the lord would allow you to take it not as a condemnation you know i was even hearing this morning about you know uh brother brother billy just talking about these things it's not we're not talking about a condemnation but as a believer we take conviction amen we don't we're not taking we're not under condemnation but the lord will the holy ghost will bring us to conviction of the things in our lives that we need to work on or things that we need to put before the lord and maybe put on the altar sometimes amen but and maybe not take things as a condemnation but as a challenge is what i want to do so maybe to this evening i would like to to maybe lay a challenge before the people of god and maybe you know maybe some things that come across as harsh and things and i don't know however the lord would bring it out i know sometimes maybe i yell a little bit and i don't want to seem like i'm just screaming at you but you know we're not wrestling against flesh and blood and and you know each one of us is different i just speak loudly if you knew my family i'm probably one of the quietest out of all of them so if you knew my mom and dad my mom and dad their conversations are like a shout out when i was growing up so i just just pray you take it in the spirit that that it's meant to be given so tonight we want to speak on just because we like to give titles to things and and just i feel like it was confirmed by even some of the things that were spoken this morning but the message we want to speak on this evening is content but not satisfied so if i just want to hold that in your heart as we're ministering this evening as being content but not satisfied and i want to take that in a positive light you know not as a condemnation but as a as a challenge to us as believers in this hour so we understand in the book of philippians here paul is speaking of the the carnal things and then he brings it up he's like he's saying how you've desired to minister these things unto me and all these wonderful things and he's speaking of the believers trying to help him out even naturally he said you've desired to bestow these things upon me and i appreciate that he says but not that i speak in respect of want physical desires he says but i've found that whatever situation that i'm in i find i have to be content with it and now we're talking about a physical situation because in this hour the lord is trying to bring his bride his his people have to come to a place where we are divorced from the physical things of this world and i'm speaking not just and understand we have to there are things we have to eat we have to drink we sleep these things but i'm speaking of the carnal things see we often times we're so we're so i thought physically lazy and when i say again i'm going to say some things that may sound harsh but i want you to take it we're believers this evening see we're i'm not here we're not here to condemn anybody or put you out but it's a challenge to us to bring us higher okay and so when i'm talking about laziness i'm speaking about the attitude of this h that we have to contend with see we're in the world but not of the world and because we're in the world we contend with the spirits of this world and we understand we're actually not even just dealing with this age but the culmination of all the ages and spirits that came before we see it beginning to manifest itself by the insanity of the age amen we see if you have just this little bit of a spiritual discernment you can see that spirit of persecution of the dark ages right at the door ready to pounce just an absolute hatred and almost a foaming at the mouth a desire what if the scripture says as it was in the days of noah what does it say it says he said the earth was filled with violence it says the the imagination of man's heart was only evil continually they're devising these evil devices against the people of god and make no mistake we're seeing the political climate but what is it it's only a physical manifestation of the spiritual battle that's taking place right now that's all it is see we look we look at politics and you can get so caught up in it but all it is is a microcosm it is it is merely just a glimpse physically because we understand that hell is hath enlarged herself hell our prophet told us hell is literally pressing its way into this world it is manifesting itself have you ever seen is there ever been an age where the people could just wickedness it's just tolerated it's just it's just expected the wickedness of the people paul even i believe it was paul he said he said it's even a shame to speak of the things that they do in secret see but it's just accepted by the world and as we're coming down this line we understand that as hell is pressing its way so is heaven pressing its way into a bride now it may be smaller in number we're coming up to that tip of that pyramid brothers and sisters it's getting smaller and smaller it's getting more and more fine it's sifting out that word is we call it the thinking man's filter but it is literally filtering out all the things of the world see and what i'm talking about is this world is putting such an emphasis on the carnal things that in so many ways we find it's infiltrated the churches we find it's infiltrated the people of god why because we don't see we do not see the fervency that we ought to see we don't see the burning we just heard our pastor preach on it and we had other services that were kind of coming in the same vein and i'm kind of going in that same line we don't see the manifestation of that thirst that that painful desire to see the word of god manifested now now i'm not to say that it's not there again see the devil's going to be right there in your ear to say oh that you're just not even a bride you're not even believer no that's not the case but we got to become clear in our vision to understand that in this age the only way is to remain in that place in the shekinah glory it's the only way outside of that is going to be death because as that thing is narrowing down and narrowing down and narrowing down all outside of that is getting filtered out why because the shock isn't air with the seed the seed is not here with the shock so it's even coming down to the point that the shock is pulling itself away completely pulls itself away and we understand that as these things come that the pools are still there on the flesh and if we're not careful this this world has exalted education it's exalted prosperity look at our nation i mean if you think about that the obsession that they have with wealth that they're just people are just completely completely glossed over and if we're not careful he said supposing even the christians have fault we see the prosperity preachers out there we see that we say oh there's no way it could affect us but how see it doesn't have to be the big boogie man but it's that it's that little fox that spoils the vine it's that little thing getting out of the will of god that one little thing here and there one decision made for the wrong reason that piles one on top of the other on top of the other why because we've got to have discernment brothers and sisters there's got to be a time where we are content with the things of this world that god's given us you know but the world is trying to tell you got to have a better house you got to have a better car you got to have the best food you got to have the best clothes you got to have the best friends you got to have the best church you got to have the best school you got to have the best grades you got to have this and you got to have that but all that stuff is going to perish and even now it is perishing he said it's certain we took nothing into this world and we're taking nothing out but we're building kingdoms on this side for what just so there's more to destroy in the in the tribulation in the in the fiery judgments what does it profit us to build upon the foundation that we've received we've received the foundation of perfect faith in this hour we've received a perfect word that's building us up into a statue of a perfect man but paul said well he said be careful how every man builds thereon one's gonna build with stubble one's gonna build with straw and don't worry one's gonna build with stones and precious stones and these things but the day will declare what you've been building and it's time that we brought ourselves into a place where we have separated ourselves and have taught you know what devil i've got enough of this world i got enough you know what i love i love what paul said he says he said therefore having food in let us be content he never even said anything about houses he didn't even say why that goes with the word doesn't it because he said jesus said foxes have holes and bird have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head see paul was right in line he said i got food and clothing that's enough other than that give me jesus but see we got to have the best everything why because we're the united states we're the richest country supposedly at least it looks like it for now don't worry it's going to crumble don't you worry about it your stocks that you're building up for your retirement's going to crumble don't worry your 401k is going to reach zero one day don't you worry about it because it's it can't do anything else but fail because those things are built upon man's ideas and here's the thing are we content with what god has given us are we content with our place in the body or are we or are we looking to fulfill someone else's place are we looking to like has i believe it was hezekiah or i'm sorry uzziah looking to fulfill the place of a priest when it wasn't his place are we looking why because what happens it's it's the it's that the covetousness of the age look at the age that we live in all the people around they fought their money they thought their beauty what they consider beauty they flaunt this and they thought that what is it their desire that it's breeding a spirit of lust and covetousness because everybody the only reason brother branham he spoke about it he called it keeping up with the joneses that's exactly what it is it's what is it it's you see something someone else has you say i want to have that so what is it your motivation's wrong to begin with why because you're you're motivated not by a need of your family not by your need to live not by something the lord has told you to do but it's literally he said you have not because you asked not and why do you have that he said because you asked upon your love that you may devour it upon your lusts and many times we're just not honest with ourselves about why we want something i want to be content if the lord stripped me down and i had nothing i say lord i will be content with what you give me see but but the devil's reversed it he's made us content with where we're at in christ but not satisfied with what we have of worldly goods when the lord tells us to be the opposite content with the things that we have of this world but we cannot be satisfied with where we are in jesus christ now don't make no mistake that doesn't mean i'm looking for something new no i'm content with the word that's been given to me but i cannot be satisfied until that word that came forth is showing forth in my life i can't be satisfied with a mediocre christian existence i can't be satisfied with the halfway overcoming i've got to see a perfect overcoming in my life we can't be satisfied we've been satisfied far too long with limping along we've been satisfied with with sin in our families we've been satisfied we've been content to sit there and watch satan ravage families we've been content to sit there and watch satan put sicknesses through our families when those things were put under our feet we're expected to overcome this flesh to a point that we can have a body change where are we at again it's not condemnation it's a challenge because we are the children of god we've received this word but now it's time to take it off the shelf we often james said he said show me your faith without works i'll show you my faith by my works that doesn't just mean the miracles that means even your everyday living that i i'll give you a testimony that's the read that's the scripture the lord gave me when i came up here and played guitar with a busted up looking hand because i said lord i'm tired of sitting here and it's easy to give the lord glory after the miracle is over it's easy but when you can be like job in the middle of the trial when you could be like jonah in the belly of the whale and said yet again when i turned to your holy temple of god in the middle of the trial when you could do that's where he's glorified it's easy to give glory after the victory but try being abraham and gathered up a few servants and going after kings just to get a bachelor nephew but that's the lot for the bride and now that's not no pun intended that is the portion for the bride of jesus christ against all odds can take up arms and go slay the devil and bring back your loved ones that's for you that's your portion [Music] but we've gotten satisfied we're just letting the devil have his part of the land you know when when the children of israel went over jordan and started to conquer what was one of the first things that the devil did he tricked them into making peace with the gibeonites we've made peace with way too many devils we've made peace with them and you know what the excuse was after the fact they said oh we'll just make them huge of wood and drawers of water oh we'll make the best of the situation we'll just turn it around for our benefit you can't turn the devil around but for you can't use no demon for your benefit it's time that we started busting up some of the so-called covenants that we've made with those demons in the land because they didn't say nothing about making covenants and even though they thought they had to keep that covenant there was a greater what he said you slay and take care of that land [Music] amen but the devil's got us all tricked we totally reversed where we ought to be i see a word that was preached in our day that's talking about overcoming power that's talking about bringing us back to an eden condition and it was proofed i had you probably all had this revelation a long time ago but i had that brother i i was thinking about this i was thinking about brother bran i'm up in the mountain with the storm and i've never seen it in such a perfect way before but that was literally the garden of eden literally the garden of eden a manifested son of god established his dominion over nature and immediately after just like abraham had communion with melchizedek walked with them in the garden in the forest i think it was in the morning it wasn't anything cool but what is it even that showing the type we're bringing the rising of the sun back the sun was setting on adam and eve he came in the cool evening now it's at the breaking of the day amen but what was it that is our inheritance dominion over these things and yet we slug along why because the devil has got our focus on other things he's he's got us worried subconsciously consciously whatever it may be we go to work we slave away just to put a little food on the table or fix up the house a little bit or do this or do that then we go here and we go there and and where is god in all of it are we and i'm not again it's not condemnation but we're ne i i've spoken this a lot lately but we need to walk circumspectly we need to be honest with ourselves and we need to start looking to see what is our motivation in everything that we do what's our motivation because in order for the lord to come on the scene we got to have the right motive and objective first that's got to be the foundation you know we don't just walk around you know just fulfilling our own desires that's not what we're called to do we're called to be content with the things of this world but there's see there's a thirst in you that can't be satisfied see you were born for this age you you are born for this age why because there is a thirst and a hunger in you that cannot be satisfied until we see a rapture take place there's no other goal for the bride of christ when it comes to seeing the fulfillment of the word she's got to see it come to pass she's got to see that the only thing she can look forward to is a complete preeminence of jesus christ in her that's what she's looking for she can't be satisfied with anything else there's nothing else to be satisfied with in this age because that's what we're called to fulfill amen you know i think look at look at david you could go all through the scriptures and see how this goes in sam in uh in first samuel chapter 16 we know these scriptures and i'm not going to be long tonight since then sabbath took a horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rama so what do we understand david was given a promise right there anointed king now what happened did he immediately ascend to the throne no sir he went back and forth and back and forth and had trouble after trouble after trouble but see there was something in him he could remain see isn't it apparent the people of god are a paradox to this world you will be a paradox unto yourself when the lord starts doing when the lord really starts revealing these things because how could a man like david obviously zealous for the things of god yet knowing that he was anointed king and yet could be content to sleep in the wilderness in the caves to be amongst the heathens to be chased by saul to have all these things happen to him to be spat on to be kicked around all these different things why because he could be content knowing that there was something that lay ahead for him and that's the way the people of god is we can be content it's a paradox to the world how could you be dirt poor and so happy how could you be going through the trials that you're going through and yet you're just seeing like it's all okay why it's because i've got a promise i've got a word and even though even though i'm content with where i'm at there's something in me that won't be satisfied until i see it fulfilled it's a paradox because it would seem to see won't be content but not satisfied well those are two those are opposing things but see it's a paradox to the world it as the world see as they try to feel their lusts and lusts and all these different things they try to fill it with all the drugs they can they try to fill it with all the the the other alcohol or whatever it may be the entertainment all these things it it doesn't feel anything it just leaves a hole behind but when you get a hold of christ when you get a hold of christ one time there's a satisfying portion that comes there's a satisfying portion that just i caught a glimpse of the divine just he comes across your path just one time and that seed is quickened and there's a satisfaction that nothing else can do but there's also a knowing there's a groaning in and of ourselves to see the manifestation of the sons of god but there's a it's a paradox how can you be satisfied and you're not satisfied it's because i can hold a promise just like abraham know that i've got the promise but i will press towards the mark of the high calling until i see it manifested the theme's already there i got some quotes i actually you know i'm just feel to read this now it's a long one so bear with me but i really like this when i was i was reading this and it's in wisdom versus faith he says he says i got a scripture here you might if i read it let's take hebrews the fourth chapter right quick just a minute i want to read this it just looks so good to me right here hebrews 4 and let's get hebrews 4 and start from 1 to 2. let us therefore fear lest a promise being left of us to enter into his rest as of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with and he says knowledge wisdom faith in them that heard it faith in them that what heard it says you can have all the word you can know the word from a to z and it will never work for you have you seen man take that word and try to make it work say brother glory to god it just won't work you can't fool the word with it no no no no no matter what you profess the word testifies of itself no matter what you claim the word gives the testimony that's right now satan knowed the word he noted from a to z well you know what i imagine if he'd have a degree he'd have enough titles to stretch across four or five pages of paper dr reverend elder p h l l q d all the alphabet in every way his degree would be in that bible he knows every word of it sure he does see so satan said now i know the word i know that he knowed the word when he come to eve so he had to he had it by head knowledge but it wouldn't work jesus noted by faith in the revelation of god's word and his own predestinated life i'll read that again jesus knowed it by faith in the revelation of god's word in his own predestinated life amen when you see that you've been predestinated then you can have faith because until then you don't know what your relationship is you're just groping and hoping and wondering but when the lord reveals to you what you are where you stand who you are in relation to him oh my he says gloria i hope that soaks plum to your heart jesus knew who he was satan was wondering he knowed that he was a predestinated creature of god that god himself was manifested in him it wasn't him doing the works it was the father that dwelt in him amen let the devil fly with all his theology hey amen i'm going to skip down here just a little bit he says now take that back to some of these big organizations think of it a minute cell well we got the word let me see it work you catholics you say you're the original let's see it show me your works without or show me your works by or without your faith and i'll show you mine by my faith see see what the word said can you plant now this is where i just was so blessed because this just seemed to dovetail with this morning he says can you plant a seed without it manifesting what it is if it's growing you can't it must manifest itself it is a law from the very beginning god established that law that every seed would bring forth of its kind amen he says he says can you plant a seed without it manifesting what it is if it's growing now that's the big question is it growing can you plant a grain of corn without making corn if it grows can you plant a potato unless it raises a potato can you plant a flower without being that kind of flower then if you're sowed and the seed of god in your heart it's got to produce that jesus said he shall do my works if he believes me if he says he believes it and these don't follow him he's a liar he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also even more than this for i go to my father why it's strong but just don't hit the skinning place and slide off over on some rocks somewhere it'll just fall down in the valley so that the winds can't blow it away and the fowls can't get it it'll grow hide it down in your heart amen and then just down a little bit farther he says then if jesus defeated satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature see that's where he defeated satan he knew who he was and by knowing who he was in the word he knew what he was predestinated to manifest does that do does that make sense can i say that again by knowing he was predestinated and knowing he was predestined in the word that showed him what he was going to manifest so is it with the bride it's been revealed in our day to show us what we're to manifest we're to manifest a garden of eating again oh it may not be the natural eating but that spiritual eating as a prophet upon a mountain say speak to the storm and said it will you go back to where you came from and you won't go you won't snow or nothing for four days or whatever it was until we're done and nature obeyed him and then god comes down and says well give me just walk together a while what is that that was just a foretaste just a little piece of what he's got for you i don't know about you i can't be satisfied until i see that in my life i there's i have i have to see it why because i've been i don't know again i can't i can't preach a revelation to you can't give it to you i can't give you a revelation i can only tell you what the lord's given to me and i know he called me i know he elected me i know he filled me with his spirit why because i've seen him manifest and he puts something in my heart that i you can't explain it but all i know is that once you've received it you can't be satisfied with anything less than the fulfillment of the promise that he gave to you that's why abraham couldn't do anything other than to continue walking and to believe why because it ain't he couldn't it said he hoped against hope he he called he looked crazy it's about time we started looking crazy he called those things that were not as though they were abraham you're dead yeah so what i'm still going to have it yeah look at look at sarah she's her womb's dead yeah so what i'm still going to have it craziness what but it forces you to a place just like the children of israel in the desert it forced them to a place see joshua and caleb could not be satisfied until they saw the fulfillment of that promised land that's why god had to keep them alive because there was something in them that could not be satisfied there was a revelation that caleb added so much he said give me my mount that promise was promised to me way back then it's about time i got it and that's where we're at those promises have been promised to us it's about time we got it give me my mountain but you got to know who you are you've got to have faith in that why because once you have faith in that and then you start to see well if that's who i am this is what i this is what i will be this is what i am becoming this is what i am now well we heard this morning the seed's already there everything for little reverend lily that he needed he didn't have anything added unto him when he was in the muck it was already there the only thing he needed was that sun just kept shining and he just kept taking it in he was in the he was in the muck in the mire but he's pulling the water he's pulling the sunshine and he just keeps growing he it was already there it has no choice the life has to live it has to because it is what it is it's life and if that life being you that it has to live and there's something in you that can't be satisfied with worldly things oh yeah we've tried we've all been there we tried to satisfy it you couldn't do it you couldn't you know you couldn't do enough drugs you couldn't you couldn't watch enough movies you know you could you couldn't listen to enough gossip why because there's something in you the seed can only i see the world has a perverted saying of opposites attract that may be true according to the flesh but let me tell you what brothers and sisters in god's economy like attracts like that's why when eve came out he said this is bone of my bone this is flesh of my flesh jesus says to his bride this is spirit of my spirit see this is like attracts like it's not we're not looking for the opposite but we're looking for the same the lord is not coming back to a bride that looks different from him god to be the same and we're going to read this here in just a little bit i'm going to keep reading here he said then if jesus defeated satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ now do you believe the bride's predestinated the predestinated bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised to put in the church in it right now let me read that again he says he says the predestinated bride of christ now the church the word seed how many of you are part of that amen with everything that god promised to put in the church what are all these things he promised to put in the church we're looking for we see a five-fold ministry we see we just see nine spiritual gifts operating within the framework of the local assembly we see we see a spoken word power manifested in this day to show us we're going even beyond those things he says where is it it's in it right now it's in it now everything's in order the holy spirit's been given the seed's been sowed the evening lights has been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here if it was true back then where are we at now hallelujah oh my all the people followed away left and right from the message oh we didn't see this and we didn't see that are you kidding me they they they didn't have an excuse back then because they got to see the signs for themselves they got to see the discernment in person anybody can sit there and say oh just hear it on a tape oh that doesn't prove it happened you weren't there yeah that's right i wasn't there but you listen to those tapes and tell me what he preached isn't happening right now you're under greater condemnation because that was something he wasn't even seeing and we're seeing it fulfilled right now and people want to walk away in this hour lord have mercy but we're seeing it fulfilled the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here in malachi 4 a predestinated church he says oh devil church of the living god hearing on tape 2 do you know where you stand do you know that you are called of god that the holy ghost range in your heart and every word of god is real to you oh brother how's satan going to stand against that oh my how could he stand against that but you have to answer the first part of that question to get to that point holy ghost range in your heart i believe we got a lot of us with the holy ghost but maybe we aren't letting them reign in our lives the way we ought to let him reign have we truly made him lord of all you go listen to uh the message with brother branham door to the heart he's talking about all these little doors we like to lock them off and keep them closed they got to barricade it up lord says i gotta go in there and clean that out i gotta go that's what the holy ghost is here for is to clean us out that's why you know i'm not even gonna say that i don't i don't wanna go there i'm not trying to defend any i don't wanna offend anybody but that's what the holy ghost is here for it is to clean us up the holy ghost is here to straighten this bride out straighten us out because we need straightened out because i tell you what brothers and sisters you can't tell me we are manifesting what our prophet told us this bride would manifest right now in its fullness we we're not seeing all of we're seeing pieces remember it's not condemnation it's a challenge because i'm content with the things that i've got i am so grateful to see even the spiritual thing i'm content with this word you can't tell me that this isn't that true that this message isn't right we know it's true we see it manifested in in little pieces i feel like i said it's glimpses here and there but there's more for the bride the the world may get their little glimpses yeah it may not be an open show whatever all those things but i can't be satisfied until i see perfection in me i'm not talking perfection to the flesh i'm talking about a perfect manifestation of christ's life in me perfect love divine love the only thing that'll enter there has got to be manifested we can't that's the bar for this hour we're at the capping time it's the capstone time and remember like has to attract like i'm going to read that we're going to get to it in just a second but you're going to see it has to match the character has to be the same for the capstone to come down it's got to be the same for that uniting time because christ can only unite with with with himself why because we're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of the spirit word of his word life of his life you can't join to anything else amen so let's let's just continue reading here he says he says how is he going to stop that from growing house i'll say oh brother how's satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following why you could throw them in jail they if you could i don't care what you do they don't tried it they rotted in the jails they was fed to lions they were sought asunder they were burnt to pieces you can't kill it right a church that's predestinated those who he foreknew like he did jesus he has called those who he has called he is justified though he is justified he is already glorified predestinated and now in the last days with every seed sowed everything in order the world in its order the time shaped up the church in its order the seed the evening lights the signs of like he said as it was in the days of sodom brother brothers and sisters if you knew some of the things that are going on in this world and what politics is pushing through it would chill you to your bone we are in sodom we are in sodom and it it's only going to be the grace of god because if if you think it's bad now when you can't even speak of anything of morality without people wanting to throw you out or get you fired from your job we haven't even seen the manifestation of it yet brothers and sisters this is this this is just uh uh uh adolescent version brother branham saw the baby seed we're seeing an adolescent version but brothers and sisters let me tell you believe you me it's growing up quick you've got to know who you are you got to know where you stand and if you and if if there's any part of you that is longing for worldly things you want a better career you want a better school you want to have all these things you better watch yourself because it's all going to perish anyway they're already there i've got i got a story on the thing i've got a uh uh like an article that i read they're already starting to make it where certain people can't buy or sell there's certain people out there already that get blacklisted from like visa and mastercard they won't let them process payments for their businesses because they don't agree with what they believe in that's just just a little that's coming down the pipe where are we where we where are where are we to be in christ it ought to give us a desperation and i'll give us that painful thirst oh my he said those are his call he's justified everything in order the evening lights the signs like he said it says last things he promised and we see that we are right here where okay i'm going to go down just a little bit farther he says he says what did what did satan do when he met jesus he flew into him with all the ecclesiastical force he had i know the word also flew into him that denominational dust he had we'd throwed it right onto him but didn't have any life did he ever fly off did he he come off a lot quicker than he flew on why he hit that 100 billion volt wire there he singed his feathers he come off of him he come out of him because that wire had volt in it remember satan had a wire too but no matter how nice copper the wire is if it hasn't got no life in it it's dead she won't act the same wire one's got energized from the dynamo and the other one has no connection at all that's right that's the reason it'll work in a predestinated vessel that's the reason the word will work where it's connected connected where with the denomination no sir that's a dead socket having a form of godliness denying the power but connected with the word which never shall pass away and could produce the same power at every time that's where it's at glory amen amen do you love him will you serve him amen sure not hooked into some organization but hooked into the dynamo here brother i'm telling you it works there because it's hooked up the same word now i want you to listen here just a little bit farther i know i'm reading a lot but i just i felt there's so much here it's rich moab was hooked in two and israel was also now i want you to want you to see the distinction here okay we under we've heard these before but i really want you to understand where we're at moab was hooked in two and israel was also moab had nothing but dead bunch of creeds and a false prophet but israel had a smitten rock a brass serpent a pillar of fire hallelujah signs of a living god that's exactly it worked why it was on faith yes sir not on knowledge not man-made creed but on faith in the word the word itself life comes from the word so knowing that if we are there where israel was we've had a pillar of fire we've had a prophet we've had a ministry that came and vindicated itself so if that's the case then then it has to produce the same thing now because it did then we know the denominations are the moab they're out there serving dead creeds they can't produce anything it's void of life sure they'll have their janice and jamborses maybe they'll have their different things happen over there but there will be no life in it why it can't reproduce itself amen is it that current he says life comes from the word my word is life that current comes through the word satan got off there right quick his theological dust didn't do very good right there satan's wire had no current in it it was dead creeds it won't it won't current now see it's the same wire jesus used the father's word satan used the father's word satan was satan jesus was god that's the difference i like that amen it would say like this satan is satan but the bride is him she becomes him so it's got to have the same result we heard brother billy preach this morning it's got to be the same we're not looking for a watered down experience here that nicholaten spirit that that our pastor just mentioned a little bit here and there that's that's the spirit that gets the people out of expectation to see god in their lives why because it puts everything on the ministry it puts everything out of the preachers they turn them into priests and then what happens then the priests see you go back to the church age book brother man talks about it that decollete and spirit comes and then what happens the preachers start to rank one another who's who's the greatest one over here who's this why that's the gentile way is comparing one with another always trying to get dominion over one or the other and see we see that where are we at and a lot of times it's not even the preachers but the people long for it we see it in the word with israel god desired to rule over them and it was them who came to samuel and said we would have a king forcing their hand and so lord says i'll give them one i'll show them what kind they'll have and that's exactly what happened but we are going the opposite way but we've got to be so careful because going back to that laziness thing why because it because it's easy to sit back and put all the work on the clergy or whatever you want to call it it's easy oh the pastor will take care of it you got a part you you have a part the pastor can't even do his part without you doing your part we can't be effective as a body but we've got to stop being contented with worldly things we've got to stop being satisfied spiritually with worldly things and thinking oh we're just okay in this state no there ought to be something there's got to be a crying out there's got to be a crying out there's got to be a desperation when the time of the promise drew near for the children of israel in the land of egypt they started crying out to god why because they can see this is the time where is this deliverance that we've been promised it's for the bride right now we ought to be looking at this message and crying with everything in our hearts where is this rapture where is this perfect life lord we're getting the answer it's in you already and say lord if that's the case reveal to me what's blocking the channel what's the thing that we're what's the what's called a glass ceiling what's that glass ceiling what is it we've got when the time came near and they're getting ready to leave in the first exodus what was it they had to go through that house with and look for every little bit of leaven every little piece they i think they dramatized they'd go through with a candle into every nook and cranny looking for that leaven when's the last time we really went down you know the description you can go legalistic with it if you're not careful but i tell you i often think about david said i shall set no wicked thing before mine eyes you ever thought about that evil phone you're carrying around just imagine whenever a little pop-up i had showed up on your phone that showed you something wicked just think about putting it down for an hour do you think you'd ever pick up that phone more than maybe an hour a day unless it's always on the bible app or on the message or the table or whatever it might be no but what do we do we're he that those things they just they weasel their way in but the the lord if the dove is leading the lamb and the holy spirit remember he's timid how often by our attitudes the things we set before our eyes brother we've been called brothers and sisters we've been called to be holy it's not we're not righteous we're called to be holy yeah he that is unjust let him be unjust still he that is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy we've been called to that higher calling we've been called to holiness he said godliness with contentment is great gain i think we just let so many things slip into our lives they look innocent they oh i tell you and this is going to make you think i'm crazy that's okay i'm just going to tell you i was i go i run a lot i like to run i like to get out there and run and and try to get myself into a little bit of shape because i you know i i like to eat too much and the lord gave me some victory over that by the grace of god but i like to get out there and run and get out in nature and just enjoy like the sky and everything and and i tell you what i was running this was yesterday and i was running to do running and i looked down and i see this little green looking stick looked like a stick and it was a snake it was just a little like little baby probably a little garter snake or something like that it wasn't very big it was probably probably not even thicker than a pencil and i've seen different snakes before and i usually just kind of sidestep them a little bit i'm not i'm even though i like nature i don't know a lot about it so i wouldn't be other than a rattlesnake because it's got the little rattle i wouldn't be able to probably tell you about anything else but i don't i tell you you may think i'm crazy maybe think i'm cruel that's okay i ran past that snake about 10 yards and something in my head said go back and kill that snake i i was like you know what and i i will be honest i've had that i've had that unction before when i've seen little ones in there and some of them were too big i was like nah i can't do nothing with that i don't know and this one i said you know what i'm going to go do it you know you call me it's fine you call me crazy if you want maybe you say oh you're carnal but i went back i said you know what i said i said devil i'm putting my i'm putting my heel on your head right now and i stopped that thing like fi i think i stomped it five times that thing wouldn't die i'm telling you i think it was because my you know your shoes are rubberized cushioning so it was kind of bouncing on them a little bit i i know it sounds silly but i i just something in me but you know what i thought i said you know what that little snake looks so innocent but you give that thing time and it's going to grow up it's going to be a big snake just like oh in the old testament they were so cruel killing all those little baby amalekites yeah but that baby amalekite was going to grow up to be a big amalekite the little baby anik was going to grow up to be a goliath yeah that's what they were they're the sons of anak giants that little he was maybe just maybe even a big baby maybe a 12 pound baby for all i know but he was still a baby he was good and gone and looking really innocent but the devil that's how he comes in and it's about time we recognize that brothers and sisters i don't know what it is i i don't know i don't know i'm not gonna call one specific thing out of what it is i don't know but we better be so careful because the things that look innocent there's a spirit behind everything i don't care if it's the cutest looking little cartoon character you better watch out i got brothers now up in ohio they told me back when they were children they seen the visions of the demons just look just like scooby-doo look like he-man tempting them trying to call them over why because they're from the pit of hell and all the things that look innocent you better pray over it bro if you've got children you better pray over those things before you just let anything into your house yeah you and you brothers that have children and all these things you better rule your house because you'll be responsible when things go wrong it's like oh lord why is it because you weren't there to toe the line we let down the bars i'm preaching to myself i got to be circumspect paul said paul said i got to be careful lest i become a castaway this isn't just limited to just me or just one person or just the preachers or the song the song leaders or the musicians and different things no every one of us and i think we got a lot of maybe babylonious garments maybe bad maybe gold wedges hidden in the tents and i'll be perfectly honest sometimes it's become so common we may not even know it's there anymore and he's just just like a snake could be there he worms its way in there you never even know it was there anymore because he's underground he's hiding but what is it it's tainting your life and you don't even know it you know i i i don't know i just feel to leave to give give you some of these things and i'm not trying to say you have to go you go by whatever revelation the lord gives you because i i don't know what easter with i just know what i've been through but when the lord brought me out of a really dark period of my life i just i i got before the lord i started praying i was crying out the lord i said lord i said i need i need to know what do i need to get rid of what what is if there are are there things here that i don't even know and i remember it's crazy to sound the first thing that the lord popped in my head was you got a whole thing full of basketball cards you need to get rid of that i had i brought i had michael jordan cards i had all kinds of things that might have been worth some money i said lord i'm just gonna get rid of it i toss that thing out i tell you i tell you what brothers and sisters you call it what you will but i hadn't had so many spiritual dreams and things that the lord brought to pass in my life when i did that sincerely before god but but within a couple weeks the lord had manifested things through a couple dreams and brought things to pass in my life that i know were supernatural that led me to completely dropping everything i had and moving from colorado to iowa and all these different things why because we i was obedient to god and and i think we've come to a point if we're looking for an exodus brothers and sisters if we're looking and i know i've been probably going a lot longer than i planned if we're looking for an exodus then it's time to prepare to meet your god it's time to sanctify yourselves it's time to look you know what i would i tell you what i would rather be a fanatic going too far into holiness i'm telling i'm not talking about legalism because you got to be so careful there's a balance and and that stuff ain't gonna save you but i i tell you what that dove he's he's tender-hearted he he's he's meek he's lowly he said he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me he said for i am meek and lowly in heart see we and we we always think of it oh it's just better all over but the holy ghost is a gentleman he's not looking for this bullish attitude of just oh we're just doing this in spirit we have a boldness we know who our enemy is but when it comes to the things of god we ought to be so we ought to be so sensitive we ought to be just so sensitive to the things of god if if it would be oh that that thing is just the wrong color but the lord doesn't want me to have it why because maybe the lord's just testing you have you ever thought about that so so many times when lord why would you have me do that well maybe he just wants to see if you're willing to obey are you are you willing to give that up or are you going to elevate it above above god's revelation for you i don't know what that is all i'm saying is we've got to come to a place where these worldly things are just meaningless to us because we can't take it with us we will take nothing with us but this character that he's giving us now the holy ghost that seed that he placed within us all right i'm just going to finish reading and then we'll close here he says this is the last little thing here he says you know what i believe the seed's been sowed would you believe that for that great church just like the wires has been laid through the building every socket been tested by the word oh my every outlet tested by the word they get not strange when fiery trials come it's to test you see that's the thing and so many times isn't that that what the devil does to us we the lord puts us into a test and we fail fall flat on your face how many ever failed test i mean let's just be real we're humans we fail the test but i i we fall flat on our face and the devil he's the accuser so he's right there to accuse you oh you're nothing you were never a believer anyway when and instead we just get on our we get on our little ash heap and say oh it must be true i couldn't be a believer if i failed this test no the lord the reason you test is so that as we're we're going to talk about here the reason he's testing is so he can get everything wired up just right so when he flips the switch the power can flow so don't take it see it's not a condemnation it's a conviction and it's a challenge to the believer to draw unto him closer get these things out that we're not supposed to have knowing why because we're not going to be satisfied until he flips that switch we can't be i can't be satisfied until we see that holy ghost power and it's coming i tell you what it's coming it's here now but it's also coming amen he said every outlet tested by the word he said if there's a little short there it ground blow the whole switch god don't want them in his church there ain't going to be no switch blowing in this no fuse blown in this last days no sir he comes back and he welds her in there i like that he comes back and he welds there in their right yes sir all right every light's hanging in its place amen that's me i'm a light i want to be hanging in my place amen the only thing waiting for the master back there to turn on the switch yes sir in the word sure it could be right now brother if you need healing just touch the switch that's all you have to do if you got a real wire if you're grounded if your line is grounded the connections to have been lost in jesus tell you what to do amen that's right so what is it these trials coming out we fuse blow say praise the lord for the test let me go fix it lord weld it in there right get that thing fixed up in me so then everything clear out the channels so you can flow don't how many do we want to see the spirit of god amongst the people i see it in our people i see it just like our pastor says we're believers but don't we want to see an ananias and sapphire gospel oh that scares people but that's what we have to have when sin couldn't even walk through that door without being called out by the holy ghost why when the shekinah glory would be so thick in here people could see it with their eyes till till the prophecies tongues and interpretation would go forth not not just like what we call pentecost now where they just repeat scriptures our brother rayon talked about what say oh brother you brother over here go here on this day to do this and you shall have what you ask that's the god that i serve that's what's promised for us why because that's the book of acts that's going to be written behind this word you say oh brother we don't need that anymore i'll tell you what the last sermon brother branham preached communion he said that's what's coming in the in the in the in the sermon communion i had to write it down because i forgot to print it but i wrote it down in the back real fast and this paragraph i said he says you know the hour will soon arise when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and sapphira remember see that hour is arriving see and we are now you just remember that see god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now and he is dwelling among his people he's here we've had it vindicated amen we know the words right we know he's never left us he's manifesting himself in different ways amongst us but they're but we're but i can't i can't be i'm not satisfied with where i'm at now why because i've got a promise of more to come i i'm not looking for something different i'm looking for this word in his fullness i'm not looking see oh oh you're just trying to look to go here and go here no sir i want to see what i was promised come to full manifestation abraham wasn't satisfied with a hagar experience when god said you'll have it by sarah he wasn't satisfied just with can i say it this way without sounding sacrilegious he wasn't satisfied with just the promise i want to go beyond revelation to a manifestation i'm grateful for the revelation i see it in the word we see it in the world i want to see a full manifestation i'm talking about myself it's not see it all goes individuals and as a body we're all part of each other and i hope this is okay i know maybe i take it as a challenge it's not to condemn the people of god but let's let's reach higher it's already in you to do it say and say lord what is it what must i do because we got a part to play it's not just about my works bringing me righteousness or any such thing but lord we preached about it before by stepping into the vision where what part am i to play what part of the vision do i need to be in what what part of the vision do i need to step into to see that manifestation come to pass to see your power manifested more he'll reveal it to you he will he's revealing it to us each and every one as we're growing and growing and growing that seed remember it has to produce that seed's in you it's been quickened it's growing but as we sing that song at the end of this morning servants it's manifesting time the fruits are on the vine amen and the lovely ones coming into plain view amen let's stand i'm just excited for what god's doing so don't take it as just a balling out or anything like that i'm ex i'm an expectation because i i've seen just a little glimpse of what god's got for us oh my i'm tasting i've seen that the lord is good i've seen it but i want more and i can't be satisfied with anything less than him maybe just as the last little thing especially the young people you are bombarded every second of every day with just thing after thing trying to tell you you got to have this you got to have that you got to get this job you got to get this education you got to have this boyfriend or girlfriend you got to have this popularity all these different things the world is trying to tell you you get christ the only thing that matters i don't it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you're the poorest most uneducated person on the planet doesn't i don't care if you don't have any degrees don't go to college whatever that stuff you know that's not that it's bad but if you're put to a choice you choose jesus christ because they may have been ignorant and unlearned but one thing they took note of is they had been with jesus this that science is the god that they try to exalt now and they can't even agree on that and they contradict themselves every day 20 years ago eggs were going to kill you now if you don't eat eggs you're going to die they can't decide why because it's shifting sands but we're on the solid rock but so i just i just i don't know i just had this burden for the young people because i remember even when i was younger you know i'm 36 now so i've been out of school as long as i was in school 18 years past 18. you know and i think wow i'm getting old you know it just time flies it really does it goes by really quick life is about a vapor but i can't even imagine the pressures right now internet was just coming into existence like in the full fledge i i was still doing dial up when i was just coming out of high school you know and there were a lot of struggles then i can't imagine when the devils put everything in their fingertips with these phones tell you we better pray long and hard that's the only thing you parents pray a hedge of protection about your children it's only the grace of god in this age amen amen how many are just going to be content with the things that you have how many how many are contented with what god's made you and what he's brought you to amen let's not be satisfied just staying in one spot but like paul i didn't even get to the scripture but paul said he said now that job attained he said but i press it's not it's not that i will press or i have press it's a present tense pressing i press continually towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus that's where we're at right now we're at the pressing just keep pressing my only thing is just don't be discouraged don't be satisfied with anything else other than the fullness of this word in your life why because he's promised it for you [Music] that's the promise for this age that he's given to us is is to see a bride in his very image i gotta read that i gotta find this quote i meant to read this forgive me if i have you stand just for a second but i believe we'll be okay let me see if i can find this real quick by the grace of god i'll just read this last i had a bit of it here but i'm just going to read this last little thing it's from the statue of a perfect man he says he says you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and their under souls into the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection but when christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority it's a whole lot sharper than that i want you to think about that he said it's coming smaller than the minority then he says it's actually a whole lot sharper than that but just so i write that cross there see it's come up to a needlepoint until the church of the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back he said it's got a pocket like here where it's going to set right in there on a regular pyramid it isn't a cap that just sits across the top it's a little flange and it's got to set on there because it sheds the water and when it comes this church has got to be honed all these rest the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfect to you can't run a razor blade between them weighing tons laying in there how they got them up they don't know but they were built now i want you to just listen to this this last little bit and up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of christ will have to be honed not only just some creed or doctrine or something we've come through i want you to listen it'll have to be so perfectly like christ to when he comes he and that ministry what's ministry the ministry of the bride he and that ministry will fit right smack together he said it'll have to be so perfectly like christ so that ministry will be just like his then we'll come the rapture the going home that's what we're looking for that seed is already there it's already there for you lord help us to grow as our brother really preached this morning lord lord the seed you put in me has to manifest you lord just let me feed it more lord let me fertilize it with more word lord let me fertilize it with more prayer oh lord let me water it with tears we ought to be we ought to be a prayer prayer is where we need to be brothers and sisters prayers read your bible every day and pray so simple but pray without ceasing we ought to just that's where we get into the spirit that's where we cast aside everything get in the closet and pray when you go to work pray when you're in your car pray oh my i'd say read your bible in your car but we don't want to do that but pray without ceasing why that's the communion that's where we come into the presence of god that's what i believe that's what we're lacking that's where we're lacking we're we're trying to get ourselves contented with all these worldly things [Music] we're we're putting so much to outfit thought and this will be my last thing i promise i know i said that a lot and i can't say we only have one service because this is the second service so forgive me but i often thought about i said lord and this is just my own thing and i'm and i'm far from fulfilling my own desire in this but i often thought i said lord if i could tithe of my money the things that you give me lord how much more should i tithe of my time and how how much do we give the lord of our time truly where it's just him just him and you in the secret place in the inner chamber in in the holiest the holies in the in the prayer closet by yourself you face to face with the shekinah [Music] oh i'm not talking about just feeling anything you won't always feel something but i'm talking about taking the time in this age time is the commodity because man that devil's got us running around doing every little thing we got so many business things to do so many things i think about just even trying to clean my house up or do a little project here and there it feels like it takes forever when it should be more simple but that's the the evil of this date with the time and what is it doing the devil's trying to steal it away give it unto the lord and watch him multiply it for good i believe wasn't it i think it was it was one of the the ones from back then in the reformation might have been john wesley or martin luther talked about how he realized that the more he needed to do the more things he had on his plate i'm just paraphrasing the more he had to pray because if he would pray when he went to do the things he had need of the lord would give him the result he needed instead of having to beat his head against the wall trying to do something and oftentimes isn't that what we do we try to we're just oh we got to do it we got to do it we got to do it we just maybe we should just settle down let off the pressure go pray say lord maybe i gotta take care of this thing but lord i'm gonna put you first i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna make sure the things that are done are the things that matter my my relationship with the lord jesus amen that's where we ought to be that's part of it i know it is because i know that's where the devil that's one of the places the devil fights me and i know he fights all of us amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord you're so merciful to us oh god your mercies are renewed every morning lord lord you came down in this age with the capstone crying grace grace [Music] lord and we have need of that grace lord we need that double portion of grace that you've given lord you you even called your bride misgrace lord we want to just give all of ourselves to you lord lord we don't want to hold anything back we don't want to be satisfied with any worldly thing lord lord let us what you've made us let us be content with where you've placed us lord let us be content with the worldly things you know food and clothing and and transportation the things that you've given us lord but lord let us seek after the things that matter lord let us put you in the rightful place oh god it's number one in our lives lord before we would go out to do anything let's go before the throne lord to seek after your face every single day oh god lord let us give more of ourselves o lord jesus lord take away every selfish desire that i have in my life everything that i have that i do just to to please my own flesh or i feel like doing it lord but lord may we look to you before we would do anything oh god lord how your prophet would even tell us that the bride she would have thus saith the lord if she would stand still lord it looks so contrary to the age that we live in that tells us we've always got to be going we've got to be running and we've got to be moving we've got to be going here and there and every which way but lord so many times you've just called us to be still and know that you are god lord to be still in the quiet place of your presence o lord where we can hear from you lord we could receive instruction lord where we could receive your your desire for our lives and see what you would have for us oh god lord we've seen the message lord in the words that have been spoken in the words revealed in this age what you've called us to be an overcoming bride filled with power filled with overcoming power life of your life oh god expressing you as you were on this earth lord even as we just read that capstone coming down having a ministry lord that would just match up perfectly with you lord lord that's what we we can't be satisfied until we see it lord just like abraham we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is god lord we want to see it manifested lord forgive us of our shortcomings lord jesus lord let us not put any evil things before our eyes lord let us not have any wickedness come off of our lips oh god lord let us speak positive all the time lord rejoicing and thinking upon the good things of the word o lord lord the world may call us fanatics lord oh god i often think about the phrase we've heard of people talking about being so heavenly minded they're no earthly good but lord how could it be any earthly good except we be heavenly minded lord lord let us be heavenly minded caught up into your spirit oh god every day lord just filled over and over again with your spirit in us lord living and seeing your word and acting the things that we ought to lord not just not just satisfied with just a revelation lord but desiring that manifestation in this hour lord we're seeing it coming to pass we know it's happening even now lord we're not as those that are only looking to what you're going to do we see it manifesting even now even talking with the brother in the back before the service how lord the rapture is even happening now we know it's coming to pass but oh lord we also see a greater awakening for your people a greater manifestation for your people lord lord that's what we want we want more of you lord lord may you grant it to us oh god get us out of the way lord to manifest you lord the way you would have us lord put us in our rightful place lord jesus lord let the seed that's within your people grow out and just be abundantly fruitful o lord let us feed it with the word fertilize it with prayer oh god water it with tears lord give us that desire to be in the prayer closet lord we love you oh god and we just put all these things before you knowing that lord the promise is sure lord you promised it lord may you just get us in line with what you would have for us lord may you just watch over our pastor and sister leslie as they're traveling lord may you bring them back to a safely low god according to that perfect will lord that we can just rejoice together and come together again and hear your word lord we just ask that you bless each and every one as we go our separate ways may you be glorified in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen how many feel good this evening amen you know we're not looking it's not about condemnation it's it's i really can't say that enough it's a challenge because there's a challenge laying before the people of god now the challenge has already been overcome but the place for us to be is to die out to let him do it amen amen let's you know i'm going to say let's just sing i was going to sing a song i'm going to sing it let's just sing fire fire fire fire fall on me as the day of pentecost amen let it fall on me we want to see more of god in our midst i tell you i want to see an anastasia gospel say lord cleanse me out even more let's bring it lord i'm tired of playing i don't want to play church i don't want a ritual but i want to see the fire of god come down you know why because after elijah the prophet restored the altar the fire had to fall i want to see that fire falling again man let's let's sing this song uh just you give me a key and we'll see if we can match up with them that'll be a fire fire fire fire fall on me five [Music] let's go up

[Music] is [Applause] amen [Music] praise the lord my content but not satisfied what a beautiful message i really appreciate that brother randy as i as he i as he preached that i thought of i thought of it you ever go to like ikea or something if you find the dresser you want or you find the right bed you want and you you select it you make the selection and you're content with what you chose but when you get home you're not satisfied yeah you got all the contents you need you got everything you need and it's not until you get it inside and you get it into the room you want you start unboxing it and you start putting it together and it starts to come into that image that was on the box and i thank god he gave us an image in this day we we've seen a first fruit come to maturity with the power of the spoken word and we've seen the first church with the power and the manifestation that's the picture on the box and sometimes like our brother was saying well you put something together and you realize you got to pull it out and reweld it again because you it wasn't quite right but you know we're coming into that image praise god amen as they just play something softly we'll say a a prayer of dismissal amen heavenly father how we just rejoice in the word that we've heard lord content but not satisfied lord oh god maybe just in using our simple vocabulary of being content lord what you've done for us lord oh we're so thankful for it lord we're so thankful where you've brought us to we're so thankful for our families our church our loved ones our brothers our sisters lord and maybe uh uh there might be one among us who feels that they don't maybe have much family and they don't feel like they have many things but all they have you lord they have everything and we're content with your word or we're content with the call upon our lives or we're content with the message we're content with the gospel but oh there's something inside of us lord that's crying out for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god lord we want to come into that image that stature of a perfect man we want to be capped off with divine love lord we want to see the realities moving and working in our lives lord jesus we want to have control and dominion over this earth lord because that's what you've created us for may we just die out to all of our own thinking all of our own ideas lord jesus that we would see this word come into full power and maturity lord where we could speak the word and see it come into action we know the squeeze is coming down we we see the cup of the iniquity is full all around us horse we know the bride is moving right into that rapturing condition even now we thank you lord we believe it's messages like this that we heard tonight that's bringing us into that rapturing condition lord we just pray a special blessing upon our brother randy lord may you just restore back all to him that he poured out lord may you just bless them father may you continue to open up revelation and may his gift just continue to bless the bride of jesus christ we pray we love you lord just pray you be with each one as they go their separate ways we love
