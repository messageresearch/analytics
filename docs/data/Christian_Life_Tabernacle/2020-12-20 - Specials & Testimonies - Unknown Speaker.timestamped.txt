[36:24] hmm
[36:32] you know i didn't raise my hand but i do
[36:33] have a testimony
[36:35] so i'm just gonna share it you know like
[36:38] brother billy said 2020 has been a year
[36:40] that we don't even want to remember
[36:43] um it just passed by so quick a lot of
[36:45] things happened
[36:47] but i just want to thank the lord for
[36:48] his protection over me and my family and
[36:50] our lives and my family's lives because
[36:55] there was a lot of times where we didn't
[36:56] know or we weren't prepared but
[36:59] you know we were exposed around people
[37:01] that had the c19 as it's called now or
[37:04] covet
[37:05] and just the grace of god
[37:09] we we didn't we didn't we didn't have
[37:10] anything and uh
[37:12] that for me that's a testimony not that
[37:14] i'm any better than anybody else but
[37:16] you know his grace just protected me and
[37:19] my family and
[37:20] i thank him for that um so
[37:24] you know that's just something to
[37:25] rejoice about
[37:27] and my second testimony
[37:30] um you know just a little while ago we
[37:33] were
[37:34] taking the train with the kids and we
[37:37] took the station from
[37:39] ironhorse and we went to grapevine
[37:42] and on our way back um you know i left
[37:46] my phone on the train
[37:48] well you know just like any train if you
[37:50] lose anything you're just never going to
[37:51] get it back because it's never the same
[37:53] train that comes back around so
[37:55] they have four or five just going around
[37:57] and
[37:58] you know i had a lot of stuff on that
[37:59] phone and a lot of business stuff and
[38:02] passwords that i don't remember a lot of
[38:04] passwords
[38:05] and um you know it was really something
[38:08] in my heart i was like you know what i'm
[38:11] i'm gonna just wait i'm just gonna wait
[38:13] until the next train comes around it's
[38:14] just 15 minutes i'm going to see maybe
[38:16] maybe if he comes back they might have
[38:18] my phone
[38:19] so i sit and as i was sitting i was
[38:21] praying
[38:23] train sure enough comes and um
[38:26] i asked the guy i'm like hey do you guys
[38:28] see a phone on the train he's like man
[38:30] i'm sorry you know when things like
[38:32] things happen you gotta go all the way
[38:34] to carrollton and
[38:35] they have a box and they put all the
[38:37] stuff they find in the box and
[38:39] good luck it's just you don't find
[38:41] anything like that anymore it's just
[38:43] so i was like okay no problem so i go
[38:46] home
[38:47] and uh you know we're getting ready for
[38:50] bed and
[38:51] you know i have a secondary phone which
[38:53] is for um
[38:54] work and i called it a couple of times
[38:57] maybe somebody might pick up whoever
[38:59] found it
[39:00] and sure enough they did it so i called
[39:02] it again
[39:04] called it again and nothing i'm like
[39:05] okay so it's lost i'm just gonna
[39:07] go online and and just claim it lost and
[39:11] so you know within my heart you know i
[39:14] was really praying and i was really
[39:15] asking the lord lord you know this is
[39:17] this is just an earthly thing
[39:19] but you know it it has an importance for
[39:22] me because i have a lot of stuff on
[39:23] there that i can't get back or maybe
[39:25] i might have to go through a lot of
[39:26] process to get this back
[39:29] and i said a quick prayer you know sure
[39:30] enough i fell asleep
[39:32] and about 11 30 my phone rings my work
[39:35] phone
[39:36] not not the one that i lost the other
[39:37] one
[39:39] and there's the guy calls and says hey
[39:42] man um
[39:43] i have your phone
[39:46] okay he's like i found it on the train
[39:49] you know this
[39:49] usually doesn't happen but i've seen you
[39:51] called a couple times so i don't know
[39:53] if you're the owner of the phone or not
[39:55] and uh but i want to meet you and give
[39:57] you your phone
[39:58] i'm like okay so yeah you know if
[40:00] somebody was to find some things and it
[40:02] was mine i

[40:04] same for me so i just i just feel like i
[40:06] need to give you the phone back

[40:25] like here you go man
[40:26] still a young 20 or you know 20 year old
[40:29] young guy and
[40:30] and uh you know i you know in everything
[40:33] that we do we always
[40:35] we always have to find some purpose like
[40:37] okay lord am i supposed to say something
[40:39] to this guy now
[40:41] i'm like should i pray with him what do
[40:44] you want me to do
[40:46] so i'm like man you know i really want
[40:48] to know that
[40:49] that what do you what do you do you know
[40:51] it's like well you know just a couple
[40:53] minute conversation
[40:54] i'm like i'll say this thank you so much
[40:57] for doing this i
[40:58] prayed about it and i know this this
[41:00] usually doesn't happen
[41:02] and uh you know the lord you know just
[41:04] blessed you to bless me to bring my
[41:06] phone back and he's like yeah no problem
[41:08] man you know just
[41:09] it's just what it is but you know for
[41:11] for me just a small little thing like
[41:13] that
[41:14] that we might call something normal for
[41:16] me is a miracle
[41:18] because something that i needed at that
[41:20] time the lord just
[41:21] might have put something on that on that
[41:23] guy's heart and he's like you know what
[41:24] i'm gonna
[41:25] i'm gonna for some reason this phone is
[41:27] to get back to where it is so
[41:29] for me that's a testimony and uh you
[41:31] know i praise the lord for it
[41:33] and uh you know i he still works even in
[41:36] these little things
[41:38] for me just gives me a boost of faith
[41:39] and just to believe

[1:32:47] little lie
[1:32:51] it didn't mean much but it lingers still
[1:32:55] in the corners of my mind
[1:33:00] still you call me to walk on the edge of
[1:33:04] this world
[1:33:06] to spread my dreams and fly
[1:33:10] but the future's so far my heart is so
[1:33:14] frail

[1:33:55] and the reasons we change the reasons
[1:33:58] i doubt and why do loved ones have to
[1:34:03] die but you love
[1:34:06] me and you ain't

[1:42:19] never comes to an
[1:42:22] end all there are near every morning
[1:42:28] new every morning
[1:42:31] all great is that faithfulness
[1:42:44] god bless you um i just want to give a
[1:42:47] short testimony and this is kind of hard
[1:42:48] for me but um
[1:42:50] i think most of you know that i have
[1:42:52] progressive hearing loss and i go get
[1:42:54] hearing tests done once a year
[1:42:56] and i had not gone for like a year and a
[1:42:58] half and i noticed i was kind of
[1:43:00] missing a lot and like i have a hard
[1:43:03] time listening to tapes like
[1:43:04] brother brandon because i miss a lot so
[1:43:05] i have to read along and then
[1:43:07] in the preaching i noticed i was missing
[1:43:09] like every 10 words and i was just like
[1:43:12] i know faith comes by hearing and i'm
[1:43:13] like having a hard time hearing in
[1:43:14] church so i was like lord
[1:43:16] this is a struggle but um it's like i
[1:43:18] need to go get my hearing tested and
[1:43:20] i for some reason just wasn't getting
[1:43:22] there within that year period
[1:43:24] and just last week i went and
[1:43:27] it was the lord i went there got my
[1:43:30] hearing tested and
[1:43:32] surprisingly they said it hadn't dropped
[1:43:33] that much and sometimes it's pretty
[1:43:35] drastic
[1:43:35] so i was like praising the lord for that
[1:43:37] and then after he was done
[1:43:39] doing the test he said you know as soon
[1:43:42] as you walked in i feel like you're the
[1:43:43] perfect candidate we're giving away
[1:43:44] these free
[1:43:46] hearing aids and they're like the
[1:43:47] top-notch highest quality
[1:43:49] hearing aid that you can get and you can
[1:43:52] stream on it you can answer phone calls
[1:43:54] from your hearing aid and everything and
[1:43:56] so
[1:43:57] they're like you just have to be able to
[1:43:58] like give a review and talk about it
[1:44:00] and so i was like okay i'll try it out
[1:44:02] and yesterday i
[1:44:03] listened to a sermon for my hearing aids
[1:44:06] and it was like crystal clear i could
[1:44:07] hear
[1:44:07] every word and i was praising god and
[1:44:09] then like the service
[1:44:11] i could actually hear billy's prayer
[1:44:12] request i normally can't hear a word of
[1:44:13] that
[1:44:14] and i was like praise the lord i can
[1:44:15] hear brother billy and i can hear
[1:44:17] you know the ministers and it was just
[1:44:18] such a blessing to me because
[1:44:20] the reason why i want my hearing is so i
[1:44:22] can hear the word and i was like thank

[1:51:18] okay
[1:51:20] god bless everyone as you know i'm
[1:51:23] always nervous when i get up here
[1:51:25] and i wasn't going to say anything but
[1:51:26] it helps me calm my nerves and then
[1:51:28] listen to brother cosman's testimony i
[1:51:31] said well if i testify
[1:51:32] now i know we have watch night service
[1:51:34] coming up what am i going to say then
[1:51:36] but the lord has been so good i'll have
[1:51:40] something else to say by then too
[1:51:43] i was on a zoom call with some of my
[1:51:45] family members last night
[1:51:47] and i loved them dearly but a lot of my
[1:51:50] family this whole year has been
[1:51:53] living in complete fear for the virus
[1:51:55] and
[1:51:56] completely shut down everything that
[1:51:59] they normally would do
[1:52:01] and one of my um cousins who live up in
[1:52:04] maryland she was telling me that
[1:52:07] even on her whole block nobody is
[1:52:10] decorating and anything
[1:52:12] and she thinks it's because they're so
[1:52:14] discouraged
[1:52:15] because everything that's went on plus
[1:52:17] the fact that so many people lost their
[1:52:19] jobs
[1:52:20] they just can't afford to be festive and
[1:52:22] celebrate
[1:52:23] and i just want to thank the lord
[1:52:25] because during this whole outbreak
[1:52:28] um we just carried on as
[1:52:31] we did our daily lives we went on
[1:52:33] vacations and
[1:52:35] had fellowship with everybody and still
[1:52:38] went to the grocery store
[1:52:40] and i mean i don't know who i came in
[1:52:43] contact with
[1:52:44] i don't know who had it i probably had
[1:52:47] it and didn't even know it
[1:52:49] but i'm just so grateful to the lord
[1:52:51] that he has protected us
[1:52:52] in this all i have my niece and my
[1:52:56] nephews this summer and
[1:52:58] we didn't ski skip a beat we wanted to
[1:53:01] let them have a good time in dallas
[1:53:03] and i think they can testify and say
[1:53:05] they had a good time they met new
[1:53:07] friends they did a whole lot
[1:53:09] so i'm just grateful that god has not
[1:53:12] given us the spirit of fear
[1:53:14] but he has given us the spirit of power
[1:53:16] and of love
[1:53:17] and of sound mind i'm so nervous
[1:53:20] but this is the old congregational song
[1:53:23] musicians i hope you can find me i never
[1:53:25] know what key i'm singing in
[1:53:27] i'll probably make up some keys too but
[1:53:30] to the glory of god
[1:53:34] where do i go
[1:53:38] when there's no one to turn to
[1:53:42] who do i talk to
[1:53:44] [Music]

[1:58:04] amen
[1:58:12] god bless you this is very hard for me
[1:58:15] to get up and talk in front of adults
[1:58:17] um many of you know i've been a
[1:58:19] preschool teacher for over 17 years
[1:58:23] you put me in a classroom four-year-olds
[1:58:25] and i'm fine
[1:58:32] um in september of 2019
[1:58:37] we were having a staff meeting and um
[1:58:39] every year i worked at a christian
[1:58:41] school
[1:58:42] and um every year our director would
[1:58:44] have us to
[1:58:45] she wanted us to pray and have god to
[1:58:47] place a verse on our heart
[1:58:49] that would be our verse for that year
[1:58:50] and she would print those verses out and
[1:58:52] put him in our break room
[1:58:53] so that everyone could have something to
[1:58:55] read and maybe bless them you know
[1:58:57] throughout the year
[1:58:59] well i was praying and the lord laid
[1:59:02] isaiah 26 3 on my heart
[1:59:07] you think i have it memorized i do but i
[1:59:08] got to read it
[1:59:11] that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:59:14] whose mind has stayed on me because he
[1:59:16] trusteth in me
[1:59:18] and i put a reminder on my phone every
[1:59:21] morning at seven o'clock and that
[1:59:22] verse has popped up on my phone in 2020
[1:59:26] hit
[1:59:28] our school like all the other schools
[1:59:30] were close we went
[1:59:32] we were shut down in march
[1:59:36] and in june we had a staff meeting
[1:59:39] and they closed our school
[1:59:42] i lost my job
[1:59:46] and it was a gut punch but i have to
[1:59:48] tell you that
[1:59:49] for about two years i've been praying
[1:59:52] that god would work out a way where i
[1:59:54] didn't have to work anymore
[1:59:57] god answers your prayers in mysterious
[1:59:58] ways
[2:00:00] um i can't say that i wasn't upset
[2:00:03] and i cried several days
[2:00:08] but i had a peace
[2:00:11] i had this verse and
[2:00:15] i didn't know what i was going to do i
[2:00:16] didn't know how we were really going to
[2:00:18] make it
[2:00:20] and then i had a couple of families that
[2:00:22] i've had their kids in preschool
[2:00:25] they were cousins and they called me and
[2:00:27] asked me
[2:00:28] in the fall to come and help facilitate
[2:00:32] their children's
[2:00:33] virtual learning they were going through
[2:00:35] the school district
[2:00:36] and all i had to do was show up eight
[2:00:38] o'clock in the morning get them on their
[2:00:40] zoom calls make sure they're doing their
[2:00:41] assignments
[2:00:43] um and then one of the parents that all
[2:00:45] four of their parents worked
[2:00:46] and then one of the parents would show
[2:00:48] up at 12 and relieve me and that's all i
[2:00:50] had to do
[2:00:51] and and it was probably a temporary
[2:00:53] thing
[2:00:55] well two weeks ago they came to me and
[2:00:57] said we're gonna send our kids back to
[2:00:58] school after christmas
[2:01:01] so here i am again
[2:01:05] but i've got that piece
[2:01:09] we're going to be okay god's already
[2:01:11] placed that on my heart
[2:01:12] tim and i've talked about it and he's
[2:01:13] you know he's told me he said monday now
[2:01:15] we've been praying
[2:01:16] that there'd be a way that you didn't
[2:01:17] have to work and we're just trusting him
[2:01:20] you know god does work in mysterious
[2:01:22] ways
[2:01:24] and i'm not up here to ask for a pity or
[2:01:26] anything like that because
[2:01:28] i just i cover your prayers it's going
[2:01:30] to be tough for us for the next couple
[2:01:31] months but
[2:01:32] i think god has shown us a way already
[2:01:35] and i just thank the lord so much
[2:01:39] for all of you that have been praying
[2:01:40] for me i know some of you've already
[2:01:41] heard this in fact i
[2:01:43] sat and talked to sister heidi
[2:01:44] australian today and told them and um
[2:01:47] i came in here and i was like you know
[2:01:48] lord this is just a little testimony
[2:01:50] it's not
[2:01:51] may not be much to somebody else but
[2:01:54] i wasn't even going to do it and when
[2:01:56] sister nicky got up here was talking
[2:01:57] about her family and saying you know
[2:01:59] god gives you that peace then that verse
[2:02:01] kept coming up and i said okay lord i
[2:02:02] hear you so
[2:02:04] i've given my testimony and i thank god
[2:02:07] for that peace and i pray that all of
[2:02:08] you have that as well
[2:02:18] amen amen our mind i stayed on him amen
[2:02:23] that's where i will believe amen at this
[2:02:25] time
[2:02:26] we're going to invite uh brother david
[2:02:28] um
[2:02:29] we'll have brother matthew come sing
[2:02:32] that song
[2:02:32] i know but randy is not here so we're
[2:02:35] going to have brother matthew come and
[2:02:36] sing that song we sing this morning
[2:02:38] peace on earth
[2:02:40] amen and we'll fight for the david just
[2:02:42] so we could close them
[2:02:58] um
[2:03:22] bless you
[2:03:26] well i'm a poor replacement for brother
[2:03:29] randy no one can replace him but
[2:03:33] amen we all have a testimony and
[2:03:38] i'm glad god's not interested in talent
[2:03:41] per se so we just want to
[2:03:43] sing this to the lord and everybody
[2:03:44] knows your part
[2:03:46] so let's just sing this
[2:04:12] i heard the bails on christmas
[2:04:16] day
[2:04:19] their old familiar carols played
[2:04:26] mild and sweet their songs repeat
[2:04:33] of peace on earth good will to make
[2:04:39] and the bells are ringing
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:46] like a quieter singing
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:05:04] he's
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:09] [Applause]
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:13] there is no peace on earth
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:32] foreign
[2:05:47] does anybody hear this on earth
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:14] is
[2:06:17] the wrong shall feel the right prevail
[2:06:21] with peace on earth
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:37] the world revolved from night to day
[2:06:44] a voice a chime a chance of blind
[2:06:51] of peace on earth
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:11] and with our hearts we hear them
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:24] do you hear
[2:07:30] the life the angels singing
[2:07:37] open up your heart and hear them
[2:07:43] on earth
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:08:06] peace
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:11] on earth
[2:08:22] i need to be seated i might as well just
[2:08:24] give a little testimony
[2:08:26] i think uh something in every believer
[2:08:29] whenever somebody
[2:08:30] wants to give an opportunity to testify
[2:08:33] you just want to
[2:08:34] testify and sometimes as the years go by
[2:08:38] you
[2:08:38] you have to give somebody else a chance
[2:08:42] because i know everyone that's met with
[2:08:44] jesus they have something to talk about
[2:08:47] and i've said this before but i just
[2:08:49] wanted to say it again
[2:08:50] because many uh brothers and sisters
[2:08:53] mentioned 2020 and
[2:08:54] 2019 was a very difficult year for me
[2:08:57] and my family
[2:08:58] and um you know lord's always gracious
[2:09:00] to bring us through and i remember
[2:09:02] saying in my heart
[2:09:03] you know 2020 is going to be a year of
[2:09:05] victory
[2:09:06] and uh certainly 2020 has been very
[2:09:09] challenging
[2:09:10] and i was reminded though is is the
[2:09:12] greater the challenge
[2:09:13] the greater the victory so i i can say
[2:09:16] that 2020 has been a great year
[2:09:19] of victory you know he works everything
[2:09:21] out for our good and
[2:09:22] there's so much that could be said and
[2:09:24] so much that we could
[2:09:25] we could say but to to be a part of this
[2:09:28] body and every single one of us
[2:09:31] every single part it's just instrumental
[2:09:34] because it's the body of christ we love
[2:09:36] each one of you
[2:09:37] and just to hear the testimonies the
[2:09:39] songs and everything it's just wonderful
[2:09:41] to see what god is doing
[2:09:42] he's alive and well in 2020 and if he
[2:09:45] tarries he's going to take us right on
[2:09:47] through amen
[2:09:48] god bless you
[2:10:13] you know uh brother orlando is always
[2:10:17] telling me he says how are you going to
[2:10:18] follow that
[2:10:20] you know and just the singing tonight
[2:10:25] and you know i think i'm the luckiest
[2:10:29] pastor in the whole world
[2:10:31] i mean i'm just so thrilled with
[2:10:34] the people the lord has put together
[2:10:38] you talk about from every tongue in
[2:10:41] every kindred and
[2:10:43] every nation the people assembling
[2:10:46] together to worship the lord and
[2:10:49] and i don't know how many places that
[2:10:53] you could hear praise the lord in 20
[2:10:55] different languages
[2:10:57] you know what i mean and yet we all
[2:10:59] serve the same god
[2:11:02] and we've all been purchased by the same
[2:11:04] blood
[2:11:05] and we've all been filled with the same
[2:11:07] spirit
[2:11:08] i mean it is just so wonderful
[2:11:12] you know i didn't know brother darien
[2:11:13] had so much soul
[2:11:18] you know i mean i was starting to
[2:11:22] get with it back there i said where's
[2:11:24] that at
[2:11:26] i thought praise the lord we're finally
[2:11:28] loosening up
[2:11:31] you know what i mean and i think we we
[2:11:33] should all
[2:11:34] maybe if excuse the words i don't got a
[2:11:36] great vocabulary but i like to see us be
[2:11:39] free in the lord
[2:11:40] free and worship become more free in the
[2:11:43] spirit
[2:11:44] to let that unction of the spirit move
[2:11:46] us
[2:11:47] like he never you know just like he
[2:11:50] moves us you know and
[2:11:52] you know and you know me i could go all
[2:11:54] night like this
[2:11:55] i mean i probably you know sister laura
[2:11:58] got off without singing and
[2:12:00] i'm just debating whether i should let
[2:12:02] that happen or not
[2:12:04] i mean that's hardly right you know what
[2:12:07] i mean so i'm going to make her sing
[2:12:10] because that's just the kind of guy i am
[2:12:17] and i'm going to start calling on people
[2:12:21] and everything because i want the love
[2:12:24] of the lord to be
[2:12:26] shed abroad in our heart by the holy
[2:12:28] ghost
[2:12:29] and i i implore you this year to
[2:12:33] get to know one another more invite one
[2:12:36] and know another over if you see someone
[2:12:38] you never talk to
[2:12:39] they're they're a part of your body
[2:12:42] they're here because they love the lord
[2:12:44] and and and let's keep drawing the
[2:12:47] bigger
[2:12:48] circle and and grow in the lord grow in
[2:12:51] the freedom of the lord and
[2:12:52] let's press to where god really wants us
[2:12:55] to be
[2:12:56] and and i i really believe he wants a
[2:12:59] body of believers
[2:13:01] that has an open heart for those that
[2:13:03] are in need
[2:13:05] and and i pray that our congregation
[2:13:08] becomes a refuge
[2:13:10] and just to give you my testimony
[2:13:15] when i first came to fort worth well
[2:13:19] many years ago
[2:13:20] the lord told me i was in montana
[2:13:24] laying on my bed in missoula montana and
[2:13:28] the
[2:13:29] lord spoke to my heart and he said you
[2:13:31] will preach the gospel in texas
[2:13:35] and i thought you know well maybe
[2:13:40] i mean he just just as plain as could be
[2:13:43] and
[2:13:44] if you doubt whether he said it or not
[2:13:46] well
[2:13:47] i don't much hope for you but
[2:13:51] because i've been here for 40 years but
[2:13:54] i remember that i remember then i moved
[2:13:56] from montana to flagstaff
[2:13:58] and i got invited to come preach in
[2:14:02] texas and i thought that would be the
[2:14:06] fulfillment of that but as it came to
[2:14:10] pass the people asked me if i would stay
[2:14:12] and i remember
[2:14:13] i sat out in front of this little
[2:14:15] building over on john t
[2:14:17] white road and i said lord if i ever
[2:14:19] have a church in texas
[2:14:22] and it's your will i want it to be one
[2:14:25] of those cities of refuge
[2:14:28] that's always been the desire of my
[2:14:32] heart
[2:14:33] for this assembly and people
[2:14:37] that somebody with a checkered past
[2:14:40] someone that maybe a reputation
[2:14:45] was ruined or maybe their life had
[2:14:49] fallen apart that this would be a place
[2:14:52] they'd come
[2:14:53] and they could have a fresh start they
[2:14:56] could have their blackboard
[2:14:57] wiped clean that we wouldn't be a people
[2:15:00] that gossiped
[2:15:01] we wouldn't be a people that probed into
[2:15:05] anybody's past
[2:15:07] and i think i can stand here and testify
[2:15:09] of anybody of you that have ever come
[2:15:11] i've never came to you about your past i
[2:15:14] don't care where you've been
[2:15:16] i'm interested in where you're going
[2:15:19] and if we can help straighten the road
[2:15:22] and make it easy
[2:15:23] that's all that our hearts desire has
[2:15:26] been
[2:15:27] we we just want to have an open door
[2:15:31] and we want to make the presence of the
[2:15:33] lord available
[2:15:34] so he can minister and create the
[2:15:37] atmosphere and i hope that's what we go
[2:15:39] forward creating that atmosphere coming
[2:15:42] to the house of the lord
[2:15:44] creating the atmosphere that
[2:15:48] will provide a place that
[2:15:51] those that are sick and be healed those
[2:15:54] that are
[2:15:56] in bondage can be set free
[2:16:00] and people can gain overcoming strength
[2:16:03] and they'll be loved there to help them
[2:16:05] overcome
[2:16:06] and when one of us gets in trouble and
[2:16:09] suffers we all get in trouble
[2:16:11] and we all suffer and we help one
[2:16:14] another through
[2:16:15] and for those that have been visiting
[2:16:17] online
[2:16:20] i sure want to see your face again so i
[2:16:23] hope you can muster up the strength and
[2:16:26] and the lord to provide and if you
[2:16:30] if you're afraid to come well we'll get
[2:16:33] some hazmat suits
[2:16:35] and you can deck up in full uh
[2:16:38] alien gear because we'd love to see you
[2:16:42] and we love to hug you and we love to
[2:16:44] shake your hand and
[2:16:46] we'd love to hear that you're doing well
[2:16:48] and let you know that
[2:16:49] the lord jesus is still the same
[2:16:52] yesterday today and forever this has
[2:16:55] been a wonderful day for me
[2:16:58] i've just felt the presence of the lord
[2:17:01] around me and comforting me and
[2:17:05] giving me hope i've
[2:17:09] felt so inadequate
[2:17:12] and uh you know like it
[2:17:15] just you know that i don't have the
[2:17:18] ability
[2:17:20] to do this job with such a great
[2:17:24] people but then i realized that i don't
[2:17:27] have to do this
[2:17:28] job because i've got a people
[2:17:31] that can do this job and like i said
[2:17:34] we're not a religion
[2:17:36] we're a people we're a family
[2:17:40] and we just pray that we can go forward
[2:17:43] no matter how bad it gets in the future
[2:17:45] that we'll stick together
[2:17:48] we'll love one another and that they'll
[2:17:50] know that we are his disciples
[2:17:53] by that love that we have one for
[2:17:55] another so sister laura come
[2:17:57] finish my day often sing a song
[2:18:02] amen and i'll close in prayer
[2:18:27] god bless you um i guess since i'm up
[2:18:30] here i'll tell a testimony too
[2:18:33] um so
[2:18:40] my mom is not like a believer and uh
[2:18:44] years ago my family home was broken and
[2:18:48] um my mom got
[2:18:52] down a very dark path and left me and my
[2:18:54] dad and
[2:18:56] went over this man that she's been on
[2:18:58] and off with for years
[2:18:59] and um a couple months ago
[2:19:02] he started drinking a lot
[2:19:06] and pulled the gun on her and said he'd
[2:19:07] take her life and
[2:19:09] so she fled and came to live with us for
[2:19:11] about three weeks
[2:19:12] um in that she had
[2:19:16] no job no car no home
[2:19:19] and uh i just really felt sorry for her
[2:19:24] and a friend of hers from florida
[2:19:27] was on her way to come and get her and
[2:19:30] um
[2:19:31] she had been with us for about three
[2:19:32] weeks and
[2:19:34] the night before she left she was
[2:19:37] in zoe's bed her and zoe always share a
[2:19:39] room when she has to come stay
[2:19:42] and she said i have this big
[2:19:45] lump on my face it just like popped out
[2:19:48] of nowhere
[2:19:49] so i was like let me fill it so i felt
[2:19:51] it and it was
[2:19:53] big and hard and you know immediately i
[2:19:56] just get scared for it cause i think
[2:19:57] lord she has nothing
[2:19:59] and she's kind of got a very
[2:20:04] rough upc pentecostal past and her
[2:20:08] father was very abusive and so she gets
[2:20:11] real funny if i get
[2:20:13] in her eyes too religious and i thought
[2:20:16] i don't want to just say hey let's pray
[2:20:19] make her feel awkward
[2:20:20] because she can kind of get like that so
[2:20:22] i thought lord
[2:20:24] i'm your daughter and i know whatever i
[2:20:27] ask for you're going to do it
[2:20:29] and i know you can speak through me and
[2:20:32] honor
[2:20:33] my words and she's my mother and i know
[2:20:36] you love her too
[2:20:38] so i just said mom let me feel that
[2:20:41] again
[2:20:42] so i laid my hands on it and i just said
[2:20:45] you know
[2:20:45] in just a couple days this is going to
[2:20:47] be completely gone
[2:20:49] and you won't even think about it
[2:20:50] anymore she's like all right
[2:20:52] so tell her good night and uh the next
[2:20:54] morning i
[2:20:56] send her out with her friend sue
[2:20:59] and so two days later they arrive in
[2:21:01] florida and she calls me that evening
[2:21:04] and all is well and she said you know
[2:21:06] that
[2:21:07] lump on my face it's gone i said well
[2:21:11] praise the lord you know and so i'm just
[2:21:14] so thankful that he's so mindful of our
[2:21:17] loved ones
[2:21:18] even when they're going down a dark path
[2:21:21] he cares and uh it's all for a purpose
[2:21:24] you just
[2:21:25] have to trust in them so all right
[2:21:29] hope i can sing now you remember
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:52] maybe
[2:21:59] seems like all i can see

[2:22:11] haunted by ghosts that live in
[2:22:15] my past
[2:22:21] bound up in shackles of
[2:22:25] all my failures
