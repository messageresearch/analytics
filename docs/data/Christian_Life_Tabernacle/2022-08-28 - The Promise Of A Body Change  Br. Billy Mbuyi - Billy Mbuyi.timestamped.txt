[38:19] again to be gathered in your presence
[38:21] father the name of jesus means so much
[38:24] to us lord
[38:25] we know it was the name that was given
[38:27] to mortal wayward by which we could call
[38:29] upon the name of the lord
[38:31] and father you will come to our rescue
[38:33] lord we come once again tonight calling
[38:36] upon the same name
[38:38] father we heard you this morning and our
[38:40] hearts are on flame oh god and we pray
[38:43] father that you speak to us once again
[38:45] tonight
[38:46] father it's in the cool of the evening
[38:48] that you would come and you will speak
[38:50] to your son and and father that you
[38:52] would reveal more of yourself to him and
[38:55] and of your plan lord we ask that you do
[38:58] that even tonight lord father we're so
[39:00] thankful lord we commit everything to
[39:02] your hands and ask us things in the name
[39:04] of jesus christ amen
[39:06] [Music]
[39:07] amen god bless you
[39:09] i mean let's open our bibles
[39:15] if you could just lower the bass a
[39:16] little bit it's ringing in
[39:20] first corinthians chapter 15.
[39:22] let's start from uh
[39:27] uh verse
[39:28] 50.
[39:37] it says
[39:39] now this i say veteran
[39:41] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[39:43] kingdom of god
[39:45] neither do corruption inherit
[39:47] incorruption
[39:49] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[39:52] all sleep but we shall be changed
[39:55] in the moment in a twinkie of an eye at
[39:57] the last trump
[39:59] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[40:01] on christ shall rise
[40:03] shall shall be raised incorruptible and
[40:06] we shall be changed
[40:08] for this corruptable must put on
[40:10] incorruption
[40:12] and this mortal shall put on immortality
[40:16] so when this corruption shall put on
[40:19] incorruption and this mortal
[40:22] shall put on immortality then shall be
[40:24] brought to pass
[40:26] the saying that is written
[40:28] death is swallowed up in victory
[40:31] and then he continues on it says
[40:33] o death words thy sting and all grave
[40:37] ways thy victory
[40:39] it says the sting of death is sin
[40:43] and the strength of sin is law
[40:46] but thanks be to god which giveth us
[40:49] victory
[40:50] through our lord jesus christ
[40:52] therefore my brethren
[40:55] be ye steadfast unmovable
[40:58] always abounding in the work of the lord
[41:01] for as much as ye know
[41:03] that your labor is not in vain in the
[41:06] lord
[41:07] let's just buy our heads our gracious
[41:08] father we're so thankful lord
[41:11] to know that our efforts are not in vain
[41:14] to know that
[41:16] father
[41:17] obedience in trying all that we can the
[41:19] best that we can lord it's counted
[41:22] father your prophet said that there's
[41:24] not a thing that you've ever taken in
[41:26] your hands and never return a
[41:27] hundred-fold lord
[41:29] even the efforts of man if what we try
[41:32] to do lord you still count that
[41:34] we commit what we are into your hands
[41:36] and as in the name of jesus christ that
[41:38] you bless your word to us amen i have
[41:40] your seeds also if you could turn in
[41:43] hebrews 11.
[41:49] hebrews chapter 11
[41:51] it says
[41:52] verse 1 it says
[41:54] now faith is the substance of things
[41:56] hoped for the evidence of things not
[41:58] seen
[42:00] for by it the elders obtain a good
[42:02] report
[42:04] it says through faith we understand that
[42:06] the worlds were framed
[42:08] by the word of god so that things which
[42:11] are seen were not made when we're not
[42:13] made of things that do appear
[42:16] it says in four it says by faith abel
[42:20] offered up
[42:22] unto god an excellent sacrifice
[42:26] than cain
[42:28] by which he obtained witness that he was
[42:30] righteous god testifying of his own gift
[42:34] by it being dead yet speaketh
[42:37] it says by faith enoch was translated
[42:42] that he should not see death
[42:44] and was not found because god had
[42:47] translated him
[42:50] for he for before his translation he had
[42:53] this testimony that had pleased god
[42:56] but without faith it's impossible to
[42:58] please him
[43:00] for him that cometh to god
[43:02] must believe that he is and that he's a
[43:04] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[43:07] him
[43:08] i want you to notice it says there's an
[43:10] element of seeking like what we heard
[43:12] this morning there's an element of
[43:15] seeking there's an element of
[43:17] of of work that is not in vain
[43:20] it says that enoch has regretted five it
[43:22] says
[43:23] full before his translation he had this
[43:25] testimony that he had pleased god
[43:29] and we could say
[43:31] if that be
[43:32] that he had pleased god so in order for
[43:35] you to be translated you have to please
[43:37] god that's the prerequisite
[43:40] you you have to please god in order to
[43:42] be for you to be translated and you
[43:44] cannot please god
[43:46] without you cannot have the faith to
[43:48] please god without the word so when the
[43:50] word comes it gives you the opportunity
[43:53] for you to have faith and therefore
[43:56] please god
[43:57] and so
[43:58] if we just speak for a moment i want to
[44:01] speak on the promise of a body change
[44:04] the promise of a body change but before
[44:06] we go on uh just some of the things that
[44:09] a pastor made a statement that so much
[44:12] stuck with my mind
[44:14] the whole afternoon i was just thinking
[44:16] about it where it says when he read that
[44:18] uh scripture that says where we we have
[44:20] to finance us where god's word belongs
[44:23] in our life
[44:24] where does god's words belong in our
[44:26] lives
[44:27] and and
[44:28] verbatim speaks in this message
[44:31] god's only provided place of worship
[44:35] he says that it speaks about even the
[44:37] time that we're living in
[44:39] and and
[44:41] specifically targeting what we call or
[44:44] what we know to be the adoption of sons
[44:46] it says
[44:47] it says in paragraph 262 it says
[44:50] lutheran and it says under justification
[44:54] the feet raised raise it up like that
[44:57] wesley under sanctification the
[45:00] pentecostals under the arm it says the
[45:03] works and the deed and so forth
[45:06] had to be calvinist it says oh
[45:09] or it had to be armenians it says had to
[45:12] be
[45:13] a legalist
[45:14] but now
[45:16] it says we come to the head the capstone
[45:19] grace grace
[45:21] the the capstone cried the headstone
[45:24] crying what grace grace
[45:27] passed from death and creeds into the
[45:30] leaving word of god into the living word
[45:34] of god
[45:35] into the living word of the living god
[45:39] god's only provided plan for his age his
[45:42] son
[45:43] in the word age quickened by the spirit
[45:47] like it sparks
[45:49] that's let off something
[45:52] to make it alive
[45:54] seated now in heavenly places in present
[45:58] tense
[45:59] alive and subject to every promise in
[46:03] the word
[46:05] oh so this is the very description of
[46:07] what our pastor talked about where we
[46:09] are and what we are sitting under
[46:12] so yeah we are led by the word of god
[46:15] the word of the living god by his own
[46:17] living word every says subject
[46:21] it says in heavenly places already alive
[46:24] and subject to every promise in the word
[46:27] then what does it do
[46:29] it says you being part of god's gene
[46:32] are part of the word in in it says
[46:35] others it says other men are part of
[46:38] god's word seated
[46:40] together manifesting manifest the entire
[46:45] body of christ
[46:46] it says because there is no leaven among
[46:49] you
[46:50] see what you've taken about
[46:52] brother brown he says no leaven among
[46:55] you just the word only seated in
[46:58] heavenly places
[47:00] in in the door where you put his name
[47:04] jesus christ
[47:06] so here we are now is speaking
[47:08] specifically where we are seated
[47:11] together when we say we are sitting in
[47:13] heavenly places it's the blessings of
[47:16] god that surround us it's the
[47:18] manifestation of god that are
[47:20] surrounding us it's he's taken us and
[47:22] placed us into the body of christ and
[47:25] how do we come into the body we are born
[47:28] into this body this is not a body that
[47:30] we just come and sign our books our name
[47:32] on the book and we become a member but
[47:34] no born in christ jesus to be in this
[47:38] body where we are seated in heavenly
[47:40] places where all the promises belong to
[47:43] us where everything is under our subject
[47:46] where he's placed us in him
[47:49] now i i didn't get a chance to print
[47:51] this out but there's a place where
[47:53] bhararanam is asking a question and is
[47:55] asking he says how did we how come how
[47:58] did we become in him how are we in him
[48:01] he says well even how are we manifested
[48:03] in him he says now you have to remember
[48:06] in the beginning god was a spirit that
[48:08] covered all time in space he says but
[48:10] all the attribute of who god was
[48:13] remember the fullness of who god was was
[48:15] poured into christ so therefore when
[48:18] christ went into calvary he went to
[48:21] calvary with every attribute every plan
[48:24] of god that ever was to be manifested
[48:26] was in him so therefore when he died you
[48:29] died with him and when he resurrected
[48:32] you resurrected with him why because the
[48:34] fullness of god was in him
[48:38] and we are part of that fullness and now
[48:41] what he's doing in this end time is
[48:43] taking that fullness is now pouring into
[48:46] his body you that were once in sins so
[48:49] you know we're wanting
[48:50] all kinds of things all kinds of
[48:52] trespassing everything you as you
[48:54] brought up together to come into the
[48:56] manifestation of this body so today the
[48:59] bride is the manifestation of the body
[49:02] of christ to be manifested in the end
[49:05] time
[49:05] because we realize if the body is the
[49:08] body
[49:09] of christ and the body is a supernatural
[49:12] body if his body is life then the flesh
[49:16] has to be made with the same element
[49:18] that the body is made of well but it
[49:20] says the body of christ is not a cell of
[49:23] an animal mixed with the cell of a human
[49:26] no just as we one would have a son and
[49:29] the son will be the same characteristics
[49:31] or made of the same
[49:33] material as the father if christ the
[49:36] body is the word so is the body to be
[49:38] exactly the word it's not a cell of an
[49:41] animal mixed with the cell of a human
[49:43] but it's the cell of the word mixed upon
[49:46] word upon word upon word why to manifest
[49:49] the same manifestation that the head did
[49:53] human cell upon human cell
[49:56] word upon word the manifestation of
[49:59] himself
[50:00] he says here again in uh uh
[50:04] what is the holy spirit given for he
[50:07] says we are now we are we are in a day
[50:11] now it says back then there wasn't uh
[50:14] there wasn't half as smart as today
[50:17] it says they couldn't make an atomic
[50:20] bomb and and uh uh automobile it says uh
[50:24] they didn't have the science and the
[50:26] things that we have now but it says but
[50:28] all things of
[50:30] mysterious things
[50:32] uh it says to try to say
[50:35] some men blowed up together by some dust
[50:39] and so forth and
[50:42] take some analysis and try to prove it
[50:45] to make infidels out of people but now
[50:48] he says when we need it the spirit of
[50:51] god raises a standard it says what is it
[50:55] he's pouring in he's pouring in his
[50:58] spirit
[50:59] then those who are resting out yonder in
[51:03] the grave
[51:04] or under the altar of god
[51:07] it says under the altar of god as the
[51:09] scripture says are crying how long lord
[51:12] how long
[51:13] how much how much longer god's waiting
[51:16] for me and you
[51:18] the church is waiting on you and me
[51:21] adoption time when god can pour into us
[51:25] his fullness
[51:27] now i was just thinking as even a pastor
[51:30] we we we really within ourselves we have
[51:33] to come to an understanding that this is
[51:36] not the age where
[51:38] you you just receive the baptism of the
[51:41] holy ghost and that's the end of it this
[51:43] is the age where god he's interested in
[51:46] pouring everything that he ever was in
[51:49] the beginning
[51:50] this is the age of the fullness of god
[51:53] manifested in his people
[51:55] where he's trying to pull his fullness
[51:57] so in order for him to pull his fullness
[51:59] in us we have to empty out of ourselves
[52:02] so we can let him pull and pour himself
[52:05] into us in order for us to see his
[52:07] fullness manifested in us there has to
[52:10] be some dying out within ourselves so we
[52:12] can let him pour off what he is into us
[52:15] so we can be coming into his image he
[52:18] says his fullness his power his
[52:20] resurrection it says that's when the
[52:24] church when he says that's when the
[52:25] church and christ become so close
[52:27] together till christ become visibly
[52:30] among us and raise the dead and it says
[52:35] and we go into the rapture so this
[52:38] rapture is not happening just as a oh
[52:40] you know just one walking and not paying
[52:42] attention but there has to be some
[52:44] dedication to where
[52:46] there is some pouring out of ourselves
[52:48] and some pouring in of him
[52:51] they some empty out of ourselves so we
[52:54] can be filled with him this rapture is
[52:56] only happening when we come to the
[52:58] realization of what our goal is and what
[53:01] our objective is when we begin to work
[53:03] towards those things when we're going to
[53:05] put attention and effort into knowing
[53:09] that this is what i'm called to be
[53:10] manifesting and i'm working towards that
[53:13] so god can come and manifest it because
[53:16] otherwise he says well you know we'll
[53:18] wait until god does it i'll just walk
[53:21] and if he wants to do it he'll do it god
[53:23] wants to do it and he's proven in his
[53:26] word that this is the hour for it the
[53:28] question is what is it you and i doing
[53:30] about it
[53:34] and and let me just say this the reveal
[53:36] word of the end time has to create an
[53:39] expectation within the heart of the
[53:41] believer
[53:42] this message is not just sent for us to
[53:44] learn it and and to be able to express
[53:47] it and talk about it intellectually and
[53:50] rejoice over the quotes and the things
[53:52] now this message is sent in order for it
[53:54] to transform a people for a rapture that
[53:57] is to come
[53:58] if we know that the rapturing faith is
[54:00] in the world then the word has to
[54:03] transform us into that rapturing faith
[54:08] the reveal word of the end time has to
[54:10] create a desperation
[54:13] in other words when i see what god has
[54:15] promised what he says that we're
[54:17] supposed to be at the end time when he
[54:19] talks about the restoration of all that
[54:22] was in the beginning when he talks about
[54:24] even as we heard it this morning when he
[54:26] comes and he talks about the placing of
[54:28] sons and the adoption i have within
[54:31] myself has to hunger for it i have to
[54:34] become desperate for it in other words i
[54:36] have to consider that word that was
[54:38] spoken greater than anything out there i
[54:41] have to consider it greater than
[54:43] anything i desire in order for me to
[54:45] become it
[54:48] you you don't become something without
[54:50] any effort you don't become a doctor
[54:53] without going to school without putting
[54:55] work and without stunning your your
[54:58] books and passing exams and doing all
[55:00] those things so therefore if we're going
[55:02] to go out of here in the rapture we have
[55:05] been given a word that will provide
[55:07] rapturing faith therefore we can eat of
[55:10] that word become of that word
[55:12] ask for the god who provided the word as
[55:14] el paso said it so he can give us that
[55:17] burning bush experience to make each and
[55:19] every word become personal to us so we
[55:22] can come into the condition that will
[55:24] provide the rapture
[55:28] we we want to see the manifestation of
[55:30] the promise our sacramento prophet
[55:33] speaks about
[55:34] uncle body robinson he said they will go
[55:37] and he went and he read in the bible how
[55:39] that god promised the holy ghost and and
[55:42] he went into the field and he kneeled
[55:43] down and said that i'm not going to
[55:45] stand up here until you give me the holy
[55:48] ghost so there has to be uh some
[55:50] perseverance and people that's uh
[55:53] decided they've burned all the bridges
[55:55] they've left everything and
[55:57] they've come together for the
[55:59] manifestation of something and the devil
[56:01] what he tries to do is just to come
[56:03] around even as we're ready this morning
[56:05] and said oh all is fine you don't have
[56:07] to do anything you just sit there and
[56:10] just listen day in and day out and go
[56:12] home and just listen it's going to come
[56:14] to pass by itself no there has to be
[56:16] someone stand up and say i heard the
[56:18] word and now i want to see the
[56:20] manifestation of it
[56:23] there has to be someone saying they said
[56:25] i'm tired of myself i'm tired of what i
[56:28] see in the mirror i can't keep going the
[56:31] way i'm giving the word has been given
[56:33] to me the word has been spoken to me
[56:35] therefore god i want the manifestation
[56:38] of this in my life
[56:41] otherwise we are not different from any
[56:43] other denomination down the street who
[56:45] just comes and learns about the
[56:47] scriptures and about the promise how
[56:49] that god is kind and all the things that
[56:51] he can do no but there has to be a
[56:53] people they have seen what the word is
[56:55] about their eyes have been opened to see
[56:58] it and let me say this if god opened
[57:00] your eyes to see it it's so you can go
[57:02] and get it
[57:03] [Music]
[57:05] it's the same with the promised land
[57:07] when they went and they saw those things
[57:09] that
[57:10] if it wasn't for you you would have not
[57:12] seen it
[57:14] if it wasn't for you your eyes would
[57:15] have been shut you would have been some
[57:17] churches down the road you could have
[57:19] been at home you could have been all
[57:21] doing all kinds of things but the reason
[57:23] why you came back tonight the reason why
[57:25] you're sitting here tonight is because
[57:27] god open your eyes and if he opens your
[57:29] eyes it's because it's for you
[57:32] to receive it
[57:37] so we want the message to take the first
[57:39] place within our lives
[57:41] we want the word the living to be living
[57:45] our lives under the expectation to be
[57:47] living our lives under the the
[57:50] expectation of of god moving upon us
[57:53] anytime and and god moving and bringing
[57:57] his word to come to pass and when we
[57:59] wake up in the morning my mind is on the
[58:01] word and my thoughts is on the word
[58:04] everything i do is on the word why
[58:06] because i'm expecting that in any moment
[58:09] any twinkling of an eye i'll be called
[58:11] for the change of the body you wanna you
[58:14] won't get the change of the body unless
[58:16] you're looking for the change of body
[58:20] it's not you going about your business
[58:22] and not thinking anything about it the
[58:24] scripture says i inaudible god
[58:27] enoch walked with god and it was
[58:29] pleasing to god why because he he
[58:32] counted the things of this world of no
[58:34] good to him anymore he didn't he didn't
[58:37] uh uh he didn't value them the use the
[58:40] way he used to value them anymore his
[58:42] mind and his heart was on those things
[58:45] and and he woke up one morning and he
[58:47] began to walk with god and he was not
[58:49] found
[58:51] and it wasn't just
[58:53] it's not just a and happened chance and
[58:56] an enoch no he walked with god meaning
[58:59] the word that was given for him for his
[59:01] age he walked with it he he prayed it
[59:04] and he let that word become him and he
[59:07] believed every promise until that
[59:09] promise became a reality to him
[59:14] thinking about what a pastor talked
[59:16] about a couple of years a couple of
[59:17] months ago or a couple of weeks ago i
[59:19] would say
[59:21] we heard it on a tape about the uh
[59:24] girl at the range
[59:26] yes she was and
[59:28] she perhaps was
[59:30] made fun of
[59:32] she was she was just washing dishes and
[59:35] and yes it was all the other girls are
[59:37] dressed nice and they had all that they
[59:39] needed
[59:40] they came and
[59:41] when she told them that she was she had
[59:44] a promise that there was this there was
[59:46] this the the young man who came and
[59:49] talked to her and promised her that he
[59:51] was going to come back they made fun of
[59:52] her
[59:54] but all everything she did
[59:57] her mind was always on that day that
[59:59] she's gonna that he's gonna show up
[1:00:01] they made fun of her absolutely they
[1:00:04] laughed and they said there's no way he
[1:00:06] he didn't talk to you you dreamed this
[1:00:08] this is this is it's impossible that he
[1:00:10] will come back for you
[1:00:13] but she doesn't whatever her she just
[1:00:15] was humble and made fun of and all those
[1:00:17] things and the scripture says you shall
[1:00:20] be hated in this world
[1:00:22] when we say the things that we believe
[1:00:24] no one is going to believe you you don't
[1:00:25] expect anybody to come and say oh you're
[1:00:28] believing the truth that's going on no
[1:00:29] they're going to make fun of you
[1:00:32] they're going to laugh at you why look
[1:00:33] at you with those long skirts and look
[1:00:35] at you with all those things but what
[1:00:37] they're forgetting is those things are
[1:00:39] putting you in preparation for the body
[1:00:42] change that's around the corner and when
[1:00:44] it happens you'll be gone
[1:00:47] but how will be how will you be gone if
[1:00:49] you don't obey what was given to you
[1:00:52] now imagine this girl in the range
[1:00:54] forgetting all about that was told about
[1:00:56] her and just leaving her life the way
[1:00:58] she wanted
[1:00:59] she would have missed the promise
[1:01:01] but every time she was laughed at
[1:01:04] she remembered
[1:01:05] she had a promise
[1:01:07] the promise was not made by those that
[1:01:09] were laughing
[1:01:11] the promise was not made by the scoffers
[1:01:13] and all of those the promise was made by
[1:01:16] the young man and that's who he she was
[1:01:18] waiting for and the promise that was
[1:01:21] given to you is not made by any man the
[1:01:23] promise that's given to you is made by
[1:01:25] the lord jesus himself and that's who
[1:01:27] you're waiting for
[1:01:35] so we have to
[1:01:37] live under the expectation of the end
[1:01:39] time
[1:01:40] to know that
[1:01:42] our body
[1:01:43] our lives and we're going to go in a
[1:01:45] body change any time
[1:01:48] because the scoffers the scripture says
[1:01:50] the scoffers and the markers are going
[1:01:51] to come and
[1:01:53] the lasso says where is the promise of
[1:01:55] his coming
[1:01:57] it seems like since our father slept
[1:01:59] everything is just continuing the same
[1:02:04] it seems like since our prophet went
[1:02:06] well it just seems like everything
[1:02:08] continues the same
[1:02:10] it seems like it says we're going to
[1:02:12] continue on the cycle of revival and
[1:02:15] death and today we want revival tomorrow
[1:02:18] we feel like we're dead it's just going
[1:02:19] to continue
[1:02:22] but don't light that word for you
[1:02:23] because we understand it's in the time
[1:02:26] that's the most unexpected that's when
[1:02:28] he shows up it's the time where people
[1:02:31] are falling asleep and a time where
[1:02:33] people are casting it away a time where
[1:02:36] people are distracted that's the time
[1:02:38] that it shows up
[1:02:41] and i want to say this
[1:02:42] living under expectation
[1:02:45] changes your life
[1:02:50] when you live under the expectation of
[1:02:52] something it causes you to live
[1:02:55] differently
[1:02:57] i remember when we were expecting our
[1:03:00] i'm not sure if
[1:03:01] our first child and
[1:03:03] you know we'll well everything that we
[1:03:05] did was based on
[1:03:08] when is the timing going to be
[1:03:10] you know oh let's do this no we can't go
[1:03:12] out of town because the baby's going to
[1:03:14] come anytime
[1:03:15] we can't do this because the baby may
[1:03:17] come any time you become restricted by
[1:03:20] the promise by which you are waiting for
[1:03:23] i and i remember even when the time came
[1:03:27] i was i was up studying that night and i
[1:03:29] was studying and and i just finished i
[1:03:31] went and took a shower went to bed it's
[1:03:34] only 30 minutes after i hop in bed
[1:03:36] that's when the time was there it
[1:03:39] always comes in an unexpected time it's
[1:03:41] never a time that you plan and i believe
[1:03:43] it's the type of what we need to expect
[1:03:46] when the lord is going to come it's not
[1:03:48] us just any man waiting and saying well
[1:03:50] i'm waiting and he's going to come show
[1:03:52] up no he's going to come in an
[1:03:53] unexpected way this event is going to
[1:03:56] take place and some will be left behind
[1:03:58] that's what the scripture tells us
[1:04:00] but living under that expectation
[1:04:03] changes the way that you live
[1:04:08] and we know the prophet preaches a
[1:04:10] message things that are to be
[1:04:14] if if we were told today
[1:04:18] that there is going to come another
[1:04:19] covet within another week
[1:04:22] that they were going to shut down
[1:04:23] everything
[1:04:24] we'll do things differently than the way
[1:04:26] we did it first
[1:04:31] if we were told
[1:04:33] that covert is around the corner that
[1:04:35] everything will be shut perhaps we'll
[1:04:37] try to go back and we'll examine what we
[1:04:40] did at first and perhaps we'll this time
[1:04:43] try to go for the toilet paper before we
[1:04:45] can grab the food
[1:04:48] why because we've learned by experience
[1:04:51] we because because because we have been
[1:04:54] given the news it gives us a chance to
[1:04:57] prepare better
[1:04:59] and the prophet speaks about this it
[1:05:01] says god can do nothing except he
[1:05:04] reveals his mind to the prophet except
[1:05:07] he gives this prophet the word and we
[1:05:09] know the very definition of a prophet is
[1:05:12] one who's been given an eyesight to see
[1:05:14] what's coming before it's there
[1:05:18] and
[1:05:19] and we have even within this church we
[1:05:22] have gone through messages after
[1:05:24] messages describing the very period that
[1:05:27] we've gone on
[1:05:29] everything by letter of what the prophet
[1:05:31] promised that would come to pass
[1:05:34] and and the prophet tells us that it's
[1:05:37] the revealed word of god that puts us
[1:05:40] under expectation it's the word of god
[1:05:43] being revealed that's supposed to put us
[1:05:45] in motion so the motion is not just a
[1:05:48] man reading the bible and saying well
[1:05:51] what will i do with it but when god
[1:05:53] takes his word and reveals it to you
[1:05:55] that word has to put you under
[1:05:57] expectation he has to put you in motion
[1:06:00] he has to cause you to activate yourself
[1:06:03] so you can meet what he says he will do
[1:06:08] but yet we are so often time we have
[1:06:12] what he says we have
[1:06:14] the whole word of god being revealed to
[1:06:17] us he says we have the perfect
[1:06:19] interpretation
[1:06:20] of the word in this end time
[1:06:24] but oftentimes
[1:06:26] i feel like expectation of falling short
[1:06:29] of what we should be living by
[1:06:32] to just come to a place where you
[1:06:34] realize
[1:06:35] i have been given the word
[1:06:38] we have been told what's about to come
[1:06:41] the promise of a body change is around
[1:06:43] the corner
[1:06:44] if we're living for the body change
[1:06:46] then the life that we live has to
[1:06:49] reflect that we are living for the body
[1:06:51] change then the things that we engage in
[1:06:54] has to reflect that this person is
[1:06:57] living an expectation for that body
[1:06:59] change to take on any time
[1:07:05] so
[1:07:06] the prophet speaks about
[1:07:08] abraham
[1:07:10] and sarah
[1:07:13] he speaks about abraham and sarah and
[1:07:15] this is in regards
[1:07:17] to the body being changed and he speaks
[1:07:19] about this it says
[1:07:22] in the message of the feast of the
[1:07:23] trumpet it says
[1:07:25] notice what happened happen
[1:07:27] immediately
[1:07:29] should turn back to the lovely young
[1:07:31] woman
[1:07:33] showing in there portraying what's going
[1:07:36] what he's going to do
[1:07:40] what is going to what what is going to
[1:07:42] do
[1:07:43] the royal seed of abraham
[1:07:46] to re to receive
[1:07:49] the sons that's been promised
[1:07:51] should turn
[1:07:52] back to a young
[1:07:54] it says look
[1:07:56] they went down to gerrard
[1:07:59] and what happened
[1:08:00] abhimalek the king fell in love with her
[1:08:04] she
[1:08:05] it says
[1:08:06] she's fair and beautiful
[1:08:09] it says she was going
[1:08:11] he says and was going to marry her is
[1:08:13] that right the old grandma all of them
[1:08:17] other pretty girls down there granny
[1:08:20] she's beautiful she's a fair look she's
[1:08:23] fair to look upon
[1:08:24] it says god changed her body
[1:08:30] abraham and sarah didn't change their
[1:08:32] own body
[1:08:33] but i want you to remember they were
[1:08:34] living under the expectation of this
[1:08:36] baby coming
[1:08:38] and and the prophet said
[1:08:40] yeah they are
[1:08:42] but they weren't in fact
[1:08:44] even we can uh uh just to summarize the
[1:08:47] story we know when the promise was given
[1:08:50] god came and visited them uh spoke to
[1:08:53] them many times and and in all kinds of
[1:08:55] ways and yet they are because they were
[1:08:58] living under the expectation they went
[1:09:00] and they bought everything that they
[1:09:02] needed in preparation for the baby
[1:09:04] coming the prophet tells us what they
[1:09:07] did and they went and they prepared a
[1:09:10] room for the baby and they brought crips
[1:09:12] and they brought all kinds of things and
[1:09:14] and yet people were looking at them
[1:09:16] thinking they're crazy they have lost
[1:09:18] their mind but this is the action of one
[1:09:20] who's received a word from god this is
[1:09:23] the action of whom one was heard from
[1:09:25] god they're living under the expectation
[1:09:28] of what god told them regardless of what
[1:09:31] people will think about them
[1:09:35] and but random speaks about it at length
[1:09:37] and said yes she was a milk vein was
[1:09:40] dried up and she had no strength that
[1:09:43] she could give she could give birth to a
[1:09:45] baby but yet she received a promise of
[1:09:48] god and she lived under the expectation
[1:09:52] of the promise that was given to her
[1:09:55] and the expectation of the promise made
[1:09:58] that she made a room ready the
[1:10:00] expectation of the promise caused that
[1:10:02] she went and bought everything that was
[1:10:04] needed for a baby why because she knew
[1:10:07] that the baby will come anytime oh my
[1:10:09] brother my sister don't we know that to
[1:10:11] change your body will happen at any time
[1:10:16] the scripture says it's in a twinkling
[1:10:18] of an eye that what caused the change
[1:10:22] what caused the change was the promise
[1:10:24] that was given to them what caused the
[1:10:26] change was they have received the word
[1:10:28] of god and they were living in
[1:10:30] expectation for that word to become a
[1:10:32] reality in their lives oh if we can live
[1:10:35] under the expectation of the word that
[1:10:37] we have received today
[1:10:41] to be ready to know that this will
[1:10:43] happen anytime
[1:10:45] it says god changed her body and turned
[1:10:48] them back it says it's a it's a mystery
[1:10:52] that is to be revealed now in this time
[1:10:55] in this day
[1:10:58] but what i'm now saying this is not just
[1:11:01] something that happened that god did one
[1:11:03] time and and that was the end of it no
[1:11:06] he's now letting you know that god did
[1:11:09] it because he knew that there would come
[1:11:12] a seat of abraham at the end time that
[1:11:14] god will have to change their bodies too
[1:11:17] god will come and he promised that he
[1:11:19] will give them another body and they
[1:11:21] would have to live under the same
[1:11:23] expectation as sarah and abraham live
[1:11:26] that they would have to have the same
[1:11:28] faith that sarah and abraham had
[1:11:31] god changed her body it says it's the
[1:11:34] mystery that has to be revealed in this
[1:11:36] end time by the son of man it says see
[1:11:39] the evening message see
[1:11:41] turn back
[1:11:42] and that was the last sign that they
[1:11:45] seen
[1:11:46] what the discernment before the change
[1:11:49] of the body came
[1:11:52] and before we can ever receive the sun
[1:11:54] what happens the trump of god shall
[1:11:57] sound the dead in christ shall rise
[1:12:00] first and the new body he says and we
[1:12:04] which alive and remain shall be changed
[1:12:06] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:12:09] hallelujah and we shall be caught up
[1:12:12] together to meet the lord in the air
[1:12:15] it says the secret has been made known
[1:12:19] the seals are open amen
[1:12:23] what is the whole secret
[1:12:26] the god
[1:12:27] is coming in the same time
[1:12:29] what changed the body the change of body
[1:12:32] didn't come until the manifestation of
[1:12:35] god in the human flesh standing before
[1:12:38] abraham and performing the sign of the
[1:12:41] messiah when they saw that sign that
[1:12:44] caused the body to be changed for them
[1:12:47] to be ready for the coming of the son oh
[1:12:50] my brother my sister if god opened up
[1:12:52] the secret in the time of abraham that
[1:12:55] same secret has been made known to us so
[1:12:58] that we can know by this message that we
[1:13:00] believe that the sign of the messiah
[1:13:03] that was produced in our time god coming
[1:13:06] in the human flesh and making himself
[1:13:08] known standing there to do the same sign
[1:13:12] is not a sign so we can say oh we've
[1:13:14] seen jesus and that's wonderful no it's
[1:13:17] a sign to cause the body change
[1:13:27] says the trump shall sound this trump
[1:13:30] sounded for israel
[1:13:32] and the two
[1:13:35] prophets is ready to appear what is it
[1:13:37] the church must be off must get off the
[1:13:40] scene right now
[1:13:42] so they can appear
[1:13:44] he can't deal with two of at the same
[1:13:47] time he never did
[1:13:50] the scripture says in first
[1:13:51] thessalonians
[1:13:52] chapter 4 15 it says
[1:13:55] for this
[1:13:57] for this
[1:13:58] we say unto thee unto you by the word of
[1:14:01] god
[1:14:02] that that which
[1:14:04] it says that that which are alive
[1:14:08] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:14:11] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:14:15] for the lord himself shall descend
[1:14:18] from heaven
[1:14:20] with a shout and with the voice of an
[1:14:22] archangel
[1:14:23] and with the trump of god and the dead
[1:14:26] in christ shall rise first then
[1:14:29] it says then we which are alive and
[1:14:31] remain
[1:14:32] shall be caught up together
[1:14:35] with him with him in the clouds
[1:14:38] it says
[1:14:39] to meet the lord in the air so shall we
[1:14:42] be ever
[1:14:44] with the lord
[1:14:46] and so as we can see this promise is now
[1:14:49] given to get us ready to say
[1:14:52] that the lord himself shall descend
[1:14:54] and we know that the prophet preached
[1:14:56] the message the rapture and he went into
[1:14:59] the order of the rapture to show what
[1:15:01] the voice was what the shout was and and
[1:15:04] what all those things were so but he is
[1:15:07] wanting to show that these things are
[1:15:10] given to us to get us in preparation for
[1:15:13] the event that is to come
[1:15:15] and if we don't eat of it if we don't
[1:15:18] become what they said if we don't eat of
[1:15:21] the word and we don't manifest the
[1:15:23] things that the word says then how we're
[1:15:26] going to be ready for the event what
[1:15:28] what gets us ready for the event is the
[1:15:30] fact that god is here to manifest every
[1:15:34] promise that he has given so we can get
[1:15:36] ready for that event
[1:15:40] the prophet said in the message rapture
[1:15:42] and says
[1:15:43] it says in three
[1:15:44] three things happen a voice and a shout
[1:15:47] and
[1:15:47] and it says a voice in the trump he says
[1:15:51] has to happen before jesus christ
[1:15:53] appeared it says now the shout jesus
[1:15:56] does all three of them
[1:15:59] when he's descending
[1:16:01] a shout
[1:16:03] what is a shout it says it's the message
[1:16:06] going forth
[1:16:08] first
[1:16:09] the living bread
[1:16:11] of the the living bread of life
[1:16:14] bringing forth the bride
[1:16:17] the living bread
[1:16:19] of life
[1:16:20] bringing forth the bride
[1:16:23] so therefore we are here because we've
[1:16:25] been brought there's been a word that
[1:16:28] went to gather us from all the corners
[1:16:30] of the earth bringing forth the bride
[1:16:33] there was a message that went forth and
[1:16:35] when we heard it something within our
[1:16:38] heart pricked and
[1:16:39] the prophet says it so beautifully in
[1:16:41] the rising of the sun it says yet we are
[1:16:44] he says you that were once drunken and
[1:16:47] sinners and everything but the rising of
[1:16:49] the sun has caused something within your
[1:16:52] heart to be stand up to stand up and to
[1:16:55] answer back the call of the sun he says
[1:16:57] that the sun when he rose up it dried up
[1:17:00] the ground it dried up everything it
[1:17:03] took away all of the things that were
[1:17:06] hiding you away from the sun so it can
[1:17:08] bring you into the manifestation of the
[1:17:11] sun what the sun was calling therefore
[1:17:14] the seed had to come forth
[1:17:20] he asked a question he says
[1:17:22] they asked him a question it says
[1:17:24] but ronan please explain acts
[1:17:27] 9 and verse 7
[1:17:29] or acts 20 and 22 verse would you get
[1:17:32] this for me brother neville says explain

[1:17:39] see if i can get another one right quick
[1:17:43] it says are you getting tired i know he
[1:17:45] says please explain the mystery of
[1:17:47] translation of the bride
[1:17:49] how it says how will it take place where
[1:17:53] uh the place and the and the bride goes
[1:17:57] it says isn't them lovely question it
[1:17:59] says that's really nice i'll just stand
[1:18:02] here all day
[1:18:04] it says just a minute
[1:18:07] let me just skip and send an amen which
[1:18:09] journey with them
[1:18:10] so let me start from paragraph uh 238 it
[1:18:14] says now i know i i says i know where
[1:18:17] you're going i know where you're going
[1:18:19] it says now the next place it says vice
[1:18:22] versa i don't know what to take what
[1:18:24] what take
[1:18:26] what taken place here i just couldn't
[1:18:28] tell you um because the next place uh
[1:18:31] they hear
[1:18:32] uh one of them they didn't see it it
[1:18:35] says the next place they seen it and
[1:18:37] they did hear it how many
[1:18:40] how many has ever seen
[1:18:42] has ever seen that before in the bible
[1:18:45] it says i have i can't explain it the
[1:18:47] lord will have to reveal them to me
[1:18:55] let me just skip so i can get to what
[1:18:57] i'm looking for
[1:19:02] let me go to paragraph 242.
[1:19:05] it says please explain the mystery of
[1:19:08] translation of the bride it says just to
[1:19:10] change just to change see our bodies it
[1:19:13] says let's say
[1:19:15] you know what it says you know what i
[1:19:17] mean when i say that i don't mean to be
[1:19:20] sacrilegious i don't mean to say ours i
[1:19:23] don't mean to say this church i mean to
[1:19:25] say
[1:19:26] every believer
[1:19:28] he says abraham was looking for a
[1:19:30] promised son that was promised him
[1:19:33] is that right and the church is looking
[1:19:36] for a promised son the bride is that
[1:19:38] right the bride is looking for the
[1:19:40] promised son before the promised son
[1:19:43] could come to sarah and abraham their
[1:19:46] bodies had to be changed is that right
[1:19:49] he says she was too old to have a baby
[1:19:53] she had no milk vein in her breast her
[1:19:56] breast was dried up her womb wasn't
[1:19:59] fertile fertile it says she was sterile
[1:20:03] she could not have the baby he says our
[1:20:06] heart was too old to stand labor so she
[1:20:10] said so what happened
[1:20:12] oh i love this now he's giving you all
[1:20:16] the condition possible that this can
[1:20:18] never happen
[1:20:21] and and often time i looked at it
[1:20:23] because remember it's the same type of
[1:20:26] us we look at ourselves and says well i
[1:20:28] have so many weaknesses i have this and
[1:20:30] i have that and and and i do this and i
[1:20:33] have to do that so you lay out all your
[1:20:35] excuses and it's letting you do that
[1:20:38] go on pour out all your excuses why you
[1:20:41] can't have a son show all that you can
[1:20:44] you pour it out all out and then after
[1:20:46] you finish it says god change her back
[1:20:49] to a young woman
[1:20:52] it's not about us changing ourselves
[1:20:54] it's about us being committed to god's
[1:20:56] plan to know that he's here to change us
[1:21:00] and if we need changing we got to be
[1:21:02] committed to the plan
[1:21:07] it's like being committed to uh you know
[1:21:10] because i thought you
[1:21:12] know let me just use this as an example
[1:21:15] i'll get back you know we we we
[1:21:18] oftentimes when we read about this
[1:21:20] translation of a body i thought oh you
[1:21:23] know perhaps we just need to look at the
[1:21:25] natural example you know we we
[1:21:27] experience body changes every time
[1:21:30] we expand we contract and you know we do
[1:21:33] all of those things but you cannot you
[1:21:37] and and and every time whether you
[1:21:39] expand or contract is an effort that you
[1:21:41] put in
[1:21:44] you know if you put an effort in eating
[1:21:46] too much you expand
[1:21:48] it's a body change when you when you
[1:21:51] want to change and get thinner you have
[1:21:53] to put an effort into working out some
[1:21:56] form of something and going into the gym
[1:21:59] doing some work
[1:22:00] none of which will happen by itself
[1:22:02] there has to be some effort put in
[1:22:07] because oftentimes we try to
[1:22:08] spiritualize everything but we realize
[1:22:10] that the very natural things are showing
[1:22:13] us what god is really telling us
[1:22:15] we we expand and we contract based on
[1:22:18] the effort that we put in you know and
[1:22:20] as you get old sometimes all you have to
[1:22:22] do is to smell food in order to gain
[1:22:24] weight you know it's just it it just
[1:22:27] happens but you realize that wait wait
[1:22:30] if you if you want your body to be in
[1:22:32] shape it can never be in check by itself
[1:22:36] you got to put some effort into it you
[1:22:38] got to eat right you got to sleep right
[1:22:41] you got to uh uh
[1:22:43] put some iron and and do some exercises
[1:22:45] in order for you to be in shape
[1:22:47] otherwise you get the result of whatever
[1:22:50] effort you're putting in
[1:22:52] and therefore years the bible has given
[1:22:54] us but god changed him why because they
[1:22:58] were committed to god's plan of changing
[1:23:01] and how did they show their commitment
[1:23:03] they went and bought the crib
[1:23:06] they went and told all their neighbors
[1:23:08] about the baby coming
[1:23:10] they wanted to do everything that they
[1:23:12] could in other words what men could do
[1:23:14] they did
[1:23:16] everything that they could do they did
[1:23:18] why they did their part and waited for
[1:23:20] god to do his part
[1:23:25] but random says if you say go see a
[1:23:27] doctor let him examine you let him do
[1:23:29] what he can do he can advise something
[1:23:32] and all those things but when the doctor
[1:23:34] comes to an end when it comes to where
[1:23:37] he can no longer do anything for you
[1:23:39] when it comes to where he's giving you
[1:23:41] bad news what one of them says you have
[1:23:43] the right to petition a higher physician
[1:23:47] you have the right to go to god and say
[1:23:49] now i went to the doctor like you said
[1:23:51] and this is what he gave me and i don't
[1:23:53] accept what he told me now i come to you
[1:23:56] the great physician and i have the right
[1:23:58] to petition you
[1:24:04] we see the body change every day
[1:24:08] and therefore we have to know
[1:24:10] it says that god
[1:24:14] god
[1:24:15] changed her back to a young woman
[1:24:18] it says he did it
[1:24:20] abraham the same thing
[1:24:22] because he said his body
[1:24:24] was as good as dead
[1:24:28] now i want you to remember
[1:24:30] this was not necessarily just changing
[1:24:32] them young again
[1:24:36] because they were young at one time
[1:24:39] they still couldn't have a son
[1:24:43] they were at the age where they could
[1:24:44] have had a son and they still didn't
[1:24:46] have
[1:24:47] god came and they changed the elements
[1:24:51] that's why i love that message who's
[1:24:53] this melchizedek so much
[1:24:55] he was the creator of heaven and earth
[1:24:56] we knew him as that
[1:24:58] he was the one who came and he
[1:25:00] manifested himself as jehovah we knew
[1:25:02] him as that so why was he so important
[1:25:05] that he can come as melchizedek the
[1:25:07] reason is melchizedek
[1:25:09] why they had to come with melchizedek is
[1:25:12] from is because of where melchizedek
[1:25:14] came from melchizedek was the manifested
[1:25:17] thoughts of god being finished he was
[1:25:20] there when he showed up he was there as
[1:25:22] the finished work of god the word of god
[1:25:26] that he can stand there and know exactly
[1:25:28] what could happen
[1:25:30] know exactly what he had planned and
[1:25:32] tell abraham that i have a plan and the
[1:25:35] plane is going to happen exactly as i
[1:25:37] said it's going to happen
[1:25:41] and that's why he did the same thing
[1:25:43] with us
[1:25:44] none other than melchizedek himself came
[1:25:47] he looked at you and he told you about
[1:25:49] your natural body he told you what was
[1:25:51] wrong with you he told you about your
[1:25:54] natural birth after he said all of that
[1:25:56] he told you now if i told you about your
[1:25:58] natural birth you believe can i now tell
[1:26:00] you about this other birth of where you
[1:26:03] came from before you can have this
[1:26:05] natural birth
[1:26:08] it says
[1:26:10] and he had abraha and had changed and
[1:26:12] they had to change abraham the body in
[1:26:15] order for them you know the in order to
[1:26:17] receive the promised son
[1:26:19] and we cannot receive the promised son
[1:26:22] that's promised to us
[1:26:25] in these bodies that we are living in
[1:26:28] this body of sin
[1:26:30] now i want you to see now how he's
[1:26:33] transitioning he talked about abraham
[1:26:35] now he's transitioning he says now
[1:26:38] this first conscience controls this
[1:26:41] controls this body
[1:26:43] with sea taste smell here
[1:26:47] and it's just got
[1:26:48] it just got us all scribbled up
[1:26:51] it says re-reason everything else and
[1:26:54] it says that we are new
[1:26:55] but but we are new
[1:26:57] but but that new body it says that comes
[1:27:01] from
[1:27:02] this born again
[1:27:05] not the conscience not not this first
[1:27:08] conscience it passed away
[1:27:11] it says
[1:27:12] it's that inside something that lives
[1:27:17] he's telling you now the mystery of this
[1:27:19] body change how are you going to come to
[1:27:22] it he's now letting you now paul says it
[1:27:25] is sown in this court but yet it's
[1:27:28] ripping glory it is in weakness but yet
[1:27:30] just reveal itself so he's now saying
[1:27:33] within this mortal body that we are in
[1:27:36] god is sowing something inside by which
[1:27:40] the new body will come
[1:27:44] so you look it's not this natural body
[1:27:46] this natural body will fight with it
[1:27:48] until we are out of here but he says
[1:27:50] it's now something that's thrown inside
[1:27:54] it says and everybody understood i
[1:27:56] understood it say amen it says it's not
[1:27:59] this outside taste feels smells here it
[1:28:03] isn't
[1:28:04] it's subject to death and will die but
[1:28:08] ins that's the inside part of you
[1:28:11] down in down in here inside
[1:28:14] that is the person that cannot die
[1:28:21] it says see
[1:28:22] that's the person that their new life
[1:28:26] starts from
[1:28:30] we heard this morning men cannot live by
[1:28:33] word alone but by every word of god
[1:28:36] and it's because we firmly have to
[1:28:39] understand
[1:28:40] what the word of god does in our lives
[1:28:44] we are born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:28:46] coming to this world living
[1:28:49] speaking lies and all the things and we
[1:28:51] know that in fact paul speaks it says we
[1:28:54] we are acquainted with the earthly
[1:28:56] because we are born in the earth no one
[1:28:58] can tell you what it means to be human
[1:29:00] because you've experienced it
[1:29:02] but it says the same way that we have
[1:29:04] experienced the earthly so shall we
[1:29:07] experience the heavenly it says but here
[1:29:10] is how it starts it's not by that birth
[1:29:12] in other words god is coming into this
[1:29:15] flesh but it's by this new man a new
[1:29:19] creation that is starting within this
[1:29:21] flesh
[1:29:22] it's not the old man put together you
[1:29:25] teach him how to do right to learn right
[1:29:27] to do that's not what we're looking for
[1:29:29] you can get this flesh in order and
[1:29:31] still miss it
[1:29:34] now that we have a promise to bring it
[1:29:36] under subjection but it doesn't start
[1:29:39] every time you look at your flesh in
[1:29:41] order for you to correct it you're
[1:29:43] studying at the wrong place where it
[1:29:45] starts it's a new life within you that
[1:29:48] that grows together and it grows and it
[1:29:50] grows and once it's grown he has the
[1:29:53] ability to conquer this flesh and that's
[1:29:56] the body that's the person that the new
[1:29:58] body is built for
[1:30:01] amen
[1:30:03] it says
[1:30:05] but it's a part that's it's but it's
[1:30:07] inside a part of you down in there
[1:30:10] inside that person that cannot die and
[1:30:12] see that's the person that the new life
[1:30:14] starts from it says from this new birth
[1:30:17] it says it's built around another person
[1:30:21] in the image of the person that you are
[1:30:25] oh wow i love it
[1:30:27] it's build that new person
[1:30:30] it says
[1:30:31] and he and it builds another person in
[1:30:34] the image of this person that you are
[1:30:38] in other words
[1:30:40] what was in the mind of god in the
[1:30:42] beginning
[1:30:44] began to materialize in this flesh
[1:30:47] i'll tell you this my desire ever in my
[1:30:50] life is to be that manifestation of the
[1:30:53] thoughts of god being manifested what a
[1:30:56] belief that what a believer desires is
[1:30:59] when my decisions when i make a decision
[1:31:02] to be in line and in accordance with
[1:31:05] what decision he already made for me
[1:31:08] when i'm aligning myself with the
[1:31:10] thoughts of god that was in the
[1:31:12] beginning about me when i'm beginning to
[1:31:14] make my decisions and reflecting the
[1:31:17] very attributes of who he was or what he
[1:31:20] made me to be that's the desires of my
[1:31:23] heart it says the image a person that
[1:31:26] builds it says the image and around your
[1:31:29] life you get it he continues on he says
[1:31:32] so potentially it's in here
[1:31:38] what is it
[1:31:39] the word promised before the foundation
[1:31:42] of the world the world
[1:31:44] around and around here
[1:31:47] this only reflects the negative
[1:31:50] it says that reflects the positive
[1:31:53] the word see
[1:31:55] and the same thing is it says of the
[1:31:58] translation of the bride will be the
[1:32:00] same thing it says the word that's in
[1:32:03] you
[1:32:05] the body will materialize around that
[1:32:09] word
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:14] he says in one place he said
[1:32:16] that body is the word when you sit here
[1:32:20] and you desire to be stronger to
[1:32:23] overcome something
[1:32:24] it says it's like a positive charge
[1:32:27] coming from that body coming down on you
[1:32:30] and touching you to make you stronger
[1:32:33] let me say this that body existed before
[1:32:36] this body
[1:32:37] so everything that you have need of
[1:32:40] already exists in that body all you're
[1:32:42] doing is just transferring the
[1:32:44] attributes and the positivity that
[1:32:47] exists in that body into the body of
[1:32:49] flesh that we have
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:55] that's why christianity is so messed up
[1:32:57] because the world looks at it it says oh
[1:33:00] you got to work up so you can be like
[1:33:02] jesus so you can be like this he himself
[1:33:05] is looking at you and say no i already
[1:33:08] made everything let me say this every
[1:33:10] attributes about god everything about
[1:33:13] god is already finished he's already
[1:33:16] accomplished
[1:33:17] the the the healing is already done it's
[1:33:20] something of a past deliverance is
[1:33:23] something of the past we are called to
[1:33:25] come and partake of those defined
[1:33:27] natures so they could be manifested to
[1:33:30] us
[1:33:32] it's not something god has to work out
[1:33:34] and say well they're asking something i
[1:33:36] didn't think of now i gotta find a way
[1:33:38] to bring it up no it's you calling this
[1:33:41] body over here to come into
[1:33:43] manifestation in this realm why because
[1:33:46] you have need of it
[1:33:53] the word that's in you the body will
[1:33:56] materialize
[1:33:58] around that word
[1:34:00] the same thing
[1:34:01] did by sarah before
[1:34:05] when the old body
[1:34:07] that she had
[1:34:09] that first body
[1:34:10] it had no it had to be changed in order
[1:34:14] to produce the sun you get it
[1:34:16] the body could not do it the body could
[1:34:19] not do it so it had to be changed
[1:34:22] the same way to receive the sun
[1:34:33] let me just skip for the second time
[1:34:36] it says again in question and answer
[1:34:41] he says
[1:34:44] i think it says just think
[1:34:47] the very lord jesus was back there in
[1:34:50] the days of the apostle is that right
[1:34:53] here now
[1:34:54] it says
[1:34:56] it's just winding up the end of the
[1:34:59] gentiles
[1:35:00] a great move
[1:35:02] is going on among the supernatural
[1:35:04] believers
[1:35:05] because we believe that god is here
[1:35:08] says just think
[1:35:10] your glorified body
[1:35:12] is right here in the tabernacle now
[1:35:18] your glorified body is right here in the
[1:35:21] tabernacle now
[1:35:23] the presence of the holy ghost of the
[1:35:25] holy spirit which is your glorified
[1:35:28] condition
[1:35:30] you are glorified in christ right now
[1:35:36] so even what we are trying to attain
[1:35:40] god has already built it for us
[1:35:42] he's wanting us to be partakers in the
[1:35:45] experience so we can know what it is
[1:35:48] it says and you'll glorify it says
[1:35:50] you're glorified you are glorified in
[1:35:52] christ right now
[1:35:54] those who he justify he glorify
[1:35:58] and and your your own glory and and your
[1:36:02] own glorified body is standing near
[1:36:05] right now in christ jesus
[1:36:08] to give you
[1:36:10] a strength like a charge going into a
[1:36:13] battery
[1:36:17] let me say this
[1:36:19] that thought
[1:36:20] that body
[1:36:22] can never be for somebody else it's
[1:36:24] yours
[1:36:28] it's not given to give charge to anybody
[1:36:31] else but you
[1:36:32] so your expression down here
[1:36:36] he's already got the complete expression
[1:36:38] on the other side
[1:36:40] he's only calling you so you can partake
[1:36:42] of it and this is where
[1:36:44] we rejoice to know that if he's got it
[1:36:47] already finished what do i have to worry
[1:36:49] about is i'm calling you to partake of
[1:36:52] it so you can come in the fullness
[1:36:54] that's why he says what is adoption is
[1:36:56] god trying to bring you into that
[1:36:58] fullness
[1:37:02] but oh my we have so many other things
[1:37:04] that stops us from going into the
[1:37:06] fullness
[1:37:08] we desire this we want that we want this
[1:37:11] but yet the question we should be asking
[1:37:12] is any of the things that i'm wanting
[1:37:15] and i'm desiring is it going to get me
[1:37:17] into that fullness
[1:37:20] it says it's to give you strength like a
[1:37:22] charge going into a battery the holy
[1:37:25] spirit it's the holy spirit in you
[1:37:28] it's to charge your body to give you the
[1:37:31] new strength
[1:37:32] to give you new strength to heal you
[1:37:36] from the sicknesses that you've got
[1:37:38] make you well
[1:37:42] you already got your healing
[1:37:45] you already got your deliverance
[1:37:47] everything that you're struggling with
[1:37:49] now god has already got it all finished
[1:37:51] up for you so it's for you to come and
[1:37:54] get it it for you to come and desire it
[1:37:56] it's for you to walk in the way
[1:37:59] that he has provided
[1:38:02] so therefore when we hear the word of
[1:38:04] god
[1:38:05] it's that charge
[1:38:07] coming into us to give us strength so we
[1:38:10] can continue
[1:38:11] if the musician could come
[1:38:38] i want to say this
[1:38:48] we have to desire to see that power of
[1:38:50] transformation that is in the word work
[1:38:52] in us
[1:38:57] but branham talks about the devil being
[1:38:58] a deformer
[1:39:03] and if you look at the difference
[1:39:04] between transformation and
[1:39:07] and deformation
[1:39:09] the difference is
[1:39:11] transformation takes you to
[1:39:14] your purpose to what you're supposed to
[1:39:16] do
[1:39:17] and to deform you is to cause you to not
[1:39:20] fulfill your purpose
[1:39:22] to become something different something
[1:39:24] that you were not called to be
[1:39:26] to manifest something that you were not
[1:39:28] originally intended to become
[1:39:31] but here is god's word with the power of
[1:39:33] transformation in it
[1:39:35] to cause that transformation to come
[1:39:38] you know we don't do all kinds to to for
[1:39:41] us to expand we don't do any exercise
[1:39:44] just eat and relax
[1:39:45] it can go to bed and go to bed you will
[1:39:48] see that happen you will wake up one
[1:39:50] morning and realize man i've transformed
[1:39:56] but if you don't eat you don't see the
[1:39:58] change
[1:40:00] you eat you see the change but
[1:40:03] talks about the farmer and the seed he
[1:40:04] said that seed has to drink more than
[1:40:08] its portion
[1:40:09] he has to drink more than it can handle
[1:40:12] so it will burst up and open up and
[1:40:14] produce a fruit
[1:40:16] but it seems like sometimes we just want
[1:40:17] to sip you know you just take a sip
[1:40:19] you're like oh that's enough
[1:40:21] until next time
[1:40:23] you're not going to be in good shape
[1:40:28] and just fyi the best shape i'm talking
[1:40:30] about is a fat christian is one who's
[1:40:32] filled with the promises of god one who
[1:40:35] eats right one who knows his promises
[1:40:37] one who knows what god has given him
[1:40:40] and he takes it and he goes outside and
[1:40:42] the exercise is right
[1:40:45] i'm i'm a believer i'm a son of god he
[1:40:48] called me here for a reason he placed me
[1:40:50] here for a reason i tell you we have to
[1:40:52] desire that when we see god's mind
[1:40:56] manifested in our choices that should be
[1:40:59] the desire of each christian
[1:41:02] when i make a choice i can go home and
[1:41:04] say this is god's mind being manifested
[1:41:07] not when i do i go and i go and i hit my
[1:41:10] head against the wall and said what did
[1:41:11] you just do you know how stupid can you
[1:41:14] be no when when
[1:41:16] he so poured himself into me until what
[1:41:19] i say it's what he said
[1:41:20] [Music]
[1:41:23] it's not the age where we just come and
[1:41:25] get a little bit and just get a little
[1:41:27] bit no it's the age of adoption
[1:41:31] an adoption is to be about the father's
[1:41:33] business when you woke up in the morning
[1:41:35] all you're thinking about is what does
[1:41:37] the father want me to do today
[1:41:39] who did the f who does the father wants
[1:41:41] me to speak to today i'm here
[1:41:44] and something happened you come to the
[1:41:46] realization that i'm standing here for a
[1:41:48] reason it's because god wants me to
[1:41:51] stand here if i can hear what that
[1:41:53] person is talking about that they need
[1:41:54] help is because god wants me to hear and
[1:41:57] go over there and say something about it
[1:42:02] one who knows a position
[1:42:04] one who can come into the position to
[1:42:06] wear
[1:42:07] the word of god
[1:42:09] they know what position the word of god
[1:42:11] has in their lives
[1:42:13] not one who has the word to use it only
[1:42:16] when i need it i'll go my way when i
[1:42:19] need the word of god then i'll add it to
[1:42:21] my formula and get what i need no one
[1:42:24] who's fully surrendered to the promise
[1:42:26] one who's fully surrendered to the
[1:42:28] program
[1:42:29] you can never be successful until you
[1:42:32] fully surrender to the program
[1:42:34] there's no such thing as halfway
[1:42:36] questions
[1:42:37] you're never gonna make it
[1:42:43] we have to be surrendered to the program
[1:42:46] we have to be given to the program when
[1:42:48] you go to a boot camp you give into the
[1:42:51] program you follow everything that's
[1:42:53] when you graduate
[1:42:54] it's not when you're one foot in one
[1:42:56] foot out but we are here to be committed
[1:42:59] to the program god bless you let's all
[1:43:01] stand
[1:43:05] [Music]

[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:10] are
[1:47:12] so distracted with life
[1:47:15] but tonight you heard of one of the best
[1:47:18] explanations
[1:47:21] and i've been in this message 50 years
[1:47:25] or more
[1:47:28] you heard the best explanation tonight
[1:47:32] of your theophany
[1:47:35] calling for you
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:39] it's exactly what it is
[1:47:43] how many knows that satan has something
[1:47:45] you'd like you to be
[1:47:48] got a perfect place for you
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:52] just
[1:47:53] just some place that you would fit in
[1:47:55] his kingdom
[1:47:56] but you understood what he said god
[1:47:58] already had this body in mind it was
[1:48:01] here
[1:48:03] before you were
[1:48:05] you got to remember you dropped down
[1:48:09] from where you were supposed to be you
[1:48:11] dropped down here and got this thing
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:16] have you started to learn to hate it
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:20] i just get a kick out of
[1:48:23] people that just get so hung up in the
[1:48:25] mirror
[1:48:30] don't they know it's corrupting
[1:48:32] it's dying and pretty soon like i said
[1:48:34] this morning they're trying to keep it
[1:48:36] beautiful and it's decaying
[1:48:39] but there was another body
[1:48:42] and that body needs you
[1:48:45] to be whole
[1:48:47] it needs your life
[1:48:49] in it yes
[1:48:51] and it's calling for you
[1:48:53] come
[1:48:54] the seed life that's in you it's not
[1:48:57] meant for this body
[1:49:00] think of it there's one up there that
[1:49:02] it's meant for
[1:49:03] and now it's time has come yes
[1:49:08] it's time has come and it's calling for
[1:49:11] you come unto me when you begin to hear
[1:49:15] your theophany call for you you know
[1:49:18] that that
[1:49:19] time is nigh
[1:49:22] though satan don't want to let you go he
[1:49:24] wants to use your body
[1:49:26] yeah for what
[1:49:28] he wants to use it for firewood
[1:49:32] for his hellhole
[1:49:34] that he's going to be in
[1:49:37] i'm glad i'm getting a call from god
[1:49:39] aren't you
[1:49:40] i'm glad there's another body
[1:49:42] but i hope we take it
[1:49:44] and and
[1:49:46] take it
[1:49:47] exactly
[1:49:48] what our brother shared with us tonight
[1:49:51] can you you'll get strength from that
[1:49:53] body
[1:49:54] because he can't let you fail
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:49:58] he can't let you fail
[1:50:01] he won't lose one
[1:50:03] i'm thrilled with that
[1:50:05] tonight i i'm really thrilled with that
[1:50:08] in fact i'm going to go listen to that
[1:50:11] message and write all kinds of notes and
[1:50:14] go someplace and preach it
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:20] where it's not so common
[1:50:22] and everybody will shout and
[1:50:25] have a wonderful time but i'm shouting
[1:50:28] having a wonderful time
[1:50:30] why why does that mean so much to me
[1:50:32] because it's my security
[1:50:35] [Music]
[1:50:36] you understand it's my security
[1:50:40] we can't fail because there's somebody
[1:50:42] that's got to have you it
[1:50:46] gets me feeling good
[1:50:48] somebody wants me
[1:50:52] someone's got it
[1:51:31] the world and even with doctors
[1:52:00] after that this
[1:52:03] your cells that belong to you
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:07] and that life can be
[1:52:09] driven out
[1:52:11] and cast out
