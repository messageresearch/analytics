[35:14] ones that have gone on but you can come
[35:16] be their portion Lord just pray that
[35:19] you'd pull them into your bosom tonight
[35:22] Lord you'd be their portion and you
[35:24] would comfort them Lord
[35:27] so many others that have lost loved ones
[35:30] Lord and maybe the years have gone by
[35:32] but they carry that with them
[35:34] Lord I have certain loved ones certain
[35:37] ones just flooding my heart right now
[35:39] Lord may you go to them Father and be
[35:41] their
[35:42] portion may they just feel your presence
[35:45] sweep into the room and pick them up
[35:47] once again
[35:48] and remind them how much you love them
[35:51] and that you've been the one carrying
[35:52] them this whole
[35:54] time lord we come to this portion in the
[35:57] service
[36:00] we're completely helpless without
[36:03] you we're looking to you the author and
[36:05] the finish of our faith that you would
[36:07] move on the scene now Lord and you just
[36:09] take the little thought and the words
[36:11] Lord and if it would be you that would
[36:14] come and take it and distribute it to
[36:16] your children then they could be edified
[36:18] and they can be blessed Lord and we'll
[36:20] give you all the praise and all the
[36:22] glory and honor that you deserve Lord we
[36:25] love you and ask these blessings in
[36:26] Jesus Christ's name
[36:28] amen praise the Lord if you have your
[36:30] Bibles let's turn in Luke Chapter
[36:35] 2 man I've been enjoying the cooler
[36:40] weather I ran out the door to go to work
[36:43] and I I realized I wasn't properly
[36:45] dressed I had I had to go back in and
[36:48] get another layer I tell you us Texans
[36:49] we love it when that starts to happen
[36:51] yes sir but you know it might be back in
[36:53] the hundreds tomorrow so who knows but
[36:55] we we enjoy it while we can don't we
[36:58] amen it's just good to see all of you uh
[37:00] y'all just keep me in prayer it seems
[37:03] like we've had a little bit of a a busy
[37:05] schedule with our travels and some trips
[37:09] uh also coming up um so please just uh
[37:12] remember us we covet your prayers and we
[37:14] long to be in Fellowship here with you
[37:16] and I got to think and I I don't know if
[37:18] I want to keep telling you that I want
[37:20] to I'd like to be here more often the
[37:21] more I tell you it seems like the
[37:23] further I'm away so I thought maybe I'd
[37:25] do the the opposite but you can't you
[37:28] can't trick God so I just want to be
[37:29] where he wants me to be and uh uh uh
[37:32] just uh serve the body how I can serve
[37:34] him so um but let's just turn in our
[37:37] Bibles there Luke Chapter 2 and 25 and
[37:40] 26 it
[37:42] says while you turn there uh Luke 2:25
[37:46] and
[37:47] 26 it would read like this and behold
[37:49] there was a man in Jerusalem whose name
[37:51] was Simeon and the same man was a just
[37:54] and devout waiting for the consolation
[37:56] of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon
[37:58] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[38:02] holy ghost that he should not see death
[38:05] before he had seen the Lord's Christ and
[38:07] we can turn all also over to Revelations
[38:10] 3
[38:17] and14 and I'm I'm trying to speak on a
[38:19] little thought uh the
[38:22] amen and uh the subject is revelation is
[38:26] reality uh just pray God would would
[38:28] take the thought and distribute it to
[38:30] your heart as you so need and
[38:33] Revelations 3 and
[38:39] 14 it says in unto uh Revelations 3
[38:43] and14 and unto the Church of Lady oia
[38:46] write these things
[38:48] saith the
[38:50] amen the faithful and true witness the
[38:53] beginning of the creation of God Amen
[38:55] you may be seated I just love that
[38:57] phrase how he says the amen and if you
[38:59] were to to look that up into um into the
[39:03] Greek and even look up the word amen one
[39:05] of the things they would say about the
[39:07] amen it would be something as the
[39:09] scriptures would be being read that the
[39:11] people would respond back and say Amen
[39:14] which would be making you say that you
[39:16] want to that word to become part of you
[39:18] or you are one with that word so if
[39:21] you've ever wondered why we say Amen
[39:24] it's because we we are one with that
[39:26] word we're saying am amen I believe it
[39:28] I'm one with
[39:30] it and so brother Brandon would say this
[39:33] just in um laying a foundation on the
[39:36] amen we're just maybe in in one way
[39:38] trying to uh for the sake of time trying
[39:41] to pull don't have the time to lay the
[39:43] foundation in in the the thought of the
[39:45] amen as we would move into our subject
[39:47] but uh just briefly on that in the ladyo
[39:50] and church age he said my isn't that the
[39:52] most wonderful description of the
[39:54] attributes of our lovely Lord and Savior
[39:57] Jesus Christ so uh the prophets
[39:59] referring to the scriptures that we just
[40:00] read he says these words just make me
[40:02] want to shout they bring such a spirit
[40:06] of
[40:07] reality into my heart and and you know
[40:11] something you talk about a reality it
[40:14] it's many times we perceive reality with
[40:17] what we would call our five senses or
[40:19] touch taste see smell but you know faith
[40:22] that six sense is a greater reality
[40:24] we've been taught of that and so as he
[40:26] says they they bring such a spirit of
[40:29] reality in my heart uh the believer has
[40:32] a greater reality than the reality that
[40:34] is surrounding us through what we can
[40:37] discern with touch taste feel smell hear
[40:39] and all of these things uh though they
[40:41] have such great impact on our being and
[40:43] and such great influence on our lives
[40:46] there's something far superior beyond
[40:48] that inside of the believer which is
[40:50] Faith and he says just reading them
[40:53] without even waiting for a thorough
[40:54] revelation of the spirit upon them
[40:56] Thrills me Jesus is giving us the
[40:59] description of himself in relation to
[41:01] the last age the days of grace are
[41:03] winding up he has looked from the first
[41:05] century right through the 20th and told
[41:08] us all things concerning these ages
[41:11] before he reveals the characteristics of
[41:13] the last age to us he gives us one final
[41:16] look at his own glorious and supreme
[41:20] deity this is the Capstone revelation of
[41:24] himself I love that because it's in this
[41:27] age that we receive the Capstone
[41:29] revelation of his person it says thus
[41:32] saith the
[41:34] amen Jesus is the amen of God oh I love
[41:39] that Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is
[41:44] the soul Let It Be of God Amen stands
[41:48] for finality it stands for approval it
[41:53] stands for prevailing promise it stands
[41:56] for unchanging promise it stands for the
[42:00] Seal of God I say Amen oh Jesus is the
[42:07] amen of God thus saith the amen Jesus
[42:12] Christ he got the last word to say his
[42:16] word is
[42:17] final his word is
[42:20] absolute absolute means it's perfect in
[42:23] itself ultimate in its power that's the
[42:27] all of it that settles it so heavens and
[42:31] earth will pass away but God's word will
[42:33] never pass away he has the final say he
[42:37] is the Amen brother Brandon would say in
[42:41] an absolute he says there's got to be
[42:43] somewhere that somebody's word is final
[42:46] amen I feel real good right now Glory
[42:49] Hallelujah there's got to be something
[42:52] that's final I'm so glad of that oh now
[42:55] there's somebody who can say is sin or
[42:58] it's not sin I'm so glad of that I'm
[43:00] glad for an absolute no arguing no need
[43:04] of
[43:06] arguing husbands and wives no
[43:10] arguing no need of
[43:13] arguing there's nothing to argue
[43:16] about don't don't let Satan disrupt your
[43:19] home and your family life and your
[43:20] marriage and get into an AR there's
[43:22] nothing to argue
[43:23] about hey you might say brother Matthew
[43:26] I have I have a much to differ with you
[43:27] if you were in my home last night there
[43:30] is much to argue about no if if I would
[43:33] say in the middle of your argument one
[43:35] of you can say honey I'm wrong you're
[43:38] right can I pray with
[43:43] you now if if if the spouse doesn't have
[43:46] a bad
[43:47] attitude and just thinks you're start
[43:49] trying to be uh
[43:51] self-righteous I guarantee you that'll
[43:53] change the atmosphere real quick if you
[43:55] got any spirit of God in you say you
[43:57] know what honey I'm
[43:58] sorry let's let's pray there there's no
[44:00] need to
[44:03] argue you know we we always you know I
[44:05] mean I say there is no re you know I
[44:08] never heard my
[44:09] parents I never heard my parents argue
[44:11] my whole
[44:14] life and uh and and that had a big
[44:17] effect on me and so you know me and my
[44:19] wife we've never argued there's nothing
[44:21] argue about because I'm always right no
[44:22] I'm just kidding I'm just kidding that
[44:25] was a joke
[44:27] but you know I say that if you have the
[44:29] spirit of
[44:31] Christ what's there to argue about I'm
[44:33] wrong he's right I ain't got no thought
[44:36] coming you know and why we we're not
[44:38] even going to get started you know uh uh
[44:40] because a lot of times if you start you
[44:42] you start to feel like there's a
[44:44] difference of you you know you realize
[44:46] your family is just a reflection of
[44:49] yourself you know and and I I I I I I
[44:52] say this with all humility you know I
[44:53] was given one of my daughters a good you
[44:55] know uh tongue lashing if you will and I
[44:57] was letting them know you know you you
[44:58] know how it is parents you try to do
[45:00] everything for them and sometimes you
[45:01] just feel like you know they they they
[45:03] got a little too good and and and you
[45:05] realize that's what life is all about is
[45:07] because you want them to have more than
[45:08] you had and then when they have more
[45:10] than you had they can't appreciate what
[45:11] you had because they never didn't have
[45:12] it so it's kind of like you know it's
[45:15] kind of like you want them to like not
[45:16] have anything so they can appreciate
[45:18] what they
[45:20] have but that that's just not how life
[45:22] works and so sometimes you're like you
[45:24] know what you you need to appreciate
[45:26] things you're you're you're you're
[45:27] spoiled you you have all these things
[45:29] and everything's done for you and and
[45:31] you don't appreciate it you know and
[45:32] then and then I I you know as as I'm
[45:34] talking maybe I haven't done a good job
[45:36] myself and help teaching these things
[45:38] you know and then you come away about
[45:39] from that and you start thinking about
[45:40] it you're like I'm I'm the spoiled brat
[45:43] here you know that's me I mean my family
[45:45] is a reflection of myself I'm the I'm
[45:47] the spoiled one right in here Lord
[45:49] you've done everything for me and what
[45:51] am I doing for you you know what am I
[45:53] arguing about what am I fussing about
[45:55] Lord you You' you you gave your life for
[45:57] me you sacrificed and gave all for me
[45:59] I'm the one that's spoiled rotten over
[46:01] here enjoying the blessings of the Lord
[46:03] going here and going there and say Lord
[46:04] forgive me let me get on my knees Lord
[46:06] say Lord I'm sorry I I'm the one that
[46:08] needs your grace I'm the one that needs
[46:09] your help Lord let let me get down to
[46:11] that place that Jesus got to where not
[46:13] my will Lord but thy will be
[46:16] done you know there there's no need for
[46:19] arguing he goes on to say the ire said
[46:21] strike that's what it is Mark it up in
[46:23] your mind it's a strike go on When God
[46:26] says anything thing that's the way it is
[46:28] no need of arguing about it that's what
[46:30] he said he said so that's the
[46:31] Christian's absolute that is if he is a
[46:34] Christian God said so do it this way
[46:36] that's the way it's got to be done no
[46:40] arguing if the church doors are
[46:43] [Music]
[46:47] open you go to the house of God no
[46:52] arguing ain't nothing about it God said
[46:55] so that settles it that's the absolute
[46:58] to the real
[47:02] believer that's our absolute that's our
[47:04] amen of Our Lives the so let it be I
[47:07] just thought on these things you know
[47:08] when you're building a house and and you
[47:11] you might get into a place where uh you
[47:13] have contractors and Builders and
[47:15] framers and everything and they're
[47:16] they're putting in oh this makes me this
[47:18] just makes me smile talking about this
[47:20] now that I think about it but you're
[47:21] putting in the doors and you're putting
[47:22] in the windows and everything well you
[47:24] know you could say well the door needs
[47:26] to be this high or that length or I need
[47:28] to frame it in here or or this way uh uh
[47:31] and and you know the framer or or the
[47:33] carpenter they could argue all they want
[47:35] about it but there should be an absolute
[47:37] should be there should be
[47:40] blueprints that after all the fighting
[47:43] well no I think it should be BL let me
[47:45] go to the absolute and see what the
[47:47] absolute says and then when you come
[47:49] back to the blueprint one of you is
[47:50] going to say okay you were right I was
[47:52] wrong or we both were wrong but one
[47:54] thing we know is right and it is the the
[47:57] blueprints the blueprints are telling
[47:59] you how the job has to be done and
[48:01] there's no arguing about it you can't
[48:03] come back and say Well it said they said
[48:05] these were 70 and and uh you know but
[48:07] that's just what the blueprint says but
[48:10] I'm the one that's right well I'm so
[48:13] glad that this is
[48:15] unchanging the message of the hour is
[48:18] unchanging what he said is what he
[48:21] meant it doesn't need man's
[48:23] interpretation on it what it needs is a
[48:25] revelation
[48:29] we if we if we want to be up to code and
[48:31] pass inspection then we got to follow
[48:33] the blueprint we know that God's word is
[48:35] the blueprint that should be what
[48:37] governs your life no matter what anybody
[48:39] else says what anybody else does so just
[48:41] continuing on in this or this is backing
[48:43] up a few paragraphs in the absolute he
[48:45] says and we know he's alive because here
[48:48] he is with us in the power of his
[48:51] resurrection doing the same things he
[48:53] did when he was here on Earth I'm tied
[48:55] to that ultimate
[48:57] that's the end of all Strife I'm tied to
[48:59] it that's my life I was a sinner when
[49:01] Christ saved me I met something and
[49:03] since that came into me it's been
[49:07] different I'm tied to it everything that
[49:10] I am is tied right
[49:14] there you got to have an anchor you got
[49:17] to have something that you're tied to an
[49:20] experience on the backside of the desert
[49:22] where you've met Jesus Christ him
[49:24] personally what is the new birth of the
[49:26] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[49:28] personally and you're tied to that not
[49:31] to just an experience of a day gone by
[49:34] but it's a living experience that keeps
[49:37] you every day all day
[49:40] 247 it's not just something that oh I
[49:42] had the experience like going on
[49:44] vacation like I was there you know we
[49:47] just made a trip to San Diego I was in
[49:49] San Diego but when I come back I
[49:51] couldn't bring San Diego with me even
[49:53] though it's in my memory but I'm so
[49:56] thankful when meet the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:58] I don't know I don't care where you meet
[50:00] him if you met him in Louisiana if you
[50:01] met him in San Diego Montana Africa I
[50:04] don't care where you met him when you
[50:06] leave he's with you because he said I'll
[50:08] be with you even in you until the end so
[50:11] that experience is a lifegiving fountain
[50:13] that is always present with
[50:16] you not something that Fades and goes
[50:19] but but it's it's welling
[50:22] up like that little Fountain uh uh uh
[50:25] you know what makes you're so happy
[50:27] little Fountain is it because I come by
[50:29] and drink from you is it because the
[50:31] deers come by and they drink out is it
[50:33] because of the sunrise that comes up in
[50:35] the morning that makes you bubble what
[50:37] is it that makes you so happy oh if you
[50:39] only knew sir there's something way down
[50:43] deep on the inside of me it's just a
[50:46] bubbling and bubbling and pushing up and
[50:48] pushing up that's the reality of
[50:50] Revelation in the believer's life and
[50:52] you're tied to
[50:55] that oh it ends all
[50:58] Strife it's your
[51:00] ultimate I'm tied to that that's my life
[51:03] I was a sinner when Christ saved me I
[51:05] met something and since that came into
[51:07] me it's been different I'm tied to it
[51:10] everything that I am tied right there
[51:12] and then God separating his life let me
[51:15] live in him and him and me then we're
[51:17] tied right there and then it don't make
[51:20] any difference what others want to
[51:22] believe to the individual you are tied
[51:26] to that
[51:27] that's your ultimate that's the last
[51:29] word hallelujah remember that where's
[51:32] the greatest battle ever fought it's in
[51:35] your mind pastor's been going through
[51:37] how can I overcome look we're tied to an
[51:40] absolute we're tied to the
[51:42] [Applause]
[51:44] word that's the last word and then if he
[51:48] is the word then this must be the last
[51:53] word this must settle it whatever that
[51:56] says that's the Scarlet thread makes me
[51:59] want to preach on Rahab for a little
[52:02] bit certain judgment certain Doom was
[52:04] coming but she received an absolute she
[52:09] received a promise that said look if you
[52:10] just hang the Scarlet thread from your
[52:13] window it sounded pretty far stretched
[52:16] but when you get in desperation you're
[52:18] willing to try
[52:21] anything when you get desperate you'll
[52:24] you'll try to turn over every Le you'll
[52:25] try to do everything one thing she
[52:27] couldn't deny something in her heart
[52:29] knew that their God was God and there
[52:31] was nothing that could stand and if
[52:33] you're telling me that you'll spare my
[52:35] household if I hang this Scarlet thread
[52:37] out the window then I'm going to pack
[52:39] this thing
[52:40] out I'm going to get everybody in this
[52:43] thing that I can I tell you it's time
[52:45] Church get everybody in that you can if
[52:47] you got loved on you got neighbors you
[52:49] got people you love get them under this
[52:51] Scarlet thread tell them God tell them
[52:53] about the
[52:55] message it's God's provided
[53:00] way that is Christ and anything contrary
[53:03] to that I know nothing about it that's
[53:06] what we want to know is what this word
[53:08] says for I'm tied to Christ and Christ
[53:12] is the word you get it
[53:15] now and the portion of his word that's
[53:18] lotted for this day his holy spirit is
[53:22] here to manifest that portion of
[53:27] word now just focus on that for one
[53:29] minute his holy spirit is here to
[53:31] manifest that portion of the word the
[53:34] word lotted for this day and I just want
[53:36] to say many times we might think of that
[53:39] in such a maybe a generic way and if
[53:41] we're not careful we think of when he
[53:43] says the word lotted for this day well
[53:45] we know that we have received the
[53:46] fullness of the word so it's not just a
[53:48] portion of the word we have received but
[53:50] we have received the fullness of the
[53:52] word but what I want to say is because
[53:55] we have received the fullness of the
[53:56] word then everything that you have need
[53:58] of is available to you so make it
[54:01] personal wherever you are at in your
[54:03] life if you can find out what the
[54:06] portion of the word that God is lighting
[54:08] for you this evening in your trial in
[54:11] your situation God has ordained a word
[54:14] specifically for you that will minister
[54:16] to your need that will answer your
[54:18] questions that will bring you
[54:20] Deliverance that will bring you
[54:21] salvation that will comfort you that
[54:23] will encourage you that will keep you
[54:25] that will carry you that'll make you
[54:27] figure out your job situations and your
[54:29] family situations and maybe things look
[54:31] so dark you don't want to understand it
[54:33] but I want to tell you according to the
[54:35] word of the Lord the holy spirit is here
[54:37] to manifest that portion of the word
[54:40] that is lotted to you for this day that
[54:42] you are now
[54:45] living but I want to say you have to
[54:47] recognize
[54:49] it you want to identify with it you want
[54:51] to lay claim to it you want to speak it
[54:53] you want to believe it yes
[54:57] the prophet of God would preach messages
[54:59] like hearing recognizing acting on the
[55:01] word of God and recognizing your day and
[55:03] its
[55:05] message that should produce such a
[55:08] spirit of
[55:09] reality an expectation that puts you
[55:13] into
[55:16] action and he said the prophet said in
[55:19] one message he says look what we've seen
[55:20] in this day it should put you into
[55:24] action look you're you're living for
[55:26] Rapture that's right you're living for
[55:29] body change you're living to see your
[55:31] loved one saved you're living to see God
[55:34] heal your
[55:36] neighbor that's what eternal life is
[55:38] it's living for others that's what we're
[55:40] living for and there ought to be such a
[55:42] spirit of
[55:45] reality I don't want to go so carnal but
[55:48] when I was out in the world there were
[55:49] certain things uh that I uh used as a
[55:53] substitute a and some of them were more
[55:55] powerful than other
[55:58] things and and and you know those are
[56:00] the things you wanted to
[56:04] share kind of like a good
[56:06] meal best place you've ever eaten you
[56:08] kind of want to share
[56:10] it we got something to
[56:12] share we got the greatest thing the
[56:15] planet has ever
[56:16] seen I mean it it is it is the remedy
[56:19] for every problem it is the remedy for
[56:22] for every uh uh Injustice it is the
[56:24] remedy for every complex it's the remedy
[56:27] for every fear every family situation
[56:30] every job problem every Financial need
[56:32] every crisis every indifference I don't
[56:35] care what it is whatever you have need
[56:36] of there's a portion of word in the hour
[56:39] that we're living that if the Holy
[56:41] Spirit can just bring the reality into
[56:44] your life oh it changes everything
[56:47] because by that Revelation it presents a
[56:50] new
[56:52] reality oh Hallelujah
[56:56] yeah that's why people look at you like
[56:58] you're crazy because you are not
[56:59] depending on the ways of man you're not
[57:02] depending on the economy you're not even
[57:04] depending on your
[57:06] job I remember one time I worked for a
[57:09] corporation downtown and the office was
[57:12] up in this big uh highrise and and I
[57:15] told these people look I don't work on
[57:18] Sundays and so uh they honored that they
[57:22] were they were they were they were great
[57:24] they honored never made me and and I
[57:26] said uh sometimes the hours that we're
[57:28] parking cars for these really fancy
[57:30] restaurants out there and sometimes you
[57:32] know it would go to midnight and I was
[57:34] so fanatical I said look H you know I
[57:37] was
[57:37] young still fanatical though I said I
[57:40] don't work at 12:01 a.m. because it's
[57:43] Sunday I don't work on
[57:46] Sunday it's just I'm a
[57:50] Nut so they said fine and so every day
[57:53] right right at 11:59 if it was on
[57:56] Saturdays or something like that and I
[57:57] was I was working late I was gone well I
[57:59] worked there six seven months or
[58:01] something like that I can't remember how
[58:02] long and and uh it came and my my
[58:04] manager came to me and said hey I just
[58:06] want to let you know uh you're scheduled
[58:08] to work this Sunday I'm like well there

[58:12] don't work Sundays he said well we've
[58:14] been good to you have we not yes we've
[58:16] given you up to the 11:59 we've let you
[58:19] off every single time I said you have he
[58:21] said well so alls we're asking of you

[58:27] one one day out of the whole year we
[58:31] need your help said well I apologize I'm
[58:35] not able to help you he's like okay well
[58:37] I'm going to need you to speak to the
[58:38] owner of the company I said no
[58:40] problem so uh Brian brings me all the
[58:44] way up this big high highrise uh maybe
[58:47] not you know I don't know 15 20 stories
[58:49] or so in Turtle Creek over there in
[58:51] Dallas really nice area big office
[58:53] coming uh the the the windows looking
[58:55] out oh my just this you could have lived
[58:57] in this office this thing was gorgeous
[58:59] you know they bring me in there sit me
[59:00] down and and RPS like okay what uh and
[59:03] Brian standing over there sit down he's
[59:05] in his big chair you know and I tell you
[59:07] what what's the beautiful thing about
[59:08] the word of God is is when you're tied
[59:11] to something nothing can move
[59:14] you I I I'm sorry I'm
[59:17] unmovable and I want to say not not
[59:19] because something I've done no sir but
[59:22] I'm living in a different reality see I
[59:25] I'm not living in your
[59:27] reality so he he said well h h h uh
[59:31] Brian let me know that um we all of
[59:33] these things we've been really good to
[59:35] you but I just want to let you know you
[59:36] know as the owner of the company we
[59:38] we've done uh uh really uh worked hard
[59:40] to provide for you and everything but
[59:41] all I need is I just need you to work uh
[59:44] uh this one one Sunday or I'm going to
[59:46] have to fire
[59:48] you I said okay RP I said well I
[59:52] understand I can quit if that would make
[59:54] it easier for you or if you need to fire
[59:55] me that's fine but I don't work on
[59:58] Sundays and it was in that moment that
[1:00:02] that owner realized that I was
[1:00:04] unmovable and so he realized right quick
[1:00:07] that he was going to lose a good
[1:00:09] employee or he had to backtrack on his
[1:00:13] word and so you know what he did he
[1:00:16] backtracked on his word he did something
[1:00:19] that God could never
[1:00:22] do God can never Backtrack on his word
[1:00:26] so that if you take him at it I promise
[1:00:28] you he'll take care of you if you stand
[1:00:31] for truth if you stand for righteousness
[1:00:33] if you say I am anchored I am tied to an
[1:00:36] absolute I'm standing on the unfailing
[1:00:39] Word of Promise and I will not move I
[1:00:42] cannot be moved and nothing's going to
[1:00:44] take me off the sure Word of Promise
[1:00:47] right God will back up his
[1:00:51] word you got to recognize it it gots to
[1:00:54] be a reality to
[1:00:56] you not just the mechanics of the
[1:01:00] word the word is the mechanics but there
[1:01:04] has to be the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:07] to come upon the believer's life and
[1:01:11] make that word live I I uh I tell you
[1:01:15] sometimes when you when the word just
[1:01:16] starts to unfold and it all starts tying
[1:01:20] together you realize that you can't come
[1:01:22] out here and preach wisdom versus faith
[1:01:25] and absolute and and and and but but it
[1:01:28] just all starts dovetailing together and
[1:01:30] it's it becomes this one big picture and
[1:01:32] then and then you you then you're lost
[1:01:34] and you're like I don't even know what
[1:01:35] I'm going to do
[1:01:36] now as Billy makes that look like I know
[1:01:39] exactly what you're talking
[1:01:41] about but you get into all of these
[1:01:43] things and and if if if you're you know
[1:01:47] you could get into a wisdom where it's
[1:01:50] intellectual but it has to be a true
[1:01:52] faith it has to be the Holy Spirit
[1:01:55] bringing a reality or a revelation and
[1:01:58] that was what our subject uh was is that
[1:02:00] Revelation is reality where it's so
[1:02:03] evident and so clear to you that all of
[1:02:07] the obstacles they they are just be they
[1:02:09] are just predestinated victories for
[1:02:11] your
[1:02:12] life if I can say that again when you
[1:02:15] got a revelation when faith has anchored
[1:02:18] in your heart and in your soul every
[1:02:21] obstacle and every hindrance is just a
[1:02:25] pre destinated
[1:02:29] Victory now now some of us are
[1:02:31] struggling you're struggling in the
[1:02:33] sanctification in your life there's
[1:02:35] things that you're struggling in in your
[1:02:36] marriage you're struggling in with
[1:02:38] school some of you nobody knows about it
[1:02:40] but you're you're living the perfect
[1:02:42] Christian life before everybody else but
[1:02:45] they live they nobody knows about your
[1:02:47] secret life in your little secret world
[1:02:50] out there with your secret friends and
[1:02:52] your secret websites and all of those
[1:02:54] things but I want to tell you your
[1:02:55] secret is not HIIT from
[1:02:59] God and you know you're struggling and
[1:03:01] you know you're having a hard time and
[1:03:03] you know you're not getting the victory
[1:03:05] but I want to tell you don't feel like
[1:03:07] you have to bow to that Spirit any
[1:03:10] longer you are an overcomer you are who
[1:03:14] God said you are you are a believer in
[1:03:17] all of those obstacles all of those
[1:03:19] Devils all of those hindrances are just
[1:03:22] predestinated victories that you are
[1:03:24] called to overcome and all's God needs
[1:03:27] you to do is come to the revelation of
[1:03:28] who you are remember in overcome you got
[1:03:31] to recognize the devil and him real some
[1:03:33] of you just need to realize hey that's
[1:03:34] the
[1:03:36] devil I realize I'm wasting my time and
[1:03:39] that thing is the
[1:03:40] devil it's robbing me of my time it's
[1:03:43] robbing me of my my prayer life it's
[1:03:45] robbing me of my joy and it's about time
[1:03:47] you recognize the devil and him real and
[1:03:51] then what's the next thing you
[1:03:54] do you recogniz that greater is he that
[1:03:57] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:04:01] now you are stepping into the Realms of
[1:04:04] overcoming and the reality that
[1:04:06] revelation will produce in your
[1:04:09] life I we could just go on in those
[1:04:12] subjects of how Paul would go through
[1:04:14] the scriptures and start to say what
[1:04:16] shall we say to these things if God
[1:04:18] before us who could be against
[1:04:21] us David would say though though a host
[1:04:24] shall encamp against me
[1:04:27] Hallelujah though War should rise in
[1:04:29] this shall I be confident one thing I've
[1:04:31] have desired all the days of my life
[1:04:32] that I shall dwell in the house of the
[1:04:34] Lord all of his enemies would stumble
[1:04:37] and fall what shall separate us from the
[1:04:40] love of God shall famine Str what is it
[1:04:45] nothing so anything that's trying to
[1:04:48] keep you or to hinder your walk with God
[1:04:51] is just a predestinated victory
[1:04:55] Goliath was just a predestinated victory
[1:04:58] for
[1:05:01] David that dumb devil just didn't know
[1:05:03] it he showed up on the wrong Battlefield
[1:05:06] that day it looked like he was a great
[1:05:08] big obst guy he was just a great big
[1:05:12] testimony that's what I love about the
[1:05:14] woman at the well what looked like a
[1:05:15] great big uh uh miserable life with all
[1:05:19] kind of failures and and she was a
[1:05:21] reproach to the whole
[1:05:23] town oh my goodness
[1:05:27] Hallelujah when the son of
[1:05:30] man brought the Revelation to that
[1:05:32] predestinated seat she entered into a
[1:05:35] different reality she was living in in a
[1:05:39] reality of condemnation she was living
[1:05:41] in a reality of fear and dread and
[1:05:44] remorse and discouragement and Outcast
[1:05:48] but once she met the master once she met
[1:05:51] the I am once she met the amen the so
[1:05:54] let it be it changed her reality so much
[1:05:57] so that her past became her
[1:06:02] Victory so much so she ran back into the
[1:06:06] town and said come see a
[1:06:08] man the town would have thought well why
[1:06:12] would you want to brag about that oh you
[1:06:14] don't understand I'm living in a
[1:06:17] different reality there's something in
[1:06:20] my soul that has been quickened and I
[1:06:23] have been changed
[1:06:28] faith is our Victory faith is a
[1:06:33] revelation real Faith knows no defeat it
[1:06:35] cannot be defeated even death itself
[1:06:38] can't be defeated it knows no defeat
[1:06:41] trials knows defeat but Faith knows no
[1:06:44] defeat it cannot be defeated and it's
[1:06:47] the only way that you can please God for
[1:06:50] without
[1:06:51] faith it's impossible to please him amen
[1:06:55] Hebrews 10:23 says let us hold fast the
[1:06:59] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:07:02] for he is faithful that promised now I
[1:07:06] like this I want to focus on this for a
[1:07:08] moment he says let us hold fast the
[1:07:10] profession of our faith without waving
[1:07:12] for he is faithful that promised who
[1:07:17] made the
[1:07:19] promise the
[1:07:21] amen Jesus Christ the creator of heavens
[1:07:25] and Earth he made the promise who's
[1:07:27] given you the promised word who's given
[1:07:29] you this message who said I will not
[1:07:31] leave you I won't forsake you who's
[1:07:33] promising you Rapture who's promising
[1:07:35] you body change it's the I am it's the
[1:07:38] great Creator it's the soul Let It Be
[1:07:40] it's the amen of God he's made you this
[1:07:43] promise so then let us hold fast the
[1:07:45] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:07:47] for the one who made the promise he's
[1:07:51] faithful to perform
[1:07:53] that remember in our text we read amen
[1:07:56] stands for
[1:07:57] finality it stands for approval it
[1:07:59] stands for prevailing promise it stands
[1:08:01] for unchanging
[1:08:04] promise it stands for the Seal of God
[1:08:08] now I could promise you a million
[1:08:12] dollars but I want to tell you up front
[1:08:14] don't get
[1:08:16] excited because I don't have it to give
[1:08:18] to
[1:08:20] you are we
[1:08:24] clear all right kid I'm going to no I
[1:08:27] bet I got to be a man of my word so I'm
[1:08:28] not going to promise you a million
[1:08:29] dollars
[1:08:30] cuz but if I did I don't even have it to
[1:08:34] give to
[1:08:35] you now if Elon Musk or some billionaire
[1:08:38] said hey I'm going to give you a million
[1:08:41] dollars I would say
[1:08:43] somewhat you could be
[1:08:45] hopeful I mean right I mean he said it I
[1:08:49] mean he got because he got he gots it to
[1:08:53] give right I mean if somebody how many
[1:08:55] times you said had somebody tell you
[1:08:56] they'd give you something and they don't
[1:08:57] even have it to
[1:09:00] give right it's like oh sure okay I'll
[1:09:03] catch you next time I'll give you
[1:09:05] another
[1:09:07] IOU right it can
[1:09:10] happen but if you're talking to somebody
[1:09:12] who has the
[1:09:15] goods that's why you go to a store
[1:09:18] because they got the goods they have
[1:09:20] something to give to you now Elon mus
[1:09:24] one of these guys they could promise
[1:09:25] something but you know what they could
[1:09:26] be
[1:09:28] lying but my Bible tells me that God is
[1:09:31] not a
[1:09:33] man that he should lie so then if he
[1:09:36] made a
[1:09:38] promise I say there ought to be
[1:09:40] something in the believer's heart that
[1:09:42] ought to start getting excited and start
[1:09:44] expecting something to take place look
[1:09:47] when I tell my kids I'm going to take
[1:09:49] them out for ice cream you know what
[1:09:51] they get excited and if I forget to take
[1:09:54] them you know what they
[1:09:56] do they remind me dad you said you said
[1:10:02] well I want to tell you I'm a man on I I
[1:10:05] can lie I can make a mistake but God is
[1:10:08] not a man God cannot lie and if he gave
[1:10:11] you a promise he is Duty Bound by that
[1:10:14] oath to perform that which he promised
[1:10:17] then I say as a child of God if we can
[1:10:19] get excited about ice cream I say the
[1:10:22] children of God should get excited about
[1:10:24] healing should get excited about Rapture
[1:10:27] should get excited about body change
[1:10:29] should get excited about saving our
[1:10:31] families and the lost we should get
[1:10:33] excited about our bills getting paid
[1:10:35] have your bills ever gotten paid when
[1:10:37] there was no way to pay it why because
[1:10:39] your father is not a liar he owns a
[1:10:42] cattle on a thousand hills he'll meet
[1:10:45] your need every time and the word of God
[1:10:48] will defeat Satan anywhere any place on
[1:10:51] any grounds every time that is the
[1:10:53] reality of Revelation in the word of
[1:11:00] God who made the
[1:11:06] promise well all of these things are
[1:11:08] laying in the
[1:11:09] word all of the words of
[1:11:12] predestination you being the bride
[1:11:15] without spot and without R wrinkle I I
[1:11:17] want to just say this if God says he's
[1:11:21] going to take you
[1:11:22] somewhere or if there is a word that is
[1:11:25] lotted for this age and you see I am in
[1:11:29] this condition over here but I see in
[1:11:33] God's word that he's calling me to a
[1:11:36] higher realm or he's calling me to walk
[1:11:39] from this Dimension or from this
[1:11:42] position or from this condition I see
[1:11:45] something in the word faith something's
[1:11:47] drawing me I want to live in that then
[1:11:50] God has to provide you the vehicle to
[1:11:53] get there
[1:11:56] and and he didn't leave us a car with no
[1:11:59] gas in it he didn't leave us a Cadillac
[1:12:02] with flat
[1:12:04] tires this car gots not only the
[1:12:07] mechanics it gots the Dynamics it gots
[1:12:11] the spark in it all you got to do is
[1:12:14] just put the key of faith in there and
[1:12:16] get to Raven on that thing it'll take
[1:12:18] you from point A to point
[1:12:20] B cuz my God don't lie thank you Lord
[1:12:25] amen so this is
[1:12:28] where it always happens you think you're
[1:12:30] going to be short
[1:12:32] and so look at Hebrews 11:11
[1:12:36] here this is
[1:12:39] just thinking about that thought right
[1:12:42] go God's going to be the way he he that
[1:12:43] made the promise is faithful so so the
[1:12:46] promise is only as good as the promise
[1:12:50] Giver oh
[1:12:53] my and that's what Abraham saying look
[1:12:55] the one that made the promise is able to
[1:12:58] perform it and the one that made the
[1:13:00] promise cannot lie then therefore it
[1:13:04] produced an expectation in
[1:13:07] Abraham and that was his
[1:13:11] reality contrary to every other feeling
[1:13:15] or emotion there was a reality of
[1:13:18] Revelation that he was living in that
[1:13:20] was so contrary to the doctors to the
[1:13:23] neighbors to the people it in the the
[1:13:25] grocery markets and everything everybody
[1:13:28] thought the guy was
[1:13:32] crazy and you know I think it's good
[1:13:34] that people think you're crazy every
[1:13:36] once in a
[1:13:37] while because then it means that you're
[1:13:40] showing what you
[1:13:42] believe because we are an odd Bunch so
[1:13:46] much so the prophet had to preach a
[1:13:47] message called the
[1:13:50] Oddball makes me feel a little
[1:13:52] better I understand why I've been this
[1:13:55] way my whole life I never fit into the
[1:13:56] world I never fit into all those things
[1:13:59] but because I'm an oddball so looking at
[1:14:02] this here in Hebrews 111 everybody there
[1:14:04] we'll try to somehow wind up
[1:14:08] quickly Hebrews 11:1 says through faith
[1:14:11] also Sarah received strength to conceive
[1:14:14] seed and was delivered of child when she
[1:14:18] was past aged because she judged him
[1:14:20] faithful who had promised this is
[1:14:22] exactly what we just read in in Hebrews
[1:14:25] 23 let us hold fast the profession of
[1:14:27] our faith without wavering for he is
[1:14:29] faithful that promised right here it
[1:14:32] says through faith Sarah re herself
[1:14:34] received strength to conceive and was
[1:14:36] delivered of a child when she was past
[1:14:39] age because she judged him faithful who
[1:14:43] had promised she
[1:14:44] recognized the one who made the promise
[1:14:49] before before she recognized who it was
[1:14:52] she laughed
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:57] when MDC was standing in the tent door
[1:15:00] she laughed because she lacked the
[1:15:02] revelation of who it was
[1:15:08] veiled come
[1:15:10] on if Sarah knew who that
[1:15:13] was she'd have been acting more like
[1:15:18] Abraham what happened out there in them
[1:15:20] PLS of
[1:15:22] mamory in that little tient door
[1:15:27] some old crazy guy washing the dirty
[1:15:31] feet of a Dusty
[1:15:35] traveler all the church world would look
[1:15:38] at that and
[1:15:40] laugh what what is this going on Abraham
[1:15:43] what are you getting so excited about
[1:15:45] reminds me of the story brother Ram
[1:15:47] tells about the two farmers one of them
[1:15:50] had a had a an old rickety Barn that was
[1:15:53] all falling down he had a little C out
[1:15:55] there and there was just alala hey
[1:15:57] growing everywhere the place looked like
[1:15:59] a shanty and next door that farmer he
[1:16:02] was in his big uh Cattle barn and he he
[1:16:06] was in these big fancy tractors and
[1:16:08] everything and that cow that fancy uh
[1:16:11] bar and he he got to walking out on that
[1:16:14] concrete one day and and kind of looked
[1:16:16] out through the crack of the fence and
[1:16:18] he saw some calf over there just running
[1:16:20] around and kicking up his hill Hills and
[1:16:22] enjoying himself and all the AL alha hey
[1:16:24] and the prophet of God said he just
[1:16:26] looked at the little calf with my can
[1:16:28] you believe the
[1:16:29] fanaticism because he was putting all
[1:16:32] his stock into all his buildings and all
[1:16:34] the fine things around him but that
[1:16:36] little calf he might not have had a big
[1:16:38] church he might not have had a big uh a
[1:16:41] big fancy car he might not have had
[1:16:43] something but one thing he had was
[1:16:45] plenty of food he had plenty of vitamins
[1:16:47] and he was just feeding and feeding
[1:16:49] kicking up his Hills and he was basking
[1:16:51] in the sunlight and feeding on the fresh
[1:16:53] man ho I tell you Church we're feeding
[1:16:56] on Fresh Mana
[1:16:58] tonight we're not depending on the four
[1:17:00] walls and some religious organization to
[1:17:03] get us through no we're basking in the
[1:17:05] sunlight of God's
[1:17:08] word what was Abraham all excited out
[1:17:11] there
[1:17:13] for because the amen of God showed
[1:17:17] up MDC showed
[1:17:20] up and I just I just want to uh focus on
[1:17:24] this
[1:17:27] if you think about what it was there it
[1:17:29] was all seven Redemptive names wrapped
[1:17:31] up and veiled in a Rob of
[1:17:34] Flesh I tell you if Abraham had a
[1:17:37] need for the day and hour that he was
[1:17:41] living in the the ones whose feet he was
[1:17:44] washing had the
[1:17:47] goods that's why he called him Lord
[1:17:50] called him
[1:17:51] Elohim Jehovah God
[1:17:55] and I want to say this this just runs a
[1:17:58] little bit I I was able to catch some of
[1:17:59] the services the brothers preached and I
[1:18:01] just encouraging him I and my soul so
[1:18:03] just pull these things together uh uh
[1:18:05] because this is this is just my just
[1:18:08] think of this how did Sarah receive
[1:18:14] strength because she judged the
[1:18:18] oneall she realized something that she
[1:18:20] didn't have a full revelation of before
[1:18:23] give me the Liberty to say that because
[1:18:24] she wouldn't have laughed but something
[1:18:26] transpired where something in her heart
[1:18:28] realized the one who stood there in that
[1:18:31] tent door and said according to the time
[1:18:34] of life something in her heart finally
[1:18:36] struck that was
[1:18:39] Elohim that was Jehovah
[1:18:42] God and I want to say this how did Sarah
[1:18:46] receive
[1:18:49] strength because the one who made the
[1:18:52] promise was the strength strength
[1:19:01] Giver I will give you
[1:19:03] strength I will give you faith I will
[1:19:08] make you an
[1:19:10] overcomer then if he said you you start
[1:19:13] reading rapturing faith and you start
[1:19:15] reading certain things and you let the
[1:19:17] wisdom of your mind totally defeat you
[1:19:20] but when he says it's going to take a
[1:19:22] greater Faith than we all we've ever had
[1:19:25] you should get excited because that
[1:19:27] means he's going to give you a greater
[1:19:29] Faith it's not a challenge if you can
[1:19:32] muster up rapturing Faith it's a promise
[1:19:35] I'm giving you rapturing faith I'm
[1:19:38] giving you body change I'm giving you
[1:19:40] your family I'm giving you your health
[1:19:43] I'm giving you your husband I'm giving
[1:19:45] you strength why because I'm El Shari
[1:19:48] I'm Jehovah
[1:19:50] God it's not a challenge if you can
[1:19:52] muster up something he said I'm here to
[1:19:56] give it to
[1:19:59] you look at
[1:20:02] Mary we can identify with
[1:20:06] Mary when the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:20:09] unto
[1:20:13] her Mary Thou Art highly
[1:20:17] favored and I love this if you turn over
[1:20:20] to your Bible in think uh Luke
[1:20:25] Luke
[1:20:39] 1 it
[1:20:44] says it says in the angel in uh Luke
[1:20:47] 1:28 it says and the angel came in unto
[1:20:50] her and said hell Thou Art highly
[1:20:53] favored
[1:20:55] the Lord is with
[1:20:57] thee that makes me want to run circles
[1:21:00] in the church right
[1:21:01] there Mary the Lord what what did I do
[1:21:07] what is It Something I Said is it
[1:21:09] something I
[1:21:10] did well it's because of who I've made
[1:21:12] you you see you were in my mind before I
[1:21:15] ever formed the world that I was going
[1:21:17] to come to you on this road in this hour
[1:21:21] in this season and I would be the one
[1:21:23] that was with you I I've been the one
[1:21:25] that's been leading you I've been the
[1:21:26] one that's been keeping you the Lord is
[1:21:29] with
[1:21:31] you it goes on and she was troubled at
[1:21:33] the same and and the angel said un her
[1:21:36] fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor
[1:21:38] with God and behold Thou shalt conceive
[1:21:40] in thy womb and bring forth the son and
[1:21:42] shalt call his name Jesus oh my oh these
[1:21:47] words can you even fathom it well you
[1:21:50] are no different than Mary
[1:21:55] he shall be great and shall be called
[1:21:57] the son of the highest and the Lord God
[1:21:59] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[1:22:01] father David and he shall reign over the
[1:22:02] house of Jacob forever and of the
[1:22:04] kingdoms there shall be no end and I
[1:22:07] love this question
[1:22:09] here because this is a great saying
[1:22:12] she's not doubting she's just like this
[1:22:15] is a tall
[1:22:18] order come on what about you you God's
[1:22:21] called you to do something that's never
[1:22:23] been done we can see it in types of in
[1:22:24] the
[1:22:26] scripture but God has promised you body
[1:22:28] change God has promised you to be an
[1:22:30] overcomer God has promised you for you
[1:22:32] to put death under your
[1:22:34] feet God has called you to live in the
[1:22:36] most wicked age the world has ever seen
[1:22:38] and overcome come out pure
[1:22:42] spotless come on that's a tall
[1:22:45] order you mean I'm me you look you got
[1:22:48] the wrong guy cuz if you knew what I
[1:22:50] already did it's too late for
[1:22:52] that no WR
[1:22:55] reality see the angel of Lord is
[1:22:58] bringing a different reality to Mary
[1:23:01] Mary said how can this
[1:23:03] be seeing that I know not a man and the
[1:23:06] angel answered and said unto her the
[1:23:09] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:23:13] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:23:16] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[1:23:19] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:23:21] called The Son of God oh Church the holy
[1:23:24] Holy Ghost you have found favor with God
[1:23:28] why because the Lord is with you he's
[1:23:31] been keeping you watching out over your
[1:23:33] life how can these things be the Holy
[1:23:36] Ghost has been overshadowing you your
[1:23:38] whole
[1:23:40] life me have perfect Faith how can this
[1:23:43] be the strength Giver the one who gave
[1:23:46] the promise is the one who's with
[1:23:50] you he says for with God nothing shall
[1:23:53] be impossible
[1:23:56] you did not receive the promise of a
[1:24:01] man you have received the
[1:24:04] promise of the
[1:24:07] amen just like
[1:24:12] Abraham just like Abraham received the
[1:24:16] promise what did it do it put him in
[1:24:18] expectation I I'm just going to call for
[1:24:20] the musicians there's no way to finish
[1:24:27] the prophet of God says first month pass
[1:24:29] no different second month first year
[1:24:30] second year how you feeling dollar no
[1:24:32] different glory to God it's going to be
[1:24:34] a bigger Miracle than it was two years
[1:24:37] ago there's the expectation somebody
[1:24:40] somewhere has been believing for
[1:24:42] something and if you can step into
[1:24:45] another reality and say I've been
[1:24:48] praying for one year two year three year
[1:24:52] four years something ought a wh up in
[1:24:53] your heart say it's going to be a bigger
[1:24:55] Miracle now than it was ever going to be
[1:24:58] because he who made the promise is
[1:25:01] faithful he's El ey he's the pry God
[1:25:05] he's the strength
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:10] Giver
[1:25:12] hallelujah how do you know God said so
[1:25:15] that settles it if God said
[1:25:19] so that's there's no more to be said
[1:25:22] about it he said so and after a 100
[1:25:25] years old he still believed God that God
[1:25:28] would do it the Bible said in Hebrews 4
[1:25:31] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:25:33] God through unbelief but was strong
[1:25:36] giving praise unto God can we play the
[1:25:40] Revelation song I think we sing that
[1:25:44] g we are Abraham's
[1:25:48] seed now this might sound like a shock
[1:25:51] but I want to bring you into another
[1:25:53] reality if If Abraham didn't
[1:25:56] stagger then you are not going to
[1:26:01] stagger you say brother Matthew I
[1:26:04] already
[1:26:06] have I've fallen flat on my face yeah we
[1:26:11] all
[1:26:12] have but there's a bumper of
[1:26:15] blood Hallelujah there's a bumper of
[1:26:18] blood that's covering over you that when
[1:26:21] you fall flat on your face you say Lord
[1:26:25] forgive
[1:26:26] me I'm sorry and right then you we ain't
[1:26:31] catholic's Church you ain't got to do
[1:26:34] penants you ain't got to grobble you
[1:26:36] ain't got to crawl up to this altar if
[1:26:38] something in your heart says I believe
[1:26:42] that settles it hallelujah amen
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:49] amen thank you
[1:26:52] Lord get back up
[1:26:55] up keep believing yes sir you are a
[1:26:59] Believer that's right somebody here
[1:27:02] needs to hear this you are
[1:27:06] strong you are
[1:27:09] strong then be like Abraham giving
[1:27:11] praise unto God you say brother Matthew
[1:27:14] I don't feel strong that's okay in your
[1:27:18] weakness it's not your boast it's not
[1:27:22] see what I can do it's judging him
[1:27:24] faithful oh I might have laughed in my
[1:27:27] heart because I didn't recognize who the
[1:27:29] son of man was I didn't surrender my
[1:27:33] life to this message cuz I really didn't
[1:27:35] know who Malachi 45 was but now I'm
[1:27:40] walking into a greater reality I'm
[1:27:43] catching the revelation of the son of
[1:27:45] man that that wasn't just a man come on
[1:27:48] hallelujah oh I got to get to my burden
[1:27:56] hallelujah oh there's just so
