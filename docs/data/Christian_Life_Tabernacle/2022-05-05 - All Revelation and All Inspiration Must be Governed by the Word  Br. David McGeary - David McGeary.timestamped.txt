[35:52] and that you order the footsteps of the
[35:55] righteous father you
[35:57] nothing can pluck us out of your hand
[36:00] and
[36:01] you have something that you have for us
[36:05] and if we could just
[36:07] find that is our heart's desire we ask
[36:10] you to bless us tonight as we
[36:12] fellowship around your word in jesus
[36:15] name we pray amen amen god bless you
[36:19] just grab your bibles and just open it
[36:21] real quick
[36:22] to the gospel
[36:24] of
[36:25] saint john
[36:26] and we just read
[36:31] the first
[36:33] couple verses of the gospel of saint
[36:35] john
[36:36] it says
[36:37] in the
[36:38] beginning was the word
[36:41] and the word was with god
[36:43] and the word was god
[36:46] and the same was in the beginning
[36:49] with
[36:50] god heavenly father we ask you to bless
[36:53] your word in jesus name we pray amen god
[36:56] bless you may be seated
[37:03] you know i want to take
[37:05] tonight
[37:06] as an opportunity
[37:09] i guess to say to
[37:12] reestablish and make sure
[37:15] that
[37:16] we
[37:17] understand
[37:19] a principle
[37:21] of god
[37:22] before we go forward
[37:25] i remember one time that a
[37:29] a
[37:31] a friend of mine he was
[37:33] going
[37:34] on a hunting expedition
[37:37] and uh
[37:38] the
[37:39] in the brochure and the information the
[37:42] guide
[37:43] had sent him
[37:45] he said uh the mountains are steep
[37:49] well
[37:52] he never really sought that out
[37:55] to really have a real understanding of
[37:58] what steep
[37:59] is
[38:01] and where he was going the mountains are
[38:04] steep
[38:05] like steep
[38:08] you know not like steep
[38:10] or
[38:11] steep but like this kind of steep
[38:14] and when he got back he said you know i
[38:17] should have done more research
[38:19] on what steep is
[38:22] and so i i so
[38:25] i just thought in my heart i thought
[38:27] sometimes it does this good
[38:29] to do a little bit of understanding
[38:33] and research about going forward
[38:36] and we know that the spirit's been
[38:39] moving
[38:41] and that people are being getting
[38:43] inspired
[38:45] and people are getting revelation
[38:48] but i want to bring us into remembrance
[38:50] tonight
[38:51] of something so that we hold it dear
[38:54] and then we have this principle as we go
[38:58] forward
[38:59] because we've been talking about god
[39:01] speaking to us by burdens
[39:03] we've been talking about god opening our
[39:06] hearts
[39:07] up to to
[39:10] have us have a desire
[39:12] to do something for god
[39:15] and and so uh with all that laying in
[39:18] front of us
[39:19] i think it's real important that we
[39:22] understand how we proceed or how we go
[39:25] forward
[39:27] uh you know someone talked me the day he
[39:30] says well we're doing all this but
[39:32] what's the order of it
[39:35] in other words how does it have to
[39:36] process what has to be done first what
[39:39] has to be done
[39:41] second you know
[39:42] and there's the order and there's a
[39:44] process to everything that's done
[39:47] and we have to remember that god has an
[39:50] order and god has a process of how
[39:53] everything
[39:55] that needs to be done
[39:57] and satan
[39:58] never changed what god wanted to do
[40:02] in essence but what he did he changed
[40:04] the process or he perverted it or he
[40:08] changed it and therefore because of the
[40:10] change it never reaches the exact
[40:14] completion it's like doing a recipe and
[40:18] leaving out one small ingredients
[40:21] you know what i mean it might taste okay
[40:23] you might get by with serving it but in
[40:26] all reality it's not really what it was
[40:29] supposed to be
[40:30] and and we don't want to come up short
[40:33] so i just want to review this with you
[40:35] we'll go into it more
[40:38] i chose to speak this sunday because i'm
[40:41] not going to be here this
[40:43] this coming sunday i'm going to be with
[40:45] my mother
[40:46] and
[40:47] celebrate a mother's day with her
[40:50] and i hope i have another opportunity
[40:53] but i've got to look at each opportunity
[40:56] like it's my last
[40:58] but so we're doing that
[41:00] and
[41:01] and then
[41:02] i'll be um i'll be back and preach the
[41:05] next wednesday and the following sunday
[41:09] uh brother ron peterson
[41:11] is going to be here with us uh that is
[41:14] the 15th
[41:16] so uh
[41:17] brother ron will be here ministering for
[41:19] us so if you can make special
[41:22] arrangements i know a lot of us aren't
[41:24] able to come back in the evening but
[41:26] maybe if we have enough ahead time up
[41:29] that we'll make a special effort to come
[41:31] back sunday evening this sunday that
[41:34] brother ron's
[41:35] up with us he's a long longtime friend
[41:37] of mine
[41:38] i will say this disclaimer
[41:41] out front that you'll hear stories
[41:44] and
[41:45] they may not all be true and i'll
[41:48] guarantee it they will be slightly
[41:51] exaggerated
[41:55] and
[41:56] and i know when ron starts to think
[41:59] about
[42:00] us being on this platform together there
[42:03] will probably be tears come to his eyes
[42:05] and he'll probably cry a little bit but
[42:09] it'll be worth it
[42:11] all so i think you really enjoy brother
[42:13] ron and you might find out some things
[42:16] about me but it's only through his
[42:18] perspective
[42:19] that it doesn't
[42:21] it doesn't mean it's reality at all
[42:24] so i don't really have a title but if if
[42:27] i was
[42:29] i would say that all inspiration
[42:33] and all revelation
[42:36] must be governed by the word
[42:40] okay
[42:42] and
[42:43] and now
[42:45] today and
[42:47] and and it is important
[42:50] that a person has an experience
[42:53] and i know coming from camp and that's
[42:56] what camp is for we preached a message
[42:59] called going beyond the camp
[43:02] using what the prophet of god preached
[43:04] but you have to go to camp before you
[43:07] can go beyond the camp
[43:09] and you heard i'm saying so a lot of
[43:12] times because young people and their
[43:14] battles with the world and most of the
[43:16] time uh when you have a meeting like
[43:19] that
[43:20] they're dealing with the battles they're
[43:22] dealing with satan they're dealing with
[43:24] satan's influence on your life they're
[43:27] dealing with the pulls the struggle the
[43:29] spirits that are pulling at you trying
[43:32] to bring you to
[43:33] an an experience
[43:36] but uh and so there's a lot of emphasis
[43:40] that is placed on the experience
[43:44] and so
[43:45] we're ministering tonight because
[43:48] you need to have a guide
[43:51] after
[43:52] the experience
[43:53] and what's going to be your guide for
[43:56] after the experience and so
[44:00] uh
[44:01] and we're going to play 27 minutes
[44:04] out of a message called doing god a
[44:06] service without it being his will
[44:09] and i'd like to read this little
[44:11] statement
[44:12] out of masterpiece
[44:14] and and tie the two a little bit
[44:16] together before we go further it says in
[44:19] the masterpiece in paragraph 118 but you
[44:22] can't hide a germanized seed
[44:28] okay
[44:29] it's got to come forth
[44:32] because why
[44:34] the great sculptor is on the job
[44:38] he's going to build again
[44:41] he the seed went down the word but the
[44:45] great sculpture's on the job and you
[44:48] can't hide it
[44:49] so
[44:50] how many leave the great sculpture still
[44:52] on the job
[44:53] amen he's still carving away at me
[44:56] you know what i mean but
[44:59] that and it can't hide so there's going
[45:02] to be things about the genuine church
[45:07] the genuine bride that has
[45:10] characteristics about her
[45:13] that become identifiable
[45:16] now today there's a lot of move in the
[45:18] spirit not just in the message but in
[45:21] the world because a lot of people are
[45:23] led here
[45:24] led there i i
[45:26] god told me to do this
[45:28] god told me to do that
[45:30] now there's got to be a way to discern
[45:33] that
[45:35] you you understand and there's got to be
[45:38] something that god's given you
[45:41] to make choices by
[45:43] something that's apart from feeling
[45:48] you understand because
[45:52] numbers and groups of numbers create a
[45:56] lot of feeling
[45:57] a lot of kids do things
[46:00] that they never would do alone
[46:03] wrong things they know that's wrong
[46:06] because they get caught up in the crowd
[46:09] two or three are doing it or four or
[46:11] five
[46:12] and so they lose their personal identity
[46:16] they take on the identity of the group
[46:19] they participate in a group activity
[46:23] and then they suffer as an individual
[46:28] you know what i'm saying
[46:30] so
[46:31] uh
[46:32] i have to say as a pastor
[46:34] i'm extremely proud of our congregation
[46:39] i mean my buttons pop
[46:41] wherever our we go
[46:43] and i think part of the reasons we are
[46:46] what we are because we listen to tapes
[46:50] and we put the words of the prophet
[46:53] first
[46:54] so what we're talking about tonight is
[46:58] is
[46:59] that
[47:00] and we'll listen to a little bit and
[47:01] i'll make a few comments but we're
[47:04] talking about what must govern
[47:08] okay you know what govern means it means
[47:10] direct control
[47:12] be in charge of
[47:14] what must be in charge of your
[47:16] inspiration
[47:18] what must be in charge of your
[47:20] revelation
[47:22] what pathway should you take
[47:25] after you've had an experience
[47:29] and so we want to establish these things
[47:31] because it'll make you smarter
[47:35] better
[47:36] uh
[47:37] christians
[47:38] and so if god's on the scene and the
[47:41] masterpiece is working
[47:44] those that he's dealing with
[47:47] will
[47:48] have this characteristic
[47:51] okay it'll be one of the things that
[47:54] they know that you've had a genuine
[47:56] experience
[47:58] that you are his child
[48:01] because you do it the way
[48:03] the father
[48:05] does it so we're going to start in
[48:07] paragraph 26
[48:10] and and i and by no means am i trying to
[48:13] shorten the message or cut up the
[48:15] message or chop the message up
[48:18] but the prophet of god said you read a
[48:20] portion of it you go back and read it
[48:22] again so the the message is available to
[48:26] you
[48:27] uh to listen to all of it
[48:30] there's more in this message than the
[48:32] part that i'm going to play
[48:34] but i want us not to be established in a
[48:37] second-hand revelation i want us to be
[48:40] established in the things that the
[48:42] prophet of god said so what he's going
[48:44] to talk about is how
[48:47] you go about something
[48:49] and when you have an inspiration
[48:52] and you have a revelation
[48:55] how do you go forward with it
[49:00] you know
[49:01] what's my next step
[49:04] okay i got this great idea
[49:07] i really want to do this
[49:10] i feel led to do it i have a holy
[49:13] unction i feel inspired that is not
[49:18] what governs you
[49:20] that may be what motivates you
[49:23] that may be what drives you
[49:25] that may be what stimulates you but it's
[49:28] not what controls you what controls you
[49:31] is
[49:32] the word so let's listen to this 27
[49:35] minutes
[49:36] and uh then we'll just talk about it i i
[49:40] it's a teaching it's just a
[49:43] time we don't have to have a revival
[49:45] every time we come together
[49:48] you know what i mean we don't have to
[49:50] shout the roof off we don't have to kick
[49:52] the walls down
[49:53] to be christians
[49:55] you know what i mean we can be solid
[49:58] as a rock
[50:01] take the word
[50:02] and go out
[50:04] i've sat down with people to eat and
[50:06] every bite is mmm
[50:10] and then they eat some salad
[50:13] this is so good
[50:14] and and they're just absolutely
[50:17] having some kind of jubilee you know and
[50:19] i'm thinking every meal
[50:22] give me a break all you want to do in
[50:24] life is eat
[50:26] you know i wish i didn't have to eat
[50:28] it's a waste of time
[50:30] but
[50:31] anyway so we can be solid in the word
[50:34] right anchor
[50:36] take it in our heart
[50:37] know it's a fact
[50:39] no it's the truth
[50:42] don't it is what it is we don't have to
[50:44] show any emotion on it but yet
[50:48] it's the rule
[50:51] of law
[50:53] everybody thinks they've come out of the
[50:55] law
[50:55] no
[50:56] we're under a law
[50:58] we're under a different rule
[51:01] of law
[51:02] and that's
[51:04] what
[51:05] we're talking about we're talking about
[51:07] the law
[51:08] of inspiration and revelation being
[51:12] governed by the word i hope you enjoy
[51:14] this next 26 minutes we'll finish up and
[51:17] we won't be too long god bless you don't
[51:20] you love listening to your prophet
[51:21] aren't you glad you have him
[51:24] to guide you and that god in his wisdom
[51:27] created an instrument
[51:29] to store the food up
[51:31] in the storehouse
[51:33] amen that's the storehouse that's where
[51:36] the food is is in those sermons so god
[51:38] bless you as we listen
[51:42] we're in the end time
[51:45] now
[51:46] the lord bless you richly i get started
[51:49] on that and forget about
[51:51] time
[51:52] we're going to fade quick pretty quickly
[51:55] into eternity anyhow
[51:58] and now
[51:59] in saint mark
[52:01] the seventh chapter and the seventh
[52:03] verse
[52:05] to bring a text to this subject that was
[52:08] just read in first chronicles 13
[52:12] to make a text for this i want mark 7 7
[52:16] in vain do they worship me
[52:20] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[52:23] of man
[52:26] now i know nothing but
[52:28] the message the lord has given me
[52:32] and that's all i can speak on
[52:35] and now i'm going to
[52:38] speak on a subject this morning which i
[52:40] thought would be
[52:42] good
[52:44] and tonight i want to speak on meat in
[52:46] due season if the lord willing
[52:49] spiritual food
[52:51] and due season
[52:53] and how to receive it
[52:55] now
[52:57] you know this
[52:58] morning
[53:00] trying to do god a service without being
[53:03] the will of god
[53:05] god is sovereign
[53:09] and we see here what david done
[53:12] in the scripture reading of first
[53:14] chronicles 13
[53:19] and he was his intentions were good
[53:23] but god does not
[53:26] [Music]
[53:27] give us merits on good intentions
[53:31] there's only one way to serve god that's
[53:33] by doing his will
[53:36] at his command
[53:39] and god being sovereign
[53:42] there's no one to tell him what to do or
[53:44] how to do it
[53:46] he does it the way he
[53:49] knows the right way to do it
[53:52] and that makes me feel good
[53:55] and that ought to make all of us feel
[53:56] good and i'm sure it does
[53:58] for one would have it coming this way
[54:00] and one have it going that way and one
[54:02] the other way
[54:04] but
[54:05] one great thing again about god he's not
[54:08] left us now
[54:10] without knowing what's the truth
[54:12] and how to do it he wouldn't be just
[54:15] to punish us for doing something
[54:17] that we didn't know how it was going to
[54:19] be done
[54:21] and then let us stumble into something
[54:24] he's not that kind of a god
[54:27] he's a god that speaks the word and
[54:29] expects his children to believe it
[54:32] and
[54:33] therefore he knows
[54:35] what's best and when to do it and how to
[54:37] do it
[54:38] we have our ideas of it but he knows
[54:42] and then if he
[54:44] set up a system
[54:46] that what he's going to do and didn't
[54:48] tell us what was going to happen and how
[54:50] it was going to happen then we
[54:52] stumbling at it would be
[54:54] would be justified in in our stumblings
[54:57] or trying to do something each one would
[54:59] be justified but there's only one way
[55:03] and that is his word
[55:06] and another thing david here we see
[55:09] that in his heart
[55:12] he wanted to do something that was good
[55:16] he had no bad motive or no bad objective
[55:20] but the house or the ark of the lord
[55:25] was away from the
[55:27] the people
[55:29] and he wanted to bring the ark of god
[55:31] back to its place so the people would
[55:33] consult god
[55:35] about the things that they wanted
[55:39] instead of
[55:40] of just letting it go we
[55:43] what if brother blair and the father
[55:45] this little boy said well too bad
[55:48] child just got
[55:51] hurt killed
[55:53] i guess just something happened
[55:55] but they went quickly to god
[55:58] what the little lady and her husband
[56:00] minister of the gospel
[56:03] a few nights ago or days when that
[56:06] little lady had that bursted spine that
[56:08] just stood up
[56:10] the doctor said she'll be paralyzed all
[56:12] her life
[56:14] what if the husband she had said well
[56:16] honey we'll just uh console ourselves to
[56:19] that
[56:20] but quickly they've done something about
[56:22] it
[56:24] it went to god
[56:26] how many things in the bible could we
[56:29] refer to
[56:30] of how when people get in trouble
[56:32] get to god
[56:34] well then in them days
[56:37] they had only one meeting place where
[56:39] they could meet god and that was at the
[56:40] ark under the blood
[56:42] that's the only meeting place yet
[56:45] under the blood
[56:47] the mercy seat was sprinkled to give
[56:49] mercy to the worshiper or the asker when
[56:52] he come to ask the petition of god
[56:55] god had a special routine the way you
[56:58] had to go to about that and he wouldn't
[57:00] accept anything else
[57:02] you wouldn't accept any other provision
[57:04] just the way he
[57:06] fixed it
[57:08] recently i just preached on a message
[57:09] many of you know about it that only one
[57:13] provided place that god meets the
[57:15] worshiper
[57:16] the place that he said i'll put my name
[57:19] if we can find the church that he put
[57:21] his name in then we got the place
[57:24] he said i will not bless you in all the
[57:26] gates just the gates that i put my name
[57:30] in i'll put it in one place
[57:32] and you've got to meet me there that's
[57:34] the only place i'll meet you
[57:36] and we found out through there where he
[57:37] put his name
[57:39] that's the only place that he meets the
[57:40] worshiper and his name
[57:43] with jesus christ
[57:45] god
[57:46] name is jesus christ
[57:49] jesus said i come in my father's name
[57:52] every son comes in his father's name
[57:55] and he came in the name of the father
[57:56] and there's
[57:58] not another name under heaven given
[58:00] among men worse called methodist baptist
[58:02] presbyterian church of christ whatever
[58:04] it might be done is only one meeting
[58:07] place that god meets man and that's when
[58:09] he's in jesus christ
[58:12] only place
[58:14] and all these old things back here are
[58:16] the old testament type that
[58:19] i want you to clearly understand it now
[58:22] it's a sunday school lesson
[58:24] i've got some scriptures and notes
[58:26] written down here
[58:28] now i thought that this would help you
[58:30] to understand
[58:32] as all the old things happen for
[58:34] examples to us
[58:36] now we find that god
[58:39] had a way of doing things but david just
[58:42] being blessed of god like he had to
[58:44] become king
[58:47] he just thought that he would just do
[58:48] something for god anyhow
[58:50] and he never went about it in the right
[58:52] way
[58:54] we noticed
[58:55] god reveals his word
[58:58] in his own predestinated season
[59:03] now how can martin luther annoyed about
[59:05] the message today
[59:08] how could the presbyterians how could
[59:10] martin the catholic church know martin
[59:13] luther's message
[59:15] how could john wesley
[59:17] of note luther's message
[59:19] how could wesley a note the pentecostal
[59:21] message
[59:22] or how could the pentecostals know this
[59:25] message
[59:26] see
[59:27] he reveals it in his seasons because it
[59:30] is a seed
[59:32] and as
[59:34] it grows and matures he reveals himself
[59:37] like the heat of the sun to open up when
[59:40] it's tender and young
[59:41] bring it out of the ground the seed
[59:44] then give it its leaves in another
[59:47] stage of the sun hot sun will kill it if
[59:49] it's the ripening seed a ripening time
[59:52] so he regulates the sun and regulates
[59:55] nature
[59:56] to meet
[59:58] his word
[1:00:00] he regulates the church
[1:00:03] the predestination of the bride
[1:00:05] to meet the season that they are living
[1:00:08] in
[1:00:10] even nature itself tells us today as we
[1:00:12] see the nations breaking the earth
[1:00:14] sinking in the handwriting is on the
[1:00:17] wall
[1:00:18] we see the church in the states it's in
[1:00:20] we see the bride in the states she's in
[1:00:23] and we know by
[1:00:25] nature
[1:00:26] that the church is
[1:00:29] getting ready to leave
[1:00:32] what a glorious time
[1:00:34] it's a time that all the prophets long
[1:00:37] to see this hour
[1:00:40] now
[1:00:41] he reveals his word only in its season
[1:00:45] martin luther read the same bible we did
[1:00:48] wesley read the same bible martin luther
[1:00:51] did pentecostals read the same bible we
[1:00:53] read
[1:00:55] jesus read the same bible
[1:00:58] that the pharisees read
[1:01:01] but they had trying to keep the corn in
[1:01:04] an early stage when it was ripening
[1:01:06] they failed to see their hour
[1:01:10] now david has done the same thing here
[1:01:14] god reveals this word in the season
[1:01:17] and to whom he chooses to reveal it to
[1:01:22] god chooses who he reveals it to
[1:01:26] he chose that before the foundation of
[1:01:29] the world
[1:01:32] all of his doings were foreknown by him
[1:01:36] hidden from man he just reveals him as
[1:01:39] he will
[1:01:40] it is his chosen
[1:01:43] season
[1:01:44] his chosen
[1:01:46] person
[1:01:48] and he never did choose a party or sec
[1:01:52] it's a chosen person
[1:01:56] how he does it
[1:01:58] who is it that will dare to correct him
[1:02:01] and said our lord you made a mistake by
[1:02:04] putting this man in the ministry
[1:02:06] this man doesn't believe like we believe
[1:02:10] who's going to tell god he's wrong in it
[1:02:14] it would take somebody that's a little
[1:02:16] more of a delinquent than i am
[1:02:19] to telling that
[1:02:21] he knows what he's doing
[1:02:25] he knows who to choose and who not to
[1:02:27] choose what to do and when to do it
[1:02:33] no matter how much we think that a
[1:02:35] certain person is qualified to do a
[1:02:37] certain job
[1:02:39] god knows who's qualified
[1:02:42] for the time in the season
[1:02:45] or the time and the right time to do it
[1:02:49] and the real true christian the real
[1:02:51] true believer in god waits upon the lord
[1:02:54] for these things
[1:02:56] wait on your ministry
[1:02:59] if you feel the call
[1:03:01] be sure that it's god
[1:03:03] be sure that it's right be sure that
[1:03:05] it's timely of what you're saying
[1:03:08] the bible said they that wait upon the
[1:03:10] lord shall renew their strength
[1:03:12] they shall mount up with the wings like
[1:03:15] an eagle
[1:03:16] they shall run and not be weary
[1:03:19] if they walk do not faint
[1:03:23] notice david king of israel
[1:03:28] just anointed samuel poured all upon him
[1:03:32] and he was chosen of god
[1:03:37] to be king of israel
[1:03:41] and david got this revelation
[1:03:45] to bring the ark of the lord
[1:03:48] up to the city of david
[1:03:52] now there's nothing wrong
[1:03:55] but you see david went at it wrong
[1:04:00] now it looks like if a man like that
[1:04:02] would get a revelation
[1:04:05] a great man like god's chosen king
[1:04:10] the greatest king that ever lived on
[1:04:12] earth outside of christ
[1:04:14] our guest was david because
[1:04:16] uh christ is the son of david
[1:04:20] now the greatest man freshly anointed
[1:04:23] coming from the very presence of god
[1:04:27] got a revelation to do something for god
[1:04:31] and wanted to do it for god but the
[1:04:34] revelation was wrong
[1:04:38] now that's a great thing
[1:04:41] you know deal with our subject trying to
[1:04:42] do god a service without being called to
[1:04:44] do it
[1:04:45] notice
[1:04:50] david got the revelation
[1:04:53] and notice
[1:04:55] it was not the prophet nathanael that
[1:04:57] got the revelation
[1:04:59] it was david the king that got the
[1:05:01] revelation
[1:05:04] neither was nathanael consulted about it
[1:05:08] he never asked nathanael but did you see
[1:05:11] her in first chronicles he consulted
[1:05:14] captains
[1:05:15] of thousands and captains of hundreds
[1:05:19] he never consulted
[1:05:21] nathanael
[1:05:23] he consulted the people
[1:05:27] and he consulted also the priests and
[1:05:30] the theologians of that day the scribes
[1:05:34] and the theologians david consulted
[1:05:38] first said if it this be a god
[1:05:42] let us go down and bring the ark of the
[1:05:45] covenant of our god
[1:05:47] up into the city and let us consult god
[1:05:50] before we do things
[1:05:52] but said in the days of saul
[1:05:54] they left off consulting god by the
[1:05:57] the
[1:05:58] the ark
[1:06:00] yurim
[1:06:02] your thundum
[1:06:04] they left off doing that david said now
[1:06:07] let's get back to god all of us
[1:06:09] let's get back to the right thing
[1:06:13] let's go down and get the ark and bring
[1:06:14] it here
[1:06:16] bring the presence of god in other words
[1:06:18] into the city
[1:06:20] let's hold a revival
[1:06:22] let's bring the people back
[1:06:24] but he got the revelation which seemed
[1:06:26] to be good
[1:06:28] but it wasn't the will of god
[1:06:32] instead of asking the source
[1:06:35] that he should have asked he consulted
[1:06:37] his captains because he just become king
[1:06:40] and he followed that line of thinking
[1:06:44] that his chief captains
[1:06:46] and his great man
[1:06:48] then he went into the church nominal
[1:06:52] and asked that they could have the
[1:06:53] revival
[1:06:54] the priests the scribes
[1:06:57] the captains of thousands the captains
[1:06:59] of hunters and he consulted them
[1:07:02] what's this the will of the lord and
[1:07:04] they said it was
[1:07:07] but you see
[1:07:09] he failed to ask the main resource that
[1:07:12] god always deals through
[1:07:14] he failed to get it now his intention
[1:07:17] was good
[1:07:18] his motive was good his objective was
[1:07:21] good
[1:07:22] to bring a revival in the city
[1:07:24] bring the people back to god
[1:07:27] but he never consulted the way god told
[1:07:30] him to do it see
[1:07:32] even all the people agreed in the priest
[1:07:35] and that the king was right
[1:07:37] they needed the ark back in the city
[1:07:41] now they needed the presence of god they
[1:07:44] needed a revival
[1:07:46] but god had not promised to reveal his
[1:07:48] word in its season to the peoples
[1:07:53] he never promised to reveal it to the
[1:07:55] king in the season
[1:07:57] god doesn't change a bit
[1:08:02] he didn't promise to do that no matter
[1:08:04] how sincere what good motives and what
[1:08:06] good objectives and how people want
[1:08:09] those things and see the need of it
[1:08:12] there is a will of god to be carried out
[1:08:15] in these things
[1:08:17] that's what i want to
[1:08:19] drive down tight
[1:08:24] for i want to
[1:08:25] make this soul that you
[1:08:27] have to see it if
[1:08:29] if the spirit of god dwells in you
[1:08:34] and that's the reason i'm lingering so
[1:08:36] long here not taking you people's time
[1:08:38] on a telephone and on the hook up
[1:08:40] but i want you to see it if you run out
[1:08:43] of time then get the tape
[1:08:47] that there no matter how much is needed
[1:08:52] how much everybody agrees that it's
[1:08:54] needed
[1:08:56] how much that that is the truth there's
[1:08:58] yet one thing to find out
[1:09:02] is that the will of god
[1:09:10] how many believes that's timely
[1:09:15] amen okay
[1:09:18] now
[1:09:19] there is so much there
[1:09:22] right and that's that's what we want to
[1:09:24] do he says this is a sunday school
[1:09:26] lesson
[1:09:27] uh this is a thing
[1:09:29] this is a thing that we've got to
[1:09:33] make sure
[1:09:34] that uh that uh
[1:09:36] there's there's a way to go about about
[1:09:39] it
[1:09:40] there's something that has to be
[1:09:42] consulted
[1:09:43] and
[1:09:44] and everything's got to be
[1:09:47] uh checked out
[1:09:49] you know and it it's like uh
[1:09:52] the prophet of god said you know they
[1:09:54] said uh well that's the you know that's
[1:09:57] the way
[1:09:58] uh the priest did it you know so i i
[1:10:01] just want to read this now instead of
[1:10:03] playing it
[1:10:05] but just to continue on with what
[1:10:07] brother branham's saying this is
[1:10:08] paragraph 93
[1:10:11] if they can find that
[1:10:14] and
[1:10:15] put it out so
[1:10:21] there's something that brother ben kept
[1:10:23] referring to
[1:10:24] and it's consulting
[1:10:28] right he asked this group and he asked
[1:10:31] this group and he asked the people and
[1:10:34] he asked that and he asked that and he
[1:10:35] consulted with captains he consulted
[1:10:38] with this but he never consulted
[1:10:43] with the source that god had
[1:10:47] which was nathaniel
[1:10:50] he never asked him because what does
[1:10:53] nathanael had the ability to go to god
[1:10:56] and talked it over with god and bring an
[1:10:58] answer
[1:11:00] and if he would have talked to nathanael
[1:11:03] he would have went about it the right
[1:11:05] way
[1:11:06] so remember
[1:11:09] his desire was what good
[1:11:13] his revelation was
[1:11:15] true
[1:11:17] but he went about it the what
[1:11:20] the wrong
[1:11:21] way
[1:11:27] is it possible there's a wrong way
[1:11:30] to do the right thing
[1:11:33] that's a paradox
[1:11:35] isn't it
[1:11:39] but if you build anything
[1:11:41] on
[1:11:42] shifting sands
[1:11:45] right if it's not built on the right
[1:11:48] foundation
[1:11:50] it won't stand
[1:11:53] you know and a lot of people have
[1:11:55] received blessings and they've received
[1:11:58] experiences and then they've went and
[1:12:00] tried to build their
[1:12:03] christian
[1:12:05] existence going forward on that feeling
[1:12:10] you know okay remember we talked about
[1:12:12] weaponizing it right well the only way
[1:12:15] you can ever weaponize it is to make it
[1:12:17] something that lasts and there's only
[1:12:19] one thing that lasts and that's his word
[1:12:24] look you know i
[1:12:26] if i could just have some way within me
[1:12:29] to express to you and and as a pastor
[1:12:33] and have an understanding is that
[1:12:37] we need to be led by god's word
[1:12:45] not our idea of god's word
[1:12:48] not our interpretation
[1:12:51] of the scriptures
[1:12:53] not our conclusion
[1:12:56] get three or four guys to conclude
[1:12:58] together and say yes this but to be able
[1:13:02] to go back to the source
[1:13:05] and have it anchored
[1:13:07] in god's word so listen as we just read
[1:13:11] this i think the brothers can put it up
[1:13:13] there he said
[1:13:16] he says now
[1:13:18] now close
[1:13:20] now close listen
[1:13:22] let's listen close
[1:13:25] don't miss this now see
[1:13:27] the first thing when they consulted the
[1:13:29] priest
[1:13:31] consulted the dignitaries
[1:13:33] consulted the military consulted the
[1:13:37] congregation the neighborhood
[1:13:40] to get together for this great meeting
[1:13:42] to come
[1:13:44] they failed to do it right
[1:13:47] they didn't consult god
[1:13:50] and by doing so
[1:13:52] not going back and see
[1:13:55] what
[1:13:56] time it was
[1:14:02] now
[1:14:04] this is something we don't really do
[1:14:06] very often is consult the hour
[1:14:11] you know some things aren't appropriate
[1:14:16] you understand if your house is on fire
[1:14:18] you don't try to move the bedroom
[1:14:20] furniture
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:26] you go grab your documents you go grab
[1:14:28] whatever pictures that
[1:14:30] you hold dear that things that are
[1:14:32] irreplaceable
[1:14:34] but you don't get a hold of things that
[1:14:37] are
[1:14:38] that are replaceable
[1:14:41] because you haven't consulted the hour
[1:14:46] and a lot of people don't consult the
[1:14:49] time
[1:14:52] now things you know things may have
[1:14:56] been okay in a different day in a
[1:14:58] different hour
[1:15:02] you know what i'm saying but now things
[1:15:04] are in a different light
[1:15:07] so things what maybe people could got
[1:15:09] away with before
[1:15:11] and we could relax on before
[1:15:15] we've got to consult the hour
[1:15:18] so we certainly can't be consulting the
[1:15:21] nominal christian world right what songs
[1:15:24] they're singing how they're worshiping
[1:15:27] you know why because they're worshiping
[1:15:29] they're going forward like they're going
[1:15:30] to live forever
[1:15:32] they don't believe jesus might show up
[1:15:34] tomorrow they don't believe they have to
[1:15:36] take inventory they don't believe they
[1:15:38] have to apply the token they don't
[1:15:40] believe the holy spirit's going to look
[1:15:41] in their closet to see what they're
[1:15:44] storing up they're not they don't know
[1:15:45] what kind of things they wear and the
[1:15:47] styles they wear and everything
[1:15:52] you know and and
[1:15:54] and you got to remember
[1:15:57] that the words the word
[1:16:00] culture is of man
[1:16:04] every culture the way the japanese
[1:16:06] people dress the way the chinese dress
[1:16:09] the philippines the indians
[1:16:11] uh uh the africans the americans all of
[1:16:15] that
[1:16:16] has got to conform to god's word there
[1:16:20] is no public opinion outside of god's
[1:16:23] word
[1:16:24] certain cultures wear tight dresses
[1:16:28] certain cultures wear dresses with pants
[1:16:34] you know
[1:16:35] but it's still got to come back to the
[1:16:38] word of god it's not given for us to
[1:16:41] make determinations god knows what's
[1:16:44] right god knows what's best god knows
[1:16:46] what he's doing god laid down the plan
[1:16:51] okay so you've got to understand he has
[1:16:54] got the answer
[1:16:56] and we'll read those quotes right before
[1:16:57] i close
[1:16:59] tonight but he says so they they consult
[1:17:02] every they consult everything
[1:17:05] but they didn't consult god and by doing
[1:17:08] so
[1:17:10] not going back to see what time it was
[1:17:13] oh brother listen what time are we
[1:17:17] living in
[1:17:21] consult the time
[1:17:23] consult the hour
[1:17:25] why are things as strict as they are in
[1:17:28] the message of the hour why are things
[1:17:30] as precise as they are in the message of
[1:17:34] the hour
[1:17:35] why is the word so steadfast in the
[1:17:38] message of the hour because this is the
[1:17:41] hour that satan appears as an angel of
[1:17:44] life
[1:17:48] and he gained access to the name of
[1:17:51] jesus christ at the nicaea council
[1:17:55] and he's been building up to this day
[1:17:57] building up to this day using scriptures
[1:18:00] using jesus name using everything to
[1:18:04] build a system to say it's god's will
[1:18:08] and everything but even a
[1:18:10] revelation and an inspiration
[1:18:14] has to be governed by god's word
[1:18:20] when i say god's word
[1:18:25] didn't brother braham just say they all
[1:18:26] read the same bible
[1:18:33] it's the revealed word
[1:18:36] that governs
[1:18:38] the revealed word said in the last days
[1:18:41] i'll send you malachi 4 5. i'll send you
[1:18:44] elijah the prophet so he can turn your
[1:18:48] hearts back
[1:18:50] to the hearts of the father and what did
[1:18:53] our fathers do
[1:18:55] they all read the same bible the scribes
[1:18:58] and pharisees did but they saw by
[1:19:01] revelation the fulfillment of the word
[1:19:04] for the hour what your hearts are turned
[1:19:06] back to is the revelation of the
[1:19:10] fulfillment of god's word for the hour
[1:19:15] so now you see by divine revelation you
[1:19:19] have a path a pathetic voice
[1:19:23] to consult
[1:19:29] oh but we still consult the preachers
[1:19:35] i'm happy if you come to me for
[1:19:38] counseling
[1:19:39] it makes it a lot easier with me if
[1:19:41] you've prayed about it and looked and
[1:19:43] found out what the prophet of god said
[1:19:45] about it because if you come with me all
[1:19:48] we're going to do is try to find out
[1:19:50] what the prophet of god said about it
[1:19:56] because i got confidence
[1:19:59] in this word right here
[1:20:02] so let's just read as we're reading on
[1:20:05] listen what's the age
[1:20:10] what's the hour that we're living in
[1:20:13] it's not time for these things
[1:20:16] that they're talking about
[1:20:20] hmm
[1:20:24] they've passed
[1:20:26] judgment is
[1:20:28] on hand now
[1:20:31] you can see it breaking
[1:20:35] you remember the rock on the mountain
[1:20:38] judgment hour you remember the
[1:20:40] revelation or the vision of the bride
[1:20:43] just keep
[1:20:45] her in step
[1:20:47] don't let her get out of step
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:56] and just think of it
[1:20:58] because as we read it says here now
[1:21:00] notice upon the shoulders of the priest
[1:21:04] and david and the
[1:21:06] and all the priests that really ought to
[1:21:09] have known better
[1:21:12] but what was it the priest should have
[1:21:14] known better the scribes the theologians
[1:21:16] should have known better because the
[1:21:18] word of god said not to do that but what
[1:21:21] didn't they do
[1:21:24] they didn't consult it
[1:21:29] and today when they want to say oh jesus
[1:21:32] christ
[1:21:33] isn't the same yesterday here forever
[1:21:36] that's mental telepathy
[1:21:39] that's this that or the other thing they
[1:21:42] failed to see the promised
[1:21:44] word
[1:21:46] oh that
[1:21:47] was a day
[1:21:49] gone by let me tell you something that's
[1:21:52] happening in this message right now
[1:21:56] they don't want to sing songs the way
[1:21:58] the prophet sung it they don't want to
[1:21:59] have church the way the prophet done it
[1:22:01] they don't want to dress the way the
[1:22:03] prophet have done it they feel there's a
[1:22:05] new revival a new spirit this new
[1:22:08] revival that we're experiencing will
[1:22:11] take us back to this word
[1:22:16] it'll take us back to what the prophet
[1:22:19] of god said it'll open our eyes to what
[1:22:22] the prophet of outside that it's not
[1:22:24] built on feelings it's not built on
[1:22:26] emotion as wonderful as the testimonies
[1:22:29] are if you don't know how to go forward
[1:22:32] with that testimony and govern your
[1:22:35] inspiration and govern your revelation
[1:22:38] by the message of the hour god's
[1:22:41] revealed word you'll get in a wreck
[1:22:48] and then you'll wonder was my experience
[1:22:50] right
[1:22:52] and you'll go through this whole great
[1:22:55] big doubt
[1:22:56] battle
[1:23:03] and you could have saved yourself
[1:23:05] a lot of trouble
[1:23:08] i sat down watching some people play
[1:23:13] cards the other day and
[1:23:15] they all had their cards fanned out and
[1:23:17] have a bunch of chips on the table and
[1:23:19] they're playing and they changed the
[1:23:21] color of the chips
[1:23:25] they changed the picture on the cart
[1:23:28] i didn't yell at them
[1:23:31] i just said i certainly if i was you
[1:23:33] guys i'd find out what the prophet of
[1:23:34] god said about it
[1:23:39] christians bowling now
[1:23:41] in the message
[1:23:43] how many of those just be honest how
[1:23:45] many knows what brother brown said about
[1:23:47] about bowling
[1:23:49] and bowling alleys
[1:23:54] he said it's one of the most foul places
[1:23:57] more evil spirit and that's where a lot
[1:23:59] of adultery goes on
[1:24:04] we're going to go bowling
[1:24:08] that's cool
[1:24:10] let's all do it
[1:24:12] we're all young people we're all
[1:24:14] together we're all going to have fun
[1:24:16] bowling
[1:24:20] great
[1:24:22] what did the prophet say
[1:24:27] well why is he against poland i don't
[1:24:28] know
[1:24:30] he knows
[1:24:32] he knows why
[1:24:35] it's the hour
[1:24:37] it's the time a lot of this music that
[1:24:40] that we have to deal with it's new now
[1:24:42] listen to what david says here watch how
[1:24:44] he follow down
[1:24:46] he says
[1:24:48] he said
[1:24:49] he said
[1:24:50] he says and today when they say oh jesus
[1:24:53] christ isn't the same yesterday and
[1:24:55] forever
[1:24:57] other words it's not the same word it's
[1:24:58] not the same message
[1:25:01] okay he says that's mental telepathy
[1:25:04] that's this that the other whatever they
[1:25:07] say in others it's not just mental
[1:25:09] telepathy
[1:25:11] it's what brother branham didn't know
[1:25:13] about what we'd have here today he
[1:25:15] didn't know we'd have cell phones he
[1:25:17] didn't know we'd have computers
[1:25:19] jesus knew
[1:25:21] and he still preached the gospel he
[1:25:23] preached
[1:25:28] why is that
[1:25:30] because it's done by revelation
[1:25:35] and what's revelation governed by
[1:25:38] the word okay he how many times your
[1:25:41] brother man says how can you say it's
[1:25:43] the holy ghost when it doesn't line up
[1:25:45] to this word
[1:25:47] and then to explain it to everybody he
[1:25:50] preached anointed ones at the end time
[1:25:53] which were people that were led by
[1:25:55] revelation led by inspiration but they
[1:25:58] weren't governed by the what
[1:26:00] the word
[1:26:03] i've had a lot of good sisters probably
[1:26:06] most of them preach better than i do
[1:26:09] god told me to preach
[1:26:11] they preach the socks off there it's not
[1:26:13] god's will
[1:26:16] it's not his word
[1:26:19] well i'm inspired you may be
[1:26:22] i'm anointed you may be
[1:26:28] but
[1:26:29] inspiration and revelation
[1:26:33] is governed by the word it doesn't
[1:26:36] govern itself
[1:26:40] now do you remember what the prophet
[1:26:42] said would it be right for i'll read it
[1:26:44] just close up on reading that i want you
[1:26:46] to understand there's a reason why god
[1:26:48] does everything that he does
[1:26:51] the reason he sent this message
[1:26:54] if the reason he preached every sermon
[1:26:56] he preached the way he preached it the
[1:26:58] way he put his sentences i'll go as far
[1:27:01] because that even the way that his the
[1:27:03] prophet the way his mouth is formed to
[1:27:05] speak words is of god
[1:27:11] he says
[1:27:12] david said
[1:27:14] oh well now wait a minute
[1:27:17] upon the shoulders of the priest
[1:27:20] that was back when moses come out
[1:27:26] sure
[1:27:28] we'll put it on a new cart today
[1:27:32] i got
[1:27:34] a revelation of it
[1:27:37] you see it so
[1:27:40] the the one thing that we're talking
[1:27:42] about is
[1:27:43] in everything you make consult the hour
[1:27:47] and consult the profit
[1:27:53] if you don't get something to be able to
[1:27:55] consult the hour look at what time we're
[1:27:58] in
[1:27:59] there's a lot of things that are lawful
[1:28:02] but they're not expedient for our growth
[1:28:06] they're not expedient for our
[1:28:08] preparation for a rapture
[1:28:11] they're not expedient to give to give
[1:28:14] our time to to give our effort to
[1:28:18] to give our prep time to
[1:28:22] they're not expedient
[1:28:24] you consult the hour i really believe
[1:28:27] that if if we could get young people to
[1:28:30] get the revelation of consulting the
[1:28:33] hour the amount of time they spend
[1:28:35] playing video games would dissipate
[1:28:38] rapidly
[1:28:42] if they had an understanding of a
[1:28:44] standard
[1:28:46] that they needed to meet
[1:28:50] in a in a position that they needed to
[1:28:52] come in
[1:28:54] you know what i mean
[1:28:55] what i'm saying is you can't always do
[1:28:58] everything fighting against the devil
[1:29:02] you know you don't need the holy ghost
[1:29:04] to get free of the devil
[1:29:09] that's not the only reason you get the
[1:29:11] holy ghost because you've been haunted
[1:29:13] with demons and you've fought with
[1:29:15] demons and that's great
[1:29:17] that's what the holy ghost is for it's
[1:29:19] to cast those demons out but now those
[1:29:22] demons are cast out what's going to
[1:29:24] guide you
[1:29:25] how are you going to make the next
[1:29:26] decision how are you going to grow
[1:29:29] forward
[1:29:32] how are you going to build on that
[1:29:33] experience
[1:29:38] you going to go pack the ark in on some
[1:29:40] shoulders
[1:29:42] or or on a cart
[1:29:46] the revelation was right bring the ark
[1:29:52] but the revelation had to be governed
[1:29:56] by the word
[1:29:57] the inspiration was great i feel
[1:30:00] inspired to do this i inspired to talk
[1:30:02] to this person i inspired to do that do
[1:30:05] you want to know something you got to go
[1:30:06] back
[1:30:08] you got to run that through god's word
[1:30:10] you got to go back to how the prophet of
[1:30:12] god said you go about it
[1:30:18] i'm not ashamed to follow a man
[1:30:21] especially this man
[1:30:27] because everything i've seen in the last
[1:30:29] 72 years has failed
[1:30:35] i've seen ministry and interpretations
[1:30:38] and people flow
[1:30:40] down the river of time
[1:30:42] like
[1:30:43] like everything
[1:30:45] and every time you go back to their
[1:30:48] demise is they built on an inspiration
[1:30:51] they built on a revelation that got pie
[1:30:54] in the sky
[1:30:59] one fella was out in the water one day
[1:31:01] and the sun clouds broke and a beam of
[1:31:03] light come down on him and he had this
[1:31:06] thought and he built everything on that
[1:31:08] thought and he went and led hundreds and
[1:31:10] hundreds of people
[1:31:12] into a interpretation of the seals book
[1:31:17] and it was never
[1:31:18] based
[1:31:20] on the word
[1:31:22] it was based on experience it was based
[1:31:24] on an inspiration it was based on
[1:31:26] and then they preached that inspiration
[1:31:29] inspiration is inspiring
[1:31:35] i know people
[1:31:36] that if i would allow in this pulpit
[1:31:39] they could come and inspire you and
[1:31:41] you'd all sign up for amway
[1:31:49] they would convince you
[1:31:52] that you could do more for god
[1:31:56] if you were a part of amway
[1:31:58] and you weren't lazy and someone could
[1:32:01] provide you a way to do something for
[1:32:03] god just by simply talking to your
[1:32:07] neighbor
[1:32:10] not only could you build the church
[1:32:13] you could share the gospel
[1:32:16] and you'd be signing up for amway
[1:32:20] the trouble is
[1:32:22] amway ain't the way god provided to
[1:32:24] preach the gospel
[1:32:26] television
[1:32:28] isn't the way that god provided to
[1:32:31] preach the gospel
[1:32:37] oh there's people that want to get a
[1:32:38] television show
[1:32:42] because what's not happening
[1:32:45] they're not understanding
[1:32:49] that they've got to consult new songs
[1:32:52] new music new games you know a lot of
[1:32:55] the stuff that goes on of the mixing of
[1:32:58] the boys and girls
[1:33:02] now we're getting mixed volleyball games
[1:33:04] mixed softball game mix this mix that
[1:33:06] you know there's a lot of reason there's
[1:33:08] separation
[1:33:11] you know there's a lot of compromising
[1:33:13] situations in certain things
[1:33:19] you know and
[1:33:20] i'm not i i don't want to become a high
[1:33:23] priest
[1:33:25] where i'm the interpreter of the law
[1:33:30] you know i think i think there's a lot
[1:33:32] of things that you you can do
[1:33:37] consult your mothers
[1:33:39] consult the other
[1:33:41] the elderly sisters
[1:33:43] and when i say this i don't mean elders
[1:33:45] like elderly because i'm going to say
[1:33:47] consult sister leslie if you don't
[1:33:51] know how to dress or if something's
[1:33:53] appropriate or if your shoes are
[1:33:55] appropriate or if your hair
[1:33:58] produce appropriate
[1:34:01] you know what i mean and and
[1:34:03] and there's a a lot of things that are
[1:34:06] starting to go on
[1:34:10] because
[1:34:11] we're failing to go back
[1:34:14] and run things through the abcs
[1:34:19] you know hair plating
[1:34:22] is starting to become a thing you know
[1:34:23] what plaque thing is it's where they
[1:34:25] weave things into their hair
[1:34:27] and and different
[1:34:29] ornaments and different gold and things
[1:34:32] and they start weaving them in their
[1:34:34] hair nobody says it almost doesn't
[1:34:36] matter anything this is a new generation
[1:34:39] this is a young generation you know they
[1:34:42] we do all those things
[1:34:45] i don't want the new generation
[1:34:52] it's too late for me to be popular
[1:34:55] i'm going to face the judgment
[1:34:59] that what he said
[1:35:02] it's too late for those things
[1:35:05] they they don't recognize
[1:35:08] they they don't recognize the hour that
[1:35:10] we've
[1:35:12] we've passed that
[1:35:13] already
[1:35:15] do you know what a community
[1:35:17] what they what our room it's not time
[1:35:20] for these things
[1:35:22] that they're talking about
[1:35:24] they may have been okay
[1:35:27] but not now
[1:35:31] so we're talking about going forward and
[1:35:33] i'm just closing with just a review
[1:35:37] of some of the things that he said
[1:35:39] so
[1:35:43] you know if it's anchored down
[1:35:45] in our hearts real good
[1:35:48] god is sovereign
[1:35:52] and we see this is paragraph 29 reading
[1:35:54] it again
[1:35:56] god is sovereign
[1:35:58] and we see here what david done
[1:36:02] in the scripture reading in first
[1:36:04] chronicles 13.
[1:36:07] his intentions
[1:36:09] were
[1:36:11] good
[1:36:14] we're not governed by what
[1:36:17] intentions
[1:36:20] now someone might have a good intention
[1:36:22] and everybody wants to jump on board but
[1:36:25] listen what he said
[1:36:27] but god does not give merit
[1:36:30] on good
[1:36:32] intentions
[1:36:34] there's only one way to serve god
[1:36:38] that's by doing his will and his
[1:36:41] commandments
[1:36:43] command and his
[1:36:46] by doing his
[1:36:48] there's only one way to serve god that's
[1:36:51] by doing his will
[1:36:53] at
[1:36:54] his command
[1:36:57] in other words doing his will the way he
[1:37:01] commands it to be done
[1:37:06] you know there's a way to correct
[1:37:07] somebody in the scripture
[1:37:11] you go to them in private
[1:37:13] you pray first
[1:37:16] you remove the beam
[1:37:19] right you regard what he's doing as a
[1:37:22] sliver
[1:37:23] as a minor thing
[1:37:25] you go to him not to condemn him
[1:37:29] but to draw him out of the flames
[1:37:32] to catch him you go in the right spirit
[1:37:34] and if he don't come then you go take
[1:37:38] somebody else with you
[1:37:43] love hides a multitude of sin
[1:37:46] okay he said
[1:37:49] and god being sovereign
[1:37:53] there's no one to tell him what to do or
[1:37:57] how to do it
[1:37:59] he does it the way
[1:38:01] he knows the right way to do it
[1:38:06] and that makes me
[1:38:08] feel good
[1:38:09] and it ought to make all of us feel good
[1:38:13] and i'm sure it does
[1:38:15] for one would have it
[1:38:18] coming in this way
[1:38:21] and one would have it going that way
[1:38:24] and one going that way and the other way
[1:38:28] in other words what kind of mess we
[1:38:30] would be in if god wasn't sovereign and
[1:38:34] didn't have a way to do things
[1:38:40] and then what would draw us off
[1:38:45] i'm telling you when some of the
[1:38:46] doctrines that's come around in here
[1:38:49] they were running the walls they were
[1:38:51] praising god they were shouting it was
[1:38:54] the greatest thing the rapture was going
[1:38:56] to happen in the morning
[1:39:00] but nobody ever went back and found out
[1:39:02] what the prophet of god said about it
[1:39:09] and the scriptures family states study
[1:39:12] to show yourself approved
[1:39:15] find out what brother branham said about
[1:39:17] it don't just go because the crowd's
[1:39:20] going that way that that's you've got to
[1:39:23] be careful that you don't come under
[1:39:25] my influence
[1:39:28] because
[1:39:29] i'm just as fleshly as anybody
[1:39:32] and and you know the only benefit i have
[1:39:35] is that god's obligated to you somewhere
[1:39:38] down the line to correct me and get me
[1:39:42] straight
[1:39:43] if you're praying for me
[1:39:46] if you're filtering it
[1:39:49] if you read something in one of these
[1:39:51] books or you listen to a tape and you've
[1:39:53] studied a message or you read it and you
[1:39:55] find out my goodness brother david said
[1:39:57] just the opposite
[1:40:00] and you hold me up in prayer and say
[1:40:02] lord make this right
[1:40:07] or you come to me and say brother what
[1:40:09] does that say about that
[1:40:11] and the light bulb goes off in my heart
[1:40:13] it says oh i was leaning too much on
[1:40:15] this and now here this puts it in
[1:40:18] balance
[1:40:20] and then we can come forward
[1:40:22] but you understand the importance when i
[1:40:25] say the word
[1:40:28] i just don't mean this
[1:40:30] the bible
[1:40:33] this kills
[1:40:35] but the living spirit
[1:40:39] right everybody read the same bible
[1:40:42] but there was a living spirit that came
[1:40:45] out of the bible and spoke
[1:40:49] the portion of that word
[1:40:53] that was revealed
[1:40:55] to our day
[1:40:56] right we understand that
[1:40:59] all right so he said
[1:41:01] he says
[1:41:03] he knows the right way and that makes me
[1:41:05] feel good now we go down and jump here
[1:41:08] he said and another thing
[1:41:11] paragraph 32 and another thing david
[1:41:13] here we see
[1:41:15] that in his heart he wanted to do
[1:41:19] something that was
[1:41:21] good
[1:41:24] so this is not guidance
[1:41:26] for sinners
[1:41:30] this is guidance for people that want to
[1:41:32] do something for god
[1:41:35] how many of us came out of camp wanting
[1:41:37] to do something for god
[1:41:39] how many of us came out of camp wanting
[1:41:40] to live better how many came out of con
[1:41:43] camp inspired and with revelation
[1:41:47] now
[1:41:48] we want to take that
[1:41:50] and totally understand
[1:41:52] god's got a way for me to do what's on
[1:41:56] my heart
[1:41:57] god's got a way for me to testify god's
[1:42:00] got a way for me to live god's got a way
[1:42:02] for me to confront my someone that's
[1:42:05] done me wrong god's got a way for me to
[1:42:07] make things right
[1:42:08] god's got a way he knows the way let's
[1:42:11] consult him and seek out the answer
[1:42:17] and do it his way
[1:42:21] i've seen it a lot of times where people
[1:42:22] get the idea to confess your faults one
[1:42:25] to another and a whole congregation will
[1:42:27] get worked out and the people start
[1:42:29] standing up in church confessing his
[1:42:31] fault
[1:42:32] it's not the way god does things
[1:42:36] and they've got a whole church hating
[1:42:38] each other by the end of service
[1:42:40] because everybody spilled the dirt
[1:42:42] on everybody
[1:42:49] i'm telling you
[1:42:50] inspiration and revelation can lead you
[1:42:54] into a lot of places you don't belong if
[1:42:58] you don't learn to govern it by the word
[1:43:02] he says now let's listen here in
[1:43:04] paragraph 35
[1:43:06] well then
[1:43:07] in them days they had only one meeting
[1:43:10] place where they could meet god and that
[1:43:13] was
[1:43:14] was the ark
[1:43:15] under the blood that's the only meeting
[1:43:17] place
[1:43:18] is under the blood the mercy seat was
[1:43:21] sprinkled to give mercy and to the
[1:43:23] worshiper
[1:43:24] to
[1:43:26] the asker when he come to petition god
[1:43:30] and god had a special routine
[1:43:32] the way it had to go
[1:43:35] about that
[1:43:36] he wouldn't accept anything else he
[1:43:39] wouldn't accept any other provision just
[1:43:42] the way he fixed it
[1:43:46] so
[1:43:47] that in that day that was their
[1:43:48] provision they had a certain way of
[1:43:50] doing things
[1:43:51] god's never given up the
[1:43:54] right
[1:43:55] to do things his way
[1:43:58] right
[1:43:59] and aren't you glad he's
[1:44:01] revealed to us that
[1:44:04] and that's what we're talking about okay
[1:44:06] and and he says here he says now notice
[1:44:09] in paragraph 39
[1:44:12] we notice god revealed his word
[1:44:14] in his own predestinated season
[1:44:18] right he says he reveals it
[1:44:21] in the season because it's seed
[1:44:24] and it grows and matures he reveals
[1:44:29] himself
[1:44:31] just continuing on to 46. like in the
[1:44:34] heat of the sun it opened up and when
[1:44:37] it's tender young
[1:44:39] and bring it out of the ground
[1:44:42] the seed then give its
[1:44:45] leaves
[1:44:47] in another stage of the sun the hot sun
[1:44:50] would kill it if it's the ripening seed
[1:44:53] or ripening time he regulates the sun
[1:44:57] and regulates nature
[1:44:59] to meet his word he regulates the church
[1:45:08] the
[1:45:09] predestinated bride
[1:45:11] to meet
[1:45:13] the season
[1:45:14] that they're living in
[1:45:22] i mean these things are fabulous
[1:45:25] fabulous what the things he's saying
[1:45:28] in other words we think man it's a fire
[1:45:31] you know
[1:45:32] he regulates it
[1:45:34] he's got the season regulated
[1:45:38] he knows just how much sun to apply
[1:45:42] he knows how much inspiration to give
[1:45:44] you because you're still growing you're
[1:45:47] still maturing
[1:45:50] he gives you a place where you have a
[1:45:52] counselor a prince of peace a mighty god
[1:45:57] he's got all this beautiful things
[1:46:00] laid out for us but just think of that
[1:46:02] isn't that a beautiful statement
[1:46:05] he says
[1:46:06] he regulates
[1:46:08] the church
[1:46:10] in other words he hasn't taken his hand
[1:46:13] off her
[1:46:14] he hasn't taken control
[1:46:16] inspiration in revelation is not a
[1:46:20] ticket
[1:46:22] to run out on your own
[1:46:27] it's got to be back brought back through
[1:46:30] the word
[1:46:31] now you take that revelation
[1:46:35] and that inspiration
[1:46:38] and you put the word to it
[1:46:41] now you've got a weapon
[1:46:43] buddy because you're standing on a
[1:46:45] promise
[1:46:49] isn't that right
[1:46:51] like healing
[1:46:55] are you healed when you have no more
[1:46:57] symptoms
[1:47:00] are you healed when you're not sick
[1:47:02] anymore
[1:47:04] why are you healed
[1:47:08] you're healed because it's written
[1:47:15] it's written
[1:47:16] by his stripes we are healed
[1:47:19] it's written
[1:47:20] so what's your evidence that you've been
[1:47:23] healed
[1:47:26] the evidence is that he took the stripes
[1:47:30] right
[1:47:31] he was striped he was beaten right he
[1:47:34] was whipped was he not
[1:47:38] why did god allow that for him to be
[1:47:40] whooped
[1:47:42] or beaten
[1:47:43] or scourged the bible calls it for one
[1:47:46] reason only
[1:47:47] that you
[1:47:49] could be healed
[1:47:52] your evidence of healing
[1:47:54] is that the scourging took place
[1:47:57] and it is written
[1:47:59] therefore it's an evidence
[1:48:03] of things you're hoping for
[1:48:05] that you haven't seen
[1:48:08] how do you know you're healed brother
[1:48:10] david you're still sick
[1:48:18] how do you how do you know you're i
[1:48:20] don't i i'm not i know i'm healed
[1:48:25] because it's written
[1:48:27] by his stripes i haven't seen it yet
[1:48:30] true
[1:48:31] and i'm hoping for it true but i have an
[1:48:34] evidence
[1:48:36] that it's coming
[1:48:39] the fact that it's here or not here
[1:48:42] does not change the fact that he was
[1:48:45] scourged that's history
[1:48:48] and he was only scourged for one reason
[1:48:51] was that you could be healed
[1:48:53] and the story
[1:48:55] simple
[1:48:56] it is written
[1:48:59] it is written
[1:49:00] that
[1:49:01] governed jesus
[1:49:06] was he hungry yes
[1:49:09] could he be a stone
[1:49:11] turn
[1:49:12] stones into bread
[1:49:14] yes
[1:49:15] could he have cast them stuff down from
[1:49:18] the temple yes
[1:49:22] but what was he governed by
[1:49:25] the word
[1:49:26] how did he respond
[1:49:28] it
[1:49:29] is written
[1:49:32] so when you get an inspiration
[1:49:36] and you get an in revelation
[1:49:39] take it back to what is written
[1:49:43] then you can say it is written when he
[1:49:46] came up talking to those guys he says
[1:49:48] wasn't it written that the son of man
[1:49:50] must suffer and then in three days rise
[1:49:53] up isn't it what written
[1:50:00] isn't it written
[1:50:02] why do you think there's 1100 tapes
[1:50:06] why do you think they're stored up
[1:50:08] why do you think they're preached the
[1:50:10] way they preached and the order they're
[1:50:12] preached in and how they're so full of
[1:50:14] nuggets
[1:50:15] so we can go
[1:50:18] and the spirit searcheth
[1:50:21] the deep
[1:50:22] things even the deep things of god
[1:50:25] so we can find
[1:50:27] where it is
[1:50:29] written
[1:50:30] paul told then he study the to show
[1:50:33] thyself the proof find out what the word
[1:50:36] says about it the inspiration's
[1:50:39] wonderful
[1:50:40] the revelation is wonderful but it's got
[1:50:44] to be meticulously
[1:50:46] carried out according
[1:50:48] to god's word
[1:50:50] and that's what he says here
[1:50:52] he says
[1:50:56] he and then this again and
[1:51:00] 42
[1:51:01] now he reveals his word only in its
[1:51:04] season
[1:51:06] martin luther read the same bible we did
[1:51:08] wesley read the same bible martin luther
[1:51:10] did pentecostal reads the same bible
[1:51:13] re-read jesus read the same bible that
[1:51:16] the pharisees read but they had trying
[1:51:19] to keep the corn in the early stage when
[1:51:23] it was ripening
[1:51:25] they failed to see their hour
[1:51:30] let's don't keep cap
[1:51:33] in the early stage as the prophet of god
[1:51:36] recalled it of the cycle of revival
[1:51:41] and then another revival
[1:51:43] and then next year
[1:51:45] another revival
[1:51:49] you who got prayed for you should never
[1:51:52] have to go in that type of prayer line
[1:51:55] again
[1:51:58] not if you know how to go forward in
[1:52:00] god's word
[1:52:02] you accept what he did for you he
[1:52:04] separated me he freed me i'm here now at
[1:52:09] this meeting i'm here in every church
[1:52:11] service to hear god's word to make
[1:52:13] intercessions for those who don't have
[1:52:16] his word to pray that the spirit of god
[1:52:18] will fall on somebody who doesn't have
[1:52:20] it but i know that my footsteps are led
[1:52:24] by the lord
[1:52:25] how does he lead
[1:52:27] by his
[1:52:29] word
[1:52:31] he says and so we don't want to be held
[1:52:34] back in early stages
[1:52:38] we want to grow as a church
[1:52:40] we want to mature i'm not going to be
[1:52:42] here sunday so you're getting sunday
[1:52:44] whether you like it or not
[1:52:47] i'm just
[1:52:48] sorry i'm the way i am
[1:52:51] who is it that will dare to correct him
[1:52:54] say now lord you meant you made a
[1:52:57] mistake by putting this man in the
[1:52:59] ministry
[1:53:02] that's one of my favorite quotes
[1:53:08] this man doesn't believe like we believe
[1:53:13] who's going to tell god he's wrong in it
[1:53:17] it would take somebody that's a little
[1:53:20] more
[1:53:21] uh
[1:53:22] how they say
[1:53:24] it's going to take somebody that's a
[1:53:25] little more of a
[1:53:27] a delinquent than i am to tell him that
[1:53:31] he knows what he's doing
[1:53:35] he knows whom to choose and whom not to
[1:53:39] choose
[1:53:40] what to do and what not to do no matter
[1:53:44] how much we think that a certain person
[1:53:47] is qualified
[1:53:49] to do a certain job god knows who's
[1:53:52] qualified for the time
[1:53:55] and the season
[1:53:57] or the time
[1:53:59] and the right time
[1:54:01] to do it
[1:54:02] you know he's leading up to the five
[1:54:04] must
[1:54:08] a real christian a true believer in god
[1:54:11] waits upon the lord for
[1:54:14] these things
[1:54:18] wait on your ministry
[1:54:20] if you feel a call
[1:54:22] be sure that it's god
[1:54:25] be sure
[1:54:26] that it's right
[1:54:28] and be sure it's timely
[1:54:31] of what you're saying
[1:54:35] and
[1:54:38] we've
[1:54:40] that's a good place
[1:54:43] to stop
[1:54:45] there's a lot of preachers a lot of
[1:54:48] people preaching
[1:54:50] but their message isn't timely
[1:54:56] it's true
[1:54:58] but he what did he say make sure that
[1:55:00] your message matches up with the time
[1:55:04] that is what god's trying to tell the
[1:55:06] church
[1:55:07] how would you like if i took the next
[1:55:09] year preaching malachi 4 5
[1:55:13] there's a promise of a prophet there's a
[1:55:15] promise of restoration
[1:55:25] we're moving
[1:55:27] god's moving
[1:55:29] he's bringing people in
[1:55:31] but we can't let people come in with
[1:55:33] inspiration and revelation and let them
[1:55:36] change the basic fundamental truth of
[1:55:39] the message of the hour and the way
[1:55:41] things are conducted according to god's
[1:55:43] word
[1:55:48] and don't get mad at me if you think
[1:55:51] that i'm throwing a bucket of flames on
[1:55:53] somebody that seems to be on fire
[1:56:00] because i know something about god
[1:56:03] i don't know a lot
[1:56:05] but from experience i know that god will
[1:56:08] line you up with his word
[1:56:10] and it's hard to kick against the prick
[1:56:14] and the harder you fight
[1:56:16] the harder he squeezes
[1:56:19] and he'll take the breath out of you
[1:56:22] if you're his
[1:56:26] he stopped an airplane to get a prophet
[1:56:29] to a woman
[1:56:30] standing on a fence
[1:56:34] he'll do whatever it takes for you
[1:56:38] but he's never going to do one thing
[1:56:41] outside his word
[1:56:44] and this isn't on tape that i know of it
[1:56:47] it's all on tape in different ways
[1:56:50] but my friend has gone on to be with the
[1:56:52] lord doug mccues shared it with me
[1:56:55] he said brother david brother ben told
[1:56:57] me this personally
[1:56:59] he said brother doug i don't care
[1:57:02] how much you how much you fast you can
[1:57:06] fast tell your skin and bones
[1:57:08] i don't care how much you holler
[1:57:11] you can holler till you have no voice
[1:57:14] i don't care
[1:57:15] how much you pray you can pray and cry
[1:57:19] till there's not another tear in your
[1:57:22] eye
[1:57:24] he says i don't care how much you do
[1:57:27] god's only going to do for you
[1:57:30] what he said
[1:57:33] you're going to do for you
[1:57:36] don't ask god to change his mind about
[1:57:39] the word
[1:57:41] let's ask god to reveal his word so we
[1:57:45] can do it his way
[1:57:48] i think god's moving
[1:57:51] i think we're going to encounter a lot
[1:57:53] of new believers
[1:57:55] that don't understand everything
[1:57:57] that are going to inject all kinds of
[1:58:00] their ideas all kinds of the ways that
[1:58:03] they would do things all their
[1:58:05] inspirations all their revelations all
[1:58:08] the things that they're seeing
[1:58:11] i'm happy for that
[1:58:14] but if you've got an absolute
[1:58:17] you're not moved by the inspiration
[1:58:20] you're not moved by the revelation
[1:58:22] because all inspiration
[1:58:25] and revelation
[1:58:27] must be governed
[1:58:29] by god's word
[1:58:31] it's a great message to listen to
[1:58:33] but i just i really wanted to share that
[1:58:35] with you that have come out and that are
[1:58:38] moving forward in the lord especially a
[1:58:41] young christian i wish that i could have
[1:58:44] got associated
[1:58:46] with the understanding of what it meant
[1:58:49] to have the messenger of the hour
[1:58:52] to be my consultant and all things a lot
[1:58:56] earlier
[1:58:57] in my experience
[1:59:00] it would have saved me a lot of dumb
[1:59:02] things
[1:59:03] that i did that i really thought were
[1:59:07] super
[1:59:09] and i thought i was saving the world
[1:59:12] and i was spinning my wheels and wasting
[1:59:15] time and one
[1:59:17] example
[1:59:18] or one instruction from the messenger
[1:59:23] straightened me out
[1:59:25] and
[1:59:26] we all have equal access
[1:59:32] and it doesn't change for me
[1:59:34] or for you
[1:59:36] it's all the same
[1:59:39] god's sovereign he does it his way let's
[1:59:42] find that way
[1:59:43] let's do it his way
[1:59:45] and you'll be successful
[1:59:47] in your inspiration you'll be successful
[1:59:51] in your revelations you'll be successful
[1:59:54] in your intentions
[1:59:57] you'll be successful but when you create
[1:59:59] a program for yourself
[2:00:02] and you imagine the outcome
[2:00:05] is going to be a certain way
[2:00:09] and you don't filter it back through
[2:00:11] god's word you'll find out it never
[2:00:14] turns out the way you thought it would
[2:00:17] it always turns out the way god's word
[2:00:21] said it would
[2:00:22] god bless you keep me in prayers i go
[2:00:24] see your mom i cover your prayer
[2:00:28] the brothers just well
[2:00:30] i'm trusting that we'll have this back
[2:00:33] part of the parking lot open sunday
[2:00:35] and
[2:00:36] we've they've already talked to you
[2:00:37] about some people parking down the
[2:00:40] street
[2:00:41] just be real careful to listen to the
[2:00:44] instructions of the deacons follow their
[2:00:46] instructions
[2:00:47] even if you don't think it's right if
[2:00:50] you have a complaint come to me
[2:00:53] and if i think your complaint is just or
[2:00:56] i like you i'll write you up
