[37:56] amen
[37:57] praise the lord how many is feeling good
[37:59] tonight
[38:00] praise the lord
[38:03] well if you have your bibles
[38:06] just see what the lord has for us
[38:07] tonight
[38:10] i'm excited about
[38:14] we turn in our bibles to romans chapter
[38:16] 10.
[38:24] i certainly appreciate the songs it
[38:28] definitely has created an atmosphere
[38:36] romans chapter 10
[38:39] we'll just start there in verse 1. we'll
[38:41] read a little bit of scripture here it
[38:42] says
[38:44] brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[38:47] god
[38:48] for israel is that they might be saved
[38:52] for i for israel is that they might be
[38:55] saved
[38:57] for i bear them record that they have
[39:00] a zeal of god
[39:02] but not according to knowledge
[39:04] for they being ignorant of god's
[39:06] righteousness
[39:08] and going about to establish their own
[39:10] righteousness
[39:12] have not submitted themselves unto the
[39:14] righteousness of god
[39:17] for christ is not for
[39:19] christ is the end of the law for
[39:22] righteousness to everyone that believeth
[39:25] for moses described the righteousness
[39:28] which is of the law
[39:30] that the man which doeth these things
[39:32] shall live by them
[39:34] but the righteousness which is of faith
[39:36] speaketh on this wise
[39:39] say not in thine heart
[39:42] notice where it is saying it
[39:44] say not in thine heart who shall ascend
[39:48] unto heaven that is to bring christ down
[39:51] from above
[39:52] or who shall descend into the depths
[39:55] that is to bring up christ again from
[39:58] the dead
[39:59] but what saith it
[40:01] the word is nigh thee
[40:03] even in thy mouth
[40:05] and in thine heart and that is the word
[40:08] of faith which we preach amen you may
[40:10] have your seed
[40:14] that if thou shalt confess
[40:18] with thy mouth the lord jesus
[40:22] and shall
[40:24] believe in thine heart
[40:27] that god hath raised him from the dead
[40:30] thou shall be saved
[40:33] amen what a what a simple formula
[40:35] amen aren't you thankful that you have a
[40:38] heart to believe the simple
[40:42] for from the heart man believeth unto
[40:45] righteousness
[40:46] and with
[40:48] the mouth confession is made unto
[40:51] salvation
[40:52] for the scripture saith
[40:54] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[40:57] ashamed
[40:59] praise the lord
[41:02] ain't that wonderful that you believe
[41:03] this report i'm
[41:06] you know i just think about the
[41:08] realities
[41:10] you know sometimes
[41:12] when you look in the mirror you look at
[41:13] yourself and you just think
[41:15] you know
[41:17] i'm a christian you know and the
[41:20] scripture is saying
[41:21] that
[41:22] the word is nighty even in thy heart and
[41:26] in thy mouth
[41:27] you know it's interesting you know
[41:30] you've heard comments like
[41:32] you haven't seen me you know you haven't
[41:35] really seen me you've seen the shell
[41:37] you've seen
[41:38] what appears to be
[41:40] me
[41:41] but really who you are is what god made
[41:45] you in your heart amen
[41:47] and so i think it's sometimes as we've
[41:50] gotten a great
[41:51] uh uh admonition and maybe i'll just um
[41:56] you know
[41:57] let you know what what i'm gonna be
[41:59] speaking tonight which
[42:02] i'm thinking about
[42:04] the original production
[42:07] of the word
[42:10] so so from the heart
[42:12] this word
[42:14] the word is not the letter
[42:17] right yeah the the word
[42:19] helps wash the amnesia but who you are
[42:22] is the word
[42:24] and the word that's in your heart is
[42:26] desiring to be expressed in your flesh
[42:32] and and you know i think it's an
[42:33] interesting time you know we realize
[42:36] there's the human factor
[42:38] that we all must battle
[42:41] it's always getting in god's way amen
[42:47] but i think it's a great paradox
[42:50] when when somebody recognizes
[42:53] i don't have what it takes to be a
[42:55] christian
[42:57] but because i've heard this word of
[43:00] promise that he's planted something in
[43:02] my heart
[43:04] we'll call it a seed
[43:06] it's a seed of himself
[43:08] amen
[43:10] and that seed has the potential to
[43:12] manifest
[43:13] every tree
[43:16] that was in it it has all the same
[43:18] potentials if it's an apple seed it can
[43:21] produce as many apples as it's been
[43:23] ordained to produce amen and if the the
[43:26] the scripture says
[43:28] i have planted it now water it day and
[43:31] night let someone pluck it from my hands
[43:34] isn't that wonderful that we have this
[43:36] kind of promise that you can't fail
[43:39] because this is this is a predestinated
[43:42] plan of god
[43:44] but yet
[43:45] now
[43:46] there's a reward to be had
[43:48] see god's not what we would say to give
[43:52] one day and take it back so you don't
[43:54] have to worry once you've accepted the
[43:57] blood
[43:58] once you've been cleansed and you've
[44:00] invited him into your heart
[44:02] and he's quickened you he's brought you
[44:04] to life you don't have to worry that
[44:06] you're going to be lost because you got
[44:08] this human
[44:10] factor you're packing
[44:12] and it
[44:13] tries to trip you up
[44:15] and it's got a will
[44:17] it's got desires
[44:20] amen but we're thinking of
[44:23] producing the
[44:24] being a production see is this is not a
[44:27] workup amen you don't have to worry
[44:31] about the seed beer
[44:34] all it needs is moisture all it needs is
[44:36] light all it needs is nourishment amen
[44:40] and to think that god has planted a seed
[44:42] in you
[44:44] and he's giving you the
[44:46] the job
[44:48] to cultivate your garden amen
[44:51] you have the ability to water it with
[44:53] praise amen i thank you god that you
[44:56] saved me from myself you saved me from a
[44:59] life of just selfishness taking all of
[45:02] the blessings of god and just living my
[45:05] own life doing my own thing
[45:08] not even worrying about my neighbor
[45:10] or what his needs are no
[45:13] no
[45:15] now that seed the potentials is to bring
[45:18] a production of himself amen
[45:21] ain't that wonderful you've been chosen
[45:23] for this job
[45:25] hallelujah
[45:28] i just think about that seed and you
[45:32] know the word is nighty even in thy
[45:35] mouth you know
[45:37] and even in thy heart you know sometimes
[45:40] based on the the
[45:42] the message that we were listening to
[45:46] this weekend
[45:48] you know
[45:49] recognizing your day and its message
[45:52] you know i feel
[45:53] you know there was a statement in there
[45:56] about you know it's it's a time
[45:59] that we examine ourselves
[46:01] you know what what what nature
[46:04] is coming out of my heart
[46:06] well
[46:07] like this is an hour
[46:09] you know when when we recognize the time
[46:12] that we're living in the day in its
[46:15] condition
[46:16] you know there's something that paul
[46:18] says in the heart that says you know i
[46:20] see that god has manifested these
[46:23] supernatural vindications of the
[46:25] scripture
[46:26] about the the time
[46:29] engine or your job or or
[46:32] what you're facing is more valuable than
[46:34] stealing away and walking with him a
[46:37] while
[46:38] hunting out those great nuggets or are
[46:41] we just waiting for the preacher to go
[46:43] or the pastor to go or the teacher to go
[46:46] or the youth leader or the deacon or the
[46:49] trustee are they supposed to do their
[46:50] job
[46:52] well
[46:53] there's things that you each one of you
[46:57] you have a responsibility to the body
[47:00] and we cannot
[47:02] we must find our post of duty and serve
[47:04] it with all of our heart that's the only
[47:06] way that will be satisfied that's the
[47:09] only way that we'll receive a whole
[47:11] heart
[47:12] right just surrender dying out saying
[47:15] god not my will but thine be done
[47:19] oh
[47:21] when you we come to that place where
[47:23] we're yielded and god can take full
[47:25] preeminence full control full sway
[47:28] god you're on the throne of
[47:30] it's no longer reasoning and doubt
[47:33] mixing
[47:34] with what's in my heart amen
[47:37] is that your heart's desire
[47:41] the wonderful thing about it is
[47:43] you acknowledging it god planted it
[47:45] there
[47:46] my you're such a privileged people that
[47:48] god would plant a will
[47:50] his will in your heart
[47:52] that you would want to do it
[47:55] oh
[47:56] my
[47:57] i never was flat on my back and i i
[48:00] tried
[48:02] to run
[48:03] haven't you tried to run
[48:09] i can identify in one way with paul
[48:12] about
[48:13] it's hard for you to kick against the
[48:14] pricks
[48:17] brother brahms said
[48:18] sometimes you'll have to end up flat on
[48:20] your back
[48:22] and that's that's my testimony what it
[48:24] is
[48:29] then you become part of it
[48:31] oh my
[48:33] oh my there's power
[48:35] in receiving the word of god
[48:38] to to hear a word and let it come into
[48:41] your mind
[48:43] and the power of the word
[48:45] can transform the seed and make it live
[48:49] amen that's a reality
[48:52] you become part of it
[48:54] it's the
[48:56] it's only his word that he'll raise up
[49:00] as he did his word on the first easter
[49:02] morning
[49:03] only
[49:05] his word come forth and those who died
[49:09] in his word
[49:11] believe his word and vindicate his word
[49:14] amen now notice now that
[49:17] it's been 2700 years ago notice they're
[49:21] scattered they are blinded and they and
[49:23] speaking of the jews
[49:26] they were scattered they were blinded
[49:28] and he's referring back to hosea 6. if
[49:30] you want to you can go back and read it
[49:32] but
[49:32] it was it's prophecy
[49:34] and we're seeing it come to pass
[49:38] it's already been and now we're we're a
[49:40] part of the revival oh my
[49:42] woo
[49:44] i i mean i get excited forgive me i
[49:48] i'm telling you what we got something to
[49:50] be excited about
[49:52] the living god the creator of heavens
[49:55] and earth is dwelling in human temples
[49:59] that have been sanctified by his blood
[50:02] oh my
[50:04] to be yoked with him
[50:06] he said take my yoke upon you
[50:09] my burden is easy
[50:12] he's meek and lonely and hard
[50:15] oh you have that potential
[50:20] christ let it live in me
[50:28] scattered they were blinded
[50:30] now
[50:31] they've got to be dead
[50:33] and the gentiles are called out the
[50:35] bride is ready the rapture is at hand
[50:37] can we realize that can we actually
[50:41] believe that
[50:42] is it a story that's been told is it a
[50:45] myth to us
[50:47] is it something that sounds real
[50:50] is it something that
[50:52] we outside can believe can we believe it
[50:55] outside
[50:57] my
[50:58] personalize it tonight
[51:00] or is it something that's in us
[51:04] that's part of us that's more than life
[51:06] to us
[51:07] i think it's a sobering hour to examine
[51:09] ourselves have my affections been so
[51:12] pulled away from what god has
[51:15] what he's doing now
[51:17] that's one of the traps is look what god
[51:19] did oh look at what he did in brother
[51:20] branham's ministry look what he did back
[51:22] there in christ in his ministry but he
[51:25] says the works that i do shall you do
[51:27] also and greater works
[51:30] we're going to need faith to go to work
[51:34] we're going to be needing to be so
[51:35] surrendered
[51:37] and believing from the heart god is
[51:39] producing the original again
[51:50] god is it real
[51:52] amen
[51:55] what is
[51:58] what attitude do we set this morning in
[52:01] the tabernacle
[52:03] remember
[52:04] it'll be a small flock that receives it
[52:07] amen praise the lord
[52:09] little flock fear not it's your father's
[52:12] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[52:13] amen
[52:15] what a paradox that we can be so yielded
[52:18] and so surrendered that god could come
[52:21] in a little
[52:23] tiny simple stable like your
[52:26] heart like the manger like the song says
[52:28] let it be in me the manger of my heart
[52:31] let your word
[52:33] tell the same story it's always told
[52:36] that you're a god that cares for the
[52:38] unlovable is that what he did in your
[52:41] life
[52:42] can the very christ that came to you and
[52:44] revealed all to you
[52:46] you're no good
[52:47] you're you were born in sin it's not
[52:50] because you drank and you smoked and all
[52:52] of that it's because you were born
[52:55] through
[52:56] gandhian uh
[53:01] you were born you were condemned by your
[53:04] the origin of your birth
[53:08] and that's why i said you must be born
[53:09] again
[53:11] well how can we be born again i mean
[53:13] should we go back into our mother's womb
[53:19] why
[53:20] sometimes our mind wonders at these
[53:22] things
[53:23] i wonder if this is right i wonder if
[53:25] that's right
[53:28] don't we put that
[53:30] devil on the run tonight
[53:31] god's word is true
[53:34] i know i'm healed because by his stripes
[53:39] i am healed you put your name in it
[53:42] god he paid the ultimate price for me
[53:45] and he's proved it by coming my way
[53:49] and taking the
[53:50] guilt
[53:53] how many how many times did you hear
[53:56] someone testify and they say
[53:59] i've given my heart to the lord
[54:02] and yet their life is just
[54:04] well it just doesn't seem like there's
[54:06] any difference
[54:08] why would someone want to give their
[54:10] heart to the lord
[54:12] why would you want to give your heart to
[54:14] the lord
[54:17] well
[54:18] god desires
[54:20] to have another production amen
[54:23] he has spoken a bride
[54:26] that's going to come into manifestation
[54:29] he's already
[54:30] seen the view
[54:34] amen
[54:35] i believe that you're her
[54:37] amen
[54:40] praise the lord you know when you think
[54:42] about
[54:43] giving your heart to the lord
[54:45] you know i think that our testimony when
[54:48] we gave our heart to the lord is a great
[54:50] witness
[54:52] and you know we speak from experience
[54:54] you know what the lord's done it's not
[54:58] just from the carnal knowledge of the
[55:00] word
[55:02] and we're also identified in god
[55:04] fulfilling coming behind that truth and
[55:06] making it live so i say well since i've
[55:09] given my heart to the lord he's actually
[55:11] done things for me that i couldn't do
[55:13] for myself
[55:14] i realized that there was a chasm
[55:16] between me and satisfaction in life
[55:22] how many know him as the lily of the
[55:24] valley
[55:26] oh you were crushed by the burden of sin
[55:29] but he says you know what
[55:31] i i went to
[55:33] i conquered it i conquered death
[55:37] i conquered the grave
[55:39] amen
[55:40] there was a grave of sickness i'd been
[55:42] under the oppression of
[55:44] disease from spine injuries and oh it
[55:48] was it was a grave i had i had no hope i
[55:52] could not the doctors could not
[55:55] how many of you have had just like our
[55:57] brother otis that the doctors they don't
[56:00] feel like they have the answer
[56:03] they've gone as far as their book shows
[56:05] but our book has a different report
[56:08] praise god for another report
[56:12] he's the alpha and the omega he's the
[56:15] beginning and the end i believe he has
[56:18] the final save
[56:21] what's in your heart i want to see him
[56:22] worshiping god i love that brother
[56:25] just to see him raise his hands oh i'll
[56:28] just get to rejoicing that's what i
[56:30] think about you
[56:31] when you start stomping the devil
[56:33] getting
[56:34] this formalism
[56:38] i'm going to worship my god cause he's
[56:40] worthy
[56:42] that devil has held me bound too long
[56:46] i'm gonna i'm gonna let some soldiers go
[56:48] to work i realize that i'm i'm facing an
[56:50] enemy that's trying to trying to dodge
[56:53] me trying to make me lukewarm
[56:56] he's sowing doubt in my mind are you are
[56:59] you a christian brother
[57:03] i am what i am by the grace of god
[57:07] you light
[57:09] you know
[57:11] we want to we're we're not we're not
[57:13] shadow boxing
[57:16] we got thus saith the lord
[57:18] you use
[57:19] that word that
[57:21] is in your heart you let it fly out of
[57:23] your mouth with a heart of conviction
[57:26] and watch that great enforcer come that
[57:28] holy spirit
[57:29] and he'll stand at the post sickness
[57:32] be gone in the name of jesus
[57:35] oh my
[57:37] are we gonna take our
[57:38] position are we going to stand in order
[57:41] lord your word is true and i believe it
[57:44] let not one word of promise
[57:47] fall by the wayside
[57:53] it's a sobering hour
[57:56] but praise god
[57:58] god promised that he'd be with you
[58:00] even in you to the very end amen
[58:03] ain't that wonderful
[58:05] well i don't mean to keep you very long
[58:07] just i rejoice in the word of the lord
[58:09] and and we just trust that as we face
[58:12] this great battle
[58:15] the enemy's really trying to make us
[58:17] lukewarm
[58:18] and you know what we need to
[58:20] get some soldiers
[58:22] you know in the greatest battle that's
[58:24] ever fought
[58:26] they they picked a meeting ground and
[58:28] there was going to be a test of strength
[58:30] and you know
[58:32] a lot of times you think oh i think this
[58:34] thought really there's only two powers
[58:37] there's only two
[58:39] there's the power of death and the power
[58:41] of of god in life amen and so
[58:45] when something comes in your mind in a
[58:48] thought realize there's only two origins
[58:52] you know i just think sometimes we're so
[58:54] beat down is because we haven't been
[58:56] into the source of renewing
[58:58] i don't think we've actually entertained
[59:00] angels unaware i don't know if we've
[59:03] really taken the time and recognized the
[59:06] value of cutting away
[59:09] getting alone i'm talking about me i'm
[59:11] preaching to myself
[59:17] but i think it's worth it
[59:20] i think the love affair
[59:21] with christ i mean
[59:23] from the heart you know
[59:25] faith has been restored and we have the
[59:28] substance
[59:30] you know there's a great anticipation
[59:33] that from my heart i cherish i cherish
[59:35] the time when god comes by my way and
[59:38] just speaks
[59:40] a truth
[59:41] with spiritual food and season don't you
[59:43] love that it doesn't just have to be on
[59:45] wednesday and sunday
[59:47] amen it's available
[59:49] lord
[59:51] teach us to pray our father which art in
[59:54] heaven
[59:55] hallowed be thy name
[59:57] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:00:01] on earth as it is in heaven
[1:00:03] give us this day our daily bread
[1:00:07] can we just get back to the abc
[1:00:09] sometimes we just we get going so busy
[1:00:12] so fast and i know the construction and
[1:00:15] all the stuff
[1:00:16] you know we got to keep up but you know
[1:00:18] one thing i realized going through a
[1:00:20] little bit of a a pressure situation i
[1:00:22] realized one of the conditions that are
[1:00:25] upon us that's trying to make us
[1:00:27] lukewarm is those those three pressures
[1:00:30] that he warned us about you know soft
[1:00:32] living the pressures of riches you know
[1:00:35] come on it's i'm not this is not the
[1:00:37] first time you've heard this
[1:00:39] nervous tensions people they don't know
[1:00:42] they're going to and fro trying to
[1:00:44] satisfy what's in their heart
[1:00:46] and they're going and it doesn't satisfy
[1:00:49] but they're going to manifest
[1:00:52] worldlyism but don't get caught up in
[1:00:54] their ways
[1:00:55] take the name of jesus to prayer and ask
[1:00:58] god to speak to you because if you
[1:01:00] commune heart to heart with them
[1:01:03] i give you your heart's desire amen
[1:01:05] don't you want to serve him more
[1:01:07] why don't we stand as we invite the
[1:01:09] musicians

[1:01:22] the word is nighty
[1:01:24] even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:01:28] that is the word of faith which we
[1:01:30] preach
[1:01:31] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:01:33] mouth
[1:01:34] the lord jesus and shall believe in
[1:01:36] thine heart
[1:01:37] that god hath raised him from the dead
[1:01:40] thou shalt be saved
[1:01:42] for with
[1:01:43] the heart man believeth unto
[1:01:45] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:01:48] confession is made unto salvation
