[12:09] to play that, we'll ask brother Andrew
[12:11] [music] to come and just open the
[12:13] service in prayer. Also, if there would
[12:16] be an unspoken prayer request, you just
[12:18] want to [music] make that known by an
[12:20] uplifted hand. We'll ask the brothers uh
[12:23] to come at this time [music] and we'll
[12:24] also take up the tithes and offerings.
[12:28] Amen. It's [music] good to have brother
[12:30] Andrew back and brother Billy back with

[12:39] Amen.
[12:41] So good to be back and be with everyone.
[12:44] How many is expecting to hear from
[12:46] Jesus? I know that's my heart's desire.
[12:48] And [music] to lift up the name of
[12:50] Jesus, the one who set us free, who
[12:52] healed us, who brought us here tonight
[12:55] and has [music] something very special.
[12:56] You know, I think that we just want to
[12:59] shake off those heavy bands and [music]
[13:01] you know, this the expectation for a
[13:03] special meeting, you know, we're [music]
[13:06] able to somehow turn loose of the things
[13:08] of the world and what is was weighing on
[13:10] us. I say if [music] we just can have
[13:13] that same expectation tonight.
[13:16] I believe that God can do great things.
[13:18] Amen.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Let us bind our hearts together for the
[13:21] needs that [music] are upon the loved
[13:23] ones. You've know the request. We've
[13:25] seen the testimony of the young brother
[13:27] that had the all of the skin grafts. Oh,
[13:31] just whatever you have need of, God
[13:33] [music] is able. Let's pray together.
[13:36] Our precious Lord,
[13:39] it's so good Lord to know that you're
[13:42] our father. And Lord, there was
[13:46] one that came and gave all, Lord. And
[13:49] [music] you spilled that blood, Lord,
[13:52] that can make a way for us. Lord, we're
[13:55] [music] so grateful, Lord, tonight that
[13:58] that wasn't the blood of a man, but that
[14:00] was the blood of God that loosed us from
[14:02] sin and the shackles and bondage, Lord,
[14:05] that we can come rejoicing knowing that
[14:07] we've been [music] set free, Father.
[14:10] Lord, here we are here, Lord, in that
[14:12] freedom and that liberty to worship you
[14:15] and to praise your great name, Father.
[14:17] You see the hearts, Lord. You see
[14:20] [music] the need, Lord. We're so
[14:22] under expectation, Lord, as we're
[14:24] binding our hearts together, Lord, for
[14:26] the needs. And Lord, you know the secret
[14:29] thoughts, Lord, that Lord, it's it's
[14:32] [music] a desire that we want to be more
[14:34] like you, Lord. It's it's a desire to
[14:37] live like you lived. And [music] oh God,
[14:40] we pray tonight, Lord, as our hearts are
[14:43] looking to you, Lord, that you'd speak
[14:45] to us, Lord, and that you would make the
[14:47] change, Lord, in our heart that, oh God,
[14:50] we can see you for who you are, Lord.
[14:53] Grant revelation, Lord. Grant a special
[14:56] [music] service tonight, Lord. Use the
[14:58] man of God, use testimonies, songs,
[15:00] Lord. Even hear our prayer, Father. We
[15:02] just pray for our pastor, Lord. I pray
[15:05] you bless him, Lord. And even the tithes
[15:07] and offerings that will be collected
[15:09] here tonight, Lord. We pray that [music]
[15:11] you'd use him, Lord, and may it bring
[15:14] souls to the kingdom. Father, we commit
[15:16] this service from [music] beginning to
[15:17] end, asking you'd be glorified in Jesus
[15:20] Christ's name. Amen.
[15:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. You may have your
[15:25] seats.

[28:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go before him in
[28:29] prayer. [music] Gracious heavenly
[28:31] father, Lord,
[28:33] truly what a fitting song to that which
[28:35] you put on my heart. Lord Jesus,
[28:39] Lord, I pray you spend a [music] little
[28:41] time with us now, Father. Break open
[28:44] your word, Father. Speak to [music] your
[28:46] children, Lord. Something, Lord, that
[28:49] may be a blessing to them. Father, set
[28:52] me aside, Lord Jesus. You be the one
[28:55] that takes control of the [music]
[28:56] vessel. Father, a man could do but so
[28:59] much. Study, put some notes together,
[29:02] [music] think on a subject. Father, but
[29:04] unless you come, Father, you be the amen
[29:06] to what you've allow us to study,
[29:08] Father. Then it's all for nothing,
[29:11] Father. We didn't come here for nothing,
[29:14] Lord. But we've come because you said
[29:16] where two or three are gathered in your
[29:17] midst, you will be there, Lord Jesus. We
[29:20] know who's here. We know who's present,
[29:22] Lord Jesus. Nothing is done in vain if
[29:24] it's done in your name, Lord Jesus.
[29:27] Father, we [music] long to see you,
[29:28] Father, and hear from you. Help us, Lord
[29:32] Jesus.
[29:34] We love you, Lord Jesus. [music] Calm my
[29:35] nerves, Father. We ask this in the
[29:37] precious, mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[29:39] Christ. We're so thankful for having
[29:41] brought [music] Brother Billy back and
[29:42] Brother Andrew, Lord Jesus, from their
[29:44] travels. Father,
[29:47] be with us [music] now. We thank you. We
[29:48] ask this in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:52] Thank you, musicians.
[29:56] While you're standing, we'll just go
[29:57] ahead and read in um Second
[30:00] Thessalonians.
[30:08] We won't be long. I just want to
[30:12] just an anchor
[30:14] this point that struck my heart so much
[30:17] listening to our pastor Sunday morning
[30:19] and brother Matthew preaching Sunday
[30:22] night. I trust we all enjoy the
[30:24] services. It was truly good the choice
[30:27] of faith and
[30:29] uh identified by the pillar of fire.
[30:32] Such a blessing to know what we've been
[30:34] identified with in this hour.
[30:39] It reads uh 2 Thessalonians 1:4-5. So
[30:42] that we ourselves glory in you and the
[30:45] churches of God for your patience and
[30:48] faith in all your persecutions and
[30:50] tribulations that ye endure which is a
[30:54] manifest token of the righteous judgment
[30:56] of God. What is the manifest token of
[30:58] the righteous judgment of God? It's the
[31:01] enduring with patience the persecutions
[31:04] and the tribulations.
[31:06] He says that ye may be counted worthy of
[31:09] the kingdom of God for which ye also
[31:12] suffer. We'll also turn to Hebrews 11:1
[31:15] and2.
[31:18] It reads,
[31:20] "Now faith is the substance of things
[31:22] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[31:25] seen. For by it the elders obtained a
[31:28] good report. May the Lord add a blessing
[31:31] to the reading of his word. You may be
[31:32] seated for a moment.
[31:41] Now I I just love when God takes control
[31:43] of a service, when God takes control of
[31:46] of everything because when when man's
[31:48] got a part to play, he messes it up. So,
[31:51] I'm I'm glad God's in it because
[31:55] you just saying they say this mountain
[31:57] can't be moved.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; They say these chains will never break.
[32:02] But they don't know you like we do.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; There is power in your name.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; See, the only way you can say that is
[32:10] because you had to have first
[32:12] experienced a mountain that they said
[32:14] could not be moved. And then when he
[32:16] moved it, now you can say they don't
[32:19] know you like we do.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; There is power in the name because
[32:22] you've experienced that power.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; You just said move the immovable.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Break the unre unbreakable.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; God, we believe.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Now, did we just sing it because it's a
[32:36] good song and it's got a good rhythm and
[32:38] it sounds good or did we sing it because
[32:40] it's actually got meaning to us?
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm
[32:46] thank you Lord.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; You also sang from the impossible.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; We see a miracle.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; God we believe. God we believe it.
[32:59] He said and then you sang
[33:02] one moment. I love this song.
[33:16] In the second verse, you said, "We know
[33:19] that hope is never lost,
[33:22] &gt;&gt; for there is still an empty grave.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; God, we believe no matter what, there is
[33:28] power in your name." Hallelujah. So much
[33:32] power in your name.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you a little subject.
[33:37] I I'll title it the reality of faith.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; You know,
[33:43] my I I don't even know where to launch
[33:45] from,
[33:46] &gt;&gt; but we'll just we'll just go. It says,
[33:50] "Now faith is the substance of things
[33:53] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[33:55] seen, for by it the elders obtained a
[33:58] good report." In Hebrews 11:1,
[34:01] the King James version translate uses
[34:03] translation uses substance to mean a
[34:06] firm foundation, assurance or guarantee
[34:10] for things hoped for. The original Greek
[34:13] word hypothesis means that which stands
[34:17] under and implies that faith gives
[34:20] reality,
[34:22] &gt;&gt; confidence, and a tidal deed to unseen
[34:26] promises from God,
[34:28] &gt;&gt; allowing believers to act on them with
[34:31] conviction.
[34:33] Hypothesis can be understood as the
[34:35] basis of foundation upon which hope is
[34:37] built, assurance, and confidence. Faith
[34:40] provides a deep sense of certainty and
[34:43] confidence that God's promises will be
[34:46] fulfilled.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to keep in mind the the song
[34:50] you just sang, even if they aren't
[34:52] visible yet.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Reality and title deed in a legal sense.
[34:57] It can refer to a title deed, which is a
[34:59] document that guarantees ownership and
[35:03] make something real in a legal sense.
[35:06] For believers, faith serves as the title
[35:09] deed for God's promises.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we know faith is possessive.
[35:15] Faith is a is a victory. Faith conquers.
[35:18] Faith overcomes.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; You'll hear a prophet of God describe it
[35:22] and says faith beats down.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's that's an interesting
[35:27] description that he uses, but it's true.
[35:30] Anything that stands above or in line
[35:33] with the things of God, faith must
[35:36] triumph over.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Faith is not here to make peace with the
[35:40] things of go with things of the world.
[35:42] Faith is to tear completely down the
[35:45] things of the world to bring you into a
[35:47] higher form of living.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; You become a possessor. Like you own.
[35:53] It's like if if I told you, hey, I wrote
[35:56] your name on this title for this
[35:58] property, this big batch. You're like,
[36:00] "Oh, really? You put my name on it?"
[36:01] Well, if your name's on the title deed,
[36:03] you have ownership of that.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Nobody could come in and say, "That
[36:08] belongs to me. My great so- and so had
[36:10] it." And then this, that, and the third.
[36:12] The question is going to be said, "Whose
[36:13] name is on the deed? That's the person
[36:16] that owns it." See, oh, thank you, Lord.
[36:20] You might think because you came from a
[36:22] family that, you know, that wouldn't
[36:24] born, they don't have a long history of
[36:25] people born in the message. You don't
[36:27] have a long history of well this is just
[36:29] generation to generation to generation
[36:31] passed down. I had to believe. You might
[36:33] think that because of that that somehow
[36:35] you don't get the same benefits but
[36:39] you're you're still a son. You're still
[36:41] a daughter. Your true existence is not
[36:43] the lineage that came before you. Your
[36:45] true existence is what he said it was.
[36:47] And he said he had you in mind in the
[36:49] beginning. You were a part of him then
[36:52] since then. So then it didn't really
[36:54] matter how you came here. All that
[36:57] matters is you are here. And if you are
[36:59] here, then you are a possessor of all
[37:02] the divine promises of God. Every
[37:05] promise in the book truly is mine.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; I love what our pastor said. He said,
[37:09] "Faith is how you look at it." And that
[37:12] struck so much because what tends to
[37:15] happen is we put the wrong perspective
[37:18] when it comes to the things of God.
[37:20] somebody I care uh deeply for and have a
[37:23] lot of love for made the statement and
[37:24] said, "I feel like the devil.
[37:28] I'm being made to feel like the devil."
[37:31] Like every action that I do, everything
[37:33] that I do, somehow I'm being made to
[37:35] feel like the devil. I go to church, the
[37:38] the minister is preaching and I feel
[37:39] like he's preaching against me.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; He's attacking me. Like I'm the I'm the
[37:45] terrible person. Like I've done
[37:46] something wrong. You see, that's not
[37:48] God.
[37:49] that thing that tells you, "Hey, you're
[37:51] the devil." That's not how God deals
[37:53] with his children. He doesn't call, he
[37:55] doesn't need to call you the devil. He'd
[37:57] rather spend his time calling you out of
[37:59] that stuff rather than trying to beat
[38:01] you down into a complex.
[38:03] But what the devil does is when the word
[38:05] goes forth and it's being preached, if
[38:07] it hits your address, the devil wants to
[38:10] say, "It's a personal attack."
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Faith says, "I need that,
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Lord. I need that to overcome whatever
[38:16] I'm going through in my life. That's for
[38:19] me. Amen. And I press on. I can't dwell
[38:22] just because well, you know, I might
[38:23] have told this person and then this
[38:25] person might have told that person. So
[38:26] that might have got to the pastor. And
[38:28] because it got to the pastor, now when
[38:30] he preaches, now you're filtering
[38:32] everything through your lens because all
[38:34] this revolves around you.
[38:38] This is what the devil does. You sit in
[38:40] church and he tells you you're the only
[38:42] person this concerns. Everybody else is
[38:45] living right.
[38:47] You're the devil.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[38:54] What a bluff.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; All that for what? So you never
[38:59] recognize
[39:00] &gt;&gt; that the promise that says you can
[39:01] overcome that is yours.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; All that just to keep you down.
[39:08] It says
[39:11] Hebrews 10:38:39,
[39:13] "Now the just shall live by faith,
[39:16] &gt;&gt; but if any man draw back, my soul shall
[39:20] have no pleasure in him."
[39:24] In this first part, the just shall live
[39:26] by faith. To draw back, you could all
[39:29] you could use the word to backslide, to
[39:32] have made a mistake and came back on.
[39:36] See, the devil says, "Because you've
[39:38] made an error, because you drew back,
[39:42] you're now a part of the son of
[39:43] predition."
[39:45] But no, I heard my prophet say, "You
[39:48] backslide every day."
[39:52] We've all heard that. He said, "You
[39:54] backslide every day." But there's
[39:56] something in you that says, "I got to
[39:58] make this right."
[40:01] See, in them, there's nothing in there
[40:03] saying, "I need to make this right."
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Don't identify yourself with things that
[40:09] don't concern you.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; But identify yourself rather on the
[40:14] things that tell you who you actually
[40:15] are according to his kingdom.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Not what the flesh identifies to, but
[40:20] what the word, the spirit he placed in
[40:22] you identifies to.
[40:24] Why would God call you,
[40:28] predestinate, elect you? Let me just use
[40:31] this terminology. Why would you feel so
[40:33] tormented
[40:35] by the desire to live right? That's
[40:37] &gt;&gt; right.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; If you were the devil,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; what what is that? See, what is that
[40:47] torment? Oh, man. Every time you make a
[40:50] mistake, oh, I got to make this right.
[40:51] Lord, I'm so sorry, man. I just can't
[40:53] seem to get it right. I just can't seem
[40:54] to get it right. But you are trying to
[40:56] get it right. You are working to try to
[41:00] get it right. And because you fall and
[41:02] you make an error, you now look at
[41:04] yourself in the wrong lens. You start
[41:07] now attributing yourself to depart from
[41:09] me you that work iniquity, for I never
[41:11] knew you. I I love that story. Said,
[41:14] man, he was preaching. He called me a
[41:16] buzzard. He called me an eagle.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; It all depends on how you look at it.
[41:22] Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; And it it it's it struck me. He says,
[41:27] "But we are not of them who draw back
[41:30] unto predition."
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Draw back unto all the way to predition.
[41:38] It says, "But of them that believe to
[41:40] the saving of the soul." Predition, this
[41:42] word means ruin,
[41:45] loss, or destruction. It can refer to
[41:49] eternal damnation in hell. or a state of
[41:52] severe ruinous consequences within one's
[41:56] earthly life. Now, why as a son or
[42:00] daughter of God would you ever listen to
[42:02] the devil that would tell you that you
[42:04] belong with such a bunch?
[42:07] When you know his word said, "My sheep
[42:09] hear my voice
[42:11] &gt;&gt; and another they will not follow. Of all
[42:13] that you have given me, I will not lose
[42:16] one."
[42:18] &gt;&gt; You aren't lost. You aren't the devil.
[42:20] You aren't ruined. The God of heaven is
[42:23] still calling at your heart. Why else
[42:26] would he would you keep trying to live
[42:28] right? There's a deep on the inside. I I
[42:32] want to lay a couple of these uh
[42:35] foundations before jumping into the the
[42:36] sermon that inspired me. But it's
[42:40] there's a deep on the inside that's
[42:42] crying out saying this life of up and
[42:45] down is not the life I'm promised to
[42:48] live. There's something on the inside
[42:50] that says I can live a life
[42:53] &gt;&gt; where I'm stable
[42:55] &gt;&gt; and I'm consistent
[42:57] and I've laid aside all weight of this
[42:59] world and I'm focused solely on the
[43:02] things of God. Something in your heart
[43:04] cries out for that.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; There could only be that cry in your
[43:08] heart if God could fill it.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; So if if there's a desire for it, don't
[43:14] fixate on the errors, but fixate on that
[43:17] desire. walk towards that desire that
[43:20] says I can live right, I can be right.
[43:25] Brother Brandham says in faith is our
[43:27] victory. Paragraph 58 10:04 not
[43:31] paragraph uh the year 58 104
[43:34] [snorts]
[43:35] he talks talking about Abraham here he
[43:38] says paragraph 48 one day while Abraham
[43:42] was praying no doubt he prayed through
[43:44] till he struck the hand of God. How did
[43:47] he do it? By faith.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Perhaps he thought like this. If there
[43:52] is a God who made the ark and let Noah
[43:55] float through, he still lives today.
[43:58] Somewhere in the land of heathens where
[44:01] he was a sojouring, he touched the hand
[44:04] of God and in there God gave him a
[44:08] revelation that there was a city whose
[44:11] builder and maker was God. Hallelujah.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; If Abraham received such a vision
[44:16] &gt;&gt; of that, how much more you in this hour,
[44:20] what was preached to us by God's
[44:22] prophet, what were you promised?
[44:25] &gt;&gt; It was said of you that you would be a
[44:27] spotless bride.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; It was said of you that you will do the
[44:31] greater works. It was said of you that
[44:34] you will be perfect.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; It was said of you. And and when brother
[44:38] is preaching a series of Hebrews, he
[44:40] says you're going to get to the point
[44:41] you're not living a life that's like
[44:43] this.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; That's your promise. Con you don't want
[44:47] the the uh the the complex that comes
[44:50] with I've been good for this many weeks,
[44:54] I make a mistake.
[44:56] Not going to be good again for a couple
[44:57] more and then I make another mistake. Be
[44:59] good for a couple more and then make
[45:00] another mistake. No, that's not your
[45:03] cycle.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; You're not meant to be in that. You're
[45:06] supposed to be like a boxer. If you get
[45:07] knocked down, get up. Keep going.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Don't even dwell on it. It ain't over
[45:11] till that bell rings.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, when that bell
[45:15] rings, the prophet said, "You are
[45:17] victorious."
[45:18] &gt;&gt; So, you don't have to worry how it
[45:20] finishes. He already told you how it
[45:22] would finish. You would be victorious.
[45:25] Now, if the vision is victory,
[45:28] if the vision is overcoming
[45:32] like Abraham, what must we do? walk
[45:35] towards that vision. There is a land
[45:38] whose builder and maker is God. Man's
[45:41] hands got nothing to do with this land.
[45:44] We know brotherham says that the Holy
[45:45] Ghost is the land
[45:47] &gt;&gt; and you must possess the land.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; He says and we read that all Abraham's
[45:54] life he was a pilgrim and a stranger to
[45:56] the world for this one ambition was to
[45:59] find that city whose builder and maker
[46:02] was God. He struck something. He caught
[46:05] God and a faith in that God that he
[46:09] foresaw the new Jerusalem. And he put
[46:12] his pack on his back and became a
[46:14] wanderer. Not just floating about
[46:16] without any purpose. He had faith. There
[46:19] was a city whose builder and maker was
[46:22] God, an eternal city. He had a purpose
[46:25] in life to find that place. May I say
[46:29] that one day when the battle was over,
[46:30] he met the king of that city and he gave
[46:33] him the communion bread and wine,
[46:35] Melzdc. Oh, you can't purpose, this is
[46:39] so good. Oh, you can't purpose anything
[46:41] of God's promise in your heart without
[46:44] finding the reality to it.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; You can't purpose in your heart. I'm
[46:51] want to be a sold out lock, stock, and
[46:54] barrel believer
[46:55] &gt;&gt; without finding that reality somewhere.
[46:58] You have got to find it
[47:01] &gt;&gt; because God's God is not like man. He
[47:04] cannot lie. It's impossible. So if the
[47:08] desire in you is that, then God has
[47:12] something to feed to quench that desire
[47:15] that you can look and see, hey, I this
[47:18] day, this scripture is fulfilled in my
[47:20] life.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; That's what God desires. He doesn't just
[47:24] make empty promises and hope so promises
[47:28] so that you could just try and try. Man,
[47:30] I made all the efforts to get there and
[47:32] you fall short. He didn't want you to
[47:34] fall short. He didn't call you to fall
[47:36] short, but he called you to go all the
[47:38] way.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Something our pastor said that struck me
[47:41] so much. He said, "So many people come
[47:44] down to the altar here." He says, "They
[47:46] come recognizing
[47:48] that they're wrong, but they don't want
[47:50] the deliverance. They're comfortable
[47:53] with just the feeling of recognizing
[47:54] I've done something wrong. Oh, I've got
[47:57] such a conviction. When that brother was
[47:59] preaching, my soul, my heart, I just
[48:01] felt so low. I I felt like I was I was
[48:03] terrible. like I I needed God. I needed
[48:05] God. And you go up to the altar, you get
[48:08] prayed for, and you're just satisfied
[48:11] with that. You had the conviction.
[48:14] A believer doesn't say, "Oh, you know,
[48:16] I'm happy I felt convicted." A believer
[48:18] says, "I need to get over this thing.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; I can't stay here. I've got to press
[48:23] through it. I've got to move beyond it.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; I can't be fighting the same thing 10
[48:29] years down the line.
[48:32] It's one day I've got to get over this
[48:34] thing.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Now, God has an appointed time for
[48:37] everything. So, if you find yourself
[48:39] fighting the same thing 10 years down
[48:40] the line, don't look at, oh, it's been
[48:42] 10 years. No. Every day you say, this is
[48:45] the day this thing will finish.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And you walk towards that till you see
[48:49] it fulfilled in your life.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; He says
[48:53] you'll have a purpose in what you're
[48:55] seeking for.
[49:01] He says, "Oh, you can't purpose anything
[49:03] in God's promise in your heart without
[49:05] finding the reality to it." If your soul
[49:08] has been tormented by sins and doubts
[49:11] and ups and downs and frustrations,
[49:14] there's something down in you that's
[49:15] telling you that there's somewhere you
[49:17] can overcome that. Why do you float
[49:20] around in from church to church and from
[49:22] place to place? Brother Brandham's
[49:25] advice is so profound. It's so deep.
[49:28] It's like this the the seals times 10
[49:31] when he's describing how to get past
[49:32] these things. One of his like algebraic
[49:34] formulas is just kneel down till you
[49:36] strike heaven.
[49:39] That's so complex. Just kneel down till
[49:43] you strike heaven. No. What you want you
[49:46] you want me to you want the min the
[49:48] ministers to come up and say, "Come up
[49:50] here. We'll pray for you and I'll give
[49:52] you this thing. You'll never taste what
[49:54] victory is like on your own. what it
[49:57] means to push through something, to
[49:58] fight through. You think God wants to
[50:00] make you dependent on a man.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be dependent on him.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; If he uses the vessel, praise God, but
[50:07] your faith is not in the man, but it's
[50:10] in God.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You need to know how to overcome things.
[50:13] You need to know how to fight things.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham would say,
[50:18] &gt;&gt; you could come up for prayer. He said,
[50:20] "Now, sister,
[50:22] you've been misdiagnosed.
[50:24] There's a spirit of doubt on you and
[50:27] that doubt is causing you to not be
[50:29] healed. He said now this is the prophet
[50:33] who when he prayed limbs grew
[50:36] &gt;&gt; dead risen. He so many miracles we saw
[50:39] we heard and saw in his life.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; He said sister I can pray for you now. I
[50:47] can take it away but I can't keep it
[50:49] away.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; You got to do that.
[50:55] What is faith?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Faith says, "Oh, I got to keep it away.
[51:01] I'mma keep it away.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; It's It's got no more control over me.
[51:06] It's got no more power over me. It's not
[51:08] every single time. I just need that
[51:11] brother to come and pray for me so I can
[51:13] get through this thing."
[51:15] You're being you're being dependent.
[51:17] You're not a child.
[51:19] Grow up.
[51:21] gets a get a backbone in you and says,
[51:23] "I'm tired of this thing."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Do you think it would have had the same
[51:28] effect in Brother Matthew's testimony if
[51:31] he'd have asked somebody else to take
[51:33] bolt cutters and hit that TV? Do you
[51:36] think it would have had the same effect?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, please. Oh, big brother David, could
[51:40] you please go and do that for me? It
[51:43] wouldn't have the same effect. Something
[51:46] struck him.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with this. Oh, you
[51:49] think you're gonna get me? Watch this.
[51:52] And he got it.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But we think
[51:57] we just have to always
[52:00] always I just need this person to to
[52:02] pray for me. I just need this person to
[52:05] pray for me. I just need this person to
[52:06] pray for me. There is a faith that has
[52:08] been given that if you feel the elders
[52:10] should lay hands on you, they lay hands
[52:12] on you and you shall be healed. The word
[52:15] says that if you come with that
[52:18] expectation, you will receive what you
[52:20] have asked for. But there is also a
[52:22] faith that our prophet spoke of when he
[52:25] speaks to the sister and he says
[52:27] &gt;&gt; you I thought you said you had all
[52:29] faith. I do have all faith. He said,
[52:31] "What are you doing up here? [snorts] If
[52:33] you had all faith, you'd receive it
[52:35] where you were at."
[52:36] &gt;&gt; What was he trying to tell you? He was
[52:39] trying to paid a greater than all of
[52:41] them is here. He said, "I must decrease,
[52:44] so Christ must increase." What were we
[52:46] being told
[52:48] he is here, and if he's here, then
[52:52] anything I have need of? If I know the
[52:55] word says it, faith makes me a possessor
[52:58] of that said promise. Therefore, I can
[53:01] come humbly. I know the word says this,
[53:04] and I can say, "Satan, get thee behind.
[53:07] This is my promise. I'm walking towards
[53:10] this." Hallelujah.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; He says,
[53:16] "Kneel down and strike heaven." And I
[53:19] and I said last night, go beyond the
[53:21] sound barriers and then you'll have a
[53:23] purpose in life. You'll have a purpose
[53:25] in belonging in church. You'll have a
[53:27] per purpose in being baptized. You'll
[53:29] have a purpose in what you're seeking
[53:31] for. Because we know that God is honest
[53:33] and God is true. And God cannot lie. And
[53:36] if God placed that into Abraham's heart
[53:39] by his voice, his word, then God has
[53:42] placed in before us in his Bible, and by
[53:45] the witness of the Holy Spirit, by the
[53:48] returning of the Holy Spirit in signs
[53:50] and wonders that Jesus Christ still
[53:52] lives and is the same yesterday, today,
[53:56] and forever. Then why would we seek any
[53:58] longer for those things that we desire?
[54:03] If you need any need whatsoever that God
[54:07] has promised in his Bible, he's here
[54:09] tonight to meet that need.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; No need seeking farther. His presence is
[54:15] here. His spirit is here. He's willing
[54:18] and ready and longing to give you that
[54:20] what you are seeking for. Why would you
[54:23] wait any longer?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my. the condition we sometimes get in
[54:30] where God's trying to bless us with
[54:31] something and give us something. We know
[54:33] that we're struggling with something.
[54:34] We're fighting with something and we're
[54:36] trying to get over that thing. But
[54:38] rather than getting down to business the
[54:40] moment in which you realize this is a
[54:42] problem, you say, "I'm going to wait for
[54:44] the next meeting when we have that when
[54:46] that atmosphere is just right and
[54:48] everybody's just right." Who told you
[54:50] you'd make it to the next meeting?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; All you've got is today. So if
[54:55] something's burning in your heart, I
[54:56] need to get this out of my life today.
[54:58] Don't make a Wednesday service routine.
[55:01] Don't make a Sunday night service
[55:02] routine. God is here. And if he's here,
[55:06] deliverance is here. Now, we know our
[55:08] prophet said, "Where light is, darkness
[55:10] can't be. Where life is, death can't
[55:13] be." So how can we sit here dead when
[55:15] Christ is in our midst?
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Something's got to give and say, "I need
[55:21] life
[55:22] &gt;&gt; and LIFE MORE ABUNDANT. I'VE GOT TO GET
[55:24] PAST THIS THING.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; If we came with that attitude, every
[55:29] single time service the doors were open,
[55:32] oh, what lives would we live when we
[55:34] knew the King of Kings is present here?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And anything I have need of, he's more
[55:39] than willing and able to perform it.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; But no, but we we come to church. I say
[55:45] we, I'm including myself in it. We come
[55:47] to church. It's just routine. We sit
[55:49] down. The minister is laboring. He's
[55:51] preaching things that are true. He's
[55:52] preaching the word and rather than
[55:54] amening and claiming and saying this is
[55:56] my showdown. I'm not going any longer.
[55:58] I'm dealing with it today. No, it's just
[56:02] a Wednesday night service. I'll wait
[56:04] till Sunday morning.
[56:07] I'll wait till next year. Remember the
[56:09] Tom Ray is here and when he reads that
[56:12] quote again from Christ in the midst of
[56:14] God revealed,
[56:15] &gt;&gt; then I'll get it.
[56:18] No,
[56:20] you need God now.
[56:22] today.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says sometimes we got
[56:26] to get out of order
[56:28] &gt;&gt; long enough to be saved.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? If something's
[56:31] crying in your heart right now that
[56:34] says, "I need God."
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Don't wait till they say, "Come up for
[56:38] prayer if you need it." You move with
[56:40] the uncction he puts on your heart.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; We're so routine-based.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Something's got to be this way. Things
[56:48] got to be that way. No, he gave you a
[56:51] holy uncction.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Move according to the uncction he put in
[56:55] your heart.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; If you've got the faith that says,
[56:59] "Right here where I'm at, Lord, you will
[57:01] find me here."
[57:03] &gt;&gt; See, the devil goes, "But you got work
[57:05] tomorrow. You got to be up at 3:00 a.m.
[57:09] God knows why, but you got to be up at
[57:11] 3:00 a.m. so you can go to work and be
[57:14] there at 5. Man, you can't stay long on
[57:16] a Wednesday.
[57:18] You can't pray through till you get it
[57:19] on the Wednesday because you got
[57:20] something to do tomorrow.
[57:22] Oh, it's Sunday. Well, you know, Sunday
[57:24] morning was good, but I got to eat
[57:25] lunch, man. When is the service going to
[57:26] get over with? I got to eat.
[57:29] Did we laugh? But I've thought of these
[57:32] thoughts.
[57:34] I've sat there preach preaching the word
[57:36] on a Sunday morning. I'm like, what am I
[57:38] going to eat for lunch today?
[57:43] And missing the very opportunity
[57:47] If if the president of the United States
[57:49] was here, what would our attitudes be?
[57:53] You might say, "I don't care for him. I
[57:55] don't care for the president of the
[57:56] United States." Okay, we'll have your
[57:58] favorite pop star then.
[58:01] If he was here
[58:03] or whoever you admire, if they were here
[58:07] that you hold to such a prestige,
[58:10] what would your behavior be then?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving till I get my autograph.
[58:17] I'm not leaving till he sees me.
[58:19] Remember that little child that said I
[58:22] waved. Did you see him? I saw him, but
[58:25] he ain't seen me.
[58:28] But we come here every Wednesday, every
[58:31] Sunday unimpressed
[58:34] and we go right back home.
[58:37] We This It's business time.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; We're done playing church.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. The cry the cry in my heart.
[58:46] I I I I I I it's almost the Lord strip
[58:49] stripped every part of the humanity in
[58:51] me
[58:53] reading this and seeing how God is
[58:55] breaking this down.
[58:57] You you can't stay the same.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Something says I I I need a change.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I need something real in my life. Yes.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Well, if I know the King of Kings is
[59:09] here,
[59:11] my the you know, I've I've had the the
[59:15] well, I say privilege, sometimes it's an
[59:17] unfortunate privilege to have
[59:19] conversations with with certain uh
[59:21] atheists that just will insult God from
[59:24] A to Z because they just have no care in
[59:26] the world.
[59:28] And they always make this statement. And
[59:30] they say, "Well, if God was here and he
[59:33] appeared,
[59:35] I would believe him."
[59:38] You know, I I I know I would. I hate his
[59:41] guts, but if he appeared,
[59:44] I would believe that he was God. If
[59:47] we're not careful, we start having that
[59:48] same attitude.
[59:50] The at if the atmosphere feels right, if
[59:53] I start tingling in my flesh, then I
[59:55] know God is here.
[59:57] No, he's here because he said he would
[59:59] be here.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And if he said he would be here,
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; what's your attitude now that he's here?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm just a child.
[1:00:09] I I there's there's there's no point in
[1:00:11] me trying to make a move for God. I'm
[1:00:14] young. Little old me. I'm just a girl
[1:00:18] or I'm a young man. I don't have any
[1:00:21] responsibilities yet. So, church isn't
[1:00:24] really my thing. saying, "I really go
[1:00:26] cuz my parents forced me to be here."
[1:00:28] But then something strikes. If you've
[1:00:31] met him, something strikes and you know
[1:00:34] when that presence is there. You
[1:00:38] know when when when when the waters were
[1:00:40] disturbed in the pool of Bethesda,
[1:00:43] everybody knew this is the time to get
[1:00:45] in.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; The waters disturbed. Get in now.
[1:00:50] But when the very one
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; who gave power to that pool, that water
[1:00:55] was right there
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; and just walking
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; unrecognized.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I I don't know if our prophet
[1:01:04] preached this, but I've always thought
[1:01:06] of this title, the unrecognized presence
[1:01:08] of God.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; The unrecognized presence of God.
[1:01:15] We're no longer impressed.
[1:01:18] Our behavior tells us that, our
[1:01:21] attitudes tell us that
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; if
[1:01:25] I'm sorry, but I just got to pour out my
[1:01:26] heart. If we know Christ is here and we
[1:01:31] know we came into these doors and what
[1:01:34] we had on wasn't right, whether it was
[1:01:36] too tight, whether it was healed,
[1:01:38] whether it was the wrong hairstyle,
[1:01:39] whatever the case is, we do believe the
[1:01:42] King of Kings is here
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; and he deserves reverence.
[1:01:48] in how we behave, how we talk, how we
[1:01:51] dress, how we act. If that's the case,
[1:01:55] shouldn't our behaviors align?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But we we're taking liberties now.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; We're we're having fun.
[1:02:04] Have fun in church by all means. But the
[1:02:07] one thing it said about my prophet was
[1:02:09] he knew how to have good clean fun. It
[1:02:12] wasn't just fun. It was clean fun. You
[1:02:15] come to church, you're here to hear from
[1:02:18] him. You're here to have a conference
[1:02:20] with him.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; The reality faith says, your word says
[1:02:26] where two or three are gathered, there
[1:02:28] in the midst I will be.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; He made that promise.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Well, if God is here,
[1:02:37] what mountain in your life
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; can't be moved?
[1:02:45] What's the circumstance? What's the
[1:02:47] situation?
[1:02:49] What's the obligation that's more
[1:02:50] important?
[1:02:52] But if we said, I don't know why I'm,
[1:02:56] but if we said, every time you come to
[1:02:59] church, I'll give you this amount of
[1:03:01] money. Every single person that would
[1:03:04] come to church, I'm going to give you
[1:03:06] this amount every time you come to
[1:03:07] service. They'd be, man, we
[1:03:11] we'd have to build a bigger church.
[1:03:14] We'd need to sit people here, sit people
[1:03:16] there. People would be standing up
[1:03:17] everywhere because they knew they were
[1:03:19] getting a blessing,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; especially because they some of them
[1:03:23] would be in need of it.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; It's like, "Oh, I'm I'm in need. I'll go
[1:03:26] I'll go by faith because I know they're
[1:03:28] going to give it to me."
[1:03:30] But we know God said, "No man comes to
[1:03:33] him and returns the same."
[1:03:35] So we we know we should know and have
[1:03:37] the belief that if we've got something
[1:03:40] we're going through and fighting when we
[1:03:42] come into his house, it's done.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; You just have to have that kind of faith
[1:03:46] that says it's finished.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter that it's a Wednesday
[1:03:50] night service. This may be the last
[1:03:53] service.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving here the same.
[1:04:06] Pray for me. I've been fighting the
[1:04:07] sickness he's trying to give me, but
[1:04:09] it's finished tonight.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; He says, [clears throat]
[1:04:13] "Whatsoever you need, God has promised.
[1:04:20] His presence is here. His spirit is here
[1:04:21] and is willing and ready and longing to
[1:04:23] give you that what you are seeking for.
[1:04:25] Why would you wait any longer? When you
[1:04:28] come to him, don't come as a floater.
[1:04:30] I'll go up and try and see if it works.
[1:04:34] You'll never get nowhere. But when you
[1:04:37] come with this kind of determination
[1:04:39] that you have sold out lock, stock and
[1:04:42] barrel, when you're tired of the world
[1:04:44] and sin and unbelief and frustrations
[1:04:47] and doubts and come to the living God
[1:04:50] with an anchor surely tightened in the
[1:04:52] rock of ages, the Holy Spirit is here to
[1:04:55] pull you into the presence of the living
[1:04:58] God that will give you faith that will
[1:05:01] overcome anything there is in the world.
[1:05:05] Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Did he say anything or some things?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Anything.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Faith that'll overcome anything there is
[1:05:14] in the world. Sickness, disease, and
[1:05:16] even death itself.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Now, we know a lot of times our prophet
[1:05:20] says death. He's not just speaking about
[1:05:22] the natural death. He's speaking about
[1:05:23] the spiritual one.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; So, if you came in here dead
[1:05:26] spiritually, you'll walk out with life
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; if you believe that he is here.
[1:05:32] You say, you said death, brother
[1:05:34] Brandham. And that's what I meant.
[1:05:36] Death.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Was it not Lazarus who was laying dead
[1:05:40] in the ground and already corrupted?
[1:05:42] Corruption set in when Jesus said to
[1:05:44] Martha, "Where have you buried him?" And
[1:05:46] you won't doubt, you shall see the glory
[1:05:47] of God. And if you won't doubt, oh,
[1:05:50] hallelujah. And if you won't doubt, you
[1:05:53] shall see the glory of God.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Got to stop doubting, saints.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; If you want to see the glory of God,
[1:05:59] don't doubt.
[1:06:01] There's no reason to doubt. He's never
[1:06:03] made a promise he hadn't kept.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:06:10] "Did not I tell you not to doubt?"
[1:06:14] He said to Gyrus that night or that day,
[1:06:17] "If you'll only believe, you can see the
[1:06:20] glory of God. Then faith overcomes
[1:06:22] death. Faith is the victory over death.
[1:06:25] Faith is the victory over sin. Faith is
[1:06:28] the victory over sickness. Faith is the
[1:06:30] victory over worry. Faith is the victory
[1:06:33] over frustrations. Faith is the victory
[1:06:35] over the world.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; You say, John, when he wrote that, he
[1:06:39] did not have in my troubles. He did not
[1:06:42] have to deal with the folk that I deal
[1:06:43] with. He did not have to go through the
[1:06:45] things that I do. That's right. Oh,
[1:06:48] we've all, if you're honest, you've been
[1:06:50] through that same thought process. That
[1:06:53] person didn't have to deal what I had to
[1:06:55] deal with. His situation was a bit
[1:06:57] easier. Mine's dire. Mine Mine's more
[1:07:00] troublesome.
[1:07:02] He may not had to deal with the same
[1:07:04] folk.
[1:07:06] He may not had to overcome the same
[1:07:07] thing, but he never excluded them.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; For he said this, the faith is the
[1:07:14] victory that overcomes the world,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; the whole thing.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; How is it? Get faith in it
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; right above it. When we have the written
[1:07:26] word of God laying before us, the Holy
[1:07:29] Spirit here performing and showing the
[1:07:31] resurrection of the Lord Jesus with the
[1:07:33] divine promises written here that
[1:07:35] whatsoever thing you desire when you
[1:07:38] pray,
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; believe you receive it and you shall
[1:07:42] have it.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; What do you have? What do you have to do
[1:07:47] then? Have faith.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Not just floating faith. Not just
[1:07:53] makebelieve faith, but a real faith. Now
[1:07:56] faith is a conqueror. Faith is an
[1:07:58] overcomer. It just isn't a peacemaker.
[1:08:01] It overcomes. Faith is the victory that
[1:08:04] overcomes the world. What does it do?
[1:08:07] What is faith? What is to conquer?
[1:08:09] Conquer and victory is the same. To
[1:08:12] conquer, it means to beat down, to
[1:08:15] override, to handcuff, to throw into
[1:08:18] prison. It means that sin that once
[1:08:21] ruled you, you rule it now. It means
[1:08:25] that you have overcome it. You are,
[1:08:28] you've whipped it.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You are greater than it is.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel religious right now.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; My boy, that feels good. He says you are
[1:08:42] greater than it is.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And what is the lie the devil tells you?
[1:08:48] It's greater than you.
[1:08:52] It can't be overcome by you. You're
[1:08:56] weaker than it.
[1:08:59] It's got power over you. You've tried to
[1:09:02] overcome it and it hasn't worked.
[1:09:07] But my prophet said, "You are greater
[1:09:11] than it is."
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Where are you looking at it from?
[1:09:17] the standpoint of the flesh trying to
[1:09:19] live a righteous life
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; which is impossible
[1:09:24] or the the spirit that looks and says
[1:09:26] this word is my promise and I live after
[1:09:29] the spirit not after the flesh and I
[1:09:32] will take this flesh under subjection by
[1:09:34] the spirit it all depends on the lenses
[1:09:37] in which you're looking at it from
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; this oh this this was so good which was
[1:09:43] first a sinner or a savior
[1:09:47] a savior. For a savior is more powerful
[1:09:51] than a sin.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Which was first, the healer or a
[1:09:55] sickness? It couldn't be a a healer less
[1:09:59] he was over the sickness.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; It is a healer. It can conquer the
[1:10:04] sickness. [snorts]
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to pause here and
[1:10:07] interject this. What was first?
[1:10:10] The fault you made yesterday or your
[1:10:12] existence?
[1:10:15] What was first? Your identity or what he
[1:10:17] tells you
[1:10:21] just chronologically if we're just
[1:10:23] simple. What comes first? One or two?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; One. Okay. So, if you were there in the
[1:10:33] beginning,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; rejoicing with him, then
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; how then can the thing now have more
[1:10:40] power than that which he made then?
[1:10:43] It can't happen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; You came before it.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; In fact, it only came to show you more
[1:10:51] of what it was.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Without this thing that took place here,
[1:10:57] you would have never known just how
[1:10:59] great that victory was.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "And faith is the victory that
[1:11:07] overcomes every curse of sin, every
[1:11:10] curse of the devil." Faith is the
[1:11:12] victory. Faith is what? Not faith in
[1:11:14] your church, not faith in your creed,
[1:11:17] not faith in some man, but faith in
[1:11:19] Jesus Christ who made the promise.
[1:11:22] That's the victory. What is it? It is
[1:11:24] the victory. See, my arm is still
[1:11:27] crippled,
[1:11:28] but faith is the victory. I still feel
[1:11:31] sick, but faith is the victory. Oh, it
[1:11:34] overcomes the world. When you can climb
[1:11:37] into God by prayer, until you see the
[1:11:41] thing conquered under you,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; there is nothing that can hurt you. Then
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; see, our problem is we're not sitting
[1:11:49] there till we see it conquered.
[1:11:53] We're just sitting dwelling on how
[1:11:56] powerful it is
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; when it only has as much power as we
[1:12:00] give it.
[1:12:03] We all know our prophet taught us that
[1:12:05] the devil only does what you allow.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; If you don't open any gates for him, he
[1:12:11] can't come in. But if you leave a gate
[1:12:13] open, he enters in. And how he loves to
[1:12:16] enter in.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He enters in better than us. He comes
[1:12:19] every service. He don't miss.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Because if he can get into your mind
[1:12:24] during the service and see how the devil
[1:12:26] works is you'll come into church, the
[1:12:28] word will go forth. It'll deal with your
[1:12:31] heart. Something that God placed on the
[1:12:33] inside says, "I want that." And you
[1:12:36] start making the moves towards that. You
[1:12:39] start acting towards that thing. And
[1:12:41] then you leave the service. You walk
[1:12:43] outside and that close believing friend
[1:12:45] of yours says the wrong thing to you.
[1:12:48] And you completely shuts you down from
[1:12:50] what you were about to do.
[1:12:53] You felt an uncction to make a move for
[1:12:54] God.
[1:12:56] See, it's not it's not that your
[1:12:58] believing friend is the devil. No. But
[1:13:01] sometimes we say things that aren't
[1:13:04] really the the right reflection of who
[1:13:06] we are.
[1:13:08] When he told Peter, "Depart from me,
[1:13:10] Satan." Was he speaking to him or what
[1:13:11] he said? It's the words that came out of
[1:13:14] him. Depart from me, Satan. He wasn't
[1:13:17] calling Peter Satan. It was those words.
[1:13:20] We have to break past even the
[1:13:22] friendships we have and realize this is
[1:13:24] business.
[1:13:26] If I have to be with God alone and just
[1:13:29] me and him and all my friends go away
[1:13:31] from me and they don't want to hang out
[1:13:32] with me, they don't want to be friends
[1:13:34] with me anymore because I'm solely
[1:13:35] focused on the things of God. So be it.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, I'm going to get a
[1:13:40] hold of him.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I lost many of friends
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; being behind here,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; living for this message. mainly I I
[1:13:51] remember the first time I preached my
[1:13:53] closest closest friends said oh because
[1:13:56] Ben's preaching now we can't talk to him
[1:13:58] anymore
[1:14:00] we can't associate with him anymore
[1:14:02] because now he's serving
[1:14:05] as if this made me any greater than them
[1:14:09] in fact in God's economy I'm lower I'm
[1:14:12] serving you
[1:14:15] there is no bone in me that wants to
[1:14:17] have power over you not a single I don't
[1:14:19] have power over myself.
[1:14:22] But I you you start to see what the
[1:14:24] devil does. He makes you think because
[1:14:26] you want to live lock, stop, and bear
[1:14:28] for the things of God that everybody's
[1:14:30] going to leave fall leave you away. No
[1:14:32] one's going to talk to you. You're going
[1:14:34] to be alone. You're going to have
[1:14:35] nobody.
[1:14:38] That's not the case.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; You've got him.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; If I got Jesus, I got it all.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; If he blesses me with friends, praise
[1:14:48] God. But if he don't, all I got is him.
[1:14:51] That's all I need.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's an easier life when all you got is
[1:14:55] you and him. When there's nothing in
[1:14:57] between that channel and it's just you
[1:14:59] and God, not this friend saying that,
[1:15:01] this person saying that, no, God, you
[1:15:03] speak, I say, "Amen. I live it."
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; But when you start adding a bunch of
[1:15:07] people into the mix, you having
[1:15:09] different channels. You want to do this
[1:15:11] thing for God. This person says, "Well,
[1:15:12] you don't have to do it that way. You
[1:15:13] can do it." No. Listen to the uncction
[1:15:15] in your heart. He put it there for a
[1:15:18] reason.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; What's okay to them may not be okay for
[1:15:21] you.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You may be given a greater measure of
[1:15:24] faith because of your obedience.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Time is getting away from me. There's
[1:15:33] too much in here. Um he says
[1:15:38] [snorts] when you can climb into God's
[1:15:41] into God by prayer until you see the
[1:15:43] thing conquered under you there is
[1:15:44] nothing that can hurt you then you've
[1:15:47] overcome. You've got 50 miles of elbow
[1:15:50] room.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; You're sailing free then. You who have
[1:15:54] been a drunkard and a slave to whiskey,
[1:15:56] you will be master over him. Then that
[1:16:00] old devil of alcohol that made you
[1:16:01] drink. Notice how he said that
[1:16:05] it wasn't you,
[1:16:07] which the devil wants to make you think
[1:16:09] it's you.
[1:16:11] He says that old devil
[1:16:14] of alcohol that made you drink. You
[1:16:18] could put that old devil of gossip that
[1:16:21] made you gossip. You could put that old
[1:16:24] devil of whatever whatever you're
[1:16:26] fighting with that old devil that made
[1:16:29] you do that. He says
[1:16:33] made you drink. He's your master now.
[1:16:36] But when you get faith,
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; I don't mean makebelief,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; real faith.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; He's your servant then.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; You can't lay down tobacco. You women
[1:16:48] and men, when it comes to a place to
[1:16:49] where you can get to that spot to where
[1:16:51] you have by faith, you'll master it
[1:16:54] then.
[1:17:00] Brother brother Ram then gets into a
[1:17:02] story. He's talking about
[1:17:05] a sister. He says,
[1:17:08] I don't want to uh read all of that, but
[1:17:10] he he's describing a a Baptist sister
[1:17:14] who was going through a circumstance and
[1:17:16] he says and brother in paragraph 75 and
[1:17:19] brother Robertson is back there and Mr.
[1:17:20] wood there. Wood sitting there somewhere
[1:17:22] and I and where I go down hunting I
[1:17:24] believe somewhere in the truck and the
[1:17:26] Holy Spirit seemed to move us to go away
[1:17:28] up through the knobs to where she was
[1:17:30] and when I got there she had a dream and
[1:17:32] when the Holy Spirit came into the room
[1:17:33] she got down to real business. She never
[1:17:36] smoked a cigarette from then on and she
[1:17:40] has gained many pounds of weight and
[1:17:42] they can't find a trace of the cancer.
[1:17:44] Now I want to draw your attention to
[1:17:47] this. But Abraham says what is it? It's
[1:17:50] faith that overcomes.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Why didn't it
[1:17:56] overcome what I was praying for her
[1:17:59] here?"
[1:18:02] She was just fluttering around.
[1:18:05] But when the doctor says, "You got
[1:18:08] cancer
[1:18:10] and going to die," she got to business.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That's the way it has to get. When you
[1:18:17] get to business, why wait so long?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Why not get down to business now?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Put your faith in God.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; What if the woman had her faith in me?
[1:18:30] It have failed.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; What if the woman had her faith in me?
[1:18:37] It have failed
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm a man. Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; But when she changed her faith, not in
[1:18:44] the Brandham Tabernacle or William
[1:18:47] Brandham or in anyone else, but placed
[1:18:50] her faith in Jesus Christ, then she got
[1:18:54] faith. She raised up above all the fears
[1:18:57] and doubts and got and God healed her
[1:19:00] and she overcame. Faith is the victory
[1:19:03] that overcomes. Man, I love that so
[1:19:06] much. He says, "Why did she wait?
[1:19:10] Then brother Brandham starts talking
[1:19:12] here and he's mentioning how
[1:19:14] we put our faith when a doctor gives his
[1:19:18] diagnosis.
[1:19:20] A doctor says you've got this sickness.
[1:19:22] You say, "Well, I do." He prescribes you
[1:19:24] a bunch of pills. You take the pills.
[1:19:27] You don't even know what's in the pills.
[1:19:29] But you take the pills. You just don't
[1:19:30] question.
[1:19:32] But then little old God says,
[1:19:36] "You have this problem.
[1:19:38] This is the prescription we want to
[1:19:40] wrestle
[1:19:42] and [snorts] fight.
[1:19:44] We listen to the doctor because he's a
[1:19:47] professional. He's an expert
[1:19:50] at diagnosing diseases
[1:19:52] and prescribing medicine or treatments.
[1:19:56] But God, the creator of heaven and
[1:19:58] earth, the creator of all things, who
[1:20:01] knows you in and out.
[1:20:05] In fact, he said, "I knew you when you
[1:20:06] were in your mother's womb. I formed
[1:20:09] you."
[1:20:10] That God gives a prescription for your
[1:20:13] life of what you need, of what I need.
[1:20:18] And our attitude is, "Well, maybe I'll
[1:20:21] take it another time.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll take it later. It's not dire.
[1:20:28] I don't need to take it right now."
[1:20:31] Are we waiting for the doctor to
[1:20:33] diagnose you with something that's life
[1:20:34] and death?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It's life and death every day. You got
[1:20:38] breath.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you're actually
[1:20:43] dying.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody has an appointed time
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; where you die.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; So each day that goes by, you're only
[1:20:51] getting closer to that appointed time.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be better if our attitude
[1:20:56] was today
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; because I'm not promised tomorrow. Today
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to mean business today
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is here.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:21:20] brother Bam's talking about Christians
[1:21:21] when they come up to him and they're and
[1:21:23] they're flustered in the interviews and
[1:21:26] how he's talking with them. is trying to
[1:21:28] contact their spirit and see what's
[1:21:29] going on. He says he tends to find out
[1:21:32] that they're just floating.
[1:21:36] That's why they're struggling. They
[1:21:38] haven't made ambitions on the on Jesus
[1:21:40] Christ. They're floating about
[1:21:42] everything else. When I'm going to get
[1:21:44] the new job, the new car, the new this.
[1:21:47] Rather than fixing their eyes on Christ,
[1:21:50] they fixed their eyes on everything
[1:21:51] else. And brother Brandham, he tells
[1:21:53] him, he says, "What are you drifting
[1:21:55] for?
[1:21:56] Get some ambition about you. Set your
[1:21:59] goal on Christ and quit tallying with
[1:22:01] the world.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You'll pick up a magazine. It'll say,
[1:22:05] "Now the divine healers of this day,
[1:22:07] there is no such divine hero that'll put
[1:22:09] a doubt in your mind." Someday get on
[1:22:11] the radio and say, "Oh, preach a pretty
[1:22:12] good sermon, but say the days of
[1:22:13] miracles is passed and you'll support
[1:22:15] it." See, that weakens you. Notice this.
[1:22:18] Sell out.
[1:22:20] Get right with God.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Either be what you are or don't be at
[1:22:24] all.
[1:22:26] God's Bible doesn't teach it, then get
[1:22:28] away from it.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; If it does teach it, stay with it.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; It reminds me, for instance, if we're
[1:22:34] ever going to take a little trip,
[1:22:44] I'm trying to find something.
[1:22:51] He says in paragraph 82, "And when you
[1:22:53] just frustrate yourself by joining one
[1:22:55] church and then the other, you'll
[1:22:57] accumulate more junk. But if you'll
[1:22:59] think of where you're going, you'll get
[1:23:01] rid of a lot of that doubt and nonsense.
[1:23:03] You'll have real faith." I say to
[1:23:05] people, "Are you brother Brandon that
[1:23:06] prays for the sick?" Yeah. Well, that's
[1:23:08] against my faith. Then you haven't got
[1:23:10] any faith. The Bible teaches it. And now
[1:23:13] many people come into the line and they
[1:23:14] say, "Well, I got all faith." Then what
[1:23:17] are you doing up here? Uh, it isn't. So
[1:23:20] real faith knows no defeat. It cannot be
[1:23:23] defeated. Even death itself can't defeat
[1:23:26] it. It knows no defeat. Trials know
[1:23:28] defeat. But faith knows no defeat. It
[1:23:31] cannot be defeated. And it is the only
[1:23:34] way that you can please God. For without
[1:23:37] faith, it is impossible to please God.
[1:23:43] Finding a place to close here. He says,
[1:23:44] "Many of you have faith in your
[1:23:46] doctors." And you should have if you got
[1:23:48] a doctor. Now, when something gets wrong
[1:23:49] with you, you'll get to the old faithful
[1:23:51] doctor that you believe in. That's what
[1:23:53] you should do. That's good. And then you
[1:23:54] submit your case to him. If he says you
[1:23:56] should go to the hospital, you don't do
[1:23:58] a thing but go home and pack up your
[1:23:59] clothes and take off to the hospital.
[1:24:01] Notice how we just don't question
[1:24:02] anything. Sure, you got faith in the
[1:24:05] doctor. And if he doesn't decide that
[1:24:06] you want to go to the hospital, or you
[1:24:08] should go rather, he'll write out a
[1:24:10] prescription and give you a sack full of
[1:24:11] pills and you'll swallow them and you
[1:24:13] don't know what's in those pills. But
[1:24:14] you got faith in your doctor. How about
[1:24:16] God?
[1:24:18] and you are scared to swallow some of
[1:24:21] the gospels that he gives you.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, you were healed. Faith
[1:24:26] is the victory that overcomes the world.
[1:24:28] Swallow it and see what happens.
[1:24:31] It's a confidence.
[1:24:34] You show that what confidence you have
[1:24:36] in your doctor by taking his medicine
[1:24:38] that you don't know what it is. You show
[1:24:41] your confidence in the doctor by
[1:24:42] submitting yourself to an operation.
[1:24:44] That proves your confidence to the
[1:24:45] doctor. But when it comes to Christ,
[1:24:47] you're scared to take him at his word.
[1:24:49] How is it? Faith is the victory. You
[1:24:52] could submit your case to Jesus Christ
[1:24:54] tonight, just as you submit your case to
[1:24:56] the doctor. Give me anything you want,
[1:24:58] Lord. You're the doctor on the case.
[1:25:01] Then you've got the victory. Then you
[1:25:03] got faith that overcomes. You'll never
[1:25:05] hunt another prayer line. You'll never
[1:25:08] hunt nothing else. You'll have it right
[1:25:11] there. It'll be settled. You'll never
[1:25:14] jump from church to church. See if this
[1:25:16] one has got it or that one has got it.
[1:25:18] They haven't got it. You've got it. Then
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; when you've got the faith, you have the
[1:25:23] victory.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you what we need tonight in
[1:25:26] America and what we need tonight here in
[1:25:28] this tabernacle is to let Dr. Jesus come
[1:25:31] in and perform an operation on our
[1:25:34] faith.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; The doctor tells you, "You got a little
[1:25:37] appendix. It's all poison. It ought to
[1:25:39] come out. You got this or the other.
[1:25:41] It's wrong. It's got to come out. Well,
[1:25:44] he takes it out so the rest of you
[1:25:46] function right. What's the matter with
[1:25:48] our faith? We're afraid to let God take
[1:25:50] his operating word, his knife, sharper
[1:25:52] than two-edged sword, and operate on us
[1:25:54] and tell us that our little fang dangled
[1:25:56] humugging around is wrong. And we got to
[1:25:59] turn loose every shutter, and sail
[1:26:01] towards God's eternal promise. Oh, if
[1:26:04] we'll do that, Jesus will perform an
[1:26:06] operation upon our faith, taking away
[1:26:09] all the doubt, all the fears, all the
[1:26:11] worry, all the sin, everything there is.
[1:26:14] And when when and then when our faith is
[1:26:16] clearly operated on, we come out a new
[1:26:20] creature. We're different then. We need
[1:26:23] an operation. Can you trust Jesus Christ
[1:26:26] for the operation? Can you believe in
[1:26:28] him? Can you say, "Lord, at thy word, at
[1:26:31] thy word,
[1:26:33] the musicians could come. He says,
[1:26:36] paragraph 97, you may have tried to get
[1:26:39] rid of that illtemper, that slandering
[1:26:41] tongue, tongue, not gossip on the
[1:26:43] telephone. You might have tried every
[1:26:44] remedy you know how, but if you'll just
[1:26:47] let Jesus Christ come into you tonight,
[1:26:49] he'll operate on your faith and give you
[1:26:52] a faith that will climb beyond anything
[1:26:53] that the world can produce. Why? Faith
[1:26:56] is the victory that overcomes the world.
[1:26:58] How could you doubt when Jesus the son
[1:27:01] of the living God is present now his
[1:27:03] great Holy Spirit in this building the
[1:27:06] word promised that lo I am with you
[1:27:10] always even to the end of the world it
[1:27:13] was promised by the Lord God has to keep
[1:27:16] his word do you believe that when he
[1:27:18] promised he promised he would do these
[1:27:20] things God is solemnly obligated to do
[1:27:24] such
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; oh Uh,
[1:27:28] and if you get the chance
[1:27:31] when you get home, I would really read
[1:27:34] from paragraph 99
[1:27:37] on down to 119 as he's praying
[1:27:41] for people. And he's talking about the
[1:27:43] condition that they're in, man. That
[1:27:47] that'll do something to you when he
[1:27:49] starts breaking in and looking at people
[1:27:52] and he's saying, "Look at your life."
[1:27:54] the question he asked him.
[1:27:57] Now I want you to think it over. If you
[1:27:59] have [music] sin, if there's anything
[1:28:01] wrong in your life, I want you to think
[1:28:03] it over while we bow our heads just a
[1:28:05] moment for prayer. And he asked the
[1:28:07] question, I'd like to ask if there was a
[1:28:09] man, woman, boy, or girl that's in the
[1:28:11] building that would say by an uplifted
[1:28:13] hand, "Lord, I just seemingly can't
[1:28:15] overcome. [music]
[1:28:16] It seems like I know that I shouldn't do
[1:28:18] these things. I know I shouldn't do this
[1:28:20] and [music] that, but I want you to
[1:28:22] operate on my faith right now after this
[1:28:25] message. I want you to give me a
[1:28:28] complete [music] checking over and
[1:28:30] operate on every little disease of my
[1:28:33] faith that would keep me from overcoming
[1:28:35] these things. Hold up your hand to him.
[1:28:38] Will you [music] do it? The Lord bless
[1:28:40] you. Place just full of hands. and he
[1:28:43] just starts when brother Benham gets
[1:28:45] into those times
[1:28:47] and now he starts discerning what's
[1:28:49] going on in the audience
[1:28:51] and he's describing that when God points
[1:28:54] this sister [music] out and he's talking
[1:28:56] about what she's going through and it's
[1:28:58] true and he doesn't know her and she
[1:29:00] believes this sister over there gets a
[1:29:02] hold of faith [music] and she gets
[1:29:04] something. In fact, in this sermon,
[1:29:05] brother said he gets more reports from
[1:29:08] people that are sitting in the audience
[1:29:10] of what God has done than those that
[1:29:11] came into their prayer line. He says
[1:29:13] that in the sermon, [music] you go and
[1:29:15] find it. Why? Because they get a hold of
[1:29:16] faith. It's not where you're at, whether
[1:29:19] you're there or here. It's get a hold of
[1:29:20] faith. Get a hold of him. If you can get
[1:29:23] a hold of him, you'll have a report.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; If we'll [music] just stand. Um I'd like
[1:29:30] to sing healing is here.
[1:29:37] Oh, Jesus
[1:29:39] is here.
[1:29:42] [music]
[1:29:44] Here.
[1:29:46] Jesus [singing]
[1:29:47] is here.
[1:29:51] Yes, he is. Oh, [music and singing] and
[1:29:54] Jesus sit here
[1:30:01] and I receive [music]
[1:30:03] it.
[1:30:07] Oh, and Jesus
[1:30:11] is here. [music]
[1:30:16] Jesus [music]
[1:30:18] is here.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Jesus is here.
[1:30:29] Here
[1:30:31] and I [singing]
[1:30:32] believe. [music]
[1:30:35] I reach my hands.
[1:30:38] I reach my hands [music]
[1:30:42] to the heart. I lift [music and singing]
[1:30:47] my eyes
[1:30:49] where my help comes from. Oh, I look to
[1:30:55] you. You are my rock, [music] my healer.
[1:31:01] I trust in you. Oh, [music]
[1:31:05] I [singing] reach my hand.
[1:31:08] I reach my [music]
[1:31:10] hand
[1:31:12] to the heaven.
[1:31:16] I lift my eyes [music]
[1:31:19] where my help comes from. Oh, I look
[1:31:24] [music] to you. You are my [singing]
[1:31:27] rock, my he.
[1:31:31] Oh, I trust in you.
[1:31:34] Sickness can't stay [music] any longer.
[1:31:37] Oh,
[1:31:40] and [music] sickness can't stay any
[1:31:44] longer.
[1:31:47] Oh, [music]
[1:31:47] your perfect love is casting down.
[1:31:54] Oh, and [music] you are the God of your
[1:31:59] power. You got to believe it. [music]
[1:32:02] And it is your will that my life is.
[1:32:09] Oh,
[1:32:10] [singing and music] sickness can't stay
[1:32:13] any longer.
[1:32:17] Oh, and your perfect [music and singing]
[1:32:19] love is casting down.
[1:32:24] Oh, and you [music] are the [singing]
[1:32:27] God of all power.
[1:32:32] Oh, and it is your will [music] that my
[1:32:36] life is here.
[1:32:41] And so [music and singing] I reach my
[1:32:44] hand
[1:32:47] to [music] the heaven.
[1:32:50] I lift my [singing]
[1:32:52] eyes where my hand comes from. [music]
[1:32:56] Oh, I look to you. You are [music] my
[1:33:02] rock of [singing] my healing.
[1:33:05] I trust in [music]
[1:33:07] you.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Just your voice is lifted up to him. Oh,
[1:33:11] [singing]
[1:33:11] and so I reach my hands [music]
[1:33:17] to the [singing] heavens.
[1:33:20] I lift my eyes [music]
[1:33:23] where my help [singing] comes from. Oh,
[1:33:27] when I look to you,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; you are my rock, [singing and music]
[1:33:33] my healer.
[1:33:36] I trust in [music]
[1:33:38] you.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:33:44] Heavenly Father,
[1:33:48] all we've got is trust in you, Lord
[1:33:50] Jesus.
[1:33:55] Father, we need you, Lord.
[1:34:02] Father, it's time, Lord Jesus.
[1:34:06] For our entire beings, Lord, all that we
[1:34:10] are, Father, we've held on to too much,
[1:34:13] Lord Jesus. It's time to [music]
[1:34:15] surrender it all, Father.
[1:34:18] Give it to you, Lord. Purpose in our
[1:34:20] hearts, Father.
[1:34:23] We're tired of the routine, Lord [music]
[1:34:25] Jesus, that we've made it, Father.
[1:34:28] You still show up every service
[1:34:31] waiting, looking for that one that you
[1:34:34] could touch.
[1:34:36] Father,
[1:34:39] light a fire in our hearts that every
[1:34:42] time we come to service,
[1:34:44] we can say, "Jesus is here. I receive it
[1:34:48] and I [music] believe it." and whatever
[1:34:50] problems we're dealing with can't stay
[1:34:53] any longer. Lord,
[1:34:55] that's what's needed in [music] this
[1:34:56] hour. Father, if we could but have that
[1:35:00] kind of faith, Lord, like our prophet
[1:35:02] said, we wouldn't have needed nothing
[1:35:04] else. We would have it, Lord Jesus.
[1:35:09] Father, I leave the [music] people in
[1:35:10] your hands. I pray something was said to
[1:35:13] somebody. Father,
[1:35:16] if it was just me that was dealt with,
[1:35:17] Father, [music] I needed it, Lord Jesus.
[1:35:21] I needed it, Father.
[1:35:24] My way [music] only leads to more
[1:35:25] problems, Lord. Your way is greater,
[1:35:29] Jesus.
[1:35:31] We love you, Father. You see your
[1:35:34] people. You see their hearts. [music]
[1:35:37] If [snorts] there's a soul crying out
[1:35:40] saying, "I got sickness in my faith.
[1:35:44] I've let things come in that have
[1:35:45] tampered [music] with the faith
[1:35:47] and I need healing that I can have more
[1:35:50] faith. [snorts] That I can get up out of
[1:35:53] my condition and I can walk.
[1:35:58] Father, that's the kind of faith we
[1:36:01] need. The faith that moves us to action.
[1:36:04] Father, not an idol faith. one that
[1:36:07] works, Lord Jesus,
[1:36:09] as we heard a God with skin on them,
[1:36:12] Lord,
[1:36:14] that we can say, "I've seen the [music]
[1:36:16] tangible." God, [snorts] I've witnessed
[1:36:18] it. I know what it's like. Father,
[1:36:21] raise our faith. Father, it is a reality
[1:36:24] in this hour. [music] Father,
[1:36:26] for the faith that was delivered to us
[1:36:28] in this hour is to make a rapture, Lord
[1:36:32] Jesus.
[1:36:34] Father,
[1:36:36] we need a lot more faith. If we can't
[1:36:39] believe in simple healings and simple
[1:36:41] things in our lives, [music] how could
[1:36:43] we have the faith for rapture, Father?
[1:36:46] But Lord, I'm thankful. Faith is a gift
[1:36:49] you give, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:51] If we could just surrender our hearts
[1:36:53] [music] and say, I want that faith.
[1:36:56] [snorts]
[1:36:57] I want that faith that looks in the face
[1:37:00] of a problem and say, "Get behind me,
[1:37:03] [music] Satan."
[1:37:05] I want that faith that looks at the face
[1:37:07] of cancer and says, [music] "It is
[1:37:09] finished."
[1:37:12] [snorts] I want that faith, Lord Jesus,
[1:37:15] that changes things. Lord,
[1:37:20] I leave your people in your hands
[1:37:24] in Jesus [music] name. Amen.
[1:37:31] Let's just sing that as we invite
[1:37:32] brother Matthew to come. I reach my
[1:37:36] hands
[1:37:37] to [music and singing] the heavens.
[1:37:41] I lift my life.
[1:37:50] Oh, [singing] I rock my heel.
[1:37:55] I trust in you.
[1:37:59] Sickness can't stay
[1:38:03] as [music and singing]
[1:38:04] sickness can't stay any longer.
[1:38:12] Perfect love is casting [music] out
[1:38:15] fear.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You are the God [singing]
[1:38:21] of all power.
[1:38:26] And [music] it is [singing] your will
[1:38:28] and my life is
[1:38:33] sickness can't stay [music]
[1:38:36] any longer.
[1:38:40] Your perfect blood is casting our feet.
[1:38:46] Oh,
[1:38:48] you are [music] the God of all power.
[1:38:55] It is true and my life is.
[1:39:04] So I reach my hands [music]
[1:39:08] to the
[1:39:12] I lift my eyes [music and singing]
[1:39:15] where my help comes from
[1:39:20] to you. [music]
[1:39:23] I walk by.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:33] Wonderful. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the word that we heard.
[1:39:39] Faith is a reality.
[1:39:42] You know, as he ministered, I thought,
[1:39:44] you know, faith is a reality. [music]
[1:39:47] What what's the opposite of faith? It's
[1:39:49] unbelief.
[1:39:51] And it's unfortunate, but a lot of
[1:39:53] people's reality is just the world that
[1:39:55] they see around them,
[1:39:57] you know, their [music] their job, their
[1:39:59] career,
[1:40:00] what they see on the news and the
[1:40:02] internet. And that's just their reality.
[1:40:05] It's their [music]
[1:40:06] their life. It's it's their joy is like
[1:40:09] the stock market. It's just up, it's
[1:40:11] down, it's up, it's down. But we know
[1:40:14] faith is a revelation. And so when when
[1:40:16] it's revealed to you, then we're living
[1:40:19] by that sixth sense. And I I just
[1:40:22] thought something struck me I just
[1:40:23] thought I'd share because it meant a lot
[1:40:25] to me. [music] Um but you know when
[1:40:28] brother Brandham said he he said you
[1:40:29] know faith beats down faith handcuffs
[1:40:32] faith casted into prison. [music]
[1:40:35] You know it's you're either going to be
[1:40:37] you're either going to be handcuffed or
[1:40:38] you can handcuff it. And and I thought
[1:40:41] when he said he said [music] you master
[1:40:43] it then it serves you. What how how is
[1:40:48] country music gonna serve me? How how is
[1:40:51] drugs and how is addictions how are
[1:40:53] those things going to ser serve me?
[1:40:55] Think think of the woman at the well
[1:40:57] [music] here she has been married four
[1:40:59] times the the or the the woman the man
[1:41:01] she's with ain't even five times. The
[1:41:04] man she's with not even uh her husband
[1:41:06] and she's in a li her life is a shamble.
[1:41:09] She's in bondage. But yet, when she
[1:41:12] comes into the presence of the Lord
[1:41:15] Jesus side, Lord Jesus Christ, and that
[1:41:17] seed's quickened,
[1:41:20] what does it do? It takes her past
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; and now it serves her [music]
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; because now she's able to run into the
[1:41:27] city and say, "Come see a man
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; who told me all the things that I done."
[1:41:31] And it struck me while while the word
[1:41:33] was going forth. I I here was in in um
[1:41:37] in North Carolina and we were sitting
[1:41:39] around the brothers fellowshipping out
[1:41:40] shopping and and this man came up and he
[1:41:43] went the wrong way and we were sitting
[1:41:44] in this little gazebo and he come up and
[1:41:46] and
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; uh he he just realized he kind of came
[1:41:49] to a dead end and looked at us. I said,
[1:41:51] "Come on in." He said, "Well, where's
[1:41:53] the drinks at?" [music] I said, "Well, I
[1:41:55] I uh you know, I got a little coffee
[1:41:58] here. That's about all I got. But the
[1:41:59] the kind of drinks you're looking for, I
[1:42:01] said, "God delivered me of that 25 years
[1:42:05] ago." And [music] it went from just that
[1:42:08] statement to him coming in and sitting
[1:42:10] sitting in and then we had the
[1:42:12] opportunity to introduce him to the
[1:42:13] message of the hour and invite him to
[1:42:16] church. And and [music]
[1:42:17] isn't it wonderful when God can take
[1:42:19] your past
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; and it becomes a testimony? So the very
[1:42:23] things that that that that God has
[1:42:25] delivered you from or you've struggled
[1:42:27] with, God is able to take that and it
[1:42:30] actually serve you. And if you find
[1:42:33] yourself struggling with music, I I I
[1:42:35] say as as how brother Ben ended the
[1:42:38] service, let's let God do an operation
[1:42:41] on [music] our faith. If there's things
[1:42:43] that you're struggling with in your
[1:42:45] life, Jesus Christ is here and he can
[1:42:48] perform an operation to take that
[1:42:51] struggle where you're where you're no
[1:42:53] longer serving it or battling it, but it
[1:42:55] serves you and you finish it once and
[1:42:57] for all and say, "You know what? I I've
[1:42:59] been struggling. I haven't had total
[1:43:01] victory over this, but you know what,
[1:43:02] God? Would you come and and perform an
[1:43:04] operation in my life, and I want to take
[1:43:07] this struggle and I want it to serve me
[1:43:09] now? I want to handcuff it. I want to
[1:43:11] throw it into prison. Therefore, I can
[1:43:13] go and testify. God, YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO
[1:43:15] ME. GOD, YOU'VE HEALED ME. You delivered
[1:43:17] for me this. I struggled with with this
[1:43:19] for years, but now we can go tell our
[1:43:21] family and we can testify. [music] And
[1:43:23] and I want to sing that song. And as uh
[1:43:26] before we're dismissed, I was made for
[1:43:28] more. And I don't know, Brianna, you
[1:43:30] probably you think you could help me
[1:43:32] sing it? Why don't you come help me sing
[1:43:34] it? I I want to I know our voice has
[1:43:36] been struggling, but I I [clears throat]
[1:43:38] just say as um we sing this, why don't
[1:43:40] you just maybe personally just uh why
[1:43:43] don't you invite God to come maybe do an
[1:43:45] operation
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; on your faith? I believe that's a
[1:43:48] challenge to every one of us here that
[1:43:50] we can live higher
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; there. There's faith is the victory that
[1:43:55] overcomes the world. Faith beats down.
[1:43:58] It conquers. And we ought to be the most
[1:44:00] victorious people on the face of this
[1:44:03] earth. And I I just not to get too
[1:44:06] carried away, but but [music] what is I
[1:44:08] believe it's Romans 4:19. It says,
[1:44:11] "Abraham not being weak in faith,
[1:44:14] [music] he staggered not." So if you're
[1:44:16] weak in faith, you stagger. But if
[1:44:18] you're strong in faith, you give praise
[1:44:21] to God, KNOWING HE'S MORE THAN able to
[1:44:24] perform that which he's promised. And I
[1:44:26] I say, "Lord, as [music] we finish out
[1:44:28] the ser God, do an operation on my
[1:44:30] faith." I like how brother Ben brought
[1:44:32] it down and he said, "Tonight,
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; don't wait for Sunday. Don't wait for
[1:44:37] Thursday. Don't wait for another."
[1:44:39] TONIGHT, LORD, COME DO AN operation on
[1:44:40] me, Lord. I want to go in a rapture. I
[1:44:43] want to go in a body church. I want to
[1:44:44] be more victorious. I want to have
[1:44:46] perfect faith
[1:44:48] tonight, Lord. It's my night. IT'S MY
[1:44:50] TIME. I WAS MADE FOR MORE. I WAS MADE TO
[1:44:53] be an overcomer. I was made to be a
[1:44:54] conqueror, Lord. I WASN'T MADE TO BE UP
[1:44:56] AND DOWN AND IN AND OUT. LORD, I WAS
[1:44:58] MADE THAT FAITH WOULD BE A REALITY. Not
[1:45:01] the STOCK MARKET, NOT MY JOB, NOT MY
[1:45:04] PAYCHECK. That's not my reality. My
[1:45:06] reality is this living word, the
[1:45:09] revealed word of the hour. That the the
[1:45:11] reality IS WHAT MY REALITY IS WHAT GOD
[1:45:13] SAID. MY REALITY is that I am an
[1:45:15] overcomer. I can do the greater works.
[1:45:17] [music] Why don't we just sing that?
[1:45:18] Help help us sing this.
[1:45:22] I know who I am
[1:45:26] cuz I know who you are. [singing]
[1:45:32] The cross of salvation
[1:45:35] [singing]
[1:45:37] was only the [music] start.
[1:45:42] Now I am chosen.
[1:45:45] [music]
[1:45:47] I'm free and forgiven. [singing]
[1:45:52] I have a [music] future
[1:45:57] and it's [music] worth the living.
[1:46:00] [singing]
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, cuz I wasn't made [music] to be
[1:46:06] tended in a grave. [singing] I was
[1:46:09] called by name. Born and raised back
[1:46:13] [music] to [singing] life again.
[1:46:16] I was made for more. [music]
[1:46:22] And [singing] so why would I lay a bed
[1:46:26] in [music] my shame when a fountain of
[1:46:30] grace is running in my
[1:46:32] [singing and music] way? I know I am
[1:46:35] yours and I [singing and music] was made
[1:46:38] for more.
[1:46:42] I know who [music and singing] I am. Oh
[1:46:45] Lord, do an operation tonight.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; I know who you [singing] are.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; The [music] cross of salvation [singing]
[1:46:57] was only the start. [music]
[1:47:02] Now I am chosen,
[1:47:05] [music and singing]
[1:47:07] free and
[1:47:12] I [music] have a future
[1:47:17] and it's [singing] worth the [music]
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Why don't you worship
[1:47:22] the Lord? [singing]
[1:47:24] I wasn't made to be tended and grave. I
[1:47:28] was called by name. born and raised
[1:47:33] [music] back to life [singing] again.
[1:47:36] I was raised [music] for more.
[1:47:42] And so why would I [music] make a bed in
[1:47:47] my shame [singing] when a fountain of
[1:47:50] grace is running in my way? [music]
[1:47:53] I know I am yours and I was made more.
[1:48:05] [music]
[1:48:08] You call out [singing] my name [music]
[1:48:10] and I'll sing out your praise.
[1:48:15] Hallelujah. [music]
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; You bring my passes and I'm not [music]
[1:48:22] going back.
[1:48:25] Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] [music and singing]
[1:48:28] You call out my name. So I'll sing out
[1:48:32] your praise.
[1:48:35] Hallelu. [music]
[1:48:37] [singing] You buried my past and I'm not
[1:48:41] going back.
[1:48:45] Oh, cuz I [singing] wasn't made to be
[1:48:48] [music] tended in a grave. I was called
[1:48:51] [singing] by name, born [music] and
[1:48:55] raised back to [singing] life again.
[1:48:59] I was [music] made for more.
[1:49:05] And so why [music] would I make a bed in
[1:49:09] [singing] my shame when a fountain of
[1:49:12] grace is running in my way? I know I am
[1:49:17] [singing and music]
[1:49:17] yours. I was made for one more time.
[1:49:22] Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] [singing]
[1:49:31] You call [music] out my name, so I'll
[1:49:33] sing out your praise. [singing]
[1:49:38] [music]
[1:49:40] [singing] You buried my passing. I'm not
[1:49:44] going back.
[1:49:47] [music] Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:49:50] You called out my name. So
[1:49:53] [music and singing] I'll sing out your
[1:49:54] praise.
[1:49:58] Thank you, Lord. [singing] You buried
[1:50:01] [music] my passion. I'm not going back
[1:50:07] cuz [singing]
[1:50:08] I wasn't [music] made to be tended a
[1:50:12] grave. [singing] I was called by name.
[1:50:16] born [music] and raised back to life

[1:50:37] way? I know I am yours and I was made
[1:50:43] for all.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just praise the Lord? Why
[1:50:48] don't you just thank God for the message
[1:50:50] of the hour? Thank God for his word.
[1:50:52] Brother Matt Thomasac, if you'd come and
[1:50:56] we'll dismiss in [music] prayer,
[1:50:58] remember those that aren't with us this
[1:51:02] evening. Just look upon the needs in the
[1:51:04] body. Amen.
[1:51:06] As brother [music] Matt just closes out
[1:51:08] the service, just invite him to come
[1:51:11] perform that operation in you and make
[1:51:12] this word a living reality. [music]
[1:51:14] Amen.
[1:51:16] God bless you.
[1:51:23] Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:51:27] we were made for more
[1:51:31] because you made us.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:36] You're our maker,
[1:51:38] our Lord, and our God.
[1:51:42] Lord, I just [music] pray in the name of
[1:51:45] Jesus Christ that
[1:51:48] you'd strengthen your people, Lord, to
[1:51:51] lay aside every weight that and every
[1:51:54] sin that so easily besets us, Lord God.
[1:51:57] We
[1:51:58] are so needy and
[1:52:02] so frail, Lord.
[1:52:07] Lord, this
[1:52:09] world's [music] going one way and trying
[1:52:11] to drag us down with it,
[1:52:16] but we're made for more.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And when the enemy comes in like a
[1:52:23] flood, Lord, you raise up the standard
[1:52:26] against it,
[1:52:30] Lord. And when you raise it up,
[1:52:34] we're magnetized [music] to you,
[1:52:37] we'll raise with it, Lord. Help us to
[1:52:39] shake off the things of the [music]
[1:52:41] world and press on.
[1:52:44] Lord, like brother Ben said, Lord, if we
[1:52:47] get hit, if we get knocked down, [music]
[1:52:51] quickly pop back up because we're
[1:52:54] predestinated [music] to win this fight.
[1:52:57] Lord, we claim every loved one.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. [music]
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Present or not present, Lord.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; For your honor and your glory.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; You said you wouldn't lose a one.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:13] We speak in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; that they would come into the fold. Lord
[1:53:18] God, it's time to go home and we want to
[1:53:20] leave here.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] [music]
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not going to dwell in the
[1:53:30] past, but we're going to press towards
[1:53:33] the mark of the high calling in Christ.
[1:53:38] the calling that [music] you've called
[1:53:39] us to walk in.
[1:53:43] We love you, Lord, and thank you for
[1:53:45] your goodness and your mercy and your
[1:53:46] grace.
[1:53:49] Be with my brothers and sisters, [music]
[1:53:51] each one of us, Lord, as we leave here,
[1:53:54] Lord.
[1:53:55] May we purpose in our heart to come up a
[1:53:59] little higher. We love you. We thank you
[1:54:01] for your word. What a blessing it's been
[1:54:04] this week, Lord. This is
[1:54:10] Truly, it [music] was good to be in the
[1:54:12] house of the Lord. We love you. In Jesus
[1:54:14] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. There's just a a
[1:54:22] wonderful presence here. We'll dismiss
[1:54:25] [music] you. Those that want to continue
[1:54:26] to worship, we'll just worship the Lord.
[1:54:30] Amen.
[1:54:35] Let's try to sing. Stay.
[1:54:42] Stay. [singing]
[1:54:45] I don't want you [singing] to go

[1:55:45] presence of the Lord

[1:56:31] alone.
[1:56:36] No one had to [music and singing] say a
[1:56:38] word.
[1:56:43] Couldn't even [music] make a sound.
[1:56:51] But I'd give up [music]
