a solemn time always though to come before you lord knowing that you hold heaven and earth in your hands lord you hold our lives in your hands but lord we can come with boldness lord we can come with joy lord as we heard this morning lord by faith knowing that the the possession is already ours oh god and we're just walking towards a manifestation oh god lord every need that would be in every person's heart lord you knew those before the foundation of the world lord we had a prophet come and tell us lord how you would know every time a flea would bat its eyes father and how much more would you hear the cries of your people oh god the hearts cry of your children lord lord you said if your children would cry for bread you wouldn't give them a stone lord if it was an egg you wouldn't give

know that you care for us so we can cast our cares upon you oh god lord and as i'm sure there are many needs in in the church lord personal needs whether it be maybe financial physical spiritual lord lord your god that meets every need of every situation no matter how big or how small lord you you're the great i am oh god lord your jehovah jireh lord you provide for the things lord that eat and sometimes we didn't even know we had need of lord but you're there to provide it lord in a perfectly timely manner oh god and lord we just need you right now more than ever lord as we see the world collapsing around us lord but we're inside that refuge lord we're inside that fortress lord that that is underneath your shed blood lord god we just come before you this evening to once again hear your word and commune with you lord we pray that you would bless the speaker of the word as he comes forth may just completely give himself over to the holy ghost lord to speak to your people and may your people lord give themselves over to hear and receive lord what they have need of we ask that you bless the tithes and offerings father for the furthering of your kingdom may your perfect will be done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen [Music] i'm gonna do something a little different i haven't really played guitar in like seven years but i told the lord this morning that if brother billy had me come up and sing i was gonna do this you know i don't know if many of you know but about seven years ago within a couple weeks after i proposed to my wife i was at work i worked in a place that uh built concrete conforms that hold concrete like for construction concrete forms and they're metal so there's a lot of metal going around they're not the wooden ones they do the heavy industrial ones for bridges and things and i was walking through an area and a guy who had overhead crane with a piece of the metal on it and uh they held it in suction cups so it went sideways and it was so it was really thin maybe about an eighth inch thick and i was walking through an area and the guy had the piece of the overhead crane and he stopped the crane and i was trying to go to the restroom and so i walked across the area we both stopped initially and i thought he was going to let me go and as soon as i started walking he moved the crane and i was walking through i didn't have anywhere really to go there's a big stack of metal behind me and he stopped the crane but obviously the momentum carried it and instinctively i just put my hands out and it was the grace of god i was actually thinking about it this morning my brother david was preaching about how the lord keeps you and different things like that and i think you know i was thinking about i was like you know had i not hit my hand that thing probably would have chopped my head off because it was right at neck level so i have no doubt that the devil was trying to kill me that day but i put my hand out and my right hand kind of pushed it and it kind of pivoted and kind of guillotined my left hand against it and just hit it and it sliced it all the way down to the bone and uh cut all the nerves and the ligaments and everything in there and my hand was just flopping around and uh you know i tell you i just kind of feel inspired to say this but i told the lord you know i know i know it was the lord that was with me because my first instinct was i screamed in pain because it was really painful but the second thing that happened was i just knelt down i started praying and i remember the only thing i really remember specifically about the whole situation was i just got down before the lord i said lord i said lord i have no idea why this happened because i knew i knew it was bad i never looked at it by the grace of the lord because i knew if i did it was going to be even worse it was good you know it's one of those things where you scrape your knee it doesn't really feel bad till you look at it and so i never looked at it but i said lord i said i know this is really bad i said but lord if and i don't know why it happened but if this is part of what it takes to help me get to a rapture then lord give me the strength to endure it and i know that was the lord because i know that's not a normal human reaction to something like that but you know i i had basically lost feeling in my hand and i have a little bit of it back by the grace of god but i've i've had a dream and i had a brother in ohio that had a dream that i had i was completely healed and i know my healing was done and i just told the lord i said you know what i'm so tired of sitting there and letting the devil have any kind of victory and then the even and so i'm going to play i'm going to pl i haven't played in a long time and it may not sound amazing but we're going to try and i i felt encouraged because brother david said you know even if you can't do something you you do a special anyway so i'm going to do this anyhow just in the face of the devil at the very least and uh you know why because my healing's already done it's just sometimes the flesh likes to lag behind and manifesting so but we know the flesh is enmity with with the devil so we're gonna sing this song and you just pray for me and i'm gonna do the best i can so [Music] jesus alone you are worthy [Music] your bride has made herself ready come carry your love into glory lord let your bride come forth your holy ghost cleansed her she's purified your blood has redeemed her you paid her price she'll be called by your name lord jesus

god bless you so much amen thank you musicians amen amen well we we always just want to do our our best to show a good example and and uh so we're just trusting the lord will be uh with us this evening um i'd like to uh just fellowship a little bit uh with you and we're going to read uh several scriptures and everything but i'd like to if i wanted to have a title i would like to preach on front line workers front front line workers and just kind of a thought and you know as we listened to this morning i had left my book back in my office but i wanted to read that statement i'll just quote it to you brother branham talked about david being a good shepherd running to snatch the the sheep out from the bear and from the lion and he said any good shepherd wants to do that uh he wants to uh keep the enemy away from the sheep and you you know even as a pastor a lot of times you go through a lot of personal trials i mean you know the deputy i believe in the devil i i hate to say that but you know some people say i don't believe in the devil well then you're you're not very bright the devil's real and he fights in fact the bible said he's like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour so naturally if you're you're given to watch out over the flock then uh you know you got to know that he's out there and and and so he said now he said that that that that's as he brought the story he said that's what we're here to do tonight he says the enemies come in like a lion and and it has grabbed the sheep it may be your a friend it may be a loved one it may be somebody in school it may be somebody you know who's got sick it may be somebody who somebody told them a lie and and they've got a different attitude we don't care what the circumstances is we don't care in what form that the lion has come we don't care in what form the bearer has come but there's something in us that that we we go out and we we want to deliver that uh person from that enemy now you know we don't know david may may have been us suffering uh you know that morning he might have been laying there with covert 15. yeah you know he might have been a sicker and a hound dog you know what i mean and and he could barely get up you know what i mean but it didn't matter you understand when the call of duty came he rose to the occasion and so when you look at that story david was a front line worker he was right on the front line he was meeting the enemy on the front line you know what i mean he wasn't he he you know he had the support of his father and his brothers they may have sent them out food but and that's all good we believe in the support but also the uh there has to be frontline workers there have to be people that meet the devil uh face to face as uh straight on and and so we locked and he said so that's the the spirit of it is that that we want to be that we want and so when you take that that farther you know so many times we just put uh like a pastor we we put him in an office and then he's attributed to do all these things you know he's attributed to pray for the sick and he's attributed to to uh counsel and he's a tribute and all these things are are listed for the pastor to do but you can't find that anywhere in the scripture that he takes over all those things amen the commission was not to pastors it didn't say i send the pastors in all the world to preach the gospel i send pastors to lay hands on the sick i i said this he says no i send you into all the world to lay hands on the set someone asked me can a sister lay hands on the sick and pray for somebody most certainly i i i'll guarantee you there's a lot of sisters that i'd rather have pray for me than some of the brothers i've known through my lifetime you know what i mean i mean they're that just the way that that uh it is so no uh that's uh uh and you talk about testifying now there's certain doctrines that a a sister might not handle uh because she's not meant to handle the word of god but testifying is a lot different than teaching you know what i mean telling people what what kind of god you have what kind of gods you serve the things that god has done you know if someone maybe asked you to explain the godhead you might say you know it's not given to me to explain uh the godhead but you know i can get one of my my husband to do that or i can get my uh a brother to do that one of the deacons or maybe a brother you have confidence in not everything comes back to the pastor because believe it or not you know the prophet of god said a pastor's attitude is is that he pastors the whole city so as far as i'm concerned i've got seven million people in my congregation i can't do it all you know what i'm saying i can't reach out to seven million people i can't lay my hands on the sick when seven million people i can't testify to seven million people if you know what i'm saying so what we need is those we need frontline workers amen we need people who will be on the front line who will meet the challenge uh who who will be there to to to be in service and so i i just uh that's kind of uh what my little thought is tonight and and uh and we're appreciative of that and so uh we we never want to discount ourselves that's what we're called to do we are fighting an adversary we have an enemy amen we want to put on the full armor of god we want to be ready we want to have the helmet of salvation we want the breastplate of the faith we want the sword of the word of god we want to be there to be ready for duty we want to be a front-line worker and believe it or not there's people that that only you can touch i've seen it many times i've just seen it just seems like sometimes i'll come across in my own life and i'll meet somebody and i'll tell you we just hit it off you know i talked with a fellow the other day mr henry david henry is a good man and and i i got the fellowship and with him we're trying to look at maybe doing some paving and helping us fix a little bit in the lot and do a little things for us and and we've got the fellowship and we got to talk and and uh got to testifying how that you know i got converted and it wasn't long he reached his pocket and said you know god's just started working in my life a year ago and and i i just got my sober for one year uh badge and and and it was it was just a wonderful bond it was just like wow this guy's like a buddy you know what i mean i don't know if it'll go anywhere from there if there's a seed there i know it'll go somewhere you know what i mean but it was wonderful fellowshipping with them talking with them and and and and just sharing and i gave them the healing thoughts book and and just it just something sometimes you have that bond and you know god made that you understand that and and there's people that you'll bond with that you can contact that nobody else can ever contact that nobody else will ever have a feel for and and anybody that says that that you know that's what satan does he always tries to push everybody down a rabbit hole you know what i mean if he always tries to make you feel that there's nobody you can talk to you're all insignificant nobody will listen to you i'll tell you if there was a fire and you were the person to cry fire everybody would listen to you just think of it well there is a fire coming a real bad one a consuming fire amen if it's this world is on fire right now amen the the burning flames of sin are consuming people the lies are are affecting their hearts and and their minds it uh it it's a it's a time like uh like you you can imagine and you know when someone's lost they don't care who they get their directions from do you know how i can get out of here yeah you know and and so you you're important you ought you've got to understand you've got qualities god made you he gave you the personality he gave you he gave you the way that you are you don't have to be bright you know what i mean you don't have to be a great intellectual you don't have to have an enticing words you you you you understand if excuse the expression but if you're dumber in the mud fence there's a lot of people out there that are dumber in a mud fence that need testifying too you know believe it or not most of the people out there are dumber in the mud fins because they ain't in the house of god they ain't serving god and that obviously proves to you they're not too bright and then you possess eternal life that makes you a genius you know what i mean so so you you you can talk to them and reach out to them and and and and touch them it can make a a difference and so uh that's what i said like we well we need uh frontline workers in fact it's time we become front line workers amen so i'd just like to read a few scriptures and talk about a few of the front line workers in the bible men that were willing to put themselves in harm's way for the truth and we just got four examples and we i'm sure we could find many more in fact we could go to the fox book of martyrs and read uh testimony after testimony have you have if you haven't read the fox book of martyrs take a little time in your life to sit down if and if you can't read the whole thing go through there and read many several of the testimonies of what people did to stand for this gospel amen you know remember that that horserider went out and it was taking every life and he would have taken all the life of the word of god off the face of the earth that the word spoke hurt not the wine nor the oil so god kept that anointing here so it could go forth and anoint the believers but read that fox book of martyrs and and and lay it down so that's what we're talking about today what what our heart today was is that we've got to be perseverant we can't bail you know what i mean we can't we just can't i i can't believe it like the this virus comes along and and it seems like it provided an excuse for people not to go to church well i can understand staying home i i really can but i can also understand i try to make a service now and then you know what i mean the word of god says forsake yourselves not the assembling of yourselves together so it doesn't say if the president says it's okay or if the governor says it's okay or if this person says it's okay or if there's sickness in the land okay you know what the first church if if they would have had a virus like this in the days of the first church everybody would have had their relatives at church there would have been more virus people there than well people they'd have been everywhere they would've been waiting just to put their put their loved one in the uh shadow of peter they they would have wanted them to lay hands on them anoint them with oil and everything see what happens is because we don't realize how far we have gotten away from the front line how far we have gotten away from where the battle is how far we've gotten away from what our testimony is yeah that's what satan's been doing he's just been moving the needle and moving the needle and moving the needle just pushing us farther away goodness where we won't speak out against homosexuality homosexuality is a demon possession that's all it is it can be cast out of somebody they can be delivered from money it's a filthy lust of a perverted mind oh you can't say that put it up on youtube i don't care it's the devil and you can be free from it someone said would you let a homosexual come to church i'd let them come to church until they heard the gospel and they could no longer practice sit together or to perform any of that things bottom line just how it is it's a spirit it's a devil and it can get off on people you know it is not a way of life and something given by god to control population it's a perverted demonic spirit it's all it is and the gospel has power over those spirits amen you don't have to be politically correct we're so politically correct we don't have anybody on the front line anymore we're so politically correct that we don't have anybody calling out against sin anymore i'll tell you that's one thing i appreciate about this messenger of the hour he stood there and told it the way it is he didn't he called him he called him he said sin was sin and he you know how he spoke about it he know the the the terminologies he used and he was very point blank that there's one thing that stands and it stands alone and god's word stands by itself you don't need me to prop it up it don't need anybody else to prop it up speak it say it just the way that it's written and that's what we need amen in fact we need to find the front line i don't even know if we know where the battlefield is anymore satan's appeared as an angel of light deceiving the very elect if it was possible he's running around there you know taking people's lives dressed up like an angel and if you're not prayed up then you're not ready to be in the battle you're not a front-line worker you're not there in prayer you haven't come to go to work you know these people that come to go to work that help these people that do it they put the mask on they dress up they get in the gloves they're all gowned up and everything in fact when they come in i got i got a test you know where they stick that thing into your brain and uh rattle it around up there for a while and uh it burns and everything when they came into me i thought man i didn't know whether they were afraid i had it or they had it they were dressed for battle you understand they're dressed like front line workers they they have some kind of comprehension in their mind we've had people in our church okay sister walker wonderful woman out there helping those people she had to go through a stint of it we're not immune but we've got something that that's above medicine we've got medicine plus a god that makes it work not only in our bodies but in our minds in our hearts and our souls and our attitudes amen so we've got to be prepared to be front-line workers and i'm not talking about the virus i'm talking about the sin virus i'm talking about the enemy meeting the enemy i'm talking about fighting against the battle we've got to know where's the battle why it's in school it's with young children it's early in life so uh so and i just feel that it's time that that the scripture says when satan goes about like a roaring lion when the enemy comes in like a flood that god raised up a standard against it amen you say what's the standard in this day brother mcgary it's the bride of jesus christ it's the called out elect lady who has received the revealed word of god for the hour because she's the one that's got the answers amen they know the deception they they know it they uh they understand when the gospel's watered down they understand when it's a social gospel well they understand when it's a money gospel that they know they know that they know the truth they've got strong meat they they can discern between meat and milk they can discern between what's right and what's wrong and they're not worried about being political correct they're they're they're standing there they're front-line workers let's just take one of them for a second just for the uh the goodness of the gospel let's turn to matthew um in in the scriptures matthew 3. now this is a frontline worker right here you say what's his name his name's john john john of i don't know what his last win probably is for all i know he's an irishman so he was might have been john mceary i don't know but he could be john you tonight right he could he he could be any of your your name he could he could have been john russ it doesn't matter he's a front line worker you understand that's what he is so so we're putting ourselves in the story you understand so this is a frontline worker we we call him john the baptist because that's what he was doing but let's just read about him he says if for in those days king john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken by the prophet isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight you see that man working on that front line announcing the coming of the lord tell them well we know the lord's coming we ought to be announcing the coming of the lord too we've come under the anointing of the messenger that was come forth before the second coming of the lord amen have you come under that anointing i hope you felt it boy if you've ever got to come under one of those anointings of the tape and all that word opens up to you man it's wonderful praise the lord he said make this straight and the same john had his reignment of camel hair and a leather girdeth about his loins and his meat was locust in wild honey and when that when he out and they went out to him jerusalem and all judea and all the regions around about jordan and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins and when he saw many of the pharisees and the sadducees came to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruit meant for repentance and think ye not saying within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise that children unto abraham now and now also the ax is laid to the root of the tree therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewed down and cast into the fire i indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i am whose shoes i am not worthy to bear for he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire and whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat unto the garner but he will burn up the chaff and with an unquenchable fire frontline worker preaching the gospel telling it the way it is without fear or favor he didn't he didn't kind of tiptoe around oh reverend it's so nice to have you here today so glad you could visit us you know please come sit at this place of honor he was a front line worker amen he had a message he had something he believed in he wasn't on the front line he wasn't he wasn't on the politically correct line he wasn't on don't offend anybody line he was in the battle and those were the vipers and the snakes that he was fighting against he knew that they were the ones that were going to crucify him he knew that's who he was he wanted to point it out you know the prophet god said in one place he said in the church ages he said he said those finals men finally stood there and they he said he put their they they put their finger in the face as that of them that claim that they were prophets and were not and called them out you just think of how far we've really got away from the front line you know but being on the front line will cost you just go over to saint luke the third chapter if and we can just we can just start maybe the 12th verse okay so now he's got jews coming to him right but now he says then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do and he said unto them except exact no more than that which is appointed to you and soldiers likewise demanded of him saying what shall we do and he said unto them do no violence to no man neither accuse any man falsely but be content with your wages and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not and john answered saying unto them i indeed baptize you with water that one but one mightier than i cometh for the for the latches of whose shoes i am not worthy to loosen and he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and fire and whose fan is in his hand and he will purge this floor and with gather the wheat into the garner but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire and many other things in his exhortation preached to the people but herod the treacher being reproved of him for herodius his philips wife and for all the evil which herod had done added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison so not only was john preaching but soldiers started coming to him publicans started coming to him people started coming to him you see his front line expanded it expanded from just the jews it expanded from just those in the region it expanded the public concentration have you expanded your front line [Music] you've got a greater message than john had and there was no man been built on earth like john he just spoke it like it is what a beautiful beautiful story of john and what did he do it costed him life amen you know the story how herod's wife and she she didn't like the fact that john rebuked it and then she got drunk and the king got drunk and he asked for john's head being a front line word cost him but he didn't change the gospel for his own life he stood right there on the front line and so i feel that's what we need to be i i'm just talking about front line workers every place i go i hear the praise for frontline workers and i want to join my praise to them all of you that have dealt with the sick that have had to go to the hospitals work in hospitals had to come in contact with those people to serve them and to help them get better yes you need all the respect in the world but how much more respect does somebody who's trying to get somebody's eternal soul well who won't compromise who will say whatever it takes you know what i mean won't hold back from them yeah and and so we're talking about those we want to be front-line workers too if they have enough courageous to go into it and and come in contact with something that they may catch and get sick with how much more should we be willing to come in contact with a spirit come contact with a lying devil to come contact with somebody that's in possession so that that person could be free from that amen let's get on the front line amen you know the scripture says if you're ashamed of me before men i'll be ashamed of you before my father don't you think you're going to get in on your good works because your righteousness is his filthy rags anyway amen you want to be led by the holy spirit amen let's just go to acts four and three so just let's go ahead to acts four so let's we're going to start here in and uh we we know the story so this is the story in acts 3 of peter and and john and they go to the temple and the gate called beautiful and and uh they uh and you know so we're reading the story and all of a sudden uh they come upon this man and they set their eyes on him and they say to this man set your eyes upon us and and they they tell them in silver and gold have we none but i've got something i've got the latest virus cure i i've got the medicine can you imagine today they're fighting over the medicine oh don't give them that and don't give them this make it political i'll tell you you get sick enough you'll eat huckleberries if somebody tells you that they'll make you better you know what i mean you just ain't been sick enough yet you know what i'm saying you do whatever it takes you don't think you'll do it for a loved one yeah well there's some guys that they wanted a loved one healed they went and tore the roof off of a place and lowered them down man them guys they were front line workers for that their loved one they opened their head and hear the god masters preaching and all of a sudden [Music] cuts right to the front of the line i like that i like somebody who has enough faith to get right to the front line amen a front line worker get right to the front line don't cut to the chase cut to the front of the line be a front line worker hey man all locked up back there trying to be politically correct you know what i mean and never mind it's a great story so we just keep reading here and and it comes down and and he's just testifying and and and and he gets them all stirred up and he talks about the the the the the life and and everything and again he says then when peter saw that he answered unto the people ye men a visual 12th verse why do you marvel at this or why do you look so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we have made this man walk i like that humility why do you look at us this is the same one that was walking with you doing all the miracles through nazareth the same one you crucified he's here in the same form that's what we preach we preach jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we don't take them off the front line and put them back in history amen we have a front-line jesus we have a front-line savior we have a front-line power of the resurrection amen and you can just read down the beautiful story and and it goes on and he comes down and and and as you get over here and it goes on and so it when you keep reading the story and and i i had a wrote down another place but anyway so what happens is the scribes and pharisees say what can we do we can't deny this miracle this man was 40 years old and sat in the temple and his testimony was going all over jerusalem so they took him in and they and they brought him in and they said what can we do this whole thing stirring up all the people in jerusalem peter and john frontline workers so they threatened them and so don't you go no more don't you don't you go and and and talk anymore about uh these things and uh don't you go testifying uh about this to anybody more and he said in the lord be held at them and they were bold and and they stretched forth their hand and healed and signs and wonders would be done in the name of the holy child jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and spake the word of god with boldness you ought to go read the story of what happens and the things that follow somebody who's willing to get on the front line people say where are the signs and wonders where is the power of god well there's not there because there's nobody on the front line they want to do everything in church well this is the barracks this is the mess hall a mess hall maybe that you know what that is don't you that's where you eat mess the the food in the army so bad they called it a mess instead of calling it chow a chow how hall that's what this is this is on the front line of course it can be because the devil comes to church too but front line workers this is what happens when you're on the front line this is what happens when you go read this book of acts go read the fourth chapter of acts go read how they threatened them and told them not to do anything you want to know something that's exactly what's going on today don't preach this gospel in the name of jesus christ water it down a little bit but they got back and they testified and they lifted up their hands and glorified god amen let's go to acts 6. and you can read this and you go to the eighth verse and stephen filled of faith and powers stephen field of faith and power did great wonders and miracles amongst the people stephen was a deacon i believe just a person filled with the power doing great wonders and miracles stephen was on the front line amen he didn't wait for somebody else he didn't say oh he's on the front line and i'm not on the front line no you know you know what we do we get shoulder to shoulder we fight this battle together we're in it together we need one another we all need to be testifying we all need to be fighting and and so and and and there rose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertarians and and the cyrenians and alexandrians and of their of of cecilia and of asia disputed with stephen and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit which he spake oh my front line worker amen are you a frontline worker you've possessed the wisdom of the message of the hour i've told stories that brother branham have told i've used the sayings that brother branham has used and it confounds the wise and he said and they were stubborn men and said we have heard of him speak of blasphemies words against moses and against god and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes came unto him and and caught him and brought him to council and and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against the holy place and the law and we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered to us and all that sat in counsel looked steadfast on him and saw his face as it had been the face of an angel hallelujah frontline worker he'll do that for you if you'll get on the front line i mean he didn't take an easy way then you keep reading the rest of the story then then he gets over here and and and pretty soon he starts to see the the the the power of god and and all that god was doing and finally the scripture says that they were so stirred up that it says over here if you go all the way down to the 58th verse and he says and they cr he says and this the 54th verse and so pete so here's stephen front line worker you understand standing for the gospel right face to face with the devil amen and he says and he says to me he says who he says who received the law by the dispensation of angels has not and have not kept it in the 54th verse of the seventh chapter and when they heard these things they were cut to their heart and they gashed on him with their teeth and he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfast into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and he said behold i see the heavens open up and the son of man standing on the right hand of god hallelujah frontline worker and said behold i see the heavens hope and they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon them with one accord and cast them out of the city and a witness laid down their coats at a young man's feet whose name was saul and they stoned stephen calling upon god saying lord receive my spirit amen and he knelt down and cried with a loud voice lord not that this any sin to their charge and he had said this he fell asleep amen frontline workers we could talk about paul on mars hill we could talk about it he finally looked around he saw the altar to the unknown god he said they had a god for everything but paul knew there was only one god any one real god not man god not anything but god's god the real god and we could we could go on and say we could go into acts and we could talk about how they finally paul to finally they took paul and they threw him into prison and the stories go on and i i just say this tonight when we come to take communion we want to come on the front line spiritually and receive blessings we want to get on the front line but do we want to get on the front line of battle also not ashamed of the gospel you know sometimes circumstances rise up you know i i i think of uh of that little uh porter and you know brother rem tells the story about the porter who found jesus remember his mother had prayed for him and leaned over the fence and and and and the he got well and and then another one was led to the lord and and so he comes running up to brother brown he says brother brown i'm a christian now amen and and and so there he is and if as far as i know it's the same story all the way through and finally this little girl's coming home to be to see your mother and she's on the on the train with all of her friends you know the story that i'm referring to and and then so she's sitting there with all her friends and and and then one of the girls she with is says oh look over look at that old ugly hag there and that was her mama and she was ashamed she had an opportunity to be on the front line she had an opportunity he says oh yeah that's my mama but no she was embarrassed are we embarrassed to be on the front line are we ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ are we ashamed to testify to something that science doesn't know anything about that science can comprehend that the knowledge of the world has rejected are we afraid to be on the front line you know and and so that girl she pretended that she didn't even know that woman when she stepped off the but you know that porter was there and he was on the front line and he said wait a minute let me tell you that's your mother and let me tell you when in her day she was a looker she was better than you ever looked she was beautiful he started standing up for standing up for the gospel because that gospel was written in every scar on that mother's face on every scar on that mother's hands on the list the burns had taken her over and she was under he says i'll tell you why she's ugly she's ugly because when you were a baby that house caught on fire and she ran in there and brought you out and and you're beautiful today because she's ugly that's why you're beautiful you're beautiful because she's scarred up amen we ought to be beautiful because there's one that was scarred up for us amen and he couldn't he couldn't take it anymore when that finally came to that front line he couldn't take her acting like that and he stood up and he testified to what the what it was that mother went into those for her baby and that baby came out whole and she came out disfigured and that porter stood there to tell the story of a mother's love are you standing on the front line and talk about the love of our savior what he went through that we could be saved we need frontline workers i think of brother branham at the fair and that guy started talking about the story of jonah and how it couldn't be and and how the all whales mouths are only this big around and on and on he went no brother bram couldn't take it no more he said sir i beg your department that was a special fish that was a special well that was created by god amen he couldn't take it no more that's right you know and i wonder how many times we let people get away with just talking against the gospel preaching against the gospel i remember one time i went to the doctor i was really sick i was in a lot of pain i didn't know it was and the first thing that doctor said when he came in the door he said is jesus on vacation i said no doctor he's not on vacation he sent you here to make me well get with it yeah that's the kind of stuff you know what i mean he's not on vacation i wonder how many times we pass up the opportunity to stand on the front line we need to be front line workers and i want to close before the brothers come and take communion and it's a story the prophet of god tells about some prospectors and this man was a prospector and he was bringing his gold and and and he come to a campfire and he stopped in at the campfire on his way to to deliver his gold and and he was sitting there with the men and they all got to drinking and they told him take a drink and he said no i'm sorry i don't drink he said you refused to drink with us and they pulled their guns out and said you take a drink you too good to drink with us no but i promised my mother that i wouldn't drink i promised her on her deathbed that mama i won't drink i i won't i won't become a drink i won't do it and they said well we you gonna drink or die he made his stand and he stood for the gospel and he stood for the promises that he's made i wonder how many of us has promised god if he would help us we would tell the world and then we've never told nobody i wonder how many we promised if if if he would just do something for us that we we would make a we would make a a testimony and all of a sudden they were fixing to take his life and shots rang out because there's a guy that couldn't take it no more he couldn't take them guys making fun he got under such conviction he shall sudden the bottle blew up and he come down there and he said you know son i was going to kill every single one of you and take all your gold but when you stood on the front line and testified of the promise you took and you testified of the of the of the stand that you chose to take for the gospel he said i couldn't stand it no more these guys making fun of you have you got to the place that we can't just take it no more these people running this gospel down can't take it no more than making fun of this gospel making fun of this message somebody is going to be on the front line standing for the gospel standing for the truth we need frontline workers from teenagers to the elderly we need them all it's time that we become front line worker amen if the brothers would go get communion let us stand as they go prepare communion and let's turn in our bibles in corinthians the 13th chapter or the 11th chapter i mean in the 23rd verse first corinthians 11 23 for i have received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and we he had given thanks he break it and said take eight this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you drink as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come whosoever shall eateth that eateth this bread and drinketh this cup of the lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged can i read that scripture again if we would get on the front line if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat carry one for another and and if any man hunger let them eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come if the brothers would come and you may be seated and we're going to pray and ask the lord to bless this bread and we're going to come take communion and may our communion meet tonight is we come and remember what he's done for us and all the testimony he's given our lives and all the blessings he's given our lives and all the salvation and deliverance and and healings that he's laid upon us may we come and take communion and say lord i want to be a front-line worker i want to be right at the battlefront i want to meet satan right on his ground i want to draw the sword of the gospel and preach and share this gospel without fear without favor lord without worrying about anything i want to stand for this word father we as we take this bread we ask you to bless this bread to us for your word is meat indeed and your life is food to our soul and we ask you to bless this bread father this wine that represents the stimulation that comes from the revelation when you open the word to us you give us i said that we might see you make the gospel real father and we ask that you open our eyes that we can see the battlefield that we can see the front line we can see what we've been called to stand for what we've been called to testify of what we've been called to share life eternal eternal life for it's given into the christians hands to impart eternal life by testifying of the power of the resurrection father we ask as we drink this wine that our hearts will be stimulated that we would be moved upon to become front-line gospel workers front-line testifiers front-line witnesses for we are commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel to lay our hands on the sick and they shall recover to take up deadly things and it will not harm us bother to testify of the indwelling power of the holy spirit we ask that you bless each believer tonight as they partake of this communion we ask it tonight in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you brother you can set that
