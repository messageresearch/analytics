your word we ask it in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you tonight we're bef the starter service this evening if you'll turn in your bibles to joshua the 24th chapter the 14th and the 15th verse uh we're going to start our service this evening by listening to about 24 minutes of the conflict between god and satan the conflict and if you you have your phone i um i think that you can um look it up on your phone if you want to read along in french or spanish or i don't know how many languages that are available but uh i i think if you just listen to this and my prayer tonight is that we don't uh try to interpret it we don't try to remember what we heard before but as i thought as i listened to this i thought lord i want to to receive what was on brother branham's heart when he was preaching it and not not the doctrinal truth but also the heart part of it you know what it what did he meant when he said said that what was in his thing and just so 24 minutes i think it'll be a a blessing to you and then when he's done reading the scripture you can certainly take your seat and it would be just after the reading of scripture we'll listen to that and then we'll make a few comments tonight so god bless you as we listen to the messenger as he brings the message to us the conflict between uh god and satan so if there is a conflict between god and satan it's obviously we're going to find ourselves in conflict amen god bless you tonight as we listen to this 24 minutes now we want to turn for just a few words tonight out of the bible found over in the book of joshua 24 14 verse and 15th verse i want to read from his word listen close to his word joshua 24 14 and 15. now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we'll serve the lord amen lord bless the reading of his scriptures i have some notes here that i would like to talk just a little bit from and i want to take a text tonight to call it the conflict the conflict between god and satan and now just to teach it like a sunday school lesson but i've got several scriptures laying here in eden god knew his enemy and all the attacks of his enemy a god is the infinite god and the infinite god is the perfection of the perfections he knew all things before they ever was and therefore if this infinite god could have looked forward and did and seen the end from the beginning and knew that he would have children on this earth his own blessed children don't you believe that he would provide for them the best that he could provide would not you tonight to your children that was helpless little fellows who can't take care of themselves don't you struggle and work and do everything that you can to provide the best that you can or able to provide for those children because you are a father a parent and if that being the the what i would say the the trueness and the thought of an earthly parent in parenthood originated in god because he was the first parent don't you think that god seeing what satan would be what satan would do he gave to his children and provided for them the best thing that could be provided for them to knowing what the enemies attacked would be god fortified his children we take the war when a general goes out to meet another general in war and uh this general if he's a real true citizen of this nation that he represents and he surely would be to be a general and uh the first thing he studies the enemy's attacks he knows what he's going to do how he's going to work because he kind of went over and spied out we got spies everywhere you know these american spies in england these american spies in france says america and the german spies here and is no matter how friendly we are we still got spies and we're spying out some kind of a nuclear weapon then we find it take it back to the country then what it is they get ready when war does come they know how to attack their enemy and if we know god knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy is going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people amen so if we notice the very first thing that god equipped his children was being infinite he know what it taught to defeat satan any place anywhere on any conditions now he wouldn't say i'll give him something here and then a few years later i may study out something better to give him and uh then after a few years later like we in military force old bow and arrow and sledge rock hammer and then the next was the after the bow and arrow come the musket and after the musket come the spring feeling and now the atomic weapons and things see we keep growing more but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's an infinite god now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of a attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture amen right what was it the word amen the word that's what defeats satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing that there is the word and we find jesus on earth just to prove this was the best equipment when satan come in hand-to-hand combat with jesus he never just reached over with his power and tied his hands he just took the same weapon that god gave in the garden of eden his word and said it's written amen it's written and he punched him right out of the ring with it that's right because it's god's best and look where it is it's not just for one or two in a church it's for every one of us every believer has a right to take this word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him anywhere you meet the enemy this word is what you have to use and jesus proved it when he come so he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy when the all-out warfare comes in the battles and uh centenary then there's only one thing a real soldier can use a real christian soldier that's thus said the lord amen walk right out there and meet the enemy with the assurance that nothing thousand may fall at you right in ten thousandths at the left but it won't come naughty amen just remember that god made this statement and give this to his children that's the best that's ever been yet satan in eden when he first come to these attacks to attack the person knowing the children of god was fortified with this word satan attacked the word see he never attacked the bee he attacked the word first amen look at that sneaker lizard what he does today the first thing he can't lay it on saying well that's not a good person that's a good person see but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get him to deny that word amen that's the only thing he wants to do get you to deny that word so satan tried to to attack the word in the garden of eden so he had to have something now that he could use to to the human being would look better than that word see he had to have something that would look better to the human being than word and you know what he used reasoning just what would say common sense so that's what he used and he succeeded amen so that's what he's used all along but god can't give nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when god makes a decision it has to ever remain that way amen and satan took reasonings and took the reasonings and attacked the word and shook eve off the path that's right by reasoning human reasoning now the only way he she could uh got to disbelieve god's word it had to be appealing and satan knows how to make reasonings appealing it has to appeal to you and sin is very appealing and there's only one sin and that's unbelief so it's really appealing satan makes sin so appealing to you just stop in here for a few minutes i've often thought as a young man and read about a different nations and the morals of the country and i've heard different people tell me about uh especially in down in france down in the place called pig alley and how that the people were so immoral well i thought if i ever go in there i'll see them people down there women coming out you know reprobates with such a old haggy look you know and mean and i went down in big alley the first night me and three more ministers brother what a surprise we got now satan's too smart for that he isn't going to produce something like that but some of the prettiest girls i ever seen in my life was there appealing certainly sin is appealing and attractive satan hasn't got a fork in hooves in a in a pointed tail and and like that he is an old john barley corn out with coat hanging up and ears hanging down he's a slicker appealing sin isn't just rude like you think it is it's very appealing therefore we have to watch it close we'll just get to that in a little bit i thought of something else so uh how satan makes it look so real it's appealing to them but if they would have just stayed fortified with the word let the word be their fortress then see if they've been fortified they've been behind the word the word would been in front of them always thus saith the lord thus saith the lord thus saith the lord right or left thus saith the lord like those angels down there that day when isaiah met in the temple he thought he was getting along pretty good a fairly good preacher the king liked him real well but the king was taken from him one day and he knelt at the altar and fell into a vision and saw angels with wings over their faces nor their feet and flying with two wings a singing holy holy holy lord god almighty amen every which way they went ezekiel saw the picture of the vision this way the spirit of god was moving it had the face of an ox this way it had the face of a line and everywhere it went it had a face every where it went it was 45. the word of god there's no way around fortified all the way around everywhere thus saith the lord just saith the lord you're walking you're talking your business you're associating everything the word of god first amen so i'll leave i'll go tonight and this little dance this won't hurt anybody could you take thus saith the lord with you i believe if i could pull this little deal or just a little bit shady but could you say thus saith the lord with it always take him first keep fortified for he is our fortress it's strange but do you know you have to ignore before in order to believe the devil's lie you have to ignore and deny god's truth first before you can believe the devil's life amen you ever think of that you have to deny the truth first before you can believe a lie amen right after the night eve got from behind it and lost the battle as soon as eve satan was standing out there shooting these targets she said but the lord said and then he shot again she said but the lord said so then he shot again another way but the lord said but satan raised up back there said but wait just a minute if the lord did say that let me just tell you something you see you're not wise like god you don't know right from wrong but if listen wouldn't you love to be wise like god why eve said yes i i i believe i would maybe something like that i believe i would like to just know all the wisdom of god i like to know what's right and wrong i don't know well i tell you now she said but but the lord said well but surely you know he's a good god he won't do that see right there she broke the hole through so he could shoot right there she made the wrong stop right there stopped a little bit now let me say something to you christians down here don't you never stop one second for the devil don't stop to reason it out when you start to reason it the devil comes right in you cannot reason god you cannot understand god you've got to just believe god okay i can't explain god nobody can i can't explain many things but the only thing i just believe it because he said so amen now there's none of us can explain it don't try to explain it don't get with these unbelievers and say well now look your pastor out there junior i hear him pray for the sick now you all crazy down there there's no such thing as divine healing say all right there isn't for you then you're an unbeliever and just walk right on it's just for believers hey don't well you all say you got the holy ghost there's no such thing as holy ghost said it isn't for you than it is for me just go on see see don't read don't try to reason it hasn't got no reasoning you just believe it you don't reason a thing because remember the only way that you can accept god is by faith amen not by reasons not by understanding not able to explain you don't explain nothing you believe something amen not what you feel jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it that's right you just believe what god said i can't explain to you how the how could a the greatest miracle that i could think of is a man who is like take a pig and tell that peak you know you're no more a pig you are a lamb and he becomes a lamb that'd be hard to believe well it's the same thing takes place when you become converted from a sinner to a christian see it changes your own opinions it changes your own will it changes everything that's in you and it brings you into another life and gives you another spirit that bears forth another record see then your old life has to die and the new one has to be born again and then see you're no more the creature you was at all that's when you become behind the blood fortified with the word don't try to explain nothing just believe it and go on lord i believe savior raise my faith in thee till it can move them out amen the heart i believe for all my doubts are buried in the fountain what if abraham had been asked the doctors that come said abraham you're 100 years old your wife is 90. how are you going to have a baby now abraham say well i'll tell you it's like this you see there's going to be a time that we're going to drink a certain thing and this is going to do this and this kind of changes abraham couldn't explain that amen abraham would have said something that i i don't know i don't know any more about it than you know the only thing that i'm resting on is he said we would have it and i'm looking for it said yes sir that's older it takes just take it believe it god said so and that that settles the whole thing because god said it now we find out eve losing the battle she got from behind the word raised up on top of the trance and say yeah don't say sorry is that the truth she's lost right there well you know we don't teach that over our church we believe that what he said here yeah but listen dear you know better than that your own common sense would tell you that that's not right why i heard that people just cry and cry what they crying about see now i own common sense and show you that they're just worked out they're emotional see if you stop to listen to that you've lost the battle if they say oh now wait a minute your doctor said that that you had tb and it's a it's an advanced stage there's no way forever you get over that tv the doctor said there wasn't now don't common sense say that well if you're going to rely upon reasonings you might as well make ready to die but if you're going to what the lord gave the promise and you can believe it it changes the whole program now the same way it changes is the same way it changed for me down there i just believe it don't know how done but there was a new creature come amen i used to i shunned church i a guy told me when i used to box with i was fighting my 15th professional fight down here at evansville indiana and hired mclean many of you new albany people knew him there and i was walking up the street and howard was a welder waiting i was abandoned wait and i was fighting billy frick from huntington west virginia had one of the blue suit like this and then days i had a little hair and i was walking up the street with each supper about three o'clock get ready for the fight that night was going in there to rest and then have her hands rap and howard said to me he said you know what bill i said what said you look like a little baptist preacher and he could have called me anything i'd never i turned around i said now wait a minute howard now you laugh when you say that is he about that high flies ready to climb right on him i want nothing to do with no preacher and now the greatest compliment that he could have given me oh when somebody said brother raymond you look like a preacher i say praise god say that see what's the matter i and died a new creature amen how did i do it i took his word brother branham what kind of medicine what formula did you take i didn't take any how did he do it i don't know but anyhow i believed it i never took nothing i just believed it and he raised me up from what i was a sinner to a christian he did it because of tucky's word he'll do the same thing by sickness you do the same thing by the baptism the holy spirit he'll do the same thing by any promise he give but see what's my subject the conflict the conflict satan tries to get you to reason about it and don't you do it but after you become a christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word amen i was going to say that you are when you become a christian you're placed behind the word of god see now there's your fortress safety oh my god amen every promise in that is yours amen all the thing you have to use this reach to get it and go right on with it how you know it's going to work i don't know how it's going to work explain to me i don't know the only thing i know that god gave his children the best attack that they could have and the best thing to attack with because he knows the working of the enemy now let's let's diagnose that down like take the chemistry the blood or the chemistry of water or whatever it is see let's let's diagnose it down why why did he give the word because are you ready the word is eternal see and if god made a promise that is eternal and there's nothing nowhere can stop it amen they couldn't turn ever adam upside down and turn it backwards could never pierce the word of god one little word amen because jesus said well heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail that's the best weapon there is it's the word of the eternal god now what is the word of god the word of god is god himself so god gave the believer himself amen he's the father and the word is god then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the forefront for his children amen there you are he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about the rapture's sure the coming sure every blessing that's been promised as ours all belongs to us now if we kind of slack up and say uh satan say come around over on this side i'll reason that out with you uh-uh you got behind father then see don't you do that you stay right where father stands right where it says thus saith father thus said my father thus saith my father it's going to defeat him as sure as the world it's got to all right but when you get out from behind that like eve did the battle's lost now poor eve she listened she lost your place all right and then god chose man the holy sport and he has ever since that's where many times people and these ladies you certainly can go uh finish the rest of it up but uh we just want to just make a few comments tonight and you hold all that deep in your heart and so brethren was talking to us about the conflict between god and satan and you know when you have a conflict it's because each kingdom was offering something when satan went to eve you noticed that that he was offering her something offering her that she would be wiser offering her uh something and so we we find out that the the the kingdom uh their ef their it's each a kingdom offering something and today we we see that same conflict and we see the same kingdom we have a great big uh election going on and each side is lying about what they're going to offer and we so we find that and so we find if we look at these two kingdoms that conflict is still going on today satan had a kingdom and he was offering and we find out that satan's kingdom you know was death sickness he disguised his death and the sickness with knowledge and science and education but god said that the day that you eat thereof is the day you die so his kingdom was offering eternal life and satan's kingdom was offering to eve something that she could see and we we just realized that something that could be seen it was a it was a a carnal kingdom and when he offered satan when satan came to jesus to tempt him that's what he offered to jesus he showed him all the kingdoms of the world he showed him something that could be seen something that could be tasted something that could be touched as brother graham said something that was extremely appealing so he appealed to the senses he appealed to reasoning but jesus's kingdom his kingdom was unseen and that's what he said he says my kingdom is not of this world he said if my kingdom was of this world wouldn't my my followers wouldn't wouldn't they come to to fight for me but he wasn't offering a cardinal kingdom he wasn't offering something that was of this world because satan's kingdom is is manifested in what he has to offer so you we've got to see that that there as brother branham said there's only god only had one weapon from his kingdom and that's his word and satan's kingdom he tries to disguise it but it's still death it's still frustration it's still confusion you know and so the only thing that satan can do for his kingdom as brother branham said in the tape is satan discredits the word of promise because the word is the only thing that proves the reality of the unseen kingdom okay now we're we're talking about something that satan has a kingdom and his reality is what you can see what you can hear what you can taste but the wages of sin is death you just talk about it any way that you want the everything that satan has the final end of it is death this great rock and roll star i saw the article today i i don't know what uh he who he played for i guess he played a guitar i guess he was famous i guess he might have accomplished great things in the quote-unquote music of rock and roll but they're going to bury him because that kingdom is a kingdom of death because he said the day that you eat thereof is the day that you die but god had an unseen kingdom so what the lord was offering is he was offering eternal life and that's what his kingdom is it's eternal life but because it's unseen and it's not something that you can touch or feel or or see his kingdom was only seen by revelation by divine revelation now we saw as he began to speak there the last things he says is that god put a man in charge so he gives man revelation and he put man in charge and so we are uh the only proof tonight and one he says she said eve lost her position but faith establishes you a position that you see the kingdom you believe the kingdom you believe the word of god you've taken the weapon and you believe it that every promise i love what he said when you believe it he said you believe the word of god you believe it's the master of every circumstance it's the master of every situation it's what will provide for you and take care of you and and that's the faith that you have that brings every promise in the word of god to pass because you have the revelation that that word is true any child teenager parent adult that knows that this unseen kingdom is real by revelation and so we've been made ambassadors that's what we are we're ambassadors of the kingdom of god to prove to this world that this kingdom exists and satan his whole thing was to to discredit the word of god that's why he put it in a religious covering he says he believes the word of god but he denies the power thereof he doesn't mind it being taught as a teaching he doesn't mind it being taught as a doctrine he doesn't mind it being taught in any way that he he doesn't care as long as he can get you out from behind believing all of the word of god it's what religion is but though he's made us ambassadors other words we are whom that god chose to prove that this other kingdom exists it has to be more than words alone because satan's kingdom is words it's just his words happen to be a lie but what did he do she believed satan's lies as god's truth and that's where mankind sits today they believe that their science can keep them from dying they believe that their education will make life advanced satan believe it or not is still looking for eternal life but eternal life only lies in one thing and that's god's word he's the author that's why he gave us he said eternal life he says he gave us his word because his word is eternal his word is life and life more abundant just think tonight you are representing an ambassadors of the kingdom that you will not die that's what we're saying that this kingdom gave us eternal life that's what they said well we're going to kill you and we're going to put you in a grave to prove that your kingdom doesn't have life he said you put me in that grave and in three days i'll come out of that tomb we're the only kingdom that points to an empty tomb so we have to understand that this great that that that goes on that satan is his kingdom is manifested with wars and rumors of war it's manifested with graveyards everywhere it's manifested with new disease all the time look at all the vaccines vaccines we've taken look at all the doctors offices that we've gone into look at all the medicines that we have but satan's kingdom just come up with a whole new mess you know it come up with something because they were fooling around looking for a better weapon looking for a better this and now the whole world is is under that kingdom and it that his kingdom has always manifested itself always manifested itself but it always manifests itself in death it can't get away from the true fruit of his kingdom is death and eternal separation from god but god offered eve eternal life they had that life and they lost their position now we're ambassadors because our eyes have been opened and we've had by revelation he's made to us his kingdom anew i love what he said he said i used to be this way but now i'm a new creature in christ jesus i was ready to fight with that guy because he said i look like a baptist uh preacher he said now it's the greatest thing you can say to me what happened something's transpired something's taken place you you've had a taste of the eternal kingdom of god you've had a taste of life and life more abundant so we got to come back to the reality that you have the proof of the reality of the kingdom of god you are the ambassadors uh you you uh it is given to you as an ambassador to represent and show what your kingdom has to offer unless you're part of the other kingdom unless you're lukewarm and you've mixed the two kingdoms together that's what denominational does that's what uh religious covering it's uncovering but our kingdom is in direct conflict god's kingdom is in direct conflict it's a conflict he knew the battle was coming he knew that satan would get more religious and more pretty and more scientific and have more toys and more games and more pleasure because sins of healing is attractive he's got more and more and more and more and more things to offer but make sure in your heart that you've been born again into the kingdom of god because he said my kingdom's not of this world so it's an unseen kingdom but yet it's satan's kingdom is a kingdom you can see and god's unseen satan's kings of a kingdom you can touch you can taste you can look around you and you can see the science you can see the education you can see the accomplishment like he said you look at generals they started out with bows now they've got atomic bombs now they've got weapons i guess from what i've heard that they can send sonic waves in and and sound waves and things that mess you up and make you sick they they have ways to poison you that's that battle but aren't you glad that we've got a weapon and our weapons every promise of the word and you're a representative of that kingdom how you can approve to the people in a carnal kingdom that what you're talking about's real that you have a spirit that that has love and joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness godliness you know it and it's something that that has faith meekness something that's real because you have us the spirit of that kingdom which is the spirit of god dwelling in you and because you have that spirit that spirit and the fruits of that spirit is faith and you're a person that believes every promise of god but you're not just a people that believes every promise of god you're the people that's been chosen to manifest the word of god satan brings sickness what do you bring you bring the promises of healing as you heard this evening when you listen to that tape he was drawing in order for there to be a conflict there has to be a difference there has to be a different picture drawn and every army has got to have its soldiers and so you have the power that and the reality to prove that the spirit of this kingdom is real not by talking about an unseen kingdom but bringing that unseen kingdom into reality so who draws the conflict you do you are the conflict you're the problem with satan's kingdom because you're a people that don't believe in death you believe in life and life more abundant you believe in eternal reward and you can only prove the unseen kingdom by the manifestation of every promise of god's word like jesus said my kingdom's not of this world it came to a rabbi no man could do these things unless they come from god so someplace somewhere this conflict this difference between these two kingdoms has got to manifest someplace somewhere someone's got to stand up and say that's not the truth satan and we heard him say it tonight my father said my father said thus saith the lord thus saith the lord he said if you believed you had tb and you didn't believe that there was a god that could heal you may go make preparation go pick out your casket go by your plot of ground i'm going to die because science said i was going to die the kingdom of satan said i'm going to die but you stand up and say oh no it doesn't have to be that way i'm an ambassador it doesn't have to be that way someone is an addiction it doesn't have to be that way it doesn't have to be the way that the enemy says it is because i have the word of god i just don't have the word of god i'm fortified by the word of god and the word of god is he said was god that's our substance that's our barrier that's our life we're here to say that the word of god is truth and it's the way the word of god says it is we have an unseen problem solver an unseen answer that all that we can do is manifest it what is people's problems you know what the problems of the world are it's the manifestation of satan's kingdom because he caused the problems in the garden but what did god give us he loved us so much he sent his only begotten son that whoever believed on him he gave them the power to be the sons and daughters of the word the sons and daughters of god wasn't god the word he said what was the word it was god himself standing out for the believer and fortifying them against the kingdom so remember what we just heard i know we've heard so much he says but not only is it our fortification it's our weapon so when the kingdom comes in like a flood the kingdom of enemy comes in the flood and brings problems to your family problems to your life problems to your body you don't not only have the fortification of protection but you have the weapon of deliverance the best thing that god could give us was this work not only did he just give us his word to hide upon but he gave us his word to fight with and our kingdom is here to fight the kingdom of satan he said who will take his sword who will take the sword of the word and satan i've come the kingdom of god has come and we've come to stand up against your lies you're not taking our children you're not taking our health you're not taking the health of your friends when the satan's kingdom declares that it's doom and gloom and death and there's no healing there's no deliverance you're stuck because that's the fruits of his kingdom there's a little ambassador that stands up and says it doesn't have to be that way you have an ambassador that stands up and points out the fruits that's just the fruit of sin that's just the fruits of unbelief that's just what happens when you don't believe god's word but if you could believe on him whom the father hath sent there's life there's liberty there's healing there's eternal life all these things are on god's side death sickness hell and the grave is all on his side and we're the ambassadors of god to show the conflict between these two kingdoms to show the difference between these two kingdoms and each kingdom has to offer something and god's kingdom offers eternal life you're called to show the difference you're called as to prove that there's another kingdom exist another solution exists another reality exists it may not be seen but it's real it may be unseen except by faith but it's real and that's what jesus said my kingdom's not of this world and that's what we're ambassadors of we're the ambassadors of the unseen kingdom we're the ambassadors of the unseen benefits let's just don't let his reality be the only reality that's real don't let's not make satan's diagnostics the only diagnostics that's real don't let his kingdom be the only kingdom that's real because there's a conflict there's another reality there's another truth and god's got a people that possess that kingdom they possess that eternal life they possess those promises they possess the word of truth and they can't stay hidden forever if they don't come to the forefront the sinner the unbeliever they only know what they hear and they only know what they see but there's a people that's called chosen and elected that have another reality that have another spirit that have another life eternal life so let's stand ever true to the things that are true don't let satan pull you outside of that word don't let him give you away that's not the word way stay with the word stay with the truth and it'll do you and all the people you come in contact with it'll do many good things for them god bless you tonight let's stand together aren't you glad you've got your beautiful truth oh aren't you glad that you have what god's given you life and life more abundant brother billy if you could come and lead us in song and worship and we'll just bow our heads and pray tonight there's a great battle the battle of reasoning and the battle of truth and satan always makes sin appealing and where would this world be if there wasn't a voice if there wasn't a gospel if there wasn't the reality of god's word living in flesh you say lord when where am i and who am i i'm the reality of god's word living in flesh my testimony is is that every word of god is true and every word of satan's a lie i am not going to come out from behind the reality of god's living word it's my fortification it's my defense it's my strength and not only do i hide there as my resting place i am called to testify of its reality i'm called to testify of its fortification i'm called to testify of its might and its power because i know it will help others i know it will deliver others from the clutch of the lie of satan's kingdom and satan's making his kingdom look beautiful but how come his kingdom's got hospitals and doctors offices and and insurance programs and medicare programs and all those promises and all those institutions to tend to the fruits of his kingdom how come there are psychiatrists and mental health and pills by the box loads to attend the fruits of his kingdom how come there's so much crime and frustration and broken hearts so many prisons to attend to the fruits of his kingdom look around have our eyes and hearts open the world's not happy it's dying it's sick and there's more mental sickness and and and broken hearts and desperations and frustrations that's what the world's living in but there's a people that have a spirit of a new birth that are commissioned to go into this world and tell them there's hope there's life there's love there's peace there's a savior there's a healer there's a deliverer that's the kingdom of god whose ambassador are you deceiving what are you representing to see this evening what are we giving to this world tonight i believe we're kept with the love of god to tell this dying world the lord hasn't forgot you he's a healer for your sickness he's a deliverer for your bondage there's eternal life after death [Music] and lord i want to be an ambassador of the truth deceiving breth bless this people tonight o lord [Music] that they can stand on the right side of the conflict on the real reality eternal side of this conflict that there's an unseen answer
