dra a song Ready is it good to be in the house of the Lord what a what I would rather be in the house of the Lord than anywhere else amen where we can Fellowship together and know that he's here Among Us amen God bless [Music] you amen Happy Thanksgiving let's go ahead and bow our heads and commit the service to him Lord Jesus we're want to be so careful Lord to be thankful Lord for all your blessings and all your goodness and for your keeping hand and the fact that you ever reached out touched us father and called us into yourself the fact that you ever gave us an ear to hear Lord an eye to see Lord the fact that you caused us to know you to bring us to this place whatever place we may find ourselves according to your word is according to your hand Lord we just want to thank you we want to commit the service to you we pray father once again that you would have your way Lord that this would not be some service conducted of man Lord to be seen of men to hear from man Lord to be seen of each other or to clap one another on the back but Lord we come with one purpose that we might hear from you that we might lift up your name and that we we may welcome you in our midst Lord to do according to your perfect will Lord there are many needs that have come in that door and Lord we believe that there will be many victories that go out the b Lord we depend upon you now as we sit at your feet as we worship your name to hear from you and from your word and we pray that the service would be done according to your will in Jesus name amen you may be seated just a few minutes as we read our Psalm this morning you know probably one of the most sobering portions of scripture is found in Romans 1 and it describes you the tragic condition of those who according to verse 18 those who hold the truth in unrighteousness those who had the truth those who knew God but it says in verse 21 that when they knew God they glorified him not as God verse 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like a corruptible man you know you continue to read the chapter and you can see the how someone's condition begins to deteriorate over time the danger of being religious without having a personal relationship with the Lord even sitting in a message Church you know among the statements used to describe these ones in verse 21 as this short description neither were they thankful not grateful for what God has made available to them they don't recognize the value of it they don't value it even though they may intellectually understand it better than anyone else but you know like Esau so willing to set it aside for whatever shortterm thing they value most that day neither were they thankful because they don't recognize the value of what was given you know we're in a season of Thanksgiving it's a time where from you it's a time of remembrance going back to some of the earliest days in our country where small group of people set aside some time to express their gratitude to the Lord for bringing them through very hard first year for meeting their needs for guiding them for keeping them for protecting them but you know how much more should we be thankful for the work which God has done for us how should we recognize the value of what's been made available to us not as a people not as a church not as a religious belief but as individuals as individuals do we have the right level of gratitude you know we're going to read Psalm 116 this morning it's a portion of scripture which could best be described as a Psalm of Thanksgiving from one who recognizes the value of what God has done for them you know and anyone who's ever had that experience that relationship with the Lord should recognize this as their testimony from the very first verses I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications because he has inclined his ear unto me therefore will I call upon him as long as I live and then down in verse 7 return unto thy rest oh my soul for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee for thou Hast delivered my soul from Death mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling you know and as we read that I wonder how many of us can say that's my testimony Look What the Lord Has Done you know look at the value of what he's done for each of us individually you know and the question is is do we demonstrate the right kind of gratitude for that work not wrapping ourselves in a religious lifestyle but still satisfying ourselves with short-term interests that we value more than him not commoditizing the work of the Lord down to a field of study or something to intellectually understand or achieve some kind of worship service or demonstrate how religious we are it's not the kind of expression of gratitude that he's looking for you know but each of us individually truly appreciating the value of the work that he's done for us individually with the right expression of gratitude so what is the right kind of gratitude what is the expression of gratitude that should result out of someone who truly appreciates the work that's been done for them individually Psalm 116:12 asks it this way what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me you know and that's the question isn't it how could I possibly what could I possibly offer him what should be the expression of my gratitude that is appropriate for what he's done for me does he expect me to devote myself to scriptural or message studies to demonstrate how deep I understand these things does he expect me to seek the deepest sermons or the most powerful worship services to participate in does he expect me to perform a certain amount of religious Works have the best Church attendance have the longest prayers or the most Miracles what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me he says in verse 13 I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows on to the Lord now in the presence of all his people take a hold of what he's offered lay a hold of that cup of Salvation that he's offered me there's a way made I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me lay hold of him and do not let him go call upon the name of the Lord identify yourself with his name amen not the name of a man or a movement or a person or a gift but with him am you know if you're really grateful for something you don't ever let it go you don't easily set it down you don't set it aside for one minute even to experience something else you know it's not like Esau who was so willing to sell his Birthright for a shortterm satisfaction but it's more like his brother Jacob who wrestled all night with the angel of the Lord and said I will not let you go until you bless me am and then he says this this expression of gratefulness I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people you know four times in the Psalms it speaks of paying my vows before the people two of those times is right here in Psalm 116 but what does it mean to pay my vows what vows what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me you know if you look up those Hebrew words that phrase pay my vows actually means to complete or finish something that was promised a vow is a promise a commitment to do something a promise has been made and our expression of gratitude is to fulfill are part of the promise know Paul goes into great detail about this in Hebrews but the best way to sum it up is when he summarized it in Romans 12 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God because of the mercies of God that you present your body is a Living Sacrifice holy accept unto God which is your reasonable service why that you may prove demonstrat amen manifest show what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God to pay my vows is to perform that part of his will or his word that he has set aside for me to perform that's how I express my gratefulness not with my study not with my powerful church services but doing the work completing the work fulfilling the promise paying my vows individually completely that we might complete the work that he set for us to do let's go ahead and stand this morning what shall we Render unto the Lord for all his benefits does our expression of gratitude show the value we put on the work he has done for us me you let's read that short Psalm 116 this morning in this Psalm of Thanksgiving I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications because Heath inclined his ear unto me therefore will I call upon him as long as I live the Sorrows of death compassed me and the Pains of Hell G hold upon me I found trouble and sorrow then called I upon the name of the Lord oh Lord I beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is the Lord and righteous yay our God is merciful the Lord preserveth the simple I was brought low and he helped me return unto thy rest oh my soul for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me for thou Hast delivered my soul from Death mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I believed therefore have I spoken I was greatly Afflicted I said in my haste all men are liars what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints oh Lord truly I am thy servant I am thy servant and the son of thine handmade thou Hast loosed my bonds I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people in the courts of the Lord's House in the midst of thee Oh Jerusalem praise ye the Lord amen amen God bless you you can have your seats we just want

death in this age amen hallelujah brother Mark David has a special this morning so we're going to invite him to come at this time [Music] amen God bless you church I do have a testimony before a song um because uh it happened to me and um it felt like um I was talking to myself like usual but this time I wasn't talking to myself because it was really real and so please just give me two minutes just to share with you I mean um I hope it really does bless you it just shows you know like we do here that God is mindful of us it doesn't even matter if it's a little fly that flies over your head he's mindful of it because he knows it he sees it and so uh this past weekend not this one the the other one me and my wife had to visit some brethren back in the DMV Virginia area uh and so when we went we went there we visited it was a great Gathering of uh uh Saints you know Saints uh people from from Nigeria that we know and so uh on our way back on Monday this past Monday uh you know the East Coast maybe I lost my orientation of time uh because you know central time is different from the East time so maybe I wasn't paying too much attention and um I got too close to the time that my the plane was going to fly and so we started hurrying up you know I told my wife we got to hurry up and we hurried up we got to the airport and unfortunately when we got to the airport they for some reason they took our bag to the side it was like uh we got to check your bag a little extra because you maybe you have something in there and I was like oh why this time you know I'm running late already but you know they have to do what they have to do so I kept quiet and while standing there I said oh Lord I set it out in fact my wife was right next to me I thought she was heing I said oh Lord please can you delay the plan for me just 2 minutes or 5 minutes so I can catch up with the plane if I don't my wife is going to work the next day I don't know you know you know the delay that might get you in 20 I don't know when I will get to Texas in fact when I was checking the plane every other plane gets to Texas the next day uh because there's got to be a layover and all of that and this is just a direct flight from Virginia down to Texas I would be in Texas in two two two plus hours and uh I I said oh God please can you delay this PL just five minutes immediately I said that something told me oh no you going to miss this PL I'm like oh my goodness and so immediately said that you know this is me thinking okay Mark David you're talking to yourself again but then I said you going to miss this it says you're going to miss the Spain so I was like okay fine I kept quiet and the only thing that I could say out of my mouth was oh look Lord the fact that I'm going to miss this plane does not mean you cannot hold that plane for me for two more minutes and that's what I said I said okay what I was agreeing is I would miss the plane but I just prayed to you in fact I said your son is requesting this from you Lord and so the fact that you said no I would miss this plane it doesn't mean you cannot do it in fact you can do it but since you chose not to do it then I'll accept that immediately I said look if you do that you know I would testify you know I would I would go there and tell everybody what you did uh uh the moment that I said that it was like no don't worry I'll give you another reason to testify so you know this is Mark Davy talking to himself I just kept quiet and you know we did all we got to do and we got to the plane in fact when I was getting to the gate the plane was pulling out I was seeing the plane it was just moving out I was like oh my goodness yes I did I missed it and the man that was on the counter said oh you were the one you missed your plane you the only one we were waiting on but you missed it and he said and he was looking at you know the screen and he said oh Mark David is a lucky guy and I was like what do you mean he said I'm going to get you in another plane in fact the plane right next to me that's going to I think uh Charlotte nor Carolina I'm going to get you on that plane but that's just a layover you you get there and then you from there go to Texas and I was like is is the you know connecting flight he going to get to Texas today he was like yes and in my mind I'm like so this is me now my human thinking was like well God is this what you said you still going to give me a reason to testify for because regardless these people's got to get me home one way or the other I was like they have to get me home so this is me just thinking okay they would get me home regardless um and I was like okay thank you very much and in fact it said it twice oh Mark David you a lucky guy I was like okay thank you thank you very much and um for some reason at some point in time they got me on the plane I got to not Carol you North Carolina and we stay we were going to stay there for Just 2 hours and we're going to get to Texas maybe around 11 or 12 I was like uh okay I'll still give test I'll still testify for it but then while getting on that plane I you know I rushed my wife to get on the plane so I packed most of her stuff in my jacket my my her wallet that everything that she has is in that wallet uh bank card you know kids card and all that stuff so I took that wallet and put it in my jacket somewhere like that I packed everything and I got in the plane because it was a connecting flight I was sitting in a different seat she was sitting in a different seat and so the plane got to North Carolina we got down she was the first one cuz she was right up front she was the first one to get out the plane and so I got out the plane with all the bags and all that stuff as well and U my boy was you know in the car seats and so um my wife saw the wallet her wallet she saw it with me when I was getting out of the plane and I knew I kept it there and so uh we asked the lady I was like where am I going to get the you know the connecting flight and she said you have to walk the hottest side of the airport which is like almost a mile or two I'm going from E to C that's a long walk and so I was like okay no problem I took my wife and the kids I was like okay let's walk down then my wife was let's just go there and sit down it doesn't matter if it's 2 hours don't let us miss this one I was like okay and so we walked all the way down there almost two two miles we walked down there we got there my wife looked at me and said where's my wallet I was like I gave it to you she's like no you did that so I looked at my jacket it wasn't there oh my goodness I started freaking out she was like look my my ID card everything is in that wallet I was like okay you sit down here let me just quickly go back probably when I was trying to put the baby in the caret it fell off I said I don't know and I was like she was walking right behind me I was like did you see it fall because I was having a lot of loads on me or bags on me she was like no I didn't see anything fall I walked all the way down there everybody in the airport was looking at me like this guy must have lost something and I was telling him yes wallet you know and you know it was almost towards the trans Thanksgiving weekend there was a lot of people in fact we were walking this way so close to each other in my mind I was like oh this wallet is gone and so I got all the way back to that lady that told us where we need to go and I said please I lost my wallet my wife's wallet please did you find it and she was like no I didn't find anything and I started ask asking around they said they couldn't find it I should go report that to Lost and Found and so I went I called Lost and Found I told him to say no we didn't nobody turned in anything I was like oh in fact one lady walking with American Airlines said it's gone you better start calling the banks and tell them to cancel your cards and all of that your credit cards and all that good stuff I quickly called my wife and said hey stop canceling all that card I think this is gun and so I walked all the way back again two miles back to where my wife was sitting and I sat down and I was just like oh my goodness and my wife was like oh what we going to do I was like I don't know I mean we just have to call everyone in fact she's caned some she was on the call with another one to cancel another one and um she was like maybe I should go back and look for I was like I just walked two miles you want to it's nothing I was like okay you know what Something Told Me stand up and walk back to the same place that I was coming from I was like I just came back there I haven't even rest two minutes and I have to walk back but then I was very obedient and I just stood up I told her take the baby I'm going to walk back down there and I just did I just thought I won't tell you what why I was walking back there cuz I was was walking so dejected I was just dragging my feet and the lady was like you found it I said no I said I told you it's gone call the bank and cancel it I walked all the way back down there and when I when I got there back to the lady again she said did you find it I was like no I did not and something told me to go sit down exactly where my wife was sitting before we stood up and left and I sat down there I was tired just sitting down so I could rest before I can take another M you know mile and a half back again and and for some reason the lady said okay wait a minute let me check a particular place for you I was like okay go ahead and she walked down there she checked and she came back like unfortunately I can't find it there but wait a minute let me do one more checking and she went into another office and checked and she came back and she said we might be lucky what's the name of your wife and I told her this is my wife's name this is everything and it's the same last name as mine and she went in there and she looked in that office she called I don't know she called someone she looked in that office and when she came out she came out with the wallet and I just screamed I screamed so much because it was just God telling me to go back get up the wait and just go back and go find it I just came back from there and so everything that I was that I thought I was talking to myself was not really talking to myself but was really just God ordering my footstep just telling me what it is to do and so when that happened I just screamed when I was coming back the lady that kept on asking me is lost I said she said you find find it I said I found it this time and she just started screaming she said that was God because it's supposed to beun and I like thank you that's God and so I I just I want to appreciate I I just want to appreciate God because he's just so mindful and the only thing I could just say when I was coming is oh Lord help my unbelief help me help me that I you know I'm not doing that maybe I didn't do up to 100% of what you want I just looked at myself and said oh God for everything that you've done for me and what I'm returning back to you I should do more and so uh

going to get baptized after service this morning um we're going to do it at the address the brothers if you can put it up there um well on the screens um at the VRBO I'm pretty sure all the youth knows what I'm talking about at R Stefan's place and we're going to that's where we so if you can make it we'll appreciate that so you can just come and see about getting baptized amen let's open our Bibles this morning and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone uh trust you're happy to be in the house of God this morning um let's open in uh Romans chapter 7 and uh before we read that I want to read a quote that uh brother monam uh uh read this is the invisible Union and uh paragraph 23 he says now in Romans 7 trusting that that you have your Bible open it says uh everywhere now across the country we want want to read closely now it says this message out of uh this message out of here so he's taking the text out of here it seems like it's uh it's on marriage and divorce but it it really isn't to me it's a prophecy for the church in the last day and I want to that's the title I want to give it the prophecy for the church in the last day so let's open in Romans 7 it says though ye not Breen uh for I speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth for a woman which has a husband is bound to is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if uh if the husband be dead she she's loose from the law of her husband so if so then if while her husband liveth she's married to another she shall be called adulteress but if a husband be dead she's free from the law so that she is no adulterous though be though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye are Al ye are also ye also are become dead by the law to the law by the body of the of Christ that ye should not you should be married to an another even him who raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruits unto him now I like verse five and six it says for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were which were by the law did work in our members uh it says to bring forth fruits unto death so we were because we were in sin we were in the flesh we brought forth fruits everything that we brought forth was subject to the same so it was the fruits of the fruits of the sin and the fruits of law it says but now ye are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter let's just bow our heads father we ask that you bless your word to us this morning in the name of Jesus Christ amen may have your seats let's also open our Bibles once again um in in Psalm uh uh 107 uh verse one as we read here Paul is speaking it said that we when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by law by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruits unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we H we we were held that we should serve in newness of the spirit so there's a newness of the spirit that has to be manifested there's the fruits of the newness of the spirit that are different from the law of sin that we were bound under in Psalm 107 And1 uh David speaks and he says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the Redeemer of the Lord say so whom he had redeemed from the hands of the enemy and gather them out of the land from the East and from the west and from the north and from the south he said they wandered in the wilderness in solitary way they found no City to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul friended in them it says then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distress how many can testify to that that's our testimony this morning and he led them forth by the right hand by the right way it says that they might go to the to a city of habitation oh that man should praise the Lord for his goodness for He is wonderful works for his children of for for his wonderful works for the children of man for he satisfieth the longing soul and filth the hungry soul with goodness such is such as it sits in darkness and then the shadow of death were Bound in Affliction of an iron because they rebelled against the word of God and contem counsel of the most high therefore he brought down their hearts with labor they fell down and there was none to help them then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he saved them out of the distress I love this kind of God every time you cry he's there to help you every time you are in distress you cry out he's there to serve you he's there to make sure that you know that he's your god is's there to comfort your soul and he said he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and and break their bands in suer he said oh men that and all that men should praise the Lord he said says for his goodness and for his wonderful works for the children of men for he had broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in suer this morning I just want to say it's you know as we we could recognize it to be the season of Thanksgiving it's It's always important as humans and in even as mankind that we could just take a moment to to to remember the things that God has done for us you know it's it's in men's nature to always look for the next great thing you know we so very very seldom take time to just sit down and examine the things that God I like that song We Sing count your blessings because what it tells you is often time we are always looking for the things things that we don't have you know you get this you buy a house well I need a car you buy a car well I need this I need furniture and I need that and I need you get this it's always the next thing the moment you get it your mind automatically switches over to the next thing that you want to get and it becomes just an unsatisfying cycle that you run through oh my car is old I need a better this I need a better that but we very seldom take time to to just be thankful for what God has done for us if even this morning we just to look at ourselves and just say even in the natural you can come in this morning and say it's important for me to reflect upon my own life and see where God has gotten me out of and where he's brought me into as children of God it's important we take a moment to be thankful we're thankful for eternal life you know the prophet will tell us if we would lose if a man will be given 10,000 years and all the riches of the world and all of that and it said that if you will be given not against eternal life he said I will take eternal life even if I had to suffer for 10,000 years it says I know that after my suffering are over I will have eternal life so if we can this morning just uh uh consider the things that God has done for us in our lives consider where he's taken you from consider how many things has done for you since your birth and what you know and what you don't know consider the good health that he's giving you this morning consider the things that uh uh from the very natural life that you are living in you had good health God has given you that amen you can move your your members you can walk you can do all those things God has there how many are in the hospital this morning and and and being operated on and being sick and going through all kinds of things and and but you are here this morning and God has has woken you up out of your bed and has brought you to church so you can come and hear the word of God I'm thankful for that you you consider the importance of of how that God has gathered us from all corners of the earth no man can put this together you you couldn't get all this Nations gathered here together to hear one word to hear the same word and to agree upon it you couldn't get 10,000 scientists to agree on the same thing but yet the Lord has build it so wonderfully and he's taken the scripture says he shall have a bride out of every nation every Kindred every country on Earth God will have a bride that will be represented and we ought to be thankful of it this morning God has given us families for those that are married and he's given us children he's given us home to stay and his giving us all of that we ought to be thankful of those things how many are are starving and are hungry and they don't have anything and yet we are this morning and God has given us all we ought to be thankful for it we ought to be thankful for one another we can't take this for guarantee if you've been in this church long enough you'll see that there are faces that were here that are no longer here so we don't just want to say well it'll continue on every moment we ought to be cherishing it and thankful for it oh I'm thankful for my brother and I'm thankful for my S my S not criticizing one another not coming oh look at how it's dressed oh look at how no but thankful and prayerfully saying that if he if God brought him here God can change his dressing God can touch his heart he could do more so she could become the very Christian that she needs to be there has to be a Thanksgiving message out of the believer that's why when we share the gospel we don't share it in the stand point that behold I'm Sav and you are lost no you will never win that person but if you can try to show him that you are thankful that you're just trying to tell him what God has done in your heart you're just trying to have him to understand that you didn't make yourself what you are you didn't change yourself you didn't make yourself believe this message God caus you to believe this message that's where the thank Thanksgiving come from why because it's his love love towards you that causes you to love one another we ought to be thankful for a church a place we can come and worship we got to be thankful for a pastor that loves the word that stays with the word and all the pastor Whose desire is only to point you to what the prophet say how many people are out there trying to give you explanation well the prophet didn't really say that when he said that he meant that I don't want your explanation I want what the prophet said because the the word was not given to you it was given to the prophet and the prophet brought it and he said repeat what I said amen yes a prophet that a pastor that holds on to that he wants you to listen to the message I was telling a brother the other day I said when we come to church the beauty of it is we are here if you listen to tapes and you listen to what the prophet said when you come into the church you are only hearing the echo of what you've been listening to and that's what you amening to you don't want to Amen to something new something great or whatever you want what the prophet or what the preacher is saying to much what the prophet has already said that we be thankful for one another th be thankful to be a member of the Bride what what what what what characteristics do I have to even qualify for this I don't what what did I do to Merit this I didn't do anything he chose you he elected you he placed you as member of his bride we ought to be thankful for that thankful as children of God but when will say and in this message I just love it it said paragraph 32 it says I'm thankful to God to be to be living in the time of the closing scene of the his of the his of the world history he says he says I don't know I don't know if if I would have been if it says if I had to say so before the foundation of the world and God would have laid out the whole program to me and said to me I want I want you to preach I want you to preach and now what age would you desire to go in the earth and preach he said I would have chosen this age now when we when we go home and I'm just talking in church I want this to Echo out within our lives when we go out of here are we really in understanding of what the prophet is saying here he's saying for I think this is the Golden Age he says I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of his visitation but still I think this right now is the greatest time he says because it's the time that is coming to take the people that is redeem oh I hear people say well you know you over there you know you talk so much about the prophet and everything and all of that it says how about Jesus Christ let me say this to you this morning Jesus Christ died so we can have this day today what Jesus did but said that what he died he didn't finish the work that he wanted to do the part that he did was he paid the price on Calvary he paid the price of redemption but there had to be a time where not another person he himself will come so he can claim that which he died for and we are living in that time amen this is not the time where for you to look back and say well I don't I don't have to have this I don't know everything that a Believer is supposed to have Christ is here to claim it back for you he's here so you can have it back whatever you desire so you can have it back it's the time of whatever was he died for he's here to redeem it he's here to take it back from the hands of the devil but what says here is the book the book of redemption he was taken out it says when men lost it Satan couldn't touch it because of his dirty head he went back in the hands of the original owner but God didn't create the book for himself he created it for a people and then in the end time the same God he comes down to take the same book and puts it right back into your hands you say what do you mean we saw a prophet with that book in his hands he manifested the same thing that Adam did in the beginning why God is showing you this is the time I'm not taking you just right back to Pentecost I'm taking you way past Pentecost I'm taking you right from the beginning where it all started when I created man in my own image so you can be my very representation oh so he will say and he says and we we know that history is closing out it says let me skip it I I skipped a little bit it says he redeemed near the resurrection when the redeem will come forth he says what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people he says great time we are unused about it we we have something to be unused about we we a Christian cannot be sad a Christian it has to be the happiest person that's on the face of the Earth Earth and it's not your happiness shouldn't be connected to how many worldly Goods you have your goodness cannot communicate cannot be uh directly connected to whether you have a job or don't have a job or how well you feel or how sad you feel no you your your happiness is directly connected to the fact that God gave you eternal life God saved you God promis that he will give you whatever you have need of oh yes he says and we know that history is closing out and the world history will be soon be over and we are going to step into the new day he says that great Millennium that it says that great Millennium it says that one that that that that as one Believers I believe it says in the Millennium in a millennium reign with Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth the physical Return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood it it's a great day that we are living in and and we we we we need to be appreciative of it you know we we've said it and it's been said all uh uh uh uh many times that God could have chosen this age and and assign it to one called Moses or or Elijah or one of the great prophet or even his own disciples he could have taken it and giving it to them so they can come and live it this day I want you to imagine Peter James and John living in this age and what they would have done in all those things you can look at it and say that was going to be glorious but God thought that it would be glorious that you could be here that you will do it not Peter James and John not Moses but you because and the prophet will tell us it's not because of the greatness of man it's because of the greatness of God because the same god who caused them to do great things in daytime that same God is here to cause you to do great things so don't beler yourself and look at yourself of no value you have a great God your value is the fact that you believe in a great God oh that will be appreciative and and the sense of Thanksgiving in recognition of the goodness of what God has been is doing in this time oh that God could choose you to be here in this time and he says but when I'm will talk about it says it's God's grace and mercy that done it now I'm speaking about Thanksgiving message it's God's grace and mercy that DED it it's not because we we somehow we better than the others no God allocated it God chose this one to be in this age that I want to be in the other age we had nothing to do it that was God's sovereignty but we are thankful for God's sovereignty that we could be here to see it all it was by his grace by his Mercy his great love as the scripture will says he has chosen you and I to be here because not because of our we are good but because God is good he said not because we deserve it but because of his great love that he will choose us you think about billions that are out there you think about how many are out there and they're growling in sin and darkness and don't know anything about God but yet you are here this morning sitting in the house of God listening to the word of God bam will say and B Mike mention it about the pilgrim fathers butam says and he said they were happy that they found they had a new way of life and a new land land he he says here it says you may say that's all good to say with Thanksgiving he says you think about it brother Bram he says here it is it says quarter till 9 I didn't have nothing much but Thanksgiving it says what a message for the occasion yes indeed he says the pilgrim father were very thankful for the new way found new new found way of life being separated from the old English denomination and Creeds he says they could they could they could marry to the new anointed word of their age he says that's right the new anointed word of their age for their day he says so can we be thankful so can we be thankful as Pilgrim like Abraham separated ourselves separate ourselves from the things of the world and all of our association Abraham was a pilgrim God has said separated us from all the dead religions it says I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds it says and to what separate us to open to us a new land a new message for this day th this is not a message just like the message gone by this is a new land this is a new place remember there were what were they happy about they were happy for the new land in other word god opened to them a new land that they can go and live in so I want to say this don't get stuck in L here God has opened up to us a new land what is a new land it's a new land where all things are possible it's a new land where whatever you ask God shall give it to you it's a new land where there's no sickness where there's no headaches where there's nothing he's bringing you into this new land where you don't operate operate by the power of men you operate by the power of God a new land a place where they can do things not because of their own power but because of what God has done for them Pentecostal dried up he said like Luther and Wesley and the rest of them it was no more a bunch of churches pulled together God's people in there yet it says God people yet God's people in there yet as uh it says it's got It's got to come out it says what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the the seven seal of of the last of the last message he says you notice that the seven seal which all the mystery of the seven Church Ages was sealed with Seven Seals it says the reformers didn't have the time to do it in their day they didn't they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the seven seal it's open to us in the last day from a prophecy that went on forth in Arizona and I want to ask this morning what is the Seven Seals being open mean to you what does that mean to you because we have to know what is it that I'm appreciative about the Seven Seals brought Jesus Christ back on Earth the Seven Seals took the very word because remember you were dead in sin and denomination God promised that in the last day that he will have a bride according to his own choosing God promised that he would have a bride that will be just like him and the only way you could be just like him is for him to come down and dwell in you right outside of that all you have is intellect is your own understanding but it promise at the opening of the seal he took the book he brought it down he told you to eat the book why because he's giving you right back to you the very power the very the very uh uh book that was lost in the Garden of Eden so you can have the same Authority the same life that was in him he poured it into the church he poured it into his own people why that you can become his very representation in the last day the scripture will speak in Matthew and he says blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men has have desired to see those things things which you see and have not seen them and not heard and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them the scripture will speak and say this man they kept looking for it for what Manner is it it speaks and it said that the spirit it speak expressly saying of what Manner would it be that the spirit of God will come and will do these things they wanted to know what time but God hid it from them and he revealed it to you in Luke 1023 he said and he turned unto them unto his disciples and he said privately he said blessed are your eyes which see the things which you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and hear those things those things which he hear and have not heard them in second Corinthians 4 and6 and said for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined light in your in our hearts now let me say this it's not you shining the light it's not you Desiring the light God decided to shine the light in your heart to give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ he's the one who shes the light Matthew 16 and 17 and said and Jesus answered and said unto them blessed are thou Simon bar joural for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven so you want to get a revelation it has to come from the father it's the father's doing him taking the Revelation placing it in the believer's heart not your doing God choosing who gets the revelation oh I want to say this it's a good we have a good father what a wonderful father he is that he would choose to give us his revelation we are a blessed people that we can reveal this re we can get this Revelation and I want to say this morning then if our eyes are blessed then we need to keep him away from the things of the world if our ears are blessed then we need to keep it away from the fthy of the word why because they are blessed so you can serve it for God they are blessed so you can use it for God they are blessed so you can receive something from God they are not blessed so you can take it and use it for anything they are blessed because God has given you an understanding of his own word oh my there's so many scriptures I want to read right now and the pro and so in in the prophet will speak speak in this message it says that this as we read the scriptures in Romans chapter 7 uh the prophet will say cannot have two living husbands that one has to die amen that one has to die before you can be married to another he he's saying that this is an illustration he said it and an illustration is a visual representation of a concept to help someone see and understand something so here he speaks and and as we read it uh uh paragraph 37 he says Paul here is giving an illustration of the scripture about the law and Grace an illustration it it says in it's like a marriage and divorce it says this passage is very seldom preached on because it's more or less it says pertaining like marriage and divorce but it says but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce on how that he's trying to set listen to this how he's trying to set in order here that as CH as a church can no more be married to the world and cry and to Christ at the same time and be legal and loveful about it now remember because the the the the whole purpose of this message as he's preaching it he's saying that he's using the natural to really typify the spiritual so he wants as we can take the natural room and examine it and see what the principle is he wants us to tie to the spiritual and be able to understand the spiritual princi principle that God has given to us so he saying that the church the church can no more be married to the world and Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it that it could be from that he that than he could be for a woman to be to be living with a husband while she's uh she's got a living husband and I have my own thoughts on that it says and I believe that the Bible what the Bible says uh what the Bible uh the Bible says is to truth so here he is we we cannot claim to be the Church of the Living God we cannot claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and be married to both the world and the word at the same time now and often time when you say that people receive it in some kind of condemnation oh you're trying to tell me I'll go to hell no yes the prophet is trying to help you understand here is how you can maximize your potential here is how you can be better at what you you're supposed to be here is how you can get out of the things of the world here is how you can get out of sin and become The Virtuous bride here is how you can tell the devil I have no part with you because God elected me to be something else so I when I say it I want you to have that in your mind don't let the devil beat you down this morning and say well that means well if you are partaking of the things of the world you are lost in all of that he's saying that you cannot legally do that you otherwise you'll be called an adulterous you're not supposed to do that you're not supposed to trust God in some things and Trust in your own ability in others like our brother was speaking here our minds is always the source of our trouble God will drop something we'll try to interpret it otherwise well does it mean this does it mean that does it mean this we always have some ways to explain it out and the prophet is saying stop doing that you you cannot claim to be the bride of Christ because why because by definition the bride of Christ lives by every word that Christ speak yes sir we cannot depend on Christ and depend on our own selves we cannot do that we got to quit doing that we cannot on something we we do it according to our own thinking in another we take the word you got to take the word every time and I don't care what the result is you take the word why because when you take the word you put the responsibility upon the husband so now he's speaking about this church and and the Bible will speaking will say in Matthew 6 and 24 it says no man can can serve two masters for either he will hate one and love the other or else he will hold on to one and despise the other ye cannot serve God and Mamon so here's the same principle being repeated over and over 1 John 2:15 it says love not the world that neither the things of the world if any man loves the world it says For the Love of the father is not in him it says for all all that for for all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of eyes it says in this the father is and is not of the father for it says but but but is of the world James 4 and4 says that for for ye adulterers and adulterers he says know ye not that friendship with the world is imity to God whatsoever therefore will be friends with the world will be an enemy to God and the the devil's lie excuse me and is always to cause the believer to mix the two well I can let you go to church that's not a problem but after you come from church I have some things for you to do how many knows what I'm talking about it's a daily fight you you say I'm going to go to church something Breaks Loose oh we need you at work and we have need of you well I go I'm going to church why you're always constantly he's going to place you that way you're going to have to make a decision it it's it's he's inner working he's running out of time so his job is to always put you in situations where you're going to have to pick one over the other where you're going to have to make a decision where you're going to have to fight that battle over and over every day of Our Lives we're going to have to fight as long as we're still in this world he will always well you know you got bills to pay so if you go to that church and you don't take the overtime how are you going to pay the bills and what do we do well I need the overtime so I can pay the bills and then I'll go serve God God said no you can't do that this woman they because now remember when he's speaking he he's now bringing in view what he calls the natural church and this spiritual church so the natural Church butam says that it's it it comes by men's interpretation it's a it's the church that's that grows by knowledge by intellect it's the it's the church all they contend with as they come they read the Bible and then they go back and they do their own thing and and all of that and said blessed be the name of the Lord no but the spiritual church there's a supernatural that has to happen I I want you to hear me now there's a supernatural that has to happen I I was sharing this with Brother David let me say this when the urum tandem was given when a man will come and he will speak something if nothing flashed out of it you had the right to not believe it I if we believe the word of God and nothing flashes out of here to change your life you have the right to walk away why why because this is the urum tendem of God it's full of the supernatural every time you read it the honor has to come and flesh the supernatural before you otherwise you have the right to deny it we we cannot be a church that's just built on I'll do this and I'll do this like our pastor preached last time the the first church they had no Bible they had no person to tell them whatever what was it they were moved by the spirit of God they knew Peter James and John they said money I have Silver and Gold Have i n but that which I have what did they have they knew they had the promise of God they felt the power in the being they knew that the same power that was in him was in them we can't prosper in intellect what we need is for God to take his word and Flash it in our lives give us the Supernatural where we can speak the same word and it will come to pass where we can stand upon the same word and God will make it happen so it says notice this Char this characters when you see the woman just go on and ramp it just do doing anything that she want to do watch the church is doing the same thing it says but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begin to come back and line and and come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that there the scripture at the time there will be a message strip up uh strip out to catch the bride catch that woman elect for it says for as the world Satan the deceiver who deceives the first bride is it says the sinning again against the word by misbelieving his word he's always there to cause you to disbelieve the word of God God heals you he's there to bring new symptoms yeah you know oh you were healed well that cancer you thought it was gone it's back why because I'm feeling pain exactly where the cancer was and then your mind starts working on you and then you start thinking am I did I really receive healing was I really do this was was I why he always there to try to Buffet you he always there to try to cause you to dis believe the word but a True Believer of the spiritual church will always stand upon the word of God because it's not up to her to vindicate herself the message itself will vindicate itself God will make his word true and now today we see the church natural in an intellect in the gospel he says he goes further and further away from the word in Social Gospel they will preach and they will come and you know the church becomes like a social event and we'll have a a gathering for this and a gathering for this and Thursday night this and you know come and drinking night or coffee night and this it becomes just a social event and let me say this I know I'm running out of time I won't be able to finish but whatam said the church had a commission to do when God placed the church on Earth she had a work to do and the same way that the woman had the work to do the church had the work to do but what them said God give her charge she was given her charge for her to have the virtue of of the Lord Jesus Christ she was given three things he said the first one was the woman uh uh the woman word that she was given and the purpose for the woman word was for her to only but says her character was only for her to be attached to a husband and the next one was woman word it says the purpose for that was for them for him to Bear children for her husband and the third one he says was for her to honor her hus husband and so if we take the Natural Woman we move it to the spiritual woman you tell me what church is now bringing children honoring her husband and is there only given to her husband oh I like this great preacher is that your husband oh I I I like this and this book over here it is that the voice of your husband and brother will say you'll take the Bible and show them what the Bible says they will believe preacher over the Bible there'll believe some explanation from somebody instead of taking the word oh our Pastor said last time he said people say well I listen to the message then I listen to the preacher to balance it out oh really I guess we have different ways or different need for listening to the message I listen to the message because it's spiritual food in this season I listen to it so when the preacher preaches something else I won't take itall if it's not the word don't take it spew it out if it's the word embrace it why because the word is your husband the word is what's been given to you to change you so this sacred virtue that she was given the woman world the mother world and and and the honoring of her husband the church has lost but bam says in the condition that the church is in today they cannot fulfill that commission why because the focus is no longer Jesus Christ the focus is no longer what God is wanting to do in the hour that we are living in the focus is now oh we're going to go this great move we're going to go do this we're going to go do that you the the husband is no longer being regarded and let me just read some of the things the prophet said here for the second of time now as we read as I said he speaks about this and baram said what we need today is a killing we need we need to die to our own thinking we we need to die to our own interpretation if if something is not the word you got to kill it you you got a to produce God don't want us to be lukewarm where we are attached to the world and then attached to the word he don't want you to do that when you do that you become an adulterous you become one who doubts the word you become one who's not fully committed what God wants to do he wants to manifest himself to you so by believing the word you are taken out of your cycle and put into God's cycle he says this he says this in the message I will restore it says what we need today is an oldfashioned skyu sin killing religion sweep across the country the old time St Paul Revival it says the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the church again he says the best defense the better defense than any atom bomb that ever was created that's right fundamental but God was Vindicated in his church what we need is not uh uh some great things out of here we need the fundamental of the word of God to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he promised he will do he is going to do it he doesn't need your help to do it let's not get be lost and you know we don't have to produce something so God can accept it we need to believe the word and let the word produce what he needs to produce out of us in the hidden life in Christ brother bam says paragraph uh um 32 two he says now we don't have to get some kind of uh makeup and and and some kind of emotional mental makeup we don't have to we don't have to take something that the something the devil would would hand down but every believer that comes from the that comes from the altar to the consecrated life to the baptism of the Holy Ghost cannot only be it canot not only be a mouthful but a soul full of the original baptism oh I tell you when I read that I said God I need that this morning I need to go and take some manner A Soulful not a MTH full but A Soulful something that will satisfy something that will change me something that I can say I was this and I'm no longer that something that God himself can produce I don't want to goow today at the altar tomorrow at the altar my desire is God you reveal your word I want to receive it and be changed and never be the same but a soul full of the original baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost that brings the same result as it did on the day of Pentecost amen the message of the hour will produce the same result as what he did at Pentecost when the spirit fell on Pentecost it was to fulfill the word of that hour but God in the end time he has another word for this hour and the word for the end time hour is that God will produce sons and daughters that are even like him those that will walk according to his word those that will believe his word and believe every bit of it for the promise for the the promises unto your children and your children's children and to them that are far off as many as our Lord God shall call he said brothering the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost that brought the results then will bring the same result over every believer tonight that's willing to consecrate their life and to enter and enter into the holiest of Hest by the blood of Jesus Christ let me just skip some for the sake of time he says he says here in the world is Fallen apart he says what we need today is an old fashion backwards sky blue sin killing religion and the baptism of the Holy Ghost back into the church again and and a cleaning out it says b uh Gun Barrel straight sky blue religion we need a cleaning out and the starting all over again we we let me say this mixing will only produce death we we don't want to come to church and be the mixer of our own ideas is our own thinking with the word of God we don't want to come here with some half belief and oh we'll believe this but when it says over here we really don't understand we'll believe every word of God what the prophet said we'll say Amen to it if it says he takes the new birth this morning I say God I need the new birth in order for me to get there if he says this is what you need to do that's what I will do so I can get there so it's not my own interpretation but it's what he said that's what I believe and butam says as we said she yes she is is this woman she's interested oh my she's interested but will say she's interested with certain characteristic and he goes on and he said no other woman was created like this woman the church or Eve he says if you look at all out of the animal and all out the kingdom no other species could commit adultery but the woman could I want you to listen to this so and and the prophet will say she was created she was special I and I I I I'm speaking about the woman but I want you to look at yourself there was something special about her but whatam says this but because she was cast over to the other side she had been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption she's got a characteristic that must be not be defiled so because of the role that she was given no other woman no other species female could fit that same characteristics now I want you to hear now if I can expand for just a moment but what I'm speaks in the T church is he says this let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation As We Know it today God made every Everything a pair male and female there was two uh uh chickens or rooster in hand there was two cattles cow and a bull and right down the line but when it came to a man there was only one it says there was only one pair one not a pair Adam had been made in the image of God he was a Son of God as a Son of God he could not be temped tempted and fall it says that would be impossible so God took a byproduct of man to cause to cause the fail woman he says never stepped fresh never stepped fresh from the hands of God as the man as a as a man as a man a true product of God she was produced from man are you listening he says now when God caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from other females and he created and that he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human but the human female may be touched at almost any time and then he says and when and that weakness in her allows Satan to seduce her by the way of The Serpent and it brought the woman to a very peculiar position before God and His word are you following listen to this now she is the type of all things vulgar file loome and of of on one hand and then it says and on the other hand she is the very type of things clean beautiful holy and and as the uh receptable of the spirit and the blessings of God on one hand she can be called a who is drunk with the wine of the fornication on the other hand you said she's on the other side on the other she is called the bride of Christ on one hand she's called mystery babyon the Abomination before God on the other hand she's called the New Jerusalem mother on on one hand she's she's so foul and wicked and lwd and she's she's a sumary cast down in the Lake of Fire and the only uh only fit place for her on the other she is exalted to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as the only beiting place for such a queen now let and I want you to see the the the mystery all the unfolding of this as the prophet is saying so as you are today if but when Satan gets hold of you he can hand Satan gets hold of a a woman or a church or an individual he can M your life and twist it up so much and make you nothing and make you a bum but on the other side the other person you yourself can be cleaned off and become the very child of God so when you when and that's where the Prophet now is bringing this you cannot be in the world and in God at the same time so on one hand if you're not careful the SAT can come and cause all kind of dysfunction and and all kinds of sicknesses all kinds of chaos but on the other hand you could be the very representation of Jesus Christ here on Earth same person not two same person when he caral he could be the P the worst person he could be a murderer he can commit sin that things that a man cannot do that's why pro the prophet will say a man without the Holy Ghost is nothing but a br beast on one hand you you you see the the the the catastrophe and the things that men can do you wonder how is this possible but on the other hand she stand there as the true Son of God as the very true representation of God and the things that you can do no one else can do and so the prophet will say and he said now there's this representation but what is it about you that's so different about all of that God promise that as this church will be this way that God that's why I said but I'm called this my Thanksgiving message what is Thanksgiving about he's saying that there will be an elected lady a lady her name will be called Grace I about to just sing a song Grace Grace Grace what is Grace in other word it's God's Own intervention mention about a certain group of people he said that as the others will go this direction and do that I will have a people that are called by my name a people that I have chosen before the foundation of the world a people even though they had a certain destination they had to go I stepped in and I gave up my own life and redeemed them he says now he says what is Grace he says for it's Grace that's by Grace we are saved by grace we are saved not nothing we can do but what not what we can do but it doesn't count to us God's grace saved us by Grace we are saved through faith it says may I what I'm saying this may I add this to this woman Grace it says may I place her in the Bible it says also I call her elected lady lady elected lady Miss Grace I'm going to talk about it it says the Bible declares that to the elect lady that if you notice elect comes from the word elected lady one among all others was elected so when all of this is happened when the Natural Woman is doing all the the things that she's doing but whatam says there is an elected and a spiritual lady that is been called to this generation she's been taken out of all the natural things she's been brought into the spiritual she's been divorced from a whole husband and being brought into the new he said he speaks about Mary she didn't do anything to deserve it she wasn't the only virgin there was virgin that was in that time but what happened Mary was chosen God came to Mary and the prophet will dramatize at one place and speak about how they had just gone out and they were listening to the word and as they were going back home and when it talked about the prophecy of Isaiah that a virgin shall conceive all that she done was she just let the word that the that the priest and what was read just go into her mind and she was thinking on the word of God at all time she just let the word come into a mind and all of the sudden it began to create an atmosphere all of the sudden everything began to change all of the sudden an angel appear the trouble with us is we can't keep the word on our mind we have all kinds of things to fill our calendar I got to do this I got to do this I got to do this I got to do this and there's no place for the word to reason in our mind oh and it says and also God has chosen an elected lady which is his bride she's elected and it says I hope we are remembering that tonight across the world Across the Nation so this lady at the end time she was elected by God from before the foundation of the world and why are so important but what I'm say say to the elected one God is calling because when this message goes out it's not calling just for anybody there's an elected person what we read at the beginning it says blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear so this message is given to fall into specific ears of people those that will hear and obey it others will hear it they will hear it they will fight against it they will hear it they will deny it but there are those that will hear and believe it and I'm so glad I'm one of [Music] them what are you thankful about God open my eyes to see the message of the hour and if he open my eyes to see it he's going to open he's going to bring about the transformation that I need in order for me to get there Hallelujah that's right that's right is that what the Bible says blessed are you because God opened your eyes now if he open it he didn't open it just so he can say I open your eyes he opened it so you can see it so you can be changed by it so you can be transformed by it it says God the true virtuous Bride of the Lord he says the last day the church elected Lady of Jesus Christ Jesus is the word how many believe that the congregation said amen all right then it says the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ he promised to do that and he said that he did he says uh uh never never uses or or loses his pattern it says he always did it by the pattern he done it every time and he says by the pattern he does it again calling out the virtuous bride in the last day a lovely Rebecca waiting for I for her heac what a beautiful time your natural birth or your first birth the prophet will call it the only thing it did is brought death into your life and the prophet will say this by your natural birth because of the way you were born you came and loving the things of the world with the nature of the world in you and all of that stuff but he also said that the real you or the original you was not made to be a liar amen because if we were made to be a liar and adultery and all those things why are we here why are we gathering this building he says that your natural birth or your first birth was the representation of what the book of life was so everything that was born because God is the originator of Life your name was placed in the The Book of Life and the Book of Life was only a record of all the things that you had done but he said somewhere along the way your name was transferred into the Lamb's Book of Life and what is the Lamb Book of Life he said your lamb Book of Life he says well you were separated from the union by spiritual death now you are born again your new birth you are born again and remember married again now I want you to understand the the little thing that is injecting here you are remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your spir of not the natural life or of the things of the world but of the eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you that germ that was in you at the beginning found you so yeah the prophet he speaks oh if I could just preach it oh he comes and he says yeah you are you were caught in sin and and all kinds of things but then when the message come across it says when it comes his preaching it says there was a germ of life that was to be you in the beginning that was laying inside of you so therefore it says in fact it says you were married you remarried again but is saying that before you can actually come here it says God took you and he put the wedding band of predestination on your finger you were actually married before you were even born help me understand that you were actually married before you came here on Earth so that's why when Satan got hold of you that marriage could not have been legal why because you already married Hall and when God comes he gives his life but about him says he's the only one who has power to do this think about it when he talks about justification he says he though it says you never done it in the first place what did God do he says only God could do this by taking his own blood by dying for your place God takes the only thing he doesn't forgive it he annihilates the whole thing hallu so you were married and there's no record to prove it yes you can't find it anywhere God throws it in the sea of forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered anymore I read it I said this is crazy that's the gospel we believe that's rightall I'm like this is Magic I need me some of this magic I tell you you cannot understand this by your human mind this is beyond the human mind that God will take you you say I'm the one who killed here I'm the one who fornicated here I'm the one who done this over here he says you were deceived into it you were deceived into it that was not the real you it was because you adulterous parent they committed sin because you came that way you couldn't help yourself so therefore when I come I annihilate everything it's not just a divorce it's an Annihilation it's not that wedding never existed that's the power of the Living God we are serving hallu I want to ask you this morning what is too hard to that for that God to do for you what is hard for that God to do for you he he his blood is his own bleach but whatam says when he takes aor he drops it in there the comp every color has a composition it's probably B 12 B5 A6 or whatever but when it goes back in there it it dissimulates it goes right back into the original Adams that's the marriage that you have tonight and I want to beg you this morning do not be married to the world or the things of the world believe the Lord Jesus Christ this morning if you don't know him as a savior know him as a savior this morning if you have doubts in your mind Cast Away all your doubt believe him only and he will bring that he will give you the desires of your heart one who's able to come on the scene and he comes and the said the devil says this one his mind he says it cannot be yours because why I chose this one before the foundation of the world I died for him before he even came I married him before he even came you have no knowledge of what I did before you can even so up before you touch him I had already elected him the prophet said the first Eve she was a byproduct and God knew that the devil will get in there and do what he did but he said the second Eve she's the word and then he says she cannot fall why because she is the very word of God so if God can fail this eve cannot fail why because she's the very word manifested in the end time what a Thanksgiving message this morning let's all stand this morning oh God what can be thankful about this morning we are so much we have so much to be thankful about of what he has done for us oh my it says hallelujah you notice you are not only that but you are you are going to the wedding in the sky you are wearing the wedding band of predestination UNM merited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited Grace of God it says God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band of on on there it says but put your name on the book that's what a Thanksgiving hallelujah praise God and he says at one place that the Lamb's Book of Life not the Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life is your marriage certificate you married yes how do you prove it the Lamb's Book of of Life something that was done before I even came here you know to the world that this sounds how do you believe that how could you believe that well I'm like that one little Eagle all I knew was chicken stuff all I knew was confess your sin believe in God and you shall be saved and I tried it and I tried it and somehow it never seemed to satisfy oh you got to do this and the cycle of repent uh uh uh re Revival and death as the prophet will call it oh you do this today you do that tomorrow you do follow this 10 step and do this over here and after you've done the 10 steps then they call you a sinner again you got to go back and follow the seven step on the other side it just seems like they didn't have it it just never seemed to satis but one day this chicken or this Eagle just there and they they were told about this great mother Eagle this great Eagle that will come and it will hunt for chicken so he can eat it and it was told that the moment you hear it scream go hide that's the instruction it was given it was told never stay in the open it's going to come and pick you up he heard the instruction but all of the sudden when they heard the Cry of the M Eagle he forgot the instructions you heard the cry the instruction got away all of the sudden something within the heart say I want to be this you hear the message of the hour says it's music to your ear others are running the instruction is don't listen to it but you heard it it was music to your ear you're like this is something I want to be oh if I'm going to serve a God
