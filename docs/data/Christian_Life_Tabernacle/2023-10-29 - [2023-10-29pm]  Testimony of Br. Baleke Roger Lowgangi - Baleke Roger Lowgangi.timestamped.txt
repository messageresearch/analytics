[43:25] God
[43:27] you worked with the prophet in this same
[43:29] [Music]
[43:32] time you also worked with Believers in
[43:35] this end
[43:39] time we ask that you may come on the
[43:42] scene at this
[43:45] [Music]
[43:49] moment we also ask that the testimony
[43:51] will give let it be a blessing for your
[43:55] children
[44:01] [Music]
[44:02] let it not be something someone will
[44:05] glorify himself but this is to prove

[44:49] God a Believers like
[44:54] you to stand here to
[44:57] speak it's not given to
[45:00] everybody it's a grace of
[45:13] God as you can see I'm not a preacher I
[45:16] don't know the the procedures but I'm a
[45:18] Child of God I can say
[45:24] something
[45:26] what I want to say to you is a testimony
[45:28] that God can use
[45:32] anybody when we believe through the
[45:34] message of the end
[45:35] [Music]
[45:42] time we didn't have the mindset of
[45:45] trying to verify everything or check
[45:47] everything in on the
[45:54] internet
[45:56] it was something that we found that we
[45:58] could hold we could hold on to it was
[46:00] our last
[46:03] hope we didn't have hope in the
[46:10] world we are we were not born in Rich
[46:13] families or families that were known
[46:15] among
[46:21] men personally myself when I was young
[46:24] when I was going to the primary school I
[46:26] didn't even have
[46:30] clothes uh Society didn't accept me
[46:32] because I was very
[46:38] skinny even the family under which I was
[46:41] leaving I was really not looked at as
[46:43] the child of that
[46:49] family that means the message to me was
[46:52] something that gave me
[46:54] hope
[46:57] it it transformed
[47:02] me I didn't have any other preoccupation
[47:05] as others
[47:08] do all I did was to pray
[47:13] God because because I had found comfort
[47:16] in the
[47:21] message that's why I believe the message
[47:24] of William Bram uh uh back then when we
[47:27] found the message we will go and print
[47:29] it
[47:31] out we will print it out in many
[47:35] copies and we will give it to
[47:41] brothers and we will uh give it out to
[47:44] brothers and everything that the prophet
[47:46] will say will say Amen to
[47:50] it even if we didn't understand what he
[47:53] was saying we'll just say Amen to it
[47:55] examp as an
[48:00] example the the the one of the messages
[48:04] that attracted me to the message was
[48:06] who's this who's this
[48:09] MC it's it's a it's a really message
[48:11] that's very difficult to
[48:20] understand we believed it because we
[48:22] when we saw the pillar of fire we knew
[48:24] that it was God
[48:32] as I was saying the from my youth I was
[48:35] really a child who was rejected from
[48:44] society when we found the message we
[48:46] found out it was something that I could
[48:48] really hang on
[48:54] to
[48:58] that's why God really used us because we
[49:01] didn't have time to go verify to check
[49:03] whether it was true or
[49:06] not I grew up in religion such as I was
[49:16] Baptist but if you look at what was
[49:18] happening in the choir or the preacher
[49:20] it was terrible
[49:24] things
[49:27] there was friendship or between the the
[49:30] I guess dating between people in the
[49:36] choir it was contrary to the word of
[49:40] God that's why when we found the message
[49:42] of the
[49:47] hour we found something that we could
[49:50] hang on to
[49:54] deeply now for that
[50:00] reason we never had to verify or even
[50:04] doubt upon the
[50:06] message and that was the reason why God
[50:09] used
[50:10] [Music]
[50:17] us I will try to just take few points
[50:20] because every all the things that God
[50:22] has done in my
[50:24] life
[50:28] they are amazing things that even myself
[50:31] could not
[50:34] understand I'll start with my
[50:38] youth I I grew up as an
[50:41] orphan in a big
[50:44] family we were about
[50:47] nine I was very
[50:51] skinning when it was time to
[50:54] eat
[50:57] it was the the strongest who would eat
[50:59] the
[51:02] most when I'll try to put my hand into
[51:04] the
[51:07] bowl others will hold my
[51:11] hand and they will try to pinch
[51:15] me I was asking why the were my
[51:19] brothers I didn't
[51:21] understand now at the age of 12
[51:28] that's when I started to try to
[51:30] understand what was going
[51:31] on I would come back from primary
[51:35] school it was about 1 100 p.m. 1:30 p.m.
[51:53] okay so where I live they would build
[51:56] houses with uh they would put like trees
[51:59] and then they'll put uh uh bricks in
[52:01] between and then they'll put cement uh
[52:03] on
[52:09] top the one I was calling my sister he
[52:12] was really not my sister but we were
[52:14] going together in a
[52:17] family yeah she asked me if I can go and
[52:20] and fetch some
[52:23] water it was a distance
[52:26] about six 7
[52:32] Kil and at the age of 11 imagine a
[52:35] little child a little kid with a a
[52:38] gallon uh 20 lers uh uh uh container
[52:42] right
[52:45] and I said at this
[52:48] time I said I just came from
[52:51] school I am
[52:54] hungry
[52:57] can you give me something to eat before
[52:59] I go fetch
[53:01] water they were cooking
[53:08] beans she
[53:10] took spoon of beans she put in a in a a
[53:13] small bow and she gave
[53:17] me she told me to go and get
[53:20] water when I went out of the
[53:24] house
[53:25] the one who was supposed to be my
[53:29] father he had a hammer in his
[53:34] hand he thought that I stole the
[53:40] beans and he took the hammer and he hit
[53:43] me in the
[53:46] head and here there's a there's a
[53:52] scar and there was blood spilling
[53:55] I
[53:56] ran when I
[53:59] ran I felt like my head was about to
[54:02] fall
[54:03] off at that
[54:05] time I didn't know the
[54:08] message I I ran into the
[54:14] bush I felt like my head was about to
[54:17] fall
[54:22] off I I had a a long uh black
[54:28] T-shirt and I tried to to cover
[54:35] it I felt like my heart was about to get
[54:38] out of my
[54:42] chest where I went to
[54:46] hide and I said it was about 1:30
[54:51] p.m I fall and I fall I I dropped and
[54:55] then I fall
[54:59] asleep that's when the Lord came and
[55:01] talked to
[55:02] me I was not a
[55:06] Christian when he came and visited
[55:11] me it was as if I was in a
[55:14] dream they came three of
[55:21] them the three
[55:24] people
[55:26] the one I could call uh the the the
[55:32] doctor he started working on my
[55:40] wounds I really loved
[55:49] school I I already I I was already
[55:52] feeling like my head was about to fall
[55:54] off
[55:57] I said that means I will never go to
[56:01] school when the doctor
[56:05] came those three were
[56:09] Angels one had a a plate they had like a
[56:12] plate in his
[56:14] hand like a serving
[56:16] plate the
[56:23] other he had like cartons of things to
[56:26] to try to take away the
[56:30] blood and the one that I would call the
[56:37] doctor he started to touch me on the
[56:39] shoulder like a good doctor he
[56:50] said and yeah I was what was amazing he
[56:54] knew what what I was thinking because at
[56:56] that moment I was thinking that here I
[56:59] am I wouldn't be able to go to
[57:01] school and he started telling me don't
[57:04] be
[57:05] afraid you're going to go to
[57:08] school and you're going to be very smart
[57:11] and I
[57:17] said how is it possible because when I
[57:20] touch my head I feel like it's it's
[57:22] split in
[57:23] two he said I'll be with
[57:28] you
[57:30] no no I said
[57:33] no I'm not going back
[57:38] home because the one I thought was my
[57:41] father who did this to me is going to
[57:42] kill
[57:43] me he said
[57:45] this I will be with you I will protect
[57:50] you and you're going to go to
[57:53] school and you will you will
[57:58] succeed he started to to give me love
[58:02] like a good
[58:08] doctor what what really touched me was
[58:10] his
[58:12] hand when he touched me with his
[58:15] hand I felt the
[58:18] [Music]
[58:20] peace I felt something I cannot
[58:23] explain
[58:25] and from that
[58:26] time that
[58:29] person has always been with
[58:32] me because when I went back
[58:37] home he gave me this Spirit of
[58:41] [Music]
[58:44] forgiveness the the the the person that
[58:47] I thought was a father who G who hit me
[58:49] with a
[58:53] hammer
[58:56] I I I I felt the the part of my the
[58:59] forgiveness was
[59:01] automatic
[59:04] but the the grandmother who taking care
[59:07] of
[59:15] me I say that because I started to try
[59:18] to investigate
[59:20] if they wanted to split or or to divorce
[59:25] because at that
[59:26] time the one I was calling
[59:29] Mom it started telling
[59:36] him you know that my daughter passed
[59:38] away and he and and she left behind this
[59:44] child how can you beat the child to this
[59:51] point that's when I understood that I
[59:53] was not his child but I was his his
[59:56] daughter's
[59:58] child then from that
[1:00:01] time the man that I called the
[1:00:06] doctor he started revealing to me a lot
[1:00:08] of
[1:00:11] things I could see in the family who who
[1:00:14] was uh who had
[1:00:18] witchcraft even in the
[1:00:20] village if someone had
[1:00:23] witchcraft
[1:00:27] I could I when I go to sleep I can see
[1:00:29] that in the
[1:00:32] vision the one that I was calling my
[1:00:34] older
[1:00:36] brother it was a it was a very U brutal
[1:00:43] man when we went to school with
[1:00:48] him he was uh he would uh take stones
[1:00:51] and throw away at Mary
[1:00:53] stature
[1:00:55] because at the time they home in
[1:01:03] Africa that the the Catholic Church they
[1:01:06] built statute of Mary and all of the uh
[1:01:09] uh Crossroad points where there's
[1:01:12] traffic
[1:01:16] light they placed different statues at
[1:01:19] different
[1:01:22] places until now they have those even
[1:01:35] now and I I would tell him the one I was
[1:01:39] I would call my older brother I'll said
[1:01:40] I saw the the Witchcraft of someone I
[1:01:44] saw it at such
[1:01:46] tree and we're going to go
[1:01:49] there because it was very
[1:01:53] brutal
[1:01:57] and we're going to try to remove those
[1:02:01] trees and we're going to find
[1:02:05] it and that brought me a lot of trouble
[1:02:08] in the the place I was living in
[1:02:13] but the man who said that I'll be with
[1:02:16] you he was always protecting
[1:02:21] me I was not vulnerable to uh
[1:02:29] Witchcraft and that's what it caused all
[1:02:32] of those people that were practicing it
[1:02:33] to find out who who I really
[1:02:37] was I didn't know the message of the
[1:02:39] hour at that
[1:02:42] time and then we'll get to the second
[1:02:45] Point how did I get to the message of
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:49] hour in
[1:02:52] 1998 1988
[1:02:58] 89 uh they were doing um they were they
[1:03:02] trying to identify
[1:03:10] everybody uh we were selected as young
[1:03:13] people of the the location I was living
[1:03:15] in who knew how to read and
[1:03:17] write and we were able to identify
[1:03:23] people we were we were doing a
[1:03:26] competition of
[1:03:34] signatures I I wanted to have a
[1:03:37] signature that was the most complicated
[1:03:39] than all than
[1:03:46] everybody I had a friend whose mom was
[1:03:48] selling bananas and and
[1:03:51] peanuts in
[1:03:53] schools
[1:03:57] he had a the message that we call who's
[1:04:00] this
[1:04:03] MDC and I saw the signature of of the
[1:04:07] Prophet I said this is a good
[1:04:12] signature that no one can
[1:04:15] imitate that's how I believe the
[1:04:18] message I took the
[1:04:23] message I read the first verse when
[1:04:26] brother Bram was
[1:04:27] praying that
[1:04:31] prayer it captured
[1:04:33] me I memorized
[1:04:36] it when I would go to
[1:04:39] church when they asked me to
[1:04:43] pray I would pray like brother Bram was
[1:04:46] praying and when I would
[1:04:50] say keep us under the blood of Jesus
[1:04:56] that was it wasn't something that was
[1:04:57] said in Baptist
[1:05:01] Churches the blood of Jesus they had no
[1:05:04] understanding of what that
[1:05:06] means and I wanted to know who that
[1:05:08] person
[1:05:09] was I I imitated his
[1:05:15] signature that's how I came to to know
[1:05:18] what the message of the Y was I was I
[1:05:21] was going to school with a
[1:05:23] brother
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:28] I will keep his identity because he
[1:05:30] works with the army of in
[1:05:34] cono is someone great in the Army in
[1:05:53] Congo yeah so going back the man who
[1:05:55] told me that I the one I called Doctor
[1:05:58] Who told me you will be
[1:06:06] smart I was I I studying commercial
[1:06:10] things and
[1:06:16] administration there was uh no one able
[1:06:19] to to complete the accounting
[1:06:22] exam but I was able to do
[1:06:28] it when I would try to give answers to
[1:06:31] my
[1:06:33] schoolmate that brother that person
[1:06:35] would not allow
[1:06:39] me I asked him why you don't teach
[1:06:43] in cheat in
[1:06:51] school that everyone in school they knew
[1:06:54] that if I gave them an answer that they
[1:06:56] were going to
[1:06:58] pass but that Brier would not let me do
[1:07:01] that I wanted to know why I asked him a
[1:07:09] question I said everyone in this class
[1:07:12] they take the answers that I give them
[1:07:13] why you don't want to take
[1:07:20] it and but him he if he if he would take
[1:07:24] for him to give his paper back blank he
[1:07:26] would do
[1:07:28] it he told me that he was a Christian
[1:07:32] I'm a
[1:07:33] Christian I told him aren't we all
[1:07:39] Christians he said I believe the message
[1:07:41] of
[1:07:46] Bram I remember the the the message that
[1:07:49] I had come in contact with because it
[1:07:51] was written William Marian brandham
[1:07:56] and I asked him I said I want to know
[1:07:57] where you go to church
[1:07:59] at he invited me to
[1:08:01] church I went to
[1:08:04] church when I got into the church oh my
[1:08:13] goodness it's an atmosphere that I never
[1:08:16] felt in any other
[1:08:17] church at that
[1:08:20] time when you get into the
[1:08:22] church as a
[1:08:26] sinner the the
[1:08:31] deacons you could be easily
[1:08:39] found it was it was very
[1:08:43] fearful that's why I
[1:08:46] loved the
[1:08:47] message and
[1:08:52] now
[1:08:55] there there was no day that the church
[1:08:57] was gathering that I will
[1:08:59] miss uh back home in
[1:09:02] Africa we were meeting on Wednesday on
[1:09:06] Thursday and
[1:09:09] Friday it was an
[1:09:15] occupation we continue to gather
[1:09:18] together everything that the prophet
[1:09:20] will say we will say Amen
[1:09:24] even if we didn't understand it we will
[1:09:27] say
[1:09:30] Amen we never argue the message of the
[1:09:33] Prophet even if it was
[1:09:36] difficult we will say because the
[1:09:38] prophet said it we accept
[1:09:41] it we will understand
[1:09:46] later that's how God started to work
[1:09:49] with us because Us in
[1:09:52] Africa when we pray
[1:09:54] God we go to to our
[1:09:56] knees and we can pray
[1:10:01] God 30 to 40
[1:10:05] minutes that's how God used
[1:10:11] us it wasn't because we were smart or we
[1:10:14] had something special but it was that
[1:10:19] way I will get on the third section
[1:10:21] third part
[1:10:28] I'll get on the fourth
[1:10:31] part how that God protected
[1:10:34] us against
[1:10:37] Witchcraft and the
[1:10:40] Witchcraft it was a member of the
[1:10:43] family because when I believe the
[1:10:45] message of BR Bram my whole
[1:10:52] family
[1:10:54] they say that this child is enter into
[1:10:57] the uh uh magician
[1:11:01] religion every because everybody was
[1:11:05] Catholic it was the the family
[1:11:10] religion if you were to be a Baptist
[1:11:13] that was
[1:11:14] acceptable but the message of William
[1:11:17] Bram you could not you shouldn't touch
[1:11:20] it they kicked me out of the house
[1:11:29] I didn't have clothes I have probably
[1:11:30] two
[1:11:32] shorts they put it in the bag and they
[1:11:36] threw
[1:11:37] it
[1:11:40] go go go on those to those churches that
[1:11:43] you
[1:11:44] go the Church of
[1:11:50] magicians so when we preach here we say
[1:11:53] the seed of of God when you have the
[1:11:55] seed of
[1:11:56] God there's nothing that can stop you I
[1:12:06] went I felt like even though I was being
[1:12:09] kicked out at the house but I had the
[1:12:12] message I continue to believe through
[1:12:14] the message of
[1:12:16] brand my brothers with the love of
[1:12:19] Brothers they took me in their
[1:12:22] house I grew up
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:30] there correct and I I became a Christian
[1:12:34] I'm not pretending to be the best
[1:12:35] Christians but I was my my life was
[1:12:41] correct it was a life that was different
[1:12:44] from other
[1:12:46] kids because when I look
[1:12:52] behind all all of the generations the
[1:12:54] older brothers the one I called the
[1:12:56] older
[1:12:57] brothers they they entered into
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] criminality others were
[1:13:07] thieves they they they they behave they
[1:13:10] behaved themselves in the worst way
[1:13:13] possible but I was a very humble child
[1:13:17] because of this
[1:13:20] message that's how God kept me
[1:13:26] until
[1:13:28] 1994 I continue to believe the
[1:13:32] message there was a genocide in
[1:13:39] Rwanda yeah that place I'm going to try
[1:13:41] to to to to U watch what I disclose
[1:13:50] yes because the genocide that took place
[1:13:52] in Rwanda in
[1:13:57] 1994 it it wasn't because the tribe was
[1:14:01] hating each
[1:14:03] other it was in international
[1:14:10] politics it was it was manipulated by
[1:14:14] great International
[1:14:17] communities and at that
[1:14:20] time what I did
[1:14:25] to to save
[1:14:27] children it was not of My Own
[1:14:30] Strength it was the strength of
[1:14:37] God I was able to infiltrate the camp of
[1:14:41] the
[1:14:44] enemy I saved about
[1:14:47] 175
[1:14:49] kids they were they were kids of
[1:14:52] soldiers
[1:14:55] and that almost cost me my
[1:15:04] life because when the the general
[1:15:07] realized that they were missing about
[1:15:09] 175
[1:15:11] kids he wanted to know who did
[1:15:17] it among those that are called
[1:15:22] children it was kids uh between 9 and 17
[1:15:25] years
[1:15:27] old among those
[1:15:31] children there was one who had a
[1:15:36] friend and the girl was not allowed to
[1:15:40] to cross the
[1:15:41] border because she was uh she was from
[1:15:46] Rhonda she started
[1:15:51] crying she said she said said they took
[1:15:53] my
[1:15:58] husband and it was that girl who who
[1:16:01] told them about
[1:16:03] me and then he said that it's me who did
[1:16:05] all of
[1:16:08] this and the general paid
[1:16:11] $3,000 in in in 1995 it was about a lot
[1:16:15] of money 96 it was a lot of money it was
[1:16:19] a lot of
[1:16:20] money he gave it to soldiers
[1:16:25] he said I want you to find me this
[1:16:28] man uh uh
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:34] LLY this Doctor Who told me that I'll be
[1:16:37] with
[1:16:40] you he was telling me what was happening
[1:16:42] in the other Camp I could see
[1:16:48] things when I went when I go to
[1:16:52] sleep I could see things play
[1:16:57] out they sent a lot of soldiers to come
[1:16:59] find
[1:17:10] me I I ran I tried to run I they they
[1:17:13] couldn't find they couldn't see me but I
[1:17:16] know I was thinking they could see
[1:17:22] me
[1:17:24] I was wondering how how is it possible
[1:17:26] that I went by that road that that way
[1:17:29] but they didn't see me it was a lot of
[1:17:33] soldiers they they couldn't find
[1:17:38] me so I ran to the other
[1:17:42] side and I went to stay in the
[1:17:45] camp in the uh refugee
[1:17:48] camp and they continue to try to find
[1:17:52] me and the Lord told
[1:17:56] me he said take the take the
[1:17:59] phone I called
[1:18:03] him because I could even see his phone
[1:18:08] number I called
[1:18:12] him I said I told him I said I know you
[1:18:15] paid $3,000 to find me but
[1:18:19] now I know where you live I know
[1:18:24] address I could tell him his
[1:18:27] address I could tell him the road where
[1:18:30] he was
[1:18:31] living he was very
[1:18:36] terrified to see that he was looking for
[1:18:41] me and now I'm telling him that I'm
[1:18:43] going to I'm going to come find him
[1:18:45] where he
[1:18:47] lives he was so
[1:18:49] terrified that
[1:18:51] night he's a he was a general he ran
[1:18:56] away he ran away that
[1:18:59] night and he went to another
[1:19:04] place I I I I didn't have any ability to
[1:19:07] do him
[1:19:08] anything but I just used that
[1:19:13] tactic it's God who gave me that
[1:19:16] tactic and that at that
[1:19:19] time I
[1:19:21] understood that our God
[1:19:24] is a mighty
[1:19:25] God he can do all
[1:19:28] things he can use
[1:19:31] anybody he can use
[1:19:33] you only if you commit
[1:19:38] yourself in his
[1:19:42] hands you you you keep
[1:19:47] yourself you keep yourself from
[1:19:51] sin God can use you
[1:19:53] even the little
[1:19:55] child
[1:20:01] now I'm going to get to where how did I
[1:20:03] get to the
[1:20:06] US I'm trying to summarize certain
[1:20:11] things because at that
[1:20:14] time I was the the the most wanted
[1:20:19] man but they were not able to find me
[1:20:25] where I went to hide in the
[1:20:27] camp I continue to pray I continue to
[1:20:31] pray I told
[1:20:36] God I I can't it's hard for me to
[1:20:40] continue to hide every
[1:20:43] time I feel like I'm
[1:20:48] tired is there no way for you to save me
[1:20:51] from this circumstance
[1:20:55] I started to go pray up the
[1:21:00] mountain it was a very dangerous
[1:21:10] place it's a place where the genocide
[1:21:13] took place in a in in a great
[1:21:16] numbers a certain
[1:21:19] morning I went to
[1:21:21] pray I was praying in the
[1:21:29] cave it was from uh uh 5:30 till uh uh
[1:21:33] 400
[1:21:37] p.m. people were looking for me in the
[1:21:40] camp they thought that I was
[1:21:47] killed because my my my my my my
[1:21:49] children they were saying that our dad
[1:21:51] went to pray but he's not come back
[1:21:55] and the people mobilized themselves so
[1:21:57] they can look for
[1:21:59] me when I was
[1:22:02] coming they started
[1:22:06] screaming they didn't know where how
[1:22:09] where I
[1:22:11] was now everybody knew that I was going
[1:22:13] to pray over
[1:22:18] there there was a a woman who was
[1:22:20] praying in the camp
[1:22:23] she was a
[1:22:26] Pentecostal they have this uh the gift
[1:22:29] of Prophecy or
[1:22:31] Vision uh she called
[1:22:38] me she told me do you know that where
[1:22:41] you go to pray there's a lion who lives
[1:22:43] in that
[1:22:45] cave I said I didn't
[1:22:49] know he said if you will see him
[1:22:57] and until that time I had not seen a
[1:22:59] lion maybe I've I've seen them just in
[1:23:03] the
[1:23:08] book every day I went to pray I would
[1:23:10] think oh I'll see the lion
[1:23:12] today and I was getting ready to see the
[1:23:17] lion and I went for about 3 weeks I
[1:23:19] didn't see
[1:23:20] anything and a certain
[1:23:24] morning it was about 5:30 in the
[1:23:28] morning it was still
[1:23:31] dark I was going up the hill the
[1:23:35] mountain The Voice told

[1:23:45] anything I didn't know look what even
[1:23:47] what that
[1:23:49] meant I continued
[1:23:53] when I got to a certain
[1:23:58] place I I smell it was like a smell of
[1:24:02] blood I
[1:24:06] looked about uh six M where the
[1:24:16] benches I saw something laying under the
[1:24:19] mountain it was a lion
[1:24:23] I was standing here and the lion was
[1:24:25] right there I couldn't run
[1:24:28] back and I couldn't continue to
[1:24:31] walk because the lion in The
[1:24:35] Village every time the lion came to the
[1:24:42] Village the whole village will run
[1:24:46] away but I I stood
[1:24:49] there I was so terrified
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:56] but I had this belief this
[1:25:00] Faith because I knew I came to the
[1:25:02] mountain to
[1:25:03] pray I just
[1:25:06] said Lord Lord
[1:25:08] God protect

[1:25:22] him
[1:25:25] I saw the lion come
[1:25:27] out and he turned around and he went
[1:25:30] away I continue my
[1:25:33] way when I got to the m to the top of
[1:25:36] the mountain I started
[1:25:40] praying When you

[1:30:04] brandham I looked at Brother
[1:30:07] David I
[1:30:08] saw in
[1:30:10] him the image of brother
[1:30:13] Bram I I'm I forgive me if I sound like
[1:30:17] a
[1:30:18] fanatic I that's how I saw
[1:30:20] it if you have not seen it
[1:30:24] yet I don't
[1:30:26] know I saw in
[1:30:29] him the image of brother
[1:30:38] Bram I I'm just telling you few things
[1:30:41] that really touch me in
[1:30:43] life but there's a lot of things that
[1:30:45] God showed me brother when I saw Brother
[1:30:50] David when I when I saw the image of
[1:30:53] Brother David the image of brother Bram
[1:30:56] through Brother David I when I saw the
[1:30:59] image of brother brandham through
[1:31:00] Brother
[1:31:01] David I told my
[1:31:06] family we have to move to
[1:31:13] Texas
[1:31:15] Women's uh excuse the
[1:31:20] expression
[1:31:24] sometimes their faith could be based on
[1:31:26] material
[1:31:29] things we were so blessed
[1:31:39] here the one who was my wife at the time
[1:31:41] she didn't want to move because we we
[1:31:43] had so we were we were so
[1:31:46] blessed she
[1:31:50] refused
[1:31:53] she said no I won't move any PL I don't
[1:31:55] want to
[1:31:56] move she gave a lot of
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:05] reasons but the thing that attracted me
[1:32:08] the most is was the the the the vision
[1:32:11] to see the the image of brother bam me
[1:32:13] Brother
[1:32:16] David I I I I forgot about
[1:32:20] it I I forgot about the
[1:32:23] church I said
[1:32:26] now I have to go back to
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:33] Africa but because there was a lot of
[1:32:35] people that needed my
[1:32:37] help because there were there was a lot
[1:32:40] of offerings over
[1:32:42] there and I said I could help
[1:32:45] them that's how I went
[1:32:48] back when I would sleep I would finish
[1:32:53] in
[1:32:55] this I had a
[1:32:58] dream I had a
[1:33:02] dream about this church that's being
[1:33:04] built here I saw
[1:33:07] it I saw the
[1:33:12] dimensions I saw that it was a church
[1:33:14] with
[1:33:18] balcony I I told God what if I what if I
[1:33:21] to with that
[1:33:23] church why are you showing me
[1:33:28] this I'm not a member of that church why
[1:33:31] are you showing me this
[1:33:33] church uh
[1:33:36] miraculously I find myself
[1:33:39] here working in the
[1:33:43] church that I never imagine could
[1:33:46] imagine it would
[1:33:48] happen Brother David is my witness
[1:33:52] the first
[1:33:54] day when we when we got into the
[1:33:57] building I asked him a
[1:34:00] question why did you build a small
[1:34:03] church he looked at me he didn't answer
[1:34:09] it I I I realized that I offended
[1:34:14] him because it's a great work that he's
[1:34:20] doing I probably should have
[1:34:22] congratulated
[1:34:25] him but when I was looking at him in the
[1:34:28] eyes ashamed I was feeling
[1:34:32] ashamed but
[1:34:35] now there's about a month or
[1:34:39] two
[1:34:41] he he said
[1:34:45] here the phone call that he's getting a
[1:34:47] lot of phone calls from different side
[1:34:50] of the country
[1:34:54] that he built a small
[1:34:56] church so I felt my heart was
[1:35:00] peace I said God uh
[1:35:04] answered what I was asking
[1:35:09] him it was that part of the testimony I
[1:35:11] wanted to give
[1:35:13] you there's a lot of testimony that I
[1:35:16] want to give
[1:35:18] you but I wanted to just summarize it
