[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the precious name of the
[1:23:43] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:23:48] I just want to say some words of
[1:23:50] thankfulness to my powerful God.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; About three weeks ago,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; I decided to fix my car,
[1:24:04] change all the suspensions
[1:24:08] and I thought that it was all right,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; which it was so
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; but with use.
[1:24:20] I realized there was a a failure on the
[1:24:23] uh driver's side.
[1:24:26] I took it again to the mechanic
[1:24:29] for to to check it.
[1:24:33] There was a noise.
[1:24:39] Uh, my family knew about it and they
[1:24:41] knew that there was some noise.
[1:24:45] The mechanic uh said that it was a
[1:24:47] caliper
[1:24:49] and I changed it for a new one.
[1:24:53] I was satisfied again.
[1:24:57] A few days went by
[1:25:01] and I began to hear the sound to on the
[1:25:04] on the driver's side
[1:25:07] and I I got worried because
[1:25:11] everything was new
[1:25:18] and I felt in my heart something wasn't
[1:25:19] right.
[1:25:22] One day in the evening when I couldn't
[1:25:24] go to work
[1:25:30] I has a mechanic so I can take the car
[1:25:32] and he can check it again.
[1:25:36] and I went to the appointment time,
[1:25:40] but he wasn't there.
[1:25:45] It was dark now that it's uh gets dark
[1:25:48] earlier
[1:25:51] and I decided to wait for him.
[1:25:54] I got a little bit impatient,
[1:25:58] but something told me, "Don't leave it.
[1:25:59] Stay."
[1:26:01] I waited a little bit longer. He got
[1:26:04] there.
[1:26:10] I talked to him about the problem.
[1:26:12] Immediately he lifted up
[1:26:18] the my to my surprise when he looked
[1:26:21] under he took the bolts with his bare
[1:26:23] hands.
[1:26:29] There was no need for a tools because
[1:26:30] they were that means they were about to
[1:26:32] fall.
[1:26:42] If I would have kept driving, the the
[1:26:43] the tire would had would had fallen.
[1:26:48] I believe the Lord takes care of his
[1:26:50] children.
[1:26:53] It's for my Lord that saved my life
[1:27:00] because the same day I I I press on the
[1:27:02] brake and my car uh uh swerved. So I
[1:27:05] thought I had I was going to have an
[1:27:06] accident.
[1:27:11] It could appear like a small testimony,
[1:27:12] but in my heart there's gratitude
[1:27:14] towards my God
[1:27:16] because he takes care of his children.
[1:27:20] The glory be for my Lord.
[1:27:24] I want to finish uh saying these uh
[1:27:26] words.
[1:27:30] We had a wonderful time this weekend
[1:27:36] with a visit of precious brothers which
[1:27:38] I'm very uh thankful for
[1:27:44] how the word was open Friday to say uh
[1:27:47] give your heart
[1:27:54] I I said in my heart it was going to be
[1:27:56] perfect because it was the first time
[1:27:58] they were able to bring my our daughter.
[1:28:07] When we left the service, they had to
[1:28:08] work the next day. So, we didn't stay to
[1:28:10] eat
[1:28:14] and we left with the family.
[1:28:19] But before leaving my I take my jacket
[1:28:21] off and put it on hang it on the car.
[1:28:27] I never leave my Bible behind. I always
[1:28:29] take it with me.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And because I was in a hurry that night,
[1:28:34] I put it on on on top of the car
[1:28:40] with emotion. I felt that my family was
[1:28:42] with me.
[1:28:44] We got in the car and we left.
[1:28:51] the whole way we're talking about the
[1:28:53] service, how the glory of God was
[1:28:54] manifested and I was explaining to my
[1:28:57] children
[1:29:01] the need to receive Jesus Christ
[1:29:09] all the way home very emotional
[1:29:13] when we when we driveway
[1:29:18] My wife asked me, "Where is your Bible?"
[1:29:23] I felt that happiness turned into
[1:29:26] sadness and woriness.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Where is my Bible, Lord?
[1:29:34] After I was so happy and I I asked the
[1:29:37] Lord for a perfect weekend for us,
[1:29:43] I called one of the last brothers that I
[1:29:44] talked to
[1:29:47] I called him twice.
[1:29:51] I was eating with the brothers very
[1:29:52] happy.
[1:29:55] I I left my family and I to look for my
[1:29:58] Bible
[1:30:00] worried.
[1:30:03] My happiness a lot of sadness in me.
[1:30:08] I wasn't I never leave my Bible anymore
[1:30:12] and I felt guilty.
[1:30:14] I asked God for forgiveness.
[1:30:16] I I couldn't wait. I I I didn't expect
[1:30:18] this surprise.
[1:30:21] I came here.
[1:30:25] Perhaps some of the brothers saw me.
[1:30:29] I didn't see a happy face, but
[1:30:32] I greet a few. for the whole way. I was
[1:30:36] trying to look
[1:30:38] where could my Bible be at
[1:30:43] look at any object that was black.
[1:30:45] Where could it be? And it was dark.
[1:30:48] I came here and I looked for it.
[1:30:52] I had turn off the lights on the other
[1:30:53] side.

[1:31:04] And I was with my phone
[1:31:07] looking for my Bible.
[1:31:11] And I left immediately.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I said, "What happened, Lord?
[1:31:19] I was looking around. Where is my Bible?
[1:31:21] Where is my Bible?"
[1:31:24] I got home
[1:31:26] and I prayed.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't have a good night.
[1:31:32] slept because I was worried.
[1:31:35] I never leave my Bible. Where is my
[1:31:36] Bible?
[1:31:40] In the morning, we came. Saturday
[1:31:43] morning, we came.
[1:31:46] I expressed my wordiness to a brother
[1:31:48] and I asked him, "No one saw my Bible
[1:31:53] and I I always leave it at the very edge
[1:31:55] of the car."
[1:31:58] Well, I I left it at the very edge of
[1:32:00] the car. So, we ate and we left
[1:32:04] the service again.
[1:32:07] So, we had to go.
[1:32:12] We were looking for the Bible all the
[1:32:14] way home.
[1:32:18] We went we were about two miles away on
[1:32:21] the highway.
[1:32:28] that and we saw my Bible.
[1:32:33] It was over a bridge on the very edge
[1:32:40] and the and the pages were
[1:32:47] immediately we say my Bible is there.
[1:32:51] Why you stopwalk? because there's no
[1:32:54] sidewalk.
[1:32:58] I turned around.
[1:33:00] I I run.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The cars were very close by.
[1:33:07] And I took I got my Bible back.
[1:33:11] My honor before the Lord
[1:33:14] is not damaged.
[1:33:19] Over it.
[1:33:21] Many hours passed by.
[1:33:27] It was like I found the Lord Jesus
[1:33:28] Christ in me
[1:33:31] in the last.
[1:33:33] place where I found it.
[1:33:37] For me has a very spiritual application.
[1:33:40] I found it exactly
[1:33:43] in the middle of a bridge
[1:33:48] and they they build the bridges when
[1:33:49] there's two uh digs separation. And I
[1:33:53] thought
[1:33:56] about what
[1:33:59] men had when we fell from God's grace.
[1:34:03] Yesterday when I heard
[1:34:07] that God gave us a second wind
[1:34:10] to come back to the Lord.
[1:34:13] God is a bridge
[1:34:15] for cross to the other side
[1:34:18] where we were lost
[1:34:23] in the right place
[1:34:27] and honor. There is my Bible.
[1:34:31] Nothing is missing. It's not damaged.
[1:34:35] God bless you. [applause]
[1:35:29] God bless you all.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:35:34] I want to sing this song and it's about
[1:35:39] what the prophet saw when he was in that
[1:35:41] uh,
[1:35:44] the curtain of time.
[1:35:52] The prophet
[1:35:55] had a vision
[1:35:57] of beyond
[1:36:00] that curtain of time.
[1:36:05] And from that star he never was the
[1:36:10] same.
[1:36:13] He looked
[1:36:16] into
[1:36:17] eternity
[1:36:20] and he saw me
[1:36:24] in a perfect body
[1:36:27] and with all my heart, his word I
[1:36:32] believed
[1:36:35] that he saw me.
[1:36:39] He saw me.
[1:36:42] My eyes [singing] were glowing.
[1:36:46] My hair was blowing
[1:36:51] in that eternal breeze
[1:36:55] in the realm of the redeemed. In my
[1:37:00] [singing] perfect
[1:37:02] body, he saw me
[1:37:07] and they came running.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; in the beauty
[1:37:16] of eternal youth.
[1:37:20] And they [singing and music] were crying
[1:37:23] our precious brother
[1:37:29] in garments
[1:37:32] of snowy white
[1:37:36] and ice that sparkle like a star on a
[1:37:41] darkest night.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; They were [singing] trophies
[1:37:48] of his ministries.
[1:37:52] And I [singing] believe
[1:37:56] one of them was me.
[1:38:00] He saw me.
[1:38:05] He saw me. [singing]
[1:38:08] My eyes were glowing.
[1:38:12] My hair was blowing
[1:38:16] in that [singing]
[1:38:17] eternal breeze
[1:38:20] in the realm of the redeemed
[1:38:23] [singing and music]
[1:38:24] in my perfect
[1:38:27] body. He saw me.
[1:38:31] [music]
[1:38:32] So keep pressing on
[1:38:36] towards that perfect picture.
[1:38:40] If we [singing] only knew
[1:38:43] what await [music]
[1:38:44] us over yonder.
[1:38:48] Just a breath from here is a place of
[1:38:52] perfect [singing]
[1:38:53] love
[1:38:56] with so much beauty we could never
[1:38:59] [music]
[1:39:00] comprehend.
[1:39:04] And he [singing] said,
[1:39:06] "If we [music] would enter in,
[1:39:12] we must have
[1:39:14] perfect love within."
[1:39:19] He saw me. [singing]
[1:39:23] He saw me. [music]
[1:39:27] My eyes were [singing] glowing.
[1:39:30] My [music] hair was blowing
[1:39:34] in that [singing]
[1:39:36] eternal [music] breeze
[1:39:39] in the realm of the redeemed in my
[1:39:44] perfect [singing]
[1:39:46] body. He saw me.
[1:39:50] He saw us there.
[1:39:54] He saw us there
[1:39:58] in a body of eternal [music and singing]
[1:40:02] youth and beauty
[1:40:06] in a land beyond [singing and music]
[1:40:08] perfection.
[1:40:11] Far beyond sublime. [music] He saw us
[1:40:14] there beyond the [singing] curtain of
[1:40:18] time.
[1:40:21] In God's mind,
[1:40:24] I'm already there.
[1:40:29] So come what [singing and music] may, I
[1:40:31] will not care. He saw me there.
[1:40:41] [music] God be the glory. [applause]
[1:40:52] Hallelujah,
[1:40:54] brother Ricardo. I truly enjoyed your
[1:40:56] testimony. You know, as a believer, the
[1:40:59] Bible means something to us. Maybe to
[1:41:02] somebody else is, "Oh, I just lost a
[1:41:03] book. I can go get another one." But to
[1:41:05] us, it's more than a book. And you just
[1:41:08] think about it. If God cares about that,
[1:41:11] how much more for the greater things
[1:41:12] that you have? for he's not just [music]
[1:41:14] the God of the book, but he's the God
[1:41:16] that wants to live in you. Let's just
[1:41:19] sing this song and [music] right after
[1:41:21] we'll have Brother Sergio bring his song
[1:41:23] and Brother Jerome and Sister Hernandez
[1:41:25] bring hers right after.
[1:41:28] All I want to do [music]
[1:41:31] is love him.
[1:41:34] Oh, I'm [singing] so glad I feel his
[1:41:37] love for me.
[1:41:42] And Jesus [singing and music]
[1:41:43] paid the price of redemption.
[1:41:48] Oh, and on the cross of
[1:41:51] [singing and music] Calary.
[1:41:56] And [music and singing] so every day my
[1:41:58] heart will praise him. Oh, I know I'll
[1:42:05] never [singing and music] be the same.
[1:42:10] Oh, and all I [music] want to do is love
[1:42:15] [singing]
[1:42:16] him. Praise [music] his holy
[1:42:22] name. [music] Sing that with all you
[1:42:24] have. Oh, [singing] and all I want to do
[1:42:29] is [music] love him. Oh, so glad I feel
[1:42:34] his love for me.
[1:42:38] [music] Oh, and Jesus paid the price of
[1:42:43] redemption. [music]
[1:42:46] Oh, [singing] and on the cross of
[1:42:48] Calary.
[1:42:53] And so [music and singing] every day my
[1:42:55] heart will praise him.
[1:42:59] Oh, [music and singing] I know I'll
[1:43:02] never be the same.
[1:43:05] [music]
[1:43:06] Oh, and all I want you to do
[1:43:11] is love [music and singing]
[1:43:12] him and praise his holy
[1:43:18] [music] name. Sing it again, brother
[1:43:19] Sergio Cops. Oh, and all [singing] I
[1:43:22] want to do is love you.
[1:43:27] Oh, [music and singing] I'm so glad I
[1:43:29] feel his love for me.
[1:43:35] Oh, and Jesus paid the price [music]
[1:43:39] of redemption.
[1:43:42] Oh, and on the cross of Calary.
[1:43:46] [music]
[1:43:49] And so [singing]
[1:43:50] every day my heart [music]
[1:43:53] will praise you. Oh, and I know
[1:43:57] [singing] I'll never be [music] the
[1:44:00] same.
[1:44:03] Oh, and [singing] all I want to do is
[1:44:07] love [music] him, praise his holy
[1:44:14] name. [music and singing]
[1:44:25] God bless you.

[1:45:04] There's a God
[1:45:07] who's been faithful [singing]
[1:45:09] to me.
[1:45:14] When my strength
[1:45:17] was all gone, [singing]
[1:45:19] when my heart
[1:45:22] had no song, [singing]
[1:45:24] still in love,
[1:45:26] he proved faithful [music]
[1:45:28] to me.
[1:45:33] Every word
[1:45:35] he promised
[1:45:38] is true.
[1:45:42] What [music] I thought [singing]
[1:45:44] was impossible,
[1:45:46] I've seen my God [singing] do.
[1:45:55] He's been faithful, [singing]
[1:46:02] faithful
[1:46:04] to me. [music]

[1:46:21] [music] Though my heart
[1:46:24] I have questioned,

[1:46:31] Yet he's been [music and singing]
[1:46:32] faithful.

[1:46:50] I could not [singing] pray.
[1:46:53] Still my [music] God,
[1:46:56] he was faithful [singing]
[1:46:59] to me.
[1:47:04] The days I spent so selfishly
[1:47:09] reaching [music and singing] out
[1:47:12] for what pleased me.
[1:47:15] Even then,

[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; So many hidden talents.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Sergio.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[2:11:37] Wow. I just want you to know that's
[2:11:40] that's dangerous what you just did
[2:11:41] there. You'll be called on a lot now.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:48] We'll have a clever come up and sing
[2:11:50] this song. Brother Tom Ray mentioned
[2:11:52] this. I want to sing it as a
[2:11:53] congregational, but he knows the song
[2:11:55] better than I. Justified.
[2:11:59] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; You're justified.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; That quote he read says, "Oh, if I could
[2:12:04] get the world to see that, why? There
[2:12:07] you are. There is the body of Christ
[2:12:10] living, standing, redeemed. Redeemed. Oh
[2:12:14] my. Justified in his sight. Why are we
[2:12:18] justified? [music] We are his victory.
[2:12:21] The church is his victory. We come forth
[2:12:24] in the last days with the glorious
[2:12:26] gospel showing his victory. He died for
[2:12:30] this purpose and we are proof of his
[2:12:33] victory. Amen. When [music] we see him
[2:12:35] coming down and living among the church,
[2:12:38] that's his victory. Shows that he
[2:12:40] couldn't keep him in the [music] grave.
[2:12:43] Neither can they keep us. That's right.
[2:12:47] We're bound. Hallelujah.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; I was sitting alone and wondering
[2:12:58] about what I'm supposed to do. I can't
[2:13:02] deny the times I made mistakes. I can't
[2:13:07] hide from him. He knew.
[2:13:11] But I know [music and singing] that deep
[2:13:13] within my soul I feel sorry as I [music]
[2:13:18] do. So I just cry and [singing] say
[2:13:22] forgive me Lord. Forgive me again.
[2:13:26] [music and singing]
[2:13:26] Will you justify?
[2:13:31] [singing]
[2:13:32] Justify. [music]
[2:13:36] You had not done it in the [music] first
[2:13:40] place. [singing]
[2:13:41] You're justified.
[2:13:45] Justified.
[2:13:47] [music]
[2:13:50] Justified. [singing]
[2:13:53] You had not done it [music]
[2:13:56] in the [singing] first place to justify.
[2:14:03] [music] so often undiscouraged
[2:14:07] when I count the times I fall. For
[2:14:11] [music and singing] he promised that
[2:14:13] I'll be victorious when I know I'm not
[2:14:18] at [music and singing] all.
[2:14:20] But I heard the eagle screaming. [music]
[2:14:24] His voice quickened my soul. He said,
[2:14:28] [singing] "You're not done it in the
[2:14:31] [music] first place. You're justified.
[2:14:35] Oh, justified. [music and singing]
[2:14:41] Justified.
[2:14:45] You have [music] not done it in the
[2:14:48] first place. You're justified.
[2:14:53] Justified. [music]
[2:14:57] Oh, justified. [singing]
[2:15:01] For [music] you had not done it in the
[2:15:05] [singing] first place. You're justified.
[2:15:10] For he [singing] looked at your perfect
[2:15:13] picture
[2:15:15] without blame, spot, or wrinkle.
[2:15:19] He didn't [music and singing] look at
[2:15:21] you where you are now. He looked right
[2:15:24] from
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; eternity. [singing]
[2:15:27] He said, "You're just trapped in the
[2:15:30] body. You bypassed your theophony.
[2:15:34] [music and singing]
[2:15:35] You had not done it in the first place.
[2:15:39] You're justified.
[2:15:43] Oh, I am justified. [music]
[2:15:48] I'm justified. [singing]
[2:15:50] I have not done it. I had [music] not
[2:15:53] done it [singing]
[2:15:54] in the first place. I'm justified.
[2:16:00] I am justified. [music and singing]
[2:16:05] I'm justified. [music]
[2:16:08] [singing]
[2:16:09] I had not done it in [music] the first
[2:16:13] place. I'm justified.
[2:16:16] The last verse.
[2:16:18] Oh, [singing and music] he looked at
[2:16:19] your perfect picture
[2:16:22] without flame, spot or [music] wrinkle.
[2:16:26] He didn't look at you [singing]
[2:16:29] where you are now. He look right from
[2:16:32] eternity. [music]
[2:16:34] He said, "You're just trapped in that
[2:16:37] body. [singing]
[2:16:39] You by past your offy. [music]
[2:16:42] You had not [singing] done it in the

[2:17:11] Justified.
[2:17:13] [singing]

[2:17:17] in the first place to justify. [singing]

[2:17:27] first place. [music] I'm justified.
[2:17:33] Hallelujah. [applause]

[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; We're not living for here. Won't last.
[2:21:52] Like our brother preached. This breath
[2:21:55] won't last. [music]
[2:21:56] It's that eternal breath that lasts. I
[2:22:00] tell you, every time I hear the brothers
[2:22:03] and sisters saying, my soul just bubbles
[2:22:06] over.
[2:22:08] Brother Jerome, the angels in heaven
[2:22:11] were [music] swaying to the the the
[2:22:15] sound of that song. Brother, it touched
[2:22:18] something down inside of me. How did I
[2:22:21] ever make it over? I don't know. But he
[2:22:25] promised it and he keeps his promise.
[2:22:27] That's all I know. And it's just so
[2:22:30] wonderful. Uh all the singing and little
[2:22:35] David singing and brother Neville, you
[2:22:39] know, we've got
[2:22:41] uh we we've we've got one day brother uh
[2:22:46] Neville and brother Brandham will sing a
[2:22:47] song
[2:22:49] for us because we got brother Neville in
[2:22:51] our church. We got brother Brandham in
[2:22:53] our church. We've got John the Baptist
[2:22:57] in our church. We got John the Divine in
[2:23:01] our church. You You know what I mean? I
[2:23:04] I I think that the heavens and earth
[2:23:06] have come together just like he
[2:23:08] promised. A Amen. Amen. I just God so
[2:23:14] good. And if you didn't get a chance to
[2:23:16] sing tonight, would you please bring
[2:23:19] your specials on services on Sunday? And
[2:23:23] uh I thought in my heart, I enjoyed this
[2:23:26] so much. We're going to have to have a
[2:23:28] Saturday afternoon barbecue and then
[2:23:31] come in church and just sing. This this
[2:23:33] is glorious, church. This is the Holy
[2:23:36] Spirit.
[2:23:38] This is what it's like to feel the love
[2:23:41] of God just just came. Amen.
[2:23:49] It it's it's just wonderful. I got to
[2:23:52] thinking [music] I was looking at
[2:23:53] brother Sing and I thought you know you
[2:23:55] got to sing a song for us in Indian some
[2:23:57] or Hindu or or whatever it is like they
[2:24:00] ask brother Ben do you speak African?
[2:24:04] you know, I don't know, there's 20,000
[2:24:06] different dialects, but I I just love it
[2:24:09] when you hear somebody sing in a foreign
[2:24:12] language
[2:24:13] and then you know that for them to sing
[2:24:16] that, they had to touch the same God you
[2:24:19] did.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; And that means that there's hungry
[2:24:23] hearts all over the world
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; that Jesus wants to touch and [music]
[2:24:31] share,
[2:24:33] you know. Uh Matthew went to India and
[2:24:37] [music] and and sat down with over 40 or
[2:24:41] 50 Pentecostal
[2:24:46] ministers
[2:24:47] and he shared the gospel with them. He
[2:24:50] shared the godhead with them and he
[2:24:52] baptized 40 [music] Pentecostal
[2:24:55] ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:24:58] Christ.
[2:25:00] Just think of that. There's hungry
[2:25:02] hearts, church.
[2:25:05] And if you could take this joy and this
[2:25:09] gift of God
[2:25:11] because he said it's been freely given
[2:25:14] to you. Freely given.
[2:25:17] You know, I I know when you meet
[2:25:19] somebody, it looks like that, you know,
[2:25:21] that got big spirits on them. Yeah, they
[2:25:24] got spirits on them. They they got
[2:25:26] devils on them. Yes, they have devils on
[2:25:29] them. They're in terrible shape.
[2:25:32] But I know of somebody else that was in
[2:25:34] terrible shape. [snorts]
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; And just some guy out of spite
[2:25:42] looked at me and said, "Why don't you
[2:25:44] read your Bible?
[2:25:47] I was down. I was suicidal. I drugs were
[2:25:52] starting to take their [music] effect on
[2:25:53] me." And and I I just and he said, "Why
[2:25:57] don't you just read your Bible?"
[2:26:01] You know, that stuck with me somehow.
[2:26:04] And I went and ran read Romans chapter
[2:26:07] 1.
[2:26:11] And the God of glory
[2:26:14] come down and met me on a rooftop.
[2:26:19] It's freely given.
[2:26:21] Let's freely [music] give.
[2:26:24] the the country is starving to be in
[2:26:28] this kind of atmosphere. [music]
[2:26:31] They're starving to have somebody tell
[2:26:33] them you never did it in the first
[2:26:35] place.
[2:26:37] You were just trapped in this body
[2:26:42] by a lie.
[2:26:45] And now you can come out of that lie
[2:26:48] with the truth. And the truth is what
[2:26:51] sets you free.
[2:26:54] I like the way Paul put it. I'm not
[2:26:56] ashamed of the gospel
[2:26:59] because the glory of God unto salvation.
[2:27:04] And [music] the our Lord put it to us
[2:27:06] this way. He said, "If you're ashamed of
[2:27:08] me in this life, I'll be ashamed of you
[2:27:12] in the other." So let's let's share with
[2:27:15] what we've got tonight, church. This has
[2:27:18] been a wonderful weekend.
[2:27:21] It's been um
[2:27:24] it's just been such a sweet time in the
[2:27:29] presence of the Lord and [music]
[2:27:32] and would just close in prayer but let's
[2:27:35] don't lose this atmosphere.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; You know if song brought it, song can
[2:27:42] restore it.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; If the word brought it, the word can
[2:27:46] restore it.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; So if your tank starts getting empty,
[2:27:50] grab a song,
[2:27:52] grab a [music] tune, and put a melody on
[2:27:56] your heart and lift yourself back up
[2:27:59] into the presence of the [music] Lord.
[2:28:01] Grab your Bible and read it and lift
[2:28:04] yourself back up in the presence of the
[2:28:06] Lord. Amen. Manassa, it's nice to have
[2:28:09] you with us. And I is Zire there? I
[2:28:12] don't I guess. All right. She's hidden
[2:28:15] back there. [music] Nice to have her
[2:28:18] with us. Also,
[2:28:20] uh, Brother Manass, he serves our
[2:28:23] country. He's, uh, [music] in the United
[2:28:26] States Marine Corps.
[2:28:28] You know, he he's far part of the few
[2:28:31] and the proud, the Marines. We
[2:28:34] appreciate that, brother. Thank you for
[2:28:36] your service.
[2:28:38] Our prophet wanted to be a soldier.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you so much. May the Lord
[2:28:44] keep you safe.
[2:28:46] Amen. Let's all be soldiers.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; He's protecting us. Let's be soldiers
[2:28:52] for the cross and pray for him. As we
[2:28:55] bow our heads, let's bow our heads in
[2:28:57] prayer. Our gracious father,
[2:29:01] Lord, you know how my heart
[2:29:05] is swelled with love.
[2:29:08] Father, hearing these children sing just
[2:29:13] not even 10 years old and they're
[2:29:15] singing the glory of God and and these
[2:29:20] little groups that were put together,
[2:29:22] Father, people just got together because
[2:29:24] they loved you and they wanted to
[2:29:26] worship you
[2:29:28] and they [music] practiced in fellowship
[2:29:31] together and they sang praise to your
[2:29:33] name.
[2:29:34] And Father, I know there's not one thing
[2:29:37] that any man ever does for you that goes
[2:29:40] unrewarded.
[2:29:42] Father, I ask you to pour out the
[2:29:44] blessings of reward in their life.
[2:29:48] May they feel you close by
[2:29:51] and may they just be
[2:29:54] so full of joy
[2:29:57] and peace
[2:29:59] and longsuffering. Father, I just ask
[2:30:03] that you would grant that to all our
[2:30:07] musicians who labor. Father,
[2:30:11] the deacons and the trustees and
[2:30:15] all the hidden parts that go on that
[2:30:17] nobody
[2:30:19] notices.
[2:30:21] Father, our Sunday school teachers,
[2:30:23] Brother Tim, and
[2:30:25] all that they do. Father, we just
[2:30:31] pray with all our hearts. Father, we've
[2:30:34] asked for a path forward, and I believe
[2:30:36] you've showed us a path forward. Now,
[2:30:39] Father, lead us in that path
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; with the right spirit, the right motive,
[2:30:44] and the right objective.
[2:30:47] And Father, may we take this light
[2:30:50] and set it on a hill.
[2:30:53] May our good works, Father, glorify you.
[2:30:57] And father, may we tell others about all
[2:31:00] that you've done.
[2:31:05] We commit it all into your hands.
[2:31:07] Father, bless our visitors. Father,
[2:31:11] our ministers that came and preached for
[2:31:14] us. Father,
[2:31:15] may they go home with a promise in their
[2:31:19] heart that
[2:31:21] whatever that they ask that you'll grant
[2:31:24] it.
[2:31:26] We ask those [music] things for their
[2:31:28] effort. Be with us now, Father. Guide us
[2:31:33] in the future. And we just trust that
[2:31:37] you'll look upon us kindly and full of
[2:31:40] mercy. And as Peter said, Lord, you know
[2:31:44] all things. [music]
[2:31:46] You know that we love you.
[2:31:49] We thank you. Amen. Is that nothing but
[2:31:51] his presence? [music]

[2:31:55] in the fellowship off the Oh, okay.

[2:32:01] been waiting for.
[2:32:03] There's some leftover desserts and rolls
[2:32:07] in the fellowship hall if you want to
[2:32:11] grab some after [music] church.
[2:32:15] Amen.
[2:32:17] So, there's a dessert grab after church
[2:32:21] for all of you that want to grab
[2:32:23] dessert. You there there Miles is taking

[2:32:37] me a bite, Miles.
[2:32:39] All righty. God bless you. You love the
