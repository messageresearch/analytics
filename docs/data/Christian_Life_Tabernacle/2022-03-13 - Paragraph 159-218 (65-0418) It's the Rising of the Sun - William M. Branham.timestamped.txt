[28:11] amen we're so grateful for that we ask
[28:14] it in jesus wonderful name we pray
[28:17] amen
[28:18] amen if you have your bibles let's turn
[28:20] over to saint john
[28:22] the fifth chapter
[28:30] um
[28:33] read a little scripture here that
[28:36] brother branham's gonna
[28:39] comment on
[28:40] and
[28:52] okay
[28:54] let's just read starting with the twenty
[28:57] first verse
[28:59] and
[28:59] it says for as the father raiseth up
[29:03] the dead and quickeneth them
[29:05] even so the son quicketh whom he will
[29:11] for the father judgeth no man
[29:14] but hath committed all judgment unto the
[29:17] son
[29:19] that all men should honor the son even
[29:23] as they honor the father he that
[29:26] honoreth not the son honoreth
[29:30] not the father which hath sent him
[29:34] barely verily i say unto you
[29:36] he that heareth my word
[29:39] and believeth on him
[29:41] that sent me
[29:43] hath everlasting life
[29:45] and shall not
[29:48] not come into condemnation
[29:50] but is passed
[29:53] from death
[29:54] unto
[29:55] life
[29:56] amen heavenly father we ask you to place
[29:59] your word in your precious name we pray
[30:02] amen amen you may be seated
[30:06] amen
[30:08] we're just going to pick up here i i
[30:10] know that we had an awful long service
[30:13] this morning and i'm sorry about it and
[30:16] i know that a lot of people are home
[30:17] napping now
[30:19] because uh they got so wore out this
[30:22] morning
[30:23] but just remember some are going to be
[30:25] awake and some are going to be in bed
[30:28] right that's what the scripture says so
[30:31] i'm glad i'm awake and uh
[30:34] and things and uh we're trusting this so
[30:36] we're going to play just a few more a
[30:39] little more portion of the
[30:41] message this evening
[30:42] and
[30:44] uh
[30:45] i just had a
[30:46] thought that i was as i was thinking on
[30:49] this
[30:51] and
[30:52] it comes from this morning to the
[30:54] recognition that were eagles
[30:57] and
[30:58] i i wanted just to say if i i don't know
[31:00] how to call it but uh
[31:03] you hear the expression don't sell
[31:05] yourself short
[31:08] and
[31:08] you know a short sale
[31:11] is when you some sell something for less
[31:14] than its value
[31:16] or less than what's owed on it
[31:20] and
[31:21] sometimes a lender
[31:23] will take less than the person owes
[31:27] because they they feel that's the only
[31:29] way they're going to get anything
[31:33] at all you know what i mean so they make
[31:35] a decision
[31:37] that it's the best but they don't get
[31:39] full value
[31:41] and
[31:43] and our debt's been paid so there's no
[31:46] need for us to sell
[31:49] ourselves short
[31:52] because he's already appraised us
[31:56] and
[31:57] how he's appraised us he didn't appraise
[32:00] us as property that needs work
[32:03] you know what i mean he didn't he didn't
[32:06] appraise us as a fixer-upper
[32:09] you know what i'm saying now you might
[32:11] look at yourself as a fixer-upper
[32:14] but he don't look at you as a
[32:15] fixer-upper
[32:17] besides he has all the resources to fix
[32:20] you up anyway
[32:22] praise the lord right so we're just so
[32:25] grateful for that that he that we don't
[32:27] have to worry about that so because we
[32:29] listen to this and he talks about an
[32:32] eagle i'd like to just point this one
[32:35] statement out
[32:37] that he makes here as we're going to
[32:40] read this he says
[32:42] he's talking about the church he said he
[32:44] said blessed art thou
[32:46] this is paragraph 167
[32:49] he said blessed art thou see
[32:52] son of jonas flesh and blood
[32:56] never revealed this to you
[32:58] but my father which is in heaven has
[33:02] revealed it
[33:03] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[33:06] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[33:10] it
[33:11] now
[33:13] that's pretty good
[33:15] you know what i mean i mean i like that
[33:17] promise
[33:19] i mean it's time for me to skip to place
[33:21] myself in every part of the word of god
[33:25] i've been baptized in the name of the
[33:27] lord jesus christ i've received the word
[33:29] of god it's been revealed to me then the
[33:32] gates of hell cannot prevail against my
[33:35] revelation amen amen he says and i
[33:40] and i give unto thee the keys
[33:43] whatsoever you bind on earth it'll be
[33:45] bind in heaven and what you lose
[33:48] on earth
[33:49] that's
[33:50] that's that divine revelation of the
[33:53] word made flesh
[33:56] if it was flesh in the day by the sun
[34:01] the groom
[34:03] its flesh today
[34:05] by the bride
[34:06] see
[34:07] whosoever sends you remit
[34:10] them are remitted and whosoever sin
[34:14] you retain
[34:16] to them
[34:17] are
[34:18] retained now he goes on to talk about
[34:21] the catholic church picked up on that
[34:24] but they didn't have it
[34:26] you know they thought you'd do some sort
[34:27] of pence
[34:28] and your sins
[34:30] are forgiven but just think of the
[34:33] believer that means they rise right up
[34:36] above it all
[34:38] right you know what i mean there's
[34:39] nothing going to hold you down
[34:42] amen and you can just certainly
[34:45] really rest on that so this to not be
[34:47] very long tonight so
[34:49] that you can get home and take your nap
[34:52] after your sacrifice today
[34:54] and
[34:55] so we're just going to listen to this 15
[34:57] minutes and just
[34:59] not spend very much time afterwards and
[35:02] maybe we can be
[35:04] we'll be out of here here in just maybe
[35:06] 6 30 or less if the lord blesses us and
[35:10] and then we'll go forward uh in this
[35:13] message brother branham sat down and
[35:16] preached this for two hours and 20
[35:18] minutes
[35:20] straight
[35:22] and so with all the preliminaries and
[35:24] everything about a three hour service so
[35:27] we're certainly not trying to imitate
[35:29] him in any way because
[35:32] i just can't believe how much he puts in
[35:35] one sermon
[35:36] you know what i mean it's just like
[35:38] water just living water just flowing out
[35:41] of them and the statements he's making
[35:43] and and do you understand what he said
[35:46] this morning right
[35:47] the right
[35:48] when he quickens you that's your
[35:50] resurrection
[35:52] that's right hey amen that that's what
[35:55] he said that he had we just read it he
[35:57] says has life
[35:59] and never shall taste death he who
[36:01] heareth my words
[36:03] and understand them
[36:05] they have life
[36:07] and life more abundant so let's just
[36:09] listen here for a few moments this
[36:10] evening and then we'll move right along
[36:13] god bless you
[36:17] let me straighten the scripture here for
[36:18] you i think we're off of the phone but
[36:20] we are still here
[36:24] uh saint john 5 24. jesus said he
[36:28] that teareth my word
[36:31] and believe us on him and send me has
[36:32] everlasting life
[36:34] now look i go down the street just take
[36:36] that literally what it is without the
[36:38] spiritual understanding don't make it
[36:39] say nothing else but it's saying what it
[36:41] says
[36:42] see
[36:42] the right word there in the greek in the
[36:46] original it says he that understandeth
[36:49] my word
[36:50] now to prove that's right i go down
[36:52] yours there's a drunk coming along the
[36:53] street with some other man's wife on his
[36:56] arms and cussing and taking god's name
[36:58] in vain and everything else like that
[37:00] say
[37:01] did you hear that preacher said did you
[37:03] yeah i heard it
[37:05] that don't mean he's got eternal life
[37:09] he that understandeth my word
[37:12] he that is an eagle
[37:15] now brother brown want more scripture
[37:17] than that all right
[37:20] my sheep hear my voice
[37:24] a stranger they won't follow
[37:26] amen
[37:27] as in the marriage and divorce case the
[37:29] other day when the holy spirit had told
[37:31] me that i come said it just the way he
[37:33] told me
[37:34] some minister lady gave me a right
[37:36] triangle balling out she said
[37:38] i guess you take the place of god
[37:40] i said no man never you told her sin is
[37:43] forgiven the word said only god has
[37:45] power said another pharisee
[37:52] that you might know
[37:55] that jesus told peter
[37:58] and the apostles
[37:59] after he had the revelation of who he
[38:01] was
[38:03] totally denied christ the son of god
[38:05] he said blessed art thou the
[38:08] son of jonah flesh and blood never
[38:10] revealed this to you my father which is
[38:12] in heaven has revealed it upon this rock
[38:14] i'll build my church the gates of hell
[38:16] can't prevail against it and i give unto
[38:19] thee the keys
[38:22] whatever you find on earth i'll find it
[38:26] what you loose on earth that's that
[38:28] divine revelation of the word made
[38:31] if it was flesh in that day but the sun
[38:34] the groom is the flesh today by the
[38:36] bride
[38:39] whosoever sends your remit
[38:42] to them they are remitted
[38:44] whosoever sins your routine to them they
[38:46] are retained now the catholic church
[38:48] picks that up and takes it to their
[38:50] priest but that's carnal
[38:52] watch
[38:53] it was a spiritual reveal word that did
[38:57] it
[39:00] that's reason he told go baptize the
[39:01] name of father son holy ghost
[39:03] he knows they know who he was
[39:06] talking to a little preacher the day he
[39:07] said to me he said brother branham i've
[39:09] come out and joined one over to a
[39:11] certain
[39:12] a
[39:13] certain church a pentecostal church or
[39:15] the pentecostal how to start taking the
[39:17] round wafer you know you've heard of
[39:19] that i guess the kosher the moon god you
[39:21] know and they all accepted it and satan
[39:23] this man said this
[39:25] congregation went through and he said
[39:27] what i have blessed is blessed now you
[39:28] know what the priest says he has power
[39:29] to turn it back to the body of christ
[39:31] see just six to one half dozen the other
[39:33] that's the same and um
[39:35] he said i want to ask you something he
[39:37] is trying to dodge that issue of the
[39:39] baptism in jesus name because this was
[39:41] the man that said it was it was the
[39:42] antichrist that did this he said do you
[39:44] think it's all necessary that a man
[39:47] should be baptized in the name of jesus
[39:49] christ i said yesterday
[39:51] he said after he's been baptized in the
[39:52] name of the father son holy ghost i said
[39:54] yesterday he has been baptized at all
[39:57] he hasn't baptized at all no name that's
[40:00] the title
[40:01] i said he doesn't recognize i said why
[40:04] did uh
[40:05] why did
[40:06] peter he said well let me tell you
[40:08] something he said on acts 10 49
[40:11] he said why peter he had to speak these
[40:12] words the holy ghost fell upon them but
[40:14] i said he turned right around and said
[40:15] can a man forbid water
[40:17] these should not be baptized
[40:20] he said well you're speaking over there
[40:21] a while ago about acts 19 where paul
[40:23] passed it up close to that he find them
[40:25] disciples and said well said they wasn't
[40:27] baptized in the name of the father son
[40:28] holy ghost i said no they were baptized
[40:30] unto repentance
[40:31] not for remission of sins
[40:33] unto repentance because jesus had been
[40:35] made on you the sacrifice hadn't been
[40:38] killed he said well why do they have to
[40:39] be baptized or i said the man that had
[40:41] the key said this
[40:43] forbid knowing unto you that there's not
[40:45] another name under heaven given among
[40:47] man whereby you must be saved
[40:50] salvation alone goes in the name of
[40:52] jesus christ
[40:54] whatever you do in word or indeed you at
[40:56] all in the name of jesus christ there's
[40:58] not another name no church no hierarchy
[41:00] no titles or nothing else yet he is the
[41:03] rose of sharon lilly valley morning star
[41:05] alpha omega beginning in the unit
[41:06] jehovah character manasseh all these
[41:09] he's all these things but yet he there's
[41:11] not no salvation in any of those titles
[41:15] jehovah no salvation
[41:18] rose of sharon that he is no salvation
[41:20] father son or holy ghost no salvation
[41:22] only the name of jesus christ
[41:25] and then the bible says that repentance
[41:28] and remission of sin
[41:31] must be taught in his name
[41:34] beginning at jerusalem
[41:36] and to the uttermost parts of the earth
[41:39] he said do you think it makes any
[41:40] difference
[41:42] i said
[41:43] sir i want to ask you something he and i
[41:45] and my wife are sitting at the table he
[41:47] just moved over stimulus
[41:49] i said we are both arizonans
[41:52] we live here
[41:54] and i and we know our council and our
[41:56] award and all our mayor governor
[41:59] everything
[42:01] i said now if i told you brother to go
[42:04] over here and sign up for our dinner in
[42:06] the name of the governor of the state of
[42:09] arizona would you go sign it like that
[42:12] you think they'd receive it at the desk
[42:19] he said why did jesus say that after
[42:20] this is it
[42:22] see
[42:23] wow if i told you to go
[42:25] sign for this dinner
[42:27] in the name of the governor of the state
[42:30] of arizona and us being
[42:32] citizens of arizona
[42:34] and knowing who the governor is
[42:36] well you know to sign it in the name of
[42:38] sam goddard see i said because he is the
[42:41] governor of the state i don't have to
[42:42] question you
[42:43] you know who the governor is and he said
[42:46] father son and holy ghost he knows how
[42:47] to go to baptize they know who he was
[42:52] my sheep hear my voice
[42:56] he said oh i see
[42:59] but now the next thing will you believe
[43:02] he that heareth my word and believeth
[43:06] on him that sent me has everlasting
[43:08] and when this new eternal life dwells in
[43:11] you it is the potential
[43:14] when you have received this holy spirit
[43:16] now that they did at pentecost
[43:18] they were the mechanics now the dynamics
[43:21] had to come they had believed
[43:23] you know our good baptist friends tells
[43:25] us when we believe we've got it but they
[43:27] didn't have it yet they did believe it
[43:29] acts 19 did believe but they didn't have
[43:31] you received the holy ghost since you
[43:32] believed
[43:33] see they had the mechanics all right
[43:35] because the apostles were i mean apollos
[43:38] was teaching to them and proven by the
[43:40] bible the mechanics that jesus was the
[43:42] christ
[43:43] but they didn't have the dynamics yet
[43:46] that's it all right what
[43:50] panics you potentially have
[43:53] the earnest
[43:54] the waiting
[43:56] now when you get the dynamics you have
[43:58] been quickened from mortal to
[44:00] immortality it makes the whole body come
[44:03] subject to the word
[44:05] it makes you act different look
[44:07] different live different it'll just make
[44:09] you different now look
[44:12] then quicken
[44:14] you who were once dead in sin and
[44:16] trespasses of darkness has he quickened
[44:19] but by his spirit
[44:20] that raised up jesus on easter morning
[44:22] from the dead and if it dwells in your
[44:24] mortal body now watch it our soul
[44:27] quickens
[44:29] brings to life
[44:31] makes it subject to the word
[44:33] now how can you claim to have that
[44:35] spirit and throw yourself away from the
[44:37] word
[44:39] you're quickened by something else
[44:41] or it will quicken your mortal body to
[44:44] the word
[44:45] so it will you can't run without it you
[44:47] just flutter you don't believe all of it
[44:49] if you have pork gasoline part water you
[44:51] ain't gonna go nowhere okay you've got
[44:53] to take it 100
[44:56] gasoline
[44:58] if you don't you're back far you ain't
[44:59] got no power
[45:01] well i believe this
[45:11] let it light up on that every word is
[45:13] true
[45:15] then notice how as we close notice this
[45:18] notice
[45:19] it's just like a little a little
[45:21] seedling in the ground
[45:23] now potentially you are resurrected
[45:27] you're resurrected when you receive the
[45:29] holy spirit in you you're resurrected
[45:32] right then your body's potentially
[45:34] resurrected
[45:36] look at a little steep plant in the
[45:37] ground
[45:38] it has to drink from its fountain the
[45:41] waters it pours down and as it drinks it
[45:43] pushes up towards him coming more like
[45:46] the likeness of the seed that went into
[45:48] the ground see the church come that way
[45:51] through justifications sanitation
[45:52] baptist holy lord now in the blossom
[45:55] see
[45:56] the spirit of god come through that and
[45:58] the spirit of the world has come to the
[45:59] antichrist the same way and now blossom
[46:01] out in a great union of churches see the
[46:03] whole thing and the individual comes
[46:05] that way
[46:06] everything works on the same on the same
[46:08] scale of god because he
[46:11] is the same yesterday and forever
[46:14] notice
[46:15] on your way growing to the fullness of
[46:17] the resurrection led by the spirit as
[46:20] the sun
[46:21] f-u-n pulls that little plant that's
[46:24] drinking from god's fountain just keeps
[46:26] see he can only drink from one thing you
[46:29] pour oil down that little seed one time
[46:31] kill it
[46:33] that's right you pour stagnated water
[46:35] old water ain't no good contaminated
[46:37] it'll stump the growth it won't bear
[46:40] fruit is that right
[46:43] but you pour real good soft rainforest
[46:47] hey man no man-made chemicals in it
[46:50] just let it come from the heavens above
[46:52] and watch that little plane there's no
[46:54] water or grow that like that for any
[46:55] water
[46:57] you put chlorine stuff in like you try
[46:58] to dose us up with and the first thing
[47:01] you know it kills a plant that's what's
[47:02] the matter today you try to give them
[47:04] water
[47:05] from the denominational fountain
[47:08] and it stunts the growth but lame have
[47:10] the calm world of dew drops of mercy
[47:14] shine all around me by day and by night
[47:17] jesus the light of the world and you've
[47:19] got it
[47:20] we'll walk in the light that beautiful
[47:23] comes where the two drops of mercy are
[47:26] bright
[47:26] just shine all around me take these
[47:28] man-made fountains away from me
[47:31] i know nothing but the blood of jesus
[47:34] that's all the fountains i want to know
[47:36] that's the word dwelling me lord water
[47:38] it was our spirit know it
[47:41] now if that spirit that raised up jesus
[47:43] from the grave dwells in you you
[47:45] potentially have life led by the spirit
[47:48] to quicken the word to you to believe it
[47:51] little thing keeps pushing up as it
[47:53] grows notice
[47:54] at pentecost their bodies were quickened
[47:57] to a new life
[47:59] look at a bunch of little cowards i'm
[48:01] always you know
[48:03] looking
[48:04] i'm just warmed up feeling good
[48:08] oh my notice
[48:10] they were towers
[48:12] notice but they had the mechanics
[48:16] but they were all sitting back in there
[48:18] oh and i'm great
[48:21] oh all them great big bishops and things
[48:23] i'm afraid to then preach the things i'm
[48:25] afraid to make that clean pray doc's out
[48:27] but he's going oh i just can't do that
[48:29] you see but all of a sudden the dynamics
[48:31] come
[48:34] yes
[48:35] and what did it do
[48:37] didn't always fill their spirit inside
[48:40] but it quickened their mechanics
[48:44] their bodies were quicker
[48:46] they were no more cowards
[48:48] they went right out in the face of the
[48:50] people
[48:52] yes sir
[48:53] few men of judaism you to dwell in
[48:55] jerusalem
[48:56] or before the dynamics come they were
[48:58] just mechanics
[49:00] amen that dwell in jerusalem let this be
[49:02] known on you and heartly my words these
[49:04] are not drunk as you suppose
[49:06] i'm one of them
[49:09] this is that i'll show you what it is
[49:11] it's a scripture
[49:12] this is that
[49:13] and i always say just think that let me
[49:15] keep this to that counter no this is
[49:17] that that was spoken over the prophet
[49:19] joel it would come to pass last night
[49:20] says god i'll pour out my spirit upon
[49:22] all places see the dynamics come into
[49:25] the mechanics
[49:26] there was afraid no more
[49:28] some of you people that are afraid that
[49:30] some woman will laugh at you for having
[49:32] a long name
[49:35] some of you man that's afraid your
[49:37] organization will throw you out when you
[49:38] baptize your congregation in scriptural
[49:40] baptism
[49:42] you need to close yourself in the upper
[49:43] room till the dynamics come
[49:46] that's right it changed them it
[49:48] quickened them
[49:50] it made them different
[49:52] they were changed people from their own
[49:55] they quickened them from an old life of
[49:57] being a coward
[49:59] to a lack of the light of the tribe of
[50:01] jews
[50:02] they absolutely faced martyrdom nailed
[50:05] to crosses crucified upside down burnt
[50:07] part of their lives now
[50:10] no more tires death had no
[50:12] victory over them at all
[50:14] the dynamics was in the mechanics
[50:16] yes sir it quickened their mortal body
[50:19] now listen here's another thing for
[50:21] proof
[50:22] it's so quick enough in such a way do
[50:24] you know what they was lifted up in
[50:26] heavenly places and their mortal bodies
[50:28] were so quick until their language
[50:30] changed
[50:32] hallelujah it only quickened their
[50:34] language
[50:40] mortal bodies being quickened their
[50:42] language was quickened their thoughts
[50:44] were quicker their spirits were quicker
[50:46] their life were quicker they were quick
[50:49] and all together
[50:51] they tried to talk and couldn't talk in
[50:53] any more human languages they're so
[50:55] quick enough in the presence of god
[50:56] until they spoke in new tongues
[50:58] a heavenly language
[51:00] what a quickening power
[51:02] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[51:05] the dead dwells in you
[51:10] it will quicken your mortal bodies
[51:13] it'll make you do things you didn't do
[51:15] before
[51:17] this full quickening power then see your
[51:19] body ain't subject to sin no more you
[51:21] you're sorry he said come on out here
[51:23] you say shut your mouth
[51:25] oh we got the biggest shut your mouth
[51:29] you're an eagle jersey our independent
[51:31] little eagle off he don't hop like a
[51:33] vulture see
[51:35] dead know the carrying lane on the
[51:36] ground doctor he walked around
[51:40] touch him out boy here's a good dinner
[51:42] over here it's not for me
[51:45] my desires has changed
[51:47] my appetite is different
[51:49] for a man shall not live on the world of
[51:52] carrying alone but by every word that
[51:54] perceives out about the god of genuine
[51:57] quicken eagles is
[51:59] [Music]
[52:02] amen means so be it
[52:06] amen i i noticed i wanted to point out
[52:08] one thing that brother bram said about
[52:10] that
[52:11] is that
[52:12] you notice how he said they go they go
[52:14] to the place where they say it's 6
[52:16] 601 a half dozen or the other
[52:19] it doesn't matter all these things
[52:22] matter
[52:23] the word of god is tied together
[52:26] do you know what i mean so every part
[52:28] that you do
[52:29] has a part of that quickening power
[52:33] with it
[52:34] after
[52:35] full obedience to the word of god
[52:38] will bring every promise of god
[52:41] to pass
[52:43] so it it it it just it it
[52:46] it it quickens us and
[52:49] and you know i i like that
[52:52] that
[52:53] uh
[52:54] the whole
[52:57] realization of it that you can actually
[53:00] get into the presence of god till it'll
[53:02] make you act different live different
[53:03] things
[53:05] it'll change things for you
[53:07] it'll change to the environment it'll
[53:09] change your perception and it's hard to
[53:12] go forward if you got
[53:14] you know
[53:15] blinders on you know what i mean that
[53:18] you just
[53:19] that they can't see and that's what the
[53:20] enemy does you know like when they take
[53:22] a horse they put these little blinders
[53:25] on them and they only try to get them to
[53:27] see one little
[53:29] line of thought but what the word of god
[53:31] does it comes and opens you up and what
[53:34] happens is if we don't careful if we
[53:36] don't let the spirit quicken us and we
[53:39] don't let it
[53:40] raise us up into heavenly places and we
[53:44] don't see the possibilities of the
[53:47] things that we can do
[53:50] by the spirit of god
[53:53] then we always live short
[53:56] you know we always live short we don't
[53:59] we we never
[54:01] we'll never step out now
[54:04] and so this he's starting to talk here
[54:07] and he says it made them different they
[54:10] they're sitting in a room because
[54:12] they're afraid
[54:14] the quickening power comes on them
[54:16] now they're not afraid
[54:18] there's possibilities there
[54:21] that that they've never realized before
[54:24] that
[54:25] that there's potential there
[54:28] that they really didn't even realize
[54:30] they've had and you've heard it people
[54:32] can look at somebody an athlete or
[54:36] or
[54:37] someone that's good with math you look
[54:39] at a child he seems to be very bright
[54:42] and you think of all the potential that
[54:44] child has all the things that they could
[54:47] become
[54:49] all the things that exist in them right
[54:52] now
[54:53] that just has to be
[54:55] uh
[54:56] trained or brought to life
[54:58] or directed
[55:00] and and if you could ever get them in
[55:02] the right environment if you could ever
[55:04] get them to the right place
[55:06] that that that quality could be
[55:09] developed
[55:10] into being a real uh a real protege they
[55:15] i think they call it or some really
[55:18] outstanding well that's all on the
[55:19] carnal side
[55:21] he's sitting here telling us that we've
[55:23] got potential amen
[55:26] you understand that in us we've got the
[55:28] potential
[55:30] and now
[55:31] because we've heard the word of god
[55:34] and now the spirit of god quickens that
[55:36] work to us makes it flesh and brings
[55:39] that potential do you think peter
[55:41] realized being a fisherman on a boat
[55:44] that he had the potential to see
[55:47] dreams and visions and see the sheep
[55:49] come down and go to cornelius's house
[55:52] and
[55:53] and
[55:54] and do what he did no
[55:58] the potential was there
[56:01] you think that you look at that little
[56:03] seed
[56:04] apple seed
[56:06] do you realize that in that apple seed
[56:08] is a whole nother tree of apples
[56:13] that the potential in that apple seed
[56:16] is there
[56:18] and and so just think of what the
[56:21] potential is
[56:23] of the seed of god
[56:25] being you as sons and daughters of god
[56:28] what's it need to bring it to that
[56:30] potential it just needs that real fresh
[56:34] water
[56:35] of god's word
[56:37] and it'll bring that potential out so we
[56:40] it changed them from being cowards
[56:44] into being lines of the tribe of judah
[56:47] it changed paul from murdering the
[56:49] church to building the church
[56:52] and so when we can understand that that
[56:55] we
[56:56] we
[56:57] limit our potential because of our
[56:59] complexes we limit our potential because
[57:02] of what we perceive as weaknesses we
[57:05] limit our potential as what we perceive
[57:08] as false
[57:09] and and our potential is limited
[57:12] and when we and then we start selling
[57:15] ourselves short
[57:17] we start saying i can't do this i can't
[57:19] do this i can't do that but that's not
[57:21] what the word of god said the word of
[57:23] god said we can do all things through
[57:25] christ jesus and strengthen them
[57:28] amen
[57:29] so that's what we we want to just leave
[57:32] with us as we're going to continue to go
[57:35] forward
[57:36] there's potential
[57:39] and where do you want your potential to
[57:42] blossom
[57:44] in the power
[57:46] in the kingdom
[57:47] in the working of the lord
[57:50] or
[57:51] we don't want to be lukewarm
[57:54] we want to realize
[57:56] that
[57:57] if it was manif word made flesh in the
[58:00] groom
[58:02] it's got to be word made flesh and the
[58:04] bride
[58:05] the works that i do shall you do also in
[58:09] other words because i go to the father i
[58:13] will not leave you comfortless but i'll
[58:15] come again unto you and i'll be with you
[58:18] even in you i'll be the spark that
[58:22] brings your potential to the service to
[58:25] the surface and so that's what he said
[58:28] if we could get into that presence
[58:31] get into that
[58:33] atmosphere of the quickening power of
[58:37] god if we could get to where it fell
[58:39] down he said they got so quick and it
[58:41] changed their language they went out
[58:43] there men and brethren this is not this
[58:45] is what was promised by joel and those
[58:47] guys took notice man these peas are
[58:49] galileans but they took notice that
[58:52] they'd been with jesus see they got into
[58:54] the atmosphere
[58:56] that awakened
[58:59] the potential
[59:00] that's in us
[59:02] and that's what the revelation of god's
[59:04] word does it it it awakens the potential
[59:08] that you have
[59:10] in you
[59:11] and you don't think that this church
[59:13] that was in his mind from the beginning
[59:16] that was his elect lady you don't think
[59:18] that
[59:20] she's got potential
[59:22] you don't think he's got in fact he said
[59:25] we're his workmanship in christ jesus
[59:27] foreordained unto good works that we
[59:30] should walk in them i don't think we've
[59:32] tapped the potential and the power that
[59:36] we have as the sons and daughters of god
[59:40] the miracles that lie within you
[59:44] not you being the recipient of the
[59:47] miracle but the potential to speak the
[59:51] word that quickens and makes those
[59:54] things come
[59:55] to life
[59:56] and that's what he's beginning to talk
[59:59] about here about this spark this
[1:00:01] quickening of this mortal body that now
[1:00:04] these works can be done in this redeemed
[1:00:08] piece of clay
[1:00:11] and it could be manifested
[1:00:13] in
[1:00:14] the flesh
[1:00:15] so if you could just receive and
[1:00:19] and recognize and like i say we sell
[1:00:21] ourselves short oh i'm only a housewife
[1:00:24] i'm only a student i'm only this i'm
[1:00:27] only that i don't do i don't speak
[1:00:30] english good i can't do this well i'm
[1:00:33] bashful i'm shy i i've had some history
[1:00:36] in my past i've done this i've done that
[1:00:39] and pretty soon
[1:00:41] we've
[1:00:42] sold ourselves short
[1:00:45] we sold ours we convinced ourselves that
[1:00:49] we're not worthy to live up
[1:00:52] to the potential in fact we don't even
[1:00:54] look for the potential
[1:00:58] we've just
[1:00:59] closed the door
[1:01:01] on our own life
[1:01:04] just
[1:01:07] we just
[1:01:08] i don't expect
[1:01:11] anymore
[1:01:14] but he said
[1:01:16] the works that i do
[1:01:19] shall the person sit next to you do
[1:01:22] the works that i do the pastors should
[1:01:24] do the work said no he said the works
[1:01:27] that i do you shall do so basically he's
[1:01:29] saying you have potential
[1:01:32] to do far beyond what you can even think
[1:01:36] or comprehend
[1:01:38] amen
[1:01:41] if it's there we've just got to rise our
[1:01:45] thinking up into the potential of god's
[1:01:49] word and understand that there's a
[1:01:52] there's that god's got a spirit
[1:01:55] that can quicken that potential
[1:01:58] so you're not asking for an anointing
[1:02:01] you're asking for a
[1:02:04] revelation that quickens to you
[1:02:08] the potential that lies
[1:02:11] within you
[1:02:14] oh i i just don't know how to express it
[1:02:17] because i know i'm living below my
[1:02:19] privilege
[1:02:21] and that's what the prophet of god said
[1:02:23] he said i can't believe he said one of
[1:02:25] the sickest things
[1:02:27] today is the church of god because
[1:02:30] they're living
[1:02:31] so
[1:02:32] far
[1:02:33] below
[1:02:34] their potential
[1:02:36] so this as you go out this week i just
[1:02:38] want you to think of what god's done for
[1:02:40] you why that he's done it for you why
[1:02:43] that you understand the word
[1:02:47] because that word he said
[1:02:49] is that life and let me just read that
[1:02:52] statement
[1:02:53] again as we
[1:02:54] as we close here this evening he says
[1:02:58] that's the divine revelation of the word
[1:03:03] made flesh
[1:03:06] if it was flesh
[1:03:08] in that day by the sun the groom
[1:03:11] its flesh today
[1:03:13] by the bride
[1:03:17] it's flesh the day
[1:03:19] by the bride
[1:03:20] so everything that he is
[1:03:25] when he spoke of the groom he spoke of
[1:03:27] the bride
[1:03:29] and the bride can only bring to pass
[1:03:33] what's been spoken of her because what's
[1:03:36] been spoken of her is the predestinated
[1:03:40] potential that she has
[1:03:43] so it's just like me taking uh just the
[1:03:46] the the youngest uh
[1:03:49] a child
[1:03:50] in here like i i know this morning i
[1:03:53] forgot to uh uh recon nice elizabeth but
[1:03:57] uh just this morning if if we would just
[1:04:00] take her today
[1:04:02] we'd look at her she's a little child
[1:04:04] but if i was capable of speaking i would
[1:04:07] say you're a great piano player you're a
[1:04:10] great singer you're a great
[1:04:12] mathematician you're a great dish you're
[1:04:15] a great dad but we would only have
[1:04:17] carnal examples then once that's spoken
[1:04:21] that's the potential
[1:04:24] that
[1:04:25] that
[1:04:27] child has
[1:04:28] because i'm the creator
[1:04:31] so the bride he spoke
[1:04:35] the potential
[1:04:37] into the bride
[1:04:39] so she possesses the
[1:04:41] potential
[1:04:43] just like he spoke let every seed bring
[1:04:46] forth of its own kind
[1:04:48] so when he spoke he spoke that that seed
[1:04:52] would bring forth therefore the
[1:04:54] potential is in the seed to bring forth
[1:04:59] what it was spoken of
[1:05:01] so if he said you're the seed of god and
[1:05:04] you would do the works that he would do
[1:05:07] that you would be endued with the same
[1:05:09] life that he was endued that he wouldn't
[1:05:12] leave you comfortless but he would come
[1:05:14] under again another he's already spoke
[1:05:19] of your potential
[1:05:23] and then we sell ourselves short
[1:05:27] of the very potential he's given us
[1:05:30] for some
[1:05:32] carnal reason
[1:05:35] that he doesn't even see
[1:05:38] because he covered it with his blood
[1:05:44] and then what are we doing
[1:05:46] we're selling ourselves
[1:05:48] short
[1:05:50] we're not giving ourselves
[1:05:53] the value
[1:05:55] that we really are worth
[1:05:59] i can't do this i can't testify
[1:06:02] i can't i don't know
[1:06:04] what
[1:06:05] i i i don't know but i know what he said
[1:06:08] my potential was that the works that i
[1:06:10] do that i could do all things through
[1:06:13] christ jesus who what quickens me
[1:06:16] strengthens me
[1:06:19] sparks me
[1:06:22] so there's no need to shrink back
[1:06:26] there's no need to be afraid there's no
[1:06:28] need to go
[1:06:30] forward
[1:06:31] so you walk by faith
[1:06:34] because he already spoke the potential
[1:06:37] in you
[1:06:38] he said lay your hands on the sick and
[1:06:41] they shall recover
[1:06:43] is that what he said
[1:06:44] so
[1:06:46] that means i can only be
[1:06:49] what was spoken of me to be
[1:06:52] so he's already told me that i have the
[1:06:55] potential
[1:06:57] to lay my hands on the sick
[1:07:00] and they recover
[1:07:03] now
[1:07:05] what's that based on
[1:07:08] nothing else but his word
[1:07:14] and so he's can make that potential
[1:07:18] manifest in the flesh if it manifested
[1:07:20] in him
[1:07:22] in the groom it manifests in the bride
[1:07:25] so you understand he can't let the
[1:07:28] potential he spoke of
[1:07:31] not come to its fullness
[1:07:34] then he spoke something that's not
[1:07:37] true
[1:07:41] now i can lie
[1:07:44] but god can't amen
[1:07:47] i can say dylan's gonna break
[1:07:49] uh
[1:07:51] i don't know who hit the most home runs
[1:07:54] anymore it's kind of a controversy but
[1:07:56] anyway i could say you're going to break
[1:07:58] the home run record
[1:08:02] well
[1:08:03] but if god said
[1:08:06] he's going to be the all-time home run
[1:08:09] king he's going to be the all-time home
[1:08:11] run king i don't care how little he is
[1:08:14] or how blind he is or whatever it don't
[1:08:17] matter god said so god already spoke the
[1:08:20] potential
[1:08:22] now
[1:08:23] what's he saying
[1:08:25] he's saying i'm going to send my
[1:08:28] quickening power to bring the potential
[1:08:32] that i spoke of you to pass
[1:08:38] now what's my expectation
[1:08:43] deal
[1:08:46] i don't want to be live short
[1:08:48] i don't want to sell my shop short
[1:08:51] i don't want to think and look at all my
[1:08:53] complexes and and everything
[1:08:57] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:09:02] he's exalted
[1:09:04] by putting the potential
[1:09:06] in you
[1:09:08] and then doing it
[1:09:10] and bringing it past
[1:09:12] beyond your human capability
[1:09:15] praise the lord
[1:09:18] hallelujah
[1:09:20] exceedingly
[1:09:22] and abundantly
[1:09:24] great and precious promises
[1:09:27] that we have that he's going to bring it
[1:09:30] to pass but as we move forward in this
[1:09:33] and we understand why this is a
[1:09:35] beautiful easter
[1:09:37] that he's talking about why it's
[1:09:39] resurrecting because the potential
[1:09:42] that's in you that he's quick in this
[1:09:44] body and now the potential that he's
[1:09:47] spoken is going to resurrect
[1:09:51] out of the barnyard
[1:09:52] out of the flesh it's going to come to
[1:09:55] life and it's going to come into its
[1:09:57] full potential and it's going to be
[1:10:00] manifest what's spoken of it
[1:10:02] beyond
[1:10:04] our own abilities
[1:10:06] and that's a thrill
[1:10:08] can you imagine you slipping by a
[1:10:10] bedside and taking someone by the hand
[1:10:12] and praying for him and get well
[1:10:17] do you believe you have that potential
[1:10:19] do you believe you have the potential to
[1:10:21] sit down with someone and open the bible
[1:10:24] and start reading the scriptures to them
[1:10:26] and lead them to the lord and actually
[1:10:29] have the transformation power of god
[1:10:31] cleanse them from their unrighteousness
[1:10:34] and then to accept the lord jesus in
[1:10:36] their heart and come to life who does
[1:10:38] that you do that
[1:10:42] he does it in you
[1:10:44] it's the potential that he spoke of you
[1:10:47] that doesn't it's his word manifested in
[1:10:50] you that he already spoke
[1:10:53] it's already there
[1:10:56] every
[1:10:57] fruit
[1:10:58] is already in the seed
[1:11:00] every attribute of god is already in
[1:11:03] there it's in potential but he can't
[1:11:07] leave it in potential
[1:11:11] he's got to take it from potential
[1:11:13] into manifestation
[1:11:15] so don't
[1:11:17] and let's not
[1:11:19] sell ourselves
[1:11:21] short
[1:11:24] don't
[1:11:26] don't sell yourself short
[1:11:29] all things are possible to them that
[1:11:31] believe
[1:11:34] i it's it's i just can't even imagine
[1:11:38] what what the power that you possess and
[1:11:42] the miracles that can be wrought by your
[1:11:44] hand because he's already spoken so lord
[1:11:48] bless you let's stand together this
[1:11:50] evening and we'll have billy lead us in
[1:11:52] a couple of songs before we go
[1:11:56] so as we're moving forward understand
[1:11:59] that god spoke something
[1:12:02] that he has to bring to life
[1:12:05] do you hear that
[1:12:07] he spoke something
[1:12:09] that he has to bring to life
[1:12:12] he placed in you a potential
[1:12:14] and a promise that he has to make
[1:12:17] manifest because there's one thing he
[1:12:19] can't do is he can't lie
[1:12:22] so all you have to do is lift up and say
[1:12:24] here i am lord
[1:12:27] make me
[1:12:28] exactly what you
[1:12:30] had in mind let us pray our gracious
[1:12:33] heavenly father we appreciate your word
[1:12:35] so much
[1:12:38] as we're
[1:12:40] listening to our great messenger
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:45] father here we've listened already to so
[1:12:48] much and
[1:12:49] he says oh my i'm just getting warmed up
[1:12:53] father and i think we're just beginning
[1:12:55] to take the wax out of our ears
[1:12:59] we're just beginning to come to the
[1:13:01] place hey there's more in this than i've
[1:13:04] thought it it goes far beyond
[1:13:07] just
[1:13:08] the messenger
[1:13:11] being the fulfillment of malachi 4 5.
[1:13:14] it goes far beyond just the receiving
[1:13:18] the anointing or the reign of the spirit
[1:13:23] this is actually the day where the bride
[1:13:25] actually comes into
[1:13:28] existence just as the groom was
[1:13:31] manifested in fleshly existence so is
[1:13:35] the bride resurrected in a present tense
[1:13:38] resurrection
[1:13:39] to a of the full potential
[1:13:43] of what's spoken of her lord and i pray
[1:13:47] that we don't sell ourselves short
[1:13:50] that we don't stop that we don't hit an
[1:13:52] obstacle
[1:13:53] and say this is all the farther we go
[1:13:56] we don't slip off in a ditch somewhere
[1:13:59] and say oh i've got to remain here
[1:14:02] but lord that we understand that if it's
[1:14:04] been spoken then it must be fulfilled
[1:14:08] the bride must come forth
[1:14:10] and fulfill
[1:14:12] and manifest what's been spoken of her
[1:14:15] that's your potential
[1:14:17] being brought into full existence
[1:14:20] lord i just pray that
[1:14:23] it'll sink in our hearts seriously
[1:14:27] and we'll truly get down to real
[1:14:29] business in this hour
[1:14:32] lord that we won't
[1:14:34] sell ourselves short and we won't
[1:14:37] be led away or sidetracked
[1:14:40] but we'll press the mark of the higher
[1:14:42] calling
[1:14:43] leaving those things which are behind
[1:14:45] behind and going up and forward for we
[1:14:49] ask it in jesus name amen
