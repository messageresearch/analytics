Description:
Let Your Request be Made Known
Br. Andrew Bohannan
August 27, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

they want to come at this time it seems a special amen Senate school is dismissed to go on the back God bless you Church uh just before we begin I just wanted to um give just a small testimony I mean nothing is too small gr for the Lord uh about three four weeks ago I think coming back from Camp my left wrist I don't know what was wrong with it it was just in so much pain and uh for those that know I I serve for a job so I use my left hand to like balance trays and stuff like that and uh I think I came to one of the services I don't remember who was preaching but I was just like Lord you know I use this hand and I kind of need it and I don't know what's wrong and they're telling me I might get like a bandage and maybe something was dislocated but I was like well I don't know but I just wanted to be well and today in the service I think like last week I kind of noticed it but like I just didn't pay attention to it so today as they were preaching and I was like oh wait the pain is not there so [Applause] [Music] yeah the news came to Jesus please come [Music] fast Lazarus is sick and without your help he will not last Mary and Martha watch their brother die they waited for Jesus he did not come and they wondered why the death which was over bu for days somebody said he soon be here the Lord's on his way marur to him and then she cried Lord if you had been here you could have healed him still be [Music] alive but your days late and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand why you waited so long but his way is God's way not yours oh mine is great when he is 4 days late he's still on time Jesus said [Music] [Applause] Martha show me the grave but she said Lord Lord you don't understand he's been there for days the gravestone was rolled back then Jesus cried Lazarus come forth then somebody said he's alive is alive but he your days late and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand why you waited so long but his way is God's way not yours oh mine isn't it great when he 4 days late he still on time you may be fighting a battle of fear you've cried to the Lord I need you now he has not appeared friends don't be discouraged cuz he still the [Music] same he'll soon be here he'll roll back the stone and he call out your [Music] name but it's 4 days L and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand what you wa so long but his way is God's way not yours or mine is great when his four days late he still on time when for days L and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand why you waited so long but here's way is God's way not yours or mine isn't it great when his for days late here still on time isn't it great when his 4 days late he still on [Applause] [Music] time amen he's always on time we're going to take the tithes and offering at this time the brothers are ready to come and take the tithes and offerings we don't have any written requests but continue to pray for those that are still out and need help and you know sometimes when the Lord puts a burden on your heart it's for a purpose and it's for a reason and so it's not in vain that the Lord puts something on somebody's heart and so if you have a burden to pray for somebody or keep somebody on your heart do it because it's from the Lord and it could change things because now we're playing the position of a body and everyone's desire becomes one another's desire to carry us through together because we're a family amen Amen brother Orlando if you just want to come pray for the tithes all the names [Music] Amen Let Us bow our heads father in the mighty name of Jesus Lord

day approaching Lord gather yourself the more Lord what a perplexing time and what a distressful hour it is the world is falling apart there's chaos in the land but father you've sent a message Lord that brought stabilizers to us Lord and we thank you for it Lord and we pray God that you would take from the storehouse tonight and bless your people Lord encourage them Lord do as only as you can as we commit it all to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord so good to see everyone thank you musicians wonderful job we feel the presence of the Lord so wonderful how many's happy to be back in the house of the Lord amen we don't plan on keeping you long tonight as just trust the Lord will help me just kind of share a little something that he placed on my heart I know it'll be an encouragement to you if the Lord would just have his way amen so if you have your Bible and you want to turn with me we'll go to mark 11 certainly happy for the testimonies of our Lord and how he's undertaken for us we know that brother Tommy had a request for his sister Vicki and we're just believing with him that the supernatural God that we believe in will be his portion and and that Vicki will soon see the hand of God once again Amen in Mark 11 we're going to read verse 12-4 it says this and on the tomorrow when he was come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves he came if happily that he might finding any of any anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eateth fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it amen we also want to read if you could turn with me to Philippians chapter 3 you know it's our heart's desire that the Lord would move upon us and the Lord is the word amen so we want to say Lord let your word come into my heart and put me into action inspire me by your word we know that it has to drop through the channel of our mind but we want it to anchor down in our heart where the spirit of the Lord will overshadow his word in our heart and it's just now that faith that we've heard this morning amen I want that Victory so in Philippians if you found it say amen praise the Lord we're going to read there in verse we'll start with verse 17 3 and 17 Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example well I thank God that he has men that are examples that we can follow after amen for many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are enemies of the Cross of Christ whose in is destruction whose God is their belly whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly things for our conversation is in heaven you know that word conversation in the in the reference reading it says our citizenship I really like that for our citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile bodies that it may be fashioned liken unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to sedo All Things unto himself amen if we could also read there one more scripture passage in Philippians 4 and we'll find that in verse 4 Philippians 4 just one chapter forward rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice I like that emphasis amen if you're sad today Rejoice doesn't matter what the doesn't matter what the situation is the word says that you can Rejoice he wouldn't tell you that and then confirm it by saying it again if you can't do it no matter how dark the situation Rejoice Amen Let Your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which pathe all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are true whatsoever Things Are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things these things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen them in me do and the peace of God shall be with you amen we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats well I certainly appreciate that you know it's you know we we need a time right now that the peace of God would be in our hearts now everything in the world jobs School the demands of life and things like that is to rob the peace of God from our lives but we have within the word of God we can make I love this it says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and that for a title I want to speak to you a little bit about letting let your request be made known you know it's it's so important you know in relationship if you never tell your friends or your loved ones what your request for them is and there there's no way for them to respond back there's no way to to Really share with you like hey I want to do this because You' requested this of me and I want to do what's pleasing to you right you know it's so important that we let our request be made known even with our relationships with one another you know sometimes it's so hard just to like the scripture says because there's all these things that our minds are are being polluted because we're in a world that's polluted and there rejecting God but the scriptures admonishing us to think on these things think on things that are pure Things Are Holy and you know we don't have to succumb to the world that's right we don't have to bow down to all of the thinking all of its impurities all of its requirements you must work you must this you must but the scripture says think on these things amen so we want to forsake everything else we want to let the word of God have preeminence we want to think on these things you know that's that you know the enemy is not just trying to steal away our peace but like we heard today he's trying to he's he's attacking our faith you see if we just get so like like it says there in uh Philippians 3:19 he says like there was destruction because their minds were on Earthly things you know and the belly is a type of appetites the things that are fleshly man it Wars against the spirit and it's going in One Direction that's destruction but who shall change our vile bodies amen and our citizenship is in heaven amen and I was just thinking you know I in my own personal study and you know you sometimes probably do the same thing but you know the script SC saying by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving you know we're living in an atmosphere where people are unthankful they're Unholy you know but the scripture is saying clearly it's it's there's no Shadow of Doubt it's saying clearly by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known so it doesn't matter how hard the trial is by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving we don't want to miss that part I like how brother Billy pointed it out it's not in our frustration that we're going to God and speaking the word you know you know I like it how even Brother David said something or maybe it was brother Matthew but you know sometimes someone runs you off the road you know I just let them die you know it's like that's not the right attitude you know it's like wait a minute am I speaking out of my frustration you know is that is that Earthly minded or is is that taking the citizen ship that I have in Christ and letting it speak amen you know just for a little subject as you know the scripture says in another place it says whosoever shall say and I thought that's an important subject because sometimes it's whatsoever you say we we dwell on that part of it like what you say but now the scripture also says in another place whosoever whosoever shall say to this mountain and you know this is so important because because we are citizens from another kingdom because you have power that's backing up your word so now we want to make sure that we're speaking those things that are pure that are honest that are of a good report things that are lovely amen we want to be mindful we want to be conscience that God wants to use our testimony he wants to use our expression of our mouth our face our actions the way we dress how we conduct ourselves with the co-workers who who just slandered your name slandered your character hey that your school buddy said you were cheating well if you were cheating you need to go make it right but if you weren't you know just bear it you know like I I thank God for such an example that we can follow like brother Brandon you know we said oh you know uh they said he wasn't at the meeting and he's back there behind you know but he he's not going to destroy the man and his character he held his peace we have power to hold our peace we have power to speak the truth in love amen but we want to be in the spirit so when he comes upon us it's him speaking I'm tired of me speaking I want God to speak cuz you know as we know that our minds we've been feeding on the word of God God has been ministering to us and the word is in our heart but like I like it how brother Billy brought it out we need God to come upon that word and anoint it so it can live amen man you know I was studying in perfect faith and then brother Billy jumps right in there and praise God I love it yeah just something out of uh perfect faith that I wanted to draw some attention to also is you know I believe that it's in um it was read this morning but just a little bit further in 39 he says now I want to get this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how we are too close to the end now I believe the church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things to rub out some of the UN the make belief out and get into real something real see it's got to be something that you know and if if you say brother Brandon that isn't light I'm looking at it well how do you know that you could be wrong my sight has always declared to me that that was light see and that's the reason I believe those Visions CU it's always declared to be the truth cuz if it comes from the word then if it's he says it then that settles it and then it declares like that there's no guesswork it's going to be then you go beyond human thinking it's up into the realm of the Lord's thinking but when you're standing here just as he just as the branches produce the fruit that's in the vine see God uses man and man only God doesn't use machine God doesn't use groups of men God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always amen I love that because that includes everybody in here amen who's an individual in here hallelujah God uses individuals praise God our citizenship is not of this world each and every one of us have a part to play God wants to express Christ through your world right I certainly appreciated the word of the Lord amen you know I um I trust in the Lord will take the service completely into his hands because I've been battling something about a while of giving a little testimony but I just trust the Lord will help but I wanted to share this out of perfect Faith you know brother brandom sometimes it just seems so simple as he's kind of just introductory just talking and letting his heart just speaking you know and and all of a sudden God takes even just your natural course of life just your natural interactions with people and the world and different things it's already Christ bubbling up that Fountain it was already living out it's not just come to speak to you a a speech but he's declaring The Life of Christ amen and and it was also like Paul Paul said follow me as I followed Christ you know I just so love that and praise the Lord you know at the very introduction it says this in in paragraph 8 he says now many of you you were uh waiting over there till the morning and you've got a long distance to go and appreciate that some of you will drive tonight because you got to work by daylight in the morning I know that's hard how many's got to drive tonight got work you see you see the scripture how he identifies present don't think about just brother brandham so far away but God he's here he's telling you the same thing I know it's hard and then when I think and see see that you know I got spells too you know I get moody I get to a spot where what gets me is when I get to those spells when I get all overworked and Satan tells comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world see he's still the same Devil he's got the same tactic but we got the word of God faith in the word of God will overcome that devil remember I'm not immune to Temptation I love it how he's identifying that as a Temptation oh nobody cares for you oh my my praise God I love how he gives the remedy he gives the Cure against it he says remember I'm not immune to Temptation see I've got to to overcome that then when I look back and see like this and it puts it right back in his face and says what about that see he was given testimony amen he was given testimony and then he goes on and says another one he says like a certain friend of mine sitting here the clan doesn't believe in Divine Healing come to this young fellow recently and said that stuff that is just preaching there about Divine Healing there's nothing to it and this man lived in Kentucky right near this old woman and then the act acting cramp grounds so you know this uh I believe it was brother Ben you know he was playing tapes and believing and one day they felt to go up there and take this handkerchief and pray for them and you know it ca it came to be that this woman that she was going to die there was no hope for her and God raised her up and she's making like fried apple pies and she's you know and brother brandom saying see that put the devil to shame see that brought an encouragement to brother Brandon you know when the temp when the tempter comes to you and starts with this nonsense you just go back and see you count your blessings and she see how many times God was faithful to his word that'll put it to shame right back in the devil's face I'm here to put shame right back back in the devil's face you're your your life your individual life is to put the devil to shame he he said you ain't going to be nothing for God and now what now what there's a blood there's a promised [Music] word but the devil to shame that's my business not not because anything I did but because what he said would happen in me and I've received it I've accepted it I believed on it and I've acted on it and God confirmed it I'm just a recipient amen that's what Amazing Grace is hallelujah praise the Lord I'm getting excited love the word you know if we just double back a little bit and say you know this this supplication I was I was pondering it because you know we want peace the peace of God to rule in our lives and you know if if you know Faith Masters all circumstances and and you know brother Bram said pray for Revelation and so part of what Paul was saying here and I'm I'm just was picking up on it you know this is a this is a requirement for the believer is to pray for Revelation and said not only pray for revelation but he says let your request be made known unto God you know sometimes we make our our petition known unto man you know what do you think I'm thinking and so we constantly sometimes we get frustrated because we're not going to God this says go to God make it known to God sometimes there's something that we're going through if we'll just make it known to God you know sometimes when you start sharing different things all of a sudden it's fueling the fire of the enemy against you it actually hurts your own faith we want to we want to let the power that God vested in us to control our tongue when it's time to be silent let's be silent when it's time to speak we'll speak so I just I was thinking about that supplication and I was searching you know what what did Brother Brandon say anything about this word supplication cuz well I want I want all of the word I want every bit of it don't you feel that way if there's something in the word I want it if it's because it's for me it's for you you're the individual that the word wants to manifest in amen you believe it's for you it is for you praise God one one uh commentator said this for the Latin translation says sub suppli care meaning to plead humbly supplication can also be summarized as a request to God in our request or supplication we must be wise to ask God for things that will truly enrich in our lives like wisdom strength health and love you know I just thought it was interesting the way that supplication was broke down in this was like Supply and Care together Supply and care you know and what a perversion someone would be um you know inspired by Commerce the God of this world you know Satan's Eden to call uh something that supplies everybody's needs every day they call it a Amazon but it's so close to amazing but you know what this supplication is not just for our needs but for our families for our burdens for our loved ones you know it's just suppli care my another commentator said supplication is prayer to God or a re respectful request to someone in Authority for help well I really like that one you know when you pray and you're going to God in supplication there's no higher authority than the word of God and God likes to hear his word amen and this also says he raises his arms as a gesture of Supplication the government has today resisted all supplication appeal prayer pleading I just thought that was neat you know it's really you know when you're desperate and you're Earnest like if you know it's life and death you you know someone got a gun you're going to raise your hands you know I just you know this is for me you know I just say sometimes you know we take prayer and supplication to haphazard you know and we value or esteem other things and I'm talking about me I'm just being honest from my heart you know and I'm just saying I'm letting my request be made known enough of that enough of that if if God can give me a revelation how power powerful prayer and supplication is giving thanks to God Amen then we can do what he said do but we have to lay aside other things prayer and supplication is prayer that lifts up request to God supplication is often divided between requests for ourselves petitions and the requests that are made on behalf of others intercession so we've been made Kings and Priests amen you I just love the word of God because you know every time we open the word of God it gives us Vision you know we need Vision to walk forward it's a lamp to our feet you know I just um I I'll share this little testimony and um Lord's really you know this week has just it's really been overwhelming to me how um you know it just I was reflecting back you know um back in 2000 or I'm sorry 1999 in January you know I gave my heart to the Lord and it was very um it was very painful time for me and um I had I had a friend that he he just was a worldly guy you know he's a drug dealer and he did all kinds of stuff not too far from here and you know it was that night and uh I ended up getting arrested for driving well intoxicated and and I'm not glorifying that situation but I'm saying this to testify of what God can do when you commit your life to his hands you know I'm like that woman that says I'm not what I was you know it's so wonderful and so you know we we we look back to see this is all been God's hand in our lives the entire time you know I'm I'm s in the drunk tank overnight here in Bedford in this old he was like 90 years old he was like some Methodist Minister he came out and he said you know he was talking with the guy across the way and I was sitting on the bunk and you know just regretting a lot of my choices and just seeing my condition how I was I didn't want to live you know I I didn't have no hope I didn't have no vision and so as I was pondering that and you know I was thinking you know uh what is this guy talking about he's talking to some guy and there was just two cells you know it's not just a little city jail whatever and so um he turned and looked at me and I I jumped off the the bunk and I started walking over to him and and I was like you know you know I just had a lot of Shame you know like how could I let this be and so he ended up saying he goes you know there's a lot of people that find God in these places and I just you know in my heart you know it was what I needed to hear at that time you know and and God knows what you need to hear tonight amen you know and and what that caused was a chain reaction of things in my life it caused opportunities to rise where I really I didn't want to but at that time what he said had such an impact on me because I had a lot of questions and I had a lot of fears and doubts and you know it caused me to start looking inside you know if you if you really give yourself time and quiet your own Spirit quiet your own thoughts and your own mind and you get along with God you get along with God somewhere you know what the first thing you're going to come in contact with your heart and if you're a sinner it's darkness and it's scary to to see what you become to see the kind of person that you didn't want to be that you didn't want to do do all of those things but you couldn't help it you were born that way you were under a sentence you were separated from God and you come into that condition and so I I I found within me that I said I could not live this way anymore something something must be different and so it set me on a course of searching out what is truth you know and and I began to do what they call soul searching and so as I was journeying through that you know someone said you know hey you know cuz I thought oh yeah you're an alcoholic and this is your problem it's an incurable disease and oh that's the answer that's why I'm so you know under this oppression and I can't get Victory and I'm because now I know this is and so that went on for a season but when they're going through through and they telling me that these steps that you must take are biblically Bas stepped I'm like why go through the middleman let me just go directly to the man so I'm like wait a minute if you're taking and pulling and saying this and that why don't I just go directly to it the source and so as I began to read it I'm like wait a minute oh my goodness and so now I had to go back and make these things that I did where I hurt people I did things that wrong I lied I stole that things that Sinners do and so then I was like wait a minute so one of the things that just became so hard for me to see is how I needed even though I felt a right to be angry at my dad which my mom and dad separated when I was like three months and I have never met my dad and so at that time I felt Justified yeah if I ever see him if he's still alive and now I'm 22 years old at that time I'm just going to let him know what I really think and then maybe I'll hug him but I was really because I didn't know like everything in life seemed to be oh you're the reason you're the reason I don't have this and I don't have that or I don't have these opportunities because of this situation that I'm under and you know that God began to deal with my heart and so as I as I I begin to realize you know you I like how brother brother Matthew said in his sermon he said I want Victory amen don't you want victory and that's what that's where I was in my heart I said I want Victory and whatever it takes let me search through cuz I don't want to be bound by anything that I've done in Life or anything that I'm thinking in my heart wrong Lord and so all of a sudden I realized you know what the Lord moved on my heart and said you know what we go to the to the internet and at that time it was just kind of launching out but I I bought this little service for you know finding people and I paid the fee and and I thought well maybe he's alive I need to you know see if he's alive at least maybe I can you know make contact with him I don't know but I'm just praying about it because one of the things they told me like if you're going to make amends or if you're going to do something don't do it just to get it off your chest and then you're free from it because you got to consider the other party you don't go and just tell them a and now you're delivered but it puts them in bondage and they want to take their own life that's not the right approach so what I did was I I I found his I'm like whoa he still lives in the same place where I was born and what he's a lot you know and so I wrote his number down his address and I put it in an envelope or I put it in a little piece of paper in my wallet and I was praying about it and I wanted I knew that I needed to do this because in my heart it was still I had bitterness towards it I had bondage but I wanted to be free and so I was asking the Lord I said Lord I don't want it to be me I want it to be you amen and so I held that in my wallet for almost two years and so one day uh in 2002 and this is around Christmas couple days before I was reading in the scripture and we'll just turn there and just see what the Lord has for us but the scripture I believe is in uh in Mark we were just there but Mark chap 11 and so as I was reading this scripture and I'll read it there in verse 22 it looks like U where we'll begin but it says Jesus answered saying unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father which also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven Heaven forgive your trespasses you know and I think that you know when I was there you know when I gave my heart to the Lord I I um the Lord was so gracious to um around six months after that or a year I had a friend named Shane and he was testifying to me and so I started going to his church and so I'd been going to church for years um up to this point maybe two years and as I was reading that scripture though the the Lord put that burden on my heart you know and and I it it brought like a like in my heart I I I knew that he had already forgive me and it was so weird now I'm challenged in another way you know aren't you thankful that God wants to challenge you he he wants you to be all that he spoke of you he's gonna express it amen and so as I was I was there pondering this I'm like wait a minute how is this saying I won't be forgiven since I'm already forgiven but then I realized now God wanting to free me amen and this was the hour this was the moment and so when it dawned on me I must act on the word of God I just pulled that out of my phone out of my wallet picked up the phone and I made the call you know and and I didn't have time to ponder too much what because I've had a lifetime of wondering if he was alive or what and so when I when I got an answer on the other end and I told him who I was and you know it just it was a moment that you know I it's just hard to express but it was it was a blessing and so from that time I told him I said you know I'm a Christian he said I just told him I said I don't need to know all the stuff that would happen between you and my mom but I want you to know that I'm a Christian and I had bitterness in my heart and and I had unforgiveness because I couldn't understand but I want you to know that the Lord's given me peace over this and I'm letting you know now that the door is wide open if you want to have fellowship or relationship with me I I have nothing hindering that and so you know I believe that that did something for me and and opening the door I think could do something for him but I'm not trying to control what's the outcome of it and so as I'm praying and then you know I find out that I have a sister and two other brothers and I'm just like you know the like sometimes in life you know you if you've never known your father you could have like a lot of people say well you know you do that just like your father and you'd be like I don't understand what do you mean how is it that I'm doing and acting in a certain way when I've never seen him do that or watched him do that but you know that's what the scripture says let every seed bring forth after its own kind its likeness and image so now God began to deal with my heart after that because I obeyed the word of God God began to say to me speaking back to me I'm your father you see as isn't it wonderful God's looking for obedience God wants you to do what he said do do without conditions like God if you do this then you know I'm or or God if I do this I want you you know it's like uh we ain't going to put God's hand in no no shackles you know he'll do exactly what he said but the timing's up to him and so as I you know I begin to realize you know hey I want to have fellowship with my dad and um finding out that I had the sister and everything like that was kind of exciting but you know they live in Utah and I hadn't been to Utah since I was you know born and so anyway we ended up uh you know maybe within a short time six months or something I I made a call one time to talk to him and and the current wife you know who they'd been married like like basically the entire time except maybe four or five years when I was four or five years old so he said he waited but then he got married so anyway I I was on the other line with her and she said something to the effect that made me feel like I might have um like my interactions may have stirred something and so I didn't know how to take that and so I just kind of backed off like I don't I don't want to upset things you know and this is like 20 years ago and so you know as I was going through that and and realizing like you know you can imagine somebody and I know there's people here that maybe their father's passed away or they don't know their father and similar way but um you know it's interesting that you know like like I I had one picture that I can look and say oh that's my father you know but I would never know because I only had the picture I never talked to him and I never was able to ask him questions or anything like that in person but one day I wanted to come face to face with him you know it wasn't it wasn't the man it was the life in the man and so as I I was beginning ending you know to desire this and you know it wasn't too long ago that um Brother David preached a message called you know our fellowship is with the father and it was on Father's Day and you know it it's interesting uh for me because I had never met my father face to face and so after he preached that the Lord began to deal with my heart and and um you know just the time in the season it seemed very difficult to to um to bypass and just take up for Utah and and to go visit him and I you know without getting too much in the details because it would take a while but I would have to say this that that we ended up doing that and um you know what was so special to me is you know just like the faith of Abraham you know he waited so many years but he held on to the promise promise because he believed that God was able you know and so I um we we were able to connect like even even I'll say it like this even after Brother David preached that message on Father's Day it was like I went home that night and I called him because you know it was it was so awesome brother David talking about his father and saying how he was part of the the the teachers union and things like that he he said he began to understand a little bit more about himself as he saw his his father and the way he did things and things like that and I love it how those things are just so natural typing the spiritual like you there's things that you do that the faith of God in you is moving God is moving in you sometimes Faith just is so subconscious or unconscious to your own thinking but if we'll just let the love of God that we have for the word of of God move on us amen that's what we want and so I went home and I talked to him and you know it's amazing I spent the next uh like almost 4 hours it was like 1:00 in the morning we we still going to go on it was so amazing you know what's comforting to me sometimes if there's something going on in your life with the relationship a lot of times you have your idea and why people are doing certain things but but my heart became burdened for him because like his upbringing was terrible and um it it really it you know like they say if it doesn't matter how thin you slice it there's always two sides to every situation and so as I began to realize like his condition his situation wow with what he had up against him he was in no position to raise children and so you know my heart became burdened and I was I was realizing that God's dealing with my heart by a burden and I wanted fellowship with my father because now I realize God's in it the moment that something starts dealing with your heart God's in it right now I'm not talking about your head or your emotion I'm talking about your heart when you have the truth in your heart and God begins to move on your heart and you know you can tie it back to the word of God then you know God's on the scene amen now but we're in that that great Crossroads what are you going to do about it like he showed his care for you now can you show your care back it's like he loved me he saved me he did this for me I know that gives me confidence that he wants to use me sometimes we're like there you want to use me there like man it's going to be nerve-wracking going and visiting him and all of that what could that be like how is it going to feel like but casting down reason when God puts a burden on your heart and by faith you're moving forward God will meet you there and you'll have boldness in that moment and so that was what we recently did is we went and visited him and I could say much about it but one thing I'll say is you know I thank God for the message because it has changed me I couldn't imagine if when I first got saved and and the Lord really started you know getting saved is to take you out of sin to take you out of the bondage of sin to where you can believe God and manifest the word of God right because before when you're a sinner you just you didn't believe you had that Amnesia oh I'm I'm just you know I'm just 4 foot six or whatever but no there was a life inside of you that can come to life amen so I thank God that we were able to go and you know I I um I was able to talk to him and and find out many things and and visit with family and and and like I said I'm thankful that I didn't necessarily jump to the occasion because you know God promised a restoration of the brid tree and you know unless the seed is planted this this seed the sewing seed rain the teaching rain you know how is someone going to see the fruit of it it's so important that we pray for Revelation but we go and hear the word of God because now it's like I go and I'm fellowshipping with him and I'm talking to him and I mean he's he's a he's a college professor of of Theology and they're you know latterday Saints Mormon and things like that but you know that doesn't shake me because I know what we have it's the real genuine product and it the fruit of it there's people it doesn't matter what bondage they're in they want to partake in something that's real something that's that's food in season and so as we were fellowshipping I I just you know I was able to share a few things and you know at the end of it when we left Utah and this was you know not too long ago when we were gone but it it was amazing that my uh one of my half Brothers the one that I got to meet he was we were saying our goodbyes and um he said you know he said you know the way that your family is how they are and and your wife and you know he said it's a real Testament to me and and I'll just say this so you can kind of understand where he's coming from you know he was raised Mormon and recently he you know my sister Rachel was saying you know John's not in church anymore he's he's away from the church and he's and he even told me he's like I don't even know where my faith is I don't even know what I believe and so you you talk about the Life of Christ on display and I'm not lifting up anything but I'm lifting up the word and the what God said he would do the works that he would perform he's doing it am so if you got doubt about your experience you know what just wait a while he'll confirm it to you that all this time all of this time as you're feeding as you're praying God he's going to use your testimony amen so we were really rejoicing knowing that you know the the gospel is effectual you know the fruit of this message will make a difference in so and else's life so just be faithful to continue to pray and let your requests be made known you know it's just so important and I'll just say this and I don't know how much time we've been here clock's wrong here I don't know I want I wanted to read you this portion of a message called believest thou this and brother brandom made this statement and it's a little bit few um paragraphs but I think this will help us and so we'll go ahead and read this it says now when Jesus said to the tree in Mark 11:23 no man eateth from thee from henceforth he might not have yelled it out why as frankly he was so easy about it till his disciples just I think one of them heard him and it when when that epileptic when it came up before the Lord Jesus the boy had the hardest fit he ever had perhaps fell on the ground like he was dead but he realized that he met someone who had Faith far above those Apostles now I like for someone that didn't believe in Divine Healing to watch this Jesus had given them power to cast out to cast the spirit out the spirits out and they had failed not the power had failed but they had failed Jesus told them why couldn't we cast them out he said because of your unbelief the church still has a power God has never taken the power from the church but the church don't have enough Faith to act upon it yes that's all it's just that simple we try to make it so complic licated sometimes but the more simple you make the gospel the more reality you'll have amen oh I love that that's medicine amen that's right when you just get real simple with it God said so and that settles it that's all and just believe it and go ahead when Jesus said no man eat from thee why the leaves were still pretty bright and as they ever was the bark looked the same but why way down in the ground in those roots the life begin to dwindle away so it is upon a cancer or upon any kind of disease that that you might want to think when you can accept the word of God way down in The Roots the cancer may be there your hand may be just as stiff it don't have anything to do with Divine Healing if you can't believe see way down somewhere it's already done the work it's already gone to work yes sir amen Jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you can have what you say isn't that lovely who' who'd that come from the Son of God whose words Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word won't now the only way that you can do that now this is important now the only way that you can do that is you've got to have the right objective and the right motive now if I want now if I went out here and said I'll show you I can move this mountain be moved Mountain it will never move certainly not no matter what I had it's got to be first you got to find the will of God God and that's the reason usually in the prayer lines it gets very hard and because sometimes that's went through the lines and so forth and we're we get it back you see if you've gotten confess sin did you ever notice on a Case before I asked the evil spirit to leave I watch the case real sure to be certain that there's nothing in the life that would hinder anything see because remember all these gifts you can get in trouble with them you know I just think that's that's a cautionary thing you know just to let our Christian experience be from the heart you know we have things we want from God we're making our requests known but if there's things in our heart let's deal with that first amen if you don't doubt in your heart you can ask whatsoever you may have amen continuing there it says God you remember one time gave a prophet made the prophet out of a man Moses and told him to go down and speak to the Rock and that Prophet was all excited and he went out and smote The Rock speaking of the weakness of Christ that he had to Die the second time and Smit it the second time he had power to bring it but it wasn't the will of God I never could believe that it was God's will that Elijah would go around and cause them children was teasing him about being baldheaded I don't think he should have done it but he was a prophet and he was angry and he put a curse on those children and those two she bears in killed 42 little innocent children but I don't believe he should have done it and it just before we put his power in his church he tries his church to see what it'll do oh I love it you know you know that when you're going through a trial you know that's the hand of God to a son or daughter of God Amen so so if you're not in a trial right now and you're a Son of God hello somebody it's coming it's coming God tries his church to see what it'll do you have the power and sometimes God's waned to give you this Faith but now what he wants is to see a character that reflects his character is this your will we know if it's his will we can have confidence that we can have it now this is mine but if if you'll just speak the word and say Lord I believe it don't doubt mean it in your heart now say for instance I was in a valley and I don't I'm preaching to millions of people but just across the mountain here is a group of people of 100 and they are dying without Christ well I've got a million here to preach to but yet something in my heart's telling me get across to those people get to them they're perishing I don't want to go myself but yet there's something in me is there something in you now listen to the reasoning the rational you you the devil's got his narrative to you why not to do what's in your heart see that's when God moving see what the objective is see what your motive is of going not for self now if I say well if my objective is right and get over there but then I get there and there's this big mountain I say if you know if I get over that mountain and save all those hundred people someday they'll have a statue there brother brand I'm a great missionary now my motive is not right that Mo that mountain won't fall no sir but when my motive and objective is right and God in my heart is leading me I can't get over the mountain around the mountain Under the Mountain I say mountain move amen maybe it when when I said when I say that no more than I say it with all the kinds of the right Spirit leading of the holy spirit in the will of God there might not be but one little spoonful of that mountain drop down but it's on its Road the next day there might be two pounds fall the next day a quarter of a ton and then maybe in a month five tons drop in what of it may not even see it yet but she's moving it's on the road it'll stay right there and watch the thing be done because God said so and that just settles it can you think that about your mother here tonight all right if you'll think it she'll get well all right that's if you just believe just speak the word and say stay with it just believe it hang on to it it's eternal life I think that's so special you know I I love it how he says that you know and and I don't want to just put this back and say you know brother Brandon was talking to them but I believe the Lord's talking to us we all have mothers here you know he says can you think that about your mother here tonight how many has a know that your mother has a need tonight I know my mother has a need you know and I'll say this about you know I was I was going out to to you know in my heart I wanted to do the will of the Lord I wanted it to be you know because I believe God's the god of restoration but I wasn't trying to figure out what the outcome was going to be in all that I just simply had it on my heart and I know that when God works by the heart he's got miraculous things that are going to happen and so when I came back and I I was able to to talk to my mom and little did I know I was sharing with her that I was able to go and the whole family was able to meet my dad and and uh some of the you know I really believe that it broke bondage off my mom and it was one of those unforeseen blessings and so I wanted to say that and and to say this you know when you are obedient to the word of God when he tugs on your heart to do something in doing it there is people that will see it it'll bring a light and it'll bring Deliverance so don't just think that Deliverance comes when people come up to be prayed for on the altar or if they jump in the service and there's Victory but when you do the will of God when you know to do the will of God and you do it it can bring Deliverance for those who are watching you that's right you're the individual that God wants to bring to pass this word of God Amen you believe it you spoke it by his stripes I'm Healed you hold hold on to the Word of Promise cuzz God can't fail he can't lie he he's it's on the road you might have only seen a drop of sand fall from that mountain maybe you even haven't seen that much but God can't lie even greater a miracle Our Father Abraham he Sarah you feel any different no God's still more than able we don't want to lower our sights based on circumstance amen praise the Lord I don't know how long I've been but trust that the Lord's blessing you Sunday night praise the Lord is God good bring the rain it was in my heart too I'm like Lord the farmers my they they want us to eat out of tubes and paste and we need some we need some rain praise the Lord you know if we can just go back to Mark 11 here I'll just try to close up but you know it that scripture just really struck me and if if I could share what the Lord put on my heart about that scripture I just thought you know we want to be like like whatever you say whosoever shall say and it be from the heart of faith brother Brandon preached a message I believe it was called believe from the heart and within that he gave testimony about when the lord gave the vision about the Woods Brothers and how they were to go out and one day they were going to it was going to be nothing no fishing you know and and and then the next day they were going to get all of these catfish they were going to cat and and these were Jehovah's Witness right and so you know it it was the leading of the Lord you know and so as they were out there fishing and you know they came to that spot where I I believe I don't know if it was Banks but one of the boys they they pulled the the fish out too hard and it pulled out all of his um inro and and all of a sudden the one said oh you shot your last wad that was it for him and so as they were talking and testifying one of the one of the boys you know he just said you know I you know it would be so good you know that that that woman that used to care for us when we were little for her to know that we're serving God now and and brother brandham said that word found favor with God hallelujah that word them thinking of somebody else somebody that impacted their lives when they were a young person if they I want to I want someone else to know the power of God that has transformed this life you know I was like I was like a tree that couldn't bear the fruit what was in my heart right but one day one day God overshadowed that seed brought it to life and it was through testimony amen we're Witnesses of his majesty and so I just thought you know that brother brandham said that that kind of it brought an atmosphere that the word could drop on brother brandom's heart and he can speak yes that's what we want to do we know that we've been spoken over that we're living in an hour of the third pool you know squirrels manifested right but I I I so thank God that you know God's ways of doing that are so far beyond our ability to comprehend it has to be a revelation you know and even another place I believe brother Brandon was saying you know about telling those those men they were oil guys and he said hey there's the gushard it's over there and they they failed to act on it right then how many times do do we fail to act on just the Simplicity of God's present if you would just take it take your opportunity God wants to fulfill it and so then they ask later hey he goes it doesn't work like that see I couldn't have confidence in God to ask him to show me where the oil gusher is because it would not be it would be the wrong motive I don't have need of it but what do you have need tonight what is your need you know I'll say this I'm I'm just going to you know as as we read the scripture and try to find a close you know it said there it says um and on the tomorrow when they had come to Bethany they were hungry and seeing a fig tree of far off with the leaves he came and happily that he might find anything that there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it let no man eat of thee Hereafter and forever and his disciples heard it you know to think that God would use the power to curse the fig tree and it wasn't even in season you know and that's another expression of the power the spoken word you know and I I just believe sometimes we don't realize the presence of the Lord in our lives when we start talking to people or even talking to one another we have power in our words and and just think you know he he cursed this fig tree you know and and we have the word of God that in our situations you know I don't want to Lord help me me I don't want to be a complainer I don't want to be some crabby old guy that sees the world and the way it is and all the oppression but I want God to overshadow me for somebody else that I can speak the word of God if I'm going to curse something let me curse the devil and the works that he has over the people that I love you know it's it's already been proven you know that we've been commissioned go into all the world you shall cast out Devils you know and God uses individuals so praise the Lord You're that individual yes let's not wait on somebody else to do it let's look for our opportunity amen praise the lord well why don't we stand together you know as brother Billy was preaching this morning and I certainly appreciate that so much really I think it just dealt with me in another way and I'll share this as we close but you know as as we read this I want you to ponder somebody that's in your world that you want to see you know if there's bondage in someone else's life and we're we're Kings and Priests you know and if if pre-venture God in this night would give you power by what you say and and you're you're called of God for this now now you think about that person as we read the scripture that person that's under the oppression of the enemy and you want to curse that thing in the name of the Lord cuz you in your heart know what victory tastes like and you want somebody else to taste victory so I have somebody on my heart and he's the guy that introduced me to my wife or was part of that and it actually just so happen to be the same guy that I was with the night I got arrested How can I through the years of complication in my mind why wrestling but now I can see that God works all things together for good I just visited him this week and I so much want he he's like you're coming to me with the same thing that everybody else has but yet he hasn't seen the power of God to transform the life and so you know I would be the same as him oh you know smoking pot drinking doing carousing and all these things it's not a bad deal I would still be thinking that way if it wasn't God who's rich in Mercy you would be the same way you were ever being if it wasn't God who was rich in Mercy and it's not just to be a stuff shirt and say look see God did this for me but now we want our faith to go in action we have an opportunity tonight don't let nothing hinder don't let no reason God is here whatever you say whatsoever you say let it be from your heart and brother Billy was saying this in the scripture just really spoke to me but in he in Hebrews uh 11 and and uh verse 4 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh and how can a man or a woman be speaking from the dead that's what I want to happen tonight with every single one of your request you're dead in Christ now let God fall on you let God go to work and be that Ambassador for Christ for somebody tonight amen is that your desire whatever you say let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we thank you for your goodness to us Lord

well we're thankful to be gathered here tonight uh we got meetings coming up next week we're looking forward to what the Lord has in store for us we know that he had a predestinated moment in his mind of the things he was going to accomplish and we're just entering in with faith we ask that those things that he desires to accomplish would become real to us that our hearts could enter in and and uh anticipate the burden that will be on The Minister's heart to be in prayer because we know that we're needy people and we have need of the lord we can't do anything without him if he doesn't come and perform what only he can perform then it'll just be the works of man nothing could come of it and we're just asking him to have his complete will and way in the services to come um it's important that each of us sanctify Our lives our hearts our minds and consecrate ourselves because we don't want anything to hinder the moving of the lord we want to reverence his Sanctuary set this aside as a place of worship where we know that he comes deals with hearts changes lives delivers us from the things that would afflict us and we're going to give him the praise and the glory for those things yeah it's that plus 12 was just yeah I it was feedback yeah because you had it was so wide open just at the mic which was that was a new challenge um you know what can you do something for me start to I don't have the tablet but just start to give me monitor like uh maybe turn the house down completely the house completely off and then just start to turn up number one until you until you can hear it um so I'm on the lapel and we're just G to well when I say one Ox one yeah so on Ox one just start to turn up number two until we and it's like man it ain't nothing happening uh so we're on number two so um I can just start to hear myself now I think if I was to have instruments just a little louder so where you're at right there would be I think a good level for monitor like no and no feedback and this should be so that level right here I can hear myself now I do think potentially we may have a PO a par polarity thing because I feel like I'm getting like that speaker could be on a because it almost feels like I'm noise cancelling between these but this is great I think this is great o that doesn't sound good at all um well it's probably looping can you hear that that's the feedback it's actually catching feedback but it's not squealing so that's oh you can't it's it's happening up here but I think it's self that it's self-limiting or something here sounds great but when you get too close to the speaker and that's what I mean I think it's that noise cancelling effect I it's something there's something weird yeah might as well wait hold on I'm wondering if it's just if that speaker done blue I I sure hope not well I'll tell you what come up here and listen to the speaker with me not on the microphone like I don't know if it's because I'm getting close or if it really sounds that way so if it really sounds that way that's horrible they they should both be on but tell me if that doesn't sound like real like tin foil like that you know if that's really the way that speaker sound then it's done blown or something can you is it is it sounding that way or is it pretty clear just clear right no it sounds hot it's like overloaded yeah there's definitely a lot of settings on there that's all it is we just got well if it is you're going to have to send it more volume which is fine send it more volume here so it does sound good down here it does see I'm telling you it's a noise cancelling thing sounds perfect it's crystal clear right here see that's I think there's a I think there's so if your head's right here it's weird yeah because you're in a spot where you're not catching That acoustic you see what I'm saying it's an acoustic cancellation then I think it's the I think
