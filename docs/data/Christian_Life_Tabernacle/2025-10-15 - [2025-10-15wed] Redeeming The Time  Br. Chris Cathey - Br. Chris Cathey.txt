Praise God. My sins are gone. Hallelujah. We'll ask sister Haley to come and bring her special [Music] testimony because he really does care and I've witnessed it. [Music] Life lets you down and you feel more broken than whole. When the wounds go deeper than words and you can't tell a soul. I may not know what you're going through. May not can make that high mountain move. But one thing I found that I really want you to know, if it matters to you, it matters to the master. He wants to share the burdens you bear. Whisper peace when your world gets shattered. If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer. If it matters to you, [Music] it matters to the master. [Music] Friend, do you think the maker and giver of life [Music] is far too busy to care about your struggle and trials? He sees the sparrow that falls to the ground. And he hears those tears that don't make a sound. If you only knew how precious you are in his sight. [Music] If it matters to you, it matters to the master. [Music] He wants to share the burdens you bear. Whisper peace when your world gets shattered. If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer, if it matters to you, it matters to the master. If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain or you're really needing an answer, if it matters to you, &gt;&gt; it doesn't only matter to you. &gt;&gt; If it matters to you, [Music] It matters to the master. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How many knows that to be the truth? &gt;&gt; If it matters to you, it matters to him. Just got an announcement here. There will be a brother's breakfast this Saturday in the fellowship hall from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Brother David Kaku writes for brother Jose Martinez in need of assistance from God in his court case. We just heard a song that says, "If it matters to you, it matters to the master." If you've come into the house of the Lord with a request upon your heart and you want to make it known to him by the uplifting of your hands, do so knowing that he is the answer. We'll ask brother Tim to come and pray for these and may the brothers are taking the tithes and offerings. Please come. Welcome to the house of the Lord. We sang the song, I feel like traveling on. Even if you don't feel like it, we're still traveling on. Pray the Lord will give you the strength tonight. Gracious and kind heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, once again for gathering us together, this part of the sheepfold, Lord, that you can bind our hearts together in faith, believing for these requests. Lord, that we put before you, Lord. Those that are unspoken, shown by the uplifted hand or on the hearts of your people, Lord, we just heard the the song sung, Lord. If it matters to us, it matters to you. Lord, there's things that burden us, Lord. We have compassion. We have feelings. We have needs, Lord. So, we want you to consider them all, Lord. Answer as you'd see fit according to your word and your will, Lord. But Lord, you said if we ask believing, bind our hearts together, any two or three agree together on any one thing, that you would do it. And we know, Lord, when you said those things, you were behind closed doors with your disciples. Those that weren't servants on the outside, but they were your friends. They were your followers. They were near and dear to you, Lord. That's where we place ourselves tonight, Lord. Your children. We come as children seeking leadership and guidance from a heavenly father. one that knows what's ahead. We recall how you asked Peter, if he loved you. [Music] Peter answered, &gt;&gt; "Lord, you know I love you." &gt;&gt; And you asked him two more times. That wasn't for reassurance for you, Lord, but that was to ensure that Peter knew he had a savior. And you told him how he would be dying for that savior. Lord, we we take up our cross willingly. Lord, there's there's struggles, but we know that the race has already been won. Lord, I pray that tonight we can have that victory. We can have that faith to overcome. Lord, grant it to us when we hear the preaching of the word. Lord, we can we can lay our faith there and bind our hearts together and say, "That's the truth." And see these requests come to pass in our lives, Lord. But it's by your word that you accomplish all things. Lord, we thank you for our already answered prayer for the needs that have been met. Lord, there's many more. We just pray that you'd answer them all. Bless the tithes and offerings, Lord, in this little service tonight, Lord. May we just be on the edge of our seat. Be listening for that portion of the word that's individually for each one of us, Lord, because we all come here for something. And you're going to satisfy that hunger. So grant it to us now, Lord, as we lift you up, magnify your name. We ask all these things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Power of your love. Lord, I come to you. Let my heart be changed. Renew, flowing from the grace that I found in you, Lord. and Lord I've come to Lord the weaknesses I see in me will be stripped away [Music] by the power of your love and holy glory [Music] behind [Music] me.

You just hold that before the Lord as we want to sing Amazing Grace as we introduce our brother and just relax and let the spirit move on your heart and do the inside work. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this as we invite our brother to come and have his liberty to speak the words of life. &gt;&gt; You just pull on the gift and &gt;&gt; just get what you need cuz we're in a late hour.

We just wanted to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And uh just an honor to be here. Honored to be amongst the bride of Christ tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm just thankful to know the truth. And you know, God's by his sovereign grace has chose us from the foundation of the world. And we just realized he just one day came by your house, came by your place. And I tell you, if you don't know him in a real way, get to know him in a real way. &gt;&gt; Our God, I just so thankful to know him in a real way. So may God bless you. You may be seated just for a moment. Um, I just wanted to tell you, want to thank brother David for having me and uh, it's just good to be here today. So, we just want to tell you, God bless you. We're from uh Campbellville, Kentucky. And uh we were we kind of brought up in in the um the Jeffersonville area for 11 years. And now I'm down with brother Larry Hera in Campbellville, Kentucky now. And uh we're just trying to serve the Lord the best we can. And uh we just love the Lord with all our heart. Again, brother David, I just I love him and uh his sons and known them for many years. And uh but uh just just telling you I just I love the Lord. I love this message with all my heart. Um but as we go to the word today um we just uh we just go to prayer right now. Father, we just come before your throne tonight. Father, we come to hear from you. Not from a man, but Father, may you speak through this mortal clay tonight. And God, may you just only speak what you would have to speak. Father, may you just come down in a special way. May you calm our spirits. Father, may you come through every aisle. Father, may you touch the sick. Father, whatever the needs are tonight, may you just come down in a mighty way tonight. We just love you, God. We thank you for your many blessings. And Father, we'll give you the praise, the glory, and honor in Jesus name. Amen. Just want to turn tonight to Ephesians. This really has been on my heart. and um I pray it's a blessing and uh was just in the back praying talking to your song leader and and uh just great confirmation from the Lord. So I pray it's a blessing tonight. But uh we'll turn to Ephesians. May we stand for the reading of God's word as we stand for the flag. But there's nothing better to stand for the reading of God's word. So Ephesians chapter 5. I'll give you a minute to get there. Ephesians 5. Ephesians 5. It starts off with he says it says be ye therefore followers of God &gt;&gt; as dear children. It says and walk in love. And it says as Christ also hath loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice. And it goes on verse still in verse two. And it goes on, giving us a sacrifice to God for the sweet smelling savior. Verse three, it goes on to say, but for uh it says right here, sorry, let me get to the next slide. It says, but fornication and all uncleanliness uh neither filthy uh uncleanliness, let it not be once named among you as become it saints. Verse four, neither filthiness nor foolish. Uh uh it says nor foolish nor justesting which are not covenant but rather giving of thanks. Verse five, for this you know that no mooreer nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolattor hath any inheritance in the kingdom of God. Uh verse six uh it goes on to say I just want to get to this tonight. Um verse verse six he said let no man deceive you with vain words for because of this cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience but ye but not ye therefore partakers within for ye were sometimes in darkness but now you are the light in the world. Walk as children of the light. May God bless you. May be seated. And I was just reading this as I was sitting in there uh flying over here and I was reading in the hotel. I I really like where verse eight says, "For ye were sometimes darkness." Aren't you thankful that God in a dark dark world we live in today? &gt;&gt; That we were always sometimes darkness. But here we are sitting in today 2000 2025. Who would think we would still be here? &gt;&gt; But we're living in a dark age. We're living in a very dark time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're We're living in a time that you got to stand up for what's right. &gt;&gt; You got to not just quote a book or carry carry uh carry the book around or or the the message apps on your phone, but we but we live in a time that people really want to see uh God uh uh God with 10 on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh we live in a time that that that that we live in darkness that people on your your job, they they they you you could tell them all the quotes, but they want to see a life that lives behind the name. &gt;&gt; We live in a time that that we we we really want to see Jesus with skin on it. &gt;&gt; That you're the only feet tonight. You're the only mouth that that he has to use. And he's called you out for a reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as verse 9 says, it goes on to say, "But for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth." And I'm just building up to this tonight. Verse 10 says, "Proving that what what is acceptable unto the Lord." And it says verse 10 or verse 11, "And having no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness, but rather approve, reprove," another word means expose them. Verse 12. For it is a shame even to speak to those things which are done in them and speaker it, but in all things that are approved reproved are made manifest by the light. So, so what what I'm what I want to say tonight and bring it down to more of a more of a maybe a kindergarten education tonight. But you know when the light exposes the darkness, the the just a little bit of light and you can have a flashlight and you just have maybe just one battery, a couple batteries in there and you it's very weak, but it's still powerful in the presence of darkness. &gt;&gt; So I don't care where you stand tonight, where your next your neighbor to your left or your right is or how long you've been in the message. You've been in it two weeks. Just be a light for Jesus Christ. just be a light for the one that gave you the truth and the revelation. &gt;&gt; But it goes on to say, he says, "But uh for darkness, verse 12, for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of in secret, but in all things are reproved or made manifest by the light. For whosoever doeth make manifest is the light." But I like really what this says. It says, "But therefore," now listen to this. Wherefore, verse 14, he saith, this is the Lord speaking. He said, Wherefore he saith, Awake thou sleepest, &gt;&gt; and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thy light. &gt;&gt; We live in a day of a time that we should be not sleeping. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ, we're right here at the climax of the time. It's time to wake up, Brad. It's time to rise up. I'm here to tell you tonight to wake up and realize the time we're living in. &gt;&gt; The young people, it's a time to realize and say, "Hey, the light is coming in my day." But what are we doing with the light? &gt;&gt; What are we where are we at? We should be at a higher level in in the time we live in. God has g opened the entire book from Genesis to Revelation. People have carried the message of the hour 30 years and 50 years. But what are you doing with the lights? But it goes on to say here, it says in verse 15, "See then that we walk circumstantially not as fools but as wise." &gt;&gt; It says, "Redeeming the time because the days are evil." &gt;&gt; So tonight, I just want to speak a few minutes on redeeming the time. &gt;&gt; We live in a time that is a very fast fastpaced time. You know, when we flew into Dallas, it's a lot far a lot a lot faster than Louisville, Kentucky or even Campbellville. We moved to Campbellville and there's 28,000 people and it feels like people are crawling and walking and barely moving. But you come to Dallas and it's 100 miles an hour. And I believe that's when our spiritual walk, the devil wants to keep you busy in other things. He wants to keep you busy in not reading your Bible. He wants to keep you busy in not praying. He wants to keep you busy in everything else on your iPad and in Facebook and Instagram. But we got to redeem the time back that the devil tries to steal from you tonight. &gt;&gt; We live in a fast-paced time. And I was telling someone the other day, you know what? Busy stands for the devil wants to put so much thing on us. Oh, we can work a little bit more. But I'm here to tell you, when the church doors are open, you should be in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; When in church the the pastor studied all day and he's made himself ready, we should become prayed up. &gt;&gt; We should come pull on the word and say, "Hey, I'm coming to get a piece. I'm coming to hear from Jesus Christ tonight." &gt;&gt; And I've changed the way I've thought over the years and recently of studying is even if I'm not speaking, I want to come for a fill up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Too many times we pass the How many times you pass a gas station and your lights on and you're like, "Hey, I got five miles. I've done it plenty of times." And you get to the gas station, you come up to a gas. I can make it a little bit more. &gt;&gt; I can make it a little bit more. &gt;&gt; I got My wife's like, "Chris, would you please stop? We're going to run out of gas. &gt;&gt; But have you ran out of a spiritual tank tonight? Have you filled up lately? &gt;&gt; Have you gotten to a place in your life that you want to take back the time where the devil is stealing from us? We live in a fast-paced world where it's this or that or we're on our iPad or we're on Facebook. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we live in a time that we should redeem the time because the days are evil. &gt;&gt; Another word redeeming the time. comes from the Greek word and it says extrao it said which means to buy or purchase up or rescue from the lost it's I like what the prophet of God says he says and brethren we have drawn little circles of laws and different things and we've never we we still never come to the real colonel he said it's Jesus Christ the love of God the God that God wants us to see he said what pity. He said, "Love is the greatest, most powerful weapon that this world has ever seen &gt;&gt; or known of." He said, "It's a dying." It's a It's dying for love. &gt;&gt; He said the church is perishing for love. He says, "The love of God's waters of grace to flow one to another with confidence is restored when the justice is restored between us. The love of God that's shared abroad in our hearts by the denomination. Something sounded wrong there, didn't it? He said, "The love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; God's loved us. And as I read that scripture, as I read the first scripture in verse Ephesians 2, it says, "But walk in love as Christ also loved us and he gave himself up to us." I'm talking about a true agapo love. I'm not talking about a filial love. I'm talking about a true love that Jesus Christ paid it all. He paid everything. And and we had a prophet in our day point us back to Jesus Christ. And he showed us the real revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I like to say he says, "Walk in love." I tell you, too many times we we we we as as a message believer, we got this quote and we got this or hey, let me throw this at you. But no, we need to pull on some love on some people tonight. And just put your hand to the right or to your left. Maybe they're not where you're supposed to be. Maybe the there's a youth tonight not where they're supposed to be. But hey, give them grace. He gave you grace. &gt;&gt; It's all in Jesus Christ timing. It's it's it's redeeming the time. But but it but maybe the one to your right maybe take a little bit longer than you. &gt;&gt; But he's still working on us. every single day he's working on us. He's preparing us. As you get in your word, as you listen to these tapes, he's preparing you. He's He's forming you into his image &gt;&gt; every single day. &gt;&gt; I like that. He says, "Walk in love." As Romans 5:8 says, "But but God commanded his love towards us. While ye yet were sinners, &gt;&gt; Christ died for us." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when you were stuck in the in the maybe the ballroom tonight. Maybe you can say, "Brother Chris, I was stuck in the gutter here or maybe I was in this denomination. I was here or wherever. But while you yet were sinners, Christ died for you tonight." That's something that should be like, "Praise God. &gt;&gt; He's gave me something to be happy about tonight." Oh, I tell you, I'm tired of seeing so many believers walk around with frowns on your face because we should be living at a level and say, "When I get up in the morning, old devil, I'm coming after you." &gt;&gt; You might not know me tonight, but I'm telling you, I wake up that way. My wife's like, "Bro, guys, honey, can I just get a cup of coffee in before you get to going?" But I'm I'm not living off coffee tonight. I'm not living off things of the world tonight. I'm living on the mana from God. &gt;&gt; I'm living on a message of the hour that's alive. &gt;&gt; I'm living in a Bible that has become a new book. &gt;&gt; 21 years ago, the Bible became a new book and it lives on the inside. What about you? &gt;&gt; What about you tonight? But God commanded his love towards us. While we were yet sinners, I hope it sinks in tonight. Christ died for you. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; The innocent one the I mean, think about Jesus Christ. What he did for you tonight. That one scripture should be enough for you to wake up every morning and say, "Yeah, why I was a sinner. He He had mercy that I didn't die in a car wreck. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he didn't take my child or did this. He he he gave me enough grace in redeeming the time that once maybe you were in the car and you said, "Lord, come in my heart. It don't have to be in the pew." &gt;&gt; Maybe it was on your job. Maybe someone witnessed to you about the message of the hour and you said, you know, that that's the truth. That I'm like Hattie, right? That's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you a little testimony. I came in, maybe you don't know me tonight, but I came up in a home, a very broke up home. And I'm here to tell you tonight, if you come up in a broke up home, he can bring, he can give you a home that will never be broken. &gt;&gt; I came in a home that didn't have love that that that was about drugs and this and uh drinking and all this. But I'm here to tell you, but when I heard the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; I I always tell everybody, I'm a CEO Christian. And I used to be Christmas, Easter, and other holidays. That's when we came to church. Christmas, Easter, and other holidays. But I'm here to tell you, it doesn't have to be a holiday anymore for me. &gt;&gt; On a Wednesday night, on a Sunday morning, on a Sunday night, I want to go praise Jesus. &gt;&gt; And it's an every single day. &gt;&gt; And I'm not just saying it's just when the doors are open. It's a daily walk with Jesus Christ. He's wanting the the fellowship was broke in the garden, but Jesus Christ redeemed us &gt;&gt; and he's brought back the fellowship on Calvary and he wants you to be a personal say, "Lord, I just want to speak to you today." &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about making him a checklist, saying, "God, do this, do that." When's the last time you said, "Lord, I just want to tell you I love you." When's the last time you said, "Lord, I just want to spend as much time as I do on Facebook with you." &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to me tonight, too. When's the last time we could get off a chat room or or this or that or or the devil likes to keep us busy? &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about time tonight. Redeeming the time. The devil wants to keep our young people so busy. I'm seeing it everywhere. so bombarded with this and that and things of the world. And it might be a great chat room. It might be a Christian chat room, but that's all you do is just chat back and forth. Did you hear this? Did you hear that? Did you hear this? &gt;&gt; When you could just pick up your Bible and say, "Lord, I just want to fall more in love with you. &gt;&gt; I'm just here to tell you we're living in an evil day. We're living in a late hour. And if you just hear the message tonight, we're living in it says to redeem the time because we're living in the evil day. I'll read that again. Wherefore he saith verse 14, awake thou sleepest and arise from the dead as Christ shall give thy light. See that we walk circumstant not as fools but as wise but redeem in the time because the days are evil. I would say we're here. &gt;&gt; I would say we're we're we're we're almost I would say we're pretty much in gross darkness. We're living in a grace period right now. We're living in a time that it's time to take back what the devil stole from you. &gt;&gt; We're living in a time where your your family's on the edge and maybe maybe your home's about to be broke up and maybe your kids want to see you read the Bible. Maybe your grandchildren want to see you get on your knees and pray. Because you can share them all the quotes in the world, but I tell you what, they just want you to fall in love with the master. &gt;&gt; My kids could care less if I read them a quote unquote quote after quote, but if daddy ain't living the life and say, "Lord, I just pour the love of Christ on them." Oh, they want a real a real man of God or one that will pull his britches up and say, "Son, we but we we're going to read the Bible as a family." &gt;&gt; Too many times the devil keeps us in a time of busyness and distractions on every corner. &gt;&gt; Every time you get on something, a little ad, you could be on the internet and the ad's after you. It's chasing you. Or you can look up uh if you're looking to buy something, it will chase you all day. &gt;&gt; I mean, am I right? It it'll chase you all day. You look up a a certain gun, that gun will follow you all day. &gt;&gt; It'll say buy here and buy there, and before you know it, you're in a web. And that's why it's called the worldwide web. Because the devil wants to web you in his time. &gt;&gt; He wants to steal your God's time. But I'm here to tell you and us as the bride of Christ should redeem back our time &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I want to spend more time with you. I want to read the Bible more. I don't care what age you are. I want to love you more, Lord." &gt;&gt; He'll take whatever place you give him. &gt;&gt; But he wants first place. &gt;&gt; He wants first place. Trust me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful for God tonight. In verse 17 of Ephesians 5, it says, "Wherefore be not one wise, but understanding with what will of the Lord is, and be not drunk with wine, where in the excess be filled with the spirits. Speak unto yourselves in psalms and hymns." I love this. In spiritual songs, singing making melody unto the Lord to the heart to the Lord. And I thought about this scripture uh for the youth. Sometimes they get caught up in a time where the devil they could listen to a spiritual song tonight. Taylor Swift ain't a spiritual song. &gt;&gt; We're living in a time where we listen to somebody and they sing two spiritual songs and the rest of it is trash. &gt;&gt; I don't know who I'm speaking to tonight, but I'm just here to tell you that's what the I don't have in my notes, but but I'm here to tell you watch what you're listening to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your ears are not garbage cans tonight. You are the bride of Christ. He's called you out for a reason. &gt;&gt; You're living at a time where where where you you I'm telling you, I see it. Youth will come through prayer lines after prayer lines &gt;&gt; and the spirit of different music. I don't know why I'm going down this, but they but it comes to these young people and it just bombs bars them because maybe their dad don't love them like they should. Maybe the mama's too busy to do this and do that and they just want a little bit of love, &gt;&gt; but we're not redeeming the time. And the devil will, if you don't show them time, the devil will give them time. &gt;&gt; We live in a time that the devil will bombard you with with things and busyiness. And I wrote this down one time. I put, you know what stands for? Being under Satan's yoke. We live in a time where we're being under Satan's yoke. As verse uh 19 says, speaking there in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing a melody unto the in your heart to the Lord. Verse 20 it says, giving thanks always for all things unto God and to the father in the name of I tell you what, giving thanks always, even in your trials, &gt;&gt; even when the bank account's low. Come on. &gt;&gt; Even when you know your bank account shows almost zero, saying, "Lord, I'll still serve you." &gt;&gt; There's been plenty of times my bank account's been low. And I'm telling you, two days later, I don't know where a check comes in the mouth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he's the one that pays your paychecks. &gt;&gt; He's the one that gave you breath tonight. &gt;&gt; But giving thanks always, that's hard to do when you're in a battle. Maybe you come in tonight. You're like, "Brother Chris, I'm in a battle, but give him thanks." &gt;&gt; Give him thanks tonight. Say, "Lord, I might be in a battle, but tell your storm who your God is." &gt;&gt; Start telling your storm who your God is. &gt;&gt; But it says, "Sement yourselves one to another in fear of God." I like this one translation. You probably don't have it, but verse one. This is just Ephesians 1. It says, "Be imitators of God in everything you do." &gt;&gt; It said, "For then you will represent your father as a beloved sons and daughters. Continue to walk surrendered to a extravagant love of Christ." And I'm here to tell you young people, maybe I'll just share it, maybe to encourage you. I grew up in a home that was very broke up. I grew up in a home that didn't know Christ. But one day, I was handed two message tapes. I was leaving for the military hand and why you're not a denomination Jezebel religion and then I started studying. I tell you we don't live off your family's coattails. &gt;&gt; Don't live off because your daddy believes the message. You let the message get on the inside of you. You let the Bible become a new book &gt;&gt; and then you fall in love with the author. &gt;&gt; And I'm just speaking from experience. I just went to church and I just, you know, sometimes I feel like even in the message church, it's just a routine. &gt;&gt; It's just another Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; It's just another Sunday. But no, every time we meet is the divine appointment from Jesus. &gt;&gt; Maybe it be in your home or wherever it's at. Maybe it's at your kitchen table and you grab your family's hands and you starting to just read the Bible. Maybe it's one scripture, but it's a divine appointment &gt;&gt; that you can say, "God, speak to my kids tonight. Speak to me, Lord." &gt;&gt; But I like that said, "Be imitators of God in everything you do." But I grew up in a home that was very broke up that didn't have love. And I started looking for love in other places. I started filling my time up because daddy didn't show me love. So, I went looking for love. I'm just being real with you tonight. &gt;&gt; I went looking for love. I looked here. I looked there. I did the drinking. I thought that would be good love. &gt;&gt; And I realized the devil will fill you with with with sorrow and things of this world that ain't it's just emptiness. &gt;&gt; And he'll put you on the side of the street somewhere and he'll laugh at you. Young people. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm here to tell you young girls, you stay pure. You look beautiful with long hair. &gt;&gt; You look beautiful without all this makeup on. &gt;&gt; The world won't tell you that. But I'm here to tell you that's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Your mirror tonight is not the world. Your Bible, the mirror of your life should be the word of God. &gt;&gt; Whatever the word says, you follow it. &gt;&gt; If he says you're beautiful, then you're beautiful. But I got caught up in this and I got caught up in this and and before you know it, it was up in a big old web. &gt;&gt; And he started sucking up my time. And before I left for the military, my grandmother had me two message books and I started to research why I believe what I believe. And then I started looking at the water baptism. And then I started going down the path. And then I went down and I I hope this is okay tonight, but I'm just being real with you tonight. And then I started researching why I believe what I believe. And then I realized I've been so I've been God the whole time I just lived off my dad was a Baptist and I believe it this way. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you even in the message churches today get a real revelation of why you believe what you believe. People are leaving by left and right because they never researched it for themselves. &gt;&gt; And there's not another message today. There's not another one that's took their uh uh Jesus Christ has took a picture with our prophet. &gt;&gt; I never forget when I came in the message. I told my mom, I said, "Get in the car." She said, "Where are we going?" I said, "We're going to the Smithsonian. I'm going to find this picture." She said, "What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? I said, "Yeah." I said, "I found the truth, Brother Andrew. &gt;&gt; I found the truth." I said, "I want more of it." &gt;&gt; And 25 25 years ago today, I'm still on fire for God. I still love the truth. I still love the message. &gt;&gt; I still love the Bible. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "Well, you worship a man." No, I worship the God in that man. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, he just pointed you to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, you should be thankful that he put the bicep on you tonight and has gave you the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He's opened your revelation. &gt;&gt; But we walk around here going, "Brother Chris, I I just can't make it. I uh Brother Andrew, I'm so sorry." Every day, you ever been around somebody that's everything is negative? That's right. &gt;&gt; You ever been on the phone with somebody and every word out of their mouth is negative? Here they come and you're like, "Oh, I'm going this way. I'm going this way." &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, everything in Christ is just positive. &gt;&gt; Even your trials you're going through tonight are positive. &gt;&gt; It's shaping you. It's molding you into the person God wants you to be. &gt;&gt; As the word of God says, it's more precious than gold. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's hard to say when you're going through a deep trial. I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; that's very hard when the bank account's low. It's easy to serve him when the bank account's a lot in it. &gt;&gt; But what about when you don't have a whole lot and you say, "You know what? I ain't got $5. I'm going to give it all to God." &gt;&gt; When you just put it in the pot and say, and watch him multiply it. &gt;&gt; I've done it many of times where I'll go just double check. I'm just being honest. I'll pull Hey, brother Andrew. I'll pull out $100. Well, &gt;&gt; and the next week I'll get 600 and $800 and $1,000 &gt;&gt; because that's our God. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you to step out by faith and say, "Lord, I redeem my time back. &gt;&gt; I redeem my time." We live in a time where it's just fastpaced, fastpaced every single day. But I grew up in a home that didn't know nothing about God. And when I started realizing and seeing water baptism and I got out of the Baptist church and I went into the military, I hope this was okay. But when I went into the military, I started realizing how much time how how much time we have in our life. And as I've got older, I'm here 43 years old and I realized time is precious. And God only gives you aotted time. &gt;&gt; Every single of you tonight are having an allotted time, appointed time to meet Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's either heaven or hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no in between. And I'm not here to give you a scared message tonight. I'm just giving you what the guard has put on my heart. But we all have an appointed time. There's kids in the hospital being born that maybe have one day, maybe have one minute, maybe have five minutes, maybe I won't be here in five minutes. Maybe I'll maybe I'll be gone tomorrow. Maybe you will be. Maybe this will be your only service. Maybe this will be your your last service. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you to to to find Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Maybe you just say, "Brother, I want the Holy Ghost." He wants to give it to you more than you want it. That's our God tonight. And I'm here to tell you that take back the time that the devil tries to fill it up with this and this Facebook and this and that. He's always trying to fill your time up. Maybe it's more work. Maybe you say, "Well, Brother Chris, if I go take this job over here, well, they'll pay me 200,000, but there's no church." &gt;&gt; That don't line up. &gt;&gt; That don't light up &gt;&gt; because guess what? It could tear your whole family apart. Don't chase them things. I tell you, I told the boys the other day, I said, "Isaac, one thing I want you to go home with, seek ye the kingdom of before I leave this earth is you seek the kingdom of God first and everything else will be added." &gt;&gt; If you could just get one thing out of this service, seek ye the kingdom of God first and everything else will be added. &gt;&gt; Seek it with your whole heart. Don't go halfway. Don't go just a little bit, but give God all you got. &gt;&gt; Give him everything you got. Say, "Lord, I'm tired of living here and I'm living here in the world. &gt;&gt; I believe the message on Wednesday and f Sunday, but people wouldn't know behind closed doors if I believe this message or I believe Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying it. I'm just here to tell you tonight, we got to take back the time. I was reading I was reading Isaiah in the hotel room. Isaiah 60 1-3. It says, "Arise, shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." &gt;&gt; Another translation said, "Rise up in splendor and be radiant for the light has drawn and Yahweh's glory now streams from you." &gt;&gt; I tell you, we live in a time that we should be the happiest people. You people should look at you today and I'm tell you people say, "Man, you're crazy. You I'm just leave me that way &gt;&gt; because the more I hear the truth and the more revelation." Brother Re says, "Pray for revelation more than anything." &gt;&gt; And it's a progression. It's it's a studying of the word. It's saying, "Lord, I want more revelation." And it's progression. &gt;&gt; You progress in the Lord every single day. But where have you been lately? Have you been praying? Have you been reading your Bible? We got everything on our apps. We got on the iPhone. We Everything is at our hands. But too many times we spend hours and hours on nonsense. When's the last time you grabbed your family like supper table and said, "You know what? Put the phones down. Put them over in the corner and redeem the time back." It flies like that. My son just got his license the other day. I'm telling you, it it literally hit me like a ton of bricks. He's already driving. I'm said, "Lord, this can't be." And before you know it, in a blink of an eye, you're 18, you're 20, you're 40, you're 60, you're 70. What are you doing for God? &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you tonight. I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you tonight to redeem the time. As the prophet of God says, I like this. He said, "This is the hour." He said, "This is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into." I say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He said, "Just before the coming of the bridegroom." He said, "Oh, the real church of the living God ought to be on fire." &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Burning with the light of the gospel, being vindicated among them." &gt;&gt; I read it again. The real church of the living God ought to be on fire. &gt;&gt; Why we got a wet blanket on us tonight? &gt;&gt; Why do we walk around all down and out, even in your trials, just praise them. &gt;&gt; God knows about your trials before you even get to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be going through a mountaintop experience. You might be in a valley tonight. But I'm here to tell you, still praise them. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I'll still praise you." &gt;&gt; If you can't lift your hands up, I'll come by and lift them up for you. &gt;&gt; Maybe the one next to you just sometimes just budge them a little bit. Say, "Hey, are you awake or did you come to sleep tonight? Redeem the time bag." He said the real church of the living God ought to be on fire. &gt;&gt; This is 1964. He said being vindicated. He said be on fire. He said rise and shine for the light has come to you. &gt;&gt; The light has come to you. &gt;&gt; He said the light of this day. Isaiah was the light of this day. Noah was the light of his day. Why? He had a word manifest. Do you had the word manifest to you? Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said in the gospel, the Bible, the word for this day is it is the light of this day. What a glorious time we're living. &gt;&gt; I say amen to that. &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk around with a frown and think about a bomb that Russia's got. You can look and say, "I got the best bomb shelter there is, &gt;&gt; Brother Chris. I got the best bomb shelter when people are going to be hiding from this and hiding for that. You're under the wings of the the Jehovah tonight. &gt;&gt; When before the first bomb drops, you could just be on the wings and say, "Lord, farewell. Farewell, sweet hour of prayer." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you tonight, if you haven't jumped on his wings, I'm here to encourage you tonight to jump on his wings and let them become reality to to you. &gt;&gt; And if you lost your first love, go find your first love. &gt;&gt; Fall back in love with the one maybe you left them on. Left you maybe wherever you left them, go find where you left them. Maybe wherever you left him, just go back and say, "Lord, I've left you." But you know what? You know the good thing about our God is he never left you. &gt;&gt; No matter how far you think God has went away from you tonight, he's in the same place saying, "Come home." &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Come home tonight. Redeem the time where there's time available." Maybe young people tonight say, "I'm going to wait till I get home to surrender to God." What about tonight? &gt;&gt; How about tonight? Say, "Lord, feel I'm not leaving this place till you fill me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; How about tonight? Don't wait till you get home. While the word's going forth, say, "Lord, that's me. &gt;&gt; That's me. I You just for one person tonight, it's worth it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was for one person that is worth it all. &gt;&gt; I thought about in time in Greek how it talks about Kronos time. And I looked that up in the Greek and that's like a time on the calendar that we measure things by. We measure by Kronos time meaning year minutes and hours and days and years. We try to measure God by that. But you can't measure God by Kronos time. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but we know we can look at Israel and we look at times and and and earthquakes and divers manners, but God is I wrote the I looked this up was interesting. He's in a chyros time with meaning appointed God's time. It says the Greek word is in God's season. It's God's appointed time. It's a divine opportunity where God acts or calls us to act in due season. I like this. said it's about perfect per purposeful time moments when heaven touches earth. &gt;&gt; Moments when heaven touches earth, &gt;&gt; I could care less. You can say, "Bro, good. I've been the message 50 years and 30 years." Maybe that's what's wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's time to wake up tonight and put a little joy in your step and say, "Lord, I want to be on fire. I want the Holy Ghost to fill me. I want him to refill me. &gt;&gt; Maybe you come in to church and I'm just barely making it. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to leave that way. &gt;&gt; You can accept your appointed time and say, "Devil, it's been long enough. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living down. I'm tired of living out." &gt;&gt; When you can say, "Young people, you know what? My daddy won't pray. I'll pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My daddy won't read the Bible. I'll read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll be the family that turns your family around and you go home in your schools. &gt;&gt; And you leave tonight and they say, "What's wrong with you, brother? &gt;&gt; I ain't never seen them act like that. &gt;&gt; If it can last 25 years, it can keep lasting. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that we don't have to keep, oh, I keep going back and forth? God will keep filling you up as much as you'll receive. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Maybe some of you are thinking tonight, "Well, I've went too far. Brother Chris, I went too far." The prophet said, "No, if that deep call to the deep, if that deep call to the deep is responding, I'm encouraging you tonight to respond to it &gt;&gt; to say, "Brother Chris, I want to respond to that. I'm tired of playing church. I'm tired of living this way. I'm tired of drinking. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, that ain't the message. Yeah, it is. We just come in here all dressed up. It's time for church. &gt;&gt; But too many times we just need to be real with God &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I want you to work on this guy." Too many times we give our time away to nonsense things. &gt;&gt; But what really matters the most is giving our time to God &gt;&gt; and saying God I want you I want you getting up get in the moment where I wake up in the morning say God what can I do for you? &gt;&gt; I get up in the morning brother David and you get up in the morning you say God I'm awake what can I do for you? You awake 24 hours. I got to sleep eight all every every single day. I got to spend eight hours sleeping. Maybe you only get two. Maybe get five. Maybe you work third shift. But I'm here to tell you, do something for God. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying beat someone over the head with a with a message book. Just be uh be alive. Be salty. &gt;&gt; People are looking in this day and age we live in. They just want to see some salt. &gt;&gt; They want something to savor from and say, "I want what he's got." &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But we live in a time where it's so fast and everything is 100 miles an hour. I live in that time too that the devil wants to keep you so busy and the last thing he wants you to do is just get on your knees tonight and just thank him. Always say a little prayer. Well, you lay me down to sleep. Oh God, I got two minutes for you, but I've had all day. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't want to say. I'm just here to tell you. But I want to be in a time where I say, "Lord, I want to say I just want to talk to you every day. I want to be in a constant prayer. Not not just a not just my brother, not just not brother Andrew, not just a constant, well, I talk to you occasionally, but no, just talk to him like you talking to me. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I I love you. I got this. He already knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; He knows your every need, your sisters, brothers. He knows your every care before you even ask him. &gt;&gt; Our God's a big God. &gt;&gt; My daddy is a big God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He owns a cattle on a thousand hills. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He created this universe. &gt;&gt; He can speak your trials out of existence. He's just waiting for you to step forward and put some faith in the action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop talking about it. Just say, "Lord, I surrender to you." &gt;&gt; No matter what you going through, just say, "Lord, I'm going to step forward tonight &gt;&gt; and I'm going to put the the past in the past." But too many times we live in a time where we look to the rearview mirror. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden the brothers in the back, we live in a time where we're too worried about the what happened in the past and the future. What about now? &gt;&gt; What about now? What is God doing for you now? &gt;&gt; Oh, he gave you breath in your body. &gt;&gt; He put gas in your tank to get here. Maybe you only got five miles to empty. Maybe you came in here spiritually five miles to empty. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, he wants to refill you tonight. &gt;&gt; As as David said, I lost the joy of my salvation. The prophet said he didn't lose his salvation. He lost the joy. Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, you came all the way here just cuz hey, I need a little bit of joy. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living depressed. I'm tired of living in anxiety. I'm tired of giving over to the devil. When all God says, "Hey, I've been waiting for you where you left me. &gt;&gt; I've been waiting for you." Oh, think about it tonight, church. I hope this is okay. As Psalms 39:4 through5 says, "Lord, talking about time, Lord, make me to know mine end, measure of my days." He says, "What is it that I may uh how frail I am be thought how how made my days as a handbreath and my age as nothing before thee." Verse uh James 4:14. It says, "Whereas you know not what you shall do tomorrow, for what is your life? It's even a vapor and appear for a little time and vanishes away." That's what he tells about your time today. It appears for a little while and it vanishes away. But I'm here to tell you that we just buried my father-in-law the other day and I preached this sermon and we had church. We didn't have a funeral. I said, "We're not having a funeral. We're going to have a celebration." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We had straight church, man. It was great. I mean, it was so wonderful because I knew my father-in-law didn't want no sad funeral. &gt;&gt; I told my wife, "If I die, y'all have revival." Brother David, wherever you're at, You you'll be in the revival, too, brother Andrew. Y'all come on. You You lead the singing. Y'all make sure we have revival service. I don't want to be just going over there mourning over me cuz I ain't mourning over there &gt;&gt; when I met my reward. Everything I've been coming for, every time I've been pushing through all these trials, I just I'm telling you, I'm going to be dancing over there. Maybe it'd be good to let your hair down sometimes and stop being so stir sh and say, "Brother Chris, I'm just going to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the person to the left thinks. I don't care a person to the right thinks." Just let it down tonight and say, "Lord, I'm tired of just living a fake life. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of hiding behind the message. &gt;&gt; I really want to surrender my life to God. I'm not saying you're not going to fall because I fell every day. But I'm here to tell you, what did the blood do? The blood on Calvary reaches deep. Everything that you've done, everything that all is under the blood. If you can make it right, it all paid the price for our sins. And is the same atonement is before you tonight. &gt;&gt; When you fall down, young people, get back up. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you, "Well, you're not saved. I hear it all the time. Well, I just don't think I'm saved, brother Chris. No, that's what the devil wants you to tell you. You're not saved. But I'm here to tell you to get back up, confess it, and say, "Lord, I'm sorry." And move forward. &gt;&gt; But we live in that state of mind, the busyiness where the devil wants to bring us down down that path of life. As Psalms 90:12 says, "So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts into wisdom." Ecclesiastes 3:1, to everything there is a season and a time and every purpose under heaven. Ecclesiastes 3:17, we're talking about time. God shall bring every work unto judgment with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil. Think about it. Galatians 6, if you can pull that up. Galatians 6:9 it says, "And let us not be weary and welloing for the season we shall reap if we faint not." Verse 10, "As we have therefore opportunity, &gt;&gt; let us do good unto all men, not just some men." And you know, it's so easy to love the people that love you. &gt;&gt; It's easy. I'm telling you, I know it's easy to love someone that loves you, but what about someone that don't love you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What about someone that hates you? You could say, "I've been praying for you. &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you, I love you today." &gt;&gt; Oh my. We live in that time. As we as we just gear down this, I want to read what else I want to turn to this scripture if that's okay. saw. Matthew 24, Matthew 24 verse 11, it says, "And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many, and because iniquity shall abound, and the love of many shall wax cold." I believe that's what they were living in. &gt;&gt; It says, "But he that shall endure to the end shall shame shall be saved." What am I saying to you tonight? It's it's we you don't have but so much time. And I'm here to tell you to endure to the end with everything you got. Give it all you got for Jesus Christ. If I could have sold out before 20 years old, I would have if id have knew what I knew today, young people, I would have sold out way before 20 years old. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have waited so long. I would have surrendered to a lot longer. If I could go back, but I can't go back. I got to stay forward &gt;&gt; and just say, you know what? I'm gonna take this time that I'm living in and live it all that I got for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God goes on to say, he said, you'd ask him to, he said, you'd ask them about it. Well, we got our television. He said, that's how we find comfort. See, that's the American attitude. You see, we got television. We got plenty of money. We got fine cars. We got nice houses. Wouldn't you say amen? &gt;&gt; He said, "What do we need with the Lord?" He said, "We don't need that." He said, "We don't need that." He said, "That's the attitude." He goes on to say, he says, "About the only religion and salvation we have in love is amongst the real godly people." &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, the Bible said that you that would happen, you Bible readers." He said, "I heard the holy amen." And you preachers back there, that's right. Love would be so far away in the last days. &gt;&gt; The only love there would be left would be between the elect of God's people. &gt;&gt; That's why you want to be around the elect of God's people because there's a love that we need. There's a I need you and you need me. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need each other. &gt;&gt; It's not a time to go sit at home in a corner. &gt;&gt; When the Bible says come to church more in the days as the days are approaching &gt;&gt; more so, not less, more. &gt;&gt; That's the time we're living in. &gt;&gt; But even the devil will try to come up and say, "Well, maybe not. Maybe no. Go to church. Get involved, young people. Be around the youth. be around godly influences. My wife got me something the other not long ago. I think it was last Christmas and I walked in the other day and it was on the wall and it said, "Keep your kids around the I'm paraphrasing, but he says basically keep your home in an atmosphere that your that your kids will want to bring your kids to." &gt;&gt; She put it on the wall. I walked in the other day and I said, "Wow, I love that. I love that quote because I want my home to have so much love. Maybe they don't know a quote, but they feel the love of God. &gt;&gt; oozing out of us that they go, "Hey, I want that real thing that he's got." &gt;&gt; What is it? It's just the love of God. As the magicians come, he says, "Oh, blessed and eternal God, the prophet says, who brought again the Lord Jesus from the dead." This is in the message love. And he has now been presented to us after 1900 years yet alive and just as sufficient in his power in his presence as he was 1900 years ago when he walked in Galilee. And we thank he's he's praying. He says and we thank our father because thou has done this. He says in the dark and this dark evil day that we're living when there's so much confusion on every hand. &gt;&gt; I'm like amen. So much confusion on every hand. He said among the world and the nations in politics and every walk of life. We're talking about time. He said even to the Christian walk there is confusion. Yet there is confusion. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said but we're so glad to know that Jesus still lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "And as the scripture has said of him, the same yesterday, today, and forever." &gt;&gt; And when you see the end approaching rapidly and the signs of the near coming, our hearts jump for joy. When we rest upon the blessed promise that he is the same, and that he loves us and he gave himself for us. &gt;&gt; I thought about I thought about in closing, I thought about Cain and Abel tonight. And I was back there and I kind of just started thinking about Cain and Abel, how he presented a sacrifice and they they he took his first firstlings of the lamb. And brother Bram goes on to say and paraphrasing for time. But here he goes on, he says, "Cain could have told for a year maybe and he presented it and he and he got it all ready and he waited a whole year and he he he got that's how we do sometimes. We want to know, oh well, I'm I need to wait till I wait till I'm perfect. &gt;&gt; God's come from unperfect people tonight. He came for me and you tonight. He wants to clean you up. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do the cleaning. You just have to do the surrendering. &gt;&gt; You just have to surrender to God. And you know what he said? He said, "Can and maybe they play something softly tonight, but but here here comes Cain." Think about this. He spent, he said, about maybe a year tolling, getting it all pretty. And he said, "Here comes Abel." Cain and Abel. Here comes Abel. &gt;&gt; And he says, "He's dragging this lamb." Just picture this tonight for a minute. He said, "He's pulling this lamb." And he's dragging this old lamb. And his feet don't want to go. &gt;&gt; Think about what our Jesus did for you tonight. &gt;&gt; He's dragging this lamb. He said maybe he had a grape vine. He didn't have a hemp or anything. He said maybe it was a grape vine around his neck and he's pulling him and he says he gets him up to a rock and and he gets him up to the rock and he said he gets him to this rock and he maybe maybe maybe lays him down and he he grabs this rock and it's edged and he starts to beat him in his throat and he starts to beat him after one after another and he said blood's just pouring over this lamb. his white wool just becomes bloody. That's what Jesus Christ done for me and you tonight. &gt;&gt; That's what our in the most innocent lamb has done for you tonight. We're living in a time that we should realize what God has done for me. I'll take what God has done for me. I'll share it with the world. &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, I'm not a preacher." No, but you could be on your job and you could tell them about Jesus. &gt;&gt; Maybe they're waiting for your life to say just surrender tonight and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to give you my time. I'm tired of living this rat race of time that I don't give God much time. I just give them what I have left. &gt;&gt; I wait till the end of the day to say, "Here's a little bit of time. I know it's quiet, but it's real. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to me tonight, too. [Music] But we serve a God that's rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; We serve a God that just says, "Come home." Young people, we serve a God that could take a broke up home that could take a boy that my mom scheduled a do a abortion one night. My dad said, "You took so much medicine, we're going to have to schedule abortion. We're going to have to set it up." So, they go through the whole thing and they set it up. They go through abortion. They get it to the end and she's like, "You know what? I'm not going to do it." He said, "Well, I will beat you until you do it. I will beat you till you until you do abortion." He won't be able to talk. They said he won't be able to speak. He won't be able to move. But we serve a God that I'm speaking to you tonight. &gt;&gt; I sp a godly mother that laid her head in a corner of a hospital room that said, "If you kill me, I'm still having this baby. Think about what he's done for you tonight. Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, I have a testimony. I'm going through this and maybe but you're here tonight and you say, "God, I'm tired of running. I'm tired of filling up air with this and that. He just wants your best." And you know what? You can come tonight the way you are, just like Abel did. He took his first first lings. It says in the Bible, he took just the first leaves and he said, "God, here it is. This is all I got." He said, "This is all I got." That's what he wants. You don't have to do the cleaning. He just wants what you got. He'll do the cleaning. He'll give you joy in your heart if he's gone. If you lost your motivation, you've lost some tonight. Say, "God, I want my joy back. I want the fire, the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come sweeping through my heart. And some of you, maybe you got a lost wayward kid tonight. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'm here to tell you, sister, you claim them tonight. &gt;&gt; The Bible says they're yours. The Bible says your family, your house, your house is yours. &gt;&gt; But too many times we forget what the scripture says, that your house is yours. Look at Rahab. She put the scarlet cord out and claimed her whole house. You might be the very reason you've pushed to the end and all your family get in. I'm here to tell you, I'm pushing to the end. I got lost ones in my family. I got my dad and this person and that person that with a broke up home, but I'm going to press on to the high calling of God. He's gave us a message. He's opened the revelation. He's opened the Bible tonight. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it? Redeem your time back, church. with all heads bowed. Baby, there's one. However you feel led tonight, the altar's open. I know it's a Wednesday night. I'm sorry if it went a little long, but we could be on Facebook for four hours. We could be in our emails for hours. We can be at work on emails for endless hours, but then we worry about time for maybe going 20 minutes over. Maybe you say, "I'm you're speaking to me tonight." Maybe it's just for one person steps out and say, "You know what? I want that tonight. I want another refilling. I want another I I I'm tired of living this little life just a rat race to say God. I want more of you. I really want the salvation of the Holy Ghost. However you feel led tonight as they sing a song as my brother just sings a song. Maybe there's one. Raise their hand. Say, "Brother Chris, that's me." No one looking. That's me. You spoke to me tonight. Oh my. Lord, touch them. Touch them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, you see these hands tonight. You see them in their seats tonight. Raise my hands are up. I say, "Lord, fill me again. Refill me, Lord." When the world thinks I'm not beautiful, say, "Lord, I'm not mirroring after the world. I'm nearing half the Bible. You don't have to live in that anymore. You don't have to live in depression. You don't have to live in anxiety. Just say, "Lord, here I am like Abel tonight. I just lay it at your feet. I ain't much." That's what God uses. That's what God uses. [Music] Oh, sing it tonight. Oh, teach. &gt;&gt; Teach me, Lord. to wait down on. &gt;&gt; However you feel that tonight the time you answer my plea. Teach me to rely on my Can we stand? [Music] That wait upon the Lord. shall renew next day. They shall mountain with me. They shall run and not be. They shall walk and not fade. Teach me Lord, teach me Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful message tonight. Amen. Aren't you thankful for the Lord? &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord always giving us another reminder when we come to church, it's to take inventory. And I feel tonight that in my heart, the Lord spoke to my heart and I want to check up. You know, I want to take inventory. Lord brought conviction and I'm thankful. You could hear the spirit cry out of our brother's heart just pleading what are we putting our time into? You know, what things have alled us that has some value to to spend our time? I was thinking about redeeming things. There's so many things that we put forth on time. I will get points on this. I'll take the time to redeem points on this and that. But here's the Lord saying, "I'm over here. Will you spend a little time with me?" Oh, I think that that's the greatest thing that a believer can do is spend time with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know what? What a You know, we must believe that God is and that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him. And I believe that's that's redeeming the time. I I I just feel in my heart to examine myself. What's motivating me? What's what's driving me to spend the time that I'm spending? Oh, I thank the Lord for the Isab tonight. I I I want to I want to say, God, search me. Try me. Oh God, refine me. Oh, I want to be spent for the Lord. Amen. I know that's your heart's desire. Why don't we sing that song? Let the worshippers arise. I feel like it's time to worship the Lord. What what an admonition to redeem the time. Amen. Aren't you thankful to the Lord? &gt;&gt; We don't have Tomorrow's not a guarantee. We've had people come through and they might have thought they had the future uh to to give to the Lord, but tonight is the night to give to the Lord. And if God gives us tomorrow, let's give uh God tomorrow. Let's give him all that we got. Let's let's have like the spirit of David is saying, "My time is in his hand." Amen. Let's sing this together. &gt;&gt; I see that you are drawing a line in the sand. I want to be standing on your side. Oh, holding your hand. Let your kingom come. Let it live in me.

As you feel on your heart to come and brother pray with you, you just want to get it settled and just say, "From this time forward, Lord, I want my time. What I have, I can commit it into your hand. My time will be in your hand." Amen. If you feel like it'll help you and the brothers will pray with you. Let's sing that again as those of you that have to be dismissed, I understand. And so you can be dismissed at this time. But we'll just sit here and worship a few more moments as God deals with these hearts. Amen. Let's sing that again. &gt;&gt; Father, I see growing in the sand. I'm going to be standing by your side, holding your hand. So let your kingom come. Oh, let it live. This is my This is my prayer.

But I want to say tonight with every breath that I have, with every moment that I have, I'm a son of God. I want to claim the victory that Jesus Christ bought for me, that he manifested himself at the end time. and I want to go and redeem the time and go into the storehouse and claim what's mine. Amen. That's what we want to do tonight. Amen. Let's bow our hearts together. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you, God, for this wonderful time that you've given us tonight, Lord, to remind us, oh God, that this life is just a vapor in the wind and the only thing that really will matter at the end of the road is what we did for you. And Lord, it was the things that you revealed to us and how we acted upon it, Lord, that will be the things that please you, Lord. Help us to be faithful with what you've given, Lord. We just want to give you our best in everything, Father. And so, as we go tonight, Lord, we pray that, oh God, there would be opportunities, Lord, that when we face them, Lord, may you quicken to us. This is my time. This is my opportunity to claim what I believe is true and share it with somebody else and bless your people as they go, Lord. And I pray that you'd give them grace and strength and health, Lord. And Lord, just may we all return back here on Sunday and prayed up. and even this the little event on Saturday. Lord, I just pray that we go and remember our pastor and give him, oh God, strength for this weekend. We just commit all things into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's I, you know, I just feel like singing that song, Joy is the flag. You know, the devil's tried to beat us up, but there's a joy that's been restored. Amen. God bless you as you go. Let's sing this as we go. &gt;&gt; Joy is the flag on high from the castle of my heart. From the castle of my heart. From the castle of my heart. For you high from the castle of my heart.
