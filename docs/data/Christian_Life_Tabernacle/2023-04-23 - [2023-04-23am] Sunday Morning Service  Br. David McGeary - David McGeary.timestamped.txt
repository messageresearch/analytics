[6:24] word of Our Testimony
[6:26] and it's from Faith to Faith so when you

[6:32] believe that can ignite your faith for

[6:42] move through as we work towards the word

[9:58] so one thing I want to tell you is one
[10:02] word I want to start this testimony with
[10:04] is
[10:06] p-u-s-h push
[10:09] this is the word I learned when I was
[10:11] little kid back in India used to go to
[10:13] convent school Holy Cross School that
[10:15] was the name and uh one of the preacher
[10:18] he he shared that so This Acronym has
[10:21] been with me p-u-sh since I was I was a
[10:24] kid stand for pray until something
[10:27] happens p-u-s-h
[10:29] in my testimony today
[10:31] it took 17 years
[10:34] 17 years
[10:36] we came here in 2001 we became citizen
[10:39] in 2007 and that's where my mom applied
[10:42] for my sister
[10:44] to come stay with us and it took 17
[10:49] years her petition was approved
[10:53] 2020 and that's where the kovid happened
[10:55] so everything shut down and that delayed
[10:58] another four or five years but glory to
[11:02] God last week my sister
[11:05] and her husband and the kids they were
[11:08] able to put their feet here in the
[11:11] United States of America and they are
[11:13] here with us today so thank you so glory
[11:18] to God glory to God
[11:21] one another reason I wanted to share
[11:23] this testimony with you is sometimes it
[11:26] feels like nothing is happening we just
[11:29] continue to pray continue to pray but uh
[11:32] it is um I I came from India where where
[11:36] Hinduism and other religions are are
[11:39] very strong very prominent and we
[11:41] everywhere we go we see the temples and
[11:44] and Bible States this very very clearly
[11:46] they have gods they cannot see they have
[11:50] they have gods they cannot walk they
[11:52] have ears they cannot see
[11:54] just glory to God that we have a god
[11:59] even if we do not even say a word he
[12:02] listens to our hearts we do not even
[12:04] have to say a word and he know exactly
[12:06] what we are going through so my
[12:08] encouragement to you is just continue to
[12:10] stay strong in faith This is the End
[12:13] days and I'm just I we do not know when
[12:16] the Lord is going to come and we are

[14:03] good morning
[14:04] did you enjoy that
[14:06] I'm going to use that again pray until
[14:08] something happens
[14:11] that's uh that's wonderful we're gonna
[14:13] read in Psalm 53 this morning
[14:17] you know and you'll notice as we read
[14:19] through this
[14:20] that this is really just uh
[14:23] kind of a perfect summary of the
[14:26] the world that we live in today
[14:29] it's you know the condition of the
[14:31] people
[14:32] the
[14:34] attitude concerning God
[14:36] and his word and just kind of the
[14:38] general state of the world around us
[14:42] just from the very start in verse 1 the
[14:45] fool had said in his heart
[14:47] there is no God
[14:49] corrupt are they and have done
[14:51] abominable iniquity
[14:53] there is none to do with good
[14:56] reading out of verse 3 every one of them
[14:58] has gone back they are all together
[15:00] become filthy
[15:02] there is none that doeth good no not one
[15:07] you know I was reading that in honestly
[15:09] outside of the work of God in our lives
[15:12] this would describe us
[15:15] would be no different
[15:16] outside of his grace and outside of his
[15:18] hand
[15:19] the word that he sent
[15:23] you know David speaks to this as he
[15:25] closes the psalm
[15:27] he says oh in verse 6 oh that the
[15:29] salvation of Israel
[15:32] were coming to Zion
[15:34] you know what I was reading that who is
[15:36] that salvation
[15:38] of Israel
[15:41] remember what old Simon said
[15:43] in the temple in Jerusalem when
[15:46] a young couple brought a little baby to
[15:49] be dedicated
[15:51] he said in Luke 2 29 Lord now let us
[15:54] thou thy servant depart in peace
[15:56] according to Thy Word
[15:59] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
[16:04] you know when Peter declared that when
[16:06] he was brought before the Sanhedrin
[16:09] in Acts 4 12 neither is there salvation
[16:11] in any other
[16:13] for there is none other name under
[16:15] Heaven given among men
[16:17] whereby we must be saved
[16:21] can we say that the salvation of Israel
[16:24] has come
[16:25] that David spoke of
[16:28] you know he continues
[16:31] in verse 6 when God bringeth back the
[16:33] Captivity of his people Jacob shall
[16:36] rejoice
[16:37] and Israel shall be glad
[16:41] you know David was speaking of a coming
[16:42] day
[16:45] and we know that this was fulfilled when
[16:47] Jesus came on the scene because it says
[16:49] in Ephesians 4 8 wherefore he said when
[16:52] he ascended up on high
[16:54] he led captivity captive
[16:57] and gave gifts unto men
[17:00] you know he has come
[17:03] he is present
[17:05] he has fulfilled the word concerning him
[17:09] we believe these things
[17:12] but you know as I was reading Psalm 53
[17:14] this week there was a verse that in
[17:16] particular that stuck out to me and it
[17:18] was in verse 5.
[17:20] says this there were they
[17:23] in great fear
[17:26] where no fear was
[17:30] think about that
[17:32] being in fear
[17:34] when there's no reason to fear
[17:38] you know this is a reference of the
[17:40] Judgment being visited upon the Earth
[17:42] but it occurred to me
[17:44] how many times
[17:46] do I fear
[17:48] when there is no fear
[17:53] how many times do we find ourselves
[17:55] fearing an outcome
[17:57] fearing the end fearing what's going to
[17:59] happen next
[18:00] varying the effects of something or the
[18:03] future
[18:04] and there is no fear there's nothing to
[18:06] fear
[18:09] you know the salvation of Israel has
[18:11] come
[18:12] the captor has led captivity
[18:15] but
[18:16] you know his presence is here but his
[18:18] presence is that place where no fear is
[18:21] and yet still if we're not careful
[18:24] we can find ourselves in fear
[18:28] David said in Psalm 23
[18:31] and verse 4.
[18:33] he said yea though I walk through the
[18:35] valley of the shadow of death
[18:38] I will fear no evil
[18:40] why
[18:41] for thou art with me
[18:45] the salvation of Israel
[18:48] the captor of captivity itself where no
[18:51] fear is
[18:54] you know he doesn't sometimes we don't
[18:56] feel it
[18:58] but he doesn't manifest himself by
[19:01] feeling
[19:03] he manifests himself by his word
[19:06] he said he was here
[19:09] you know the question is is how many
[19:11] times do we fear when no fear is when
[19:14] he's present
[19:16] you know Jesus told individuals time and
[19:18] time again be not afraid
[19:21] fear not
[19:23] you know they were in fear even when he
[19:25] was in their midst
[19:27] afraid of an outcome
[19:29] of a condition of a circumstance
[19:31] whatever it may be
[19:33] you know in messages like Awakening
[19:35] Jesus
[19:36] or calling Jesus on the scene
[19:40] brother Branham spoke of a time when the
[19:42] disciples found themselves on the sea in
[19:44] a great storm
[19:47] it says in Mark 4 37 that the waves beat
[19:49] into the ship so that it was now full
[19:53] and the disciples were in great fear
[19:58] they were in fear for their lives and
[20:00] yet there was Jesus there the whole time
[20:04] they could see him with their eyes
[20:07] and still
[20:09] they were afraid they were in great fear
[20:12] where no fear was
[20:17] you know of course we all know the story
[20:18] they
[20:20] ran and woke Jesus and he spoke a word
[20:24] and calm the storm but you know what's
[20:27] interesting to me that you look at the
[20:29] disciples reaction but look at Jesus in
[20:32] the middle of that storm he was
[20:33] comfortable enough
[20:34] to rest to sleep
[20:37] even when the boat was full of water
[20:40] and he was sleeping
[20:43] but the disciples were in fear there had
[20:45] never been a word that had gone forth
[20:46] let's go to the other side
[20:49] that was that was the word that had to
[20:51] be fulfilled what happened in between
[20:52] was irrelevant
[20:54] but the people were in but the disciples
[20:57] were in great fear nonetheless when no
[20:59] fear was
[21:01] you know fear is the opposite of faith
[21:05] Jesus finally told them in verse 40 Mark
[21:07] 4 40. why are ye so fear fearful
[21:12] how is it that ye have no faith
[21:17] you know fear is not the opposite of
[21:19] feeling his presence
[21:21] fear is the opposite of faith
[21:26] you know he said that he would he said
[21:28] by his word that he would never leave us
[21:30] or forsake us we're in a condition of
[21:33] where no fear is
[21:35] so I wonder how many times we still have
[21:38] fear when no fear is
[21:43] that's a symptom of judgment as we'll
[21:45] read here in a little bit but you know
[21:47] John says in first John 4 hereby know ye
[21:49] the spirit of God
[21:51] every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
[21:54] Christ is come
[21:55] in the flesh
[21:57] is of God in every spirit that
[21:59] confesseth not that Jesus Christ has
[22:01] come in the flesh is not of God
[22:04] you know the spirit of fear is a
[22:07] confession that he has not come
[22:09] that he is not present
[22:13] you know it says later in first John 4
[22:15] verse 17 herein is our love made perfect
[22:20] that we may have boldness
[22:22] not fear
[22:24] in the day of judgment because
[22:27] as he is
[22:28] so are we in this world
[22:32] consider Jesus response to the Storm at
[22:35] the sea he was in perfect rest
[22:38] as he is so are we in this world
[22:42] he goes on to say there is no fear in
[22:44] love
[22:45] but perfect love casteth out fear
[22:48] because fear hath torment
[22:51] he that feareth is not made perfect
[22:54] in love
[22:56] and remember we live in an hour when the
[22:58] hearts of children have been restored
[23:01] to the fathers
[23:03] let's go ahead and stand this morning
[23:04] we're going to read Psalm 53.
[23:07] but as we read that and we consider our
[23:10] day
[23:11] and the day of judgment that we live in
[23:15] you know I think at least to me it was a
[23:17] reminder not to fear
[23:19] when no fear is
[23:22] there is no fear there's no reason to
[23:24] fear why are you fearful
[23:28] let's just go ahead and read that
[23:30] together and remember that he is come
[23:33] his presence is here
[23:35] there is no fear
[23:38] let's read that starting at verse one
[23:40] the fool had said in his heart there is
[23:43] no God corrupt are they and have done
[23:46] abominable iniquity there is none that
[23:48] doeth good God looked down from heaven
[23:50] upon the children of men to see if there
[23:53] were any that did understand that did
[23:55] seek God every one of them has gone back
[23:58] they are all together become filthy
[24:00] there is none that doeth good no not one
[24:03] have the workers of iniquity no
[24:05] knowledge who eat up my people as they
[24:07] eat bread they have not called upon God
[24:10] there were they in great fear where no
[24:13] fear was for God has scattered the bones
[24:15] of him that incapeth against thee thou
[24:18] Hast put them to shame because God had
[24:20] despised them oh that the salvation of
[24:23] Israel were come out of Zion when God
[24:25] bringeth back the Captivity of his
[24:27] people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel
[24:30] shall be glad
[24:34] amen praise the Lord you may have your
[24:36] seats I want to sing that song at

[31:35] me with the Holy Ghost and given me my
[31:36] my family you've surely been good to me
[31:40] my we got something to praise him for
[31:43] praise is wonderful name we just want to
[31:45] take this opportunity to take up the
[31:49] tithes and offerings and also
[31:51] I mentioned some prayer requests and
[31:53] praise reports
[31:56] um
[31:56] I read this brother griever writes I
[31:58] asked prayer for my wife
[32:01] and then I just thought I'm just going
[32:02] to put a comma here and read it like he
[32:05] wrote it as a testimony
[32:06] she has been feeling well in her throat
[32:10] so I thought I'm just going to read it
[32:11] the way he wrote it I know what he meant
[32:14] but he put on paper testimony
[32:16] so praise God because by his stripes
[32:20] we are healed
[32:22] amen I believe that uh we're a
[32:24] supernatural people and sometimes we do
[32:25] things and we think it's it doesn't mean
[32:27] anything but if we're the word made
[32:29] flesh
[32:30] well praise His Wonderful Name also the
[32:33] rush Family writes a a special need for
[32:36] a family member a sister of one of the
[32:39] family
[32:39] they they just really need the lord
[32:42] they're in a bad situation so if you
[32:44] just want to take that burden upon your
[32:45] heart and maybe speak with them and
[32:49] um get in the trenches with them many
[32:53] times we we just allow prayer requests
[32:55] just to
[32:57] come over the desk and we never even
[32:59] think about it again but that's not the
[33:01] purpose
[33:02] the purpose is as a family as a body of
[33:05] Believers there's that there's a need
[33:07] and a burden that's being presented and
[33:10] we want to go over to them say hey I'm
[33:12] I'm gonna carry that with you
[33:16] that means a lot
[33:19] also uh brother Tommy just wants to
[33:22] make mention that the trusses for the
[33:25] roof are coming in for the new building
[33:27] and there's some rain in the forecast
[33:28] but we're just wanting to ask God for

[40:57] Our Father
[41:02] you have been so good
[41:05] we heard the testimonies this morning
[41:08] Father
[41:10] we can see that you are mindful of your
[41:12] people
[41:14] you said nothing would pluck us out of
[41:16] the palm of your hand
[41:18] father though many times we've tried to
[41:21] get out
[41:22] we've tried to get away we've tried to
[41:25] run but you sought us with patience Lord
[41:29] and Loving Hands and you return us back
[41:33] to your fold and
[41:35] forgive us and comfort us and remind us
[41:39] that you're our place of safety
[41:41] father we ask you to bless the needs of
[41:44] the people this morning
[41:46] may your word touch their heart
[41:51] may they
[41:53] feel at a fight this morning with your
[41:56] blessings and your goodness
[41:59] we asked this morning Father that
[42:03] our Spirits could be open to you and
[42:07] Lord if we know something's not right
[42:09] then let us just be honest with you
[42:13] say Lord I don't have the right heart I
[42:16] don't have the right mind
[42:18] I don't have the right attitude
[42:21] but you're the Creator and The Giver
[42:24] Lord and I ask you to transform me this
[42:27] morning to be what I ought to be
[42:30] in your name we pray
[42:32] amen amen God bless you this morning
[42:36] certainly nice to be in the house of the
[42:38] Lord and and
[42:41] as we
[42:43] continue to go forward you know
[42:48] okay
[42:49] finally we come time you know we're
[42:52] going to put the trusses and we have a
[42:53] week of rain in front of us and
[42:56] and we had the forms all set and they
[42:59] all washed out
[43:01] and so I get frustrated and then I just
[43:04] got to sit back a moment and say you
[43:06] know there's somebody else in control
[43:08] here
[43:09] and you know I was real discouraged how
[43:12] long it was taking us to get the permit
[43:15] and everything but did you know that
[43:17] right when we got
[43:19] our building permit and started to build
[43:22] Lumber came down 60 percent
[43:25] and we got the lumber for the same price
[43:28] we would have two years ago
[43:30] it took two years but he's in control
[43:33] amen you believe that so we're just
[43:37] gonna go forward and make the mistakes
[43:40] we make and he'll fix them
[43:42] amen let's turn in our Bibles to uh
[43:45] Nehemiah
[43:48] and uh
[43:51] we want to read a couple's scriptures
[43:55] there found in the book of Nehemiah I
[43:58] just pulled my book marker out so let me
[44:01] find it here real quick and uh
[44:07] um
[44:09] the book of Nehemiah here
[44:16] I think it's in the same place it's
[44:19] always been
[44:20] but uh
[44:23] it just takes me a little longer to
[44:26] get places now than it did
[44:29] I might have to grab somebody else's bio
[44:32] though here
[44:35] yeah
[44:36] I even have the page number
[44:40] all right here it is let us read now
[44:43] let's just read our scripture and we'll
[44:46] sit down and
[44:49] so we're going to read in the second
[44:51] chapter and the 10th verse
[44:56] second chapter and tenth verse and see
[44:59] if we can draw some
[45:02] uh
[45:03] encouragement from the word of the Lord
[45:09] when Sam ballet
[45:13] the horror night
[45:16] and
[45:18] tuba the servant the Amorite heard of it
[45:24] it grieved them exceedingly
[45:27] that there was come a man to seek the
[45:33] welfare of the children of Israel father
[45:38] we ask you to bless your word to us in
[45:40] your precious name we pray amen God
[45:43] bless you
[45:49] we certainly have been enjoying this
[45:53] book it's one of my favorite books
[45:56] in the scriptures
[45:58] and I'd like to uh
[46:02] just kind of walk through some of these
[46:04] things again with us we know the story
[46:07] that there was a cup Bearer
[46:11] and some of his family members came to
[46:13] visit
[46:15] and he inquired
[46:17] about how things were going
[46:21] and as he did that
[46:24] they begin to express to him what a
[46:27] distress
[46:28] that they were in
[46:30] that the city was in disrepair
[46:35] that
[46:37] they were in uh
[46:40] a bad way
[46:43] and it became a burden
[46:46] on nehemiah's heart
[46:49] so much so that the burden began to
[46:52] reflect in his continents
[46:55] in other words his whole atmosphere his
[46:58] whole approach to life
[47:01] his whole being was now been affected
[47:06] by the condition
[47:09] of his brethren
[47:12] and it moved upon him so much that he
[47:15] finally made his request to the king and
[47:18] the King told them to go do what he's
[47:20] done and he showed up
[47:23] in Jerusalem
[47:25] and we see this great
[47:28] uh scripture here that he speaks and it
[47:32] talks about the people around about him
[47:35] and everything that they were grieved
[47:39] that there came one that sought the
[47:43] welfare
[47:45] of the children of Israel or of the
[47:48] Israelites
[47:49] and we know that this great uh uh
[47:55] people at one time was a great people
[47:59] they turned away from God they got
[48:01] carried back into captivity
[48:04] but yet God's Got A Plan
[48:06] for their lives
[48:08] and so we know that the story's going to
[48:11] go forward but there's so many wonderful
[48:14] things that are contained within the
[48:17] framework of that and
[48:20] and he says here he says they were and
[48:24] it grieved them exceedingly
[48:27] that there was come a man to seek the
[48:31] welfare of the children of Israel
[48:36] and I thought in my heart I don't have
[48:39] titles much but I thought these people
[48:42] called Israel
[48:44] who were these people called Israel and
[48:49] you know Israel is a
[48:51] type of the Bride you we know that the
[48:55] way God dealt with them and and we look
[48:59] back on Israel and we think about it uh
[49:02] where did they come from
[49:04] who are these people Israel what brought
[49:08] them into existence the very fact that
[49:13] they were the very fact that they were
[49:16] they were where they are the
[49:18] circumstance that they were in the fact
[49:21] that just 16 years earlier their Temple
[49:25] had laid in Ruins and now their city is
[49:29] laid in Ruins and so we asked ourselves
[49:32] who are these people
[49:34] who are these people Israel and and what
[49:38] caused them to be and if we would ask
[49:42] ourselves this morning who are these
[49:44] people
[49:45] that we call Believers or or message
[49:50] followers or the bride we are not a
[49:55] religion we are a people you understand
[49:58] we are birthed of something we are
[50:02] birthed of a Heritage we are birth of a
[50:05] promise we are birthed and and so in
[50:09] that type who are these people
[50:11] and and we understand that these people
[50:15] came into existence because one day and
[50:19] well-strickened in aged man and a
[50:22] well-stricken an age woman got a promise
[50:26] from God
[50:27] that God came on the scene and said
[50:31] Abraham
[50:33] you and Sarah are going to have a child
[50:37] and we understand that these people came
[50:40] into existence because they were visited
[50:44] by Melchizedek
[50:46] they were visited by if I could say it
[50:50] in the light of our age they were
[50:52] visited by the son of man God veiled in
[50:57] flesh in the form and came to him and
[51:01] delivered them a promise and Out of This
[51:05] Promise a people came into existence not
[51:10] a religion but a people and so who were
[51:14] these people well these people were a
[51:16] people that were built on a revelation
[51:21] they were built on faith
[51:24] election and revelation
[51:29] that's how they came in existence
[51:31] because Abraham
[51:34] received a promise and he believed that
[51:38] the god that made the promise was able
[51:41] to perform that which he promised
[51:45] just think of how much this types us
[51:48] this morning
[51:49] I believe there's going to be a rapture
[51:53] I believe that God promised us
[51:56] and I hope it comes real to us that one
[51:59] day that we are going to transform from
[52:01] this world to another world
[52:04] that our bodies are going to be changed
[52:07] in a twinkling of an eye in just a
[52:10] moment and if some of us would happen to
[52:12] go by way of the Grave nor would that
[52:15] hinder Us in any way but we would be we
[52:18] would become forth out of that grave to
[52:21] meet our Lord in the air
[52:23] and and so they they had a a a promise
[52:27] that they were given and also the other
[52:30] thing about it that was so far is that
[52:34] they were elected
[52:37] they were chosen
[52:41] to be the children of God they were
[52:43] elected to have a land they were elected
[52:47] to receive a son
[52:49] and and I I just thought in my heart
[52:52] this morning
[52:54] you know look at us
[52:56] this morning
[52:58] and for the young people I think that
[53:00] that we we have what we call
[53:04] the Bible
[53:06] but what is the Bible
[53:08] the Bible if you could look at it this
[53:11] way it's a book of History
[53:14] it's a it's a a a a a recording and of
[53:20] of the the journey that God's people has
[53:25] taken
[53:26] it it tells them the trials they've been
[53:29] through it tells them the
[53:31] discouragements they've had the the
[53:33] battles that they fought the things that
[53:36] came up against them you can sit here
[53:38] and you can see looking at this you can
[53:40] see a persevering people who that God
[53:45] that the god preserved when so many
[53:49] tried to wipe them out
[53:52] that nothing could pluck them out of the
[53:55] palm of his hand that he had put his
[53:58] heart towards his people
[53:59] me and he kept every word to him
[54:03] he said if you go astray he said I'll
[54:06] take my hand off you if you repent I'll
[54:09] take you back
[54:12] but I'll never leave you
[54:14] nor forsake you but I'll be with you
[54:17] even in you till the end I want this
[54:21] morning for all of us to understand that
[54:24] who were these people what type of
[54:26] people were they what was it that they
[54:30] had and for us to sit back this morning
[54:32] and realize we are like these people
[54:35] they are a type of us
[54:38] what made them is what makes us
[54:43] what they've been through is what we go
[54:46] through what their promise was is our
[54:50] promise
[54:52] there's not a lot of difference
[54:56] they were marked
[54:59] separated out
[55:02] marked by
[55:03] circumcision in the natural being a
[55:07] natural type
[55:09] and we're mark
[55:11] we're marked by our circumcision our
[55:15] separation from the world
[55:18] not that we condemn that's not our
[55:22] purpose to condemn we don't condemn
[55:25] those that drink we don't drink
[55:29] we don't condemn those that smoke we
[55:32] might condemn smoking
[55:35] but the world itself condemns smoking
[55:39] they'll put a sticker on it that says I
[55:43] want you to know that this product is
[55:45] harmful for your health it may cause
[55:48] cancer or might even say may does con
[55:53] that don't stop them
[55:56] you know we just
[56:00] just don't stop them
[56:02] they go right past that but we don't
[56:05] condemn that we don't do it
[56:09] people listen to all kinds of music
[56:12] we don't
[56:14] condemn it I mean it's as a person that
[56:18] listens to it but we don't listen to it
[56:22] we're we're circumcised spiritually
[56:25] by separation from the world so our Mark
[56:30] is the life of Holiness that we lead
[56:35] we're and we're elected
[56:41] each one of us has been elected and
[56:44] called
[56:45] and even for
[56:47] when we realize that in coming to this
[56:51] great message that we come to
[56:55] Faith is is a revelation
[56:59] Abraham had the Revelation that the god
[57:02] that spoke to him was going to do what
[57:05] he said
[57:06] and when those three men came and
[57:08] appeared to him he recognized that one
[57:12] there was something about that one that
[57:15] that signified out and when we know
[57:19] these great stories but you know in
[57:22] order for us to go forward even our
[57:24] young people and and like I've always
[57:27] said if you're young enough to go to
[57:29] school and learn algebra and learn all
[57:32] the capitals of this States and all the
[57:35] river and the rivers and the geography
[57:39] do they still teach geography
[57:41] okay good
[57:43] because nowadays you don't know what
[57:45] they teach
[57:47] but you're they're old enough to learn
[57:49] that they're old enough to to
[57:53] you know do this technology and all
[57:56] those things certainly they're old
[57:58] enough to understand what causes us to
[58:02] be a people
[58:06] because there was a man that came
[58:11] that was interested in the welfare of
[58:15] the elected Church
[58:18] that there was a message for this day
[58:22] that has come and you know you just
[58:25] can't sit back and try to teach your
[58:28] children to live right and and to uh you
[58:32] know don't do this don't do that we
[58:34] don't wear this you dress this way you
[58:36] dress that way without ever
[58:38] understanding and sitting down and
[58:41] explaining to them what makes us the way
[58:44] that we are
[58:47] and even when the children of Israel
[58:50] came out and they celebrated the
[58:53] Passover one of the very heritages of
[58:57] these people this people called Israel
[59:00] was they shared their story
[59:04] from every generation to every
[59:07] generation
[59:08] that the parents sat down with the
[59:11] children and they told them about how
[59:14] they came out of Israel how they were
[59:17] held in captivity the reason that we're
[59:20] celebrating this is because the night
[59:22] that the death angel passed over
[59:27] and and you look at each of our
[59:29] individual testimonies my testimony is
[59:32] the death angel passed over me the death
[59:35] angel of sin the death angel of the life
[59:38] that I was living in the death angel
[59:40] that could have taken me in any time by
[59:43] the grace of God that death passed over
[59:46] me
[59:47] and there was blood put on the doorpost
[59:50] of my life
[59:54] and they shared that story
[59:58] they sat down and said do you understand
[1:00:03] the reason that we are the way we are
[1:00:07] because Moses came
[1:00:10] we were in captivity
[1:00:13] and Moses came
[1:00:16] and
[1:00:19] was interested
[1:00:21] in our welfare
[1:00:27] every Jesus came
[1:00:30] because he was interested in our welfare
[1:00:33] Nehemiah came because he was interested
[1:00:37] in our welfare you know that's a sign
[1:00:41] that was to follow the church that they
[1:00:44] would know that ye are my disciples
[1:00:47] because of your interest in the welfare
[1:00:50] of another
[1:00:53] it was it was a became an identifying
[1:00:57] mark
[1:00:59] why are we the people
[1:01:05] we're in captivity do you realize that
[1:01:08] right now
[1:01:11] Christianity right now we are we are
[1:01:14] living in a world that doesn't want us
[1:01:19] we are living in a world that doesn't
[1:01:22] want to teach
[1:01:24] the god that we serve
[1:01:26] we are living in a world that wants to
[1:01:29] keep what keep so many things from us we
[1:01:34] can't go and hardly go anyplace anymore
[1:01:37] without without it just being so
[1:01:41] unbelievable
[1:01:44] what what what's allowed to go on around
[1:01:48] us truly I would say that we're in Sodom
[1:01:52] and Gomorrah so I'm not just not going
[1:01:55] to do any good to try to get our
[1:01:57] children to understand and to go forward
[1:02:00] and to embrace what we're embracing if
[1:02:04] we never sit down and explain to them
[1:02:09] what caused us because we received an
[1:02:13] Abraham
[1:02:15] in our day we received a Nehemiah in our
[1:02:18] day we received the Lord in our day we
[1:02:21] receive the Moses in our day we received
[1:02:24] a message from God that's that's the
[1:02:27] foundation
[1:02:30] that's what made these people Israel
[1:02:34] they were separated out and they let
[1:02:37] their children know that that they were
[1:02:40] elected
[1:02:47] young people
[1:02:49] when I say young people I say eight
[1:02:53] years old I don't I don't know what
[1:02:55] Young is anymore
[1:02:57] everybody's looking young to me
[1:03:02] but you can understand that you're
[1:03:04] elected
[1:03:06] that God put you in this family that
[1:03:09] you're in
[1:03:12] that that that you have a part of it
[1:03:16] you were a part of him
[1:03:19] that we live the way that we live
[1:03:22] because of what's coming to the world
[1:03:29] we live the way we live because we've
[1:03:32] been called out not to be partakers of
[1:03:36] the Judgment that's coming
[1:03:39] we we we we we
[1:03:41] live the way we live because of what
[1:03:44] that we've heard
[1:03:46] and you look at the people look at it in
[1:03:50] Israel these children of Israel they
[1:03:53] were
[1:03:54] they they live by a law
[1:03:57] they live by a word that was different
[1:04:02] and we live by a word that's different
[1:04:05] we're not we we're not conformed but
[1:04:08] we're transformed we we've been called
[1:04:11] out we've been separated we don't walk
[1:04:15] just like Israel was elected called out
[1:04:19] and separated and given a land to dwell
[1:04:22] in
[1:04:24] this is what we've got to start
[1:04:26] communicating and understanding
[1:04:30] that we all have this in common
[1:04:33] every single one of the children in
[1:04:36] Israel had one thing in common they were
[1:04:40] The Offspring of Abraham
[1:04:43] and they bore the mark in their body of
[1:04:47] that of that the children of Abraham had
[1:04:54] they were chosen
[1:04:58] and elected
[1:05:01] and despised
[1:05:04] and the reproach
[1:05:07] was there
[1:05:09] in other words the approach meant that
[1:05:14] the feelings of disapproval
[1:05:18] they were surrounded by the field
[1:05:21] the feelings of disapproval
[1:05:25] and resentment
[1:05:30] people hated them
[1:05:34] they did
[1:05:37] people might be friendly but their
[1:05:39] spirits
[1:05:40] cried out against them
[1:05:43] and we are this people
[1:05:46] we we are this People Israel
[1:05:51] okay you you would think that that
[1:05:54] we would be free to
[1:05:58] raise our children
[1:06:01] the way that we want to raise our
[1:06:03] children
[1:06:04] but you know that is trying to be robbed
[1:06:07] from us
[1:06:09] I I couldn't believe it a brother shared
[1:06:12] with me he said you won't believe this
[1:06:13] so he sends me the link
[1:06:16] and and there's
[1:06:20] States and and different groups of
[1:06:24] lawmakers and cities and different
[1:06:27] things they want to be able to take your
[1:06:30] child
[1:06:33] and I forget
[1:06:36] whatever they
[1:06:38] call it something about trans gender uh
[1:06:44] thing and they want to be able to if if
[1:06:47] you're if your boy thinks he's a girl
[1:06:52] you know not that it's a mental problem
[1:06:56] and you think well could that be a
[1:06:59] mental problem yeah there are spirits
[1:07:01] out there church don't sit around
[1:07:03] and think that them Spirits aren't going
[1:07:06] to get on your kids
[1:07:11] they're going to come and talk to your
[1:07:13] daughters
[1:07:15] they're going to talk to them and say oh
[1:07:17] maybe I'm gay they're going to talk to
[1:07:21] your young men maybe I'm gay or I'm
[1:07:24] feeling this way that he is the author
[1:07:28] of confusion
[1:07:30] and that's why there's gender confusion
[1:07:36] and they created the confusion by
[1:07:40] creating such a lukewarm environment
[1:07:43] that men and women aren't separated
[1:07:47] and God's always been a separator he's
[1:07:50] always separated light from Darkness
[1:07:53] he's always made clear paths but when
[1:07:56] you delude it so bad that there's no
[1:07:59] more lines of Distinction
[1:08:05] there's no more definitions
[1:08:07] there's no more guidelines it just
[1:08:10] becomes a big Melting Pot of anything
[1:08:14] and you don't think those those
[1:08:16] confusions are are going to come
[1:08:22] oh say no question everything he'll
[1:08:26] question your marriage you'll question
[1:08:27] whether you married the right one you'll
[1:08:29] question does she love me does she not
[1:08:31] love me does she cook is she trying to
[1:08:34] poison them you know what I mean it
[1:08:37] don't matter
[1:08:41] because that's what he does he goes
[1:08:44] about like a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:08:46] he may devour
[1:08:49] and they want to be able to to create
[1:08:52] the confusion
[1:08:55] in your child's mind
[1:08:59] by not teaching them
[1:09:07] what a Mahala man treats a woman and
[1:09:10] they'll think of the whole my goodness
[1:09:16] if I said a woman belongs in the kitchen
[1:09:19] my goodness gracious
[1:09:21] uh
[1:09:25] I get taken right off YouTube
[1:09:32] I mean that used to be a common thing
[1:09:36] you used to be able to preach a woman
[1:09:38] belongs at home a woman needs to raise
[1:09:40] her children if they can afford it
[1:09:43] so what do they do they make everything
[1:09:45] so expensive
[1:09:49] I'm trying to tell you
[1:09:52] we are in captivity
[1:09:57] we might not think that but they want to
[1:10:00] take this kid without telling you
[1:10:04] foreign
[1:10:07] and train them
[1:10:11] how to make the transition
[1:10:14] they want to teach gender transition
[1:10:17] without the parents knowing it
[1:10:25] this is the Captivity you live in
[1:10:30] and if you ignore it
[1:10:35] it'll be on your doorstep
[1:10:38] and if you ignore it on your doorstep
[1:10:41] it'll be in your house
[1:10:43] and one day one of your kids is going to
[1:10:46] come up and say Mommy I want to be a boy
[1:10:49] and you're going to wonder where in the
[1:10:52] world did you get that from well mommy
[1:10:55] well your head was in the ground like an
[1:10:58] ostrich
[1:11:00] these people over here were showing me
[1:11:03] that I'd be a better boy Than a Woman
[1:11:11] oh don't you think that it's not going
[1:11:13] to affect you
[1:11:17] or don't you think that it gets your
[1:11:21] responsibility to care about the welfare
[1:11:27] of the church
[1:11:29] of Israel
[1:11:31] the children of Israel the children of
[1:11:34] God
[1:11:37] we are in a captivity now
[1:11:41] we are in a time in a society where the
[1:11:45] Angel of Darkness
[1:11:48] who is the power of the air the
[1:11:51] principalities
[1:11:53] and spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:11:57] is what we are fighting
[1:12:00] and it's trying to rob us
[1:12:05] of our very sense
[1:12:10] of decency
[1:12:12] to where now if we draw a line we're the
[1:12:17] criminal worthy immoral one we're the
[1:12:21] one that doesn't have love
[1:12:23] so it's no longer God first
[1:12:28] foreign
[1:12:33] loyalty to our heritage
[1:12:38] and and in this great book of Nehemiah
[1:12:41] that's one of the things that we begin
[1:12:44] to understand is that they were
[1:12:46] concerned about their heritage
[1:12:51] they were concerned about what they were
[1:12:54] built on they were concerned about their
[1:12:57] election they were concerned about the
[1:13:00] law and the word that they live by the
[1:13:03] keeping the Sabbath keeping the holy
[1:13:05] days keeping the dress codes
[1:13:08] keeping the sacrifices
[1:13:11] that meant something to them
[1:13:16] doesn't mean something to us
[1:13:23] they don't want to stay too long on that
[1:13:25] but that's got me fired up
[1:13:33] the welfare of the children
[1:13:36] of Israel
[1:13:39] now we know that Nehemiah went
[1:13:45] back because he was concerned about the
[1:13:49] conditions
[1:13:50] and we don't need to go we went through
[1:13:52] that earlier how that he went out and he
[1:13:54] went by night and he looked at
[1:13:56] everything and everything and I I
[1:14:02] looked something up and I I sat back and
[1:14:05] I I couldn't believe it so I was going
[1:14:08] to say I'm not going to read this
[1:14:10] because I don't know if I believe it
[1:14:12] myself
[1:14:13] so I asked my phone you know that lady
[1:14:17] that knows everything
[1:14:19] I never thought I'd find anybody that
[1:14:21] knew any better than what I knew right
[1:14:23] but boy she she'll tell you right quick
[1:14:26] I said how long was the wall
[1:14:29] that Nehemiah built does anybody have an
[1:14:33] active phone I know you all turn them
[1:14:34] off you have a phone on you
[1:14:37] okay good
[1:14:40] will you asking
[1:14:42] so I asked how long is the wall that
[1:14:45] Nehemiah built around Jerusalem
[1:14:49] and this little box told me that it was
[1:14:54] 4
[1:14:55] 000 and 18 meters
[1:15:01] I thought all right then I read the next
[1:15:05] line
[1:15:06] and they said it was 2
[1:15:10] 497 miles
[1:15:16] oh good
[1:15:20] 2.497 miles is that what it is
[1:15:24] 2.4 miles that's a lot of miles
[1:15:27] all right and it was eight feet thick
[1:15:34] I think it was 12 feet tall
[1:15:38] something like that like I said I don't
[1:15:40] have my thing I I looked at it I didn't
[1:15:43] believe it
[1:15:44] let me put it down
[1:15:47] but the amazing thing is it took 52 days
[1:15:50] to build
[1:15:55] 52 days to build
[1:15:58] let's read here in Nehemiah
[1:16:01] if we could
[1:16:04] down to the 17th verse
[1:16:16] and it says here he says then said I
[1:16:18] unto them
[1:16:21] you see the distress that we are in
[1:16:25] how Jerusalem lieth
[1:16:29] waste
[1:16:31] and the gates thereof are burned with
[1:16:33] fire
[1:16:34] come let us build up the wall of
[1:16:38] Jerusalem
[1:16:40] that we be no more a reproach
[1:16:44] you know there there was a a purpose
[1:16:48] for a wall
[1:16:51] and that's what we see what the the
[1:16:56] whole
[1:16:57] the whole voice of society now
[1:17:03] is no walls
[1:17:07] no walls
[1:17:09] we have free range
[1:17:11] that you can marry whoever you want to
[1:17:13] marry no we've got walls we don't
[1:17:16] interracially married
[1:17:21] it's not our heritage
[1:17:24] that ain't black against white that
[1:17:26] isn't frowned against yellow or pink
[1:17:29] against Blue
[1:17:31] that's none of that that's our
[1:17:33] inheritance each one of us God made us
[1:17:37] special
[1:17:40] made us elected he chose us what we
[1:17:43] would be there's not one people greater
[1:17:45] than another people well that's worldly
[1:17:48] nonsense that's economy
[1:17:51] that's Satan's division we don't have
[1:17:54] that division we live The Way We Live By
[1:17:57] God's word
[1:18:01] we got walls
[1:18:05] and when the walls are down there's no
[1:18:09] distinction
[1:18:12] there's no separation
[1:18:15] so and and what does a wall do a wall
[1:18:20] does two things it keeps people out
[1:18:25] and it keeps things in
[1:18:30] and we need to start having walls in our
[1:18:33] life
[1:18:36] we we build walls that are reproach
[1:18:46] it separates us from mixing
[1:18:49] in your own personal life you've got to
[1:18:52] have lines you've got to have walls
[1:18:55] you've got to have things you don't do
[1:18:58] we teach our young girls we don't smooch
[1:19:01] and kiss and Huggy buggy and all that
[1:19:03] stuff before marriage
[1:19:11] that's why we don't watch TV
[1:19:15] why we kick it out of our house
[1:19:20] parents plop those kids in front of
[1:19:22] those TVs and they just get all these
[1:19:25] cartoons and all this violence I forget
[1:19:28] not long ago there was a study that if a
[1:19:31] child watches two hours of cartoons in
[1:19:33] the morning they'll see I don't know if
[1:19:35] it was two or three or thousand acts of
[1:19:38] violence
[1:19:42] one character hitting the other one and
[1:19:44] carrying and throwing something in their
[1:19:46] face and all this hahaha slap stick
[1:19:49] comedy
[1:19:52] it's what what are we countering it with
[1:19:57] you've got to build a wall around your
[1:20:00] children
[1:20:03] when you have all these get-togethers
[1:20:07] and you let all your kids all run
[1:20:09] upstairs and all of them hang out and
[1:20:12] all the little kids and all the little
[1:20:14] boys Gary and everything well you better
[1:20:16] make sure they're not up there playing
[1:20:18] doctor
[1:20:23] oh
[1:20:24] would we'd rather talk about the
[1:20:26] Mysteries
[1:20:28] right we don't want to talk about Sin
[1:20:32] we don't want to talk about what the
[1:20:35] enemy's trying to do but the prophet of
[1:20:38] God said you will never become an
[1:20:39] invincible Army until you recognize the
[1:20:42] devil and every single one of his tricks
[1:20:51] you say you're talking about parents no
[1:20:53] I'm talking about teenagers I'm talking
[1:20:56] about young men
[1:20:57] your conversation the things you look at
[1:21:00] the places you go what kind of
[1:21:02] communication are you having with
[1:21:05] somebody
[1:21:09] you got to have walls
[1:21:12] you've got to have lines that you draw
[1:21:15] you've got to have places that you you
[1:21:17] stand up for because that's what keeps
[1:21:20] the approach out
[1:21:24] no you can't if you don't have a wall
[1:21:27] then you're subject to whatever feelings
[1:21:30] or disapproval or acknowledgment you
[1:21:33] have what is it caring whether the world
[1:21:37] likes me or not
[1:21:41] I want to follow this word
[1:21:44] I want to follow this message I don't
[1:21:47] want to let down the bars I don't want
[1:21:49] to let things I don't want to let Satan
[1:21:51] in
[1:21:52] I want to build things in my life
[1:21:56] blocks of virtue blocks of Good Works a
[1:22:01] pattern of Good Works things that I do
[1:22:04] habits that I have things that I engage
[1:22:07] in
[1:22:09] that build a wall around me and a hedge
[1:22:12] around me and keep him out and keep what
[1:22:15] I want in my life in
[1:22:22] why we read our Bible
[1:22:28] we read our Bible you can't read the
[1:22:30] message without reading the Bible
[1:22:32] because the message tells you to read
[1:22:35] the Bible
[1:22:38] you will never know that you have a
[1:22:41] scriptural message
[1:22:43] without seeing the message in the Bible
[1:22:48] our messenger took everything that he
[1:22:51] taught and he brought it back and he
[1:22:54] said it's right here but it's been
[1:22:57] sealed up
[1:23:00] and part of our part of what we received
[1:23:04] in this day was a man that was concerned
[1:23:07] for the church
[1:23:09] because the church didn't have any walls
[1:23:12] and because it didn't have any walls the
[1:23:15] goats were getting in and the goats were
[1:23:18] breeding with the sheep and it was
[1:23:20] producing a hybrid
[1:23:25] and he knew
[1:23:27] that in order to get this we got to
[1:23:30] separate them out
[1:23:33] we've got to call the elected out
[1:23:38] we have to have them circumcise their
[1:23:41] lives with holiness
[1:23:43] we've got to give them a word to live by
[1:23:47] an indwelling spirit
[1:23:50] or a revelation
[1:23:54] because the church is built on
[1:23:56] Revelation
[1:23:57] it's built on the people who has
[1:24:00] received the Revelation that God sent a
[1:24:03] man that was concerned about Israel
[1:24:10] and concerned about them
[1:24:16] Hallelujah
[1:24:20] we would have never been where we are
[1:24:23] this morning
[1:24:26] without William branley
[1:24:30] none of us are holy enough none of us
[1:24:33] are smart enough none of us are anointed
[1:24:36] enough
[1:24:39] it's like a man sent from the King
[1:24:43] to build the walls up in our life
[1:24:47] so we wouldn't have the reproach of the
[1:24:49] world on us
[1:24:54] we're a people
[1:24:57] we're not a religion
[1:25:00] we're inherited one to another we're
[1:25:03] part of one another our names were
[1:25:05] written on the book together we're
[1:25:08] brothers and sisters
[1:25:13] we have a culture of Our Own
[1:25:17] We Care One for another
[1:25:20] we're an elected people
[1:25:23] because God was going to have a people
[1:25:26] in this day
[1:25:28] that he was going to build into a statue
[1:25:31] of a perfect man that he was going to
[1:25:34] cap them off with Divine love and that
[1:25:37] they were going to be living and walking
[1:25:39] on this world as he walked in this world
[1:25:46] and they had separated themselves out
[1:25:49] that's why we believe the message
[1:25:54] because it's the truth
[1:25:59] so there had to be walls
[1:26:02] and that's what he said he said then I
[1:26:05] said unto them
[1:26:07] ye see the distress that we are in how
[1:26:11] Jerusalem lieth and waste what was
[1:26:14] Jerusalem Jerusalem was what they say to
[1:26:16] that they called it the city that God
[1:26:18] dwelt in
[1:26:23] we're talking in type right
[1:26:26] what what are we going to
[1:26:30] where are we going to live we're going
[1:26:32] to live in the what the New Jerusalem
[1:26:35] the city that comes down the city that
[1:26:38] John saw
[1:26:41] well there's not going to be
[1:26:43] day or night but he will be the light of
[1:26:45] the city
[1:26:48] it was a type of something that needed
[1:26:51] to be protected
[1:26:56] I'm asking you today are you protecting
[1:26:58] yourself
[1:27:01] husbands are you protecting your family
[1:27:07] young men are you protecting the sisters
[1:27:12] children are you protecting one another
[1:27:15] you understand you've got to protect you
[1:27:18] young sisters when you came to that 13
[1:27:21] 14 years old and boys start coming into
[1:27:25] your life I don't know why that happens
[1:27:26] but anyway and you got all that stuff
[1:27:29] going on in your life don't get back
[1:27:34] protect one another
[1:27:38] is some guy from the outside the wall
[1:27:41] starts flashing his big blue eyes at you
[1:27:49] you reach over to your sister huh
[1:27:54] he might be cute on the outside but in
[1:27:57] the inside he don't want to do nothing
[1:27:59] but to you but mess you up
[1:28:06] you say oh that's pretty strong
[1:28:07] preaching for Sunday morning look at
[1:28:09] he's doing it every day in the
[1:28:11] schoolyard he's doing it every day on
[1:28:14] the internet he's doing it every day
[1:28:16] don't think that you don't think how bad
[1:28:19] it is we thought they've got so much
[1:28:21] trouble on the internet with people
[1:28:25] getting in these chats and these texts
[1:28:28] older men running off with young girl
[1:28:30] pedophilers everywhere perversion
[1:28:33] everywhere you better build the wall
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:41] you can't lay in ruin
[1:28:47] if there's Rubble
[1:28:48] Build It Up
[1:28:55] he says
[1:28:59] let us build
[1:29:01] he says
[1:29:03] burn fresh he's come let us build up the
[1:29:06] walls of Jerusalem

[1:29:21] that we don't appear as hypocrites

[1:29:27] on what side of the wall we're going to
[1:29:30] live on
[1:29:33] where not everything can come in
[1:29:35] not everything comes in
[1:29:38] prophet of God preached a wonderful
[1:29:40] sermon on that called thinking men's
[1:29:42] filter
[1:29:46] the word filters that stuff out
[1:29:49] that sin nicotine that sin cancer
[1:29:55] he says I saw that he said the spirit
[1:29:57] said go pick it up he said I ain't
[1:29:59] picking that thing up
[1:30:01] and he went back and he picked it up
[1:30:03] said a thinking man's filter
[1:30:05] he said a man that smokes these isn't
[1:30:08] thinking at all
[1:30:12] you need to put some of these thoughts
[1:30:14] in your mind
[1:30:17] young girls protect one another

[1:30:57] any division
[1:30:58] if we die we're all gonna die if we go
[1:31:02] we're all gonna go
[1:31:05] that's what Abraham said I'm gonna go
[1:31:08] get locked he belongs to me let's take
[1:31:11] our plows and build them into swords
[1:31:13] let's go get the elect
[1:31:20] if we can't be honest
[1:31:22] we're not like the world ashamed to use
[1:31:25] certain words
[1:31:28] I can't even say he or she
[1:31:35] we say Shem
[1:31:42] how about it
[1:31:46] oh you can't do it
[1:31:48] you got to be careful you got to walk on
[1:31:50] pins and needles
[1:31:53] you think Jesus walked on pins and
[1:31:56] needles
[1:31:58] he's sitting at a feast
[1:32:00] all the rich rulers and everything all
[1:32:02] around right in the middle of the feast
[1:32:04] he jumps up and he says come unto me all
[1:32:07] ye that are heavy laden and I'll give
[1:32:09] you rest
[1:32:14] well they built walls let's just read
[1:32:16] this the next verse
[1:32:22] and he said then I told them of the hand
[1:32:24] of God which was good unto me as also
[1:32:28] the king's word
[1:32:30] that he had spoken unto me and they said
[1:32:34] let us rise up and build
[1:32:40] so they strengthened their hands for the
[1:32:44] good work
[1:32:47] in others they started making provisions
[1:32:52] you know it's just like you come to
[1:32:54] church and something that says and they
[1:32:57] put you under conviction or the Lord
[1:33:00] corrects you and you're going to say
[1:33:02] well I'm going to go make that right and
[1:33:05] the first time that someone invites you
[1:33:07] out for a Sonic hot dog
[1:33:12] that's gone
[1:33:15] the conviction lasts to the four-year
[1:33:21] it's not taken deep inside
[1:33:24] another you strengthen yourself they
[1:33:27] strengthen themselves to build they made
[1:33:30] Provisions they made changes
[1:33:33] they they when they said we're gonna
[1:33:36] build well they knew they had to go
[1:33:38] sharpen their chisels they had to go get
[1:33:40] their tools they had to rearrange their
[1:33:42] schedules they had to make they
[1:33:44] strengthened themselves in other words
[1:33:46] they made their life where they could do
[1:33:49] what they had purpose to do
[1:33:52] if you don't strengthen your life
[1:33:56] to make full proof of your ministry for
[1:34:00] you to follow the calling wherein God
[1:34:03] called you you know you can fool people
[1:34:05] with your personality so long you can
[1:34:08] fool people with your education but the
[1:34:10] elect knows when you're saying what the
[1:34:12] prophet says the elect knows when you're
[1:34:14] making up your own stuff
[1:34:18] it don't impress me
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:24] in ought not to impress you either
[1:34:27] there ought to be one voice that
[1:34:29] impresses you
[1:34:32] and that's a voice of God I I've
[1:34:34] listened to all kinds of anointing
[1:34:36] preachers I ain't seen one of them yet
[1:34:38] that can turn us back to the audience
[1:34:43] or say I see you right here
[1:34:49] that's what I follow
[1:34:52] that's what we follow
[1:34:55] because we've had a man come that was
[1:34:58] concerned about the bride Israel
[1:35:03] well we're anchoring you make Provisions
[1:35:06] to strengthen yourself you strengthen
[1:35:08] your home
[1:35:12] have family altar
[1:35:14] read the Bible together
[1:35:17] talk about the scripture
[1:35:19] listen to tapes
[1:35:23] you got to strengthen yourself
[1:35:27] what are you building
[1:35:32] what are you building
[1:35:36] when you get married you better find out
[1:35:38] right away what are you building
[1:35:46] me and Leslie had to make a decision
[1:35:48] what are we going to do
[1:35:51] we could have stayed where we're at
[1:35:54] I could have got a job and raised a
[1:35:57] family if
[1:35:58] and and prospered
[1:36:02] I could have went with them worked with
[1:36:04] my father and had a great portion of
[1:36:08] business
[1:36:10] there's a lot of things
[1:36:12] we could have done
[1:36:14] but we chose to move here
[1:36:18] and start a little work
[1:36:21] for the kingdom
[1:36:22] and we strengthen ourselves for the work
[1:36:26] we went through the thick and thin of it
[1:36:29] well we we had service
[1:36:32] where we had the piano player my family
[1:36:36] and one other person
[1:36:39] I know it is like to have three people
[1:36:41] show up to church
[1:36:45] they're not talking to me I'm talking
[1:36:46] about anybody that strengthens their
[1:36:49] life for the work
[1:36:51] they build the wall you know how there
[1:36:54] was 34 Towers on the wall
[1:36:57] 34 places that they looked out and they
[1:37:01] watched for the enemy not only did they
[1:37:04] watch out but they watched in
[1:37:08] do you have any Towers in your life
[1:37:11] you have any places that you get out
[1:37:14] there and you look out the welfare of
[1:37:16] your brothers how are they doing is
[1:37:18] somebody going through marriage trouble
[1:37:20] is somebody going through financial
[1:37:21] trouble and then you look out here and
[1:37:24] say oh the enemy's coming the enemy's
[1:37:26] coming
[1:37:27] all the time we know that if God don't
[1:37:30] watch the city
[1:37:33] we watch in vain
[1:37:37] the message without life is theology
[1:37:47] it's theology
[1:37:51] the word without manifestation is
[1:37:54] theology if the word don't become flesh
[1:38:01] it's just theology
[1:38:05] everybody's got theology
[1:38:09] we got theologians like you can't
[1:38:11] believe
[1:38:13] I like Paul
[1:38:15] he said I didn't come to you with
[1:38:16] enticing words of men or education
[1:38:21] I never use my education as Vindication
[1:38:25] that I know this and that because I've
[1:38:27] got a PhD
[1:38:29] he said one thing he said I was taught
[1:38:32] in the school of gamalia
[1:38:34] as a Pharisee
[1:38:37] you know perfect in every way and you
[1:38:40] know what I'd count it all he says I
[1:38:43] count it all as done
[1:38:44] for the kingdom of God
[1:38:47] without Revelation it doesn't do me one
[1:38:49] good thing
[1:38:51] you'll never impress
[1:38:54] somebody that's uneducated with their
[1:38:57] education
[1:38:59] because they wonder why you went through
[1:39:01] all that in the first place
[1:39:06] really
[1:39:08] I know a lot of people that make more
[1:39:10] money than doctors make
[1:39:12] because they know how to run a shovel
[1:39:15] or run a bulldozer
[1:39:17] I'm not against education just because I
[1:39:20] don't have any don't make that I don't
[1:39:22] have anything that's why when you want
[1:39:24] to talk with me let's talk about the
[1:39:26] word
[1:39:28] then I don't have to talk about
[1:39:31] other stuff
[1:39:32] I don't want to talk about other stuff
[1:39:37] 34 Towers in this wall
[1:39:41] that's something huh
[1:39:47] man I can't believe 52 days
[1:39:51] you think they had a mind to work
[1:39:54] you think they strengthen themselves to
[1:39:56] get the job done
[1:39:59] we could get a lot more done in our
[1:40:02] spiritual lives
[1:40:04] if we would strengthen our hand to work
[1:40:09] you want to grow spiritually set aside
[1:40:13] time to read your Bible set aside time
[1:40:15] to read a book set a time aside for
[1:40:19] Fellowship set aside a time for prayer
[1:40:24] but if you don't strengthen yourself to
[1:40:26] the work
[1:40:29] you don't have the endurance
[1:40:33] to get through
[1:40:37] and you know while you're young
[1:40:39] and you've got the strength work hard
[1:40:45] get as far away from the world as you
[1:40:47] can
[1:40:48] because when you get older you don't
[1:40:50] have the strength that you used to have
[1:40:53] you better have built yourself a
[1:40:55] lifestyle
[1:40:58] that's so far away from the world
[1:41:02] that you can't be sucked back into it
[1:41:05] because you've got no desire for it
[1:41:07] you've got no association with it you've
[1:41:10] got no openings no places to return to
[1:41:14] it you haven't left a provision for you
[1:41:16] to go back to the world you don't have
[1:41:19] an Escape Plan
[1:41:23] we know about the Escape Plan
[1:41:26] what were they called The Escape planist
[1:41:29] ananias and Sapphira
[1:41:33] they had an Escape Plan
[1:41:37] why lie to the Holy Spirit
[1:41:41] you don't think he knows if you're not
[1:41:43] sincere you don't think he knows if you
[1:41:45] don't want to live this life you don't
[1:41:48] think he knows you're looking for a way
[1:41:49] out
[1:41:54] and again to young people you don't
[1:41:57] understand what I believe you don't
[1:41:59] understand what makes me the way I am
[1:42:00] come talk to me
[1:42:03] ask your parents can I go talk to Mother
[1:42:05] McGarry I have some questions I'd like
[1:42:08] to ask them I'd like to know the
[1:42:09] scripture or sit down and talk to your
[1:42:11] dad
[1:42:13] or your mom
[1:42:15] wouldn't it be some some teenager comes
[1:42:17] up and says mom and dad I'd like to talk
[1:42:19] to you but you're so backslid
[1:42:23] no they wouldn't say that
[1:42:26] because they're good kids
[1:42:29] that their brain might be going a mile a
[1:42:31] minute
[1:42:36] you want to pop that TV up in front of
[1:42:38] your kid shame on you
[1:42:40] amen
[1:42:43] you ain't got no wall
[1:42:46] you might as well open the door say Mr
[1:42:48] devil
[1:42:50] please come in at my house and pervert
[1:42:52] my children
[1:42:56] Billy Graham screamed out against I Love
[1:42:59] Lucy
[1:43:03] you know why she was The Voice
[1:43:06] for the independence of women in America
[1:43:13] she did what she wanted to do she lied
[1:43:16] and schemed and made her husband look
[1:43:19] like a fool
[1:43:24] wives never never never talk about your
[1:43:28] husbands
[1:43:30] never never never never never never
[1:43:37] talk about your husbands to another
[1:43:39] sister
[1:43:43] whatever he's done wrong talking about
[1:43:46] it is five times the evil
[1:43:51] never expose his weakness
[1:43:54] never expose your discontent
[1:44:02] don't ever do it
[1:44:04] it's poison
[1:44:06] build a wall
[1:44:08] Bridle the tongue
[1:44:12] be sincere
[1:44:15] always remember you're the one who
[1:44:17] married them
[1:44:23] husbands likewise love your wives
[1:44:25] as Christ loved the church
[1:44:28] protector keep things out don't let
[1:44:31] stuff in don't make her your part
[1:44:33] partner in backsliding
[1:44:43] young men before you get married you
[1:44:45] better have these principles down in
[1:44:47] your life
[1:44:48] you ought to know exactly what you're
[1:44:50] going to do for her exactly how you're
[1:44:52] going to take care of her and I'm not
[1:44:54] saying you've got to get a college
[1:44:56] degree before you can get married I
[1:44:59] don't know who instilled that in people
[1:45:04] I was Dumber in a fence post when Leslie
[1:45:06] married me
[1:45:08] and then she taught me a few things
[1:45:15] these are things we got to have down now
[1:45:18] amen
[1:45:20] because we're going forward
[1:45:23] so and so we got to strengthen their
[1:45:26] hands for the work they yeah and they
[1:45:30] were sure they were laughed at they were
[1:45:32] mocked why is the world going to do it
[1:45:34] because the world don't do it
[1:45:36] you know what the world's plan is for
[1:45:38] everything divorce
[1:45:43] we put 20 years into a marriage 15 years
[1:45:47] into a marriage five I mean if you put a
[1:45:49] five months into a marriage it's worth
[1:45:51] working on it's worth keeping
[1:45:55] it's worth sitting down and let's find
[1:45:57] out you can't let two minds
[1:46:01] grow up in a household
[1:46:04] you can't have two different Minds a
[1:46:06] double-minded man is unstable in all its
[1:46:10] ways
[1:46:11] if you're having conflict you got to sit
[1:46:13] down you got to get on the same page you
[1:46:16] got to find out what your objectives are
[1:46:18] what are we doing here
[1:46:21] I'm your help mate
[1:46:24] I'm here to help you husband in this
[1:46:26] world that's wicked out there I'm here
[1:46:28] for you
[1:46:31] we don't have this conversation you stay
[1:46:34] home dear and do the dishes because I'm
[1:46:36] going to go pursue my career
[1:46:39] you got two different Minds
[1:46:42] that's the world out there
[1:46:47] it's a world that got us to work on
[1:46:49] Sundays it's a world that's God is still
[1:46:52] look everything Through The Eyes of
[1:46:54] dollar bills and finance
[1:47:00] but we're we're surrounding Jerusalem
[1:47:04] We're The Dwelling Place of the Living
[1:47:07] God
[1:47:09] this is where God dwells in this hour is
[1:47:12] in the flesh of his bride it was the
[1:47:15] word made flesh now it's flesh being
[1:47:18] made word
[1:47:21] we're a people that in this last day is
[1:47:24] supposed to be Capstone and having the
[1:47:26] very love of God shed abroad in our
[1:47:29] heart by the Holy Spirit
[1:47:31] that's the kind of people we are
[1:47:33] loving caring
[1:47:38] and if we start letting these things
[1:47:40] slip it's because our Wall's not built
[1:47:45] and I'll be the first to say I had lots
[1:47:48] of holes in my walls
[1:47:51] and my kids suffered a lot of things
[1:47:53] from it
[1:47:55] because I didn't have the understanding
[1:47:58] there wasn't a voice
[1:48:01] that cried out
[1:48:05] then I'd like to finish this morning
[1:48:08] with the first verse of the third
[1:48:10] chapter
[1:48:13] School

[1:48:29] them

[1:48:34] they wanted part of the action
[1:48:37] and this is what he said then answered
[1:48:39] by them and said unto them the god of
[1:48:41] Heaven he will prosper us

[1:49:10] that we're a people we're teaching our
[1:49:12] children

[1:49:18] we're telling them about the pillar of
[1:49:21] fire we're telling them about the cloud

[1:49:28] the seals

[1:49:41] therefore we his servants
[1:49:45] will rise and build
[1:49:50] we his servants
[1:49:52] where this is not nickelatianism

[1:51:28] all the churches we have our epistle
[1:51:31] today
[1:51:33] the Epistle of our age is those tapes
[1:51:37] and the scriptures
[1:51:39] he said let it be red let it be played
[1:51:42] in all the churches
[1:51:45] not just the homes
[1:51:48] all the church that's the word of the
[1:51:50] Lord
[1:51:52] go read it for yourself
[1:51:55] that's what he said
[1:51:57] the anointings on the tapes
[1:52:01] we're not trying to keep the anointing
[1:52:03] out of the church
[1:52:05] we're trying to get the anointing in the
[1:52:08] church we're trying to get the anointing
[1:52:10] for this hour into the church and the
[1:52:13] anointing of this hour is that the works
[1:52:16] that I do you shall do also not the
[1:52:20] service not the church service not the
[1:52:24] camp meeting which it's good that it's
[1:52:26] there I'm all for it I love praising the
[1:52:29] Lord praise God I love it amen I love to
[1:52:32] run if we could
[1:52:35] we have Jericho mouches today if we
[1:52:38] wasn't tripping over the chairs
[1:52:41] but it's you
[1:52:48] now we're going to close
[1:52:51] then
[1:52:54] then
[1:52:56] a
[1:52:58] Eli Smith
[1:52:59] the high priest rose up
[1:53:03] with his brethren
[1:53:06] the priest
[1:53:08] and they built the Sheep gate
[1:53:12] and sacrificed it
[1:53:14] and set up the doors of it
[1:53:17] even unto the tower
[1:53:20] of mihai they sacrificed it unto the
[1:53:24] Tower of
[1:53:26] him
[1:53:28] anilia
[1:53:30] and I thought this was very tremendous
[1:53:34] to me
[1:53:36] and it struck me
[1:53:40] that
[1:53:42] if we would type
[1:53:45] Jerusalem
[1:53:47] to the church
[1:53:50] right
[1:53:51] to the people that we are
[1:53:54] to the Heritage and inheritance that we
[1:53:58] have
[1:53:59] the first thing they built
[1:54:02] was
[1:54:04] the Sheep gate
[1:54:07] and I thought isn't that really the
[1:54:10] first thing when the Lord built his
[1:54:12] church
[1:54:13] that he built was the gate for the Sheep
[1:54:17] to come in
[1:54:22] the first thing we build in our lives is
[1:54:25] Christian is the Sheep gate
[1:54:30] we build a gate
[1:54:32] or we build an entrance
[1:54:35] that people can come in
[1:54:40] and hear and receive
[1:54:44] what we have to offer
[1:54:48] in your in your family life in your
[1:54:51] raising of your family in your lifestyle
[1:54:54] you should always have a gate open
[1:54:59] in your life
[1:55:01] that people can enter in and hear of the
[1:55:04] fellowship and the hope that you have in
[1:55:08] your heart
[1:55:10] when you're on school and you go to
[1:55:12] school your life ought to have a gate in
[1:55:15] it
[1:55:18] a sheep gate where someone that has
[1:55:21] troubles or someone that has trials or
[1:55:24] somebody that needs prayer that that you
[1:55:27] have a a gate that's open that welcomes
[1:55:31] them in
[1:55:34] sometimes we button up our lives so
[1:55:37] tight that nobody knows where you are
[1:55:40] what you're thinking where you've been
[1:55:41] where you're going and who you are and
[1:55:43] who you're with
[1:55:45] and anything else I missed
[1:55:50] we don't have any entrance
[1:55:53] into our feelings
[1:55:56] no entrance into our burdens
[1:56:01] we've got we got our lives
[1:56:04] so
[1:56:06] shut up
[1:56:08] that we find him on the outside
[1:56:12] knocking
[1:56:14] to try to come in
[1:56:16] all of our Lives ought to have an open
[1:56:18] gate in it somewhere
[1:56:23] the first thing he built was the Sheep
[1:56:25] gate
[1:56:26] a place for people to come in a place
[1:56:29] for the Sheep to come in a place that
[1:56:32] they could come into the safety
[1:56:35] of the wall that's being built the first
[1:56:37] gate was the Sheep gate
[1:56:40] I thought that was significant
[1:56:43] I thought I thought how important it is
[1:56:45] that the first thing he said is go into
[1:56:48] all the world and preach the gospel
[1:56:52] make an entrance for him
[1:56:56] and I thought you know what
[1:56:59] I know we're building this church over
[1:57:01] here that's good
[1:57:03] you'll have more room to see it
[1:57:06] if you'll have more bathrooms to use
[1:57:08] you'll have more doors to escape by
[1:57:15] all those things are good but if we
[1:57:17] don't have an entrance
[1:57:19] for lost sheep
[1:57:21] if we don't have a spirit
[1:57:24] that invites
[1:57:27] those from without
[1:57:30] to be able to come in and taste of the
[1:57:33] transforming power of God
[1:57:37] the gate is an attitude
[1:57:41] the gate is in atmosphere
[1:57:44] the gate is a heartbeat
[1:57:47] that you've freely received and you
[1:57:51] freely want to give
[1:57:53] a gate the Sheep gate has no judgment in
[1:57:58] it
[1:58:03] we don't accept sin
[1:58:07] we're not against The Sinner
[1:58:10] we're against the devil that has them in
[1:58:13] captivity
[1:58:15] and we want them to know that there's a
[1:58:17] gate open there's a gate in fact I think
[1:58:21] it's beautiful let's just turn in
[1:58:22] closing to Peter
[1:58:27] second Peter
[1:58:30] I believe it's 111.
[1:58:51] this is after Peter talks about this the
[1:58:54] Great
[1:58:56] statue of a perfect man
[1:58:59] he comes down and he comes to the 10th
[1:59:02] verse he says
[1:59:04] wherefore the rather brethren
[1:59:07] give diligence
[1:59:09] to make your calling an election sure
[1:59:13] and there's give diligence to Build That
[1:59:16] Wall
[1:59:17] in your life
[1:59:18] that makes your election and calling
[1:59:20] sure for if ye do these things ye shall
[1:59:24] never
[1:59:27] fall
[1:59:29] what a promise
[1:59:31] are you fallen all the time are you
[1:59:34] stumbling all the time the minute
[1:59:36] something comes on you're just so
[1:59:38] curious It's got such a draw in your
[1:59:41] flesh that you just keep stumbling for
[1:59:43] it and you find those times in your life
[1:59:45] you don't have nothing going on so your
[1:59:48] mind starts going wild and the devil's
[1:59:50] in there building bird nests and all
[1:59:53] that stuff
[1:59:54] you got to strengthen yourself for the
[1:59:56] work
[1:59:58] you got to say I got to fight that thing
[2:00:02] I'm going to grab my Bible I'm going to
[2:00:04] press a book I'm going to pray I'm going
[2:00:07] to I'm going to turn away I'm going to
[2:00:08] make an effort I'm in a fight
[2:00:11] I'm going to add virtue
[2:00:14] I'm going to build on my faith I'm going
[2:00:16] to add these things in my life he says
[2:00:19] you'll never fall
[2:00:24] Hallelujah
[2:00:27] we're a people
[2:00:29] that can come to the place that we don't
[2:00:32] fall
[2:00:36] and when he tries to come in we push him
[2:00:39] back
[2:00:40] we possess the gates of our enemy
[2:00:45] we can do that
[2:00:48] he doesn't have to rule us
[2:00:51] he doesn't have to defeat us we can
[2:00:55] drive sickness out
[2:00:59] we can play claim to our children
[2:01:02] our kids can get the spirit of God
[2:01:06] and know it's real
[2:01:08] with or without sensation
[2:01:12] even though the mystery for this age is
[2:01:15] to be able to receive the Holy Spirit
[2:01:16] without sensation why because it's
[2:01:19] coming from within that seed within is
[2:01:22] sprouting up by Revelation but live what
[2:01:25] Peter says he says
[2:01:28] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[2:01:31] diligence to make your calling in the
[2:01:34] election sure for if ye do these things
[2:01:37] ye shall never fall
[2:01:42] for an entrance
[2:01:45] shall be ministered unto unto you
[2:01:49] abundantly
[2:01:51] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[2:01:55] and Savior Jesus Christ
[2:01:59] an entrance
[2:02:01] has been ministered to us a sheep gate
[2:02:07] has been ministered to us that we can
[2:02:10] come into the everlasting life and
[2:02:13] presence of Our Lord isn't that a
[2:02:16] beautiful scripture
[2:02:18] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[2:02:22] of Our Lord that Kingdom's here
[2:02:27] there's been an entrance been made
[2:02:29] there's been a man that's come
[2:02:33] who was interested in the welfare of the
[2:02:36] church and he made an entrance
[2:02:39] for us to enter in at that gate into the
[2:02:42] Everlasting kingdom of God and it has
[2:02:45] been freely given freely give
[2:02:48] the first thing they made was the gate
[2:02:52] that those without could come in
[2:02:56] and eat
[2:02:58] of the Tree of Life
[2:03:02] oh my
[2:03:06] not only do we have to have that gate as
[2:03:09] a church
[2:03:10] but we have to have that gate as an
[2:03:12] individual
[2:03:15] is that gate nailed shut with
[2:03:17] embarrassment
[2:03:20] is it nailed shut with what people think
[2:03:24] have they nailed it shut with reproach
[2:03:29] don't be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[2:03:32] Christ it's the power of God for
[2:03:34] salvation
[2:03:38] it's been freely given to you he made an
[2:03:40] entrance for you
[2:03:43] that's why you show people the gate
[2:03:46] this is the way in
[2:03:49] repent
[2:03:51] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:03:54] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[2:03:56] gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:59] there's a way there's an entrance
[2:04:03] you're on the outside you want to be on
[2:04:06] the inside
[2:04:07] you want to invite him into the kingdom
[2:04:10] you want to invite him into the city
[2:04:13] an entrance has been made for us
[2:04:18] just think no matter where you're at
[2:04:20] there's an entrance made for you this
[2:04:22] morning
[2:04:23] that you can come in
[2:04:26] and he knows what you have need of
[2:04:29] even before you asked I I just thought
[2:04:32] that was marvelous the first thing that
[2:04:34] they built the priest they built the
[2:04:37] Sheep gate to where the sacrifice and
[2:04:40] the offering
[2:04:41] and the life
[2:04:43] could come
[2:04:45] the Forgiveness of sins
[2:04:49] aren't you glad for the Forgiveness of
[2:04:52] sins
[2:04:54] our righteousness is as filthy rags
[2:04:58] but his righteousness is life and peace
[2:05:05] and I close with this this morning
[2:05:09] who were these people
[2:05:11] Israel
[2:05:13] who was this People Israel
[2:05:16] they were the elect
[2:05:18] children
[2:05:20] of God
[2:05:22] Bound by captivity surrounded by the
[2:05:26] world
[2:05:28] and yet built wall
[2:05:31] to keep the reproach out
[2:05:33] and they shared that Glory
[2:05:36] only to the Lord
[2:05:39] because the Lord is the provider
[2:05:41] the Lord is my strength
[2:05:44] his rod and his staff they comfort me
[2:05:48] though I go through the valley of the
[2:05:50] shadow of death I'll fear no evil

[2:25:09] scriptures found in the book of Acts
[2:25:12] on the day of Pentecost when the spirit
[2:25:14] of God came down
[2:25:16] and the disciples once again felt the
[2:25:19] presence of the Lord Jesus with them
[2:25:21] not only with them but they felt him in
[2:25:25] them
[2:25:26] What a Feeling amen how many remember
[2:25:30] that day
[2:25:32] Hallelujah
[2:25:33] and it said
[2:25:35] he said therefore let all the house of
[2:25:38] Israel know it surely
[2:25:40] that God hath made the same Jesus whom
[2:25:45] ye have crucified both Lord and Christ
[2:25:48] now when they heard this they were
[2:25:51] pricked in their heart and said unto
[2:25:53] Peter and the rest of the Apostles men
[2:25:57] and Brethren what shall we do
[2:26:00] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[2:26:03] baptized every one of you in the name of
[2:26:07] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[2:26:10] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:26:14] Holy Ghost what a promise for the
[2:26:17] promise is unto you
[2:26:21] and unto Gabrielle and your children
[2:26:25] and to all that are far off even as many

[2:27:01] and baptize them in the name of the
[2:27:04] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
