[40:19] [Music]
[40:20] amen you know the angel
[40:23] that death angel that visited Egypt that
[40:26] night
[40:27] it wasn't how big your head was
[40:30] hearing it
[40:31] but I trust that the Lord will help you
[40:34] to catch my accent
[40:36] amen
[40:38] us Brother David was saying uh
[40:43] I was born and uh
[40:46] some bizarre circumstances in a village
[40:49] where I was raised up in that part of
[40:51] Ghana
[40:53] uh at that time there was this some of
[40:57] you may have heard that testimony before
[40:58] if you have forgive me for that
[41:02] it so happened that there was
[41:05] inter-tribal war
[41:07] they tell me that during that war
[41:10] um uh
[41:12] my ancestors were hiding away in a cave
[41:16] and this Hunter
[41:20] who was a knife
[41:22] of his father's children
[41:25] he was sent to hunt for food or handful
[41:28] deer or something for for the Warriors
[41:32] instead he betrayed them to their
[41:35] enemies I don't know how he did it and
[41:38] so from that time when they succeeded in
[41:41] defeating the enemies they decided that
[41:44] the knife child should not live
[41:47] so they started killing them and giving
[41:50] them away and different things and
[41:53] happened to be my parents ninth child at
[41:56] that time
[41:58] so I should have been killed but there
[42:01] was a concession
[42:02] if you gave your child as a gift to God
[42:06] in the church then they will not kill
[42:08] that child so my mother took advantage
[42:11] of it and donated me as a gift to God in
[42:14] the Roman Catholic Church
[42:16] and children that were given to God as a
[42:20] gift were called Miami
[42:22] is a local name for God and she is a
[42:27] gift so that's how I came by that name
[42:31] yummy
[42:33] given to God so I thought that the
[42:37] Catholic church was my savior and I was
[42:40] a very devoted Catholic
[42:42] and in those days we did everything in
[42:45] Latin
[42:46] and if I went to church and the holy
[42:49] water they sprinkled if I didn't get any
[42:52] drops of holy water on me that day will
[42:56] be fasting and crying out so devoted but
[43:00] I thank God I was to be a Catholic
[43:03] priest I was waiting for this country
[43:05] priest to come take me from the village
[43:08] and then begin their training he never
[43:11] came I thank God he didn't
[43:15] but along the line I heard the gospel of
[43:18] the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:19] and I gave my heart to him that was 23rd
[43:23] December 1967.
[43:25] and I've never regretted doing that
[43:29] praise be to God
[43:32] uh so uh how did I get into the message
[43:35] I was the leader of a Christian
[43:37] Fellowship called scripture Union in my
[43:39] country
[43:40] it was a Christian a kind of society
[43:44] where people from different churches
[43:47] will meet and study the Bible together
[43:49] and I was a leader and I was choosing to
[43:52] represent my school during a conference
[43:56] and I had this man from Switzerland
[44:02] he he used a flanner graph and had a
[44:06] cross Red Cross and then he read
[44:09] Galatians chapter 5
[44:10] and then he would take a
[44:13] the scenes listed over there these
[44:16] things crucified Jesus he was take one
[44:18] day it was like
[44:20] like piercing my heart each time he
[44:23] stuck one day it was like piercing my
[44:25] heart so when he was through with the
[44:27] sermon and in through the invitation I
[44:30] was right there I cried my way to
[44:32] Calvary
[44:33] cried my way to glory and then after
[44:37] that I wasn't feeling comfortable in the
[44:39] Catholic church I had not heard anything
[44:42] about the prophet or anything
[44:44] and so I I wasn't feeling comfortable we
[44:48] started witnessing in the Catholic
[44:50] Church
[44:50] so the categies the Catholic categies
[44:53] came an arrest and told me if you want
[44:57] to bring a chain go and start from Rome
[45:00] you can bring a change in the Catholic
[45:02] church start from Rome
[45:04] so they kicked us out I had a friend of
[45:07] mine so we didn't know which church to
[45:09] attend so I started waiting on the Lord
[45:12] fasting and praying then we had two
[45:15] missionaries from America
[45:18] that attended an all-night prayer
[45:21] meeting we had organized they came over
[45:24] I don't know whoever had invited them
[45:26] but they came over and testified of of
[45:29] God sending a prophet
[45:31] and uh but we had been warned in that
[45:34] society that a prophet a so-called
[45:39] Prophet arose in America and claimed to
[45:41] be Jesus Christ
[45:43] but God let him have an accident so that
[45:47] you know he had his bones broken so that
[45:51] is you will know he's not Jesus Christ
[45:54] so when they testified of this Prophet I
[45:59] I I couldn't go they were giving away
[46:02] books and tapes but I never went because
[46:05] I thought that that was the first
[46:08] prophet or something
[46:10] a friend of mine might have gone and he
[46:12] got a hold of some of the emergency
[46:14] books but when a teacher training school
[46:18] and like I guess the grammar was so
[46:21] horrible they threw the book Away
[46:24] and I happened to pick one of them on
[46:28] the ground and the title was very
[46:30] intriguing it's doing God a service
[46:35] not according to his will
[46:38] I had just been re-baptized in a in a
[46:42] Pentecostal Church the titles of fathers
[46:45] and Holy Ghost
[46:47] uh it so happened that I used to wake
[46:50] people up so that we could pray together
[46:53] and I was praying with this brother and
[46:55] the Holy Ghost fell on him he started
[46:57] speaking in tongues and the
[46:59] interpretation said go and be
[47:01] re-baptized for the Catholic baptism
[47:03] infant baptism is false so we come
[47:07] through the city of Kumasi looking for
[47:09] somebody to baptize me or what I knew at
[47:13] that time was immersion not the name I
[47:16] didn't know about the name but the
[47:17] immersion so we got this Pentecostal
[47:20] Pastor he said the only way he will uh
[47:24] he would be able to baptize me is to
[47:27] write my name in their Church book I
[47:29] said I don't care what you do with my
[47:31] name just so that I get the baptism
[47:34] so you take care of the name and now on
[47:36] my baptism so he did that and then I got
[47:39] my baptism but that was the same week
[47:42] that we had this uh all night and this
[47:45] man came and testified and then uh um I
[47:50] picked this book on the ground I read
[47:53] through it
[47:55] said I missed it I called the Revelation
[47:57] it should have been in the name of the
[48:00] Lord Jesus Christ I said I missed it
[48:03] again
[48:05] and for two solid years I was looking
[48:09] for somebody that could baptize me in
[48:12] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[48:14] couldn't find any
[48:16] so I wrote a letter dear brother Branham
[48:21] I had just have just been re-baptized in
[48:26] a Pentecostal Church in the titles of
[48:28] father son Holy Ghost I got a hold of
[48:31] your book titled doing got a service not
[48:35] according to Israel and I found out that
[48:38] it should have been in the name of the
[48:39] Lord Jesus Christ I missed it again so
[48:42] how do I get somebody to baptize me in
[48:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:47] I didn't know brother I might pass on
[48:49] you know so I waited waited and then
[48:52] after a while Billy Paul wrote back and
[48:54] he said
[48:55] brother Brown I'm mistaken away to be
[48:58] with the Lord but the message he brought
[49:00] is still true
[49:02] I hope that some way God will make a way
[49:04] for you to be baptized so he started
[49:07] sending me tips and books tips and books
[49:10] and I lived on the tips and books for so
[49:13] long and then there was this brother
[49:16] called Tommy Dillard who used to be from
[49:19] Fort Wayne Indiana he came over to our
[49:22] country as a missionary so Brad Billy
[49:24] Paul wrote to tell me get over to him
[49:27] and that was over a long distance a lot
[49:30] and the rules terrible but I took my mom
[49:34] and my nephew and my mother are just uh
[49:40] the night before the baptism
[49:42] the Lord opened their eyes and she she
[49:45] saw Visions a whole lot of things so we
[49:49] got down and got baptized in the name of
[49:51] the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:53] and that was 1970 and uh
[49:58] I I kept I started preaching the the
[50:01] message of the hour right away and after
[50:05] teaching uh
[50:07] or at the middle level in my country for
[50:10] 10 years I felt the need to resign and
[50:13] be committed to the uh Ministry only and
[50:17] that's what I did it was a very
[50:19] difficult decision you had just a
[50:23] handful of people but I will tell you
[50:25] friends
[50:27] God is faithful
[50:30] he is provided and then he's been able
[50:33] he blessed me I got married and got five
[50:37] sons and and two daughters and Susie is
[50:41] here
[50:42] and I thank God for his Amazing Grace
[50:47] just uh before the lockdown
[50:54] I got to a point I started feeling
[50:57] terrible uh
[51:00] uh
[51:02] dizziness or vertigo
[51:05] very terrible case and it was increasing
[51:09] day by day
[51:11] no treatment nothing was helping so on
[51:16] November 21st last about two years ago
[51:21] I think it was 2020
[51:23] yeah 2020 November 21st I also rushed
[51:27] the emergency
[51:29] and they did uh CT scan and found out it
[51:34] was subdural Hema tumor that's aneurysm
[51:41] blood flowing into your brain filling up
[51:45] every day so they did uh they ran all
[51:50] kinds of tests and they found out that
[51:52] the the rate of blood coagulation was
[51:56] bad so they couldn't do the surgery
[51:59] immediately meanwhile the blood was
[52:01] still filling up
[52:03] they won they couldn't do it
[52:06] my veins had collapsed they were not
[52:08] getting a sample blood samples and the
[52:13] the next day the same thing the third
[52:16] day and it was increasing and getting
[52:18] worse and I realized I was just passing
[52:21] out
[52:21] they will come to the uh special world
[52:25] where I was admitted to raise your right
[52:28] hand I will raise it up raise your left
[52:31] hand I'll raise it up they were
[52:33] expecting that with that rate of inflow
[52:37] of blood
[52:39] uh should be paralyzed or something but
[52:42] I had no outward symptom
[52:44] and the uh they felt that if they took
[52:48] me to the theater and I came back west
[52:51] of it means they have done it so somehow
[52:54] they they didn't want to do
[52:57] the surgery and then I told them I I
[53:01] told them hey take me to the theater God
[53:04] will take care nothing will happen
[53:06] they had to give me uh 12 pints of blood
[53:12] and uh
[53:14] one of them uh
[53:16] uh they took I'm all negative and it was
[53:20] hard to get O negative uh that quantity
[53:24] of blood and so one of the uh one
[53:28] brother in our church made a donation
[53:32] a blood donation not knowing that
[53:37] he was cancerous
[53:40] but he didn't know at that time
[53:42] so the Lord was so gracious that when
[53:47] they they tried to uh use that blood
[53:50] because of the pressing nature of the
[53:53] situation the I don't know whether they
[53:56] would have found out that out or not but
[53:59] they were working on it and then somehow
[54:02] one way or the other the Lord made sure
[54:05] that that blood was not added to the
[54:08] rest
[54:09] and by the grace of God they did a
[54:12] surgery
[54:13] they had what they call Bear holes they
[54:16] drilled holes through the cranium
[54:19] why here and uh 600 mules of blood oozed
[54:23] out
[54:24] there was so much pressure built in the
[54:27] heart one here and they drilled another
[54:30] hole there and it was terrible
[54:34] but here are my Believers all over the
[54:37] world who are praying for me
[54:39] and by the grace of God here I stand
[54:49] don't tell me that God is not the same
[54:52] yesterday today and forever you are too
[54:55] late
[54:57] Hallelujah I know I have I've met him as
[55:01] a savior and I've met him as a Healer
[55:03] not just these ones but a few other
[55:06] times and I've seen him do my two Works
[55:09] amongst his children
[55:12] who would dare to believe him
[55:14] and I realized that it's all because
[55:18] Jesus came to establish a new covenant
[55:24] with his children
[55:27] and being a very faithful creator
[55:30] he will always keep his part of the
[55:35] Covenant
[55:36] and tonight I would like to exalt exalt
[55:39] a little on
[55:42] God's covenant people
[55:46] amen
[55:48] the idea of a covenant did not begin in
[55:51] the New Testament it began in the old we
[55:54] all know that don't we
[55:55] and God calling people here and there
[55:59] and then we want to begin with Abraham
[56:01] to cut it short the Lord called Abraham
[56:05] out of uh cardia out of Babylon amen
[56:09] confusion and was going to begin a new
[56:12] race of people with Abraham his first
[56:16] name we know was Abram
[56:19] hi Father
[56:22] up father
[56:25] but he didn't have children
[56:27] and then we know the story of how God
[56:30] promised that he was going to have
[56:31] children with his wife Sarah
[56:34] but it took 25 solid years for that
[56:37] promise to be fulfilled he had called
[56:39] him in Genesis chapter 12.
[56:43] and he had said before him terms of the
[56:47] Covenant that he was going to establish
[56:49] between him and Abraham and Abraham's
[56:53] seed amen not just Abraham
[56:56] but Abraham and his seed
[57:00] amen so we finally Genesis chapter 12
[57:03] and verse 3 down
[57:05] God
[57:07] spelling out
[57:09] the blessings that he was going to give
[57:11] Abraham if he obeyed his word
[57:14] shall we stand on our feet
[57:22] so I want to read Genesis 3.
[57:25] Genesis 12 3 very quickly and then we'll
[57:29] run through a few scriptures
[57:31] and to come to my climax
[57:34] so that we have time for the Lord's
[57:37] Supper and who you lay in the background
[57:39] for the reason why I believe
[57:45] Jesus Took the bread and he said this is
[57:50] my body broken for you and he took the
[57:53] cup he gave thanks
[57:55] they took the bread
[57:57] he blessed it but I took the cup and he
[58:00] gave thanks
[58:02] amen
[58:04] difference blessed but here he gave
[58:07] thanks that's Victory you give thanks
[58:11] after Victory okay so now the Lord has
[58:15] said unto Abraham get thee out of thy
[58:17] country
[58:19] from that Kindred from thy Father's
[58:21] House onto a land that I will show thee
[58:25] I will make of thee a great nation one a
[58:28] great nation
[58:30] I Will Bless thee amen and make thy name
[58:34] great
[58:35] you are a brown but I'm going to make
[58:37] that name great if I make it April
[58:41] him
[58:42] I add a portion of my hello him
[58:47] and I elevate your name
[58:49] from Abraham to Abraham him
[58:54] a great name
[58:57] amen
[58:58] so I will bless thee and make thy name
[59:02] great
[59:03] and thou shall be a blessing so it's not
[59:07] enough to be blessed but bless them
[59:09] oh hallelujah what a promise and I will
[59:14] bless them that bless thee
[59:16] amen
[59:19] encourage him The Curse Of Thee and
[59:23] indeed shall all families of the earth
[59:26] be blessed so God was going to do a very
[59:29] special something that will reverse the
[59:32] curse
[59:33] that came to humanity fall in the Garden
[59:36] of Eden and was going to do it through
[59:38] Abraham and his seed after him the Lord
[59:41] bless you as you take your seats and I
[59:43] keep standing
[59:44] foreign
[59:54] and the purpose was to restore men to
[59:57] the original beginning of relationship
[1:00:00] and fellowship and then he works with
[1:00:03] him in Chapter 13 when he had called him
[1:00:06] he did not call Lord but Lord had
[1:00:08] followed him and we all know brother
[1:00:10] Branham pray for us God's word calls for
[1:00:13] total separation from unbelief so Lord
[1:00:17] had to be separated from Abraham in
[1:00:20] order for the blessing to materialize
[1:00:23] and then we find Genesis chapter 14
[1:00:25] Abraham meeting Melchizedek Hallelujah
[1:00:29] who was without father without mother
[1:00:31] without beginning of days and without
[1:00:33] ending of time he still what he is
[1:00:38] I met a man that named his child
[1:00:40] Melchizedek I said hey man you don't
[1:00:43] want any more children do you he said he
[1:00:46] said I want more children you couldn't
[1:00:47] have anymore I said change that boy's
[1:00:49] name you will not do it only one child
[1:00:52] how do you expect to have more children
[1:00:55] why you name your child
[1:00:57] no she said it
[1:01:00] why he did it in a way and then in
[1:01:04] Genesis 15 we find God doing something
[1:01:07] and it's so important to understand why
[1:01:10] what a covenant entails so that if you
[1:01:15] become God's covenant child you
[1:01:18] understand what that means then you can
[1:01:20] take your position of authority because
[1:01:24] you are God's covenant child
[1:01:27] there are many kinds of covenants
[1:01:30] spelled out in the Bible their Covenant
[1:01:32] of friendship we all know Jonathan and
[1:01:34] David they are the Covenant of
[1:01:36] friendship amen there is also a Malachi
[1:01:39] chapter 2 there is a covenant marriage
[1:01:42] covenant that's why you know when
[1:01:44] marriages have been blessed oftentimes
[1:01:46] the preacher can say I'll propose to you
[1:01:50] the marriage covenant amen I propose to
[1:01:54] you the marriage what Covenant there's
[1:01:56] an agreement a covenant and we will find
[1:02:00] out what the Covenant
[1:02:02] entailed
[1:02:03] Jeremiah 34 Verse 18 we'll come to it
[1:02:07] later on but let's look at Genesis 15
[1:02:09] Jehovah now is narrowing the
[1:02:13] relationship down with Abram
[1:02:17] so we Genesis 50 after these things the
[1:02:21] word of the Lord came unto Abraham in
[1:02:24] addition
[1:02:25] brother Branham in the message says is
[1:02:27] this the time he explains that if a
[1:02:30] vision is of god it will be scriptural
[1:02:33] or a continuation of the same amen if a
[1:02:37] vision is of the Lord it will be
[1:02:39] scriptural and it all it will be a
[1:02:41] continuation of the word of the Living
[1:02:44] God hallelujah what makes a person a
[1:02:48] true Prophet is the way they stay with
[1:02:50] this written word of the Living God
[1:02:53] too many preachers some scriptures don't
[1:02:56] really matter
[1:02:58] one thing I find about William Mary and
[1:03:01] Branham is that even though God used
[1:03:04] Supernatural vindications every word of
[1:03:08] God mattered to him
[1:03:12] the answer to Matthew 24 24 that brother
[1:03:15] George was preaching about is Matthew 4
[1:03:18] 4.
[1:03:20] false prophets false teachers performing
[1:03:22] science and wonders in so much that if
[1:03:25] possible they will deceive the very
[1:03:28] elect what is the answer to that Matthew
[1:03:31] 4 4 men shall not live by bread alone
[1:03:34] bye-bye
[1:03:36] not some of the words but by every word
[1:03:40] and this is the only message amen that
[1:03:45] emphasizes
[1:03:46] every word
[1:03:49] every word
[1:03:51] you know some of these people they might
[1:03:54] be Mighty workers or Supernatural
[1:03:57] science might follow them but they don't
[1:03:59] care about everywhere
[1:04:02] hop step and jump they they will hop
[1:04:05] step and jump over some stitches
[1:04:09] and when the Lord Jesus came the Old
[1:04:12] Testament how many know that but Matthew
[1:04:15] 4 4 was also in in Deuteronomy 8 4.
[1:04:21] let's look check it out Deuteronomy 8 4
[1:04:24] Jesus was a word prophet
[1:04:29] he was the way
[1:04:32] Deuteronomy chapter 8
[1:04:36] I like you to read the whole chapter
[1:04:38] when you have time
[1:04:40] I I enjoy reading that chapter so much
[1:04:44] Deuteronomy chapter 8 it was
[1:04:54] let me just read a little part of it
[1:04:58] all the Commandments which I command
[1:05:01] thee this day shall ye observe to do
[1:05:03] that you may live and multiply and go in
[1:05:07] and possess the land which the Lord
[1:05:09] swear unto your fathers
[1:05:12] and I shall remember all the way which
[1:05:15] the Lord thy God let thee these 40 years
[1:05:18] in the wilderness that shall what
[1:05:22] remember
[1:05:24] God doesn't want us to forget
[1:05:26] he wants us to be observant he wants us
[1:05:29] to remember the things that he does for
[1:05:31] us
[1:05:32] amen do you remember has God ever done
[1:05:35] any good thing in your life
[1:05:39] how many will raise their right
[1:05:42] they are left hand up and say amen God
[1:05:45] if somebody is sleeping they will raise
[1:05:46] up their right hand they'll find
[1:05:48] everybody raising up their hands and
[1:05:50] then they jump up because they were
[1:05:52] sleeping how many raise their left hand
[1:05:56] up
[1:05:56] and say yeah the law has done a lot for
[1:05:59] me left
[1:06:03] not sleeping thank God
[1:06:06] amen an evangelist went to a church and
[1:06:10] he said how many of you don't pay tithes
[1:06:13] their hands were up
[1:06:16] and they passed he turns to the past the
[1:06:18] pastor look at the thieves in your
[1:06:20] church
[1:06:23] oh my someone evangelists are really you
[1:06:28] know their cases
[1:06:31] thou shall remember Hallelujah thou
[1:06:35] shall remember
[1:06:36] all the way
[1:06:38] which the Lord that God LED thee these
[1:06:42] 40 years in the wilderness to Humble
[1:06:45] thee and to prove thee to know what was
[1:06:48] in thy Hut
[1:06:52] whether thou wolves keep his
[1:06:55] Commandments or no
[1:06:57] and he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[1:07:02] hunger and Freddie with Manna which thou
[1:07:06] knew was not neither did thy fathers
[1:07:09] know that he might make thee know that
[1:07:14] men that have not lived by Bread only
[1:07:18] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:07:21] the mouth of the Lord that man lived
[1:07:25] does that scriptures believe
[1:07:27] by bread alone but by
[1:07:31] how many ways
[1:07:33] every word praise the Lord that is quite
[1:07:37] amazing so we go back to our our Genesis
[1:07:40] story and quickly we are building this
[1:07:42] solid foundation concerning God's
[1:07:46] covenant people so
[1:07:49] we are with Abraham excuse me kind of
[1:08:00] Genesis 15 still
[1:08:04] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:08:07] came unto Abraham in a vision saying
[1:08:10] fear not Abraham I'm thy Shield
[1:08:13] and by exceeding
[1:08:16] great reward
[1:08:19] how will you feel if Jehovah told you
[1:08:21] that this evening
[1:08:23] fear not
[1:08:26] 365 times in the Bible
[1:08:30] it is written be not afraid
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:36] 365 times the Bible says Be not Afraid
[1:08:42] Satan's strategy is to inject fear as
[1:08:46] soon as you fear
[1:08:49] you are whipped
[1:08:51] fear of death fear of this fear of that
[1:08:54] fear of disappointment all kinds of
[1:08:57] phobias phobia
[1:09:00] fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy
[1:09:04] exceeding great reward
[1:09:06] and Abraham said Lord God
[1:09:10] what would that give me sin I go
[1:09:12] childless and the steward of my house is
[1:09:15] this elieza of Damascus
[1:09:18] Abraham said behold to me that has given
[1:09:21] me no seed and lo one born in my house
[1:09:25] is my name
[1:09:27] and behold the word of the Lord came
[1:09:29] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[1:09:31] but he that shall come forth out of
[1:09:34] thine own bowel shall be thy name and he
[1:09:37] brought him forth abroad and said look
[1:09:40] now toward heaven tell the Stars if thou
[1:09:44] be able to number them and he said unto
[1:09:47] him so shall thy seed be who put the
[1:09:50] stars in the sky
[1:09:52] what are the stars hanging on
[1:09:56] if I can put stars here I can put babies
[1:09:59] in your womb
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:05] praise the Lord and he believed in the
[1:10:08] Lord and he counted it to him for
[1:10:10] righteousness these are very deep things
[1:10:13] and Paul takes them in the Book of
[1:10:16] Romans and he breaks them down God
[1:10:19] counts it as righteousness if we can
[1:10:23] take him at his word
[1:10:25] without any feeling
[1:10:28] Jesus never asked anybody do you feel it
[1:10:31] no he asks do you believe it
[1:10:34] so you've got to take him at his word
[1:10:37] Heaven and Earth will pass away you know
[1:10:39] some people have permutations
[1:10:42] that one of the best permutations in the
[1:10:44] Bible is Mark 13 and 31.
[1:10:47] Heaven and Earth will pass away but my
[1:10:49] words shall not pass away
[1:10:52] 13 31.
[1:10:55] another one of them numbers 32 23
[1:10:59] behold your sin will find you out
[1:11:03] permutation
[1:11:06] turning it around so this shall not be
[1:11:09] done by he that shall come forth out of
[1:11:13] thine own bowel shall be thy name he
[1:11:16] brought him forth abroad and said look
[1:11:19] now toward heaven
[1:11:21] tell the Stars
[1:11:23] if thou be able to number them and he
[1:11:25] said unto him
[1:11:28] what was Jehovah doing to Abraham why
[1:11:31] would he bring him out to look at nature
[1:11:33] to observe nature he is telling Abraham
[1:11:36] look I am the creator of all these
[1:11:39] things if I can do these things there's
[1:11:41] nothing I cannot do for you
[1:11:45] the god of nature is the God of this
[1:11:48] Bible
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:52] so Abraham believed God
[1:11:55] and he believed in the Lord and he
[1:11:57] counted it to him for righteousness when
[1:12:00] the Lord Jesus was alive you are now
[1:12:02] we're not here
[1:12:04] we we have had faith
[1:12:07] by hearing okay
[1:12:10] if we accept what the word of God has
[1:12:13] said without being present or
[1:12:16] feeling anything God counts it as
[1:12:19] righteousness unto us as well
[1:12:22] take time and study Romans chapter 4.
[1:12:26] he said that God counted it as
[1:12:29] righteousness is waiting for our sake as
[1:12:33] well not just for Abraham he will count
[1:12:36] it as righteousness if you can take him
[1:12:39] at his word without any feeling
[1:12:44] so it went on on the Lord now
[1:12:50] establishes a covenant with Abraham
[1:12:54] and if you look at the rest of it how
[1:12:56] that it was to bring three years this
[1:12:59] animal Dynamo and some pigeons and
[1:13:02] turtle doves and then God establishes a
[1:13:06] covenant with Abraham praise the Lord
[1:13:10] now what does that Covenant entail the
[1:13:13] prophet of God has shown us that
[1:13:16] different countries have different ways
[1:13:18] of covenanting entering into agreements
[1:13:22] some handshake some they throw
[1:13:26] salt on each other and so on and so
[1:13:29] forth different ways of having covenants
[1:13:33] but Bible Covenant let's look at
[1:13:36] Jeremiah 30 34.
[1:13:39] and verse 18
[1:13:41] that word covenant has a connotation or
[1:13:45] etymology of cutting
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:50] cutting
[1:13:52] so in Jeremiah
[1:13:55] chapter 34
[1:13:58] Jehovah is talking about
[1:14:01] children of Israel not
[1:14:03] keeping the outside of the Covenant he
[1:14:06] had made with them as a nation through
[1:14:08] their father Abraham Verse 18 says and I
[1:14:13] will give the men that have transgressed
[1:14:16] my Covenant which have not performed the
[1:14:19] words of the Covenant which they had
[1:14:22] made before me when they cut the calf in
[1:14:26] two
[1:14:27] when they did what cut
[1:14:30] the calf into
[1:14:32] and and pass between the past thereof
[1:14:37] see people don't realize brother Branham
[1:14:40] was a scriptural prophet
[1:14:43] he will illustrate something and you
[1:14:45] might think is he took it from the moon
[1:14:48] or the group of Jupiter or Mars no
[1:14:52] no
[1:14:53] praise the Lord this guy should stop
[1:14:56] making noise
[1:14:57] so I'll put it and put him away
[1:15:00] then to help him to keep quiet
[1:15:07] okay
[1:15:08] so I will give the man that have
[1:15:12] transgressed my Covenant which have not
[1:15:15] performed the words of the Covenant
[1:15:17] which they had made before me when they
[1:15:21] cut the calf into and passed between the
[1:15:25] past thereof the princess of Judah and
[1:15:28] the princess of Jerusalem the eunuchs
[1:15:30] the priests and all the people of the
[1:15:33] land which passed between the past of
[1:15:36] the calf so this is showing us a picture
[1:15:40] of how the covenants the covenants were
[1:15:44] enacted they will cut split the animal
[1:15:47] into two and and stand in between them
[1:15:50] and vow to each other
[1:15:53] and the conclusion was this if I don't
[1:15:55] keep my side of the governor let me be
[1:15:58] like this anywhere
[1:15:59] all right so it was always something had
[1:16:04] to be cut into and then the two parties
[1:16:07] of that Covenant stood in between the
[1:16:10] pieces
[1:16:12] and they took vows
[1:16:14] are you following me
[1:16:16] okay so this is a clear picture of how
[1:16:20] covenants were made in the Bible and the
[1:16:23] thought began from the Old Testament and
[1:16:25] continued on on on on on Amen
[1:16:30] so God had a people with whom he had
[1:16:35] covenanted
[1:16:36] and those people Abraham's children had
[1:16:40] become slaves in Egypt through their
[1:16:42] jealousy of Joseph's brothers
[1:16:45] and because they were God's covenant
[1:16:49] people is a reason why he had their cry
[1:16:54] and then he sent Moses to deliver them
[1:16:57] why because they were God's covenant
[1:17:00] people God was obligated to take care of
[1:17:04] his own his Covenant people people that
[1:17:09] he had
[1:17:10] covalented to protect
[1:17:13] to secure
[1:17:15] to provide
[1:17:17] to lead
[1:17:19] there became his portion amongst men
[1:17:22] those Covenant people were God's special
[1:17:26] portion amongst men they were so special
[1:17:31] to him he was under obligation to take
[1:17:34] care of them his Covenant people
[1:17:37] remember there would be war in heaven
[1:17:40] the devil and his angels fought if you
[1:17:43] ever name your children Michael pray for
[1:17:46] them
[1:17:49] because Michael led the Army and
[1:17:51] defeated the devil and threw him down
[1:17:53] here and his demons on Earth the name
[1:17:56] Michael spells doomed to the devil he
[1:17:59] doesn't like that name that name Michael
[1:18:01] means there is none like God
[1:18:04] Hallelujah he doesn't like that name he
[1:18:06] wants to be a challenger of Jehovah so
[1:18:09] they were Michael pray hard
[1:18:12] if I Michelle pray hard all right anyway
[1:18:17] I know what I'm talking about praise the
[1:18:20] Lord so now Jehovah has established a
[1:18:25] covenant with Abraham any seat in
[1:18:29] Genesis 17 he came to ratify the
[1:18:34] Covenant Genesis 17 he produced this a
[1:18:39] seal unto that Covenant and it was
[1:18:42] called a seal of circumcision
[1:18:45] you remember if Moses the great Moses he
[1:18:49] had refused to circumcise his child and
[1:18:52] God was going to kill Moses Exodus
[1:18:55] chapter 4. God was going to kill Moses
[1:18:58] because he was not keeping the seal or
[1:19:02] the sign of the Covenant
[1:19:04] amen so it became so imperative that
[1:19:09] people observed God's covenant they
[1:19:12] should keep their part of the Covenant
[1:19:15] they are part of the agreement
[1:19:18] and God it will draw Jehovah's
[1:19:22] protection and everything he is a
[1:19:25] faithful God he will never break his
[1:19:28] Covenants
[1:19:29] Psalm 89 verse 34 let's look at that put
[1:19:32] your finger in the Genesis story and
[1:19:35] let's turn to Psalm 89 and verse 34 and
[1:19:39] then you can read the entire chapter the
[1:19:42] entire psalm 89. eight nine verse 34 the
[1:19:47] almighty God is talking about
[1:19:51] how he does not break his covenants he
[1:19:55] says my Covenant will I not break amen
[1:19:58] so if you are dealing with somebody who
[1:20:01] is so faithful and he's assuring you
[1:20:03] that if he ever brings you into a
[1:20:05] covenant he will never break that
[1:20:08] Covenant that should bring you Assurance
[1:20:11] under no circumstantial whoever fear
[1:20:14] once you are God's covenant child
[1:20:17] because he's saying I will never break
[1:20:20] my covenants nor alter the word
[1:20:25] the thing that is gone out of my mouth
[1:20:28] even though the soothsayer melam knew
[1:20:33] numbers 23 19. even melam could say God
[1:20:38] is not a man that he should lie neither
[1:20:40] the son of man that they should change
[1:20:42] his mind or repent as he said and will
[1:20:45] he not do it has he spoken and will he
[1:20:49] not make it good I receive commandment
[1:20:52] to bless and he has blessed and I cannot
[1:20:56] reverse it oh Hallelujah
[1:21:00] Jehovah says I have blessed and I cannot
[1:21:04] reverse it so if God ever blesses you no
[1:21:08] man can reverse it
[1:21:10] and if he curses you nobody can reverse
[1:21:14] it he will not bless what he has cares
[1:21:17] and you will not kiss what he has
[1:21:19] blessed amen that is Jehovah God praise
[1:21:24] be to God so that is why he says about
[1:21:26] his covenants and in the Old Testament
[1:21:30] Jehovah God begins to guide his children
[1:21:33] the hour of Deliverance had come at that
[1:21:36] drawn line Exodus quickly
[1:21:40] now we find Jehovah having
[1:21:43] Abraham's seed Deliverance how that they
[1:21:48] will be in bondage for 400 years and
[1:21:52] after the 400 years you bring them out
[1:21:54] of a mighty hand
[1:21:56] people are offended that God used
[1:21:59] William Branham
[1:22:01] maybe they wanted to be used
[1:22:04] and unfortunately God chose William
[1:22:07] Branham he didn't choose them
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:13] so
[1:22:15] God chose Moses to be his hand
[1:22:19] people were expecting a huge hand to
[1:22:22] drop from the sky God says I'll deliver
[1:22:24] them with a mighty hand so everybody was
[1:22:27] looking into the sky for a huge hand to
[1:22:30] drop down and deliver them instead of a
[1:22:33] hand dropping from the sky here comes a
[1:22:37] man a stamina
[1:22:40] that Moses couldn't even speak freely
[1:22:45] kind of what kind of a person is this he
[1:22:49] couldn't even talk properly you know God
[1:22:52] will always chose somebody that is weak
[1:22:54] so that the glory will be unto their
[1:22:57] lord
[1:22:58] he will not share his glory with no man
[1:23:02] that's right praise the Lord
[1:23:04] so Jehovah God in Exodus
[1:23:09] look at what he's saying the people of
[1:23:13] God had multiplied in Egypt and the
[1:23:16] Egyptians were afraid that they were
[1:23:19] getting too many and they might take
[1:23:21] over the nation and so they instruct the
[1:23:26] midwives to commit abortion
[1:23:29] huh they instructed a midwives to kill
[1:23:32] the babies especially the baby boys
[1:23:35] kill them
[1:23:37] and they are doing the same thing today
[1:23:39] abortions
[1:23:44] six million abortions committed within a
[1:23:47] short period in this country
[1:23:49] and the world over
[1:23:55] Somebody went to see a doctor with a
[1:23:58] little it's a doctor you see I have just
[1:24:01] a two-year-old boy and my my wife is
[1:24:03] expecting that we can't we want to space
[1:24:07] out so I want you to abort the baby the
[1:24:10] doctor said oh don't worry about the one
[1:24:12] in the womb I will kill this one
[1:24:15] this one so that one can have the chance
[1:24:17] say doctor you are my address I'm a
[1:24:20] murderer
[1:24:21] how about you telling me to kill the one
[1:24:23] in the womb
[1:24:26] why you tell me I'm a murderer if you
[1:24:29] are not a murderer you ask me to kill
[1:24:31] that child in the womb
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:38] Jeremiah 1 4
[1:24:41] Jehovah said of Jeremiah before you
[1:24:44] became
[1:24:45] fetus in your mother's womb I had
[1:24:48] ordained you a prophet he was not even
[1:24:51] yet in the womb
[1:24:53] let alone when he started life and you
[1:24:55] tell me that that's not life it's just
[1:24:57] what is it
[1:25:00] Okay so
[1:25:05] we find
[1:25:08] because they were God's covenant people
[1:25:10] they Cried unto the Lord for deliverance
[1:25:13] from the task masters of Egypt and what
[1:25:18] happened and Moses God had zipporah and
[1:25:22] jokibet
[1:25:24] God had uh
[1:25:27] uh
[1:25:30] uh
[1:25:31] uh uh uh Miriam
[1:25:37] to give birth to this boy
[1:25:40] and the decree had come that they should
[1:25:43] kill them but because the soil was a
[1:25:45] proper boy boy a proper child they were
[1:25:48] not afraid of the king's commandment
[1:25:50] this they kept him the spies the fbis
[1:25:53] and CIS and kgbs were all over the
[1:25:56] places but the Holy Ghost could preserve
[1:25:59] that child
[1:26:01] can you keep a baby from crying and yet
[1:26:04] God kept that little boy for three
[1:26:08] months and they could not get him
[1:26:11] and then he gave instructions and we
[1:26:14] know how that God had pharaohs
[1:26:17] daughter to pick him up from the water
[1:26:21] take care of him
[1:26:24] and then uh Miriam suggested that you
[1:26:28] could bring somebody to take care of the
[1:26:30] boy for him for her and
[1:26:33] Moses Moses
[1:26:36] Moses's mother took care of her own
[1:26:41] child and was paid for it
[1:26:44] yeah
[1:26:45] don't tell me that God is Not hasn't got
[1:26:49] a sense of humor
[1:26:50] the very person that was going to
[1:26:52] destroy Egypt was raised up in the house
[1:26:56] of pharaoh and they paid the mother for
[1:26:59] doing it
[1:27:04] oh wow the Lord will fool the devil all
[1:27:08] the time
[1:27:11] so he came to pass in the process of
[1:27:14] time that the king of Egypt died and the
[1:27:16] children of Israel sighed by reason of
[1:27:20] the bondage and they cried and their Cry
[1:27:23] came up unto God by reason of the
[1:27:26] bondage and God had their groaning verse
[1:27:30] 24 and God remembered what
[1:27:34] what did he remember
[1:27:36] his Covenant
[1:27:38] and God remembered his Covenant with
[1:27:41] Abraham Isaac and with Jacob
[1:27:44] the only reason why God sent a deliverer
[1:27:47] was there had been a covenant between
[1:27:50] him and the children of Israel and they
[1:27:54] were in one day she was watching his
[1:27:57] timepiece
[1:27:58] not that he didn't know that they needed
[1:28:01] Deliverance but he was waiting for the
[1:28:05] right time God has set times and seasons
[1:28:08] for doing whatever he has to do just
[1:28:11] because it hasn't happened you know we
[1:28:14] are in a society where everybody has to
[1:28:16] have it fast fast fast fast food fast
[1:28:20] track
[1:28:22] fast forward
[1:28:24] and everything fast fast so if you pray
[1:28:27] you don't get a fast answer it's like
[1:28:30] God didn't hear you
[1:28:32] by Israel Abraham's seed you have to
[1:28:34] have patience
[1:28:35] you have to wait on the Lord 24 25 years
[1:28:39] Abraham started not at the promise of
[1:28:41] God through unbelief but was strong in
[1:28:44] faith giving glory to God is going to be
[1:28:47] God says so and it's going to be
[1:28:49] Hallelujah he held on
[1:28:53] did God disappoint him
[1:28:55] neither will he disappoint you keep on
[1:28:59] keeping on keep on holding on Amen so
[1:29:04] God remember this the groanings of his
[1:29:06] children he remembered his Covenant to
[1:29:08] Abram with Isaac and with Jacob and God
[1:29:11] looked upon the children of Israel and
[1:29:14] got her respect unto them and that was
[1:29:17] the reason why he delivered them with a
[1:29:20] mighty hand and they went on on the
[1:29:23] night of the Deliverance
[1:29:25] we know the Exodus story he told Moses
[1:29:29] go and tell the children of Iraqi can't
[1:29:32] you see why the devil wants us to lose
[1:29:35] confidence in the spiritual leadership
[1:29:37] God has given us
[1:29:40] everything Moses told the children of
[1:29:43] Israel and Joshua continued sound as
[1:29:45] stupid
[1:29:48] Go and Kill a lamb and put the blood on
[1:29:50] the door maybe you just go to a new
[1:29:52] house
[1:29:53] and then go and kill the lamb and put
[1:29:56] the blood on the door post outside there
[1:29:58] and blood all over my new burden
[1:30:02] God didn't say paint red paint he said
[1:30:05] blood
[1:30:06] and he specified the type of animal they
[1:30:08] were to kill an alarm without blemish
[1:30:11] and they had to watch it for four days
[1:30:14] and the hour came and he showed them how
[1:30:16] they were to apply they took it
[1:30:19] he saw David is that plant is such is
[1:30:23] such a simple thing a very common
[1:30:26] everybody can apply it
[1:30:28] amen it's not complicated everybody can
[1:30:33] exercise Faith you don't have to have a
[1:30:35] PhD put him down
[1:30:42] you don't have to have a pad to believe
[1:30:44] God
[1:30:45] anybody can can believe God
[1:30:50] it's simple he's so
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:54] no Bulls
[1:30:56] and then lentil and just sleep behind
[1:31:00] the blood
[1:31:02] and he comes over and he's not really
[1:31:04] stressed whether you are toothless
[1:31:07] or you've got plenty of teeth
[1:31:10] whether you are green yellow black
[1:31:12] that's not what he's looking at he's
[1:31:14] looking at the black that's how he's
[1:31:16] looking at so if you have applied the
[1:31:19] blood you are safe
[1:31:20] Hallelujah
[1:31:22] the Covenant is in the blood why Blood
[1:31:26] tonight we are approaching the Lost
[1:31:28] supper please get it real get it why
[1:31:32] Blood
[1:31:35] turn with me to Leviticus chapter 17.
[1:31:38] why Blood all the time blood blah blah
[1:31:41] why
[1:31:43] why Blood
[1:31:46] Leviticus 17 Reading from verse 10.
[1:31:51] and whatsoever
[1:31:55] whatsoever man there be of the House of
[1:31:58] Israel all of the strangers that surgeon
[1:32:01] among you that eateth any manner of
[1:32:05] blood
[1:32:06] I will even shut my face against that
[1:32:10] soul that eat their blood and will cut
[1:32:13] him off from among his people for the
[1:32:16] life of the flesh is in the blood
[1:32:20] thereof are you listening amen
[1:32:24] how many are listening Say Amen
[1:32:26] oh good
[1:32:30] if you're not listening Say Amen
[1:32:33] oh nobody said they mean so everybody is
[1:32:36] listening
[1:32:37] now Jehovah says for the life of the
[1:32:41] flesh shall we all say that in the blood
[1:32:43] so where do we find the the life of any
[1:32:47] flesh
[1:32:49] in the blood thereof
[1:32:52] so if God
[1:32:54] is to transfer his life to his children
[1:32:58] he has to come in blood
[1:33:00] his life has to be wrapped in his blood
[1:33:05] amen that's why Jehovah became man that
[1:33:10] he might get blood and then transfer his
[1:33:13] life through that blood
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:19] so Jehovah continues and he says
[1:33:23] uh for the life of the flesh is in the
[1:33:26] blood and I have given it to you upon
[1:33:29] the altar to make an atonement for your
[1:33:33] souls for it is the blood that makeeth
[1:33:36] an atonement for the soul so it is the
[1:33:40] blood that maketh atonement for the soul
[1:33:43] Hallelujah the life of Jehovah is in his
[1:33:48] blood that's why Acts 20 and verse 20
[1:33:51] Paul wrote to the Ephesians he called
[1:33:54] the Elders of the church in Ephesus and
[1:33:57] he said take heed to yourselves let's
[1:34:00] look at that acts 20 and verse 20. and
[1:34:03] see that Paul refers to it and he says
[1:34:06] it's the blood of God
[1:34:08] Ephesians sorry Acts chapter 20 and
[1:34:11] verse 20. Acts 20 20. I want us to read
[1:34:15] it together
[1:34:17] all right okay here Paul speaking how I
[1:34:21] cut back nothing that was profitable
[1:34:24] unto you but I've shown you and I've
[1:34:27] taught you publicly and from house to
[1:34:30] house
[1:34:35] keep on please
[1:34:38] testifying both to the Jews and also to
[1:34:41] the Greece repentance towards God and
[1:34:44] Faith to us our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:48] verse 28 let's jump over to verse 28
[1:34:51] because I want to save the time thank
[1:34:53] you therefore unto yourselves and to all
[1:34:57] the flock
[1:34:58] over the which the Holy Ghost had made
[1:35:02] you overseas to feed the Church of God
[1:35:06] which he have purchased with his own
[1:35:10] blood
[1:35:11] what did God use to purchase the church
[1:35:16] whose blood
[1:35:19] God's own blood why Blood because the
[1:35:24] life of every flesh is in the blood
[1:35:28] thereof so in order for that life to be
[1:35:32] transferred or imported to his own
[1:35:35] children Jehovah had to be made flesh
[1:35:38] and blood
[1:35:39] and because the children are Flesh and
[1:35:42] Blood he took on the same
[1:35:45] Abraham's seed Flesh and Blood he took
[1:35:48] on the same so now we see why Blood
[1:35:54] and blood is always involved in a
[1:35:58] covenant making when Jehovah is making a
[1:36:01] covenant blood is always involved so the
[1:36:06] Bible the Old Testament is actually old
[1:36:09] Covenant
[1:36:10] when you say the Old Testament to
[1:36:12] actually say in the old word covenant
[1:36:15] and based on what blood animal blood
[1:36:20] if the Covenant
[1:36:22] of animal blood has so much power and
[1:36:27] glory to when Moses went for the law his
[1:36:30] face was shining
[1:36:32] how much more power of God in the New
[1:36:35] Testament
[1:36:37] Hallelujah
[1:36:39] in the Old Testament Covenant produced
[1:36:42] so much Mighty works so much
[1:36:44] Supernatural
[1:36:46] people depended on the blood Covenant
[1:36:49] animal blood Covenant
[1:36:52] they have such a such power with the
[1:36:55] Living God how should we Children of the
[1:36:58] most high God in the New Covenant
[1:37:02] the blood of Jehovah
[1:37:05] it should produce Greater Works
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:10] so that was Leviticus 17 explaining to
[1:37:15] us why Blood and then God instituted
[1:37:20] the Passover
[1:37:22] and I see the blood I will pass over you
[1:37:25] so that Passover Festival went on and on
[1:37:29] and on I was reading this from
[1:37:33] I Googled it up I felt like checking on
[1:37:36] how the Jews in the Old Testament
[1:37:39] observed they are
[1:37:42] they are passovers festival and I had
[1:37:45] this interesting thing that I discovered
[1:37:47] during the Jewish Passover ceremony
[1:37:50] three laws of unleavened bread called
[1:37:53] matzo
[1:37:55] are presented three laws
[1:37:58] are presented they are placed in a bag
[1:38:02] called uh
[1:38:05] Matt zoha
[1:38:07] Matt zo Tosh the bag called mazzo torch
[1:38:13] each loaf being in his own compartment
[1:38:18] during this Festival Cedar
[1:38:22] the masotosh
[1:38:24] is opened and the middle
[1:38:27] love called bread of affliction
[1:38:32] is removed and broken into
[1:38:37] the bigger portion is wrapped in the
[1:38:41] linen bag called an africoman which
[1:38:45] means it comes later
[1:38:48] the official man is taken out of the
[1:38:51] room and hidden symbolically
[1:38:54] buried somewhere in the house by the
[1:38:58] leader of the celebration and hidden
[1:39:01] so three loaves of bread each in its own
[1:39:05] compartment the middle one is taken and
[1:39:08] broken and the bigger part is wrapped up
[1:39:11] and is hidden somewhere in the house and
[1:39:14] the people are commanded to look for it
[1:39:16] and it is brought at the end of the
[1:39:19] ceremony and broken up and distributed
[1:39:22] amongst the people and that middle one
[1:39:25] is called the blood the bread of
[1:39:28] affliction
[1:39:30] and that was the Passover ceremony the
[1:39:33] unleavened bread past seven days they
[1:39:36] ate unleavened bread
[1:39:38] why the middle one
[1:39:40] look at the thieves on the cross
[1:39:43] why here why here by it was Jesus the
[1:39:46] one that was Our Redeemer and and you
[1:39:49] can they can have father son Holy Ghost
[1:39:52] but in the middle one
[1:39:54] so Jesus I'm sure during that Passover
[1:39:57] he was the Master of Ceremonies
[1:40:00] he takes the middle one
[1:40:02] and he lifts it up and he said this is
[1:40:05] my body
[1:40:06] that is broken for you
[1:40:09] do this in remembrance of me
[1:40:13] if there's anything that the people of
[1:40:16] God ought to remember
[1:40:17] is that Supreme sacrifice
[1:40:21] I'm a pastor I've been pasted now I
[1:40:23] wonder how how that people
[1:40:27] can neglect the Lord's Supper
[1:40:29] brother Branham said I love to take the
[1:40:32] Lord's Supper every time that is the
[1:40:35] Supreme sacrifice that you don't have to
[1:40:38] miss it no matter what the cause you
[1:40:41] don't have to miss the Lord's Supper
[1:40:43] Jesus said do this in remembrance of me
[1:40:47] there are all kinds of
[1:40:49] memorials some are negative
[1:40:53] remember Lord's wife
[1:40:55] Memorial of rebellion
[1:40:58] but this is memorial of Amazing Grace
[1:41:02] and you me you mean to tell me you're a
[1:41:05] Christian and you don't want to remember
[1:41:06] what he did for you that day at Calvary
[1:41:10] that was Jehovah God establishing the
[1:41:14] New Covenant
[1:41:15] so in Matthew 26
[1:41:18] look at what Jesus that same ceremony
[1:41:21] that passed over he is the Master of
[1:41:24] Ceremonies the one is there the bread is
[1:41:27] there and then look at what he says
[1:41:30] Matthew 20 says 26.
[1:41:33] Luke 22 29 but Matthew 26 26 I want to
[1:41:37] take that one down Matthew 26 26 that I
[1:41:40] will soon wrap up because I know uh we
[1:41:43] must have time for the Last Supper so
[1:41:45] Matthew 26 20 says down
[1:41:48] um here the Lord Jesus himself
[1:41:52] he's facing Calvary and then this is
[1:41:55] what he did
[1:41:58] Matthew 26 I'm sorry
[1:42:01] yeah and 26 okay and as they were eating
[1:42:05] eating what a Passover Jesus Took bread
[1:42:09] you so what bread do you think you would
[1:42:12] take there are three of them
[1:42:15] to the same ceremony
[1:42:17] so he took bread the middle one I'm sure
[1:42:21] and blessed it
[1:42:24] and break it and gave it to the
[1:42:27] disciples and said take it this is my
[1:42:30] body
[1:42:33] and he took the cup
[1:42:36] remember the bread what did he do to the
[1:42:39] bread
[1:42:41] and what did he do to the cup
[1:42:44] he gave thanks
[1:42:46] so he gave thanks and gave it to them
[1:42:48] saying drink ye all of it
[1:42:52] drinky all of it
[1:42:56] let's read the next together
[1:43:00] four this is my blood of the New
[1:43:04] Covenant new testament which is shared
[1:43:07] for the for the for many for the
[1:43:10] remission of sins
[1:43:13] Hallelujah
[1:43:18] and Paul picked it up in First
[1:43:19] Corinthians 11 and he says as often as
[1:43:23] he do this he drink that cup do it what
[1:43:26] he remembrance
[1:43:28] of me
[1:43:31] if there's anything that you and I ought
[1:43:33] to remember and and should remember it
[1:43:37] is this and also in John 6 he said
[1:43:39] except you eat my body and drink my
[1:43:43] blood you have no what
[1:43:46] no life
[1:43:48] why because the life is in the blood so
[1:43:52] actually you drink that blood next time
[1:43:54] you eat my body and drink that blood you
[1:43:57] have no life in you
[1:43:58] the life is in the blood so when we come
[1:44:02] to the Lost table
[1:44:05] we are coming not communion communion is
[1:44:09] actually a two-way Affair talking to him
[1:44:13] and he talking back to you that's the
[1:44:14] real communion but this is called the
[1:44:17] Lord supper
[1:44:19] it's so unfortunate that people is
[1:44:21] supper in the morning
[1:44:25] people eat supper in the morning
[1:44:30] it's the Lord's Supper in the morning
[1:44:33] as language lost its meaning
[1:44:38] foreign
[1:44:40] it has to run the Bible must go run in
[1:44:45] continuity so that we don't break the
[1:44:47] rhythm of the word
[1:44:49] it has to run in continuity
[1:44:52] it is a continuity of the past over
[1:44:55] ceremony he was the lamb that was
[1:44:58] crucified that night
[1:45:01] he gave his blood he gave his life it
[1:45:04] the token is a sign that somebody has
[1:45:07] given his life
[1:45:09] and if I accept it
[1:45:12] I have received the life of The Giver
[1:45:16] into me and as long as he lives I will
[1:45:20] live also
[1:45:21] what a wonderful privilege to come and
[1:45:25] to partake of this uh the elements of
[1:45:29] the New Covenant then you have become
[1:45:31] God's covenant child
[1:45:33] even though one third of the Heavenly
[1:45:36] Angels fell to the devil to tests are on
[1:45:38] our side
[1:45:40] hey did you hear that
[1:45:42] one third of heavenly Angels fight to
[1:45:44] the devil but two things are on our side
[1:45:49] we are in the majority
[1:45:51] we are more than conquests
[1:45:54] so as tonight to come to the table
[1:45:57] remember you are being invited to renew
[1:46:01] your Covenant with Jehovah
[1:46:05] and I thank God that he sent this
[1:46:08] Prophet to establish this and to make it
[1:46:12] so strong so that we don't do these
[1:46:16] things ritualistically
[1:46:18] but we do these things with Revelation
[1:46:22] and understanding of what we are doing
[1:46:25] so you come to this table and you
[1:46:29] remember what would have happened to you
[1:46:31] if Jesus had not gone to Calvary
[1:46:36] Revelations chapter 5 when the cry was
[1:46:38] made for a king's My Redeemer one that
[1:46:42] will take our place that we might take
[1:46:44] his place
[1:46:48] there was silence in heaven
[1:46:50] and John wept
[1:46:53] why would he weep if there was no
[1:46:56] Kingsman Redeemer it means whatever we
[1:46:58] lost through Adam is lost forever but if
[1:47:01] we find a worthy one then there is the
[1:47:03] restoration of everything that we lost
[1:47:07] Hallelujah if we find a worthy one then
[1:47:11] it means the restoration of everything
[1:47:14] that was lost in the Garden of Eden did
[1:47:17] we find out where they were John was
[1:47:19] crying and then one of the elders said
[1:47:23] don't withdraw
[1:47:26] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:47:29] prevailed
[1:47:31] he has taken the book
[1:47:35] ing the Seven Seals there are no sexy
[1:47:37] Seven Seas thereof
[1:47:40] and he tends to look for a lion
[1:47:42] and he sees what a bleeding lamb
[1:47:46] shed for the Holy Blood
[1:47:49] so that the life of God in him can come
[1:47:52] upon the believer so our Prophet says if
[1:47:55] anybody I don't care how sinful you are
[1:47:58] God is rich in Mercy you come lay your
[1:48:02] hands on the Islam and confess your sins
[1:48:05] he's already shared that Holy Blood for
[1:48:08] you the life in that blood will replace
[1:48:12] that
[1:48:14] sin loving nature that came through
[1:48:18] sexual reproduction to replace that and
[1:48:22] then become God loving automatically you
[1:48:27] love the Lord you are you were born an
[1:48:30] automatic sinner
[1:48:32] you don't have to learn to sin I have
[1:48:35] never seen any parent calling their
[1:48:37] children
[1:48:38] I've never seen any parent calling their
[1:48:40] chair and say say stupid stop it full
[1:48:43] full no
[1:48:45] children just grow up and they can get
[1:48:48] angry little babies get angry
[1:48:51] where does it come from
[1:48:54] the natural birth if you are born once
[1:48:57] only you are going to hell
[1:48:59] Jesus said you must be born again so the
[1:49:05] problem is with wrong birth
[1:49:09] born again because the first bad is
[1:49:12] wrong
[1:49:15] but we have to be born again to receive
[1:49:19] that new nature that goes with a new
[1:49:22] birth
[1:49:24] I'm born again automatically I get the
[1:49:28] nature of my birth
[1:49:32] I don't have to learn
[1:49:34] patience
[1:49:36] I don't have to learn anything
[1:49:38] I just have to be born human
[1:49:41] why do you behave like a human being
[1:49:44] you were not born a goat
[1:49:47] why would you call the son of a goat say
[1:49:50] God
[1:49:52] it's born by a goat
[1:49:55] right if I'm born by God I'm a son of
[1:49:59] God
[1:50:01] so you take the nature of your father
[1:50:06] oh blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:50:08] tonight
[1:50:09] don't just come to the Lord's table and
[1:50:12] as a ritual like the children of Israel
[1:50:15] the Passover Festival became a ritual at
[1:50:18] the time and God didn't like it
[1:50:21] we should never never allow what Jesus
[1:50:25] did for us to become a ritual
[1:50:29] don't just come to church and warm the
[1:50:31] pew
[1:50:33] come because Christ has done so much for
[1:50:36] you and you are showing your
[1:50:37] appreciation for him by giving off your
[1:50:41] best
[1:50:43] and you don't know when you are called
[1:50:44] to be called and that will be your last
[1:50:47] time last opportunity tonight might be
[1:50:50] your last opportunity I left my own
[1:50:53] biological brother
[1:50:55] just when I flew out of my country
[1:50:59] my father we had my mother had 10
[1:51:02] children I'm the last one
[1:51:05] the next one before whom I I came
[1:51:08] after whom I came excuse me
[1:51:11] he died just
[1:51:14] when I left he I talked to him and he
[1:51:17] was okay but he's gone
[1:51:20] four church members
[1:51:22] have died since I left my country it's
[1:51:25] not long ago
[1:51:28] you don't know when your car to be
[1:51:30] called so whatever you think of doing
[1:51:32] for God we better do it now
[1:51:35] don't postpone anything that you ought
[1:51:37] to do for the Lord whatever you want to
[1:51:40] do for the Lord please do it right quick
[1:51:43] for time
[1:51:45] is our time and as brother George
[1:51:47] preached this morning the time is now
[1:51:51] the signs are all over the places
[1:51:55] you ever see that if you really believe
[1:51:58] this message one of the things that are
[1:52:01] being fulfilled so rapidly around us
[1:52:04] to shut such desperation in every soul
[1:52:08] to check up your life to make sure
[1:52:12] you have applied a token
[1:52:15] the last Angel was coming you want to
[1:52:18] make sure you have applied the token and
[1:52:20] you are standing you are staying behind
[1:52:22] the blood
[1:52:23] that was the only provided place of
[1:52:25] safety
[1:52:27] that night and God has sent a message to
[1:52:30] provide the only position and place of
[1:52:34] safety
[1:52:35] to stay with the word of the Living God
[1:52:38] and all these things that Jehovah God
[1:52:41] has given us don't you don't you think
[1:52:44] that God knows the antidote to the power
[1:52:47] of the devil
[1:52:49] he's raised a standard against Satan
[1:52:53] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:52:55] spirit of the Living God raises standard
[1:52:58] against him
[1:52:59] they don't like this message and the
[1:53:01] reason is
[1:53:03] one time I was going to wash down I'm
[1:53:06] closing I was going to watch that the
[1:53:08] word came to me who was the most hated
[1:53:11] person that ever lived
[1:53:14] can you tell me
[1:53:15] who was the most hated person
[1:53:20] that ever lived
[1:53:22] anybody
[1:53:25] the Lord Jesus Christ and who was the
[1:53:27] only one that was born right
[1:53:32] who the only one that was born right and
[1:53:36] lived sinless who
[1:53:38] how come how do you put them together
[1:53:41] brother Billy president David how do we
[1:53:44] put this together that the only man that
[1:53:47] lived a sin life sinless life also was
[1:53:51] the most hated person that ever lived
[1:53:55] can you put can you reconcile this
[1:53:59] so is it a new one and any surprise that
[1:54:03] the most hated person and the most hated
[1:54:06] message is our message
[1:54:08] why because it's the only message
[1:54:11] designed by Jehovah to defeat the Devil
[1:54:15] in our day so hold to God's unchanging
[1:54:21] everybody oh
[1:54:28] build your own some things eternal
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:35] God bless you Brother David I'm sorry
[1:54:37] for
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:40] oh
[1:54:42] sweethearts I'm changing
[1:54:46] amen I enjoyed that that's my kind of
[1:54:51] preaching right there
[1:54:53] I love feasting on the word I love
[1:54:56] seeing it
[1:54:57] put together I love seeing Jesus Christ
[1:55:00] revealed in every scripture and what a
[1:55:03] blessing what a great opportunity you
[1:55:06] have tonight
[1:55:08] to renew your Covenant
[1:55:10] to rededicate yourself
[1:55:13] to come back under the blood
[1:55:16] amen that was shed for you
[1:55:19] and accept
[1:55:21] the forgiveness
[1:55:25] you've got to accept it
[1:55:27] he already knows well you're a yet
[1:55:30] sinner he died for you
[1:55:33] he knows all your mistakes and
[1:55:35] and he knows all your failures but what
[1:55:38] he looks to is is that heart
[1:55:41] that cries out Lord I want to be
[1:55:43] delivered I don't want to do this I want
[1:55:46] to enter into the Covenant I want to
[1:55:49] renew my Covenant
[1:55:50] you know communion is one of the
[1:55:52] ordinances that the prophet of God said
[1:55:55] if you don't take it you will not be
[1:55:57] there
[1:56:01] that's
[1:56:03] that's pretty tough
[1:56:05] you think you're going to get in on your
[1:56:07] revelation
[1:56:09] no you get an in on the obedience
[1:56:12] to all the word of God Amen you get in
[1:56:15] because you accept
[1:56:17] the sacrifice he provided just like
[1:56:21] Abraham accepted the promise that God
[1:56:24] gave him
[1:56:25] amen and that's the faith that we have
[1:56:28] so there's healing and communion
[1:56:33] there's forgiveness in communion
[1:56:35] because you're going to enter back into
[1:56:37] a fellowship back into a covenant if
[1:56:40] you've been away this evening you've
[1:56:43] been backslid you haven't been on fire
[1:56:45] to the Lord I I'm going through a
[1:56:48] rededication process in my life where I
[1:56:52] want to get rid of the negative thoughts
[1:56:53] I want to put more confidence in the
[1:56:56] Lord I want to be patiently and wait for
[1:56:59] him and I want to see him appear
[1:57:03] that's what I'm looking for every day is
[1:57:07] to wait and see him appear
[1:57:10] because he promised he would show up
[1:57:12] this is the day of his appearing
[1:57:15] where he appears in the life of his
[1:57:19] Saints and comes on the scene how can he
[1:57:22] appear he appears in his Covenant
[1:57:25] which is his word so let's stand if the
[1:57:29] brothers we go get together who's ever
[1:57:31] doing the communion with us
[1:57:35] let's turn over to the 11th chapter of
[1:57:37] the book of Corinthians in the first
[1:57:40] book that Paul wrote to the Corinthians
[1:57:45] and he said I receive this from the Lord
[1:57:48] and I'm delivering it to you
[1:57:52] and so he's now transferring
[1:57:56] the Covenant
[1:57:58] he's transferring that Covenant to the
[1:58:01] Gentiles that now they have a covenant
[1:58:04] not of blood and not of of goats and the
[1:58:09] blood of beasts
[1:58:10] but the blood of the Lamb of God
[1:58:13] amen so let us read for I have received
[1:58:17] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:58:21] unto you
[1:58:23] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:58:25] which he was betrayed
[1:58:28] took bread
[1:58:30] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:58:33] it
[1:58:35] and said take Eid this is my body
[1:58:41] which is broken for you
[1:58:43] this do in remembrance of me
[1:58:48] and after the same manner also he took
[1:58:50] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:58:55] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:58:58] this
[1:59:00] do as often as ye drink it in remember
[1:59:05] he do show the Lord's death till he come
[1:59:10] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:59:14] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:59:17] unworthily
[1:59:20] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:59:25] the Lord
[1:59:26] but let a man examine
[1:59:30] himself
[1:59:32] and so let him eat of that bread
[1:59:37] and drink
[1:59:39] of that cup
[1:59:40] that's the key
[1:59:43] is the examination of yourself
[1:59:46] and when you see those short spots
[1:59:49] renew the Covenant
[1:59:52] when you see that you've sinned renew
[1:59:55] the Covenant except the pardon accept
[1:59:58] what he's done for you and renew
[2:00:01] yourself
[2:00:02] in his spirit
[2:00:07] he says
[2:00:11] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:00:14] unworthily eateth and drinketh
[2:00:17] judgment to himself
[2:00:20] not Discerning the Lord's body
[2:00:23] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:00:26] among you and many sleep
[2:00:29] for if we
[2:00:31] would judge ourselves
[2:00:34] we should not be judged but when we are
[2:00:37] judged we are chastened of the Lord
[2:00:41] that we should not be condemned
[2:00:45] with the world
[2:00:47] Amen what a wonderful opportunity that's
[2:00:51] presented to it wherefore my brethren
[2:00:54] when you come together to eat Tarry
[2:00:58] one for another and if any man hunger
[2:01:01] let him eat at home
[2:01:04] that ye come not together under judgment
[2:01:07] or condemnation
[2:01:09] and the rest will I set an order
[2:01:11] when I come amen as the Brothers prepare

[2:17:06] oh his blood has

[2:17:13] you know why we sing and we lift our

[2:17:21] each of Our Lives
[2:17:23] has lots of complications
[2:17:26] and lots of mental battles
[2:17:30] but what you've got to do is you've got
[2:17:32] to open that channel up
[2:17:37] you've got to open the window you've got
[2:17:39] to open the door you've got to open the
[2:17:41] channel and you start to feel that
[2:17:43] presence
[2:17:45] come by because it's like if you put all
[2:17:48] the water
[2:17:49] of all the oceans
[2:17:51] and you put all that pressure in one
[2:17:55] small tube that's how much God wants to
[2:17:57] bless you
[2:17:59] that's how much he wants to break into
[2:18:01] your life come fill you
[2:18:05] but you've got to open the hatch
[2:18:08] you've got to open the door and when the
[2:18:10] spirit moves and you you start to sense
[2:18:13] this presence you've got to open it up
[2:18:17] you've got to let them come past your
[2:18:20] your mind
[2:18:23] past your thoughts
[2:18:25] past everything just let them come deep
[2:18:28] down on the inside
[2:18:31] and start you can just start to feel his
[2:18:36] it's not always the great Shout
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:40] most of the time is just such a sweet
[2:18:42] reverence
[2:18:44] in such a sweet presence let's just turn
[2:18:48] ourselves to him
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:19:04] foreign
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:37] you can think of all his goodness let's
[2:19:39] read in the 13th chapter of the Gospel
[2:19:43] of John
[2:19:47] what love
[2:19:49] knowing whom would betray him
[2:19:52] he girded himself and watched their feet
[2:19:55] what a love story
[2:19:58] now before the Feast of the Passover
[2:20:03] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[2:20:08] that he should depart out of this world
[2:20:12] unto the father
[2:20:15] having loved his own who were in the
[2:20:19] world
[2:20:20] he loved them unto the end
[2:20:24] and supper being ended
[2:20:26] the devil
[2:20:28] having now put into the heart of Judas
[2:20:32] Iscariot
[2:20:34] Simon's that the father
[2:20:37] had given all things into his hands
[2:20:41] and that he was come from God and went
[2:20:47] to God
[2:20:49] he raises from supper
[2:20:52] and laid aside His Garment
[2:20:55] and took a towel and girdeth himself
[2:20:59] after that he poureth water into a basin
[2:21:05] and begin to wash the disciples feet
[2:21:09] and to wipe them with the towel with
[2:21:13] which he was girded
[2:21:16] then cometh he to Simon Peter
[2:21:19] and Peter said unto him
[2:21:22] Lord thus thou wash my feet
[2:21:26] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:21:30] what I do without knoweth not now but
[2:21:35] Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said
[2:21:39] unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet
[2:21:43] you know a lot of people say that to the
[2:21:46] Lord every day
[2:21:48] he wants to bless them
[2:21:50] he wants to forgive him
[2:21:52] he wants to cleanse him and they just
[2:21:55] don't let him do
[2:21:57] what he loves to do most
[2:22:00] and that's take care of us
[2:22:03] wipe away our past
[2:22:05] and give us new breath
[2:22:07] every day
[2:22:11] so make that personal
[2:22:14] because we all have a little Peter in us
[2:22:16] don't we
[2:22:18] Peter said unto betray him therefore
[2:22:22] said he ye are not all clean so after he
[2:22:25] had washed their feet and at
