visitors are welcome this morning God bless you foreign [Music] [Music] s commit the service to the Lord this morning Father we just always so grateful once again to come into your presence Lord that we have a place that we can come and set aside and Lord to lift up your name and to learn of you Lord I pray that we would just take care to use every moment to lay ourselves before you father and give you an opportunity to Lord to have your way we commit this whole service to you Lord that your will would be done Lord you know each one of us that have come into this place what we have need of even more than ourselves Lord the things that we need to hear of you Lord and we welcome your presence we pray that there were nothing though here that would hinder your working Lord that you'd have freedom to move on hearts and to change lives and to Lord to minister your word and to make yourself known Lord I pray that any spirit that would stand in the way of Lord your Mighty hand working Lord would be rebuked by your word Lord as you have promised that where two or three are gathered in your name your present there in the midst Lord we thank you for all things and we commit this service this day all things to you in Jesus name amen good morning I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord it's a familiar statement for any of us and certainly something we all say Amen to you know there's certainly something refreshing and strengthening about Gathering Together in the place that we've set aside to worship Him this is the opening verse of Psalm 122. and while it's something we're all familiar with can agree on it's worth taking a moment to look exactly at how he says it it doesn't say I was glad when we went into the house of the Lord it says I was glad when they said to me let us go into the house of the Lord see the house of the Lord is not something you can just go into [Music] you have to be called into it you have to be invited into the house what made him glad was the invitation to go in you see you just can't enter into someone else's house uninvited or else you're an intruder or a thief says in John told the people in chapter Jesus told the people in John 10 he said verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but clineth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is this is The Shepherd of the Sheep to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadeth them out a little later in verse 7 it says verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep you know before we go into someone else's house you have to be invited by name I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord out of reverence we refer to buildings like these as the house of the Lord but you know scripturally speaking this isn't really his house no more than any of the other buildings you might find in Bedford Paul and Stephen both quoted Isaiah 66 when the when he said thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my footstool where is the house that ye will build for me and where is the place of my rest for all these things hath mine hand made you know the house of the Lord is not something built by men whether it's made out of wood or it's made out of religion still man-made God God's house isn't something made by men as Solomon said in First Kings 8 27 but will God indeed dwell on the Earth behold the heaven and Heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that I have built it you know a house is a Dwelling Place a place that has your name on it the house of the Lord is his Dwelling Place and it's the place that has his name on it you just just as you choose the place where you dwell and put your name so also does he choose the place where he dwells and puts his name he told his people in Deuteronomy 12 11 then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there the house of the Lord is a place of his choosing where he dwells where he puts his name I was glad when they said unto me let us go in to the house of the Lord you know the other thing about a house is it has a household you know brother Branham preached a message called thy house in 1961. and in it he reads that story from acts 16 where Paul and Silas are in prison they begin to sing the Lord moves on the scene and sends an earthquake that opens the gates and breaks the chains and sets them free you remember the story The Keeper of the prison came and he was believing that the prisoners had escaped was about to take his own life when Paul called out and said don't harm yourself we're all still here but you know the scripture that brother Branham took there as he read that story was when the Jailer fell on his knees and said sirs what must I do to be saved and he said that this is what the he told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house see brother Branham preached a whole message about how the faith of one yes upon the word can cause the whole rest of the house to find their place and be saved but see this wasn't speaking of a building being saved or a physical structure but it was speaking of those that dwelt in the house the house hold those of the house can benefit from the faith of the one whose house it is I was glad when they said unto me let us go in to the house of the Lord you know I was made glad when an offer was made for me an invitation by name to become a participator a member of this household Paul says in Ephesians 2 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye are builded together for inhabitation a Dwelling Place of God through the spirit I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord you know I think we can say Amen to that an entrance has been ministered an invitation has been made by name for us to participate in that household as much as we may enjoy coming together to Worship the Lord in this building and hear the word how much more should we be glad that we heard our name called and that we were given an opportunity to participate in the house as an invited member I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord how many are glad this morning that we can go into the house of the Lord let's just read that little Psalm together it's Psalm 122 starting in verse 1. I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord our feet shall stand within thy Gates o Jerusalem Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together wither the tribes go up the tribes of the Lord unto the testimony of Israel to give thanks unto the name of the Lord but there are set Thrones of judgment the Thrones of the House of David pray for the Peace of Jerusalem they shall prosper they love thee peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces for my brethren and companion's sake I will now say peace be within thee because of the house of the Lord Our God I will seek thy good amen God bless you we have your seats and oh there's not a friend like the holy Jesus [Music] [Music] about a struggle oh he will God tell the days [Music] [Music] oh

so nice to have you the Lord bless you this morning and and we trust the Lord's good anyway Leslie and I brought my mom to Michigan where she was born we went out to eat the other evening with them and we're sitting in the restaurant my mom turns over she said oh see this this is where we had my High School prom you know in 1938 I think or something but it was just kind of nice to have her point out things and and everything to be there so I'm grateful for that she's doing good I guess the hardest part of my life is that you begin to realize that you're not going to keep them forever if the Lord tarries and the only way that you can be with them forever is through the love and grace of the Lord Jesus and so I trust that he will expand that I'm not going to sing a special so God bless you all you can go I know you look for the great expectation I'll sing a special the day I retire and then everybody else will be happy but we're we're grateful for the good things of the Lord and we trust that it'll be a blessing so any other visitors that I missed this morning it's nice to be here um to uh this morning I before we stand and read our scriptures I had a thought on my heart and it just kept burning in my heart this thought and uh and um and so I you know I I'm thinking you know I know it's somewhere and I you know if you you have something that's burning in your heart you want to find it somewhere in the word of God you know what I mean and so I just kept thinking I was reading in leadership and and the message leadership was on my heart and and there was something burning out of leadership that just struck me and then the Lord brought it just kind of spoke to me and said I I preached this thought okay okay what you're thinking I've I've ministered and then he brought this message to us which we will look into a little bit this morning called thinking man's filter so let's stand this morning and turn in our Bibles to Ephesians uh uh 5 19 through 27 Ephesians 5 19-27 um I I want to kind of approach this this morning in a way that if the Lord will help me that it strikes home to us individually not as a subject matter or as a Bible study but somehow if the Lord would help me this morning where it could come to each of us personally and cause us to reflect on the process that we're in every day so if you would pray that the Lord would help us do that this morning then I hope it wouldn't be me but it would be him speaking to you therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish our heavenly father we ask you to bless your word test this morning in your precious name we pray amen may be seated I think this scripture uh presents to us the goal of Paul and the goal of the gospel itself that that the gospel had a purpose it had a goal it had something that it wanted to achieve uh it wasn't just given out there to be studied it wasn't just presented as the truth that this is true and and perceive it as truth but it was a a living working goal so in other words when you have a goal you just don't sit down and imagine your goal you know what I'm saying if you if uh possibly maybe a young fellow would in his mind he would have a goal of getting a a new pickup truck or something just get the thought that I'm trying to wrap my he couldn't just sit down and and and look at pickup trucks and go online and look at pickup trucks and just sit there and say oh someday Santa Claus is going to bring me a pickup truck you know or the Easter Bunny is going to put a pickup truck under a rock and I'm going to found it in other words that's how foolish that thinking would be but if he's got a goal in his mind then he's got to realize I've got to work towards that goal I've got to do certain things you know I got to get a driver's license you know I'm going to have to get insurance I'm going to have to do this and do that and and so he strives to accomplish his goal well God had an image of you in his mind is that right but when you were born in this world you weren't born in that image you were born in this world a liar we all came into the world speaking lies that that when we came in that's the shape that we were in we were lost we had all kinds of uh things wrong with us in fact we didn't even have a chance and but yet God in his mind had something that he wanted us to be something that he saw in us and he begins to draw us and work us towards that uh end that he had in mind so he he saw you as a sinner and so he started the process if I could say it that way to accomplish the goal that he had and we know that his goal was right was to restore his fallen family all of us in the beginning really belonged in the Garden of Eden we are living in a world that is not ours we are in this world but we are not of this world this world is not my home I feel like traveling on because so the Lord knew that about you so okay if you could just understand that in his heart your heart this morning that he he saw you were born in this world he knew that sin caused it that you you married this life that you're in this nature that you're in that came because the husband of this life was was sin it was the fall in the garden is what put you here but yet you were still in him and a part of him and he knew you for what you were in the beginning not for how that you got here so he begins to reach out to you and to deal with you and to seek you and to find you and then when he finds you he convicts you of the life you're living and you're living life I was happy I was just a hippie you know just bebopping along you know uh and uh you know just listening to my music and and and participating in my activities and all those things and all of a sudden the hand of God moves and and I wasn't expecting it and he began to deal with my heart and he begins to reach out and he begins to call and act and things that begin to fall apart I don't even know what's happening to me but he does because I saw what I wanted to be but he had something else in mind and I'll tell you something Paul had something else in mind too but one day he met him on the road to Damascus and the Lord said it's hard to kick against the prick Paul you're gonna find out the things that I have in mind for you the things that you'll suffer the things that you're going to show you and I and you're going to go preach this gospel to the Gentiles the one minute he's sitting here gonna persecute the church wipe out this heresy he's going to place himself in a great Realms of of the church and and be a hero maybe up for high priest you know you you don't know in the next minute he's blind in an alley and gonna go preach the gospel to the Gentiles Ah that's the kind of God we serve amen so God had a goal you understand he's trying to achieve that goal and I want to share with you something this morning that's necessary for us if we are going to achieve that goal and so I hope that you can take but let's listen to what he says here he said he said he says Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so why did he do that that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing by the word so he he knew it needed to be what washed so he saw it there it was lying lying born in sin come into the world speaking lies full of lust and envy and Malice and hatred and everything and he realized that he had to wash that out of them you understand that they needed to be washed they needed to be cleaned so he went to Calvary he died but not only did he die to pay the price of your sins that's only half of it so your sins are paid but you're still dirty okay so then he wanted to start cleansing him washing you right he's going to work you he's going to mold you he's going to change you he's going to there's going to be a transformation that takes place and I could go in to a great teaching on the power of transformation but you all know this morning that he put that power to transform was in you when you came into the world but something had to bring that power of transformation to life so therefore the word had to strike the sea in order to germinate it and to start that process so God washes by his word believe me I've been doing my I I shouldn't say that I wanted to say I've been doing my best to follow this message but I haven't done half of what I should have done to follow this message but but it's still he had a a way of of doing it and what I meant to say is I've I've been in this for 50 some years now I that I've been following the the this word that was given to us in this day and I have to say it's still washing me you understand that it's still washing me and uh and I just trust the Lord will help us move this morning it says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word so we know by this very scripture that he found his bride his church unclean and and okay John says any man that's safe he's sinneth not a liar but we had a Pictionary we have some somebody that came and and paid the price for that and now wanting to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and then he so he goes on them I say it that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing so it's got to be spotless without spot and we're going to talk about spots and wrinkles I probably concentrate more on the wrinkles I guess there's only half of us that's worried about wrinkles right okay or any such thing but that it should be holy and without bleming so he just didn't want to save it and he didn't want the work just to be reflective on himself but he wanted to produce it just excuse my vocabulary but he wanted to produce a product or or something that was holy without spot or blemish and without wrinkle and and that that's that was what that he wanted that's what he was going to do and so if he said this is why he died this is why he gave himself for the church then that can't fail you understand that I mean he he didn't do that and then it and then have it fail because if it failed then he didn't do it you understand so he's going to have this church now there's a way to make it easier you know but uh you know so in experience is a a teacher but it's not the best teacher instruction is the best teacher you know if someone says hot hot you know no no hot hot well if you want to accept that instructions fine but if you want to reach up there and touch it and find out well you found out the same thing that you were instructed it's hot well I just bring us in this morning and and see so the Lord had this great purpose in his mind of having this restored body Adam and Eve without sin Christ in his bride back in eternity God's restored family with him having the pre Eminence over and so they they started this uh great he started this great work of restoring man and we know he's going to finish restoring Israel now he's restoring his Gentile bride and we're living in the last days of that restoration he's kept now giving to his church the last of truths that they need to reach this Perfection and that Perfection that they needed to reach it was hid behind Seven Seals the the mystery of Christ and the Mystery of godliness the the mystery of his church was was hid by these Seven Seals and we know that in our generation those seals were open to us and and in the opening of this seals Enlightenment came to the church and that through this Enlightenment that they might know what the fellowship is between the father and the son and the church that they might come into this Fellowship and my might come into uh this great understanding this morning so this morning you've got to realize that that you are important to him and if you were part of of him in the beginning he's not going to fail you no matter what that he has to do to you to get you there we know sometimes he's got to put you flat on your back sometimes you've got to become a total failure sometimes you got you've just got to you you're just going the wrong way and he's just got to step in and and take drastic measures what we trust and hope that that's not the case but praise God if it is because I I want to know that God's going to do whatever it takes to get me there and he has that ability but he's not going to do it without having fellowship with me in it because that was the other one of the other purposes of God is that he wanted to have fellowship with you so this morning he's wanting to have fellowship with you he's wanting to reach out to you he's wanting to touch you he's wanting to stimulate you you he he's wanting to bring you around if I could say this to his way of thinking and so if I if I had a title this morning for my message I I would call it leadership by thinking or look at your thinking look at your thinking and I I didn't realize how important that was as I was I just was talking and thinking about leadership and having the mind of Christ and all these things and and the the word just kept speaking back to me the Lord did he just kept saying thinking man's filter thinking man's filter and you know I heard that about 15 times you know I'm a little thick-headed and a little that's just the way I am I'm Irish you know what I mean then and uh we like to travel so if uh you know God wants to get you on something normally you take a trip I think Jonah was Irish if you get my point so it it struck me so okay this great thought I have is an original oh that's humble down Dave you know what I mean I laid this in the word the only reason that you're starting to think this way is because it's something you need you know it was like oh it was great I've got this thought and I'm going to bring this sermon and and you know I need to bring a good sermon now and every now and then you know and I mean I've got one in ten I'd be happy with that and all of a sudden it's just struck me this isn't something that I'm just looking to preach this is something that's been stored up connect he's bringing to me now to show me this is something that if you're going to reach that goal of having uh being without spot without wrinkle without blemish that there's something that you've got to achieve there's something that you've got to take charge of there's something that's got to happen within you in order for you to be christ-like it struck me in a different light in a different realization oh okay you're wanting to take me up higher in in and I'm not going to go further and tell I overcome this part of my nature you understand so and I'm putting myself in the boat with you I'm not here lecturing you this morning I'm not here saying this is what you need this is what you've got to do I'm trying to say this with all of my heart this morning it's something that I realize in my heart and in my spirit that this body of Believers this bride This Woman This elected lady that keeps fitted and joined together by people from all different walks of life all different backgrounds everything that this is an accomplishment that the whole church has to make and uh just as the office of a pastor this morning I feel I can be that spokesman okay so it's this is not nickelodeonism this morning this is hey all of us need to understand that God sent a messenger we understand that we also know that that the Bible and the message aren't two different things you understand if the message came from the Bible then it'll have the same characteristics of the Bible you understand if something came from a of a bumblebee had a bumble bee the Bumblebee's going to sting you understand so yeah we don't have to go through all of the things about you being in your grandfather and all the attributes of God we've almost wore those things out in fact we've warned the Theology of this message out but we haven't got the life of it working in US heck and I feel this morning that the reason the life is not working in us even the way that we want it to is we haven't overcome this one process so we know that that there that they come from the same source and so uh and that the word when we talk about the word we we say that the word is a thought expressed right so the word is the thinking of God that's what the word is the word is how God thinks may I say it like this the word is the way that God would approach every circumstance and everything that ever came up yeah how he would approach every person every trial every uh dismay that's what he told Joshua he said Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for I am the Lord thy God I am with you I'll go with you wherever you go so we we understand that that the word is the thinking of God the thinking of God so and we see that the they were led by something and Leadership the prophet of God makes this statement he said the question is what are you led by now okay so we're led by our thinking that's why when we spoke a while back and and sometimes I look back on my sermons and I thought I began to understand while you were putting that together you were talking to me you know and and perception is not reality the word is reality perception is your thinking this is what you're thinking you're thinking it's this way you're thinking it's that way you're thinking this and you're thinking that and you've got all these thoughts boiling up and so that becomes how that you're LED and that was the question the question is what's leading you so something there's something out there that's being influenced and we know this story of of the Prophet going into the temple and and he runs into the temple and he was the friend of Uriah I believe it was right what was that prophet's name good enough for me so Isaiah goes in there right and he he goes in there and he was influenced by Uriah his Bible quiz my pop quiz out here it's okay and what did he prophesied he was influenced and then we heard the message the influence the message influence so he's trying to tell us his influence you know so we we [Music] uh understand that there's a lot of things that influence our thinking and are our thinking is believe it or not what's leading you 've done what's going on in your mind is leading you now to tie that back in the greatest battle ever fought is the battle in your mind for your thinking it's not a battle outside of you between two great things we know that that there's a spiritual warfare right and he's the prince of the Aaron and so he's got control of the world and of the air and he controls that influence but God only controls one thing that's truth amen do you understand he only controls one thing that's his thinking that's what he controls he controls the way that he thinks because he can't think outside of what that he is Hallelujah so he is his thinking he is his word you are caught in the middle right you came in the world speaking lies and God's been trying to get us to think the way he thinks that's his goal that's his purpose because once we do that things change though as I was looking at this because I want if you could uh uh I'd like to read this little statement first if I could out of thinking man's filter and if the brothers could uh maybe see if I can find that here I think it's paragraph uh 53. you know and I know there's in this message thinking men's filter there's a lot of things you understand I am not capable it would take me a lifetime to preach what brother Brown put in one message because it's spiritual food in due season I believe that this message can these this is one of the last messages that brother Branham preached in 1960 uh August of 1965. I think it's the 22nd so I believe that he knows it's coming to the end I I loved how brother bisco brought that out and he focused on the last five messages but I I just stepped back a little bit and I said this is something he's trying to get to us this is something he's trying to get to us he knows that we've got to grab grasp this in order to move into that perfection and so listen to this story um and I'll try to read it and we'll just go through this study are you okay this morning hey amen so uh you know I I wish we were a mega church and when you got tired you could go to the coffee bar and get a cup of coffee and maybe get a sandwich and come back in and sit in church and everything you know but I I'd rather be a place where the word is he said a young fellow was telling me the other day that he was down to an army camp a young Soldier got run over by a tank his lungs his stomach or whatever it was punctured and they went up to the hospital they had three or four doctors standing there in line and everybody's standing in line and two or three soldiers holding their buddy up and him just barely could breathe every time he every time he'd breathe that rib would stick right into his lung and that would make him bleed inwardly and they let that young man stand there in that line way back in the back of the line and and let them some of them guys with nothing but a earache or something go ahead no I got a point here if the Lord will help me but about that time he got up there some Colonel come in with a little child that had a rash his little boy or girl had a rash on his hand and they stopped that line and put that Colonel's child in and that boy punctured dying there you are oh if that Colonel would have been a genuine feeling for his brother out there in the line he would have said that kid can't wait give that man up here quickly do something for him but every man wants to show his authority now they're not all like that no they're not all like that but there's too many like that there's too many of them that's like that but the man only one thing he was thinking of was his own little boy that had a rash on his hand and not thinking about the poor boy standing there mashed under a tank the very tank that might be be the very boy that would save his life someday on the battlefield see they don't stop to think only for themselves and when I read that it struck me and he says they don't stop to think that man's thinking was wrong I'm a colonel my cut you know I got things to do I'm busy I can't be wasting time you know what I mean he we I don't know all the background to the story why he rushed up there and everything but he said he wasn't thinking his thinking wasn't right and when that struck me in my heart I began to to understand a little bit more uh why that message leadership was so impressed upon my heart so he points out he's going to preach to this whole sermon now about thinking man's filter and we'll touch on it but what drove him to that wasn't only the cigarette pack but it caused him to realize in this message that what he was addressing was people with wrong thinking they don't discern the situation they don't stop and think and ask themselves what's really going on here people are way too quick to get in a huff and a puff and we understand that he also addressed this to us in the message letting off the pressure causes people to do things that they normally wouldn't do but we don't stop and get our composure and ask ourselves what's leading me what kind of thinking is going on in my mind that's causing me to make this decision I remember one time a man came to me and he said to me he said Brother David I've been blessed here I've got Revelation here I found my wife here my kids got baptized here he says but I've never made a lot of money here okay he said I got an opportunity for a good job I'm going to go out and take it because I want to be financially blessed none of his family serving the lord but you understand that was caused by the thinking that entered into his mind just like sickness sickness comes sickness isn't the problem it's the thinking that comes with sickness oh this is going to kill me oh I'm going to be sick oh I've got to be in fear oh I sinned or if we could get his thinking we would say Satan all sickness is of the devil it isn't the sickness that's the problem it's the thinking that comes with it that's right that's what's got to be washed he says the thinking was wrong and Coke in this sermon if they could say I begin to see that that this great thought that our messenger have is carrying over into all these sermons the rapture remarkable about the Rapture the thing that we when we preach that it was understanding we've got to have what on our mind the rapture it's all about the rapture well what's keeping us from obtaining the character that we need to go into that other dimension because you're going to leave everything else here but your character your character is determined by your thinking humility is not the way you act it's the way you think you can fake humility you can be all Meek and humble but you just think you know I'm so meek I'm so humble I've got the sweetest spirit you know I'm just you know if they had Saints in the message I'd be I'd be seated you know everybody they ought to look to me for an example oh how are you brother oh Lord bless you and in my heart I'm going this poor sorry guy he thinks he's a preacher oh you don't think Jesus addressed that right with their lips they worship me but their hearts what is your heart your their thinking is far from me so he he's addressing this so so let's just read these few quotes if you would paragraph 129 of leadership I'm trying to I'm trying to this morning take the time to bring this down to you where you will start looking at and understand that you've got to look at your thinking the Bible is not a set of binoculars it's a mirror it's a mirror it's not a binocular the Bible and the message to us has become a set of binoculars for for some people they use it to hunt fault or doctrine what do you believe I mean you know what I mean forget it what is it to you if they tarry till I come what was Jesus trying to do hey guys you're thinking wrong you're thinking your thinking's not right what is it to you what if he does this but he says wait a minute everybody stop thinking this way that's the wrong thinking what is it to you if he tarries till I come you follow me and now in leadership what's he talking about leadership so can you imagine as holy As You Are as believing as you are as spiritual as you are you can have something that's leading you you could dress it up with religion you can put a message code on it you could have you can compare yourself with everybody and everything's fine and still be led by the angel of Light oh you heard me right the angel of Light Satan appears as an angel of light not the boogeyman Darkness guy with the Pitchfork he's subtle surely you won't die what did he do the Lord said the day I eat thereof the Dale idea surely you won't die what did he Institute reasoning reasoning is a form of what thinking so every time that you come in contact with the word there is a process that automatically starts whether you like it or not you know can just the way it is he uses the same tactic that he uses if it worked on a daughter of God don't you think he thinks it'll work on you the Willing ignorance to for whatever reason to set aside the word of God and take our own thinking so we have this great story here and we know that the boy came up to him and said good master notice he believed there was something different than what he had or he would have never said good Master what must I do now that's paragraph 129 in the message uh uh leadership and I believe that was preached in see if we can find it here I I I'd like to see if they could put this up there for you um okay it's on I think it's on the cover isn't it so I'm sure it's in okay so it's uh 1207. so paragraph 129 if they get up there oh he had never said good Master what must I do now see he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do we want to do something ourselves now so that's a thinking he was thinking what must I do to inherit eternal life do you understand the thinking see he didn't look at the way he was thinking sometimes we don't look at the way we're thinking we're thinking it and just because it's our thoughts we think that it's got some truth to it you understand when I say Amen who is the biggest I'm the biggest deceiver of myself I'm My Own Worst Enemy right just because I'm thinking it don't make it right and even if something's right it doesn't mean my thinking about it's correct what must I do you see how beautifully the messenger lays that in there what must I do what must I do oh what a question see he wanted to do something to self that's the way we do we want to do something ourselves the gifts of God is a free gift God give it to you you don't do one thing for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it see Hallelujah notice he knew it was there he believed in it and wanted it but when he confronted confronted with how he had to do it it was different from his ritual now he's confronted with something what's he being confronted with a different way of thinking it was different you think that if God's Gonna deal with you he's going to give you the same old thing after you've heard the message over and over again as the eagle stirth his nest how he makes the nest uncomfortable how he blows all the feathers to get you out of it after you've heard the teaching over and over again about the Potter and the clay and how he breaks it down how we've got real comfortable in our religion comparing ourselves one for another just dressing ourselves up into the message he says when God deals with you it's going to be something different different than where you are right he's not interested in putting makeup on your condition he's interested in what washing you taking the wrinkle out the car runs fine but it's got a wrinkle in it it's got a blemish on it he's not condemning you he's perfecting you and he's trying to tell us stop stop and think everybody stop a moment look at yourself look at your mind look at your life just don't take everything that comes in he can hold his money and belong to the church that he belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew that he knew that he had hoarded his money and he said go sell all you got and give it to the poor and come take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven what he approached he knew how he thought he knew how he was thinking do you understand so what did he approach he approached the thinking he didn't approach the riches I don't know how the story would go if he would have said master I'll put it all up for sale tomorrow Jesus might have said you don't have to do that you go be a Shining Light you give your ties to the temple you support the work you don't know what the outcome of that would be that's our problem we pre-plan the outcome of things in our mind we prejudge people we prejudge circumstances we we got somehow there's a part of us that we feel we've got to figure it out I've been led to do something that I just don't make no sense to me in the light of everything that's going on but I knew God told me to do it he's got a reason so you're better off ditching you're thinking let's just read this real quick he said he said but he couldn't do it the other leaders that he had in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ the only one who holds eternal life the only one that can give you it not the church can give you eternal life not your neighbor not your pastor not your priest not your Creed only Jesus himself can give you eternal life no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of Jesus Christ and then when you do that his word and then your life fits right in the word and it manifests itself to this age that you're living in this theme is really not a new theme but it's something that's become so common that we don't recognize that it's happening in US we've got binoculars instead of mirrors let this mind be in you that was in Christ right right but is it no because you've got to go through the battle to get the thinking you've got to go through the reasoning you've got to look at the situation you've got to get what oh I'm just preaching you Leaf if you want you got the five senses you've got the five inward census right you those are all speaking to you they're all influencing you you've got the past you've got all these different things now you're confronted with something you just don't say oh let this mind be in me that was in Christ Hallelujah I'm going to go do a good work ah you've got to take the kingdom of God by force you've got to fight the reasoning you've got to fight the emotions you've got to fight the feelings oh I'm just gonna go here prophet of God said I'm just gonna go live in the mountains I'm going to get a message from God I'm going to come out of the woods and yeah great thinking you don't think he battled through that sure he did he battled through it oh Dad look that looks like you and and Banks or whoever it was he said you know oh yeah that looks great to me in the Lord he got the DNA yeah go ahead lose your family lose your church lose all this he had to go through the battle the battles for the thinking it's not the discernment of this is right and this is wrong it's not what you do or you don't do or what you start doing there's a process that's working in every single one of us and it goes on daily it's worse than this age than it's ever been because there's so many outlets so many inlets so much poisoning so much things so much stuff you're getting in fact they're trying to get it to where you can't even use your mind pretty soon when you're gonna talk you're gonna sound like Google you're just going to spout out some Wikipedia definition [Music] you know hey you might you ever hear the expression you're fighting for your lives you're thinking for your lives today you're thinking for your lives so much of the scripture was was given so we looked at what did he think he says oh look at his thought process I have a lot what will I do he says come follow me where are we going what would I do where is he leading me I remember well fellow came to me one time he says I feel led to go to these meetings in such and such place said praise God then he said but if I don't get a ride I feel led to go here yeah so wait a minute if God led me to go to these meetings I'd walk I'd start out walking I'd gone to that meeting and I get thinking on God's word I hope I would do this okay you know what I'm saying I'm just being honest with you because I want you to catch this this morning but wouldn't it let's put it this way wouldn't it be Babel God told me to go to this meetings I'm just going to start walking I feel led of the Lord and it just get meditating on Philip get in that realm of God's word God you can transport me to this meeting if it's your will your word doesn't fail you will perform your word get a different thinking going and different things will happen the reason we got the same problems over and over again is because we're set right in a Channel of religious thinking and we're using the message to sugarcoat our thoughts I hope that wasn't too strong but you know what will people think you know look you know what if it's wrong that's what's happened to a lot of people what if the message is wrong oh let that little bug get started in your ear let that thinking go well you know it was a rocket ship and you know every kind of unbelieving excuse that comes on let some other thinking go on but there's a lot of thinking in our lives about a lot of things that he's trying to change and I'll try to close quickly now I think but you look at the in Luke the 10th chapter of Luke I'm sure many of you know this great story the disciples had just come back Jesus had sent them out in twos and they they went out and they had done what Jesus said they prayed for the sick and people got well they told the news about the Messiah being there they preached the gospel that they had learned the Revelation they had of who they were following and and they had great signs and wonders a great meeting m M and and they came back and he said I beheld Satan has lightning falling from heaven behold I gave unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and overall power of the enemy and None Shall be any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not now what is he addressing he's addressing the state of mind and the thinking that they're in now let me move this to another level State of Mind when your mind gets in a certain state then you look and your thinking comes from the state of mind you're in another terminology a lot of times for state of mind is complex if you don't careful you view your whole life through a complex everything you think is based on your complex your inability how you what you feel about yourself you feel you're a failure every bit of that's a lie right right because it's not what he said so he said don't rejoice in that he says because but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven now that is the key if I could say that to to uh the key to a believer is is when that they can look look at he says he says and this is in page 171 of think you meant filthy he says Israel was all outwardly spiritual all filled with God's goodness and how they reverence God and so forth but that didn't work the inside of them couldn't recognize the word itself but when you're born of the spirit of God then you've got you've got you are a son of God you always was a Son of God and you'll always be a Son of God no way to separate it because you have eternal life and eternal life never did begin neither will it end you understand what Jesus is giving him to is the key of thinking he said don't Rejoice because of these signs and wonders and I'm telling you the church has got to the place where they're rejoicing in signs and wonders instead of rejoicing that their name is written in heaven so he's giving them the key to thinking once you can get this key thought in your mind you will approach every other thing through that state of mind yeah but if he can keep you from embracing that accepting your election keep you from absolutely understanding by a shadow of a doubt I am a child of God regardless I was birthed by him in the beginning I have eternal life it's eternal life it always was it always will be it was his thinking now you're anchored amen now your State of Mind changes if you're still a sinner's trying to struggle to get to heaven I hope you make it it's not a very happy life and you'll be judged for your works and if your works are consumed by fire you will be saved by fire but oh if I could get this mind in me if I could get this fine to me this is what Jesus says listen listen to this this morning in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and hath revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight and all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father whom and who the father is but the son for he to whom the son will reveal him if I could if I know that he the Pete revealed them to me I'm now starting at the first step of the Statue of a perfect man we've been trying to build the Statue of a perfect man having got our thinking down right we're just adding all kinds of stuff now we finally come to the end of our roads and we're not who we say we are no we could fake everybody out but it's not our actions it's not the way we dress it's not what we believe it's the way we think stop a moment ask yourself what state of mind am I in how am I thinking am I looking at this like a Christian am I feeling what are these feelings I'm having stop a moment those feelings don't rule you there's one thing that rules you and that's God's word you're elected you're chosen your name's written in heaven stop you've got access to the word of God it's been given to you to so you can think by it heaven even the world said as a as a man thinketh so he is that a scripture yes yes good the world needs it think of that as a man thinketh what do you think he's after he's after your minds the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to Bath don't condemn yourselves stop a moment how am I thinking how am I thinking am I thinking through the word I can't finish there's so much unfolding that I'll just I'll just close maybe I can maybe the Rapture will come I don't have to pick this up ever again where was I Luke 10 I believe right okay he says in Jesus rejoiced and let me reveal them and he turned unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see what's he trying to get to him he's trying to get to their thinking blessed are you for the things you've seen may I say this to you this morning blessed are ye for the things you've seen at least you've seen it for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which he see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them have you ever thought of that this message isn't a burden it's the truth and you've got you've got to you've got to sit down and have a good look at your thinking and who's influencing you and what you're following and what your participation in you need to look at this church this body this ministry you got to look at it through God's word that's right now watch this and we're close and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and he said in them what is written in the law how read us doubt and he answered and said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou hath answered right this do and thou shalt live wow but he willingly but he willing to justify himself said to Jesus and who is my neighbor Jesus answered and said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reign of it and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side what was he thinking and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he Journey came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went to him and bound up his wounds poured the oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pins and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatever thou spendeth more when I come again I will repay thee which of these three think is thou was neighbor unto him that fell Amongst Thieves what is he addressing here he's addressing their thinking now just to make this clear when I read my last quote is this is what God's asking you this morning or if I could say this instructing us or telling us it's time Church it's time to ask yourself what are you thinking how are you thinking where's your thinking coming from it's almost like we're standing right on the verge of going into the Capstone which I'm longing for the love of God being shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit and it's like the spirit saying Church you've got a wrinkle your wrinkle is the way you think about stuff it's how you gossip how we tell everybody else's business oh you know such and such as they got in trouble and did you know got a ticket and you know every time I come to church I dread me being pulled over on the side of the road and everybody come by I got a ticket so what I'll get an attorney I'll go to defensive driving I'll pay more for my insurance it's not the end of my life which one of you can cast the first stone we don't think we don't we we we we we just don't go through the thinking process and like that's the you know then Jesus said you know in Matthew 22 21 they said who's what about paying taxes look at how he changed their thinking Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's to God the things that are God you know in John us 8-7 he they were all getting a stoner he sat down he says which of you that have sinned not let the one who's never sinned cast the first stone what's he doing hit everything that Jesus did he did nothing until he had the mind of the Lord we can't go on this morning we can't go on having these mind battles and not ending up with a word result we can't let frustrations we can't let perceptions we can't let things Jesus told if someone Smite you on the cheek turn the other to everything about what he preached was about trying to get a different mindset how can two walk together if they don't agree no can in the thinking men's filter brother Benson's a great amount of time about loving the world and the things of the world and I wanted to get into all that about the what draws you and how these emotions but it's all within that message but I'd like to just say this and as I read this closing remark and see if I can find it here and this is in paragraph 21. and he mentions Esau and Esau didn't think but this message is called thinking men's filter and if I could sum up the theme of this message what brother branham's trying to to grasp us to grasp is you've got to filter your thinking and he talks all about denominations how they filter to get a taste and he's telling the church he said you can't filter it you've got to use God's filter and it's God's filter is his word so we've come up through life we're facing so many circumstances the messenger leads us this message right at the end he's saying now you've got to learn or if I could say this not just learn it but you've got to come to the place where you're filtering every thought through the word if you don't you're gonna get a taste that's different so it's imperative that you understand there's a battle in your mind that you're going to draw thinking and conclusions and thoughts from your senses and from your emotions and from everything that's around you but you've got to stop and say I need to filter what is going on through the word of God I've got to filter my thinking through the word of God I've got to filter My Worship I've got to filter my Doctrine I've got to filter where I go to church I've got to filter my job I've got to filter everything through the word because I'll never reach perfection if I have imperfect thoughts and I'm never gonna become what I want to become when I act on my own thinking I so want my heart to be different I want I just want to think different I I don't want to be influenced I don't want to be pushed I don't want to I don't want to rest in a bank account I don't want to rest in a job I want to rest in the bosom of Abraham this is a condemnation this is trying to tell us this morning that we've come to the time we've come to the hour it's never been required of us until now but we're ready to make that next step and it's not going to happen by a worship service is not going to happen by tremendous preaching it's not going to happen by signs and wonders it's going to happen by the renewing of your mind by the washing of the water of the word that's how it's going to change when this mind that was in him becomes your mind when you start thinking the way he thinks you start looking the way he looks this is where we're at church and I'll stand here because I've got thus saith the Lord I'm going to read it go listen to it what are we thinking what do you think about your career I could I could just run hours and hours of how that brother Branham approached the ways he thinks but I'd like to close with this statement this morning the musicians can come the other Ram says I'm going to say something this is paragraph the statement right before it I'm going to say something as brother McCullough used to say listen to me when you come into this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance you were born in sin shaped in iniquity came to the world speaking lies within your own spirit the desire of sin a lover of sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance that was your mind but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that began to draw if you know it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word then you took the church you took their ideas when you were told better then you never used a thinking man's filter but when you use God's filter which is a thinking man's filter because all other filters will pass away but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter a thinking man's filter there is nothing left but the Holy Ghost how many wants the Holy Ghost what good does it do to be anointed top of my mind if you still got a mind but if you'll draw your desires you're thinking everything through the filter of God's word there'll be nothing left but the Holy Ghost oh God [Music] let me start today when when someone says something to you just stop a moment what should I do here what's the word say how many of what the word says blessed are ye when you're reviled and reviled back how can I get that to be the Forefront in my thinking if you're compelled to give your coat give your cloak also Prophet God said always give someone the benefit of the doubt oh they didn't mean that [Music] we're trying to fix things trying to do things ourselves when it's so simple [Music] just let the word become your thinking he is the word if you think the way he thinks you are him [Music] isn't that what it's all about I want to be like Jesus I want to have the right heart I want to have the right spirit I want peace that's your path's understanding [Music] stop [Music] what's leading me is it my thoughts that are leading me am I going to go chew this man out because I'm upset what's the word
