[9:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, and the reason that I live.
[9:50] Oh, I worship
[9:53] you.
[9:55] Hallelujah. I believe there's no better
[9:58] reason to live than live for you to
[10:00] worship him. Amen. Certainly glad to be
[10:02] gather in his presence. But abandon if
[10:04] we could just come and open our service
[10:06] and pray.
[10:11] Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly
[10:13] father, Lord,
[10:15] we're happy to be gathered in your
[10:17] house, Lord Jesus, on this Wednesday
[10:19] night. Father, as the song says, Lord, I
[10:22] worship you. Father, the reason we live
[10:25] is to worship you.
[10:28] Father, it's not enough just to speak
[10:30] with words, Lord, but may our lives be a
[10:32] worship to you, Father. All that we do,
[10:35] Father, all of our actions, Father, may
[10:38] it all worship and glorify your holy
[10:40] name. Father, Lord, we just ask you to
[10:43] be with us during this time. For you
[10:45] said, where two or three are gathered,
[10:46] there in the midst you'll be, Lord, we
[10:49] know who's here. It's not a man. It's
[10:52] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:54] himself. And he's come with a purpose to
[10:56] speak to his children, Lord Jesus. Open
[10:59] our hearts to receive, Father. Lord,
[11:02] we're sitting at your operating table
[11:04] preparing for surgery, Lord Jesus. May
[11:07] you do what you need, Lord Jesus. Let us
[11:09] not be in the way, Lord. Let us not
[11:12] hinder anything, Father. But Lord Jesus,
[11:15] we want to be operated on Father, that
[11:17] when we leave here, there is a change in
[11:20] our lives, Lord Jesus, in all that we
[11:22] do, Lord Jesus. Once again, Father, let
[11:25] it be a worship to you, Father. I pray a
[11:28] blessing, Lord, over the remaining of
[11:30] the worship, Lord Jesus, when the man
[11:32] gets up here to speak, Lord Jesus, use
[11:35] him, Father. Set him aside, Father.
[11:38] Lord, if there's any need, Lord Jesus,
[11:42] anything that's coming through this
[11:43] door, Lord, you're the great physician.
[11:45] Lord Jesus, you're the strength giver.
[11:48] Father, you're the answer to all the
[11:50] problems that we have, Father. We just
[11:52] lift up our requests and supplications
[11:54] to you, Lord. Knowing, Lord, that it's
[11:56] not in vain, Father, but thy word has
[11:59] the power to answer all, Lord Jesus. Let
[12:02] us be ready, Father, and grab the
[12:04] blessing that has come for forth this
[12:06] pulpit, Lord Jesus.
[12:08] reach out by faith and grab our portion,
[12:10] Lord Jesus, so we can say surely it was
[12:13] a good time in your house, Lord. We
[12:15] thank you and we ask these things in the
[12:16] precious, wonderful name of the Lord
[12:18] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[12:22] Amen. Amen. God bless you. I want to
[12:24] welcome everyone in the house of God and
[12:26] all our visitors. Amen. If you could
[12:28] turn around and welcome someone tonight.
[12:30] Amen. It's good to have uh brother,
[12:33] sister Jidita's brother with us, brother
[12:35] Jolio from Congo. We certainly welcome
[12:38] him tonight. Amen.

[21:16] It's been a tough year for them.
[21:24] Let's just bow our heads.
[21:28] Gracious and kind heavenly father,
[21:32] we come as children
[21:36] looking up to one that can provide all
[21:38] of our needs, everything,
[21:41] Lord, that we're short.
[21:44] All the the broken pieces,
[21:48] [Music]
[21:50] Lord, we just lay them before you,
[21:55] Lord. just work your will in our lives,
[21:57] we pray.
[21:59] Lead us how you'd see fit.
[22:02] And Lord, do the things that your word
[22:05] promised to do in this day,
[22:07] [Music]
[22:09] Lord, that's to
[22:13] to have a body,
[22:15] a group of people,
[22:18] Lord, that can live in unity
[22:20] because they're following the same word.
[22:23] They believe the same things.
[22:28] Lord, your word is eternal
[22:31] and you said you wouldn't lose a one.
[22:34] So, as we sit here tonight, Lord,
[22:35] there's many upon our hearts and lives
[22:38] that
[22:40] we come in contact with and our hearts
[22:42] go out to.
[22:45] Lord, we just don't see
[22:50] how they can make that choice or find
[22:53] your provided way. We don't understand
[22:57] it all, Lord.
[22:59] But we have compassion.
[23:02] We also have a belief, Lord, that your
[23:04] word will be fulfilled. So tonight,
[23:07] Lord,
[23:09] even though we come as
[23:13] faithbelieving saints, Lord, with many,
[23:16] many needs upon our hearts, we also come
[23:18] rejoicing. We come thankful, Lord.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; That we even have access
[23:24] &gt;&gt; that you're still on the mercy seat
[23:26] tonight, Lord. Yeah.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we just combine our faith
[23:30] together.
[23:32] Lift up our voices in unison to say,
[23:35] &gt;&gt; "Oh Lord, just come quickly."
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Bless us tonight, Lord, when your word
[23:40] pours forth that each one of us,
[23:46] Lord, can be spoken to, not just lip to
[23:49] ear, but Lord, down in the the inside of
[23:52] the inside. all those doors in our
[23:54] hearts. Lord, may they all swing open
[23:57] and may you just clean us from inside
[23:59] and out. Lord, we ask Lord that
[24:02] everything would be put under the blood.
[24:04] As we leave this place, we can say,
[24:06] "Surely, surely I've been blessed for
[24:08] being in the house of the Lord tonight."
[24:11] Lord, just use us for your honor and
[24:12] your glory. Use these tithes and
[24:15] offerings we collect for your benefit,
[24:16] Lord. Lord, those that aren't here
[24:19] tonight, Lord, we we remember them as
[24:21] well. And truly, Lord, the universal
[24:24] bride of Christ around this world, Lord,
[24:27] prepare us. And may we look up for our
[24:30] redemption drawth nigh. We ask all these
[24:32] things in the lovely name of the Lord
[24:34] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[24:41] Oh, God will make a way
[24:46] [Music]
[24:48] where there seems to be no way.
[24:55] Oh, he works in ways
[24:58] we cannot see.
[25:02] He will make a way for me.
[25:09] He will be my God.

[25:21] Oh, and with love and strength
[25:25] for each new day

[25:35] God will make you believe that tonight.
[25:39] Let's just sing it one more time. Oh,
[25:41] and God will make a way
[25:48] where there seems to be no way.

[33:39] my life is in your

[33:48] such comfort in knowing that nothing can
[33:52] pluck us out of that hand. That was your
[33:55] word.
[33:57] All the father hath given me will come.
[34:01] That you wouldn't lose a one and that
[34:03] your sheep heard your voice and another
[34:05] they wouldn't follow. Father, may we
[34:08] take refuge and comfort
[34:10] in the kind, comforting words that you
[34:13] spoke to us, encouraging us, Father,
[34:15] that we can make it and by your grace
[34:20] and mercy that we can overcome. We trust
[34:23] that you'll continue to lift us up into
[34:26] your glory and your goodness that we can
[34:29] be a burning reflecting light of your
[34:32] love for us, Father, that they may know
[34:35] that you love us and that we love one
[34:38] another. And that this great love's
[34:41] available to all that would enter in. We
[34:44] ask it in Jesus precious and wonderful
[34:47] name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[34:51] We we uh uh brother Paul's going to
[34:54] preach for us tonight and and I will
[34:58] admit that I put pressure on him to
[35:01] preach in English.
[35:03] So you just reach out there and just
[35:07] suck the words right out of his his
[35:10] spirit and and he'll minister to us. Uh
[35:14] this weekend Leslie and I are are going
[35:16] to uh they're having a service. It's for
[35:20] brother Biscll as you know. He passed
[35:22] away I believe last Tuesday and
[35:26] a week or so back and uh they're having
[35:29] just a service. It's uh not really a
[35:32] memorial service but people are coming
[35:35] just to pay our respects and and to let
[35:39] the family know that we love them and
[35:41] they've always been a part of us. And
[35:43] then brother Tom and brother Mike and
[35:46] them will be here to preach for us for
[35:48] our November meeting. So, we're looking
[35:51] forward to that. And also, our October
[35:54] 19th uh family uh day is coming up. So,
[35:58] let's keep those things in prayer. So,
[36:02] you love the Lord this evening. The
[36:05] Lord's good. So, we're looking forward
[36:08] to uh uh ministering uh this Sunday, but
[36:12] we're listening forward to the word
[36:14] tonight. if our heart stays the same,
[36:17] we'll probably be ministering at a

[40:30] house
[40:32] is just by your grace.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Nothing else, just your grace.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; So we pray, oh Lord, that
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] You come and open the world for us
[40:49] and teach us.
[40:53] Bless brother David
[40:57] and each one of your sons and daughters
[41:00] here tonight.
[41:04] We just surrender everything in your
[41:05] hands
[41:07] believing that you'll calm yourself
[41:12] and preach your word
[41:15] because nobody no one is worthy to
[41:18] preach it
[41:20] unless you do it through him.
[41:25] Thank you Lord.
[41:27] We love you tonight
[41:30] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[41:34] Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[41:40] As for the David say, I don't know if
[41:45] I will do it, but we just s that with
[41:48] Jesus we can make it.
[41:52] That's right.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Since last time I preach in English, but
[41:57] the David every time asked me to preach
[42:00] in English and he said that
[42:04] he doesn't want me to go back in French.
[42:10] Just keep going on. So let's take our
[42:14] Bible in the book of Ephesians chapter
[42:19] 3.
[42:27] Ephesians chapter 3, we start with the
[42:30] verse 13.
[42:32] The Bible say,
[42:35] "Wherefore I desire that ye f not at my
[42:39] tribulation
[42:41] for you, which is your glory.
[42:45] For this cause I bow my knees unto the
[42:48] father our lord Jesus Christ
[42:51] of whom the whole family in the heaven
[42:54] and earth is named. Amen. that he would
[42:58] grant you according to the riches of his
[43:01] glory to be strengthened with might be
[43:04] his spirit in the in a man
[43:07] &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your heart by
[43:10] faith that he being rooted and grounded
[43:13] in love may be able to comprehend it
[43:17] with all saint what is the breath the
[43:20] length the depth and the heart
[43:23] &gt;&gt; and to know the love of Christ which
[43:27] passes knowledge that you might be
[43:29] filled with all the fullness of God.
[43:34] Now unto him that is able to do
[43:37] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[43:41] ask or think according to the power that
[43:45] workketh in us. and to him be glory in
[43:50] the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[43:53] all ages, word without end. Amen.
[43:58] You can be seated.
[44:02] When I told my wife
[44:04] this morning that brother David asked me
[44:07] to preach in English,
[44:09] she said, "Oh my God, I think you the
[44:13] service won't be long.
[44:16] [Laughter]
[44:20] because I think you you should not have
[44:22] more word to say as when you preach in
[44:25] French. I say I'm going to do something.
[44:27] So I don't know if the service will be
[44:30] long or not. I don't know.
[44:33] Just let the Holy Spirit lead us and try
[44:37] to say something.
[44:39] And
[44:42] you know it like when the baby is
[44:45] learning to speak
[44:49] sometime you want to say mommy is going
[44:52] to say mama but you can understand is
[44:55] calling mommy.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; So maybe I want to say baby but I say
[45:01] baby. You're going to understand what I
[45:04] want to say.
[45:06] just
[45:09] just keep me in prayer. I I know my wife
[45:11] is praying for me. So you can join her
[45:13] and
[45:14] &gt;&gt; so I can do something for the Lord. So
[45:18] according to the
[45:21] scripture we we we read
[45:26] the Lord put on my heart something I can
[45:31] take from the
[45:37] uh the verse 15 of Ephesians third
[45:43] the Bible say that all family in heaven
[45:47] &gt;&gt; and Earth at name by the name of Jesus
[45:50] Christ.
[45:53] And I know that we are all sons and
[45:56] daughters of God.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; We are member of God's family.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; We are member of Jesus Christ family.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And like in the world in some family or
[46:11] in all family
[46:14] we have some benefit. Yes.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; So tonight I want to talk about the
[46:19] benefit of being a member of Jesus
[46:23] family.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; What benefit we have to be a member of
[46:29] Jesus family.
[46:32] If we can come to the church every time
[46:36] we have service,
[46:39] it's because we have something in our
[46:42] hearts
[46:44] &gt;&gt; telling us that we have a part of
[46:47] something.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; We have me we are member of that family.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. And so every time we have
[46:57] families meeting,
[47:00] we have to show up
[47:02] &gt;&gt; and to know what
[47:05] our
[47:08] household,
[47:09] how a lord, how a king, how a god want
[47:14] to tell us.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; What he want
[47:19] us to be like.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That why every time we come to the
[47:24] church
[47:25] &gt;&gt; sometime we are obliged to surrender
[47:28] something we are doing sometime we let
[47:33] the jobs relate something that could be
[47:36] important for this world but for us we
[47:40] think that the word of God or our
[47:43] family's meaning is more important
[47:49] &gt;&gt; uh somewhere
[47:52] say in law and grace preach
[47:57] June 10th
[48:00] 54
[48:02] paragraph 126
[48:04] he say
[48:06] you become a member
[48:10] you not a servant
[48:13] God don't call you his servant
[48:16] &gt;&gt; but you are a member of his family you
[48:19] become a member
[48:20] You not a servant. You son and
[48:24] daughters.
[48:26] We are now sons and daughters of God.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; A member of God's family.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; My oh my. I might live in a shake, but
[48:41] I'm a I have a blood.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; There you are. a member of the household
[48:51] of God.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; That scripture
[48:55] that what the scripture says
[48:58] what manner of love the father has
[49:02] bestowed upon us.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; See that we should be called the sons of
[49:09] God.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my there we are the membership.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the B talking about the
[49:19] membership of Jesus Christ family of God
[49:23] family
[49:26] I said that in the world I don't know
[49:28] what's benefit the
[49:32] US president families has
[49:36] &gt;&gt; but I think that
[49:38] his family have some benefit
[49:41] &gt;&gt; right
[49:42] &gt;&gt; maybe security maybe I don't know
[49:47] But we want to know
[49:50] we want to know what benefit we have
[49:53] because sometime we are just walking
[49:56] like some people
[49:58] we don't know what they are
[50:01] &gt;&gt; right
[50:03] who's the father
[50:08] &gt;&gt; we think we talk we we do a lot of
[50:11] things
[50:12] sometime
[50:14] we for
[50:17] that our father
[50:20] is the king of kings
[50:22] &gt;&gt; is the lord of lord
[50:25] &gt;&gt; and we have
[50:28] some part of I don't know I can't say
[50:31] part but we have the full
[50:34] &gt;&gt; benefit of his kingdom
[50:39] &gt;&gt; as a Christian we have a full benefit of
[50:43] the kingdom so everything God says in
[50:46] the Bible
[50:48] &gt;&gt; every promise
[50:52] &gt;&gt; belong to us.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; That's why we are here tonight. And he
[51:01] said here he did he say oh sorry I say
[51:05] he did in French but he say but when God
[51:10] exalt him so high I here in the second
[51:14] the second seal second seal paragraph
[51:19] 149.
[51:23] But when God exalt him, so I till he has
[51:28] to look down to see heaven.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; See how God in humility.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; See? And he gave him a name so great
[51:41] that the whole family of heaven is named
[51:46] after him.
[51:48] And every family of the earth, all the
[51:52] family on earth is named Jesus.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; All the families in heaven is named
[52:01] Jesus.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; And such name that every knee will bow
[52:07] &gt;&gt; and every tongue will confess
[52:10] &gt;&gt; to him being Lord. Either here or in
[52:15] hell, hell will bow to it.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Everything else will bow to it. See, but
[52:24] first it was humility.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Then it become great.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; See, let God exalt.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; He that humbers himself, God will exalt.
[52:40] See?
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] The Bible say that everything,
[52:48] every power, every thing
[52:52] even the L should bow in the name of
[52:56] Jesus.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; So if
[53:00] our name
[53:02] &gt;&gt; we belong to this family.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. It means that everything
[53:08] &gt;&gt; the devil with all demons everything
[53:12] should bow
[53:14] &gt;&gt; in front of us
[53:15] &gt;&gt; because our name is Jesus.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Every son, every daughter have the name
[53:24] of his father.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That's why we are called Christian.
[53:32] So if in the name of Jesus,
[53:36] one benefit we have is everything.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Everything
[53:45] &gt;&gt; should bow
[53:47] &gt;&gt; in front of us.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I was reading one story in the book of
[53:54] Esther. I think we're going to read it.
[54:12] the book of Esther. I'm going to start
[54:16] with the chapter five,
[54:20] the last verse. I'm going through the
[54:23] sixth chapter. So Esther chapter 5:14
[54:29] Bible say
[54:31] then said
[54:33] Zer his wife Amen wife
[54:38] and all his friend unto him.
[54:41] Let a gallow be made of 50 cubit eye and
[54:46] tomorrow speak thou unto the king that
[54:51] Mukai may be angled.
[54:54] Don then go down and merly with the king
[54:58] unto the banquet
[55:01] and the thing plays ammon and he calls
[55:04] the gallows to be made.
[55:07] That's the devil plan.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; He make it.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; I know that sometime the devil making
[55:13] some plan for each one of us.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; But when the devil's making his plan,
[55:20] &gt;&gt; God looking at you. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Make his plan
[55:29] &gt;&gt; and early in the morning
[55:31] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the plan he come to the
[55:33] king's court. The Bible say chapter six
[55:38] on that night could not the king sleep
[55:42] and he commanded to bring the book of
[55:45] record of chronicles and they were with
[55:49] before the king
[55:51] &gt;&gt; and it was found written that Malachi
[55:55] had told of
[55:58] Batner
[56:01] and Teres two of the king chamber
[56:05] the keepers of the door who sought to
[56:08] lay hand on the king Iserus.
[56:13] And the king said, "What honor and
[56:16] dignity have been done to Madukai for
[56:19] this?" Then say the king's servant that
[56:24] ministry unto him, "There's nothing done
[56:27] for him."
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Did God make a plan? He touched
[56:35] &gt;&gt; he disturbed the sleep of the king.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; He was not able to sleep.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, so I can do something for Amen.
[56:45] Verse four. And the king said, "Who is
[56:48] in the courts?"
[56:50] It was the enemy with his plan.
[56:53] Now Amen was come into the outward part
[56:57] of the king's house to speak unto the
[57:00] king to hang Madukai on the gallows that
[57:03] he had prepared for him.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And the king's servant said unto him,
[57:11] Behold, Herman standeth in the court.
[57:14] And the king said, Let him come in.
[57:17] So Amen coming. And the king say unto
[57:20] him, "What shall be done unto the men
[57:24] whom the king delighted to honor?"
[57:28] &gt;&gt; How a man doubt in his heart
[57:32] to whom who the king delight to honor
[57:36] more than to myself?
[57:40] And Aman answer the king for the man who
[57:43] the king delight to honor. Let the royal
[57:48] apple be brought which the king used to
[57:53] wear and the earth and the king rideth
[57:56] upon and the corn royal which is the set
[57:59] upon his head
[58:01] &gt;&gt; and let this and us be delivered to the
[58:07] end of one of the king's most noble
[58:11] prince
[58:12] that they may
[58:14] that they There heard the man with whom
[58:18] the king delighted to honor and bring
[58:20] him on the horseback
[58:23] to the street of the city and proclaimed
[58:27] before him.
[58:29] Thus shall it be done to the man whom
[58:32] the king delighted to honor.
[58:34] Then the king said to Ammon, "Make us
[58:39] and take the apple and the earth and
[58:42] thou has said and to heaven so to Madai
[58:48] the Jew."
[58:50] That's the best part of the story.
[59:00] That's at the king gate. Let nothing
[59:03] fail. Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; And all that thou hast spoken.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Then took Amen
[59:11] the apple and the o and a roachi and
[59:16] brought him on the oback through the
[59:18] street of the city and proclaimed before
[59:21] him. Then shall it be done and to the
[59:24] man whom the king delighted to honor.
[59:29] And Malachi came again to the king
[59:31] gates. But Ammon as to his house
[59:36] mourning and having his head covered.
[59:40] And Ammon told Zer, his f his wife and
[59:44] all his friend everything that had
[59:48] befallen him.
[59:51] Then saith his wise men
[59:55] and Zerish his wife unto him,
[1:00:00] "If Malachi
[1:00:02] be of the seed of the Jew,
[1:00:06] if Malachi is from Jesus family,
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; before whom thou hast began to fall,
[1:00:15] thou shalt not prevail against him."
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:20] but shall surely
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; fall before him.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; If Malachi,
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; if you
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; is from the seed of Jesus Christ,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; the wise man, the the Malachi wise man
[1:00:46] told if
[1:00:49] it's for the seed of Jew
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; if he's from Jesus family
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; you never
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; never
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; can't prevail against him
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; but every time you try
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; you fall
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; in front of him
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; sometime
[1:01:15] we don't realize who we Ah, that's it.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I think Mukai did nothing. He knew
[1:01:27] nothing.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; But when Ammon make his plan, God,
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; his father make know the plan
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; for him.
[1:01:45] If the devil makes something make a plan
[1:01:47] for you,
[1:01:49] surely God will make another plan for
[1:01:52] you.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Just stand as we stand that he will make
[1:01:59] a way.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; He will do something to keep you,
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; to lead you.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; to take care of you.

[1:04:03] of heaven and earth. And he add nothing
[1:04:07] to it.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; The creator,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; but he add nothing to it
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; until he cursed the tree.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Satan tempted him fasting for us, but he
[1:04:26] received food that the others knew
[1:04:29] nothing about.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; One day he said, "So I have food.
[1:04:35] said, "Why don't you come eat?" He said,
[1:04:39] "I have food that you know not of."
[1:04:42] That's right. He had food that they
[1:04:45] didn't know nothing of.
[1:04:49] He on earth. He had no shadow.
[1:04:54] They say no place, no house, nothing
[1:04:57] belonging to him. But you know what? He
[1:05:00] become a sher for everyone of us.
[1:05:07] That's one of our benefit.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; What kind of shadow we have?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; In front of whom everything should bow.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; God made him a shadow for the whole
[1:05:27] human race.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; He had no shadow for his own but is our
[1:05:33] shadow. Yes.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; They've been talking so much about
[1:05:38] fallout shelters.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We got one.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:05:44] fallout shelters go in some hole and the
[1:05:48] ground and they tell me
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; those palm will eat and blast the all in
[1:05:54] the ground for 150 ft deep for and
[1:06:00] something mile score. Why it will break
[1:06:04] every bone in you if you was a half a
[1:06:08] might deep in the ground. Sure it would
[1:06:12] anywhere but we got a shadow.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Christ is our shadow.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] And he said 151,
[1:06:30] he gave up his sunship
[1:06:33] between him and the father to be made
[1:06:36] sin for us.
[1:06:38] Did you know that
[1:06:40] he knew no sin became sin for us?
[1:06:46] He knew no sin.
[1:06:48] He never sin, but it became a sin for
[1:06:52] us.
[1:06:54] to give us the benefit to be free from
[1:06:57] sin.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Now he can he can make sinners son.
[1:07:07] Amen. That the good part.
[1:07:10] Take sinners and make sons.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Take sinners and make dollars.
[1:07:21] When he give up his sunship to become
[1:07:25] sin,
[1:07:26] now he takes sinners and make sons out
[1:07:30] of them.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; What a privilege.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; What a benefit.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:42] God won't be
[1:07:45] sword on anything.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:07:49] You can't do this become God's seed to
[1:07:53] eat
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; his son became sin offering
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; that he might buy now
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; take sinners
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; and make sons of God out of them.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful thing that is.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Now, yes sir, he gave his strength. He
[1:08:15] became weak
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; that he might be our strength.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; He is our
[1:08:23] sufficient strength.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; We don't need no other strength but the
[1:08:28] strength of the Lord Jesus.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; He is my strength from day to day.
[1:08:35] Without him I would fall.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; That how wonderful.
[1:08:43] What you forsake,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; what you receive
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; for what you ever pursue.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; My forsake the world.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Forsake your own idea.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Forsake your doubt.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Forsake your unbelief.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Forsake your frustration.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Forsake it and receive him.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Believe him.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; God want us just to believe.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; You know that this word at brother David
[1:09:23] preach it
[1:09:26] our thought is every time about our path
[1:09:30] forward.
[1:09:33] Where are we going?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Who we are?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[1:09:46] And what the David preached last time,
[1:09:49] the main thing is we have to have the
[1:09:52] faith in our death
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; really to believe that
[1:09:58] we are died from the world
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; and we can be identified
[1:10:05] with
[1:10:07] God's family
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; to re show our membership
[1:10:13] from this family. There's a lot of
[1:10:15] benefit. I I can I can preach about all
[1:10:19] benefit we have as sons and daughters of
[1:10:22] God.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; But I know that we have all benefit we
[1:10:27] can have in this world.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; But we have to live
[1:10:33] as a member of this family. Yes,
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; our daily life has to be like Christ.
[1:10:48] The Bible say in the book of Romans
[1:10:50] chapter
[1:10:52] 6,
[1:11:01] Romans chapter 6
[1:11:06] verse one.
[1:11:10] What shall we
[1:11:12] say then? Shall we continue in sin that
[1:11:16] grace may abound?
[1:11:19] God forbid,
[1:11:21] how shall we that are dead to sin
[1:11:25] live any longer therein?
[1:11:30] Knowing not that so many of us as were
[1:11:34] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:11:37] into his death.
[1:11:40] Therefore, we are buried with him by
[1:11:44] baptism into death, that like as Christ
[1:11:49] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[1:11:52] of the father, even so we also should
[1:11:55] walk in the newness of life.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; For if we have been planned to together
[1:12:02] in the likeness of his death, we shall
[1:12:05] be also in the likeness of his
[1:12:08] resurrection. Hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Knowing this, that our old man is
[1:12:13] crucified with him.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That the body of sin must be destroyed,
[1:12:19] that henceforth we should not self serve
[1:12:23] sin.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; For he that is dead is freed from sin.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Now if we be dead with Christ, we
[1:12:35] believe that we shall also live with
[1:12:37] him. Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:12:42] the dead died died no more.
[1:12:46] Death have no more dominion over him.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; For in that he died. He died unto sin
[1:12:55] once. But in that he liveth. He liveth
[1:13:00] unto God.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible show that we have to die from
[1:13:06] the world.
[1:13:08] and be born again
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; to be a part of a God family.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; You can't be a a God family members
[1:13:23] without the new birth.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; It's not impossible
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; because we can't join the family but we
[1:13:31] have to born in the family.
[1:13:35] We have to born in Christ to be a Christ
[1:13:39] like
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; to be like Christ.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; To have this desire to be like Christ
[1:13:47] every time everywhere
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; that we can show to this world
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; that we are Christian.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Our names is Jesus. Our family's name is
[1:14:04] Jesus.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; So we can like Buddh
[1:14:09] preached last time be Jesus for someone
[1:14:13] else.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; We can't be Jesus for someone else if we
[1:14:19] are not Jesus.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; If we don't live like Jesus.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; If we don't pray like Jesus.
[1:14:31] If we don't have the faith like Jesus
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; but David said it sometime we we are
[1:14:42] afraid to pray for sick
[1:14:45] because we sometimes say that I don't
[1:14:48] know if God can
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; he is the sick but if we became like
[1:14:53] Jesus you know Jesus in the front of
[1:14:56] Lazarus st he say oh Lord I know
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I
[1:15:02] that you always
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; answer to my prayer in he knew it.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; So if we are like Jesus,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; we can have the same faith.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He said that I can be Jesus for someone.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I can do like Jesus.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And Jesus sent me to do like him.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:28] Buham said in
[1:15:32] identify with Jes with Christ
[1:15:36] preach
[1:15:38] 20th December 59
[1:15:43] paragraph 66
[1:15:45] he say
[1:15:47] God made a man to desire to have an
[1:15:51] example.
[1:15:54] Sometime in our daily life
[1:15:57] we want to have an example. Some student
[1:16:00] want to be like one teacher because they
[1:16:03] love this teacher. They like how we
[1:16:05] teach, how we talk, how we perform
[1:16:08] something.
[1:16:10] Some people want to be like some
[1:16:14] Hollywood
[1:16:16] actress.
[1:16:17] But God put in our hearts the desire to
[1:16:22] be like someone
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; to do like someone.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And he said and God gave him an example.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; That example is Jesus Christ
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; to be identified with him.
[1:16:38] Now if you would be more like him
[1:16:43] then there wouldn't be so many big shot
[1:16:47] in the world
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; if everyone like the Bible say was
[1:16:54] the member of Jesus family
[1:16:59] and do everything like Jesus like the
[1:17:04] example
[1:17:07] He say then where wouldn't be so many
[1:17:10] big shot in the world
[1:17:12] that wouldn't be any angry children in
[1:17:15] the world
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; that wouldn't be any whiskey or drinking
[1:17:19] of gambling
[1:17:22] God gave us an example to be like
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; but we refuse to be it
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; we refuse to be a member of his family
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; now that's what the matter with the
[1:17:37] word. They got the desire.
[1:17:41] God has given them that, but they've
[1:17:45] turning
[1:17:46] the wrong way.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; It's time to return back.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It's time for each one of us to return
[1:17:56] back
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; and get on the right road.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And get facing Calvary.
[1:18:06] Nature proves it. Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; He said now if people of this day
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; with that great desire and great
[1:18:20] ambition to be like somebody for example
[1:18:24] if they took Christ as their example
[1:18:29] then we would have
[1:18:32] we could fire every police there was.
[1:18:38] That's right.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; There will be no more crime,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; no more things. So the police will never
[1:18:47] have a job.
[1:18:52] He say
[1:18:56] we could fire every police there was in
[1:18:59] the nation. Everybody will be make and
[1:19:04] amble.
[1:19:07] Everybody will be kind and have bodily
[1:19:11] love one for the other.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; There will never be a divorce case ever
[1:19:17] played in our country. There will never
[1:19:20] be any sickness
[1:19:22] and no s no more sickness because we
[1:19:26] have the power.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Even if the sickness come, we have the
[1:19:31] power to cast out the devil.
[1:19:38] We could even dismiss hospitals
[1:19:44] and everybody try to make Jesus Christ
[1:19:48] the example.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have need for nothing else.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So the nature in is in the man. But he
[1:19:59] put he put it on the wrong thing. He
[1:20:02] makes some men. And you know the Bible
[1:20:05] said we are cursed when we make flesh
[1:20:10] our stay
[1:20:14] as a member of God family. We can't make
[1:20:19] this flesh our stay.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; It's not possible.
[1:20:28] When you try to make flesh your stay or
[1:20:31] put your trust in flesh, the Bible said
[1:20:34] you are cursing.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; How well I know it's so easy to do it.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; The when I was little boy I read a book
[1:20:46] of thousand
[1:20:48] the
[1:20:50] mama had an old fur that Mr. the wedding
[1:20:55] I'd give her late before the dresser.
[1:21:00] I cut that thing up and make me a
[1:21:03] thousand street and slept in the tree
[1:21:07] for a week.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be thousand. I wanted I
[1:21:13] wanted to be thousand. Then when I read
[1:21:16] the book of the Lawn Star Ranger, I
[1:21:20] wrote the broomstick out
[1:21:23] being a hobby horse trying to be the
[1:21:26] Lawn Star Ranger.
[1:21:29] It's no more than what people will do.
[1:21:34] So sometime if you
[1:21:37] spend your time on social media
[1:21:42] looking some
[1:21:45] at some people who want to be to have
[1:21:49] some influence on social media.
[1:21:53] You can try to be like them.
[1:21:58] Say
[1:22:00] it no more than what people will do.
[1:22:03] It's what you read, the music you listen
[1:22:07] to.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Go into a restaurant and it's old rock
[1:22:12] and roll. No wonder the people are going
[1:22:15] crazy.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; That enough to drive a human being
[1:22:19] crazy.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; But oh,
[1:22:23] I'll be thankful
[1:22:26] all through eternity to one day
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I read about Jesus.
[1:22:33] that satisfy me.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; I want to be like him.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; That's my desire
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; to be able to turn the other cheek.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, go the second mile.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; To be able to forgive
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; when the odd is all against you
[1:22:55] or nothing against anybody. Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Tell them you rightfully or wrongfully
[1:23:05] for your right doing but still love
[1:23:08] them.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That the way I want to be.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; That the way we want to be
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; as a family member. I want to be that
[1:23:20] kind of a person. I want to be able that
[1:23:24] when I'm will I win not back.
[1:23:30] That the kind of an example that God
[1:23:33] gave us in Jesus Christ.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; We are to be identified with him.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; He say how do you become identified with
[1:23:46] him?
[1:23:47] You'd say brother now uh you have to
[1:23:52] dress like the Hollywood stars and do
[1:23:55] this other things. But how do you become
[1:24:00] identify with Jesus Christ? The first
[1:24:04] you repent. Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; First you repent of what you all already
[1:24:11] have done
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; and then you identify with him here in
[1:24:18] the pool.
[1:24:20] No doubt. But what many will be
[1:24:23] identified with him in a few minute in
[1:24:27] the pool you are identify with him in
[1:24:31] bicism.
[1:24:34] For if we are buried in Christ, we are
[1:24:37] identified to his death.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Burial in burial and resurrection.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's why we are baptized.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; We go down into the water come back up
[1:24:53] to witness that we believe in the death,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:00] Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; And if we be planning in his likeness,
[1:25:08] in his death, God gave us a promise.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; We'll be like him in the resurrection.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; That a promise,
[1:25:19] it can fail.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Identify yourself with some movie queen
[1:25:26] and see where you'll be. Identify
[1:25:30] yourself with some cowboy or some
[1:25:33] teenager and see where you'll be. But I
[1:25:37] challenge you
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; That's not brother Paul,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; but brother Bam.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight.
[1:25:47] Identify yourself with Jesus Christ
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; in his death,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; in his resurrection, and see
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; where you'll be at the resurrection.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; For if we suffer with him, we shall
[1:26:05] reign with him.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; God has given us the promise.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; May world desire is to be like him.
[1:26:17] Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; That's my desire tonight
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; to be like him.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; To do everything like him.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Take me, oh Lord,
[1:26:32] and mold me and make me.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Shape me over again.
[1:26:38] like the prophet that went down to the
[1:26:41] porter house,
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; break me out and it m me
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; that I pray tonight.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; We know that
[1:26:53] as I say every preacher
[1:26:57] when you preach in the Bible and the
[1:26:59] message is showing us the benefit we
[1:27:03] have.
[1:27:08] But the thing we can
[1:27:11] look at tonight
[1:27:13] are we member of this family?
[1:27:19] Are all these benefits belong to us?
[1:27:28] That where we are tonight. We are here
[1:27:31] tonight.
[1:27:34] And may God help us when we stand.
[1:27:39] We can stand. A musician can come.
[1:27:49] The main thing tonight
[1:27:52] is we know
[1:27:54] that we have the most powerful father.
[1:27:59] Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; We have the most powerful name
[1:28:06] and sometime
[1:28:09] trials, troubles,
[1:28:12] many things in our life
[1:28:19] can keep us
[1:28:21] so far from our privilege,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; from our benefit.
[1:28:29] Sometime you can feel that like
[1:28:34] you are not
[1:28:36] a member of this family because you make
[1:28:39] something wrong.
[1:28:43] But our father
[1:28:46] say that if you repent
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; from everything,
[1:28:51] he's able
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; not only to forgive you
[1:28:56] but to justify you.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil put in your mind
[1:29:06] that you are not a member of this big
[1:29:09] and greatest family.
[1:29:15] Keep in your mind if every time
[1:29:18] God put it in your heart the desire to
[1:29:20] be in the church,
[1:29:24] it mean you have a seed in your heart.
[1:29:28] You have a God seed
[1:29:31] in your life.
[1:29:36] just come.
[1:29:39] The warrior of the world
[1:29:42] and the son himself
[1:29:46] will bring the seeds to life.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; So your life can show
[1:29:54] exactly
[1:29:56] what food who you are.
[1:30:01] A two sons, a two daughters
[1:30:05] of God. Let's pray.
[1:30:11] Our heavenly father,
[1:30:16] we thank you tonight.
[1:30:20] I know that sometime
[1:30:25] I don't say exactly
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:29] something how I want to say
[1:30:33] but it doesn't matter.
[1:30:37] The main thing tonight oh Lord
[1:30:40] is that we can see
[1:30:44] how much you loved us,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; how much you did everything for us.
[1:30:52] And you want to remind us tonight
[1:30:57] that we are member of your family
[1:31:03] and every benefit of this family belong
[1:31:07] to us.
[1:31:09] Oh, we thank you for that.
[1:31:12] How wonderful it is.
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:18] May we just help each one us
[1:31:26] to look at his life,
[1:31:30] to make everything right,
[1:31:34] to look at you
[1:31:36] our example.
[1:31:40] We need you tonight, Lord.
[1:31:43] And we commit everything in your hand.
[1:31:46] All our life we commit in your hands
[1:31:51] while we pray and ask it in Jesus
[1:31:53] Christ's name.
[1:31:55] Amen.
[1:31:59] God bless you.
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:10] Amen. Wasn't that wonderful? Let's just
[1:32:12] sing this song for a moment
[1:32:18] to be like Jesus.
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:28] On earth I long
[1:32:32] to be like him.
[1:32:37] All through life's journey
[1:32:41] from birth to glory.
[1:32:46] I only have
[1:32:50] to be like
[1:32:54] Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:32:58] that was wonderful.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That was wonderful. Here we are
[1:33:04] sitting
[1:33:07] the sons and daughters of God in the
[1:33:10] family of God.
[1:33:13] And as Romans says, we're joint hes.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're joint hes.
[1:33:21] Everything that he was, all that the
[1:33:23] father was, he poured into Christ. And
[1:33:26] all that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:33:28] church.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, we're h sitting here
[1:33:31] with power to move mountains,
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; to pluck up trees,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; to withstand
[1:33:37] the enemy, and all Satan can do is
[1:33:42] accuse you.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; But there's nothing shall be laid to the
[1:33:47] charge of God's elect
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; because the seed of God remains in them.
[1:33:54] Now, can you So, we we have this
[1:33:57] abundance of power,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz he he give it to us.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; I like what he said in in Luke the the
[1:34:08] 10th chapter. He said, "Behold, I gave
[1:34:11] unto you power to tread on serpents and
[1:34:14] scorpions
[1:34:16] and over all the power of the enemy, and
[1:34:20] nothing shall by any means hurt you."
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; That's the power he gave us.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Just think that you have that power. I
[1:34:32] just I thought as Paul talked about
[1:34:33] benefits, I thought, "Wow, we got all
[1:34:37] these benefits, but they're unused
[1:34:39] benefits."
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; You know, the the the same I think it
[1:34:46] was Joseph when he got in in prison, the
[1:34:49] gift that got him in prison
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; was the same gift that got him out.
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:34:57] and and this the fact that sometimes you
[1:35:00] get in trouble, but the the the God in
[1:35:03] you, the Christ in you will get you out
[1:35:05] of that trouble.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Satan gets on you, you got to fight back
[1:35:11] at him.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; But and you got to fight back that not
[1:35:14] from a negative standpoint, but from by
[1:35:17] the claim of your inheritance. Wait a
[1:35:20] minute, Satan. You can't put this on me.
[1:35:22] I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[1:35:25] I'm not going to let this spirit
[1:35:26] overtake my life. I'm not going to beat
[1:35:29] myself down. Even the prodal son, how
[1:35:33] far away he got from God
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; to where he was absolutely
[1:35:39] just squandered everything,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; came to his senses
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and said, "In my father's house,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; the servants are living better than I
[1:35:51] am." And when he went back, he wasn't
[1:35:54] received as a servant.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; He was received as a son.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And the father put his coat on him and
[1:36:01] he said, "Rejoice because that which is
[1:36:04] lost."
[1:36:06] Oh, and we could take these great power.
[1:36:10] And when the the disciples and he told
[1:36:13] that to disciples, he said, "I've given
[1:36:16] you power. Nothing shall by any means
[1:36:19] hurt you." He said, ' Notwithstanding in
[1:36:22] this, rejoice not that the spirits are
[1:36:26] subject unto you, but rather rejoice
[1:36:29] because your names are written in
[1:36:32] heaven.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's given me the power. But I
[1:36:38] don't rejoice in that. I rejoice because
[1:36:41] I'm in his family.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; My name was written in the Lamb's book
[1:36:46] of life. This is my inheritance. The
[1:36:49] life of the Holy Spirit and the power of
[1:36:51] God is your inheritance as a believer.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; And what did he come back to restore?
[1:37:00] Not religions, but life
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; and life more abundantly.
[1:37:06] Oh my. Let us let us have courage
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; to step up
[1:37:13] and and know that he's empowered us. I
[1:37:18] love that story that he read to us.
[1:37:21] Doesn't it make your heart just leap?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; We can do this.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; We can be victorious.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; We can overcome.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; We can win our children. We can see. We
[1:37:37] can't have victory over sickness and
[1:37:39] death and and discouragement and
[1:37:42] depression.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; We have life and life more abundant. Oh,
[1:37:47] we just need to we just need to start
[1:37:49] being who that we are.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord tonight.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you. I'm not a very good
[1:37:57] singer. I like this song. Whatever
[1:37:59] you're playing,
[1:38:01] you know it.
