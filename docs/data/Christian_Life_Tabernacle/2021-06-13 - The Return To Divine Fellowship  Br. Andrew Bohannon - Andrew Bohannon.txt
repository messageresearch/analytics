lord lord we just love you and praise you in jesus christ's name amen amen a brother mark david is a special uh this morning i mixed up the names called brother mark daniel but mark david i have an old friend his name mark daniel that's i got confused and nobody told me church you know the enemy has been very tricky that's one thing we know about the devil there's one thing we know is like he will always you know catch you at your most vulnerable you know moment you know a couple of you know weeks back it's been a couple of weeks uh i'm that type of person i come home every day and i look at my life i take inventory of it and say okay you know if i'm about to go to sleep okay how did i do did i did i did i do as expected and you know oftentimes you know we humans are fall short in fact by the time i'm thinking five minutes into it i'm like oh god i'm done you know you know i just i think about i'll say oh and i'm that type of person i just beat myself a little bit to say you could have done better in fact that you could have just done better and you know at the point in time i found out it's not just me you know the devil will point that out to me so that i can see i see if i'm the one doing it you know you know most of the time i'll just completely failed uh and it would beat me down so much that it would be very heavy on me and i'll just be like oh god you just can you just help me you know i'll just think about maybe i say but at least there are some that are you say we should be perfect you know like you were perfect and why come i'm just you know this and this i can't one thing i don't do i don't like giving excuses i can't give excuse for this um and you know i was just thinking about it and you know it beat me down i just sometimes i just like i quit i just i just sit down in one corner i just quit and um things would just happen and it would just show me in fact the devil would make it so hard that sometimes i'll sit with my family and say i'm not a stopping seed am i you know they're like no we i'm you not they would tell me that okay i'll try to reinforce that in my brain like okay no i'm not and at a point in time you know i just sat down with them i was like okay i hope i'm not they were like oh no you're not and that's just the devil putting that in me uh but then you know i would look back at my life the lord would stop pointing things out to me and say you think you know you you're my own you know you're you belong to me so let me take you back now let me start taking you back and let me stop let you see what happens you know finding myself and the message yes i was born in it but staying with it staying in it believing that nothing else but just this just this way like if i can stick to it all my life that's what would get me true that's the only thing that i pray for every single day and so i'm asking please pray along with me i just want i just want to take myself completely out and see that it's just god doing everything in me and not myself i know i've derailed a little bit so i'm i'm supposed to sing a song yeah you know just like my mom will always she likes she loves this song it says something through the wall water or something through the flood some true the fire you know but all through the blood you know some true great sorrows but the end god gives a song and so uh when i talk thought about it you know uh the only song that came to my mind is where could i go um i'll go off keyboard part of me toss that leaving below in this whole sinful world hardly a comfort can afford [Music] striving alone to face temptation so where could i go but to the lord [Music] where could i go where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul needing a friend to help me in the end where could i go but to the lord and neighbors are kind i love them everyone we get a long and sweet accord but when my soul needs my life from above where could i go but to the lord where could i go [Music] where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul [Music] needing a friend to help me in the end where could i go but to the lord [Music] life here is grand with friends i love so dear come for what i get from god's own world yet when i face that chilling ends up dead where could i go but alone where could i go where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul [Music] and i'm needing a friend [Music] where could i go [Music] amen seek for a country [Music] before [Music] is [Music] anymore i am [Music] shall [Music] [Applause] street [Music] across the to wear my face [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] therefore [Music] and someday i'll say [Music] praise the lord are you looking for bueller land tonight man it's good to be in the house of the lord again praise the lord you come expecting come believing you get what you expect amen let us buy our hearts together precious heavenly father lord god we thank you god for life lord in life more abundantly lord what a promised keeper you are lord how we oh god we hear the testimonies ring out from the lips of those who are offering songs of praise of thanksgiving lord lord how it rejoices our heart to know that you're not a dead god lord that you're so mindful of our every little detail father we love you lord and the scripture tells us that we love you because you first loved us lord what a powerful love o god you drew us to yourself lord and we're looking to worship you tonight lord we pray that you would come oh god lord take this service lord as we dedicate it to you lord we pray that you'd feel welcome lord as it were lord let our tears of thanksgiving and repentance lord wash o god and let it be o god that you would feel pleased to come and break the bread of life to us lord will you touch each heart as they have need lord lord i i as a mortal man lord have nothing to offer lord lord but you ordained this lord before the foundation of the world that we would take the word of god lord and under inspiration lord we'd speak life god we pray that you'd get glory from this service lord we're desiring o god to hear testimonies of how that you used our pastor lord no doubt to take time away from the work here lord it was needful lord we pray oh god strengthen that body by our pastor lord may the wisdom and the experience o god may it rise up oh god in the believers to take their position lord we're praying your blessings also upon those others that couldn't make you here tonight lord be their portion lord and we just want to commit this service holy to you we love you lord we commit this service now again in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord appreciate the musicians i amen thinking about uh the request and something um brother jackson said one time and uh just stuck with me said you're either in the making of a testimony and i can't remember exactly i said it but you know even to request for the the co-worker i believe her name was amy you know it's it's the the life that we live before people that they inquire of you because there's a hope that there's something crying out in their heart that you have that you possess something amen you possess christ amen what a testimony what a witness praise the lord i don't plan on being very long we'll just trust the lord will lead us here if you have your bibles and you want to open it to the book of james just thinking about a little thought how the lord's been dealing with me we had a nice trip a week or two ago and you know there's there's a lot of things that you know i just speak personally there's a lot of things in life that i was unaware of or i'll say it like this i was ignorant of and um you know i i got um to take the family to going down to a few spots and and along the way we were going to go see in indiana the tabernacle and before we left my mom had mentioned something to me and i was i was kind of a little bit um curious why she waited you know 40 something years to tell me a little glimpse of our family heritage and and uh you know she had mentioned and said you know i couldn't put a good spin on it so i just kept it from you and you know i kind of i kind of could respect that but you know there's things in our life that you know sin had sold us into slavery into bondage and and we were ignorant but then the gospel light came amen and the truth is what sets us free amen so i want the i want the whole truth i want all that god has for me amen amen just kind of breaking into a little relaxation here in james chapter 2 it's right after hebrews the scripture says there and let's start in verse 14 it says what doeth the prophet my brethren though a man say that he hath faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food and one of you said to him depart in peace and be warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give him not those things which are needful to the body what do it that profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without the works and i'll show you my faith by my works thou believers that there is one god thou believeth well the devil also believeth and tremble but will thou know o thou man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see us thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god amen praise the lord you may have your seeds you know it's just us being the faith seed we heard it this morning so wonderful the supersede of god the faith seed rising up and you think about how that you know and then there's another scripture before kind of launch out here in uh revelations chapter 12. in verse 11 it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death amen you know it's one of those things that when you look into the scripture you know the scripture sometimes you feel condemned you feel convicted like i'm not there yet but praise the lord the word is preached to call us up higher amen there's something longing in the believer's heart for something more you know god has already revealed to us that he's real but now we want to come to a place where the faith that we have now can be operated amen there's there's something rising up in the church of god today and that's god's wondering working power amen it's the love of god to be shed abroad in our hearts amen i got to thinking you know this was a powerful testimony that he was called a friend of god amen and i got to thinking about that and and i thought you know what i wonder what that that title or that position as a friend of god would represent amen something we would aspire to be right so sometimes if you look back and you can see you know how this thing got crossed and how and how it was lost you know and so i look back into the scriptures in genesis you know it's it and this is what the inspiration from a message brother brandon preached called the fundamental foundation for faith amen because we can't do anything that pleases god except to be by faith amen so god has to have a personal encounter with you amen you got to cry out god i need you right amen so now this this the the fundamental foundation for faith he said this he said no matter what state a man is in he is yet a son of god no matter how sinful he is how far away he is he is a fallen son but yet he is a son god is his creator god is his maker amen god created the devil at his angels amen so god has brought he has bought him with a price amen didn't he buy us with a price you know this is the thing this is we want to be those living epistles right of all men we don't want to have our you know noses up in the air if it rains then we all drown you know we want to have that humble life and love of christ that as we walk with that blessed lord fill my way every day with love amen we don't want it just to be a song that we sing in church we want it to be something pulsating from our very fiber of our being something that's beyond this human reasoning and senses something that god pours into us that we can't help but contain is bursting out like a fire that's wanting to spread amen there's something in us that is crying out you know because the scripture says as you've been freely given freely give it's like an emptiness if you have all this that's been given you freely and you're just sitting there carrying it boy it becomes kind of heavy after a while you gotta start giving some away amen god he said no faith is a gift of god lest any man boast i mean what a blessed people we've got an abundance of faith amen some people may be rich in this world's goods but the scripture says friendship with the world is enmity with god amen and one day we were alienated from god in our minds by wicked works but god who's rich in mercy amen thank god for his wealth of mercy hallelujah you love the lord tonight amen god has bought him with a price he may never reconcile himself to that see god placed man on free moral agency and and you know we we've received we've received that reconciliation amen we've accepted it now some may be in here saying well i'm on the fence well i just want to say tonight that you know the fence is on the devil's ground so we need to get serious tonight and say you know what whatever god you have for me let me forget about anything that the devil's dangled in front of me amen there's nothing greater than life you know god is re restoring divine fellowship in satan's eden you know there was going to be an accomplishment that god was going to have in the face of his enemy amen he's got a table spread and he says now this is this is a you've come here to be tested amen this is a little bit away from my notes so you know the very things that we go through in life is is not necessarily to prove uh to the neighbor but it's to prove to satan you've got the goods it's christ in you and that encourages the believer's faith you know what now god is restoring the friendship it's divine fellowship amen god's speaking you know you praying in your heart god i need this job i need a good report from the doctor i've been praying about this and god speaks back by confirming his word isn't that wonderful that's the kind of fellowship they're being restored to he said ask anything in my name and i'll do it amen what a privileged people we are so he may never accept it it may never do him any good but yet he's a son and he's a or she's a daughter of god and what did god put man here for that's a good question what did god put man here for now when he made god when god made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on the earth he gave him jurisdiction over everything on earth and and he was to control everything he was to control the animal life the the the fowler the foul life the sea life he was to control the wind the plant life he was to control everything amen isn't he knocking you know we heard it this morning that super church amen all that christ was he poured into the church amen and now we can come under that expectation that god's going to declare a people that he's redeemed and that he's not ashamed to be identified with them that's my people they have my life amen man was made a secondary god on earth he was given power to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers but when these powers were given but then the power that he was given to make himself there he fell you know what there's something to be said about when somebody's been given a gift and i remember i had aspired to be an athlete and there was a gift or a talent you would say and well i had these dreams in the world and you know what that's what happened you see when he was given something to make himself it's it's almost like it reminds me of the scripture in genesis i was going through a little personal study and if you suffer me i'll just kind of share some things that are personal and it was it was you know in the fall see because we want to see where what we fall from and so to know what we're being restored to amen amen and so now in the scripture in in genesis chapter 3 and verse 15. we'll just back up one verse there it says and the lord god had said to the serpent because thou has done this cursed thou art cursed above all the cattle and above all the beasts and upon thy belly thou shall go and dust thou shall eat all the diaries of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel and brother branham said to bruise the heel was to make an atonement so now you see that there was actually going to be a fulfillment amen and we heard about the sign the virgin shall conceive he says unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrows in thy conception and sorrow thou bring forth children and and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and i got to thinking about that and you know it's the desire to be something sometimes you know it's it was through the the desire of knowledge and and our pastor was kind of saying that how you know even like stories of uh people and politics and how these these things that they've done now it's like the devil's kind to is seduce us and say come i'll tell you this hidden knowledge about their life and then it's like an intoxication you start going down that road and then your mind starting to go into this carnal realm about mankind and how unclean and how filthy they are and then it gets start tampering your own atmosphere and you're just saying man mankind is terrible and you know what that might be the case but the blood of jesus can cleanse the violence of sinner amen and so we don't want to pollute our thinking with those things we don't want to have friendship with the world we don't even want to lend our ear to any of the devil's nonsense amen help me lord to be in divine fellowship he says and unto adam because thou has hearkened to the voice of thy wife that i have commanded thee not thou shall not eat of it curse it is the ground see he didn't curse enemies it cursed is the ground in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life thorn also and thistles shall bring forth to thee and thou shall eat of the herb of the field amen and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return and to the ground from out of winds thou has taken for dust out heart and dust thou shall return amen they got to thinking about how that you know the sin curse caused the sorrow you know and and one of the aspects of the curse for the woman is that she wouldn't want to come under headship now when i'm speaking i'm speaking of the church amen so you know you see what the curse has done is now the woman wants to lead the woman you know that's just part of the curse amen and for the man now is thinking about how that you know the the ground was cursed and he said in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life and you know it's it's just um you know it's it's kind of like in romans um chapter 1 and verse 21. just flip over to it real quick romans chapter 1 and verse 21 excuse me he says because thou because that they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were they thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools you know isn't that something that you know that's that's kind of the thing that brother branham was saying in this quote he said now adam when when he had power that he had given to make himself something isn't that man's nature to try to make himself something that he's not amen we're called to be sons of god and god has a provided way that's the new birth amen we must repent that repentance is the grace of god to you if you know in your heart you're not doing right and god's convicted you that's the grace of god to you amen he said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and you shall receive the holy ghost which is the new birth amen do i have a witness tonight that god keeps his word amen god's still filling with the baptism of the holy ghost because people are still being obedient to the word a little bit further in romans there it says and they change the glory of the incorruptible god into the image made like unto corruptible men into birds into four beasts and creeping things wherefore als god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their hearts to dishonor their own bodies in between themselves and they changed the truth of god into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever amen you know you think about the world that we live in you know you go to genesis and that was the seed chapter and you can look at the world and the churches and things how they are worshiping i mean you got i'm driving down to pick up something for the job and i see this you know booth and they're all set up and it's the association that you know is the voice for dogs we're the voice for dogs or animals you know and i just you know what the scripture in genesis and then we see it in romans i mean they're they're making their self something they're the voice for animals you know hey the scripture being fulfilled who this is the truth they turn the truth into a lion they worship and serve they are serving the creature come on i'm just i stand back in fellowship i'm in divine fellowship with god i don't have to get caught up in in taking up causes of animals and different things yeah don't destroy the earth yeah let's have respect for the creation of god but what about the word of god let's worship the creator let's serve the creator he's worthy to be served he's worthy of honor for this cause god gave them up to vile affections i mean i've seen him hugging up against the okay and even their women did change their natural use that which is against nature in verse 20 says even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things that are not convenient amen and we're seeing that you know there's there's you know in the world people are just they're doing everything they can to keep you from testifying of your god they're they're trying to keep you from telling somebody else what god did for you god healed you there was a sin sickness that was for sure of death amen and he they're just trying to keep us silent keep us in that in between stage like he was saying this morning a little bit of this a little bit of god a little bit of the world but praise god we're we're feeling that there's a divine fellowship being restored and the very life and power and fire of god is starting to move and rise up in us amen we can feel it surging in us now you know that kind of relationship makes one not ashamed amen that kind of restoration was like when they were standing there naked in the garden and they weren't ashamed amen my but then the power was given to himself and he fell and adam adam could speak the wind and it would stop and then he could speak to the trees and they would obey he could speak to the wildlife and they'd obey he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obeyed adam now that is the beginning of man that's what god gave him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that and all the his great channels became clogged up he couldn't get through now what adam was in god christ is has redeemed us back to that amen isn't that the good news amen we were sold into slavery of sin and there was one who loved us with an elective love that was able to spread his hands out and pay the price of redemption amen what a public testimony what a public witness he showed his love for us amen the scripture says no greater love that a man hath for his friends that he would lay down his life amen and that same god is in you amen and you have friends and what christ was to you well what about your friends amen that's the super church that's the manifestation of this hour the same god that was living in jesus christ lived in a sheep wave that expressed and this wasn't done in secret his ministry went around the world seven times amen we have the pillar of cloud over there witnessing who was that he said that was our lord up there amen amen he's come he has an open book and now we have the privilege of dining at the master's table what a privileged people we are amen and to think that we had become unconscious of the fact of what we lost i'm wondering if we still have some of that amnesia trying to invade us no praise god i'm going to stay with christ now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original again and adam never had to be sick he never had to die he'd never had to worry he never had a headache he never had a fever he just climbed up into father's arms and just like a child everything is his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was a child of god and the child was heir of all things amen what what a restoration amen think of it now when man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall christ has come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what christ redeemed us for i think if we just went down the pews and everybody personalize this question what did christ redeem us for we've fellowshipped a little bit about what was lost amen and what christ did when he paid the price now he wanted to restore the divine friendship and fellowship of god there's a relationship that you had and now he's wanting to bring it to manifestation again the super race the super church they have thus saith the lord and you can move with confidence when you got thus saith the lord you can go to the pope you can go the president you can go to anybody you're not ashamed that was to give us eternal life amen i mean my my and the scripture says about faith you know we're saved by grace through faith you know i heard brother brown say in one place that the blood doesn't save you but it was making atonement it keeps you clean but by faith are you saved amen you can go along and you can tell somebody all day long that jesus christ died jesus christ died on the cross to save them and they can sympathize with it but until they actually possess the resurrection and possess the death that they could just look at it and they can say i believe but now if you really believe something you can't hold back you start confessing it you start telling some folks you start testifying god saved me what are you talking about yeah the scripture says that he died on the on the tree he was cursed for me uh he did that for you oh my now that that kind of faith puts a man in action there's something that can't hold back the love that he's received he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the eternal fellowship in relationship to god to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that adam and lost amen isn't that what the ministry of malachi 4 came to turn our hearts back to bring restoration praise the lord for fulfillment we certainly appreciate being able to go the tabernacle and kind of walk some of the places that brother branham went to and i tell you there's just uh something that happens you know when you go through those things uh it just becomes more of a a reality in some ways you you you realize how much you're a part of god amen amen you know there's an eternal part of you that just resonates now when you hear in the tapes there's there's something else you realize i was there you know because like that's what he said about you and christ he said you know you had to pay for your sins but you were in christ when he was on the cross that's where you paid for your sin and god's not judging you he judged your sacrifice that's the perfection that he desires us to to walk in we're not looking at our carnal way and our flesh but we're saying oh god take this from me i'm identified with the bleeding bloody word of this hour it has redeemed me it's brought me into divine fellowship now i can hear from god myself i know the prophet heard from god i've heard thus saith the lord and my heart anchors in truth and now take you at your word i believe that by your stripes i'm healed amen isn't it wonderful when he comes by and he pulls on your heart and he gives that that 25 cents and you say by his stripes i'm healed and you know that you know praise the lord to be a son or daughter again to restore back all that adam had lost now the thing is since he has restored man back to this place man has fallen man in the fallen has lost his conscience of what father put him here on earth to do my you know it's like yeah we're you know we're marching you know we got the orders wait a minute did we leave did we leave without our orders or marching orders no says now man when he fell he lost his conscience of what father put him here on earth to do in other words all the plumbing all it was in our brain the outlet the faith was all clogged up with business affairs with home life with domestic things hello hello i just was testifying to my wife this week i'm like all of this stuff you know and brother branham says it just right here that's clogging the channel of faith amen and it becomes so clogged until god can't operate through those channels that he had made man for amen but i just i say it like this in my life i i really treasure like never before a friendship you know and i realize young people you know if you're praying about a relationship with a daughter of god whether she's received where she's been reconciled you know you shouldn't even i don't even think it's worthy of consideration until someone's filled with the spirit you know i just think that those things are something that need to be thought of through prayerfully in consideration of of different things family and you know whether they'll serve the lord with you with you know the ministry god's called you to and so i just think you know how i got here adam praise the lord you know there there is something very special about a friendship you know and as you go through you realize you know the friends are the ones that you're that that really know you you know you you can confide into a friend and you can take them to the side you have a confidence that if you're hurting you know they're not just going to broadcast it on social media and run you down to the ground you know you just have a confidence that you know i'm going to share my heart with you and you'll pray through with the victory for me and with me amen and to think about how that god you know he he laid his life down you know i thought i thought my god you did that for me and now you're saying you're restoring me to this kind of fellowship this kind of relationship this kind of friendship i want to look a little bit more into what a friend is amen and so i got to thinking about that and it brought me to a few scriptures and you know this great thing that we're called to being the face seat of abraham you know in him having the testimony that he was a friend of god amen so his faith wasn't just the lip service faith i mean it you talk about his testimony i mean you know there's that word test in the beginning of a testimony so you know that's the greatest thing for the believer is the test you know we want to stand the test amen it may seem like your whole world is falling and the world is falling apart i mean we see the signs i mean they're going and they're headed headlong to an economical council and we see all of what's happening they're all coming under that headship amen but there's another people that are coming under another headship amen that he's having the preeminence amen you know there in genesis 18 you know you look at at the life and testimony of abraham and he says in verse 16 he said and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham the thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for if i for i know him well that's that's a relationship right there amen god knew you amen you were in your father amen and the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i knew him and i will reckon i will come that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord and do justice and judgment and the lord may bring upon abraham that's which he hath spoken amen isn't that wonderful that god has such a confidence in you that he would entrust to you his spirit and there there would be such a relationship of fellowship that you just said oh i wouldn't want to do anything that displeased the lord and that you would be like david and have a harder repentance that if you did slip you would quickly come and say god forgive me i didn't mean to do that amen praise the lord what a testimony and you know i got to thinking too as you know just share a little bit of what something that happened you know because sometimes people are looking for faith and and manifestation when when it's already happened you know it's like they said shouldn't have lies at first come and restored all things and they said well he he has come and he will come you know and yet you know we want to look to the scriptures to know that you know there's been a fulfillment and if we turn to revelations chapter 12. i just thought this might encourage you along the way seeing how god you know because we can look back and see what god has done and now in looking back we won't say well we're waiting for that to be fulfilled because it's already happened amen some people get confused and you know it's teaching that actually positionally places us amen the scripture says in verse 1 he says and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman amen and we know what the a woman represents in the in the spiritual it represents a church amen and there appeared to wander in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet now brother branham began to teach about how that you know the sun was the perfect and and the moon doesn't have any light source of itself it was actually reflecting the light in the absence of the sun amen while there was darkness the moon carried the light amen that's what the church has done in his absence is they reflect it's not our own life it's the very life of christ amen so when you see that this woman was clothed with the sun and the moon was under her feet brother branham was speaking about how the the law had become fading out and this dispensation was passing amen and this this time now if we continue on it says and upon the head a crown of 12 stars amen what what a picture you know the prophet preached a message called revelation a book of symbols thank god that we're in fellowship that we can receive revelation that we can look into the word of god and see oh the prophet said that the twelve stars was the twelve apostles amen that was the very foundation it was upon the 12 apostles and the chief cornerstone amen so we can see oh god when we look back we can see now that was the church the jewish orthodox church amen we can look back and see that that's exactly what god was doing at that time and now in verse two it says and she began she being with child cried and travailed in birth and pain to be delivered amen and brother branham was talking about this in other words it was the roman empire now hunkering her down amen you know sometimes history repeats itself ever so often amen you see that there's coming a persecution for your faith the faith of this hour people will look at you and the things that brother branham taught they will say you don't have no right to say that well actually i do it's thus saith the lord and heavens and earth will pass away but not one word will pass away amen we're being restored to a friendship and a fellowship with god this is supreme authority this is the super church amen with the super faith the supersede of abraham are you thinking about this in in verse 3 it says and he appeared another wonder in heaven and behold the great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and we know that the red dragon was wrong amen that was the govern who put jesus christ to death he was hung on a roman cross amen so as we look in the scripture we can see plainly now that this is being fulfilled in that dispensation and the tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to earth and the dragon stood there before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her as soon as she was born and that word tell was not necessarily like a forked tail like brother branham was saying it was that lie that he told they said well we have caesar as our king and that man saying he's the king well that lie actually prepared them to reject the messiah my my when we look back we can see the tail of the serpent he's already weaving it before fulfillment he was already weaving it oh my and the third part of the stars of heaven it says in the very jews this is out of a message uh questions and answers law having a shadow preached in 1954 on oh 5 16 he says this now the very jews by the roman empire crucified the lord jesus and over two-thirds of the jews denied jesus christ the stars which were in heaven which did he did and if you and he said and he cast them to earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered to devour her children as soon as she was to be as soon as it was to be born now you say the dragon had something to do with the jews certainly this jesus says he is the king we have no king but caesar is that right you see how the devil preparing them jewish hearts back there to deny christ jesus christ when he come can you see the devil denying hearts today to deny the power of the holy ghost when he come amen can't you see that the pattern is being repeated there's no need for divine healing we have doctors you see the the power of the holy ghost in the believer who's in divine fellowship with god takes god at his word and he goes lays his hands on the sick amen he believes that by the preaching of the word there's the casting out of devils it's setting the captive free amen it's providing all that we have need of now just exactly the same yet honest and sincere but if you're deeply sincere and seek after god like some of them jews did you'll walk right out and receive him anyhow amen that's right they don't care what the church said but it cast two-thirds of them to the ground and the dragons stood before the woman to devour the child before it was born now what government what power what stood before the woman the jewish orthodox church to devour jesus christ when he was born so that was the red dragon that was rome amen amen praise the lord don't you see that the pattern you know it's it's that same red dragon now if you go i'm kind of jumping around here praise the lord let's continue on a little bit here he says and she brought forth a man-child who was to have who was to rule over the nations with a rod of iron and her children was caught up unto god into his throne you know and brother branham said this he says now they failed to see his first coming to the gentiles amen they saw they said wait a minute he was to rule with the rod of iron amen now we we realize that there's three comings of the lord amen let's just read that out of here so this is out of a message called the deity of jesus christ it says jesus comes three times he come the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church and then he comes the third time with his church everything in threes but all one in christ and remember the first time to redeem his church in the second time to receive his church and the third time with his church king and queen amen so you think about you know that the the like the he was saying now what did he redeem us for amen we asked a question earlier as to give you life amen so he redeemed you to give you life that was the very life that was in the beginning you see christ when he came and never lived the day for himself amen he lived it for others there's times where we feel a little bit heavy on our stupid on our shoulders i'm wondering if we're in divine fellowship with god amen it doesn't take much it just says lord i need divine fellowship there's been an atonement made that has broken the middle wall petition the veil was cut it was rent now i see jesus face to face amen the word has been revealed praise the lord you know i just i just feel to encourage each one of us you know a testimony you know is what god has done for us you know it's like i was saying with you know it takes faith in order to be saved god has to give you the revelation that he died and you're in fellowship with him now because of what he's done for you amen and so now it's i wanted to encourage what god has done to you by speaking to your heart now we're just become witnesses of his power to save to redeem to restore amen i was just testifying or or witnessing and hearing testimonies you know it's when when you're testifying your life's testifying that people begin to inquire i know that you're you're uh the fellowship that you have the church that you go to they believe in a god that has power that's not dead amen that's what's the drawing card is the fulfillment of christ in you that's the hope of glory amen when the the devil tries to dangle some kind of worldly carrot let's just shun that thing i don't need that my the value of having divine fellowship with god is so much greater than anything that the friendship of the world can offer and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of god that she should be fed her a thousand and two hundred three score amen and just thinking about how that that roman church you know brother branham said this he said now when he returns he shall rule all nations he will come and isn't a he isn't upon his throne now he is setting on god's throne he overcame he that overcomes shall sit with me in my throne as i have overcome and set on my father's throne america was established at plymouth rock for one purpose freedom of religion is that right and the bible said that she fled from the dragon and had a place prepared in what a wilderness what was america when she come here see where she was nourished for a limited time a time and a dividing of time just about 165 or 70 years where she had a place prepared and then the nation raised up and formed images of beast and spoke like the beast did at the confederation of organized church religion now the church is getting she can't have her freedom no more that's where the church is getting where she can't have freedom no more we had over a year of that right i mean i mean we just want to see where the you know what the enemy is trying to do again he's trying and he's he's done dupe the world but thank god the elect can't be deceived amen we got the ego anointing amen blessed are your eyes that see praise the lord praise the lord why don't we stand just feeling just kind of winded up here you know it's it's a it's a it's a thing to be in fellowship with god you know [Music] i feel it's a late hour and the enemy is trying to make us luke warm and cold and to make our our our lives feel insignificant when it comes to the economy of god amen but your life matters amen it's the life of christ in you that makes your life valuable amen he paid the price he so loved you even if it was just you you still would have died i mean we have such a personal god and his friendship and fellowship he's calling out he's knocking is there something in the way of that friendship and fellowship tonight i just say as we bow our hearts and our heads together if if there's something in your heart that you feel is holding you back from divine fellowship you want to just lay it on the altar of god tonight and ask him oh god send the cleansing blood lord there's there's nothing more valuable than that divine fellowship that i can speak to you my heart's desire the needs that i have and you can speak back by confirming your word by manifesting by the power of the holy ghost amen i believe it pleases god that if there's something in our way that we repent it's the grace of god to us amen let's pray heavenly father lord god surely we are a blessed people lord lord to have zoe life the very life of god dwelling inside of us lord and when we look back we seem lord we were so unworthy of it lord but yet lord it was your the nation lord we know that lord it's only the predestinated that can be born again father so we just fall upon the promise lord and say oh god let your grace oh god manifest lord the promise of this hour lord we see how abraham oh god he went into that land oh god and lord he interceded on behalf of those that were going to burn oh god lord let the same cry in our heart lord lord let us cry out for those that are lost and undone lord truly if if the same spirit is in us lord we will say oh god forgive them they know not what they do lord we pray oh god your mercies upon this congregation lord those that are

[Music] amen let's sing that together [Music] uh [Music] [Music] me [Music] jesus [Music] amen praise the lord we asked for the billy to come and give a little uh whatever the lord placed on his heart just to kind of tie of loose ends and we just trust that the lord will be your portion as you feel the presence of the lord and and the darkness pressing we're walking in a time where god is now manifesting light in your mortal bodies god veiling in your flesh amen god bless you amen aren't you glad for the word of god amen amen as a brother was speaking i was just thinking you know it's it comes to a point where it's faith or nothing amen there's the the mixing won't work anymore it's that faith that we just gotta walk in and and just take the word of god for what he said and walk in it and that will produce the image it'll produce the very thing that we're looking for now remember what got us here first is faith it wasn't by any works we're done it's because we believe that's why we're standing here that's what we got here we are here gathering here tonight and i believe that same faith is going to continue its work so he could bring us in the image of his very son satan
