[31:31] get here so i'll just pray that the lord
[31:34] helps us and we'll say a few words and
[31:37] hopefully will be
[31:38] a blessing to you i told brother david i
[31:41] was trying to get a title for what i'm
[31:42] going to say and then i keep changing
[31:44] and changing and changing i finally said
[31:46] it's not going to have a title
[31:48] amen i was going to call it something
[31:50] but i just decided not to amen
[31:54] let's open our bibles first in i'm
[31:56] looking at first thessalonians
[31:59] 4
[32:02] 1st thessalonians chapter 4 let's start
[32:04] from
[32:06] verse 13
[32:08] it says
[32:11] but i will not you have i will not have
[32:13] you to be ignorant brother and
[32:15] concerning them which are asleep
[32:19] that ye saw or not
[32:21] even as others
[32:22] which have no hope
[32:25] for if we believe that jesus died and
[32:27] rose again
[32:29] even so them also which are sleep in
[32:32] jesus
[32:33] will be bring
[32:34] will god bring them
[32:36] will god
[32:37] bring
[32:38] with him
[32:40] it says
[32:43] for this i say unto you
[32:45] by the word of the lord
[32:48] that which we we which are alive and
[32:51] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[32:53] not shall not prevent them which are
[32:56] sleep
[32:57] for the lord himself shall descend from
[32:59] heaven with a shout with the voice of an
[33:02] archangel with the trump of god and the
[33:05] dead and christ shall rise first
[33:08] it says then we which are alive and
[33:11] remain
[33:12] shall be caught up together with them
[33:14] in the cloud to meet the lord in the air
[33:18] and shall be and shall we ever be with
[33:21] them with the lord it says wherefore
[33:24] comfort one another with these words man
[33:27] i just want you to realize this is the
[33:29] lord's doing
[33:32] this is what man is doing on one side
[33:35] and this side but this is what the lord
[33:37] is doing
[33:38] and nothing can stop it it's the law
[33:41] doing itself
[33:42] and let's also turn in first corinthian
[33:50] let's turn in first corinthian
[33:54] i believe it's uh
[33:58] first corinthians 13
[34:00] and uh
[34:03] let's read from verse 1
[34:06] says though i speak with thong with
[34:08] tongues with tongues of men and angels
[34:11] and have not charity
[34:14] i am become as a sounding brass
[34:17] or a tinkling symbol and now i have the
[34:21] gift of prophecy
[34:22] and understand all the mysteries and
[34:25] knowledge of
[34:27] and and all knowledge and though i have
[34:29] all faith
[34:31] so that i could move mountains and i
[34:34] have not charity
[34:36] i have i am nothing
[34:38] and do now i want you to realize the
[34:40] things that he's talking about you could
[34:42] do
[34:44] and then he says and though i bestow all
[34:47] goods to feed the poor and though
[34:50] i give my body to be burned and and and
[34:54] have no charity
[34:55] it profiteth me nothing charity suffered
[34:58] long and it's kind and and and is kind
[35:02] charity envied not charity vaunted not
[35:06] itself
[35:07] it's not puffed up
[35:09] do it not uh
[35:11] behalf itself unseen unseemingly
[35:14] seeketh not her own
[35:17] is not easily provoked and think of no
[35:20] evil it says rejoice not in iniquity but
[35:24] rejoice in truth
[35:26] bearing all
[35:27] things
[35:29] believing all things
[35:31] hoping all things enduring all things
[35:33] charity never fail
[35:35] church charity never faileth but
[35:38] whatever there be a prophecy they shall
[35:41] fail whether there be a tongue they
[35:44] shall they shall cease whether there be
[35:47] knowledge it shall be
[35:50] vanished away
[35:51] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[35:54] part but when that which is perfect is
[35:57] come then that which is in part shall be
[36:00] done away with
[36:03] it says when i was a child i speak as a
[36:06] child
[36:07] and i understand as a child
[36:09] i thought as a child but when i became a
[36:12] man i put away childish things
[36:16] four
[36:17] now we see through a glass darkly
[36:20] but then face to face
[36:22] now i know in part but then shall we
[36:26] shall i know even as i am known
[36:29] and now abideth faith hope charity
[36:33] these three but the greatest of of these
[36:36] is charity that's just about head father
[36:38] we ask you bless your word to us in the
[36:40] name of the lord jesus we pray amen and
[36:43] you may have your seats
[36:46] perhaps just
[36:49] you know
[36:50] inspired by some of the things that we
[36:52] said this morning i hope to say
[36:54] something
[36:56] that it will be of a blessing
[37:00] we we have to understand this this this
[37:03] message this glorious message we have
[37:05] received
[37:06] is the lord jesus christ himself coming
[37:08] on the scene
[37:10] he this is not
[37:12] when you read even barbara uses
[37:15] uh he speaks many places on this and and
[37:19] we can when we look at the the messages
[37:21] of body when we read as we read in first
[37:25] thessalonians it says that the lord
[37:26] himself shall descend
[37:28] and in fact many have wondered why did
[37:32] he not use that scripture even as a
[37:34] foundation for the message of the
[37:36] rapture but you find out in many places
[37:39] the the prophet is very careful to to
[37:41] let us know that that that the son of
[37:44] man revealing is jesus christ revealing
[37:46] himself this has nothing to do with what
[37:49] man is thinking of what man is trying to
[37:51] achieve this is god trying to bring his
[37:54] church together this is the culmination
[37:57] of what's been happening since the
[37:58] beginning and therefore i i was thinking
[38:01] about even what brother david said this
[38:03] morning
[38:04] i i it's very important we we
[38:09] in order to keep you focused to
[38:11] understand what the expectation of the
[38:13] manifestation at the end time is
[38:14] supposed to be
[38:16] when we say there's going to be a
[38:18] manifestation or the sons of god will be
[38:21] manifested in the end time the question
[38:23] you should be asking is what are they
[38:25] going to be doing
[38:27] what kind of manifestation that are
[38:29] going to be because if i know then i
[38:31] know where i'm going then i know what
[38:33] i'm expecting if i understand what the
[38:36] manifestation is then i know what i'm
[38:38] expecting then i can look at my life and
[38:40] say am i manifesting what the scripture
[38:43] says the son of god sons of god will do
[38:46] am i going in the direction that is
[38:49] calling forth for the manifestations of
[38:51] the son because i want to say this
[38:54] as you read throughout the church age
[38:56] when you read throughout the church age
[38:58] from the beginning to the ending a
[39:00] prophet shows us one thing that we need
[39:02] to be very mindful of as you read it
[39:06] says that the ages were not built in
[39:08] such a way that the first age come and
[39:10] then it goes away and then the second
[39:12] one comes it says no it's a building up
[39:15] into something
[39:17] it's the leaning into in fact it says
[39:19] that all
[39:21] at the end it's going to be the building
[39:23] off of all the evil
[39:25] from the beginning everything that the
[39:27] devil has been working on he's building
[39:30] it up and he's building it up and he's
[39:31] building up and he's building up to what
[39:33] we see today but we also understand what
[39:37] god has been working for if when he
[39:39] started his church in the on the day of
[39:42] pentecost so how that he came and his
[39:44] spirit move upon the people god has been
[39:47] building his church from justification
[39:49] unto sanctification not to go backwards
[39:52] but building them into something so
[39:54] therefore the manifestation of the end
[39:57] time is supposed to be the gathering of
[40:00] all those things and building it into
[40:02] something that god wants to see
[40:05] and i say this this is why it's so
[40:07] important because the devil can come and
[40:10] shine the light on something that's
[40:12] already passed
[40:14] he can come and shine a light on
[40:16] something that's already past and show
[40:18] you this is the truth and this is the
[40:19] truth you have to be mature enough to
[40:22] say
[40:22] this is this was the church in the past
[40:25] this was part of my building up this is
[40:28] something that i had to go through this
[40:30] is what god building his church and the
[40:33] manifestation of today is not this
[40:36] not that god cannot use it in this time
[40:38] for him to build up his people for him
[40:40] to do whatever he needs but the
[40:42] manifestation of this hour has to be
[40:45] known
[40:46] uh you know
[40:47] but the david mentioned something i'll
[40:49] just say it right away uh you know when
[40:52] you look at how god has been building
[40:54] his church from the beginning you go
[40:56] through justification they came and and
[40:58] god came and and it was the church being
[41:01] built up so they came in they knew that
[41:04] they were a sinner and then they came
[41:05] and they received the gospel of
[41:07] justification how that christ died for
[41:10] them they rejoiced and they moved up
[41:13] sanctification was added to them and how
[41:16] that they knew that if you were
[41:17] justified you had the right to walk
[41:20] sinless because that same word or the
[41:23] same god who will justify you has the
[41:25] ability to sanctify you to set you aside
[41:28] and all of that they walk and they took
[41:30] one more step on the day of pentecost
[41:33] that came and received the baptism of
[41:34] the holy ghost god came and he
[41:36] manifested himself in his people they
[41:39] came and they received that they moved a
[41:41] step up what was it it was god building
[41:43] his church up constantly bringing it
[41:46] into something that he wanted to see in
[41:49] the end time but when he came to the
[41:51] manifestation of the end time god didn't
[41:54] have you look to where the church has
[41:56] come or how that you were sanctified
[41:59] hollywood he came and he brought you
[42:01] right back into what was in his mind in
[42:04] the beginning so the identification of
[42:07] the church in the end time is not a
[42:09] church that came just down from sin and
[42:12] it was crawling up and back up and back
[42:14] up the identification of the church in
[42:16] the end time is the manifestation of
[42:19] what god had in his mind in the
[42:21] beginning
[42:24] when when before the fall could come in
[42:26] and that's why we keep constantly
[42:28] talking and looking and saying what was
[42:30] adam before the fall what was he before
[42:33] the fall what did we see men do what
[42:36] capacity did he have what ability did he
[42:38] have why because that's where we are
[42:41] being brought back into
[42:43] into a mature person who can look and
[42:46] act and manifest the attributes of god
[42:49] someone who's not the body of jesus
[42:52] christ who can come on the scene and do
[42:54] the same things that he did
[42:59] the manifestation of this hour is not
[43:02] just the moving of the spirit because it
[43:04] constantly from one message to another
[43:07] it's always he's taking you right back
[43:09] he's taking you right back where is he
[43:11] taking you to what his desire was
[43:14] because we realized god in the garden of
[43:17] eden he gave a prophecy he put forth his
[43:19] word it says that you shall be fruitful
[43:22] and multiply he kept telling his
[43:24] children you shall be fruitful and
[43:26] multiply and we know according to the
[43:28] message that that prophecy never come to
[43:30] pass
[43:32] we understand that adam came and the
[43:34] devil came in and all of that fall apart
[43:37] and and man came through sin and all
[43:39] those things but there had to come a
[43:41] time where god will take that word and
[43:45] bring it back to his people we're gonna
[43:47] come a time where we could come back and
[43:49] the words everything that had been
[43:51] fallen anything that had been shortened
[43:54] anything that had been because remember
[43:56] god has a permissive will and god has a
[43:59] perfect will so
[44:01] both the permissive and the perfect will
[44:03] always works out to be god's perfect
[44:05] will in the end time he will take the
[44:08] permissive will not so he can keep it as
[44:10] a permissive will but to take that
[44:12] permissive will and turn it right back
[44:14] into the perfect will
[44:16] now now let me say this now he is
[44:19] talking about the church he's talking
[44:22] about the very church and the
[44:23] manifestation of this tower now we're
[44:26] right here and and and uh paul spoken i
[44:30] believe it was in sec first corinthians
[44:32] 13 he said when i was as a child i spoke
[44:36] as a child and i did a childish things
[44:38] now
[44:39] again when we look at the focus of what
[44:42] we're looking for we can understand
[44:45] there is not even too long after
[44:47] pentecost
[44:50] not even too long after pentecost they
[44:53] already saying that oh i i we look
[44:56] through glass darkly we we we're trying
[44:59] to understand what is the end goal of
[45:02] this where is this going what is the
[45:04] very mystery that god is trying to
[45:06] reveal what what is the end goal of what
[45:08] we're trying to achieve
[45:10] now you know but random speaks in the
[45:12] message uh the the marriage and the
[45:14] force and i'll just pick this up so i
[45:17] can continue it says now
[45:19] he speaks about the the woman it says
[45:22] and so
[45:23] it is with a church that refuses to
[45:25] become pregnant in this in the in the
[45:28] age uh that we live now he says to bring
[45:32] forth a child of this age
[45:35] now listen to where is putting the focus
[45:37] to bring forth the child of this age we
[45:40] are not lutheran we are not westlands
[45:43] we are not pentecostal we've got to be
[45:46] the child of this age
[45:49] though the pregnancy of the it says
[45:53] through the pregnancy of the word to
[45:55] bring forth a child of this age the seed
[45:59] child amen i hope you understand it says
[46:03] couldn't be uh couldn't be pregnant uh
[46:05] couldn't be pregnanted not not so we
[46:08] could uh we could uh
[46:11] not show what we did or he he
[46:14] not so what
[46:16] did we did he do
[46:18] put her away it says in the force that's
[46:20] right but she dares
[46:23] to put him away he puts her away
[46:26] it says he went right into the right he
[46:29] went
[46:29] right on to revealing his word to his
[46:32] body
[46:33] vindicating himself
[46:35] same himself his children began to
[46:39] kind of look more like him
[46:41] becoming in the fully maturing
[46:45] oh they are becoming children of the
[46:47] word
[46:49] not children of the church
[46:51] children of the word
[46:53] well now what is the difference the
[46:55] church but one of them speaks even as
[46:57] oppressor spoke this morning there's a
[46:59] major difference between the church and
[47:01] the bride because the church is what
[47:04] falls within the movement of what's
[47:06] happening it's what falls within oh this
[47:09] is they doing this over here we're going
[47:11] to do the same over here they're doing
[47:13] that it's the conformity of what people
[47:16] are trying to do but the bride is one
[47:18] who's directly being inspired by the
[47:21] spirit of god being moved by the word of
[47:24] god to fulfill what god wants out of her
[47:29] that's why we have to find out ask
[47:31] ourselves what is influencing me and
[47:34] what am i manifesting am i manifesting
[47:37] what i see this group over here manifest
[47:39] what i hear this group over here
[47:40] manifest what i what i think this group
[47:43] how to manifest but there has to be a
[47:45] word foundation for you to go back and
[47:47] say i have read the scripture i have
[47:50] through the opening of the message i
[47:52] have seen what is required for this hour
[47:55] i have seen what the manifestation of
[47:58] this hour is and i'm going after it
[48:02] amen
[48:03] one one is caught up within the natural
[48:06] and the things that's happening but one
[48:08] is focused the other is focused on the
[48:10] spiritual wondering what is it that god
[48:13] is trying to show me and the word is
[48:15] constantly revealing itself to her
[48:18] that's how she knows the mind of god
[48:22] and
[48:23] and so he continues and says that not
[48:26] the children of the word and the bride
[48:29] will be a lovely little lady
[48:31] lady of the word
[48:34] unadulterated not touched by any man
[48:37] organization by any man's own
[48:38] organization any man-made theory she's
[48:42] purely unadulterated right of the word
[48:45] amen and amen i hope you get that it
[48:49] says out in the air you shall be
[48:52] pregnant a daughter of god now i want to
[48:55] say this
[48:56] jesus is not coming to marry a girl
[49:00] he's not coming to marry a a baby per se
[49:04] it's not coming to to marry an immature
[49:07] uh uh a girl or baby that's playing in
[49:10] the sand
[49:12] it's not interested in one who's crying
[49:14] and
[49:15] and turning the tempers and and doing
[49:17] all kinds of things is looking for one
[49:20] who's recognized her position and even
[49:22] when we say recognize your position what
[49:25] are we really talking about recognizing
[49:27] your position is to know i have been
[49:30] brought into the maturity in the end
[49:33] time and how this is the building up of
[49:36] what god has been building through the
[49:37] ages and now i'm standing here to show
[49:40] for us a mature bride one who texts the
[49:44] word one who believes what the word says
[49:46] about her one who's changing the image
[49:49] of what the word wants out of her
[49:56] now he says this
[50:00] he continues he says this is in uh this
[50:03] is in a message uh the the the resume of
[50:06] the church age he he talks
[50:10] he he says this and and it says it yet
[50:13] it is harvest time
[50:16] there then must come upon the scene in
[50:19] this age
[50:20] those who will bring the wheat and the
[50:23] terror to maturity
[50:25] the tear has already matured very fast
[50:29] under corrupt teaching
[50:31] who turns the people from the word
[50:34] but the wheat
[50:36] also must mature
[50:40] i i and i say this i believe this is has
[50:43] to be and it is i believe the cry out of
[50:46] every believer every morning you woke up
[50:49] am i walking to maturity
[50:52] i i don't believe god is interested in
[50:54] you walking up and saying what am i
[50:56] gonna eat what am i gonna drink
[50:59] or what is that what is gonna happen
[51:01] today what trap the devil has in front
[51:03] of me i believe maturity is coming to a
[51:06] place where you know i'm here because
[51:09] god placed me here
[51:11] i'm here because god has worked out all
[51:14] things so i can be here
[51:16] and my job here is to try to find out
[51:18] what is it that he wants me to do
[51:21] and walk into it
[51:23] it's not to constantly coming back well
[51:26] i'm a sinner caught up in the cycle of
[51:28] revival and death as we said it last
[51:30] time today you are at the altar tomorrow
[51:33] you're screaming the next day you are
[51:34] back in the altar where are you going
[51:37] what are you achieving is that leading
[51:40] you in the right direction
[51:43] and i believe the lord is patient if we
[51:46] we have someone if we get to a place
[51:48] where we are babes and we need milk it
[51:50] will provide milk when it's necessary
[51:53] but the calling of this hour is a people
[51:57] who are called into the manifestation of
[51:59] the perfect son
[52:01] just like the lord jesus one who can
[52:04] send and say i know what the scripture
[52:06] said about me and i believe what the
[52:08] word said about me and i'm here
[52:11] manifesting what the word says
[52:15] otherwise we don't know what we're doing
[52:18] otherwise we lost in the religion and
[52:21] and and we come and and all the focus
[52:25] all the focus the devil will love to do
[52:27] this if all the focus disavon tonight is
[52:31] about
[52:32] i'm sick i need healing
[52:36] i'm hungry
[52:37] my child is lost
[52:39] and this
[52:40] if that's all the focus
[52:42] the devil will love it to do that
[52:45] but we have to understand that the
[52:47] promises as we walk in this line of duty
[52:50] as we walk in this pathway that he has
[52:53] made he knows we have need of healing he
[52:56] knows we have need for our sons and
[52:58] daughters to be saved he knows we have
[53:00] need of all of that in fact those things
[53:02] are part of the provision that he has
[53:04] already made
[53:07] but a mature person finds out what is my
[53:10] position what is my job where does he
[53:13] needs me to be then in being where he
[53:16] needs me to be he takes care of all the
[53:18] rest that i have
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:23] so we have to find out what is the
[53:26] calling of this hour what am i being
[53:28] called into
[53:30] it's the building as i said the building
[53:32] of everything from
[53:34] the first church agent is building up
[53:36] but what is he building you into
[53:40] now
[53:41] he he says this
[53:44] and let me just slow down for a minute i
[53:47] think i'm going a little faster than i
[53:48] wanted to
[53:50] now let me just say this i was i was
[53:52] thinking about
[53:53] jesus
[53:54] because we can i believe we can always
[53:57] use the model of the church that he
[53:59] built
[54:00] as a model for us and it's it's very
[54:03] important because we could always go
[54:04] back um
[54:06] the scripture says that he came and he
[54:08] told his disciple
[54:10] that that oh that it's imperative it's
[54:13] important that i go
[54:15] now i want you to
[54:17] think of yourself as one of the members
[54:20] of that church
[54:21] you think yeah that we're
[54:24] perhaps in the most comfortable position
[54:26] than any in other words if i came in uh
[54:29] like a woman who came in he was making
[54:31] all kinds of noise i said master tell
[54:34] him to stop and you know when one came
[54:36] and they knew a master was just a call
[54:39] away it was just not too far away that
[54:41] you could work him up
[54:43] they knew when the storm came in the
[54:45] boat it's just a matter of screaming out
[54:47] and saying master can you not see that
[54:49] we perish
[54:51] when they came across the challenge a
[54:52] demon that they had prayed and prayed
[54:54] and couldn't raise him up it's just a
[54:56] matter of waiting until the master get
[54:58] there
[54:59] now jesus looks at that kind of church
[55:01] that he built he says this is not good
[55:04] enough
[55:05] that i need to go
[55:06] it says it's imperative for you that i
[55:09] go but if i go i will come back again
[55:12] i'll begin to think about it in the end
[55:15] time i want you to imagine if brother
[55:17] branham was still alive today
[55:19] i'll tell you there'll be a beating war
[55:21] including me for the house next door
[55:24] oh i don't care how much money would
[55:26] cost i will put money in there to be the
[55:29] first one and imagine the neighborhood
[55:31] and and how much the housing and and if
[55:34] you talk about housing market bubble
[55:36] that would have been the biggest bubble
[55:38] they've ever seen in this world because
[55:40] this will be worldwide everybody from
[55:42] everywhere wanting to just get a spot
[55:45] where they can see him when he gets in
[55:47] his car jesus jesus looks at that kind
[55:50] of church he says i don't want a church
[55:52] where you can just reach out and oh
[55:54] brother david i need you over here
[55:56] whether that be that i need you over
[55:57] there no that's not the kind of church i
[55:59] want to build i'm going away so i can
[56:02] build the perfect church
[56:04] hallelujah and the perfect church will
[56:07] be i will come again and i will be even
[56:10] in you
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:15] and barbara says people get to where
[56:17] they think oh if so and so can pray for
[56:20] me then i'll be healed that's not the
[56:22] church god is building
[56:24] oh if i can only do this and be such and
[56:27] such place then god can hear me that's
[56:29] not the church's building the church's
[56:32] building is his spirit within his
[56:34] children
[56:36] and and he wants to get it to such a
[56:38] place where the husband can pray to the
[56:41] wife or the wife can pray for the
[56:43] husband and believe and god will come on
[56:45] the scene and do it
[56:51] and just like this morning
[56:53] we take all of that we turn into
[56:55] something else
[56:56] we take it and we have our favorite oh
[56:59] if this one if i can only have that
[57:02] brother call him up and have him pray
[57:03] for me oh if i can only go to such and
[57:06] such meeting if i can only do this he
[57:08] becomes your
[57:10] why i asked you tonight where did you
[57:12] get the model of that church
[57:17] because here he is himself
[57:19] he himself the king of glory
[57:22] he who imported them he gave them power
[57:24] to go and cast out devils he looks at
[57:27] the church that he created he looks at
[57:29] the church that he was building he said
[57:32] i'm not going to leave it here
[57:34] i want to take it a step further and
[57:36] this step further is for me to come and
[57:39] live within them
[57:43] oh my brother my sister let's not short
[57:46] ourselves from the glory of the message
[57:49] in the end time let's not short
[57:51] ourselves for what god really wants to
[57:54] do in the end time what god wants to do
[57:57] in the end time is to use your body
[58:00] to defeat the devil i don't care how old
[58:03] you are god is interested tonight in
[58:06] taking his word he already overcame in
[58:09] the body of jesus christ but what is
[58:12] interested tonight is to come and show
[58:14] that same overcoming in the bride's body
[58:21] and we said it last time it's very
[58:23] important you realize whatever the head
[58:25] is the body is also
[58:27] so what he done is he went and he took
[58:30] all that is necessary for the body to
[58:33] overcome he took it within the head so
[58:36] that you don't have to suffer pain so
[58:38] that you don't have to go through
[58:39] trouble but when the head comes and
[58:42] connects to the body what the head was
[58:44] doing the body is able to do also
[58:51] god is looking for individuals
[58:54] he's not looking for a group of people
[59:00] i was thinking
[59:02] i said i was not going to be long
[59:04] i was thinking
[59:06] about enoch
[59:09] you know because enoch is the type of
[59:12] the bride
[59:13] as we heard in the scripture
[59:15] now
[59:16] the scripture doesn't say
[59:19] that enoch and his family got raptured
[59:24] enoch and methuselah
[59:26] walk with god and they were raptured
[59:29] no
[59:31] it says enoch
[59:33] by himself
[59:35] a walk by himself
[59:37] enoch walker walk in them woke up in the
[59:40] morning
[59:41] and walked with god
[59:42] and walked with god
[59:44] it was changed it was changed daily
[59:47] until one day he walked and then he was
[59:49] gone
[59:50] that's the kind of relationship this
[59:52] message is bringing us into it's not a
[59:55] group with message relationship like
[59:57] pastor said this morning god is not
[1:00:01] it doesn't do us any good to gather here
[1:00:03] and say we believe the message and
[1:00:05] shouted and pet one another in the back
[1:00:08] that's not what god is looking for it's
[1:00:10] not good it's just enough for us to say
[1:00:13] all the sales are open and this is done
[1:00:15] and this is you the question you always
[1:00:17] have to ask the sales are open for what
[1:00:20] purpose
[1:00:22] what good does the sale opening do to me
[1:00:25] when you tell me about the seals being
[1:00:27] open what benefits am i drawing from
[1:00:29] that then when you can establish that
[1:00:31] relationship between the sales opening
[1:00:34] and your personal life then it can come
[1:00:36] to a benefit to you
[1:00:41] if we're not careful anybody that says
[1:00:43] they're part of the message we give him
[1:00:45] a pass
[1:00:46] oh you know he said it's part of the
[1:00:48] message but the scripture says you have
[1:00:50] to try them you have to know the
[1:00:52] character they have to have put
[1:00:54] something on display by their fruit you
[1:00:56] shall know them not by what they believe
[1:00:58] by the fruit you shall know them
[1:01:01] therefore the bride's desire and i'll
[1:01:04] say this i'll say it again it because
[1:01:06] it's burning within me just like fire is
[1:01:09] to see i want to know what the
[1:01:11] manifestation of this hour is i want to
[1:01:14] have faith in what the word said i will
[1:01:16] be so i can walk into it
[1:01:21] i'm not walking up in the morning and
[1:01:23] asking myself
[1:01:24] how many people did you heal today
[1:01:27] i would love to do it
[1:01:30] but that's not healing is not part of
[1:01:33] what i what i desire
[1:01:35] i want to know
[1:01:37] what is the word says
[1:01:39] because if i walk in obedience to the
[1:01:42] word
[1:01:43] everything else will be taken care of
[1:01:46] if i walk in the manifestation of the
[1:01:48] hour it will take care of healing it
[1:01:51] will take care of deliverance you will
[1:01:53] take care of everything then when a
[1:01:55] person can come here you can stand here
[1:01:57] and say in the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:59] stand up and walk why because you're
[1:02:02] walking in perfect obedience to the word
[1:02:11] it says this
[1:02:13] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:02:14] sun i want you to hear it says
[1:02:17] and we we read this it says and as
[1:02:21] christ was the first
[1:02:23] one to rise
[1:02:25] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:02:28] and it says
[1:02:30] all those types of many place many
[1:02:32] places he was the first first of those
[1:02:35] that slipped
[1:02:37] it says
[1:02:38] in the bride the coming of christ
[1:02:41] coming out of the church
[1:02:43] they will have a sheave
[1:02:45] wave again in the last day we went
[1:02:49] through this
[1:02:50] what was the purpose of the sheave to
[1:02:52] show you what you need to point to
[1:02:55] to show you what you need to focus on to
[1:02:58] show you what where you're walking
[1:03:00] towards to show you what you will be
[1:03:03] translated into to show you what you're
[1:03:06] walking and knowing that i'm gonna be
[1:03:08] this is to because god is doing that he
[1:03:11] doesn't want you to be left confused he
[1:03:14] doesn't want you to wonder what is the
[1:03:16] manifestation that we're talking about
[1:03:18] where are we going and what are we
[1:03:19] supposed to be manifested
[1:03:22] it's right there in the life of the
[1:03:24] prophet he showed us what a true
[1:03:27] manifestation and what a true wave shift
[1:03:30] offering is so we can look at his life
[1:03:33] so we can look his walk with god and be
[1:03:35] able to look and say that's what i
[1:03:37] desired
[1:03:44] you know you read certain things about a
[1:03:46] prophet truth
[1:03:48] you have to really dig deep to find them
[1:03:51] within yourself
[1:03:54] i think about the story that was told
[1:03:56] about
[1:03:57] how that he crossed the board and said
[1:03:58] he didn't have anything in the trunk and
[1:04:01] and he went and found out that he had
[1:04:03] something and drove all the way back
[1:04:06] you got to dig deep
[1:04:08] really deep to find out within you
[1:04:12] you can give yourself all the
[1:04:13] justification in the world i didn't know
[1:04:16] it i didn't know it was in there i
[1:04:18] didn't say i said what i thought i knew
[1:04:20] at that time i can't drive all the way
[1:04:22] back find all kinds of excuses
[1:04:29] brothers that's what i desire
[1:04:32] i i don't
[1:04:33] desire take this whole world and give me
[1:04:36] jesus give me that kind of a heart
[1:04:38] desire one who stands and his shoes are
[1:04:41] hurting and he's been preaching meeting
[1:04:44] after meeting he's standing there he's
[1:04:46] standing for the people and he knows
[1:04:48] what they're thinking about him
[1:04:51] oh my he knows and he can scream out he
[1:04:54] said i know what you say about me
[1:04:58] but still stand there with the love of
[1:04:59] god and preach the word and preach the
[1:05:02] word what about i'll tell you that's the
[1:05:04] capstone on display that's perfect love
[1:05:07] coming down and my brother my sister
[1:05:10] that's what we desire that's why i read
[1:05:12] that scripture take this whole world
[1:05:14] take all that you can give me that kind
[1:05:17] of person give me that kind of hearts
[1:05:19] and desire to just be to a place where
[1:05:22] all i desire to see is him
[1:05:26] and yet we are counting healings on this
[1:05:29] hand and healing on the other hand and
[1:05:31] the very prophets say if i will pray for
[1:05:34] a thousand new fall i'll keep praying
[1:05:36] because the word is what's important
[1:05:45] you heal this body's gonna die still
[1:05:51] what is our focus on
[1:05:54] are we moved by the thunders
[1:05:57] by the shaking of the wind
[1:06:00] or are we seeking a small voice to hear
[1:06:02] and say this is what you should do
[1:06:06] this is what you should follow
[1:06:08] now he says
[1:06:10] he says the bright coming of christ
[1:06:12] coming out they'll have a chief offering
[1:06:14] shiv wave offering again in the last day
[1:06:16] oh my waving the sheave what
[1:06:20] says wha
[1:06:21] what was the sheave the one that came
[1:06:24] the one that came into mature that came
[1:06:28] to mature the first one that proved it
[1:06:31] was a weed
[1:06:33] that proves it was a sheave
[1:06:36] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[1:06:39] talking about it was waved over the
[1:06:42] people and the first and it says in the
[1:06:44] first time there was to come forth there
[1:06:47] was the there there will come forth the
[1:06:49] bright in the right for the bright age
[1:06:51] for resurrection out of the denomination
[1:06:54] will be a message he says that will fool
[1:06:59] that that the full maturity of the world
[1:07:02] has turned back again into the full
[1:07:05] power
[1:07:07] he's saying being waved over the people
[1:07:09] by the same sign and the same wonders
[1:07:12] that he did back there then i said
[1:07:15] that's why when we read this message i
[1:07:17] read the scripture in first
[1:07:19] thessalonians but whatever says
[1:07:21] he says he talks about uh even the very
[1:07:24] order of the rapture he says the shout
[1:07:27] comes forth what is the shout it says
[1:07:29] it's the
[1:07:30] living bread of life calling forth the
[1:07:33] bride and then he says what is the voice
[1:07:36] it's the voice of the resurrection what
[1:07:38] is the trump is to gather up all so we
[1:07:40] can go and meet up for the waiting
[1:07:43] supper now he's saying all those things
[1:07:45] and he says
[1:07:46] he says he does all these things as he's
[1:07:49] descending oh my brother my sister now
[1:07:52] remember he said that the rapture and
[1:07:54] faith will not come until the opening of
[1:07:57] the sails because it says it's them
[1:07:59] seven sails that will awaken the bride
[1:08:02] and put forth in her the rapture in
[1:08:04] faith so therefore when it comes after
[1:08:07] the opening of the seals and he began to
[1:08:10] talk about these things there is a group
[1:08:12] of people who are being taken back and
[1:08:16] there's a group of people who are
[1:08:18] realizing what they were since the
[1:08:20] beginning and they have received the
[1:08:22] word the word is calling them for
[1:08:24] highest calling than any may have ever
[1:08:27] been called and they've accepted it and
[1:08:30] they know by accepting the word of god
[1:08:32] god will bring those things to come to
[1:08:34] pass
[1:08:37] how is the body going to be changed by
[1:08:39] believing the world
[1:08:44] you said how is that possible how is it
[1:08:47] possible that you're sitting here
[1:08:48] tonight
[1:08:49] how is it possible you tell me how is it
[1:08:52] possible you sitting here tonight and
[1:08:54] i'll tell you how it's possible for your
[1:08:56] body to be changed
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:00] i can count all possible ways that i
[1:09:03] could be here tonight i can't find one
[1:09:10] the same god who created a miracle
[1:09:13] who changed situations who put you in
[1:09:16] such a bind why you couldn't deny him
[1:09:19] who opened your eyes to see this message
[1:09:21] who walked with you who wastes you from
[1:09:23] the dead who delivers you from the
[1:09:26] things he's the same god who's going to
[1:09:28] change your body
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:33] the moment we take our eyes off this and
[1:09:36] we look to someone
[1:09:38] we're going in a different line like we
[1:09:40] heard it this morning
[1:09:43] then what do we do
[1:09:46] we put now i'll say this
[1:09:48] we even get to a place because remember
[1:09:51] when you do that
[1:09:53] you counting say
[1:09:55] well so if that weather goes missing
[1:09:58] that means the rapture is taking place
[1:10:00] hear me out it means you put someone
[1:10:03] before
[1:10:05] you in the rapture what the prophet is
[1:10:08] saying if there's to be one going
[1:10:10] if there'll be one going it has to be
[1:10:12] you you've already displaced everything
[1:10:19] i don't care if i don't see anybody i
[1:10:22] know the rapture didn't start because
[1:10:24] i'm here
[1:10:27] oh my brother my sister and i want to
[1:10:29] say this when jesus hearing is going
[1:10:31] through the garden of gethsemane he had
[1:10:33] a will as a man he has a will but when
[1:10:36] he says he could have married he could
[1:10:37] have done all of that but it's not until
[1:10:40] he died to everything until he was
[1:10:42] killed from everything else and the only
[1:10:45] thing that took him from where he was
[1:10:47] into where he was growing was faith in
[1:10:49] the word of god
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:52] we can't make it without faith
[1:10:55] we cannot make it by intellect what we
[1:10:58] need is the word the reveal word of the
[1:11:00] hour to create faith within our heart
[1:11:08] we
[1:11:09] we would have to die for every inner
[1:11:13] like thing we've learned
[1:11:17] every little bit of what we claim to
[1:11:19] believe will be tested
[1:11:23] you would have to come to a place you
[1:11:25] say if god doesn't come i'm dead
[1:11:31] and that's where you begin
[1:11:35] you have to come to the consciousness
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:38] i don't care what men said
[1:11:40] i don't care what explanation has been
[1:11:43] told
[1:11:44] if god said this i'm walking in it
[1:11:46] you're gonna get killed that's all right
[1:11:49] you're gonna get cast down that's all
[1:11:51] right because we are not called to go as
[1:11:53] a group we are being called to go as an
[1:11:56] individual who's met god face to face
[1:12:05] so you have to ask yourself what the the
[1:12:09] the bride's
[1:12:10] condition in the end time what i'm
[1:12:13] hearing the fellowship that i'm
[1:12:14] associating with everything that i'm
[1:12:16] doing
[1:12:18] is it leading me to this kind of
[1:12:20] manifestation is it leading me to this
[1:12:23] kind of mindset
[1:12:25] or is it something that brings you right
[1:12:27] back
[1:12:28] to where you started again and brings
[1:12:30] you right back into where you feel like
[1:12:33] this is not enough you need something
[1:12:35] else and and you need to go back and
[1:12:37] repent and go back and repent the
[1:12:39] scripture says that if we walk in the
[1:12:42] blood if we walk in the light as he is
[1:12:45] the light the blood of christ cleanses
[1:12:47] us from all uncleanness
[1:12:51] your uncleanness he's taking care of it
[1:13:00] so he says here
[1:13:04] here it is what i'm trying to say
[1:13:07] the law of reproduction is that
[1:13:10] each species
[1:13:12] bringeth forth after its own kind
[1:13:17] now i want to say this before i continue
[1:13:19] to read
[1:13:20] each species bring forth after its own
[1:13:22] kind
[1:13:23] when a chicken has an egg
[1:13:26] that egg will not remain an egg
[1:13:29] it would hatch
[1:13:30] it will start up as little and it will
[1:13:33] grow the law of reproduction causes it
[1:13:37] to come back like a chicken again
[1:13:41] in the image of the chicken
[1:13:44] not to remain just a little baby chicken
[1:13:47] but to come right back into the full
[1:13:49] maturity of a chicken
[1:13:54] and i believe that's why the prophet
[1:13:56] will say some places it says oh i'm
[1:13:58] saying this because i need to rub up
[1:14:00] some of the med belief that we still
[1:14:02] have and i'll say this because i need to
[1:14:04] just
[1:14:05] make it perfectly clear because of this
[1:14:08] and why because he knows when we are
[1:14:10] born we have all kinds of things
[1:14:12] following us we have our unbelief our
[1:14:14] ways that we have learned from the world
[1:14:16] and the things that the church and what
[1:14:18] the church has done you know i'll say
[1:14:20] this everyone sitting here has been
[1:14:22] influenced by catholic
[1:14:25] you find out our mind has been always
[1:14:27] influenced you look at you say well i
[1:14:29] didn't go to a catholic church whatever
[1:14:31] denomination you went to
[1:14:33] is part of the mother
[1:14:39] well our mind is always
[1:14:41] in a certain way and we hear something
[1:14:43] we jump in front of it
[1:14:45] oh perhaps this is it that's it
[1:14:47] god is saying no just walk with me
[1:14:50] let me lead you let me take you you see
[1:14:53] it stay there continue to ask for it
[1:14:56] continue to praise for it continue to do
[1:14:58] it until i open your eyes until i make
[1:15:01] it manifest to you
[1:15:03] not until you figure it out yourself
[1:15:05] until i
[1:15:07] make it manifest
[1:15:08] the only thing that the seed has to do
[1:15:11] is to remain in the presence of the sun
[1:15:14] there is no other requirement
[1:15:20] now he says
[1:15:22] the species it says according to genesis
[1:15:24] 1 and 11 it says and god said let it let
[1:15:27] you bring forth the grass
[1:15:29] the earth yielding seed and the fruity
[1:15:31] uh tree yielding fruits of this kind who
[1:15:34] sit in itself who is in itself upon the
[1:15:37] earth and it was so it says whatever
[1:15:40] life was in the seed
[1:15:42] come forth into the plant
[1:15:46] into the plants and once and dance into
[1:15:49] fruit
[1:15:50] it says the very same law applies to the
[1:15:53] church today
[1:15:56] what law
[1:15:58] i would come again
[1:16:00] and i even i
[1:16:02] will pour into you
[1:16:04] what i am so the works that i do
[1:16:08] you may do also
[1:16:10] now i just want to let me read this and
[1:16:12] then i'll break into something here and
[1:16:14] then we can come back
[1:16:16] it says it says now
[1:16:18] um whatever seed started the church will
[1:16:20] come forth will come forth and be like
[1:16:23] the original seed because it's the same
[1:16:26] seed
[1:16:27] indeed it says in in these last days
[1:16:30] the true right the true church bride he
[1:16:34] says
[1:16:34] christ seed will come
[1:16:37] to the headstone
[1:16:41] will come into the headstone
[1:16:44] and she will be a super church a super
[1:16:48] race
[1:16:50] as she nears him
[1:16:54] they in the bride will be so much like
[1:16:58] him
[1:17:00] that they will even be in his very image
[1:17:08] what are we walking into
[1:17:11] now the
[1:17:13] the the
[1:17:14] it's not hard to find out what his image
[1:17:16] is because all we have to do is go back
[1:17:18] in the scripture
[1:17:21] this is not something that someone needs
[1:17:23] to explain to you
[1:17:24] and his image that we know of is the sun
[1:17:28] can do nothing except what he sees the
[1:17:31] father do
[1:17:32] just get to a place where
[1:17:34] what a humility
[1:17:36] what a man a humble man
[1:17:38] you could even push him he looked like
[1:17:40] there was no beauty in him to be desired
[1:17:42] he didn't walk down the streets and
[1:17:44] everybody noticed him
[1:17:46] he was just such a humble man in the
[1:17:48] ward oh but within that man lies the
[1:17:52] power of almighty god lied the greatest
[1:17:55] power that ever touched the earth within
[1:17:58] that man lies the whole mighty god
[1:18:00] himself my brother my sister that's the
[1:18:02] type of the bride oh we get to a place
[1:18:05] where oh let me say this when you read a
[1:18:08] scripture about jesus christ you might
[1:18:10] as well put your name in it because
[1:18:12] jesus today is you
[1:18:14] it's the manifestation of this tower
[1:18:17] when we say he went and he did this it's
[1:18:19] you that's doing it
[1:18:28] is that what we're manifesting
[1:18:30] is that at least what we our heart is
[1:18:33] pressing for
[1:18:34] or are we still at the level where
[1:18:37] oh father i can't do nothing today i
[1:18:40] need healing and i need
[1:18:41] oh i tell you if you were purposed
[1:18:43] within your heart to do something for
[1:18:45] god i don't care what devil stands on
[1:18:47] your way
[1:18:48] well i'm not well you know what i'm
[1:18:50] going to do this is the business of my
[1:18:52] father and i believe as i'm doing his
[1:18:54] business he'll take care of all of this
[1:18:56] how many times a preacher has ever shown
[1:18:58] up here not feeling well at all and he
[1:19:00] just comes and he knows this is the post
[1:19:02] of duty he stands up here and before too
[1:19:05] long it feels like it was nothing how
[1:19:07] many times have you went to church or
[1:19:09] done something where you feel like you
[1:19:12] couldn't do it but just decided to go
[1:19:14] anyway you just decided to show up
[1:19:16] anyway and then god just drops right in
[1:19:19] there and he changes the situation
[1:19:23] it's a battle it's not gonna come easy
[1:19:26] you have to pull it out you have to ask
[1:19:28] for it you have to demand it you have to
[1:19:31] walk in it you have to come and take it
[1:19:33] out of the devil you have to claim it as
[1:19:35] yours
[1:19:40] getting to a place where oh i just need
[1:19:42] this
[1:19:44] the scripture says
[1:19:46] the son
[1:19:48] as he is as a child
[1:19:50] is no different from a slave
[1:19:54] why because he doesn't understand the
[1:19:56] difference between
[1:19:58] what belongs to him
[1:20:00] what authority has been given he's still
[1:20:02] under tutors but when he comes to an age
[1:20:05] where he understand what the father's
[1:20:07] business is and i believe the church in
[1:20:09] the end time is the church who's walking
[1:20:12] into maturity to understand the full
[1:20:15] picture why are we here saying that the
[1:20:18] mind of christ has been revealed to us
[1:20:20] it says what was in god's part back part
[1:20:22] of the mind god has made it known to you
[1:20:25] for what so you can walk in the maturity
[1:20:28] because as he's revealing himself he's
[1:20:31] revealing you
[1:20:38] now
[1:20:40] just for a few moments this is john 17
[1:20:43] and this is the prayer that jesus prayed
[1:20:45] for you
[1:20:47] now listen it says and this word spake
[1:20:49] jesus said he lifted up his eyes in
[1:20:52] heaven and said father the hours come
[1:20:55] glorify thy son
[1:20:56] and the son will also thy son also may
[1:20:59] glorify thee
[1:21:01] it says a thou as thou giveth me power
[1:21:05] over all flesh
[1:21:07] and has
[1:21:09] that that he should give eternal life
[1:21:12] as many as thou has given me
[1:21:15] who else has been given power to give
[1:21:17] eternal life
[1:21:20] oh my
[1:21:21] it's about time we change our prayer
[1:21:26] he continues on and he says
[1:21:28] and this is life eternal
[1:21:30] that ye might know that they might know
[1:21:33] that they might know
[1:21:35] that they might know thee the only true
[1:21:38] and true god and jesus christ whom that
[1:21:41] has sinned
[1:21:44] think about this jesus is positioning
[1:21:46] himself just as the messenger
[1:21:49] making you realize whose power this is
[1:21:52] oh what do we say if the same spirit
[1:21:54] that raised christ from the dead he
[1:21:57] didn't raise himself up it was a spirit
[1:21:59] that raised them up if the same spirit
[1:22:01] dwells in you it will also what quicken
[1:22:04] your mortal body so that same god jesus
[1:22:07] is positioning and says i want where i'm
[1:22:10] standing that they can stand there too i
[1:22:13] want the same way you give me power to
[1:22:15] raise the dead you give me power to give
[1:22:18] eternal life that they can do it too
[1:22:21] he says and i have glory it says i have
[1:22:24] glorified thee on earth i have finished
[1:22:27] the work that thou has given to me
[1:22:30] me to do
[1:22:31] oh now father glorify me with thine own
[1:22:34] self
[1:22:35] that glorify me with thy own self with
[1:22:38] the glory which i had indeed before the
[1:22:41] world was
[1:22:42] who else had glory before the world one
[1:22:45] that's the revealing of the end time is
[1:22:48] that you are not just a fallen sinner
[1:22:51] you're just not a person try to make it
[1:22:53] to heaven the understanding of the end
[1:22:56] time is you are being brought back into
[1:22:58] the glory that you had in the beginning
[1:23:01] the scripture says the sons of god
[1:23:03] shouted for joy what joy did we shout
[1:23:06] for because we were part of god's plan
[1:23:08] in the beginning
[1:23:12] let's not sell ourselves short
[1:23:16] let's not
[1:23:17] diminish all the great work even the
[1:23:20] scripture telling us that all the great
[1:23:22] prophets that desire to be in this hour
[1:23:26] this is not just
[1:23:28] our poor my spirit we get another
[1:23:30] baptism of the holy ghost and we're good
[1:23:34] now
[1:23:35] this is
[1:23:36] the return
[1:23:37] to what was in the beginning
[1:23:40] this is where it all began
[1:23:45] it says
[1:23:47] i have manifested thy name unto them
[1:23:50] which thou giveth me out of the world
[1:23:53] it says
[1:23:55] thine the word
[1:23:57] and thou giveth them me
[1:23:59] and they i have kept by
[1:24:02] i have kept and and they have kept thy
[1:24:05] word so notice is saying
[1:24:07] those that came to him there were those
[1:24:10] that were given to him
[1:24:12] do you know there are those that are
[1:24:14] given to you too
[1:24:17] do you know there are those that are
[1:24:19] given into you
[1:24:20] so that you will speak to them and god
[1:24:23] will move and make it manifest they are
[1:24:25] those that only you can touch they are
[1:24:28] those that are giving in you your heart
[1:24:31] hurt for them and god moves on the thing
[1:24:34] what are we doing why are we selling
[1:24:36] ourselves short he's here praying and
[1:24:39] showing you everything about yourself so
[1:24:42] you can go and pray the same prayer and
[1:24:44] say father i'm here i'm asking because
[1:24:47] my heart is moving for such and such if
[1:24:50] my heart is moving that means you give
[1:24:52] them to me
[1:24:56] but the holy spirit in the end time is
[1:24:58] like walking on
[1:25:01] nails right
[1:25:02] walking just a tight knight you don't
[1:25:04] want to sin you don't want to offend
[1:25:06] anybody you just want to make sure that
[1:25:08] only you mix it to the end
[1:25:11] the bride is not going to be a defeated
[1:25:13] fall
[1:25:14] the bride is not going to make it just
[1:25:16] us all we can say we made it the bride
[1:25:19] is walking victorious
[1:25:21] because the victory came from the head
[1:25:24] down to the body the bride is here to
[1:25:27] walk in the scripture that was speaking
[1:25:29] about her she's here to turn upside down
[1:25:32] the devil's kingdom
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:39] i don't want anything short than to
[1:25:41] create the biggest trouble for the devil
[1:25:47] but if we walk in the morning and all we
[1:25:49] care about oh my it's just me or god i'm
[1:25:52] the only one that you save and god is
[1:25:55] looking like
[1:25:57] do you understand i have children
[1:25:58] everywhere and and do we think
[1:26:01] that
[1:26:02] they're gonna come something that's so
[1:26:04] big and that god will have to rearrange
[1:26:07] his plan
[1:26:09] and say well i didn't see the devil
[1:26:11] pulling this on me
[1:26:14] we said it last time in fact everything
[1:26:16] that he does he asked for permission
[1:26:21] everything that he can touch he has to
[1:26:23] ask for permission
[1:26:28] it says
[1:26:30] now
[1:26:32] they have known
[1:26:33] it says
[1:26:34] they have known
[1:26:36] that all things
[1:26:38] whatsoever thou had given me
[1:26:42] are of thee
[1:26:44] for i have given that unto them the
[1:26:46] words
[1:26:48] which thou givet me
[1:26:49] and they received them
[1:26:51] aren't you glad to receive the word
[1:26:54] he he gave the word to a word receiver
[1:26:58] he gave the word to one that would
[1:27:00] receive it
[1:27:02] and i have known surely that i have it
[1:27:04] says and i know and i have known surely
[1:27:08] that i have come out
[1:27:09] uh i have come out from thee
[1:27:12] it says and they have believed
[1:27:15] that thou did ascend me. i pray for i
[1:27:19] pray for them i pray not for the world
[1:27:22] but i pray for them which thou had given
[1:27:24] me
[1:27:25] for they are dying
[1:27:28] it says and all mine are dying
[1:27:31] and dying of mine
[1:27:33] and i'm glorified in them
[1:27:37] everything about you is his
[1:27:39] everything about his is yours
[1:27:42] now it's easy for us to believe that
[1:27:44] everything ours is years but when it
[1:27:46] comes for his to be ours you're like
[1:27:48] that's too much
[1:27:51] it is but uh not the measure that i want
[1:27:54] it to be it's a little bit smaller
[1:27:56] because i can't receive it because you
[1:27:58] make your own excuses
[1:28:01] yes jesus saying you gave me life you
[1:28:04] gave me eternal life and i gave it to
[1:28:06] them you told me and i told them all
[1:28:09] that's yours is mine all that's mine is
[1:28:12] yours a perfect prayer in fact he comes
[1:28:15] back and he says the same way that you
[1:28:17] sent me i'm sending them how did he how
[1:28:20] how was he sent
[1:28:22] barbara says the same god who sent him
[1:28:25] dwelt within him
[1:28:27] oh my brother my sister god didn't send
[1:28:30] you just by yourself the same god is
[1:28:33] here to dwell in you to go inside of you
[1:28:39] the manifestation of this house
[1:28:41] if the musician could come out you just
[1:28:43] keep going and going
[1:28:58] so
[1:29:01] it says and now
[1:29:03] it says i'm no more in the world it says
[1:29:06] now i am no more in the world
[1:29:09] but these are in this world
[1:29:12] and i cut and i come to thee holy father
[1:29:15] keep through thine own name those whom
[1:29:19] thou had give it thou giveth me
[1:29:22] given me that they may that they may
[1:29:25] uh be one as we are one
[1:29:28] while i was with them in the world i
[1:29:31] kept them by thy name
[1:29:34] now i i want you to to pay attention to
[1:29:36] this
[1:29:38] i kept them by thy name
[1:29:41] it says
[1:29:43] those that that thou giveth me i have
[1:29:46] kept them and none of them is lost but
[1:29:49] the son of prediction that the scripture
[1:29:51] may be fulfilled and now i come to thee
[1:29:54] that these and these things i speak in
[1:29:57] the world that they might have joy that
[1:30:00] they may have joy their joy fulfilled in
[1:30:03] themselves
[1:30:04] i have given them the word
[1:30:06] and the world hated them
[1:30:11] oh my
[1:30:12] i tell you this he's manifesting he's
[1:30:15] telling what the what happened to him
[1:30:18] when he was sent he's showing the
[1:30:20] description of what happened to him when
[1:30:22] he was said and he's matching that
[1:30:24] description with you
[1:30:26] the moment you touch this word the
[1:30:28] moment you receive this word the moment
[1:30:31] you come in contact and accept this word
[1:30:34] automatically the world hates you
[1:30:40] automatically something is wrong with
[1:30:42] you
[1:30:43] but oh he's saying that i kept them by
[1:30:46] my name what is the name of the father
[1:30:49] the lord jesus christ and as he went he
[1:30:52] came back on the day of pentecost he
[1:30:55] says let there be baptized and you shall
[1:30:57] receive the gift of the holy ghost but
[1:31:00] as in whose name the name of the father
[1:31:02] the name of the son and the name of the
[1:31:04] holy ghost which is what the lord jesus
[1:31:07] christ so he comes back as the spirit
[1:31:10] himself to dwell in them
[1:31:12] and protect them
[1:31:14] let's not forget what church is god
[1:31:17] looking for
[1:31:18] it's not looking for a church that has
[1:31:21] built the nickelodeon spirit where
[1:31:23] there's always one man that we got to go
[1:31:25] to oh that's why i appreciate our
[1:31:27] pastors approaching everything you got
[1:31:30] somebody who's sick absolutely you can
[1:31:32] call and get some help but be the first
[1:31:34] one to pray be the first one to cast out
[1:31:37] that devil be the first one to come and
[1:31:39] say i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of
[1:31:42] god i've been blessed here for a purpose
[1:31:44] i don't need the world i need jesus and
[1:31:47] if i have jesus within my heart that's
[1:31:49] good enough
[1:31:52] now but ranam says it says
[1:31:55] in a very plain language the true bride
[1:31:57] of christ was in the mind of god
[1:32:00] eternally don't not express until each
[1:32:04] came in the designation
[1:32:06] uh
[1:32:07] decreased season
[1:32:09] but it says each member comes from
[1:32:12] each member comes
[1:32:14] forth
[1:32:15] in uh come forth
[1:32:18] it becomes expressed
[1:32:20] and took its place in the body
[1:32:23] each member
[1:32:25] this is not a global expression it's not
[1:32:28] even a church expression but it's each
[1:32:31] member as we are being born we are being
[1:32:34] brought into an individual expression of
[1:32:37] what jesus is that's why we are not
[1:32:40] cloned
[1:32:42] yet we are manifesting the same christ
[1:32:44] but we each have our natures
[1:32:47] manifesting the same christ we have our
[1:32:49] own habits and things and and everything
[1:32:52] but all through the confounds of the
[1:32:53] word why because it's the same christ
[1:32:56] manifesting within his body
[1:32:59] it says this is the this bride thus this
[1:33:03] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:33:07] bride
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:12] literal spoken word
[1:33:14] seed bride
[1:33:17] i i want you to just let that sink in
[1:33:19] for a moment
[1:33:22] the word of god cannot fail
[1:33:26] man's word will pass away
[1:33:28] but the word of god cannot fail
[1:33:31] what we need to find within ourselves is
[1:33:34] when god spoke something the same god we
[1:33:37] understand that god is his own
[1:33:38] interpreter he will bring the word to
[1:33:40] come to pass what we need to do is stay
[1:33:43] within this other line that our pastor
[1:33:45] has been saying
[1:33:46] i want to stay within that line where
[1:33:49] the word is being manifested expressed
[1:33:51] within my body i'm becoming this word
[1:33:55] being expressed not my own intelligence
[1:33:58] not my own uh touching and feeling oh
[1:34:01] maybe it's this maybe it's that no but
[1:34:03] walking within the compound of the word
[1:34:06] and as you walk in the word he's doing
[1:34:09] the manifestation he's doing the calling
[1:34:12] he's doing i tell you when the sun when
[1:34:15] the the the seed or the flower stands
[1:34:17] before the sun
[1:34:19] all the sun the sun is the one calling
[1:34:21] the flower out of it
[1:34:26] story of the reverend lady it's the sun
[1:34:29] who's pulling it's the sun calling that
[1:34:33] pushes forth the flower to come forth
[1:34:35] it's not you pussing and everything you
[1:34:38] push when it says push you stop when it
[1:34:40] says stop you don't do nothing when it
[1:34:42] says nothing oh but when you hear it
[1:34:45] when it hits your heart you said father
[1:34:47] i'm coming father i'm coming forth oh i
[1:34:50] tell you but i'm speaks about how in the
[1:34:52] end time yeah we are people are
[1:34:54] interested in the kind of religion that
[1:34:56] would just baby them oh you know today
[1:34:59] you need milk and tomorrow you need milk
[1:35:02] you're sick okay we'll do this for you
[1:35:03] we'll do that for you you don't have a
[1:35:05] job we'll do this and do that and and
[1:35:08] and constant oh almost like the kind of
[1:35:10] priest
[1:35:15] almost like a kind of priest he talked
[1:35:16] about a hot house plant
[1:35:19] oh it needs to be sprayed up and he
[1:35:21] needs to be taken care of but he says
[1:35:23] but a true to a true flower a true seed
[1:35:26] is rugged it's been brought forth with
[1:35:29] the true nature of god he knows how to
[1:35:32] repel stuff by itself and he knows how
[1:35:34] to fight and he's been trying to fight
[1:35:37] and and he knows who to call he's coming
[1:35:40] contact with god and you can't take that
[1:35:42] away from them
[1:35:45] let's come in contact more with god
[1:35:48] than we need with our own intellect
[1:35:53] what we need
[1:35:55] is come in contact with that word
[1:35:58] let it just permeate you
[1:36:01] let it just cause you to just break down
[1:36:04] within you
[1:36:05] and come alive again
[1:36:07] and therefore it's no longer you that
[1:36:09] lives with him that lives within you
[1:36:12] he says here
[1:36:14] he says
[1:36:16] now
[1:36:17] then
[1:36:18] here we are coming to a conclusion
[1:36:21] as the eternal logos
[1:36:23] was manifested in the sun
[1:36:25] and then and in jesus dwelleth the all
[1:36:28] fullness of god head bodily and the
[1:36:31] eternal one was the father manifested in
[1:36:33] flesh
[1:36:34] thereby gain the title of son even so we
[1:36:39] eternal
[1:36:40] in the thoughts of in the thoughts
[1:36:43] in the thoughts in our turn become many
[1:36:46] members spoken word seed
[1:36:50] manifested in flesh
[1:36:52] it says those eternal thoughts
[1:36:55] now
[1:36:56] manifested in the flesh
[1:36:58] are sons
[1:37:00] of god
[1:37:02] the son of god in this same time
[1:37:05] is not any man's maid
[1:37:09] handled by any man
[1:37:11] led by any man
[1:37:13] he's led by the spirit of god himself
[1:37:17] you're not made to be handled by people
[1:37:20] you're not made men to handle by men's
[1:37:23] thinking and theology and everything you
[1:37:26] are a son of god
[1:37:28] don't let anything tell you otherwise
[1:37:31] walk like a son joke like a son believe
[1:37:34] what a son can do believe what the word
[1:37:36] says about you believe the manifestation
[1:37:39] of this hour know what you want and
[1:37:42] stand there and proclaim it until god
[1:37:44] makes it a reality
[1:37:48] otherwise you go from prayer line to
