certain ones undergoing surgery and there's been prayer requests turned in for loved ones prayers change things okay and so if we all can bind in together and have an expectation I believe we'll get

brother Cosman I'm looking forward to what the Lord has in store for us amen let's just bow our [Music] heads precious Lord Jesus we I gathered in a place Lord where we can worship you truly where our lives that would come before you Lord would be a pleasing life Lord are you'd be able to find pleasure to receive worship to come with a sincere heart Lord to know that we can call upon your name even in a moment like this and have you come upon the scene not because there was a man that said anything but it's because your word has said it Lord Jesus and heavens and earth will will pass away but your word won't pass because it was there the same yesterday today and forever standing Lord between all your sons and daughters so we just come to you tonight Lord all the all the needs that were brought before you may be by an uplifted the hand Lord I as I think now brother Alexander in his surgery Lord I pray that you go by and Lord as he's recovering Lord that you would recover Lord his surgery Lord that you would provide for him Lord Jesus yes Lord that we would be able to have expectation Lord because it's it's impossible to please you without faith and you told us to have faith in all things that we do Lord because this is the way we can please you raise our faith tonight Lord where we can have a word of testimony where we could come before you and testify that you've been good to us Lord Jesus that's my heart's desire to get closer to you where we can just Unite with you Lord Lord bless the word as it's coming forward May our heart just be pulling on that word as we're

can have your seats I'd like to say a testimony I want to just join brother Matthew you know it's it's always it's always good to have something that the Lord's does for you and we we we walk in expectation knowing that God will always if we if we're if we're obedient to his word he'll always come and and just come out come upon the scene well I just want to give a testimony a few days ago uh me and my dad were looking at a vehicle and um we didn't know that the Lord was going to put this in into action but the Lord did it because we want to be obedient to the word of God so we were just dealing with with this individual and you know he had this van for sale so we went there and checked that out and um he was he he was from Georgia he was um um Armenian and his name was George so we start talking we're test driving he's letting us look at the vehicle and you know I just asked George a question and I said how is it with selling cars and he says you know what he says it's hard he said uh you know it's not the same that it used to be so then that just turned the door to talk to to start talking to him about the Lord so we talk for a few minutes and we get out of the car me and my dad he just invites us into his house to make the paperwork and we start talking and we start talking about the Lord and um then his wife comes out and she starts to get interested and just starts asking you know where we're from and everything and I'll tell you what it was it was such a supernatural presence there because you you can tell that there was hearts that was being poured out and wanting to know more about God and and we stayed there for a few hours and uh once we left we asked to say a prayer for him and it was just so it was just so beautiful the way that the Lord ended it but you know that's how God calls his children and if if we receive this word I it's always upon my heart to testify about the word and you just never know when God puts you in the place just for that reason this was never about the car this was just for the word for us to have the word upon our lips to testify about it so I just want to I just want to be thankful for Life That's My Testimony

our gracious father Lord Lord our hearts beat within us and we look through a glass darkling trying with all our hearts to see what's out in front of us see what the future holds see where we're going but yet father you said take no thought of that yes that your word is sufficient unto the day and the evil thereof we just ask that you would encourage our hearts this evening father and a little thought that's on my heart I as that you would make it alive in the spirits of the believer and that they could learn father so to understand your hidden simplicity and you're revealed in the same and may we be cautioned father as you taught us to buy isav that we might see Lord that take counsel from you father the needs that are before us Lord we ask that you would continually Undertake and father when your hand moves we would ask you father that you would open our eyes that we could see you moving as you order our footsteps father that we would see where you've taken us and stop and lift our hands up and give you praise help me father my desires to overcome to be a better Christian I ask you to be with each of us tonight in jesus' name we pray amen amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles we're going to turn over in Matthew the 4th chapter but I'd like just to uh lay a little schedule out for you uh who's going to be preaching for us I leave this coming Tuesday on the 18th and I'll be gone um if the Rapture comes uh I'll meet you in heaven and uh uh that'll be a great time that's the City I really want to visit so I I probably should put on here you know like uh Berlin and then right next to it you know the New Jerusalem you know because that's really where I want to go that's the city that I want to go to amen and so we just uh but anyway so uh I'll be preaching both services this Sunday it's it's Father's Day and but we'll be preaching um uh both Services Sunday and uh many of you go out and eat on uh Sunday and a lot of times we don't have service but uh we're going to go ahead and have service just for those who would like to come back if you're going to spend time with your family that's certainly okay and then the Wednesday the 19th not these brothers don't know this so they're going to hear this for the first time and then they got to get back with us to make sure it'll work but we're going to ask brother Andrew to speak speak for us the Wednesday the 19th and then the Sunday the 23rd uh brother Billy will speak for us in the morning and we can ask brother Paul to speak for us that evening and then Wednesday the 26th uh we asked David Jr to speak for us and then uh the Sunday the 30th uh we're going to ask brother cosbin to lead songs and then brother Matthew to preach in the morning and brother Billy to preach in the evening and then uh then that Wednesday night uh we're going to ask brother the thir we're g to ask brother Ben W to speak for us if and uh then um on the 7th brother Billy will preach in the morning brother Matthew will preach in the evening and then on the 10th we've asked brother Cosman to speak for us so if you're not going to be here let us know that's the most advanced notice you're ever going to get so you can sit around and be nervous for a couple weeks and then every time you get a sermon ready somebody will come up in front of you and preach it and then you you think oh my but I found out something you can preach the exact same sermon every Sunday and somebody will be blessed because it's not the words that bless you it's The Giver of the words it's his presence that bless you so let's go ahead we want to turn to two scriptures um this evening and and read I I didn't know if if is brother Tim did he is brother Tim here out of town well brother Tim wherever you are happy birthday Tim turned 40 today so we're really uh grateful for that and uh but let us read what Jesus says here in uh in Matthew the fourth chapter in the fourth verse and I I all these verses that have become very common to us that we just speak out uh so quickly the they're starting to come back to me and I'm starting to think through them you you know what I mean and can find out that here's the simple verse but there's God's head in that simplicity so let's read this I think you all know this by heart Jesus answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now that was written in Deuteronomy 8 and3 so Jesus says it is written so I want I want you to catch that now now Jesus is what quoting the scripture so and and then so that's what he said and then I also want to read over in Hebrews another scripture that's very uh we we know so well and that's Hebrews chapter 11 and the sixth verse and it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us this evening in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated and and so as I looked at this scripture and the the if I had a thought or a little thought for us this evening uh trying not to uh take us uh too long is that it it's called living by the word living by the word and and our heart's desire is as we are uh speaking into the uh scriptures and fellowshipping with the church is that we're we want to grow our faith so where we can live by faith and living by the word is living by faith whe When you live by the word you live by faith so if we if if if it's impossible to please God with without faith then the only way that you can really please God is living by the word Peter wrote it this way and he spoke in the scriptures and he said it's by these exceedingly great and precious promises that we become partakers of divine nature and and so I think this is everything that we've have and listening to our messenger say and everything that that we're believing in our hearts our hearts desire is to grow into the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ to be more Christlike to live by the word of God and and that's what Jesus said he says we don't live by bread alone so we don't live by bread alone we live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God therefore we live by the word of God so here's Jesus in a situation where he's being tempted uh he's weak and we heard our Prophet tell us the minute you get tempted the minute you get down the minute he thinks he's got a little bit of advantage on you that's when he really puts forth his attack now that's something to know right because if you know that then you can live by that you can actually sit back and say I'm a little down now I'm a little weary now uh uh but the and the enemy is going to attack me now but but we know that uh the Lord knoweth what we have need of even before we ask and we can cast our cares upon Him for he carth for us us you see now you're living by the word you're living by the word it's the only way that you can please God is to live by the word because our goal is right I mean what we're called to do whether through death or through remaining here on Earth we are really called to be a part of the Resurrection we we're not going to be a part of the second death you know he that is born to the spirit of God he he he doesn't die you know what I mean and that's what that's what we want we don't want that second death we don't want that uh be be consumed by that fire we we want that eternal life that's in Us in each of us now that eternal life is in us because God put us here that this eternal life might be manifested and and so if eternal life is manifested then what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so there's no way you can be like God and not live by the word cuz that's what he said man doesn't live by bread alone but he lives by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's what he lives by that's what be that's what his faith is in because without faith it's impossible to please God and what's God asking you to put your faith in he's not asking you to come up with a conclusion or a result or a want you hear me and say now I'm going to believe that this comes to pass that that's not what that's just not what he's uh that that's just uh not what he's uh asked us to do he hasn't asked us to to have faith in what that we can come up with I want this oh Lord God I want that new truck Lord oh I I I believe God e and I really want this thing and I'm going to have faith that that I get I I get that I get that truck no okay that that approaching by the word of God every good and perfect thing comes from the father above the Lord knows what I have need of you know what I mean and if you don't need it you know maybe some of what you have might go to someplace else like give alms to the poor you know mean so your life starts to change because you know the only way that you can reach that Perfection because if the same spirit that was in him dwelleth in you that's what'll Quicken your mortal body what was the spirit that dwelt in the Lord he said I do nothing in tell the word the father reveals it to me so he lived by the word remember he was going down he says I have need to go by this place and one of the greatest Bible stories for our age that was ever spoken the woman at the well because he had need to go by there he was led by there why was that he was led by there and lived by that word so in this day it became his identification of Discerning the thoughts and the intense of the heart right so now God's looking for good people because we've come up through all the church ages right all the teachings all the doctrines and we've got to the place where we think faith is what what we quote unquote what we believe you know that's what faith is but the faith that that God is looking the faith that it's impossible to please him without is the one that diligently seeks what he said and then lives by it when you live by something right that that means that now you're decision making Your Atmosphere your attitude your approach everything that you do is based on that word because you're living by it okay so there there's a the only way we can manifest him is by manifesting what that he is and what is he he's the word he's the thoughts of God expressed he he was the that those thoughts became tangible in life form that we could look upon him and see what he did how that he acted how that he approached things what that he taught and then we can look there and say there's the word okay that's the word he was our example he was the first fruits uh uh that was of the Resurrection that was that we saw what that life did it quickened his mortal body and brought him out of the Grave because he was obedient to that word see we're not in a battle with the word we're in the battle with our flesh cuz the FLH Wars against the spirit Jesus even said the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak so so this is the the thing that I think is is is so in important for us to understand is what it means to live by the word that's why he told Timothy study to show yourself approved how that you might answer every man now so just think the scripture tells us be slow to speak be slow to wrath wait on your wrath you know what I mean uh don't don't cast your pearls be before dogs you know you just you don't always just testify cuz testifying makes you feel good that you're preaching yourself a sermon you know and you like it and you walk up said I really told them and I really told them and I you know the whole scripture is subjection to the word take no thought what you would say but father the spirit will give you utterance to speak the things when you start living by that I'll tell you one of the hardest ones is take no thought for tomorrow true it's tremendous so we see that Abraham right was the was the father of faith in other words Abraham lived by the promise that God gave him now now this is me inserting myself into the conversation does everybody understand that I'm not this isn't thus sayith the Lord but I I'm I'm going to think about Abraham living by the word of God how many knows that by the time Abraham uh got to his age that he was a a rich man he didn't know that he had lots of cattle he had sheep do you know what I mean and he was he he he he he Liv because he lived now can you imagine him moves to this town and and he from the land of ER and he comes to this land and he says you know I'm going to be the father of Nations i' better start buying up some stuff he's living by the word I better get some land here I better get some sheep I've got a whole nation to feed I got to get some cattle I I better make friends with everybody around me I better start doing favors and and and going and helping people because pretty soon I'm going to I'm going to have many uh many family members here and we're going to have to get around in in the community you know he his whole nature and his whole being and his whole approach took on a completely different view of Life simply because he was living by The Word of Promise and I like the way brother RM tells the story he went down to the doctor and said Doctor you got any room in the hospital uh me and Sarah are going to have a baby and then he comes back 25 years later and says is that room still available now there's a man that's living by the word living by the word so we know that we receive the word of God in this message this hour the message of the hour what God's looking for is men and women that live by that word live by what that was spoken that becomes their life and and now they can put their light on a hill and let their light so shine among men because what was the word of God the word of God was the what the light of men right it it's the only thing uh that gave guidance to mankind of the way to go the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Christ Jesus so the only way that you can be a light is to live by the word because the word is the light of men and there it doesn't do you how much theology you speak or how many words you speak because your actions speak louder than your words so if you're living by the word now you become ambassadors of the Kingdom and there is a kingdom and what he remember he talked about our Prophet talked about those great expansion Bridges you know going from here to there like I always said every road in the world leads back to my house whether it's in Maine or Canada you can go all the way to Points North the farthest Road up there tell there's no roads in any further in Canada the edge of the uh the Northwest Territory and that road leads to my front door you say well what happens if you come to a dead end go back the way you came isn't that what the prophet of God said if you get someplace and you you're stuck go back to where you left them go back to where you found them that then you start living by that you when when didn't he say to be certain of God and then when you when everything comes against you or you you reach obstacles or you find yourself in a spot you don't know whether to turn right or left what did he say he says you get down right you turn every stone you make everything right and then you stand there right and be certain of God be still right because you know that he's God you know that he promised you he wouldn't leave you nor forsake you but he be with you even in you to the end now those are Idle Words unless there's somebody doing it be not hearers of the word but be doers of the word live the word live the message live what's in those books take those sayings and those statements and those little nuggets of of the of wisdom and knowledge that infolded into the the word of God and live by it make your decision based on that that word not a predetermined outcome not a goal that you're trying to reach by doing it now I'm going to do this because I'm expecting a result no you do it because he said so it's all he wants I'm going to live by this word I'm going to do what it says and and and Abraham he he you know he he lived he lived by the word of God there're just some some wonderful statements that I I thought were so marful he says now he says now that's a genuine believer when the Holy Spirit not some persuaded by some other people or not some other thing so you're not persuaded you're not persuaded in to taking the word to try to achieve a desired outcome okay because we're not making no thoughts for tomorrow we're not making plans the evil of the day is sufficient thereof we're not taking no thought of Tomorrow we're not stacking and manipulating the word and trying to place it that we might have influence over somebody or or or or we might build a shell around us or we might try to uh to to get advantage over somebody no we're going to live by that word I'm going to live by it I'm going to be subject to it I'm going to obey it I'm going to I'm not just going to hear it but I'm going to do it without any any idea what the result is except that you know that you diligently sought him right and he's a rewarder so you know the reward is going to be his it's not going to be yours in other words I did this or I built this or I got this no what what is it that you would like what is the purpose father I don't know I don't know what the purpose is in me obeying this word it don't look to me like it would be something that I would do or that I think will work it doesn't it doesn't seem to me to agree with my adversary is a smart move but that's what the word said to do agree with your adversary quickly unless you play the utmost farling so you say how is this going to work I don't know but I live by it I agree quickly I don't get into a battle that's right right I I like I I'm I'm slow to wrath I'm slow to speak you know I I I turn the other cheek I'm living all this I'm doing all this this is this word now has become my mind let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus so what was the mind when all this was tempted the mind that was in Jesus was the word it is written it says over in Deuteronomy that that man don't live by what you're offering me he offered him kingdoms he offered him wealth he offered him jobs he offered him glory he he offered him all those things and and and he just sits back and he says no we don't live by those things we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and so what did he do he he became subject right and obedient even even unto the death of the cross for this cause I have come into the world okay all the opportunity that was there he was living because the word was taking him to Calvary but he knew something else right it is written I shall not suffer my Holy One that's right Amen to be corrupt I'll not suffer my Holy One to to be devoured by the skin worms I'll not suffer my Holy One he knew that he knew something else I have power to lay down my life I have power to take it up again when he went to Calvary to pay the price for your sins that what what you deserve for your sins he would take that chastisement upon him he was going to take those stripes so you could sit one day look at those stripes and he said you see by these Stripes you are healed and you don't care what the doctor says because you're not living by what the doctor said I'm not against doctors you do what doctor say you know what I mean but if the doctor fails that word don't H hallelujah thank you Doctor you've done everything you can do for me the word of God told me to go with you as far as you can take me but when you can't take me no further I have another [Applause] physician and it's the word because that's what I'm living by I'm living by the word now it sounds great but when that's the only thoughts that are in your mind you clear every other thought out of there every other logic every other scenario every other voice no matter how they spin it no matter how they paint it no matter how they point it out how much real and logical their explanation looks if God didn't say it it's a lie because if you're living by the word you know that man lives by every word that proceed us out of the mouth of God and let God every word of God be true and every word of man be alive so now you're living by the word this is what the mature maturity that God was looking for we love the blessing of the spirit we love the gifts operating in our midst we love praising God I don't care if you do five laps around the church in two minutes but live the word don't jump any higher than you live don't shout any other than the words that are proceeding out of your mouth that's what he's looking for he's looking for the faith that people live by the word okay God has showed it to you right the whole church is built on Revelation right Peter Flesh and Blood have not revealed this to you but my father has revealed to what was that the word what was he he was the word he was the son of God God revealed to Peter that Jesus was the son of God it was in his heart he saw it he believed it and he lived by it where should I go Lord thou alone has the word words of eternal life what else am I going to feed on what else have you ever even thought in your mind of going someplace else that doesn't preach this message I mean I mean if you I probably shouldn't say it but if if you went online and and pulled up some of these Services of Kenneth Hagen and and and uh brother Browning and and and and some of these guys were I mean people are falling on the floor laughing and they're sliding out of their their benches and they're they're dancing I there's one one guy gets and I'm sure he's filled with the spirit you know he just running and he dances and he's comes running down the aisle just a dancing and jumps up and stands on the pulpit and he's up on the pulpit you know uh we got dance frof right up here it it'll bust but and and you think well that's wonderful but if it doesn't profit a man anything if his thoughts and his leadership isn't the word if he's looking for that Spirit to lead him right then Satan can impersonate any gift of God there's one thing that Satan can't impersonate and that's the word because there's no truth in him he's a liar and the father of all lies so anything that you believe that and live by that not the word it's almost a lie so we don't judge any of those things as long as the life lines up with the word that's all we live by the word of God so I just like to read a statement so just a a couple of wonderful things he says and he's he's he's talking about uh you know the church re says now there was a Believer because he seen it he believed it and was fully persuaded that thou art the Christ the Messiah the word of God for this day and we believe that now that's a real believer he's talking about Peter th art the Christ so now because he accepted that word he now was a participant in The Exodus from the law to Grace come on now now he wasn't going to live by the rules no more the washing of pans the wearing of this the wearing of that he wasn't going to live under the rule of the flesh that kept telling him he was a sin but now he realized that thou art the Christ the kinsman redeemer now I can have your spirit and live by Grace because he saw that word and lived by it he participated in the Exodus of coming out just like Moses when he saw that burning bush right and he got those Commandments and he started Living by what that bush told him right and then he went into Egypt because he was living by that word he threw his stick down because the word said so right amen those guys threw their sticks down he could only do one thing right all he e was be still he didn't go back and question God God why did you make me a fool they were all sitting there and going cheap musicians trick yeah we can do that too that ain't nothing just stood there why he's living by by the word yes sir God didn't give him another line yes he didn't give him another action he didn't have plan B we don't have plan B we got plan a no no we don't have plan a we have plan W that's what we live by plan W word says it I do it and the Prophet told me if I take that word to be still and know that he's God all I got to do that's why I love that film so much he he's there and he talks about it and all all these great preaching and he says oh you know I'm going to go over to uh Africa in a few T days and I'd sure like you all to be uh praying for me and uh let me tell you about this life that was in the uh cancer and it goes up and it swells up and and and then he he says you know I'm waiting for something father if I said anything to offend you and then that head rolls back like that and he looks up and he looks out at the audience and he says he's here I take every spirit in this building and my control in the name of Jesus Christ do you think there was a spirit in that building that wasn't under his control why he stood there didn't come up with another program the angel of the Lord told him to go there preach the gospel that he would be with them and nothing would stand in his way not even cancer that he would know the thoughts and intents of the heart of the people that he could take them by the hand and know what was diseased in that hand and he lived by it he lived by the first pole the second pole and third pole he lived by the word that was revealed to him then he gave that word to us because the word of God comes to a prophet so that we could live by it and have the same results living by the word of God to live by the word of God is to get rid of every other thought every other idea how many times do we hear our messenger say you don't have a thought coming it's not a rebuke us he's telling us something stay with it stay with the word Abraham stood with it you know stick with it God tells you to do something prophet of God said if God told you thus sayith the Lord he said you move on it quick don't you hesitate one minute you go do it because you know what'll happen the inspiration will die and it it seasonal when it's spoken you got to go when God shows you the word live it act on it be don't put a plan out don't you don't need to do nothing you you you know how I loved how he sent those disciples out okay you guys want to join this church sell all that you have and give it to the poor and come follow me that's what they did that's what Anis ananas and saf is all about they held back some money instead of moving on the word of God and they're manifesting the spirit of ananas and saf instead of full obedience to thus sayith the lord they're so spiritual on that they can't run it back through the word of God and live what the word of God says the word of God does not fail amen there's only one immutable truth that God canot lie so if he said it he'll take care of it you don't have to take care one thing for yourself he said if he send you he's obligated to take care of you you're not obligated to take care of yourself you're not obligated to make plans you're not obligated to know what yesterday is you're not obligated to build your nest and all that you do what God says to do God will be fantastic cuz our God's awesome and people that live his word be and take those exceedingly great and precious promises now become partakers of divine nature what that notice they now have divine nature in them think of it isn't that what we're striving for to come to the full maturity of that seed that can give life out only one way to do it not religion not service live the word live the word anyway he he says this here he said he's talking about Abraham right 65 years going to the doc doc you still holding that hospital open it makes you act funny your decisions are odd to the world but it's believer no matter how strange it seems the Bible said that he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he said he would do pully fully persuaded not a make believer you know I better get my ducks in a row and you know no no you know could you imagine Sarah trying to look younger and you know going out to the teenage store and an old granny walking around in young kids clothes and you know try not wanting to have a spare tire on her head and we're going to have a baby but look what God did turned him young again he's got a plan for those that keep his listen what he said that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon God is able to keep every word that he said he'd do end the story God said I am the Lord that health all thy diseases I'm God and I cannot change you can live by it because he doesn't change he doesn't fail that's that's that's what he's trying to achieve our messenger cried to us over and over again back to the word back to the word back to the word believe the word that's why you've got to get in your Bibles and read it and I'm I'm going to close but I I I I just wanted to to to talk about job I like what he said here he said he said job went through the trial and the test his children taken everything else taken the church members come and accused him of being a secret Sinners and tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had meant God's requirement what did he do he went and he killed the sacrifice he laid his hands upon it he did exactly what the word of God said he knew that that his sins were transferred to that and that he had meant God's requirement and he knew that every good and perfect gift comes from the father father above and God tempteth no man and he even said we are not tempted above that which we're able so when you feel that temptation is pushing you to that Brink to give in go back to the word and said the word says that I have the ability in me now I might have to pray and find it I might have to give a or two I might have to spend some time in my closet but I've got the ability cuz he said so and I can live by [Applause] it we are way too me of worthy people he said those disciples were men of few words they just lived they just lived what they did you look back over their lives and they just lived and that's what job did listen to this this is beautiful I know I read I can't get over it he said he met GRE Rus he know there was no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped why why did he know it wasn't God because it was contrary to the word not to the circumstance okay not to the picture that the preachers were drawing you're a secret sinner we know you've got something he never accepted it and that's what youve got to do you've got to stop and listen to what's in your head because the word of God told us that's where the battle is and the greatest weapon that he gave us was what his word live by the word it'll defeat Satan any time any place anywhere in any in circumstance it is what God gave the believer to live by praise God it's simple it's simple just do what he said believe what he said he had meant the requirements he believed what he said he did it and then he makes statement it says nobody can take your place no matter how little you are in other words I've got word to live did remember our Prophet talked about the little spring and the watch or the little Jewel how important it was to making the whole thing work we got to live by that the word of God says you're fools to compare yourselves one with another what is it to you if he terries till I come follow th me see this is your thinking this is your actions this is what you're living by you're living by the word this is what God want his bride to come to of people that didn't move until they had thus saith the Lord the word the word oh I hear our Prophet saying it over and over again it's the word it's the word what was he trying to sell us it's the mind of Christ it's the victory of the church it's reality it's truth I am the resurrection and the life no man cometh to me but by the father and our Prophet always put that and he was the word amen when do you start living by the word right now you leave those things which are behind behind and you press for the higher calling that's the word you've got to learn to take that word and live by it I'm leaving those things which are behind behind I'm pressing for the high car I didn't leave the word yester yesterday so what do we do we cry Aba father we confess our sins our sins go before us right red meats Red is thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more you got to live by that Satan's the accuser of the Brethren who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God remains in them God's not looking for some sort of fantastic that's right he's not looking for some kind of fleshly manifestation he's looking for word delers word livers it's all he wants people that live by the word am no matter how little they are no matter how unnoticed they go one of the most unnoticed people in all of Israel is spoken of All Through Time because she threw three little mites in a basket think of it she lived the word she wanted to do her part in the time of giving didn't have to be a lot but oh what a glorious testimony and what did Jesus say he said wherever the gospel is preached this will be mentioned so I know I'm preaching the gospel because I mentioned it Hallelujah I'll take it wherever I can get it it's the word church it's the word you've got something to do God's got something for you to do that's the word and I'm going to close there I wanted to go take take you over here to Matthew 5 and start reading the scripture let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in Heaven live it it's the word right you can he says over here he said if you have odd against your brother okay or you feel your brother has odd against against you leave your gifts at the altar and go first and reconcile yourself with your brother and then come and offer thy gift that's the word agree with thy adversaries quickly he goes down there ye have heard that it was said of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say un you whosoever lookth after a woman and lust after her but I said you live by that it controls your eyes it controls your thought he said a Son of God turns his head that's right he fights it off he he you know and he just there's so many things but I say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it's God's Throne neither by Earth for it's the foot stol neither by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great king neither shalt that swear by thy head because thou canest make one hair white or black I did not make my hair gray he did it so I accept it and I didn't lose a one he knows where every one of them's at I'm trying to encourage us we can live by this word we can live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth we can do everything that he he says to do if every if a man sues you for your coo give him your cloak also that's living by the word of God that thy alms that they may be in secret that the Father which is in secret himself shall reward the open L you live by that right when thou prayest go into thy closet shut the door okay you live by that you know be therefore liken un don't be not therefore liken unto them for the father knoweth what things you have need of before you even ask him just think you can live by that Lord I'm pouring my heart out to you I feel I need this I feel I need that I this I I'm under so much weight but you said you know what I have need of and the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord but thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and wash thy face let not let not up yourself yeah lay not up for yourself Treasures on Earth where moth th rust and corrupt and where the thieves break in and steal but lay yourselves Treasures in Heaven anybody laying Treasures in Heaven he said do do good works lay for yourself a pattern of good works that men might see your glory do you have a Salvation plan do you have a a a life plan you have your goal to get to heaven live the word I guarantee you if you take these scriptures and you start living them you'll be there you'll be there cuz you're manifesting everything that he said that he he he is and you could just even just read the Beatitudes and and go blessed art the meek blessed art and you can take all those scriptures all those says that Paul said and you can actually live this word today you believe it amen Abraham believed it David believed he could slay Goliath because he knew he was the king of Israel he knew it Samson knew it Gideon knew it Samson knew it just one more time lord what did he went back he went back to the word that he was called to do and that was slay Philistines and when he got all repented out he said Lord avenge my eyes and he went over to those two pillars he was the great big muscle bound guy and he went over there and the spirit of the Lord come on him and he grabbed those pillars and he brought down the whole place on the pagan gods that were mocking him because when he lived by the word the word's Victorious the word is your power the word is your strength the word is your Victory the word is everything that you you are put yourself back into the mind of Christ let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus let every man look on the needs of the the others before his own let this mind let this word live in you God bless you let's

now he can't live without her can you imagine that anyway we tried to talk him out of it but there's just no way he said if you don't do it I'll get somebody else that's a Believer right there that's what I like anyway so after that we don't know what we're doing but normally I would just go and I say I'm not going to preach anywhere I'm not going to see no Believers but this time I the Lord opens the door or gets me to find a Believer to fellowship with I'm just going to approach it with a different attitude so if you'll uh pray for me on this little trip and that God will make it just what I need and and if I can be of any service to him uh we'd like to do that then we're trying to pray about a trip to Zambia uh later after the summer maybe stop in and see some friends in Cape Town and uh we don't know what that trip will do but I'm so grateful with the ministry that we have here at the church to stay with the word of God and maybe give me a little freedom to do some of the get some of the burdens off my heart that I've carried for years and this place was a burden we're just about finished with that place and you guys will have a nice place and and good Ministry and good Fellowship good deacons trustees and you you're in good hands cuz it's the holy spirit that was given to lead the church and and we'll carry on if the Lord would take me I believe the word of God carries on if you'll keep me here but I know one thing if God wants me here there's not enough sickness or Devils to take me right and if God wants to take me there's not enough medicines and doctors to keep me here I want to live by that it's the word of God God bless you go in peace keep us in prayer thank you very much God bless you [Music] [Music] for [Music]
