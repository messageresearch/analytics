[9:22] Jerome, if we could just come and open
[9:24] our service tonight. Amen. So good to be
[9:26] gathered in his presence. Amen.
[9:29] [Music]
[9:35] Let us go to God in prayer. Heavenly
[9:37] Father, we thank you once again for the
[9:39] opportunity to be assembled in your
[9:42] presence, Lord God. This has been a
[9:44] great day, Lord God, that the Lord has
[9:47] made and we will be glad and rejoice in
[9:50] it. Lord, we want to thank you for just
[9:53] being God all by yourself. For meeting
[9:56] every one of our needs, Lord God, when
[9:58] mother and father forsake us, the Lord
[10:02] will lift us up. We thank you, Lord,
[10:04] that in the midst of all our trials and
[10:07] all our tribulations, you have been God
[10:10] all by yourself. Lord God, we're so
[10:12] grateful, Lord God, for an opportunity
[10:14] to be assembled in your presence, Lord
[10:17] God. We live in the last and evil days,
[10:20] Lord God, when men's hearts are waxing
[10:22] cold. I'm so grateful that you placed a
[10:25] desire within my heart to be found in
[10:28] church. Lord God, there are so many
[10:30] other places I could have been and
[10:32] things that I could have done, but I
[10:34] know it's only by the grace and the
[10:36] mercy of God that I'm assembled here,
[10:39] Lord God. I once walked in darkness,
[10:42] Lord God, but you showed me a marvelous
[10:45] light, Lord God. I pray even now, Lord
[10:48] God. As the brother said this morning, I
[10:50] don't understand your word, but I
[10:52] believe it, Lord God. And I don't know
[10:54] why you've opened my eyes and opened my
[10:57] ears to hear and to see what thus sayeth
[11:00] the Lord. I'm believing by faith that
[11:02] I'm your bride. I'm believing by faith
[11:05] that heaven is my home. I'm believing by
[11:08] faith that I'm assembled with believers
[11:10] of like mind and like passions. Lord
[11:13] God, I pray for the man of God tonight
[11:15] and for the word of God that it would be
[11:17] ministered and blessed in such a mighty
[11:20] way. So often, Lord God, we don't read
[11:23] our Bibles. So often, Lord God, we don't
[11:26] listen to tapes. But even now, Lord God,
[11:29] we'll assembled here to hear from
[11:31] heaven. And we pray and ask in the name
[11:33] of Jesus that you would open up a window
[11:36] and pour us out a blessing that we won't
[11:39] have room to receive. In Jesus name we
[11:42] pray. Amen.
[11:44] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Welcome you
[11:47] back in the house of God. Amen. You may
[11:49] turn around and welcome someone tonight.
[11:52] Amen.
[11:55] [Music]
[12:02] And let's sing meeting in the air. You
[12:04] may have your seats. Amen.

[12:17] the B rush.

[12:29] Joseph

[12:40] the Bible.

[46:26] [Music]
[46:38] Amen.
[46:39] You know, you think about it, what it
[46:42] would like to be in slavery. You know,
[46:45] every morning somebody telling you right
[46:47] where to be and whipping you with a whip
[46:50] and keeping you from everything you'd
[46:53] want to do and then one day you're set
[46:56] free
[46:57] and you can go where you want to go and
[47:00] do what you want to do. And you know,
[47:04] it's it's sad how people won't go free.
[47:07] They have freedom, but they don't know
[47:09] free life.
[47:11] When when they
[47:14] let the Jews were were liberated
[47:17] from the concentration camp for years
[47:21] afterwards, they lived in those very
[47:24] same camps
[47:25] because they didn't have no place to go.
[47:28] Aren't you glad you've got a place to
[47:30] go? Amen. Some of you can go to someone
[47:33] that'll lead your path. Some of that'll
[47:36] provide for you so you don't have to
[47:39] stay right where you're at. Don't be a
[47:41] Johnny Crow where you only go so far
[47:44] when the the whole the whole heavens
[47:48] little flock. It's the father's good
[47:50] pleasure to give you the kingdom. It's
[47:52] all yours. Once again, we're privileged
[47:55] to have brother George with us tonight
[47:56] and we won't waste any time. would just
[47:59] turn the service over to him and and uh
[48:03] ask him to share with what's on his
[48:05] heart tonight. I couldn't get him to
[48:07] sing for us. He says he starts squeaking
[48:10] now when he used to really be able to
[48:12] sing, but maybe we'll work on that. When
[48:16] I was young, like the lady there, I
[48:18] could sing that song, but not today.
[48:21] Thank you. Thank you. You may be seated.
[48:24] It's good to be here tonight and to
[48:28] fellowship on the word of God.
[48:31] And um we're going to take a break from
[48:34] the book of Acts
[48:36] and go in another direction. But before
[48:39] we get into the lesson tonight, we just
[48:43] want to take a few minutes
[48:46] to um
[48:49] make it plain that God's word comes in
[48:52] sections.
[48:53] We're living in the seventh church age
[48:56] and there's a message for us. But
[48:59] throughout history
[49:02] there's a um
[49:05] how does this work?
[49:08] Um
[49:13] so throughout history, God has used
[49:16] some ministries over and over again.
[49:20] Used Moses a couple of times. But
[49:23] there's one ministry that he used five
[49:24] times throughout history.
[49:27] Elijah.
[49:29] And there's only the bride members and
[49:31] the people of Israel that understand
[49:33] Elijah because they studied him from the
[49:37] ground up from from a child. They're
[49:39] studying about Elijah and what he was
[49:43] and the way he was. And so when it comes
[49:47] to, you know, what we believe,
[49:50] uh, there's a similarity, you know,
[49:55] so Elijah was first mentioned in the
[49:57] Bible
[49:59] because our Bible is of utmost
[50:01] importance. First of all, don't ever
[50:03] think that, well, it's just another
[50:05] book. No, this is the word of God.
[50:08] And such that brother Brandham said, you
[50:11] never put anything on top of your Bible.
[50:14] not even my books," unquote, which there
[50:18] wouldn't mean many books back then
[50:19] anyway, but uh this is God's word. And
[50:23] you know, it's a marvelous book because
[50:27] it was written by 40 different authors
[50:30] writers only one author, Jesus Christ,
[50:32] but the 40 uh writers
[50:35] lived on three continents, spoke three
[50:37] different languages
[50:39] over a period of 1500 years.
[50:42] impossible to make something like that
[50:44] work even with computers and AI and
[50:47] everything else. But um it all points to
[50:50] one person, Jesus Christ.
[50:53] So when Jesus came, they only had the
[50:56] Old Testament. Everybody understand
[50:58] that? New Testament wasn't written till
[51:00] years later. So they only have the Old
[51:02] Testament and it's their Bible until
[51:06] today only. And um it was a translation
[51:09] of the Hebrew text which was actually
[51:12] 200 years uh previous to Christ. And so
[51:16] this is what the the disciples read.
[51:18] That's what they believed and even Paul.
[51:21] But Elijah is the only one in the Bible
[51:24] God uses five times. And um so today
[51:30] they're waiting for him. the the the
[51:33] genuine Jews believe
[51:36] that Elijah will show up first. They
[51:40] know the Messiah is coming. They're very
[51:42] aware any time now. And u and so but
[51:47] they say but first we'll see Elijah.
[51:50] He'll either be right beside him or two
[51:52] steps in front of him. You know, so his
[51:55] name means God is Jehovah.
[51:59] Elijah is first mentioned in first Kings
[52:01] 17:1. He was a dweller of uh Gilead. Uh
[52:06] he was a Tishbite. Tishp is the town
[52:08] where he came from. Now these are all
[52:11] facts. We went over there one time, had
[52:13] some time, hired a driver, took us over,
[52:15] and here's here's Tishp where Tish was.
[52:17] It's just some rocks now, but um it's on
[52:22] the other side of the river Jordan. It's
[52:24] the first mention of him. He was a man
[52:26] of the wilderness. He was rough and a
[52:31] person that was totally obedient to God.
[52:33] Okay. And um everyone that
[52:38] followed the other four that followed
[52:40] Elijah were the same characteristics.
[52:42] Very interesting. Each one was a
[52:44] prophet. Each one believed and
[52:46] participated in the supernatural and
[52:49] they worked miracles and God backed them
[52:50] up. So that's Elijah. Then there was
[52:53] Elisha. Now, why are they very similar?
[52:55] I don't know.
[52:58] And you'll find Brother Brandham
[52:59] sometimes putting one for the other, but
[53:01] he knew the difference. I got a friend
[53:03] in where's he at? In um
[53:07] I think he's in Argentina. Anyway, so
[53:10] his mother solved the problem. She
[53:11] called him Elijah. Elisha. That's his
[53:14] name.
[53:16] But Elisha comes along. He was anointed
[53:18] by Elijah. And that's in First Kings
[53:21] chapter 19.
[53:23] And um then we have John the Baptist,
[53:26] but he's announced in Malachi 3. So we
[53:29] got Elijah first kings, got Elisha, 2
[53:32] Kings. In Malachi 3, John the Baptist is
[53:35] is announced, you know, another
[53:37] appearance of Elijah. And uh he's
[53:40] prophesied 400 years before Jesus came
[53:42] on the scene. But in Malachi 4, chapter
[53:45] chapter 4:es 5 and 6, there's two people
[53:48] there. And it's cleared up in in Luke
[53:52] 1:13 by the voice of the prophet by
[53:56] angel Gabriel
[53:58] 13-20.
[54:00] And Jesus clearly identified him in
[54:02] Matthew 11:10, Mark 1:2, and Luke 7:27.
[54:07] And uh these writers were looking at it
[54:09] from different angles, but they were
[54:11] saying the same thing. But there's this
[54:14] there's a fourth Elijah mentioned right
[54:16] there at at the end of the New Testament
[54:18] of the Old Testament
[54:20] um in the last part of Malachi 4:6
[54:24] which will turn the heart of the
[54:25] children back to the fathers. There's
[54:27] obviously two people that he's talking
[54:29] about you know and so for each
[54:32] expression of these prophets there's got
[54:34] to be a fulfillment somewhere.
[54:36] Jesus himself spoke over in Matthew 17
[54:40] in verse u 10 where he said over here in
[54:43] verse 11 they're coming down from the
[54:45] mountain
[54:47] and Jesus answered and said to them
[54:48] Elijah truly shall first come and
[54:50] restore all things okay that's future
[54:54] okay they should but the the disciples
[54:56] are like some of us a bit thickheaded
[54:59] you know but I say unto you that Eli
[55:02] that Elijah has already come and he
[55:04] switches gear on him
[55:06] and uh they knew him not, but have done
[55:09] unto him whatsoever they uh you know
[55:12] desired. Likewise shall also the son of
[55:15] man suffer of these same people. And the
[55:17] disciples understood that he spake of
[55:19] them of John the Baptist. And that's as
[55:21] far as everybody goes, but he's speaking
[55:24] of something else. Now,
[55:28] um Dr. Scoffield was a lawyer and then
[55:31] he got into the Bible and he didn't have
[55:34] a computer only pen and p paper pencil
[55:38] and yet he figured out all these these
[55:40] cross references and everything and his
[55:43] work was finished by January 1, 1909.
[55:46] Okay, way back there. And he says down
[55:49] here of those verses we just read, all
[55:53] the passages must be construed together.
[55:55] One, Christ confirms the specific and
[55:59] still unfulfilled prophecy of Malachi 45
[56:02] and 6. H Elijah shall truly first come
[56:05] and restore all things.
[56:08] Why didn't I see that when I was a kid?
[56:10] It's in every B all the Baptist churches
[56:12] have the same Bible.
[56:14] But anyway, we are living in the time of
[56:17] the fulfillment of the fourth Elijah.
[56:21] So the fifth Elijah is in Revelations
[56:24] 11:3-13
[56:26] and they are over there waiting for him
[56:29] any day now. It's prophesied that he
[56:31] would come and nobody can change it. No
[56:34] matter what your theology is, it won't
[56:35] change and he'll be like the other four
[56:39] lover of the wilderness and so forth. So
[56:42] God knows what he's doing. He doesn't
[56:44] need our help. He doesn't need our
[56:45] opinions. But I just want to leave that,
[56:48] you know, in concrete. the five
[56:50] comingings of Elijah. But tonight, we're
[56:52] going to look at another subject here.
[56:56] Jesus and three women. Now, some of you
[56:59] probably heard that before, but some of
[57:00] you weren't here and some of you weren't
[57:01] paying attention. So, we're going to go
[57:02] over it again. Okay. So, scripture
[57:05] records, and we're going to look into
[57:07] where's it at? Luke chapter 8 to begin
[57:09] with. Luke chapter 8. Very
[57:14] uh
[57:16] wonderful scripture here where Jesus is
[57:18] ministering
[57:20] Luke 8 verse one. And it came to pass
[57:22] afterward after all these things in
[57:24] verse chapter 7 that he went throughout
[57:27] every city and village preaching and
[57:30] showing the glad tidings of the kingdom
[57:32] of God. And the 12 were with him. So we
[57:35] got 13 people. Okay. Verse two. and
[57:39] certain women which had been healed of
[57:42] evil spirits and infirmities such as
[57:44] Mary Magdalene, out of whom went seven
[57:47] devils. Yeah. And Joanna the wife of
[57:52] Chusa Herod Steward and Susanna and many
[57:55] others which ministered unto unto him of
[57:58] their substance. So we have a little
[57:59] group of about 20 people going from
[58:01] village to village preaching, praying,
[58:04] you know, covering the the land of
[58:06] Israel.
[58:08] Scripture records that many women follow
[58:11] Jesus.
[58:12] Some are named, many are not. Okay? And
[58:16] thank God we have a Bible with details.
[58:18] You just got to get in there and read
[58:20] it. You can't put it under the pillow.
[58:22] Maybe it'll come in by osmosis. No, it
[58:24] doesn't work. You got to read the Bible.
[58:26] Okay? So, God has sent us a restoration
[58:28] prophet as we just read in Matthew 17.
[58:31] And um he's come to to make it real to
[58:34] us, okay? bring us back to the original
[58:37] faith, the original word. And we have a
[58:40] sure word of prophecy. It's not stories.
[58:42] It's not fables. It's reality. Okay? The
[58:44] truth of God. So God does not say, you
[58:47] know, let's try this and what what do
[58:50] you all think about it? That's not the
[58:51] way God operates. No, God operates this
[58:54] will work. You know, so God is perfect.
[58:57] He knows everything from the beginning
[58:59] to the end.
[59:01] And he's always very well balanced. You
[59:04] can count on that. I'm not making it up.
[59:06] It's just the facts.
[59:08] Yeah.
[59:10] See, I always check the pulpit. See if
[59:12] it's balanced first.
[59:15] But um women did not commonly travel
[59:19] with uh a rabbi, which is a religious
[59:21] leader. Okay? They had very strict codes
[59:24] of conduct back then that put a distance
[59:26] between women and the Jewish leaders. So
[59:30] much so that by the time Jesus came
[59:32] along, a rabbi was not even allowed to
[59:34] speak to his wife in public. Yeah, she's
[59:37] back there about maybe 10 steps and
[59:39] everybody knew that was his wife, but
[59:41] there was no communication. Okay, so
[59:44] these Jewish religious laws were put in
[59:48] place to to ensure moral purity. But
[59:52] just like then, like today, there's no
[59:54] such law. It doesn't work, you know. So
[59:57] the Jewish men in general and the
[59:59] teachers of the law in particular such
[1:00:02] as Jesus, the Pharisees, those that knew
[1:00:03] their Bible, uh they were to have to as
[1:00:06] little to do with women as possible.
[1:00:09] But then Jesus came on the scene,
[1:00:11] started ministering, fulfilling the
[1:00:13] scriptures. Remember, we got a perfect
[1:00:15] book.
[1:00:17] And um but there's only one author.
[1:00:20] So not only did Jesus speak to women in
[1:00:24] public, but he took them by the hand.
[1:00:29] And so he encouraged them to follow the
[1:00:32] truth. That's why we have women here,
[1:00:35] you know, to follow the truth. And
[1:00:38] there's no indication that Jesus ever
[1:00:40] discouraged women from being his
[1:00:43] followers. And it's probably just hit
[1:00:46] the Jews the wrong way. We have these
[1:00:48] laws. Now you come along and and you're
[1:00:50] doing this different. They couldn't
[1:00:51] handle the changes. So many people are
[1:00:55] offended in the 21st century
[1:00:57] when God blesses one of our ladies, you
[1:01:00] know, and they have an idea or they want
[1:01:02] to teach the Sunday school, whatever
[1:01:04] they're doing, and you better watch it.
[1:01:06] Relax. God is in control, you know. So
[1:01:11] balance is not an option. It is
[1:01:13] essential, you see. So when you read the
[1:01:18] New Testament, you will find women
[1:01:20] listen very carefully to his teachings.
[1:01:23] Uh they accompanied him accompanied him
[1:01:25] on his travels.
[1:01:27] Who was standing by at the crucifixion?
[1:01:30] The women
[1:01:32] in John. Where was the rest of those
[1:01:34] mighty warriors? The man with the keys.
[1:01:37] Over there in the shade someplace.
[1:01:39] Wonder if this is really going to work
[1:01:40] out, you know.
[1:01:43] And the women was the ones that gave
[1:01:45] witness to the resurrection. They're the
[1:01:47] ones that ran to tell the others. So
[1:01:49] they eventually helped spread the
[1:01:50] message throughout the Roman world.
[1:01:52] Okay. Now in those days
[1:01:56] and some of this of course is you know
[1:01:58] not plain in the scripture but we can
[1:02:00] imagine that in those days there was a
[1:02:03] godly family that followed prophet Moses
[1:02:06] very close repeated his words. They
[1:02:10] studied his his uh his teachings and so
[1:02:12] forth. They learned to quote his words.
[1:02:14] They were walking the truth that they
[1:02:16] knew. and they had several children.
[1:02:19] Okay.
[1:02:21] But one of the girls in the family began
[1:02:24] to look at popular fashions, maybe wear
[1:02:27] a little different shoe than what she
[1:02:29] was supposed to, and um began hanging
[1:02:32] out with some of the friends that were
[1:02:34] not quite as well-versed in the word.
[1:02:36] And they begin to fill her head with
[1:02:38] worldly things very different from the
[1:02:41] teaching she had at home. and Satan
[1:02:43] drove a wedge
[1:02:45] separating her from the truth. So she
[1:02:49] began to walk another path. What a girl
[1:02:52] in a godly family. Okay. And this might
[1:02:55] have gone on for several years. But one
[1:02:57] day, John chapter 4, this is case number
[1:03:01] one.
[1:03:04] In John chapter 4,
[1:03:08] we have the case of what we know as the
[1:03:11] woman at the well. We don't know her
[1:03:13] name, but almost every recording,
[1:03:16] Brother Miranda mentions her,
[1:03:18] and she's over there waiting for us.
[1:03:22] John 4:3,
[1:03:26] he left Judea and departed again into
[1:03:29] Galilee. So, he's going north, okay? and
[1:03:33] he must need to go through Samaria, you
[1:03:34] know. And there came and they came to a
[1:03:38] city of Samaria called
[1:03:41] um called Saikar near to the parcel of
[1:03:44] ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph
[1:03:47] and that's where Jacob's well is. Okay.
[1:03:50] So he's going he had to go there because
[1:03:53] the father had already showed him uh a
[1:03:56] vision. Now Jerusalem to Saikar is about
[1:03:59] 32 miles. Verse six.
[1:04:04] Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus
[1:04:07] therefore being weary from his trip from
[1:04:09] his journey sat down next to the well
[1:04:12] and it was about the sixth hour. And
[1:04:14] we're not going to argue about what time
[1:04:15] it was but the prophet said it was about
[1:04:17] noon. He was very hungry from the from
[1:04:19] the journey. Verse 7. And there came a
[1:04:22] woman of Samaria to draw water. And
[1:04:25] Jesus all of a sudden said to her, "Hey,
[1:04:28] I need a drink."
[1:04:30] didn't waste any time about who you are,
[1:04:32] who's your dad, and all this stuff. I
[1:04:34] need a drink. Now, it's about noon. He's
[1:04:38] tired. He's hungry, weary from his trip.
[1:04:41] And uh he knew the rules. It's not a
[1:04:44] problem. He didn't he wasn't ignorant.
[1:04:47] Uh but he knew exactly what he was
[1:04:49] doing. Now the honorable women such as
[1:04:52] you all would have come in the early
[1:04:53] morning or in the evening because it's
[1:04:56] hot just like it is here today 90° in
[1:04:59] the shade. So the honorable women go up
[1:05:02] when it's cool you know common sense or
[1:05:04] they come in the evening
[1:05:06] and uh but the troublemakers you know
[1:05:08] those other people they had to come in
[1:05:10] the heat of the day maybe 100 110
[1:05:12] degrees in the shade. Now, these other
[1:05:15] people weren't necessarily the poor
[1:05:18] people, but this woman is a prostitute.
[1:05:21] She's a marked prostitute, okay? Because
[1:05:24] she went away from the teaching of the
[1:05:26] home. She got involved with these other
[1:05:28] people, and she's drifting over in this
[1:05:30] direction. And we don't know how long
[1:05:32] she was there, but she was on this
[1:05:34] journey, okay? And she comes out in the
[1:05:36] middle of the day.
[1:05:38] And so the disciples, you know, supposed
[1:05:40] to be watching after the master. They
[1:05:42] had gone in town to get some food and he
[1:05:45] was there alone.
[1:05:47] And yes, they had segregation. Verse
[1:05:49] nine,
[1:05:51] then saith the woman of Samaria. Okay,
[1:05:53] now he's already asked for a drink. And
[1:05:54] then she says, "How is it that you being
[1:05:57] a Jew
[1:05:59] ask of me a drink? I'm a woman of
[1:06:01] Samaria. For the Jews have no dealings
[1:06:04] with Samaritans." Hm. Strict
[1:06:08] segregation. You're there. I'm here. You
[1:06:11] see, but Jesus was the one that served
[1:06:13] as a bridge.
[1:06:15] Now, before you go to sleep, I already
[1:06:19] see somebody over there.
[1:06:22] Okay, wake up. You don't want to come
[1:06:25] down there.
[1:06:27] But um the fact is that Jesus came to
[1:06:30] open a new way. Okay? And everyone was
[1:06:34] welcome to participate. It's open for
[1:06:36] everybody. You know, the door swings
[1:06:38] open all the time here. Everybody's
[1:06:40] welcome here. Church is like a hospital.
[1:06:43] Nobody's checking papers at the door.
[1:06:45] Come in free. But the word will decide
[1:06:48] who gets to stay and who's got to leave.
[1:06:52] And so this turned the world upside
[1:06:55] down. The bridge is described very
[1:06:57] accurately in John 3:16. Plain gospel
[1:07:00] truth no matter who repeats it. For God
[1:07:03] so loved the world. How much? So loved
[1:07:06] the world. Everybody's welcome. Yeah. No
[1:07:11] discrimination with God. You know, he
[1:07:14] freely gave his only begotten son. And
[1:07:16] that bridge is the gap between sinful
[1:07:19] mankind and a holy God. There's got to
[1:07:21] be a bridge someplace. So the bridge is
[1:07:24] available to all, not just the white
[1:07:26] people, the black people, Latinos,
[1:07:28] Chinese, whatever. It's open to
[1:07:29] everybody. No. And uh but not all
[1:07:32] believe.
[1:07:34] Why don't we have 500 people packed in
[1:07:36] here tonight? Now, I want to do I want
[1:07:38] to give you a real pat on the back that
[1:07:40] some of you came back without asking for
[1:07:42] gas and food and shelter because you
[1:07:45] took away all the the Yeah. But you
[1:07:48] know, he took all that away, but you
[1:07:50] came back to hear the gospel. So
[1:07:54] not all believe. So it becomes a it
[1:07:56] becomes a narrow path very quickly that
[1:07:59] whosoever that's anybody that believes
[1:08:01] in him should not perish but have
[1:08:04] everlasting life. And then it goes on to
[1:08:07] say in verse 17, for God sent not his
[1:08:10] son into the world to condemn the world.
[1:08:12] He didn't come with a club to beat on
[1:08:14] everybody,
[1:08:15] but that the world through him might be
[1:08:17] saved. His mercy extends to everybody.
[1:08:22] He that believeth on him is not
[1:08:24] condemned. But he that believeth not,
[1:08:27] you know, can't believe is condemned
[1:08:30] already because he hath not believed
[1:08:32] what? In the name of the only begotten
[1:08:35] son of God. And that's the that's the
[1:08:37] theme throughout all the book of Acts
[1:08:40] is the name. They were thankful that
[1:08:42] this man's healed or that whatever
[1:08:44] happened, but just don't use that name
[1:08:47] because thousands are flocking to it.
[1:08:50] So this way, you know, the way, the
[1:08:52] truth, and the life, this way is only
[1:08:55] for serious believers, only people that
[1:08:57] will drop everything and come to church
[1:08:59] Sunday night. It's not for doubters.
[1:09:01] It's not for mockers. It's not for
[1:09:03] agnostics, not for people on the
[1:09:04] internet. No, it is not a game. And this
[1:09:07] is not a religion. This is not like the
[1:09:10] Baptist Church over there or any place
[1:09:11] else. This is life. You see, it's the
[1:09:15] only path to eternal life. It all begins
[1:09:18] at the foot of the cross. Now, the
[1:09:20] prophet says over here in 1954, Jesus
[1:09:23] Christ came on the earth and he talked
[1:09:25] to a woman at the well, which was a
[1:09:27] Samaritan, him being a Jew, just a
[1:09:30] different in race. And he let her know
[1:09:32] right quick, there's no difference in
[1:09:34] the races. God was seeking those that
[1:09:36] would worship him in spirit and in
[1:09:38] truth. Yes, they had segregation, no
[1:09:42] dealings, no fellowship, but Jesus was
[1:09:44] the bridge. You see?
[1:09:47] Okay. Chapter 4:10.
[1:09:50] And Jesus said unto her, so she he's
[1:09:52] already asked for drink. Then she comes
[1:09:54] up with this argument, you know, hey,
[1:09:55] you over there, leave me alone. And
[1:09:57] Jesus said, if you knew the gift of God
[1:10:01] and who it is that saith to give to me,
[1:10:03] you know, give me a drink. You would
[1:10:05] have asked him and he would have given
[1:10:08] you living water. She had never heard
[1:10:11] that before. What in the world are you
[1:10:13] talking about? you know, and he went on
[1:10:15] extending the conversation about the
[1:10:17] water, discerning her uh very
[1:10:22] interesting case. And then finally she
[1:10:24] responds down here in 15, the woman said
[1:10:26] unto him, "Sir, give me this water that
[1:10:30] I thirst not." So she kind of got a
[1:10:32] little revelation there. Well, if you
[1:10:35] got this water, give it to me. I I'm
[1:10:37] tired of coming out here, you know, and
[1:10:40] don't have to come out here to draw. And
[1:10:43] so, uh, then he got straight to the
[1:10:45] point. Okay, enough about water.
[1:10:48] Um, he says here in 16, "Go call thy
[1:10:51] husband and come here." Now, what's that
[1:10:54] got to do with the water?
[1:10:57] Well, we're talking to the son of God.
[1:10:59] You know, he he knows what he's talking
[1:11:00] about. And so, our sister was probably
[1:11:04] very beautiful. Now, the gentleman that
[1:11:07] sang a while ago, he's kind of got his
[1:11:09] eye on that little girl. looks like
[1:11:11] she's about 13 years old, right? She's
[1:11:13] really 21.
[1:11:15] So, so he chose a beautiful girl. Nobody
[1:11:18] chooses ugly girl, right? She's always
[1:11:21] the last one on the line. So, this girl
[1:11:23] here was probably very beautiful. She
[1:11:25] had no trouble attracting men.
[1:11:28] She just had a problem keeping the man,
[1:11:31] you see, and she was thirsting, but she
[1:11:34] didn't know how to satisfy that godly
[1:11:36] thirst. See, nothing else will satisfy
[1:11:39] nothing. only the presence of the living
[1:11:42] God.
[1:11:44] Now, our pastor was late at lunch today
[1:11:47] because he was dealing with some people.
[1:11:48] They were hungry for God. They want to
[1:11:50] know more about it and and he's telling
[1:11:52] them so something is stirring in them.
[1:11:55] They just need more of the living water,
[1:11:57] you know. And so, um so she had had five
[1:12:01] husbands.
[1:12:03] Now, there's no need to argue about it.
[1:12:04] Look, I talk to people all the time and
[1:12:06] there's some people that I'm probably
[1:12:08] going to see soon. Well, they she really
[1:12:10] was wasn't married to them. No, she was.
[1:12:12] Says right here. You had husbands. You
[1:12:14] had a contract. You broke it. They left,
[1:12:16] you know, five times. And uh the one she
[1:12:20] had the night before uh you know, she
[1:12:23] was attracted to this last one, but she
[1:12:25] wasn't too sure about him. That's on
[1:12:28] tape, too. So, verse 17, let's say say
[1:12:32] here, "And the woman answered and said,
[1:12:34] I have no husband." And Jesus said, "You
[1:12:37] have said, 'Well, I have no husband
[1:12:39] because you had five, you were married
[1:12:42] to five different men,
[1:12:44] and um he whom thou now hast is not thy
[1:12:48] husband."
[1:12:50] And um so you've told the truth. So So
[1:12:54] where where to you know where to stand
[1:12:57] still here?
[1:12:59] He says, "Go get your husband." Hey, who
[1:13:01] you think you're fooling with? I don't
[1:13:03] have a husband. Yeah, you're telling the
[1:13:04] truth, honey. You've had five. And the
[1:13:06] one you got last night, he's not yours.
[1:13:08] So you're telling the truth. You have no
[1:13:09] husband. Okay.
[1:13:12] So verse 19, "And the woman said unto
[1:13:14] him," sir, I perceive that thou art a
[1:13:16] prophet. H
[1:13:19] I wonder why. So she goes into her
[1:13:23] declaration of her beliefs in verse 20
[1:13:25] and the differences. when he spoke to
[1:13:27] her telling her things of her past,
[1:13:30] the details,
[1:13:32] she was probably very uncomfortable,
[1:13:35] you know, and she immediately went on
[1:13:38] the defense, her ideas of race,
[1:13:41] religion, because the Samaritans were
[1:13:43] experts on going on defense. Now, I run
[1:13:47] into people all the time, what was it
[1:13:48] like being around Brother Brandham?
[1:13:50] Well, it was very natural because he was
[1:13:52] the father of the girl that I loved. you
[1:13:54] know, he wasn't, you know, pointing out
[1:13:55] all my mistakes all the time,
[1:13:59] but yeah, I wish I could have been there
[1:14:01] and pointing out your mistakes
[1:14:04] and and how sorry you treated your wife
[1:14:06] this week and how you didn't pay taxes
[1:14:08] last year or whatever. No, it'd get
[1:14:11] uncomfortable. And here he's telling
[1:14:13] this woman, you know, about the fact
[1:14:15] that she had five and the one you got.
[1:14:17] So, she's very uncomfortable.
[1:14:20] So, the Samaritans were experts on
[1:14:22] defense. You see, nearby where they're
[1:14:24] where they were standing, uh, was Mount
[1:14:26] Ebal, Eb. That's where Moses commanded
[1:14:29] them to build an altar celebrating the
[1:14:31] Israelites entering into the promised
[1:14:32] land. Also on Mount Ebal, is where
[1:14:35] Joshua renewed Israel's covenant with
[1:14:36] God in Joshua chapter 8. But the
[1:14:39] Samaritans, for whatever reason, believe
[1:14:42] that this other mountain over here,
[1:14:43] Mount Garrettsim, was the only true
[1:14:45] place of worship. So that's their, you
[1:14:47] know, that's their go-to place. So they
[1:14:50] built an altar there in 400 BC. But 272
[1:14:53] years later, the Jews destroyed that
[1:14:55] altar, adding enmity between the two
[1:14:58] groups. So they're they're fussing all
[1:15:00] the time. And so the woman at the well
[1:15:02] had her ammunition ready and she used it
[1:15:05] to challenge Jesus.
[1:15:07] You're telling me about my past? Hey, I
[1:15:09] got something to say, too. But he calmed
[1:15:11] her down to verse 21.
[1:15:13] And Jesus said,"Woman,
[1:15:16] believe me, the hour is coming when ye
[1:15:19] shall neither in this mountain nor at
[1:15:23] Jerusalem worship the father. You all
[1:15:26] worship what you know not." In other
[1:15:28] words, you know,
[1:15:31] um,
[1:15:32] we know what we worship, for salvation
[1:15:35] is of the Jews.
[1:15:38] And the hour is coming and now is when
[1:15:40] the true worshippers shall worship the
[1:15:42] father in spirit and in truth. Okay,
[1:15:46] that's where this comes in. It can be a
[1:15:47] lot of spirit or it can be a lot of
[1:15:49] truth, but it's got to be balanced.
[1:15:51] Spirit and truth. Very important.
[1:15:56] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:15:57] him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:16:00] truth. If you didn't catch it the first
[1:16:01] time. Okay. 25. And the woman said unto
[1:16:05] him,"I know the Messiah is coming. You
[1:16:09] we know that which is called the Christ.
[1:16:12] When he has come, he will tell us all
[1:16:14] things."
[1:16:16] So she had some truth up there in the
[1:16:18] head. And Jesus said,
[1:16:22] "I that speak unto thee am he. I am
[1:16:25] here."
[1:16:27] This is one-on-one. It's not a
[1:16:29] congregation. One-on-one, you know. So
[1:16:32] the fact is that she had paid attention
[1:16:34] back home
[1:16:36] in their Bible classes. Now we're not
[1:16:38] going to call it Sunday school because
[1:16:39] that wasn't invented till 1750.
[1:16:41] So some truth had lodged in her memory.
[1:16:45] She had been a long time on this detour.
[1:16:46] We don't know how long. All she needed
[1:16:49] was an encounter with the fountain of
[1:16:51] truth. She had a correct spirit.
[1:16:54] She did not reject truth. Okay. But she
[1:16:58] was on the defense. Sure. anybody would
[1:17:00] be. So her spirit was right. She needed
[1:17:03] more truth. She had representation in
[1:17:05] heaven.
[1:17:07] She was an elect seat of God
[1:17:10] just like you are, you know. And once
[1:17:13] she got a small drink of that special
[1:17:15] water, it was all over. She became an
[1:17:19] overcomer.
[1:17:21] She didn't have to sit, you know, and
[1:17:22] study the scrolls for three years. No,
[1:17:25] immediately
[1:17:26] when the blood of Jesus Christ now over
[1:17:28] here, of course, he hadn't died yet, but
[1:17:29] when you come in contact with truth,
[1:17:33] something happens. You know,
[1:17:37] Brother Ram says in thirsting for life,
[1:17:39] just take a drink from there, from the
[1:17:41] everpresent water. You'll never have to
[1:17:43] hear another sermon on morals, how to
[1:17:46] dress, how to act, how to conduct
[1:17:47] yourself, because you've arrived. It
[1:17:50] takes care of all that, you see.
[1:17:54] But friends, you have to participate.
[1:17:56] You can't just come here and soak up the
[1:17:58] air conditioning. You got to
[1:17:59] participate. You got to be responsible.
[1:18:02] So, we got too many people that hear the
[1:18:04] word, they hear the tape playing, but
[1:18:06] they never participate. They're not a
[1:18:08] part of the picture. Yeah, we went to
[1:18:10] church. Really? Why you dressed like
[1:18:12] that? You did go to church, you know.
[1:18:15] So, they don't actually participate.
[1:18:17] They don't take responsibility for
[1:18:19] manifesting what they hear. Because you
[1:18:22] see, your life speaks louder than your
[1:18:24] words.
[1:18:26] You know, we all got the magic thousand
[1:18:29] phone and we can blah blah blah blah
[1:18:31] blah. But what about your life?
[1:18:35] You see, uh I've mentioned this before,
[1:18:38] but I only come by every year or two, so
[1:18:40] it's okay to repeat because some of you
[1:18:42] weren't even here last time. But you see
[1:18:45] there was a preacher 900 years ago. His
[1:18:48] name is Francis of Ais. He's a saint in
[1:18:50] the Catholic church. Oh, they got a
[1:18:52] saint for everything, you know, for the
[1:18:53] throat, for the head, for the ears,
[1:18:54] whatever. But um brother Ram said he was
[1:18:58] a preacher of the gospel.
[1:19:00] And he said, "Preach always. Use words
[1:19:04] when necessary."
[1:19:06] Yeah.
[1:19:08] So your life preaches when you walk out
[1:19:11] here and and you come to the first
[1:19:12] stoplight and when you go to McDonald's
[1:19:14] or wherever you go your life is
[1:19:16] projecting something you know so you
[1:19:19] preach everywhere preach always use
[1:19:21] words only when necessary when they ask
[1:19:23] a question okay so after she
[1:19:26] participated after she accepted and
[1:19:29] understood didn't take three months or
[1:19:31] years it was instantly the woman at the
[1:19:33] well was instantly turned into a lady a
[1:19:36] lady with something to tell. Okay. She
[1:19:39] took one drink from the inexhaustible
[1:19:41] fountain of living water. One drink is
[1:19:44] over. Okay.
[1:19:47] The prophet says over here in a man
[1:19:49] running from the presence of the Lord.
[1:19:51] This is February of 65 and he's praying.
[1:19:54] Now, let me just give you a little
[1:19:56] background on that particular message
[1:19:57] that you might be interested in.
[1:20:00] This is the first
[1:20:02] uh of five messages when he went back to
[1:20:04] Jeffersonville to preach on marriage and
[1:20:06] divorce. He been promising people for a
[1:20:08] long time. Yeah, we'll have a message on
[1:20:10] that.
[1:20:12] So, he's living in Tucson. He drove
[1:20:14] right through here, maybe through
[1:20:16] Oklahoma City. And when he was driving
[1:20:20] by himself, he didn't stop at the hotel.
[1:20:23] He'd stop in the shade maybe at night
[1:20:25] whenever he got tired, sleep for 20
[1:20:27] minutes and move on. So he arrives in
[1:20:30] Jeffersonville
[1:20:31] uh very early on Wednesday morning.
[1:20:37] Well, the services don't start till
[1:20:38] Thursday night Thursday, Friday,
[1:20:40] Saturday, and Sunday. Four services.
[1:20:42] It's in your phone.
[1:20:45] But he's there early Wednesday morning.
[1:20:47] People are a lot of people already
[1:20:48] gathered there. So he's thinking, well,
[1:20:52] I can't just sit up here at the house
[1:20:53] and go down there and get some
[1:20:54] inspiration from the people. So he goes
[1:20:57] down there. Well, here's church full of
[1:20:58] people and brother Neville saw him
[1:21:00] coming in. Oh, brother Bill, come on.
[1:21:03] He's got nothing. He's not prepared for
[1:21:06] for preaching. But he preaches that
[1:21:08] mighty message, a man running from the
[1:21:10] presence of the Lord.
[1:21:12] And in prayer, he says here, "Let the
[1:21:15] great Holy Spirit that came down on the
[1:21:17] mountain the other day in Tucson
[1:21:19] saturate every heart in here with his
[1:21:22] goodness and mercy with understanding."
[1:21:24] We realize, Father, that's what we need
[1:21:26] is to understand for if we do not know
[1:21:29] what we're doing, then how do we know
[1:21:31] how to do it? Great question. But we
[1:21:34] must have understanding. As Daniel said,
[1:21:37] he had understanding by the prophet
[1:21:38] Jeremiah's writing. And father, we have
[1:21:41] understanding by the Holy Spirit's
[1:21:43] writing as he will reveal it to us in
[1:21:45] this hour.
[1:21:47] He will reveal what you need, what you
[1:21:49] can handle at the hour you need it. He
[1:21:52] doesn't give you the whole thing at one
[1:21:53] time. You know, so over here in 2025,
[1:21:58] those that love the Lord Jesus, now
[1:22:00] that's not everybody, but the ones that
[1:22:01] love the Lord Jesus have understanding
[1:22:04] by the words of Prophet William Brandom.
[1:22:07] Because the scripture says in the days
[1:22:09] of the voice. That's these days. Okay?
[1:22:12] And it's the only one of the messengers
[1:22:13] that says in the days of the voice. The
[1:22:15] others are writing. So the true minister
[1:22:18] of God today says what has already been
[1:22:21] said. Not a private interpretation. I
[1:22:24] think and I figured out none of that
[1:22:25] nonsense. No, just let it live out
[1:22:28] naturally.
[1:22:30] So the message of William Brandham is
[1:22:33] the amplified version of the scriptures.
[1:22:36] Okay.
[1:22:37] So the woman at the well was case number
[1:22:39] one. She came in contact with the author
[1:22:43] of life. She took one drink of the water
[1:22:46] of life and instantly turned into a
[1:22:49] lady. And then she ran and told others.
[1:22:51] She wasn't preaching. She was just
[1:22:53] testifying.
[1:22:54] She got into action and it was too much
[1:22:57] to keep to herself. She had to share it
[1:22:58] with others. Does everybody understand?
[1:23:01] Okay. Case number two. John chapter 8.
[1:23:08] We might get out early tonight. Depends
[1:23:09] on customers attitudes.
[1:23:13] John chapter 8 verse one. Jesus went
[1:23:17] unto the Mount of Olives. What's he
[1:23:19] doing on the Mount of Olives? Huh? Good
[1:23:21] thing you got asked. And early in the
[1:23:23] morning, he came again to the temple,
[1:23:26] and all the people came unto him, and he
[1:23:28] sat down and taught them. Now, that's a
[1:23:30] very broad statement. See, it wasn't all
[1:23:32] the people. It was a group of believers.
[1:23:34] Okay? It wasn't the whole town.
[1:23:38] So what's he doing on the Mount of
[1:23:39] Olives from chapter 7 verse 53 right
[1:23:43] above it? And every man went unto his
[1:23:46] own house. But guess what? Jesus didn't
[1:23:48] have a house. So he went to the Mount of
[1:23:50] Olives. It's still there today. Back
[1:23:53] then it was all olives, olive trees. Um
[1:23:58] today it's big cemetery. And so um he
[1:24:03] spent the night at the Mount of Olives
[1:24:05] because they all went to their house. He
[1:24:06] went to the Mount of Olives. Verse two,
[1:24:09] early in the morning he came again to
[1:24:11] the temple. Okay. So you think he was
[1:24:13] sleeping under the trees? No. No.
[1:24:17] There's a cave over there
[1:24:20] u on the Mount of Olives that was just
[1:24:23] found about 200 years ago. And so
[1:24:25] wherever there would be olive trees,
[1:24:28] there's got to be an olive press. They
[1:24:30] didn't have transportation to carry the
[1:24:31] olives to the factory. No. So, wherever
[1:24:34] there's trees, there's got to be a place
[1:24:35] to to mash them and get the oil. And
[1:24:38] this is where it was. Well, so and also
[1:24:42] in um John 18, it mentions it also. So,
[1:24:45] they went over there. They slept in this
[1:24:47] little cave. Now, the next day, he he
[1:24:49] walks 600 yards back over to the temple.
[1:24:52] Okay. Now, here's Jesus early morning,
[1:24:56] maybe just right after sunup. He's
[1:24:58] sitting down teaching a large crowd of
[1:25:01] uh people there in the temple grounds
[1:25:03] because it wasn't church like this. The
[1:25:05] temple itself was is very small. Only
[1:25:08] the priests went in there. People are
[1:25:09] out there in the courtyard, you know,
[1:25:11] the parking lot. So, he's out there
[1:25:13] teaching the people. And all of a
[1:25:15] sudden, a group of very proud and
[1:25:18] arrogant Pharisees, all men,
[1:25:22] um they appear and they're dragging this
[1:25:23] woman by the arm
[1:25:26] very tightly. Her hair wasn't comb. She
[1:25:28] wasn't dressed well. And they interrupt
[1:25:31] him. It's all right there in your Bible.
[1:25:33] And they put her right in the center.
[1:25:35] And they pose a very loaded question to
[1:25:37] the master. And they probably each had a
[1:25:40] few rocks in their pocket because they
[1:25:42] were going to participate and fulfill
[1:25:43] the prophet's words. Okay. Verse four
[1:25:48] says here,
[1:25:50] "And they said unto him, master, this
[1:25:52] woman was taken in adultery in the very
[1:25:54] act." Now, we don't have to make that
[1:25:57] too much plainer. They drag her out of
[1:25:59] the bed.
[1:26:01] Okay. Verse five.
[1:26:04] Now, our prophet Moses in the law
[1:26:08] commanded us that such a person should
[1:26:10] be stoned. What do you say? They're
[1:26:13] trying to catch him, trying to make him
[1:26:15] look small. Well, if they had a half a
[1:26:17] brain, they would have known that the
[1:26:19] Moses said, "Bring both of them." So,
[1:26:21] they're only half right.
[1:26:24] just, you know, pointing out the facts
[1:26:25] here. And so they're trying to make
[1:26:27] Jesus look bad. He acts like he doesn't
[1:26:30] hear him. Uhhuh. So he goes down, he
[1:26:33] starts writing in the sand. Now, they
[1:26:35] think he's down there looking for a rock
[1:26:36] to help him, you know, but he's just
[1:26:39] writing in the sand. And um uh they he
[1:26:43] he could hear what they're saying. When
[1:26:45] they finish talking and accusing, he
[1:26:48] raised up. He looks around. He says, "I
[1:26:51] tell you what, boys. the one of you
[1:26:53] that's without sin, throw the first
[1:26:54] rock.
[1:26:56] Oh yeah, I did something wrong last
[1:26:59] week. So, you know, he gives him
[1:27:02] permission and he went down and started
[1:27:04] writing again and he erased it all. I
[1:27:08] got to say that because there are people
[1:27:10] that somehow they think that you can
[1:27:11] still find that over there.
[1:27:14] All the showbread in the temple, that's
[1:27:16] all gone. All that stuff is gone. It's
[1:27:17] been thousands of years. Okay. So when
[1:27:21] he uh went down and wrote again and he
[1:27:25] told them, you know, the one of you
[1:27:27] that's without sin, throw the first
[1:27:28] rock, with those words, they began to
[1:27:30] slip away. Everyone very quietly, we got
[1:27:33] a hot potato here. We better leave it
[1:27:35] alone. Yeah. What's it say in verse 9 of
[1:27:38] chapter 8? And they which heard it, you
[1:27:41] know, the bad boys, being convicted by
[1:27:44] their own conscience,
[1:27:46] went out one by one, beginning at the
[1:27:48] eldest, even to the last. And Jesus was
[1:27:51] left alone and the woman standing in the
[1:27:53] midst. Of course, there's still these
[1:27:55] believers that he was teaching there.
[1:27:56] You know, verse 10, when Jesus um had
[1:28:00] lifted up himself and saw none but the
[1:28:03] woman, he said,"Woman,
[1:28:05] where are your accusers?
[1:28:08] Uh, has nobody condemned you? And she
[1:28:11] said, "No, man, Lord." And Jesus said
[1:28:13] unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go
[1:28:16] and sin no more."
[1:28:18] Now, this is a very different day for
[1:28:21] this woman. She's another prostitute.
[1:28:23] She's been in bed. They drug her out and
[1:28:26] now she's set free. Wow. So, by
[1:28:29] discernment, he was able to see her
[1:28:31] entire life. Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:28:34] Go and sin no more. So once again, a
[1:28:37] woman received life from the lifegiver.
[1:28:40] It turned her into a real lady all of a
[1:28:42] sudden and she went away to live a new
[1:28:45] life. But you see, history repeats.
[1:28:49] Religious leaders, people that knew the
[1:28:51] letter of the law, precise keepers of
[1:28:54] the prophetic words, and I've dealt with
[1:28:56] these people for 50 years. No, he said
[1:28:59] 'the' twice, not once. I mean, very,
[1:29:02] very picky. and they lose sight of the
[1:29:04] big picture, you know. So, they they
[1:29:07] were keepers of the prophetic word. They
[1:29:09] had a lot of truth, but they had no
[1:29:11] spirit. It didn't do anything for them.
[1:29:14] And so, in fact, they had a very bad
[1:29:15] spirit. Arrogant, selfish, full of
[1:29:18] pride, demeaning, always pointing the
[1:29:21] finger at somebody that wasn't obeying
[1:29:23] the rules the way they thought they
[1:29:24] should be. You see, the very epitome of
[1:29:27] arrogance.
[1:29:29] So our prophet said,"I would rather be
[1:29:33] wrong in my doctrine, you know, but
[1:29:36] right in my heart than to be right in my
[1:29:38] doctrine and wrong in my heart."
[1:29:42] Now let that sink in. It's very
[1:29:43] important. Attitude is everything. You
[1:29:46] can have it all by memory. I know people
[1:29:49] that can quote the whole book of
[1:29:51] Hebrews. Why? We got right here written.
[1:29:54] But what what's it done for you? I mean,
[1:29:57] I run into people all the time,
[1:29:59] preachers and whoever, and they got some
[1:30:01] things figured out and they can prove by
[1:30:03] all these quotes. Okay, that's what it
[1:30:05] says. But what's it done for you? What's
[1:30:08] Malachi 4 done for you? It has set us
[1:30:11] free. We're part of the big picture.
[1:30:15] So, right doctrine will not necessarily
[1:30:17] bring you to the right spirit, but the
[1:30:19] right spirit will always bring you to
[1:30:22] the right doctrine. Yeah. The truth. So
[1:30:26] spirit and truth must be a balance.
[1:30:28] Okay.
[1:30:31] The tape is called early experiences
[1:30:33] 1952 July. Now some people when they get
[1:30:36] born again they sit right in the middle
[1:30:38] of the road eyes on Christ. Here's the
[1:30:40] cross right here. Finally they get over
[1:30:43] here so much knowledge and wisdom. Oh
[1:30:45] they know it all. You don't know
[1:30:46] anything.
[1:30:48] And if they don't do that they run off
[1:30:49] to the other side. Bunch of wildfire
[1:30:52] fanaticism. That's right. But right in
[1:30:54] the middle of the road, there's the
[1:30:56] true, sound, unadulterated gospel and
[1:30:58] power of God. Balanced.
[1:31:02] So, we have to find that balance. How
[1:31:05] are we going to find the balance in our
[1:31:07] Christian life? You come here, you know,
[1:31:09] three times a week, the faithful, and
[1:31:11] you know, you're out there in the world.
[1:31:13] Okay, there's four simple steps that
[1:31:15] every person here can follow starting
[1:31:17] tonight.
[1:31:20] You read one chapter out of your Bible.
[1:31:23] Don't read the same chapter tomorrow.
[1:31:25] Read another one. These are minimum. At
[1:31:27] least one chapter. You read one page out
[1:31:30] of your church age book and never hurt
[1:31:32] anybody. Okay? You listen to at least 30
[1:31:35] minutes of God's prophet and you pray
[1:31:38] every day. That's from the oldest till
[1:31:41] the youngest. If you follow those four
[1:31:43] steps, you will come into a balanced uh
[1:31:46] life and you'll have a a blessed life.
[1:31:50] So recently back well when he was still
[1:31:54] alive Pope Francis said we have to find
[1:31:56] a new balance. What are you talking
[1:31:58] about? See it sounds good sounds
[1:32:00] compassionate. You know God loves
[1:32:02] everybody but this balance we need is in
[1:32:05] God's unchanging word. That's where
[1:32:07] we're going to find balance. So we got
[1:32:09] to balance our our experience with the
[1:32:11] scriptures. Not with some personality
[1:32:13] but what David said sort. No with
[1:32:16] scripture.
[1:32:17] So everything you do or say is governed
[1:32:20] by a spirit either God or Satan and you
[1:32:22] have a choice. Okay. So as we see Jesus
[1:32:26] 1957
[1:32:28] he says you follow the scriptures and
[1:32:30] see if the spirit follows the scripture.
[1:32:31] Any spirit that does not follow the
[1:32:33] scripture is a wrong spirit.
[1:32:37] Oh very plain
[1:32:40] scripture alone. That's right. If it
[1:32:42] goes beyond this Bible it's wrong
[1:32:44] spirit. If it doesn't get to it, it's
[1:32:46] wrong spirit. It's got to match the
[1:32:48] scripture.
[1:32:50] Okay,
[1:32:52] we'll go to case number three. Case
[1:32:54] number three, Luke 7.
[1:32:57] Um, we're back kind of where we started.
[1:33:00] In Luke 7, Jesus is preaching. He's
[1:33:03] praying for the sick and a runner comes.
[1:33:06] Why? Because they didn't have cell
[1:33:08] phones.
[1:33:10] No. You wanted somebody to know
[1:33:12] something in Fort Worth, you had to go
[1:33:13] over there and tell them.
[1:33:15] It's just that simple. So this runner
[1:33:17] comes with a personal engraved
[1:33:19] invitation
[1:33:21] to give to Jesus. He had to find him,
[1:33:22] give him the invitation because over in
[1:33:25] in Jerusalem, there was Simon the
[1:33:27] Pharisee, very religious, keeping all
[1:33:30] the details of the law, very pious. He
[1:33:33] was preparing a great feast. Okay? And
[1:33:36] he invited Jesus. Jesus said, "We'll be
[1:33:38] there." Yeah, we'll come. No problem. So
[1:33:41] Jesus arrived on time. He's a gentleman.
[1:33:45] Uh but he was not welcomed. We got a
[1:33:47] problem. So he's sitting, you know, at
[1:33:50] the end of the table over there by
[1:33:52] himself. And um the aroma of the of the
[1:33:55] grilled meat was going out over the
[1:33:57] walls cuz it's it's it's outside, you
[1:33:59] know, and the wall had some cracks in
[1:34:01] it. And people going by and spying, wish
[1:34:03] we could get in there. And so the aroma
[1:34:06] is going out and uh prophet said there's
[1:34:09] enough meat there to feed the whole
[1:34:10] village. But people passing by, you
[1:34:13] know, hungry, wishing. And um one
[1:34:16] insignificant woman was passing by. She
[1:34:18] smelled the roast lamb and she looked
[1:34:21] through one of the holes in the wall and
[1:34:24] she's looking at the meat and she's
[1:34:25] looking at the all the people. He saw
[1:34:27] Jesus over there by himself. H how could
[1:34:30] this be?
[1:34:32] And he had dirty feet. People notice
[1:34:35] everything.
[1:34:37] Don't be falling asleep yet because I
[1:34:38] might come down there and whack you on
[1:34:39] the head with this thing.
[1:34:43] Send big boy. Yeah.
[1:34:46] But um so people notice everything.
[1:34:49] Look, I was over in I've been in the
[1:34:50] Congo several times now. This is a small
[1:34:53] church compared to there. Yeah. I was in
[1:34:56] this church and there was at least 5,000
[1:34:58] people. I was the only white guy. Okay.
[1:35:01] Kind of stood out. And so
[1:35:05] And so I I finished speaking and the
[1:35:08] pastor jumps up real quick. He says,
[1:35:10] "Now, we don't know when George is
[1:35:11] coming back. Does anybody have any
[1:35:13] questions?"
[1:35:15] You can imagine
[1:35:17] they're in no hurry to go any place. You
[1:35:19] know, 5,000 people and there's 10 cars
[1:35:21] outside and uh probably u you know, 300
[1:35:25] motorcycles and about 500 bicycles.
[1:35:28] Everybody else walked. So they're in no
[1:35:30] hurry to leave. So they start asking
[1:35:32] questions and you know in French and I'm
[1:35:35] giving it or could have been shona or
[1:35:37] whatever it was and so or lingala and so
[1:35:40] I'm giving them the answer and then it's
[1:35:41] got to be translated. Well this all
[1:35:43] takes time. Well the only question I
[1:35:45] remember this woman wrote up a question.
[1:35:48] Well since the Lord took your wife why
[1:35:50] you still wearing the ring.
[1:35:52] Boy guys notice everything you know. I
[1:35:55] said, 'Well, because I have an agreement
[1:35:57] with Rebecca that it's not just until
[1:36:00] death do you part, but it's forever. Oh,
[1:36:03] okay. So, but they notice everything.
[1:36:05] So, these people, here's this woman.
[1:36:07] She's looking through and she saw Jesus
[1:36:09] over there.
[1:36:10] Ah, and she saw he had dirty feet. Okay,
[1:36:14] how's this possible? She had heard about
[1:36:17] her friend up at the temple area in case
[1:36:20] number two and Jesus forgive her and her
[1:36:23] lifestyle changed completely. She turned
[1:36:25] into a lovely lady. So she had heard now
[1:36:28] she's seeing
[1:36:30] and uh so she got into action. Well, she
[1:36:33] thought this is my only opportunity.
[1:36:35] This is never going to come around
[1:36:36] again. And so she ran home and she got
[1:36:40] under the mattress and got the money she
[1:36:41] accumulated. She was another prostitute.
[1:36:43] Sorry. and she got this money out and
[1:36:46] she thought, I'm going to go down. I'm
[1:36:48] going to buy this special ointment like
[1:36:51] a lotion. I'm going to go down. I'm
[1:36:54] going to I'm going to, you know, anoint
[1:36:56] Jesus' feet. So, she goes home. She gets
[1:37:00] her money. She runs down to the
[1:37:02] drugstore. And when the drugs are
[1:37:05] coming, he says, "What are you doing
[1:37:07] here?" "Well, I come to buy something.
[1:37:10] We've heard that you got a special
[1:37:12] alabaster box up there someplace with
[1:37:15] special ointment in it. Oh, honey, that
[1:37:18] costs money. Yeah, I've got the money.
[1:37:22] So, he counts it three times. You know,
[1:37:23] good shoe.
[1:37:25] Okay. Well, he's got to sell it to her.
[1:37:27] And so, she buys the ointment. And uh if
[1:37:31] you can put this picture up on the wall,
[1:37:33] it'd be nice so people could see. Now
[1:37:36] when we have pictures of the last
[1:37:39] supper, we have Jesus, you know, and the
[1:37:43] disciples sitting at at the table, you
[1:37:46] know, they they can like we do. But see,
[1:37:48] those paintings were made hundreds of
[1:37:50] years later by people in Italy. But the
[1:37:53] fact is at that time
[1:37:55] the the table was that height. That was
[1:37:57] the level of the table.
[1:38:00] And so they had pillows or carpet or
[1:38:02] something. So they're down here on the
[1:38:04] ground and they're they're eating like
[1:38:06] this.
[1:38:09] Feet are behind them. Now you might have
[1:38:11] never thought that but that's the way it
[1:38:14] was. Okay. And so the woman, she's going
[1:38:18] to wipe his feet. She's going to, you
[1:38:20] know, anoint his feet. And it says right
[1:38:23] here in verse 39 of chapter 7,
[1:38:28] let's find it here.
[1:38:30] Um
[1:38:34] 38 and stood at his feet behind him
[1:38:36] weeping
[1:38:38] and began to wash his feet with her
[1:38:40] tears and did wipe them with the hair of
[1:38:43] her head. So she obviously had long
[1:38:45] curly hair, right?
[1:38:48] And she kissed his feet and anointed
[1:38:50] them with the ointment.
[1:38:53] 39 Now when the Pharisee that had
[1:38:56] invited him when when he saw this he
[1:38:59] said within himself
[1:39:01] this guy if he was a prophet he would
[1:39:04] know what kind of woman this is she's a
[1:39:06] sorry person and she's touching him
[1:39:08] she's a sinner
[1:39:11] and Jesus said hey Simon I've got
[1:39:14] something to tell you
[1:39:16] and he says master say on so he thinks
[1:39:18] he's going to get a blessing for all
[1:39:19] this money he spent on the meat you know
[1:39:22] Yeah, give me the blessing. And he says,
[1:39:25] you know, there was a certain guy that
[1:39:27] um a guy at the bank, he had two debtors
[1:39:30] owed one owed him 500 and the other owed
[1:39:32] him 50. And when they uh when they both
[1:39:35] had nothing, he gave he forgave both of
[1:39:37] them. Tell me uh Simon, which of these
[1:39:40] do you think loved him more? The one
[1:39:42] that he forgave for 50 or the one that
[1:39:45] he forgave for 500? So now all the eyes
[1:39:48] are on Simon. he's got to come up with
[1:39:49] the right answer because you know
[1:39:53] and Simon he finally said well I suppose
[1:39:57] uh that he to whom forgave the most
[1:40:01] and Jesus said to him that's right oh
[1:40:04] pressure's off I answered right you know
[1:40:09] and he turned to the woman
[1:40:12] so for the first time he's looking back
[1:40:13] at the woman
[1:40:15] but he's still speaking to Simon
[1:40:19] He says, "You see this woman? I came
[1:40:22] into your house and you didn't give me
[1:40:24] any water for my feet, but she's been
[1:40:26] washing my feet with her tears."
[1:40:31] That's why tears are important. When
[1:40:32] you're at this altar, you don't just
[1:40:34] come up here and I want to be saved and
[1:40:36] go home. No, there's more to it. It's
[1:40:37] got to be from the heart. Okay? And um
[1:40:41] you gave me no water for my feet. She's
[1:40:42] been washing with tears and wiping them
[1:40:44] with the hairs of her head. Wow. No
[1:40:47] towel. Uh, you didn't give me any kiss,
[1:40:50] but this woman has been kissing my feet.
[1:40:54] You know, back here behind me. Uh, you
[1:40:57] didn't give any oil. Uh, you didn't
[1:40:59] anoint my head with oil or anything.
[1:41:02] She's been anointing my feet with
[1:41:04] ointment.
[1:41:06] Therefore, I say unto thee, her sins,
[1:41:08] which are many. He knew who she was. He
[1:41:11] could discern her case.
[1:41:14] Now when she's doing this, he didn't
[1:41:17] move one half an inch. She stayed very
[1:41:20] quiet. Holy Spirit is very timid. And so
[1:41:25] uh she um she's doing all this. Uh he
[1:41:29] says her sins are forgiven which are
[1:41:31] many for she loved much but to whom
[1:41:34] little is forgiven the same loveth
[1:41:37] little which might have been Simon. We
[1:41:39] don't know but it's could have been. And
[1:41:43] he said unto her, finally he says
[1:41:44] something to her, "Your sins are
[1:41:46] forgiven." Wow. Her load is lifted.
[1:41:49] She's a new person. And they that sat at
[1:41:52] meet with him, all the visitors, began
[1:41:55] to murmur amongst themselves, who is
[1:41:57] this that forgives sin also.
[1:42:00] And he said to the woman, "Thy faith has
[1:42:04] saved thee. Go in peace." And that's why
[1:42:07] you come to church to hear those same
[1:42:09] words from God's word that you can go
[1:42:12] free. We're free. We're not carrying
[1:42:15] stuff anymore. You see,
[1:42:17] so Simon, this very important Pharisee,
[1:42:20] he had memorized a lot of truth. Yeah.
[1:42:22] If you look at Acts 15:21, they read the
[1:42:25] words of their prophet every service
[1:42:27] that they had. Moses, you know, they
[1:42:30] read every Sabbath. They memorized a lot
[1:42:33] of truth, but they had no revelation, no
[1:42:36] spirit. You can listen to the radio. I
[1:42:38] mean, this is one of the most gospel
[1:42:40] areas in the country. And you can listen
[1:42:42] to the radio and you'll hear them.
[1:42:44] They'll come down through Acts chapter 2
[1:42:45] and they they won't even mention that
[1:42:47] last part there, chapter, you know,
[1:42:48] verse 38. They'll just jump over. They
[1:42:50] don't want to get caught by a bunch of
[1:42:51] phone calls from you people. No, they
[1:42:54] have no revelation. You see? So the
[1:42:57] woman with all her baggage, she had the
[1:42:59] right spirit and that spirit led her to
[1:43:02] the truth. And Jesus said, "Thy faith
[1:43:04] has saved thee. Go in peace." She was
[1:43:06] completely changed. And God is still in
[1:43:09] the lifechanging business today. You
[1:43:12] don't have to go out of here. Oh, I'm so
[1:43:14] sick. Or I'm, you know, no, you can have
[1:43:17] peace. You can be free.
[1:43:21] Yeah, but I'm not as bad as those women.
[1:43:23] I didn't say you were.
[1:43:26] Now, all of you know somebody that's
[1:43:28] hooked on the drugs, right? So, it's
[1:43:30] vary in degrees. Well, I'm not as bad as
[1:43:32] that guy. You know, I only spend $50 a
[1:43:34] day. He spends 200. Well, you know,
[1:43:36] there's all kinds of degrees. You see,
[1:43:39] and and you you ladies might say, "Well,
[1:43:40] I live clean. I don't have those
[1:43:41] problems." But you see, if you do not
[1:43:44] come to the foot of the cross and begin
[1:43:46] your journey correctly, you will be left
[1:43:48] behind for the tribulation. Guaranteed.
[1:43:52] And it's coming quick. So the church is
[1:43:55] like a hospital, but it's free. The
[1:43:57] great physician is still in business.
[1:44:00] Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:44:02] and the life. All you have to do is say,
[1:44:05] "Yes, Lord. I will follow. I'll drop
[1:44:08] everything and follow you." And that's
[1:44:10] when you turn the corner.
[1:44:12] So these are only three examples of many
[1:44:15] that are in the scripture. Jesus had to
[1:44:17] deal deal with all kinds of people. And
[1:44:20] um
[1:44:22] you know we're dealing with humanitarian
[1:44:24] crisis in Venezuela for one place.
[1:44:27] People have nothing.
[1:44:30] If the tires wear out, who do you think
[1:44:32] they call? They they have no money. They
[1:44:34] have no system like we have, you know.
[1:44:37] So every day we're looking for for u
[1:44:40] food and clothes and shelter for for
[1:44:42] people. And some some need a place to
[1:44:45] sleep, some need tires on their car.
[1:44:47] Eternal life is living for others,
[1:44:50] not just for yourself.
[1:44:52] Because people, you know, in our
[1:44:54] country, they want to see how much how
[1:44:56] much bigger the bank account can be and
[1:44:58] want to feel comfortable.
[1:45:00] But when the dollar goes to zero, we're
[1:45:02] all in the same place. So, let's help
[1:45:04] those that we can help while we can. Now
[1:45:07] the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 10 um
[1:45:11] all these things happened unto them for
[1:45:13] examples and are written for our
[1:45:14] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:45:17] world are come.
[1:45:19] The ends of the world didn't come during
[1:45:20] his lifetime. This is for us today. You
[1:45:23] see we are the people of the end. We are
[1:45:27] the final generation upon whom the world
[1:45:29] the end of the world has come. And so we
[1:45:32] are the people that will see the
[1:45:34] rapture. There's people sitting here
[1:45:36] that will not see death. It's very, very
[1:45:39] soon. So, in closing, prophet Elijah
[1:45:43] says very clearly in choosing of a
[1:45:44] bride, paragraph 147, she woman
[1:45:50] was not in the original creation. I'm
[1:45:52] sorry ladies, but you're not original.
[1:45:54] You're a byproduct. And it's basic.
[1:45:57] All other females are in the original
[1:45:59] creation. The birds, the male, female,
[1:46:01] animals, male, female. But in human
[1:46:03] life, God only made a man and he took
[1:46:06] from him. And a woman is a byproduct of
[1:46:09] a man because God did not institute such
[1:46:11] a thing. Search the scriptures.
[1:46:15] He says, "God, no sir, in his original
[1:46:18] creation, she was put out there." But if
[1:46:21] she can hold herself right, now look,
[1:46:23] I've been dealing with brother Brand's
[1:46:25] words for 50 years. He says things like
[1:46:27] this, but if she can hold herself right
[1:46:30] now, to put that into Spanish to where
[1:46:31] it makes sense, you got to, you know,
[1:46:34] work with her a little bit. What he's
[1:46:36] saying, she's got to stay balanced. If
[1:46:38] she can keep herself balanced, you see,
[1:46:41] so if she can hold herself right, what a
[1:46:43] greater reward she has than a man. She's
[1:46:46] put on a testing ground. These are
[1:46:48] things that most churches don't want to
[1:46:50] hear about because it gets kind of
[1:46:52] tight. It's going to get a lot tighter,
[1:46:55] you know. So ladies, bride of Christ,
[1:47:00] um
[1:47:02] there is a great reward. We're on a
[1:47:05] testing ground. The bride in general is
[1:47:07] on a testing ground. And you ladies are
[1:47:09] on a testing ground. You see, living
[1:47:12] here in Leodysia.
[1:47:14] But the fact that God predestined you,
[1:47:16] predestinated you to live in this time
[1:47:18] is testament to the fact that he trusts
[1:47:20] you and you will overcome. You see? And
[1:47:24] so we must live in balance, truth and
[1:47:29] spirit. So remember, read your Bible
[1:47:32] every day, at least one chapter. Read
[1:47:34] one page out of your church each book.
[1:47:36] Pray at all times. And listen to the at
[1:47:38] least 30 minutes of God's prophet. As an
[1:47:41] individual, you will prosper. This
[1:47:43] church will prosper. And you will be
[1:47:45] balanced in spirit and in truth.
[1:47:48] Guaranteed formula.
[1:47:51] Any questions?
[1:47:55] May God bless you, brother David.
[1:48:06] Do you need that? Sure.
[1:48:11] Keep
[1:48:16] Oh, you got to do better than that.
[1:48:20] I I got my deacons. Oh, you got to
[1:48:24] It's nice to put those three stories
[1:48:27] together, huh? And see all the
[1:48:28] similarities. It let you know, you know,
[1:48:31] you should never judge anybody or never
[1:48:33] count anybody out. You know, you don't
[1:48:36] have to have somebody's history.
[1:48:39] You know, where you been, what you do,
[1:48:41] what you believe. You know, all you have
[1:48:44] to do is give them a drink of the
[1:48:45] fountain. They can see if you've got it
[1:48:49] and if you don't. They they sense your
[1:48:52] love. People know whether you love them
[1:48:54] or not, whether you care for them or
[1:48:56] not, whether you're sincere
[1:49:00] or not, you know, and you know, people
[1:49:04] will make all kinds of statements and
[1:49:07] they don't really care about you or
[1:49:09] anything. you know that you know but if
[1:49:12] you're really sincere in your heart and
[1:49:14] you're really convinced that what God
[1:49:18] did for you he can do for anybody
[1:49:22] and and that's the glory of this gospel
[1:49:25] is is I know that God saved me from a
[1:49:28] pretty dark place. So I don't care how
[1:49:32] dark a person is, how deep in sin they
[1:49:35] are, how far away from God there is. I
[1:49:37] know for a fact how far he went for me.
[1:49:41] And I I know that his hand is long and
[1:49:44] his mercy is great. And so we we really
[1:49:49] forget
[1:49:51] what it's not our doctrine that we're
[1:49:54] trying to get to people. It's the life
[1:49:57] that we receive from him that we're
[1:50:00] trying to share. Because you can, like
[1:50:03] you said, you can have all the doctrine
[1:50:04] down and not have a ounce of love in
[1:50:08] your heart and then all your doctrine is
[1:50:10] is condemnation. You know, you're always
[1:50:12] condemning people because they don't
[1:50:14] believe. But I've met down my life's
[1:50:17] road. Uh I remember I bought a new Bible
[1:50:21] and I had a a Baptist fell that preacher
[1:50:25] guy that lived up around the alley from
[1:50:27] me when I was in San Diego. And I really
[1:50:30] liked the guy because he was just got a
[1:50:32] good spirit, you know, and and uh he was
[1:50:35] a good good Baptist person and I just
[1:50:38] was a Christian. I didn't know the
[1:50:39] message. And he took my new Bible, my
[1:50:42] brand new Bible, you know, and he just
[1:50:44] grabbed it and he started wrinkling the
[1:50:46] pages. And I sitting there just, you
[1:50:49] know, my Bible. He says, "You know,
[1:50:52] they'll read better this way. They won't
[1:50:56] get stuck together.
[1:50:59] you know, and and and
[1:51:02] when I got done and I looked at it, it
[1:51:04] looked like it had been used in red and
[1:51:06] everything, and I saw this guy did this
[1:51:09] out of the genuine
[1:51:12] sincerity to make life easier for me.
[1:51:16] And you can't beat that. You know what I
[1:51:18] mean? And let me tell you, I I meet a
[1:51:21] lot of different people, a lot of
[1:51:23] different places, and I've met a lot of
[1:51:25] wonderful Christians that haven't had
[1:51:28] the privilege to see what I see.
[1:51:33] And I'm not counting them out.
[1:51:37] You know what I mean? They may not share
[1:51:39] the place in the kingdom that is set
[1:51:42] aside for me, but there's a lot of
[1:51:45] places up and down the side of that
[1:51:47] mountain. There's a lot of places there
[1:51:49] that God's got. And then another place
[1:51:52] he said, "All that you loved and all
[1:51:54] that loved you will be there."
[1:51:57] So, you know, don't don't start
[1:52:01] wondering, you know, you know, and
[1:52:05] trying to figure out who's in and who's
[1:52:08] not because the most religious people
[1:52:11] are the ones that fool you the most. the
[1:52:14] guy that sat in front of the temple and
[1:52:16] said, "Lord, I do all this for you and I
[1:52:19] do all that for you and and I've given
[1:52:22] to the poor and you know me and you are
[1:52:25] best buddies." And then here's some guy
[1:52:28] back in the back going May Koopa, you
[1:52:30] know, I'm a sinner. Lord, forgive me my
[1:52:32] sins. I'm not worthy. Hear me. I'm
[1:52:35] sorry. That's the one that got here. So,
[1:52:39] you know, really,
[1:52:42] you know, don't look at the symptoms.
[1:52:44] Just remember that if you're honest, you
[1:52:48] may not have been that way on the
[1:52:49] outside,
[1:52:51] but you were that way on the inside. And
[1:52:54] your thoughts and your your feelings and
[1:52:56] your attitudes and your judgments to
[1:52:59] other people, your hatred and and
[1:53:02] prejudices and all those things. You
[1:53:06] know, on the outside you might look like
[1:53:07] a saint, but God works from the inside
[1:53:10] out. And he judges a man's heart and and
[1:53:14] so, you know, it's so important to to
[1:53:18] stay in love with the Lord
[1:53:20] and and and let and that's what the Holy
[1:53:24] Spirit does. When you have the Holy
[1:53:26] Spirit, the love of God is shed abroad
[1:53:29] in your heart by the Holy Spirit. And I
[1:53:33] think if if we take this these ladies
[1:53:37] and no matter how dark they were and
[1:53:41] they're natural types, you know, worse
[1:53:44] than natural prostitution is spiritual
[1:53:46] prostitution
[1:53:48] because
[1:53:49] that's hard to detect.
[1:53:52] You know what I mean? And that it's very
[1:53:54] deceptive.
[1:53:56] But that but the willingness of the Lord
[1:54:03] despite their condition
[1:54:05] to give them a drink of water. And how
[1:54:09] many times we won't talk to a homeless
[1:54:11] person or we won't talk to somebody
[1:54:14] that's got tattoos all up. I always ask
[1:54:17] myself, you know, if I was confronted
[1:54:20] with some of those MS13 guys that, you
[1:54:25] know, are just spiderw webs over their
[1:54:28] eyes, you know, and and the scary as all
[1:54:31] get out looking whether my spirit would
[1:54:34] be composed enough to tell them about
[1:54:38] the power of God. How many believes
[1:54:42] God's quickening power could change the
[1:54:44] darkest person?
[1:54:46] baby. It's it's it's a it's a power of
[1:54:50] the resurrection and the love of of
[1:54:53] Calvary that put him there can do
[1:54:56] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[1:54:59] can even ask or think. So always look
[1:55:02] for the good. Always be on your toes to
[1:55:07] share. And if you don't have something
[1:55:10] to share, then do what brother George
[1:55:13] suggests. Get at the foot of the cross.
[1:55:15] till you know God's done something for
[1:55:18] you. And then just tell the world how
[1:55:21] your candle got lit. And and I I know
[1:55:27] that God did something for me and you
[1:55:32] know I one day I just shared it. how my
[1:55:36] testimony I shared it and I got calls
[1:55:39] from all over the world
[1:55:42] because of just telling how my candle
[1:55:45] got lit. Not for my preaching ability,
[1:55:48] not for my teaching, not for my
[1:55:52] doctrine, not for my personality, but
[1:55:55] just because they knew what God did for
[1:55:59] me. I couldn't begin. A a man driving
[1:56:03] down the road in Germany 80 miles an
[1:56:06] hour listening. That's not nothing in
[1:56:09] Germany.
[1:56:11] Listening to the what God did for me. He
[1:56:14] didn't know me, but he knew that God did
[1:56:17] something for somebody. Stopped his car,
[1:56:21] got out on the highway, and gave his
[1:56:23] heart to the Lord
[1:56:26] because it's real. one of the founders
[1:56:30] of the Assembly of God Church who was in
[1:56:33] Hot Springs, Arkansas
[1:56:36] at the very founding of the Assembly of
[1:56:38] God Church came to me after what God did
[1:56:42] for me. Not what I did for God, but that
[1:56:45] God's love extended to me and forgave me
[1:56:51] from where I was and brought me to the
[1:56:54] truth. looked me straight in the eye and
[1:56:56] said, "I never understood predestination
[1:57:01] until I heard your testimony."
[1:57:03] Don't be ashamed of what God's done for
[1:57:06] you. Don't be ashamed because he gave
[1:57:08] you this message and they don't have it.
[1:57:12] You know what I mean? This message is
[1:57:14] life to me. It's made me everything that
[1:57:18] I am. Everything that I have.
[1:57:21] You know what I mean? And it's
[1:57:23] wonderful.
[1:57:25] and it's answered every question that
[1:57:28] I've ever had. And if you could just,
[1:57:32] you know, just to me that's the path
[1:57:35] forward to the church is letting the
[1:57:38] love of God be shed abroad and start
[1:57:41] reaching out beyond your comfort zone.
[1:57:44] Go outside of the circle. Extend
[1:57:47] yourself.
[1:57:48] Make contact with the unfamiliar. make
[1:57:53] contact with those that you're not
[1:57:56] comfortable with. And like our brother
[1:57:58] told us, every single case there was
[1:58:01] segregation. We don't want to create
[1:58:04] that segregation.
[1:58:06] We want to know that everyone's welcome.
[1:58:09] And and we've had some lovely visitors
[1:58:12] this morning, hungry people after the
[1:58:14] gospel. beautiful
[1:58:17] sitting and talking with them and and
[1:58:19] and knowing that they want truth and and
[1:58:23] and I would I'd like to see the church.
[1:58:25] I don't care if they come in in pants.
[1:58:28] I don't care if they come in whatever
[1:58:31] condition they come in, let them come
[1:58:33] in. But if they hear the truth and the
[1:58:37] spirit of God touches them, they won't
[1:58:39] go out the way they come in. Amen. And
[1:58:43] that doesn't take the preacher. That
[1:58:46] takes the congregation creating the
[1:58:49] atmosphere and having faith that the
[1:58:52] Holy Spirit will move. That's right. And
[1:58:54] it takes you coming in the right
[1:58:56] atmosphere, coming with expectation,
[1:58:59] having put time and and prayer into the
[1:59:04] service. Not just coming and fulfilling
[1:59:08] the fact that you follow the message and
[1:59:10] you're supposed to go to church Sunday
[1:59:12] morning. So you come here to fulfill
[1:59:14] your Sunday obligation to go to church.
[1:59:18] You can say you go to church and you
[1:59:21] know we won't go any further down that
[1:59:23] line.
[1:59:25] But because you want souls saved,
[1:59:28] you know, and the prophet of God said
[1:59:30] that the church has lost its
[1:59:32] spirituality because it's lost its
[1:59:35] desire for lost souls.
[1:59:38] Just think of it. How many people in
[1:59:41] this town? We have a lot of missionary
[1:59:44] work to do right here. Yes, sir. In
[1:59:46] fact, I believe our messenger told us
[1:59:48] the greatest missionary field in the
[1:59:50] world is the United States of America.
[1:59:53] So let's let's let that love and and
[1:59:57] that love isn't because we first loved
[1:59:59] him. It was because he first loved us.
[2:00:03] We love him because he first loved. Let
[2:00:06] that love go out. Reach out to people.
[2:00:09] Let them know that they have hope. Let
[2:00:11] them know that God can do for them
[2:00:13] exceedingly and abundantly above you.
[2:00:16] Have faith for them. And and and you'll
[2:00:20] find out that faith's contagious. and
[2:00:23] love's contagious. And then we'll start
[2:00:25] seeing the power of God move. And you'll
[2:00:30] start seeing that God answers your
[2:00:31] prayers. And when you live for others,
[2:00:35] then God rewards you. And he's you never
[2:00:40] outgive God. You never outserve God. You
[2:00:44] do something for the kingdom, God will
[2:00:46] give you a hundfold in this life and the
[2:00:50] life to come. We we've got to move back
[2:00:53] to Christian biblical principles and and
[2:00:57] and really get back to what it means and
[2:01:02] to that real experience of being filled
[2:01:06] and with the Holy Spirit and having your
[2:01:09] nature changed. Man, and I I I can say
[2:01:13] this. I'm not what I want to be and I'm
[2:01:16] not what I ought to be, but I know I'm
[2:01:20] not what I used to be.
[2:01:23] And I'm thankful for that. So, like all
[2:01:26] things, we leave those things which are
[2:01:28] behind behind and we press for a higher
[2:01:32] calling. Amen. So, I I I I'm sure that
[2:01:35] we enjoyed Brother George. Brother
[2:01:38] George comes by every once he's welcome
[2:01:41] more than he comes by. You know that.
[2:01:44] Right. Right. So So uh it's not that
[2:01:47] he's not invited. Okay. But he's got an
[2:01:50] open door here. my friend uh testimony
[2:01:55] and and I you know I I we were reading
[2:01:59] in the back room where we're talking
[2:02:01] about our messenger and so he he we read
[2:02:05] the quote where it said you know uh he
[2:02:10] says yeah my daughter's here and and
[2:02:13] well she's not a girl anymore she's a
[2:02:16] young lady and she's dating that was it
[2:02:19] wasn't it scrawny what was that Langley
[2:02:22] Langley soldier boy and then he said I
[2:02:26] see him
[2:02:28] and I I thought well that's good you
[2:02:31] know so it's always been nice uh I've
[2:02:35] known George for a long time he's never
[2:02:36] used the fact that if he knew brother
[2:02:40] Brandham or that he was married to
[2:02:43] brother Bram's daughter as any reason
[2:02:46] that he should be heard or or or ever
[2:02:50] tried to use that for his own benefit.
[2:02:54] He's always just tried to promote the
[2:02:57] balanced truth
[2:02:59] of the gospel and the spirit and love
[2:03:03] that brother Brandham had for the lost.
[2:03:05] And we appreciate that about you,
[2:03:07] Brother George. And and and just pray
[2:03:11] that God continues to bless you and keep
[2:03:14] you in good health. And uh have you made
[2:03:17] 80 yet? Two months. Two months, 80 years
[2:03:21] old.
[2:03:23] Amen. I hope I look that good when I
[2:03:27] made it.
[2:03:29] I got five more years. So maybe by God's
[2:03:32] grace, if he can be going strong at 80,
[2:03:34] I might be able to be there. But I told
[2:03:37] the brothers when I start reading from
[2:03:40] the book of Job and turn to the book of
[2:03:44] Psalms and I introduce the same person
[2:03:47] two or three times, it's time for me to
[2:03:50] go. So when it's time for me to go, kick
[2:03:53] me out. Okay? The church will go on
[2:03:57] because it's the inddwelling spirit that
[2:04:00] keeps the church together. It's not the
[2:04:02] politics. It's not the function of the
[2:04:05] deacons. It's not the order of the
[2:04:08] church. The Holy Spirit runs the church.
[2:04:12] And if you've got one ounce of that love
[2:04:14] in your heart for one another, you'll be
[2:04:18] and stick together with one another to
[2:04:20] the end. Even if the Lord takes me off
[2:04:23] the scene or whatever he does, that
[2:04:25] doesn't matter. Truth is what we're
[2:04:28] built on. And the truth is the blood of
[2:04:31] Jesus Christ and the paid for our sins.
[2:04:34] and he sent his spirit back to dwell in
[2:04:36] us. So, God bless you. Uh uh uh continue
[2:04:41] to pray and we'll probably listen to a
[2:04:44] little tape this Wednesday and uh then
[2:04:48] we'll share with you what's on our
[2:04:50] hearts next Sunday morning. And we don't
[2:04:54] know after that uh what'll go on. Maybe
[2:04:57] the rapture.
[2:04:59] Huh? Are you looking for a rapture?
[2:05:01] Musicians will come.
[2:05:04] And I want to sing that song before I
[2:05:07] can probably get through about two
[2:05:08] verses before I have to turn it over.
[2:05:11] Let's stand together and sing I am
[2:05:13] thinking of a rapture. Amen. Is that
[2:05:16] what you're thinking about? Amen. If you
[2:05:19] want to take Brother George up on his
[2:05:21] advice, if you don't have a church age
[2:05:23] book to read a page, we'll get you one.
[2:05:27] If you don't have a Bible, we'll get you
[2:05:30] one. We'll provide whatever you need.
[2:05:33] The only thing we can't provide for you
[2:05:35] is your prayer.
[2:05:37] You've got to do that yourself.
[2:05:40] But we'll help you with whatever else
[2:05:42] that you need. Amen. Are you thinking
[2:05:45] about it? Oh, it's it ought to be what's
[2:05:47] on your heart every single moment of the
[2:05:51] day. Let's sing it together. I am
[2:05:54] thinking of the rapture on that passage.
[2:05:59] When the redeemed
[2:06:02] are gathering,
[2:06:04] [Music]
