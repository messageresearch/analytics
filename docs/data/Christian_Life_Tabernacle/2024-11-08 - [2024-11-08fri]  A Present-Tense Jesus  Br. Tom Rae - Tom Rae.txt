and Savior Jesus Christ we ask these things amen and amen God bless you you may be seated just for a moment if you guys just stay for a moment certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord and and uh uh come out and be together and just like to uh you know welcome you you all and our visitors and uh you know we we have our our special friends that have come down from Canada that are with us and uh Ken Linda Ard deal are with us and Dave and Marilyn cherof are with us and Tom and Joanne Ray are with us and their two children Sam and Rebecca Ray and Mike and Abigail Ray so would you all stand up thank [Applause] you I I consider them dear friends on my part and uh uh then we know that uh that also the these are brother bisco's three daughters that are with us and that's also very PR Maryland uh painted our baptismal uh uh painting for us and we really appreciate that that sister Maryland uh of course I gave her a hard time every stroke you know I I tell her she needed to put a boat on the river and and there should be a guy no why don't you turn it into them casting the Nets and and uh but she she endured she had a vision and she stayed with it and she endured and it came out and and uh so you know I told her like any artist you have a drive in you and I just said Maryland it's perfect don't sit there thinking of what else you could do to the pain to make it better so I to have that touch I I felt led of the Lord in my heart and I wanted the family to be a part of what we are here so I I appreciate that all very very very much you know every year um when we have a meeting we call this our dedicating dedication service and really we we all know that everything should be a dedication in our lives but we set this time aside to thank the Lord for allowing us to build this to get through the struggles that it's taken to have resolved to go through the resistance that was raised and uh and to persevere and it took all of your efforts it took all of your money it took all of your time and uh all of you should be uh thankful and proud of what that the Lord has done for us and so in doing this the theme for the meeting which came to my heart was um came to me out of the Gospel of uh St Luke and it said simply this it said and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wish ye know that know not that I must be about my father's business and I thought well what's what what is the theme it just came onto my heart that the theme of this meeting is to be about our father's business to be about our father's business bus and in the gospel of Mark it reads like this in the first chapter in the 35th verse it says in the morning riseth up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed and Simon and they that were with him followed after him and when they they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee and Jesus said unto them let us go into the next towns that I may preach there also for therefore came I forth and we know we have a Great Commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel and my heart's desire for the church is to return back to the father's business to return back to the things that pertaineth to the purpose for why that he's placed us here and then our messenger made this statement and I thought it was so wonderfully spoken and he said but my main achievement is to preach the gospel through the church church and do all that I can do to bring honor to Jesus Christ in this day while I'm here on Earth and what time I have left on Earth I come to try to say something to you that would help you and I I pray that this meeting many times we approach a service and we approach a meeting and we say Lord I have this need and Lord I have that need and we Heap our needs on the Altar and we sit there and and we're just waiting to receive some form of blessing some form of uh uh I don't know just a gift of some sort and my heart turned to said Lord I want to listen I want to Incline my ear to you this evening and lay my burdens down lay my desires lay down lay my needs down because you know what I have need of even before that I have and put in my heart just to close out all the confusion and all the things around us and all the things that I think that I have need of and just sit at his feet and listen and I believe with all my heart that he wants to speak to not only us as a church our church here what we call Christian Life but to speak to us as individuals that he might fit us and join us together in one perfect union with him and with one another and so to this evening I come to sit at his feet I believe that he chose a vessel and he'll use that vessel's voice and that vessel's voice will become the voice of God that's right and it speak and I can hear and I can believe and if I hear and believe what is spoken will come to pass that's my heart's desire you know and you know the lord loves you so therefore he wants to speak to you it doesn't always have to be correction it can be many other things that he has to say for you so brother Tom I'm thankful that you sacrificed to come brother Michael we're sincerely here to hear what God that would speak if we don't say Amen we don't show any emotion we sit here as cold as an ice cube we want you to know one thing we're listening to what you say that what you speak might be manifested in flesh in our lives so let's Stand Together what's what I said I know what I'm going to sing this poor man cried this just kind of became me and brother Tom's theme song we got singing this one night we got so in the spirit we were stagging around out here and a brother come up up to me and he said boy he said you and brother Tom were drunk tonight I said praise God amen I love the Lord I love the freedom that we have in sincerity I I don't want to shout no how I live you you know what I mean I I I don't want to get more joy than I'm willing to give love but I really want the goodness of God so let's have a nice time let's let our Spirits relax let's say Lord I'm here to hear from you and what is the go gospel it's good news it's glad tithing the angel said always come to give you good news and Glad Tidings amen sing it with me I sought the Lord and he answer me Ander me from everything are [Music] R [Music] never and the Lord heard me and he Sav me [Music] my the son of [Music] you he

Hearts Hallelujah lift up our hands yes say all praise His name forever hallu well this won't be forever this might be for an hour but let's praise His name our dear heavenly father as we stand in the August presence of the almighty God lord as your children have gathered together in that precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ who said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in their midst so what a promise that is Lord God you could come to our individual pews and you could touch us and you could speak you could move and you could have your Divine will and way within all of our lives so father tonight as we stand here as we've been preparing our hearts Lord for this whole weekend of dedication Lord we want to dedicate Our Lives aresh to you as we would a building and so father we're just praying that the glory of God settle upon each and every one of us now we'll turn to the word Lord and we'll ask that you the author of it would Inspire it to both hearer and

you don't fall asleep on me well it's nice to see everyone I used to know where y all sat now you're spread out on me but that's okay if you won't mind I'll take a few seconds to look at the church I'm not looking at this building I'm looking at the church I'm checking you out where all you're sitting you're moving in wrong space but you're looking pretty good amen God bless you isn't it wonderful to see what God has done for us these are these are great times Brother David I say that from the depths of my heart think that I could be a part with you here these many years and now see

and to be with you brother David sister lesie with all the love and all that you've done for our family over the years things that you don't never know you never know never until we get to heaven you

Matthew Gabriel her family David Julia of course Sharon I'm sorry Joel wasn't here and I'm sorry Aaron and Elizabeth aren't here I would have made it complete David and Julia you've all been a part of the fabric of my Christian life so I don't stand here to try and be anything I'm not I am what God has done in my life like Brother David said well some Will shout and sing and some will weep and cry well I don't know what I'm going to do Sister Barbara half the time I cry and brother Gary half the time I showed so I'm I'm a paradox I don't get it but I thank you all over the years you're giving to to the ministry and allowing us to travel and preach this gospel which is the good news of Jesus Christ amen I thank you for your love gifts to me personally over the years Philippine Phil the Philippians 4 and four says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice brother Ben we Rejoice together I looked at a little bit of history of and this is not the dedication service this is just me just calming my butterflies 1978 I believe right 1978 if I'm wrong screaming you're wrong okay thank you Christian Life Tabernacle I thought this was an unusual statement that you have it was called a city set on a hill and when we built overdale Bible Way brother Ken can attest to it we've called it The Church on the Hill and I thought that that's nice ring that's a nice ring you've been proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's been restored through the fullness by God through his servant God's prophet and I'm not ashamed to Proclaim and his name is William Maran brandham everything's bigger in Texas have you ever heard that saying you heard that yeah I checked it up see you can check anything over time the saying everything is bigger in Texas has gained traction and firmly embedded in the culture of the fabric of the state it was used to describe a wide range of things from the size of Texas Stakes portions of food and that I can attest look at me to the law uh to the state Larger than Life in all its teams and events that they put on a born Texan has instilled in his system a mindset of No Retreat and no surrender now you're getting to my territory I might want to be a Texan no retreat I'd love that to be a little thing on on your fridge no retreat no surrender Satan they might use that for the world but I'm going to take it in the reality of the word of God I will not surrender no sir and I'll never Retreat so I thought that is that is something natural typing is spiritual not all Texans can say this but but you that are here as Believers can truly say no surrender no retreat another saying they had on I'm sure this is all I mean this is you've known this from your school days so this is just I love Texas because Texans think anything's possible ah I I think all believers should move to Texas a prophet preaches all things are ah just a second now I'm in Texas now I all than this is your slogans not mine but knowing then that we're not Texans I'm not British Colombian I'm not Canadian I am a Christian so really what happens they take what we are and use it to their benefit so I think we should be able to take what they say they are and we can say what we really are then I can say I love Christianity I love Jesus Christ because with Jesus Christ all things are possible [Applause] so indeed can I say all things are bigger in Texas yeah I think you got biggest hearts I've known yeah we have all these little slogans and things that we use and side remarks but when you get it down to your own life if everything is bigger in Texas than I've got a bigger heart for Christ and that's what matters so when you look at the Church of the Living God here the local church here I can say then it's true all things are bigger in Texas because our hearts are won by Christ's love God bless bless you God bless your devotion and your dedication through this project and as we will say other things over the next course of these next few days and I feel humbled to be then a part of this great event for you I I know you've been in the new church and it's lovely this is the first time I walked through the doors and you see and I know in a project I know we know what a project takes we know the effort the burden a pastor takes and trustees and deacons we we know that we thank God for every labor of love every prayer prayed every dollar given to make what this little building is it's lovely it's to the credit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I thank the Lord Jesus for this place this Lighthouse truly a city on the hill so without any further delay can we stand to our feet you've heard enough of Texas St John chapter 14 it's one of my favorite every time I say that everybody I say well Romans 8 is my favorite then I'll say John 14 is my favorite then I might as well just say every chapter in the book's my favorite amen but St John chapter 14 is indeed one of my favorite chapters and we shall read from St John 14 verse1 let not your heart be troubled you believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and one place in the message brother Bram said he's been preparing that place for thousands of years now think every thought that God thinks is a perfect thought so I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard the glory that awaits us and I if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know not you know and the way you know Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me amen and if you know me you shall have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you you had not thou not thou not known me Phillip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou show us the father let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we've read your word we've looked at this lovely group of people this beautiful building that has been erected Lord God we just pray that your glory would fill every Temple and that the word of God will thrill our hearts tonight we ask in Jesus name amen you may have your seats apparently I get I have a reputation I have a reputation and uh Billy did it to me brother Billy Brother Gary where's Brother Gary there's brother Gary Matthew there's brother Matthew and then the pastor so I figur I'm they're all in good company said brother Tom you're going to preach out to Christ is the mystery of God revealed I said how do you know that after these many years and thus my first quote is out of Christ The Mystery of God revealed so is brother Dave David has Pastor mcari may I give the correct title as he has said I I like an excited Church don't you worry but I don't I don't like excitement and forgetfulness right oh that was a great service what did I preach and and that is a discredit and so then we want to be able to say something that you can deposit and if if you're living it shout it if you're not say ouch and say I want to live it I'm going to live it and the devil's a liar but the word is true so we know we're living in a particular day it's called The Coming of the Lord brother brah said in one in one place he says you don't look for the Rapture he said the Rapture is already in you so at that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father's in me I in you and you in me we've got that that's scripture that's scripture at that Day verse 20 at that day is everybody looking at me okay I just I'm just making sure cuz I'm looking at you you know it's like in a living room you know you look away and you're not that shows me you're not interested so I I get I like interest so at that day we say that's this day right that's what Jesus said You shall know that I'm in the father and you in me and I in you so now was it in can can we say well was that in Luther's day we could say yes a portion can we say in Wesley's day yes indeed a portion can we say in Pentecost we can say yes a portion but now brother Brandon preaches a message desperation the fullness the fullness of God is dwelling in a body now if he's dwelling in us then there's benefits to the life that's in us that we're no longer the Church of feelings okay yeah and sorry honey I got to do it just one time okay I see I can get yep yep yep yep I can count those in my brain I got 20 over here and I got a few amens over there that's fine I want you to all agree just all agree that I have Christ in me yes and if Christ is in me then I draw all the benefits of that God in Me Not Looking to yesterday but we have to start looking to what we are today so we say there's going to be a Rapture brother Tom when's that Rapture going to happen well if it happens right now we don't put it off till tomorrow say it's going to happen tomorrow no today is the day of your salvation it's this day the problem of us is we put everything off till tomorrow but God is a god of the present that's right you say well I I know God of the past and I know God of the future but we need to know the god of the present then if you know the god of the present then you can be a real Texan woo walked right into that one didn't you because a true Christian says all things are possible what day what day going to be tomorrow how about right now I don't care what your need is I know a God that meets your need right now I know victory is yours right now healing is yours right now Deliverance is yours right now grace of God revealed Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know I'm in the father and the father in me I in you and you in me now notice what he said here when this Revelation is made known not this nope that's not going to do your knowledge isn't going to do anything for you but revelation will do everything for you and that is the most important Michael and I were talking about it a brother preached back home on Wednesday night you brother Bram said in a message you can never overemphasize Revelation enough it's the most important thing to pray for are you listening it's the most important thing to pray for in the whole world see you see a lot of times we we we we cut quotes to fit what we want to say but rather than take the whole quote it's the most important thing in the whole world so as I was looking to the Lord this afternoon Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this Revelation is now made known you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you you and me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you'll know that I and the father are one so now Jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father so now where do we get to the point where I want to see Jesus uh-huh but already you you're already bound up by your own self analysis y you're all bound up by now well how could I be a Christian I blew it there I blew this here I blew that you will blow it today tomorrow and the next day but there's something in you that does not want to blow it today tomorrow and the next day and that's why the blood of Christ is here to cleanse you from from what all sin so what does that do drive out condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus there's therefore now no condemnation so when you see Tom on who do you see well you see a white hair guy maybe not so white-haired 14 years ago and I think I was Joel Joel my youngest boy said dad I don't even know what you look like before because I've only known you as white well that might be true and I've had wa here for a long long time and I've had and his body is getting older but somebody told me the other day how old are you brother Tom or asked me the question how old are you brother Tom I said how how old do you think well sometimes I see you running around and I think you're pretty young I says okay well then how old am I he says I don't know but you look old that that really hurt right so I he says I said well how how I said I'm 70 he says well how does sany feel like I these inquiry kids I said I don't know I've never been this way before you know I I don't know where you're supposed to feel like at 70 I I just happen to be whatever I am and and and and I am what I am but one day mm one glorious moment could be will I'm standing right here because that prophecy that is a prophetic message and it said at that day and I got to believe it's this day it could happen right as I'm standing at this pulpit and you'd see a 5 foot6 man blond hair skinny ER I just G you but now remember let I'll give you some hope here because some of you have looked at some of our old wedding pictures and had I I've been insulted in my own home I mean whose wedding pictures would I have in my home really do I clut yours never you have your own so I've got my own there's my darling wife and there's me so they opened the book and they looked at and said who's that what an insult well who else would it be well we can see Joanne oh yeah she married another guy I don't know him come on but let me give you an idea when when Peter James and John went to mount Transfiguration did they have cameras in their day but they knew Moses they knew Elijah how did they know him they knew him by Revelation and as the Rapture is one more Revelation it will take a revelation for you to know who David migiri is Tom Ray is right mhm so the older we get the bigger the surprise Michael won't change that much he'll probably have blonde hair again but we're living in a day that and and really Church we're moving in an hour that we're not playing church we didn't come to to warm a Pew or we didn't come to just lift up our hands or showed amen or do whatever we came to meet him and to know him is life eternal and that is a very key part because we can know about Jesus and that's just putting on religion but to know him is life and life eternal so there's a day that we're talking about this day this scripture or can I say this prophecy is being f fulfilled in your ears and don't come and Nash on me and want to put me over the hill but when Jesus made the Declaration open the book The Scroll was open the book was open and Jesus pointed the scripture of where and who he was because he stated who he was the Bible says those men then desired to kill him that's right that's right so even when you start confessing who you are and I won't say it's the devil on the people but if is it really you are Christ what your problem is is the veil the badger skin The Mask as I preached here about seven or eight years ago and it's really a time where we need to look past the mask the veil the badger skin and look at one another and say she's my brother or she's my brother wow she's my sister he's my brother rather than hey you know about her do you know what he did mhm well let me ask you a question you have not been caught in adultery and they threw her a lady that according to the law was to be stoned right threw her at the feet of the word and she's laying there and they're wanting to Stone her but what did the word say here's a here's a great one for everyone to understand he that is without sin casts the first stone somehow we feel this self-righteousness maybe because we listened to three tapes that day and read your Bible when you read and you pray and you listen to the word the word will never cause you to raise your self-righteousness up amen and by in prayer in prayer anybody know how to pray here get down and pray you cannot hate anybody when you pray you've come out of the odor of the Rose of Sharon mhm the lily of the valley and that little that person that you had with up hurt with and like that when you come out of that presence you try and have that so the key of it is stay in that presence that that's the key that's the day we're living in we say I want to be uh to be like Jesus and we all got that Heavenly look on our face go out there and somebody cut you off mhm in the parking lot don't they know I'm an elder here and that's my spot he'll correct everything after I'm gone but it's so quickly because we let emotion we let stuff get us done down when the word is to lift you up lift you up in Christ I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me so i' like to preach a little subject tonight I won't hold you long and I'll put my watch here so we won't have the emergencies people pick us up on the subject a present tense Jesus a present tense Jesus a gospel that is not past because God has no past he's God how do you put God who never did begin and never ended and put a past on God and that has never got a future because he's always will be but we have to have Now language because we've been put in a space of time and in that time then we get sort of you know emulsified idea of time and space and things that bother us when God is a god of infinity and he looks at you through the blood slain before the foundation of the world so let me ask you the question they that have accepted the new birth and Are Born Again by the power of the word and his Spirit those that have been washed by the blood of the Lamb those that God has cleanse him Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost what's your problem Oh Brother Tom don't worry we're just starting we're preaching on Sister Amy a present tense gospel but you say oh brother Tom I I I've got a scripture that comes against you on that I said give me the scripture then Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever that's scripture that is in the time element but whatever God was he is and whatever God is he will be and we just had a prophet prove that so we can't put God in a slot past or present or future he just is so I like to speak on a little subject a present tense gospel the god that always is not was or will be he is listen to what brother RM said in Mighty God unveiled before us Moses went down to Egypt told the church fathers that the Lord God had visit him in the name of the I am are everybody I'm I'm serious when when I preach I'm serious but there's a point if there's no point to preach why preach so there's a point so now God sends a prophet to bring a point at this time he says Moses went down to Egypt told the church fathers that the Lord God had visit them in the name of the I am brother brand goes on to say that name is present tense not I was will be but I am right now we should be a say I don't want emotion but I'll give you some emotion to me that is glor yes Glory then the god that walked on the Sea of Galilee it's the same God that's in this building Hallelujah same God that broke bread broke fish heal the sick come on stay with me sing God that Open the Eyes of the blind is the same God that is here right now Hallelujah because he's a god of the I am and we're the only ones that slot God into something that's right because of I'm too tired I've got a job I got to do tomorrow listen let's get in a realm of heavenly places uhhuh that's why this message came for to lift you into Heavenly places what the prophet said lift you the heavy Heavenly places always if you want to look it up greatest battle ever fought so the god of the I am hallelujah praise the Lord you mean the god that parted the Red Sea that God is the I am the god that parted Jordan is the god of the I am the God that was with William brandham is the god of the I am the god that's in the bride is the god of the I [Applause] am Hallelujah let me ask you a question here's a good question for you and that you know this goes to you know you know preachers can preach whatever they want to preach but this goes into hair and dress you know they get these wonky I'm sorry I'm in your Pulpit I'm I'll take it easy you know these ladies with braids down the here they're tag on no I'm not preaching anybody I'm just preaching on Hollywood I hate the spirit of Hollywood I should have got a louder Amen on that one amen hallelujah yep it's a demon and when demons Unite with politics uh-huh come on listen we are fighting a spiritual warfare I'll fight Hollywood I'll fight politics I'll fight demons I'll take God at his word Satan you're [Applause] defeated god of the I am is living in me Jesus Christ I'm serious we need to start treating one another respecting the God and one [Music] another when we look at haircuts and women's dress or men's fashion look out men can look AFF feminite now man they got tied it up like this here on listen that's no new thing on the sun that's right my brother I grew up in the 50s and the 60s my brother used to sit in a hot bathtub to shrink his jeans on him to make them tighter than tight yeah you haven't gone that far yet but you're going that way I S not you of course but whatever Hollywood's doing we don't do amen amen whatever haircuts they got we don't have okay it's a truth a Christian now let me ask you a question did Brother bradam put a badge on and say I'm Malachi 4 I'm ask the question I'm just asking did he put a badge on I'm Maliki 4 how did you know he was Malachi for ah by what Revelation by Revelation how about by the life he lived and your Revelation caught up with the life he lived huh how about us how about us we're Christians we're born again believers I don't have to have a sign I look like a Christian I walk like a [Applause] Christian why he's the I am he has never changed ah you're the one that was with Jesus how' they know that how did they know that by the way he talked he wasn't he was an ex fisherman I said X huh pretty rough stuffff I can't imagine how rough their language was but when they've been with Jesus language changed and that's why this Bible says thy speech betrayeth Thee I was in business in Toronto one time years ago I was at the Hyatt Hotel having breakfast having ham my wife I I'm now I'm confessing ham and eggs pancakes syrup and a lady comes up to me with an accent older lady little plump little lady come up and says can I fill your coffee absolutely need the morning paper yep absolutely those are days when they had papers and so I I'm having my breakfast and she comes by and she and we're just chitchatting you know you do and you're out out of town and she said um I said I know where you're from she says no way man nobody on this planet knows where I'm from I said I know where you from she says you do not and walks away so when she comes back to fill my coffee I said I'm going to tell you where you're from she says nobody will know where I'm from I said I'm going to tell you where you're from like like I'm a yeah they think you're quack of course right she says 'w

Christ you watch God come down and confirm your [Applause] confession hallah amen when I go someplace they can't figure our language out now I don't speak British but we get told a lot of times are

weekend you know how big that fish was do you know who won the Super Bowl man I'm hitting a lot of things here right now but it it's what's on our hearts it's really what's on our hearts what's on our heart Rapture Rapture we're living for [Applause] Rapture that's why brother Bisal preached 20 some odd years ago I am the Rapture I'm not looking for it that's what I've been called to [Applause] I'm going to I'm going to wait up one day and you know Israel is going to be in war and they're going to be on all the borders hello there'll be wars and rumors of War Korea Ukraine Russia China hello how many more indicators do you want but as the indicators go by we get boiled in water but it should be crazy ing our expectation because he is the god of the I am [Applause] Hallelujah we'll get off the first quote we'll get off the first quote I'm sorry Moses went down to Egypt told the church fathers that the Lord God has spoke to me in the name of the I am okay that name of the I am is a present tense name everything in the scripture perfect don't you ever let the devil get you and said there's a mistake in the Bible there is no mistake the only mistake in the Bible is between your ears just because you can't understand a God that has men right 66 books and you can't put it together doesn't mean God's not God that that means he is God cuz you can't figure him out if you can figure them out I don't want your God does everybody get that if your puny brain that can't even understand the circulatory system of your body you have a specialist that specializes in the eyeball and even they don't even understand what an eyeball fully functions think that you're going to figure out a God that there you go Adam how big is your God how big is your god he's a big [Applause] God don't you limit God by your gray matter I got to be deep God hidden and revealed in what before the seals what was it God hidden revealed in Simplicity before this seals right after the seals God hidden and revealed in Simplicity it's men that make this gospel complicated it's not complicated you must be born again must be born again to understand the kingdom of God of the I am for your day amen people say I'm Christian and go back to Luther that's not the god of the I am that's the god of the I was oh I understand God because John Wesley was a mighty man yes he was he was but it was the god of Wesley and that God moved on you got to walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from who's a Christian here today stand to your feet all right all right devil you see this see this this is the Invincible [Applause] Army right Gary we are the Invincible Army not will be not was but is the Invincible Army the Church of the Living God give them a wave offering take God Be The Glory Hallelujah let's give him a hand clap Hallelujah I feel like I can leap through a wall run through a troop amen she will be that was prophecy she will be I [Applause] [Music] am amen I [Applause] am who wants to say I am I am Glory this message came to you the mind of God said I'm going to send million brandom to this day to let you know I'm the god of the I [Applause] am you can have your seats God bless you you thought I was going to dismiss you I don't know where the time goes but it's 9 o' thank you I got one brother Ken you're an auctioner I got one do see too do we listen I don't know listen as I said I think I was in Louisiana a couple weeks ago everybody wants overtime oh yeah yeah you're so spiritual [Applause] here yeah you paid for overtime huh yeah the game's going overtime yeah yeah yeah we go overtime what are you thinking brother Tom do you know my baby has to go to bed you didn't worry about that at the football game okay I can tell by that so we should have way more than what they got and let me tell you we [Applause] do not we will we're having it right now and it didn't cost you dime so now as I said and I do say it at home so I have witnesses here how come the front branches are emptier but we go to an opera you can't even understand what they're saying in boat don't understand a thing they're saying but everybody said I got friends man okay okay pastor you know it it it's funny isn't it people get funny you know we fill a church from the back to the front but in stadiums it's front to the back well these are dedication meetings rededicating ourselves forget it devil I'm going to be at the front row I got one two amen I got cuz they're on the front row uhuh it changes the atmosphere expectation changes the atmosphere oh you may he's going to preach me happy he's going to be a little bit this way and that way Saints every service is different and that's what I love about God his gifts are all different so nobody brother Braham did not have to put a tag on and say I'm Malachi 4 nope he lived it and by living it people said you're a prophet you're a prophet only a prophet could do this Jesus you're a prophet ET only a prophet John are You Jesus I'm not worthy to unlatch your shoes he lived life and he didn't have the finest suit on either he had camel hair long beard but they thought he was a Christ how come his words what he spoke yes sir what he spoke amen and that is the part that we need to play now how we speaking young ladies let me tell you something looking at any one of these fellas right here that you think is a hunk is going to be fat okay that's half [Laughter] time than what he is now and young ladies or young men as you look at these beautiful young ladies they're going to have gray hair wrinkles and whatever brother BR said we do not look at the out we look at the ah okay because the inside is character and that character is a victory and that Victory comes from Christ Christ this very present gospel he's not the I was he's not the I will be but he said I'm the I am the same yesterday today and forever he's a present tense and that's why brother Brenham could take the scripture then as we said earlier he's the same yesterday today and forever because he's present tense present tense and God said unto Moses I am that I am thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am sent you I am I'm not just a god of history but I'm a god of the I am I'm not a god of the future but I'm a god of the what the I am so now let's live in the present is now God pleased with us in the I am now let me move along and I'll try and move along real fast you're pulling real good but I'm taking so long turn with me please to Genesis 1:1 started at Genesis 1:1 say brother Tom are you going to take us to revelation 22 you I have it in here so you might be Genesis 1:1 can we read it together please in the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth when in the beginning what does that convey then to the reader if you start studying out whether it be Hebrew heric Greek a few other languages let's study out it word by word because every word is a word from God so it convey it conveys in the beginning God is showing to a people right off the start that he is a God that continues to be present with people in the beginning God so now what he's letting the people know the god that created all mankind is going to be with them in their creation okay so it conveys A continuing presence of God so now it also then shows to us that he's a god of Providence because God when he made let me put it this way Providence uh you know sometimes the words get you know for the children I wouldn't say the adults get confused on a word like Providence but Providence means god which provides right God provides for what is needed in the future so God's providential ha has always been because he was a lamb what when so his God's Divine Providence knew man would fall okay so God being God wasn't going to let his seed fall there was always blood always blood but it's not for serpent seed that's right it's only for you you for God's elect you say well these things happen they're good people I'm not saying they're bad people all I'm saying that there is a predestinated people and so then by God's grace we are predestinated by the forn knowledge of God I'd like to get into that so then in God's for knowledge he makes provision cuz he knew you would be born in sin and being born in sin had to be a sacrifice but that lamb had to come forth come to Calvary die on the cross wash you in the blood that lamb had to come this day to take the book and to open the book and to reveal your name in the book that's the Providence of God do not think the way man thinks think the way God thinks God knew the book was going to be closed but God knew Malachi 4 was coming God provided in his Providence Hallelujah and in that Providence it didn't have Dave CH buroff in the book it had the revelation of who he is in the [Applause] book I'm sorry friends Tom Ray was not written in the book book but the revelation of Tom Ray was in the book I caught the Revelation by the opening of the seals who I am been preaching on it for the last six seven months been preaching on this heels and this heals and this heals people get in their mind it's a book it's a book it's a book it's not a book it's Christ it's not a book it's the lamb amen it's the title deed he owned everything but he's telling you all leans all encumbrances everything against you shrien off and you're The Virtuous sinless spotless you only know that because the book's open they couldn't preach it till Malachi 4 couldn't preach it till Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 couldn't preach it but now we can preach it because now we're finding out who we are in the I am you're wearing me out already not good it's great when John saw his name in the book all Heaven oh and all the KN heard him say glory honor not to a man but to the King of Kings it's never to a man it's to Christ himself [Applause] Hallelujah God bless you to God be the glory no man open the book no one worthy to look on the book not one not John not Paul come on no one worthy to look on the book for 2,000 years no one worthy but then in this today he not only said look on the book take the book and eat [Applause] him oh it's just an expression it's more than an expression folk it's your gray matter again forget your gray matter get in love with Christ we get down to Doctrine and we've gone through them all don't you worry I've lived through them we've gone through them all and where are they today and where are the people wrecks on the side of the road because they never pointed them to Christ they pointed him to a Doctrine they pointed him to a man and when you do that you kill the effect of the word and it's God's grace that bring people out of doctrines so God has Mercy absolutely absolutely if I take the bigger bottle it's longer who wants to vote for this or this sorry I have to lose thank you I'm sorry but now what is God showing to us and we know the Providence of God is all for us it's all for us and can I ask you a question I don't want to get in my Sunday morning service what can separ separate us from this love nothing nothing at all nothing nothing at all is impossible come on Texon I mean Christians nothing can separate us from this Revelation you see people flying off like flies you'll see them go you'll see them run and you'll see them fall fall faster than people that you knew 10 years ago they fall that fast but what's happening the Gap is getting great and we're going higher higher in the love of Jesus Higher in Christ so then in the beginning God conveys the continuing presence to his people he's not limited or Bound by time space or history shows that he's a god of Providence he continually cares over the governance of his creation God cares about you he's infinite there's no limit of any kind he's Sovereign he has authority to use his power when he wants he's the alls sufficient one he's the omn one now here now and this again let me help you I'm not using big words or brother I'm just using what the prophets said so you know you say well I don't know an omnicient I'm going to let you know what omniscient means not make it complicated omniscient means all things are known effortlessly and instantly he's omnicient that's why God can know all things and be everywhere because he knows everything that's why brother Bram said he he knows how much t a flea renders and how many times he bats his eye because he's God and we have a problem so now we have a a God that comes on the scene uses a mouthpiece calls William brandham to let us know who we are in Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed in you come on stay with me now so now God God's in you the omnipotent all knowing all powerful okay so I'll slow down again omnicient Everybody Get It class we get it omnicient he knows what everything effortlessly he doesn't have to think Tom's gon to have a ham sandwich after [Laughter] church huh he doesn't have to think that he knows it he knows I'll have mustard and not mayonnaise he don't know I have pepper and not salt he knows everything he's omniscient everything he knows your trial he knows your bank account he knows your need and my God Is A supplier of all your needs [Applause] oh my how many how many testimony over the years brother Tom I've had not a nickel rub together and all of a sudden I went to the mailbox and I open that mailbox and there's a check for exactly the amount I needed how many times has that happening how many times he doesn't say he'd Supply your wants he'll Supply your needs David said I was young once but now I'm old but I've never seen his seed begging bread we're not homeless we got a home Christ we're not by afference needing food we got Christ the bread of life we're not in a dry and thirsty land where're there's no water he's the fountain that's been opened in the House of David amen people die from Hunger people die from thirst people die it's a fact of life but the seed genes of God have a promise to be absent in the body is to be what present with the Lord people that get nervous they I'm GNA die hey I could die right now but guess what I'll be in the presence of the Lord and I'll be shouting in the Hills of Glory with no innovation nobody saying you can't shout that loud I can shout as loud as I want I can dance I can run I go around and around brother Brown went around a cherry tree I can run around the throne mhm there he goes again Tom's been doing that for a million years what's it going to be like you got a city 1,500 miles high don't say you're homeless right 1500 miles high that's right you know how high that is high very high anybody from thr in a plane a Jet Plane yeah plane 36,500 and some on that's only 6 miles you haven't got off the base yeah think about it you know think about it 1,500 Mile High and on top of that City on top of the Mount Zion where this city where the lamb is the light the light today you walking in in blood is in the light is he in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin that blood still has its working power and we're walking in that same light it's the I am light so we got a omnicient right we got everybody got that class how are we doing huh so we can at least leave here tonight knowing that my God knows all things without even thinking okay he knows everything now now now Lord do you care should never come out of our lips of course he cares do you that's what your Prophet preached he cares do you care of course he cares cares he's a god of Providence so a God knows your need and will supply your need so now he's omniscient so the next would be omnipresent so then omnipresent means he fills all space and all time and brother Bram said he can only do that because he's omnicient because he's the being then if he's omniscient knowing all things he's omn present fills all times in space he's omnipresent means that he's unlimited and able to do [Music] anything at that day you shall know that omniscience the omnipotent what day yeah what day don't limit God he's unlimited my son my son why don't you believe for your son rather than doubt for your son well I hope he get saved what are you talking about hope he is going to be [Applause] saved the revelation of a present tense God means that God always is and always present have you been with you so long Phillip when you've seen me you've seen the father have you been with me so long Matthew that when you see me you see Christ oh my that was very that's probably a thinking thought moment right so that's a good thing that's a thinking thought that's a good thinking thought now I want you to think another thought look at the one left to you and look at the one right of you now have you thought a different thought about them after why I preach for the last hour but you don't know brother Tom God does how do you know tonight that person is not at the end of his bed praying that God forgives him for that you don't know but he knows too easy to judge but he that's without sin you cast the first [Music] stone that's right we can't we we can't Saints because we then we start limiting God to our understanding you got to think this no I don't have to think what you think God sent a prophet to tell us what to think let this mind that was in Christ be in you who thought it not robbery to be equal with the I am my you talk about singing shouting dancing praising when you start getting Revelation God's in me hey when I when I first got saved let me tell you me and Dave we should and and the Lord kept us apart before we got saved for sure I was a long hair dope smoking hippie X I was the end of the he was the head of the CH what do you call it the leader of the pack Ken and I are with the wannab bees at the end of the Pack huh so I I got saved one night maybe like a night tonight and brother brisol just said is anybody here want to get saved no lightning bolt no earthquake no voices I just said I need him so bad I don't know how to get him I want him I want him and so I got to the Altar and I kned at the altar I didn't even know how to pray I didn't know how to pray I didn't hold hands I didn't I don't I don't know whatever you know I know nothing brother had praise with me and said Son Tom brother Tom you want to be saved I said in the worst way worst way and he prayed with me and I can't tell you what he prayed I got up I walked out I said it's gone my dope went drinking went lusting all all manners of sin left and when I walked into my mom and dad's home I was a fanatic and I don't even know what a fanatic is you know we we got names for everything but I didn't know what anything was my mom and dad have a a circular staircase going up to their front

away says you want to go downtown and witness I said sure I do I want to learn how to witness this other brother was which I will not mention cuz he's not worth mentioning says to me when you get a

better the other way huh can you imagine now can you imagine they would rather have you a long-haired dope smoking liar than I wash by the blood of Jesus Christ filled with God think about it but God knew God knew Saints you can't hide it under a bushel hide it under a bushel I'm going to let it absolutely shine try and hide it try I've done it I've tried tried not to witness guy next to me at a reunion table he says are you a Christian I didn't want to talk to him I said well I'm married to Joanne what does that mean I'm a Christian good good real good you know sometimes you feel like you know you just don't want him nobody here so spiritual like are you giv out so much and rejected so often you just say so he says well I went to a religious gathering I said good for you okay I said where he said Seattle I said with with who Who's Your Leader ER Baxter [Music] what started to grind inside you mean the man that was the manager for William marry and brandom that's the man I said what did you learn in your uh conference Satan is too big for us now what do you think I did that's exactly right Ben I said are you kidding me the devil's too big I am a son of the Living God purchased by the blood of the Lamb Satan put the devil under his foot and if I'm his son I can put the devil under my foot Hall not will be we are we are we are the sons of the Living God Amen I'm amening the amen in us people say well I can't say Amen well then you do you have God in you whoa Tom that took a real turn remember he is the amen and he amens the word so amen amens the amen that's not a pump up that's a reality yes how about that fellow that read the National Geographic come on how about him put him up in the attic somewhere don't read his Bible in the Attic reading National geograph his parents were or daughter was embarrassed cuz he was a fanatic but he was up there reading How deep the ocean is and found out there was no there's some spots where they can't even find how deep it is what did he have a screaming yelling fit that's right Glory if they can't find it in the ocean Satan you can't find mine Hallelujah why it's in the sea of his [Music] forgetfulness Glory H Hallelujah my goodness you you're so wonderful I know some of you are just it's okay it's okay I'm I'm just saying it's okay but if I give me a few more minutes that'll be okay too okay I got sure from the pastor okay so I we'll try and wrap this up so then the I man amen is declaring he's omnipresent he's omniscient he's omnipotent all right that's what God is that's what God is so then you say brother Tom I got God in Me So now which one of those omniscience do you want to take away is he not on the present anymore is he not all knowing anymore is he not omnident anymore God you can't divide God up let me help you Jehovah Gyra Jehovah nahu Jehovah Raha right Jehovah sh so seven Redemptive names of God so you say well those seven remp Redemptive names of God is Jesus Christ so then he's your righteousness uhhuh you want to say yep so but you can't take out he's not your Victory you can't take that out because he's you got to take it all or none and if he's your Shepherd he's your Victory he's your provider he's your righteousness he's the present God he's the I am [Applause] Lory Hallelujah praise the Lord his name is the I am have you ever introduced yourself as the I am we always add the qualifier at the end but for the god of Eternity has no qualifier because there's no qualification needed he simply is he's unchanging he's independent he's self-sufficient self- sustained amen he's the I am Deuteronomy 318 says and the Lord it is he that goeth before thee he shall be with thee he will not fail thee okay we just take that one scripture we could be here all night right now that's not oh there you go he will what Jehovah of the old amen is Jesus of the new it's a mighty Revelation that comes for me and you amen so now Deuteronomy says 31 and8 I will not fail thee Hebrews says I'll never leave you nor forsake you so it cannot change he just can't change we change our circumstance changes you're in Satan's Eden but it doesn't make God any different than what he is keep your thoughts on God keep your mind on God keep your thoughts Isaiah 431 but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob that formed the old Israel fear not I have redeemed redem Thee I have called thee by name Thou Art mine when thou passest through the water I'll be with you when you go through the rivers I'll be with you when they overflow I'll be with you when you walk through the fire you shall not be burned scripture Shadrach meak abendego they probably read that scripture a few times under the Prophet Jeremiah read this did you get that read the scriptures a few times under a prophet huh reading your scripture and saying the Fire won't hurt me furnace you can't have me God wants to take me home let him take me home killed killed the devil that tried to put him in there killed the circumstance loose the mans yep and they came out of the Fire come on out of your trial more liberated more revelated than ever before not even a smell of smoke that's your God that's my God and he is the god of the I am tonight amen hallelujah I am the Lord God and I oh you know that scripture ah I am the Lord God that's omnicient I the Lord God that is omnipotent I am the Lord God that is omnipresent I am the Lord that changed not but who changes television changes you YouTube changes you Tik Tock changes you Lincoln T come come on listen every

Satan then has got you in his grips to occupy your mind so that you don't read unveiling of God or Mighty God unveiled before us and brother Bram said well they lay on the shelves but they did we don't have shelves no more the books aren't there they're in data form and I my wife when I was five year anniversary spent four something thousand doll to get 63 to 65 tapes for me in the 80s that was a lot of money and now you can have it free access and don't access you only access it by coming here Wednesday and Sunday that is not walking with the I am walking with the I am is an everyday living experience and if I've preached too hard forgive me but may you take the word of God tonight and realize that he's a very present help in these troubling times Billy did I ask you to have a song Ready for me he said it ah hold on just a second now he said it he said it oh isn't that marvelous he said it I believe it that wasn't William brandham speaking and that's where a lot of people go off they think it's just a man God was using him like they've been using this microphone it's God in a man it was the I am himself living in a prophet and at that day you shall know that I in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me he said it help me out Billy please musicians please come [Music] he un break the unbreakable God we [Music] believe God we believe for from the imposs see I'm belie sister jul I'm belie he said it [Music] for you say I believe what are you wanting tonight still up your [Music] PO I believe you say it is [Music] imov great the unbreakable God we believe God we believe for from The Impossible will see a God God we for now before we sing he said it and I believe it before we sing it I know you got something on your heart I do know that and I wouldn't want you to leave tonight just just hearing some words without it reaching deep within your heart tonight knowing that the god that is omnipotent omniscient omnipresent is here to meet your need right now right now by your faith you said he said it I believe it if you want to reach out in faith tonight why don't you just lift up your heart lift up your hands and say you said it I believe it Lord I believe at that day you shall know [Music] [Music] move the inable great the Unbreakable we believe God [Music] weos [Music] God just as your musicians continue to play I want you to reach out in faith just in faith in your heart [Music] if God said ask anything in my name believeing and you shall have what you ask then why would we want to doubt why wouldn't we want to believe for the impossible you say the chains that are binding my daughter they can be loosed in a moment he did it throughout scriptures and he's done it in my own life he's the god of the impossible and if you can believe for that tonight you can walk out of here a different person if that's what your heart's Desiring tonight I I wouldn't want to limit God I just wouldn't want to limit him when he's unlimited he's unlimited doesn't know space or time distance he can come right to your Pew and change you in a moment like he did me no lightning no Thunder but a deep change Heavenly Father sorry Lord I've been all I'm so sorry these are precious people I love them dearly Lord you are the god of the impossible and I am resolved no longer to Linker Charmed by the world's Delight mothers Desiring children mothers Desiring Wayward Sons daddies Desiring jobs to provide for their families young men young ladies Lord you can do anything in these meetings maybe a little broken up tonight but Lord You're the god of the I am you're a present present to help present to sa present to deliver so Lord I commit this lovely group of people to you and Trust something Lord would be said and if I said anything little off off color or off tune Lord forgive me but we love your word and your word is true and I just pray you'll reach deep within the hearts of your children as I commit them now to you in Jesus name amen say pass it to the pastor move the immovable break the Unbreakable [Music] see [Music] if I ever heard a quote explained to me tonight it came so real to me the prophet of God said if you have eternal life you always had eternal [Music] life to know him for what that he is a present tense God a God that's never left us nor forsake us but was with us and even in us all the way to the end but he made this statement that moved upon me he said God came so he could convey his presence to the people now the question tonight is our we said we want to be about the father's business but how can we about the father's business if we're not in the father and that's the challenge tonight do you believe that wherever that you are now you know whether you're walking in his presence or not you know that this great scripture that our Messenger read to us he said he said when Amos looked out over the people he said he looked to a people who was called to be blessed of God that's you he said he knew what God had promised to bless and what a blessing was and how the people act with the blessing what a way to judge ourselves tonight now if I stand there I would say tonight that I'm wanting Lord I need more of you but there's more of him to have and if you're outside of him tonight I want to make this invitation to you if by the preaching of the word of God that you know that you're not acting the way a people that's blessed should act then maybe you just take a moment and say father I want to walk into your presence I want to give my life to you I want to give my heart to you maybe you've never surrendered your life you've always battled to have it but you've never just said I'm here to have your presence come into my life and change me I feel your spirit move and I'm blessed I I believe that you're a God that can do all kinds of things but I I've never come to that peace that's your path is understanding I've never come to that security that nothing can pluck me out of the palm of your hand I've never settled the question in my heart forever that I'm walking in his presence all I can do is offer you an opportunity [Music] that if you really want God to make a difference in your life and you'd like to come you don't have to come you can do it wherever you are but you know whether or not you've been sold out you know whether or not you got the big screen going you know whether or not you got what you're playing the music in your car you know all those things and you're tired of that war you're tired of that battle and the same God that parted the Red Sea is here the same God that healed the blind man is here the same God that cast out the demons and the devil is here that same God is here tonight to heal your soul and I'd be remissed of a Christian if I didn't give you the opportunity to come and say I want my life different I want to move up higher I want more of the Holy Ghost it's not the doctor am I interested it anymore it's the relationship that I'm interested in and I'm tired of living by alone my privilege I have eternal life I've always had eternal life but I'm not letting that eternal life liveing me I need Lord you to do something for me I need a I need a transformation I need a washing by the water of the word of God and don't be ashamed because if you're ashamed of him he'll be ashamed of you Paul said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the power of God un salvation I think I can do better as a Christian I think I can live cleaner as a believer I like I can walk daily in his presence and I'm living short of that you ask your own heart the question and if you want more of him then come ask him just come up if you want to just come up and say you know what I I want more of them I want to be different I'm tired of the fighting I'm tired of the fussing alls I want to do is live in his presence and as we sing this song Billy might grab a mic and help me sing I'm not a singer but you got all of Heaven as our brother said all the power all the presence everything that he is you are everything that he is he can be you can be you got a choice him or the world you say I don't think I have the strength to do it he's omnipotent he's Jehovah G he's the present God that supplieth all my needs he will not leave me nor forsake me and I just don't want an altar call I want you if you want to absolutely be transformed you're ready to give it to him put it in his hands and live in that presence then I welcome you to come [Music] help me sing something brother where are you [Music] you there may not be one you all might be good but I I want to give the opportunity if there's one here tonight that doesn't know him that really hasn't settled the question in their [Music] heart Maybe you have a need maybe you have a burden maybe you have something said Lord I want to I want to be different [Music] dra me Lord come just come up and stand up par on the altar yes Lord I'm tired to the battle Lord Lord I'm here to give myself 100% away you you brother so mind if you come pray with the people draw me oh Lord I want to rededicate my life I want to be about your [Music] business every day I want to know that you're the god that knows where I'm at every day I want to know you're the god that supplies my need I'm tired of worrying I'm I'm tired of the frustration I'm
