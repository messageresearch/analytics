[25:06] like
[25:16] [Music]
[25:50] so
[26:27] nice
[26:44] so
[30:15] peter
[30:16] uh
[30:16] left i'm sure that peter's got a side to
[30:19] this story
[30:23] right
[30:24] he he later says you know paul speaks
[30:27] many things that's
[30:29] hard to be understood you know and those
[30:31] of weak minds they get all upset about
[30:35] it but in the midst of everything that
[30:39] is going on
[30:41] here are the disciples
[30:43] and they have
[30:45] a
[30:46] i can say
[30:47] a human factor and human factors has
[30:52] played
[30:53] a lot of part
[30:55] in the scriptures
[30:57] and and the the part that we always have
[31:02] to deal with
[31:03] with humanism
[31:05] and of course
[31:07] the broad definition
[31:09] of the human side of things is when the
[31:12] nature of man
[31:14] gets involved in
[31:16] something uh
[31:19] many of you i i know are are
[31:22] taught teach school and your school
[31:25] teachers and you can see
[31:27] behavioral patterns of children
[31:31] and you are taught to see where those
[31:35] influences come from
[31:37] and we find out there's a lot of human
[31:40] factor in the gospel
[31:43] now we say why why do we take
[31:47] uh such a
[31:49] carnal subject when we're dealing with
[31:53] an elect lady
[31:55] we're dealing with a chosen people
[31:58] the the bride
[32:00] uh there's great mysteries to be
[32:03] discussing and great uh
[32:06] uh great uh
[32:08] truths that have been unfolded in our
[32:12] age and i find that a lot of times
[32:14] that's what happens to us is we get
[32:17] caught away uh
[32:19] into the theology and into the a
[32:23] spiritual mind and we begin to become so
[32:27] spiritual minded that we're missing the
[32:30] very world that's going on around us
[32:34] and a lot of time then we start looking
[32:38] upon
[32:39] heavenly things and we think of heavenly
[32:42] things and and
[32:44] and heavenly things are understood
[32:47] by uh the spiritual things but yet
[32:51] here we are in a body of flesh in a
[32:54] world
[32:55] dealing with human beings all around us
[32:59] and i have found that most of my trouble
[33:02] comes from humans
[33:06] i would say 99
[33:09] of my trouble comes
[33:12] from humans
[33:14] the other one percent comes from me
[33:17] but
[33:18] understand the the the scripture
[33:22] uh speaks of it and if it's been
[33:26] something that has gone on
[33:28] in the church all the time there has
[33:31] been disputations
[33:33] and disputings
[33:35] of doctrines disputing of
[33:38] of of different uh
[33:40] elements that have came up
[33:43] and people are voice their opinions they
[33:46] voice their sides they voice what they
[33:49] feel is the right way and what's the
[33:52] a wrong way and feelings get hurt and
[33:56] people have a tendency to begin to take
[33:58] sides and and
[34:00] and sure enough somebody will say
[34:03] something and it has such effect and
[34:05] such a disruption
[34:08] on our
[34:09] our our life and our spirit to where it
[34:12] can unsettle us and rob us from our
[34:16] peace and all it was was just something
[34:20] human
[34:22] just think of it the worst human you
[34:25] know
[34:26] probably isn't going to live
[34:29] over 110.
[34:32] my mom's up a hundred so i didn't want
[34:35] to say a hundred but she's not the worst
[34:37] person i know you know she's the best
[34:39] person i know
[34:41] but we let things that bother us we let
[34:44] the human side affect us and the human
[34:47] factor
[34:48] have an effect on us instead of being
[34:51] able to stand back and look at it and
[34:54] realize that's just
[34:57] human
[34:58] you know i i deal with it a lot of times
[35:02] in in in
[35:05] young people and and school kids and
[35:08] and work places
[35:10] where uh you you a
[35:13] child or a kid will be in high school
[35:16] for example and they'll get a teacher
[35:19] and the teachers mean the teacher
[35:23] is
[35:24] rough on them the teacher
[35:27] is negative towards them and they have a
[35:31] bad
[35:32] relationship
[35:34] with this teacher in fact this teacher
[35:36] might even go out of
[35:39] their way to make things difficult
[35:43] and i've sat down with many a
[35:45] a young person that was going through
[35:48] that and i always tried to explain i
[35:50] said stand back for a second
[35:53] separate yourself look at that person
[35:56] they're
[35:58] they're only here in your life
[36:03] for
[36:03] i don't know how long do you go to
[36:05] school i know it's way too long but is
[36:07] it six months at a time seven months at
[36:10] a time
[36:11] is it more than seven months
[36:14] nine months we need to put an end to
[36:16] that john
[36:18] how many agree that's just terrible
[36:21] hey amen you know
[36:23] no wonder i couldn't make it through
[36:25] high school
[36:26] that that's way too long
[36:28] but you gotta you gotta do it
[36:32] you know what i mean you can't let you
[36:34] can't let that person in nine months of
[36:38] your life change the whole course of
[36:40] your life
[36:42] you can't let that human factor affect
[36:45] you it's like somebody that's working
[36:49] and i i've met many a young man that had
[36:52] been on the job and maybe the boss says
[36:55] something
[36:56] and you know what boy that's the end of
[36:59] it they pick up their tools they just
[37:01] stomp off the job to hook over over
[37:05] to maybe three or four sentences or or
[37:09] or just
[37:11] just a human factor that came in
[37:14] somebody that's in a human spirit or a
[37:17] carnal spirit that just doesn't
[37:20] you know just is going to upset their
[37:23] their whole career their whole income
[37:26] pattern and everything because they let
[37:28] the human factor
[37:32] affect them they they
[37:34] they let something outside of them
[37:37] something that's just carnal something
[37:39] that's humid
[37:41] have an effect on us and if we would
[37:44] understand as christians that's part of
[37:47] the whole battle of being a christian
[37:50] and being an overcomer is to overcome
[37:53] the human factor
[37:55] it isn't always about following all
[37:58] these gracious rules and doing all these
[38:01] great works
[38:02] and and and give you know
[38:06] and having a lame for yourself a pattern
[38:08] for good works but there's also a great
[38:11] part of it is you have to deal with the
[38:13] negativity
[38:16] you know what i mean and believe me
[38:18] there's somebody out there
[38:21] that's been designed to get under your
[38:24] skin
[38:27] of course
[38:28] in my life it seems like everybody's
[38:31] designed to get under my skin but that's
[38:34] why i'm preaching this
[38:36] i'm working on it
[38:38] you know what i mean you've got to step
[38:40] back
[38:41] and understand there's a human factor
[38:44] and understand that
[38:46] in the scriptures
[38:48] the human factor has been a great part
[38:52] of the development of the church
[38:55] so let's just read a few places in the
[38:58] scripture
[39:01] so we read this one scripture
[39:03] in
[39:04] galatians where where paul and
[39:09] peter had a conflict
[39:11] and there was a factor
[39:13] and and paul stood back and and watched
[39:16] some brothers being carried away
[39:18] after and then and and then he watched a
[39:22] a gentile one of his converts go over
[39:26] and sit with the jews and wouldn't sit
[39:28] and he saw the confusion
[39:31] that it was causing and the message that
[39:34] it was sending
[39:36] and and so he stood up he felt he had to
[39:39] address it but there was a human factor
[39:43] involved in that that that raised that
[39:46] up
[39:47] and we could go to other places in the
[39:49] scripture where where where the human
[39:52] factor came into effect i believe it's
[39:55] in
[39:56] acts 16
[39:58] in the 17th verse of the book of acts
[40:02] that
[40:03] paul's walking down the street and the
[40:05] soo sayer
[40:07] girl comes out
[40:09] they have it here on the board the same
[40:10] followed paul
[40:12] and us and cried out saying these men
[40:15] are servants of the most high god
[40:18] which showeth
[40:20] unto us the way of salvation
[40:23] and this did she many days
[40:27] but paul being grieved
[40:30] turned and said unto the spirit i
[40:32] command thee in the name of jesus christ
[40:35] to come out of her
[40:36] and
[40:37] he came out the same hour
[40:41] and and so we see
[40:43] there that paul
[40:45] uh
[40:46] he he had to deal with the human factor
[40:49] there's a human that had a spirit about
[40:52] him and have something that was a
[40:53] discerner that was
[40:56] was was calling out and and you know the
[40:59] thing that she was saying was true
[41:02] but it got under paul's skin
[41:05] he let it go for a while
[41:08] but but there it's just an incident
[41:11] of humans
[41:13] playing a role
[41:15] in
[41:16] christian lives
[41:19] and we could go we could just go hours
[41:21] through the bible of people that
[41:24] withstood other people in the scripture
[41:27] people that that that rose up people
[41:30] that bore false witness people that that
[41:34] spoke lies and
[41:37] and and the many things that transpired
[41:40] in the scripture the human factor here
[41:43] let's just turn to acts 5 uh just real
[41:47] quick for a second we'll read
[41:49] uh a few other places
[41:52] uh
[41:53] in the scripture because i like uh
[41:56] the scriptures but
[41:58] in acts 5 uh
[42:00] let's just read the first uh thing
[42:03] and and look at the look at the nature
[42:06] of mankind the paul now paul's got to
[42:09] deal that peter's got to deal with this
[42:12] human factor
[42:14] he said but a certain man
[42:17] named
[42:18] ananias
[42:20] with sapphira his wife sold a possession
[42:25] and kept back part of the price
[42:29] his wife also being privy to it
[42:33] and brought a certain part and laid it
[42:35] at the apostles feet
[42:39] now
[42:40] you look at the judgment here of peter
[42:43] and peter said ananias why hath satan
[42:47] tilled thy heart
[42:48] to lie to the holy ghost
[42:51] and keep back
[42:53] part of the price of the land
[42:56] he said while it remained
[43:00] was it not thine own
[43:04] he said it was your money
[43:09] now now paul's dealing with the human
[43:11] factor
[43:14] what a story to put in here
[43:17] because he's he's dealing with a human
[43:20] being
[43:21] right
[43:22] that is pulling off a human stunt
[43:26] and is coming up with human actions now
[43:29] peter just says it was always yours look
[43:32] at what he says
[43:33] he says
[43:35] he says
[43:36] well it remained wasn't not thine
[43:39] and after it was sold
[43:41] was it not in thine own power
[43:45] why hast thou conceived this in thy
[43:49] heart
[43:50] thou thou hath
[43:52] not lied unto men but unto god
[43:55] and ananias hearing these words fell
[43:58] down and gave up the ghost
[44:00] and great fear came on all them that
[44:04] heard these things
[44:05] and the young men rose
[44:09] wound him up and carried
[44:12] him out and buried him
[44:15] and it was about the space of the three
[44:18] hours after when his wife not knowing
[44:20] what was done came in
[44:23] and peter answered unto her
[44:25] tell me
[44:26] wherefore ye sold the land
[44:29] for
[44:30] so much
[44:31] and she said yay for so much
[44:34] then peter said unto earth how is it
[44:37] that
[44:38] ye have agreed together to tempt the
[44:41] spirit of the lord behold the feet of
[44:44] them which have buried thy husband
[44:47] are at the door and shall carry thee out
[44:51] and she fell down straightway at his
[44:53] feet and yielded up the ghost and the
[44:56] young men came in and found her dead and
[44:59] carried her forth and buried her by her
[45:02] husband
[45:03] and a great fear came on all the church
[45:06] and upon as many as heard
[45:09] these things
[45:12] i don't want to miss
[45:14] the point here
[45:16] the point isn't that they they lied they
[45:18] did lie
[45:20] they didn't tell the truth
[45:22] they said that they they sold it for
[45:24] more and all the pretentiousness and all
[45:27] the things but i want you to see here's
[45:30] another part of the human factor
[45:34] entering into the church
[45:36] let's turn over to corinthians first
[45:38] corinthians
[45:40] and
[45:42] or we could just go if we get this
[45:44] reading order let's go to romans 14.
[46:02] so
[46:17] it says romans 14
[46:19] him that is weep
[46:21] in the faith receive ye
[46:25] but not to doubtful disputation
[46:31] for one believeth
[46:34] that he may eat all things
[46:37] another who is weak eateth herbs
[46:42] let not him that eateth despise him
[46:47] that eateth not
[46:50] let not
[46:51] him which eateth
[46:54] let and let not
[46:57] him which eateth not
[47:00] judge him that edith
[47:03] for god
[47:04] receiveth him
[47:06] who art thou that judges another man's
[47:10] servant now we're beginning to see the
[47:13] awareness of the human factor
[47:16] so so now
[47:18] paul's instruction of there's there's
[47:20] there's people that don't eat things
[47:23] there's people that eat things okay
[47:26] there's there's a human factor involved
[47:29] don't get caught up in the human factor
[47:32] don't get caught up in that side of it
[47:34] don't get caught up in the judgment
[47:36] don't be sucked into it and if you
[47:38] notice that all through your life in the
[47:41] workplace at the home place every place
[47:44] there's always something out there
[47:47] that's trying to suck you off of your
[47:49] ground that's trying to push you into a
[47:52] bad attitude trying to push you into a
[47:54] bad spirit again it's just the human
[47:58] factor
[47:59] they're everywhere
[48:02] these humans are
[48:04] are everywhere they're crawling
[48:07] everywhere and they've got all kinds of
[48:09] ideas and all kinds of thoughts and all
[48:12] kinds of opinions
[48:15] and if you're not aware that they're out
[48:17] there
[48:19] they're going to get you
[48:23] you might just become one yourself
[48:29] and you know it's amazing
[48:31] that this kind of seems to be the age
[48:35] where everybody's trying to disciple
[48:39] everybody
[48:40] politically they want you to think the
[48:42] way they do they want you to dress the
[48:45] way they they want you to accept their
[48:46] agendas they wanted to accept your
[48:50] your opinions they come against you with
[48:53] all kinds of attitudes all kinds of
[48:56] negativity all kinds of approaches it's
[49:00] just something you've just got to sit
[49:02] back and you've got to realize the human
[49:05] factor
[49:08] i i was going to
[49:12] today i was going to make a purchase
[49:15] it wasn't for myself it was for somebody
[49:18] else that uh
[49:20] i was going to make a purchase on their
[49:22] behalf
[49:24] and
[49:26] it did
[49:27] it it was for a little larger sum of
[49:31] money than you might be
[49:33] normally used so i had to use a credit
[49:35] card
[49:36] so
[49:37] i called the credit card company
[49:40] i made sure my balance was
[49:43] zero
[49:45] i talked with the representative
[49:48] and i explained to them the situation we
[49:51] got it all cleared up the amount
[49:54] who it was to
[49:56] and everything and he says when are you
[49:58] gonna make this purchase i'm gonna make
[50:00] it within
[50:02] the next 30 minutes and he says okay
[50:05] you're good to go
[50:08] good
[50:13] i
[50:14] call up
[50:16] i make the per to make the purchase
[50:19] and they decline me
[50:23] it's about that time
[50:25] that
[50:26] you realize
[50:28] that
[50:29] you just dealt with a human being
[50:34] i mean
[50:37] you know and now i'm embarrassed
[50:40] on the other end so now
[50:43] i've got the person that i'm trying to
[50:46] make the payment to
[50:48] they're on the other end and i'm
[50:50] now saying you've made a mistake
[50:53] i said now let's go over the number
[50:56] again the number is
[50:58] nobody's got their pen right
[51:01] you know
[51:03] i know some of the numbers
[51:06] but and i give her the number
[51:09] i give her the
[51:10] the number again so
[51:13] now
[51:14] i'm
[51:15] i now i'm dealing with another human
[51:17] factor
[51:19] but the worst part of the equation is my
[51:21] human factor
[51:23] is now entering into it
[51:26] now i'm going to start
[51:28] i'm going to start
[51:30] uh
[51:31] you know start
[51:33] the the human factor is starting to
[51:36] create
[51:37] attitudes
[51:39] in me
[51:40] it's starting to affect me
[51:43] you know so now i think that this poor
[51:46] person
[51:48] on the other side of this phone
[51:51] has got to have mental problems
[51:58] you know brother dan it's like
[52:00] like
[52:01] cutting it twice and it's still too
[52:03] short
[52:06] you know you just you just are sitting
[52:08] back and i'm thinking this can't be
[52:10] i just talked to the lady so now i'm
[52:13] explaining to the lady
[52:16] i just talked to him
[52:18] they said it was good to go
[52:21] well she can't help it
[52:25] she put it in she said i'll write it
[52:27] down i'll put it in again i put she puts
[52:30] it in again and and and and she comes
[52:34] back and says it's it's declined
[52:39] and so by this time i'm saying
[52:41] well
[52:43] the uh
[52:46] you know what i mean
[52:48] so
[52:49] some something's wrong here right
[52:51] well the whole the only thing that was
[52:53] wrong in the whole equation was the
[52:56] human factor
[53:00] and instead of if i'm just trying to say
[53:02] this because
[53:04] we're talking about a church
[53:06] that
[53:07] is
[53:08] wanting to move on to a perfection
[53:12] they're they're wanting to they're
[53:14] wanting to have a love
[53:16] that surpasses understanding they're
[53:19] they're wanting to have a peace that's
[53:21] your past understanding they want to
[53:23] have joy unspeakable they're they're
[53:26] talking about creating an atmosphere
[53:29] they're talking about being a burning
[53:31] candle sitting on a hilltop they're
[53:33] talking about laying a pattern of good
[53:36] works to
[53:37] that to glorify their father in heaven
[53:40] we've got all these great christian
[53:42] aspirations
[53:44] that were supposed to be the saints of
[53:47] god
[53:48] in shining armor but the the whole
[53:52] victory of every bit of that coming to
[53:55] pass is a realization of what you're
[53:58] dealing with
[54:03] you're dealing with humans
[54:05] you're dealing with the human factor
[54:08] every day there's a human factor in fact
[54:11] the world is trying to get the human
[54:13] factor completely out of everything
[54:20] it's going to be pretty strange the day
[54:22] a little robot comes into your room
[54:25] and starts nailing down the floor
[54:33] well they got robots for everything else
[54:37] i wouldn't trust a little machine that
[54:40] rides around my house and sweeps the
[54:41] floor for nothing
[54:44] i don't care that's what they made
[54:46] brooms for but somebody thought up the
[54:49] idea
[54:51] and the only time i've ever seen them
[54:53] things is stuck in a corner
[54:58] but somebody's buying them why
[55:01] because someone don't want to clean up
[55:03] or they get the idea i'm telling you
[55:05] that there's something amazing about
[55:08] the human factor
[55:10] and being able to discern
[55:14] the humanism
[55:16] that we're surrounded with
[55:18] we're just reading here in the scripture
[55:20] and i want you to watch the human factor
[55:23] as it unfolds
[55:26] in these scriptures
[55:28] and how that they have to work through
[55:32] this this human part
[55:35] of some eating some not eating
[55:38] human nature is
[55:40] they want a side either somebody's right
[55:43] or somebody's wrong
[55:45] either you eat
[55:47] or you don't eat
[55:49] and and and
[55:51] paul is talking with the romans and he's
[55:54] saying wait a minute
[55:56] that's human
[55:58] some eat and some don't
[56:00] but don't walk watch how it's handled it
[56:02] becomes beautiful
[56:04] he says let let him that edith despise
[56:08] him that eateth not
[56:10] let not him that eateth despiseth him
[56:13] that he is not and let not him which
[56:16] eateth
[56:17] not judge him that eateth
[56:20] for god hath received him who art thou
[56:23] to judge another man's servant
[56:26] to his own master he standeth or falleth
[56:30] yea
[56:33] he upholdeth for god is able
[56:36] to make him stand
[56:39] one man esteemeth one day above another
[56:43] another esteemeth every day alike
[56:47] let every man be fully persuaded in his
[56:51] own
[56:52] mind
[56:53] he that regardeth the day
[56:56] regardeth it unto the lord
[56:58] he that regardeth not the day
[57:02] to the lord
[57:03] he regardeth it
[57:06] he he does not regard it he that edith
[57:10] edith to the lord
[57:12] for he giveth god thanks
[57:15] and he that eateth not
[57:17] to the lord he eateth not and giveth god
[57:21] thanks
[57:22] for none of us liveth to himself and no
[57:26] man dieth to himself
[57:29] for whether we live
[57:32] we live unto the lord and whether we die
[57:35] we die in the lord wherefore we live
[57:39] therefore
[57:41] or die
[57:42] we are
[57:43] the lords
[57:45] for this end
[57:46] christ both died and rose
[57:50] and
[57:51] reviled that he might
[57:54] be
[57:55] lord both of the dead and the living
[57:58] but why
[58:00] dost thou judge thy brother
[58:03] or why does thou
[58:05] set at not thy brother for we shall all
[58:09] stand before the judgment seat of christ
[58:13] as it is written as i live
[58:17] as i live saith the lord every knee
[58:20] shall bow
[58:22] to
[58:23] shall bow to me
[58:25] and every tongue shall confess to god
[58:29] so
[58:30] so then every one of us shall give
[58:32] account of himself to god
[58:36] let us not therefore judge anymore
[58:39] but judge this rather that no man put a
[58:43] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[58:48] in his brother's way
[58:53] wow
[58:58] big part of christianity
[59:01] a big part of the consciousness of our
[59:05] life
[59:06] and our action
[59:08] and our reaction paul's actually dealing
[59:10] with how these people are reacting to
[59:13] what other people are doing
[59:17] they go here they go there they do this
[59:20] they see that they eat this they do that
[59:22] they work they don't work
[59:26] don't get caught up into
[59:28] don't judge your shirt let's close with
[59:30] just a couple more things just the human
[59:34] factor
[59:35] we know that the human factor
[59:38] is there let's read corinthians eight
[59:44] first corinthians the eighth chapter
[59:46] the human factor
[59:51] problems that rose up
[59:53] amongst early christians
[59:55] in regard with one another
[1:00:02] these are problems that rose up in the
[1:00:05] church
[1:00:06] the early church
[1:00:07] they were there were situations that
[1:00:10] rose up where some were eating herbs and
[1:00:13] other were eating meat and here's a
[1:00:16] whole another section
[1:00:18] here of of of
[1:00:20] the
[1:00:21] the
[1:00:22] what what
[1:00:23] rises up
[1:00:26] and and the reaction and action of human
[1:00:29] beings to certain things that come up
[1:00:33] and the importance of the christian and
[1:00:35] the individual
[1:00:37] to
[1:00:38] live and work out his own salvation with
[1:00:41] fear and trembling and if something
[1:00:44] condemns you then
[1:00:46] don't do it
[1:00:48] right all things are lawful for you but
[1:00:51] all things aren't expedient if you feel
[1:00:53] you can do something and it'll offend
[1:00:56] somebody else don't let it be a
[1:00:58] stumbling block you've got to understand
[1:01:00] what are you dealing with you're dealing
[1:01:02] with the human factor you're dealing
[1:01:04] this person is offended by what i do it
[1:01:07] ain't well they shouldn't be offended
[1:01:09] they should know better they should be
[1:01:11] more spiritual uh what's wrong with them
[1:01:14] they're just not even a christian
[1:01:15] they're backslid no you got to deal with
[1:01:18] it
[1:01:19] right it's a human factor
[1:01:22] you know what i mean not everybody
[1:01:25] not everybody stays after church and
[1:01:28] prays i would that we we stayed praying
[1:01:31] not everybody shows up to church on some
[1:01:34] time
[1:01:36] the human factor
[1:01:40] if you know to show up on time you show
[1:01:43] up on time
[1:01:44] if you want to stay and pray do you stay
[1:01:46] and pray
[1:01:47] you understand look you're going to find
[1:01:49] the human factor you're going to find
[1:01:51] people that come in they're
[1:01:53] disrespectful to the house of the lord
[1:01:55] because they're disrespectful to the
[1:01:57] offices it's a human factor
[1:02:00] if you if you don't realize that this is
[1:02:04] set up that
[1:02:07] that the biggest test
[1:02:09] comes in our lives comes from the people
[1:02:12] that surround our lives control over
[1:02:16] dealing with
[1:02:20] i know it gets under my skin
[1:02:23] you know what i mean
[1:02:25] and you know i'm trying to say when the
[1:02:27] waitress forgets to bring your coffee or
[1:02:30] or she serves you cold coffee or or or
[1:02:34] the the food's not hot or you're there
[1:02:36] first and past you and weights past you
[1:02:39] and waits on somebody else and and they
[1:02:42] you you put your order in somebody comes
[1:02:45] in 10 minutes later sits down and their
[1:02:48] food comes out first
[1:02:53] who are you going to strangle
[1:02:58] are you going to jump up and go talk to
[1:03:01] the manager
[1:03:03] are you going to let everybody in this
[1:03:05] in the shop know i didn't hear no more
[1:03:11] good
[1:03:12] we didn't like you anyway
[1:03:17] it isn't worth it
[1:03:24] and you say well why are you bringing up
[1:03:26] the human factor because people are
[1:03:29] removing god from their life
[1:03:33] look there's no more moral conscience
[1:03:36] there's no more god there's no more
[1:03:39] balance in their spirit
[1:03:41] they're they're they're now becoming
[1:03:43] being given over to reprobate minds to
[1:03:46] human thinking
[1:03:48] thinking used to be man used to have the
[1:03:51] fear of god in their heart the fear of
[1:03:54] of of retribution
[1:03:56] in their lives the fear of judgment in
[1:03:59] their life there used to be a balance in
[1:04:01] people's lives that god put in their
[1:04:04] lives that caused their human actions to
[1:04:08] come under control but those bars are
[1:04:11] being taken down they're being taken
[1:04:13] down in our schools they're being taken
[1:04:16] down by our politicians towards law
[1:04:18] enforcement they've been taken down
[1:04:20] towards common decency okay you know
[1:04:23] yeah people will go into a restaurant
[1:04:26] dressed so vulgar that it makes you
[1:04:28] hardly you can hardly eat your food
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:34] i mean it's not even cleansing
[1:04:36] how they
[1:04:38] they come in
[1:04:41] but
[1:04:43] i i i i
[1:04:45] what am i going to do let them put my
[1:04:47] light out
[1:04:51] am i going to let them
[1:04:52] am i going to let them choke my kindness
[1:04:55] choke my works to choke the love of god
[1:04:58] that should be shed abroad in my heart
[1:05:01] by the holy spirit
[1:05:09] what i'm saying is and i can i hope i
[1:05:11] can get it to you the human factors on
[1:05:14] the rise
[1:05:17] there used to be a
[1:05:19] a a society
[1:05:23] you know where you had you had social
[1:05:25] decency and the way that you did certain
[1:05:28] things there was a social life there was
[1:05:31] a society life you respected one another
[1:05:34] you took care of one another
[1:05:36] the prophet of god called it common
[1:05:38] decency
[1:05:40] as the enemy is eroding that
[1:05:45] and men are becoming lovers of pleasure
[1:05:48] more than lovers of god that that human
[1:05:52] part of man
[1:05:55] echad haiti used the terminology the
[1:05:58] animal part of man
[1:06:00] the brute beast in man the guy that'll
[1:06:04] cuss and drop
[1:06:06] bad words and take the lord's name in
[1:06:09] vain right out in public in a restaurant
[1:06:13] use cuss words uh come up children
[1:06:17] and amongst
[1:06:18] uh
[1:06:19] ladies everywhere that that this whole
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:25] i i guess this this people's rights
[1:06:28] lady ocean i'm a human
[1:06:35] and i'm going to do what i want to do
[1:06:36] i'm going to say what i want to do if
[1:06:38] you don't like it
[1:06:40] tough and and i got my right and i'm
[1:06:43] free what what happened
[1:06:46] to yeah i'm free
[1:06:48] but i'm going to respect your wife
[1:06:51] that's right
[1:06:52] i'm not going to cut in front of your
[1:06:54] way
[1:06:58] you know i'm not going to
[1:06:59] i'm not going to
[1:07:02] to do things i dealt with a young man
[1:07:04] today
[1:07:06] i could have judged him for a lot of
[1:07:08] things i'm sure you know his hair might
[1:07:10] have been a little
[1:07:11] long and
[1:07:12] you know if he didn't actually wear all
[1:07:14] the type of clothes i would but nice
[1:07:16] young man if he had enough decency about
[1:07:19] him he wouldn't sit down
[1:07:21] without asking me if he could sit down
[1:07:25] i thought you know lord put a star
[1:07:28] on his side
[1:07:30] give him a blessing
[1:07:32] you know what i mean
[1:07:34] it it's something when you see something
[1:07:38] else out there and the reason i'm saying
[1:07:40] this is because the challenge of the
[1:07:42] human factor is fixing to hit our lives
[1:07:48] worse than ever
[1:07:51] worse than ever and if we don't get
[1:07:53] caught up we're going to get in a war
[1:07:56] with it we're going to be in a battle
[1:07:58] with it it's going to discourage us it's
[1:08:00] going to bring us down it's going to rob
[1:08:03] us of our joy it's going to rob us of
[1:08:05] our peace and then you just think you
[1:08:08] think well i'm just going to go live out
[1:08:10] in the woods and you'll go out and live
[1:08:12] out in the woods and some herman will
[1:08:14] come and cap next door to you and give
[1:08:16] you a hard time
[1:08:20] you're we're not going to escape it
[1:08:22] right but we've got to come to the point
[1:08:25] that we are so solid in the word of god
[1:08:27] we understand what it is that we're
[1:08:30] representing what is our challenge and
[1:08:34] our our challenge is to rise above it
[1:08:36] and we'll will read another scripture
[1:08:39] and
[1:08:41] and be done so paul's talking here
[1:08:44] as meat to idols
[1:08:46] he says now
[1:08:48] he says
[1:08:50] now is touching things offered to idols
[1:08:52] we know that we all have knowledge
[1:08:55] knowledge puffeth up
[1:08:58] but charity
[1:08:59] edith
[1:09:02] and if any man think that he knoweth
[1:09:06] anything
[1:09:07] he knoweth nothing
[1:09:09] yet as he ought to know
[1:09:12] but if any man love god
[1:09:15] the same is known of him
[1:09:20] any man love god the same is known of
[1:09:23] him
[1:09:25] i don't want to be known by my reactions
[1:09:28] to
[1:09:32] humans because humans bug me
[1:09:36] humans make me think bad
[1:09:39] humans make me utter things
[1:09:42] under my breath
[1:09:43] humans
[1:09:45] are
[1:09:46] humans
[1:09:48] i can't forget that i too
[1:09:57] as concerning therefore the eating of
[1:09:59] those things that are offered
[1:10:02] in sacrifice unto idols
[1:10:04] we know
[1:10:06] that an idol is nothing
[1:10:08] in the world
[1:10:10] and that there is none other god but
[1:10:14] one for though there be
[1:10:18] that are called gods
[1:10:21] whether in heaven or in earth
[1:10:24] as there be god's many and lords many
[1:10:28] but to us there is but one god
[1:10:31] the father
[1:10:32] of whom are all things
[1:10:35] and we in him
[1:10:37] and one lord jesus christ
[1:10:40] by whom
[1:10:42] are all things and we buy him
[1:10:45] how be it there is not in every man that
[1:10:49] knowledge
[1:10:50] for some with conscious
[1:10:53] conscience
[1:10:54] of the idol
[1:10:56] unto this hour eat
[1:10:59] as a thing offered unto an idol
[1:11:02] and their conscience being weak is
[1:11:05] defiled
[1:11:07] but meat
[1:11:08] condemneth us not to god
[1:11:13] for neither if we eat
[1:11:16] are we better
[1:11:18] neither if we eat not
[1:11:20] are we the worst
[1:11:22] take heed lest by any means this liberty
[1:11:26] of yours become a stumbling block to
[1:11:30] them that are weak
[1:11:32] for if any men see
[1:11:34] thee which hath knowledge sit it meat
[1:11:39] in the idol's temple
[1:11:41] shall not the conscience of him which is
[1:11:44] weak
[1:11:45] be emboiled to eat those things
[1:11:48] embolden excuse me to eat those swings
[1:11:51] which are awful to idols and though
[1:11:55] and through thy knowledge shall the weak
[1:11:59] brother perish for whom christ died
[1:12:02] but when we
[1:12:04] but when ye
[1:12:05] sin so against the brethren
[1:12:10] and
[1:12:11] wound their weak conscience you sin
[1:12:14] against christ
[1:12:15] wherefore if meat make my brother to
[1:12:18] offend
[1:12:20] i will eat no flesh
[1:12:22] while the world standeth lest i make my
[1:12:26] brother
[1:12:27] to
[1:12:28] a fan
[1:12:30] what a consciousness
[1:12:33] what an awareness
[1:12:35] of
[1:12:36] really what your mission is
[1:12:39] really
[1:12:41] what what it is that
[1:12:43] that real christianity comes it's not
[1:12:46] living on to yourself it's living unto
[1:12:48] others is being aware of the decisions
[1:12:51] you make aware of the adjustments to
[1:12:53] make the the aware of whether you're
[1:12:55] stumbling somebody it's the recognition
[1:12:58] that there's people out there that are
[1:13:01] weak
[1:13:03] and their conscience is easily offended
[1:13:06] that they get offended very easily you
[1:13:09] say something they're offended their
[1:13:11] feelings get hurt if you have real
[1:13:13] feelings to get real hurt real easy you
[1:13:16] don't want to spend a lot of time around
[1:13:18] me because i'm a wrecking ball
[1:13:22] i don't mean to be that way
[1:13:25] you know i just say stuff and i just
[1:13:27] mean it jokingly you know what i mean
[1:13:29] and and
[1:13:31] you know i might come up to you and say
[1:13:33] you know there ain't much difference
[1:13:34] looking between you and a mule and a
[1:13:36] horse you know
[1:13:38] or you know it's a any old crazy thing
[1:13:40] just to be friendly but if you're easily
[1:13:42] offended right
[1:13:44] you know what i mean it can you get hurt
[1:13:48] i got to pull back
[1:13:52] wait a minute that's just human humans
[1:13:54] get easily offended i got to be careful
[1:13:56] i don't stumble
[1:13:58] there's an awareness about me in other
[1:14:01] words
[1:14:02] all of our christianity can't be
[1:14:04] doctrinal
[1:14:06] it all can't be
[1:14:08] it all can't be
[1:14:09] uh
[1:14:11] supernatural
[1:14:12] we can't all of a sudden think that
[1:14:14] we're above
[1:14:16] everybody else around us and and we're
[1:14:19] living with all this low life act and
[1:14:22] all these people that don't have
[1:14:24] knowledge and and and and
[1:14:27] if they knew what i knew then they
[1:14:29] wouldn't think the way that they think
[1:14:32] that's not what we're called to do
[1:14:35] we're called to say how do they think
[1:14:38] i'm going to adjust myself
[1:14:40] that i i don't offend them because if i
[1:14:43] offend the conscience of the weaker i
[1:14:45] offend the lord
[1:14:48] i'm not going to take what i'm capable
[1:14:50] of doing
[1:14:51] i don't care
[1:14:53] you might be
[1:14:55] you might be
[1:14:56] capable you know of of doing a certain
[1:15:00] activity that i could never do
[1:15:06] i got sucked into playing a board game
[1:15:08] one time
[1:15:10] this demonology game called risk
[1:15:15] well i got sucked into that game about
[1:15:18] three hours later i realized i was wiped
[1:15:20] out
[1:15:21] i condemned that game right there
[1:15:24] so no believer plays that game
[1:15:28] that game straight from the pits
[1:15:32] no you might be able to play that game
[1:15:35] don't invite me over
[1:15:38] don't offend me
[1:15:42] you know there's a lot of things you
[1:15:43] find out about people
[1:15:48] they don't live the way you do
[1:15:50] they don't live the way you do they
[1:15:53] don't have the holiness standards you
[1:15:55] have
[1:15:56] they don't have the drive for the gospel
[1:15:58] that you got they don't have the
[1:15:59] dedication
[1:16:01] to listening to tapes you have they
[1:16:03] don't have the dedication of reading the
[1:16:05] bible if you're not careful pretty soon
[1:16:10] they offend you
[1:16:13] and you start judging them
[1:16:16] what is it to you
[1:16:18] if he
[1:16:19] till i come
[1:16:21] follow me
[1:16:23] what i'm saying these little foxes
[1:16:26] this
[1:16:26] thing that goes unnoticed
[1:16:29] that's happening in our hearts
[1:16:32] and happening in our minds the effect
[1:16:34] that the human factor has on us if we're
[1:16:37] not careful it's going to keep us from
[1:16:40] attaining that capstone pyramid that
[1:16:44] we're all after
[1:16:47] isn't that what we're really after is
[1:16:49] perfect love you say why are we after
[1:16:51] perfect love because without perfect
[1:16:54] love you won't be there
[1:16:56] without conquering the human factor
[1:16:59] without conquering the effect that
[1:17:02] negative humans human actions human
[1:17:05] thinking human discernment human opinion
[1:17:09] without without being able to see it
[1:17:12] coming
[1:17:14] understand the trap of it
[1:17:17] re-like it doesn't have to affect you
[1:17:21] you can let things go
[1:17:24] you can turn the other cheat
[1:17:27] if they give a scriptural
[1:17:29] inquiry
[1:17:30] give them a scriptural answer pray that
[1:17:32] you might know how to answer all men
[1:17:37] but think it's not strange
[1:17:41] of the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:17:44] and who did most of those fiery darts
[1:17:46] come from
[1:17:51] i have not seen a devil
[1:17:53] floating around
[1:17:55] shooting arrows
[1:17:58] but i've seen it come off the lips of
[1:18:00] people the actions of people the
[1:18:03] unrighteousness of people the way people
[1:18:06] do things
[1:18:08] and this
[1:18:09] this struck my heart because
[1:18:13] i bought a person a gift one time
[1:18:16] very very nice gift i appreciated the
[1:18:19] brother he did a lot
[1:18:22] for me and he was a good friend
[1:18:24] and and he was quite the hunter
[1:18:27] so
[1:18:28] i got a bow and arrow
[1:18:31] uh form you know the best that i thought
[1:18:33] money could buy and talk to somebody and
[1:18:36] all that of course i gave it to him
[1:18:41] right
[1:18:43] so
[1:18:43] whose was it when i gave it to him
[1:18:47] it was his
[1:18:50] right it was mine while i had it
[1:18:53] but i gave it to him
[1:18:55] well
[1:18:56] am i gonna i got all tied up in a knot
[1:18:59] and i got all bummed out and i got all
[1:19:01] discouraged because
[1:19:04] he went and sold it
[1:19:09] well
[1:19:10] i probably would have given him the
[1:19:12] money
[1:19:14] but i let that's a humanism
[1:19:18] you understand he didn't think oh this
[1:19:20] was a gift from brother david and and i
[1:19:22] wanted him to be the gift you know and
[1:19:25] this is the gift brother david gave me
[1:19:27] and and
[1:19:28] you know look at this fine this fine
[1:19:32] gift here and i killed this deer with
[1:19:34] the bo brother david gave me
[1:19:38] okay so right in the whole thing was my
[1:19:40] humanism
[1:19:42] was all my humanism reacted in it so
[1:19:45] when he didn't react to my humanism i
[1:19:49] let his humanism give me and now the
[1:19:52] very thing that i set out to do
[1:19:55] got all messed up
[1:19:59] if i could have stood back
[1:20:01] and said okay he probably needed that
[1:20:04] money
[1:20:05] more than he needed about
[1:20:08] he was
[1:20:09] maybe under a very difficult
[1:20:12] circumstance in his life and this was a
[1:20:15] way out
[1:20:17] without embarrassing him or whatever i
[1:20:20] don't know the human factor but i can
[1:20:23] got to come to the place where i
[1:20:25] separate myself from what the human
[1:20:28] factor is
[1:20:30] it's everywhere
[1:20:33] i've got to set my wings
[1:20:35] and rise above it and let's read these
[1:20:37] last scriptures
[1:20:39] as we close this evening on just a
[1:20:41] little middle of the week
[1:20:45] bible study
[1:20:47] so that
[1:20:49] uh
[1:20:50] you know we don't always have to
[1:20:52] have a great big
[1:20:54] sermon let's turn to matthew
[1:20:58] and brother steve can come up and
[1:21:00] get ready to lead us in a couple
[1:21:03] songs for
[1:21:12] it's a great read just to go back and
[1:21:16] and read the uh
[1:21:19] the sermon on the mount
[1:21:21] and and the
[1:21:24] the five
[1:21:25] uh
[1:21:26] five six and seventh chapters of matthew
[1:21:29] but let's turn to matthew
[1:21:31] the fifth chapter
[1:21:39] and the awareness
[1:21:41] of the human factor
[1:21:43] let's read in matthew
[1:21:46] 5. i just hope tonight these words
[1:21:49] will sink in and come to your thought
[1:21:52] in your mind in circumstances that come
[1:21:55] around you the musicians you can come to
[1:21:58] so let's turn and read this in closing
[1:22:00] to see me it says
[1:22:02] and if any men sue thee
[1:22:05] at the law
[1:22:07] and take away
[1:22:09] thy coat
[1:22:11] let him have
[1:22:12] thy cloak also tell me that ain't a
[1:22:15] human factor
[1:22:18] if somebody sues
[1:22:22] you at the law
[1:22:26] for thy coat
[1:22:27] let him have thy cloak also
[1:22:31] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[1:22:35] mile
[1:22:36] go with him twain
[1:22:39] give to him that asked thee
[1:22:43] and from him
[1:22:44] that would borrow he have heard
[1:22:47] it hath been said
[1:22:49] thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:22:52] and hate thy enemy
[1:22:55] but i send you love your enemies
[1:22:59] bless them
[1:23:01] that curse you
[1:23:02] do good to them that hate you
[1:23:07] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:23:10] you and persecute you
[1:23:12] now that is overcoming the human factor
[1:23:17] because all those things he talked about
[1:23:20] are what humans do
[1:23:23] and this is what he's telling us
[1:23:26] because he wants us to be perfect as
[1:23:29] your father which is in heaven is
[1:23:30] perfect but i sand you love your enemies
[1:23:34] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:23:37] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:23:39] which despitefully use you
[1:23:42] and persecute you
[1:23:44] that ye may be the children of your
[1:23:47] father which is in heaven
[1:23:50] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:23:53] evil
[1:23:56] and on the good
[1:23:58] and sendeth rain
[1:24:00] on the just and on the unjust
[1:24:04] for if we love them
[1:24:06] which love you
[1:24:08] for if ye love them which love you
[1:24:12] what reward have ye
[1:24:14] do not even the publicans the same
[1:24:18] now this is the separation of humanism
[1:24:23] we're never going to send the message of
[1:24:26] the gospel
[1:24:28] the evidence of the baptism of the holy
[1:24:30] spirit
[1:24:31] no matter how rich religious we are
[1:24:34] until we can get the spirit of god in us
[1:24:38] that separates us from the humanism
[1:24:44] we love them that hate us
[1:24:48] how many loves to love them that hate
[1:24:50] you no you don't
[1:24:54] but how can you say that you love god
[1:24:57] and hate your brother
[1:24:59] love a god you can't see
[1:25:01] at the end and
[1:25:03] after and and
[1:25:05] say
[1:25:07] you know
[1:25:08] and say you hate your brother who you do
[1:25:10] see
[1:25:12] and that that's that's the point
[1:25:16] i know i'm fundam you know making it
[1:25:19] elementary because i want it to reach
[1:25:21] everybody but this is what's happening
[1:25:24] because the separation from the publican
[1:25:28] the separation from the sinner the only
[1:25:31] thing that separates you
[1:25:33] from anybody else is not the religion
[1:25:36] that's going on in your mind
[1:25:39] it's not your doctrines
[1:25:42] it's not your teachings it's your
[1:25:46] ability to separate yourself from human
[1:25:50] action
[1:25:54] that's where it stands
[1:25:57] and it's not easy
[1:25:59] but that's what's given
[1:26:01] to the overcomer
[1:26:03] to him that overcometh
[1:26:06] i will have him sit with me in my
[1:26:09] father's throne be really aware of what
[1:26:13] it is that we're having to overcome
[1:26:16] because it's coming for us
[1:26:19] it's coming forth people are changing
[1:26:22] their attitudes and workplace business
[1:26:24] people people are just out flat out not
[1:26:27] paying people now
[1:26:29] they're they're they're they're that
[1:26:31] they'll
[1:26:32] they'll they'll crook you they'll lie
[1:26:34] you they'll they'll all kinds of things
[1:26:37] that they'll say all manner of evil
[1:26:39] against you and jesus reviled not when
[1:26:42] he was spoken up you know what he he
[1:26:44] held his peace we could read many
[1:26:47] scriptures but the the evidence is we
[1:26:50] talk a lot about the evidence we want
[1:26:52] all the evidence to be in the
[1:26:54] supernatural but what good does it do if
[1:26:57] we have all this super natural evidence
[1:26:59] which the world doesn't believe and
[1:27:02] doesn't see if we can't show them a
[1:27:05] light in the world that they're living
[1:27:08] and that's where he said is to let your
[1:27:11] light shine in darkness and jesus was
[1:27:13] the light of men and why was he the
[1:27:16] light of man because he overcame the
[1:27:18] world
[1:27:21] that was his testimony he overcame
[1:27:24] humanism
[1:27:26] he turned the other chief what do you
[1:27:28] think the world is it's humanism another
[1:27:32] week
[1:27:34] we can accept
[1:27:36] other people's humanism but we don't
[1:27:38] want to accept our humanism we want to
[1:27:41] bring our humanism under subjection and
[1:27:44] be christlike
[1:27:46] we want to get to where
[1:27:48] what he's talking about here
[1:27:51] how do you be like your father in heaven
[1:27:54] you can't let everybody burn you all the
[1:27:57] time
[1:27:59] you can't be offended
[1:28:02] blessed is he
[1:28:04] who is not offended in me
[1:28:06] you can't form clicks you can't talk
[1:28:09] about people you can't do these little
[1:28:11] things
[1:28:13] that eat you up spiritually because i
[1:28:16] really think it's time to climb don't
[1:28:18] you
[1:28:20] he said if you love
[1:28:22] if you
[1:28:23] 46 for if you love them which
[1:28:26] love you what reward have ye
[1:28:30] do not even the publicans the same
[1:28:34] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:28:38] what do you more than others
[1:28:42] do not even
[1:28:44] the publicans so
[1:28:46] be therefore perfect
[1:28:49] even as your father
[1:28:52] which in heaven
[1:28:55] is perfect
[1:28:58] you know you you you look at
[1:29:01] all the great things that
[1:29:04] are going into the statue
[1:29:07] of a perfect man
[1:29:10] you get up to godliness and
[1:29:13] to be like god
[1:29:15] and it's finally capped off with perfect
[1:29:17] love
[1:29:20] perfect love
[1:29:21] brotherly kindness
[1:29:24] those are the virtues
[1:29:26] that keep the negative effect
[1:29:29] of humanism
[1:29:31] working in our lives
[1:29:33] it's what causes you
[1:29:35] to create an atmosphere
[1:29:39] because they wonder what is this hope
[1:29:42] why do you act different why don't you
[1:29:44] gossip like the rest of the girls why
[1:29:46] aren't you mean
[1:29:48] sure it's easy to pick out somebody
[1:29:51] that's a little uh less
[1:29:54] talented
[1:29:56] or socially skilled
[1:29:59] than you are
[1:30:00] and make fun of them
[1:30:02] that don't make you popular
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:07] you know to tease somebody about their
[1:30:09] weight or the
[1:30:11] the way their hair is or their no hair
[1:30:14] or whatever
[1:30:16] none of that that
[1:30:20] there's just a place
[1:30:22] that we can rise up where there's a
[1:30:24] freedom
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:27] and and there's a freedom in having the
[1:30:29] love of god in your heart
[1:30:31] being pitiful
[1:30:33] you know i mean
[1:30:35] and having pity and
[1:30:38] realizing you know that
[1:30:40] people show up and they don't tell the
[1:30:42] truth and they say they can do things
[1:30:44] that they really can't do
[1:30:47] and you just gotta take a deep breath
[1:30:52] say lord it's just the world
[1:30:54] it's just humans
[1:30:57] the prophet of god talked about letting
[1:30:59] off the pressure
[1:31:01] he says people are just going
[1:31:04] they're they're speeding up and down the
[1:31:06] streets they've gone mad don't let it
[1:31:09] strike you church
[1:31:11] realize when you walk out these doors i
[1:31:14] hope that it'll set in your hearts
[1:31:16] tonight that you understand you're just
[1:31:19] gonna have to deal with the world
[1:31:21] because you're in the world
[1:31:23] but you're not of the world
[1:31:26] but you're overcomers
[1:31:28] of this world and that's been our great
[1:31:31] portion god bless you let's stand
[1:31:33] tonight
[1:31:45] maybe tonight just as we're
[1:31:47] gonna close and
[1:31:51] maybe i wasn't able tonight to
[1:31:54] draw it as clear as
[1:31:56] i realized it is with me and
[1:32:04] you know it it's always in your life i
[1:32:07] got a new chest of drawers and
[1:32:10] so i put my socks on the top drawer and
[1:32:17] unless he felt they were too high so she
[1:32:19] put him on the
[1:32:20] next drawer down where i could see him
[1:32:24] well i want him on the top drawer
[1:32:27] well she thinks they'd be better on it
[1:32:29] so you know what okay
[1:32:32] that's fine they're just socks
[1:32:37] i only wear socks to church
[1:32:41] i don't care what drawer the socks are
[1:32:43] in
[1:32:44] stop a minute
[1:32:46] you know what i mean
[1:32:47] if
[1:32:49] if she feels the socks should be on the
[1:32:52] second drawer instead of the top door
[1:32:54] great
[1:32:56] you know
[1:32:56] she's shorter than i am at the eyes
[1:32:59] so she can't see him
[1:33:02] well who really folds them
[1:33:05] who washes them who puts them up
[1:33:10] she does
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:14] i don't do my own socks sister so
[1:33:16] if you got a husband that does his own
[1:33:18] socks you thank god
[1:33:21] forums
[1:33:24] now you guys ought to do your own socks
[1:33:27] and not make your mama do them
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:34] but yeah because someday you might live
[1:33:37] alone you know what i mean you'll find
[1:33:39] out that you get tired of wearing them
[1:33:41] dirty old socks
[1:33:42] you know you've got to wash them now and
[1:33:44] then but what i'm saying is
[1:33:46] we don't even put on the mind of christ
[1:33:49] if humanism reacting to humanism
[1:33:53] just bad we're so quick to answer so
[1:33:55] quick to defend
[1:33:58] so quick to take a position
[1:34:01] we don't got no position
[1:34:04] we just want him
[1:34:06] we want his love
[1:34:08] shed abroad in our heart
[1:34:10] by the holy spirit if you'd like more of
[1:34:13] of him
[1:34:15] let's just bow our heads you lift your
[1:34:16] heart you don't have to lift your hand
[1:34:18] unless you want to
[1:34:20] you really want to let him know
[1:34:23] but
[1:34:24] you want to rise above humanism
[1:34:30] and you want to walk not after the flesh
[1:34:34] but after the spirit
[1:34:37] and you want to mind spiritual things
[1:34:41] because the carnal mind is
[1:34:44] at enmity with god's thinking
[1:34:47] but you want to put this mind in you
[1:34:49] that was in christ
[1:34:51] that every man looketh upon the
[1:34:54] thoughts and the needs of others
[1:34:56] before himself
[1:34:58] now we're getting into real bride
[1:35:00] material
[1:35:02] and you just like to say lord i really
[1:35:04] like to be able to respond better
[1:35:08] i'd like to be able to read back better
[1:35:10] i i'd like to have a greater awareness
[1:35:12] of the human factor
[1:35:15] and if there's a human factor then
[1:35:17] there's got to be a word factor
[1:35:20] there's got to be a scriptural approach
[1:35:23] there's got to be a spiritual mind
[1:35:26] for every matter lord and i want that to
[1:35:29] be first in my heart
[1:35:31] i want to be first in my mind i want it
[1:35:33] to be first in my life
[1:35:36] father i really want to grow
[1:35:38] lord and i want to rise above
[1:35:40] the human factor
[1:35:42] heavenly father as we lift our hands and
[1:35:44] we approach you
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:47] you know the human part of every single
[1:35:50] one of us
[1:35:52] that's why you provided forgiveness
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:56] that's why you say do unto others as you
[1:35:58] would have them do unto you
[1:36:00] that's why you said if you're compelled
[1:36:02] to go the mile go twain
[1:36:05] so many things you spoke of
[1:36:08] about speaking not again blessed are ye
[1:36:11] when all men shall speak evil of you
[1:36:14] for my name's sake
[1:36:17] great is your reward
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:20] father forgive us our trespasses as we
[1:36:22] forgive those that trespass against us
[1:36:25] so many places out to the scriptures in
[1:36:28] fact sometimes the whole scriptures just
[1:36:31] seem to cry out at us with instructions
[1:36:35] how to overcome the human factor
[1:36:38] lord and that's our desire tonight
[1:36:41] as this church
[1:36:43] lord that
[1:36:47] our sound doctrine would be accompanied
[1:36:50] by a sound spiritual spirit
[1:36:53] of divine love

[1:36:57] to us
