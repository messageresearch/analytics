Description:
The Promise Of A Body Change
Br. Billy Mbuyi
August 28, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

again tonight calling upon the same name father we heard you this morning and our hearts are on flame oh god and we pray father that you speak to us once again tonight father it's in the cool of the evening that you would come and you will speak to your son and and father that you would reveal more of yourself to him and and of your plan lord we ask that you do that even tonight lord father we're so thankful lord we commit everything to your hands and ask us things in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] amen god bless you i mean let's open our bibles if you could just lower the bass a little bit it's ringing in first corinthians chapter 15. let's start from uh uh verse 50. it says now this i say veteran that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither do corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in the moment in a twinkie of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead on christ shall rise shall shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality so when this corruption shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory and then he continues on it says o death words thy sting and all grave ways thy victory it says the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is law but thanks be to god which giveth us victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the lord let's just buy our heads our gracious father we're so thankful lord to know that our efforts are not in vain to know that father obedience in trying all that we can the best that we can lord it's counted father your prophet said that there's not a thing that you've ever taken in your hands and never return a hundred-fold lord even the efforts of man if what we try to do lord you still count that we commit what we are into your hands and as in the name of jesus christ that you bless your word to us amen i have your seeds also if you could turn in hebrews 11. hebrews chapter 11 it says verse 1 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtain a good report it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made when we're not made of things that do appear it says in four it says by faith abel offered up unto god an excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his own gift by it being dead yet speaketh it says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for he for before his translation he had this testimony that had pleased god but without faith it's impossible to please him for him that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i want you to notice it says there's an element of seeking like what we heard this morning there's an element of seeking there's an element of of of work that is not in vain it says that enoch has regretted five it says full before his translation he had this testimony that he had pleased god and we could say if that be that he had pleased god so in order for you to be translated you have to please god that's the prerequisite you you have to please god in order to be for you to be translated and you cannot please god without you cannot have the faith to please god without the word so when the word comes it gives you the opportunity for you to have faith and therefore please god and so if we just speak for a moment i want to speak on the promise of a body change the promise of a body change but before we go on uh just some of the things that a pastor made a statement that so much stuck with my mind the whole afternoon i was just thinking about it where it says when he read that uh scripture that says where we we have to finance us where god's word belongs in our life where does god's words belong in our lives and and verbatim speaks in this message god's only provided place of worship he says that it speaks about even the time that we're living in and and specifically targeting what we call or what we know to be the adoption of sons it says it says in paragraph 262 it says lutheran and it says under justification the feet raised raise it up like that wesley under sanctification the pentecostals under the arm it says the works and the deed and so forth had to be calvinist it says oh or it had to be armenians it says had to be a legalist but now it says we come to the head the capstone grace grace the the capstone cried the headstone crying what grace grace passed from death and creeds into the leaving word of god into the living word of god into the living word of the living god god's only provided plan for his age his son in the word age quickened by the spirit like it sparks that's let off something to make it alive seated now in heavenly places in present tense alive and subject to every promise in the word oh so this is the very description of what our pastor talked about where we are and what we are sitting under so yeah we are led by the word of god the word of the living god by his own living word every says subject it says in heavenly places already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what does it do it says you being part of god's gene are part of the word in in it says others it says other men are part of god's word seated together manifesting manifest the entire body of christ it says because there is no leaven among you see what you've taken about brother brown he says no leaven among you just the word only seated in heavenly places in in the door where you put his name jesus christ so here we are now is speaking specifically where we are seated together when we say we are sitting in heavenly places it's the blessings of god that surround us it's the manifestation of god that are surrounding us it's he's taken us and placed us into the body of christ and how do we come into the body we are born into this body this is not a body that we just come and sign our books our name on the book and we become a member but no born in christ jesus to be in this body where we are seated in heavenly places where all the promises belong to us where everything is under our subject where he's placed us in him now i i didn't get a chance to print this out but there's a place where bhararanam is asking a question and is asking he says how did we how come how did we become in him how are we in him he says well even how are we manifested in him he says now you have to remember in the beginning god was a spirit that covered all time in space he says but all the attribute of who god was remember the fullness of who god was was poured into christ so therefore when christ went into calvary he went to calvary with every attribute every plan of god that ever was to be manifested was in him so therefore when he died you died with him and when he resurrected you resurrected with him why because the fullness of god was in him and we are part of that fullness and now what he's doing in this end time is taking that fullness is now pouring into his body you that were once in sins so you know we're wanting all kinds of things all kinds of trespassing everything you as you brought up together to come into the manifestation of this body so today the bride is the manifestation of the body of christ to be manifested in the end time because we realize if the body is the body of christ and the body is a supernatural body if his body is life then the flesh has to be made with the same element that the body is made of well but it says the body of christ is not a cell of an animal mixed with the cell of a human no just as we one would have a son and the son will be the same characteristics or made of the same material as the father if christ the body is the word so is the body to be exactly the word it's not a cell of an animal mixed with the cell of a human but it's the cell of the word mixed upon word upon word upon word why to manifest the same manifestation that the head did human cell upon human cell word upon word the manifestation of himself he says here again in uh uh what is the holy spirit given for he says we are now we are we are in a day now it says back then there wasn't uh there wasn't half as smart as today it says they couldn't make an atomic bomb and and uh uh automobile it says uh they didn't have the science and the things that we have now but it says but all things of mysterious things uh it says to try to say some men blowed up together by some dust and so forth and take some analysis and try to prove it to make infidels out of people but now he says when we need it the spirit of god raises a standard it says what is it he's pouring in he's pouring in his spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of god it says under the altar of god as the scripture says are crying how long lord how long how much how much longer god's waiting for me and you the church is waiting on you and me adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness now i was just thinking as even a pastor we we we really within ourselves we have to come to an understanding that this is not the age where you you just receive the baptism of the holy ghost and that's the end of it this is the age where god he's interested in pouring everything that he ever was in the beginning this is the age of the fullness of god manifested in his people where he's trying to pull his fullness so in order for him to pull his fullness in us we have to empty out of ourselves so we can let him pull and pour himself into us in order for us to see his fullness manifested in us there has to be some dying out within ourselves so we can let him pour off what he is into us so we can be coming into his image he says his fullness his power his resurrection it says that's when the church when he says that's when the church and christ become so close together till christ become visibly among us and raise the dead and it says and we go into the rapture so this rapture is not happening just as a oh you know just one walking and not paying attention but there has to be some dedication to where there is some pouring out of ourselves and some pouring in of him they some empty out of ourselves so we can be filled with him this rapture is only happening when we come to the realization of what our goal is and what our objective is when we begin to work towards those things when we're going to put attention and effort into knowing that this is what i'm called to be manifesting and i'm working towards that so god can come and manifest it because otherwise he says well you know we'll wait until god does it i'll just walk and if he wants to do it he'll do it god wants to do it and he's proven in his word that this is the hour for it the question is what is it you and i doing about it and and let me just say this the reveal word of the end time has to create an expectation within the heart of the believer this message is not just sent for us to learn it and and to be able to express it and talk about it intellectually and rejoice over the quotes and the things now this message is sent in order for it to transform a people for a rapture that is to come if we know that the rapturing faith is in the world then the word has to transform us into that rapturing faith the reveal word of the end time has to create a desperation in other words when i see what god has promised what he says that we're supposed to be at the end time when he talks about the restoration of all that was in the beginning when he talks about even as we heard it this morning when he comes and he talks about the placing of sons and the adoption i have within myself has to hunger for it i have to become desperate for it in other words i have to consider that word that was spoken greater than anything out there i have to consider it greater than anything i desire in order for me to become it you you don't become something without any effort you don't become a doctor without going to school without putting work and without stunning your your books and passing exams and doing all those things so therefore if we're going to go out of here in the rapture we have been given a word that will provide rapturing faith therefore we can eat of that word become of that word ask for the god who provided the word as el paso said it so he can give us that burning bush experience to make each and every word become personal to us so we can come into the condition that will provide the rapture we we want to see the manifestation of the promise our sacramento prophet speaks about uncle body robinson he said they will go and he went and he read in the bible how that god promised the holy ghost and and he went into the field and he kneeled down and said that i'm not going to stand up here until you give me the holy ghost so there has to be uh some perseverance and people that's uh decided they've burned all the bridges they've left everything and they've come together for the manifestation of something and the devil what he tries to do is just to come around even as we're ready this morning and said oh all is fine you don't have to do anything you just sit there and just listen day in and day out and go home and just listen it's going to come to pass by itself no there has to be someone stand up and say i heard the word and now i want to see the manifestation of it there has to be someone saying they said i'm tired of myself i'm tired of what i see in the mirror i can't keep going the way i'm giving the word has been given to me the word has been spoken to me therefore god i want the manifestation of this in my life otherwise we are not different from any other denomination down the street who just comes and learns about the scriptures and about the promise how that god is kind and all the things that he can do no but there has to be a people they have seen what the word is about their eyes have been opened to see it and let me say this if god opened your eyes to see it it's so you can go and get it [Music] it's the same with the promised land when they went and they saw those things that if it wasn't for you you would have not seen it if it wasn't for you your eyes would have been shut you would have been some churches down the road you could have been at home you could have been all doing all kinds of things but the reason why you came back tonight the reason why you're sitting here tonight is because god open your eyes and if he opens your eyes it's because it's for you to receive it so we want the message to take the first place within our lives we want the word the living to be living our lives under the expectation to be living our lives under the the expectation of of god moving upon us anytime and and god moving and bringing his word to come to pass and when we wake up in the morning my mind is on the word and my thoughts is on the word everything i do is on the word why because i'm expecting that in any moment any twinkling of an eye i'll be called for the change of the body you wanna you won't get the change of the body unless you're looking for the change of body it's not you going about your business and not thinking anything about it the scripture says i inaudible god enoch walked with god and it was pleasing to god why because he he counted the things of this world of no good to him anymore he didn't he didn't uh uh he didn't value them the use the way he used to value them anymore his mind and his heart was on those things and and he woke up one morning and he began to walk with god and he was not found and it wasn't just it's not just a and happened chance and an enoch no he walked with god meaning the word that was given for him for his age he walked with it he he prayed it and he let that word become him and he believed every promise until that promise became a reality to him thinking about what a pastor talked about a couple of years a couple of months ago or a couple of weeks ago i would say we heard it on a tape about the uh girl at the range yes she was and she perhaps was made fun of she was she was just washing dishes and and yes it was all the other girls are dressed nice and they had all that they needed they came and when she told them that she was she had a promise that there was this there was this the the young man who came and talked to her and promised her that he was going to come back they made fun of her but all everything she did her mind was always on that day that she's gonna that he's gonna show up they made fun of her absolutely they laughed and they said there's no way he he didn't talk to you you dreamed this this is this is it's impossible that he will come back for you but she doesn't whatever her she just was humble and made fun of and all those things and the scripture says you shall be hated in this world when we say the things that we believe no one is going to believe you you don't expect anybody to come and say oh you're believing the truth that's going on no they're going to make fun of you they're going to laugh at you why look at you with those long skirts and look at you with all those things but what they're forgetting is those things are putting you in preparation for the body change that's around the corner and when it happens you'll be gone but how will be how will you be gone if you don't obey what was given to you now imagine this girl in the range forgetting all about that was told about her and just leaving her life the way she wanted she would have missed the promise but every time she was laughed at she remembered she had a promise the promise was not made by those that were laughing the promise was not made by the scoffers and all of those the promise was made by the young man and that's who he she was waiting for and the promise that was given to you is not made by any man the promise that's given to you is made by the lord jesus himself and that's who you're waiting for so we have to live under the expectation of the end time to know that our body our lives and we're going to go in a body change any time because the scoffers the scripture says the scoffers and the markers are going to come and the lasso says where is the promise of his coming it seems like since our father slept everything is just continuing the same it seems like since our prophet went well it just seems like everything continues the same it seems like it says we're going to continue on the cycle of revival and death and today we want revival tomorrow we feel like we're dead it's just going to continue but don't light that word for you because we understand it's in the time that's the most unexpected that's when he shows up it's the time where people are falling asleep and a time where people are casting it away a time where people are distracted that's the time that it shows up and i want to say this living under expectation changes your life when you live under the expectation of something it causes you to live differently i remember when we were expecting our i'm not sure if our first child and you know we'll well everything that we did was based on when is the timing going to be you know oh let's do this no we can't go out of town because the baby's going to come anytime we can't do this because the baby may come any time you become restricted by the promise by which you are waiting for i and i remember even when the time came i was i was up studying that night and i was studying and and i just finished i went and took a shower went to bed it's only 30 minutes after i hop in bed that's when the time was there it always comes in an unexpected time it's never a time that you plan and i believe it's the type of what we need to expect when the lord is going to come it's not us just any man waiting and saying well i'm waiting and he's going to come show up no he's going to come in an unexpected way this event is going to take place and some will be left behind that's what the scripture tells us but living under that expectation changes the way that you live and we know the prophet preaches a message things that are to be if if we were told today that there is going to come another covet within another week that they were going to shut down everything we'll do things differently than the way we did it first if we were told that covert is around the corner that everything will be shut perhaps we'll try to go back and we'll examine what we did at first and perhaps we'll this time try to go for the toilet paper before we can grab the food why because we've learned by experience we because because because we have been given the news it gives us a chance to prepare better and the prophet speaks about this it says god can do nothing except he reveals his mind to the prophet except he gives this prophet the word and we know the very definition of a prophet is one who's been given an eyesight to see what's coming before it's there and and we have even within this church we have gone through messages after messages describing the very period that we've gone on everything by letter of what the prophet promised that would come to pass and and the prophet tells us that it's the revealed word of god that puts us under expectation it's the word of god being revealed that's supposed to put us in motion so the motion is not just a man reading the bible and saying well what will i do with it but when god takes his word and reveals it to you that word has to put you under expectation he has to put you in motion he has to cause you to activate yourself so you can meet what he says he will do but yet we are so often time we have what he says we have the whole word of god being revealed to us he says we have the perfect interpretation of the word in this end time but oftentimes i feel like expectation of falling short of what we should be living by to just come to a place where you realize i have been given the word we have been told what's about to come the promise of a body change is around the corner if we're living for the body change then the life that we live has to reflect that we are living for the body change then the things that we engage in has to reflect that this person is living an expectation for that body change to take on any time so the prophet speaks about abraham and sarah he speaks about abraham and sarah and this is in regards to the body being changed and he speaks about this it says in the message of the feast of the trumpet it says notice what happened happen immediately should turn back to the lovely young woman showing in there portraying what's going what he's going to do what is going to what what is going to do the royal seed of abraham to re to receive the sons that's been promised should turn back to a young it says look they went down to gerrard and what happened abhimalek the king fell in love with her she it says she's fair and beautiful it says she was going he says and was going to marry her is that right the old grandma all of them other pretty girls down there granny she's beautiful she's a fair look she's fair to look upon it says god changed her body abraham and sarah didn't change their own body but i want you to remember they were living under the expectation of this baby coming and and the prophet said yeah they are but they weren't in fact even we can uh uh just to summarize the story we know when the promise was given god came and visited them uh spoke to them many times and and in all kinds of ways and yet they are because they were living under the expectation they went and they bought everything that they needed in preparation for the baby coming the prophet tells us what they did and they went and they prepared a room for the baby and they brought crips and they brought all kinds of things and and yet people were looking at them thinking they're crazy they have lost their mind but this is the action of one who's received a word from god this is the action of whom one was heard from god they're living under the expectation of what god told them regardless of what people will think about them and but random speaks about it at length and said yes she was a milk vein was dried up and she had no strength that she could give she could give birth to a baby but yet she received a promise of god and she lived under the expectation of the promise that was given to her and the expectation of the promise made that she made a room ready the expectation of the promise caused that she went and bought everything that was needed for a baby why because she knew that the baby will come anytime oh my brother my sister don't we know that to change your body will happen at any time the scripture says it's in a twinkling of an eye that what caused the change what caused the change was the promise that was given to them what caused the change was they have received the word of god and they were living in expectation for that word to become a reality in their lives oh if we can live under the expectation of the word that we have received today to be ready to know that this will happen anytime it says god changed her body and turned them back it says it's a it's a mystery that is to be revealed now in this time in this day but what i'm now saying this is not just something that happened that god did one time and and that was the end of it no he's now letting you know that god did it because he knew that there would come a seat of abraham at the end time that god will have to change their bodies too god will come and he promised that he will give them another body and they would have to live under the same expectation as sarah and abraham live that they would have to have the same faith that sarah and abraham had god changed her body it says it's the mystery that has to be revealed in this end time by the son of man it says see the evening message see turn back and that was the last sign that they seen what the discernment before the change of the body came and before we can ever receive the sun what happens the trump of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first and the new body he says and we which alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah and we shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air it says the secret has been made known the seals are open amen what is the whole secret the god is coming in the same time what changed the body the change of body didn't come until the manifestation of god in the human flesh standing before abraham and performing the sign of the messiah when they saw that sign that caused the body to be changed for them to be ready for the coming of the son oh my brother my sister if god opened up the secret in the time of abraham that same secret has been made known to us so that we can know by this message that we believe that the sign of the messiah that was produced in our time god coming in the human flesh and making himself known standing there to do the same sign is not a sign so we can say oh we've seen jesus and that's wonderful no it's a sign to cause the body change says the trump shall sound this trump sounded for israel and the two prophets is ready to appear what is it the church must be off must get off the scene right now so they can appear he can't deal with two of at the same time he never did the scripture says in first thessalonians chapter 4 15 it says for this for this we say unto thee unto you by the word of god that that which it says that that which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then it says then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him with him in the clouds it says to meet the lord in the air so shall we be ever with the lord and so as we can see this promise is now given to get us ready to say that the lord himself shall descend and we know that the prophet preached the message the rapture and he went into the order of the rapture to show what the voice was what the shout was and and what all those things were so but he is wanting to show that these things are given to us to get us in preparation for the event that is to come and if we don't eat of it if we don't become what they said if we don't eat of the word and we don't manifest the things that the word says then how we're going to be ready for the event what what gets us ready for the event is the fact that god is here to manifest every promise that he has given so we can get ready for that event the prophet said in the message rapture and says it says in three three things happen a voice and a shout and and it says a voice in the trump he says has to happen before jesus christ appeared it says now the shout jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout what is a shout it says it's the message going forth first the living bread of the the living bread of life bringing forth the bride the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so therefore we are here because we've been brought there's been a word that went to gather us from all the corners of the earth bringing forth the bride there was a message that went forth and when we heard it something within our heart pricked and the prophet says it so beautifully in the rising of the sun it says yet we are he says you that were once drunken and sinners and everything but the rising of the sun has caused something within your heart to be stand up to stand up and to answer back the call of the sun he says that the sun when he rose up it dried up the ground it dried up everything it took away all of the things that were hiding you away from the sun so it can bring you into the manifestation of the sun what the sun was calling therefore the seed had to come forth he asked a question he says they asked him a question it says but ronan please explain acts 9 and verse 7 or acts 20 and 22 verse would you get this for me brother neville says explain acts 9 and 7 it says now while we are getting on that i'll see if i can get another one right quick it says are you getting tired i know he says please explain the mystery of translation of the bride how it says how will it take place where uh the place and the and the bride goes it says isn't them lovely question it says that's really nice i'll just stand here all day it says just a minute let me just skip and send an amen which journey with them so let me start from paragraph uh 238 it says now i know i i says i know where you're going i know where you're going it says now the next place it says vice versa i don't know what to take what what take what taken place here i just couldn't tell you um because the next place uh they hear uh one of them they didn't see it it says the next place they seen it and they did hear it how many how many has ever seen has ever seen that before in the bible it says i have i can't explain it the lord will have to reveal them to me let me just skip so i can get to what i'm looking for let me go to paragraph 242. it says please explain the mystery of translation of the bride it says just to change just to change see our bodies it says let's say you know what it says you know what i mean when i say that i don't mean to be sacrilegious i don't mean to say ours i don't mean to say this church i mean to say every believer he says abraham was looking for a promised son that was promised him is that right and the church is looking for a promised son the bride is that right the bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to sarah and abraham their bodies had to be changed is that right he says she was too old to have a baby she had no milk vein in her breast her breast was dried up her womb wasn't fertile fertile it says she was sterile she could not have the baby he says our heart was too old to stand labor so she said so what happened oh i love this now he's giving you all the condition possible that this can never happen and and often time i looked at it because remember it's the same type of us we look at ourselves and says well i have so many weaknesses i have this and i have that and and and i do this and i have to do that so you lay out all your excuses and it's letting you do that go on pour out all your excuses why you can't have a son show all that you can you pour it out all out and then after you finish it says god change her back to a young woman it's not about us changing ourselves it's about us being committed to god's plan to know that he's here to change us and if we need changing we got to be committed to the plan it's like being committed to uh you know because i thought you know let me just use this as an example i'll get back you know we we we oftentimes when we read about this translation of a body i thought oh you know perhaps we just need to look at the natural example you know we we experience body changes every time we expand we contract and you know we do all of those things but you cannot you and and and every time whether you expand or contract is an effort that you put in you know if you put an effort in eating too much you expand it's a body change when you when you want to change and get thinner you have to put an effort into working out some form of something and going into the gym doing some work none of which will happen by itself there has to be some effort put in because oftentimes we try to spiritualize everything but we realize that the very natural things are showing us what god is really telling us we we expand and we contract based on the effort that we put in you know and as you get old sometimes all you have to do is to smell food in order to gain weight you know it's just it it just happens but you realize that wait wait if you if you want your body to be in shape it can never be in check by itself you got to put some effort into it you got to eat right you got to sleep right you got to uh uh put some iron and and do some exercises in order for you to be in shape otherwise you get the result of whatever effort you're putting in and therefore years the bible has given us but god changed him why because they were committed to god's plan of changing and how did they show their commitment they went and bought the crib they went and told all their neighbors about the baby coming they wanted to do everything that they could in other words what men could do they did everything that they could do they did why they did their part and waited for god to do his part but random says if you say go see a doctor let him examine you let him do what he can do he can advise something and all those things but when the doctor comes to an end when it comes to where he can no longer do anything for you when it comes to where he's giving you bad news what one of them says you have the right to petition a higher physician you have the right to go to god and say now i went to the doctor like you said and this is what he gave me and i don't accept what he told me now i come to you the great physician and i have the right to petition you we see the body change every day and therefore we have to know it says that god god changed her back to a young woman it says he did it abraham the same thing because he said his body was as good as dead now i want you to remember this was not necessarily just changing them young again because they were young at one time they still couldn't have a son they were at the age where they could have had a son and they still didn't have god came and they changed the elements that's why i love that message who's this melchizedek so much he was the creator of heaven and earth we knew him as that he was the one who came and he manifested himself as jehovah we knew him as that so why was he so important that he can come as melchizedek the reason is melchizedek why they had to come with melchizedek is from is because of where melchizedek came from melchizedek was the manifested thoughts of god being finished he was there when he showed up he was there as the finished work of god the word of god that he can stand there and know exactly what could happen know exactly what he had planned and tell abraham that i have a plan and the plane is going to happen exactly as i said it's going to happen and that's why he did the same thing with us none other than melchizedek himself came he looked at you and he told you about your natural body he told you what was wrong with you he told you about your natural birth after he said all of that he told you now if i told you about your natural birth you believe can i now tell you about this other birth of where you came from before you can have this natural birth it says and he had abraha and had changed and they had to change abraham the body in order for them you know the in order to receive the promised son and we cannot receive the promised son that's promised to us in these bodies that we are living in this body of sin now i want you to see now how he's transitioning he talked about abraham now he's transitioning he says now this first conscience controls this controls this body with sea taste smell here and it's just got it just got us all scribbled up it says re-reason everything else and it says that we are new but but we are new but but that new body it says that comes from this born again not the conscience not not this first conscience it passed away it says it's that inside something that lives he's telling you now the mystery of this body change how are you going to come to it he's now letting you now paul says it is sown in this court but yet it's ripping glory it is in weakness but yet just reveal itself so he's now saying within this mortal body that we are in god is sowing something inside by which the new body will come so you look it's not this natural body this natural body will fight with it until we are out of here but he says it's now something that's thrown inside it says and everybody understood i understood it say amen it says it's not this outside taste feels smells here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but ins that's the inside part of you down in down in here inside that is the person that cannot die it says see that's the person that their new life starts from we heard this morning men cannot live by word alone but by every word of god and it's because we firmly have to understand what the word of god does in our lives we are born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to this world living speaking lies and all the things and we know that in fact paul speaks it says we we are acquainted with the earthly because we are born in the earth no one can tell you what it means to be human because you've experienced it but it says the same way that we have experienced the earthly so shall we experience the heavenly it says but here is how it starts it's not by that birth in other words god is coming into this flesh but it's by this new man a new creation that is starting within this flesh it's not the old man put together you teach him how to do right to learn right to do that's not what we're looking for you can get this flesh in order and still miss it now that we have a promise to bring it under subjection but it doesn't start every time you look at your flesh in order for you to correct it you're studying at the wrong place where it starts it's a new life within you that that grows together and it grows and it grows and once it's grown he has the ability to conquer this flesh and that's the body that's the person that the new body is built for amen it says but it's a part that's it's but it's inside a part of you down in there inside that person that cannot die and see that's the person that the new life starts from it says from this new birth it says it's built around another person in the image of the person that you are oh wow i love it it's build that new person it says and he and it builds another person in the image of this person that you are in other words what was in the mind of god in the beginning began to materialize in this flesh i'll tell you this my desire ever in my life is to be that manifestation of the thoughts of god being manifested what a belief that what a believer desires is when my decisions when i make a decision to be in line and in accordance with what decision he already made for me when i'm aligning myself with the thoughts of god that was in the beginning about me when i'm beginning to make my decisions and reflecting the very attributes of who he was or what he made me to be that's the desires of my heart it says the image a person that builds it says the image and around your life you get it he continues on he says so potentially it's in here what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world the world around and around here this only reflects the negative it says that reflects the positive the word see and the same thing is it says of the translation of the bride will be the same thing it says the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word amen he says in one place he said that body is the word when you sit here and you desire to be stronger to overcome something it says it's like a positive charge coming from that body coming down on you and touching you to make you stronger let me say this that body existed before this body so everything that you have need of already exists in that body all you're doing is just transferring the attributes and the positivity that exists in that body into the body of flesh that we have amen that's why christianity is so messed up because the world looks at it it says oh you got to work up so you can be like jesus so you can be like this he himself is looking at you and say no i already made everything let me say this every attributes about god everything about god is already finished he's already accomplished the the the healing is already done it's something of a past deliverance is something of the past we are called to come and partake of those defined natures so they could be manifested to us it's not something god has to work out and say well they're asking something i didn't think of now i gotta find a way to bring it up no it's you calling this body over here to come into manifestation in this realm why because you have need of it the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing did by sarah before when the old body that she had that first body it had no it had to be changed in order to produce the sun you get it the body could not do it the body could not do it so it had to be changed the same way to receive the sun let me just skip for the second time it says again in question and answer he says i think it says just think the very lord jesus was back there in the days of the apostle is that right here now it says it's just winding up the end of the gentiles a great move is going on among the supernatural believers because we believe that god is here says just think your glorified body is right here in the tabernacle now your glorified body is right here in the tabernacle now the presence of the holy ghost of the holy spirit which is your glorified condition you are glorified in christ right now so even what we are trying to attain god has already built it for us he's wanting us to be partakers in the experience so we can know what it is it says and you'll glorify it says you're glorified you are glorified in christ right now those who he justify he glorify and and your your own glory and and your own glorified body is standing near right now in christ jesus to give you a strength like a charge going into a battery let me say this that thought that body can never be for somebody else it's yours it's not given to give charge to anybody else but you so your expression down here he's already got the complete expression on the other side he's only calling you so you can partake of it and this is where we rejoice to know that if he's got it already finished what do i have to worry about is i'm calling you to partake of it so you can come in the fullness that's why he says what is adoption is god trying to bring you into that fullness but oh my we have so many other things that stops us from going into the fullness we desire this we want that we want this but yet the question we should be asking is any of the things that i'm wanting and i'm desiring is it going to get me into that fullness it says it's to give you strength like a charge going into a battery the holy spirit it's the holy spirit in you it's to charge your body to give you the new strength to give you new strength to heal you from the sicknesses that you've got make you well you already got your healing you already got your deliverance everything that you're struggling with now god has already got it all finished up for you so it's for you to come and get it it for you to come and desire it it's for you to walk in the way that he has provided so therefore when we hear the word of god it's that charge coming into us to give us strength so we can continue if the musician could come i want to say this we have to desire to see that power of transformation that is in the word work in us but branham talks about the devil being a deformer and if you look at the difference between transformation and and deformation the difference is transformation takes you to your purpose to what you're supposed to do and to deform you is to cause you to not fulfill your purpose to become something different something that you were not called to be to manifest something that you were not originally intended to become but here is god's word with the power of transformation in it to cause that transformation to come you know we don't do all kinds to to for us to expand we don't do any exercise just eat and relax it can go to bed and go to bed you will see that happen you will wake up one morning and realize man i've transformed but if you don't eat you don't see the change you eat you see the change but talks about the farmer and the seed he said that seed has to drink more than its portion he has to drink more than it can handle so it will burst up and open up and produce a fruit but it seems like sometimes we just want to sip you know you just take a sip you're like oh that's enough until next time you're not going to be in good shape and just fyi the best shape i'm talking about is a fat christian is one who's filled with the promises of god one who eats right one who knows his promises one who knows what god has given him and he takes it and he goes outside and the exercise is right i'm i'm a believer i'm a son of god he called me here for a reason he placed me here for a reason i tell you we have to desire that when we see god's mind manifested in our choices that should be the desire of each christian when i make a choice i can go home and say this is god's mind being manifested not when i do i go and i go and i hit my head against the wall and said what did you just do you know how stupid can you be no when when he so poured himself into me until what i say it's what he said [Music] it's not the age where we just come and get a little bit and just get a little bit no it's the age of adoption an adoption is to be about the father's business when you woke up in the morning all you're thinking about is what does the father want me to do today who did the f who does the father wants me to speak to today i'm here and something happened you come to the realization that i'm standing here for a reason it's because god wants me to stand here if i can hear what that person is talking about that they need help is because god wants me to hear and go over there and say something about it one who knows a position one who can come into the position to wear the word of god they know what position the word of god has in their lives not one who has the word to use it only when i need it i'll go my way when i need the word of god then i'll add it to my formula and get what i need no one who's fully surrendered to the promise one who's fully surrendered to the program you can never be successful until you fully surrender to the program there's no such thing as halfway questions you're never gonna make it we have to be surrendered to the program we have to be given to the program when you go to a boot camp you give into the program you follow everything that's when you graduate it's not when you're one foot in one foot out but we are here to be committed to the program god bless you let's all stand [Music] amen let's just pray our gracious father away [Music] father it's so amazing how we every day we realize that we need you more than the day before how we realize that every day we need you more than before every time and father it seems like our hunger keeps growing and growing because lord we see the things which you have promised and and we know in order to attain them it can only be you living in us father that we may empty of ourselves and have you filled us with every fiber of our being father till we could people can look upon us and see the very nature of you being manifested in us lead us and guide us our father we ask that you bless the people that have gathered here lord those that are listening from home and father we pray because it's the desire of all of all of us lord that you may bring us to that place by the way we are committed to your program we love you and we commit everything to your hands us that you bless each one o god and bless our pastor lord and we thank you we commit the weak to come and ask that you be with us oh god we ask those things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen let's just sing that as we invite brother david pull your spirit on on me fall just like the rain all saturday my thirsty soul [Music] i need you now for your sphere lord i seek you help me [Music] my broken place [Music] lord forgive me if i wander far away from [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] me [Music] on me fill my top again [Music] amen i want to make a comment about tonight's sermon because so many people [Music] are so distracted with life but tonight you heard of one of the best explanations and i've been in this message 50 years or more you heard the best explanation tonight of your theophany calling for you [Music] it's exactly what it is how many knows that satan has something you'd like you to be got a perfect place for you [Music] just just some place that you would fit in his kingdom but you understood what he said god already had this body in mind it was here before you were you got to remember you dropped down from where you were supposed to be you dropped down here and got this thing [Music] have you started to learn to hate it [Music] i just get a kick out of people that just get so hung up in the mirror don't they know it's corrupting it's dying and pretty soon like i said this morning they're trying to keep it beautiful and it's decaying but there was another body and that body needs you to be whole it needs your life in it yes and it's calling for you come the seed life that's in you it's not meant for this body think of it there's one up there that it's meant for and now it's time has come yes it's time has come and it's calling for you come unto me when you begin to hear your theophany call for you you know that that time is nigh though satan don't want to let you go he wants to use your body yeah for what he wants to use it for firewood for his hellhole that he's going to be in i'm glad i'm getting a call from god aren't you i'm glad there's another body but i hope we take it and and take it exactly what our brother shared with us tonight can you you'll get strength from that body because he can't let you fail [Music] he can't let you fail he won't lose one i'm thrilled with that tonight i i'm really thrilled with that in fact i'm going to go listen to that message and write all kinds of notes and go someplace and preach it [Music] where it's not so common and everybody will shout and have a wonderful time but i'm shouting having a wonderful time why why does that mean so much to me because it's my security [Music] you understand it's my security we can't fail because there's somebody that's got to have you it gets me feeling good somebody wants me someone's got it the world and even with doctors after that this your cells that belong to you [Music] and that life can be driven out and cast out you
