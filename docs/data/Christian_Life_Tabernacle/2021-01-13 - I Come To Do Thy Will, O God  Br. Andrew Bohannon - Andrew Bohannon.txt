and praise he's mighty to save he's Mighty to deliver he's brought the the shackles of sin and unbelief he's destroyed the bondage and now we're here to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen praise the Lord praise the lord we just um we know that there's a lot of sickness going around and we're not immune to sickness but we have the results of Calvary he said bi a stripes we are healed I know many people right now I I got on the phone I made a few calls and I heard there's people in Desperate situations and they really need a touch from the Lord so you've heard the request I I know that there's a real U urgent uh need for uh brother Adrien and sister Cindy they had their child and um uh sister Cindy has been suffering from from the pain um of the birth and we just want to remember them and just trust that the Lord's already undertaking and that it'll be a quick return and so let's just bow our heads together precious Heavenly Father Lord what a grand privilege it is to Stand Here Lord your purchase Lord to to stand before the the purchase prize the apple of your eye Lord we want you to have your way in this service tonight Lord we we have mentioned the request Lord and you know the secret needs Lord you know the burdens that we have for loved ones Lord we pray that your tender hand would go by each each of their way Lord and with the the nail scarred hands bring virtue Lord let it flow God let it be for a testimony of your goodness Lord that the power of the Resurrection might be declared once again at this end time proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Lord we're lifting up Thanksgiving Lord already knowing that you can't fail oh God knowing that you said in your word many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord [Music] just have a little thought that little bit been churning on my heart and we just trust that the Lord will have his way and will be able to deliver the burden we certainly have appreciated the brothers and the wonderful wonderful words we've been hearing I just so appreciate how Brother David you know just coming out of that theology you know we hear the word and the word starts having an effect and we start trying to put it in practice is but we need the spirit to come behind the word amen and so as we're journeying through the little bit of a thought that we have we just trust that the Lord will come behind his word amen Philippians chapter 3 we start there in um verse one finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of con conscious concision for we are the circumcision which worship God in spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof that he mightest trust in flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless my my that's that's a very high order there but what things we gain to me those I count loss for Christ that's right yay doubtless I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered loss of all things and do count them but dung but I might when Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith yes sir that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death amen we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats you know you think about what Paul is saying there there's there is a a place where the believer is going to come to to to know him and to know him in the power of his resurrection and yet to know him you must also know how to have fellowship with him amen the Bible says here that the there's a fellowship of his suffering and being made conformable unto his death amen so as we we just we also will read in um in Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10 we'll start there in um verse four it says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin therefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin thou has no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the books it is written of me to do thy will oh God Amen and I believe that's the same Cry of the spirit in The Believer to I've come to do thy will amen and there's a there's a call there's you know for the believer today is to know what our purpose is like our brother Billy was speaking you know for this cause have I come into the world you know it was to destroy the works of the devil and when God paid the price uh you know we we ought to consider what was the purpose why was the lamb slain and you know so that you know we can understand more about what the call is what the purpose of God in our lives right is it just to have a job and you know go to school and have a house you know and just kind of conduct life no God wants he has a purpose in us being here amen that's right you know it was it was in the mind of God it was in the plan of God that there would be a Union there would be a a a uniting and so you know when you consider the plan of God and God how he wanted to become with one with man and you think about the the enemy you know we know that it was saying there that you know there was dogs that would come you know there was there would be a a religious spirit that they would be cloaked with theology you know and they would come and they would be taking the very same word and and they would be walking down a line to where you know as the Bible says that at the end it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect amen but now what what is the dividing line amen so I want to see that this Same Spirit that was shed at Calvary because the life is in the blood and so when the spirit came out of life now he wanted to have a union and declare the very same works that he did amen and that was to destroy the the the works of the devil not just you know when you look out and you see the politic no it it starts at home it starts this is um where it begins Let the spirit of God come and destroy the works of the devil in me yes sir Amen in my in my thinking sir amen we're living in a time where it's like I mean there's a personal Temptation for each one of us you know we're we're experiencing in things we're going through things and even as the request it just when I consider it you know I've had four children and and I I know that the the the complexity that can be when when you have children and the birth the excitement and then there's it doesn't always just go as smooth as you would hope but yet when you see that child it gives you it propels you it motivates you and and you know the thing about the Life of Christ for us you know we're looking that God would have his way and the trials and the testings that we're going through is to bring about a Perfection it's to bring about a character amen sir and so you know as you're going through the test you know what we want to understand is whenever those birth pains get closer and closer and closer you know and they get more intense that means the Deliverance is at hand amen so the things that you're enduring the the com conflict that's within there's a wrestling you know there's there's that mind battle and it's real and it tries to grip you but I want to say that God is here he's come and in the power of his resurrection amen and he wants to do for us the things we can't do for ourselves it's just getting out of that channel of trying to figure it out and trying to get to manufacture something but that's not the call of God amen amen if we go over to Luke we're just trust in the Lord will lead us along we don't really have U necessarily um you know a straight line we want to we want to go through but we're just trus in the Lord will be able to speak something to your heart that would really encourage you I know we're going through Troubled Waters amen but there's the spirit of God is here to bring the stabilizers Amen in Luke chapter 4 you know we want to just kind of look you know the the people who have gone on have been examples the Paul Abraham Noah the scripture says that there were examples to admonish us to see that what pleased God and how you know you see how they responded you know because there's there there's going to be challenges that you and I face that the enemy is tempting us he's trying to draw us away and there's going to be there's going to be opportunity to to react to an action amen and you know you know how it is sometimes your flesh gets in front of gets in front and then all of a sudden you're now like oh you know Lord I just you know I missed it there try me again you know that's the mark of a true Soldier amen like when you're getting tested and you're getting tried and you fail there's something in you that says I can't lose amen you can't lose see when he died at Calvary you were there with him and he conquered death and hell and the grave and that was for you and you were in him amen and now you're here to express him amen amen that's right that's good that's wonderful am Amen to think that you were with with him there amen and now here in Luke you're familiar with the scene and something that was said just really just sparked off to me and I just trust that it'll be a blessing so it's start and it says and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness amen and that just strikes me you know the spirit of God LED him to be tested amen let him in so don't be surprised if you come LED of the Lord and you're in a test you're you you feel like you're in a desert land you're in the wilderness and you don't feel you don't feel the spirit moving you you know you feel anxious you feel tired you know you don't feel worthy don't be surprised when the Temptation comes being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when he were were ended he was afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread amen that's just the same thing for you you're not a son of God you're you're not a daughter of God look at your life look what you did oh I you know that's just like the devil he goes hey take that take that and then he's calling the police when you did it you know that's exactly the way it works he's the accuser of the Brethren but he always tries to put a question mark on the word of God he's trying he he's that black voice that black dog and you got the white dog and the black that guy is telling you constantly he's got he's he's got that uh he's got that uh monologue he's const he's Relentless he he won't stop so you know what it's time to come in the power of the resurrection and tell him to leave amen I got a word amen it's it is written The man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God Amen it doesn't you don't have to feel it you don't have to you know feel like singing none of those things but it's written amen that's right and the devil taking him up to a high mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment's time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee in the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whosoever I will give it if thou will worship me all shall be thine you know Jesus didn't dispute him that he had the Authority or the power over all those kingdoms and you consider that even today how you know that's what the enemy tries to do he'll offer you some kind of um position in a in a job or he'll offer you some kind of um you know you name it you know what it is I don't you know I know what he tries to offer me amen but there's nothing that's going to come in front of the word amen that's says and Jesus answered him and said get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve amen so I just think about this and how that worship and service are connected you know and and I I feel there's a call to service I feel like the Lord's been really dealing with us about getting in action you know that it's we've been we've been training we've been in the barracks we've been learning how to to to conduct Our Lives you know we we we got the ABCs we're working and now it's time to open our mouths and tell somebody else that Jesus Christ is coming he's come he he he's changed our lives he's made a difference amen and he can do the same for others and and he brought him up to Jerusalem and set him on a high Pentacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hence for it is written he' give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus answered unto him it is re it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and when the temp when when the devil had ended all the Temptations He departed from him for a season and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into gallilee amen and that that's that little verse really popped out at me I I don't know if it was brother Billy who read it but it just it struck me you know it after the Temptation even before the Temptation the spirit led him to be tempted and then he goes through those three personal Temptations and and brother brandham said this and I'll read the quote maybe I'll paraphrase it but you know the Lord never used any of his power to defeat the Devil you know we know that Satan can be defeated any time any place and anywhere and and he gave this example here so that even the weakest of Christians can take God's word and defeat the Devil amen and I think about that the enemy that tries to come in my mind you know you think about when you start looking at what goes on in the world you know what what's going on in the world is and I don't keep up with politics but I try to I try to notice certain things because there's a parallel right there's there's the natural and the spiritual and they're are working parallel they're coming along down the line and so now if you just look at and I won't talk necessarily Who's Who and all that stuff but as far as with a new Administration coming in there's going to be a new president that would stand in and and things are going to change you know we know it's coming and so there'll be this Administration and obviously they'll make this change and this change and so the rulership is going to be acting in a different way right so in the parallel now I want the the the power to return to the power of the spirit amen you get to serving the lord sometimes in your mind you start worrying against this Spirit of self-sufficiency Amen do do you understand that we're going through this life we're still packing a corrupt body that our spirit still needs to be changed we have the Holy Spirit and he's here to bring us to a place where we receive power of the Resurrection that it can bring this body this mind into subjection amen I am under an expectation my My Hope Is that the very Christ the very Spirit of the word will now become energized and make this body subject to every word amen and this body has been promised that it's going to defeat death the the power of death you're going to express the very living Christ that's what you're doing now that's what you're doing now in the face of all the tactics that the enemy is because now he's his administration is to rule by fear so you think about what what is happening in the day and age that we're living in there's a people that are crowning Jesus Christ Lord of lords and King of Kings how are they doing it by taking him at his word saying though in my body the skin worms are destroying me yet I see my Christ he he promised me a resurrection I don't have to taste death because he tasted it for me amen that's right SE words are not going to fall they're going to manifest in me amen that's the way you feel that's right there's something inside deeply calling out for the very Resurrection Life right to destroy the works of the devil in your loved ones Lord let me be submissive to the hand of the Potter so that I can be the very Christ a hand extended amen amen you're you're that tree you're that tree that's bearing fruit the fruit of life amen and you think about you know in the natural how that all of the systems and everything like that you know uh you know when I was going through a little study you know I'm I'm paraphrasing because I'm drawing off memory you know somewhere in the pergami or the Samaritan Church age where the church now you know the enemy he Rules by deception amen he's the God of this evil age and he he he comes using religious trappings I mean wow he he would take the word and even the name of Christ and and and yet it's so deceivable and yet so now uh the the the very the very organized religion now the way that the enemy is controlling from behind the scenes so now it's the system that's that's moving and carrying out his work amen and yet there's another system if you will there's another power that is now coming in a people that have been purchased amen that that they're crowning him amen I'm not going to be subject to to to um this corrupt flesh anymore you know I I was used I used to be in bondage this used to have Mastery over me it was it was a husband but that see now I've been made conformable unto his death this man has died amen and now there's another life it it's the Life of Christ it's no longer I that live but it's Christ that liveth in me amen you know I just think about um you know the witnesses that we had and you know brother brandham he he was preaching a message in 1962 called the present stage of my Ministry and I can almost remember the the very first time I heard it um this was when Glenn Parks used to live here and I was doing a job for John and uh I I just remember how that you know Paul in his life and we can go to uh I believe it's in first Timothy but you know you see the the the scriptures have have a double meaning and history repeats itself ever so often and you see that you know the things that you go through the things things that other people have been through the witnesses that have gone before us like uh Abraham and and so many strengths can come from their experiences and so I just think you know in this time you know when when we're forsaking our Humanity you know there's there's pools that we have and we're forsaking those things and there's there's a parallel where the world is forsaking anything that's called God you see there's a great contrast so as the world gets darker and darker and further away from God there's a people that are walking into more light amen I'm forsaking my own way I'm forsaking um all unbelief amen and so uh when you think about there's a there's a um we're living in a time it's a forsaking time but there's a crowning that's happening you know and and something that kind of uh just came on me and I'll just like I said with with with Paul in his ministry you know he was the the Gentile Prophet you know he never met Jesus Christ in the flesh he had met him when he had returned back in the form that he was before the in the form of the spirit right and so now um he he he lived his life he he he experienced a Great Commission and now there came a time in his life where all had forsaken him you know that maybe I'll read this quote and that I kind of settle down a little bit it says this he says now and this is out of the present stage of my Ministry um verse 44 he says now when Jesus the young prophet of Galilee he got a time that he was forsaken Aken all men who stay with God's word gets to a place where they are forsaken by the world and the religious world Amen and so you know you think about our Lord and he experienced that and then Paul came to a place and there was so much U miraculous I mean think about the the snake bite he shook it off in the fire think about how that you know so many mighty Works were done in his ministry and then when he came to the end of his ministry he said in um believe it's First Timothy second Timothy in verse uh in chapter 4 2 Timothy chapter 4 he says now in verse six he says for I am ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not only to me and not to me only but all them that love is appearing do thy diligence to come shortly for Demus hath forsaken me having loved the present world and is departed from thessalonica cretus to the GLA glacia Titus and Dil only Luke is with me take Mark and bring him with thee for it is profitable for me for my Ministry am man you think about the story you know there there there's going to be a time of testing amen but but to overcome is to stand the test amen I just feel my heart that the the time that we're living it's a testing time brother brandom said you came to this world to be tested but you have the goods see the good gold when it goes to the to the to the inspector you don't have to be nervous because you know it's good it's good gold it's going to pass the test and and your new birth experience by the spirit of God it's it passes the test amen so yeah I think about the the thing that um you know anything in nature anything in the economy of God if we ever serve God's purpose we're promised a resurrection amen so we're looking for the resurrection amen that's our goal so when we're you know surely in work when you go to your job you you don't work for nothing you know I mean there's a reward there amen we're we're living this life we're enduring afflictions we're in battle we Face test it's not in vain we have the prize we're looking for the prize the the time is at hand amen let's run this race with patience amen there's a time that will come and it did for Paul and see the thing it just strug me you know it's it's one of those things things where you know in in the in God through brother Brandon was sharing how that you know Deus you know he was converted in Paul's meetings Paul led him to the Lord and now the scripture says that that Demus had forsaken him you know think about it I mean there's times where you shared things with people and where are they now you see he said Demus hath forsaken having love love this pleas present world my you know the scripture says if you love this world the love of God's not even in you amen I'm not speaking to you that's your lot but I'm saying that's what happens sometimes people still haven't had that burned out amen but but your example can bring the true seed to the New Birth amen H how how how did you experience this what was the result of that well you know what I'm not going to tell you the Theology of it but let me tell you one day I kneel down and I heard that Jesus Christ paid it all and when I believe that I took him at his word and not only did I leave it in my mind but I kneel down amen and I asked him I called upon the name of the Lord and let me tell you after that day I've been changed I'm a new creation just like the Bible says that all things are passed away the burden of sin is gone amen amen this is a reality it's the spirit that's come and resurrected me out of my own I'm my worst enemy he he still Wars against me he Wars against you he's trying to make the word which all that he was you are he's trying to make you of none effect because of the battle just sit at home I W go there you know it's in light of a crowning I um I wanted to consider what a crown represents and a couple of definitions that I I it's just kind of a blessing to me and that you know the crowning is representative of of sovereignty you know it's it's representative of a imperial power of a dominion and so it also re represents legitimacy and victory it represents honor glory it it it also represents immortality it represents righteousness and resurrection and it's also a crown is actually um something given to a champion amen don't you don't you don't you feel like your arms are starting to get a little strong to grab the crown of your life and Crown Jesus Christ Vicor he he's the winner of my heart amen didn't his love woo you to say oh you're worth everything amen you know there's a thing you know in this journey God hasn't made halfway Christians or halfway preachers right but we can be halfway amen we want to learn how to give all that's the very Victory so in light of this crowning you know I started looking at it how that it symbolizes you know in Traditions they can make crowns out of different things some make it out of Oak and you know they made a crown of thorns of mockery for our Lord and you know it was the very thing that was necessary to set us free you know he he did that it was a love expression you know and you know a crowning is also a coronation it it it symbolizes and it it the type of crown that it is it symbolizes what its aim is if it's gold or wood or different things and I thought you know the the the etymology of the word Crown is is an investment with with Regal power or a throne so it's representative of a throne and and a crown is also a culminating event okay these are just natural types and and a crown also can represent the top part of a tree and then it also can represent where the the root of the tree is and the stem so that's a crown and now a crown can also be something that's a prosthetic that covers your tube you know you think about some of that it's just uh it's just interesting but you know the the root of crown in Latin the word is actually Corona and and you just think about how that the enemy the way he's crowned upon the people is by fear and when you're ruled by fear you're ruled by Satan amen but we have the love of God which casts out all fear amen we're not afraid to be at the house of God to worship God we're not afraid to be at our job and declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that he heals he's alive he still saves he still delivers he still casts out Devils amen if you suffer a little bit for the cause of Christ amen amen amen but if we suffer as wrong ERS well that's you know that's part of being human you know but we want to yield ourselves to the power of the Resurrection that his Works might be declared Amen in our redeemed flesh amen you know there's there's examples like Paul there brother brandom said that there's there's a separating time that comes you know like we don't we don't walk this with our mom we don't walk this life with our dad there's a time where we come to the place where we have to meet God Alone amen amen and so we have to separate from all unbelief we have to separate from our kin all that right when we have our experience now now we can rejoice and line up in the army of God we're serving God together amen but I've had my experience I've been separated from all unbelief amen and now God is having his way amen you know demons got the wrong opinion you know I as I was reading this I just thought only you know only a prophet could really understand this but he said now when and I was sitting around uh praying and brother Brown says I wonder what Deus was thinking you know when when you know to to forsake Paul and he he was sharing how that one brother was like you know when we get to heaven you know I'm going to let Deus know why did he you know forsake you know he's going to you know give him a good lick and brother B said you know watch out your desire to want to because there ain't going to be that kind of thing going on in heaven you know so but it just it just in my heart I Rejoice because the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart God has discerned our hearts amen and he's provided what we have need of and so he said now let's take some of dea's thoughts as I was sitting down on the hillside wondering the other day about daylight and I was thinking why would Deus want to leave that fell why would he want to leave that poor little preacher that led him to the Lord the man that spearheaded the Revival amongst the Gentiles a prophet indeed no one could say but what he was a prophet no one was more he was more than a prophet he was the Apostle and a Great and Mighty Apostle to the Gentiles and the spirit of God moved upon that man and why would he want to turn back to such a p turn his back on such a person as that he had been Vindicated he was a servant of Christ did you notice Paul his him saying loving this present world now I don't think Deus was backslid I don't think that he he did that but I think he got the wrong opinion of Paul so he didn't backslide he didn't go drinking and off into the world no he said he got the wrong opinion amen and I I want the spirit to so to to to so rule my heart that my mind won't drift into these other opinions amen because we're subject to to to having these things come at us but we know we've been equipped with a double barrel shotgun when the when the enemy throws those thoughts we got the Old and New Testament it start saying it is written amen it is written thus sayith the Lord get thee behind me Satan now Deus came from a rich family and he was wealthy and money sometimes is religion to people you know I just think you know he also started looking at Paul's life and you know think about it and you you'll face it and I've experienced it as well but you know you you speak of a supernatural God and no doubt you've experience the supernatural God cuz it it takes a miracle to receive Revelation it takes a miracle to be born again it takes the hand of God upon your life no man can buy his bootstraps lift him up into the kingdom of God it takes the spirit of the Resurrection to come where you're at yes sir when you invite him amen and so you think about how that damus had had loving this present world then he took the wrong opinion of him because now you know think about you know in light of what he just said about some people's religion is money you know and and brother Brandon was off Millions he just turned it down he forsake it you know thinking about our Lord he he didn't even have a pillow to to lay his head he forsook home so that you and I can have a home he says I go to prepare a place for you amen we got a prize yeah our hope is not here we're resting that he's made a way for us am so we think about how that he he started looking at things in his in his mind he perceived that Paul was starting to get washed up that his ministry he didn't have the same power amen and and now you know he he leaves his friend that's sick and then he goes to another another meeting you know a Divine healer leaves his friend and goes and then he also he writes unto him and he says now he said uh in verse 13 He says the cloak that I left with trus uh tros with carus when thou comest bring with thee in the books see he he said he only had one coat and he said it's getting cold up here you see you know I I just he started getting the wrong opinion thinking that wow he leaves his friend sick and then he's without natural reignment clothing and and now he's starting to think he's all washed up and yet I I want I want to be able to have the mind of God be my goal what is God doing in the trials that we're facing sir what is he producing what is he declaring yes sir what what what is the result what is my reaction to what God is doing am I [Music] willing to suffer when people forsake it hurts it hurts people you love they're like you know what they just get the wrong opinion yeah amen but you know what for us we want to bear that cross you know it becomes the very thing many times they say how you stood in the midst of your trial I knew there was a strength there was a hidden strength and it draws them in they start hungering for what you have amen God was fixing to Crown his Ministry and you think about you know he said it was profitable that Luke was with me you know and and he always had that infirmity many people believe it was his eyes after the heavenly vision and um you know but God was fixing the crown his ministry and you know I just think about how that you know those things are patterns that we we want to be so subject to the spirit of Christ that when we Face the trials and God wants to Crown us with life that we're so yielded and we're so in the word and in the spirit of the word that he can Crown our lives with the resurrection life amen trying to look to see how much time I spent praise the Lord trying to find a place to stop here you know I I I was telling my wife you know I feel like many times because of the battle you you're you have the ability to get Negative amen anybody else feel like they've ever gotten kind of sour and kind of got a little negative and uh a thought struck me the last service and uh you know God loves controls the ants and and you know someone would say well you know God love doesn't care whether you got termites or not you know what I mean but but yet uh there's this acronym that brother Jackson shared with me one time that I was fellowshipping with him and you know that acronym is these automatic negative thoughts that's that's what ants it's an automatic negative thought syndrome you know that's the black dog that we have to war against it's our own spirit all Humanity it it wrestles against us right we have an adversary he's corrupted this and so we're going to stand Victorious because he's in US greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen though these negative thoughts come I don't want to give vent to them yeah amen I want to say it is written I preach the gospel to myself every day sir it's so necessary that we lift ourselves up out of this the humanity part because there's so many influences bombarding us all of the sudden now we hear it so much we repeat it amen as I was just being too negative I said Lord I was telling my wife you know it's it's something that's within me I want to return to the power of the spirit yeah amen I I am come to do thy will oh lord it's the same spirit in you it's the same spirit in me crying fulfill every word that you promised for me yes you paid the price don't let One Promise fall to the ground don't let me live below my privileges not one more moment amen if you have a need if there's a desire in your heart let's call upon God and walk in the power of the spirit Amen brother Brown made this statement and and why was the Holy Ghost given for men and women where where do we stand today where are we at let's stop the other night across a little old seat where there in a room I must close a little old duofold seat after praying for three or 4 days so I got into such a place going around thinking oh God and I got to such a place till I don't know what to do I I thank God for the examples amen there's times where we just get to a place where we just say I don't know what to do but bram's expressing this very thing he says God we are at the end of the road and I realize I've been neglected I've had calls to go on and been tired and wouldn't do it I thought then that I could see the Lord staggering through the dark Yonder when he was so tired he could hardly raise one foot after the another one but he wasn't to he stopped for the woman and name then for the boy brought out there that was dead till he could go out over and touch that barrier and use the little strength that he had to raise that boy well how did I get tired what's the matter with me Lord think here I think well I'm getting old I can't do it and there was Moses and the same God I serve stood Yonder at the at 120 years old there was Caleb stood at the age of 90 with the sword in his hand and said Joshua put this sword in my hand 40 years ago he was 80 them said I'm just as good as a man today as I was then amen I said God be merciful to me I said well look at here I'm always and I took my wife back there by the hand across this Bible and her little Bible and I said honey I've been too negative the Holy Spirit condemns me within me I said I think about those squirrels Yonder I think about Hattie Wright back there and those little boys I think about what God did showing that he was God and could create Hallelujah I thought he told me that for years I I I'll not leave you nor never forsake you no man stood no man will stand before you all the days of your life I will be with you and from this hand of discernment it'll come till you know the very secrets of the heart after that it'll raise ra you up higher and higher and the years after that proved perfect the world around then it comes this that other great ministry far beyond it honey I've taken your hand and by God's help and Grace and I'll never never let me be negative again let me walk forth to the this revival here to preach like never befor amen let me go here to First sanctify myself and to make a way for the people that my that my own sins my own neglect be under the blood my own shortcomings be under the blood that I might walk out and say follow me people that's right I hate to see a guy you know and I'll just I'll just paraphrase I'm just kind of a slow reader but this story I I just encourage you to listen to it there's something that happens and if I prepared better I probably would have just had the brothers back there play it it's that encouraging but you know he he said I I you know the theology it's kind of like the Theology of man but when when he had his friend who was like a a fire chief or whatever there was a there was a fire that broke out and and he was pointing to him he said now men go ahead and spur the water over there you know while the the place is burning up and he's like put some over there put some over there and then here comes the well- trained louisin Louisville Fire Department coming out and they boy they jumped up and who was it at the lead it was the captain running right up with the axe come on boys you know that's that's just the thing like like you don't have to tell things that we don't know we just go tell what we know amen it's it's you know it works amen and let's in my heart's cry is exactly like where brother Brandon was saying you know let let us take this a personal challenge if you feel like I've had I felt like I was just being too negative I feel like I'm my worst enemy living below my privileges amen and as we see the world it has an effect but let's learn to walk in the power of the Resurrection amen we have a a goal we have a prize let's March towards the prize amen Why Don't We Stand we'll invite the musicians one more scripture that yeah it's just this gospel is the greatest love story there there's there's no other story that has won my heart amen I mean to think that we have been given a promise like that girl says I'll come back for you Amen in Isaiah 62 it says for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness therefore go forth as brightness and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see their righteousness and all the Kings thy glory and thou shal be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name and thou shal also be a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord a royal diadem in the hand of thy God and thou shalt no more be termed forsaken Thou shalt neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate but Thou shalt be called HB and Thy Thy land bua for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married amen and and you know the the the great crowning of the Bride is divine love and it's our testimony it was Grace Grace we don't have to go and tell people a bunch of rules amen we could just tell them how the love of God won our heart and we're crowning him every day saying thus sayeth the Lord it is written my king is enthroned in my heart I believe every word I'm watching him bringing it to pass amen if you have a special need and you just want to lift up your hands and those who want to join me and my heart's desire is to do like brother brandom did and from today on and just praying from the depths of my heart that I the Lord would allow us to walk in the power of the Resurrection when when things all around us the forsaking that people are doing they're walking away from truth they're forsaking morality they're forsaking anything that's called God you want to join me let's pray together precious Lord we are so grateful Lord that you have not not left us without a witness Lord we thank you Lord for the promise of your Resurrection Lord as we've Lord just looked into your word Lord we've seen the examples that were given to us for our admonition Lord we pray in the mighty name of Jesus Lord that you would do for us what we can't do for ourselves Lord we're acknowledging now Lord we don't have the ability to do it Lord but we know that you promised oh God that you would give us the very mind of Christ that that we have the mind of Christ Lord that that you will pour out your spirit to declare the resurrection Lord that the very character of Jesus Christ would once be again be declared in this last age Lord we just commit all the needs of the people Lord we pray that as we Face the challenges of tomorrow Lord we can have a boldness Lord we can have a confidence Lord because you can't fail and you said I'll never leave you nor forsake you Lord and we're just lifting up Praises of Thanksgiving Lord how you've done so many great things for us Lord we know even now you're undertaking for those who are in in a desperate need Lord of your healing touch Lord of your delivering power

sing this as we invite brother Matthew to come it's already [Music] done it's already [Music] is Victory is [Music] it's [Music] it's the battle is over already done amen praise the Lord man just thankful for the word tonight just to be able to come hear these words you know that as brother Andrew encouraged you know I that uh listening to present stage of my Ministry uh brother brandom says you know it's a time when men forsake men and that God's servants stay true to his word is when God seals their Ministry with a crowning time I mean we're living in a time where men are forsaken men you even look at the political climat and and uh you see uh ones that have stood together all of a sudden just separating as our our brother Andrew said it the natural and the spiritual just runs parallel but you know at the end of that uh there at the end in present stage of my Ministry brother Brandon says you know I pray God that'll Crown your ministry he said I whatever it might be and he goes it might be a housewife I pray God will Crown your ministry he said I pray he'll Crown your ministry with the glory that is in his word this is in September 1962 that the prophet is preaching this because now he's moving into the third pool of his ministry he's moving into a crowning time and oh we're we're living in a crowning time you know that's why there's the adversity that's why there's uh H all the sickness that's why there's the political climate it's at a time like this that God is now moving into the final stage of the bride's Ministry of a a crowning time and a climactic time and it's those that are going to stay true to the word th those are those are the ones that are going to be crowned with his glory GL you know and and brother brandom you know how he explains and there he just says that oh oh they they say that Paul's all washed up he has nothing else to do with brother Andrew is bringing out and he even starts to personally say that men are saying that brother brandom's all washed up there's nothing else he's been preaching 20 uh almost 30 years and looks like his ministry is just all washed up but but but now God is moving him into that final climax that third pole where just there in Jeffersonville Indiana where there was just a little swamp God was going to reveal the Seven Seals and it's the revealing of that Seven Seals the opening of the word that is what crowns us the Bride of Jesus Christ oh we ought to be a thankful people to be living in a crowning time amen it's already done oh it's already [Music] done hallelujah oh oh the
