[14:58] with a mist
[14:59] lord at the time of noah's time lord you
[15:02] said you put your
[15:03] your promise in the midst of a cloud
[15:05] lord
[15:07] and our word to save your lord jesus
[15:09] went up into a cloud lord and
[15:11] who we are in the last days it was a
[15:13] cloud to us lord god we're the promised
[15:15] in the middle of it lord jesus
[15:18] lord and that's what we stand upon that
[15:20] revealed word in this last hour lord god
[15:23] that's what's in our hearts lord that's
[15:24] what we come to do lord is to worship
[15:26] you lord through that word
[15:28] that's where you put your name in these
[15:30] last days lord into that word
[15:33] so lord jesus i thank you lord for your
[15:35] goodness father
[15:36] lord if there's anything any sin or
[15:38] iniquity lord within us lord that would
[15:41] hinder us from entering into your
[15:42] presence lord we
[15:44] laid upon the altar of your sacrificial
[15:46] blood
[15:48] lord we ask you to receive us lord in
[15:50] jesus christ's name

[15:54] and praise the lord you may be seated
[15:57] amen we'll
[15:58] ask brother mike to come at this time

[16:03] brother mike ask you to stand and
[16:05] if he wants you to stand right away
[16:07] he'll let you know or if he waits till
[16:08] the reading of the word but
[16:10] we just want to make a couple
[16:11] announcements while he comes um
[16:14] we want to meet with all those in the
[16:16] youth group that will be attending the
[16:18] easter meetings at brother tim's
[16:21] for the youth only or any parents that

[16:26] just or anybody that's volunteered to be
[16:28] a chaperone or a driver
[16:30] we'll be meeting immediately after
[16:33] service
[16:34] and the overflow or sunday school room
[16:38] or big space we've been trying to think
[16:41] about what to call that place back there
[16:43] but
[16:44] uh just meet there in the back amen so
[16:47] that'll be for the youth meeting then
[16:49] also um brother jackson said
[16:50] there was a set of keys lost for a i
[16:53] believe a honda so
[16:55] i don't think you'll be going anywhere
[16:56] if if
[16:58] you don't retrieve those keys just ask
[17:00] one of the deacons or it should be there
[17:02] in the back table so
[17:04] amen just remember our our pastor
[17:07] brother david and sister leslie they're
[17:09] in california
[17:10] and so they'll be there for a couple
[17:13] weeks
[17:14] i believe returning maybe midweek so
[17:16] just remember them
[17:18] and so we just asked brother mike to
[17:20] come at this time
[17:23] for our psalm reading
[17:32] good morning in uh
[17:37] first samuel 8 verse 5
[17:41] there's the story of when the elders of
[17:43] israel for speaking to
[17:47] the prophet samuel they want a king
[17:51] and they say this behold thou art old
[17:55] and thy sons walk not in thy ways
[17:59] notice they never said anything about
[18:00] god's ways they pointed to a man's ways
[18:05] now make us a king to judge us
[18:08] like all the nations they wanted a man
[18:12] to judge over them
[18:15] why you would ever want to commit your
[18:18] judgment to another man
[18:21] rather than to the righteous judge is
[18:24] beyond me
[18:25] but it's a perfect example of man's
[18:29] image of a king
[18:32] some royal powerful mighty
[18:36] man to reign over them to judge them
[18:40] to tell them what to do
[18:43] you know god never really intended man
[18:46] to rule over man
[18:49] this is something man put into place and
[18:51] it's always ended
[18:53] with bloodshed with violence with
[18:55] corruption
[18:58] first samuel 8 verse 7 we see god's
[19:00] response to this request the way that he
[19:02] felt about this desire he said
[19:05] they have rejected me
[19:08] that i should not reign over them
[19:12] and that's the bottom line when man sets
[19:15] a king
[19:16] to rule over himself he's making that
[19:20] statement that he'd rather man
[19:22] than god rule over him someone else
[19:25] between me
[19:27] and that relationship they've even done
[19:30] that in the church
[19:31] by creating a vicar a pope to rule over
[19:34] them
[19:36] you know god has a different view of
[19:39] kingship
[19:40] we might be familiar with the scripture
[19:42] where john is speaking in revelation
[19:44] revelation 1 verse 5 he says and from
[19:46] jesus christ
[19:48] who is the faithful witness and the
[19:49] first begotten of the dead
[19:51] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[19:54] unto him that loved us and
[19:55] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[19:58] and hath made us kings and priests
[20:03] unto god and his father in chapter 5
[20:07] verse 10 the 4 and 20 elders started
[20:09] singing a new song
[20:11] and they make this statement again and
[20:12] hast made us
[20:15] unto our god kings and priests
[20:18] and we shall reign on the earth
[20:22] notice how he says he's made us kings
[20:26] unto him
[20:30] you know this isn't rulership over man
[20:34] this isn't man's idea of a king but this
[20:36] is the positional
[20:38] placing by god of his people
[20:41] into a place of dominion
[20:46] you know that's what a king is it's
[20:47] someone who has dominion
[20:49] where things are under his control
[20:54] you know and we know that's the original
[20:57] image of man when god created him in
[21:00] genesis chapter 1
[21:03] verse 26 and god said let us make man in
[21:06] our image
[21:07] after our likeness and let him have
[21:10] dominion not over man
[21:14] but over earth starting with this earth
[21:20] you know but this isn't the man-made
[21:21] placing
[21:23] it says that he has made us
[21:27] it is he had that hath made us and not
[21:29] we ourselves
[21:30] [Music]
[21:32] we're going to read psalm 21 this
[21:34] morning if you want to go ahead and
[21:35] stand
[21:37] you know psalm 21 is the witness it's a
[21:40] testimony of a god-placed
[21:42] king
[21:45] and notice some of the things that this
[21:47] god-placed king
[21:50] says in his testimony starting in verse
[21:52] one it says the king shall join thy
[21:54] strength
[21:55] in thy strength o lord and then thy
[21:59] salvation how greatly shall he rejoice
[22:02] in verse two thou has given him his
[22:05] heart's desire
[22:07] and has not withholden the request of
[22:09] his lips
[22:12] are there any kings in here that can say
[22:14] amen to that
[22:16] has there been one time where he has
[22:18] withholden the request of your lips
[22:22] does this testimony sound familiar this
[22:24] is what dominion looks like for god
[22:26] placed kings in verse 3 thou prevented
[22:31] him with the blessings of goodness
[22:33] he said he has basically overwhelmed us
[22:36] with blessings
[22:38] to the point where we can hardly bear
[22:39] them
[22:41] verse 4 he asked life of thee the king
[22:44] asked life of him and thou gavest at him
[22:48] even length of days forever and ever
[22:51] everlasting life do you see yourself
[22:55] in the vision the placing of
[22:58] kings on the earth
[23:03] but you know you reach as we read
[23:05] chapter 21 this morning and all the
[23:07] blessings
[23:08] of this king notice that this king
[23:12] only had to do two things none of this
[23:15] was the result of his action except for
[23:17] two
[23:18] the first in verse three he asked life
[23:20] of thee
[23:22] and thou gave it he asked for life and
[23:24] he was given eternal life
[23:26] everlasting life and in verse 7 the king
[23:29] trusteth in the lord
[23:32] that's it that's what made this king
[23:35] a god-placed king
[23:39] everything else in his dominion is the
[23:41] work of the lord
[23:43] in fact the very last verse of chapter
[23:46] 21
[23:48] it says this be thou exalted lord in
[23:51] thine
[23:52] own strength so will we sing
[23:55] and praise thy power so as we'll read in
[23:59] psalm 23
[24:00] it's the picture of god placing all
[24:03] things
[24:04] under the feet of this king
[24:08] and as a result of that that king
[24:11] becomes the reflection
[24:13] of his strength in his dominion
[24:17] so as we read psalm 21 together put
[24:19] yourself in the vision
[24:20] put yourself in the scripture as god
[24:23] placed
[24:24] kings who have been given dominion
[24:28] over earth let's read that together in
[24:31] psalm 21
[24:33] the king shall joy and thy strength o
[24:36] lord
[24:37] and in thy salvation how greatly shall
[24:39] he rejoice
[24:41] thou has given him his heart's desire
[24:44] and has not
[24:45] the request of his lips selah for thou
[24:48] prevented
[24:49] him with the blessings of goodness thou
[24:52] satist a crown of pure gold
[24:54] on his head he asked life of thee and
[24:57] thou gavest at him
[24:58] even length of days forever and ever
[25:01] his glory is great in thy salvation
[25:04] honor and majesty has thou laid upon him
[25:08] for thou hast made him most blessed
[25:10] forever thou hast made him exceeding
[25:12] glad
[25:13] with thy countenance for the king
[25:16] trusteth in the lord
[25:17] and through the mercy of the most high
[25:19] he shall not be moved
[25:21] thine hand shall find out all thine
[25:24] enemies
[25:24] thy right hand shall find out those that
[25:27] hate thee
[25:28] thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in
[25:31] the time of thine anchor
[25:32] the lord shall swallow them up in his
[25:35] wrath and the fire
[25:36] shall devour them their fruit shalt thou
[25:39] destroy from the earth
[25:40] and their seed from among the children
[25:42] of men
[25:43] for they intended evil against thee they
[25:46] imagined a mischievous device which they
[25:49] are not able to perform
[25:51] therefore shalt thou make them turn
[25:53] their back when thou
[25:55] shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy
[25:57] strings against the face of them
[25:59] be thou exalted lord in thine own
[26:02] strength
[26:03] so will we sing and praise thy power
[26:06] amen
[26:07] r amen praise the lord you may have your
[26:10] seats

[1:00:59] uh uh thankful for that amen
[1:01:02] amen let's turn our bibles in genesis
[1:01:04] chapter one
[1:01:14] says in the beginning god created the
[1:01:16] heavens and the earth
[1:01:18] it says and we
[1:01:24] let's drop off to verse 26 chapter 1
[1:01:26] verse 26 and god said
[1:01:29] let us make men in our image in our
[1:01:31] likeness
[1:01:32] let us let them have dominion over the
[1:01:35] fish of the sea
[1:01:36] over the fall of the air over the cattle
[1:01:39] of the
[1:01:40] of of the cattle and over all the earth
[1:01:44] and over every creeping thing that
[1:01:47] creepeth upon the earth
[1:01:49] so god created man in his own image
[1:01:52] in an image of god created he him
[1:01:56] male and few and female created he them
[1:01:59] and god blessed them and god said unto
[1:02:01] them be fruitful and multiply
[1:02:03] replenish the earth and subdue
[1:02:06] and subdue it have dominion over the
[1:02:09] fish
[1:02:10] and over the sea of the sea and over the
[1:02:13] files of the air and over
[1:02:15] every living thing that move it upon the
[1:02:19] amen let's also turn in exodus chapter
[1:02:23] 25 we're gonna
[1:02:26] start let's read from one through
[1:02:30] a nine it says then the lord speak unto
[1:02:32] moses saying
[1:02:34] speak speak unto the children of israel
[1:02:37] that you bring me an offering
[1:02:40] of every man that give that giveth he
[1:02:44] that giveth it willingly with his heart
[1:02:47] he shall take
[1:02:48] my he shall take my take my offering
[1:02:51] and in and this is the offering which he
[1:02:55] shall take of them gold silver and brass
[1:02:59] and blue and purple and scarlet and fine
[1:03:01] linen
[1:03:02] and goat's hair and rem skin dried
[1:03:05] red and badgers badger skin and
[1:03:08] shatim wood oil with oil for the
[1:03:12] for the light spices for anointing
[1:03:15] for anointing oil and for sweet
[1:03:19] incense onyx stones
[1:03:22] and and the stones to be set
[1:03:25] in the e-pod and for the breastplate
[1:03:29] and let them make me a sanctuary that i
[1:03:32] may dwell
[1:03:33] among them and i want you to remember
[1:03:35] that at a sanctuary that arabic trail
[1:03:37] among them
[1:03:38] according to all that i have shown thee
[1:03:42] after the pattern after the time after
[1:03:45] the pattern
[1:03:46] after the pattern of the tabernacle the
[1:03:48] pattern of all
[1:03:50] instruments thereof even so shall we
[1:03:52] make it
[1:03:53] man god bless this word you may have
[1:03:55] your seats this morning
[1:04:07] man want to continue on the same thought
[1:04:10] line that we
[1:04:11] talked about last sunday i believe
[1:04:14] on god's pattern in heaven god's pattern
[1:04:18] in heaven when we
[1:04:22] look at the word pattern i was looking
[1:04:24] at it this weekend
[1:04:25] is it speaks of it's a obviously there's
[1:04:28] a lot
[1:04:29] definition i thought this was almost in
[1:04:32] line with
[1:04:33] what we have in our heart it speaks
[1:04:35] about a regular way
[1:04:37] in which something happened or the way
[1:04:39] something is done
[1:04:41] is a regular arrangement of line shape
[1:04:44] colors etc for example as a design of
[1:04:48] material carpet or something
[1:04:50] a pattern is something that happens or
[1:04:53] appear in
[1:04:54] a regular or repeated way so it's
[1:04:57] something that that established
[1:04:58] something that you can follow
[1:05:00] it happens in the regular or repeated
[1:05:02] way
[1:05:03] a pattern exists a pattern exists in
[1:05:06] variable form
[1:05:08] they could be found in mathematicals and
[1:05:11] arts and everything so as we read this
[1:05:15] what we just want to bring to the
[1:05:17] attention
[1:05:18] so the when you it's set up in a way
[1:05:21] that it could be
[1:05:22] repeated so it carries a message within
[1:05:24] the pattern there's a message
[1:05:26] there's something that could be placed
[1:05:28] in a way that somebody can look at it as
[1:05:31] an
[1:05:31] example and follow and and it's there
[1:05:34] so that it allows that
[1:05:38] something could be traced that something
[1:05:40] could be
[1:05:41] reconstructed that something could be
[1:05:43] looked at and put back together
[1:05:45] by knowing the pattern behind it and we
[1:05:48] said that in everything
[1:05:50] there's a pattern we see patterns in
[1:05:52] everything that we look around us
[1:05:54] and and in god's words we see that
[1:05:56] there's a pattern
[1:05:57] uh we read in genesis chapter one even
[1:06:00] as we read the scripture says
[1:06:02] uh in the beginning god the spirit of
[1:06:05] god was moving upon the face of the
[1:06:08] earth
[1:06:08] and brother branham talks about how that
[1:06:11] god
[1:06:11] came and he was the the the great uh
[1:06:15] spirit it was the fountain of love in
[1:06:17] the beginning and
[1:06:18] he was the one who filled all time in
[1:06:20] space he didn't have a place that could
[1:06:22] contain him
[1:06:24] it's it's like i said last time it's
[1:06:26] beyond our own imagination or
[1:06:27] understanding
[1:06:29] to think when we because every time we
[1:06:31] try to think we think
[1:06:32] in terms of the world we think we try
[1:06:35] but to think that
[1:06:36] before even the world was that there was
[1:06:38] somebody and the world came out of him
[1:06:41] it becomes a challenge for us to even
[1:06:43] put that together
[1:06:44] so he came and he says it was this great
[1:06:46] fountain of love who filled all time in
[1:06:49] space
[1:06:49] and he was this fountain of many colors
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:53] that's what it was and and within him he
[1:06:55] decided that he wanted to do
[1:06:57] something he decided that he wanted to
[1:07:00] create he decided that he wanted to
[1:07:01] bring
[1:07:02] out something and the first phone that
[1:07:04] we know that's spoken of in the bible is
[1:07:06] he became the logos
[1:07:08] and but branham says that one place says
[1:07:10] the sun at the footstep door of the
[1:07:13] father
[1:07:13] the logos we know that to be the word so
[1:07:16] he comes and he takes a certain form
[1:07:19] and from that form he creates everything
[1:07:23] from that form the creation is made and
[1:07:26] and i i want to get back to this to say
[1:07:28] that
[1:07:29] in this form as god is creating the
[1:07:32] purpose
[1:07:33] is for him to reflect himself the the
[1:07:36] purpose of the earth was not so the
[1:07:38] earth could be something that looked
[1:07:40] nice that we could look at and enjoy it
[1:07:42] and everything
[1:07:42] but random says this it said when a man
[1:07:45] builds a house
[1:07:46] is for him to dwell in it so when god
[1:07:48] created
[1:07:49] his creation when he puts it together
[1:07:52] when he put the heavens when he put the
[1:07:54] earth
[1:07:54] it was for the sole purpose that we
[1:07:56] could look everywhere
[1:07:57] and see god we could look in nature and
[1:08:00] see
[1:08:01] god we could look around and see the
[1:08:03] mountains and see the animal kingdom
[1:08:05] look at the fish
[1:08:06] and look at the sea and look at all of
[1:08:08] that and in everything we need to look
[1:08:11] be ha have the ability to see god
[1:08:13] reflected in it
[1:08:15] that's what his desire and i'll say this
[1:08:17] just the same way he wanted to reflect
[1:08:20] himself in the world
[1:08:21] god wanted to reflect to himself in our
[1:08:23] flesh
[1:08:25] because remember the same thing that the
[1:08:27] same way verbatim tells us that he deals
[1:08:29] with the earth
[1:08:30] he's the same way that he deals with man
[1:08:32] if
[1:08:33] if the creation of the world was to be a
[1:08:36] reflection of god
[1:08:37] the creation of man was to be the
[1:08:39] ultimate creation
[1:08:41] of the reflection of god in fact it
[1:08:44] created him to have dominion
[1:08:46] he created him to be a god on earth and
[1:08:49] one that
[1:08:50] god can look and see himself through and
[1:08:52] and we are told that even as he was
[1:08:54] naming the animal he'll come and call
[1:08:56] him
[1:08:57] this is a lion and this is a lamb and he
[1:09:00] named him according to the nature and
[1:09:02] everything
[1:09:02] god will come and approve of it and say
[1:09:05] this is
[1:09:06] exactly what i was looking for so he
[1:09:08] came from the mind he came from this
[1:09:10] uh heaven that we talked about it's not
[1:09:13] the sky per se
[1:09:14] but this mind that constructed
[1:09:17] everything
[1:09:18] and he wanted to display it in the world
[1:09:21] so so we find out as we said the earth
[1:09:25] and the creation was being made to match
[1:09:28] something that god wanted to achieve and
[1:09:31] and
[1:09:31] and we we we talks and he says
[1:09:34] uh he began to speak uh about the things
[1:09:37] around us he says
[1:09:39] now um these he speaks about the
[1:09:42] creation and he speaks about
[1:09:44] um the the the very dimension
[1:09:48] that exists and the reason for the
[1:09:49] dimension that we live in today
[1:09:51] and it says now uh uh these things
[1:09:54] it says these people here in this
[1:09:57] channel so he's speaking about
[1:09:59] uh here we are if we say just to lay it
[1:10:02] out
[1:10:02] down before i move on uh this dimension
[1:10:05] that we live in
[1:10:06] is the dimension of manifestation uh we
[1:10:10] it's the realm of manifestation if i may
[1:10:12] say
[1:10:13] and there's a spirit rhyme on both sides
[1:10:15] that is pressing to be manifested in
[1:10:18] this realm
[1:10:19] and we understand that and we see that
[1:10:21] we we identify
[1:10:23] spirits by the way they manifest
[1:10:25] themselves
[1:10:26] or we understand even ourselves we are
[1:10:29] not just this
[1:10:30] flesh we are the human or the spirit
[1:10:32] that dwells within the flesh
[1:10:34] uh this flesh is just a means by which
[1:10:37] we can manifest
[1:10:38] or that we can uh come and show what is
[1:10:41] it that the spirit that's behind this
[1:10:43] flesh is
[1:10:44] so he comes and he speaks about the
[1:10:46] dimension it says there's dimension up
[1:10:48] and there's dimension down and that's
[1:10:50] what i'll pick up and it says
[1:10:52] now this people here in these channels
[1:10:54] is influenced from two sides
[1:10:57] from two different sides it said now
[1:10:59] this
[1:11:00] this one side going up uh this way
[1:11:03] and here's the trinity and this side
[1:11:05] going out the the the
[1:11:07] away it's a trinity it says now
[1:11:11] now the first place on this side
[1:11:14] is the soul of the anja's and he's
[1:11:16] speaking about the dimension below
[1:11:18] so this is the dimension of
[1:11:20] manifestation
[1:11:22] if it drops down below is the soul of
[1:11:24] the unjust
[1:11:25] it says when a man die he goes into a
[1:11:28] place waiting for judgment
[1:11:30] jesus went to preach to the souls that
[1:11:32] were in prison there
[1:11:34] next is the demon so behind the unjust
[1:11:37] right below the unjust justice the demon
[1:11:40] he says the next
[1:11:41] is is devil is is the devil and hell
[1:11:44] going up it says first he says now
[1:11:48] then there is there is a ghost the
[1:11:52] spirit of the dead that never
[1:11:54] repented it says they are waiting for
[1:11:56] the judgment
[1:11:58] and the only thing they know is frolic
[1:12:00] and what they
[1:12:01] and what they did he says now now he
[1:12:04] says now
[1:12:05] up here there's a christian
[1:12:08] uh there are these christians are
[1:12:10] influenced from above
[1:12:12] it says this is the parable up here
[1:12:15] in another ghost is the holy ghost the
[1:12:18] ghost of
[1:12:19] a man it says jesus says the holy ghost
[1:12:22] the holy ghost influences his church
[1:12:26] this rhyme of the mortal so the holy
[1:12:28] ghost is here to influence the realm of
[1:12:30] the mortal
[1:12:31] and then it says the devil and these
[1:12:34] spirits
[1:12:34] influence man it says now look the next
[1:12:38] is the angel and the next is god
[1:12:42] it says now here is here now here
[1:12:45] every model here is influenced by one of
[1:12:48] this world
[1:12:49] see what i mean so now he's speaking to
[1:12:51] us
[1:12:52] to see uh even as i'm getting back here
[1:12:56] these these spirits so this realm
[1:12:59] are pressing into in order for them to
[1:13:02] manifest themselves
[1:13:04] in order for for what they are to be
[1:13:06] shown on the other side
[1:13:08] in order for them to display themselves
[1:13:10] on the other hand
[1:13:11] in order for or for what they want to
[1:13:13] achieve and
[1:13:14] and and and and where they want to take
[1:13:17] you and what they want you to display
[1:13:19] and there's no such thing as just me
[1:13:21] doing it myself
[1:13:24] and that's why even as a human we have
[1:13:27] to be aware
[1:13:28] that there's a power influencing every
[1:13:30] single one of us to do
[1:13:32] the things we do you know if i do right
[1:13:35] there's a power behind me
[1:13:36] uh moving me to do right and if i do
[1:13:39] wrong there's a spirit behind
[1:13:41] that's trying to cause you to do wrong
[1:13:43] they all dare
[1:13:44] to press in order to create a reflection
[1:13:47] to be seen in this realm
[1:13:52] and then the prophet also speaks how you
[1:13:54] know
[1:13:55] in who's this melchizedek so now this
[1:13:58] is now we're talking about the kingdom
[1:14:00] of god pressing
[1:14:02] and trying to reflect himself in this
[1:14:04] realm now
[1:14:05] he speaks about how this melchizedek was
[1:14:08] talking about
[1:14:09] it was this great spirit how that became
[1:14:12] this great fountain of love that we
[1:14:13] talked
[1:14:14] about he came and he moved into a form
[1:14:16] of logos
[1:14:17] and the final goal he says he was always
[1:14:20] wanting to move towards flesh
[1:14:22] but he said when he came when he came to
[1:14:25] abraham
[1:14:26] it was it was that same logos or that
[1:14:30] same theophany
[1:14:31] it was not yet the flesh of jesus
[1:14:34] because the flesh of jesus was not yet
[1:14:36] born
[1:14:36] but yet it was the same god who came and
[1:14:39] he manifested himself
[1:14:41] and him says he took he just took off
[1:14:43] the uh
[1:14:44] 16 element he took off the earth and he
[1:14:46] just blew into it
[1:14:48] and he used the body to come down why it
[1:14:50] was the same god that came and
[1:14:52] manifested
[1:14:53] and the scripture says that abraham
[1:14:54] looked at him and called him
[1:14:56] god and that becomes very important
[1:15:00] because that same manifestation happens
[1:15:02] here at the end time
[1:15:03] when we look at him we can't call him
[1:15:05] anything different
[1:15:07] we can look at a man turn his back and
[1:15:09] reproduce the same words
[1:15:10] and we can look at him and say we have
[1:15:13] seen god
[1:15:15] you know i i i come to a place that it's
[1:15:18] very important we begin to realize
[1:15:21] regardless of our own limitation let's
[1:15:24] not limit the word of god
[1:15:26] regardless of our own lack of
[1:15:28] understanding or
[1:15:29] lack of revelation let the word say what
[1:15:32] the word says
[1:15:34] and let the word prove itself and let
[1:15:36] god come to you
[1:15:38] and give you the revelation that you
[1:15:39] need in order for you to move upwards
[1:15:42] because yes where we are we can see god
[1:15:45] in creation and we thank him for it
[1:15:48] we rejoice over it we can talk about the
[1:15:50] great fountain of love and
[1:15:52] and see what he did in the beginning we
[1:15:54] can go back and look at jesus christ
[1:15:56] and see that the fullness of god dwelled
[1:15:59] in that man
[1:16:00] and we knew it was the main jesus and
[1:16:02] god dwelled in him
[1:16:04] for the purpose of revealing himself you
[1:16:06] know there was no man like he was
[1:16:10] and god took the body and glorify it oh
[1:16:13] but in this
[1:16:14] end time it's not so much the flesh of
[1:16:16] jesus christ
[1:16:18] we have to go right back into that
[1:16:20] theophany
[1:16:21] that word that was in the beginning that
[1:16:24] came back
[1:16:24] and it's manifesting himself again here
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:31] and i want to say this it's very
[1:16:33] important we realize
[1:16:34] it's the same god why because we we
[1:16:37] can't say that god was in the heaven
[1:16:40] god was the fountain of love it was in
[1:16:42] christ
[1:16:43] and come back to ourselves and begin to
[1:16:45] doubt about that same god dwelling in
[1:16:47] you
[1:16:48] somewhat it becomes a watered-down
[1:16:50] person that's not strong enough
[1:16:52] that's not good enough that cannot
[1:16:54] achieve anything
[1:16:56] no it's the same god it's the same
[1:16:59] attribute
[1:17:00] it's the same power and it's in you to
[1:17:02] accomplish
[1:17:03] what he predestinated you in that flesh
[1:17:06] to do
[1:17:08] he didn't call us in this flesh to die
[1:17:10] on the cross
[1:17:11] he didn't call us on this flesh to to to
[1:17:14] to perhaps give our lives like he did on
[1:17:17] the other
[1:17:18] the purpose of christ coming is because
[1:17:20] it was the sacrificial lamb
[1:17:22] he gave his life it was the only sinless
[1:17:24] that there was
[1:17:25] but the purpose that he did that was so
[1:17:27] he can clean the human race
[1:17:29] so he can clean a group of people and
[1:17:32] like in a group of people that he
[1:17:34] himself not another god he himself can
[1:17:37] come and dwell in them
[1:17:44] so it becomes very important that we
[1:17:46] look at what the word said
[1:17:49] what in that mind what was the purpose
[1:17:51] behind what was spoken
[1:17:53] because remember that's the reflection
[1:17:56] that we have
[1:17:57] that's the only thing we want to reflect
[1:17:59] because remember
[1:18:00] we read it last time as he said as he
[1:18:03] came to job and he looked at him and
[1:18:04] says
[1:18:05] i it says yeah you are and it's just
[1:18:09] things that are happening to you and
[1:18:11] you're lamenting and finding out
[1:18:13] oh you know i cursed the day that i was
[1:18:15] born and
[1:18:16] and he spoke so many things and and how
[1:18:19] and the scripture says that god came to
[1:18:21] him in the form of whirlwind
[1:18:23] he steps out and he began to look at him
[1:18:25] he says now i want you to i want to ask
[1:18:27] you where were you
[1:18:29] when the sons of god when i lay the
[1:18:31] foundation of the earth
[1:18:32] when those sons of god rejoice and
[1:18:34] shouted for joy
[1:18:36] where were you at that time why because
[1:18:39] if you can answer that question then you
[1:18:42] can know that
[1:18:43] in god's mind it was all settled
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:47] why because if you can answer that
[1:18:49] question what were you
[1:18:50] exactly what part were you playing in
[1:18:53] this
[1:18:54] what part when you were rejoicing when
[1:18:56] you were there
[1:18:57] i saw you there you were already
[1:19:00] there so everything that's happening
[1:19:02] here nothing will change that
[1:19:04] because remember it's the word of god he
[1:19:07] already
[1:19:08] spoken it and nothing can change it
[1:19:13] so he comes in and he begins to speak
[1:19:19] he he says let us make man in our image
[1:19:23] and i want to say this this was a
[1:19:25] perfect plan
[1:19:26] let us make man in our image and he made
[1:19:29] the man
[1:19:30] in the image it was a spirit man that he
[1:19:32] made
[1:19:33] we understand that because it was the
[1:19:35] spirit that moved upon the
[1:19:37] face of the earth so he came and he made
[1:19:39] a spirit man
[1:19:41] and and and because he he wanted some
[1:19:44] reflection
[1:19:45] he created the spirit man who was in his
[1:19:48] own reflection
[1:19:49] and he didn't stop there the scripture
[1:19:51] says that there was no man to till the
[1:19:53] earth
[1:19:54] god takes that spirit man and dwells it
[1:19:56] into the flesh
[1:19:57] so he can contact the earth earth for
[1:20:00] contacting the earth and then the spirit
[1:20:02] to contact in god
[1:20:04] and and and and yet we are we we look at
[1:20:07] ourselves
[1:20:08] oftentimes we saw concern about the
[1:20:11] flesh
[1:20:12] then we are the spirit
[1:20:15] and yet we are we take care of this ten
[1:20:18] cents person
[1:20:20] we we worry so much more about him than
[1:20:23] we worry about the soul
[1:20:25] and the spirit that was created in the
[1:20:27] image of god
[1:20:28] yet we are because remember it it's
[1:20:31] the reflection of god and the flesh is
[1:20:34] not the reflection of god
[1:20:36] in fact the flesh is a curse that that
[1:20:39] came by the way
[1:20:40] when men sin and and it caused him to
[1:20:42] sin this flesh can never be redeemed
[1:20:45] the scripture says that if this body of
[1:20:47] flesh be dissolved
[1:20:48] we have another one already waiting now
[1:20:51] it didn't say when you die then the body
[1:20:53] will be made no
[1:20:54] it's already waiting in fact what
[1:20:57] branham says when you heard this message
[1:21:00] you heard from your theophany you heard
[1:21:02] from that other flesh just calling it
[1:21:05] calling come up i i it says it's like a
[1:21:08] baby being born
[1:21:09] it says that you when when you have need
[1:21:11] of something
[1:21:12] when the flesh needs something he has to
[1:21:15] send a signal
[1:21:16] something has to be sent to this flesh
[1:21:18] so we can be prepared to fit into that
[1:21:21] body
[1:21:21] my brother my sister we can say just
[1:21:23] like jesus said
[1:21:25] i come from god i go back to god there's
[1:21:28] no difference at all
[1:21:30] why because that body was already made
[1:21:33] [Applause]
[1:21:35] i got to prepare you a place so that
[1:21:38] where i
[1:21:38] am that you may be also why it's the
[1:21:41] mind that created all things
[1:21:43] and not mind is a perfect mind
[1:21:49] so he comes and
[1:21:53] we look at him and we see him in this
[1:21:55] realm of manifestation
[1:21:58] and he comes and is reflected
[1:22:03] and manifest in this reign of mortal
[1:22:07] the holy spirit the holy ghost
[1:22:09] influencing his church in this realm of
[1:22:12] motto it says and the devil by his
[1:22:16] spirit
[1:22:17] influencing man also i began to think
[1:22:20] about jesus
[1:22:21] as he was tempted the scripture tells us
[1:22:23] that he came in
[1:22:25] 40 days and went through the wilderness
[1:22:27] and he began to be tempted
[1:22:29] and the same devil came now i want you
[1:22:31] to know
[1:22:33] years jesus is laying out a pattern for
[1:22:35] all the believers
[1:22:37] because remember barumanam says that he
[1:22:39] was the most gifted man that there is
[1:22:42] but yet he never used his gift to cast
[1:22:44] out the devil
[1:22:45] he never used his gift in order for him
[1:22:47] to cast him out
[1:22:48] he says he use what the word now i want
[1:22:51] you to
[1:22:52] what is the word he's basically
[1:22:54] reporting back to the perfect mind of
[1:22:57] god
[1:22:58] that can never be changed what is the
[1:23:00] word it's that creative power that made
[1:23:03] all things
[1:23:04] to come into existence it's that form
[1:23:07] that place that god gave god when he
[1:23:10] began to create all things
[1:23:12] so he comes and he began to be tempted
[1:23:14] and now he says to him
[1:23:16] why don't you do this it's written this
[1:23:18] and this and this
[1:23:19] jesus tells him it is also written and i
[1:23:22] was just thinking about that
[1:23:23] it's written it's written what does that
[1:23:25] really mean
[1:23:26] it means jesus was quoting something
[1:23:30] that had the authority
[1:23:32] something that was that had the final
[1:23:34] say that even the devil knew that could
[1:23:37] not be
[1:23:37] changed when you say it's written you
[1:23:40] say there's a decree
[1:23:42] it's there's something that's in stone
[1:23:44] there's something that cannot be moved
[1:23:46] there's something that's already uttered
[1:23:48] and cannot be taken back
[1:23:50] when you say it's written you're showing
[1:23:52] that this is the final say of god
[1:23:55] and it cannot be taken away and that's
[1:23:58] what jesus overcame by
[1:24:00] and he overcame by it because he knew
[1:24:02] that he would have his brothers and
[1:24:04] sisters come behind him
[1:24:05] that would overcome by the same word
[1:24:11] so i want to say to us tonight this
[1:24:13] morning unless we
[1:24:14] establish a pattern unless we get into
[1:24:18] the pattern that god's established
[1:24:20] for us to get back into eden we're not
[1:24:23] going to be able to make it
[1:24:25] we cannot as we read here god didn't ask
[1:24:28] moses and say
[1:24:30] go build yourself a temple make it as
[1:24:33] nice looking as possible
[1:24:34] and then i'll come and dwell in it
[1:24:38] but you know what that's what all the
[1:24:40] churches have done
[1:24:42] they've constructed themselves a temple
[1:24:44] they've constructed themselves
[1:24:46] arcs and they've constructed themselves
[1:24:48] all kinds of things our pastor preached
[1:24:50] on one man denomination
[1:24:52] what is it it's man bringing his own
[1:24:54] interpretation
[1:24:56] and thinking that god will meet him in
[1:24:58] in his interpretation
[1:25:00] no god interprets his word by bringing
[1:25:02] it to pass
[1:25:04] and the word of god comes to the
[1:25:06] prophets
[1:25:09] so by by by not taking the word of god
[1:25:12] and
[1:25:13] following it at the letter doing exactly
[1:25:16] what he said
[1:25:17] god cannot dwell in that temple so it
[1:25:19] was only
[1:25:20] after moses followed everything that was
[1:25:23] given to him
[1:25:24] built it according to the speck and the
[1:25:26] colors and
[1:25:27] everything that god gave him that's when
[1:25:29] the glory of god came down
[1:25:31] and dwell in that temple and so it is
[1:25:34] with us
[1:25:35] unless we can follow we can repent from
[1:25:37] our sins and
[1:25:38] be baptized and and repent of everything
[1:25:41] and sanctify that's when the holy ghost
[1:25:44] will come into the temple
[1:25:49] amen
[1:25:52] the scripture says we read this last
[1:25:55] time he says
[1:25:56] ye are a chosen generation
[1:26:06] ye are a chosen generation
[1:26:09] a royal priest priesthood a holy nation
[1:26:14] a peculiar people that you should
[1:26:17] show forth the praises of him who had
[1:26:20] called you out of darkness into the
[1:26:22] marvelous light
[1:26:24] in that yes the scripture is telling us
[1:26:28] the pattern that by which we should walk
[1:26:33] it says you are chosen people you're not
[1:26:36] like just anybody out there
[1:26:38] israel was hand picked to people
[1:26:42] god verbatim calls about talks about the
[1:26:44] calling of abraham
[1:26:45] it says abraham signify election
[1:26:49] there was nothing that abraham did in
[1:26:51] order for god to choose him
[1:26:53] there was nothing that god abraham did
[1:26:56] for god to
[1:26:57] love him and everything it was all god
[1:27:01] trying to achieve something it was all
[1:27:04] god
[1:27:05] trying to reflect himself in the world
[1:27:08] it was a god
[1:27:09] trying to build himself a nation and he
[1:27:12] picked a man by which he will build that
[1:27:14] nation
[1:27:15] he called him out and out of his country
[1:27:18] and
[1:27:19] he he bring him to a place and and and
[1:27:21] he
[1:27:22] he gave him a son and and we we
[1:27:24] understand that
[1:27:25] the promised son was jesus christ and i
[1:27:28] will come and he will
[1:27:29] uh uh uh this one will be the natural
[1:27:32] sun by isaac
[1:27:33] that will build the nation of israel but
[1:27:35] yet there was another spiritual son
[1:27:36] that was to come and save the world so
[1:27:39] all of that was god's
[1:27:41] doing and he had nothing to do with
[1:27:43] abraham
[1:27:45] all that abraham was to do was to walk
[1:27:48] in the pattern
[1:27:49] in the world that was laid before him it
[1:27:51] said father it
[1:27:53] took him and he took him from his own
[1:27:55] country he followed
[1:27:56] wherever he took him and followed
[1:27:58] whatever god wanted him to do he did
[1:28:01] even after he done wrong god was able to
[1:28:04] bring him back why
[1:28:05] because god said that the son was going
[1:28:07] to come by abraham
[1:28:08] and sarah so god preserved them until
[1:28:11] the sun
[1:28:12] came so is it with us today we have to
[1:28:15] be
[1:28:16] mindful that we are not made to be like
[1:28:19] the world
[1:28:20] we are not because i say this because
[1:28:23] you know i i understand we are in the
[1:28:26] flesh
[1:28:27] and we were but we have to understand
[1:28:29] the reason that we are
[1:28:30] in the flesh is for the purpose of
[1:28:32] manifestation because this is the realm
[1:28:34] of manifestation
[1:28:36] but we are so easily taken up into the
[1:28:39] things of the world
[1:28:41] we are so almighty so easily because
[1:28:44] remember the devil
[1:28:45] what he wants is he wants you to stay
[1:28:48] away
[1:28:49] to keep you away from you manifesting
[1:28:52] god to this generation
[1:28:54] he wants you to keep you away from the
[1:28:56] purpose which you were put here
[1:28:58] and in doing so we realized that we find
[1:29:01] ourselves
[1:29:02] always carried into the things of the
[1:29:04] world and
[1:29:05] failing to achieve the things which we
[1:29:07] were called to do
[1:29:11] we find ourselves in the fashions of the
[1:29:13] world
[1:29:15] in the games the entertainment of the
[1:29:17] world and it's not
[1:29:18] calling us necessarily uh to go out and
[1:29:22] to do uh
[1:29:25] insanely sinful stuff but what he wants
[1:29:28] us to do
[1:29:29] is to keep our mind occupied
[1:29:32] with the things of the world engage into
[1:29:35] the things of the world
[1:29:36] that we fail to realize that i am here
[1:29:39] to reflect
[1:29:40] something and i want to say this god
[1:29:43] cannot be marked
[1:29:44] your life reflects who you are
[1:29:46] [Applause]
[1:29:49] the the way we connect ourselves the way
[1:29:52] we do things
[1:29:53] how we we we we live our lives every day
[1:29:56] it reflects something it reflects who
[1:29:58] you are who or you are
[1:30:00] influenced by one or the other kingdom
[1:30:04] and i want to say this the influence it
[1:30:06] depends on who you give yourself to
[1:30:09] you can be a christian but if you are
[1:30:11] not given to god
[1:30:13] the devil can influence you the devil
[1:30:16] can cause you to do
[1:30:18] things you don't want to do it can cause
[1:30:20] you to think things you don't want to do
[1:30:22] it can cause you to go in directions you
[1:30:24] want to want to go
[1:30:25] that's why we are called to hold on to
[1:30:27] the pattern find out what he said that
[1:30:29] we need to do
[1:30:30] and get to do it you know i'll say this
[1:30:34] i was
[1:30:35] uh uh just thinking you know there's
[1:30:37] often
[1:30:38] because of where i was born and how i
[1:30:41] was brought
[1:30:42] you know there comes days where you know
[1:30:44] i just woke up and
[1:30:45] and and in my heart i just feel like
[1:30:47] eating fufu
[1:30:50] it's just i can eat all the mashed
[1:30:51] potatoes and
[1:30:53] all the tacos and all the pasta and all
[1:30:56] that i could do
[1:30:56] but these days where i woke up it's just
[1:30:58] in me to eat it
[1:31:00] i just want to eat it because i feel
[1:31:02] satisfaction when i eat it
[1:31:06] and there's nothing that can replace it
[1:31:08] i can eat all the things i want to eat
[1:31:10] and it won't satisfy
[1:31:12] so is it with somebody who came from the
[1:31:14] pattern of god
[1:31:15] somebody who came from this mind you can
[1:31:18] feed him all the trash of the world that
[1:31:20] you want
[1:31:21] that will never satisfy why because that
[1:31:24] that
[1:31:25] thirst that that hunger is for
[1:31:28] specifically the word of
[1:31:30] god something that comes from that wrath
[1:31:32] in order for him to manifest it down
[1:31:34] here
[1:31:37] well how do we hear from our theophany
[1:31:39] it's the word
[1:31:41] in other words it's time for you to come
[1:31:44] up and
[1:31:45] it's time for you to get activated also
[1:31:48] the
[1:31:48] the triophane says this is the time
[1:31:51] oh and god comes and he knows this is
[1:31:54] the program
[1:31:55] i'm gonna meet him at that junction i'm
[1:31:57] going to meet him at that corner
[1:31:59] and you get activated and your heart
[1:32:02] starts on
[1:32:02] hungering for things that the world
[1:32:04] cannot give you
[1:32:07] and we need to feed that hunger we need
[1:32:10] to feed that hunger so we can gain
[1:32:12] strength
[1:32:24] well brandon picks it up
[1:32:30] he says
[1:32:36] speaking about god talking to job and he
[1:32:38] speaks about this
[1:32:40] old colored man he said the first i seen
[1:32:44] somebody with the holy ghost
[1:32:46] was an old colored man with a big long
[1:32:50] overcoat on they had to help him out
[1:32:54] he was so old like this and
[1:32:58] and he got up there and began to preach
[1:33:01] he says a lot of them preachers begin to
[1:33:03] preach about oh
[1:33:04] what it takes place here on earth he
[1:33:07] took the text back in job and
[1:33:10] he says where were you when i laid the
[1:33:12] foundation of the world
[1:33:14] and this is where my inspiration came
[1:33:16] from it says when the morning starts
[1:33:18] sang together and the sons of god
[1:33:20] shouted for joy
[1:33:21] he said you think you got some kind of
[1:33:24] new kind of religion
[1:33:26] said brother i just got the old times
[1:33:28] taste
[1:33:29] it says a brand new a brand new case of
[1:33:32] old time religious religion oh i tell
[1:33:36] you that's what we need
[1:33:37] we don't need something new to get us
[1:33:39] excited
[1:33:40] oh we just need that old one let it
[1:33:43] sprinkle with the spirit
[1:33:45] let the spirit reveal it to you and you
[1:33:47] will bring up the holy ghost
[1:33:50] and it says it says i just got this i
[1:33:52] said the brand new case of the old time
[1:33:54] religion
[1:33:55] and then after a while it says after a
[1:33:57] while the holy ghost got hold of him
[1:34:01] he says poor old fellow was so stiff
[1:34:04] he was standing there and he stretched
[1:34:07] himself
[1:34:08] up and kicked his heel together and said
[1:34:11] glory hallelujah said you ain't got
[1:34:14] enough space here for me to preach
[1:34:16] and walked off the platform
[1:34:19] that's what the gospel will do to you
[1:34:22] that's when you read your bible you
[1:34:23] begin to pray
[1:34:25] you just feel like this flesh cannot
[1:34:27] contain you anymore
[1:34:28] you just feel like you're about to burst
[1:34:30] then you just feel like i can't take it
[1:34:33] anymore
[1:34:34] why because it's the it's that inner man
[1:34:37] calling for the offering to come on a
[1:34:39] manifestation he said i said brother
[1:34:43] if it's god if if he'll do that for a
[1:34:45] man
[1:34:46] 80 years old what will it do to for me
[1:34:50] it says i want it and i want to ask this
[1:34:54] morning
[1:34:54] is that the kind of gospel we want is
[1:34:57] that the kind of god we want
[1:34:59] we don't want to be all stiffed up but
[1:35:01] random talks about the church condition
[1:35:03] just be all starchy and and people
[1:35:06] coming
[1:35:06] you know dressed up and you know when
[1:35:08] they sing the gospel they just put the
[1:35:10] nose up in the air
[1:35:11] and just wait you know move their head a
[1:35:13] little bit you know just you know bring
[1:35:15] it on and you know
[1:35:16] just introing and and and you know just
[1:35:19] as you know
[1:35:20] stiff as could be and everything oh no
[1:35:23] i want something that will just get me
[1:35:25] going i want something i can praise my
[1:35:27] god for
[1:35:29] oh i tell you when they sing the songs
[1:35:31] i'm not looking at the song leader
[1:35:33] i'm thinking about where god got me i'm
[1:35:36] thinking about the opportunity i've been
[1:35:38] given
[1:35:39] to sit in the congregation of saints
[1:35:41] realizing that i'm not
[1:35:43] i'm not worthy of it all at all
[1:35:45] realizing that he saved me
[1:35:47] he gave me the opportunity to praise him
[1:35:50] and i want all the world to know
[1:35:52] that he's a wonderful god
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:05] it says i want to say this
[1:36:11] it's important we realize we're going
[1:36:14] somewhere
[1:36:17] and if you've lived long enough on the
[1:36:19] earth you don't need to live
[1:36:20] many years you know that there was some
[1:36:23] now with us that went by the graveside
[1:36:26] you know that some not worth with us
[1:36:27] they were no longer with us
[1:36:30] you see the evolution you know that man
[1:36:32] is given a certain number of years to
[1:36:34] live
[1:36:35] you know that one day the end is coming
[1:36:38] whether it be by rapture or by natural
[1:36:40] death
[1:36:41] the end is coming and and
[1:36:44] and believe his heart desire is to be at
[1:36:47] the place where i know
[1:36:49] i've been walking on the right pattern i
[1:36:52] don't want to be caught
[1:36:53] outside i don't want to be caught doing
[1:36:55] something
[1:36:56] that god didn't call me to do i don't
[1:36:59] want to be called outside be caught
[1:37:01] outside of the
[1:37:02] the provision that is given i want to
[1:37:04] make sure when my time comes
[1:37:06] that i'm doing exactly what he called me
[1:37:08] to do that i'm walking according to the
[1:37:10] pattern that he's given me
[1:37:12] that i'm obeying and walking according
[1:37:14] to the word
[1:37:19] the prodigal son
[1:37:22] was taught right
[1:37:25] he was giving all the right instructions
[1:37:28] but he decided to go taste something
[1:37:30] else
[1:37:32] but madame speaks about how the parent's
[1:37:33] heart was broken
[1:37:36] how they would hear him out and he would
[1:37:40] say
[1:37:42] what i want to say he got with the wrong
[1:37:44] crowd
[1:37:47] they gave him the wrong kind of
[1:37:48] instruction he came and he said
[1:37:51] father i want you to give me all that
[1:37:53] mine
[1:37:56] i want you to give me all my man because
[1:37:58] everybo it says all my friends
[1:38:00] this is what they're doing this is what
[1:38:02] they are
[1:38:03] into you know a new app comes in oh this
[1:38:06] is what everybody's going
[1:38:08] you know a new something comes up oh
[1:38:10] this is the new fashion
[1:38:12] you know this comes up oh this is what
[1:38:14] everybody's doing
[1:38:15] following the mass always trying to
[1:38:18] appease something always trying to make
[1:38:21] sure that i don't look like
[1:38:23] i'm left behind i want everybody to make
[1:38:25] sure that i'm
[1:38:26] i look cool just like everybody
[1:38:32] that's what he did he didn't want his
[1:38:35] friends to know
[1:38:36] or he didn't want them to know that he
[1:38:38] stood for something
[1:38:40] that he didn't want them to he didn't
[1:38:42] want to feel ashamed to get to a place
[1:38:43] where
[1:38:44] i said i have good parents at home they
[1:38:46] give me everything i
[1:38:47] i have i don't need to come with you
[1:38:52] he followed and we know the scripture
[1:38:55] says that he took him to a far country
[1:38:59] someplace with no destination seems like
[1:39:02] the destination
[1:39:03] and we know that destination is hell but
[1:39:05] it's like it seems like it's always it's
[1:39:07] a
[1:39:08] far place away from where you're
[1:39:10] supposed to be
[1:39:15] but the scripture says one day he came
[1:39:18] back to himself
[1:39:20] one day that theophany came calling
[1:39:24] one day because he was already in the
[1:39:27] mind
[1:39:27] to begin with because the scripture says
[1:39:30] every day
[1:39:31] the father will come and wait for him
[1:39:35] in the father's mind the son is never
[1:39:37] left
[1:39:38] in the father's mind the picture of the
[1:39:40] son was always there
[1:39:42] in the father's mind his room was always
[1:39:44] prepared
[1:39:45] in the father's mind they didn't take
[1:39:47] away everything they always laid
[1:39:49] everything
[1:39:50] they knew he would come back oh i tell
[1:39:52] you in the minds of god
[1:39:54] if we can understand that our sons and
[1:39:57] the loved ones that we have in the world
[1:39:59] i tell you in the perfect god mind of
[1:40:01] god we need to be like god we are called
[1:40:04] to be like god
[1:40:05] and know that his god is not going too
[1:40:07] far
[1:40:08] why is god i haven't given to god and
[1:40:11] there's no way he can go too far
[1:40:13] he can go as much as he wants but i know
[1:40:15] one day he'll come back
[1:40:16] why because that's exactly that was in
[1:40:19] the father's mind
[1:40:28] so the prophet speaks he said
[1:40:32] he speaks about the very image of christ
[1:40:38] in the laodicean church age i want you
[1:40:40] to listen to this it says now
[1:40:42] we find out that
[1:40:45] it puts some it puts a man right back in
[1:40:47] the place
[1:40:49] the people today the bible says over
[1:40:52] here
[1:40:52] in the scripture written down here i'd
[1:40:55] like to refer to it jesus said
[1:40:58] in the third chapter of revelation he
[1:41:00] says the
[1:41:01] audience church age it says that in the
[1:41:04] last
[1:41:04] age it says we always believe
[1:41:08] that we are living in the end time and
[1:41:10] this is the last age now
[1:41:12] compare this age with he compares this
[1:41:16] age with a rich young ruler compare them
[1:41:19] it says now
[1:41:20] didn't jesus say laodicean church was
[1:41:22] rich increased with good
[1:41:24] and need of nothing the congregation
[1:41:26] said amen
[1:41:27] he says isn't that the condition of the
[1:41:29] church today and yet christ
[1:41:31] is unfolded himself through three
[1:41:35] church ages through luther through
[1:41:37] wesley and through pentecostal age
[1:41:39] unfolded himself he says his word of
[1:41:43] justification sanctification
[1:41:45] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:41:47] restoration of gift
[1:41:48] and now his own personal identity
[1:41:51] among them now think about that his own
[1:41:54] personal identity among them
[1:41:56] and he says and see trying you reach
[1:41:59] young rulers business chicago
[1:42:01] see this this morning it continues on
[1:42:04] and he says
[1:42:04] laodicean we find out that all of all
[1:42:07] the other churches
[1:42:08] jesus was still in the church but in the
[1:42:11] laodicean church age
[1:42:12] he was outside
[1:42:17] now i want to say this and i think we
[1:42:19] read it all the time
[1:42:20] i i just read it this morning it just my
[1:42:23] mind kind of just woke up
[1:42:25] the devil is trying to keep jesus out of
[1:42:28] your life
[1:42:33] by all means possible if it's by
[1:42:36] providing
[1:42:37] by by way of technology by way of
[1:42:40] science by way of
[1:42:41] education he doesn't want a believer to
[1:42:44] rely on faith like we heard a couple
[1:42:47] a couple of months ago he doesn't want
[1:42:49] faith to have to do with
[1:42:51] anything he wants us to rely on this
[1:42:54] civilization
[1:42:55] and everything that they have to offer
[1:42:57] outside he doesn't want you to
[1:42:59] ever consider god in your mind
[1:43:02] when you're sick he wants to provide the
[1:43:04] medicine he wants to provide hospital
[1:43:07] you like a job the government will help
[1:43:09] you out he never wants you to go down on
[1:43:11] your knees and say god
[1:43:13] i need your help he's trying to keep
[1:43:17] and and and if he cannot get you there
[1:43:20] he's trying to keep you look warm
[1:43:23] the kind of believer oh you know that
[1:43:24] believes that that says they believe
[1:43:26] everything
[1:43:27] but there really never seeks for any of
[1:43:29] them
[1:43:32] i i believe god is the savior i believe
[1:43:35] god is a healer
[1:43:36] but you know i'll rely on my medicine
[1:43:38] and everything and no no problem with
[1:43:40] that because the prophet tells us to
[1:43:41] take it
[1:43:42] if it doesn't work then we go to god but
[1:43:44] to get you in a situation where
[1:43:46] you never actually depend on god to get
[1:43:49] you to a situation where
[1:43:51] you mix it up so much that it doesn't
[1:43:53] make any difference
[1:43:58] he says but only allowed to see in
[1:44:00] church age
[1:44:01] he was outside knocking trying to get in
[1:44:04] and in this age
[1:44:06] it says and in this age that when the
[1:44:08] manifestation of christ
[1:44:10] so perfect in the image of christ in his
[1:44:13] church
[1:44:14] until the church and as the brother said
[1:44:17] a while ago
[1:44:18] is closing the door and yet stand with
[1:44:22] love knocking
[1:44:23] if any men hunger and thirst it says
[1:44:26] but when i'm knocked it says do you
[1:44:28] understand the congregation say amen
[1:44:30] they said you expect you
[1:44:33] you expect a closed door it's loud you
[1:44:36] see in church age
[1:44:37] but the bible said he will be that way
[1:44:45] and we find out in the message identity
[1:44:49] of christ
[1:44:50] we find out two classes of people and
[1:44:53] that goes along and all
[1:44:55] and it says on one side is a
[1:44:56] fundamentalist the other is the
[1:44:58] pentecostal
[1:44:59] now the the pentecostal got something
[1:45:02] but they don't know
[1:45:03] who they are and the fundamentalists you
[1:45:06] know something
[1:45:07] but you ain't got nothing with it
[1:45:10] it says so now there it's just like a
[1:45:13] man
[1:45:13] has got money in the bank and can write
[1:45:16] to check
[1:45:17] the other can't write a check
[1:45:20] the either can write a check but it's
[1:45:21] got no money in the bank
[1:45:23] if you could ever get them together
[1:45:26] it would be a great thing listen he said
[1:45:29] but now
[1:45:30] in the face of this
[1:45:34] way we're trying to carry out the
[1:45:36] meeting is for you it says
[1:45:38] you as an individual for your need
[1:45:42] in christ salvation the healing
[1:45:45] the divine healing whatever you have
[1:45:47] need of
[1:45:49] whatever you have enough is to it says
[1:45:52] by faith
[1:45:55] know that you are
[1:45:58] in the presence of christ by faith
[1:46:02] you reach and get and get you reach and
[1:46:04] get it
[1:46:05] it says that's the only way we'll ever
[1:46:07] get it by faith
[1:46:08] we are saved by faith we are healed
[1:46:11] nothing that god can come down and do
[1:46:14] again
[1:46:14] he's already done it he says so you see
[1:46:18] the whole thing is god becoming tangible
[1:46:23] the whole thing is god becoming tangible
[1:46:27] the whole thing about us the whole thing
[1:46:30] about the reflection
[1:46:32] is so that god can become somewhat
[1:46:34] tangible
[1:46:35] we it would do us no good to come and
[1:46:37] preach the gospel and
[1:46:39] and talk about a wonderful god and all
[1:46:42] that he could do
[1:46:43] if we there's no way by which we can
[1:46:45] touch him
[1:46:46] if there's no way by which he can
[1:46:47] express himself
[1:46:49] if there's no way by which it can come
[1:46:51] and touch one another that's why it's
[1:46:53] important that we
[1:46:54] we we we reflect god for one another
[1:46:58] we we gather here as licks of fires put
[1:47:01] together
[1:47:02] we gather here as people that have
[1:47:04] brought something within the heart
[1:47:06] that they can come and put together and
[1:47:08] build a big fire
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:11] we're not gathered here as sinners that
[1:47:13] just came and
[1:47:14] they all want to be saved and they all
[1:47:16] want to be safe
[1:47:17] they save the sunday they go back
[1:47:19] sinners they come back next sunday to
[1:47:22] be saved that's not the economy of god
[1:47:24] the economy of god is he's looking for
[1:47:27] people
[1:47:28] to reflect something to reflect the
[1:47:31] works that he's done for them
[1:47:33] to reflect his goodness to reflect his
[1:47:35] grace
[1:47:36] to reflect his love
[1:47:40] he continues on it says
[1:47:44] it says and on that great day
[1:47:48] that's come that's to come when christ
[1:47:51] sits upon the throne of david and reign
[1:47:53] in the millennium
[1:47:54] it's god tangible in the earth
[1:47:57] it says he is now in you
[1:48:01] you are his and and
[1:48:04] and you've got eternal life your life
[1:48:07] your
[1:48:08] your life always was and and
[1:48:12] and you was god's thinking the color of
[1:48:14] your air whatever you are
[1:48:16] you you was you was god you was in god's
[1:48:19] thinking
[1:48:20] and you were you you were just
[1:48:22] materialized
[1:48:23] and then he says that's what god was
[1:48:26] when he was
[1:48:27] in the materialized in when he
[1:48:29] materialized in christ
[1:48:31] god displayed manifested in flesh
[1:48:35] in flesh in christ he
[1:48:38] became material god
[1:48:41] that was that we couldn't that we could
[1:48:43] touch first timothy 3 and 16
[1:48:46] it says without controversy great is the
[1:48:48] mystery of godliness
[1:48:50] that god was manifested in flesh
[1:48:53] he says it was god being made
[1:48:57] manifest god being manifested getting
[1:49:01] ready
[1:49:03] in the message continues on i believe
[1:49:05] same message he says
[1:49:07] then see god came down
[1:49:11] and the characteristics of god was
[1:49:13] christ
[1:49:14] he was the reflection he was god
[1:49:19] made visible notice god
[1:49:22] made visible in the beginning was the
[1:49:25] word
[1:49:26] it wasn't even god then god is
[1:49:29] is an object of worship one thing it
[1:49:31] says he was
[1:49:33] he was the eternal and in him was the
[1:49:35] attribute
[1:49:36] uh in him was the attribute and those
[1:49:39] attributes were thoughts
[1:49:40] and those thoughts were expressed to the
[1:49:42] word and the word was made manifest
[1:49:45] he said what is it it's all god
[1:49:50] becoming tangible you
[1:49:53] are part of god and jesus came to redeem
[1:49:56] those that were put
[1:49:57] that whose name was put on the land
[1:49:59] books of life before the foundation of
[1:50:01] the world
[1:50:02] it was in god's thought and and and
[1:50:05] what he what he came down to redeem and
[1:50:08] as soon as he strikes them
[1:50:10] they see it because the life is in there
[1:50:16] we've been stricken why because life is
[1:50:20] in there
[1:50:21] we see it because life is in there we
[1:50:24] see it because there's something that he
[1:50:26] placed in there
[1:50:27] and then i say if something is in there
[1:50:29] then the desire of that person
[1:50:32] is to reflect heaven it's not to reflect
[1:50:36] earth
[1:50:37] we don't want to just be caught up
[1:50:38] within this flesh there's a heaven to be
[1:50:41] reflected
[1:50:42] you know the scripture tells us in the
[1:50:44] end time it says that
[1:50:45] the the this is satan's eden but
[1:50:49] talks about how hell is on earth how
[1:50:52] that it's a reflection of the devil and
[1:50:54] and he says about even what he saw about
[1:50:56] the woman painted and all those things
[1:50:58] he looked at it he thought he was in
[1:51:00] hell
[1:51:02] but at the same time he lets us know
[1:51:04] that heaven is on earth
[1:51:06] why because there is a people here to
[1:51:08] reflect heaven
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:14] there has to be god is never left
[1:51:16] without a witness
[1:51:17] somebody is going to believe his word
[1:51:19] somebody is going to manifest it
[1:51:21] somebody will take him at his word
[1:51:23] somebody will believe it
[1:51:25] and carry the seed and manifest it
[1:51:31] we can't be left on our own devices he
[1:51:34] has placed us here
[1:51:35] to be a reflection of heaven
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:46] he says
[1:51:53] now remember in things that are to be
[1:52:00] he says now remember
[1:52:03] the bible says if this earthly
[1:52:06] tabernacle be dissolved
[1:52:09] if we perish be dissolved
[1:52:12] we have one already waiting
[1:52:18] now he walks through the process of
[1:52:21] birth
[1:52:22] of a little baby he says just as a
[1:52:24] little baby
[1:52:26] it's it's a it's it's a little muscle
[1:52:29] in the mother and twisting and turning
[1:52:32] it says and you notice you can take a
[1:52:35] woman
[1:52:36] if she's ever so foul
[1:52:40] he says but when she's becoming a mother
[1:52:43] the little
[1:52:44] he says just a little while before the
[1:52:46] baby is born
[1:52:47] there's a kindness about that woman but
[1:52:49] about the woman
[1:52:50] he says get around her there's always
[1:52:53] something
[1:52:54] she's more tender why there's a little
[1:52:56] angel spirit waiting to receive
[1:52:59] the natural body just as soon as the
[1:53:02] body is born
[1:53:04] the breath of life comes into it it says
[1:53:08] god's breath is in there and it becomes
[1:53:11] a living soul
[1:53:12] now just this baby just as this baby is
[1:53:15] being born
[1:53:16] then the spiritual body is there to
[1:53:19] receive it
[1:53:20] it says and now when this body drops
[1:53:23] here
[1:53:24] in the earth like the little baby is
[1:53:27] dropped
[1:53:28] also there is an immortal body
[1:53:31] waiting to receive the spirit back into
[1:53:33] it again
[1:53:34] it says oh what a great thing we are now
[1:53:38] in christ jesus amen babies
[1:53:41] babies in christ children of god waiting
[1:53:45] to be
[1:53:45] fully delivered waiting for the full
[1:53:48] deliverance sorry
[1:53:50] and the coming out of the lord jesus to
[1:53:52] receive up
[1:53:54] to receive us up unto himself when the
[1:53:57] body
[1:53:57] the mortal will take on immortality
[1:54:04] but when they there is a great file
[1:54:07] this it talks about the great file it
[1:54:09] says god has a foul of you in
[1:54:12] heaven
[1:54:15] and this is before you could be even
[1:54:16] manifested here on earth
[1:54:18] he has this foul of you in it on in
[1:54:22] in heaven and what you are to him
[1:54:26] is the manifestation of the file back
[1:54:29] here
[1:54:29] on earth and no doubt we go through our
[1:54:33] trouble and
[1:54:34] we try to figure it out and all those
[1:54:36] things and everything and god is just
[1:54:38] waiting
[1:54:39] he knows the day he knows the time when
[1:54:42] not
[1:54:43] when when when you when you come to a
[1:54:45] place where
[1:54:46] the birth hits you directly on
[1:54:49] communication
[1:54:50] right back home and you're talking back
[1:54:53] to that
[1:54:54] image of you that file of you that he
[1:54:56] had while you get back sync you sink
[1:54:59] back home you connect
[1:55:00] right back home to where you were or
[1:55:03] what you were supposed to be
[1:55:04] why because then on god can deposit of
[1:55:07] his own
[1:55:08] he can take you and bring your true
[1:55:10] sanctification to justification
[1:55:12] the baptism the holy holy spirit and
[1:55:14] bring you all the way up into adoption
[1:55:17] why because now he can say like he said
[1:55:20] to adam he says
[1:55:21] that's right that's right and we sent
[1:55:25] him
[1:55:25] do it in jesus christ the way he can
[1:55:28] look at you and say that's right
[1:55:30] i tell you this word is where we are
[1:55:32] bringing into
[1:55:33] it's where we are walking into if we can
[1:55:36] walk into that reflection
[1:55:38] if we can only follow what's being said
[1:55:40] if we can only follow the pattern that
[1:55:42] is laid
[1:55:43] it will lead us right back home
[1:55:47] like the little the the young man who
[1:55:49] was lost who had amnesia
[1:55:52] the young boy he came and he didn't know
[1:55:54] his home they looked at him he couldn't
[1:55:56] remember his name or anything
[1:55:58] oh i tell you we have amnesia here on
[1:56:00] earth we have that amnesia troubling us
[1:56:04] and then he just they saw him just move
[1:56:06] around and and the people wanted to stop
[1:56:08] him he said no just leave him let's
[1:56:09] watch what he doesn't
[1:56:11] and that's just because he stumbled into
[1:56:13] a train and he began to go in the train
[1:56:15] they're just watching him and says
[1:56:17] what is he gonna do oh my god where is
[1:56:18] he going he says no just watch him
[1:56:21] and he watch him and he goes and he goes
[1:56:22] and they see him stop at a certain place
[1:56:25] and
[1:56:25] and just get out of the train and they
[1:56:27] stop him and and he looked like
[1:56:29] just glimpse of things they they don't
[1:56:31] even know
[1:56:32] what he was doing it was making sense to
[1:56:34] him or not
[1:56:35] and he just looked and he lifted up his
[1:56:38] eyes and saw the water tower
[1:56:40] oh he began to walk and and going
[1:56:43] directly straight home
[1:56:44] why something was within him even after
[1:56:48] he lost his mind
[1:56:49] something was within him calling him
[1:56:51] home you can never forget home
[1:56:54] oh i tell you the same thing with
[1:56:55] believers this morning
[1:56:57] there's something within you that's
[1:56:59] calling home that wants to go home
[1:57:01] i want to go home i'm tired of this
[1:57:04] world and i don't like what i see in
[1:57:06] this world that
[1:57:07] this world is not my home i want to go
[1:57:09] home and because you desire that
[1:57:12] god is obligated to take you home
[1:57:17] the issue is we don't call home we don't
[1:57:19] need home
[1:57:20] we we rejoice in the things that we see
[1:57:23] we okay with the world the way it is
[1:57:26] but oh if we can hunger and trust the
[1:57:28] scripture says
[1:57:29] happy are those those that hunger and
[1:57:31] thirst that will be filled
[1:57:34] there's a promise for that
[1:57:42] says after in this
[1:57:45] who's this melchizedek then after you
[1:57:48] recognize the very
[1:57:51] word of god was eagle food then you left
[1:57:54] the other things
[1:57:57] it says you have been formed into a
[1:58:00] living
[1:58:01] image of the living god
[1:58:07] we are being formed into the living
[1:58:10] image
[1:58:11] i'm not talking to your flesh this
[1:58:13] morning
[1:58:15] i know you think we're crazy by hearing
[1:58:17] this thing
[1:58:18] that's all right sometimes i think we're
[1:58:20] crazy too
[1:58:22] but i'm talking to your spirit i'm
[1:58:24] talking to the person inside of you
[1:58:27] it's the living think about it you
[1:58:29] didn't get here by your own efforts
[1:58:34] you didn't work yourself up to be what
[1:58:36] you are right now
[1:58:37] in fact you didn't even choose by what
[1:58:39] parent you will come
[1:58:41] what country you will be born you chose
[1:58:43] nothing
[1:58:46] oh i tell you but if this morning we can
[1:58:49] come
[1:58:49] barbara says with the desire within our
[1:58:52] heart to see that manifestation
[1:58:54] it will come to pass why because if in
[1:58:57] the natural we didn't choose and this
[1:58:59] happened because that's the way god
[1:59:00] wanted it
[1:59:01] how much more when he places something
[1:59:03] within our hearts that's desiring to see
[1:59:06] those things
[1:59:06] the scripture says he will come to pass
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:14] into the image of the living god
[1:59:18] he said you heard from your theophany if
[1:59:21] this earthly be dissolved
[1:59:23] we have one waiting right you said is
[1:59:26] that right brother branham he says all
[1:59:27] right
[1:59:28] let's take a couple of uh he talks about
[1:59:30] a couple of eagles
[1:59:31] he talks about moses and then he talks
[1:59:34] he talks about
[1:59:36] moses on if the musician could come this
[1:59:42] morning
[1:59:47] i want to say this
[1:59:55] this word of god and this message that
[1:59:57] we have received
[2:00:01] it just didn't tell us about the
[2:00:03] beginning
[2:00:05] we could take that quote and they'd all
[2:00:08] call it men and what
[2:00:09] i'm talking about he talks all right
[2:00:11] back into the beginning
[2:00:14] and he's just not telling us about the
[2:00:16] situation here
[2:00:18] but i also want you to remember that he
[2:00:20] went beyond the curtain of curtin of
[2:00:22] time
[2:00:24] and told us what was in the future
[2:00:29] he told us what was in the future people
[2:00:32] that
[2:00:33] he preached this message too we're
[2:00:36] already there
[2:00:38] waiting
[2:00:40] people that heard the things that we are
[2:00:42] hearing this morning
[2:00:44] they're already on the other side oh my
[2:00:47] brother that's the kind of pattern i
[2:00:49] want to follow
[2:00:50] i don't want somebody to try some new
[2:00:52] stuff on me uh-uh it's not working
[2:00:55] i don't want any other gospel i want
[2:00:57] something that's confirmed
[2:00:59] that's talking about where i come from
[2:01:01] it's talking about today
[2:01:03] and it's already talking about the
[2:01:05] future and
[2:01:06] explaining about the people i'm not
[2:01:08] talking about people in other
[2:01:09] generations
[2:01:10] i'm not talking about oh he saw moses he
[2:01:13] saw abraham no
[2:01:14] people that believed this word of god
[2:01:17] the seventh angel word of god
[2:01:19] the reveal one of this hour that's what
[2:01:22] i'm talking about those people were
[2:01:24] already there
[2:01:27] i'm telling you let's skip the pattern
[2:01:29] let's skip the word
[2:01:30] let's keep walking let's keep believing
[2:01:33] it there's no chance you're going to go
[2:01:35] somewhere else if you believe this
[2:01:37] oh but if you let men well bring your
[2:01:39] own understanding and explain it away
[2:01:41] for you
[2:01:42] you're probably going to end up
[2:01:43] somewhere but if you believe it like the
[2:01:45] prophet said it
[2:01:46] you will be there
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:49] why it's a pattern it shows where
[2:01:53] something is getting
[2:01:54] it's showing the formula to get there
[2:01:56] and this formula has been proven it to
[2:01:58] be true
[2:01:59] just like jesus he took the inoculation
[2:02:02] of himself
[2:02:02] he came and he resurrected to show to
[2:02:05] the brothers that if you believe this
[2:02:07] if you take this you will be resurrected
[2:02:09] in the last day
[2:02:10] and here we are at the last day the
[2:02:12] scripture says
[2:02:13] if this body be dissolved we have
[2:02:15] another one waiting in
[2:02:17] as a matter of fact it says in christ he
[2:02:19] says you
[2:02:20] are you're not gonna die the second
[2:02:22] death that in christ you already
[2:02:24] resurrected
[2:02:25] your death is already in christ now he
[2:02:27] doesn't even stop there
[2:02:29] now he's telling you he saw you there
[2:02:32] oh my he saw the people that believed
[2:02:35] this word
[2:02:36] already there i'm telling you brother we
[2:02:39] are on the right track
[2:02:40] don't let anybody they can talk about
[2:02:43] the cloud they can talk about the breeds
[2:02:45] they can talk about all they want
[2:02:47] i know for a fact that this will get us
[2:02:49] over there
[2:02:50] amen
[2:02:54] god bless you let's stand this morning
[2:03:00] he says in question and answer he says
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:03] many of you women i said this last time
[2:03:07] he says he doesn't know
[2:03:11] when you are going to cut a piece of
[2:03:13] good you lay a good
[2:03:14] you you lay the goods
[2:03:18] out there and lay a pattern on the top
[2:03:21] of it on
[2:03:21] on this like this and you cut out goods
[2:03:25] just according to the pattern is that
[2:03:27] right
[2:03:29] it says the rest of the good is just the
[2:03:31] same as the goods
[2:03:33] but it's just a pattern it's just what
[2:03:36] god chose
[2:03:38] it says is that right but this is like
[2:03:40] the kind
[2:03:41] this is the kind that you take you might
[2:03:44] lay
[2:03:44] the other way far away to use but
[2:03:48] the goods is just cut off he says now
[2:03:52] who placed the pattern
[2:03:55] god by election
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:00] who placed the pattern
[2:04:04] wouldn't come here and say stood up at
[2:04:06] the door said
[2:04:07] you are elected you come in you come in
[2:04:10] who got
[2:04:10] everybody here phone number and invited
[2:04:13] them to church this morning
[2:04:16] who put people from all the all over the
[2:04:19] world and brought them

[2:04:22] whatever country we're from
[2:04:24] and put us here this morning and say
[2:04:26] we're going to have church this morning
[2:04:28] who put the pattern this is not
[2:04:32] man's doing this is not what david's
[2:04:35] doing
[2:04:36] this is god's doing and we have to be
[2:04:39] able to see the pattern
[2:04:40] when you see the pattern you understand
[2:04:42] god is behind it
[2:04:44] if you fail to see the pattern what
[2:04:46] guess what you get caught up in people
[2:04:48] oh i don't like the way that one does
[2:04:50] this i don't like the way this does i
[2:04:52] don't why because all you caught up in
[2:04:54] is man
[2:04:55] but if you see the pattern if you can
[2:04:57] think hard and see the pattern
[2:04:59] there's peace within your heart to know
[2:05:01] that i don't believe a man can do this
[2:05:04] whatever the mistake is whatever the
[2:05:06] problem is that god who put the pattern
[2:05:08] that god can come and solve the problem
[2:05:12] whatever the sickness whatever the issue
[2:05:14] is he laid the pattern for me to believe
[2:05:16] this word
[2:05:17] he he predestinated for us to be sitting
[2:05:19] here this morning
[2:05:20] and the god who did that he's able to
[2:05:22] come this morning
[2:05:24] and give us each one the heart desire
[2:05:26] that we have
[2:05:27] and i believe our heart desire is for
