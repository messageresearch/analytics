[19:13] but they reached out to me asking me
[19:14] about content
[19:16] contact information for church and i
[19:19] really thought about this song how
[19:21] we have children and brothers and
[19:24] sisters but the blood of christ
[19:26] really it's a defense that not
[19:29] the devil can't even cross so i hope

[24:46] [Music]
[24:53] oh my god

[25:14] [Applause]
[25:17] [Music]
[25:26] is
[25:29] [Music]
[25:50] you can't mix the broadline either amen
[25:53] if you're if you're his okay man
[25:57] the old devil can't mix with it if you
[26:00] have your bibles we're just going to
[26:03] read a continuation
[26:07] romans and uh and it
[26:10] it ties back to what we've talked about
[26:13] this morning as we listen to our
[26:15] messenger and we're gonna just let's
[26:17] just go uh listen to i think
[26:20] 19 more minutes or so and uh
[26:23] go right into communion so we won't uh
[26:26] really preach tonight but we will feast
[26:30] amen so let's read in the
[26:33] eighth chapter and this has kind of been
[26:36] the theme
[26:37] throughout our easter seal
[26:40] it says but if the spirit
[26:44] of him that raised up
[26:47] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[26:50] he that raised up christ from the dead
[26:53] shall also
[26:54] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[26:58] that dwells in you so now let's just
[27:00] read this next little part
[27:02] in the context of everything that we've
[27:04] been talking about
[27:06] there for brethren we are not
[27:09] deaders not to the flesh
[27:13] to live after the flesh so we have no
[27:16] debt
[27:17] to the flesh everything
[27:20] in the flesh has been taken care of we
[27:22] have no obligations
[27:25] to the flesh our obligations are to the
[27:28] word then listen to how beautiful
[27:30] this is for if you live
[27:34] after the flesh ye shall die
[27:38] but if he through the spirit
[27:42] do mortify the deeds of the body
[27:46] ye shall live now this is a great
[27:49] scripture in the context
[27:51] for as many as are led
[27:55] by the spirit of god
[27:58] they are the sons
[28:02] of god father we ask you to bless your
[28:04] word to us
[28:05] in your precious name we pray amen you
[28:08] may be seated
[28:10] um so this morning we just listened to
[28:14] about how the prophet uh
[28:17] told us that we had to be free from our
[28:20] fear
[28:20] and and in order to go forward and then
[28:23] we talked a little bit about
[28:25] the real eagle goes up and he he
[28:28] soars into the heavenly and gets that
[28:30] food
[28:31] up right for himself that he can
[28:35] just feast on that manna and
[28:38] then we talk a little bit about the
[28:41] atmosphere and as we talked about things
[28:44] about leadership and that's what happens
[28:46] when you soar into that man and you get
[28:48] that food you get the leadership
[28:50] of the holy spirit and it says that's
[28:53] the sons and daughters of god
[28:55] so we certainly marked out as
[28:59] he was pointing out to the people here
[29:02] was the
[29:02] very lord himself
[29:06] standing in their midst veiled in the
[29:08] ministry of a prophet
[29:10] doing signs and wonders and the spirits
[29:14] beckoning them
[29:16] to come and yet they choose to hold on
[29:19] to their traditions
[29:20] you know it's it's kind of heartbreaking
[29:23] in
[29:24] one spot but i think as you listen to
[29:26] this next little portion
[29:28] it'll bless you because now he starts
[29:30] going over
[29:32] and talking about the riches and the
[29:34] understanding the believer gets
[29:37] about the rapture and the resurrection
[29:40] and life and uh and how that
[29:44] i i just love in here how he talks that
[29:47] don't worry
[29:48] that quickening power is still with you
[29:50] when you die
[29:51] it doesn't hide it so let's just listen
[29:54] to these few minutes
[29:55] and enjoy it and we'll go right into
[29:57] communion god bless you tonight
[30:16] tablets are our phones are some sort of
[30:19] electronic device
[30:21] i don't know i wonder what the gospel
[30:24] day
[30:24] jesus was here on earth
[30:28] huh can you imagine the gnashing and
[30:30] wailing of teeth
[30:31] that would be going on with him doing
[30:34] the great
[30:36] you know brother braham came right at
[30:37] the perfect time didn't he
[30:40] god planting just perfect before the
[30:42] world would have totally rejected them
[30:44] god bless you now let's take some people
[30:48] again
[30:49] let's take some of the old testament
[30:51] prophets see what they did
[30:53] let's look first at stevens how
[30:55] stephen's in the midst of that
[30:56] sanhedrin council when that council
[30:59] brought him up there that great
[31:01] assembly of believers they're supposed
[31:02] to be believers brought him up and tried
[31:04] to condemn him
[31:05] why he said you stiff necks
[31:07] uncircumcising heart and ears
[31:09] you always resist the holy ghost that's
[31:12] that eternal life
[31:13] is your father's getting back in here
[31:15] through the prophets so are you doing it
[31:17] today
[31:18] and they matched up on him with their
[31:19] teeth they didn't want to hear that he
[31:20] is against their creed is against their
[31:22] denomination
[31:23] and they stoned the man to death and he
[31:25] raised his hands up in the torch heaven
[31:26] said i see heavens open
[31:28] and jesus stands in right side why he
[31:31] had the resurrection quickening power in
[31:34] him
[31:34] that took him into the bosoms of jesus
[31:37] notice quickly now look at philip down
[31:40] there in the great revival
[31:42] having a revival would have been
[31:44] embarrassing for any man while we had a
[31:46] god of big cooperation amongst the
[31:48] churches
[31:48] and everything down there is having a
[31:50] great revival and the quickening power
[31:52] of god spoke to him
[31:53] stevens may have said this you're having
[31:56] a great revival
[31:58] but i got one man i want you to talk to
[32:01] and steven's obedient no matter what it
[32:03] is how much criticism
[32:05] oh stevens you can't leave but i can god
[32:08] said so
[32:09] and he went out into the desert and out
[32:11] there he found this eunuch
[32:12] and what happened he said has uh
[32:15] if thou believers are the all thine
[32:17] heart that jesus is the son of god
[32:19] uh i'll baptize him when he baptized him
[32:21] look he was quickened
[32:23] by this quickening power to leave a
[32:25] revival
[32:26] of thousands of people to go out into
[32:29] the desert to one man
[32:31] oh that'd be against all reasons
[32:35] see why these ten thousand want you here
[32:38] but there's one wanting out there see
[32:41] and the quickening power
[32:43] sent him to god's provided place
[32:46] hallelujah men and women it'll make you
[32:48] stand to your feet
[32:49] it'll make you do the things that god
[32:51] wants you to do
[32:52] i don't care what somebody else says
[32:54] about the neighbors say well that
[32:55] person's lost their mind pray all night
[32:57] they read the bible i don't care what
[32:58] they say
[32:59] it's what god called you to do yeah
[33:01] that's right
[33:02] oh they say we can't have these
[33:03] old-fashioned pentecostal revivals like
[33:05] oh yes we can do
[33:07] you can have it in yourself and you are
[33:09] the majority in god
[33:11] no matter what the rest of them think
[33:12] notice after in obedience
[33:15] listen close now after obeying god to
[33:18] his word
[33:19] when he fulfilled his mission that
[33:21] quickening power that he received at
[33:23] pentecost
[33:24] caught him away quicken his body
[33:27] miles and miles away he was taken in the
[33:30] spirit
[33:31] and was found over in another country
[33:33] somewhere quickening power of god
[33:36] and if we be pentecostals that same
[33:39] power
[33:40] that raised up jesus from the dead if it
[33:43] dwells in your mortal bodies
[33:45] amen all right notice let's take another
[33:47] man with this quickly power
[33:49] there was a man way long ago by the
[33:52] name of enoch when a new thing come
[33:55] along with some come along and say
[33:57] well now we have to go back to the old
[33:58] school or this side of the other enoch
[34:01] walked with god amen whatever god said
[34:04] do
[34:04] he not never missed one word he walked
[34:08] with god
[34:08] what was he he was the son of god he was
[34:11] an eagle
[34:12] it had been called to that day and when
[34:15] come time he was so full of that
[34:17] quickening power remember he'd walk 500
[34:19] years or more
[34:20] before god and not one time had he
[34:22] missed his word
[34:24] not one time did he misbehave himself
[34:27] not one time did he do but kept the
[34:29] testimony everything that god told him
[34:32] to do he went and done it
[34:33] no argument about it he just wasn't done
[34:35] no matter what anybody else thought he
[34:36] wouldn't done it
[34:37] why he was full of that quickening power
[34:40] and when it come time for the old man to
[34:41] die
[34:42] god just sent out a letter and he walked
[34:43] up home he quickened him and took
[34:46] his mortal body up in a rapture
[34:50] amen that's that quickly power
[34:54] look at elijah after his work was
[34:56] finished on earth
[34:58] he was so full of that quickening power
[34:59] he'd condemn them
[35:01] jackie kennedy haircuts in his day he
[35:04] told old jesse about what he thought of
[35:06] her he told them preachers and priests
[35:08] what
[35:08] was right and wrong and they didn't
[35:10] believe him but he condemned them
[35:11] painted face women and things so bad and
[35:14] he's so full of that quickness power to
[35:15] nothing could harm him
[35:17] amen god had fed him in the heavens took
[35:19] him out and set him aside
[35:20] and he was so full of quickening power
[35:22] come time to die jordan opened up and he
[35:24] just walked
[35:25] sit down a chair and took him home so
[35:28] full of that quickening power
[35:29] he become a true genuine son of god
[35:34] notice he had a successor
[35:37] and his name was elisha and elisha had a
[35:41] double post in this quicken power
[35:43] see he had a double potion of it now he
[35:46] preached for about 80 years or
[35:48] he's not 80 years old he took sick and
[35:50] died
[35:51] now he didn't get to go home like elijah
[35:53] did see both of us represent there in
[35:55] the church
[35:56] some saints go in some resting but
[35:59] notice
[36:00] when elijah was taken up in the rapture
[36:03] then elisha went to sleep
[36:07] and god full of quitting power look at
[36:09] his prophecy just before he died
[36:12] see now let me show you i don't care if
[36:15] you're dead or where you're at
[36:17] that quickly power never leaves amen
[36:21] years and years after his death
[36:25] his meter rotted away the skin worms
[36:28] that eat it up
[36:30] but they were packing the dead man one
[36:31] day 30 men on that bones and there was
[36:34] so much quickening power there until a
[36:35] man come back to life again
[36:37] [Music]
[36:38] hallelujah raised him

[41:58] daddy i never seen a man so full of the
[42:00] power of my daddy
[42:01] but he died brother branham sure that
[42:03] didn't stop the quickening power
[42:05] moses had that quickly power you believe
[42:08] that
[42:08] there never was a man like him on the
[42:10] earth until jesus
[42:12] for he didn't only see visions he talked
[42:13] face to face with god
[42:16] even a prophetess maryam disputed his
[42:18] word one day
[42:19] he said don't you fear god consider my
[42:22] servant moses not nobody in the world
[42:24] like him this hour
[42:25] there's never been anybody like moses i
[42:28] speak to moses what did he ever say it
[42:29] wasn't truth
[42:30] see i speak to moses don't you fear god
[42:33] don't you say a word against him
[42:35] and right then she was stricken with
[42:36] leprosy and it was dying she didn't live
[42:38] very long afterwards
[42:39] moses prayed for and moses climbed up on
[42:42] the mountain at 120 years
[42:45] of ministry or 80 years of ministry 120
[42:48] years of life
[42:49] climbed up on the mountains and died and
[42:51] was buried in the valley
[42:54] but that quickening power was on him
[42:56] about 800 years later
[42:58] here you stand on my transfiguration
[43:02] amen why was he he was included in that
[43:05] resurrection
[43:06] sure he was he had the quickening power
[43:08] of god here was standing
[43:10] lookie job abraham isaac the saints
[43:14] on the day of the resurrection that
[43:16] great morning that job and all of them
[43:19] knew that would come when he said i know
[43:20] my redeemer liveth
[43:22] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[43:24] christ
[43:27] it's actually the book of job was wrote
[43:29] before genesis it claimed
[43:31] and the oldest book in the bible and in
[43:33] his trials and
[43:34] like we go through now and his wife even
[43:37] the closest thing to him on earth so
[43:39] won't you
[43:39] curse god and die to death he said thou
[43:41] speak us like a foolish woman
[43:43] the lord gave the lord taken away
[43:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[43:48] and then when the spirit of god come
[43:49] upon him and he began to prophesy said i
[43:52] know
[43:52] my redeemer liveth and the last days
[43:55] he'll stand upon this earth though the
[43:56] skin worms destroys this body
[43:58] yet my flesh shall i see god and he made
[44:00] a place to bury himself
[44:02] he said if i buy this ground he's bought
[44:04] there and buried himself
[44:06] later on come a man named abraham the
[44:09] church growing coming on
[44:10] up abraham well now he had the
[44:13] potentials of god too
[44:14] everlasting life eternal because god
[44:17] called him
[44:18] i noticed when he died or sarah died he
[44:21] bought a piece of ground in palestine
[44:23] near job's grave and buried sarah
[44:25] abraham died and also was buried with
[44:29] sarah
[44:29] abraham begot a god isaac
[44:33] and isaac when he died he slept with
[44:36] abraham in the same portion of ground

[45:27] being a prophet also laid his hands upon
[45:29] his crippled daddy

[45:31] behind the kingdom of jacob how not bury
[45:33] you here they talking about bearing him
[45:34] up in that land
[45:35] why why when joseph died he said don't
[45:39] you bury me down here

[45:46] everywhere but he has a plan

[45:54] reveal we'll visit you
[45:56] and we'll take you out of this land and
[45:57] when you go you take my bones

[46:11] mortal bodies

[46:19] but those are the promise when jesus
[46:22] come
[46:23] here i've got a scripture here matthew
[46:25] 27 51
[46:26] when jesus raised from the dead job seen
[46:29] that coming said i know my redeemer
[46:31] liveth
[46:32] the last days he'll stand upon this
[46:34] earth though the skin worms has
[46:35] destroyed this body yet my flesh shall
[46:36] see god
[46:38] i'll see him they know that was a
[46:40] prophet
[46:42] abraham was a prophet isaac was a
[46:44] prophet
[46:45] jacob was a prophet joseph was a prophet
[46:49] and they had the revelation of god
[46:51] according to his word
[46:52] amen on that easter morning
[46:56] when that one came and redeemed all
[46:58] those who believed on him
[47:00] they raised two according to the bible
[47:02] that quickening power come into the
[47:04] grave of job
[47:05] where there wasn't even a spoonful of
[47:07] the dust of his bones left
[47:09] after almost hundreds and hundreds and
[47:11] hundreds of years
[47:12] his bones had decayed it went back and
[47:15] turned back to the gases of the earth
[47:18] just a mere ash dust lay there
[47:22] but yet when that's quickening power
[47:23] according to the word of god to the
[47:25] promise
[47:26] hundreds and hundreds yes thousands of
[47:28] years later
[47:29] when that quickly power was brought
[47:31] forth in the grave job
[47:33] abraham isaac jacob hollam come out
[47:36] of the grave with him the bible said so
[47:40] saint matthew 27 chapter 15 first verse
[47:42] it said many of the saints that slept in
[47:44] the dusty earth
[47:46] resurrected it come out of the graves
[47:48] with him when he come up on easter
[47:49] morning
[47:50] why they had that potential they had
[47:53] that quickening power
[47:55] see and raised up from the dead and went
[47:58] with him in the resurrection enjoyed
[48:02] the resurrection with him because they
[48:04] were full
[48:05] of that quickening power they had that
[48:07] genuine easter seal
[48:09] where they say i would shall lay back
[48:10] the old testament wait a minute in first

[48:15] 16th verse

[48:22] ignored brethren concerning those
[48:24] that sleep that you sorrow not even as
[48:26] others which have no hope for if we
[48:28] believe that jesus died and rose again
[48:30] the third day

[48:39] quickening power shall resurrect also
[48:41] at his second coming just as sure as the

[49:00] everyone that's in christ jesus will
[49:02] also
[49:02] come with him in his resurrection the
[49:04] quickening power
[49:06] of god upon the bones no wonder
