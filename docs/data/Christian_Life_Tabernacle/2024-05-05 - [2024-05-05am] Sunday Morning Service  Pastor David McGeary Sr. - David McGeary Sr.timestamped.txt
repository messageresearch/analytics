[40:45] grass that's up to your parents if you
[40:49] want grass stains uh your kids are
[40:52] welcome to go out and get grass stains
[40:54] it's probably wet today because of the
[40:56] rain but uh we'll have that open uh this
[41:00] is open over here uh I call it uh the
[41:04] youth youth development
[41:07] center and uh someone said why are you
[41:09] calling it the youth what happened to
[41:11] Sunday school I said you don't want to
[41:13] use the word school with the city
[41:17] because schools have a whole different
[41:21] set of rules you know what you have to
[41:24] have and what you got to do and all this
[41:26] stuff so
[41:27] uh we're just a Youth Development Center
[41:30] so uh anyway we we hope in the next
[41:34] couple months to be all totally finished
[41:36] up and when we get everything finished
[41:39] up then we'll try to set our eyes on a
[41:42] dedication service you love the Lord
[41:45] this morning well if you think you love
[41:48] him he loves you
[41:50] more amen you can't even begin to
[41:54] measure the love that God has for you he
[41:58] he certainly loves you let's read these
[42:00] scriptures
[42:02] um
[42:04] and it says if ye abide in
[42:08] me and my words abide in
[42:14] you ye shall ask what ye will and it
[42:18] shall be done unto you herein is my
[42:22] father
[42:23] glorified that ye bear much fruit
[42:28] so shall ye be my disciples so we always
[42:32] talk a lot about glorifying God in
[42:35] praising God but he's not glorified by
[42:38] your beautiful
[42:40] voices you know the Mormon Tabernacle
[42:43] Choir would have us all be or the
[42:45] Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir but it's that
[42:49] you're fruitful that's what glorifies
[42:52] the father that you bear much
[42:54] fruit um
[42:57] and so he says
[43:00] uh and and but if you bear much fruit he
[43:04] says so shall ye be my disciples as the
[43:07] father hath loved me so have I loved you
[43:12] continue ye in my
[43:15] love if you keep my Commandments you
[43:19] shall abide in my love even as I have
[43:25] kept my father's Commandments
[43:27] and abide in his
[43:30] love these things have I spoke unto you
[43:34] that my joy might remain in you and that
[43:39] your joy might be
[43:41] full this is my
[43:44] commandment that ye love one another as
[43:48] I have loved
[43:51] you greater love hath no
[43:54] man that a man lay down his life or his
[43:59] friend and ye are my friends if you do
[44:03] whatsoever I command you henceforth I
[44:07] call you not
[44:09] servants for the servant knoweth
[44:13] not what his Lord does but I have called
[44:18] you friends for all things that I have
[44:21] heard of my father I have made known
[44:25] unto you ye have not chosen me but I
[44:30] have chosen you and ordained you that ye
[44:35] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[44:39] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[44:43] ye shall ask of the father in my name he
[44:47] may give it to you Heavenly Father we
[44:51] ask you to bless your words in jesus'
[44:54] name we pray amen
[44:57] and you maybe
[45:04] SE all right okay um and then he
[45:09] finishes up these things I command you
[45:12] that you love one another and it uh
[45:16] that's a great statement that I have not
[45:19] uh you have not chosen me I've chosen
[45:22] you you know Christianity many times uh
[45:26] always takes the approach that you have
[45:29] to make the decision to serve God it's
[45:32] based on your decision uh a whole faith
[45:36] is based on that from the standpoint
[45:38] that you've got to recognize yourself a
[45:41] sinner and then when you recognize
[45:43] yourself as sinner you have to choose
[45:46] the Lord Jesus to come into your life
[45:50] and therefore uh you made the choice and
[45:55] that a choice is attrib
[45:57] you to righteousness and and that's a a
[46:02] a a good thing I mean that's a
[46:04] motivating factor but uh we know it goes
[46:07] beyond that uh we know that
[46:12] uh we didn't choose him he chose us and
[46:17] he foreordained us unto good works that
[46:21] we might be fruitful and so I had a
[46:24] little thought this morning and I'm I
[46:26] like I said I'm going to try to uh uh
[46:29] keep it uh simple and uh um uh not put
[46:37] too much effort into it if I can do that
[46:40] you know uh I I'm not supposed to work
[46:44] and so I told everybody I didn't work I
[46:46] I didn't lift anything I just told this
[46:49] person to do that and that person to do
[46:51] that and I pushed her broom a little bit
[46:54] but I I tried to be good but my eyes
[46:57] doing good the doctor said it's good I
[47:00] got 2020 Vision back in my eye uh but
[47:04] it's a little sore um he stuck like I
[47:08] told you he stuck three needles in my
[47:10] eye and uh he told me is when it heals
[47:14] it'll get better so I'm thankful for the
[47:18] hand of the Lord on the
[47:21] surgery
[47:23] so when I look at this scripture
[47:27] um it motivates
[47:30] me uh not only me
[47:33] personally but it motivates my heart
[47:37] towards you as
[47:40] Believers and as
[47:42] Believers uh we've got to realize that
[47:48] God is expecting Our Lives to be
[47:52] fruitful he's expecting there to be
[47:55] results
[47:57] uh he doesn't plant the
[48:00] seed not believing if I could use that
[48:05] term that that seed has a purpose and it
[48:09] has a
[48:10] fruit you wouldn't go plant a garden and
[48:13] someone come up to you and said oh I
[48:15] noticed you tilled the soil and you got
[48:17] the rocks out and you put a fence up to
[48:20] keep the rabbits and you planted a nice
[48:22] Garden uh what what what are you growing
[48:26] oh nothing I just planted a bunch of
[48:28] seed that's
[48:31] unfruitful you know I mean I don't
[48:33] expect I don't expect any of these seeds
[48:36] to
[48:36] work well that's not a whole lot of
[48:39] doesn't give you a lot of expectation
[48:42] you're not going to put much effort into
[48:44] that Garden are you going to be out
[48:46] there weeding it every day and tilling
[48:49] it every day watering it every day and
[48:52] and and just sit back and say you know
[48:54] uh uh I I I planted this garden and I
[48:57] did all this work but I have no
[49:00] expectations whatsoever for this
[49:03] Garden well lesle and I we moved from
[49:06] California as you know to
[49:08] Montana and U so we got in Montana so we
[49:12] thought we'd plant a
[49:14] garden so we got the ground and we dug
[49:17] it up and we worked it and we got all
[49:20] the seeds and everything and planted it
[49:22] and put all this effort in it and I I
[49:25] just remember the neighbor would come
[49:27] over and he'd look over the fence and
[49:29] and he'd just
[49:30] chuckle and we couldn't figure out what
[49:33] what he's chuckling about you know I
[49:35] mean we didn't see a lot of gardens
[49:37] around up there but you know we we were
[49:40] hippies you know we were moving to
[49:42] Montana and going to take the Wilderness
[49:45] and can some things and so so we we put
[49:49] a lot of effort in this garden and then
[49:52] when it come time to uh uh dig up our
[49:56] garden you know well we got some carrots
[50:00] but our carrots were like this
[50:03] big like they were like mini
[50:06] carrots and then we got radishes and
[50:09] they're about the size of a marble you
[50:12] know and our potatoes were about the
[50:14] size of a golf ball and we looked at
[50:17] this and said we worked all summer long
[50:19] and we didn't have enough vegetables and
[50:22] fruit for a salad you know what I mean
[50:25] and because the condition weren't right
[50:27] you know what I mean but we had a lot of
[50:30] expectation you you know what I'm saying
[50:33] and but when God plants a garden hallu
[50:36] amen he he's already has the vision of
[50:40] what it's going to
[50:41] be I I feel our problem is is we haven't
[50:45] joined his
[50:48] vision we haven't joined his vision and
[50:51] we've been speaking on the message
[50:53] called taking sides with Jesus
[50:56] and you know when you take sides with
[50:59] something it it's it goes beyond
[51:02] acknowledgment it goes beyond where you
[51:05] say I acknowledge this truth we're in uh
[51:09] in our country we're in election season
[51:12] and so they are trying to get people to
[51:16] cast their Vote or to take
[51:19] sides and so what they do is they they
[51:23] they speak out what they stand for uh
[51:26] this is what I'm going to do for you and
[51:28] this is what we're going to do and and
[51:31] this is our policy um you know we're
[51:35] going to clean up the air and and uh and
[51:39] so you can breathe or we're going to
[51:41] clean up the water so you can drink
[51:43] we're going to take care of you forever
[51:46] uh and and they'll give you all these
[51:48] promises the other candidate or whoever
[51:50] it might be might promise you I'm going
[51:53] to make your wages grow and and your
[51:56] you're going to be successful and and uh
[51:59] you're going to have this and that and
[52:01] you sit there all the time listening
[52:03] listening listening but there comes a
[52:05] time when you have to take a
[52:09] side okay and and Jesus said there's
[52:12] something about this age that's
[52:15] extremely important to us and and that
[52:19] you he says if you I if you're not hot
[52:22] or
[52:23] cold you know if you're lukewarm I'll
[52:27] spew thee out of my mouth and this is
[52:30] the age of being
[52:33] lukewarm okay it's it's subtly around us
[52:37] it's a age of being lukewarm it it's an
[52:40] age of people trying to thread the
[52:43] needle and and not offend this side or
[52:46] that side you know try to be correct and
[52:50] and it it makes for no
[52:53] decisions uh people are wanting to know
[52:55] I want to make make sure that I take the
[52:58] the the side with the winner or I want
[53:00] to take the right side uh they're being
[53:03] forced into choices and and uh and
[53:07] people are doing everything they can to
[53:11] force you to make a choice to force you
[53:15] to make a stand and because it's a time
[53:18] that you've got to take sides you can't
[53:21] remain lukewarm you you're either one or
[53:25] the other and
[53:27] it before the the lines used to be
[53:31] closer together so if you made one
[53:35] choice or the other you weren't so far
[53:37] apart but now they're trying to create
[53:39] the distance so that the it the choices
[53:43] are are are very far apart and that your
[53:48] choice will identify you and your choice
[53:52] will eventually produce the actions that
[53:56] you you have the things that you do are
[53:59] based on your choice and and we want to
[54:03] make our
[54:04] choice the word that's what our heart's
[54:08] desire is and that's what Jesus says but
[54:12] I think it goes beyond that when we
[54:14] realize that that he has we have not
[54:19] chosen him that he chose
[54:22] us and it's very difficult uh I think
[54:26] Paul is such a great example of that
[54:29] Paul's persecuting the church and that's
[54:31] not what God chose him to do and one day
[54:36] he meets the pillar of fire on out on
[54:41] his campaign and uh all of a sudden he
[54:44] smoked
[54:45] blind and God got his attention and if
[54:49] you're running from God God will get
[54:51] your attention amen if he's chosen you
[54:54] he will find you amen if if he wants
[54:59] you you can't you can't escape it that's
[55:03] right he will he will squeeze down on
[55:06] you until he stops you dead in your
[55:09] track and and and speaks to him at this
[55:14] morning I wanted just share with you
[55:16] because I think it's important for us
[55:19] and I made this little note of this uh
[55:23] sermon title I don't always title my
[55:25] sermon but and I I want to call this
[55:29] revelation of
[55:31] self revelation of self we have a lot of
[55:37] knowledge and a lot of Revelations of a
[55:40] lot of things but I wonder if we really
[55:43] have a revelation of
[55:46] ourself and you know to have a
[55:49] revelation is is to
[55:53] know Revelation is another word for
[55:57] faith I could I if I could also maybe
[56:00] say do we have faith in
[56:04] ourself now I know we're always taught
[56:07] oh you can't have faith in yourself you
[56:09] can't have faith in yourself but that
[56:12] was the church World telling us that so
[56:16] they could have control over you there
[56:20] should be nothing that has control over
[56:23] your life other than the quickening
[56:26] power power of the spirit of God
[56:29] revealing to you his word you shouldn't
[56:33] be you shouldn't be ruled by
[56:35] fear you shouldn't be ruled by doubt in
[56:40] fact your life should be ruled by love
[56:43] that should be the the ultimate uh
[56:48] reflection that he sees and it if you
[56:52] are full of complexes and you're full of
[56:55] doubt in yourself it's very difficult
[56:59] really to love
[57:02] somebody you know you there's you've got
[57:04] to have some form of
[57:08] confidence in yourself in order to
[57:12] really love somebody you've got to be
[57:15] sure sure of your own feelings you you
[57:19] wouldn't want to enter into a
[57:20] relationship doubting whether or not you
[57:23] love that
[57:25] person you couldn't go outside and come
[57:28] up with reasons uh for marriage uh well
[57:32] I need a place to stay and I need a job
[57:35] and he's a provider and and he works
[57:38] hard and I I don't really know if I love
[57:41] him but uh everybody else is uglier than
[57:44] he is so I I'm I'm going to I I I'll
[57:48] just settle on
[57:50] this well I mean how long do you think
[57:53] that
[57:54] lasts you know I mean you might make it
[57:58] through but you you'll have no joy
[58:00] you'll have no fruit you'll have you'll
[58:04] have no peace you'll in hard times they
[58:06] just become harder you know and you
[58:10] can't explain to somebody why you love
[58:12] somebody you know what I mean it's just
[58:15] something inside of you that you love
[58:16] them uh uh the prophet of God made that
[58:20] statement I use it many time in weddings
[58:23] it says when you love them and you don't
[58:25] know why you know it's not because of
[58:27] their looks it's not but that you love
[58:29] them and she loves you he says that came
[58:31] down from heaven that's Eternal and and
[58:35] that'll that'll go back to heaven and so
[58:40] there's certain things that you've got
[58:42] to be sure of in order to be successful
[58:46] you've got to you've got to be
[58:48] positively sure if and and uh we always
[58:53] try to get our young people to uh make
[58:56] sure that they they have the spirit of
[58:59] God that they're born again you know
[59:02] what I mean that their lives are cleaned
[59:05] up you know what I mean you don't want
[59:07] to marry somebody and have a secret life
[59:10] you know what I mean or or have
[59:13] alternative reasons you want to just get
[59:15] to the place I can be 100% honest with
[59:18] this person I love this person I want to
[59:21] be with this person when I wake up I
[59:23] think about him uh uh
[59:26] you know because if you get married
[59:28] you're going to wake up with that person
[59:31] me and let been waking up for 50 some
[59:34] years you know perfect
[59:37] marriage well I read that thing and it
[59:40] to me it felt like those two people were
[59:43] foreigners one to another you know what
[59:46] I mean they K says well you know the
[59:49] guys he's got these things that he does
[59:51] and she's got these things that she does
[59:54] and I thought all this book is is these
[59:57] are ways for two strangers to live
[1:00:02] together I I don't you know what I mean
[1:00:05] that's not what I'm looking for in
[1:00:08] life and I think sometimes we've
[1:00:12] estranged
[1:00:14] ourselves okay that we're to the very
[1:00:16] God that loves
[1:00:18] us come on because we're not confident
[1:00:23] in ourselves we don't have a self
[1:00:26] Revelation a revelation of self we know
[1:00:30] all that he is but I don't even know if
[1:00:33] sometimes we know who it is that he
[1:00:37] loves and so I want to just just read to
[1:00:40] you a little bit this morning and just
[1:00:42] spend uh just a few moments that we
[1:00:45] could come to a greater revelation of of
[1:00:50] who that we are or who that I am and
[1:00:53] what my place is and what my part is in
[1:00:57] things and and it it comes with the word
[1:01:01] of God and the best way that anybody can
[1:01:04] really ever be identified is by the word
[1:01:08] of God the word of God is the true
[1:01:11] identifier of all things it's what
[1:01:13] identifies every aspect of your life is
[1:01:17] measured by the word of God it's not
[1:01:20] measured by how much money you have I
[1:01:23] mean you could have all the money in the
[1:01:25] world but God comes to the poor of this
[1:01:27] world rich in faith because everything a
[1:01:30] dollar can accomplish a faith can
[1:01:33] accomplish it
[1:01:35] faster Faith can do for you anything a
[1:01:38] dollar can do for you faith can do for
[1:01:41] you anything a doctor can do for you
[1:01:44] faith can do all things with faith all
[1:01:47] things are possible I can do all things
[1:01:50] through Christ Jesus who strengthens me
[1:01:53] so if I could have that relationship I
[1:01:56] have all things but I need if I and I
[1:01:59] want to know that I have that
[1:02:02] relationship and I want to know it's not
[1:02:06] one-sided how many people could say well
[1:02:08] I love this person but I'm not sure
[1:02:11] whether they love me well that that
[1:02:14] becomes a real tiptoe
[1:02:18] situation but we want to be steadfast
[1:02:22] andure that he loves us and we love
[1:02:28] him I
[1:02:30] know and I I love this scripture so much
[1:02:34] it's always been uh something that
[1:02:37] really meant a whole lot to me it's that
[1:02:40] when the Lord's talking to Peter Peter
[1:02:43] does not love
[1:02:45] me and and it just
[1:02:49] strikes Peter and he asked him the
[1:02:53] second time Peter does that love me
[1:02:56] you know feed my sheep feed my lambs and
[1:03:00] finally Peter says
[1:03:02] Lord you know all
[1:03:07] things you
[1:03:09] know that I love
[1:03:13] you and they
[1:03:15] just he just ended the
[1:03:19] question he knew he loved
[1:03:22] him Peter knew he loved him
[1:03:27] and he could he could finally looked at
[1:03:28] and say you know that I love you you
[1:03:30] know all things you know that I love you
[1:03:34] wouldn't it be wonderful if you could
[1:03:36] answer back to yourself and you can say
[1:03:39] Lord I know I love you and I know you
[1:03:42] love me I know you love me I'm sure that
[1:03:47] you love
[1:03:49] me it it's settled yes it's settled
[1:03:54] within my heart
[1:03:56] yeah that you love me then you can start
[1:03:59] coming to the the the revelation of self
[1:04:04] I'm somebody that he
[1:04:07] loves I'm somebody that he
[1:04:11] chose he chose me I can just see see at
[1:04:15] the at the vow and the minister standing
[1:04:18] there and and and he says he says now
[1:04:22] that do you take this uh this uh man to
[1:04:25] be your lawfully wet husband he says
[1:04:27] well it wasn't my first
[1:04:31] choice but he already got
[1:04:34] married so um I I think this will
[1:04:39] do oh
[1:04:42] my my my my
[1:04:45] my you know that that would be uh pretty
[1:04:50] good about that time he'd reach in his
[1:04:52] pocket and say well I had two rings here
[1:04:55] one was a Big Stone if she really loved
[1:04:58] me and this is a teeny Stone just in
[1:05:01] case this thing's not going to last you
[1:05:03] can't go on like that you can't go on
[1:05:07] wondering whether something is going to
[1:05:09] last or
[1:05:11] not when you say those words I do that
[1:05:14] means I do till death of the part you
[1:05:19] understand for for better for worse
[1:05:21] they're thicker they thin you know for
[1:05:23] in and out it don't matter this is a
[1:05:26] settled thing I'm settled in my decision
[1:05:29] I'm settled in my choice I've accepted
[1:05:32] the fact that that this isn't a trial
[1:05:37] run you know okay I I believe with all
[1:05:41] my heart that that that he loves
[1:05:45] me and I I believe that he loves me and
[1:05:49] I believe that he knows that I love him
[1:05:54] because without that the there's nothing
[1:05:56] left but
[1:05:57] suspicion and then you misread every
[1:06:00] word you misread every action everything
[1:06:03] that's done it starts to get interpreted
[1:06:06] this way and interpreted that way
[1:06:08] confusion enters in and pretty soon
[1:06:11] words start spewing out of your mouth
[1:06:13] and it's one great big gigantic ugly
[1:06:19] mess but when but when it's settled it's
[1:06:23] settled
[1:06:26] amen you know you're going to get
[1:06:28] through it that's right you can say I'm
[1:06:31] sorry I didn't mean

[1:06:54] to be a confidence there there's got to
[1:06:57] be a union there there's got to be a a
[1:07:01] love there and Jesus that's what he
[1:07:03] prayed for he says father may they love

[1:10:31] this morning knowing beyond the shadow
[1:10:34] of a doubt I may be a mess but he loves
[1:10:38] me and I love him and I didn't choose
[1:10:43] him he chose
[1:10:46] me he had a reason that he chose
[1:10:49] me this is out of the message called
[1:10:52] taking sides with Jesus
[1:10:57] and he's talking here he said and this
[1:11:01] is in paragraph
[1:11:03] 24 of taking sides uh with Jesus he said
[1:11:08] when old Nathan walked up there maybe
[1:11:11] before Phillip said he said now I don't
[1:11:14] know about this Phillip I've seen a lot
[1:11:18] of things rise up in these last days I
[1:11:22] know there's a lot of things going on
[1:11:26] so here comes Philip up and they're
[1:11:28] talking he says man are you sure this is
[1:11:30] just one more of them
[1:11:32] things right he
[1:11:35] says but he walked up before him and
[1:11:38] said I'll go listen to him and see
[1:11:42] what's got to
[1:11:44] say walked up there and Jesus said
[1:11:47] behold an Israelite in whom there's no
[1:11:50] guile and he said Rabbi when did you
[1:11:53] know me he he said before Philip called
[1:11:56] you when you was under the tree I saw
[1:12:01] you what did
[1:12:05] it he said the water struck that
[1:12:10] predestinated seed oh my when it did he
[1:12:16] said Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God
[1:12:20] you're the king of
[1:12:22] Israel what was it the seed was laying
[1:12:27] there
[1:12:29] already now this morning I I I want you
[1:12:32] to realize I'm talking about you and a
[1:12:39] self-revelation I want you to be able to
[1:12:41] say the seed was laying there
[1:12:47] already God seed it back Yonder before
[1:12:52] the foundation of the world that it
[1:12:55] should bring forth the light right at
[1:13:00] that time
[1:13:03] hallelujah oh I like
[1:13:07] that that's my
[1:13:10] stand right there
[1:13:13] brother that's where I believe right
[1:13:17] there I preach it and it falls here and
[1:13:22] there and they go this way in that way
[1:13:26] don't make any difference
[1:13:29] somewhere it's going to strike a
[1:13:33] seed and when it did that's brother Bram
[1:13:36] staps his finger it'll fly right up to
[1:13:39] life like that just as sure as the world
[1:13:44] yes
[1:13:45] sir like that blind boy said this was
[1:13:50] done that the works of God might be
[1:13:53] manifest see see he knowed what was
[1:13:57] going to take place sure he did all
[1:14:01] right now the
[1:14:04] predestinated when they see his
[1:14:06] scriptural signs know that the word
[1:14:11] Vindicated The Works that the works
[1:14:13] Vindicated the
[1:14:15] word that the word was right they were
[1:14:20] predestinated to see it and they were
[1:14:24] right in line to see it and they got
[1:14:29] it
[1:14:31] now as I read this batch of
[1:14:37] quotes I hope your confidence goes out
[1:14:41] and says that's
[1:14:44] me remember the little boy in the
[1:14:46] country in the mirror when he went into
[1:14:50] from the country into to see his aunt or
[1:14:52] someone in the city and he walked walked
[1:14:55] down the hall and he saw a little
[1:14:58] boy and he walked up closer to the boy
[1:15:01] and the boy was there and and he' never
[1:15:04] seen A Mir he raised his hand the boy
[1:15:07] raised his hand he put his leg out the
[1:15:10] boy put his leg out and as he was
[1:15:13] looking into this mirror he saw that
[1:15:16] what he was doing
[1:15:18] everything was exactly right in tune and
[1:15:22] so finally he made the statement he says
[1:15:25] look Mommy it's
[1:15:27] me well when we look this morning into
[1:15:30] the Yum Thunder of God's word what is
[1:15:33] the word of God the word of God is the
[1:15:35] mirror of the
[1:15:36] believer that's right they look into the
[1:15:39] they look into the mirror and they
[1:15:41] should be able to see themselves they
[1:15:44] should be able to look into that mirror
[1:15:46] and say look that's
[1:15:49] me and when you read this oh when the
[1:15:52] word is struck
[1:15:55] struck something in me and something in
[1:15:57] me came in me and flew up to life I want
[1:15:59] to have a revelation of myself and say
[1:16:02] that's me that's me I that's me you're
[1:16:06] talking about me this is I see
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:10] myself I have a revelation of who I am
[1:16:15] it's not a standalone fact I mean it's
[1:16:19] not the fact of predestination that God
[1:16:22] predestines it's not the theory of
[1:16:26] predestination that God plans
[1:16:29] things no that's not the kind of God I
[1:16:32] serve I serve a God that makes his word
[1:16:36] come to pass in
[1:16:40] flesh that's me that's right that's the
[1:16:44] revelation of
[1:16:46] myself that's my self-revelation who's
[1:16:49] he talking
[1:16:53] about this is me
[1:16:56] he's talking about me yes
[1:16:59] sir I saw the works I heard the word
[1:17:04] something came alive in me but if you
[1:17:07] don't have confidence in
[1:17:09] that then you become a double-minded
[1:17:12] person and a double-minded person is
[1:17:15] unstable than all their
[1:17:18] ways you can't you can't you got to make
[1:17:22] a stand
[1:17:25] that's
[1:17:26] right what the devil says you are on or
[1:17:31] what God says you
[1:17:37] are this is what he
[1:17:40] said so I want to be able to read that
[1:17:43] and not say well this is Brother Ram's
[1:17:46] teaching or this is the
[1:17:49] message we're all
[1:17:52] elected I don't matter if you're you're
[1:17:54] all
[1:17:55] elected right good for
[1:17:58] you but your election is not going to do
[1:18:01] anything for
[1:18:05] me the only thing that said do anything
[1:18:08] for me is when I know he's talking about
[1:18:11] me then I can walk up there and say
[1:18:14] that's
[1:18:20] mine it's not a
[1:18:22] question that belongs to me
[1:18:26] amen that is the
[1:18:29] revelation of
[1:18:31] self this is the revelation of self this
[1:18:35] is the revelation of me I am a
[1:18:40] predestinated
[1:18:42] seed not a question I have a revelation
[1:18:46] of
[1:18:47] myself because until that's
[1:18:51] established every promise that you come
[1:18:54] to you try to measure your worth before
[1:18:57] you take possession but when you know
[1:19:00] it's your
[1:19:05] inheritance and you know it come comes
[1:19:08] to
[1:19:09] you
[1:19:13] then you
[1:19:15] know you can receive
[1:19:18] it that's why I love the story of the
[1:19:21] prodal
[1:19:22] son the one son
[1:19:26] we know the story he decides he wants to
[1:19:29] go out and see the world he takes
[1:19:30] everything he
[1:19:33] has and he takes it he squanders it he
[1:19:37] lives great he's got a lot of friends
[1:19:40] well he's got
[1:19:42] money but the minute he became a burden
[1:19:46] nobody wanted to pull him along no
[1:19:49] friends you know nobody there to move
[1:19:52] you no one to help you can you imagine
[1:19:54] when he had to move out of one place to
[1:19:56] another you know starting his slides
[1:19:58] starting to stuff pretty soon nobody was
[1:20:00] showing up to move
[1:20:01] him nobody wanted jobs he didn't have
[1:20:05] nothing to
[1:20:08] offer you know F finally slopping
[1:20:12] pigs you know now he's eating what the
[1:20:14] pigs eat so he's out there fighting with
[1:20:17] the pig you know Pig's got the corn husk
[1:20:19] in one mouth and he's got his mouth on
[1:20:21] the other end and they're fighting
[1:20:25] so finally he recognizes something I
[1:20:29] have a
[1:20:33] father I'm his son now I'm not worthy to
[1:20:36] be that son but I'm still that son I'm
[1:20:38] going to go back and ask him if he'll
[1:20:42] forgive
[1:20:44] me and let me be a servant in his house
[1:20:48] I'm willing to humble myself to that of
[1:20:52] course when he got back
[1:20:56] he had a feast waiting for him the
[1:20:59] father been praying for him and looking
[1:21:01] for his return because that's his
[1:21:05] son you think the father cared about
[1:21:08] what inheritance he gave him the father
[1:21:11] made that inheritance 10 times over
[1:21:14] since that boy had been
[1:21:16] gone he could start his inheritance
[1:21:19] fresh from that
[1:21:20] day he had cattle he had everything
[1:21:26] and and he the other son finally comes
[1:21:29] up and says Oh
[1:21:31] Daddy you know I've been faithful to you
[1:21:35] I've
[1:21:36] been good and you've never done this he
[1:21:41] said Son
[1:21:43] Rejoice your brother which was lost is
[1:21:46] returned and then he looks at and he
[1:21:48] says you know all things that are mine
[1:21:53] are yours that's
[1:21:56] right he
[1:21:58] lacked the
[1:22:00] revelation of
[1:22:03] his he lacked the revelation of his
[1:22:06] position and because he lacked that
[1:22:10] Revelation he felt
[1:22:12] threatened by his
[1:22:15] brother let me tell you once you're born
[1:22:18] again and you know that the Seal of
[1:22:21] God's in your heart you don't afraid of
[1:22:23] anybody
[1:22:26] huah their Doctrine can't take it away
[1:22:29] from you Their Fear techniques can't
[1:22:31] take it away from you their criticism
[1:22:34] can't take it away from you you know
[1:22:36] you're born of the spirit of God you
[1:22:39] know the father loves you you know you
[1:22:41] didn't choose him he chose you it's
[1:22:44] settled a long time
[1:22:47] ago our Prophet told us we don't want to
[1:22:50] get to the river and not have the token
[1:22:57] and that's what he said he said you've
[1:22:59] always been with me you've always had
[1:23:02] everything I have is yours but he never
[1:23:05] got the revelation of
[1:23:10] self he never understood his
[1:23:14] security he never understood his
[1:23:17] position in the
[1:23:22] family jealousy rise up criticisms rise
[1:23:27] up all those things are all a
[1:23:30] result when a person doesn't have
[1:23:33] self
[1:23:45] Revelation they he said now when the
[1:23:48] predestinate when they see his
[1:23:50] scriptural sign knowing that the works
[1:23:54] been indicate the word that the word was
[1:23:57] right they were predestinated to see it
[1:24:02] and they were right in line to see it
[1:24:05] and they got it because the people was
[1:24:09] predestinated to eternal
[1:24:12] life they was going to find it that's
[1:24:15] all all the father hath given me will
[1:24:19] come to me and all that comes to me I
[1:24:23] will give eternal life and raise him up
[1:24:27] at the last days there will not be one
[1:24:31] of them
[1:24:32] lost amen I'm holding right to
[1:24:40] that what are you holding
[1:24:42] to I didn't choose him he chose me when
[1:24:48] he got that hippie off the roof I knew I
[1:24:51] didn't choose God I didn't want anything
[1:24:53] to do with God
[1:24:55] God but God wanted to do something with
[1:25:01] me not by
[1:25:04] works not by Deeds not by power not by
[1:25:09] might but by my spirit saith
[1:25:13] God not what I done what I am or what I
[1:25:19] will be but what he is
[1:25:24] and I am in him and whatever he is I'm a
[1:25:31] part of him
[1:25:35] amen I'm saved because I'm a part of him
[1:25:39] he is God and I'm a part of him being
[1:25:45] his son that's right so ain't what I
[1:25:51] done what I will do it's what he's done
[1:25:57] that's my trust right there all
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:03] right it settles
[1:26:06] it now when you hear that don't I I hope
[1:26:10] I I can make myself clear it's not
[1:26:12] sitting back and saying that's a
[1:26:17] Doctrine it's not a
[1:26:19] Doctrine it's a description of a people
[1:26:24] yes it's a description of an
[1:26:27] offspring it's a description of a family
[1:26:31] it's a genial tree of God the extended
[1:26:36] down into this
[1:26:40] age you know those trees they
[1:26:44] make put my name in
[1:26:48] there you
[1:26:52] know David be got such a and such begot
[1:26:55] Son by son begot David McGary go read
[1:26:58] your Bible it's right in there you all
[1:27:01] skip over that part don't you you don't
[1:27:03] sit there and read all those names but
[1:27:06] if you read all those names you'll find
[1:27:07] I'm in there amen sure I
[1:27:11] am I'm a part of every single one of
[1:27:17] them so we're talking about getting a
[1:27:20] revelation of self
[1:27:24] how important is that if I could read a
[1:27:29] a few places to
[1:27:31] you and this is out of perfect
[1:27:36] Faith how how many wants to advance into
[1:27:40] rapturing
[1:27:42] condition don't you feel the squeeze yes
[1:27:47] don't you feel the
[1:27:50] chaos don't you feel the people are
[1:27:53] losing their mind
[1:27:57] you don't know what to
[1:27:59] think you don't know what's going to
[1:28:02] happen can you imagine they want to run
[1:28:06] our whole country on
[1:28:08] batteries how many of you have had
[1:28:10] success with
[1:28:12] batteries all mine turn ugly and gray
[1:28:15] and they sit in the closet and every
[1:28:17] time I need one I can't find
[1:28:22] it so I think I need batteries so I go
[1:28:25] to the store and I buy batteries and
[1:28:27] when I get home I think well where do I
[1:28:28] keep the batteries and I look for my
[1:28:30] battery and there's a whole bunch of
[1:28:31] batteries anybody need any batteries
[1:28:34] call
[1:28:35] lesle I'm not going to live on
[1:28:39] batteries well we don't even live on
[1:28:42] bread
[1:28:43] alone we live on every word that
[1:28:46] proceeds out of the mouth of God if you
[1:28:49] are not feeding
[1:28:52] yourself right come
[1:28:56] on you've got to feed yourself you've
[1:28:59] got to have a revelation of self you got
[1:29:02] to know who it is that you're feeding
[1:29:05] what it is that you're eating I can't
[1:29:07] just read what I read if if if I don't
[1:29:10] feel it's for me then I'm reading a menu
[1:29:14] but that's not what John said he said
[1:29:15] take the book and eat
[1:29:17] it that's right I'm going to eat that
[1:29:22] I'm going to take side with it I'm going
[1:29:25] to say if he said it he's talking about
[1:29:29] me and I'm going to act
[1:29:35] accordingly cuz he said oh if you love
[1:29:37] me you keep my Commandments and other
[1:29:40] words my Commandments are the things
[1:29:41] that I speak if I tell you you're
[1:29:44] predestinated and you love me you
[1:29:47] believe me and you stand up and you say
[1:29:50] I'm
[1:29:51] predestinated that's right
[1:29:55] and somebody says show me well let's go
[1:29:57] down to the bar and have a few
[1:30:00] beers don't
[1:30:02] matter your actions speak louder in your
[1:30:07] words you know that you just that's a
[1:30:11] makeb believe thing but you're going to
[1:30:13] have makeb
[1:30:15] believers they going to have
[1:30:18] unbelievers it don't matter the matter
[1:30:21] is if you have a revelation of yourself
[1:30:23] you say I am a
[1:30:26] believer and I know it I've settled that
[1:30:29] in my heart this is imperfect
[1:30:33] Faith now remember they had the word
[1:30:37] he's talking about his disciples and you
[1:30:40] know the story they had the a boy I
[1:30:43] believe maybe had leprosy and they
[1:30:44] couldn't move the spirit the
[1:30:46] devil and and Jesus was speaking to him
[1:30:51] and so it finally comes down to this he
[1:30:54] says now remember they had the word and
[1:30:58] the Word was flesh
[1:31:01] then and the word told them I give you
[1:31:04] power right I
[1:31:07] give you power and they had the
[1:31:12] power but they didn't have faith to
[1:31:17] operate the word that was in
[1:31:21] them so there's a disconnect
[1:31:24] there he gave them the
[1:31:28] power but somewhere along the
[1:31:31] line they lost confidence in
[1:31:38] themselves maybe I don't have the power
[1:31:41] maybe he didn't give it to
[1:31:44] me and then even later on when they
[1:31:47] finally got back in a different
[1:31:48] circumstance he said oh we saw Satan
[1:31:51] falling he says don't rejoice in that
[1:31:53] Rejoice because your name is written in
[1:31:57] the Lamb's Book of Life another if I
[1:32:00] could say it this way rejoice in the
[1:32:03] self
[1:32:09] Revelation this
[1:32:12] morning wouldn't it be wonderful if
[1:32:14] every single one of us beyond a shadow
[1:32:17] of a doubt could stand here this morning
[1:32:19] and say I have a
[1:32:22] revelation that my name name is written
[1:32:25] in the Lamb's Book of
[1:32:28] Life and you're not trying to prove it
[1:32:31] to yourself all the time cuz the minute
[1:32:34] you try to prove it to yourself by your
[1:32:36] good works Satan comes along and trips
[1:32:38] you up and then you're caught in the
[1:32:41] balance
[1:32:42] who forget
[1:32:45] it why am I is my name written in the
[1:32:48] Lamb's Book of Life because he said so
[1:32:51] and I have a revelation a self
[1:32:54] Revelation that was
[1:33:01] me it's me yes it
[1:33:05] is he said but they had power but they
[1:33:08] didn't have the faith to operate the
[1:33:10] word that was in them see what I mean
[1:33:15] but Jesus had it he was the word and he
[1:33:20] had faith that what he said would happen
[1:33:25] he said oh bring him here how long will
[1:33:29] I suffer you he had Faith with his power
[1:33:33] how did
[1:33:35] he he said I can do nothing in myself
[1:33:40] why he relied on what he
[1:33:47] was
[1:33:49] now if Jesus had to rely on what he was
[1:33:54] how are you going to be a Christian if
[1:33:56] you can't rely on what you
[1:33:58] are and you can't rely on what you are
[1:34:01] if you don't know what you are if you
[1:34:04] don't have a revelation of
[1:34:09] yourself he said and I can do nothing in
[1:34:13] myself why he relied on what he was he
[1:34:16] relied in knowing that he was the word
[1:34:20] and he had faith in God who made him the
[1:34:25] word he was God's word and they was in
[1:34:30] him and they gave him Faith because he
[1:34:35] understood his
[1:34:41] position he had a
[1:34:44] self-revelation I was born in this world
[1:34:47] for this cause he went and sat down with
[1:34:49] the guys in the room that and he went
[1:34:52] over the scriptures and you know what he
[1:34:53] did every time he saw those scriptures
[1:34:55] he said that's me that's me that's
[1:35:01] me I went to
[1:35:04] Egypt I came out of Nazareth I was born
[1:35:08] in the House of David I was born in
[1:35:11] Bethlehem can you imagine him sitting
[1:35:14] there and seeing himself in the
[1:35:16] scripture what did he have he had a
[1:35:20] self-revelation he had a revelation of
[1:35:22] who he was Jesus Jesus operated by faith
[1:35:25] amen he operated by
[1:35:29] Revelation no wonder the world wants to
[1:35:31] make him a
[1:35:33] trinity if you make him God then he
[1:35:36] didn't need
[1:35:38] nothing but when you realize he learned
[1:35:40] obedience by the things he suffered he
[1:35:43] he he he he had Faith he was tempted in
[1:35:46] every way that we were tempted but yet
[1:35:49] he sinned
[1:35:50] not and he had it because it was a
[1:35:53] revelation of himself that's what his
[1:35:55] perfect Faith
[1:36:01] was you can have the same
[1:36:05] thing you can have the same
[1:36:08] confidence he recognized his
[1:36:12] position he understood his
[1:36:14] position he knowed what he was because
[1:36:18] the scriptures had said he was this he
[1:36:22] knowed what he was because the
[1:36:24] scriptures said he was this you know
[1:36:28] you're predestinated because the prophet
[1:36:30] said you
[1:36:32] were the word the opening of the seals
[1:36:36] who you
[1:36:38] are he know what he was because the
[1:36:40] scriptures had said he was this and here
[1:36:45] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[1:36:47] was exactly what the scriptures said he
[1:36:50] would be and he knew what
[1:36:54] he
[1:36:59] was I'm going to I just want to catch
[1:37:02] this I want us to understand that he's
[1:37:07] not asking us to have
[1:37:09] something that he hasn't already shown
[1:37:16] us when you when you make Jesus a third
[1:37:19] person he was just God that came out of
[1:37:21] heaven and he came down here and and he
[1:37:23] was God he didn't suffer he didn't do
[1:37:25] anything you missed the whole
[1:37:27] story you missed the whole story of
[1:37:30] kinsman redeemer you miss the whole
[1:37:33] story of the love affair you miss the
[1:37:35] whole story of him wanting to bring you
[1:37:38] back he put in front of you the Son and
[1:37:42] the daughter that you
[1:37:46] are the love of God is manifested in
[1:37:49] this as he is so are we in this world
[1:37:54] am look finish here he says therefore he
[1:37:57] relied upon what God had made him and if
[1:38:01] he did that then can't we rely upon what
[1:38:05] God made us as
[1:38:10] Believers now what are you relying
[1:38:16] on it's not just relying on the word
[1:38:21] alone everybody reads the Bible
[1:38:29] the the your position is not a
[1:38:34] reader your position is a
[1:38:40] Believer and you say well what do I have
[1:38:43] to believe with the only thing you have
[1:38:46] to believe with is what he made you to
[1:38:49] believe
[1:38:51] with he made you a
[1:38:56] Believer he
[1:38:58] said faith in what you are you're a
[1:39:01] Believer and if you got faith in God the
[1:39:06] Bible says over here if our hearts
[1:39:10] condemn us then we can't have faith but
[1:39:12] if our hearts condemn
[1:39:14] us uh if our then we can't Fai but if
[1:39:19] our hearts don't condemn us then we can
[1:39:22] have faith but if our hearts don't
[1:39:24] condemn us then we have faith we have
[1:39:27] confidence towards God if you want to
[1:39:30] read that St John 3:21 I've got it wrote
[1:39:34] down he says and then he makes this
[1:39:37] statement I think it's beauti is the
[1:39:39] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:39:42] faith in what you
[1:39:47] are have faith in what the word says you
[1:39:52] are Jesus Jesus had faith in the word of
[1:39:56] God that said he was it is written of me
[1:40:01] you have to have faith in what you are
[1:40:05] so you're going to have to have
[1:40:07] faith in what the scriptures say you are
[1:40:10] you're going to have to have faith in
[1:40:13] what the word of God says you are you
[1:40:16] you got to have faith in what you are so
[1:40:20] how do you have faith in what you are
[1:40:22] you've got to have a re revelation of
[1:40:25] self so when you when we can come to the
[1:40:27] place he says I I have a revelation and
[1:40:31] an understanding that I am the
[1:40:34] predestinated seed of God I was put here
[1:40:38] on this Earth for a purpose and he says
[1:40:43] see if I have this marked here it's a
[1:40:46] beautiful
[1:40:50] statement he says now what he said if
[1:40:53] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:40:56] you ask what you will and it'll be done
[1:40:59] then recognize your position in the
[1:41:02] scriptures as a Believer you've got to
[1:41:06] recognize your
[1:41:08] position as he
[1:41:11] recognized his
[1:41:17] position do you have a revelation of
[1:41:20] your position
[1:41:25] Let Me Maybe close
[1:41:27] up
[1:41:31] by talking a little bit about our
[1:41:36] position because we want to go
[1:41:39] forward amen if the sick comes amongst
[1:41:43] us we want to know that we've been
[1:41:47] commissioned by
[1:41:49] God to lay our hands on the sick and
[1:41:52] they will recover if they come
[1:41:59] asking you can
[1:42:02] respond and know this is my
[1:42:06] position I've been placed here by God to
[1:42:11] respond to this
[1:42:14] circumstance this person has come and
[1:42:19] ask they've come to me because I'm an
[1:42:21] ambassador
[1:42:24] not me personally but us as a body and
[1:42:27] that's our
[1:42:29] position is to lay hands on the sick and
[1:42:32] they
[1:42:35] recover if it if the word doesn't become
[1:42:39] flesh then it's
[1:42:42] theology if the word always remains on
[1:42:46] the
[1:42:47] outside it's a covering and that's what
[1:42:50] religion is is a covering but when the
[1:42:53] believer takes the word and that word
[1:42:57] now becomes a description of themselves
[1:43:00] and they can say I am the word I am a
[1:43:04] part of the word how many times that our
[1:43:07] messenger tell us you are the word
[1:43:09] you're a part of the word you're part of
[1:43:11] him you're the word made
[1:43:15] flesh because he wants somebody to get a
[1:43:19] revelation of themselves and say that's
[1:43:22] me amen
[1:43:27] maybe even take it to the place and say
[1:43:29] that's
[1:43:31] mine that's my
[1:43:33] promise by these exceedingly great and
[1:43:36] precious promises we are partakers of
[1:43:40] divine
[1:43:42] nature how do you partake of divine
[1:43:44] nature to be a partaker of divine nature
[1:43:47] means the divine nature now becomes your
[1:43:51] nature through that
[1:43:57] promise not a bite in a
[1:44:01] nibble this ain't a smage for this is
[1:44:06] eat the whole
[1:44:08] thing every promise in the book is mine
[1:44:12] every chapter every verse every
[1:44:17] line not only is it something I believe
[1:44:20] it's something that I am
[1:44:26] I
[1:44:27] am the believer in this age I am the
[1:44:32] chosen
[1:44:34] elected
[1:44:36] predestinated bride seed that was to be
[1:44:39] here in this
[1:44:41] hour who is
[1:44:43] it it's
[1:44:47] me it's me I've come to a revelation
[1:44:51] well you were scoundrel
[1:44:53] yes praise God for the
[1:44:56] blood I didn't choose him he chose me if
[1:45:00] he wants to make me part of the Bride
[1:45:02] he'll make me ready he'll mold me he'll
[1:45:06] make me he'll fix me he'll make me be
[1:45:09] exactly what I need to
[1:45:14] be I don't have to worry about
[1:45:18] it I don't even have to prove to him
[1:45:23] I have nothing to
[1:45:28] prove he said well what are you relying
[1:45:31] on what he
[1:45:37] said when he said my name was written on
[1:45:40] the Lamb's Book of
[1:45:42] Life I believe
[1:45:45] it when he said nothing can put it on or
[1:45:49] nothing can take it off I believe it
[1:45:52] remains yes
[1:45:53] I didn't send it
[1:45:58] off I can't erase
[1:46:02] it but I'll tell you one thing he'll do
[1:46:05] if I keep taking advantage of it he'll
[1:46:08] work me over and he'll put me in a
[1:46:10] wheelchair somewhere well you but he
[1:46:12] he'll get his just
[1:46:17] reward but he won't lose a
[1:46:21] one he won't lose a one you don't have
[1:46:24] to worry about being lost you're
[1:46:26] eternally
[1:46:29] secure you say what happens if I don't
[1:46:31] do this and don't do
[1:46:35] that people are always worried about the
[1:46:38] evidence of what the whether I've got
[1:46:40] the Holy Spirit or not you know what the
[1:46:43] evidence of the holy spirit is you
[1:46:46] believe every word of God
[1:46:54] got a whole religion that doesn't
[1:46:57] believe anybody has the Holy Spirit
[1:46:58] until they speak in
[1:47:00] tongues well all kinds of people speak
[1:47:02] in tongues heathens speak in tongues so
[1:47:05] now they have to come up with phase
[1:47:08] two and phase two is whatever shape
[1:47:10] you're in when you
[1:47:13] die is how you're going to meet
[1:47:18] God well if I had the choice
[1:47:23] of when I was gonna
[1:47:25] die I would make
[1:47:28] sure that on that particular
[1:47:34] day I was in good
[1:47:38] standing no I like being eternally
[1:47:42] secure I like the Revelation that my
[1:47:45] name was on the Lamb's Book of
[1:47:48] Life I like that it can't be taken off
[1:47:51] am
[1:47:53] well if I believe
[1:47:55] that then it'll bring forth fruit yes
[1:47:59] that proves
[1:48:01] that the proof is in the fruit that's
[1:48:05] what you know them by you know the apple
[1:48:08] trees and apple tree by what it's
[1:48:11] fruit it's
[1:48:13] evidence now people preach the evidence
[1:48:16] is
[1:48:18] prosperity isn't it funny the evidence
[1:48:21] of Christianity
[1:48:23] is now the thing that makes it harder to
[1:48:25] get through the eye of the
[1:48:30] needle it's harder to get into heaven
[1:48:33] with riches and everybody wants to be
[1:48:36] rich the description of the church is
[1:48:39] not it'll be successful businessmen it's
[1:48:42] those that are poor in this
[1:48:45] world rich in
[1:48:50] faith don't don't you
[1:48:53] want to rely on
[1:48:55] that what a
[1:48:57] comfort what a comfort I've never seen
[1:48:59] my beg
[1:49:01] bread what a
[1:49:04] comfort I believe it Lord I believe
[1:49:06] that's me I have a revelation of myself
[1:49:10] in the scriptures let's close in reading
[1:49:12] this this
[1:49:20] morning self-revelation
[1:49:24] I am a
[1:49:27] believer
[1:49:29] notice it was by his Believers that he
[1:49:33] proves his
[1:49:34] word by he can only prove his word not
[1:49:39] by
[1:49:41] unbelievers it's only by the Believers
[1:49:45] that he can prove his
[1:49:47] word no matter how much the rest of them
[1:49:51] claim to be
[1:49:54] oh I believe
[1:49:55] brother if you do God will prove it
[1:50:00] so because we look and see the others
[1:50:05] how can we say then see it's by the True
[1:50:09] Believer that he proves his word not by
[1:50:13] those who say they believe but by those
[1:50:16] who really believe it's by his believing
[1:50:21] children that he proves his
[1:50:28] word
[1:50:31] self-revelation I'm a believing
[1:50:37] child what's my
[1:50:40] position to prove his
[1:50:45] word I a believing
[1:50:48] child that's what he made me that's what
[1:50:51] he predestined ated me that's what he
[1:50:54] put me here to be that's who I
[1:50:58] am what are you I'm a believing
[1:51:02] child what are you doing here I'm here
[1:51:05] to prove his
[1:51:08] word I have a revelation of my
[1:51:12] existence I have a revelation of my
[1:51:15] position I'm not in the Run Race trying
[1:51:19] to get there
[1:51:23] I'm not trying
[1:51:24] to get enough works to tilt the scale in
[1:51:28] my
[1:51:32] favor I've got a revelation beyond that
[1:51:35] I've got a
[1:51:37] self-revelation that if I ever had
[1:51:39] eternal life I've always had eternal
[1:51:43] life I always had eternal life in
[1:51:47] me I always was the
[1:51:49] word I always was a part of him
[1:51:54] him it's not something I came
[1:51:58] to that I
[1:52:01] chose no matter the obstacles that Satan
[1:52:04] put in my path God got me to where that
[1:52:08] I am because of what I
[1:52:15] am it was
[1:52:18] all pre-planned
[1:52:24] why can't we accept
[1:52:26] it why is it so
[1:52:30] hard that we got to keep looking at this
[1:52:34] flesh that has no good thing in
[1:52:38] it that was born in sin and shaped in
[1:52:42] iniquity in fact this flesh isn't even
[1:52:46] going I got a new one waiting for
[1:52:50] me the one I would have always had if I
[1:52:54] didn't drop down in this little space of
[1:52:56] time so that God could manifest his
[1:53:00] attributes I'm not caught up in the
[1:53:02] religious
[1:53:05] struggle I'm not caught up in worrying
[1:53:07] about
[1:53:08] things there's only one thing I want to
[1:53:12] settle in my heart is I want to have a
[1:53:15] self
[1:53:17] Revelation that I am that elect seed and
[1:53:21] I know it by divine
[1:53:24] revelation I see myself in the
[1:53:27] scriptures that have been spoken I see
[1:53:31] myself in the
[1:53:34] message when he says if you have eternal
[1:53:36] life you always had eternal
[1:53:39] life that's
[1:53:42] me I'm sorry I know I got a rough
[1:53:46] personality I know I'm hard on the edges
[1:53:50] I I know I'm hard to work for I I know
[1:53:53] I'm a slave driver I know all those
[1:53:56] things but I'm sorry he chose
[1:54:01] me and I'm going to be
[1:54:04] there and either he's going to fix you
[1:54:07] or he's going to fix me but we're all
[1:54:09] going to get along on the other
[1:54:12] [Applause]
[1:54:16] side I'm not relying on
[1:54:19] this I'm relying on what he said and he
[1:54:27] said he said he predestinated me he said
[1:54:31] he opened my eyes to see it he said when
[1:54:34] the word struck the seed it brought it
[1:54:37] to life he said he said he said and who
[1:54:42] was he talking about me me
[1:54:50] me no wonder he can say I am the father
[1:54:53] are
[1:54:54] one that's right and we can say I am the
[1:54:59] father are
[1:55:02] one it was his plan in the beginning to
[1:55:06] put us
[1:55:07] here Satan got nothing going
[1:55:11] on Satan's world is
[1:55:17] toast there ain't nothing going on the
[1:55:20] only thing that's going on is what God
[1:55:22] God's got going on and what God's got
[1:55:25] going on is giving the
[1:55:27] self-revelation to his Believers so they
[1:55:30] can stand up and take sides with Jesus
[1:55:33] the word of
[1:55:35] God and say that's
[1:55:40] me here I
[1:55:46] am didn't make
[1:55:48] myself didn't save
[1:55:51] myself didn't earn
[1:55:53] it well you sure got a lot of things
[1:55:56] wrong with you
[1:55:58] good unbelief doesn't stop
[1:56:03] God unbelief doesn't stop
[1:56:09] God I know the messenger said this he
[1:56:12] said you save yourself and God a lot of
[1:56:17] trouble if you'd sit
[1:56:19] down and solve the issue
[1:56:22] of
[1:56:28] self-revelation that you will
[1:56:30] take the
[1:56:33] position that he's given you as
[1:56:36] Believers let's read this in Clos
[1:56:48] in now if I want you to notice
[1:56:54] he does
[1:56:55] that way in every age he does it every
[1:56:59] time by the same method he has to take
[1:57:05] Believers and in order to have Believers
[1:57:09] to meet that
[1:57:11] word
[1:57:14] now remember my point this
[1:57:19] morning I want you to stand up and say
[1:57:21] that's me
[1:57:23] yes I'm that person he's talking about
[1:57:28] me we want to end the
[1:57:34] wishy-washy what are you
[1:57:36] believing I'm certainly don't believe
[1:57:41] myself but I can believe what he
[1:57:46] said that's what every believer's got to
[1:57:50] finally anchor in
[1:57:52] he said
[1:57:54] it why am I elected because he said I
[1:57:58] was I believe what he
[1:58:02] said he's talking about
[1:58:06] somebody
[1:58:08] right why not make it
[1:58:13] you I mean do you love the world and the
[1:58:18] things of the
[1:58:19] world is there something out there
[1:58:21] that's more attractive to
[1:58:23] you than eternal
[1:58:26] life back in the beautiful
[1:58:30] garden back loving and living the way
[1:58:34] that you were created to
[1:58:37] live I'm sorry there'll be no Porsches
[1:58:40] there there'll be no Corvettes
[1:58:44] there there'll be no speeding tickets
[1:58:46] there there'll be no car wrecks there
[1:58:53] people say I'm going to get a mansion
[1:58:55] well I surely don't want a
[1:58:58] house it's not the Mansion I'm looking
[1:59:01] for I'm looking for that
[1:59:04] body that house that he dwells in that's
[1:59:07] right just think about it there's
[1:59:11] nothing here
[1:59:14] church so why don't we take our Eternal
[1:59:16] position
[1:59:20] now why don't we take our
[1:59:23] Eternal
[1:59:25] description of who we are from
[1:59:30] God why don't we come to that place
[1:59:34] where we can say I am what he says I
[1:59:38] am Satan don't
[1:59:41] believe he's never going to give you
[1:59:44] credit his whole journey is to prove
[1:59:47] that you're a
[1:59:49] liar he might prove me to be be a liar
[1:59:52] but he'll never prove him to be a
[1:59:55] liar cuz his words will never
[2:00:03] fail he does it by the same method he
[2:00:06] has to take Believers then in order to
[2:00:09] have Believers to meet that word he's
[2:00:12] got to predestinate it to that age you
[2:00:16] see it he's got to predestinate
[2:00:22] this thing to be there to meet the
[2:00:24] challenge of the age did you get
[2:00:28] it did you feel it did you see it did
[2:00:33] you understand
[2:00:35] it what a series of
[2:00:40] questions when he just
[2:00:43] described why you're
[2:00:47] here the whole reason you're here
[2:00:53] now your parents might have said you
[2:00:54] were a mistake but you weren't a mistake
[2:00:56] to
[2:00:58] God God put you
[2:01:02] here that's you are not here by your own
[2:01:06] choosing
[2:01:09] that's fact he he went way way back
[2:01:12] Generations back grandfathers great
[2:01:15] grandfathers bringing that all those
[2:01:18] down together for you to be here this
[2:01:22] morning not somebody else
[2:01:26] you I don't care how old you are I don't
[2:01:29] care if you're in fifth grade sixth
[2:01:30] grade teenager or whatever here you're
[2:01:33] here because God put you
[2:01:36] here and he put you here to fulfill
[2:01:39] something yes
[2:01:41] sir cuz he still runs the
[2:01:47] show now he says in order for God to
[2:01:50] prove his word he has a predestinate a
[2:01:53] Believer to be here do you see
[2:01:57] it what's he saying do you have
[2:02:01] self-revelation do you feel it do you
[2:02:03] have
[2:02:04] self-revelation do you understand it do
[2:02:07] you have self-revelation do you this
[2:02:10] morning have a revelation of
[2:02:12] yourself that I am the
[2:02:15] predestinated word spoken seed of God
[2:02:19] made flesh I come from God I go to
[2:02:25] God I don't care what you see in the
[2:02:32] mirror do you believe what he
[2:02:37] said because when you get the
[2:02:40] self-revelation that empowers you to
[2:02:43] possess the Gate of your enemy it
[2:02:46] empowers you to drive him out of your
[2:02:48] life it empowers you to put down the
[2:02:51] lust and the sin and the
[2:02:56] bitterness cuz Jesus relied on who he
[2:03:01] was for his
[2:03:03] power how are you going to have power if
[2:03:06] you can't rely on what God made
[2:03:13] you I believe he knows what he's
[2:03:18] doing you can't take this book and make
[2:03:22] it
[2:03:23] work if you don't believe you're called
[2:03:26] to make it
[2:03:28] work you're always waiting to
[2:03:31] see I'm going to try it I'm going to try
[2:03:36] this Jesus expected it to happen yes
[2:03:41] sir because of what the scriptures said
[2:03:44] he
[2:03:49] was it wasn't a trying
[2:03:53] deal it wasn't I'm going to pray and see
[2:03:56] if it
[2:03:58] works he had a
[2:04:02] self-revelation can you imagine when we
[2:04:04] come to the place that we say I have
[2:04:06] been put here to prove his
[2:04:09] word the my very
[2:04:14] existence the reason I
[2:04:20] am to act actually have an understanding
[2:04:24] and revelation of your
[2:04:26] existence and
[2:04:28] position in everything I don't care how
[2:04:31] long it's
[2:04:32] taken remember he said he predestinated
[2:04:35] to be there right at that
[2:04:41] time every timing is
[2:04:44] perfect let's just finish
[2:04:52] he says you see
[2:04:58] it that's what's happening today he
[2:05:04] predestinate it this by for knowledge he
[2:05:08] predestinated Malachi 4:5 it's got to
[2:05:12] happen and when he comes over and
[2:05:14] predestines anything to happen in his
[2:05:18] word he had to provide prove his
[2:05:22] word to be so when he predestines
[2:05:26] anything to happen and says it will
[2:05:30] happen he knows that seed will be there
[2:05:35] just at that time he predestinated a
[2:05:39] bride she's going to be there going to
[2:05:43] be a Rapture she's going to be there he
[2:05:47] predestinated it by his for knowledge
[2:05:49] see there's nothing's going to stop
[2:05:56] it do you believe there's going to be
[2:05:59] anybody in the
[2:06:03] Rapture do you believe it's
[2:06:09] you do you understand that changes
[2:06:12] everything it changes your attitude it
[2:06:16] changes your fear it changes the way you
[2:06:19] treat people self re reation changes
[2:06:23] everything you're not looking at the
[2:06:25] world to make you something you're not
[2:06:28] looking at education to make you
[2:06:30] something you're not looking at peers to
[2:06:32] make you something you're not looking at
[2:06:35] religion to make you something you know
[2:06:37] something that God made you what you are
[2:06:41] before the foundations of the world you
[2:06:44] just finally got
[2:06:47] here I may be late but I made it
[2:06:56] I shook
[2:06:59] up I'm in the palm of his hand and
[2:07:03] nothing can pluck me out the footsteps
[2:07:06] of the righteous are ordered by the Lord
[2:07:09] you didn't choose me I chose you and if
[2:07:11] I started to work in it I'll finish it
[2:07:14] till the
[2:07:15] end oh Lord God give me a revelation of
[2:07:20] myself
[2:07:22] give me a revelation of where I sit in
[2:07:24] the Eternal calendar of God give me a
[2:07:27] revelation of why that you place me here
[2:07:30] give me a revelation of what I'm to do
[2:07:33] Lord give me a revelation of
[2:07:35] self
[2:07:42] am you say how important is
[2:07:45] it let me read this last statement as we
[2:07:48] close and Billy comes to give us worship
[2:07:53] he said he proves all his
[2:07:56] word all of his words just think of it
[2:08:02] all of his word and you were his
[2:08:08] word what do you think the promises of
[2:08:11] God
[2:08:12] do they don't prove
[2:08:14] him they prove
[2:08:18] you they prove whether you're a believer
[2:08:23] or
[2:08:24] unbeliever he don't need no
[2:08:27] proven he was there before there was
[2:08:30] anything to prove anything he is the
[2:08:33] proof of all things all things exist by
[2:08:38] him there's nothing that exists that
[2:08:40] didn't exist by him he's the proof he
[2:08:43] don't need to prove
[2:08:45] himself but he gives you a
[2:08:49] promise and then it pro proves Who You
[2:08:53] Are by whether you believe and accept
[2:08:55] that
[2:08:57] promise then that word comes to pass he
[2:09:00] proved it by you you're the
[2:09:03] word you're what he spoke you're what he
[2:09:07] said he'd be
[2:09:09] here you're the bride he said he would
[2:09:11] have you're the Rapture that he said's
[2:09:14] going to
[2:09:16] be this isn't historic this isn't
[2:09:20] theology this is the word made
[2:09:26] flesh I don't care what you think about
[2:09:32] yourself that's why the plastic surgeons

[2:11:59] sinner I died for
[2:12:03] you I paid the price the chastisements

[2:12:34] he was mocked and ridiculed in
[2:12:37] everything oh where's the
[2:12:39] rain you know I can see them all walking
[2:12:43] around this big boat with
[2:12:47] umbrellas he knew one thing didn't he he
[2:12:50] knew knew it was going to
[2:12:52] rain he didn't care
[2:12:55] when he didn't know how he didn't know
[2:12:59] one he knew that God said
[2:13:02] so and that settled
[2:13:05] it perfect
[2:13:08] faith is your name written on the Lamb's
[2:13:11] Book of Life were you predestinated to
[2:13:14] be here to prove his
[2:13:19] word you have eternal
[2:13:21] life not because you earned eternal life
[2:13:25] you might come to the awareness of your
[2:13:28] eternal life but remember what he said
[2:13:31] he said that seed was already laying
[2:13:34] there planted before the foundation of
[2:13:37] the world just waiting to be
[2:13:41] watered by the word of God to come to
[2:13:45] life that's me that's you and that's
[2:13:50] what he said that you have love one for
[2:13:52] another that you have confidence in one
[2:13:55] another that you believe what God did
[2:13:58] for you he did for the person sitting
[2:14:00] next to you it changes your attitude it
[2:14:04] changes your atmosphere it changes what
[2:14:06] you live
[2:14:08] for you don't want to run off and hide
[2:14:12] you want to tell the
[2:14:14] world go into all the world and preach
[2:14:17] the gospel they'll know that you are my
[2:14:20] disciples
[2:14:21] by your love to another the musicians
[2:14:24] would
[2:14:32] come he proves all of his
[2:14:35] word all of his word just think of
[2:14:43] it all of his word and you were his
[2:14:48] word he was the word and you were a part
[2:14:52] of his word and the reason that you're
[2:14:56] sent
[2:14:58] here to
[2:15:00] confirm your place in
[2:15:04] life I don't think you got that he is
[2:15:08] the
[2:15:11] word you're sent here to
[2:15:15] confirm your place in
[2:15:18] life what is my place in life my place
[2:15:23] in life is this simple he predestinated
[2:15:27] a seed to be
[2:15:30] here to believe his
[2:15:33] word that's why I'm
[2:15:35] here that's my place in life that's
[2:15:39] everything that I am is for that
[2:15:44] reason it's that
[2:15:49] simple it's not complicated
[2:15:52] why are you
[2:15:56] here I'm going to go see my
[2:16:00] mama you're my
[2:16:02] mother my dad has gone
[2:16:06] on my mom probably doesn't have too much
[2:16:10] longer 102 in
[2:16:12] July I got to accept the fact
[2:16:16] that whether it's a year or two years
[2:16:23] but they
[2:16:26] go but the reason that I'm here hasn't
[2:16:30] gone it'll never
[2:16:33] go it's why I Was
[2:16:37] Made I was made to believe this
[2:16:43] message I was made created by God to
[2:16:49] take a promise
[2:16:51] and believe it and prove that that
[2:16:54] promise is true I was made for
[2:16:58] that I wasn't made to get
[2:17:02] rich I like to build but I wasn't made
[2:17:05] to
[2:17:07] build I was made to be
[2:17:12] fruitful I was made to look up and say
[2:17:14] father thank you for putting my name on
[2:17:17] the Lamb's Book of Life before the found
[2:17:20] foundation of the
[2:17:22] world thank you for choosing
[2:17:26] me thank you for giving me I have that I
[2:17:30] might
[2:17:31] see thank you for giving me ears Lord
[2:17:35] that I can hear this
[2:17:38] message thank you that I can read
[2:17:42] and know that when he talks about the
[2:17:46] predestinated
[2:17:48] seed he's talking about me
[2:17:52] Lord increase
[2:17:54] myself
[2:17:58] Revelation I don't want to know what I
[2:18:01] think of
[2:18:02] myself I want to know what he thinks of
[2:18:06] me and where are you going to find that
[2:18:09] I find it in his
[2:18:12] word and when he says I
[2:18:17] believe that God proves his word by the
[2:18:20] believer
[2:18:22] so he predestines that seed to be here
[2:18:26] he brought Malachi 45 but Malachi 45
[2:18:30] would have went
[2:18:31] unnoticed if he didn't predestinate a
[2:18:34] seed to sit there and say that's Malachi
[2:18:37] 45 that's Luke
[2:18:40] 17:30 that's Revelations 10:7 that's
[2:18:44] deity veiled in flesh that's
[2:18:49] Elohim in our midst doing the same signs
[2:18:53] and wonders that he did 2,000 years ago
[2:18:56] you know why we say
[2:18:59] that because we stumbled upon it because
[2:19:02] we were
[2:19:06] predestinated it's our position he's put

[2:19:13] position your position as a
[2:19:16] Believer can't you
