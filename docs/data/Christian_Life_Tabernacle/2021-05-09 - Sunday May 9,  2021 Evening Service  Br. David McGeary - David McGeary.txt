Description:
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Evening Service: May 9,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

lord you are so wonderful that in this hour you would open to us your plan and reveal to us your great mystery that you would pull the cover off what's been hid through all the ages and reveal it to us we ask that you'd further bless us this evening in your word that you would open to us farther father the things that you have for us we ask you to bless us we pray in jesus precious name amen amen let's once again open our bibles to hebrews and and uh read the scriptures i guess the great revelation of melchizedek scared most everybody off but that's good we ought to turn off the stream and just rejoice with those of us who have come out to the house of the lord and and rejoice in the things of god let us come into our scriptures and start in hebrews the 6th chapter and the starting with let's start with the 16th verse and just read as paul unfolds this great mystery for us he says for men verily swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them the end of all strife wherein god willingly more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immunability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immunible things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation whom have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that set before us now he's going to give us a glimpse of what that hope was remember this morning which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into which entereth unto within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest forever after the order of malkesadet for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god whom meant abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom abraham also gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but made liken unto the son of god abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was and whom even abra whom even the patriarch abraham give a tenth part of his spoils amen amen heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us tonight in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated we're going to pick up again and play the next little portion of the of this message but i'd like to do something i guess i might say a a little different i'd like to just kind of look at a few of the quotes before we listen to them and it just i kind of a backwards from what that we did it this morning but um so if you would uh pull up there paragraph uh 64 and and then we just want to read just a few of these statements to us ahead of time so you're you're going to find out um what we've been talking about we're going to follow this to where he goes and it's going to be a wonderful so he says here he says now in the paragraph 64 now god in this stage of his creation later formed into flesh jesus from what from the great beginning spirit then he come down to be word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke out emorphate later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners but when he when abraham meant him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want you to watch how we have to come also we see him revealing here in ruth and boaz as a kinsmen redeemer how he had to become flesh now we see the attribute son of his spirit having not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and the earnest waiting for the exchange of the body now he's he's he's preaching here and he's telling us that when he was these great attributes of god then he went from those attributes to a word form theophany and that's how he appeared to abraham letting us know what we would all become but then he became flesh now listen now this is paragraph 68 we're going to play the tape but we just want to lay this out again so you can hear it and hear it he says now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word an emorphing body so he changed the morphe means to change mass to change things so the difference between you and him between you and jesus the difference between you and what he was when he was melchizedek see he was at the beginning the word amorphy body he came in and lived in that in that person of melchizedek then later we never hear no more of melchizedek because he became jesus okay he wasn't jesus but he became jesus so he became word to flesh and jesus was the word made flesh okay so we see that he was the word made a flesh and then later we hear no more of malchester because he became jesus melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet you come like adam like me you became from the attribute to flesh to be tempted so remember he was attribute and you were there and you were were and then he became word and you were a part of that and he became flesh but you bypassed that word part that knew all things and he says now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet you become like adam like me you become you became from attribute to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become flesh man not the word but what are we becoming we are becoming the word in the invisible union he makes this statement if i was supposed to die in the morning a man took my place i cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that i might become him the word so he became flesh because we bypass the word right and became flesh to be tempted but he became flesh and took my place that we might become word so he became flesh because we bypassed it so that god might show us attributes so that he could take us back to word and he said and that amen he says and jesus the word took my place he become me the sinner that i might become him the word amen now let me hold that true to that not the church the word oh the spiritual union of christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifest vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it is happening day by day he said why it's accumulating so fast out there on those deserts and taking place i couldn't even keep up with it near the coming of jesus to be united with his church where the word beca where where the word becomes the word called the holy spirit searching the hearts so we we know that so he bypassed he came down and he was in all these attribute forms we knew that he was and then he he he thought out if i could use that carnal interpreter when we say when we say thought we think it out when god says thought it's an expression so the minute it becomes word it becomes eternal so he thought out this plan if the best way we could say it and so he went from what that he was all these great attributes to his thoughts expressed and when the thoughts was expressed it was from beginning to end it was alpha in omega it wasn't a plan not worked out it was a complete plan that was the beginning of time he says time began when he this thought and when he had this thought that's when the book of life came into view right then that's where he put your name you were eternal in him right then so he put your name on that book to be redeemed why did he put your name on the book to be redeemed because he knew that he was going to let you bypass the word form come down here as a sinner and that you so you could uh partake of the attributes of him being a deliverer so he needed you to be a part of the plan to reveal himself [Applause] so you're in his perfect plan you're in his perfect will you and not that we would uh sin that the grace of god abound god forbid but that we would understand that if we weren't predestinated and we weren't in his thinking we would never be there because he's the only author of eternal life so we find out that right in that great plan of god that he wants to reveal himself he needs your part of it to skip the word and become flesh because if you didn't skip that part he would have never been able to reveal that he was a savior he would never be able to reveal he was a healer he would never be able to reveal it so you are part of the revelation of god you are in the word but you haven't become the word yet but he shows in melchizedek what every son of god would become now when you understand that you haven't become word yet because if you would have come in that state you would have known the plan of god from beginning to end but he doesn't do that he unfolds it to you and how does he let us know what the word of god is he opens the seven seal mystery he pulls the cover off of us and he reveals to us the revelation of who is this malkiesada see you ask well i thought jesus yes jesus was the personality of god but he he became from attribute this one person then to word body melchizedek so the body what that melchizedek was in when he showed abraham was not the flesh sinful body that jesus became he only became that body because we came in flesh and he had to redeem that flesh that he could bring it back to the body that melchizedek had which was a word body so he allowed us to bypass that word body but to make it fair and just he put our names on the lamb's book of life that we would never fall that nothing could take it off so he already secured us eternally in his word thought he just didn't give us that body yet hallelujah but we're going to get that body but in order to fulfill his whole revealing of himself we had to play our part in the revealing of himself so instead of just giving us that melchizedek body he even left that body and became sin think of that what is flesh it's sin it goes all the way back to the serpent's seed it all he goes back that we were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies so we didn't get that we bypassed that but the word didn't bypass that so what was melchizedek he was the word body that we are going to receive when this earthly temple be dissolved we have one waiting for us but god showed that to be true by taking on a representation before jesus became flesh showing us that we are going back to that body so he became flesh and then when he died he returned back into that word body theophany melchizedek that he was became before he came flesh so we could know we could come flesh to that same word body that melchizedek represented amen really when you think about it's pretty simple it is right in other words for god to show he was a healer a redeemer a deliverer he let us bypass what he always had in mind for us so he could reveal himself and then like we could go to ephesians we could go to all the scriptures that paul talked about about how we were made for his pleasure we were made for his purpose we were made for his glory we were made so he could be glorified so he let us go this route oh that ought to give us rest but he didn't leave us lost did he [Music] and we just read it he became a kinsmen redeemer so he showed that in ruth and boaz in the opening of the seals what's the first thing that brother branham preaches he preaches the breach but what the breach is it's the kinsman redeemer he preaches the kinsmen redeemer he preaches that he became flesh but why was he our kinsmen redeemer not because of our flesh we were kinsmen to the body that he was in in malkesada that's what we're kind to because we bypass that right but to to restore or redeem means to bring back he's bringing us back to what we were in the word or what we bypassed oh my god now he's opening that to us now here he opens this great revelation and what do you feel or do you think that he's expecting from those that get this great revelation and then he goes in to that and we'll play the tape and then you'll see it and i'm i'm just reading you these things so and then so he comes down he says this is still paragraph and he said you have never been able to know that yet you come like adam you come like me because from attribute to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished and this early tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done we don't understand it we have never become the word we've never be we've just become flesh man not word so we understand he said now look clearly makes it clear to you you'll never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning now remember what the word was the word was the expression remind remember what he said god thought you and then he expressed you and here you are even the color of your hair the color of your eyes and everything he thought it and then here you were okay so he says that proves the predestination of god see you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first i mean can you imagine this that if we were in the thinking first okay and he allows us to come into this flesh and he made provisions for this flesh that nothing could be laid to the charge of god's elect that the blood of the lamb cleanses us from all unrighteousness even though and then we realize that if we were not struggling to make ourselves into the word there's a time for that okay but now the part that we play now is we become subject to the spirit of god so that's what we first do is we come to the spirit of god when the word says this we quickly respond so we become subject to the word of god and tell the change of our body till we go back to that word body so you understand when abraham showed up i mean when malkizadek showed up that was the person of god in what we call a word body that's what the theophany is it's the word body it's the thought body it's the original body that god thought of for every one of his sons and daughters this flesh that we're in with the five senses that's tempted and fails in sin no flesh shall inherit the kingdom of god the only thing that will inherit the kingdom of god is that predestinated word body that god had in his mind we haven't got that yet but where is it at it's waiting for us when this body be dissolved we have one waiting for them so they're not bodies stacked up like cord wood and they're not this body because if we were to get this body it would die again but we he he couldn't have a beginning and an end he couldn't have a plan without an end because he's alpha and omega and the scripture says when we see him as he is so shall we become like him so now what's he doing he's showing us his plan he's showing us what he had in mind all from the beginning he's showing us why we came down here in the flesh why we were born in sin but that wasn't the end really it's just the beginning it's beautiful i i don't know if i can get that into your mind this body is just a shadow so this is what jesus did he that person okay you have to understand there's not three persons that person that god turned himself into the first thing god did as a great whatever he wanted fellowship he had to become something to fellowship with so he became a person a personality a word right and that word took on a body the image that we were created in that's what appeared to abraham called melchizedek not a fleshly body like this that wrinkles and gets old it's that body that can walk through walls it's the bodies can walk on water it's the body that that never grows old okay we ain't got that yet we're looking for it we're believing for it but what's he do he's always been that kind of god he reveals it to us so it becomes our hope and so we just read a couple more statements he said he says and then when you become subject to the spirit it throws your whole body subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word manifested or quick and made alive and when the bible says don't do this the body quickly turns to it there's no question and what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will raise up again because it's already started amen it was once subject to sin and mire and corruption but now it's got the earnest turns and it's turned and this book says heavenly but when i listen to the tape i clearly hear so i don't want to disagree with the people that publish this book but it sounds to me like he says it's turned home now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture it's the earnest okay so we don't have that body yet we have this fleshly body but the earnest that we're going to get that body and go into that rapture is the desire in our heart to bring this body subject to that spirit so that's what we're in we're in that quickening that it's already started it we're trying to bring this body in subjection this body will never come into subjection but the spirit that's in you wants to be delivered from this body it wants to bring this body into subjection so it keeps crying out what's it crying out for it's crying out for that perfect body that it's hearing from so it's a down payment that god gives you that spirit calling you working you convicting you of sin you say oh my i've got this you know it it makes me feel terrible sometimes it exposes me but praise god that's how he lets us know that i have a body waiting for him he creates a conflict between your fleshly body and your heavenly body and these two are warring against one another oh my goodness [Applause] can you see it brother can you see it wow the very law of contrast works in our mortal body we can't even live in this thing it's not our home that's why and you listen maybe i'll have them stop it and play it over again because i i listened to it four or five times and it says to me he says and if i'm wrong my hearing's not very great as many of you noticed but he says it turned home home that's where i dwell the real dwelling place and and so we see that it it becomes subject and so okay and we just and then he says and then we just read that and then i'm going to read a couple more statements and play it he says now how wonderful we love him now this body this is paragraph 76 is subject to the spirit have not yet entered in to the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word death in the flesh will take us there really the rapture's death the rapture is a different form of the grave [Applause] people like those little things so i thought i could show you i can do those things too did you understand that what is the rapture it's the release from this body what is death it's the release from this body didn't you hear brother brahm says whether i go on the rapture or whether i die what difference does it make i hope what this stirs up into us is that we all need to get a lot more serious about the leadership of the holy spirit and following god and being where the word of god is being opened and revealed that's why we need to be on the field not off the field on the field there's only one hiding place and that's in the lord jesus so listen what he says there he says in but we're still in the flesh form but subject to the word death is in the flesh just the same thing think of a little baby you can take a woman this is my mother's day's message you can take a woman no matter how evil she is and when she is pregnant and fixing to be mother watch before the baby's born i don't care how cruel the woman is she gets real kind there's something about her seems godly see the little mother's fixing to become mother by the baby the only way she becomes mother is by the baby the mother doesn't produce the baby the baby produces the mother now doesn't that let you know we're all backwards we got this thing all backwards can you think of that to yourself okay we make god the healer we make god the deliverer [Applause] you understand that in other words he let us bypass that so we could be sinners so we could be saved but he doesn't lose us because he already put our name on the book so we're doing this for him do you see what he said if you if you're warning his thinking and you weren't predestinated to eternal life you will never have it there's nothing you could ever do here for your salvation not one thing the only reason that he sends his spirit to put you into the conflict with your flesh is to let you know that this flesh is not the end of you i feel sorry for all the people who are home i don't think we ought to send this out i don't think we ought to let anybody stream in on it this is the food for the elected tonight it and so let's just read a couple more statements he says it's like the baby he said why is it the little body now it's not alive yet see it's the only thing is it's just flesh and muscle that little jumping that's just muscles jerking but when it comes forth from the womb god breath the breath of life into it and then he screams out just as sure as there's a natural body being formed there is a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here then when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit baby in christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to now that is the same description that he gave of the theophany body that he was in when he appeared to abraham is that right he says then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body that's the reason jesus went to hell when he died and preached the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany so what did jesus do he turned back into the theophany that he was become he became flesh because his work was finished in the flesh because he became kinsmen redeemer now we now can leave this flesh and go back and pick up our theophany body our word body the same body that he appeared to the melchizedek in and that's the revelation that was hid in who's this melchizedek jesus became flesh that we might become [Applause] word 79 ii corinthians 5 and 1 if this earthly body be dissolved this earthly tabernacle we have another one see we have bypassed that to come straight from god the attribute to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like adam did but tested of his word is over then we take up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world this is the word there that we skipped and come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we have come through that there have been no temptation we'd know all things that's the reason jesus knowed all things because he was the word before he was flesh see if we knowed all things we wouldn't know him then we become the word here we are formed to here we are formed to the word image to be partakers of the word feed on the word being predestinated since the beginning see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can't remember it you joined this church you joined that church and tried this and that nothing satisfied right but one day you just recognized it right so let's listen to brother branham preach it in the next just 10 minutes or so and and we'll we'll move on for this evening but we're going to go back so we can follow it all the way through in continuity so instead of playing it then explaining it or not explaining it i can't explain it it's a revelation just pointing out some things that it meant to me we we did it backwards we went through it first and now we'll listen to it and so we're gonna pick up on paragraph uh i think it's what 50 uh let's let's if we can go let's go to paragraph 53 and we'll just play paragraph 53 through paragraph 80. okay would you like to do that hey man i think it's wonderful this really excites me so all right let's just listen in the world we can do right now thank god before jesus was ever born think of it before jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he came on earth and several thousand years before you come on earth jesus in god's mind died for the sins of the world and the book of life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world that's the bible truth see your name was ordained of god and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you are a part of god when you become a son or a daughter of god just as you are a part of your earthly father that's right you are the male carries the hemoglobin the blood i am on that estonian and the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also so you're all a part of your father glory that that's the denomination not all together amen certainly done god and all the only place notice now his attribute then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us saint john the first chapter and the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where melchizedek is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen and then the word became flesh and dwelt among us hold that there now notice his his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is a state he was in when he met abraham was called mel cassidy he was in the form of theophany i will get to that and prove it in a few minutes the lord willing he was the word a theophany is something that you could not see it could be right here now yet you cannot see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing there's colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to five senses rather and you are only subject to what the site has been limited to see but there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation by television now television does not manufacture a picture a television only channels it in to a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the picture's there to begin with television was here when adam was here television was shared when elijah said on mount carmel television was shared with jesus of nazareth walk the shores of galilee but you're just now discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there it'll be crazy to have said something like it but now it's become a reality amen and so is it that christ is yours the angels of god are here and someday in the great millennium to come it'll be just more real in television or anything else because they are here amen amen he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he amorphous himself into his servants and it proves himself now here he is in the form of spirit and then he comes in the form of uh of immorphod i appeared to abraham in marfan when abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings here come melchizedek talked to him the other day in the tucson paper i was reading an article that where there was a woman driving down the road i believe about 40 50 miles an hour and she hit an old man with an overcoat on she screamed and stopped her car threw him up in the air right out in the plain desert and she run back to find him and he wasn't there so what did she do some people behind her saw it happen saw the old man flap the air in his overcoat turning so they went back to find out they couldn't find the man anywhere they called the police force the police come out to examine the place there's nobody there well each one of them testified the car chugged hit the man he went up in the air and everybody saw it witnesses and two or three carloads of them they've seen it happen come to find out five years ago there was an old man with an overcoat on hit and killed on the same spot when you leave here you're not dead you've got to come back even if you're a sinner and be judged according to the deeds done in the body if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have on waiting in marphat that's the word now god in this stage of it's this stage of his creation later formed into flesh jesus from what from the great beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out in orphan later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want to watch how we have to come also we see him revealed here in ruth and boaz as a kinsman redeemer how he had to come to be flesh now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word formed body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and then morphed body he came in and lived in that in the person of melchizedek then later we never heard the lord melchizedek because he became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet you come like adam like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was the fault at the beginning that proves a predestination of god you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in a thinking first but to see an artist and temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down your flesh to be tempted by sin and that if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me i'll raise him up at the last days see you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute to before the foundation of the world his name's put on the lamb's book of life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting amen we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of it it throws this body in subjection to god hallelujah he that's born of god does not convince you amen cannot sin romans 8 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus they walk not actually after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if i can just quit drinking about this just get in christ it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried and baptism and you are a new creation in christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life like you women claiming you got holy ghost and going out here and wearing sharks and things how could you do it how could the spirit of god in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be sown certainly it can't be he's not a filthy spirit he's a holy spirit and then when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest are quickened hallelujah and when the bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it no question and what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection amen this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and admire and corruption but now it's got the earnest has turned heaven [Music] now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture it's the earnest a sick person laying down nothing left but death that's all can happen i've seen the shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there is no divine healing then there's no resurrection because divine healing is earnest of the resurrection amen you know what the earnest money is don't you it's a down payment he was wounded for our transgressions when the stripes were healed notice how wonderful we loving now this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word death in the flesh will take us there just the same thing think of a little baby you can take a woman no matter how evil she is when she is pregnant and fixing to be mother watch before that baby's born i don't care how cruel the woman is she gets real kind there's something about her sound seems godly you'll see a little mother fix and become mother by the baby why is it that little body now it's not alive yet see the only thing it is is just flesh and muscles that little jumping that's his muscles jerking but when it comes forth from the womb god breathes the breath of life into it and then he screams out see just as sure as there is a natural body being formed there is a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here then when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body that's the reason jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison turn back into that theophany oh marvelous thank god ii corinthians 5 1 if this earthly body beat is dissolved it's earthly tabernacle we have another one see we have bypassed that to come straight from god the attribute to be fleshed to be tempted and trusted by sin like adam did but when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we had to come through that there had been no temptation we'd known all things that's reason jesus knowed all things because he was word before he was flesh then we become the word here we are formed to the word image that'll be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember you join this church and join that church and try this and that nothing satisfying right but one day you just recognized it if if this doesn't get you to go home and listen to this tape i don't know i just don't have anything in me to stir you up but we'll just leave it right there amen do you see that how we didn't get that word body we skipped around it but but he gave us the spirit to be subject to as an earnest it it's a beautiful thing i know there's little things that skip over our lives you know i've been in the message i guess 50 some years i've read this book have it marked up but it's never been as real to me as it is right now and i i don't know if it got any realer what would happen but the the thing that's beautiful is to understand the changing state of god the amorphy he appeared that abraham changed from he was an original before he became flesh and and and you i just can't explain it any better i just keep wanting to explain it but i can't give you revelation you know if i could give you revelation you would all be little davids now tell me that wouldn't be a mess right but if he gives you revelation you'll be little jesus that's what he said amen that's why revelation is so important well i really hope you enjoyed the word today and and uh it's it's it's just wonderful uh what this great revelation is but there's one thing that we know for sure and becomes a really revelation to us that we already have a body prepared for us that body was is in his thinking so as soon as that baby is born right there's a spiritual body that's waiting in his thinking because they came together because of predestination and when this one be dissolved we have one waiting and that's why it's in thought form now but when it we get that thought-form body then it becomes and picks up a glorified body so we move from from a whole different realm it's not the flesh as we know flesh can you imagine having a body with no temptation no limitations walking through walls and walking on water and and yet recognizable and being able to talk and eat and and now my goodness it hasn't even entered into the thoughts in the hearts of men the things that god has prepared for them that love them you know what what a what a stirring of the spirit and let me say this this people reject this message look at what they're rejecting you know everything shows how god had to come down there's only one person god you know we get all mixed up about a lot of things because we're trying to put them together in our mind but we did you see he says we were a part of his life did you hear him say that but we we would have never known that he said because we would just been a part of his life so we try to take it but all the fullness of god was in the whole plan of god the word of god no one being had the fullness of god in them except the amorphy theophany person that became jesus everybody else was a part of the puzzle all the parts of the puzzle come together to make the full picture nobody else pre had the whole thing that knew all things so remember attribute god forms himself into a person that person is the fullness of the godhead then that person takes on a body right not made with hands no father no mother no beginning of days no end takes that body he eats he talks that's that same person then he said you don't hear no more of that person because he became jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily nobody else is the fullness of the godhead bodily because we're all members in particular part of the body the part that was taken out of him in type in adam so now you see the invisible union is that all the pieces and the one be coming together again so the fullness is in him and us together but yet we're still members in particular if all the fullness of god dwelt in brother branham then that would have been two eternal persons and you'd have two gods and there's a lot of people that believe in tunis they believe there's god and jesus but all jesus was was the flesh form right but his body returned back to the word form and that's how he appeared you know he appears down to the rest of the scriptures it's a it's a beautiful thing but it is deity and that's why jesus was deity do you know why he was deity because he wasn't born to flesh his body was deity because god was absolutely the father of his flesh that's why it could be the same person that came to melchizedek because he didn't use mary's seed he created the flesh that he dwelt in so it's the same person the same god formed himself towards a person that person was the what thought of god expressed the word in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was made flesh that same person then so when when we came we came by the way of sin can you hear brother branham say that he said we come the same way adam did and i did so that's where we come it's the difference in the person but the part that we play is we're a part of that person and he types that out so many types about the animals the bucks and the does and the bulls and the cows and the and and and the david and solomon and of many member bride but what one bridegroom it's a beautiful part that we're of and the whole beautiful part about this message it's the revelation of jesus christ the book of revelations is the revelation and that's what's so marvelous is now we can find our place in the plan of god and know who we are and realize how eternally secure we are in his thinking you don't have to worry you know because the very earnest that's right you understand is what makes your body hate sin amen he who loves god hates sin the sins and the temptation of the weakness of our flesh but every time there's something happens or we make a mistake we cry abba father so it's not an idea that you're running around sinning and everything no you hate it you hate it i hate the way that david mcgary is thank god that when this earthly body be dissolved so what where am i at now i'm subject to the word of god i the spirit of god what convicts me of sin and when i'm convicted of sin we quickly repent any man who says he has sinned not is a liar but we have a practitioner right one that already paid the price and now he sends his spirit his spirits can constantly convicting us of sin of unbelief constantly reveal revealing the work constantly correcting us constantly because we're in this great conflict but that's not to make us feel bad that's to make us know that that spark of life is still working in us trying to return home home home oh peace and a spirit didn't he and it seals us until the day of our redemption when one glad morning we'll fly away god bless you let's stand together amen have you enjoyed who is this malteser at we're not halfway through yet so anyway we're having meetings coming up and if there's anybody out there streaming hello out there everybody is invited to the youth meetings if you want to come out and hear brother john minister you're invited what we're going to do is set the front part of the church open for the youth not maybe not as many youth will be able to come this year because of weddings and graduations in covid and those type of things but those that can come and our youth will have we'll give them the front seats and then we can take the back seat and if anybody doesn't think that's fair you can have my seat on the platform or you can or we can put several seats on the platform how would you like to be up there and then all of a sudden the conviction of the holy spirit come on you and you're up there squirming and everybody in the congregation is looking at you you know that'd be good for us wouldn't it but anyway i do want everybody to know you are invited he'll enjoy brother john andes he's a he's a good man he loves the lord he loves god's people um he's got a nice brand of fire in them that is just uh real edifying and uplifting and i think he his desire is that people really know god in the fullness so i think you'll enjoy him i want you to know you're invited so come out billy what time friday night 7 p.m friday night and then saturday night 6 p.m saturday night and sunday a regular sunday service i don't know

this is this is free will right he gave us all our free will so anyway we're going to have a wonderful time um so let's just keep uh pressing the bible and uh let's just remember that the beautiful thing about god amorphy if god's amorphy then we have to be more faith amorphy means to change our mask so if the beginning changes mass then we get a change man aren't you ready to change your mask amen someone came up to me i thought it was it made me feel so good he said man he said you turned 40 years old when you were preaching this morning i don't know 72 to 40 if i get that's what 30 some years right 32 year change if i didn't get deeper in the word i can change another 32 years and i'll almost be the rapturing age right so praise god god's moving church get into god enjoy the word i mean we we had a sinner come right off the street you know i mean god his brother tommy's brother was praying for chris and praying for chris and and then all of a sudden the the spirit puts them under conviction he calls up his brother and says i want to give my heart to the lord i want to change in my life god meant him that's not somebody changing his mind that's god moving look at how many baptisms and and things that are going on don't leave yourself out amen do you know what i mean don't leave yourself out god's moving he's calling you get in there it's for you pray for revelation god
