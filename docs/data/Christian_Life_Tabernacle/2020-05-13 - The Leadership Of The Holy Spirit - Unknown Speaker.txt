understanding be our portion dis evening we ask you to be with us tonight in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated before we go and have a little time of fellowship in the word I'd like to go ahead and just make an announcement or two basically this weekend we're going to arrange our seating in a little different manner to create more seating we're going to put a little bit of space between the pews not quite as much as we have now and we're going to move some seating in the back but you know there comes a time you know as a pastor or a shepherd or whatever terminology that you want to give it you can't you can't watch everybody you can't do everything you know what I mean people make choices and you can give your advice the best that you can but in one regard you're just seeing it through your eyes and through your heart and so but there just comes a time when you you've got to trust the judgment of the people you can't make every decision for everybody you know if somebody would to go out and maybe buy a Dodge pickup you know I might think well that's piece of junk you know what I mean and I can't run over and say don't buy a Dodge don't buy a Dodge because you might say to me you want to buy one of those found on road dead cars you know or fix or repair daily you know so there's so many things that rely in opinion and at and if if you try to govern everybody's life if you try to fix everybody's circumstances it's literally impossible to keep your flesh from entering in to decisions it's just the way we are there's nobody I think that could testify that there are a hundred percent led by the Spirit of the Lord you know can everything that I do the Lord told me to do it I had a man tell me one time he said the Lord told me to go to the meeting in Minnesota I said praise the Lord he said but if I don't get a ride then I'm gonna do this well I'd walk if the Lord told me to go to a meeting in Minnesota but a lot of people aren't really led they feel something and you know one of the great parts of the message of the hour was not to go by sensations and things but so we're going to space the church seating out we're gonna provide as many seats as possible and we're gonna open the church to whoever wants to come it's your choice if you want to come we are keeping everybody apart and then you know I go by and visit some brothers there's four or five families all in there sitting around eating and and they're all together anyway we go out for coffee and we're all closer together and then we come to the house of God and we're all spread out you know and and so I think that there comes a time that it's your judgment so we're taking the restriction off for children under six if you want special distancing then you contact brother Jackson and and we'll make arrangements to give you special distancing there'll be a nice acceptable distancing you'll you'll have some more room in your feet like you have and so we want to do that in let me explain a few reasons why that we're doing this there are one thousand one hundred and seventy nine cases of the covert virus in Tarrant County okay that's how many cases there are there's been one case in Bedford there are two million one hundred and thirty thousand people in Tarrant County the number of people that have this virus is point zero zero zero five amongst that percentage the majority of those people have had underlining health conditions and are elderly and I don't see any elderly people in here deceive me everybody have any good with that okay so so that's what we're gonna do now I don't know who will come back I'm sure people are getting very comfortable being at home I'm sure maybe some have wax cold and have been drawn away but there's others who are just dying to come into the house of the Lord so if you're afraid that you might sit next to somebody then just make you know let somebody know let's follow the guidelines if you're sick don't come to church you have a temperature don't come to church if you've been you know if you've been in contact with an infected person don't come you know what I mean if you are worried about whether you have it or not get tested you know just use common sense but to continually not be able to serve God you know I just I I just remember I just the story just beats in my heart and I can hardly lay down without you know it just echoing through my mind as them scribes and Pharisees and the leaders the political leaders of Israel and Judea at those days telling Peter and the Apostles don't preach in this man's name any more and they had one question what is it better for us to serve God or deserve man and it just comes to a time where it's not my choice to make you understand I will do everything I can to follow the guidelines to provide hand sanitizer you're welcome to wear a mask you're welcome to wear gloves if you you want to you can do I'll take all your personal precautions that you want but you know it just tears my heart to leave people at home service after service with so many empty seats in in the house of the Lord so if you're afraid that there's going to be too many people and you don't want to be a part of them I understand and I can understand your point the rapture is not going to be crowded there gonna be lots and lots of space in the rapture you're not going to be worried about when you're flying through the sky that somebody's going to be too close to you but so we'll just use common sense will do our best we'll provide the safest environment that we can for you what we're going to make arrangement to put more people in the church that then we can and then we'll welcome and then one of these days we'll find out really how many people we really have you know and we'll go we'll go from there so the percentage of people that have this sickness in Carroll County is less than measles less than chickenpox less than mumps less than polio I mean it's just hardly nothing you know I know it's supposedly very contagious but it seems like healthy people are fine so the choice is yours in those that it might be watching tonight I know that we're getting less and less people watching and and that's okay too this is not a comfortable forum for me but anyway so we are certainly happy and then I think tonight is the last service that Lily Thomas axe gonna attend is a Thomas hat she's going to change her name can you imagine that anyway so we're really really happy for her and and and so anyway we're excited about that also in the next next Monday I'm going to have some surgery done on my hand I got I guess it's called Magnum core of corneal plastic such-and-such but anyway they go in here and they cut your thumb and then they take a bone the bone out of your thumb joint and then they go get a tendon out of your arm and then they cut your thing here and they drill a hole and they put a string in there and they well you say how do you know this because I was dumb enough to go watch the surgery online and so I'm gonna be six weeks in a cast and two weeks in bandages and six weeks in a castle I'm gonna try to get back in the pulpit as quick as I can I may not be able to preach the Sunday after the surgery but I'll try to come back just as soon as possible but the brothers have just been doing such a wonderful job that oh no and then maybe I might have somebody to come in and help me have a service or something for us but anyway do you love the Lord amen let's stand together and read a scripture and just a little sign of fellowship so just to remember everything we've done before wash your hands we're gonna leave that the buckets in the back we're not going to pass a plate we are going to be sitting a little closer together and the pews are going to be a little closer together but then we're just welcome whoever really wants to come to the house of the Lord and and it'll be good so you know like I said do all the things that you you've been brainwashed to do over and over and over and over again you know I think that they used to say that if they ever went out into space and found a word it would be I Love Lucy I think now it would be covert 19 anyway so anyway let's turn to Joshua and let's have a little time of fellowship and and I'd like if I could say this as we go forward I'm trusting that that this will be the attitude that we go forward in to make a decision you make a decision and you put the decision back into the hands of the people you believe that they can pray about it you trust them to do what they feel is best for them and you support them in any way that you can but this read in Joshua 3 these are great scriptures in Joshua chapter three one through four and Joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from system and came to Jordan and he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it yet therefore shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubics by measure that's about three thousand feet come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way hither to for our gracious father asks you to bless your word Amen god bless you may be seated a great a great time in the children of Israel's life after coming out of Egypt spending 40 years in the wilderness they were now passing over into the promised land and you know I like what Joshua's was he said now don't get so close to the ark because you know you need to see it you need to be able to follow it you know what I mean you need to and I also believe there was a measure of respect for it emphasized but you haven't been this way before so you need this ark to lead you and it was the Ark of the Covenant and you know we have a covenant every age has a covenant and the Covenant of God is the promises that he makes to you he makes a covenant with you and that covenant is if you believe me I will do this if do you believe me I will do this I will do this I will do this I will do this I will do this he's a God of promise he promises what he did and after all these years of since their unbelief and all the unbelief those that possessed unbelief and had disbelief the Word of God had passed out of the camp I always wonder that maybe even this great time that we're going through maybe it's a time that unbelief will pass out of the camp because the foundation of a church we talked a little bit Sunday about what is it that we're building whatever a man builds he's got to build it on the foundation and gods foundation is faith without faith it's impossible to please God there's nothing you can do that if you don't believe it's the Word of God and you don't believe that God's in it and you don't believe that God's leading you there's no way that that can please God you know we don't offer something to God and ask him to accept it on our terms that was the very problem in the garden in the beginning is that God required a sacrifice in and by revelation Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice but King wanted God to accept his sacrifice he wanted God to accept his offering he wanted God to accept the works of his hands he wanted some acknowledgment in the process and that that's human nature that we want acknowledgement in the process but but God is a God that makes a covenant with man he P tells what what the ground rules are for the Covenant what the what the what the basis on which the things shall be performed and and he says that if any man ask anything of me and my father's name I'll grant it what a promise what you have to believe that you understand and the scripture says that we have not because we ask not and we ask not because we believe not that faith has got to be a foundation by which that we go forward we have to believe in our election we have to believe that the path in which our election is leading us is the will of God in our lives many people have got in places where maybe they were raised in the Word of God maybe it was a family for just something that their family the way they was raised up I was raised up a Catholic so very many of the things I did the way they thought the way that I worshiped and everything was like a culture to me because that's what I was taught to do but there had to come a time where I found the leadership of the Lord we're aware of faith had to take hold not not instructions not obedience not things that's just like a young lady we teach our young ladies to wear dresses and every mother that understands the Word of God and understands morality understands the purpose and why that God made a woman the way that he made a woman and and the sacred vow that comes with womanhood it is going to want to lead her children in in the protection of that and and the end and the care of that and so naturally she's going to teach that child to to wear dresses and to and to live right and to you know why that we let our hair grow long and the things that go with it but yet a child many times will just accept those things of obedience they'll accept it because that their friends are doing it and in church that's where their friends are and maybe there's somebody at school that goes to school with them and that's a bond that they have and none of those things are wrong there that's the way you should do it because the Word of God says if you raise up a child in the way that it should go it will return there too so even in the times of their rebellion you hold fast to the Word of God when they go out the door and you know they're gonna go out the door and do something that's not maybe exactly right you speak the word olórin to them you tell them what the Lord says you tell them what the scripture says you know you remind them in the way that they go because you are got a covenant with God you got a promise with God you you're meeting your side of the Covenant and if you meet your side of AG of covenant God cannot lie because he because he couldn't swear on not whether he's took an oath upon himself that he would keep his word that he keep his promise and if any man ever comes to God and meets God on the same terms then God has to do it the same way every time that's why you hadn't your name had to be put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world because the first son of God came from the thoughts of God the first son of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and if God was ever going to have another son or another daughter he had to come from the same place the same way else God invented a different program God keeps us front of us hey man we've been talking about what are we building so we talked it a little bit and I appreciated the messages the brothers have been bringing about the seed but you know brother Brad never preached a message called the restoration of the bride seed he preached the restoration of the bride tree because that seed was going to grow into what that God planted it to be and we know that he planted us to be a body fitted and joined together and so as these children of Israel were moving in to the promised land now they had the promises but now they had to move into the land that was given for the promises and they just wasn't just a matter of moving in they had to move in and possess the land and that's why he wanted them to keep keep their eyes on the Covenant when you see that covenant go forth when you see that word of God go forth you see the dwelling place of the Lord go for it you follow it you stay in a position where that you can see it and it can lead because it's leading you into the land of promise a land of milk and honey a land up that after that you can have your generations and your children a land that you can worship the father a land that was given to you and given to your father Abraham and it was an inheritance to you can we know through the scriptures that the children of Israel and the mothers of Israel would cry out that their family inheritance over their children they would cry out the promises of God over their children that they were born and we ought to cry out the promises of God over our children too I don't care where they get I don't care who they married where they've been where they've gone they're still ours we still have them we can still claim them but we've got to move into that land of promise hey man I'm tired of the desert I'm tired of the testing I'm tired of the weeding out of the unbeliever because time to get with the people that want to go over it's time for those that are willing to say I'm more than able to keep the promises God's more than able to do what he said he would do I'm gonna believe it I'm gonna look for it I always have little day dreams I many times I Dre dream myself going across that Jordan River up with those Levites and and then I'm sorry I put myself right next to the Ark I I know I was supposed to save meat meters away but anyway I was right there but I thought when I stepped over I started looking for beehives I won look for honey this was the land that had it okay I would look for the promises of God okay and I believe that's what we ought to do when they entered into that land they clay they were told it was a good land it was a rich land it was a good land to plan it was a land with water beautiful land of Canada as they came out of that desert can you imagine how that looked like a little dry dirty old place out there they were glad to enter into the promised land but you know those before them they wanted to go back to Egypt they wanted garlic and leeks and and they wanted to go back they didn't they they lost sight of the promise they lost faith in the promise when it came to the challenge they didn't take the promise I wonder if there's a challenge been laid to us to move out of this doubt out of this fear out of out of this carnal living and go into a land of faith believing in one another trusting and one another praying one for another they meant having the leadership and that's what they have I believe that Ark and Joshua was a type of the Holy Spirit and was a type of a Word of God going before the believer it was a beautiful thing and they had to keep sight on God's Word they had to keep sight on the leader they had to understand who that their leader was because if that came out of sight he said you haven't been this way before if you've got to follow the Ark you've got to follow the priests you got to stay with this because you haven't passed this way before you don't know the way let me tell you something we don't know the way we haven't been this way but God sent us a word one of the last messages the prophet of God preached was leadership he tried to lay it down there that the word was stored up and it was a leader we kept our eyes on it it would lead us into all truth into all righteousness it was it was a given to us as a guide how many messages did we hear about a guide about an absolute about a seer someone that could pull themselves up over the fence and see what's there and then come back and share this is what's ahead this is what's happening how many things in these last five years even have we seen come to pass that were spoken to us every man what a call to the promised land I really believe we're being called to the promised land I believe that that I believe the unbelievers will stay away those who have got a taste of the world and the things of the world and they like the taste thereof they'll just get it oh you say no they know that's what Satan that was what Satan did taste it and you'll see that it's good try it surely you won't die but you'll be a better Christian than you ever been you can be a Christian and still eat you can be a Christian and still do this you can be a Christian and still that you can still believe the message I can stay home you can just do this and do that but that's not what the leader says not what the Spirit of God said it's not what the Word of God says the scripture says as you see the Day approaching forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as you see that Day approaching you know why people don't see it symbol themselves together they don't see the Day approaching but they never recognize the day in its message they never understood that it wasn't brother Branham wasn't telling us to to follow him he was saying if you could see that this is Jesus Christ veiled in my flesh it's whatever he says it's I'm just preaching what he's telling me to preach this is the Word of God he's giving you the Word of God I'm just a vessel he said I know you resent this but I am the voice of God to you he was a shout the Trump it was the Word of God calling out a people my sheep know my voice and another they won't follow it was the gathering together about electing it was those tenets we're hungry and thirsting after righteousness those that had a hunger for the leadership of the Spirit those who knows I haven't been this way before but nowadays everybody wants to figure out the map it's nice to know where you been but it's really good to understand you don't know where you're going you can never determine where you're going by where you've been you've got to have an understanding I've got to know where to go at the fork of the road I've got to know which way to turn at the tee I've got to know which exit to take at the circle who you get to rely on you've got to rely on the ark you've got to rely on the Word of God you've got to have you've got to have some a connection in your heart where that you sit down and you pray and can you know and you're confident and you had that unction of the Holy Spirit and you make your steps based on your the choice that you've seen in the Word of God you say well what if I make a mistake you approach God that way and he'll tell you if you take the permissive will he'll take them permissive will and work it out to His perfect will because he made a covenant with you and if you have a pure heart and you have a pure desire and your desires to serve God sure we'll make mistakes aren't you glad you have a Shepherd I'll guarantee you most of the leadership I've had in my life has been out of mistakes lead me out of this mess leading me out of that mess lead me out of this mistake fixing what I said here fixing what I said there why because he promised I will not leave you nor forsake you but I will lead you and I will guide you so we know that this Great Spirit of God that we understand that it's a time now in our lives that every individual has to be sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit they have to know from whence that God speaks God speaks from his word they have to recognize the spirit in the word I am the way the truth the life he said my words are spirit and truth amen is it's not it's not a leadership without the word you don't get an unction you don't get a move of the Spirit and contrary the word the one lady one time told them our messenger he says she said to him he says that God called me to preach he never argued sister I have no doubt he did I just want you to know it's not according to the Word of God and then how many times have you heard him say the Spirit of God lead you to do something contrary to the Word of God it can't be so because the Spirit of God didn't even come to testify of itself it come to testify of the word What did he say the Holy Spirit would do he said the Holy Spirit would bring you into remembrance of all the things that I have spoken and that's why it you have to have such a great understanding that this message was the message the things that God put on his heart to be spoken the the word that was within the word the love letter that was within the sermons the the revelation that hid in the Gospels to be delivered to the elect that love letter that was him speaking to the heart of his bride that was personal between him and you it can't be organized it can't be figured out it can't be dogma it turned into Dogma it can't be turned into Creed's if we can't form a catechism out of it we can't create our own doctrines and our own way of doing things and and and we are not the interpreters of it he's the interpreter to your heart it's a love affair between you and him it's an ongoing thing every day Paul said I die daily IIIi have I have something in the heart I have a hunger and a thirst for the so we understand that that we haven't been this way before and I believe that we've feasted on the fulfillment of the promises of the past we feasted on the stories we feasted on the testimonies we feasted on the things that that we've seen that God's done well I I feast on the book of Acts still but we've been told that in this age there would be another book of Acts written that there would be testimonies rise up out of the mouths of the believer to give praise to God that he's alive and that he's moving in the midst of his people and he's performing and doing things that they've asked him to do and they're giving him glory and they're testifying about the mighty work of his hand in their lives fresh manna not new man fresh manna from the storehouse there's not going to be an eighth messenger there's not going to be another love letter written there's not going to be another gospel preached let me do we haven't even begin to open the beginning of the riches that are contained in God's word for us let us look at a little bit this evening because I believe it's time that the figs and the trees and the palms and the seeds that they carried out of the desert now the problem into the promised land it's time for those to be planted it's time for those to start flourishing and bringing forth fruit when it when it finally came to the explanation and description of this elect lady there were two great descriptions of her he said one they will you will know that they are my disciples by their love one for another Oh certainly it had to do something about that capstone in the life of a statue of a perfect man it was just it was just this great description and the other description was you'll know them by their fruits and I'd like to talk if I could just a few moments this evening about going forward even at the decision that we've made to go ahead and place coming to church in your hands I'm not going to be the governor anymore the choice is yours my job is to preach the gospel to whosoever will to lay my hands on the sick because their promises that they shall recover if you want your child dedicated I'm here to stand with you shoulder to shoulder as we together and the congregation together dedicates your children to the Lord if there it comes time to be married and it you would so choose then I would officiate over your vows and you would confess your vows and we would lay our hands and we would pray and ask God to bless you as you started your journey in life but there's some choices that people can't make for you I thought it was so beautiful we sang that song I am no longer a slave to fear you say brother McGary could you die yes I never was promised that I wouldn't physically die I was just promised that I wouldn't die you know but I was promised that if I was to die that I have a body waiting for me that I'll meet one day be caught up and those which are alive and remain wouldn't hinder me and that I have a day in the day of coming and a day of promise because so I'd like to just take a moment to talk about the leadership of the Holy Spirit because something is known by its fruits and if a man is known by its fruits even Jesus said if you don't believe me for what that I say look at my fruits look at my works look at what I produce look at what follows me I've seen great men great orders but all they leave behind them as shipwrecks and car wrecks and destroyed lives there there's no prosperity and I don't mean worldly prosperity I mean prosperous in the spirit that following just confusion people aren't at rest they're not happy they're they're always scared I remember I went to help a man one time and and so this man who he asked me to come was out of state to help me do some electrical work on his house and I went and I had to leave and I I remember I kind of miss church that Wednesday night and it wasn't about you know all of a sudden about two or three hours later here comes four or five deacons over wanting to know where I was I mean you don't know where I was I was right here and their whole point you know and I thought you know it's funny admit you want me to go there out of fear to keep your rules instead of it being in my heart I said what kind of fruit is that I kept a rule I kept your rule not even my church not even my pastor now I believe in going to church but if I could say that is the ox in the ditch I started to do something there to help somebody I had to get his house done he was in a bind I flew thousands of miles to help him out had to had to stay right on the job hour after hour after hour and yet the spirit of it is all wrong so let's talk about the leadership of the Holy Spirit if you turn to me in Galatians and we could read starting with the 19th verse or even the 18th birth but if ye be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifested which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lavishness I adultery witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies in these murders drunkenness revellings and such like of which I have told you before as i have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but now listen but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law these are the fruit of the Spirit so if if they're the fruits of the spirit they're what the Spirit brings wherever the spirit goes these go with him there they're always there there's never a leadership without the fruits of the spirit look when the spirit leads and the the spirit moves and the spirit guide and directs the result of his leadership the result of his direction the result of his instruction always bears these fruits there what follows there's what the spirit produces this is what the leadership of the spirit produces it produces love it produces joy if the Spirit of God leads you there will be love and joy and long-suffering and goodness and godliness and faith and meekness and temperance those things there are part of the leadership the Holy Spirit doesn't go anywhere or do anything without these fruits being present it is the fruits the fruit is the product this is what the Holy Spirit produces this is what you can expect it to be in your life when you're led of the Spirit don't tell me you're led of the Spirit and miserable now you may be tempted you may be tested you may be tried we were fellowship with the brothers and and when we listened to that tape last week brother bands that I've been in Tucson three and a half years and I've suffered and he had suffered nobody had called him to preach the full guilt gospel businessman at that time they they they were turning away from brother Branham and they were beginning to follow Katherine Coleman you want to know Katherine Coleman Benny Hinn is Katherine Coleman without a dress on it's the truth it's just all he did he picked her words up he picked her style up he picked everything she did up and he's a reimburse ination of Katherine Coleman and that's where they were turning they were turning to everything that he warned him about everything he stood against everything that suffered everything that he had been through and you felt it in his voice and they didn't accept the seals they had rejected the message they wanted something more spectacular praise God for an elective and praise God that this message is living in flesh not just left on paper not just left on recording but this word is producing a real living people because they've been washed by the water of the word bill seed has come to life and it's begin to put forth branches and it's beginning to bear fruit so anytime the spirit moves these fruits are present and even in brother branham suffering he had a deep peace in his heart that he did what God told him to do any explained I had to come to the desert because Moses went to the desert Paul went to the desert to end if this was the Word of God that I had to come to the desert to now you might look at Tucson now and think it's something but back in the early 60s Tucson was a dump and you've heard the spiritual description that brother Branham gave at Tucson so it doesn't matter what's on the outside God worked from the inside and he promised to give us a peace that surpasses understanding joy unspeakable and full of glory he promised to be a comforter so every time the Spirit of God moves these are what follows these this these are the the things that the believer inherits every time he leads you he only can move with his fruits that his manifestation he's manifested in his fruits if but you know how you feel you know God you might not find out something about somebody maybe something they said something they did I can tell you right away how you know whether it's the Spirit of God or not how does it make you feel towards that person if it makes you bitter and it makes you just to have to despise them or to be disgusted or to say oh I I just can't believe it if it puts a gossip Anya you got to find that one person you can confide in so they can tell the one person they can fight in who the one person they could confide in you know gossips foundation is don't tell nobody I'm only telling you I wouldn't say this to everyone but I can trust you the tongue is an unruly member very hard to hold down you couldn't hold it how do you expect your confidant to hold it it ate you alive how you expecting not to eat somebody else alive but it makes you how you feel what's the fruit of it the problem of godson if you destroy somebody's character that's murder if you destroy their influence if you repeat something that no longer makes that person effective in somebody else's life you have murdered them don't listen I hear a lot of things a lot of things I just blow off I don't want to know but if I hear something that disturbs me I find that person I call him up and I talked to him I said this and this and this is what I heard and when they say well who told you I tell them oh yeah because that's who they need to get the phone call from oh yeah this is brother such-and-such the one you've been running down I've just called you up to let you know I forgive you and I really hope that you can pray through some day and that the love of God will feed your heart just put it back in their ball park how it makes you feel the atmosphere it creates the what comes along with it and when the Spirit of God moves these are the things that come with it he never moves without them he's never manifested in any other way outside his fruits it's by his fruits that you know him so if he says something's a if I'd buy their fruits he can't make another rule even creation every seed will bring forth of its kind in other words you'll know the kind by its fruit you know coffee tree by the bean did you know I didn't even know it was a tree I thought it was a bush but you know them by their fruits so do you understand what I'm trying to say the leadership of the holy spirit the land of promise where he's leading us and what he's leading us to can only produce these fruits that's what the a tree does it's what it produces what does the Holy Spirit produce what comes from the Holy Spirit what is the result of the Holy Spirit what is the result of being in the presence of the Holy Spirit what is the result of hearing from the Holy Spirit what is the result for being led by the Holy Spirit these fruits are what the Holy Spirit brings and the scripture says against such there is no law in other words there's no circumstance no time no circumstance that these fruits are not in play there there's there there is no move that the Spirit makes without them in other words there's nothing that stops it nothing that hinders it no circumstances if the spirits there the fruits are there there's no law governing or stopping or keeping these fruits from being present when God's there there's no restriction or circumstance there's no law that's what a law is a laws a restriction it's it's a confinement to circumstances or procedures you might call it rule the rule of law this is what we do you do this we do that the rule of law but there's no circumstances no procedures no restrictions no barriers these fruits of the spirit go where he goes and there's nothing stops him he moves where he wants to move he blesses who he wants to bless he does what he wants to do he's sovereign God that's a promise I will not lead you comfortless I'll come again I'll be there love will be there joy will be there peace will be there long-suffering gentleness godliness goodness faith meekness temperance they'll all be there there's nothing restriction so there's no law nothing holding back you have the spirit into life you have these they didn't say they were your fruits they were his fruits they're what he produces in your life they're the things that the effect he has on you the things that hold you just think leading us into a land of promise they were promised milk and honey figs and dates and fruits and fields cattle and sheep and abundance were promised joy and rest and comfort and satisfaction they're the fruits there's no law no restriction how do we know when we're being led by the spirit how do we know when he's present by his fruits you will know him by his spirit you will know him the love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit what a place to move in what a thing to build to build a life that's led by this spirit so the atmosphere that surround you is these fruits what it's producing in your life is these fruits what you're shedding is these fruits because first of all it's possession then it's projection the tree comes up and it bears fruit and now the fruit isn't there no more just to be produced it's now there to be projected or shared or eaten or shed abroad and when Jesus came to the fig tree the fig tree no longer fulfilled its purpose he said your ear barren you have no fruit so it withered away because it never went to the stage of projecting it never went to the stage where it came time to eat so we know that that the spirit this is the spirit described the holy spirit you can describe these feet fruits the holy spirit is love joy peace long suffering temperance meekness there's no circumstance that those can't prevail and be alive in our life I want to move forward don't you we haven't been this way before but if I go this way into this new country into this new legal system into this new way of eating and shopping and all this new way that it's going to be new way of sports a new way of this a new way of that and all the way we've never been before I want to go with him I want to go with the fruits of the spirit I want to go with joy and peace and love and long-suffering and temperance I want to go with my candle lit and my light burning god bless you tonight let's stand together if you feel at all tonight that you're lacking the Spirit of God tells us to ask and you say well how do I get this get him he asked he told the people he says don't seek gift seek the giver and there's one thing you can be certain of one thing you can be positive one thing that you can rest on when the spirit is there these fruits are present and when the spirit touches your life the evidence of his touch in your life is these fruits the joy you feel the love you feel the meekness you have the temperance you have the patience you have the long-suffering you have it's a result oh what a wonderful result thank you Lord in your heart tonight I'm not questioning what you believe but has it been a long time since you've felt good fruits of the Spirit in your life and you just like to stop for just a moment whether you're here whether you're watching maybe you're watching later I'll tell you it's not the same but you just like to say Lord I I need contactors I need that I need the result of these in my life I need some peace in my life and he's in joy in my life I need some love in my life I need some long-suffering in my life I need some meekness in my life I need some temperance in my life lord I need your spirit in my life and you promised that when you come you bring these things with you and I asked for it I asked you to help his fatherís as a body of believers we go forward we've never been this way before Lord but we know we want to go by faith but I thought as we talked about how that your messenger went to Tucson he was led he just brought clothes stayed in a little apartment building didn't know what to do he just knew that you told them to be there all on the great result of that leadership was the opening of those great scenes oh we're so grateful father I hope tonight with all my heart that the people take comfort in knowing what the comforter is and that there's nothing no law that stops him from moving bless each one tonight we pray in Jesus precious and wonderful name [Music] I have a bunch of their thinking it's--that's sing this together to return the service to be [Music] [Music] [Music]

land to take that which belong to us that which you have promised Lord because we realized as much the flesh is not gonna help us flesh is not gonna take us there by faith will get us there Lord we're so thankful for your word Lord and we'll keep our eyes on it because that's the guiding principle that you've given us we'll commit everything into your hands father the week to comment father we
