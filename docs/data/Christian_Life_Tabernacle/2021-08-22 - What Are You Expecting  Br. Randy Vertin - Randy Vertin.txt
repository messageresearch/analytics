kind of had this uh song kind of come in my heart here right before kind of during right before i came out here and when i sing that song standing on the promises how many are standing on the promises heaven and earth can pass away but his word will never pass away if there's any place you could stand i'd rather be standing on his word than you could say oh i'd rather be standing in heaven heaven will pass away heavens will pass away he could stand on the strongest rock on the earth that will pass away but his word will never pass away amen standing on the promises [Applause] uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is oh [Applause] perfect [Music] yes [Applause] uh is [Music] um [Music] is oh [Applause] is amen amen he's worthy of our praise amen you know what i like that because we have a we have a double witness of a promise because he said wherever two or three are gathered he would be there in the midst but he also said he inhabits the praises of his people so we have a double confirmation that he's here with us right now amen praise the lord we're standing on the promises of god amen we just appreciate the word of the lord this morning amen how many appreciated the word this morning amen i've it fed my soul amen i was telling brother billy in the back you know he's talking about bringing under conviction everything i say i just think hey it brings me under conviction and then i repent and then it washes me clean you know that's what i love about the lord it's it's the lord he provides everything that you have needed you need go nowhere else if i could say it like this without sounding sacrilegious our lord jesus is a one-stop salvation shop you don't have to go anywhere else the same word that convicts you is the same word that you can bring before the father the promises that he's given underneath that shed blood and it's the same word that'll wash you clean and bring you deeper into his presence so you don't have to fear anything you don't have to worry about anything thank the lord for the conviction the fact that you you know in this age when everybody's numb to sin everywhere they just go around doing whatever they want to do the scripture said in the book of judges it said every man did that which was right in their own eyes and if we're not living in that hour right now where else are we living everybody just does whatever they feel like doing that's their motto if it feels good just go ahead and do it but there's something about a christian that even just seeing those things it burdens you it pricks your heart just to even hear about it or see it by the scripture says it's even a shame just to talk about the things that they do in secret praise the lord for the convicting power of the holy ghost in your life not everybody's got that brothers and sisters sometimes we take it for granted because we get we have this bountiful word that we've received and the storehouses are open to us but we ought to be so humble so thankful so grateful for the holy ghost that can come by your heart and knock at that door and say well you need to open up this area of your life you need to open up this little spot that that was just preached on today you know i know it's not it's not any any minister that would get up here it's not anybody's wish to make anybody feel bad that's not the point but he said he makes his ministers flame a fire what is it sometimes they need that fireball to go in there and just cleanse out the enemy just scour it all clean and you know what's the best sterilizer but fire come through and sterilize all the stuff you know you're rubbing shoulders with the world all week and then you get a couple days out of the week you know even if the services go long you may have nine to ten hours out of the week that you're here in the sanctuary and i think how many hours are there in a week seven times 24 is 168 hours i think something like that 106.00 10 give or take hours out of 168 a week that you're able to be here amongst the believers in a larger group and the rest of the week you got to pick up that sword and shield and you got to go up there and start fighting you know that's why i kind of wanted to sing that kind of more maybe an upbeat song as we're getting into the work because it's a battle we're going into a battle we're going into a scriptural warfare so close jesus said it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but how many elected do we have in here so thereby by definition it can't deceive you because it's not possible so praise the lord for that [Music] amen thank you musicians we're standing on the promises of god let's turn to the book of isaiah chapter 55 already reaching for the water praise the lord for the water isaiah chapter 55 and then from here we will go to philippians chapter 2. isaiah chapter 55 will read verses 6 through 11. i don't know about you but i am earnestly and just i can't even you can't even put it into words but you're just painstakingly yearning for the coming of the lord this world doesn't hold anything for me anymore i'm so tired of it i'm sick of it i'm tired of seeing the things of the world and having that devil trying to constantly push things in your face all the time and all the things that you have to deal with but you know what praise the lord we have a refuge the word of god amen he's a strong tower that the righteous run into and are safe isaiah chapter 55 will read verses 6 through 11 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly part for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh that bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth just think about that just let's read that scripture again for as the verse 10 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not there but watereth the earth and make it that bring forth and bud why that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth man shall not live by bread alone but by every word and whether you realize it or not as the word goes forth as it went forth this morning as it went forth than any other service you've been in that word is watering your ground you don't necessarily feel it that's why i love the prophet he talked it's in an age of pentecostalism where everything's about feelings doesn't matter whether you feel it i praise the lord for the feelings i feel good right now i feel like if we're in the presence of the lord i praise the lord for that but i don't base it on my feelings either it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it amen let's turn over to philippians chapter 2 verse 5. let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus and we'll just stop there let's just put our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we just love you so much lord jesus lord we're just yearning lord we know that you've come in word form in this hour we understand lord by teaching in revelation that you came in the form of the son of man to reveal yourself to your people but lord we're just longing to that time when you come and catch your bride away lord to forever be with to forever be with you lord when we can cast off this mortal coil lord but until that time lord may we just be able to say as our brother paul said i've fought a good fight i've finished the course i've run the race lord we've come once again to our posts of duty lord to serve you lord to hear from you we just pray oh god that you would fulfill your word father when we just read lord that your word will prosper in the thing where unto you sent it may you just be with us this evening lord speak to your people lord get us all out of the way lord that may we you may speak to our hearts lord and may we receive it with gladness and with joy we just love you lord be with all those that are traveling lord we just remember them once again those that are also laboring in the gospel brother matthew and brother david and all those that would maybe desire to be here but couldn't because they may be traveling or something else lord you know the hearts of your people and their needs we just ask you to meet them right where they are lord and as we're here together we just pray that you would meet us now in this place in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated and we'll just turn to one more scripture here as we're seated romans chapter eight didn't want to leave you standing too long i feel like we'll just read this one and start at 8 chapter 8 verse 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god amen how many of you are in expectation how many of you know that the lord right now is working on your heart even at this very moment your very attitude towards the word the very thoughts that you're thinking remember your thoughts even right now are speaking louder in heaven than your actions you may raise your hands and scream and shout at the top of your lungs and those things are great we appreciate it but if it doesn't come from a heart that's surrendered to god said i just be a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol though i could know all mysteries and have not charity what is charity it is the holy ghost any of us who are here on wednesday and certainly enjoyed the the message that our pastor spoke unto us talked about that what how we require that love shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost the only one that can do it i just want to preach a message this evening to give it a title if i could just maybe ask a question of all of us but maybe ask it in a personal way what are you expecting see the scripture says that the creature is an expectation for the manifestation of the sons of god so there is an expectation for something to happen you know expectation is that feeling that something is coming something's coming around the corner there's something just waiting to happen it's it's just just maybe around the next bend or you know there's such an anticipation type of feeling to that of we can feel it even in the atmosphere of believers how we can see the condition of the world around us we can see the conditions of sodom we are well aware of those conditions i don't think it's hidden from any of us to see that that evil seducers are waxing worse and worse that the natural affection has been lost as the scripture said it would we're seeing modern events that are being made clear by prophecy we've we've had a prophet in our day prophesy things and no doubt they we know they thought he was crazy in the day to say oh surely that couldn't be but we know a prophet could see those seed forms of things oh my how we'd say oh the the homosexuality is on the rise and the the women would be skipped down so much that it was just a fig leaf and and they and back in that day they were just seeing little seed forms of it but that prophet could see beyond those things and see exactly the age that we're living in now and no doubt we are seeing exactly those things come to pass and it fills us with an expectation we have an expectation that we know the changing of the bodies around the bend we can feel it if i can say it that way it's deep down in your soul there's just the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him we've heard the cry the midnight cry has gone forth and what are we doing we're in a we're in a time of preparation but the real question i i've really and i say this because a preacher a minister can only minister the things that god is working on in their life you know and that's what i love about the lord he says he chose the foolishness of preaching to save them that are lost because how could a man who's i'm living my own life going about my own everyday affairs i go to work i go home you know my dogs lick me on the face when i get home jump up and i'm happy i live my little life there i eat my food i go to sleep you know i i try listen to the word of god and you try to read and pray as much as you can and those things but my experience is not maybe brother andy's experience my struggles are not necessarily brother billy's struggles or brother banks struggles or anyone else's and yet god would choose to take a man as me a finite individual in flesh sinful flesh and yet he would take pleasure in clothing himself in badger skins as it were oh i love the lord for that he takes these these old nasty badger skins that we gotta wake up with every day that stink and and smell and we gotta wash and and i i sometimes i'm almost i'm almost amazed of how how if you actually even look at our own life's affairs how this flesh is literally embodiment of the law how it's all the washing in the the trimming and the taking care of these little natural laws that we have to take care of we have to feed ourselves naturally and we have to we have to rest naturally and we have to wash ourselves and or will stink and all these different things that they even did in the law and because why the the scripture says there's a law in our flesh that wars against the law of the inside man that wars against the law of this word every single day of our lives but there is an expectation deep inside the believer who has been once quickened to the word of god sealed by the holy ghost made alive in christ jesus that there is an expectation that you can't even put a you can't put a natural finger on but it waits for the manifestation of the sons of god but my question is what are we expecting because i fear that many times our expectations have become carnal in nature because we can read so much of this message we can listen to the words of a prophet we can read the words in the scripture and it's so easy i believe even our our pastor has been taking that message it is the rising of the sun and he brought out that little phrase how they said they'd have their own spiritual theories their own little ideas and and different and what is it it's nothing it's the nature of a man to desire to understand things and even in the spiritual sense it's a good thing because the lord desires to have under us to have understanding but spiritual understanding not necessarily a carnal understanding and i know that in many of the services we've ministered recently i've really been hitting this home but it's just such impressed upon me because the age that we live in see we've been smitten out of laodicea laodicea was spewed out of his mouth he was found on the outside of the door tried to get in we've moved past that age and yet we're still surrounded by that spirit every day of of the desires to understand and to know and to to have all the answers and and it's so easy because we have so much now we've received so much from god in this hour we don't even truly understand the scope of it i believe paul said he says to understand what is the height and the depth and the breadth and the width of the the love of god that he's got for us and and this message came a supernatural vindicated word that started to unveil these things to us seven seals were broken and now we can behold god face to face the scripture being made a new book and it's our desire to understand these things and to know but what are we has our expectation turned to something more natural more carnal or are we truly have we received the mind of christ to be able to go into whatever move he would have according to his word because the scripture says isaiah we read it in isaiah 55 he says my thoughts are not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways for as the heavens are above you so are my thoughts above your thoughts and my ways aren't your ways and so many times we wrestle in our lives and this is where the devil seems to try to pin us down because he tries to pin you down in a carnal understanding of your circumstances of your situation when what god desires out of us in this hour is a complete surrender of our understanding of our own wills of our own desires every little bit of it has to die every little bit there won't be one speck of randall verton's nature on that other side there won't be because god won't share his glory with anybody his nature cannot coexist with a carnal nature it is impossible it says that the carnal mind is enmity with god hatred that same hatred that goes all the way back to the garden of eden it's the same hatred that exists now between the soul and this flesh and so what i find this i'm just giving you i try i've told you this many times i try to be transparent about about myself because i don't have anything to hide there's no reason to do it anyway because god knows all anyhow now i'm not going to come up here and treat it like a confessional and confess all of our sins but the scripture says confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other you know when so many times if we had divine love in our hearts that would be happening a lot more and there'd be a lot more freedom and liberty in christ because we'd find that if we had that divine love in our hearts to what does he say love covers a thing love covers over the thing and i so appreciated our pastor talking about the the gossip spirit and all the other things that go on because i i i was listening to a message i'll read some quotes in there a little bit the lord led it on my heart to listen to that message proving his word in 1965 and brother branham brings out a quote in there about that that just really struck me but we find that i found at least that for so long the lord had started to really change my expectations he started to change even more than it ever had been my way of thinking and he started to to impress upon me things in the scripture of how easy it is for people that might even mean well to get let off by their own carnal theologies they're caught they're they're scriptural theories they're little ideas that move on this way in that way and and it strays from the simplicity in christ so simple that it'll go right over the top i'll just give you a just give you an idea of what i'm talking about you know when i first when the lord first revealed this message to me going on 20 years ago we would just have these discussions you know we talk about oh we're going to see you know brother brahm talks about missing limbs will be restored and and these things are going to and i believe every bit of that but see my carnal mind starts going off and thinking i remember singing that song i'll run through a tube i'll leap over a wall and i'm starting to think what happens i feel like maybe we've almost gotten into a way without even noticing it that that pentecostalistic i grew up in pentecostalism so i know how the thought processes are it tur it literally turns into a hollywood affair because that's what they turned into it's all theatrics and what does it do it starts to turn the things of god into a carnal impersonation that our prophet warned us about and so what did my mind do and even until even until just recently maybe i didn't fully necessarily believe this but my mind would start to you start your imagination start to take over and you're just imagining running through walls and and and just jumping over literally doing those things but i still the lord started to bring scriptures to my mind and i started to think about isaiah chapter 40. and it says he says let's turn to isaiah chapter 40. let's turn to isaiah chapter 40. and i'll show you what we're talking about with man's ideas in our ability to take the things of god and come out it's like a game of telephone you ever play the game of telephone where you get around in a big circle and one person starts with the phrase and by the time you get to the end you see if the phrase matches up and it's completely different from what you started out with that's what happens when man tries to deliver their own ideas because it starts out god delivers an idea to to to man through a prophet through his word and then by the twisting of man's ideas that's why brother branham and the the the lord hates denominations so much because it takes the things the pure things of god and it cankers it and it twists it and it contorts it and perverts it until it comes out looking like a catholic church that has nothing to do with the things of god and our prophet would call the greatest form of spiritualism that there is literal devil worship and the people don't know it and it will it is the mark of the beast to join up with such and yet they would believe that they're doing god a service by following that and will absolutely look you square in the eye and tell you that you're going to hell that that i could kill you if you don't convert to our beliefs and they're going to do it and are doing it now and it started he said he did run well that's why brother branham could say honestly and i don't think he was just joking he said i'm an original catholic i'm one that believed the word of god as the day of pentecost repented me baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost not the ugly perversion that came later on but remember that nicholated spirit is not dead and it's not dead in the message and i'm not talking about the actual message because we know the message the word of god we call it the message but it is the word of god it is jesus christ revealed it is jesus christ revealed in this hour we call we give it a title just another title the message but when i say the message i mean the umbrella of it those that would be hangers on and those that would say well i believe the prophet if you believe the prophet you'd put nothing before jesus christ you'd put nothing before the word of god it's just the truth because the spirit of nicolaitanism that spirit that would com remember what liquor latinism is conquer the laity that's conquering the church remember it's got to go back to being so subtle because remember it started out as just the deeds of the nicolaitans just a little bit those little foxes that spoiled the vine and paul would say even before he left the scene he spent the spirit of antichrist which now worketh not which will but which not worketh in the children of disobedience that's why as we heard our brother talk about this morning about how we've got to come to a place where the holy ghost is so apparent in the church it's so apparent in our lives not just our lives but in the body that sin can get called out at the door that we can see the two spirits in the framework of the church why because he said in the church facebook that is what would make us become an invincible army he said if we can recognize the spirit in what and by god's spirit withstand that spirit i believe in our lives many times we recognize but we don't always withstand because we get tired we get weary be not weary in well-doing it's hard why the scripture says the scripture says that the devil would wear out the saints wear them out if there's not a day of wearing out i don't know what other day it could be from the time you wake up we were talking about it in the back brother billy how from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed name a time or a place or a season or an era that has ever surrounded people with filth as this day no matter where you go your cell phone's throwing ads at you the tvs you may not even own a tv but if you go into a store the tvs are screaming at you they got 50 of them on the wall everywhere you go evil music is playing everywhere you go evil is being spoke of people are dressing immorally people are acting immorally people just look evil when has it ever been just that from the time you wake up oppressive demonic forces are on top of you and we're going to get to that in a second isaiah chapter 40. isaiah chapter 40 starting at verse 3 he says the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted every mountain and hell shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough place is made plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord had spoken it that sounds like a great event who would have thought that that would have been a scrubby scruffy gross looking man wandered out of the wilderness stop at his feet clothed with skins eating locust and wild honey pointing his finger in the face of the leader of the time and said it's not lawful for you to have her see carnal minds would think what brother branagh taught oh he's going to come down from heaven he's going to make himself known to a priest and say i'm here to announce the messiah when you read that where does your carnal mind go every valley shall be exalted think the carnal mind where that takes that every mountain and hill shall be made low i mean i'm thinking seismic activity it was on a spiritual level we're talking spiritual shaking brothers and sisters he said this time i shake not earth only but the heavens oh my see if we could get in his mind if we could pick up that channel you won't miss it then but if you're busy thinking carnally you're going to be just like those pharisees oh but i thought every hill would be would be made low yeah you were the hill and you're getting made low right now glory to god praise the lord humble yourself and you shall be exalted in due time that's always the time element that gets us brothers and sisters it's easy to take it if it's right now but when i was a child i thought as a child i speak as a child i acted as a child what is a child i don't have children yet but they're coming i'm standing on the promises of god they're coming but what was it what was the child what does a child do i know because i was one and i get to see him i have eyes to see and ears to hear what do they do oh i want this mama goes bottle right when they're a baby you're a baby oh i want this and if you don't get it you're a baby lord i really need this in my life ten seconds later lord you've forsaken me you're a baby still you're thinking as a child i and i made this point i was up in ohio last weekend ministering and i made this point i said i and i and this at least this is true for me i don't know if it's true for everybody but i remember when the lord saved me filled me with the holy ghost and i'm babe in christ and everything's fresh and new it just felt like i was just floating maybe like six months a year maybe maybe even longer for some of you you're just floating it's like everywhere you look it's like lord can i have this and boom it's there lord could you do this for me boo if it's there what's he doing he's he's babying you because you're a baby you're a babe you need that you need that thing oh lord help me i need that he just he comes down and comforts you his presence is right there but then when you became a man it's time to put away childish things brothers and sisters the lord lord you say lord i need this out of my life and the lord says pick up your sword and go to work what are you waiting on me for why christ thou and to me speak and go forward and we're we are maturing brothers and sisters some of you may in here baby babe still and that's fine but we ain't raising hot house plants those little sprays and those those wonderful people to come around and get all the bugs off you ain't going to be there forever because you're going to be put to the test god wants to see if you're going to be a faithful child he wants to see if he can put the keys of the kingdom in your hands and that you sign your name on the check but he can't do it if you don't have the character that he requires he's looking for soldiers he's looking for ones that can endure hardness it says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard it didn't say if the enemy comes in it said when the enemy comes in like a flood and he's coming every single day those waves are beaten against you like the ocean on the seashore trying to erode your faith every single day that you wake up 200 000 000 demons in this hour and to deluvian devils those are pre-flood for those of you that don't know the fancy language stuff and i barely know it either pre-flood devils those are the devils that as it was in the days of noah and they have been released in this hour and they are got their sights trained on you brothers and sisters so i want you to think about what are you expecting see we say well i'm going to run through a troop i leap over a wall you know you're doing it right now every day you serve jesus christ in this hour you don't even realize at the time you wake up and you settle in your heart because that holy ghost is beating jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus every single morning you wake up and it's the first thing on your mind say lord help me help me serve you today do you have any idea how valuable that is do you have any idea that as soon as you wake up oh yeah you're running through a troop all right there's a troop of devil standing outside your door right next to your bed for you to run through from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed there are walls set up all around you to try to block you i'm talking spiritual walls we got to get out of the carnal mind the world's all caught up and they're all superheroes and super this and super that see but we've gone beyond the natural that's why the world will miss it all he said that'll be the third poll he said and you won't tell anybody about it he said it won't be an open show it won't be an open show and we've got these visions i know i did for the longest time i had these visions of just running around and people trying to kill me and but i can run right through a wall because my body change is coming and you know i believe those things will happen too because it's scriptural jesus the scripture says jesus walked right through the crowd that was trying to kill him and they couldn't even find him you tell me that's not supernatural scripture says he walked right through the wall and he was in the supernatural room believe in those things but we don't just settle on carnal things we're looking for spiritual victories we're looking for a spiritual uplifting to because i don't care whether what the devil has tried to tell you but this flesh will never be converted it must be cast off at the body change that's the type we have the tabernacle in the wilderness that ark of god the shekinah glory the holy ghost dwelt in tabernacles or badger skins that is us right now the holy ghost in you dwelling in badger skin it's nasty it's wicked it's evil it's it's angry ever seen a badger they're not happy animals they got attitudes they like to fight they're wicked mean little things that is what you are clothed in that is what god chose to dwell in right now and what are we doing because we're pilgrims and strangers just like israel was all that time and we've entered into the promised land now and that tabernacle is still going on but we're fighting the enemy we're possessing the gates of the enemy we're taking it step by step because footsteps our possession we're putting our foot on the neck of the enemy and we're taking it over little by little and one of these days just like the natural son of david solomon had said he had rest round about him so what could he do he could build a temple unto his god and what did they say each of those stones were hewn in the place where they were found and when they came together there wasn't a sound of the tool in the building of the temple so shall it be at the coming of the lord when this bride comes together in the twinkling of an eye it'll come together the temple of god the body of god will come together into an instant without the sound of a tool like a thief in the night it'll poof it'll be put together and you won't even know it the world won't know nothing about it but you know what's going to happen then just like solomon like our son of david we're going to have rest on every side glory to god we're going to be sitting at the wedding the wedding supper ready for a thousand year honeymoon with him but what are you expecting i'm not expecting a better ease on this side we got to draw the sword our brother mentioned it this morning we've got to die more to ourselves that death to self is where we're at in this hour because it was the last thing that has to be conquered it's the last thing that christ conquered in gethsemane he had to die to his own desires he had lord i would that this cup passed from me you know brother branham said that the spirit of god left him in the garden and he was left there a man when he conquered his own will as a man you know what else he did he conquered my will he conquered your will he conquered all your desires but here's the thing we've got to be honest with ourselves and say lord there are things in me that i know are still there that i don't want to be there call them out shine the light of the word of that devil oh he's a slippery little cockroach that devil they know that as soon as the preacher comes and sheds that gospel light out of he tries to skin her away and he'll skin her away for a season maybe in the service you'll feel oh lord i'm free but he's still out there lurking somewhere there's a little desire that's why was it i can't remember the names you forgive me for not knowing all the stories verbatim but i remember remember the sister that was kind of crazy or she thought she was crazy and brother brandon said let's pray prayed with her and she said oh i feel a little bit better and brother and say no that's not it yet that's not it we got to go a little deeper we got to dig a little deeper this had prayed with her again oh i feel okay no no but then she got down and she started praying she said there's there's a soul travail there is a crying out from someplace that's deeper than your mind there's a crying out then someplace deeper from the superficial flesh that says well if i can because you don't understand it you may not completely understand it naturally i don't either but there are two different people that are with you right now there is one on the inside of the inside the seed of god that has been quickened by this gospel that there's no matter what you say lord my only heart's desire is to fulfill your word perfectly every bit of that inside man is desiring to because it can't do it it is the word of god and the word of god can only fulfill the word of god its desire is to do that but yet there's another man this man he happens to be physically larger than the little that we call the little inside man that's here but spiritually speaking brother if you could what was the what was the parable even brother branham allowed the native american man to share with us he said i find i have two dogs fighting within me he says i have a white dog and a black dog he said which one wins said the one i feed the most when the reason we're not winning is because we're not feeding the reason we're not winning is because we're not feeding he said as the word goes for as the water comes down from heaven water at the ground so will my word be that goes forth so you have to stay under that word you've got to stay under it you know the lord and forgive me if this seems for many of you this may be a revelation you received a long time ago well this just happened to me and i praised the lord for it in the last week i said lord you know the scripture says that every man's given a measure of faith and i say lord i feel like my measure of faith is so small though how many of you ever felt like that lord why does it always feel like my measure of faith is smaller than everybody else's it's what the devil does he's there to whisper i'm just i'm just calling him out i don't i'm not scared of the devil we've got to call them out because we fight these things we're we're mortals and yet we're immortal we are eternal clothed by finite flesh and so there's that that they call it i think in science they what do they call it like uh uh uh it's a dichotomy or whatever they call it there it's a it's a cognitive dissonance where where there's two separate ideas that are warring at the same time in the same space you know you say lord i know that i've been called i know that you've chosen me and yet i see this thing happening over and over and over again but you've got to water that seed i said lord why does it always seem like i had the smallest faith and then the lord just quickened something to me recently and forgive me if it seems like this is elementary to you but the depth of it went so far deeper than i had ever heard the lord just spoke to me and said but faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god so if you need faith then all then you need to hear how have you do you lack faith do you feel like you lack faith then let's do some more hearing because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god so if you find your lacking faith well maybe you need to hear a little bit more maybe you need to surround yourself saturate yourself with it just like the old testament said they bounded his front lit with their eyes put it upon their wrists upon their garments they wrote it on their doors and their posts and everywhere everywhere you look should be jesus everywhere you look should be word this word here word there you say i don't care you know what i don't care if you got to put it on while you're sleeping together subliminally saturate yourself with this word you say oh brother you're talking works yes i'm talking works because he said you show me you're faithful that works i'll show you my faith by my works i don't work to get to the kingdom of heaven jesus christ did that for me already but i'm working so that i can fulfill the part he's got for me he didn't call us to sit on the sidelines he didn't call you just to sit there as a lump on the lawn you've got work to do that only you can fulfill that's that nicholaten spirit again brother brother billy just hit on it a little bit this morning it's not on the preacher i'd say that's actually the littlest part of it how can a man preach except there'd be someone to preach to if there's no pull for the word if there's no need see if god will supply your needs not your wants he promised to supply every need so many times we get the two confused my i want my i need my wants well no you don't we we run into that a lot what is that that's that old child nature trying to take over now we need to have faith as children but we have need to have maturity as soldiers that could just pull out the sword and go to fighting but think about that carnal mind and how it how it twists the things of god to come up with something totally different to the point to where john the baptist came pharisees sadducees the most learned men i know i've mentioned this before but they said history says they could rule the scrolls put a pin in there and tell you what letter it hit that's how well they knew their scrolls they could they could quote the entire old testament and you think about the old testament this is kind of a example here but old testament verse new testament that's all the old testament they could recite it verbatim they were so good it shows it's not about knowledge because they knew the word but they didn't know the word you understand what i'm saying they knew the word but they didn't know the word and you have to know him just like what did we hear this morning i have so appreciated because brother billy started hitting on a couple of those little things five minutes in the presence of god and it made obsolete 80 years of moses's learning in five minutes and not only that not only did it make it obsolete but it superseded it to the point where everything he had desired see moses had gotten caught in that same thing what was moses expecting see his expectation the end goal was the right goal he's been called to be a deliverer he had an expectation but what what was the what was the problem his carnal interpretation of that expectation caused him to get him nothing but a dead egyptian a bunch of shame and fleeing from the presence of god how many of you have been there the lord puts it on your heart i've got something for you and because the scripture says where to say whether it be ministering weight on your ministry wait for the lord to give you the unction for the move don't try to come up with it on your own wait for him to put it and open the door for you to do it and give you the right place to do it and the right motive and the right objective in the right season remember all these things had to line up our prophet put it into place for us it's not just a david oh nate nathan said do whatever's in your heart david and the lord had to come and correct that prophet if he had to correct a prophet how much for us who've just received the word of a prophet and here we are trying to interpret what he said we try to interpret what brother branham said we try to take what he said and dissect it and come up with carnal expectations for it like i said about tent ministries and all these different little doctrines that come out of it and all these other things that people try to come up with i don't want to know anything else but christ and him crucified because i know if i try to put my own see god will interpret it when he brings it to pass and as long as i and i'm just speaking personally but apply it to yourself as long as we are in the right channel and in in the holy ghost in the right spirit to receive at the time then we'll go right along with it when he comes but if we're all off over here working on our own ideas in our own interpretations and the lord's working over there how many people read that scripture isaiah chapter 40. voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the path of the lord make a highway for our god knew that that was talking about the coming messiah and yet completely missed the fulfillment of that scripture you know jesus was on the scene the very god of heaven the messiah himself the fulfillment of all scripture the fulfillment of all of that the very word himself and not only did hardly anybody know he was there an even tinier percentage could actually believe it and even think about this think about where we're at because if we be in that type of receiving a messenger before the coming of the lord how many received the messenger but failed to go on with jesus and didn't even know well what about when they found disciples of john we not even heard about a holy ghost well what baptized baptism were you baptized with the baptism of john so if that be the case how privileged are we and where are we to be to say lord give us your mind lord give us your heart to receive what you've got for us let us not get off to this side or that i said but just remain steady right in the middle of the road right down the center lord i'm not gonna i'm not gonna just join in with this or join with that i'm going to stick with that word i'm going to stick with what we've received in this hour i'm not going to try to interpret it because i don't know anything anyway but lord you reveal it to me as i have need of it and i will receive and lord give me grace that when you do reveal it i can just jump right in with both feet and say lord be unto me according to thy word but how easy is it to get off that path it's very easy i got a couple quotes just to quote here and in proving his word see it's just about see god didn't call us to bring the word to pass he just want us to believe it because i don't have the power to bring it past anyway i want all this work to come to pass and i know it will if if my own natural desires i'd be out of this body right now i'd be bringing thessalonians to pass right now how many would say amen to that let's get out of this body but see it's not time yet the season's not here it's not up to me it's up to me to believe it and be in the spiritual condition that when he comes to fulfill it i can receive it that when he comes and says come up hither i'm i'm hearing the voice i'm not just listening to the to the to the whirlwind i'm not just listening to this but i can hear the still smallest voices come up here but he says in proving proving his word he says also we'll take another just for just a moment abraham was another prophet of the lord that the word came to and told him when he was 75 years old and sarah 65 years old that he was going to have a child by sarah now that was quite a shock to an unbeliever could you imagine today such a thing happening even in this day with all of our scientific achievements and all these test tube babies they talk about and so forth but this old woman now of 65 years old and an old man of 75 years old but the word of the lord came to abraham and told him that this was going to happen and abraham believed god now no matter how much god spoke and how true it was abraham had to believe what god said to make it so now look how that man was tested with his testimony that he did believe so you say you believe we'll be ready to put to the test be ready god's going to try you he's going to try what did he say about israel he said i put them in the wilderness to try your hearts to show and it wasn't see god already knows he knew what was in them god knows all we act as if that that like brother billy said it perfectly this morning so many times we do when he was reading some of the quotes of brother branham he said we'd act certain ways because we don't really believe that he's there with us certain times when we think oh well we'll just do this it's because we're not what do you say he said it's the presence of god that's going unrecognized and if we recognize that everywhere we go he's with us you got the holy ghost he's with you he is with you whithersoever thou goest but are we aware of his presence are we cognizant of his presence or is it just okay well we'll do whatever but you have to believe that he says now look how that man was tested with his testimony that he did believe that same man that made that confession that he believed god he's a person like you are sitting here tonight we still believe god we got to believe his word is the truth and he'll prove it that it's the truth if we'll just believe it now how simple is that so simple you say i just take things like healing we have people that need healing in our midst we have people that are in desperate need of healing he's already healed you do you believe it you say amen then you stand still and you confess that until he brings it to pass because he will prove it to be true because it's his word his word said so it's not a question of anything else you say well i have this and that in my life and i've i fell here and i sit here put it beneath the blood cast into the sea of forgetfulness make it right and move forward with god that's as simple as it is brothers and sisters but then we put god on a timeline and say well lord it didn't happen yet why not he's not obligated to tell you that he just said it would happen didn't say when didn't say how didn't say who didn't say where well we'd say oh lord there's that carnal expectation again oh lord i need this healing or i need this in my life and you've already planned it down in your head how god will perform it right there you missed it because you're off on this path and the lord's sitting right over here saying i could meet your need over here if you just wait on me i'll give you a testimony i was over in ohio ministering and i was talking to to a brother there and he witnessed to me how the devil had been fighting him and it happened a couple times and recently again the devil had been giving him dizzy spells and he kind of he could kind of tell the devil was trying to attack him with like a diabetes spirit he never had a problem in his life never had an issue with this at all and he said the lord put on his heart he said i'm going to give that back box of snakes right back to the devil and he spoke and he said i'd refuse this and it went away and then he said recently within the last few months he was with a person and and he saw that a person that was that had that had that problem diabetes and he saw him you know have to inject themselves with the insulin and he said immediately like he almost felt something come on that devil trying to attack him again see that devil's gonna keep trying to attack he we think oh we just fought him off once he's gone for good no he's gonna come back he's going to try to attack you when you're least expecting it when your guard's down and what happened he said he had to he said he said no i refused that and he had to speak against that devil for like three days straight he said he woke up and he was dizzy and he felt all woozy and everything that devil trying to put a a demon on him with diabetes and he said the lord just put it on his heart he said i'm going to speak against that devil i'm going to give that box of snakes right back to him i refuse to accept it and he spoke that and he confessed that and the god brought it to pass because it didn't have a problem now i'll tell you this the reason i say that is because the devil been fighting me over the last month and a half with headaches like constant headaches from the time i wake up to the time i go to bed i've never struggled with that in my life never had a problem with headaches my dad had him all my life but i never had any problems by the grace of god and then the last few months i'd had this constant headache that wasn't like a migraine by the grace of the lord but it was always present from the time i woke up to the time i go to bed i get a little relief here and there and i would just you know how the devil is oh you're definitely dead you know you're dead you probably got two months to live they didn't catch it in time you're gone you know how the devil is and i and i'm ashamed to admit you know you entertain those thoughts for even more than a second and the devil's gotta latch on to you right and that i tell but i'd say this to to give glory to the lord jesus because this is how powerful your testimony is i heard that brother's testimony i didn't even tell him about what i was struggling with but it it stirred something up in me and i was like you know what devil i'm tired of this i ain't gonna settle for this i'm a i am a spoken word son of god and so from that night forward i just started to speak i said devil i refuse this thing i don't i don't care if you're because you know the devil's putting all these oh it could be high blood pressure it could be this it could be that it could be whatever and this that and the other i said devil i refuse high blood pressure i refuse whatever else you're trying to give me i refuse these headaches in the name of the lord jesus christ and i went to bed that night woke up the next morning and it had subsided a little bit and i said devil i ain't satisfied you get completely out of here and i've been speaking against it ever since and by the grace of god i haven't had any hardly of the issues and not only that he's completely delivered he's a complete deliverer and that devil tries to come back on me every once in a while and i say no devil i have not received return to sender because it ain't mine to begin with i don't accept it and the problems we come into many times because we we just sit back and say well this is just this is my burden to bear this is what i have to deal with it's time we started exercising those faith muscles i'm not saying just go around you know go around and just start speaking to everybody but the lord's got to put it on your heart to do this that was my testimony maybe it'll encourage one of you i don't know but this is why our testimonies are powerful because this is what this is faith it's building faith when you hear a testimony of her brother or sister how the lord delivered them from something someone takes heart and said that's me if he could do it for that person what about me and that's that's what we're here for brother not a carnal expectation of oh we're just going to do this and i just have to do this and i have to do that no we're beyond that we're beyond carnal ideas but we've got to get out of our own minds about it our own ideas have to die our own thoughts have to die our own expectations have to die lord give me your thoughts give me your ideas give me your expectations lord however you want to perform your word let me be ready to receive it let me be ready so that i can be a minister of that word in whatever portion you would have me to minister he says now look at the hindrance that abraham had first thing was his age 75 years old and sarah being 65. she was way past the change of life the menopause no doubt but what it stopped many years before could you imagine that not only did the lord give this promise but he gave the promise after all hopes was already lost it's one thing if you know things seem to be going you know you're maybe struggling but you kind of feel like you have a fighting chance and the lord says take heart but see that's why the lord does it he loves the paradox he loves to to get glory out of this situation because in weakness he's made strong when i am weak then he is strong remember when we talked about being mature christians remember what paul said he said i had this thorn in the flesh he said i prayed three times for the lord to take it away and he said not so he said my grace is sufficient for thee wives he said for my strength is made perfect in weakness now a baby christian would have said well god why would you do that well i deserve it you said i'm healed and this and that he said my grace is sufficient for thee but what did paul say he was a mature soldier he said therefore he said i will glory in my infirmities that the power of god may rest upon me i'm not saying that and i don't let the devil use that to say well i just have to live with whatever the devil's trying to give me or whatever i'm fighting with that's not so but we have to understand there's a balance to be struck here between that instant gratification of lord i prayed for it why isn't it done yet and the time sometimes the lord will say no it's just it's just a fact let us be in the place where we can receive that as mature people mature christians soldiers he says no doubt what it's not many years before he had lived with her as a wife it was his half-sister and had probably taken her when she was just a girl in her teens and had married her and he had had no children she was absolutely barren and now we find that to do this he had to separate himself from all the peoples who did not believe it in order to make it come to pass see that's what the lord's waiting for separating ourselves from all unbelief now i want you to hear what he says because this is where i was just so i actually looked it up in the message before a service today you know in the message search and i was just wondering how many times did brother branham because if you were here on wednesday and we're just blessed by what our pastor preached and he kind of mentioned that gossip type of thing and never you don't hear that really preached on much and i wonder how much brother branham even mentioned it he only mentioned it that word gospel only showed up 13 times in the message and i just happened to listen to proving his word and one of those times is right here is the last time but i love the way it just encouraged me because i say lord maybe i'm just in that channel you know i'm right it's just little things i take heart how many of you take heart in those little things who has despised the day of small things those little bread crumbs that he leaves for us it's like ruth out in the field those handfuls of purpose just to know like you're on the right trail just keep pressing just keep going i say thank you lord for letting me see these things but he's talking about abraham and separating yourself from this unbelief and he says i don't mean to say that you have to separate yourself from peoples but you have to separate yourself from all the gossip of unbelief and stay away from that when people says oh those things don't happen that's a bunch of lunatic people there is no such a thing as that happening just close up your ears and walk away don't pay any attention to it and that's where we get it's if we let it catch our ear he's got us right there but we we look don't look to the left or to the right don't look to one side or the other you've got to be completely dead what did we hear this morning a dead man doesn't react a dead man can't do anything of himself i want to be dead i want i want this body to be dead wrecking myself dead but alive to christ so that he can live through me amen now we're just going to skip down a little bit so down here in paragraph 86 he says if his children will only take his word so he can i want you to listen to this if his children will only take his word so he can prove it by you that struck me the way he said that because he didn't say prove it to you because we already already have the word proven to us if we say we believe if we say we believe it's already been proven to us but now he wants to prove his word by you in you through you your testimony you're a written epistle you are to be the one that proves that the god of william branham the god of abraham isaac and jacob jehovah of the old testament jesus christ of the new is still alive and well right now your life he wants to prove it by you not just by the preacher not just by the pastor not just by the the musician or this other but every day that you live god is wanting to prove his word by you we shouldn't if we claim we believe if i could say it this way if we claim that we believe how many of you say i believe i believe the word of god well then he's already proven it to you now he wants to prove it by you that's where we got to step off the sidelines that's where what our pastor was preaching a couple months ago about working the works of faith about actually being active in this world not just sitting on the side oh someone else would do that someone else would do this but the book of james says true religion undefiled is this to visit the orphans and the widows when you see someone in need you're there to act you say oh lord what can i do for you he's laid out a lot of things right here that are just so simple but he told the pharisees he said you tried to do these he said you left one thing done you did one thing but you left the others undone how many little things are we leaving undone because oh someone else will do that someone else will do this no he maybe he's called you to do it maybe he's got that for you to fulfill he wants to prove his word by you that's the way that that's the only way he can prove his word he doesn't prove it to unbelievers they can't be proved they're unbelievers but it's not to unbelievers it's not for unbelievers it's to them that believe if he can find someone who will believe his word he will prove his word by you that's that's the difference and i love the way what are the brother billy's did this morning he said how many times do we get in our mind oh i just want to put it to him i just want god to do this so i can just stick it to this person who's been criticizing me that's not the spirit of christ because the spirit of christ was father forgive them they know not what they do laying out the sin the spirit of christ and stephen lord laying out this sin to their charge wasn't the spirit of god seeing so many times i've been there lord i just wish lord if you could just do this thing just to prove these naysayers wrong i'm just being honest elijah did that if i be a man of god send fire from heaven said that was an angry prophet why because he was a man of like passions fighting these battles but let's let the spirit of christ work in us that spirit of love if you can do all these things but not have not charity it profits nothing it's not going to get anywhere it said he wants to prove it by them he said do you remember the blind man jesus found he said he says it's to him to believe and if he could find someone who believe his word he will prove his word by you and sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way that god can prove himself do you remember the blind man that jesus found they said who sinned he or his father his mother he said in this case neither but that the works of god might be made known see they had the same idea right we want to understand why the how the why why did this happen why did he said well you went completely over the top of it it wasn't for any of those reasons it's just so i can prove the word of god to you and prove the word of god to this individual in this moment to prove i am who i am his ways are so past our finding out but that's why we need to we've received the mind of christ let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus see you can't just have it your your own ideas the only way you can have the mind of christ is to have the spirit of christ in you the only way you can do it he said in this case neither but that the works of god might be made known see it happened to that boy so that jesus could be glorified sometimes sickness is not a curse it's a blessing that we can stick our faith out there and call those things which are not as though they were god said so and he'll prove it so if you'll just not weaken under the test oh my oh lord help us you know i think you know i remember just to give another little testimony of my own life i know god proved something to me you know i had been got engaged to sister lindsay and within a week almost had my hand chopped off at my job it was like within a week wasn't it within a week or a couple of of getting engaged to her proposed to her and then i was at work and i don't know if you may have seen my hand with the scar and everything on it but i had a piece of sheet metal on a crane on an overhead crane slide by and guillotine my hand almost chopped my whole hand in half cut it all the way down to the bone it was a thin piece of metal it was probably an eighth less than it's probably an eighth inch thick piece of sheet steel a four by eight sheet on a crane and i walked through an area and the guy i thought he stopped i was going to go to the bathroom i was i worked at the factory and i was getting ready to walk through his area i saw him he saw me he stopped the crane and i was like oh he's going to let me go through as soon as i walked through he started the crane again and i didn't have anywhere to go there's a big stack of stuff behind me and that he stopped the crane but if you know if you ever worked with an overhead crane they have momentum to them the brakes don't stop right away and it stopped came to a stop and it swung right at me and just instinctively i put my hand out and it just banged it against there and chopped it almost in half it chopped my all the way down to the bones chopped all the ligaments all the tendons all the blood vessels everything and you know by the grace of god you know had i tried to duck it might have chopped my head off but the lord just i stuck my hand out there you know and i i say it this because you know that's a test it's just the fact of the matter it's just a test but the lord showed me something you know that that i take heart into myself well in that moment you know a reaction you know my first reaction was i screamed you know i just screamed out loud you know it's an instant reaction but i'll never forget that and this isn't to glorify myself because i know it's only god because a man can't do it in that moment you know you think you'd just be crying out in pain or whatever and i remember my first thing was i cried out in pain just a quick ah you know that kind of a thing because it was a surprise and then i remember the first thing that that came to my mind was do not look at it because it will be worse and i grabbed my hand and i knelt down on the floor and and i i prayed and i remember being excruciating pain like you can't describe you know and without you know i don't want to be graphic about it but i knew it was bad because i could i could feel that this top half of my hand was just flopping around i could feel that in an instant i just grabbed it and i knelt down and i remember praying to the lord i said lord because i i be honest i was fly i saved this way i was flying really high the lord had answered a bunch of my prayers he brought a lot of things to pass in getting engaged to sister lindsay he'd answered prayers and different things that had happened and brought and you know how you're just on a mountaintop and sometimes you know the lord wants to just kind of like job right you were on a job was on a mountaintop he said he said the only satan said the only reason he loves you is because you blessed him so much he's always on the mountaintop you're answering his prayers you blessed him with all the goods and things he said all right we'll try them we'll see what happens and not that i'm job of any or anything i wouldn't put myself in that category but um just to show you that the lord will take those opportunities to test you and i remember getting down on the on the ground and i just knelt there because i had nothing else and the only thing i could think is i prayed to the lord i said lord because you know when i came when i came to the lord to this message in 2002 i just remember that i i i prayed to lord and i still do i but i prayed to the lord one of the first things i pray i said lord when i when you come to a realization of the truth of this message and where we're at at the coming of the lord it sobers you and you start to real when you really have a revelation you start to understand the opportunity that lays before you and what god has opened up to you and how he's chosen you and who you are and you start to realize lord how can people reject this and i remember just praying to the lord i said lord i prayed the lord and i still do i said lord i don't care what it takes what i have to go through don't let me miss it and and i remember getting down on that ground my hand bleeding and just closing my eyes and praying i said lord and i and this is basically this is what i prayed almost verbatim i said lord i said lord i don't know why this is happening because right then i knew you know i play guitar you know i like to play instruments and things and uh all and i'm like you know the first thing is going into your mind the devil's right there oh you're going to lose your hand you're not going to be able to work anymore you're going to be crippled you're not going to do anything the rest of your life all these things are going through your mind now maybe and then you all you're going to get gangrene in the hand or something and they're going to chop off your arm you know you know how the devil works he goes right to the end of the line you know he's right there to take it all the way to the end and and i remember i got down i said lord i said lord i don't know why this is happening i said but lord if this is what it's going to take for me to if this if going through this is part of what it takes for me to make a rapture i said lord just give me the strength to endure that's not a man i know that was god because my natural instinct and and even just as a confession you know there have been times since then that you know i've had pity on myself and you kind of sit on the ass sheep as it were he said lord why did that happen to me you don't maybe necessarily understand everything but i tell you what had it not been had it not been for that i wouldn't be here because it was because of that and some circumstances that happened afterwards that led me to get the job that i had now that led me to leave that job and become an air traffic controller that led me down to get an apartment that was five minutes from this church without even knowing it you know and the thing see the lord does all things well the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord but you know my carnal expectation was not to have my hand almost chopped off but but i tell you what i do know one thing he promised to heal it i've had a dream of it and i know we don't always take stock in dreams and you say oh that but i know he's already healed it because his scripture says that so i take any dream that confirms that as a positive and i've had a dream of it and i know a brother up in ohio that had a dream of a similar thing of me playing guitar again so i know it's coming and for any of you that are that have a that have a healing need in your body god's going to fulfill it because not because of your expectation of it but it's because he said he would that's what he wants from you is to stand that's why that's why i felt led to sing that song at the beginning all he wants is to find someone who's willing to stand on that promise and not move from it no matter what the circumstances lord i don't understand why it hasn't happened yet lord i don't understand why you know sister lindsey and i haven't been able to have a child yet haven't i don't understand it i know there are others that have probably gone through the same thing that have gone through the same thing i don't understand it i don't have to understand it lord you promised it and i will stand here and i will wait until you make the promise come to pass because i didn't give the promise i can't make it come to pass but i know the one who did promise and this and i know that he can't lie and if he can't lie then he will bring it to pass that goes the same for you those those of you who have loved ones that are astray that the lord's given you a promise says i haven't lost one is that i've given you your family it doesn't matter what the circumstances are because god doesn't care about circumstances circumstances don't have anything to do with god's word god's word overcomes the circumstance not the other way around so don't look at the circumstances don't look at your situation god wants someone that can look at the word that can look at that promise and stand there like abraham growing stronger in faith well sarah do you feel any better no well bless god we'll have it anyhow brother randy is your hand healed yet do you feel any different well maybe not yet i got a little pinky that doesn't want to go straight yet and i feel a little tingle in my hand but you know what bless god i'm gonna have it anyhow why because i didn't make the promise but i believe the promise i believe the one that made the promise he's looking for someone that simple let's stop making it complicated brothers and sisters when he says something in his word he means it he means it you say brother you're getting fired up about this yes i am because satan has tried to complicate things so much even even within the word that we've received tried to make it so complicated but brother branham had to come and bookend the seals with god hidden in simplicity and revealed in the same why because he knew that with all this word that would be revealed satan would be right behind it to do what he did in the garden yea hath god said he said but in that day you eat that love you shall be as gods knowing good and evil eve didn't even realize she already was god she was already a god of the earth with her husband already was in that space but the devil's trying to entice her with something supposedly above what god had already given she already was in that position not only that she knew good and evil because to do god's word is good and to not do his word as evil it's that simple but see how the devil just tried to mix it up complicated just a little bit that's where let us have faith as little children but let's have the maturity of grown-ups lord you said it i believe it that settles it it's that simple but we've got to die to ourselves as we stand let's just stand just wanna maybe one little one little other thing i started thinking about this you know god what is our expectation what are you expecting see i expect that god can hear our cry he said my people which are called by my name if they will turn from their wicked wicked ways and seek the lord he said i will answer from heaven we heard brother billy even mention it this morning you know any you know how many of you gone through dry times in your life gone through times just oh lord it feels so dry i feel like maybe even i feel a little dead i just feel i don't have that life isn't is it pulsing the way like lord lord restoring to me the joy of thy salvation you know what i appreciate i appreciate jonah because jonah was dead jesus said as jonah was in the belly of the well three days and nights that was a type of death and even in death jonah had enough in him he said once more well i turn again towards thy holy temple he said because he knew that what did the prophet say he said he knew that there was a prayer that was prayed by solomon he said that if any of your people be anywhere they turn towards this temple and pray hear thou from heaven and he said and he knew that god answered and honored that prayer even in that dead state could i say it that way jonah was dead but god could hear bring him back to life a type of the resurrection i had a brother there was a brother in iowa that preached and i loved the way he said this so much he said he said it took seemingly how god gets glory in these things he said he took seemingly one of the most disobedient acts in the scripture and made it a type of the most obedient act ever done i loved it seemed like he was disobeying so greatly but we understand by a prophet that the lord was ordering all these things but think about that aaron's rod that butted totally dead doesn't matter if you feel dead just get in the presence of god but what's the problem our carnal ideas our carnal expectations lay that aside when when the children of israel came up to the river jordan remember jordan types death death to self that's where you have to die [Music] brother branham said it in here i didn't we didn't read the quote but i could just kind of paraphrase he says he said god looked like a horrible general bringing his people to the river jordan in the springtime when when the banks of the river overflowed death overflowing on every hand that's where we're at right now death on every hand spiritual death but what happened the children of israel said put that ark forward what is the ark that's the world put the word before you and go forward and what did it do death had to part and they could walk over on dry land so if you're looking to find the promises of god in your life you've got to die to yourself we have to be more sincere we need to be more dead to ourselves [Music] if there's nobody else that needs it lord i do i can raise my hand and say lord i need that i need more depth to myself lord from the time i wake up to the time i go to bed let me just bury that old man under the ground let me get rid of him and find your mind lord jesus let me not have any expectation for anything else lord but let me be in your mind [Music] amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father [Music] lord i believe the earnest desire of every one hero god is to see you manifest in their lives lord to see themselves die away o god until only the life of jesus christ remains lord surely we we have our little personalities lord we like maybe different foods in the natural and we like different colors or different things according to that nature oh god but we're not looking at the carnal themes of god we're looking at a spiritual appetite we're looking at a nature oh god that could say as mary did be it unto me according to that word that would lay down ourselves upon the altar as a living sacrifice which is in our which our reasonable service lord we don't want to have any of ourselves anymore of god we don't want our own appetites anymore the appetites of the flesh that try to war against the spirit but lord let us meet the enemy on the battlefield with the word let us draw that sword of the spirit have the shield of faith the whole armor of god lord to go out to battle and put to rest that old man every single day lord jesus lord i believe everyone here lord i know i believe it's hungering for more of you lord if there's a hunger for more of you god there's more of you to be had by your people or we couldn't hunger for more of you except there'll be more of you to have lord jesus we want to be closer to you lord we want to draw closer to you lord we know we can't come into your presence and go from you the same or but we're not going to be like cain or like the pharisees lord that when they left your presence were farther away and just push you away and cast you out but lord we're gonna draw nigh unto you lord lord knowing that the promise that you gave is if we draw an eye unto you you draw an eye unto us lord i just pray for each and every one here that has a physical need oh god may you just grant them the faith to just stand on that promise that they're they're already healed lord lord even your prophet said if jesus christ was here before us right now or if he had a file of his blood and how we how do we cling to it lord and counted a precious thing but lord he couldn't do anything more for us than you've already done lord may you raise our faith to that level lord of acceptation lord to accept what you've done for us lord to stand steadfast lord when that enemy comes in like a flood raise the standard of the spirit lord the standard against it [Music] but we find refuge in your word lord we just dwell underneath the shadow of your wings lord jesus lord we're just desiring [Music] a closer walk with you lord a greater sincerity lord jesus more divine love in our hearts lord the divine love shed our brought in our heart that holy ghost lord just a continual baptism or baptism after baptism lord i just satisfied lord we're just seeing you one time but lord we want to see you again and again lord we want to see you in our lives manifested lord i want to see you and my brothers and sisters lives manifested i want to see lord proving your word by your people lord lord prove your word by me lord prove your word by your children and your pride [Music] lord because we know that that's the final voice to the final age lord we just believe you lord you've already proven it to us lord we've received your word and we believe it lord may that word anchor on us and now may you lord use us to prove your word by us lord may we just be yielded vessels to you now we committed all into your hands lord bless again those that are traveling as they return to us lord may your angels just camp about them may you give them just a blessed assurance and encouragement lord and each one that's here as well father as we go lord as we go from our physical presence as lord but never from your presence oh god may you just abide with us wherever we go lord and we give you the praise and glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen let's just sing that song father of life [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] jesus christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus christ [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] god [Music] jesus christ [Music] [Applause] on your grace [Music] jesus christ how many feel cleaned out and scoured out by the word of god amen i appreciate the lord so much because his promises are yea and amen [Music] there's a quote i remember reading a few months ago that's just really stuck with me about brother branham said he said the christian he said is always positive never negative so you give a positive confession whatever you have need of in your life it's already yours why because the price has been paid see the catholic church that that spirit's still working around we think we have to whip ourselves and and get down and oh lord forgive me and forgive me and forgive me until somehow you think you're gonna work up enough that god will do something for you he's already done it he just wants you to accept it and stay with that confession amen let's just sing that song let's sing that song because it's that time it's manifesting time let's listen love the voice of my beloved [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh

[Music] is [Music] i shall forever lift my knife [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh listen [Music] and how do you explain [Music] and how do you describe a love that goes from peace and runs as deep as it is [Music] and words cannot express the love for you listen to our hearts and hear us [Music] [Music] we will use the know [Applause] [Music] i just want to give a testimony here something that just happened up here because i want to give glory to god and i want you to know that no matter what it looks like to you on the outside to the natural god's working we just had two independent sisters come up here [Music] within a span of a couple minutes and ask prayer because they felt a burden for sister heidi thomas sister laura came up here and then sister kelly came up right afterward they didn't they couldn't have known that and then i witnessed a sister laura and sister kelly during first service this morning i sat behind sister heidi and brother brother matt and i felt such a burden this morning on my heart for sister heidi knowing what she's going through can't explain it but i i felt like my spirit was locked into sister heidi this morning if i could say it that way i just it was such a burden the whole service i was praying lord you know her heart she desires to serve you with all that she's got she suffered greatly but she's standing on the promise and then god comes and confirms it god is working amongst his people we can stand on that promise i don't know how he's going to do i don't care how he does it but he's going to fulfill his promise to sister heidi and brother matt so i just want to say that because you know so many times those things might just go and nobody maybe they would get known but i'm going to say it right now because it's a testimony that jesus christ is alive amongst his people right now oh that was for brother branham say that's for our day right now that's the children's bread that's not for the world out there benny hinn and all the rest of those televangelists and things that try to make things act like a certain thing but that's a scarecrow but this is a real god because i can tell you i didn't talk to sister laura's sister kelly i know they weren't talking to each other about this specifically but there's a holy ghost that is putting a burden on the hearts of the people and then just to have an unction and then to not only that but to be obedient to that unction amen and i'm glad that the lord brought that to mind because i want you to remember i wrote it down but i didn't get to it just one last thing and then we'll close in prayer with brother cosman you know when joshua when they went over into the into the promised land what was the first thing they did they they came to jericho and the lord said you compass that city about you compass it about once a day for seven days and on the seventh day do it seven times and then blow the trumpet it wasn't the trumpet blast and the marching that caused the wall to fall down but it was obedience to the word of god the power was in the obedience and god brought to pass you tell me how a sound wave from a trumpet or the voices of people could do it i don't know don't care but it was the obedience to the word of god that looked silly you're going to conquer a city by marching around it a bunch of times yeah why because god said we would and that's what sister heidi i know you're probably listening to right now i want it to be an encouragement wherever that is it's coming to pass he's confirmed here god is working right now it's not about what you can see or feel with your hands or all these different things but obey the word of god these sisters obeyed the word of god they felt an unction they came forward just like the sister that prayed for that baby she obeyed the word of god and god honored it because of that obedience and that's what we're coming to so as our brother cosman i just wanted to say that to encourage you god is working amongst his people it's not an open show it may not be out there to the unbeliever what a brother brain i'm seeing the quote right he says not to the unbeliever that's the children's bread that's yours that's mine that's our inheritance so we're not going to let the devil take it from us this second verse is brother billy comes in this message tonight amen if words could fall like [Music] if [Music] i will still run out of time [Music] thank you for the truth so listen to our hearts and hear us [Music] we [Music] you are [Music] hallelujah did you enjoy the word tonight hallelujah it's wonderful to be in his presence you know that's what randy was speaking you know we all want to be at the mountaintop all the time but you know that's where if you stay there too long your fruits will freeze you need some valleys experience where you can know god who he is and you can get into some fights and where you can get into your knees and pray and let the word of god become a reality to you that could take you right back into the mountaintop but he's made the valley so we can fight amen i so enjoy what he was saying and for our sister heidi i'll just say it was amazing how the just the sisters just came and showed up and we looked at each other we said god is going to do something let's just spot our heads our gracious father father as your children with soul father move to be in your presence even tonight lord father your word came forth and and i believe with all my heart you're making your word a reality to us father we don't want to be the interpreter of your word and because your prophet tells us that you are your own interpreter and the way you interpret it is by taking what you said and making it to pass and father even now we say father let the word that was spoken tonight lord and let it be applied to our lives lord let it become a reality lord and we don't want to be just hearers of the word but we want to be doers also we want to be a people with the expectation of the supernatural lord and not the interpretation of the mind but those that they can grab the supernatural they can believe in the supernatural and god will take the supernatural and translate it into the natural world that's what we desire tonight father for the desires those that came up for prayer lord we commit everything into your hands and we know you never fail lord and we know when you made your promise your promise is as real as done oh god and father those that are going back to school and those that already started school and father the desires that we have of sicknesses and all the deliverance and everything lord we claim every single promise and why because you've placed us in the promised land and you've given us all this promise and it's up to us to claim them and bring them to you and cash them out lord we're here to cash our healing oh god and we're here to cash our deliverance loan we're here to cast every bit of things that we have need of lord why because we pro you promised to us that the things which you have said in your word they will become a reality within our lives and therefore we are here claiming those be lifted up tonight lord and we thank you for your word we can't we thank you for coming by our way we thank you for speaking to our hearts and and father we go out of here with a much bigger expectation of what we came in with we love you with all our hearts oh god and we ask you blessed by the right and he lord and the things which have been the revelation that he's been able to just share with us the things which you have spoken to his heart and i pray father even now you increase him with abundant revelation lord lord we are a people under an expectation that any moment lord it could be the end time any moment this thing will end and we'll be in a rapture therefore we walk with that expectation we continue to look on you because you said look unto me until the end of the earth so look unto me ye all that have needs and look unto me and father when we look to you we see our deliverance we see all that we have need of we commit the weak to come into your hands father be with each and every one and those that are physically gathered here those that are streaming father remember pastor who is coming back and remember matthew who's been preaching and possibly on the way back we commit everything into your hands until we meet again if you will lord we love you with all our hearts and we don't want to just be those spectators but we want to be the ones in the fight and that you could come and use our flesh to manifest yourself through we we love you and we ask those things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen [Music] give me q [Music] let's take that as a dismissal [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] your name oh jesus [Music] god [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] oh jesus [Music] worthy [Music] so [Music] you
