distribute it unto the poor thou shalt have treasures in heaven come follow me he says i think the word come follow me that would be the best advice i could give if i was talking to 10 000 kids or just talking to just what i am it's a command and the greatest thing that i think that was ever offered anybody and especially a young person follow me well tonight i'd like to just read this scripture you're very familiar with it in acts 19 and it's in the 11th verse it says and god wrath special miracles by the hands of paul and and that from his body were brought unto him the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases parted from them and evil spirits went out from them well you know i'm not paul and i'm not brother branham we're not paul and we're not brother branham but we were given the example and to do as he did paul said be followers of me is i am of christ so what i do is i have a handkerchief here and i have it on this scripture and so what i'd like to do is invite the brothers that would feel like to come up and we're all going to lay our hands on this uh handkerchief and then i'm going to bring it down to brother otis and pray with him so the brothers would come at this time mother tim and and mendoza and different ones come there's more of you brothers if you feel you have the holy ghost i'm not going to invite you if you're not led to come lay your hands on this handkerchief for the brother then that's okay but anybody who feels they just come up front right up here brothers and you know if you feel like you'd like to minister to brother otis that we're going to lay our hands on this nice to have my brother with me so i'm going to ask i'm going to ask brother raphael to lead us in prayer and so let's just all come together brother in here i believe this works i believe it's an example and we know they've done this and they've seen great results and we know which path we want to follow the path of our messenger so brother go ahead lead us in prayer [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen amen and everybody says amen amen god bless you we're privileged to have andrew speak for us tonight we'll go ahead and turn the service to

lord just a willing vessel lord lord you said o god that if we would just come with a hungry honest heart lord that you'd feel us oh god and that's that's been our cry oh god since the day one oh god when we said oh come lord cleanse me of my wicked way lord come tonight again and grant us another divine portion we're praying in the name of jesus that you would bless each heart lord and as we think about oh god our brother odis lord lord it's our desire lord and it's our earnest expectation to see him in the house of god once again lifting up his hands oh god lord singing praises lord knowing that you're a faithful god lord knowing that it's for an hour and a time is this oh god to stand face to face with the enemy and call him a bluff and a liar father let it be o god that testimonies would come forth from his experience o god by this manifestation of your word lord may it encourage many o god that see your will being done to take heart oh god bless even our brother steve lord no doubt there was surgery to be performed lord lord you're the heart surgeon tonight father we ask god that we would give you access to every portion of our heart lord come by your holy ghost and promise lord in jesus christ's name we committed all to you amen amen praise the lord how many is feeling good tonight praise the lord well if you have your bibles just see what the lord has for us tonight i'm excited about we turn in our bibles to romans chapter 10. i certainly appreciate the songs it definitely has created an atmosphere romans chapter 10 we'll just start there in verse 1. we'll read a little bit of scripture here it says brethren my heart's desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved for i for israel is that they might be saved for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is not for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth for moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth these things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart notice where it is saying it say not in thine heart who shall ascend unto heaven that is to bring christ down from above or who shall descend into the depths that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart and that is the word of faith which we preach amen you may have your seed that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shall be saved amen what a what a simple formula amen aren't you thankful that you have a heart to believe the simple for from the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed praise the lord ain't that wonderful that you believe this report i'm you know i just think about the realities you know sometimes when you look in the mirror you look at yourself and you just think you know i'm a christian you know and the scripture is saying that the word is nighty even in thy heart and in thy mouth you know it's interesting you know you've heard comments like you haven't seen me you know you haven't really seen me you've seen the shell you've seen what appears to be me but really who you are is what god made you in your heart amen and so i think it's sometimes as we've gotten a great uh uh admonition and maybe i'll just um you know let you know what what i'm gonna be speaking tonight which i'm thinking about the original production of the word so so from the heart this word the word is not the letter right yeah the the word helps wash the amnesia but who you are is the word and the word that's in your heart is desiring to be expressed in your flesh and and you know i think it's an interesting time you know we realize there's the human factor that we all must battle it's always getting in god's way amen but i think it's a great paradox when when somebody recognizes i don't have what it takes to be a christian but because i've heard this word of promise that he's planted something in my heart we'll call it a seed it's a seed of himself amen and that seed has the potential to manifest every tree that was in it it has all the same potentials if it's an apple seed it can produce as many apples as it's been ordained to produce amen and if the the the scripture says i have planted it now water it day and night let someone pluck it from my hands isn't that wonderful that we have this kind of promise that you can't fail because this is this is a predestinated plan of god but yet now there's a reward to be had see god's not what we would say to give one day and take it back so you don't have to worry once you've accepted the blood once you've been cleansed and you've invited him into your heart and he's quickened you he's brought you to life you don't have to worry that you're going to be lost because you got this human factor you're packing and it tries to trip you up and it's got a will it's got desires amen but we're thinking of producing the being a production see is this is not a workup amen you don't have to worry about the seed beer all it needs is moisture all it needs is light all it needs is nourishment amen and to think that god has planted a seed in you and he's giving you the the job to cultivate your garden amen you have the ability to water it with praise amen i thank you god that you saved me from myself you saved me from a life of just selfishness taking all of the blessings of god and just living my own life doing my own thing not even worrying about my neighbor or what his needs are no no now that seed the potentials is to bring a production of himself amen ain't that wonderful you've been chosen for this job hallelujah i just think about that seed and you know the word is nighty even in thy mouth you know and even in thy heart you know sometimes based on the the the message that we were listening to this weekend you know recognizing your day and its message you know i feel you know there was a statement in there about you know it's it's a time that we examine ourselves you know what what what nature is coming out of my heart well like this is an hour you know when when we recognize the time that we're living in the day in its condition you know there's something that paul says in the heart that says you know i see that god has manifested these supernatural vindications of the scripture about the the time engine or your job or or what you're facing is more valuable than stealing away and walking with him a while hunting out those great nuggets or are we just waiting for the preacher to go or the pastor to go or the teacher to go or the youth leader or the deacon or the trustee are they supposed to do their job well there's things that you each one of you you have a responsibility to the body and we cannot we must find our post of duty and serve it with all of our heart that's the only way that will be satisfied that's the only way that we'll receive a whole heart right just surrender dying out saying god not my will but thine be done oh when you we come to that place where we're yielded and god can take full preeminence full control full sway god you're on the throne of it's no longer reasoning and doubt mixing with what's in my heart amen is that your heart's desire the wonderful thing about it is you acknowledging it god planted it there my you're such a privileged people that god would plant a will his will in your heart that you would want to do it oh my i never was flat on my back and i i tried to run haven't you tried to run i can identify in one way with paul about it's hard for you to kick against the pricks brother brahms said sometimes you'll have to end up flat on your back and that's that's my testimony what it is then you become part of it oh my oh my there's power in receiving the word of god to to hear a word and let it come into your mind and the power of the word can transform the seed and make it live amen that's a reality you become part of it it's the it's only his word that he'll raise up as he did his word on the first easter morning only his word come forth and those who died in his word believe his word and vindicate his word amen now notice now that it's been 2700 years ago notice they're scattered they are blinded and they and speaking of the jews they were scattered they were blinded and he's referring back to hosea 6. if you want to you can go back and read it but it was it's prophecy and we're seeing it come to pass it's already been and now we're we're a part of the revival oh my woo i i mean i get excited forgive me i i'm telling you what we got something to be excited about the living god the creator of heavens and earth is dwelling in human temples that have been sanctified by his blood oh my to be yoked with him he said take my yoke upon you my burden is easy he's meek and lonely and hard oh you have that potential christ let it live in me scattered they were blinded now they've got to be dead and the gentiles are called out the bride is ready the rapture is at hand can we realize that can we actually believe that is it a story that's been told is it a myth to us is it something that sounds real is it something that we outside can believe can we believe it outside my personalize it tonight or is it something that's in us that's part of us that's more than life to us i think it's a sobering hour to examine ourselves have my affections been so pulled away from what god has what he's doing now that's one of the traps is look what god did oh look at what he did in brother branham's ministry look what he did back there in christ in his ministry but he says the works that i do shall you do also and greater works we're going to need faith to go to work we're going to be needing to be so surrendered and believing from the heart god is producing the original again god is it real amen what is what attitude do we set this morning in the tabernacle remember it'll be a small flock that receives it amen praise the lord little flock fear not it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen what a paradox that we can be so yielded and so surrendered that god could come in a little tiny simple stable like your heart like the manger like the song says let it be in me the manger of my heart let your word tell the same story it's always told that you're a god that cares for the unlovable is that what he did in your life can the very christ that came to you and revealed all to you you're no good you're you were born in sin it's not because you drank and you smoked and all of that it's because you were born through gandhian uh you were born you were condemned by your the origin of your birth and that's why i said you must be born again well how can we be born again i mean should we go back into our mother's womb why sometimes our mind wonders at these things i wonder if this is right i wonder if that's right don't we put that devil on the run tonight god's word is true i know i'm healed because by his stripes i am healed you put your name in it god he paid the ultimate price for me and he's proved it by coming my way and taking the guilt how many how many times did you hear someone testify and they say i've given my heart to the lord and yet their life is just well it just doesn't seem like there's any difference why would someone want to give their heart to the lord why would you want to give your heart to the lord well god desires to have another production amen he has spoken a bride that's going to come into manifestation he's already seen the view amen i believe that you're her amen praise the lord you know when you think about giving your heart to the lord you know i think that our testimony when we gave our heart to the lord is a great witness and you know we speak from experience you know what the lord's done it's not just from the carnal knowledge of the word and we're also identified in god fulfilling coming behind that truth and making it live so i say well since i've given my heart to the lord he's actually done things for me that i couldn't do for myself i realized that there was a chasm between me and satisfaction in life how many know him as the lily of the valley oh you were crushed by the burden of sin but he says you know what i i went to i conquered it i conquered death i conquered the grave amen there was a grave of sickness i'd been under the oppression of disease from spine injuries and oh it was it was a grave i had i had no hope i could not the doctors could not how many of you have had just like our brother otis that the doctors they don't feel like they have the answer they've gone as far as their book shows but our book has a different report praise god for another report he's the alpha and the omega he's the beginning and the end i believe he has the final save what's in your heart i want to see him worshiping god i love that brother just to see him raise his hands oh i'll just get to rejoicing that's what i think about you when you start stomping the devil getting this formalism i'm going to worship my god cause he's worthy that devil has held me bound too long i'm gonna i'm gonna let some soldiers go to work i realize that i'm i'm facing an enemy that's trying to trying to dodge me trying to make me lukewarm he's sowing doubt in my mind are you are you a christian brother i am what i am by the grace of god you light you know we want to we're we're not we're not shadow boxing we got thus saith the lord you use that word that is in your heart you let it fly out of your mouth with a heart of conviction and watch that great enforcer come that holy spirit and he'll stand at the post sickness be gone in the name of jesus oh my are we gonna take our position are we going to stand in order lord your word is true and i believe it let not one word of promise fall by the wayside it's a sobering hour but praise god god promised that he'd be with you even in you to the very end amen ain't that wonderful well i don't mean to keep you very long just i rejoice in the word of the lord and and we just trust that as we face this great battle the enemy's really trying to make us lukewarm and you know what we need to get some soldiers you know in the greatest battle that's ever fought they they picked a meeting ground and there was going to be a test of strength and you know a lot of times you think oh i think this thought really there's only two powers there's only two there's the power of death and the power of of god in life amen and so when something comes in your mind in a thought realize there's only two origins you know i just think sometimes we're so beat down is because we haven't been into the source of renewing i don't think we've actually entertained angels unaware i don't know if we've really taken the time and recognized the value of cutting away getting alone i'm talking about me i'm preaching to myself but i think it's worth it i think the love affair with christ i mean from the heart you know faith has been restored and we have the substance you know there's a great anticipation that from my heart i cherish i cherish the time when god comes by my way and just speaks a truth with spiritual food and season don't you love that it doesn't just have to be on wednesday and sunday amen it's available lord teach us to pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread can we just get back to the abc sometimes we just we get going so busy so fast and i know the construction and all the stuff you know we got to keep up but you know one thing i realized going through a little bit of a a pressure situation i realized one of the conditions that are upon us that's trying to make us lukewarm is those those three pressures that he warned us about you know soft living the pressures of riches you know come on it's i'm not this is not the first time you've heard this nervous tensions people they don't know they're going to and fro trying to satisfy what's in their heart and they're going and it doesn't satisfy but they're going to manifest worldlyism but don't get caught up in their ways take the name of jesus to prayer and ask god to speak to you because if you commune heart to heart with them i give you your heart's desire amen don't you want to serve him more why don't we stand as we invite the musicians [Music] the word is nighty even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation amen praise the lord if you have somebody on your heart and as we close the service and prepare to turn it over to our brother billy and you feel like you you want to come up to the front we can pray with you or you can just believe right there in your seat if you have a special need and the lord spoke to you don't don't let it go by the wayside let let what was however the lord's dealt with your heart tonight let it produce a christ don't don't accept any defeat you're a victorious bride because he's already given us victory amen let us bow our heads precious heavenly father how we thank you god for your faithfulness we thank you god that you can take a broke up thought and lord you can center it right to the need father lord we rejoice in your works lord we rejoice that lord you placed it upon our pastor's heart to to be a doer of your word lord and and he's gone out and and our hearts go to our brother otis lord we ask god that waves of testimonies would ripple through this congregation from you being so faithful and touching our brother [Music] father we're so grateful lord for all of what you do for us lord let us not neglect so great a salvation father lord may we be up in doing lord may we o god shun any strife oh god any way of the world father give us vision lord we just pray for each heart here lord we ask your mercies we ask that you would go with them lord and that their fellowship with you can grow and grow we certainly appreciate your goodness to us lord and as we worship you lord may you even be in this little after the preaching lord may you just anchor it even deeper lord do exceedingly abundantly above what we can even think or ask as we commit the people to you in jesus christ's name amen [Music] shall we sing that together [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] am [Music] [Music] why [Music] way oh [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Music] watch me now as
