[23:51] you're getting a little older and when
[23:53] you see
[23:54] uh ones that hear about ones that used

[24:00] called him
[24:01] away and then you hear trouble hit them
[24:03] they're still family
[24:05] they're still part of the body and so i

[48:05] and they said among themselves who shall
[48:08] roll out away the stone from the door
[48:10] of the sepulcher and when they had they
[48:13] looked
[48:14] they saw that the stone was rolled was
[48:17] rolled away
[48:18] for it was very great
[48:21] and entered into the sepulcher they saw
[48:25] a young man
[48:26] sitting on the on the right side clothed
[48:29] with
[48:29] a long white garment and there was
[48:32] there were afraid or frightened
[48:36] and he said unto them be not afraid
[48:40] ye see ye seek jesus of nazareth
[48:43] which was crucified he is
[48:46] risen he is not here
[48:49] behold the place where he where they
[48:52] laid him
[48:54] also let's turn in romans chapter 8.
[49:01] romans chapter 8
[49:07] verse 11 but if the spirit of him that
[49:11] raised him
[49:12] that raised up jesus from the dead
[49:14] dwells in you
[49:15] it's he he that raiseth up christ from
[49:18] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[49:21] body
[49:22] by this by his spirit that dwelleth in
[49:24] you
[49:25] so i want you to really picture here
[49:28] it says if the spirit
[49:32] if but if the spirit of him that raised
[49:36] up christ or jesus from the dead so
[49:40] so he's talking about the spirit of him
[49:43] that raised christ
[49:44] from the dead he's not saying the spirit
[49:46] of jesus that raised him from the dead
[49:48] so there's a spirit of him if the spirit
[49:52] of
[49:52] him that raised up jesus from the dead
[49:55] dwells in you
[49:56] in other words he got that spirit from
[49:58] some place and then he says that it
[50:00] dwells in you
[50:01] and and he that raised up christ from
[50:04] the dead
[50:06] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[50:09] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[50:11] so the same spirit that was in him gets
[50:14] put in you
[50:15] and he produces the same thing amen may
[50:17] the lord have the blessing to the
[50:18] reading of his word you may be seated
[50:22] and we'll we'll try not to be too long
[50:30] i've just been pondering on some of the
[50:34] messages our pastors been preaching and
[50:37] some of the tapes we've been hearing
[50:40] i i know i was uh
[50:44] i was listening to the message the
[50:46] rising of the sun
[50:47] and and and it's it's almost
[50:52] it's almost it's when you when you
[50:54] listen to the easter seal and the rising
[50:56] of the sun it's almost the same message
[51:00] it's it complements itself very well you
[51:03] you look at here you see certain things
[51:05] and you look and you see the same things
[51:07] being repeated
[51:08] and tonight just for a few minutes i
[51:10] would like to speak
[51:12] and my title tonight is it's all about
[51:15] the resurrection
[51:17] it's all about the resurrection and i
[51:20] would i want to just
[51:21] open up to say that um it's very
[51:24] important
[51:25] we we we know what we are here to do or
[51:28] what the focus of what the real thing is
[51:30] all about
[51:31] uh we realize that it's the resurrection
[51:34] life that brought jesus
[51:36] out from the dead it's the resurrection
[51:38] life that would bring
[51:40] out of us the manifestations of sons and
[51:42] daughters
[51:43] it's not our life it's the resurrection
[51:45] life it's not anything we
[51:47] we conjure up because we read so many
[51:49] scriptures
[51:50] it's not when we shout it up or we get
[51:53] all emotional
[51:54] it's the resurrection life that does it
[51:57] and
[51:57] and and and so we could we could
[51:59] definitely focus on that and say i want
[52:02] the resurrection life it's the one it's
[52:05] it's the very life that takes you back
[52:07] and makes you a son
[52:09] and the daughter that you're supposed to
[52:10] be from the beginning
[52:12] of what god thought of you it's the it's
[52:15] way i don't want to say this
[52:17] until you receive the resurrection life
[52:20] you haven't started living yet
[52:22] you are still dead in sin and trespasses
[52:25] resurrection life is what brings you to
[52:27] life
[52:28] it causes you to actually do the works
[52:30] that you were supposed to do when you
[52:32] get here
[52:33] it's one i want you to think about
[52:35] resurrection as being a stream of life
[52:38] when you get into that stream of life
[52:40] you actually come back like the story of
[52:42] an eagle
[52:43] you come back to what you are supposed
[52:45] to be
[52:46] you you come back to something that you
[52:48] always desire
[52:49] and he puts you forward for the purpose
[52:52] of the kingdom
[52:53] in order for you to achieve something
[52:55] resurrection life
[52:57] it's it's it's it's the resurrection
[52:59] life that brings us into a place where
[53:00] we can even
[53:02] serve the very purpose of god but random
[53:04] tells us that
[53:05] it's only the things that have served
[53:07] the purpose of god
[53:09] that will rise again it's not when we go
[53:12] just living all kinds of life and then
[53:14] you know at the end we think
[53:16] they're gonna weigh our balance and then
[53:18] find out if we did a lot of good or a
[53:19] lot of beds and find out where we fall
[53:22] no it's when we have this resurrection
[53:24] life within us
[53:25] that's what causes us to be different
[53:28] that's what stops our lying that's what
[53:30] stops i like that song give me that
[53:32] old-time religion
[53:34] why because it's the real thing it's the
[53:36] things that bring the change
[53:38] and i want to say even as we got the
[53:40] here tonight we want the real thing
[53:42] i'm not here to gather for somebody to
[53:44] give me some painted sermon
[53:46] and trying to make me feel good and
[53:48] trying to just
[53:49] give me something and then i can go and
[53:51] then come back and need more
[53:53] no i want a real life i want something
[53:56] that when i get out of here i'm no
[53:57] longer the same
[53:59] and that thing is the resurrection life
[54:02] and that's where our focus is supposed
[54:04] to be
[54:05] and so that's why i was thinking about
[54:07] even the story but random says you know
[54:08] when he was talking about insurance it
[54:10] says they would say
[54:11] you know i said yeah i'm telling i'm
[54:13] selling insurance and it says
[54:15] what insurance are you selling and it
[54:16] says and finally the men come around and
[54:18] i said well really i like what you're
[54:20] saying but you know that's not he says
[54:22] but when you get in the grave what's
[54:24] going to happen to you and all of that
[54:26] it said
[54:26] i'm not so concerned about what happened
[54:29] to me when i get in the grave
[54:30] i'm not so concerned about what happened
[54:33] to this flesh
[54:34] what i'm concerned about is a power that
[54:36] can bring me out of the grave
[54:38] and that power is the resurrection life
[54:41] that power is the power of the lord
[54:44] jesus
[54:45] the power the same power that raised him
[54:47] up from the dead
[54:48] is made available to the believers
[54:51] and so it becomes very important we
[54:53] realize that's the life that we
[54:55] we want and the resurrection life it's
[54:58] not something that
[54:59] we get when we go out in the grave you
[55:01] die
[55:02] and somewhat some power comes into the
[55:04] grave it opens up the graves and he
[55:07] pulls you up
[55:07] no resurrection is the power that lives
[55:10] within a believer
[55:12] that when the flesh goes into the grave
[55:14] that power is already in him to bring
[55:17] him out of the grave
[55:19] and that's the power that we're talking
[55:21] about tonight we're not interested in
[55:23] some
[55:23] uh hockey spokes and some demonstration
[55:26] or
[55:27] a man coming and speaking in such a
[55:29] place where
[55:30] our minds get filled up and yet we don't
[55:32] have the life
[55:33] we want the life more than anything you
[55:36] know i'd say this i was thinking about
[55:38] maybe perhaps i learned this from
[55:39] brother mike
[55:40] he said one time i was talking to him it
[55:42] says the main thing
[55:44] is to keep the main thing the main thing
[55:47] and
[55:47] i began to think about it when i was
[55:49] studying this the main thing is to keep
[55:51] the main thing the main thing
[55:52] which means there's going to be
[55:54] something that's going to try to
[55:55] distract you from the main thing
[55:57] there's going to be something that's
[55:59] going to be presented as replacement for
[56:01] the main thing
[56:02] and your job will be to look at
[56:04] everything and say
[56:05] this is still the main thing your job
[56:08] will be to
[56:09] rearrange everything and say i know
[56:11] about this side this is wonderful i like
[56:13] this i liked it
[56:14] but what i'm desiring is the
[56:16] resurrection life
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] but when i'm speaks and he says
[56:22] he speaks it says now listen uh here's
[56:25] another thing
[56:26] it says for proof it's so quick and
[56:30] it's so quick in them in such a way till
[56:32] you know what
[56:33] see they lifted up in they were lifted
[56:36] up in heavenly places
[56:37] the moto bazi was so quickened and he's
[56:40] speaking about the day
[56:41] of of of pentecost he says the mortal
[56:44] body was so quickened
[56:46] that that that till their language
[56:48] changed
[56:49] and then it says they only quicken their
[56:53] language
[56:54] it says it says that's what the bible
[56:56] says
[56:57] the moral body being quickened their
[57:00] language was quickened
[57:01] their thoughts were quickened their
[57:03] spirits were quickened
[57:05] their life were quickened they were
[57:07] quickered all together
[57:09] they talked and spoke in new language
[57:12] in heavenly language who it says what a
[57:15] quickening power
[57:16] and i look at it and i says that's the
[57:18] kind of power that i want
[57:20] you know i i you know some advice you
[57:24] you you
[57:25] you get to a place where you get tired
[57:27] of looking at yourself
[57:28] and tired of of your humanity of your
[57:31] own thinking and your own everything and
[57:34] and you know this is my thinking and
[57:36] this is this
[57:37] you want something to come something
[57:39] that could be real something that you
[57:41] can know
[57:42] this is no longer me this is god moving
[57:44] in my body
[57:45] you know like paul says that the life
[57:47] which i now live
[57:48] now he didn't say the life when i go to
[57:51] the grave
[57:52] when i come out of the grave the life
[57:54] that i will have will be
[57:55] no it says the life which are now at
[57:58] this present moment
[58:00] not in the future at this present moment
[58:02] the life which i now live it's not my
[58:04] own
[58:05] it's his life and and there has to be a
[58:08] people in the end time who can stand and
[58:10] say the same thing
[58:11] why because that eternal life has been
[58:14] made available
[58:20] he says in the rising of the sun it says
[58:23] now
[58:25] and it speaks about easter he says
[58:28] it says today it's the walls today it's
[58:29] the memorial service
[58:31] it says at least in the united states
[58:33] and this side of the earth this morning
[58:35] it says in the church throughout it's a
[58:37] celebration of memorial
[58:39] the greatest triumph that man has ever
[58:41] had
[58:42] he says i think think of a savior
[58:45] when he died as in he says or
[58:48] even as an infant when he was born he
[58:51] says he could not have been
[58:53] uh he could have not have been here lest
[58:55] being
[58:56] uh less being becoming into the earth
[59:00] it says when he dies certainly he is
[59:03] he atoned for all our sin and yet being
[59:06] made
[59:07] fine like little babies are born
[59:10] there's been many men who are who have
[59:12] suffered and died real causes
[59:14] but there never was one that could raise
[59:18] himself up until today
[59:21] until this day and he continues on it
[59:24] says now
[59:25] it's the greatest week in history the
[59:28] greatest celebration of all time
[59:30] this easter he says it's where he proved
[59:33] that that that what he has said men can
[59:36] say things
[59:37] but yet he isn't exactly that can
[59:40] believe upon
[59:41] upon thoroughly until it's been proven
[59:44] to be true and as
[59:46] an end as god who said uh
[59:49] prove all things he says hold flats to
[59:52] that which is good
[59:54] he would not tell you to do something
[59:56] that will not do
[59:58] that he will not do himself so he proved
[1:00:01] who this was that died for our sins
[1:00:05] now here you know men can say so many
[1:00:08] things i was thinking about
[1:00:09] even you look at the religious world and
[1:00:12] and the world around us
[1:00:13] you know we talk about easter easter is
[1:00:15] celebrated by all christians
[1:00:19] but yet it it's still only a
[1:00:21] representation
[1:00:22] of some flowery something that happened
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:25] and oh it was a good man who gave his
[1:00:28] life and
[1:00:29] and and how that he he gave his life so
[1:00:32] we might live
[1:00:32] and all of that and all it is it's just
[1:00:35] superficial
[1:00:36] all it is there is no uh resurrection
[1:00:40] life
[1:00:41] moving there's no oh that life
[1:00:44] that that died and that person that gave
[1:00:46] himself up for me
[1:00:48] his spirit is dwelling in me no it's all
[1:00:50] superficial and then they go on and then
[1:00:52] they wait for the next easter to do the
[1:00:54] same thing again so it's not about how
[1:00:57] good a person was
[1:00:58] it's not about how they gave themselves
[1:01:01] they were meaning against themselves
[1:01:03] but talked about this many good men that
[1:01:05] died
[1:01:06] but yet what made the difference was the
[1:01:08] resurrection why because within this one
[1:01:11] was the mighty god himself coming to a
[1:01:15] word
[1:01:15] according to the promises that he made
[1:01:18] that he can take that body
[1:01:19] and he was born to be a sacrificial lamb
[1:01:22] so he can give the body
[1:01:24] and once the body was given the spirit
[1:01:26] will come back upon the people
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:30] and unless you receive of that spirit
[1:01:32] you receive of that resurrection
[1:01:34] all it is is just a good sermon all it
[1:01:37] is is
[1:01:38] just good conversation all it is is just
[1:01:40] stimulating our minds with scriptures
[1:01:42] and everything
[1:01:43] oh but i tell you it's more than
[1:01:45] scriptures it's more than just a
[1:01:47] conversation
[1:01:48] it's a real life and i'm looking at it
[1:01:51] tonight that's what i sending here it's
[1:01:54] a life that changes the way you talk
[1:01:56] it causes you to walk different it
[1:01:58] changes the very
[1:02:00] desire that you have in your heart it
[1:02:02] puts the love of god within you
[1:02:04] it causes you to walk difference to talk
[1:02:07] different
[1:02:07] you can actually look at yourself today
[1:02:10] and say i'm not what i used to be
[1:02:12] why it's because of that life it's a
[1:02:14] real life
[1:02:21] he says and as people today they are
[1:02:25] trying to say
[1:02:26] uh we would we we would wash our feet
[1:02:29] and
[1:02:30] once a year and thursday and friday we
[1:02:32] should take communion
[1:02:33] we should take the communion and and all
[1:02:35] the different doctrines they argue
[1:02:37] uh they argue about whether it should
[1:02:40] it should be this day or that day
[1:02:42] whether it should be a sabbath day
[1:02:44] the first day of the week all things are
[1:02:47] just
[1:02:48] merely tradition all
[1:02:51] things it's just become another
[1:02:53] tradition
[1:02:54] and he says what good would do w
[1:02:57] would any within with anything do to you
[1:03:00] whether it's length or length or if
[1:03:04] there's
[1:03:05] if there's no life in you it's it's only
[1:03:08] a memorial
[1:03:09] which there's nothing against but they
[1:03:12] can have
[1:03:13] certain uh carriers out of the tradition
[1:03:16] but left off the main thing
[1:03:21] they've left off the main thing they can
[1:03:23] carry on in tradition but they've left
[1:03:25] off the main thing
[1:03:26] so so now he said satan doesn't care how
[1:03:30] religious you are how right you are
[1:03:34] in you are in your doctrine if you miss
[1:03:36] that life
[1:03:38] you don't come up anyhow no matter how
[1:03:41] religious how good you are
[1:03:42] how many churches you belong to and and
[1:03:45] will god
[1:03:46] will belong to it doesn't matter one
[1:03:49] thing unless you have been
[1:03:50] born again it says therefore if
[1:03:53] god raised up jesus from the dead did he
[1:03:56] raise him up from the
[1:03:58] for for up for a memorial he asked a
[1:04:00] question he says
[1:04:01] it is the resurrection this morning only
[1:04:05] it says one day a year ago a certain day
[1:04:08] that we celebrate oh oh it says are we
[1:04:12] benefactors of his resurrection
[1:04:14] what does it mean to me what does it
[1:04:17] mean to you
[1:04:18] now believe it believe now we believe by
[1:04:21] faith
[1:04:21] that he raised him from the dead and but
[1:04:24] what we have
[1:04:26] what what has what has got to do with me
[1:04:30] that was 2 000 years ago you know
[1:04:33] that that that's the question that could
[1:04:35] be asked he writes him up 2 000 years
[1:04:37] ago what has got
[1:04:38] that to do with me today
[1:04:42] now but what about him talks about the
[1:04:45] uh
[1:04:45] the the resurrection it says it's
[1:04:48] as we read the scripture it's the rising
[1:04:51] of the sun
[1:04:52] and and and and obviously we understand
[1:04:55] it was a type of what happens in the
[1:04:58] natural
[1:04:59] but we we can look in our bibles we're
[1:05:01] not going to turn their
[1:05:02] uh we we know it all too well i don't
[1:05:05] want to waste any time on it
[1:05:06] i don't i just want to for the sake of
[1:05:08] time the scripture tells us that
[1:05:10] in the beginning the earth was dark
[1:05:13] it was filled with water and it was
[1:05:16] without
[1:05:17] form and void and the scripture says
[1:05:19] that god said
[1:05:20] let her be and there was light
[1:05:24] and then we find out to ask a question
[1:05:26] what was the purpose for that light
[1:05:28] to come up now we find out that barbara
[1:05:32] tells us that
[1:05:33] god had a seed that dwelt underneath
[1:05:36] that water
[1:05:37] and that seed had to come to light to
[1:05:40] the resurrection
[1:05:41] that seed had to receive life in order
[1:05:44] for it to be resurrected
[1:05:46] so when he said let her be the sun came
[1:05:49] out
[1:05:50] and what the sun did when it came out
[1:05:52] the sun began to dry up the water
[1:05:55] it began to warm the earth he began to
[1:05:58] do all of that work
[1:05:59] what was he doing it was doing it for
[1:06:02] the sole purpose
[1:06:04] to facilitate that the seed that were
[1:06:07] planted
[1:06:08] underneath the water will receive the
[1:06:10] sunlight and come to birth
[1:06:14] and i'll say this there was nothing that
[1:06:16] could stop the life from the sea to come
[1:06:18] forth
[1:06:20] the sun had made the way the sun had
[1:06:22] removed the obstacle
[1:06:24] the sun has dried up the water the sun
[1:06:27] has warmed up the earth
[1:06:29] the sun had done all the work that was
[1:06:31] supposed to be done
[1:06:32] and all the seed had to do was to
[1:06:35] believe the message that the sun was
[1:06:38] bringing
[1:06:38] and began to walk out of the married
[1:06:40] clay began to walk out of the ground
[1:06:43] and began to manifest what was hidden in
[1:06:45] them from the beginning
[1:06:47] oh i tell you that's not different from
[1:06:49] the son of man
[1:06:50] when he was given up to tie he had paid
[1:06:53] for all the sins of the man
[1:06:56] he had done all that was supposed to do
[1:06:58] he removed the obstacle
[1:07:00] that separated you from god that that
[1:07:03] that the cavern or or the the the the
[1:07:07] hole that was built up
[1:07:08] that no man could feel he came and he
[1:07:10] filled it up
[1:07:12] he made a way and this and tonight you
[1:07:14] can stand up as a son and daughter and
[1:07:16] say
[1:07:17] i go to god and i believe his word and
[1:07:20] receive the benefits of calvary
[1:07:25] the son was the one who removed the
[1:07:28] obstacle
[1:07:29] it's not us it's not us that did
[1:07:32] anything
[1:07:33] all we had to do was to receive all the
[1:07:36] earth was supposed to do
[1:07:38] was to receive the gospel that the sun
[1:07:40] was preaching
[1:07:42] all the earth the seed underneath all he
[1:07:44] had to do
[1:07:45] was to accept the message that the sun
[1:07:48] was preaching
[1:07:49] and the sun was preaching that there's
[1:07:51] going to be life on earth today
[1:07:53] there's going to be life on there today
[1:07:55] and i want to say that the sun continues
[1:07:57] to preach that message
[1:07:58] every day because without sundays no
[1:08:03] life
[1:08:04] if the sun refuses to come out there
[1:08:06] won't be no life
[1:08:08] if the son preaches a different message
[1:08:10] there's not going to be life
[1:08:12] therefore i want to say to us this
[1:08:14] morning or tonight
[1:08:16] it's not what we do it's not what kind
[1:08:18] of gospel we have received
[1:08:20] it's the resurrection life that has been
[1:08:23] spoken
[1:08:24] because just like the son talked about
[1:08:28] the earth
[1:08:28] telling him that there's going to be a
[1:08:30] resurrection jesus christ came and
[1:08:32] preached the same gospel
[1:08:34] that the son was preaching and he came
[1:08:36] vindicating it and showing us
[1:08:38] there's going to be resurrection
[1:08:44] he came and i'll say this
[1:08:48] it was the purpose of the sun to dry up
[1:08:51] the water
[1:08:53] it was not the purpose of the seed to
[1:08:55] dry up its own water
[1:08:57] it was the purpose of the sun to warm
[1:08:59] the earth
[1:09:00] to provide an environment where that
[1:09:03] seed could come out
[1:09:04] it's the purpose of the rising of the
[1:09:06] son of man
[1:09:07] the son of man who came and he gave his
[1:09:10] life that's what made a way so we could
[1:09:12] receive life
[1:09:13] so find out burbanham says it's the same
[1:09:16] way in the spiritual
[1:09:18] the rising of the sun it will bring us
[1:09:22] it brings us the rev the resurrection
[1:09:25] now we can uh we we could just look for
[1:09:29] a moment
[1:09:31] let me just read this uh for a moment
[1:09:35] but it says in the quickening power it
[1:09:38] says what does it do
[1:09:39] listen so so that you'll know
[1:09:43] and this is easter it says
[1:09:47] i want it to mean more to you
[1:09:50] than any easter has ever did
[1:09:53] i want i want you to see it you know
[1:09:57] what it's done for him but i want you to
[1:10:00] see it
[1:10:01] not will it has done the same for you
[1:10:06] we're not talking about some future
[1:10:08] tense
[1:10:09] this resurrection that we're talking
[1:10:10] about is a present tense
[1:10:13] something that we can get into tonight
[1:10:15] something that we live by every day
[1:10:18] something that we talk by something that
[1:10:20] we think by
[1:10:21] something that guides us every day why
[1:10:25] for the purpose of manifesting the will
[1:10:27] of god
[1:10:28] the son was not sent to perform its own
[1:10:30] will it was sent to perform
[1:10:32] what the will of god was from the
[1:10:34] beginning and every seed that was
[1:10:37] planted
[1:10:38] every seed that was planted the moment
[1:10:40] he saw the sun rise
[1:10:42] the moment he saw the sun coming up he
[1:10:45] knew within itself
[1:10:46] that it's time for me to rise up and
[1:10:49] stand
[1:10:51] it's the gospel it's the good news they
[1:10:54] receive it and they produce what it was
[1:10:56] supposed to produce
[1:10:58] so it says but i want you to see it not
[1:11:01] not
[1:11:01] will it has done the same for you what
[1:11:04] does it do
[1:11:05] it quickens your mortal body this mortal
[1:11:08] body
[1:11:09] it says that we live in it quickens it
[1:11:13] in other words it brings it to life now
[1:11:16] he he said it's one place and i probably
[1:11:18] won't be able to get to it
[1:11:20] it says uh what
[1:11:23] the resurrection resurrection
[1:11:28] is not replacement
[1:11:33] resurrection is not replacement
[1:11:36] in order for something to be resurrected
[1:11:39] it has to have been a life
[1:11:41] at some point in time
[1:11:45] so we're not receiving a life that was
[1:11:48] never ours to begin with
[1:11:51] we are not receiving something that is
[1:11:53] new that we never heard of
[1:11:56] all that the son of god is doing all
[1:11:59] that this resurrection is doing for us
[1:12:02] is bringing us right back into the
[1:12:04] condition
[1:12:05] that god intended for us when we came
[1:12:07] here on earth
[1:12:10] that's why i made a statement we haven't
[1:12:12] started living
[1:12:13] until we receive resurrection life why
[1:12:16] because the purpose of the son of man
[1:12:19] was to break the works of the enemy and
[1:12:21] to show to every other seed but of adam
[1:12:24] says it was the chief wave offering
[1:12:26] of the resurrection when he rose from
[1:12:28] the dead now
[1:12:29] i want you to think about what the devil
[1:12:31] did and all the ones the prophets and
[1:12:34] all that came before jesus
[1:12:36] and all that came and a great man that
[1:12:38] preached the gospel and
[1:12:40] abraham and and jacob and all of them
[1:12:42] they were held
[1:12:43] up by by by satan and the power of death
[1:12:47] in other words you know if there was
[1:12:49] something that man
[1:12:50] could seem like they couldn't break it
[1:12:52] was the power of death
[1:12:54] so he he held up everybody and brahmanam
[1:12:57] says it was the trinity of the devil
[1:13:00] it was the powerful hell death and the
[1:13:03] grave
[1:13:03] he held up everyone that came before
[1:13:06] jesus
[1:13:07] so when he showed up the first thing
[1:13:09] that he had to do
[1:13:10] was to take care of the obstacle just
[1:13:13] like the sun in the beginning
[1:13:15] he had to come and make a way so that
[1:13:17] resurrection could take place
[1:13:19] those men had preached and not all these
[1:13:21] things but the power of death they
[1:13:22] couldn't hold it
[1:13:23] so it came he came and the devil came
[1:13:27] putting the power of death within him
[1:13:29] and somehow
[1:13:30] in the virgin body that sin and the
[1:13:33] power of sin and
[1:13:34] the power of death was completely
[1:13:36] dissolved
[1:13:40] the power of sin the power of death to
[1:13:42] cause a man to die
[1:13:44] that power was taken into jesus and
[1:13:47] completely dissolved
[1:13:48] he tried to take it back and there was
[1:13:50] nothing coming out
[1:13:52] he tried to pull it out there was
[1:13:53] nothing coming out why
[1:13:55] he made done away with the power of the
[1:13:58] of
[1:13:58] of death and therefore all those that
[1:14:00] were in there
[1:14:01] were supposed to come out on the
[1:14:04] resurrection day
[1:14:08] oh brother sister what a news what a
[1:14:11] news it is
[1:14:12] and i tell you that's why i want to tell
[1:14:14] to us that i live in here sitting here
[1:14:16] this morning
[1:14:17] that we have something to rejoice about
[1:14:20] we have something to shout about
[1:14:22] we have something to thank god about why
[1:14:25] because
[1:14:26] resurrection has taken place that power
[1:14:29] has been dissolved
[1:14:31] all that the enemy could do now when
[1:14:33] death comes to you
[1:14:34] all he does for the son of god is bring
[1:14:37] him into the presence of god
[1:14:42] the other door that will take you down
[1:14:44] to hell to a place where you can be
[1:14:46] hidden
[1:14:46] that door has been shut that door has
[1:14:49] been taken away
[1:14:50] the only door that remains is for you to
[1:14:52] go into the presence of god
[1:14:54] that's why jesus said because i live you
[1:14:57] shall live
[1:14:58] also why it's the power of the
[1:15:02] resurrection
[1:15:03] that's the power by which we stand and i
[1:15:05] want to say this
[1:15:06] don't ever forget what the power did for
[1:15:08] you you
[1:15:10] know we can get all intellectual we
[1:15:12] cannot get them
[1:15:13] and lost in the books but never forget
[1:15:15] what our power did for you
[1:15:17] i was thinking about i said oh what
[1:15:19] would we be without that power tonight
[1:15:24] the power saved us it held us
[1:15:27] it removed alcohol and removed drugs
[1:15:30] we removed the things of the world it
[1:15:32] took us away from the bondage of sin
[1:15:35] it got some out of prisons and open all
[1:15:38] kinds of doors
[1:15:40] what is that resurrection power
[1:15:44] why was that god the son of man is
[1:15:47] already risen up
[1:15:48] the only thing the seed could do is just
[1:15:50] walk out of those things
[1:15:53] and i want to say this tonight if you
[1:15:55] have a need or something
[1:15:57] don't ever forget what power that did it
[1:15:59] for you
[1:16:00] don't think it's another power that's
[1:16:02] going to come do it it's the same power
[1:16:07] the same power that got you out of sin
[1:16:09] it's the same power that will provide
[1:16:11] in fact i'll say this when you receive
[1:16:14] the resurrection
[1:16:15] rapture is already started in you
[1:16:20] [Applause]
[1:16:22] we're sitting in heavenly places that's
[1:16:24] what the scripture has
[1:16:25] all we're waiting is for just this body
[1:16:27] to be dissolved
[1:16:29] there's already another one waiting on
[1:16:30] the other side why because resurrection
[1:16:33] power is calling for it
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:39] oh what a great day i tell you we're not
[1:16:42] here to preach some
[1:16:43] oh this is the 10 steps on how you're
[1:16:45] going to get better
[1:16:47] this is the 20 steps on how we're going
[1:16:49] to arrange you
[1:16:50] this is how you need to exercise every
[1:16:52] day so you can be fit
[1:16:54] all you need to do is eat of the book
[1:16:56] all you need to do is go on your knees
[1:16:58] and pray
[1:17:00] and the benefits of what's been given
[1:17:03] god has given us the authority to claim
[1:17:05] it
[1:17:05] every day if there's something lacking
[1:17:10] by the power of the resurrection you you
[1:17:12] have the right to stand up and say
[1:17:14] i need my healing i need my salvation i
[1:17:17] need my lost one safe
[1:17:19] i need this why because it was already
[1:17:22] paid for
[1:17:22] it's part of calvary
[1:17:36] the scripture says in ephesians
[1:17:47] it says ephesians
[1:17:50] chapter 2
[1:17:53] he says
[1:17:56] and you had it quickened
[1:18:01] who were dead in sin and trespasses
[1:18:04] wherein in time past walk according to
[1:18:07] the council of this world
[1:18:09] according to the prince of the power of
[1:18:12] the air
[1:18:13] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:18:15] children of disobedience
[1:18:17] among you you had we had of a
[1:18:19] conversation in time past
[1:18:21] and the loss of the flesh the fulfilled
[1:18:24] fulfilling the desires
[1:18:26] of the flesh and of the mind whereby
[1:18:29] nature the children of wrath
[1:18:31] even as others but god
[1:18:34] who is rich in mercy oh thank you god
[1:18:38] for your mercy
[1:18:39] you know it's that when we come to the
[1:18:41] realization and the recognition of this
[1:18:44] that's why we extend grace to other
[1:18:46] people
[1:18:47] that's why when we look at the person on
[1:18:49] the streets
[1:18:50] we come to the realization that they i
[1:18:53] didn't make myself what i
[1:18:54] am i didn't make myself love god
[1:18:58] god placed something within me
[1:19:01] i didn't make myself christian because
[1:19:03] if i did
[1:19:04] i'll walk right back out oh but
[1:19:07] something the quickened power of god
[1:19:09] came and found me where i was and he did
[1:19:13] something for me and i don't care how
[1:19:15] people think i'm crazy
[1:19:17] but something within me just want to
[1:19:19] thank him
[1:19:21] it's an individual testimony it's you
[1:19:24] looking back and
[1:19:25] standing there and realizing god you
[1:19:28] changed me
[1:19:29] i know it's in my soul that you changed
[1:19:31] me
[1:19:33] and that quickening power is here to do
[1:19:35] work
[1:19:36] he's here to continue that same work
[1:19:39] he's here to perfect you daily to change
[1:19:41] your nature
[1:19:42] to bring you into that perfection but
[1:19:45] oftentimes guess what we do
[1:19:47] we begin to look at our flesh oh you
[1:19:49] know we want to be perfect in our flesh
[1:19:51] and
[1:19:52] we want to trust in the flesh or god
[1:19:55] does it and then
[1:19:56] our head gets big and we think it's ours
[1:19:58] and you know we think
[1:20:00] it's holier than me you know you have to
[1:20:02] come and be a little holy and everything
[1:20:05] it's god that made the way.
[1:20:08] i tell you but when it says we are no
[1:20:10] different than the person working up in
[1:20:12] the street
[1:20:14] if it was not for the quickening power
[1:20:16] of god that came and found
[1:20:18] you and he wants you to have that
[1:20:20] enthusiasm to show the world
[1:20:22] so somebody can also be touched by the
[1:20:24] same power
[1:20:28] why because he's looking for his seeds
[1:20:33] he's looking how is he looking he's
[1:20:36] making a way
[1:20:38] he's drying up the circumstances he's
[1:20:40] removing the obstacle
[1:20:42] you know many of us sometimes god had to
[1:20:45] put you in the place where
[1:20:47] you were cornered you know there was not
[1:20:50] many options left
[1:20:52] you know you tried everything and you
[1:20:53] realized oh my
[1:20:55] i'm i'm getting close to dying now and
[1:20:58] then you call out to god
[1:21:00] why it was an appointed time that he
[1:21:02] knew he had an appointed time for that
[1:21:05] seed
[1:21:05] and i want to say this even those of you
[1:21:07] that grew up in the message
[1:21:09] you have to come to a place don't ever
[1:21:11] let that quickening power go away
[1:21:13] realize that it's the quickening power
[1:21:15] that god puts in your parent
[1:21:17] that kept you that protected you and now
[1:21:20] it's your time so you can come in
[1:21:22] contact
[1:21:22] with that same quickening power and it
[1:21:25] will do for you what it did for your
[1:21:27] parents
[1:21:28] it'll make you love god it'll make you
[1:21:31] forsake the things of the world
[1:21:33] it'll make you walk according to it word
[1:21:35] you know often times
[1:21:36] you know we we have to stand up here to
[1:21:39] pass that understanding
[1:21:40] or preaching about facebook about this
[1:21:42] and about our dresses
[1:21:44] i tell you just take a drink of this
[1:21:46] quickening power
[1:21:47] nobody will have to tell you how you
[1:21:49] should dress nobody will have to tell
[1:21:51] you whether you should leave social
[1:21:52] media or not
[1:21:53] the reason is we've stopped drinking
[1:21:55] from the quickening power
[1:21:59] get lost in him and see what he does oh
[1:22:02] you would fall in love with him
[1:22:04] and then nothing in the world will
[1:22:08] matter
[1:22:11] it's the quickening it saw that's why i
[1:22:13] want to say
[1:22:14] it's all about the quickening power it's
[1:22:17] not about how good we look or
[1:22:20] how impressive we look it's about
[1:22:23] god i need a quickening power i desire
[1:22:26] it
[1:22:27] others can scream and shout and do all
[1:22:29] they want
[1:22:30] but i want to scream when i have it i
[1:22:32] want to move when i have it
[1:22:34] i want to do all of this when i feel it
[1:22:36] move within me
[1:22:37] why because it's the power that brings
[1:22:39] about the change
[1:22:44] so so we find out as we write it as the
[1:22:47] quicken
[1:22:48] it says by his grace god reaching mercy
[1:22:51] for his great love wherein he loved us
[1:22:55] he says even we were dead in sin dead in
[1:22:59] sin
[1:22:59] had he quickened us together with christ
[1:23:02] by grace you are saved
[1:23:04] and has raised that up together made us
[1:23:06] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:23:08] christ jesus
[1:23:09] that in the edges to come oh my
[1:23:12] that in the edges to come that it may
[1:23:15] show the exceeding great riches of his
[1:23:19] kindness
[1:23:20] towards us you know i tell you the
[1:23:23] celebration in heaven
[1:23:24] is not gonna be how strong we were or
[1:23:27] how weak we were
[1:23:28] all that's gonna happen is you just come
[1:23:31] to the place where you realize
[1:23:33] how did i get here
[1:23:36] what did i do what did i give in order
[1:23:38] for me to receive this
[1:23:40] it's the celebration of the grace of all
[1:23:43] you think about the grace that saved you
[1:23:45] in a car accident
[1:23:46] the grace that saves you in the body of
[1:23:48] death the grace that saves you from the
[1:23:51] alcohol
[1:23:51] it's the celebration of his goodness
[1:23:54] towards us
[1:24:00] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:24:03] now i just want to move forward for a
[1:24:06] little bit
[1:24:07] and and and so barbara says i'm running
[1:24:10] out of town
[1:24:11] but i'm speaks about how yeah we are
[1:24:14] it's that resurrection so we live into
[1:24:16] that resurrection
[1:24:17] and everything that's produced is
[1:24:18] produced through this resurrection power
[1:24:21] that lives within us
[1:24:22] so now he he he he he now talks
[1:24:25] uh uh he says uh the secret of of of of
[1:24:29] life and death was broken
[1:24:32] on that it says but uh when the real
[1:24:34] seal had been broken
[1:24:37] it says one says one who once lived
[1:24:41] as we lived died as we died has risen
[1:24:44] from the dead
[1:24:45] that morning never was like one in all
[1:24:49] the history of mankind
[1:24:50] the secret was made known that it was
[1:24:54] life
[1:24:55] that it was made known that he was both
[1:24:57] life
[1:24:58] and resurrection now he says again
[1:25:02] here it says but the trinity of god
[1:25:05] being one manifested in christ who was
[1:25:08] life
[1:25:09] and had broken the seal and conquered
[1:25:12] the enemy
[1:25:12] and rose up one true living god i
[1:25:15] am he that was dead and am alive
[1:25:17] forevermore
[1:25:18] i have the key to death and hell god in
[1:25:21] one
[1:25:22] made a man dwell among us and conquered
[1:25:25] every enemy
[1:25:27] and proved that the trinity of satan was
[1:25:29] conquered
[1:25:30] and the trinity of god was made known
[1:25:33] cause
[1:25:33] only god alone had the power to bring
[1:25:36] life back
[1:25:37] again it says he was emmanuel
[1:25:41] god had been made manifested in flesh
[1:25:44] now i want to say this and and he says
[1:25:47] all of this he done it so he can make us
[1:25:50] beneficiary
[1:25:52] of this resurrection so he has made us
[1:25:54] so we can know
[1:25:56] that there's a resurrection and we are
[1:25:58] partakers of it because we were part of
[1:26:00] the sea that was supposed to come up
[1:26:02] and i want to even say this even before
[1:26:05] you came
[1:26:06] that provision was already made for you
[1:26:08] that when you come back up when you
[1:26:10] when you were born you you now he died
[1:26:13] 2000 years ago
[1:26:14] but the benefit will still be able to be
[1:26:17] drawn today
[1:26:18] was still being made available today now
[1:26:22] he he now says in the message again
[1:26:25] he says he makes a comment he says what
[1:26:28] what a resurrection that was and what a
[1:26:31] resurrection this
[1:26:32] is now i just want to for a moment dwell
[1:26:35] on this
[1:26:36] before i could close now it's now
[1:26:39] important we realize
[1:26:40] as far as man is concerned even as far
[1:26:43] as we are sitting here
[1:26:44] the same question was settled the price
[1:26:48] was paid
[1:26:49] we have been brought into that
[1:26:51] resurrection
[1:26:52] by the life we live we have been brought
[1:26:55] up that resurrection is the one that
[1:26:57] cleaned you
[1:26:58] and called you a son of god and did all
[1:27:00] of those things that he did for you
[1:27:02] so if we're sitting here it's because of
[1:27:04] that resurrection that happened
[1:27:06] now but there's also another
[1:27:09] resurrection that happened in this
[1:27:10] end time he says what a resurrection
[1:27:12] that was and what a resurrection this
[1:27:15] is and i would just want to touch this
[1:27:17] for a moment
[1:27:18] now when he died for when he died when
[1:27:21] he came the first time
[1:27:22] we understand he came for the purpose of
[1:27:24] praying our sins
[1:27:26] the things that men had fallen for
[1:27:29] god came in the form was born as a baby
[1:27:33] and a manger
[1:27:34] and he would give up his life to be
[1:27:35] given as a sacrifice
[1:27:37] now and but then at the end time a
[1:27:40] promise according to malachite 4
[1:27:43] that he shall return us to the faith of
[1:27:45] our fathers
[1:27:47] that it will send a message that will
[1:27:50] return us
[1:27:50] to the faith of our father and i want to
[1:27:53] ask you
[1:27:54] if the death of christ was enough then
[1:27:56] why
[1:27:57] send another one
[1:28:00] now we realized it was enough because he
[1:28:03] paid for all our sins
[1:28:04] but i want you to realize the promise at
[1:28:06] the end time
[1:28:08] was between the first resurrection
[1:28:11] and the second resurrection and
[1:28:13] revelation chapter 5 was right in
[1:28:15] between it
[1:28:16] so he had to die go to the father and
[1:28:19] then come back in revelation
[1:28:21] so he can come back and fulfill
[1:28:23] revelation chapter 10.
[1:28:24] so the first part of his resurrection
[1:28:27] was so that he can give us life back
[1:28:31] the second part of this resurrection was
[1:28:33] so he can come and claim
[1:28:35] that which he had died for oh my brother
[1:28:38] my sister
[1:28:39] that's why when we say it's taking us
[1:28:42] back to pentecost
[1:28:43] we're not talking about the gift we're
[1:28:45] not talking about those things
[1:28:47] he's talking about the faith of the
[1:28:48] father what was the faith of the father
[1:28:51] there were people that received a
[1:28:53] promise and the believed the promise and
[1:28:56] went and waited
[1:28:57] based on the promise and on the day of
[1:29:00] pentecost
[1:29:01] god fulfilled the promise
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:04] oh but there's another promise at this
[1:29:06] time and this end time
[1:29:08] is not a promise to turn us back because
[1:29:11] god doesn't go back
[1:29:12] it's not to turn us back so we can just
[1:29:15] speak entangled
[1:29:16] or rejoice with the gift no it's the
[1:29:19] promise to bring us into another body
[1:29:23] it's the promise to bring adam right
[1:29:26] back into god and again
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:31] the resurrection at the end time there's
[1:29:34] nothing stopping a believer
[1:29:36] to become god on earth
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:42] the resurrection at the end time is
[1:29:44] bringing us right back into a condition
[1:29:47] where god has given you the right to
[1:29:49] speak the word
[1:29:52] that's why i love what our pastor said
[1:29:54] even about brothers call him to come and
[1:29:56] baptize he said you baptized
[1:29:58] why because the coming of this end time
[1:30:01] is the bright body of god
[1:30:04] god manifesting in his people doing the
[1:30:07] same thing that he did when it was
[1:30:08] jesus not just in the pasture but in the
[1:30:11] body
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:14] this resurrection we saw a man come as a
[1:30:17] first fruit
[1:30:18] he was able to bring scroll into
[1:30:20] existence
[1:30:21] he was able to bring forth the third
[1:30:23] pole
[1:30:24] oh and i tell you when we receive that
[1:30:27] resurrection
[1:30:28] we have no need to go back but to go
[1:30:30] forward
[1:30:33] you know i i i didn't want to say this
[1:30:36] but i'll say
[1:30:38] you know there's a terminology where you
[1:30:40] know i believe the youth will get it
[1:30:43] where somebody will say i got your
[1:30:45] number
[1:30:46] i got your number and i'm not saying it
[1:30:48] in a sense i have your telephone number
[1:30:51] but someone and i and i heard it so much
[1:30:53] in sport where
[1:30:55] a person knows all your tactics that
[1:30:57] there's no way you can win
[1:30:59] against them i got your numbers in other
[1:31:02] words there's nothing
[1:31:03] the devil can pull off that he can win
[1:31:06] why
[1:31:07] the same god who won in heaven that same
[1:31:10] god came and won on calvary
[1:31:12] that same god come and dwell in his
[1:31:14] people
[1:31:15] oh i tell you and he knows how to
[1:31:17] recognize him
[1:31:19] that's why he's not afraid of us as a
[1:31:21] people all but when the same power comes
[1:31:23] within you
[1:31:24] he knows how to recognize it
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:29] but says our body becomes the temple of
[1:31:32] the dynamics
[1:31:34] the same spirit that that that one
[1:31:37] against him
[1:31:39] he knows how to recognize it and and i
[1:31:42] say if that's true i don't want anything
[1:31:44] else
[1:31:46] i'm not i i don't want any gimmicks i
[1:31:49] want that same resurrection power
[1:31:51] i want to look at the devil in the edit
[1:31:53] then i got your number
[1:31:58] i got your number why because the same
[1:32:01] god who overcame you
[1:32:02] the same god is living in me the same
[1:32:05] god who conquered you the same god is
[1:32:07] living in his people
[1:32:08] why for the purpose of manifesting his
[1:32:11] word in the end
[1:32:12] time he said he will have a bride
[1:32:14] without throttle wrinkle
[1:32:15] or any such thing how is he going to
[1:32:17] have it oh
[1:32:18] the perfect word has come
[1:32:23] quickening power oh i tell you i think i
[1:32:26] was reading
[1:32:27] you know but whenever he talked about
[1:32:29] when divine love is projected
[1:32:31] he talks about how when he went across
[1:32:33] that those fences and he began to go and
[1:32:36] he
[1:32:36] he says that that bull had just killed a
[1:32:38] person
[1:32:40] a couple of days ago but he said when i
[1:32:42] looked at him
[1:32:44] there was nothing in my heart but love
[1:32:47] there's nothing in my heart what was it
[1:32:49] quickening power it will put love within
[1:32:52] your heart
[1:32:53] it's not by strength it's not by mind
[1:32:56] it's by mom it's about the spirit of god
[1:32:59] if the musician could come oh i don't
[1:33:02] know how many desire the quickening
[1:33:04] powder now
[1:33:05] oh i just want to be filled with it
[1:33:07] tonight i don't need any gimmicks i
[1:33:10] don't need any understanding of man
[1:33:12] i want the quickening power something
[1:33:15] that makes me
[1:33:16] real something that makes me be real
[1:33:19] something that makes me
[1:33:20] act like i'm supposed to be acting not
[1:33:23] not someplace not get to where i'm
[1:33:25] uncomfortable
[1:33:26] and this and this when all of that is
[1:33:28] said and done
[1:33:29] i want the real me to come out and say i
[1:33:32] take this situation under my control
[1:33:34] why because quickening power has been
[1:33:37] made available
[1:33:41] not to take us back but pastor said
[1:33:45] to move out into not maturity
[1:33:48] this this revealing of the word at the
[1:33:50] end time
[1:33:51] is to bring us into adoption
[1:33:54] and adoption is when a son
[1:33:58] or a daughter has been given the right
[1:34:01] to sign the check and to speak in the
[1:34:03] place of the father
[1:34:05] and not that that we can glorify
[1:34:07] ourselves there's nothing at us
[1:34:09] we've been clean we've been saved we've
[1:34:11] been it's taken all of the desires of
[1:34:14] the flesh out of us
[1:34:15] it's taken even our self pride away from
[1:34:18] us
[1:34:18] he's made us just like just like the
[1:34:20] batch of skin in the old testament
[1:34:22] he's made us people that only desire one
[1:34:25] thing
[1:34:26] what pleases the father and when we get
[1:34:29] to that condition
[1:34:30] you have the right and i want to say
[1:34:32] this just like the first resurrection
[1:34:35] you had the lie
[1:34:35] the right to come and claim those
[1:34:38] benefit
[1:34:39] benefits of that calvary we have the
[1:34:42] right to come back and say
[1:34:44] god i i want love within my heart
[1:34:48] i want to claim my son and my daughter
[1:34:51] why because it's not you speaking
[1:34:54] you're basically speaking what was
[1:34:57] already spoken in the beginning
[1:34:59] like adam in the garden of eden but the
[1:35:02] scripture says when he named the animal
[1:35:05] god looked and said that's it why
[1:35:08] because
[1:35:09] it was a mind transfer why because it
[1:35:12] was only speaking what was in the
[1:35:13] father's heart
[1:35:14] why because it was only expressing what
[1:35:17] the father was
[1:35:18] oh isn't that your desire tonight i want
[1:35:21] to express god with every bit of me
[1:35:24] i don't want to hide anything i don't
[1:35:25] want to have any doors i don't want him
[1:35:27] in
[1:35:28] i want to open up i want to have that
[1:35:31] quickening power fill every fiber of my
[1:35:33] bones
[1:35:34] to where i'm only speaking what he would
[1:35:35] have me to speak to where i'm acting
[1:35:38] like
[1:35:38] to where i'm speaking and god comes and
[1:35:41] honors it
[1:35:43] he says moses spoke and god honors it
[1:35:47] that's the quickening power one god
[1:35:49] bless you let's all stand tonight
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:19] back in history
[1:36:25] unfair all
[1:36:28] proving over and over
[1:36:32] that his work has never changed
[1:36:38] but i can't keep on dwelling
[1:36:42] on surpass memory
[1:36:49] oh and he's
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:37:03] we spoke to
[1:37:08] [Applause]
