Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

comes falling on I've come to worship oh I come to oh and I'm going to sing my song [Music] amen our gracious father We've Come To Worship Lord and there's no greater worship than Amen in your word then living your word father our hearts bubble with joy joy that you've chosen us to and gave us Revelation that we might see at this great ending of time the path to Glory we're so thankful for that and Lord may we appreciate every brother sister that Associates themselves with the furtherance of this gospel may we pray for one another be in the unity of one another father the little differences father there we don't let it affect our heart and our love Lord we just want to magnify you and all that we do and the way that we worship we just ask you to bless us in Jesus name name we pray amen amen let's open our Bibles to the book of Filman and just read that first verse and just trust the Lord will bless us some more amen and uh that verse is very simple and it but as as our Prophet said he he prayed he said that the Holy Spirit would uh reveal to us what the intention was when Paul Paul said Paul a prisoner and and I just that really um and he made another statement we heard this morning he says it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal what the intention of the word was really what it was that was spoken he said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother unto filmon our dearly beloved and fellow labor God bless you you may be seated you know we mentioned uh this morning that uh the word of God is always a paradox you know it just it's so marvelous brother BR makes this statement he says and the same thing we find today we did come through a denominational age as we proved through the church ages the Bible and so forth but now we come now to a free age where the Holy Spirit himself comes down and vindicates himself and makes himself known makes every promise that he promised come to pass oh my what a great time Hallelujah but you know it's a great time for the believer when he begins to see the word word of God coming to pass all around him and he knows it you know I mean it's terrible to be in the dark if I could say that you know the expression I I I nobody told me you know I'm I'm totally in the dark you know what's going on and then when you see it it's beautiful but you know but in all those things he talked about the there's no freedom in denomination because you can't have Revelation outside of what they believe and that's what we're free we're free for God to reveal to us all of his great word and then and just another statement or two and then we'll finish our the message that we listened to he's talking of Paul here now he'd become imprisoned to something a a prison so so after comparing it and seeing no wonder he could write the book of Hebrews in a type see three and a half three years and a half down there lying in the word and finding out that the very God that called him was taking him back and changing all of his intellect changing all all that he ever thought all that he had trained to be all his Ambitions just wiped it away from him and he become a prisoner the love of God had been so tremendous and such a revelation that he could not get away from it just think of it Paul sat there and and and God was revealing this great truth about who the Lord Jesus Christ was the great truth being revealed to him and he said the love that God would reveal to me this great truth he just sat there could you imagine as his eyes were being opened and and here he's killing the very trying to wipe out the very Jesus that you know everything became vice versa yeah but he wasn't down about that he was rejoicing in it amen just think how would you like to went down there and finally got to the end of the road and find out everything you did was really contrary to what you really wanted to do but to have his eyes open was just a blessing to him he was so thankful that he could see he said it was the love of God he said and that's the true experience of every real believer who meets God you come in contact with something that's so great that you become a prisoner to everything else see you get away from everything and imprison yourself to this amen when we saw Jesus standing in his word in this day putting his foot on the land and the Sea taking the book opening the seals revealing himself in the church ages and all the third pole that was revealed to us we just sit back and go praise God Amen this is wonderful that's the joy of our heart you know it's not the battles we have in the flesh that's not what Thrills us but one day we'll be free from them but it's the the revelation of God's word that's why he told Peter he said Peter who do you say that I am and he said Thou Art the Christ the son of living God he said Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to you but my Father which is in heaven this is what I'm going to build my church on I'm going to build my church on God revealing himself in his word word and then just think when he does that for you that's what makes you the church you can keep all the rules just so perfectly but it it'll never do you I guess any good or it won't bring you the joy that real Revelation brings you I that just Thrills your heart do that this makes you so happy he says you imprison yourself to this it's expressed one time where Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man buying pearls then when he finds that Pearl great Pearl he sells all that he's got to get that one and that's the way here now it it something how how brother Ram expresses that that's the way here the way you get here to that perfect joy that perfect peace being empowered by Revelation that's the way you get here you sell everything out for this one great thing and you know it's hard if if you know people that have been in churches for years and years and years and and maybe in a denominational church or uh in a certain fellowship or a certain group and years and years and years every all their friendship all their child friendship all their social life uh everything about the way that they do things they everything they know all of a sudden their eyes are opened and it it's kind of like it's it's taken away from them but they found that which is so precious that they they have to give all that up and they don't give it up with malice they don't give it up with bitterness they follow after their heart praying that God would Open the Eyes of all those that they've been around uh for for so long and and I remember when I first came to the message uh I I wrote the Catholic church and and the bishop and I said take my name off that book I said I don't want no remembrance of me that I ever was an altar boy that I ever did mass that I ever went to Catholic school I said I want my identity sealed up amen cuz I'm taking on a new identity they probably laughed you know but it felt good to me you know and and when you first come into it you know that's that that's when you do you know you just do everything you know what I'm saying I I remember when when lesie got converted it and and of course you know sometimes your Zeal uh outdoes your wisdom you know but she had a complete vinyl set in original form of all the beetle albums you know what I mean probably not worth much probably 50 60 70,000 um but we took it to the dump cuz it had no value to us you know what I me and she'll kind of Raz me every now and then you know he said we could have got this if he didn't throw all my Beetle out away you know and and uh uh and I remember I had a a portrait that artist painted of uh Bob Dylan on my wall and he painted it right on my wall of my house um and uh so when I got rid of I was going to paint over it and he said please don't paint over it so he went and they saw my whole wall out cut the sheetrock and everything and that thing sold for lots of money you know what I mean but you wanted to pay the price whatever it took there was nothing that compared in value to this word and you know we heard that we we listened to choosing of the bride and man we sold everything we had we had antiques we had everything and we bought a school bus and a few bags of beans and and got in the school bus and off the Montana we went and uh you know John knows about California you know uh there was a movie when we were growing up we were Surfers and it was called Endless Summer and and the guy that filmed it and the Surfers and everybody in it all John's friends and buddies and and uh but you know when when we we heard that California we believe what the prophet said so we sold everything we had and got in a bus and drove to Montana again Zeal outd does wisdom you know what I mean I I didn't know Arizona was so close but I took a detour up through Montana and ended up in Arizona anyway but uh uh that's that's just what you do you know what I mean you're so glad you see aren't you glad you see I mean could you imagine sitting under the deception of Trinity Doctrine or under the deception of what the evidence of the holy spirit is or under the fear of of of of a certain Ministry that that you're so terrified of it you you know what I mean that uh uh if the phone rang and it's the pastor you sit back and you say oh no what did I do you know what I mean and it's not what you did the pastor dialed the wrong number you know what I mean but you you you get the Willies because of it you know what I mean can you imagine being free from all that at peace in your heart peace that you that nobody can take away from you a peace that Sur paaths understanding a rest because you found the truth arrest that you have an absolute all the men and all the preachers can argue but you've got a place you can go to you can read it for yourself no big eyes no little 's it's yours and if you're old enough to read you're old enough to read and you're old enough to read amen it it and he promised that if you would search the scriptures that you would find him in there and he'd speak to you and it's a living fountain that comes out of this Bible you can underline one scripture and underline it and un and go back and read it again and and you have to go get a different color marker because now it means something new to you you know and and pretty soon you you've underlined and marked that scripture so many times it's a fountain of Many Colors and that's what the Lord is he's a great Fountain of Many Colors he's just a wonderful and so he that's what he said he said he says that's that's the way here you have an intellectual conception and you have a theological experience but when it comes to a time that when you really find the real thing you just sell out everything else and you close yourself into this Amen in other words you you shut out all the voices and everybody that I've seen that's left this message it's because they never saw Jesus Christ in it they they never saw actually saw him in there that it was him and they opened themselves out up to other voices and and after all the years of listening to the message that's exactly what he said eve fell by was by reasoning and here they let a voice come along and speak to him them and they start reasoning and and and they've been taught All Through the Ages that that's the problem right if you've got the Revelation you didn't come to that Revelation yourself it was given to you by God it's been prove to you you don't need nothing else on that one basis you accept everything that said amen and he just keeps it grows you just there's no no room you just don't have room to hear anything different because you're sold out and that's what's what's so beautiful he says you're sold out to this and then he he went on he said and today is Servants of Christ we become harnessed hooked up we can't go we're logged in with it harnessed to the word no matter what anyone else says you're harnessed to it there is something about it that you just can't get away from it you've been yolked up with it by the Holy Ghost has yolked you to the word no matter what anybody else says it's the word it's always harnessed up with it there's always harnessed up with it put in the Yoke with it the word by the spirit he has harnessed amen I like that don't you so much and he says and we find now that's where we find mind today that we must be stripped first and people don't want to be stripped the mess brother wants to hold to a little bit of his Methodist teaching huh the Baptist brother wants to hold to a little bit of his Baptist teaching see but you've got to be absolutely stripped of everything and just born again aresh and take up from there let the Holy Spirit lead you can't say well now my daddy said when he got in and went to church and shook hands with the pastor he was a good loyal member that might have been all right for his race but we've but but we're another race in other words you run the race that's set before you we have a different course to run in our age we're not running the course of any age the Pentecostal age the Methodist age any the age we have a whole brand new path for us to be led down and he elected the people to go down this path and and when you realize it's him and it's him that called you it settles it down the road you go Hallelujah you know what I mean you you you don't you don't care where it's leading you because you know the road's right amen you know and you know every other road goes off the cliff you might not be able to see tomorrow but you don't need to know tomorrow the evil of the day is sufficient thereof you just take this road you're on it you know it's him you know he's leading you you know this is a go you don't know where it goes but you don't you but you know it's the right Road and you're just not looking for a way to get out that's right amen you're want to Lord Keep Me on it you know just keep me safe and then he says that he says he says uh and you say it's all right he says but that's another race now we must come back back to the Bible times for this day amen so that was that was kind of what we're we're we're talking about this morning Paul had such a revelation that this was God that it yoked them up to him and so we talked about Paul then brother Bram he he closed out how that we've got to be born again how we've got to uh God's looking for prisoners that's what he's looking for he's looking for people that have the same experience that Paul has that sees the word knows the truth knows the path and on it 100% not listening to any other voices where it goes I go wasn't that what Elijah said he said wherever you go I'll go I'll be with you I'm not going to leave your side amen he knew that there was no other Fountain out there and he stuck with it so sold out to it that it was passed down to him isn't that the promise of the church The Works that I'll do you shall do also isn't that the promise of the Bride that the bride and the word will become one well it that Union is not going to take place until the bride quits flirting with anything else out there that's right no moves of the spirit no uh seemingly great revivals no other voices no other teachings they've got their absolute they've got their voice they're sold out and when and when they totally sold out then they'll become one and when they become one they'll they'll have the works for our age a living Bible for our age so he talked about Paul doing that and and uh being totally sold out just and and just separating and keep cut and loose until everything's cut loose and so we we listen to Paul's testimony and now we're going to pick up on page 118 ver I'm sorry um paragraph 118 page 17 and he's going to start talking about Moses and other great uh uh great uh uh Bible characters that sold out for this gospel and uh and then I believe we have another baptism after service but I kind of want you to just to um just from an experience standpoint to listen how brother brandom closes his Services no you know even after some of the greatest sermons that brother brandham preaches the close of brother brandham Services is all very simple you know and um and and it it just I just want to throw that out there to for it to be noticed you know I'm not criticizing how anybody Clos services or how we close service I know we like to sing and we like to worship but uh brother Brandon was a very matter of a fact type person I just thought you might want to just think about that a little bit and uh uh cuz sometimes people feel that if you don't have a great big close out you haven't had a service amen the servic is before the close out you know what I mean uh but anyway uh Lord bless you I'm glad you're here and those of you that have come out tonight I hope that uh listening to the voice of God for this age a real Prophet a real angel amen one that had the ministry of the son of man in other words a man that had the ministry of veiling deity may you enjoy his words tonight and and so uh you can read along so God richly bless you our Prophet the servant of the Lord William Brown Moses know that he was born to deliver he knew that and did you notice with the ambition that Moses had knowing his mother had told him over there she was his nurse maid no doubt when Moses the little baby was born that his mother said you know Moses when your dad amran and I pray constantly we know what he's seen in the word it was time for the coming of the deliverer and we pray Lord God we want to see that deliverer one night the Lord told us in EP visiion that you would be born and you'd be delivered we mustn't play to the king's commandment we didn't care what the king said then we know that you were born a deliverer now Moses we know that we could bring you ight I remember they've been down there 400 years in Egypt see and we we wanted to get you the the right thing the right education a right train so I took you and put you in a little Ark and set you out into the KN and how strange that the C taking that little Ark down through the Reeds and rushes and brought it right down miles away and turned it right into Pharaoh's Palace where his Pharaoh's daughter was uh where the bathing pool was and how that that I know that she need a woman to raise you and in them days of course they didn't have these BLS to raise the babies on so they have to have a wet nurse so and Mar him I S her down and she stood there and she said well I know where I can find a wet nurse and come and got me and Moses the doors are all shut honey you're 16 years old now and you're going to be Pharaoh's son and someday you're going to be the deliverer that's going to take the people out of here Moses Ambitions begin I'll study mother I'll study everything I can you know what I do I study how to be a military man and I don't know how to take these people out of here I'll be a great General Bishop so I know how it's done and I I'll take it out I'll get my PhD L I'll do it my father of sh if you ever ready Fook all right he's going to deliver all the Protestants you know need to come with himself so this great priest years ago father chin you to get his book read call him father and just brother chin what it was we don't call no father like that so we find it that we uh he's going to read the Bible so we can get out there and just through the pr of religion big all Catholic read the Bible the Holy Spirit come upon him he got the Holy Ghost hallah become one of so then notice this that Moses got all the training because he he knew he was so smart so educated and so intellectual there was nobody he can even teach the Egyptians he could teach the psychologist he could teach their the generals what military might was so he was a great man and people fear M because of his greatness so was such a scholarship mind he was Bishop like a pop he was a great fell and he was a a mighty man and he know that he was BL to do this and have trained with great Ambitions to do it just like today I don't say that man training in these schools I don't say that like you're out here in the west now they going to build 150 million uh School of Theology see Pentecost a $150 million school to me that should be missionaries in the field but whatever what do they do when they come out of there what are they bunch of Ricky just did that and then that's how they come out was always have the rest of them and that's the same line see now we find out that when uh Moses in all his training and they with all the training making big Bishops and so forth the great High Ambitions what do we do our Ambitions become just about like what Moses was see God before he could get the man in his hand he had the stripping of his ambition he had to stripping of all his training he did go out and he delivered he killed one Egyptian and he uh and when he did he found out that he was in the wrong he couldn't do that it wasn't that way and God had to take him out into the Wilderness into the desert a desert place you notice kind of strange how these Fells that God got a message for them he takes them into a desert he took Paul to the desert to train to tell about all this great vision walked out into the desert go out to a certain desert and he stayed there until God fully made know him what to do and M his time he took him out in the desert kept him out there for 40 years and stripped him of all his Theology and all his ambition oh what a time that he could look back and see his failure and how we tonight ought to do the same thing when we see our ambition look at the healing campaign as soon as the LA did something a few years ago to start restoring healing to the sick and so forth everybody every organization because it didn't come into their organization they had to get them A Healer and what have we done let's look at it just a moment we have done the same thing that Moses did we went out and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of America I smell a disease I I got blood in my hand and a manufactur a miracle Lord help see and what have we got some of the men in such large streams has broke up and become regular drunkers no and got the minds that switched all the way back to from the Pentecostal objectives back to making organizations and things again see what have we done through about one Egyptian yeah that's right and we tried we strained we paid we've labored all night long with pray meetings so we had no bi and and try to manufacture something soup up something and all these kinds of things and find it to be a total failure we here going back to the desert amen help yes sirs and struggles why I just give up amen that's what you ought to do amen go back and give up what we done the same thing they did same thing Moses did it doesn't do any good after 40 years he found himself a prisoner to the word of God what are we trying to do when the great blessing come out and the manifestation of all these great things that God has told us about how that we must be born again how we must receive the Holy Ghost the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and all these things here you see people instead of staying to that word harnessed to it what do they do they started with their own denominational Theory which has already failed and try to manufacture something to look like the truth oh help I better cut off right now see I'm I'm sure you're wise enough to know what I mean see but why look what it's done think of it what have we got tonight but a a a nation full of organized people who deny the scriptures of God Amen who would call the the the light of the holy spirit that it was a a mental tathy who would refuse such to come into their church and they wouldn't permit you to mention one more of C conceed eternal security and the things that the Holy Spirit has revealed and proved to be the word challenge after challenge to come what have he got the same thing that Luther had the rest of them see slew an Egyptian what was why was it maybe made some man start stop stealing or maybe live true to his wife but what did you make him out that a church member come and join our group see that stinking dead man was the only thing he app his fingers to of his success of 40 years of training a stinking Egyptian laying there rotten and dead that's about the way it is tonight only we can point to this rev this crossover soall is a stinking bunch of church members that knows more about God than a h all about egyp KN that we tell about the word of God that say I don't believe that I don't care what you say I don't believe it amen that's a an awful thing to have to point back to for all the streams and struggles and everything we got maybe we could point to a big school but it's dead amen we could point to an organization but it's dead it's stinking it's just like the first thing that we pulled out of like a going to water and a dog to his b we return back one dead Egyptian no doubt but somebody says Moses why hey you got no more feeling for the people you was called somebody that know Moses know he was called for that you lost the feeling of the people mess her well why aren't you out on doing this why aren't you trying this why don't you goong with the rest of Moses is out there getting stripped I he had an experience with the burning bush that declared the word I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I remember my and I've come down to deliver and I'm sending you to do it that he seen the word not the ambition of the people or the desires of the people then what did he become he did not want to face the Egyptians anymore he didn't want to face this thing anymore but he become a prisoner years old stri down but then he become a prisoner at the burning bush the mighty Moses with all of his intellect the Bible saying Moses is a Mighty Man man in word or In Deed down in Egypt but watch what the mighty Theologian did in the presence of the burning bush he only confess his inability amen when he seen the genuine purpose of God he confessed that he was in ability to do it yet he was trained in all the theology that they could give him amen trained in the best school but just what can he do with that P hanging out [Music] Lord who am I that I should go get your shoes off Moses I want to talk to you get yourself down even your shoes you're fall on the ground again I want to talk to you couldn't even talk I a elected prisoner a elected Prophet just like Paul was elected Moses was elected deliver and then finally God had his elected subject a prison to him Hallelujah he can only move as the word of God moved who TR to say that me I am how I do I'll be with you yes Lord just as you say here I am oh my he's a prisoner he goes against his better thinking now if been train the command arm are swords up about the go CH all in order spear forward charge that's how he's going to take it over that was his chain but he said why I'm going go to you what you got your hand am a stick God does think so Rous sometimes to the human mind got a stick in his hand Whiskers hanging down 80 years old wife on mule

got one commiss stand before Pharaoh but this s God's that you'll provide the next thing after do this only got one thing to do the first step like surrender a prison don't think of yourself of something else become a prisoner Moses become a prisoner confess he couldn't even talk finally when God got him in his hand where he can only move for God moved for he told him the word he know it was the word then he submitted himself to the word and the Holy Spirit there God harnessed Moses to the will of God that's the same thing he done to Paul that right amen he harnessed Paul little crooked do sarcastic juice all with PhD and lld all over but he said I'm going to show him what he's going to suffer for the Lord's sake and and then Paul sitting there and seeing the word and seeing that was Jesus then he raise up his hands and become harnessed to him the love of God harnessed him to the word hallelujah he's going to Bear my name before the Gentiles there he went Moses I the god of your father I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob I remember a promise and the time of the promise is near and I see the afflictions of my people I remember my promise and I have come down to Hornish you you know what the word says now Hornish you to go down there horish you with power to go down there and deliver the people I think got stick your hand as a witness course you've seen a miracle done by it just like David with a slingshot harnessed himself and he went down finally God had a man that was subject to him Hornish to him and could not move until the word of God moved if people just do that today then he was his prisoner a prisoner of Love yoked up in the bond of love with with God as Paul was yoked up in the bond of love to God just like Paul both of them trained the same way Moses trained you know to deliver the children of Israel by military M Paul Cain to take them out of the hands of Romans and but them free by great ecclesiastical force in the world that day great schools of training come up under Gia and both of them went to the desert come back different man of them Father and both of them Prophet that right both of them prophet and they both was T to by the F of fire exactly right coming for deliverance there it was went to the desert left their homes and went to the desert to find out left their peoples and everything to find the will of God Amen see they were trained in one way God changed them to another and they had to become a complete prisoner to not act in the way that they wanted to act but act in the way that God wanted them to act he's the same yesterday today and forever have we got another 10 minutes I real quickly get to another character I see one before me now his name is Joseph he was an elected son he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ he was born a prophet he's a prophet also see and now he could see vision and when he's young little boy he saw a vision of himself sitting on the throne and his brothers D but what he would kind felt like he's a great guy see all of them but what did God have to do he done the same thing that he did to the rest of them because Moses was a deliverer Paul was a deliverer and how Joseph was a deliverer he saved his people from the fam what did God ask to do to him but he been prison right straight to the prison yes sir remember he was stole by his brother to an Egyptian and they sold him to poner and a poner uh give him a little bit of Liberty and uh first thing you know that was taken from him and they is set in the prison crying crying God had the stripping now notice but all all the time I believe he in that prison he can remember that the vision said that he's going to sh on the throne and his brothers is go to B because he knew that his gift come from God and he knew that it was had to come to pass if we could only keep that in our mind according to the word of God this say he's going to have a church going to have people and these things that he promised he's going to do them he's say one am and we're living in the time prise the Lord we're there amen he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners now locked in with him you heard that song you s and then I'm going to shut in with God I want to be shut in with God now where I thought about this being shut in with God nothing else you only move and God says move you only do as God says do then you're shut in with God now remember he was thinking he also became a total failure to himself all that he knew all that he understood and everything he become a total failure it didn't work he was put under a situation to that nobody would listen to him he was a prisoner see he was put into a situation that unbelievers would not believe his ministry was the matter the people turn their head they wouldn't pay no attention to him in prison what good bu's Ministry do he might stand to the prison bar and preach for him they walk on down the street see but he become a prisoner God a prisoner until the wheel amen GL Hallelujah faure finally God came to him in his prison like Paul like all rest he came to him and he used the gift that he had given him to get him out of there that's right he brought him from his prison what did he do as soon as he brought him from his prison he was get power amen by the king his King that he set on the side of that he was under he was brought from the prison house and given power to whatever he said had to [Music] happen conly remember he was born for purpose he was going to set King and all the rest of us going to need to him his vision told him so but before his vision could be completely FF he had become a prisoner then become a ruler and when he come from his prison house and become a prisoner of the word of God that he can only say what God said he his not to say then God move through hallelu Lord had power to b f all will yeah you say to this mountain Hallelujah you had power to bind pharoh's prin whether they were deacons or prors or whe state representatives or whatever you want I bu you they were that it he can do it in his own way pleasure to God Hall oh I just got about three more minutes I keep my word now we find out that he he become a prisoner to God from the prison to the world from Paul the same way and Moses the same way from a prisoner to his own thinking to a prisoner to God and when he come out he had the power of God and when he become part when the own thinking of Moses he was surrendered it and stri of it he become a prisoner to Christ word can only move whereever you say Christ he has se the repo of Christ greater Treasures than that of Egypt so he was a prisoner of Christ just like Paul was remember all three of them were pets yeah see and they had to be sick of their own thinking and order to become a prisoner to the will and the ways of God now we remember now that he had power to bind at his own word he had power to loose at his own word he can say I loose you in the name of my king amen hallelujah pH made Joseph his son Christ makes his prisoners of love his son and he gives them power the same thing he St John 14 PA he that believeth on me the the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do now the prisoner of the love of Christ becomes empowered by his King who is Christ amen and very I say to you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you'll have what you said amen if you abide me and my word and you if you're y to me because him and his words are same in the beginning word words with God the words made bless same Yer forever if you abide me not here and there abide me in my word in you ask what you will or say what you will amen he had power notice the come out he had to be taken out and shaved a few things had to be shaved off before he can meet his King oh God sometimes pies people out like that and shaves a few of their own Wills off shows them that they can't do this what they wanted to do you know what I mean they're not they're not Liberty to do what they want to do before they can come into full power and be a l slave to Christ they have to be shaved off and presented sometimes he take them to the desert to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained them to be Hallelujah see what I mean Brothers we're at the end time remember all other times what he's done he's always had to take a man and make him a prisoner to him forsake his own he had to forsake everything that he know forget all the trainings and everything in order to know the will of God and to follow God he can't follow anything that man's got to do and God the same time it's too contrary one to another you can't be going east and west at the same time you can't be going uh right and left at the same time you can't be doing right and wrong at the same time you can't be following man and God at the same time no sir you either following God or following man now then if you are following God and have submitted yourself to God then you become a prisoner to that God to that word to that will no matter what anything else is you become a prisoner to it listen we're at the end time and I would say this with reverence and respect as a last couple minutes is floating by look what God in my opinion will do and must do and will do in this last day is to find the tool for the heart you's got to find the tool to trace the for any farmer when he goes to his Harvest he has to have a tool to do it with you got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to thrash out the Grain and the Harvest is right God take it in your hand make a bond Serv of your love and use the for to to bring the realization to this sinful cursed Earth that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever for myself God let me be a prisoner if all my brethen turn me down if all my friends turn me down I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and his word that I might be harnessed to his word by the Holy Spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the word of God be confirmed by the same things that he said would be done I want to be a prisent of Jesus Christ let us pray I wonder tonight with our heads bound if that ambition that we have of being something else or maybe a something that we might think be a selfish thing wonder if we couldn't just kind of laid that aside yeah I wonder if some young boy here tonight look around and say I'm going to be when I get big I'm going to be a certain certain thing I wonder if you can feel the will of God move in your life and say no no my ambitions are lost now for the last few days the Holy Spirit has been speaking to me huh I want to yield myself to God to be a thr instrument of this last day some young girl that might have Ambitions of her fine lady character or maybe a be a pretty little Ms or maybe someday make Hollywood your career I I wonder if you're not willing now to submit your Ambitions in the presence of God in his word hear the call of God in your own [Music] life God knows who you are I wonder if to be a minister clst or a servant a work or somewhere in church I just sitting here once in a while I don't know one third of the people sitting here tonight but I just little handful that's here but I wonder if there' be such a person that you'd be willing to say I don't care what anyone says I'm God's slave now I I'm going to preach his word regardless I don't care what my my organization turns me out I'm still going to stay that word I'm going to do my will is God's will God's will is my will I'm going to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ by Grace and help I'll good it think of it while we have

what that he wanted us to make us was tools for the Harvest tools for the Harvest I just think that's so wonderful and I made a little note here he said now notice but all the time I believe he in that prison he could remember that vision and said that he was going to sit on the throne and his brothers was going to bow to him because he knew that his gift come from God and he knew that it had to come to pass if we could only keep that in our mind according to the word of God that in these last days he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these thing had that he promised

be done will your will be done in your bride that she would become one with you in the works that you did that she would do also and father we believe that in our heart but we've heard today by the preaching of the word of God that it takes a surrendered life it takes a life yolk to the word it takes full obedience to every word of God and it'll make every believer and every obedient son and daughter of God it'll turn in them into a tool for the kingdom and that's our heart's desire tonight that we might be tools for the kingdom of God we ask that you'd Grant these things in Jesus
