========================================

man's forefather and that's what thrills our heart we ask you to bless us this evening as we have this little time of fellowship waiting for our campers to arrive or we just ask that you bless us now in jesus precious name we pray amen and if you have your bibles let's open back again to the book of luke the gospel of luke the 46th verse of the 24th chapter and just a little evangelistic thought for this evening just to abide our time and rejoice in god's word so the 46th verse it says and he said unto them now we know that this is the story of the two disciples walking back from on the road to emmaus and and so they're on this journey and they're talking within themselves and then all of a sudden a stranger pulls out beside them and and we notice there's several places in the scriptures that they they looked and they didn't know him when he stood on the bank when when they were there they looked and they they didn't know him they didn't know who he was and now here's again uh this is a place that they didn't know so we know that there had to be something that he did that opened their eyes and so uh so now we're gonna build on that a little bit and he says and he and he said and then he opened 45th verse then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold i send the promise of my father unto you but carry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye are endued with power from on high and he led them out as far as bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he he was parted from them and carried into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen amen god bless you may see that seated and so if if i had a little title uh just for us to have a a a good time in the lord i i would like to uh uh title this um this the the other part of easter and so i and i say it from this standpoint from the aspect that easter had to have two parts uh it uh so there had to be something that went with it and so jesus in this part of scripture he points out the two parts that were there that were necessary for easter really to be completed and so we noticed one that there in the uh the 46th verse and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove christ to suffer and derise from the dead the third day so the first part of easter was the event itself so the event had to take place it couldn't be something that was prophesied about in the prophecies and in the scriptures it couldn't be something that was written that people could look and still be looking for to come to pass and that's what we have we have the jews today are still looking for the word of god to come to pass they they haven't recognized that it's come to pass therefore they're still looking and their whole their whole approach is speaking about something may that may happen in the future but so the event had to take place that was the first part of the event of easter now the second part of it is that he said to them ye are my witnesses so in other words the event wouldn't be any good it wouldn't have accomplished anything it would have not been beneficial in any way if that was the end of it he rose from the dead nobody knew you know what i mean it that in this story we wouldn't be here today if part two didn't take place you know they have uh they have these uh epoxies uh you know you've seen them in paints and different things they have part a and part b and without part a doesn't work if it stands alone and part b doesn't work if it stands alone they have to be mixed together to produce the results now i hope i can i just want it to be simple but i want you to to to realize that that the that easter and the resurrection couldn't stand alone by itself it had to be witnessed no the part b or or the other part of of the easter or of the event was that there had to be somebody to spread the news and we find out that's why in the scripture that jesus commissions them to go into all the world and to spread the news that that because the the resurrection and easter as unbelievable as the event was if nobody ever heard about it if it was never shared it was never brought out if if it would it just remained uh an event that had transpired yet we have this saying if if a tree uh falls alone in the woods does anybody hear it but think about this he broke this down into two parts that he was going to rise and then he was going to have witnesses and so we're talking about this he says now he says now he wasn't just going to send them out as witnesses to tell a story all right so you come up to somebody and i come by you your your workplace one day and i say hey such and such rose from the dead well you would say well i don't even know who you're talking about and and second hand i don't even know whether that's true or not you understand he wasn't going to send them out with the fable he wasn't going to send them out with a a story he wasn't going to go ask them to share something that was so incredible that nobody would believe it we saw in this morning's message that the boy that received this site from youth they wouldn't believe that they had no record of it they had no proof of it and there the only proof they had them was the witness the person that actually the the the healing power of the lord jesus touched he was the only one that could be the true witness in other words they could have looked at the parents and said boy he been faking you out you just thought he was blind he just acted like he was blind they could they could have said anything else they wanted but the the person that had received the miracle was the one that was testifying to the miracle therefore that miracle now no longer was just a story but that miracle was living in flesh so there was the very recipient of the miracle standing there so we see that jesus wasn't going to ask them to fulfill part two in any other way but a supernatural way because if the event was supernatural you understanding then there had to be a supernatural element of the witnessing of it else you're just talking about somebody that did something right right and that wasn't going to go very far that wasn't going to move people why they had already had in the scriptures several people that rosed up and claimed to be the messiah and carried this person away and that person away they're they're already it was all kinds of uh i i don't have a better word to call them than than cons you know just uh people who had went out and conned people we we did it every day at at uh welcome back everybody every day at uh the church here there's somebody that comes by and and they have they have such a sad sob story and and they're they're looking to uh get a few dollars from the church and and so they they have a hard a story you know and and they're counting on tugging on your heart but so many times it is ingenuine one person come on one time and wanted groceries all my babies are at home grocery i live right close by we uh said fine that's great write us a grocery list give us your address and we'll bring the groceries to you well now there's no evidence of it you understand they don't have anything to back up their story that wasn't it was just a story so it was a story without a story you know it was a story without part b part a was oh i'm hungry and everything part b is that there's something there that witnesses that their story was true and if that person was really hungry and really starving and really want food for their baby they would have wrote out that grocery list and they would have been happy that you brought it to them but if that wasn't their intention you understand if that wasn't their purpose if they had what we would call a scheme or something up their sleeves that they really wanted that money for something else after then the the part b isn't there and the story doesn't stand up so he wasn't going to send them out without part b without the other part of easter because what good would an easter have been if it was just for the one person that participated in the event our gospel would be look what happened to jesus and then all she would have as a moral code but he wasn't going to do that he wasn't going to spread this story he wasn't going to have this if i could use the expression stick right okay have this new stick have this news take hold have this news have an effect so he had to give it something that made it effectual he had to give it something to this news that would show in evidence that it was real now how how is he going to do this he wasn't he's got to get this what he had just done what he had just done he's standing there and look at what he had just done he had just paid the price for the sins of the world just think of that nobody saw that when he was there dying who perceived that that was the lamb of god that took away the sins of the world we already know what they perceived we thought this was he who was going to deliver us from the romans we thought this was he that was going to to to separate us from the bondage that we're in and restore the glory of israel they didn't know they were in an exodus that's what they thought so how was he going to spread this great news what he had just done he had just forgiven the sins of man he had just broken the curse of death he had just demonstrated the power of the gospel and the power of the resurrection the power of the spirit that was in him that's what he said no man taketh my life i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it up again the event couldn't stand on its own the event had to have a witness it had to be testified to and and we could go into many bible teachings about about what a testament is and and how in the old testament there had to be a testament there had to be somebody that testified that the event had taken place testified that that this was their property and and so in fact in the scriptures we even know where the man went and buried things that they could be dug up as a testament so he understood that the event that he had just accomplished the the tremendous things that he had done that they had to have somebody that could testify to it now they saw it with their own eyes so they could believe but his gospel wasn't just for them there's a bunch of gentiles over here that got to get this gospel there's a bunch of sinners so now he's he understands i'm speaking maybe on a narrative from the lord jesus's perspective that he looks out he knows what he's done and now he's got to have these people go testify of it and spread the news now what has to happen that people will believe them in other words nobody's going to believe this story he already knows unbelief is great he already knows that it's going to be all that the father had given him so he knows that he has got to have something that something has got to take place to give the testifiers validity you know that they too have some valid evidence that the event took place because you couldn't go into a courtroom and say i heard so what's he do i like this he says before you can go out and be my witnesses i want you to go back to jerusalem and i want you to tarry because i have a promise of the father i want you to go back and tell you are endued with power from unknown because in other words you go back and you wait for part b and when you get the same spirit that raised me up from the dead i'm going to impart it in you in different measures for different purposes for different places that i'm going to send you i'm going to equip each of you individually with a portion of this resurrection power that you may perform the works that i have for ordained that you should walk in and that's one of the uh things that people miss is that part b is individual and it's personal and it's formulated excuse those expressions just for you we sometimes preach it like it's a one blanket policy fits all why they don't even make hamburgers that way anymore right everything's got to be personalized just the way you wanted i think it was whataburger had 5700 different ways they could make your hamburger so god make personalizes it you understand he's going to give you part b just for you and your personality he's going to tailor make it so it fits you for the work that he has for you to do so you might say well i'm real shy and i can't get in front of people and and i can't testify and you put all our excuses up on the table and he says okay i see all those things i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to give you something that works for you and because i can give it to you and that it'll work for you i can make you a witness and so what does he tell him to do he says he says he says now it behooved me that this event take place and the reason this took the event took place because the event had to take place before you could be witnesses of it the benefits had to be displayed in other words i had to prove personally to you that the product works you know how many people they always hear the same i mean you won't take a medicine a doctor wouldn't take how'd you like to be in the office and the doctor comes up and says now here i want to give you this shot he said no i personally wouldn't take this shot myself you know what i mean because you know i'm not so sure of the side effects you know well you're not gonna take something right that the doctor wouldn't take but when the doctor tells you you know i i in fact i was sick one time and i had to get well and the doctor says i'm telling you i'm gonna give you something that i don't prescribe to any other patients he says but this is what i take myself buddy i said bring it on that's what i want to make me better i want what you got well now when i go to the doctor i don't even wait for them i say what do you take [Music] i want the drugs you use don't give me nothing that you won't use i don't want no second-hand experience i want someone to give me something that they've experienced themselves [Applause] so he already showed he took the medicine that's right that's right he already went to death he didn't have to they didn't have one thing that they could mark them with who of you can convict me of sin there wasn't one thing labeled anywhere one thing that that they could testify even brought in liars to testify to but he had to go prove that what he had could raise him from the dead he had confidence in what the word said he was he said for this cause i have come into the world that i might lay down my life for my own and that if i lay down my life for my own they will not have to taste death because i tasted death for them so what does he do so we understand he proved the event was true he proved that what he had was valid but in order to spread this news and that's what we're talking about because easter without the spreading of the news is uneffectual it only remains for one man but his resurrection wasn't for him it was for us he didn't even have to die but he laid down his life so now what's he going to do he's going to say he says that repentance and remission of sins this is the 47th birth should be preached in his name among all nations so i went to the grave and i rose again so that repentance and remission of sins could be preached to all nations now can you how is that going to work i'm just going to walk up to you and say guess what you need to repent gotta look at you for what why i like what i'm doing and who are you in the first place to tell me to repent i know you so there he he was going to have to give these witnesses something to witness with that's the trouble too many today's witness something that they don't even know what they're talking about brother branham talked about those choir members she sang and squeaked something you know what i mean he said it was the most horrible awful sound he ever heard because they were preaching and singing about something they knew nothing about there it is he wasn't going to do that to his own because the scripture said he loved his own till the end is that right and so what was he going to do he says now litmus he says begin of him and ye are witnesses of these things but he says do something first behold i send you the promise of my father upon you but terry in the city of in jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high that's part b is power from on high he said go there because it's it's not just going to be a story right it's not going to be a guess what hey guess what remember that guy in jerusalem yeah he rose from the dead oh can i see him no he went up into the sky oh okay prophet if god said this in the tape we just listened to he said if you didn't have something to witness they would think that you were insane you're just telling a story it's like any other story but he says no this is not going to be it's not going to be something that uh it is just a story i'm not going to send you out there just to get to give a testimony i am going to give you the same power that raised me up i'm going to put it in you in measure custom like i said to you personally that you too can testify that you too have an experience that you're not talking about it second hand you're talking about it because you've got the same spirit that i got go there and wait until you got it because i am not going to send you out there alone i will be with you even in you till the end i will make you witnesses i will make you witness this resurrection not because you saw it but because you too experienced the power i think so many times that we we fail to understand when we witness the gospel that we're not witnessing it from the intellectual standpoint we're not trying to get to man's minds we're trying to get to man's souls we're trying to get to their spirit as we read in in timothy this morning he said every person that's going to go forth and witness my gospel they're going to have a characteristic did you catch it on the tape this morning he says you feel that right now don't you that's him is that right that was him he said that that was uh uh you feel this present it's a real sweet and a real meek and a real humble spirit why could he be that way because he had the goods to back up what you're saying he had the love to back up to be present and and so we find out he he makes this statement he says in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god preventure would give them repentance to acknowledge the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will so now the devil's going around captivating people right is that true it's what he does he's a roaring lion speaking about who he may devour when jesus came who did he go to he didn't go to the religious people he went to those who were in bondage who were broken-hearted to bind up the brokenhearted to to deliver them from devils he went to people whom the enemy held captive that's who he was interested in he was interested in those that had need of a physician that's his spirit because his own were captivated his own were in bondage and so he sends them there to terry because now he's going to give them the portion of the event themselves he is now going to impart to them the resurrection power so they have something that they could testify to now why would anybody want to hear it everything why did why would anybody want to hear the gospel in other words here comes peter out of the upper room he's just been endued with power from on high and these people are are they they think they're drunk because they're speaking in languages that they don't understand but yet there's those there that are understanding them and of course that critic rises to the surface don't ever think you're ever going to do anything for god without meeting mr critic without meeting mr doubt without meeting the old guy who's ready to argue with you you know though you meet them all the time they're going to pull out their bible and they're going to go through their intellectual thing and all you can do look look at them and say sorry buddy you're missing part b [Applause] you don't have anything that makes this stick you don't have anything to prove what you're talking about the very spirit in which you're bringing it in is the very evidence that you don't possess what you're talking about so this spirit on the day of pentecost peter comes out and they're they're they're saying and we're talking about uh if i could say this the other part of easter the other part of easter is god equipping his witnesses that's the other part of easter is him giving them something to witness with go into all the world and preach the gospel right and these signs shall follow them go into all the world and tell them that the resurrection has come and the captain have been set free and and these things will happen you will lay your hands on the sick and they recover you shall lay your hands on the blind and they shall receive their sight you shall cast out demons because when he sent the news out and when he accomplished the event he empowered the witnesses to witness the right thing that's why we played the tape this morning because that was the witness and the proof of the resurrection it wasn't an easter bunny it wasn't a church organization god never chose man to lead his church he chose his holy spirit to lead the church he chose men and women that were endued with power from on high that that power would lead their actions and their decisions that their light could so shine and by their works they would glorify the father in heaven see man didn't make up part b that's the trouble man has chose creeds and dogmas and organizations to witness they've replaced witnessing with programs instead of individual experience they elected a group of men nickelodeons high priest and educated and tuned with doctrines to be those who spread the gospel and they pay them to do it and that's not the other part without part b you can never testify to part a and without receiving it yourself until you knew what you were talking about everybody could see through your story what did it do for you oh nothing i still drink and smoke but i'll tell you something that's really true i still hate half the people on my block i still dry i still try to drive everybody off the road that cuts in front of me oh yeah oh i can see what you've got i want that no there was a whole nother part of easter there's a whole other plan to make easter become beneficial so it had to go beyond something that was more than a story there had to be there there had to be something that showed there was a power that could raise a man from the dead how are they going to believe that a man rose from the dead and that he forgave their sins if they didn't have a power that they could show that proved that this power was able to raise somebody from the dead you couldn't get by with that in the sales world i don't know but i know the first thing like a kirby vacuum cleaner salesman used to do he would go in and take one of your rugs and he'd suck off 10 pounds of dirt out of it and then he'd empty his bag i'd never seen him empty his bag before he went over your carpet but i don't know but they want to prove to you that their product does what it says you know that's why most people don't witness the resurrection they don't witness the lord because they don't possess nothing they've got the story they've got the event and i'm leading up to a quick close here is but they don't have part b they've got part a memorized it's like somebody that goes to mechanic school has never worked on a car they got no experience and he didn't want him to go out there without experience he didn't want him to be testifying about something they didn't have so he's going to do something on their behalf you understand so he's not going to send them out alone to testify i'm going to be with you amen even in you i'm gonna be there and i'm gonna work and so we find on the day of pentecost peter comes out and he says men and brethren these are not drunk if you suppose this is what was prophesied by joel this is a fulfillment of the word they didn't testify about the experience on itself they testified about the experience in the word because the holy spirit doesn't come to testify of itself it comes to testify of him amen they had to it had to bear record to the word the spell give you the spirit but he will bring you in remembrance of all things that i have said amen because faith has to have the anchor place right and the anchor places the word of god so many people try to anchor in a sensation and yet they have that very spirit in them but if they could bring that spirit back to the word the word would bear witness and they would understand what it is they're testifying to so i want to just point out to you just real quick that how he equipped them so they come out on the day of pentecost they say they're not they're not drunk and they go preaching the gospel right the same jesus that you crucified you know god made them both lord and lord he said unto david sit ye here at my right hand what are they doing they're preaching the gospel they're preaching the scriptures they're preaching what had taken place i hope you can tie this these two together with today they're preaching the fulfillment of scripture for their day that's what they're doing because that's what they're commissioned to do he's not out there preaching build an ark he's not out there preaching noah built an ark and and moses did this they're preaching the present day witness of the power and the work that god done in that day and now so they're out there testifying and they're preaching but something takes place their hearts are pricked they're doing what they're commissioned to do go tell right go preach it go share it i'll be with you i've empowered you i've commissioned you so the first thing that happens is is god pricks their heart these people fell under conviction know what it means to have your heart pricked they identified themselves with what they had just done the great lord how many of them actually might have been there and cried crucify him you know we all through our sins cried crucify him because when he went there he went there with your sins you say well i didn't even commit him yet yeah he knew you were going to commit him that's why he took the sins of the world on himself you know that's how just god he is he isn't just just god to say oh i just picked these few he took everybody's sins on anybody could uh had repentance but they just didn't accept it so their hearts were pricked just think of that what a beautiful thing it is to have your heart print the gospel of our prophet went out how many people sat there never recognized who he was never recognized what was transpiring never recognized what he was witnessing that jesus christ was the same yesterday and forever that that there was a ministry of malachi 4 5 that was supposed to come before the end time and that were in the end time you understand when they went out they only gave the hope that people would be raised from the dead again but you understand what you're testifying to you're actually testifying that you're living in the time where you could actually be part of a rapture not the hope that one day your body would come out but actually now you're testifying and saying you know what this world is getting wicked the the the wickedness of the animal rights is fulfilled all the prophecies concerning the end time are coming to pass there's a rapture at hand why should i believe you why should i believe your interpretation of the gospel because he promised to give part b he can't give part b unless they're testifying and witnessing parday if they're not witnessing the resurrection and the life that catholic priest down there who's taking that little round thing up and going he's not witnessing part a that's right therefore he doesn't have part b he the part b is the power that was imparted in the upper room not for the purpose of demonstration but for the purpose of proving that part a the event actually happened and that's what we were talking about this morning brother branham standing there what's he keep pointing to the event happened this is the proof of the resurrection an easter bunny story ain't no proof you think he's going to send them out to share the resurrection without giving them the proof of the resurrection no to every believer he's going to impart to them a portion of it he's going to give them a portion of what he had so they could use it to witness we've got backwards we think he gave it to us as something we as a bomb we could put in our medicine cabinet and every time we're spiritually weak or we sin or reduce something bad we can just go grab a little bit of this powder and put it on us you know no it was to transform us we talked about so god's working on their behalf they're talking about something they're witnessing they're saying god's come and forgiving your sins he's brought to us life that the grave has no victory over us and that's pricking people's hearts so now they're preaching this word so how what do they have so peter goes up to the gate called beautiful right and here's this guy sitting there now we're talking about god had given these men part b to prove that part a exists that the event was true that jesus did raise from the dead and so he goes there and he says silver and gold have i none but i'm going to share with you something i have i was in a room and jesus told me he would send a power in my life that would allow me to witness what has been accomplished in this day i don't have silver i don't have cold he says but in the name of the lord jesus rise up and walk now i want you to notice something go when you go back and read that story they question them and jesus responds why do you look upon us as that we've done this by our own power we didn't do this by our own power we did this because the savior the messiah the one that fulfilled the scriptures he gave us this power he gave us this spirit he gave us this thing by which we did this we didn't do this by ourselves in other words god wasn't going to spread this gospel by word only he wasn't going to do it by word only he was going to do it by power and demonstration because if he was going to witness to a power a power that was so great it could raise somebody from the dead the only thing that could witness to that power was the power itself you know it's like a it would be like a uh a hot air balloon testifying to the sound barrier the only person that could testify to that was a person that did it and i noticed when brother bram said a lot of you grew up and never heard a sonic boom because they finally outlawed them over any residential areas but i've i've heard them boom boom boom it was fabulous i loved it i'd look up for the plane but we always learned that you didn't look where the boom took place you looked about five miles past it because it follows and when you break the spiritual sound barrier the psalmic boom is following you you're not trying to produce the sonic boom you have the resurrection you have the life you're you're testifying to it you're witnessing to it you're telling people that's why he never said go out and produce these signs he says you be a witness and these signs will follow you the church has got way too much in to manufacturing we have a meeting let's manufacture these songs preach the gospel let the holy spirit prick their heart let them go beyond the camp and ask for that experience resurrection to come into their life personally and then go tell the world tell them how your candle got lit tell him all the things that you've read he'll be there he'll stand behind you he'll bear record he'll bear witness don't be afraid to say you know he said that we could lay our hands on the sick and they'd recover i'm not talking about in the church service i'm talking across the lunch table i'm talking at the gas pump i'm talking about you're testifying to something that you possess so he put it on display and and you know and we'll close now because i think you understand what my point is so there's another that was acts uh 4 and 13 where he said silver and gold have a nun but you go over to acts 25 that's another great testimony because here's the disciples they had just done these great works and they told them don't go preach in this name anymore that's what the world tells us don't tell this jesus story no more don't tell this william branham story no more don't talk about these signs and wonders all you would have to do is take somebody and play for them the portion of tape that we played and they would actually have to have nothing in them to believe with not to see the things that were transpiring but we're not looking for them we're looking for those whom god would pre-adventure would prick in their hearts and bring them to repentance and the acknowledgement of the truth that they too could recover themselves from the captivity that they've been put under by satan that's what we're preaching that's the good news there's a power here that can deliver you from captivity that can deliver you from death that can give you eternal life and that's what i'm testifying to and they have every right to look at you and say prove it and you have every right to stand there and say praise god i know what i'm talking about and you start telling him what he did for you and you start telling it and then pretty soon you know that you have it's well have you ever testified to somebody and all of a sudden you feel the anointing just welling up inside you words are coming out of your mouth you know why because you didn't take no thought what to say but the spirit is in you bearing record to the witness that what that we preach that jesus christ rose from the dead is true and he's alive and he's with me and even in me till the end because he does what he says so verse 25 reads like this he said then all of a sudden somebody shows up to the scribes and pharisees and says the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching to the people what were these guys they were witnesses what did the prophet god said in the rising of the son he said they went from cowards to heroes he went from cowards to boldness because they were quickened they received part b part a by itself is no proof i i was visiting with orlando in the parking lot we talked and i says it wasn't that a wonderful easter message he said i am easter and i thought that's right because easter isn't complete without a witness easter wasn't good good if he couldn't transfer the power that rose him up to somebody else that they can bear witness of it if it just stayed in jesus it was a jesus thing this isn't a jesus thing it's a body thing his whole body is going to resurrect he bore witness and he gave witness and he shared the power that the that there would be a boldness to the believer what they testified of and just think of this now in their day they they were talking about life and eternal life and the hope of the resurrection and of the twinkling of in a twinkling of the eye their body would be changed but you know what you're witnessing to you're witnessing the hour of the change not just the imparting of the holy spirit i hope this doesn't but actually the imparting of the resurrection he is not just giving his power to witness but he's giving us the power to translate the power to change that's what was possessed in this message amen it wasn't only part a the witnessing of the promise but it was part b giving the life and the resurrection and the rapture to its pers participants this is something that is is so wonderful that what we're testifying to we're testifying now that through this messenger and through this message and through this opening of the seals and this quickening power that opens the seals that there's now something that god's imparting to his bride that they can testify to and prove by their own lives and their own works and their own approach to life that this event is at hand amen and you too can be a part of it and he will impart to you the quickening power because you're not selling it without demonstration you're not sharing it without proof because you possess it and i'd like to close with this i see some of our people have got back and it says he said if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham's not even thought of and you're not even thought of till we can see jesus glory amongst us see that's our desire that's the quickening give us the quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we are with him bone both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead so you see what i'm saying the same vindicating methods we saw the vindicating methods now that was done in a great group to prove to many beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was a messenger but you have those same those same i like how he says it those same vindicated methods working in you when you're one-on-one you can pray with the person that you're talking about and they can be set free you can lay your hands on the sick people and they could be made well this last thing he said wouldn't be a public show it would be heart to heart faith the faith person to person do you remember in the tape this morning he says nothing's hid for you now because me and you have connected in spirit realm you know if we could connect with people in the spirit realm connect with them feel their burden remember the prophet of god put his shoulder up because see if the guy's coat would fit he put his shoe up he said this is somebody's daddy somewhere this could be my daddy look at the empty look at the personal desire look at the love trying to show that what i've got and he didn't have nothing else to give him so he just prayed for him and his uh eyesight came back is that impossible for you no it won't be a public show because you don't need to give the world a message you need to deliver the message you're commissioned to give and like i said that spirit's tailor-made for your heart for your life for whom you come in contact with because your footsteps are ordered by the lord and you are foreordained to good works we're not trying to clone jesus we're not trying to clone brother branham we're trying to bring part b to the world to show that part a is there so the power of the resurrection and eternal life will stick and he goes on and he closes and so that same vindicated method proves in us that he is now risen from the dead that same vindicated method the same method he used for peter the same method he used for the disciples the same method he used for paul that same method is in you working in you so that you can prove that he's resurrected he says no wonder he said fear not for notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it not i will make it i have already made it i i never made it he made it for me see not me him well brother branham say i don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all i want i'm caring about i just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he is in you see he is in you well then lord if i can get myself out of the way you can manifest might tell how can you do it because you're ordained it's so all the father hath given me will come glory we've got way too much into trying to calm them down someone comes to be prayed for we call them down you witness to somebody you call them down don't you understand that's not how he the church was led he imparted to you the spirit that does the work you're a part of the resurrection you are the resurrection there will be no resurrection without you you are the rapture the rapture isn't for somebody else the rapture is for me and for you and that's what we're testifying to and he uses the same method he pricks the heart of the person you're talking to he allows you to demonstrate what that he did for you and then you can pray and perform the work that their heart is desiring so simple so beautiful but it's the life of the resurrection in the church you testify god will prick their heart you can prove to them by what that he did in you and then you can share that life do you know he said on that day in calvary that he give every believer the power to impart eternal life through god's word remember you're the other part of easter and our easter is the rapture and you are a part of the rapture so lord richly bless you i just thought that easter was such a wonderful day and just to think that he gave us the spark he is the spark he is i am the resurrection in the life no man comes unto the father but by me lord if that's true i need you come into me put the same power in me because if the same power that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal body if it'll quicken your immortal body it'll quicken the mortal body of the purpose that you are witnessing to you love the lord let's stand together i don't know how many of our campers are back but i'm sure they're anxious to get home and eat and have some real home cooking and take showers and and be back to civilization you love the lord tonight let's pray together our gracious heavenly father i like that how your prophet said the same vindicated methods we saw this morning as we played those vindicated message and father how the church and individuals have got away from having confidence in the quickening power having confidence in that what you did for them he will do for others lord having confidence that they can share this that you will stand behind them in their commission that they don't walk out alone but it's you they don't have to call you down because you're there in them father i just hope that it just this evening stir up something within us that recognizes that we are part of that easter as your prophet said the beneficiaries the holder of the abstract he went through so many ways for this message to try to get us to understand that we are possessors of it not going to receive it we already have it and our commission is to share what we have if we don't have it to share lord may we get to that personal private place and ask you to make every promise in the book real to us so we can be true witnesses we can be the second part of easter we ask it this morning or this evening in jesus name god bless you are we using song books did i hear oh it's back up i think songs book services are the best in the world but anyway god bless you we love you be excited for god amen oh we are the generation we're the culmination of [Music] overcoming sin [Music] [Music] generation [Music] the world [Music] the truth will go to every congregation [Music] [Music] will go [Music] [Applause] i know some of you have to go but there are some people this one sister zoe wants to be baptized so we're going to baptize her and if there's anybody else that wants to be baptized maybe some of the other campers didn't get a chance there so matthew and andrew are going to baptize any of those that want to be baptized so you're welcome to stay they're going to prep but if you have to go you know i understand that but if you'd like to stay then you know you never want to refuse somebody the opportunity to do what's right you know i used to think oh they're too young to be baptized and they don't know what they're doing and then when i heard brother branham say baptize him young you know then i it was one of the 9 000 times that he's corrected me in my thinking i wish he was done with me but he's not so anyway the pool's ready it appears [Music] she wants to be baptized too okay i think sister haley of ohana wants to be baptized so anyway god bless you billy you'll sing stay and rejoice we're going to have some baptismals god bless you [Music] we live in the evening time the race is almost true god has chosen you and me there's still a job to do the worst us must prophesy again the message must reach everyone until the last soul has come [Applause] [Music] the world [Music] overcoming sin temptation the [Music] generation [Music] greater easy that is [Music] and [Music] what tells us oh but god has promised us today he's overcome oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] just [Music] me fill my cup again oh heal my heart and make me whole [Music] oh [Music] come and fall afresh on me fill my cup again kill my heart and make [Music] pull your spirit out oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] from me [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] [Music] on me fill my cup again [Music] fill my heart and make me [Music] now [Music] amen i mean if anybody else would like to be baptized just feel free to come forward and amen we'll lead you in the back and we'll get you ready and baptize your man man that's this is what we live for amen amen it's all about the kingdom of garden amen and bringing the souls to the kingdom amen amen hold the strainer [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh is [Music] [Music] amen we have three uh candidates for baptism you know and this is the part i like because when you go to a revival the spirit falls everywhere it falls on the just it falls on the unjust people are healed people are delivered but when you go to water baptism that's you personally going taking a portion of that pillar of fire and bringing it to yourself in your life amen this is this is an individual coming up said i've sat under the anointing my heart was pricked i saw the spirit deliver people and do all types of signs and wonders but now i'm here to possess a portion that lick of fire as we just got done preaching that belongs to me personally and as i said that holy spirit is that quickening power has been molded and created by god to fit you as an individual you say it's the same spirit odds the same fear but it manifests different in you because he's chosen you to manifest it's hope so matthew and i believe brother andrew are going to baptize our candidates and i believe we have feel free to take pictures if somebody has a camera make sure that you can share their baptism with them don't run out for your cameras we have them here but anyway we have a microphone all right hold the knife so she knows and i know right okay god bless you sir um i'm nervous but i'm not i'm always very nervous to talk in front of an audience like this but i don't know why but i'm not nervous at all and i get like really really nervous and i would have like these terrible thoughts in my mind and now i don't have them anymore and i'm just so excited praise god she wanted to be baptized after she heard the word and she saw the effect of the testimony inside of the van the lord moved on our heart to fulfill the word of god and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so we're so thankful that you can have the opportunity to stand before you and and be identified with those in the name of jesus that not only are they identified in his death but in the resurrection praise god i just wanted to read the scripture here in mark chapter 16 where jesus appears to the eleven and he says unto them he says go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe and we have a believer in the water amen these signs shall follow them that believe and so we're just so thankful to be able to fulfill the commission and it says in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what a blessing it is as a body to be able to fulfill the great commission you know we all have a part in this every single one of us and we're just thankful so we just want to read the scripture now out of acts it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and god is not a liar this is a divine promise and we know that the enemy when you come out of this water sister he's going to try to rob you of the word of god you take him back to the word you got a divine promise from almighty god who's never lied and he's never failed one battle he's the mighty conqueror and this resurrection day he proved who he was and now he's going to prove who he is through you and by you being a witness standing in this water is showing that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and this promise is unto you and to your children and to all them afar off even as many as the lord god shall call amen that's why we're here in the water to baptize sister zoya zoe loya amen sister zoe according to your faith we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins that you might be filled with the holy ghost [Applause] oh my praise the lord saints praise the lord this is what it's all about hallelujah praise the lord glory [Applause] god
