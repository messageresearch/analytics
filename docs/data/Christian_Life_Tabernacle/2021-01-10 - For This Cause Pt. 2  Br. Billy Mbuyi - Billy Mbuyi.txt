Description:
For This Cause Pt. 2
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Morning Service: January 10,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

heavenly father before god this morning or that's our hearts desire is to worship you lord god in spirit and in truth lord god we've been given that opportunity lord god in this age to truly know lord god how to worship you lord god what do you expect lord we count that a privilege lord god this morning maybe not take it for granted lord god but may we with all of our heart lord and all of our mind our soul lord put all that we've got into it lord give you give you first place lord god in our hearts lord god this morning i just want to invite your presence lord pray heavenly father lord god that you would just come down lord and we know without you lord god there will be no service worthy lord i just want to invite your presence lord god may you just have your way lord in each heart each life lord those that are listening in and watching lord god via the live stream i pray you be with them lord god this morning for there's a need for healing lord or deliverance lord a closer walk with you lord god we know lord god your fountain will never run dry heavenly father this morning may we tap into it lord god and receive exactly what we have need of just want to commit the service unto you ask it lord god the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen as we get brother mike to come and do our song reading uh we have a quick announcement um sister lester just writes uh the pictures for the directory have been postponed due to the weather so uh i'm sure there will be another announcement made when um the pictures would just resume back so that's what the mic comes good morning and i think we were all struck this week by the scenes that played out in the news you know crowds of people converging on a city and maybe in anger or fear or frustration or hatred kind of screaming and shouting their slogans of support for one thing or another you know or to cry something some of them to fight some of them to do violence or to force their way into government buildings you know i don't know about you but i can't remember a time when we lived in such an hour of demonstration seems like there's almost every week almost every day some demonstration about something going on in the in the world right it's almost like this has been the year the hour the age of demonstrations you know and their voices and their people and their messages and their slogans all trying to influence someone or change something or you know what's interesting is everyone's taking a position where they're all declaring where they stand on something giving voice to their demonstration or who they are or where they stand and if that isn't proof that we live in an hour of demonstration an hour of manifestation i don't know what is you know in each of these if you're not careful we're all not careful it's easy to get caught up in one demonstration or another one cause or another and forget that this is the gathering of the people into bundles and you know the thing is is that it's not just the people in the world that have the right to demonstrate you know the believer the bride has a demonstration as well so if there are so many voices in the world and so many causes and so many things to be demonstrating about you know i think we ought to spend some time paying attention to first of all that we're demonstrating the right thing amen but that also we know what the demonstration of the believer of the sons of god is i'd like to look at that a little bit this morning as we read psalm 100 you know just to look a little bit at the demonstration of the believer you know in psalm 100 is such a short verse or some such a short passage we all know it well but it's interesting is you know first of all if you look in verse one 1 we can make noise too this is our demonstration as we make a joyful noise unto the lord in verse 2 well all those around us might be making declarations about who they serve or who they will not serve our demonstration is this we serve the lord and with gladness not not some man not out of fear you know not out of hatred or mistrust we serve the lord with gladness you know instead of converging on some city somewhere or trying to stand at city hall chanting slogans of solidarity or support instead we come into his presence with singing if you look at verse 3 instead of declaring you know a position with one earthly administration or another our declaration is this know ye that the lord he is god amen amen instead of fretting about earthly rights and privileges that we have to somehow try to protect or champion it says our testimony is this it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are the sheep of his pasture in verse four instead of forcing our way into buildings or neighborhoods to show our support or our opposition it says in verse 4 we enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise you know what's interesting is not just everyone has an ability to enter into these courts you know only those that possess a certain access badge only those that possess that token can enter into this building and no man can force their way in as it says in john 10 he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber and in verse seven verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep you know as david said in psalm 84 10 for a day in the courts in thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather be a door keeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness you know so rather than involving ourselves in earthly demonstrations let's be about the demonstration of the believer let us make a joyful noise unto the lord let us enter into his gates and into his courts with thanksgiving and with praise so let's read psalm 100 together this morning again it's just a short one but you know just a little picture of the demonstration of the believer in this hour of demonstration let's read that together make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pastor enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations amen amen you may be seated let's just sing this song this morning i've been to the water i've been baptized i've been changed amen and i've been to the water and i've been baptized i've been washed in the blood of the land [Music] now my name [Music] is [Music] what a difference it makes when the lord has away all my life praise god has been changed [Applause] i was

them into your hands we commit everything into you lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and ask amen amen amen our god is a good god amen amen let's just open our bibles we're going to let's open first john chapter 3 amen we're happy to be gathered in the presence of god and welcome everyone all our visitors in the house of god this morning pray that god will be your portion amen first john chapter 3 and we start from verse 5 it says and and you know and and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin it says whatsoever abide in him sinneth not whatsoever sinneth is not sin him neither no no none him little children let no man deceive you he that he that does righteous righteousness is righteous and he is and he is righteous and then he that committeth sin is of the devil and the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil amen let's also turn in matthew chapter 10 we're going to read verse 5 matthew chapter 10 and verse 5. it says these these these 12 jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go it says go not into the way of the gentile in the way of any city of the samaria enter ye not by go rider to the lost ship of of the house of israel and then it says as ye go preach saying the kingdom of god is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devil freely filly ye have received and freely give now i want you to see what commission is there given he's even telling them to go and raise the dead and we'll get to that in a moment and john chapter 14 and verse 12. john chapter 14 verse 12 he says verily verily i say unto you says ye that believeth on me the works that i do ye shall do also and greater works than these ye shall do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye ask in my name that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son and if he asks anything in my name i will do it that's his guarantee saying that you go and then when you ask for something i'll make sure it happens amen let's just buy our heads our gracious father we thank you for your word yes you speak to us tonight this morning we commit everything to your hands and us in the name of jesus christ amen yeah you may have your seeds now we i want to just continue on on what we were speaking i believe it was last sunday the the just for for a cause and and and we just want to focus this morning on what the church mission is what is the church mission you know there's a statement perhaps we'll get to it but random says that that the church cannot progress unless you know on what ground you're progressing you cannot be successful unless you know what is it that you're trying to achieve and i want to just say on the outset that the church was not called to progress on the intellectual ground as we read the scripture he didn't tell them go and sit them down and teach them the gospel and debate on what the meaning of the scripture was and then once they understood walk away no paul tells us that the gospel was go to was sent to be preached with power and demonstration and years jesus telling them and you go you ask it says anything you ask i will back it up anything you go and ask i will back it up i will be right there with you you go you just go and preach you just go and do what i ask you to do when you ask and i said i'll ask my father so that the joy may be fulfilled now i was thinking you think about the cause i was thinking about this morning you know you think about the the the the the great freedoms that we enjoy i thought about even what what mike mentioned this morning you think about the american independence uh you you realize that there's been a lot of lives laid down for the cost of freedom in other words freedom is not free something had to be paid somebody had to lay down their lives so we can enjoy the things that we have so we can stand up here and preach the gospel so we can do all those things there was a life laid down and we realized that it's our responsibility to make sure that we keep in the same path and that's why there are laws and that's why there are things to make sure that freedom uh uh it it it's left to be free and i can say in the spiritual sense it's the same way the freedom that we enjoy in christ they are not free that he gave his own life so we may have them he gave her he lay down his own life so we can be free so we can come this morning and worship him he paid for our sins so we can come this morning and enjoy of the benefit of the death that he died and so we can come this morning and rejoice on those things and we realize with that also there comes certain things as a believer that we have to keep in order for the freedom to continue in other words one cannot come in a place of freedom and try to do something that would infringe upon another's rights because then it's no longer freedom it's freedom because everybody has to participate equally everybody has a part to play everybody has something to add so it can keep going on and we are here as part of god's army to keep the army going to keep the freedom going to keep the flag raised and to to show what party we belong to to show a country we belong to to show what part we are having to play in this freedom that god has given us and branham even speaks i was thinking uh he speaks you know even as the scripture says be not conformed it says by be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind so in that sense in other words even speaking and and letting us know according to the scripture we are called in this world that we're living in to not even be confirmed in other words how could you transform how could you change the world that you are sent to change by conforming to what they are doing how can you affect the world that you are sent to affect by conforming to its laws and to the things that they are doing is saying that you have to be transformed in other words to bring about the change a change that is happening within you from the kingdom that you've come from in other words for you to show it in the world that you are living in i have to come here and show that i come from a different kingdom i haven't been affected by a different kingdom and those things had to show in the kingdom that i'm living in we are not called to follow after the world we are called to transform it by showing that we've been affected by a different kingdom so but when i'm you know he speaks and i was thinking he speaks here in the message well i believe we read this last time it says it says when you are saved god gives you faith to rise from the muck of the earth so now he here you are in this world and we we know that when we are saved it's not so much that uh we were sinner we were we were bad we were we were devil and then we are changing to god but rather it's a recognition that i've been i i i really don't come from the kingdom that i mean right now it's a recognition that i'm not really what i think i was i am different i've been made different i come from a different kingdom and i've come to the realization of it i've come from god and i'm going back to god you come to that realization when you come to that faith rises up it's not a cocker bird being changed into a grain of wheat it's the grain of wheat that was always weak coming into a realization that i'm not of this world i'm not of the things of the world i'm different and then it says it says faith rises up something rises up within you to let you know you are not what you are doing right now you are not what you are supposed to be this is not what i called you to be now now i want you to think about this because barbara says that we may prove what is acceptable and and perfect will of god now how do we prove to prove is to bring into manifestation to prove is to bring into manifestation it says be transformed so our transformation is to actually bring into manifestation the things that god has spoken about you from the beginning the things which god has created you for the things which god is wanting to see out of you the things which were purpose to be here and do and then he says your faith overcomes the things of the world it says what is your faith your faith is the act that god has did it in you to make you a son of god it says you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith rises up above it amen it says if you don't do it if you don't have any faith it says and by faith you are saved and through grace as much as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have because it dwells because in you dwells the power to make heaven and earth in you dwell the power to make heaven on earth god dwells in you you are a son and the daughter of god amen there you are but your faith says jesus according to your faith be it unto you if thou canst believe all things are possible verily verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be that move and don't doubt but believe believe what you believe believe that what you've said so now here he is saying something within your heart has risen up faith has risen up to overcome the things of the world faith has risen up for you to come to victory faith has come to a place where is providing you the very overcoming power which the scripture tells us that faith it says it's the victory that overcomes the world and i'll say this that faith that rises up to overcome the sin and the lying and all those things it's not just saying for it to stop right there it's sand to destroy the works of the enemy it's that same faith that rises up to overcome the things of the world to overcome the depression to overcome not just for you for your children and for your neighbor for the whole world often time we we i i'll just say this we get restricted when we see it happen within ourselves we get happy and we stop and we think we need something else in order for us to do it for our neighbor no it's the same phrase that continues on why because it's sent and it's given to you to overcome but random says it says well you say isn't the holy ghost circumcision it says yes sir amen is that right it says the holy ghost is the seal is the seal of the living god it's the seal of god's approval of your faith it says ephesians 4 4 and 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of the redemption hallelujah he says now now when you say i've got faith for divine healing something strike you and say move out that's the confirmation that god has received your faith for divine healing that's right when you've got courage to put your faith into action when you when you say you've got faith and afraid to let it to let it go your faith is dead it says but when you've got faith and willing to let it go then god confirming it with a with a science following you'll see your healing that's true when you've got faith so here he is it is again letting us know that there is a need for some action to be followed by the faith that we have there's a need for some belief for something to happen after i've claimed to believe in order for god to follow after that in order for god to come and confirm his word to us you know i was reading you know but branham says on that day of calvary he talks about the very purpose here is christ dying he's saying was so that we can go and preach the gospel and heal the second and then he says raise the dead raise the dead and not not the end of it it says we have to go and impart eternal life and then he asked a question it says you mean a man in part of eternal life he answers his own question he says yes a son of god can impart eternal life so we have to understand this is just bigger than our own selves this is the kingdom of god into action this is the kingdom of god being manifested for the purpose of achieving the purpose why he sent his word he sent his word and he healed them he sent his word he delivered them he sent his word and he saved them why is here to achieve something that he purpose to do since the beginning he continues on now he's comparing uh pentecost versus today says he speaks about when the holy spirit came on the day of pentecost it says they got into action yes when when when his promise was fulfilled when they seen that jesus promised uh what what what that jesus promised them that he would send the promise of the father upon them luke 24 and 49 he says behold i send the promise of my father upon you but but terry he terry terry means pray it means wait terry means wait wait upon wait up there in the city of jerusalem until you're being dude with the power from on high and when it says and when this influence of the holy spirit struck them it filled them they seen the word that jesus promised fulfilled it says now i wonder if it would take the same influence on us this afternoon if we seen that promise to do in the last day the fulfillment of what kind of influence it would have to be to give us it says what all we have seen done in this in the last state we ought it ought to put us into action it shows how to do with reverence and humility it says beyond any shadow of doubt the claim that we have made 30 years ago about the pillar of fire that the camera caught your texas camera card not long ago it says scientific scientific research charted out and all kind of research that could find by the fbi and it says it took in texas for a texan it said when you see the sign it cannot be disproved it's true but it says but will you believe the voice that followed the sign the sign is scientifically proven now someday when jesus returns and catches the people all the way there you are you will make it known too notice the pillar of fire should put us into action as the pillar of fire vindicated his promise in the last day jesus said it comes from god and he goes to god when he was when he would he says and what he would do in the last day and here it is both scientifical and spiritual in the word proves it it says that he becomes that he comes that he comes from god and still remains the same he is still god for the promise of the last day it should put us into action signs of his coming at hand jesus says it was the it was the sodom it was the sodom just before the world could burn the gentile this would return and it should influence us and put us into action too when we see the word fulfilled when the promise when he what that what he promised it should put us into action i i want to ask you today even this morning that we we look at the the very message or the revealing of the word that we have received at the end time we but one of this year taking the day of pentecost and saying here they are in the upper room and and they were there waiting for the promise to be fulfilled and when the holy spirit fell on the day of pentecost it propelled them into action that they will go and do the signs and preach the gospel and do those things and i want to say this the holy spirit falling in this generation will not do anything different from what the holy spirit did when he followed that generation and i want to ask you for what purpose did he fall for what purpose was the holy spirit said because remember the promise of joel that i will send off my spirit because what one of them tells us that all that god was important to his son but then there comes at the end time all that god was all that jesus was he's pouring into his body into his church for what purpose when we we see the revealing of the son of man when we see now remember we are here sitting here today with the understanding that this message was not just talking about taking us back to pentecost but he actually vindicated something that has never been done before where a man is being returned back to adam where we see the very animal fall can come back into existence and create something and do something to prove that what god has died for to prove that the restoration message is in action to show that there are sons of god being returned back into that condition of eden where they can speak the word where they can come into action where they can continue the kingdom of the father where they can come to a place where they speak the word and the father honors hear he him he said it takes he gives it to the son whatever the son says the father will follow whatever the son says the father will honor then it just i just began to think within my own heart you you think about this great uh things uh this great message this great things that that the the great revealing of the word the things that which we have received the things which uh uh we have received in this end time what is it propelling within your heart you know there there's one thing i began to think of that oftentimes trips us most of the time you know we each want no doubt here we've been called by a supernatural way you could say well my parents brought me to church and this morning i came because my whole family came but but you have to look at it and understand that god is behind it we we can look at our own lives and and i began to think even while i was a sinner while we were all sinners that things happened that we never understood what they meant you know people said things or or event happened we couldn't put it together but only after we've been converted or after we received the holy spirit then things began to make sense and things you can connect back events and look and say i never understood this and now i look and i i realize why that's happening i realized why this happened when that happened now i and and often time we we receive the message but we keep looking back and looking back to make sense of what happened in the past to make sense of our own lives and i want to say this morning there's a forward looking that we need to also look because remember that all the event that happened in the past that you were trying to make sense of it made sense after you got saved but you got safe for the purpose of going forward for the purpose of you doing something for you to move into a direction for you to achieve something in other words but what have you even said the very holy spirit that we receive it's only the beginning it's not the end it's the very beginning he gives you the holy spirit it's only the beginning so he can drive you into some place speaks about the church mission he says this oh somebody said and i thought this was really profound he said somebody said how many can stand and let it says i says how can you stand and let somebody call you such a bad name it says you don't live for yourself you live for others it says you live for others that you might redeem that man you become a son and that is the trouble of it the church has forgotten they were sons the church has forgottens out there with sons it says you are sons you are taking christ's place you are sons you don't live for yourself you live for others it says well brother branham i can live for the brother because he surely is a nice man he says that's not it live for the man who hates you live for the person who would kill you if he if he could it says that's what he says that's what they done to him they killed him he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get it that's the that's in your bosom that's it says you are facing heaven then but your sacrifice it says but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives it gives its wool you look towards calvary and i thought that's the the very mission of the church but i'm says this and i want to just read this quickly uh before i i forget it says this it says now being that more i said being that this is more or less the message of faith and divine healing he says our first motive on this meeting is to save the souls now i want to ask even as we gather here do we come with that mindset within ourselves that our first goal in gathering this morning our first goal in being a christian is always to have that sensitivity within your heart to have that awareness of our mission everywhere we go and to come with that understanding within us in other words what makes you happy i remember you know being invited to go to a club or to go dance or a dance party and everything and him speaking and i'll just paraphrase it and he says that what makes him happy is to see us all safe is to get down on the knees on an altar with the sinner and pray until the breakthrough and i wonder what makes us happy is it to play our favorite video game or to eat our favorite steak and and to go our favorite place to visit and and to do is that really what makes us happy the church has long forgotten its mission we've gotten into the battle of intellect and and try to present the gospel with just an intellect and go back where he says signs and wonders will follow god is looking for a surrendered vessel someone who realizes that i'm only speaking because i'm sent to speak and i've not been commissioned to back up my own words because there's one behind me who's here to back up the things that i say it says it says to save the lost souls a body no matter how bad they are bread written how sick they are somebody they can die and then he says but if they've met perfectly whole tonight but that soul which is immortal when it's healed will forever live that's what we focus on we focus on the soul we focus on saving the lost souls he continues on in another message he says he says now he says when i think of the the lacking of it the lacking what they're lacking is is there's no soul travail people are not broken up enough there is no burden seemingly and they give me and then he says and you give me somebody that's so tore up about the lost souls that they just cry and are wanting a revival so bad till they can hardly eat just simply can now that this is the church mission and then it says if you would read the history of the world and the religion history you'll find out that it's always taken that kind of spirit to bring a revival that's right when zion travails i think that's a better travail that's a better word he says then she brought forth children you have to be tore up that's the atmosphere of anything when we come with a mission when we come broken up when we come with a desire with a passion to see something happen not just when we come content in the state that we are in not just when we come and know that well we leave it all up to god we are just yet to receive but when we receive that we are being made co-worker with him when we understand that we are part of the plan of redemption when we understand that the very reason why he sent his word in this last age is to redeem those redeemable and as you are redeemed you become part of god's plan to redeem the others he says i can clearly assure you where god gave the church the power to heal the sick now somebody show me he says somebody show me where he take the where he took that back show me that show me where it is there isn't he says is there is the power in the church it says is the power in the in the church but the church has forgotten it they don't practice it they don't put it into practice so you see it's become again a theology made man theology he says when it does it doesn't compare with god's bible god's bible still remains the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the works that i do shall you do also lo i'm with you always even in you even in you even in you until the end of the world hit that believeth on me though he is dead yet shall he live whatsoever live and believe on me he shall never die believeth out this so yeah there is the prophet here showing that power is given to the church but the problem is the church is not practicing it and because they're not practicing it it's changing to theology it's just common you know just say some few words and and you know you know just throw out something out there with no desire no ambition whatsoever with no prayer asking for god to move or something you know you know if you see they'll catch it anyway no but a group of people that's on the mission a group of people that have an understanding a group of people that understand the position and the role that they are playing they are not satisfied with the devil just tearing everything into pieces they want to go into challenge like the prophet said they want to go toe-to-toe with the devil and they want to claim back what belongs to them they want to take back every inch that god has given to them if it's ours we're going back after it [Applause] that's the people that we ought to be why because the word has been made revealed and god is looking for a manifestation of that word and the manifestation comes when people are stepping into the word and claiming it now i want you to see now what he says this i thought this was very interesting in the church edge book it talks about the condition of the church he says thou sayeth is increased with good that's speaking about the church of laodicea he says this literally means i'm spiritually rich he says this sounds like the millennium with streets of gold and the presence of god but i wonder if this is so is the church truly rich and spiritual in spiritual things of god he says let ex let us examine this 20th century century laodicea boasts in the light of the word it says if the church is truly spiritually rich its influence will be felt upon the community life community should feel it it says but exactly what kind of life the dare these so-called spiritual spiritual and influenced men of the community live it says out of the suburbs it says out in out in the better class of district it says out in the suburbs out in the better class district this it says these classes these is this better class district it says there are there they abound wife swapping prostitution band of children crashing parties it is an exciting a terrible toll of property damages damage immorality has reached all-time high and promiscuous sex act narcotic addiction gambling stealing and all kind of evil and the church goes on to claim how fine in this generation how fine it is in this generation he says how full they are the churches and how responsive especially in how responsive even in the natives on the mission field the church has turned has turned the people over to the doctors especially the psychiatrist how can how can they pray about being rich spiritually is more than i know isn't it says it's it isn't true this they are bankrupt and don't know it it's speaking about the church look at the world look at the church they claim they send missionaries they go give up bibles they go do this and they go give her clothes they go give her dad and yet in their own neighborhood there are a bunch of crimes and kids in with in drugs and all kinds of uh uh things promiscuous sex and all kinds of things happening and yet they're claiming that they are making ground yet they're claiming that they are spiritual he continues on and he says take a look around around you examine the people that walk by that they walk by it says in a multitude and you can see you can pick up those that have the appearance of christians watch how they dress it says watch how they act hear what they say see what they go survey what uh surely they ought to be some real evidence the new birth among all those that we see go by it says but few they are few there be he says yet today the the fundamental church are telling us that they have millions saved and spirit filled he says spirit feel can you call a woman a spirit phil who around uh who who goes around with the freezy bob hair shorts and slacks and altars breathe and all painted up jezebel if those are abundant uh if those are uh are doomed in modesty a pill as become christian woman i would hate to think what it would be what it would be if we had the witness uh if we had to witness a display of immorality yeah they are and they're not coming to the realization that they have actually missed what the purpose was the purpose was not to go and give out gifts and and do all of those things the purpose was that the same spirit that was in christ will come into the church and by that spirit a people will be brought into a condition where they would manifest the same works that christ did where they will come in our community that we can go and shake up the community that we can save the lost and we can manifest christ with our neighbors that we can do all those things and yet they are claiming all those things and there's no proof at all if there are spirits feel then how come all those things he says now i know that the woman don't set the style hollywood does that but listen ladies they still sell yard goods and and sewing machines you don't have to buy what in what's in the store then use it as an excuse this is a deadly serious matter and i'm going and i'm going into it says it says have you not read the scripture that when a man looks upon a woman and lasts after her last after her in his heart that he that he he has already committed adultery with her you know in his heart it says that purpose and and and supposed to be dressed in such a way as to cause that it says that makes you his partner in sin even though even though you absolutely you you'll be absolutely unaware of it and being true virgin with no such desire yet god holds you accountable and will judge you i i just want to ask you what was the purpose for for for the messenger sending the message or even bringing this message to us it was to put us into preparation so we can come to a place where we come into the realization that the church has felt this mission and the mission was not to go just oh and give out all kinds of gifts but the purpose was actually to come into a condition where christ can come and manifest himself in his church he says in the smyrna church it says he says you have left the word of god repent and come back to the word from the first book in the bible in genesis to the last book of revelation there's only one reason for god's displeasure living the word it says there it is only one remedy to regain the favor back to the word the the church has long forgotten i was even thinking about that that vision but when i'm ahead about the church he says that he saw the bride he came into preview the first time he said she came and oh how she was dressed such immoral and he began to to even cry within himself he says is this really the word that we have preached is this really what we have worked for everything we have given is this really the purpose all the effort that we put in is this really what we're going to produce you know because we have to ask ourselves what are we producing our efforts our coming to church everything that we are doing what are we trying to produce and then he says but then the bride came back into preview the second time oh but when is he coming in the second time she was dressed as right and her hair was just long and right and and she began to walk and walk it and walk and he says then i noticed a couple that way at the end and they began to look and they were looking at me and they began to look and pretty soon they began to get out of step and he began to scream out and it says get back in step in step with what with the word that was given to us in step with our commission and step with the mission that we are here to fulfill he says if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the holy ghost you will esteem the word above your necessary meat you will esteem the word above the unnecessary meat and yearns to live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god this is my earnest prayer for all of us it says may we may we have a ear what the spirit brings from the word i want the word to be my meat i want it to be more important than anything i want to to have it always before me i want to know what god says i want it to be always before me because i know that's the only way i can overcome the word was given for me to overcome and it's only by staying with the word that i overcome the moment i step out i have no right i have no place i have no protection i have nothing but when i stay with the world it might turn me to pieces it may cause me to go to my knees it may cause me to lose my mind but i'll stay right there because that's where my victory is [Applause] to esteem the word of god more than meat jesus looked at them and they came and they brought food and he says here's the food he says oh i already ate they said what did you eat it says to fulfill the words of my father that's me to me that actually fills me up naturally not just spiritually naturally i feel happy i feel happy i can dance i can jump in that's what we are called to be we are not out to just be some kind of passive group of believers you know we say this we fall with this we fall no we stand up for something i was thinking about brother brian he speaks about his own life and and for the sake of time i'll just skip some of these things it says he speaks about his own life and he speaks it says it says they came he came in their meeting and many times it says and many times having a meeting just like this right now and so this time it says when it comes i just feel like the light shining on the floor and he came across the four walking to me and a man it says a man some 200 pound dressing right robe and had a dark hair to his shoulders it says very pleasant sort of man i could not move i was shaking he says i heard i heard his voice and ever since i was little but when i've seen him it says but when but i've never seen him nothing but the whirlwind a different pill of fire it says i knew it was the same man the same voice that talked to me since since i was a little boy and he says i'm sent from the presence of the almighty god to tell you that your peculiar birth and life has been an indicated and indicate that you are to pray for the sick to the whole world and he says if you'll be sincere and and when you pray you'll get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer and then he says for this cause i was born for this cause i was born so the prophet could look at his mysterious life things that happened to him you know it talks about a man on the bus or a woman or a man on the bus i can't recall looked in at him and he says you know under what sign you were born and that freaked him out so this was all this mysterious things happening and now now it comes to a place this angel or this angel who was sent from the presence of god comes face to face with him and says for this cause you were born now i want you to now hear it says well now he says i can be honest see that's that's that's that's always i always try to be to be honest with my people with the people it says with the people of god my friend it says well i was born and raised poor in my family i said i'm uneducated he said i'll be with you now remember we said we read the scripture says i'll be with you always whatever you ask i'll back it up whatever he's making the same claims that he makes to the disciple he's now making it now he goes on he says he says as the prophet moses was given two signs to vindicate his ministry this man came and tells him now that you'll be given two signs you'll be given two signs now i want to just say this the the god equipped the man that he sent and god is not going to send you without equipping you god is not i mean he didn't say well you know you go and whatever happened no he says he texts he says oh the word believe me says i'll be with you it says well you know i was born uneducated he says i'll give you two signs like i gave moses the same god has come here it's been revealed in this end time and is telling you the same exact thing because remember if god ever done one thing one way it's obligated to do it every time god cannot send one set of believers with signs and wonders promising to back them up and come back to the end time and leave us alone and say you just go and you just do what you want to do no it's the same god he does the same thing so the holy spirit power was given in order for them to continue the works of christ by receiving christ within them that receive everything that christ wants now i want not to sink by receiving christ they receive everything that christ was in other words if christ healed the sick they were able to heal the sin if christ raised the dead they had the same power within them to do it let's put it to practice let's not let it die let's not get too intellectual where we just think about oh you know this and this now let's call the power of god and the attributes of god let's have it manifested in our mission where a sinner can walk in and feel the presence of god he says this he continues on he says i have given my entire life for this cause now first he's he get he get revealed what his cause was it says for this cause i was born and now i believe it's in the same message he gets to another place it says i have given my entire life for this cause that i may say this with sincerity that if i had ten thousand lives i would never change my opinion can you say the same thing this morning now i want you to have to hear what he says this it says now in the message the image of christ it says we're speaking through the other day before the businessmen and we and there were tanners and attorneys and and fourth and one said it said one says what's your what's your main objective in life excuse me he asked the question what's your main objective in life if you ever ask yourself that question what's your main objective in life he says i says i said i have one it says what is it i said saving souls for christ it says the only thing my highest ambition and only ambition is to see christ glorified i live for that my highest ambition in life is to see christ glorify you you know i feel like sometimes we've replaced our highest ambition with our jobs with our family our lives and our businesses our everything and everything and and christ is somewhere in that packing order you know he pops up every once in a while you know every time if we forget we move him up and then he comes down again we move him back up but here's the man who's focused he's saying when i woke up in the morning when i get out of my bed and when i go out everything i do there's one ambition not two one there's one single ambition there's one ambition that i'm looking for and that's for christ to be glorified and then listen to what he says and i'm so pleased our testimony that 31 years it is making now it says i'm so hum i i i says i have i have humbly served him and if if i should have a million years i would i had i if i had that much life i would i want to live every minute of it for you for and i it says and if i knew that it would turn me down at the end it's such a privilege to live for him amen you mean it turns you down at the end but yet it's still a privilege to live for him if so it's so real so so good i have never found nothing in all my travels all my life that would that would that would anywhere compare with the fellowship that we have together when we are alone i he and i there's no sweet communion there's no greater love for any for my wife for children for anything is the love of christ is so good can we say the same thing that's the kind of atmosphere that's the kind of love that would produce something and i want to ask us this morning what what is the ambition of christian life tabernacle you know we gather here morning and we gather here sunday morning sunday sunday night and wednesday what is the ambition of the members as we gather here what what are we trying to see what are we yearning for what are we wanting to see god do you know and i want to say this the the promises of god we have been given in this end time there are things that we want to see because remember that this message has given us such a privilege such an understanding that god is wanting to make himself one with us god is wanting to take us back into the very same condition that adam was in the beginning and we have to strive for those things we have to have an ambition we have to strive to see the sinners save our children safe to see the lost ones come in we have to be here and and be motivated because we are here at the service of god we and and i want to say this the and the only way we can achieve it is if we come into a unity everyone with the same purpose with the same goal everyone putting the shoulder to the wheel everyone though the same motivation that's how we'll see god move it's not we come and you know this one oh well you know they didn't think my favorite song or you know they didn't do this and oh i really didn't like the way this sounded today you know no we're not going to achieve that's the devil trying to divide and as long as we are divided we can never achieve anything and that's what he wants but oh if we can come with one accord you know i was thinking about nimrod they they gather up together man they gather up together they build this great tower and god had to come down and destroy it because they were in such unity and if man can do that how much more the children of god you know the scripture says if one can put i believe a thousand you know two can put about ten thousand on all those things if we can gather up under with the same goal same objective i wonder what god can do through us oh i tell you i want to be part of whatever that is so god can come in this morning and say i i heard the prayer of the one sitting over there i heard the cry of the other one sitting over there i had the intercession of the other one i have the song of the other one we come in such unity where god is manifesting in his people the scripture speaks in ecclesiastes 49 it says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if you if if they fall one will lift up his fellow but what to him that is alone when he falter for he had no not another to help him to help him up again if two lies together then they have heat but how can they be warm how can you be warm alone if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and threefold scored is not quickly broken what am i gonna say i'll get to a closing a little bit i i i just move in my heart when i read this it's the sir we would see jesus it says now i'll just get in the middle for the sake of time it says now if he is so great he speaks about jesus if he is so great and we see him in galilee as we see him through the bible as the pages unfold with his promise i wonder tonight if we as this church wouldn't have just as much right as those greeks did to come up to the worship and say we would see jesus do we have the same right he asked now he says now there's some things that the bible that there's some things in the bible that god wants us to challenge there are some things in the bible that god wants us to challenge he says god is all-powerful god and he gives his servants a commission to do great things now he says raise the dead heal the sick those are great things and then he says there are things that we need to challenge it says and we mustn't be afraid to ask god to do great things because he's asked us to do the impossible without him i want you to follow closely so if he's asked us to do the impossible we want to have the omnipotent god to do those impossible go ye in all the world preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe he says the impossible with man and we mustn't be afraid to ask god to keep his word i thought this just spoke to my heart god said go raise the dead i don't have power to raise the dead amen but he doesn't say it to say that you go do it by your own self now he said okay you want me to raise the dead well you know you said i'll go raise the dead and you ask me to do the impossible i want the omnipotent god to come and do that impossible the challenge of it that we run into is we are afraid to challenge god and yes he says god in the bible he wants us he's written some things for us to challenge him not us god wrote it put it in such a way that we can come and challenge him he says you said you raised the dead you said you healed the sick and we are here only here as your servant we are here only as your sons and your daughters and i'm calling upon the god who gave us his word to come down this morning and make his word real to us and that's how the impossible will come to be possible now if we back up we are afraid if we come and we are afraid you know you know we'll let him do it on his own time no that's not what he said in fact he says one place that there has to be a people that get tired of the devil kicking people around and kinking things around i'm telling you i want us to get to that place where we just get tired of the devil and the things that he's doing he's got this one he's got that one and this one falls you know you know i'll say this oftentimes we get to a place where you know you hear that such and such they have fallen away you're like oh you know they were not safe anyway yeah i knew i knew they were going to get there really what happened to i'm going after them what happened to i'm not going to let the devil take this one what happened to i'm going to manifest the kingdom of my father what happened to that just perseverance what happened to that just resolve to see god come and move in on it it says it continues on it says it says and the thing and the thing that anything that in the things that i do you shall do also he says after the resurrection if he was supposed to do if he was supposed to do that spirit that was sent back that was in christ came back upon the church and was to do the same works that jesus did when he was on earth when he was here on earth to make the covenant with people exactly the same with the same body it says this is the physical body now the physical body of christ now and when he is when when it is resurrected it goes to meet he goes to meet its mate christ jesus the husband and the wife as kings and and queen it's the same material that was in the body it is the same body of believer the same spirit that was in christ is in us doing the same works and and and if christ keeps his word i'll close with this if the musician could come he says we at the end time listen that's what the holy ghost does the holy ghost by justification just the light just as light shadows of it the holy ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the holy ghost but the baptism of it the deeper shadow now the holy ghost by restoration of every person being here forming the signs and wonders that he did in the beginning glory to god he says in the message i know my redeemer liveth if you did drive this morning here in your automobile your automobile was made was not made just to see if it could be made the material was not wasted by man it was put here for the purpose and deserved its purpose the clothing that you are wearing was not just made if somebody could fashion something it was for the purpose the food that you eat was not grown on the earth just to see if it grows it was married to serve a purpose and god did not have and god did not have did god did not have just so they can make the trees he made the trees for a purpose god did not make you and i just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose there's a purpose for us all being here you are not just here just for another human being you are here because god made us to be for some purpose we are not here to eat the food that god grown we are not here to live in our houses that made that man made will wear the
