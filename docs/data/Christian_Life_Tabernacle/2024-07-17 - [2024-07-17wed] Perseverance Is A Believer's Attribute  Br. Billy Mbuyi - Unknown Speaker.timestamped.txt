[42:43] amen let's start from verse 24 a very
[42:47] familiar scripture reading it it said in
[42:51] and from hence he rose and went into the
[42:54] borders of Tyra and of sidon and he said
[42:57] and then enter into a house and would
[43:00] have no man come uh no man know it but
[43:03] it could not be
[43:05] hid and then he said for a certain woman
[43:08] whose young daughter had an unclean
[43:10] Spirit heard of him and he came and he
[43:13] fell at his feet the woman was a Greek
[43:16] of of sarapen by nation and uh and she
[43:20] besought him that he would cast The
[43:22] Devil out of her daughter but Jesus said
[43:25] unto her let the children be uh let the
[43:29] children first be filled for it is not
[43:31] me to take the children's bread and cast
[43:34] it unto the dogs and she answered and
[43:37] said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs
[43:42] under the table eat of the children's
[43:45] Crum man that's a tremendous statement
[43:48] right there and then he said and he said
[43:50] unto her for this saying go thy way and
[43:54] the devil and the devil is gone out of
[43:57] thy daughter and when she came to her
[44:00] house she found the devil gone out out
[44:03] of her daughter laid upon and the
[44:06] daughter and her daughter laid upon the

[45:04] and and and he would use the definition
[45:08] and he will say the word perseverance it
[45:11] says it it means it's a steady and
[45:14] perseverance uh a steady perseverance in
[45:18] the course of action uh to never give up
[45:23] to in trying to make a goal or in trying
[45:26] to do something so one is trying to
[45:29] achieve a goal they have something in
[45:32] mind and perseverance is the steady
[45:37] persistence in the cause of action to
[45:40] getting that and if you ask Professor
[45:43] Google he will say it's to persisting
[45:46] and the steadfast without giving up so
[45:50] it's to persisting and steadfast without
[45:54] giving up it's continuing
[45:57] in spite of difficulties or setbacks
[46:02] persevering so just by the very
[46:04] definition we can see that that that one
[46:08] who's persevering there there's
[46:10] challenges that are going to come
[46:12] there's things that are going to stand
[46:14] in front there's there's setbacks that
[46:16] are going to come there's difficulties
[46:19] that are going to rise but they are
[46:21] going to continue in their steady and
[46:24] steadfast way in achieving a goal so as
[46:27] we look at it even the very quality of
[46:30] it when you read about perseverance it's
[46:32] not talking about one who's the smartest
[46:36] one who's the fastest and one who's got
[46:38] the skills and one who has just knows
[46:41] how to get things done no those are not
[46:44] the quality of one who's persevering in
[46:48] fact you will find it many of times it's
[46:50] the opposite you will find it's one
[46:52] who's steady it's one who's persistent
[46:55] who doesn't change
[46:57] and I talk about even the very you know
[47:00] we talk about uh uh uh uh in the life
[47:03] you will find you you you you will see
[47:06] it's those that go the fastest that
[47:08] don't get there it's those that try to
[47:11] go that have the most skills that don't
[47:13] get there it's those that are the
[47:15] smartest that don't get there but rather
[47:18] those that are patient and that it seems
[47:21] sometimes like they're not making any
[47:22] Improvement they're not making any
[47:24] ground and but yet they move moving
[47:27] slowly and surely those are th those are
[47:30] those that have the quality of
[47:33] perseverance so it's not necessarily uh
[47:36] uh one who has it all together one who
[47:40] never makes a mistakes and one who just
[47:42] knows how to put their words together
[47:45] one who knows just how to put one foot
[47:47] instead in front of the other and knows
[47:49] how to do no it's probably one who's
[47:51] stumbling at every turn and one who just
[47:54] doesn't seem to to to to look like he's
[47:57] even going to get out of the gate and
[47:59] and and but yet they're pers they're
[48:01] perseverant they they have a goal they
[48:04] want to achieve and nothing is going to
[48:06] turn them away from
[48:09] that so and you will see persevering is
[48:13] is not uh uh when you see it as we said
[48:17] by very definition of it it it shows
[48:21] that the opposition is going to be on
[48:23] your way uh that that if there was no
[48:27] opposition then there's no need to be
[48:29] perseverant I if everything will go
[48:32] smoothly if everything could just be
[48:34] place in the way that is supposed to go
[48:37] if everything will just flow and and and
[48:40] and it will go and without any effort
[48:42] into it there's no need to be
[48:44] perseverant in that situation but it
[48:47] rather shows that you're going to
[48:49] stumble you're going to fail you it may
[48:52] even seem like it's impossible at some
[48:54] place it may look like you may never get
[48:56] to the very goal that you're Desiring
[48:59] but it's the constant persevering that's
[49:01] going to get you there and and I say
[49:04] that because yeah we are uh we we live
[49:08] my brother will say perhaps I'll say it
[49:10] in a this manner to summarize so I don't
[49:12] read too much that we yet we are we we
[49:15] live in what we would call a microwave
[49:18] age where if something doesn't happen
[49:21] within a minute you don't want it
[49:22] anymore we we live in a time where
[49:25] people lack patience and we live in a
[49:27] Time perhaps we'll call this even with
[49:30] the advancement today we have the
[49:32] fastest phone and tomorrow we have one
[49:34] faster than the one we had yesterday and
[49:37] and it's just at the click of a button
[49:39] something has to happen and nobody has
[49:42] the the the patience or the enduring or
[49:45] or no no no people lack the quality of
[49:49] commitment to anything that will take
[49:51] longer and everybody wants it and they
[49:53] want it now and if I'll go to prayer and
[49:56] I pray and it doesn't happen within the
[49:58] first 30 seconds I give
[50:00] up if I if I went to prayer and and I
[50:04] went and I ask God I want healing and I
[50:06] want this I want the Holy Ghost if he
[50:09] doesn't give me within the first prayer
[50:11] that's it I'm done if it hasn't happen
[50:13] within a week I walk away and and I
[50:16] forget that I even ask about it and and
[50:19] so that's the very age that we live in
[50:21] where people they don't have within
[50:23] themselves the ability to remain in a
[50:26] certain place or to ask and stay there
[50:29] until it happens and and and you find
[50:31] out that that's the attitude of today
[50:34] and and and I want to say this this
[50:36] oldfashioned revival or this
[50:38] oldfashioned gospel is not made for
[50:40] people like that th this was made for
[50:43] people that will pray until it happens
[50:46] for people that will seek until they
[50:48] find it was made for people that will
[50:50] show up until God will do it was made
[50:53] for people that will believe until it
[50:55] happens in other word it's made for
[50:58] people that have perseverance within
[51:00] them to know that if God made a promise
[51:02] God will bring his promise to come to
[51:04] pass it was made for those people that
[51:06] will say if God doesn't do it I'll stay
[51:09] here until it does it but when I'm will
[51:12] speak of a man uh will call Body
[51:15] Robinson he said y he came in the corn
[51:18] field and he'll sit there and he said he
[51:21] stood there and he laid down and he put
[51:23] went down on his knees and he said that
[51:25] God if you don't give me the Holy Ghost
[51:27] you will find my bones here when you
[51:30] come back so that's a man that's
[51:32] determined to get something that's a man
[51:34] that would stand there and say I'm here
[51:37] until God does it I believe the promise
[51:40] until it happens I believe the promise
[51:42] until the very manifestation of it I see
[51:46] those are the ones that make the promise
[51:48] happen and we find out that that's the
[51:50] quality people lack today everybody
[51:53] wants something but they wanted it today
[51:55] and everybody wants something
[51:57] but they want it to happen in their
[51:58] timetable nobody is waiting for God to
[52:01] come and bring it to come to pass in
[52:03] their lives they lack the perseverance
[52:06] within the life to wait until the
[52:08] promise come to pass the Bible will say
[52:11] in Matthew 24 and verse 9 and it will
[52:15] say uh it will say then shall they
[52:18] deliver you up for an Affliction and it
[52:21] said to be afflicted and then he said
[52:23] and shall kill you and ye shall be hated
[52:26] of all Nations for my name's
[52:29] sake and then it says and then shall
[52:31] many be offended and it's talking about
[52:34] the very uh condition of the end time
[52:38] and this is I want to say this this was
[52:40] not made for the people outside this is
[52:42] made for the condition that will exist
[52:44] within the framework of the church and
[52:46] then many shall be offended and betray
[52:49] one another and shall hate one another
[52:52] and many false prophets shall rise and
[52:54] shall deceive many and because of the
[52:57] because iniquity shall abound the love
[53:00] of many shall walk cold but he that
[53:03] shall endure un the end now it doesn't
[53:06] say him that is the fastest him that can
[53:09] run the fastest who him that's got it
[53:11] together but him that will do it just
[53:14] the best no but it's him that will stay
[53:17] until the end it's him that will believe
[53:20] until it happens it's a him that's why
[53:23] the Bible will say he said will I find
[53:25] faith when I come come back at the end
[53:27] time and the faith that he's talking
[53:29] about is not necessarily just the belief
[53:32] but people that are waiting for the
[53:34] promise to come to pass as he went and
[53:37] said that I'm going away but I'll come
[53:40] again I'm promising you that I shall
[53:41] come now he's asking a question when I
[53:44] come back will I find on Earth people
[53:46] that are still believing that promise
[53:48] people that are still waiting for the
[53:50] coming of the Lord people that are still
[53:52] believing that there's a God that exist
[53:54] and he can change the heart of people
[53:57] and he can heal diseases and he can make
[54:00] things happen is there still on Earth
[54:02] people that believe
[54:03] that the the god that people believe
[54:06] today is the god that can give you money
[54:08] and that can make you prosper and he can
[54:11] buy you houses and that's not the kind
[54:14] of God this Bible is talking about but
[54:16] the people that will not live by their
[54:18] own dependency but they will depend on
[54:21] God 100% for the bread they depend on
[54:24] God for the clothing they'll depend on
[54:26] God they'll know that God will provide
[54:28] no matter what that's the people is
[54:31] looking for the Devil is provided
[54:34] substitute for everything you got a job
[54:37] and it's going to pay for all that you
[54:38] need and you got the hospital when you
[54:40] seek and you got this and you got that
[54:43] there's no need for God but yeah he
[54:45] asking and he says when I come back will
[54:47] I find a people that will have the faith
[54:51] that was once delivered to the Saints
[54:53] the faith the faith that they will stand
[54:55] and believe that no matter what the
[54:57] circumstance is we worship a living God
[55:00] one who makes his word a reality to a
[55:03] Believer one who comes and he takes his
[55:06] word and he breaks it open to those that
[55:09] believe now let me say this that promise
[55:12] was not to the
[55:14] unbeliever I I made a statement last
[55:17] time I said the problem we run into is
[55:19] we see people fall away and we wonder
[55:22] what happened to them let me say this if
[55:25] there's any shout of doubt any portion
[55:28] of a doubt in your heart it will
[55:30] manifest somehow the word of God is unto
[55:33] the Believers those that will believe
[55:36] Until the End those that will stay with
[55:39] it until it happens it's not made for
[55:42] the unbeliever it's made for those that
[55:44] are sold out and they have nothing to go
[55:47] back to I came out of the world there's
[55:49] nothing in the world that attracts me I
[55:51] have nothing to go back to I believe
[55:54] this with all my heart and I'll stay
[55:56] here here until he makes it happen
[55:58] that's what the word was made for
[56:00] therefore they don't stay long enough to
[56:02] see that God manifest his word but a
[56:05] Believer will stay until God makes it
[56:07] happen in fact but what I'm said it's
[56:10] those that believe it they bring the
[56:12] kingdom of God down by their faith and
[56:15] they stand there and they keep calling
[56:18] until the kingdom comes to the
[56:22] manifestation those that will believe
[56:24] until the end so have we we we live in a
[56:28] time I said a micro of age and a time
[56:31] where people are looking for
[56:34] Christianity void of
[56:36] Trials a a a customade
[56:40] Christianity made specially just for you
[56:43] you don't have to suffer anything you
[56:46] don't have to give up anything in fact
[56:49] you have a dial where you can mix the
[56:51] worldliness with a little bit of
[56:53] Christianity and just have it to your
[56:55] taste
[56:56] and call it oh I'm a Christian that's
[56:59] not a
[57:00] Christian the scripture says if you are
[57:02] lukewarm it will spew you out of his
[57:04] mouth God is looking for people that are
[57:08] sold out to him people that are prisoner
[57:11] like we heard it last Sunday they are
[57:13] tied to this gospel and whatever he said
[57:16] they looking for the manifestation of it
[57:19] they're not interested in what the devil
[57:21] has to offer what the world has to offer
[57:23] they want the word of God and nothing
[57:25] else
[57:26] they live by the word and nothing
[57:30] else if the word said go to church they
[57:33] go to church if the word says you be
[57:36] there they'll be there if the word tells
[57:38] them you are here it doesn't matter how
[57:41] much symtom the devil will pour it
[57:44] doesn't matter how much how much
[57:46] contradiction will come to pass they
[57:49] believe in they stay steadfast until it
[57:51] happens
[57:56] void of Trials void of suffering in fact
[58:00] bam says if somebody ever sold you
[58:02] something like that don't take it don't
[58:05] believe it they think we're going to go
[58:08] on the bed of ease and and just uh float
[58:11] in the cloud and you know every time you
[58:14] need something you just press your
[58:16] microwave five minute later it's dished
[58:19] out to you oh you needed healing yeah it
[58:22] is oh you needed Deliverance yeah it is
[58:26] all you needed this year it is you don't
[58:28] have to sweat it out at all but abam
[58:31] says Abraham sweated it out yes sir he
[58:34] stood there in a dusty place when God
[58:37] told him the whole land believe belonged
[58:40] to you y was standing at the dusty place
[58:43] and lock over there in a place in Sodom
[58:45] and gomorah at the place where water
[58:48] was but he stood there and and he Keep
[58:52] On Believing until God made the promise
[58:54] to come to Pastor him yes they want a
[58:57] better of feas and Christianity that
[59:00] could be mixed and Christianity that you
[59:03] can live just how you want you know if
[59:06] you feel like you're too much of a
[59:08] Christian you could just dial it down a
[59:10] little bit man I'm becoming too much of
[59:13] a Christian I just need a little bit of
[59:15] and if you feel like worldliness is
[59:17] crippling and you dial it up a little
[59:19] bit then at the measure that you like
[59:22] isn't that what they sell us custom
[59:24] stuff just tell us what you want we'll
[59:27] build it according to your
[59:31] specification the scripture says the
[59:34] kingdom of God doesn't come by
[59:36] observation but it's Violent Men that
[59:39] step into it men that would say I don't
[59:42] see it but I believe it I don't see it
[59:46] but I believe it they will call it and
[59:48] it will come unto manifestation they
[59:51] will stay there and pull it down and God
[59:53] will make it happen to them that's right
[59:57] people don't see it because it's not
[59:58] made to be seen just like that it's made
[1:00:01] for us to go down on our knees to pray
[1:00:04] him to ask him to knock until the door
[1:00:07] opens to seek until we find to go and to
[1:00:11] ask him and to be changed let me say
[1:00:13] this the experience that comes with that
[1:00:16] you will never forget
[1:00:20] it but this mix up religion God will do
[1:00:24] something you won't even know he did it
[1:00:26] why because it's mixed up with so many
[1:00:28] other things but men of all that have
[1:00:31] gone to their knees and they've prayed
[1:00:33] and have asked and they've knocked and
[1:00:35] God has done something their attitude
[1:00:37] has completely changed and they never
[1:00:40] forget
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:43] it why does the Bible says is the god of
[1:00:47] Abraham Isaac and Jacob those are
[1:00:50] testimonies that can never be forgotten
[1:00:53] that can be told from generation to
[1:00:55] generation
[1:00:56] about a living God who came on the scene
[1:00:59] about a God who can never forget and
[1:01:01] anytime he came to their children he
[1:01:04] reminded them I'm the god of Abraham
[1:01:07] what does that mean to you when I say
[1:01:09] that if you ask one who's from Israel
[1:01:12] one of us of of that lineage whether
[1:01:15] spiritual or natural they'll tell you
[1:01:17] with my father Abraham he waited 25
[1:01:20] years and God brought a son to
[1:01:24] him God God brought his promise to pass
[1:01:27] after 25
[1:01:31] years and let me say this when you are
[1:01:35] really born again Christian you become a
[1:01:38] prisoner you have perseverance within
[1:01:41] your heart you're not satisfied with
[1:01:44] just seeing things go the way they go
[1:01:46] when you find one that's un bondage when
[1:01:49] you find something that's not right that
[1:01:51] perseverance begin to work in you you
[1:01:54] stand there and you begin to fight and
[1:01:56] you begin to ask and why it's given in
[1:01:59] your power to change the circumstance
[1:02:02] why it's given to you to ask and to
[1:02:04] change the circumstance it's given to
[1:02:06] you to ask until it happens it's given
[1:02:09] to you to knock until it
[1:02:13] opens but what I will
[1:02:16] say it say in this message I don't know
[1:02:21] I have a quote from both of from from
[1:02:23] multiple ones so I probably just need
[1:02:26] you to find it as I read it says now all
[1:02:30] Christian all Christians must be
[1:02:38] persistent so that there there's no
[1:02:42] excuse for us to be gathered here and
[1:02:45] one to say oh I'm not really it says all
[1:02:50] Christians must be
[1:02:52] persistent they must be perseverant
[1:02:56] and the only way you are able to do this
[1:02:59] is to First have faith in what you are
[1:03:03] trying to do yes now remember the
[1:03:06] scripture says this Faith cometh by
[1:03:09] hearing by hearing the word of God and
[1:03:12] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:03:14] God so when you have faith you are
[1:03:17] pleasing to God in achieving the goal so
[1:03:21] it says faith is what if if you have
[1:03:24] faith in what you are trying to achieve
[1:03:26] and if you have no faith you just
[1:03:28] jumping at it it says you cannot be
[1:03:31] persevering but when you really know
[1:03:34] that it's the truth I love this when you
[1:03:37] not when you oh I think it's the truth
[1:03:39] and I believe God sent a messenger but I
[1:03:41] don't know if the word is really real I
[1:03:44] don't I really don't know I'm not no
[1:03:46] when you really know from the bottom of
[1:03:48] your heart when it's been reveal to you
[1:03:50] when it's personal when you know that
[1:03:53] I'll take this no matter what happened
[1:03:55] when when you know I'll stay with the
[1:03:57] word no matter what happened when you
[1:03:59] know that this message that we have
[1:04:01] received it's not an idea from men but
[1:04:03] it's God himself speaking to you then
[1:04:06] you become
[1:04:08] persevering when you really know that
[1:04:11] it's the truth then there's nothing
[1:04:13] that's going to stop you you are really
[1:04:15] persevering then men of all age that's a
[1:04:18] been able to do anything and had faith
[1:04:21] in what they were trying to do were
[1:04:24] persevering so I want to do this just
[1:04:26] for a moment now I want you to notice
[1:04:28] there's two things that is's bringing
[1:04:31] together here so this man of old number
[1:04:34] one there was something that what they
[1:04:36] were trying to achieve in other words
[1:04:38] there's first the goal that they're
[1:04:40] trying to get to and there's faith in
[1:04:43] believing in that goal so first of all
[1:04:46] even as we come here because why is that
[1:04:48] important because when you have faith
[1:04:51] when you receive the word you have to
[1:04:53] have faith in it otherwise it's possible
[1:04:56] to achieve it so if God said that you
[1:04:58] are a son of God you have to have faith
[1:05:01] in that to begin with if God said you
[1:05:03] are healed you have to have faith in
[1:05:06] that to begin with so if you hear the
[1:05:08] word and there's no faith to believe
[1:05:10] that you can't achieve the goal so the
[1:05:13] first is to know what's the goal the
[1:05:15] goal is God made me to be a son and a
[1:05:18] daughter the goal is God made me to
[1:05:20] serve him the goal is God made me to
[1:05:23] represent him and then I have faith in
[1:05:26] that those two things will bring you to
[1:05:28] be
[1:05:30] persevering so they saw something
[1:05:33] something they were trying to achieve
[1:05:35] they had to know that it's the truth and
[1:05:38] they have faith in what they were trying
[1:05:40] to achieve in another one bam says uh
[1:05:44] this one preaching 0305
[1:05:47] 64305 he says men of all of all ages he
[1:05:51] says that has faith in what they were
[1:05:53] trying to achieve has been
[1:05:57] perseverant no man can be perseverant
[1:06:00] unless first he knows what he's trying
[1:06:03] to achieve so the achievement is always
[1:06:06] important and the first you must know
[1:06:09] what you're trying to achieve then have
[1:06:11] faith in what you're trying to get to
[1:06:14] what you are trying to get to uh you are
[1:06:16] trying to what you are trying for and
[1:06:20] that makes you perseverant something
[1:06:22] that you know is real faith is it says
[1:06:26] and it says faith is based that way
[1:06:29] faith is not based upon some myth upon
[1:06:32] something like something that well I'll
[1:06:35] just say go and do this or do that he
[1:06:38] says only the word of of some only on
[1:06:43] the word of some men but Faith takes its
[1:06:46] Eternal resting place upon the word of
[1:06:49] the Lord upon God's word which is the
[1:06:53] Bible so when we say that and I want to
[1:06:56] say this true faith can only come by the
[1:06:58] word of God true faith that makes you
[1:07:01] perseverant is not based upon your idea
[1:07:05] of the word of God but it's based upon
[1:07:07] what God has promised when you can see
[1:07:10] what God has promised in the word when
[1:07:13] you can see what the promise is for you
[1:07:15] and you have faith in that that that's
[1:07:18] what will make you
[1:07:22] perseverant let me say this true faith
[1:07:27] is what will cause you to become
[1:07:31] persevering why because true
[1:07:33] faith is a
[1:07:37] revelation if it's that's why but the
[1:07:40] prophet said we one thing that we have
[1:07:42] to pray the most about is the revelation
[1:07:45] we we and I and I feel like sometimes we
[1:07:48] are so much educated in this message
[1:07:51] that we pretty much know most of what
[1:07:54] banam says
[1:07:56] every time we hear it we know oh I yeah
[1:07:58] I know butam said that I know but the
[1:08:01] the knowledge alone will only take you
[1:08:03] so far not that knowledge is bad but
[1:08:06] what we are looking for in our daily
[1:08:08] life is for that knowledge to be quick
[1:08:11] and be move from just head knowledge to
[1:08:13] Revelation what we are looking for is
[1:08:15] for The God Who who spoke the word and
[1:08:19] who brought the word to who open our
[1:08:21] eyes let me say this we didn't open our
[1:08:23] own eyes he did that so we take thank
[1:08:25] him for that so that's why we move from
[1:08:28] Revelation unto Revelation so if he made
[1:08:30] us to recognize that this message is his
[1:08:33] message if he made us to come to the
[1:08:35] place where we have gathered here none
[1:08:38] of us made ourselves a Christian he
[1:08:40] gathers us here he brought the faith
[1:08:42] within our heart so what we need is
[1:08:44] abundant Revelation is more Revelation
[1:08:47] so he can Quicken the remaining part of
[1:08:50] the word into our lives so we can be
[1:08:53] persevering
[1:08:56] because if you don't see him in this
[1:08:58] message if you don't see him like a a
[1:09:01] Pastor said I thought it was you can
[1:09:03] examine the whole world of God and Bam
[1:09:06] says this I believe I I I don't remember
[1:09:09] what message it was I thought it was
[1:09:10] perfect Faith but I I don't remember he
[1:09:13] says what you have to do as a Believer
[1:09:16] is to put the sum of everything that you
[1:09:18] have heard you examine everything that
[1:09:22] you have heard you examine everything
[1:09:24] that you have seen
[1:09:26] and ask yourself one question is this
[1:09:28] God or it's not
[1:09:31] God you see if you're not sure it's not
[1:09:34] going to help you you you're never going
[1:09:36] to move you it's going to stop you it's
[1:09:39] going to hinder you somewhere along the
[1:09:41] way what you do is you examine
[1:09:43] everything that you heard you examine
[1:09:45] everything that you have seen you have
[1:09:47] to answer the question is it God or it's
[1:09:49] not God why because if it's God then he
[1:09:53] will bring perseverance unto your heart
[1:09:56] yes
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:02] so yeah we are as we looked and he would
[1:10:06] speak
[1:10:08] about the
[1:10:10] underlying when you look at all of these
[1:10:13] people that were
[1:10:15] persevering you find that there's an
[1:10:17] underlying characteristics about
[1:10:20] them and I and I just want to say this
[1:10:24] because I I I I I don't I don't want us
[1:10:28] to get an idea that this is something
[1:10:31] that that is achieved by your strength
[1:10:35] that is achieved by you walking up and
[1:10:37] saying I'm going to believe the message
[1:10:40] and I'll be the best Christian there is
[1:10:41] you're going to fall
[1:10:43] flat amen I I don't want us to look at
[1:10:47] it and say oh it's going to be my my
[1:10:49] natural endurance and I'm going to give
[1:10:52] it my all and I'll try to outrun
[1:10:55] everybody you're going to fall
[1:10:58] flat I'm going to try to outdo everybody
[1:11:01] so they know I'm the best Christian you
[1:11:03] you your beginning is wrong your motive
[1:11:05] and objectives are wrong so therefore
[1:11:07] you're never going to get
[1:11:09] anywhere but but yet at the same time
[1:11:12] the prophet is saying that this man when
[1:11:14] you look at them there was never a
[1:11:17] quitting ATT attribute in them there was
[1:11:20] never a letting off attribute from them
[1:11:24] and it at the same time it wasn't so
[1:11:27] much that they were running in it fast
[1:11:30] and and and and and making themselves
[1:11:32] known and so everybody will know perhaps
[1:11:35] it was the most humble some of them you
[1:11:37] wouldn't even know because often time
[1:11:40] when we think about perseverance our our
[1:11:42] natural mind thinks about someone's
[1:11:45] ability or what a person can do or how
[1:11:48] they move about and what you see them no
[1:11:51] some of the most persevering people are
[1:11:54] probably some of the the the the the
[1:11:56] slowest people there
[1:12:00] is some of the most perseverance are
[1:12:03] some of the one that you wouldn't even
[1:12:05] notice but they're there day in and day
[1:12:07] out and and and those that come and you
[1:12:10] show off and they seem to have more fire
[1:12:12] than the others just give them a little
[1:12:15] bit of time and then to
[1:12:18] disappear so it it's not the natural
[1:12:21] ability of someone to try things out and
[1:12:24] and try to show off that they have the
[1:12:27] most Faith than everybody else but it's
[1:12:29] one who stays with it one perhaps who's
[1:12:33] a making just a little step and and and
[1:12:37] you wouldn't even notice that there's
[1:12:38] any difference but yet they are there
[1:12:40] making the biggest
[1:12:45] difference but when I'm talks about
[1:12:47] George Washington it says and I love
[1:12:49] this he says and then and then it says
[1:12:52] and now man uh and then it says and now
[1:12:55] man who has had faith in God has been
[1:12:58] perseverant and in what they were trying
[1:13:01] to do and to take man of the the the of
[1:13:05] all the walks of life he says for
[1:13:07] instance this is preaching
[1:13:09] 0305 he says paragraph 15 he says for
[1:13:12] instance George Washington he says here
[1:13:16] at the Valley Forge he says after
[1:13:18] praying all night in the
[1:13:22] snow up on the he and and in the snow
[1:13:26] and it it says and and and in the snow
[1:13:29] and up on his hips it says and and and
[1:13:32] was wet way around his waist and the
[1:13:35] river was full of
[1:13:37] ice but he caught a vision from
[1:13:41] God oh I love this if we could catch it
[1:13:44] says he caught faith that God was going
[1:13:48] to give him the victory he said he
[1:13:51] couldn't have he says he could have too
[1:13:54] much ice he couldn't have too much ice
[1:13:56] in it though over two-thirds of his army
[1:13:59] didn't have the shoes on the the on the
[1:14:02] on the feet they says their feet was
[1:14:04] wrapped in rag standing in the cold but
[1:14:08] yet he felt in his heart that God had
[1:14:11] given him the victory now let me say
[1:14:15] this this is before any instance of
[1:14:18] victory was manifested in the
[1:14:20] battlefield this is before anything
[1:14:23] before he knew the numbers of his
[1:14:25] enemies what they triy all he knew is in
[1:14:28] the natural they didn't have enough
[1:14:30] shoes they didn't have enough guns they
[1:14:32] were outgun they were out shoes they the
[1:14:35] the the enemy was more than they were
[1:14:37] but all he knew is I have victory in my
[1:14:40] heart I prayed and God showed me that
[1:14:43] I'm going to have
[1:14:45] Victory let me say this perseverance is
[1:14:48] not what's happening in the natural
[1:14:50] perseverance is an attribute of God that
[1:14:53] he drops within the heart of of a
[1:14:55] Believer before one sand is move on the
[1:14:58] mountain you already know it's going to
[1:15:03] happen our kind of perseverance is we
[1:15:06] pray we' open up one eye is it still
[1:15:10] there I need to pray a little
[1:15:16] more this is a
[1:15:18] man snow everywhere knowing physically
[1:15:23] that they were under a great
[1:15:26] disadvantage that they didn't have
[1:15:28] enough gun didn't have enough shoes to
[1:15:30] wear they didn't they were not clothes
[1:15:32] properly but yet after praying after
[1:15:36] going down on their knees something
[1:15:38] within his heart tells him you're going
[1:15:40] to have Victory and he stands up at one
[1:15:43] place but whatam says he got shot and
[1:15:45] the shot went directly from his jacket
[1:15:48] and I never stopped him he kept going
[1:15:50] until the victory came to
[1:15:53] pass that's right
[1:15:55] and I want to say this that's the kind
[1:15:57] of Christian we want to be we don't want
[1:15:59] to be all broken up by what we see we
[1:16:03] don't want to be all tired and all
[1:16:05] disappointed and and and give up just
[1:16:08] because of what we see no you see sin
[1:16:11] and you see all of that and your
[1:16:13] children are not serving God and this is
[1:16:15] happening that one is sick and this one
[1:16:17] is going on you need to go down on your
[1:16:20] knees you need to pray until Victory is
[1:16:23] in your heart
[1:16:25] yes then when you stand there it doesn't
[1:16:28] matter what you see it's never going to
[1:16:31] discourage you because you'll know that
[1:16:33] The God Who revealed the victory in your
[1:16:35] heart that God will bring it to come to
[1:16:42] pass a man who's ever met God who's ever
[1:16:47] come in contact with God is
[1:16:53] persevering right let me just jump ahead
[1:16:57] but what I'm talks about David and and I
[1:17:00] know we tell the story and and I I just
[1:17:03] began to think about it and it just
[1:17:05] broke my heart and I say you know what
[1:17:08] nobody give David a chance right now we
[1:17:11] can we can sit here and read it like
[1:17:13] it's a nice story and oh that's a great
[1:17:16] story and everything if you were in that
[1:17:19] time nobody gave him a
[1:17:23] chance he came to Saul and Saul tried to
[1:17:26] take his jacket and put it now they call
[1:17:28] him a lead oh when when they heard
[1:17:32] someone was willing at least to stand up
[1:17:35] he says bring him over they looked at
[1:17:37] him and says he's just a
[1:17:39] lad they he he says okay put this on let
[1:17:42] let's just at least try to cover so we
[1:17:44] can make the battle last at least 30
[1:17:49] seconds but here today we we talk about
[1:17:52] it as if it was natural for that to
[1:17:54] happen happened nobody gave him a
[1:17:58] chance they went home knowing that they
[1:18:02] were going to be
[1:18:03] defeated they knew that they didn't have
[1:18:06] a chance if Saul but the the scripture
[1:18:09] Call Saul it says he was heading
[1:18:11] shoulders above everyone if Saul didn't
[1:18:14] have the guts to stand there how much
[1:18:17] more nobody could stand because he was
[1:18:19] the one who was given to be king and he
[1:18:22] was given a task to protect the nation
[1:18:24] he R
[1:18:26] away today we read it and we make David
[1:18:29] this giant and no he was not given a
[1:18:32] chance and the prophet say this if
[1:18:34] nobody gives you a chance at least if
[1:18:37] God is on your side that settles
[1:18:41] it oh my brother my sister the odd can
[1:18:44] be stacked up against you that's
[1:18:47] wonderful you don't need everybody to
[1:18:49] believe you you just need God on your
[1:18:52] side
[1:18:54] you just need a him on your side it's
[1:18:57] going to change your whole
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:01] equation he stood there and they put the
[1:19:04] jacket and like we can't even make it
[1:19:06] last 30 seconds take a and David is like
[1:19:09] this is too heavy I can't wear this I I
[1:19:12] can't even stand up my arm he couldn't
[1:19:14] even lift up his arm to go fight is like
[1:19:17] I mean this I'm just going to get there
[1:19:18] and just lay down and fall flat at least
[1:19:21] I need to be myself to try this out so
[1:19:24] he said okay let him go they let him go
[1:19:26] and yes Little David and Oh my he came
[1:19:30] and his testimony was he says so how do
[1:19:34] you think you're going to do this now
[1:19:36] when he came to Goliath I want you to
[1:19:39] understand these words that he spoke he
[1:19:41] didn't come to Goliath as himself he
[1:19:44] said that who are you to defy the army
[1:19:47] of the Living God one thing that David
[1:19:50] knew was God was it was his Israel one
[1:19:53] thing that David knew that Israel was
[1:19:56] God's nation that God gave them that
[1:19:59] Nation there were people called out
[1:20:02] David knew about the God of Abraham
[1:20:04] Isaac and Jacob at least he knew
[1:20:06] something about the God that they were
[1:20:08] supposed to be worshiping he said but
[1:20:10] one day but but will say they say he
[1:20:14] comes and they ask him and said you know
[1:20:16] what I don't have much experience but
[1:20:19] one thing I know he says one thing my
[1:20:22] dad he put me overseer I want you to
[1:20:25] catch this he put me overseer over the
[1:20:28] Sheep he put me in charge of the
[1:20:31] sheep and while being in charge of the
[1:20:34] sheep it says a lion
[1:20:37] came David understood the responsibility
[1:20:41] that was laid upon his shoulder and
[1:20:44] because he stood for the responsibility
[1:20:47] that was given to him God help him
[1:20:50] defend
[1:20:52] that so the only only reason why he was
[1:20:55] able to defend against a lion and the
[1:20:58] bear is because he took the
[1:21:00] responsibility that was given him and he
[1:21:04] opposed the enemy that was coming
[1:21:05] against him he won the fight but don't
[1:21:09] forget that that same David was also
[1:21:11] anointed to be king over Israel so now
[1:21:14] he moved from one responsibility to
[1:21:16] another he's now anointed to be king
[1:21:20] therefore when he come and they stood
[1:21:22] that's why there was nobody who could
[1:21:24] even
[1:21:28] stand and let me ask you this what has
[1:21:31] God put you over see over he's giv you a
[1:21:35] family he's giving you a church he's
[1:21:38] giving you a people to be in fellowship
[1:21:39] with why don't you stand like David
[1:21:42] tonight and say God has called me to be
[1:21:44] a son and a daughter God has given me my
[1:21:47] family God has given me my wife my
[1:21:50] children therefore I'm only standing for
[1:21:53] that position and nothing
[1:21:57] else no we run away from our
[1:22:01] responsibilities we go look for somebody
[1:22:04] else to fight our
[1:22:06] battles he wasn't the
[1:22:09] strongest he wasn't the the the one who
[1:22:12] could do it the fastest but one thing he
[1:22:15] knew was I was given this responsibility
[1:22:19] and I'm standing up on the
[1:22:20] responsibility I was given
[1:22:26] he
[1:22:27] says he had that he knew he says he felt
[1:22:32] in his heart that God had given him
[1:22:35] Victory and he had prayed
[1:22:38] through the next day we know three
[1:22:42] musket bullet went through his coat
[1:22:45] without touching
[1:22:47] him and the river couldn't stop him
[1:22:51] neither could a musket bullets the the
[1:22:53] musket Bullet Stop stop him he was pers
[1:22:57] persistent because he had prayed through
[1:23:01] he had the he had faith in what he was
[1:23:06] doing in the one thing that was leading
[1:23:09] him was that was
[1:23:12] God he says now listen nothing is going
[1:23:16] to stop a
[1:23:18] man he's persistent when he knows what
[1:23:22] he's doing and got fid in what he's
[1:23:25] trying to achieve in another place he
[1:23:28] says for instance like what we call the
[1:23:31] father of our nation speaking about the
[1:23:33] same story George
[1:23:35] Washington he was perseverant when he
[1:23:39] tried to achieve the victory over the
[1:23:41] British and crossed the icy Delaware he
[1:23:44] was persevering he was there was nothing
[1:23:47] it says his soldiers half of them didn't
[1:23:49] have shoes on their
[1:23:52] feet and was robbed in rags
[1:23:55] and the winds was blowing listen to this
[1:23:58] but he had prayed all night and had
[1:24:01] victory in his
[1:24:06] heart what what we need is victory in
[1:24:09] here not out here victory in here will
[1:24:13] manifest the victory out here the
[1:24:16] problem is we don't have victory in here
[1:24:19] we're looking for the victory outside
[1:24:22] when that Blind Men screamed I'm heal he
[1:24:24] already believ in his heart that what
[1:24:27] the prophet told him was true so what
[1:24:29] was true within his heart came to
[1:24:31] manifest outside so when we pray what we
[1:24:34] looking for is God to make his word
[1:24:36] reality in here
[1:24:41] yes but when I'm talks about the couple
[1:24:43] I was thinking about it that had a Babys
[1:24:46] sick in the hospital and all that we're
[1:24:49] trying to do is to get brother bam to
[1:24:51] come and pray for the son
[1:24:56] they said we believe that if you pray
[1:24:58] for our son he'll be
[1:25:01] healed they try everything and finally
[1:25:04] bam came and the way he said it he came
[1:25:07] and they told him they said we believe
[1:25:09] that if you lay your hands on our son
[1:25:12] he'll be healed he said if that's what
[1:25:14] you believe
[1:25:16] wonderful he went and but says the
[1:25:20] doctors the doctor goes out the nurse
[1:25:23] was there he comes and he prays and he
[1:25:25] prays and he's done and they hug him and
[1:25:27] says oh thank you very much for coming
[1:25:30] thank you and but when I'm walks out and
[1:25:32] they start rejoicing hallelujah praise
[1:25:35] God he's healing praise God and the
[1:25:38] nurse is there completely confounded he
[1:25:41] looks at them and says I can't believe
[1:25:44] you're doing this it says there's not on
[1:25:47] the record anybody whose blood pressure
[1:25:49] has gone down this low where we gotten
[1:25:52] this measurement and that is says this
[1:25:55] and that instrument there's never been a
[1:25:57] case where we put all of this together
[1:25:59] and that person comes to
[1:26:02] live and I love this but when him says
[1:26:05] then this old man he says he didn't get
[1:26:07] mad he didn't rebuke you get out of the
[1:26:09] hospital or whatever get out of the room
[1:26:12] no he said he came and he put his hand
[1:26:14] around the little little uh sister he
[1:26:16] said the little nurse and he says let me
[1:26:19] tell you something you are trying to
[1:26:21] look at this instrument you are trying
[1:26:23] to get your measurement from here you
[1:26:26] are trying to understand what these
[1:26:27] instruments are saying but I am trying
[1:26:30] to look at the promise up above and if
[1:26:32] the promise up above says is heal I
[1:26:35] don't care what the instruments are
[1:26:37] telling
[1:26:38] me that's what a Christian is a
[1:26:41] Christian is not an outward person
[1:26:43] looking it's an inward person looking
[1:26:46] one who cares about what God is saying
[1:26:49] and if God says it I don't care if the
[1:26:51] righted sea is in front I don't care if
[1:26:53] the Jordan is in front as long as God
[1:26:56] said
[1:26:57] it I know it's going to move one way or
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:01] other
[1:27:02] perseverant yes we are not given to be
[1:27:06] those that will just lay down and you
[1:27:08] know the devil he'll come and wreck all
[1:27:11] kinds of
[1:27:14] hers this is going wrong over here
[1:27:16] that's going and if we're not careful
[1:27:20] all we say is well God is going to do it
[1:27:22] when he wants to do it
[1:27:24] or we just going to wait until God does
[1:27:26] it or whatever not speaking from the
[1:27:29] position of perseverance but speaking
[1:27:32] from the position of
[1:27:40] hopelessness we can't be
[1:27:42] hopelessness that word doesn't even
[1:27:45] exist in the Christian vocabulary I will
[1:27:48] believe until I will stand until I'll
[1:27:52] stay here I'll pray until until if it
[1:27:55] doesn't happen today I'll pray tomorrow
[1:27:57] I'll pray the next day I'll continue to
[1:27:59] stand in the Gap until my son is Wayward
[1:28:03] God gave it to me and I believe if God
[1:28:06] gave it to me God will bring him
[1:28:13] back how many examples we have in the
[1:28:18] Bible but when I'm talks about uh I'm
[1:28:22] probably confusing now I believe it was
[1:28:24] martyr he says yes she comes and he says
[1:28:28] master and yeah we are and we know that
[1:28:33] they there was never a case where
[1:28:36] someone is dead for 4 days and
[1:28:40] resurrected so perhaps we know of a case
[1:28:43] where one died and he was prayed for or
[1:28:47] sick he was prayed for and he raised one
[1:28:49] who just died and there was a funeral
[1:28:51] possession and he came and erased but
[1:28:54] one who's dead for four days and the
[1:28:57] nose sunk him that we never seen
[1:29:01] before but butam says perhaps they might
[1:29:05] and perhaps I'm confusing if you
[1:29:08] confusing you forgive me he's talking
[1:29:10] about how they had a reference in the
[1:29:12] Bible it could have been a shite woman
[1:29:15] or it could have been an example where
[1:29:17] elizah came and he laid upon the boy and
[1:29:20] he raised and butam says this they knew
[1:29:23] that if God was in Elijah surely God was
[1:29:27] in his
[1:29:30] son and I want to say this if God was in
[1:29:33] the prophet surely God is in the bride
[1:29:37] let's not forget that if God was in his
[1:29:40] prophet in the end time where he came
[1:29:42] and he manifested himself and that head
[1:29:45] is tied to the body and the prophet is
[1:29:47] the member of the Bride is the chief W
[1:29:49] of offering surely that God must be in
[1:29:52] his bride
[1:29:54] that's
[1:29:55] right and he came and he says he says oh
[1:29:59] I believe that thou are the Son of God
[1:30:02] and and he says I believe in the
[1:30:04] resurrection he says no I am the
[1:30:07] resurrection and
[1:30:08] life he looks at him and says yes I
[1:30:11] believe that that in the last day he'll
[1:30:13] be raised and everything he stood there
[1:30:16] and he looked at him and he cried he
[1:30:18] says take me to him they took him to him
[1:30:21] and everybody says oh perhaps it's going
[1:30:23] to go cry at the tomb and he must have
[1:30:25] really loved him and everything he comes
[1:30:28] and he stand there and after crying he
[1:30:30] looks and he says take away the unbelief
[1:30:34] take all the unbelief away roll away the
[1:30:36] stone and they roll away the stone and
[1:30:39] he called forth and he says Lazarus come
[1:30:42] forth and what says if he didn't precise
[1:30:46] Resurrection was going to happen then my
[1:30:49] brother my sister that same voice is in
[1:30:51] the bride in the end time
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:30:57] this message brings the voice of the
[1:31:00] Resurrection in you the the voice to
[1:31:03] speak life into existence the voice to
[1:31:06] speak things that don't exist as of the
[1:31:09] world the voice to bring healing the
[1:31:12] bring the voice to extend the kingdom of
[1:31:16] God but you here we are Hallelujah not
[1:31:19] even understanding let me say this we
[1:31:21] need to be persistent yes we need to be
[1:31:24] a persevering people I don't care what
[1:31:27] your day was like I don't care what you
[1:31:29] go through when God has spoken when God
[1:31:32] has promised something you stand there
[1:31:34] and believe
[1:31:47] it so
[1:31:49] now we look at this man and
[1:32:02] the devil always there to offer
[1:32:07] reasons why you should not be
[1:32:14] persevering offering
[1:32:21] excuses but a Believer has to make a
[1:32:23] choice
[1:32:25] and the choice is between what you
[1:32:29] see and what's been revealed in
[1:32:32] here if it's not revealed that's why he
[1:32:35] said we're going to walk by Revelation
[1:32:38] he says how do you begin in the spirit
[1:32:40] and then In the
[1:32:41] Flesh and then end up turning towards
[1:32:45] the flesh now so things can happen no if
[1:32:47] it started by Revelation it's going to
[1:32:49] finish in Revelation that's why it says
[1:32:52] to the bride Rapture is a revelation
[1:32:57] it's not a calculation of what we need
[1:33:00] to do in order to get there though it's
[1:33:02] going to be revealed when the time comes
[1:33:04] in fact I'll say this it's it's in we
[1:33:06] are in the season of the revealing of it
[1:33:09] so it could get us ready for that
[1:33:12] time we we as fellowshipping with the
[1:33:16] brothers we we walk so much in the
[1:33:19] number
[1:33:21] system in other words the numbers have
[1:33:23] to add
[1:33:25] up you tell me this is going to happen
[1:33:28] now yeah so if we add up the numbers and
[1:33:31] we understand the numbers then we go I
[1:33:34] believe it no that's not Faith that's
[1:33:36] right at least that's human Faith that's
[1:33:39] not the kind of Faith we're talking
[1:33:40] about the kind of Faith we're talking
[1:33:42] about is Noah God telling him it's going
[1:33:46] to rain when people don't even know the
[1:33:48] definition of
[1:33:52] rain can you explain you okay we want to
[1:33:55] believe your message but what do you
[1:33:57] mean rain it's like out of the sky
[1:34:01] water's going to come down it says okay
[1:34:04] now remember but says more technological
[1:34:07] than we are with atomic bomb done things
[1:34:10] that we couldn't do kept colors for
[1:34:12] years that we things that we don't even
[1:34:14] know how they did so now they looking at
[1:34:17] him and says now you know that we have
[1:34:21] instruments that we can point out there
[1:34:23] and measure everything and come up with
[1:34:26] a measurement of what rain is or if
[1:34:28] anything is going to happen you know
[1:34:30] that yes I do but guess what God showed
[1:34:33] him a vision and I never stopped him the
[1:34:36] word he said God made himself reveal
[1:34:39] unto him God told him he gave him the
[1:34:42] commandment and nothing was going to
[1:34:44] stop
[1:34:45] him let me say this that's why the
[1:34:48] scripture says we walk by faith and not
[1:34:50] by sight we don't walk by what we see we
[1:34:53] don't react by what we see no what we
[1:34:56] need as children of God is to know what
[1:34:59] is it that's been revealed to us so we
[1:35:01] can walk by
[1:35:04] it the natural that you see will change
[1:35:08] every
[1:35:09] time it looked like there was going to
[1:35:12] be rain today but I looked at it my
[1:35:14] phone says it started off with 30 40%
[1:35:17] and now it's
[1:35:20] 1% what happened it changed
[1:35:24] so if we constantly get to a place where
[1:35:28] we need to see it where we need to see a
[1:35:31] movement and and we need to shout so we
[1:35:33] know we have it we need to scream so we
[1:35:35] know we have it this has to happen we
[1:35:37] have to have a service where everybody's
[1:35:39] up then we know we got it we're going to
[1:35:41] be the most miserable people we're going
[1:35:44] to shout our backs are going to hurt and
[1:35:46] we're going to come back and do it again
[1:35:48] and get hurt and everything what we need
[1:35:51] is to know what is the promise of God
[1:35:53] for our age what is it that he's made a
[1:35:56] promise unto me therefore it doesn't
[1:35:58] matter whether you feel it you don't
[1:36:00] feel it whether you see it you don't see
[1:36:02] it what you stand on is upon the word of
[1:36:05] God once Victory is revealed in the
[1:36:07] heart the natural circumstance doesn't
[1:36:10] mean
[1:36:13] anything but what I'm say so Noah stand
[1:36:16] there and now is telling them it's going
[1:36:18] to rain and they knew that God watered
[1:36:21] the Earth he knew that there was a d th
[1:36:25] Came Upon the vegetation and everything
[1:36:28] and that's everything was water they
[1:36:30] never knew or understood anything about
[1:36:33] the rain but God told him it was going
[1:36:35] to rain and Noah believed the word of
[1:36:38] God and God made his promise to come
[1:36:42] true but
[1:36:47] says it says this it
[1:36:49] says most people today and our repeat
[1:36:54] myself I will repeat myself from last
[1:36:57] night saying they have hope instead of
[1:37:00] faith and I find people coming to the
[1:37:03] platform they're just built up in hopes
[1:37:07] but faith is the substance of things
[1:37:10] hope for the evidence the evidence it's
[1:37:14] not a myth it's not an imagination it's
[1:37:18] something you've
[1:37:21] got it's something
[1:37:24] you've got yes
[1:37:26] sir
[1:37:28] oh butam says that Moses was born with
[1:37:32] the
[1:37:34] instrument in him to get the job
[1:37:39] done you are you with me when when when
[1:37:43] a Believer comes on the scene by
[1:37:46] election he has an instruments within
[1:37:49] him what the burning bush did was to
[1:37:52] activate the instruments that was in
[1:37:55] Moses so he can go and do the job his
[1:37:59] hearts always wanted to do the job his
[1:38:01] heart's always wanted for the people and
[1:38:03] everything but when he went and tried to
[1:38:06] do it by himself he failed he was called
[1:38:08] a murderer what he needed was an
[1:38:11] activation of the instruments that was
[1:38:13] within him so he can get the job done
[1:38:16] and God does the same thing for every
[1:38:19] son and daughter of God he places the
[1:38:22] instruments inside of you you so when
[1:38:24] you hear the word of God by the baptism
[1:38:26] of the Holy Spirit your instrument is
[1:38:29] activated so you can have the faith so
[1:38:32] faith is something that is in
[1:38:36] you amen it's word coming upon word it's
[1:38:41] word activating word it's word bringing
[1:38:44] the word into
[1:38:46] existence he says for instance I it says
[1:38:50] I I it says if I'm starving to death and
[1:38:53] and and and and and I had a loaf of
[1:38:55] bread that cost a quarter it says but
[1:38:57] the loaf of bread it says now when I
[1:39:00] have a quarter in my hand it says I'm
[1:39:02] just as happy if I have the loaf of
[1:39:05] bread because it's a purchas fice of the
[1:39:08] bread and when I know in my heart that I
[1:39:12] have received it and I believe that God
[1:39:15] is giv it to me I'm just as happy with
[1:39:18] faith as if I as if I was if I had
[1:39:23] healing if I was healed because I'm
[1:39:27] going to be healed anyhow I've got the
[1:39:30] substance right now nobody can take it
[1:39:33] away from me I know it's right and I can
[1:39:36] be perseverant with that oh my brother
[1:39:40] my sister when you have faith you have
[1:39:42] Deliverance when you have faith you have
[1:39:44] healing when you have faith you have
[1:39:46] your children when you're afraid you
[1:39:48] have all that you're looking for so you
[1:39:50] might as well be happy with that than
[1:39:52] when thing is going to happen why
[1:39:55] because within your heart God has
[1:39:57] already show you that it's in
[1:40:01] there how come you're going to desire
[1:40:03] something that you couldn't even obtain
[1:40:06] now remember but what says
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:08] this sickness could not be
[1:40:11] manifested unless there was a Healer the
[1:40:15] Deep call unto the
[1:40:17] Deep the fish the fan on the fish's back
[1:40:21] God would have never given the handan on
[1:40:23] the fish back unless there was water so
[1:40:27] God would have never given you the
[1:40:29] desire to be a son unless in you there
[1:40:32] was an ability to be a son God would
[1:40:35] have never given you the ability to be
[1:40:37] an overcomer unless there was overcoming
[1:40:40] that was somewhere so all you're doing
[1:40:42] by crying out is allowing God to pour
[1:40:45] into you what you were supposed to be to
[1:40:48] begin
[1:40:51] with we already saved we already healed
[1:40:55] those are attributes of a Christian
[1:40:58] we're supposed to be perseverant about
[1:41:00] those things we're not supposed to give
[1:41:02] that to give
[1:41:05] up oh oh you know just walk with our
[1:41:08] head down I don't know I've been asking
[1:41:11] God and it's not
[1:41:14] happening it's the building of the
[1:41:19] character it's the setting up for what's
[1:41:22] about to happen let me say this why
[1:41:24] would you even need to be perseverant if
[1:41:27] there was nothing on the other
[1:41:31] side
[1:41:32] perseverance is the ability that God the
[1:41:36] patience that God places in you to
[1:41:39] continue to walk it's going to happen
[1:41:42] and as you're walking changes is
[1:41:44] happening by itself as you're walking
[1:41:47] like Abraham the more my flesh is dying
[1:41:51] the more faith I have about this living
[1:41:53] God
[1:41:53] the more I know I can't produce the Sun
[1:41:56] the more I know he's going to have to do
[1:41:58] it the more what was Abraham Faith
[1:42:00] counted for righteousness he said that
[1:42:03] the more that he knew his body was dying
[1:42:06] the more that he knew that God is able
[1:42:08] to bring the son and even when he was
[1:42:10] asked to offer the son he said the same
[1:42:13] God who gave Isaac from the
[1:42:16] dead Isaac came from the dead Isaac came
[1:42:20] from God he knew that he had no ability
[1:42:22] in to bring Isaac so if God provided
[1:42:26] Isaac when his body was dead God was
[1:42:28] able to raise Isaac from the
[1:42:32] dead persevering from the
[1:42:35] promise you know what I'm just going to
[1:42:37] do this because that's the only but when
[1:42:40] says they ask him about his mom he said
[1:42:42] I couldn't say anything because God
[1:42:43] didn't show
[1:42:47] me today we want people to just say
[1:42:50] things and people speak all kinds of
[1:42:53] things without even God showing
[1:42:55] them but we need is the revealing of the
[1:42:59] word of God in our hearts so we can walk
[1:43:02] by it if the musician could
[1:43:12] comeu but one says I know living in an
[1:43:17] intellectual age and scientific age it
[1:43:20] says and it was a prophet
[1:43:23] and the Lord told him that it was going
[1:43:26] to rain and after Noah hearing the voice
[1:43:29] of God being a prophet to the the
[1:43:33] prophet to the voice of God of the Lord
[1:43:36] the word of the Lord comes to the pro to
[1:43:38] his prophet he knew he was going it was
[1:43:41] going to rain no matter what no matter
[1:43:44] what anyone said whether whether he be
[1:43:47] ever
[1:43:49] reigned he
[1:43:51] says and he never had rained
[1:43:54] before God irrigated the ground the
[1:43:58] vegetation with irrigation from the
[1:44:01] springs and so forth in the
[1:44:04] earth there was never been a cloud in
[1:44:07] the sky but yet Noah knew that there was
[1:44:11] coming water from above how is he going
[1:44:15] to do it he doesn't know but he was so
[1:44:19] perseverant he went and built an ark
[1:44:22] according to the specification that God
[1:44:25] said to him for him to build it because
[1:44:29] he had heard the voice of
[1:44:33] God did you hear the voice of God in
[1:44:36] this same time do what the voice told
[1:44:39] you the rest God will take care of it
[1:44:43] you just follow the voice The Voice told
[1:44:45] me to go to church I'm in church The
[1:44:48] Voice told me to do this I'm just
[1:44:50] following the voice the voice that told
[1:44:52] you to do what what you do that voice
[1:44:55] will take care of everything else the
[1:44:57] voice that called you and say believe my
[1:44:59] word that voice will bring you to the
[1:45:02] next step that voice will provide what
[1:45:04] you have need of along the way you just
[1:45:06] follow the voice you just believe the
[1:45:09] voice your promise is to follow the
[1:45:11] voice it's God's place for him to bring
[1:45:15] those things to transpire into your life
[1:45:17] let's all stand
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:33] oh there's just so much that could be
[1:45:38] said but will use terminology like this
[1:45:42] and I and I and I and as as I read
[1:45:46] it I just pray that let let this become
[1:45:51] the echo of our heart
[1:45:54] it says when a man gets his answer from
[1:45:58] God there's nothing that can stop
[1:46:01] him when a man knows that the word knows
[1:46:05] that the word knows the word and the
[1:46:08] will of God he will become
[1:46:11] persistent when a man has victory in his
[1:46:15] heart when a man hears the voice of God
[1:46:19] so this things is always what God is
[1:46:22] doing inside of a man is always
[1:46:25] something that is been Quicken to you
[1:46:29] it's always God's ability to communicate
[1:46:31] directly with you it's always something
[1:46:34] that has happened to you according to
[1:46:36] what the promise is it's always God
[1:46:39] coming to do in your heart God letting
[1:46:41] you know it's always by Revelation it's
[1:46:44] never by knowledge so when we receive a
[1:46:47] revelation then we can walk remember he
[1:46:50] said if God told me that he was going to
[1:46:52] raise George White
[1:46:54] George Washington he says I'll call all
[1:46:56] the whole world and tell them about it
[1:46:57] that's
[1:47:00] right now that same God has told us that
[1:47:03] we're going to go into
[1:47:04] Rapture have we told
[1:47:08] everybody now we're not sure we're going
[1:47:10] now he said surely the elect will go
[1:47:15] into Rapture those that are elected will
[1:47:18] go into Rapture how are we going to know
[1:47:21] how do we know we're going to R in
[1:47:22] Rapture because he said
[1:47:26] it how do we know we are healed because
[1:47:29] he said we are
[1:47:31] healed now it's easy to believe it for
[1:47:34] healing for deliverance for whatever but
[1:47:36] it's hard to believe for Rapture no
[1:47:38] that's not how he want us to
[1:47:40] walk he wants us to believe every word
[1:47:44] of God every promise in the book of mine
[1:47:48] whatever he says whether I understand it
[1:47:50] don't understand it I'll walk by it
[1:47:52] whether it's manifested today or didn't
[1:47:55] manifest I'll believe it why because the
[1:47:57] same God is here to make his word a
[1:48:00] reality our gracious father we're so
[1:48:03] thankful Lord for your word
[1:48:06] and father we just want
[1:48:10] to say thank you Lord

[1:48:23] us father Christian walk is not made for
[1:48:26] the strong and the educated
[1:48:30] or the eloquent

[1:48:35] believe Lord and you promise that when
[1:48:39] we believe Lord that you will give us a
[1:48:42] revelation or something within our

[1:48:47] perseverant
[1:48:49] and perhaps not as fast as they
[1:48:54] the
[1:48:55] herrow father probably
[1:48:59] just the perhaps just the slow as the
[1:49:03] slowest animal that we know

[1:49:09] going to make
[1:49:10] it because your word said he that will

[1:49:33] in season we
