Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 30th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

You pray for [music] me that God keeps me. We'll ask brother Clever to come and open our service in a word of prayer. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you for the opportunity to be in your house this morning. And Lord, we we thank you for good health. We thank you, Lord, for um yet another chance, Lord, to [music] hear from thee, Lord, and that you may prepare our hearts for your soon coming. And we pray for those that are on the way and maybe those that couldn't make it. [music] And Lord, may the word today speak in a personal way to each one. Lord, you know all things. You know our requests before we even bring them. [music] And you've already made a way, Lord, be before we ask. And so we pray, Father, that you may minister to each need, those that are sick in the body, that you may touch [music] them, Lord. those that need any financial assistance, whatever it may be, Lord, thou knowest. We pray even for the singing of songs. [music] May each song, Lord, be inspired, Lord, to prepare our hearts for your word. Um, and we put the remainder of the service into your hands. And may we ask for your [music] will and for your way. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While we're [music] standing, we'll just turn to our psalm reading. Read out of Psalm 122. You may turn around and shake someone's hand. We'll read it together all the way down to the ninth verse. Starting with the first, it reads, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem. Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together, whether the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For there are set thrones of judgment, and thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. They shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companion's sakes, I will now say, "Peace be within thee." Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good. Amen. You may be seated. Believe key of F. Hold to God's unchanging hand. And time [singing] is filled [music] with swift transition. And none [singing] [music] of earth can stand. Oh, [music and singing] and build your hope. Something eternal.

Oh, and [music and singing] still more closely to him. [music] Oh, you got a hold. You got [music] a changing hand. [music] That's a changing hand. Oh, [music] when we hold something.

He [music] Oh, [singing] hallelujah. with [music] me. I'm rejoicing that indeed as I walk the narrow way for [music] the comfort of God with me. Hallelujah. We have a prayer request. Sister Chipotashi writes, [music] "I am requesting prayer for an unspoken prayer request." Brother Jeff and Coob writes the same unspoken prayer request. You know, we've got a lot of unspoken prayer requests and then we have the ones that we tell others. But in all reality, whether unspoken or not, God knows. And we believe that. So if you came into his house and you've got a burden on your heart for something and you wanting the Lord to move upon, make it known to him by the uplifting of your hands. We'll ask brother Tim to come at this time. And the brothers who bring their tithes and offerings, please come up. I believe there's a Sunday school announcement for in between services. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brief announcement. There will be practice for the Christmas play between services. There'll be lunch provided for the children. So, uh, immediately following they can gather over there and then pick up by 4:00 this afternoon. [clears throat] You know, it was just like this behind closed doors after Jesus resurrected and the disciples were gathered. He didn't have to open a door or window. He came in their midst. And Thomas wasn't there the first time. He said, 'Oh, unless I touch the prince, the nails in his hands, thrust my hand into his side, I won't believe it. Jesus gave him an extra opportunity. &gt;&gt; Eight days later, he came back again. If you read your Bible, he used the exact phrase Thomas did. I don't believe it's written in error. He touched the prince and I'll thrust my hands in the side. He came and told Thomas, look, do this [snorts] everyday terminology. The Godhead revealed. He said, "My Lord and my God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same one, Lord and God. That's who we're going to pray to right now. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for the opportunity. Lord, there may be a representative of Thomas here in our midst. Lord, [snorts] that's just borderline that's thinking. I believe it, but I'm not fully convinced. Lord, may you convince a heart today. [snorts] Convert us from within and without. Lord, if there be any misgivings or fears, Lord, may we fully recognize who you are. Lord, we ask that the requests that have been [snorts] spoken across this desk, Lord, they're very special unspoken needs, Lord. There's faith in our heart, believing that a combined faith, the prayer of the saints, Lord, can deliver the answer to their need. Lord, there's many upon our hearts. Lord, we cry out with earnest and [music] the groanings of our hearts. Lord, when we don't even know how to pray, you said there's a spirit that intercedes and recognizes the need. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we pray that you discern our thoughts and intents of our heart, Lord, and put you first, Lord, to get our families in and Lord, surely these these old frail and sick bodies, the pain, the discomfort, Lord, we just [snorts] lay it all on your altar today, Lord. ask you just relieve us of these symptoms, Lord, that we might glorify you a little greater, give you more praise. [snorts] And Lord, may we confirm once again that you are the healer of all our diseases, Lord. [snorts] Lord, but truly our main benefit and reason for coming, Lord, is the preaching of the word, Lord. We pray that the the [clears throat] revealed word can be like a sav Lord that just heals all of the deep wounds, the scars [snorts] and Lord refreshes us over again and Lord just drives out the enemy. We pray that you just have your will and way. [snorts] Use us for your honor and your glory. Lord, that we can say amen to everything that your prophet said. Lord, we ask that you just bless the tithes and the offering. Use it for your honor and glory as you see fit. And [snorts] Lord, truly prepare our hearts for that preaching of the word. We give you the honor, the glory, and the praise in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] I have this song on my heart. The greatest love story. I left the barren land searching [singing] for rest. Stumbling around [music] in amnesia, bitterness [singing] and distress. But then I met the kinsman redeemer [music and singing] who is called the mighty one. He took this old mobile [music and singing] from the field and to bring me to [music and singing] his house. He said, [music and singing] "Fear not my child, for you are part of me [singing] and I'll not [music] rest till you are at my side. [singing] And I'll do [music] all the king. that you love me. You are Jehovah, [singing and music] my heart, virtuous woman. Oh, you are [music] my pride. Sounded to your [music and singing] call. Oh, and you have covered me. [music] Open eyes of faith. I [singing] see all [music] the mysteries being revealed. And now [singing] I see who I am. And I [music] lay claim to all that's mine. I'm the lamb's wife. [music and singing] And I've been born with a cross. He [music] said, "Fear [singing] not my child. Oh, for you are [music] me and I to you are [music and singing] at my side. I do all that you [music] ask of me. Your tool [singing] in my eyes. virtuous [music] for you are [singing] my cry. When I look back, I look back and see [music] how much [singing] grace and love you show me. Lord, it [music] brings me to my knees. That you could even think about me when I believe. You're still Jehovah [music] from Gyra. You're still the great healer [singing] with faith. [music] I'll stand on the word cuz you're more than [music] fear not my child [singing] for you are [music] part of me. to you are [singing] at my side. [music] Not all [singing] that you that's [music] of me or in my heart. [singing] Virgin was [music] born. You are my rock. And so I'm casting [music] all my care. And so I'm casting all [singing] my cares on you. Oh, [music] I love you. [singing] [music] Oh, redemption. [music and singing] Oh my [music and singing] god. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] Just [music] the mighty redeemer. [singing] his presence. [music] Oh, and he's coming [singing] back for you and me. [music] Oh, and [singing] so I'm casting all my cares [music] on you. Lord Jesus, I know [singing] you [music] love me. Oh, I know you love me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My love [singing] and master [music and singing] is the story for restoration [music and singing] for restoration for [music and singing] That's what seven angels [music] [singing] no [singing] longer pres. [music] Let's all stand and sing this song. Let's sing the blood there. There is king of F. [music] There is a blood [music] that cost a life. Oh, that paid my way. And at [music] its price when it flowed down [music and singing] from the cross. Oh, my sins were gone. my sins [music] forgot. [singing] There is a grave that [music and singing] tried to hide. Oh, his precious [music] blood. Oh, that [singing] gave me life. [music] Oh, what a free day. He [music] again to stand in my defense. [music] And so I come to tell you he's alive. [music] telling [singing] that he never [music] so I come to tell you [music] that he say to shout [music] that he's coming back for you. &gt;&gt; We invite our pastor [music] at this time. It is [music] the se the [singing] fight. It [music] has the power to free [singing] the [music] as they fall upon the ground. of glor [music] to bless my soul and [music] glory because [music] he liv [singing] my love. [music] I know. [music] Oh, I [singing] come to tell [music] you he's tell every [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; shout and to proclaim [music] glor. Oh [music] gracious father, if that could become a reality that you're coming back. [music] The world doesn't believe it. They think they're going to Mars and they [music] think they're going to live in space and [snorts and crying] they think when they destroy this earth [music] that their science and technology is going to take them to other worlds and other [music] lands. And but Father, we're looking for a place so much [music] farther away than this universe. And we know that you're coming to take those that believe in you back to that place from whence we [music] came. We're grateful for that today. Father, as we endure this life here on earth and as we're tempted and tried, we're tested and [music] the sufferings that come our way. We just ask for your grace and your mercy to give us the strength to endure all things. And look up for we know our redemption [music] drawth nigh. Bless us this morning. We ask these things in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You may be seated. [snorts] We we're going to do a baby dedication. So, don't run away. Amen. Uh, hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving and uh your turkey was perfect and your mashed potatoes were creamy. [snorts] Your pumpkin pies were sweet and you're satisfied and and we trust that the word of God will satisfy us this morning. Amen. Uh we love the word of the Lord. But this morning we have a baby dedication and uh brother Caleb and Mida are going to dedicate their baby Moses and uh so um Moses Ephraim homeover. So uh brother Caleb and sister me are you here? If you're here, if you'd bring your baby. I don't Oh, here they come. [music] Let's sing that as they come. Amen. [singing and music] Oh, bring [music and singing] them in. Bring down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Look at you, sister. God bless you. I remember the days he's just looking for a wife so bad. And now he's married and has a baby. God's good is he. Amen. I like to read this little scripture. It says here, it says, "And then there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray." And the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, "Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me, for such is the kingdom of heaven." Amen. And and so that's what we're here to do today. And and uh Hi, buddy. Oh, you got to turn him and show him. He's a handsome little fella. You know, it it's a miracle how such beautiful things come come out of, you know, it just I didn't say it, but anyway, we're happy. So, we're going to ask you to bless your child and then we'll all join in and bless them, dedicate them to the Lord. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our blessed heavenly father, we are so grateful and thankful unto you for this great thing that you have done for us. Indeed, it is great and it is marvelous in our eyes and we give you all the uh appreciation. Heavenly Father, from the time you called your servant Abraham and told him that his seed will sen in a strange land, but after 400 years, you bring them out. You had your servant Moses in mind. And dear Lord Jesus, right from the time of his birth, it was you protecting him against an evil decree. And Lord Jesus, even when he was put on a crocodileinfested river, Lord Jesus, you protected him as well. When he came of age, your prophet would tell us that he made a decision, a choice by faith to serve you and to live for you. He had Egypt, the throne, beckoning at him. But he put all on one scale and threw it away. It is something that only your grace helped him to do. And Lord Jesus, we are praying this moment that that same grace that protected him from the time of birth and also helped him to make that correct choice be upon this child. Help him, oh Lord Jesus, regardless of every other pursuit in this life to make his primary goal and focus as living for you and serving you all the days of his life. Help us oh Lord Jesus as parents to provide the right environment for him to be good models to be good examples unto him. Help us Lord as a church body to live peaceably with him as well. Lord Jesus as many as are also waiting on you for this blessing. We pray that you visit them by their address and provide for them as well. We thank you. We bless your holy name in Jesus name I have prayed. Amen. Let's all bless a blessing. Our gracious heavenly father, we ask you to bless Moses this morning. Father, you'll see that all things are perfectly and well done. Be with him, Father, as we continue this service this morning. May the testimony of Moses be his. We ask it in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you so much. Be with you. Amen. and you love the Lord &gt;&gt; this morning. Well, [snorts] uh [music] you know God knows how to do all things well. You believe that? So [music] this morning, uh we're going to listen to by faith Moses. Now, I don't know if you believe in signs and I don't know if you believe in those things, but I do. God bless you. Thank you, musicians. Uh, I think it's a uh I I think it all things work together for the good, &gt;&gt; don't you? This is a marvelous little message. Uh, it was it was preached uh I I believe in in 1958. Uh uh yeah, July 20th, 1958. But you know, one thing I found out about the word, I don't know if I found it out, but I I realize it more and more. The word of God's eternal. And it doesn't matter when it was preached. You know, people will will try to put a date on the word of God, but you know, I pick up my Bible and I read in Genesis and and I don't know how many years ago that was written. And you know, and you know, sometimes people will they will say, "Well, you're following a message and your messenger left 50 years ago." But that that was just the time in time &gt;&gt; when he decided to bring the message. But the message is the eternal word of God. it it if it was preached whenever it was preached, it didn't matter the calendar time, it was still the truth. &gt;&gt; And and it's the truth that sets you free. And [snorts] it it still it still speaks for itself. And I think that's what's so marvelous about the word of God is the word of God speaks for itself. And in other words, by that it actually vindicates itself by bringing to pass the very things that it says. And you you know and it how how can I I sit down and maybe read the book of Ephesians that Paul wrote to the church of Ephesus and I sit there and I read it and it just feeds my soul. You know it's you know it's it's it was actually not even written in all direct reality to me. In other words, it didn't say David, but I put my name in there. And [snorts] then I find out he wasn't just writing to the church. He was writing to the believer. &gt;&gt; And once I put myself in the category of a believer, then that word is my possession. &gt;&gt; And and I I think that uh we we're going to listen to just 30 minutes. That's not too long. uh and it it and the message is called by faith. And and so we want to just minister a little bit this morning on faith. And so I was I was I was uh praying and and and meditating and thinking I I wanted to preach on faith. And so, you know, I I went over and I thought, you know, I I need to find a place and and th the this message was sitting right in the front of my books and it's never been there. You know what I mean? All my books start in ' 62 and right on in the front of my 1965 books was this message. and I don't know how it got there. And and so I thought, well, that's strange. And so I started reading it and I thought, "Oh, this is everything I wanted to bring out." &gt;&gt; You know, and so the Lord knows that I couldn't bring it out, so he got a prophet to bring it out for me. [snorts] And so if if uh uh you want to say that, well, as somebody told me, he said, the only reason you play tapes is you can't preach. And I got to thinking, yeah, [snorts] that's right. But when I play tapes, I'm playing the best preacher there is. So, &gt;&gt; you know, at least we're hearing the best preacher there is, you know, and and and so we'll enjoy that. So, I think that you'll enjoy this this morning. So, [snorts] we're going to listen to 30 minutes. We'll go back and point out some things. And we hope this morning that we can come down to the the root core of what it is that we really have to start relying on to move forward. And uh and uh it it's marvelous. So, we're going to start by reading in the the 11th chapter of the uh book of Hebrews and um and uh and the and starting with the 23rd verse and and so we'll uh we'll listen to that uh Hebrews uh 23 and it starts out by faith Moses and and the little sermon title if some of you might be able to pull it up on your phones and read along. Uh [snorts] just as long as you put them or they won't go off. Uh by faith Moses. And so that's going to be the title sermon. And uh and we're going to start in the message from paragraph 33 to the end of paragraph 84. And uh and I hope that that it's a blessing. The quality of the tape is pretty good. So I think that that part of it will be good. And we're just only asking you for just to be pay attention for 30 minutes. That's not long. And uh uh so I I I just trust that you'll be blessed this morning. So let's go to the Lord in prayer and ask him to bless us. our gracious father this morning. Lord, we know that without faith it's impossible to please you. And Lord, we in our hearts, we know that like the man that you were praying for his child and he finally looked at you in all earnest and he said, "Lord, help my unbelief." [snorts] Father, because we know that if we can believe, all things are possible. So this morning, Father, we ask that you would help our faith. give us a greater understanding of what faith is, what it does for us. It's the key to the door for every believer. It's the path forward for every believer. And so this morning, Father, with your goodness and kindness. We ask that you would revelate us this morning by speaking to us the eternal words of life. Bless each heart. May they be encouraged, Father. May they reach out this morning even while we're listening to this eternal word and touch the hem of your garment and claim all the heart's desires that they have. We ask that you'd grant this to us this morning in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. God bless you this morning as we begin to listen to let us stand and as as we he reads the scriptures and then when he's uh done with the scripture uh on the uh and then he'll say I want to take the subject this morning uh choosing by faith. So our our our me subject this morning is choosing by faith. God bless you this and you may be seated after he reads the scripture. Thank you. And I thought maybe this morning it would be appropriate to open again this wonderful book being that we have the backgrounds to what we wish to say in the former readings and skipping over the 10th chapter and the ninth chapter which is the sacrificial laws we would come into a spot of faith. And here in the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter and beginning with the 23rd verse we read it like this. By faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. By faith, Moses, when he came to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeing the reproach of Christ greater riches. than the treasures of Egypt, and had recompense unto the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisibly. I want to take the subject this morning, choosing by faith and I want to take for a text the first three words of the 23rd uh chapter by faith Moses and choosing by faith most everything that we do we have to choose by faith. And all that we find that Moses did that's worth repeating was by faith. Not by sight but by faith. And the reason that I have selected this this morning for the church in this state has been that in our even our schools and around we have had so much of scientific teaching because of this we have drawn the people away from faith. Now faith is not proved by science. Faith is what science doesn't see. And we if we ever lose this great faith then we are totally in darkness. It no matter how well we are educated how we could explain the word of God to suit our own way of believing. There is no way to ever please God only by faith. The scripture plainly states it that way. And it's by faith and without faith, says the scripture, it is impossible to please God. So if faith disagrees with science and science disagrees with faith that puts them at at edge in each other then we must take a choice as Moses did by faith we believe. Now if we lose faith then we will never get a prayer answered by God. For he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him. So if we lose faith, our prayers are analled. We get nowhere. So it's all that we can think of this morning is to hold on to faith. Then if we lose faith all our hopes is gone. And if we lose faith all our spiritual reality is gone. For you cannot have faith in things that you see. For the things that you see are all perishable. If we look at some great person, a great minister or a great congregation, they will all perish someday. And if we look at a great nation or a great weapon, they'll all perish someday. And then we must live by faith of those things that science does not declare. It's by faith that we believe. Now we lose our glory if we lose faith. Now if we get away from faith then we take the church into an intellectual realm. And many times it's been thought amongst people that because a congregation was large and they had great churches, great people and a great lot of welldressed and groomed peoples and a lot of uh finances that they could afford such things. We've many times thought that was inspiring, that this certain church must be inspired. Or we've often referred to different ministers who get out on the field and have great gatherings of crowds and we think sometimes that they are the signs of inspiration, but that's not altogether the truth. That's human inspiration. But the real inspiration comes by doing the will of God. &gt;&gt; See, whether it is a one or just a handful, whether it is a big church or a small church, it matters not. Whether he is a great eloquent speaker or just a man that hardly knows his ABCs. It doesn't matter. It depends on the message that he's bringing &gt;&gt; whether it is inspired by the word of God or is it inspired by intellectual conceptions of human inspiration. Some people can be inspired because of an eloquent speaker. That doesn't make it right. Sometimes they're inspired because the man is so trained that he can put his point over it. That doesn't mean that it's of God. See, it's only through God's everlasting eternal blessed word can we receive inspiration and that's given by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; By faith we receive it. Now we would think of Moses and this great time of his life and we read back of his birth and how that God had cared for him. But there come a time in Moses life to where there had to be a choosing time. If we read right, we find out that he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter and was the heir to the throne and would have been the next Pharaoh in Egypt. So he would notice as he looked around after he had become of age and other accountability and there would be those slaves working out in the slime pits. And Moses as he looked through the windows of the palace upon the same slaves that Pharaoh looked on. [clears throat] But what a difference there was in the looking. I want to base that thought this morning for a few minutes and may the God of heaven drive it home to every heart here. It's how you look at anything what makes the difference. &gt;&gt; The great evangelist John Sproul which was a convert of brother Bosworth's ministry who many of you remember years ago of the old glory barn. He said one day he was taking a trip before the deceasing of his beloved companion and wife. They were in Las Salarine's France and I had the privilege of visiting the same place and the guide was taking them out through the gardens and showing them the different things and they come upon a certain statue of the Lord Jesus the crucifixion and Mr. brother was standing off looking at it. He and his wife and in their hearts were criticizing what the artists must have had in mind or the sculpture rather when he heed out of a stone such a horrible looking thing to be to represent the suffering and the love and the pity of the Lord Jesus and how it was all crudely and chopped up looking and the guide came to Mr. Sproul and he said, "Sir, I suppose that you are criticizing this statue of the Lord Jesus." And he said, "I am." And he said, "I'm not a bit surprised because most people that look at it first, they do criticize it." And Mr. scroll said, "Well, I can't see any pity or any inspiration from looking at such a thing. So, I'm wondering why the sculpture every made it like this." And the sculpture said, "Mr. Skull, the statue's all right." and the sculpture had the right thing in his mind, but where the trouble is is with you. &gt;&gt; It's the way you're looking at it." And he took he and his wife by the hand and led them down to a a altar at the foot of the said cross. And he said, "Now, Mr. Spr look up now. And when he looked up, he said his heart like to have failed him. What a difference it was to stand off there and look at it that way and to get down and look at it the way that it was made to look at. And that's the way that God is. That's the way that faith is. It's the way you look at it. If you look at it as some sort of a historical Bible of something that was in the days gone by, you will never be able to get the real value of the Bible. You are supposed to get on your knees and oy the commandments of this Bible and look at it through the eyes of the Holy Spirit. I would ask this audience this morning. What good does a historical God do us today if he isn't the same God? What good does a God that would take Moses and do the miracles with him that he did? What good would it do us to read of such a God if he isn't the same one today? &gt;&gt; What good is a God that could deliver from the fiery furnace the Hebrew children if he isn't the same God today? Amen. &gt;&gt; What God is the God that would judge between right and wrong in a day gone by and punish the wrong and bless the right? If he isn't the same God today, what do we go to church for? Why do we abstain from things of the world if he isn't the same God of the same judgment and the same opinion that he always was? What good would it be for a God who could touch a woman's hand with a raging fever &gt;&gt; and the fever stopped? If he isn't the same God today, &gt;&gt; what good would it be to serve a God who could call his friend from a grave after being dead four days if he isn't the same God today? By faith we believe that some glorious day he shall call us from the earth. Though we be a spoonful of ashes again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How do we prove it? We do not prove it. We believe it. &gt;&gt; We're not asked to prove anything. We're asked to believe it. &gt;&gt; By faith. Moses did such and such. And as Moses as a young man looked through the palace window at the slaves, he saw the same bunch of grimy, dirty, muckridden slaves that Pharaoh saw. And when Pharaoh looked upon him and the Egyptians, they wasn't nothing but a bunch of slaves. That's all they were good for, just to be human mudbers to make muddy bricks for the benefit of the cities that Pharaoh was building. That's the way mo the Egyptians and Pharaoh looked at the slaves. But Moses when he looked at him, it was a different look Moses had when he seen passing by [laughter] the window. [clears throat] The great ditches in their face, the tears that run down their cheeks and their bent bodies. Oh God. &gt;&gt; He looked upon them as the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't look upon them as slaves. He looked upon them as the chosen people of God. Oh, as I go about from country to country and from nation to nation preaching since I left the doors of this little tabernacle that's an interdenominational institution with no law but love, [screaming] no book but the Bible, no creed but Christ. I've tried to look upon God's children and upon the rejected as being God's chosen and elected people. I don't ask them if they belong to the Brandon Tabernacle. I don't ask them if they're Methodists or if they are Presbyterians or if they are Pentecostals or Nazarines are pilgrim holiness. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; I just want to look upon them as the people of God. &gt;&gt; I'm seeing their doings and their actions that they are the servants of the Lord God and my heart desires fellowship with them. &gt;&gt; No matter what brand they got, I just long for their fellowship. I love them because I know they are people of God. When I see a woman coming down the street with a long skirt and her hair done up neatly in the back and and a decent looking dress on and I see another young lady, maybe the same age with a little pair of shorts on. She may be in looks twice as pity as the woman with the long hair according to the looking of the world, but I [screaming] take my side with that girl that's dressed like a Christian. &gt;&gt; Though they'd be laughing at her and calling her a fanatic, yet I take my side. She might not be as pretty as the other girl featurely, but she sees something &gt;&gt; by faith. She sees him who is invisible, who is guiding her life. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I see the man on the job being called deacon or preacher or a fanatic because he refuses to smoke and to drink beer and to go to dances like the rest of them and he's called a fanatic. My heart goes out for him. &gt;&gt; He is my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. down in this Egypt soils. That makes our heart long to embrace him and say, "Brother, we are pilgrims and strangers of this land, and I long to fellowship with you." Moses had to make a choice, choosing by faith. How many young men would have jumped at the opportunity to become the son of Pharaoh's daughter? How many young men would have jumped at the opportunity that Moses had to enjoy all the pleasures and the glamour of the world to become the king of Egypt to have the whole world at his feet. What a foolish thing that the young man of his days must have thought when Moses chose to take his place with the afflicted and suffering people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? By faith. When he lifted up his eyes, he looked beyond the grammar of this world. He looked beyond the pleasures of sin. And the Bible said that he endured as seeing him who was invisible by faith. And he made a choice to serve that God regardless of what took place. It has not changed. Many of us could go to what we would call a better building. We could enjoy maybe the fellowship and pleasures of sitting in a better pew. We might be more popular to drink and to smoke and to dress and to act like the world. But what's the matter? You've lifted up your eyes and by faith you see him who is invisible and have took your stand with the rejected and so-called holy rulers of the day. &gt;&gt; For by faith we see him who is invisible choosing to suffer the persecutions and the afflictions. I wouldn't say to people that they should choose to be afflicted. I don't say that you should choose suffering. It would not be the human thing to do. But if suffering lays in the path of duty, then let's take it as it comes. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to do something for somebody to make fun of you. I wouldn't want you to say uh uh different things that I'm uh I belong to a church that doesn't believe in so and so in the worlds and things like that just to get people to make fun of you. You're bringing that on yourself. I wouldn't say for you get out here and carry on and do something that was radical. I wouldn't want you to do that so that somebody would say that you are a fanatic. You bring that on yourself. But if it lays in the path of your duty towards God, let the world say what they want to say. &gt;&gt; You live alone. &gt;&gt; You make a choice. Every man and woman has to make this. What if Pharaoh could have saw what Moses saw? He saw the sufferings of the people. He knew what the price was to pay. But by faith he chose it rather than to have the pleasures of sin. Is maybe a little young ladies sitting here as glamorous young women. The world would like to say to you, do thus and thus you are beautiful. Your body is so pretty shape. You should show that. But my sister, raise up your eyes and look beyond that to him that said it's an abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man. [clears throat] If the men of the people in your community, if the women that you associate with said, "Cut that long hair off." It would be cooler. [clears throat] It would be this that or the other. Or it would become you better. Don't you listen to that. You lift up your eyes and by faith saw him that said the woman's hair is her glory and she shall not cut it. If they say it would be popular, you would stand in better with your job or with your boss if you take a sociable drink. If you would smoke cigarettes like the rest of the women, you would stand in more sociably in your neighborhood by faith. Raise your eyes [screaming] and look to him who said, "Destpile this body and I will destroy it." By faith, we believe those things. It's nothing that you see. It's something [snorts] you believe. By faith, Moses did. And in this faith walk, there comes a time there has to be a choice. Lot made that sad mistake that we make. A lot of times we choose for our own good. We choose things that would be a better sometime if a little squabble comes in the church and someone would say, "Well, the deacon or the pastors on this side." Don't look at that. Look at what's righteous. &gt;&gt; Get that thing out and bring them both together. That's godly. &gt;&gt; There's a choosing and we choose for ourselves. We choose something that's for our own good. But Moses chose the afflictions and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God. Think of it now. Listen to it. chose the afflictions of the people of God and counted it a greater treasure for he endured seeing him who was invisible. Now Lot one time had to make a choice. And it may be this morning that there will be men and women sitting here that'll make your final choice. you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from today five years today you may be a missionary five years today you may be a renowned Christian or five years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision five years today you may be cleaning spit tunes in a barroom five years today you You may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man or a woman that's a that's a cred to any society because of your choice for Christ. Five years today you may be in glory gone in the rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose and don't look at what you see. Choose what you see by faith. That's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith. Lot as he had to make a choice. Abraham gave Lot his choice and God gives you your choice. Choose you this day who you shall serve. In the Garden of Eden, there was a tree of of knowledge and a tree of life. Man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired. And so is it today you're giving your privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose. My advice to you is don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be. But choose rather [screaming] by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and will writen all wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up. No matter if you take the despised way with the Lord's view, make that choice. If there's troubles in the hand, if there's troubles in the land, if there's troubles in the church, if there's troubles in the home, no matter where it is, make your [screaming] choice by faith. I'll serve God. &gt;&gt; I'll humble my heart in his presence. I'll take the way with God's children. I'll see them despised and rejected and drove out and made fun of, but I'll still take my post of duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll stay right by them. And when they cry, I'll cry with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when there's sorrow, I shall sorrow with them. &gt;&gt; The way they live, I'll live. Like Noma said, Arus said to Noma, "Your ways be my ways, my ways be your ways. Where you live, I'll live. Where you go, I'll go." The God that you serve will be my God. Take that choice. though it pulls the very skin off of your conscience &gt;&gt; of thinking that you're somebody. Skin yourself down and take your away with the Lord's despised few. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And stay loyal on the field of service and at the post of duty. That's pretty good. &gt;&gt; I hope you were able to stay concentrated for those 30 minutes. You know, that was a choice of whether you'd listen or whether you daydream off. But there there's there are so many uh great things that uh were uh spoken there, you know, by faith. It's it's it's a a a choice. And and if we just skim back through it, uh we we would see that that uh you know it if you have your Bibles where you're sitting and you would turn to Hebrews uh the 4th chapter and the second verse um and uh to bring some importance uh and reence to it to where that we uh here it says in the Hebrews the 4th chapter it says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entertaining unto his entering into his rest and ye should seem to come short of it. So he says let let us fear therefore you know that a promise that's being made to us that we fall short of it. So think of all the promises that have been given to us in the scripture and we fall short of those promises. Now, Paul's going to give us the reason why it is that we fall short of the promises that we fall short. And uh and then he goes on to say, he says, "For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them." So this morning, the gospel was preached to everybody in here. It's what he said. But the word preached did not profit them. In other words, it had no effect. It had no influence. It didn't do them any good. They heard it. They heard it just like you heard it. And they fell short of what was promised in the word to them. They they didn't obtain the promise. They fell short of it be be. He said they fell short of it. It it didn't profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. Not being mixed with faith. And and we we see that uh so often. And we we we as we heard this morning that faith is a choice. And so we see it so often. We see people come pray for things and they they pray for things over and over and over again or they'll come to the altar and you know sometimes people they they say I hear it all the time you know that I I don't believe in in shouting and I don't believe in the movement of the Holy Spirit and I don't believe in the anointing and that's okay. I'm willing to bear that approach. But I know one thing, you know, like Paul said, I I've laid my hands on the sick and seen them recover. You know, I I've seen people that had demons and I've seen demons cast out, &gt;&gt; you know, and and those things aren't by anointing, they're by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's by faith that it's impossible to please God without faith and not be mixed with faith. And so that's what our hearts desire this morning is that we could come to the spot that we could start mixing the word of God. They hear the word of God. The word of God's preached to them and it has effect on them. Many times it brings them to the altar. And we just heard our messenger say, "Some people are inspired by by great ministries or they're inspired because somebody can put their point across. You just they just got the ability to put their point across." And and and that that's the inspiration. And maybe they come to the altar under that inspiration and under that anointing, but they leave without it profiting them anything. &gt;&gt; Now, as a pastor, that's what breaks my heart. &gt;&gt; Because they it wasn't mixed with faith. They they they they came to repent but not to receive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They came to acknowledge but not be delivered. &gt;&gt; You could preach a sermon that puts everybody in here under condemnation. &gt;&gt; Because the more I make you look at yourself, the more you'll feel unworthy. The more I bring up circumstances, the more you'll realize your failures. &gt;&gt; And pretty soon you feel, well, I'm unworthy. I've sinned. I'm a failure. And then you come to the altar and you and you weep and you cry. I'm a failure. How many times have I prayed for people at the altar and they f get to the bottom of the matter and the only reason they're there is because they believe the accusation that Satan accused them of is that not what he told us? &gt;&gt; Let me just read it to you. He says, he said, "And choose by faith." Most everything we do, we have to choose by faith. And all that we find as Moses did that's worth repeating was by faith. Not by sight, but by faith. Sometimes we put faith in the accusation. &gt;&gt; We believe what he said. &gt;&gt; And it's good to be convicted. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit's job is, is to convict you of sin. &gt;&gt; But it isn't to leave you a sinner. It isn't to just prove that that you you don't have the spirit. Sometimes we spend so much time trying to prove to people you don't have the Holy Spirit. You don't have the Holy Spirit. You're not born again. You know, when you got the Holy Spirit in the thinking of God before there ever was a [screaming] world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you had eternal life, you always have eternal life. There is only one spirit and that's the Holy Spirit. Don't mix up anointing with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit amens every word of God. The Holy Spirit mixes faith. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit does. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; gives you faith. &gt;&gt; I've seen him sit there and and and it and just because Satan told them something and they believed it. Why? He's the accuser of the brethren. He's got your history book. Have you ever thought of something you did maybe 20 years ago? Something you said and all of a sudden you get all embarrassed. You feel embarrassed. I can't believe I did that. I can't believe I said that. And you actually feel embarrassed. And it's history. &gt;&gt; It's the past. So it's got to be mixed with faith. And I said it last week, I'll say it again. If you've repented of your sins and you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. &gt;&gt; Now, if you mix that with faith, [snorts] &gt;&gt; right? What was the faith of Abraham? He who made the promise was able to keep the promise. &gt;&gt; If if I say that I I' I've repented of my sins, I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. You can approach it two ways. &gt;&gt; You can come to the altar every service &gt;&gt; and you can cry and beg for the Holy Spirit and you will get it. Or you can sit in your seat &gt;&gt; and say, "Praise God. I'm promised the Holy Spirit and you will get it. The way of faith &gt;&gt; is faster &gt;&gt; because someday it's got to be mixed with faith &gt;&gt; in order to profit it. You got to believe that it's for you. You got to believe it's yours. You got to believe it's a promise. &gt;&gt; And the God who made the promise. I like what the prophet of God said. He said, "God isn't an Indian giver. He doesn't give a promise and then take it away. &gt;&gt; The only requirement you have to have for that promise to become a reality to you is mix it with faith and then it becomes profitable. But he always tries to rob us again. Just listen to some of the wonderful things he said and and why faith is so important. He said he said this is a reason I've selected this this morning for the church in this state. And you know that doesn't mean the state of Indiana in its condition. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The reason the Holy Spirit has brought us this message this morning is because of our condition. In other words, we're hearing the word of God. intellectually conception. We accept it as truth, but we're not mixing it with faith that it becomes a reality and a possession because faith is an evidence of possession. You know, you got it. It's something that is so real to you. But remember what he said, faith is the way that you look at it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Faith is the choice of how that you choose to look at the circumstance, how you try to look at your history, how you choose to look at your past, how you choose to look at the present. If it's how that you choose to draw the picture to perceive the environment, how that you choose to to accept what's going on either by accusation or by God's word. Faith is how that you look at it. That's what he said. He said now why is it so important that we don't lose faith? He says because it's a condition. It says we have so much scientific teaching, so much education, so much technology, so much psychology, so much philosophy, [snorts] so much influence in rock and roll music and in political divide and in intellectual conceptions being tossed to our minds. That's all under science, education, and civilization. All of it's designed to destroy our faith. Because of this, we have drawn the people away from faith. Everything's working to draw us away from faith. &gt;&gt; Because faith, when a promise is mixed with faith, then it's profitable. &gt;&gt; You can accept the promise. You can believe in the promise giver. You can believe the promise is true, but it'll never come to you till you mix it with faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like forgiveness, &gt;&gt; he said he forgive you of your sin. You've got to accept it. You've got to mix that with faith. Just like the scripture says, it says in Isaiah 53 and five, I believe it is. Uh yeah. the chastisement of his peace was upon us. In other words, the scripture says that he took the punishment for our sin. How many times do we go through this where we do something or something bad comes upon us or things don't go the way that we thought they should go or the what we've been longing for h has taken a while to arrive and all of a sudden we start looking at ourselves and saying it's because I did this, it's because I did that, it's because of this, and it's because of that. And we go all back through our history, and now we think that we're paying the price for the things we do. And then maybe even the scripture will rise up in our mind. Well, you're reaping what you sowed. And and now you're in this big negative spiral. Well, if you want to look at it that way, that's the way it'll be. If that's what you're going to believe, then now your faith in that now makes you accept that as a reality. &gt;&gt; Or you could look at it through the word of God. I do deserve this. But he took the punishment &gt;&gt; for my past. &gt;&gt; There's no way this can be a punishment &gt;&gt; because he already bore the punishment by his stripes. There's no way this is God punishing me &gt;&gt; for the things I've done cuz he paid for that punishment. Now if you mix that with faith and you believe that all of a sudden you can start turning to the circumstances and seeing those circumstances in different light. Then you can say, "Satan, &gt;&gt; get behind me. &gt;&gt; It is written, &gt;&gt; he bore my sufferings. &gt;&gt; By his stripes, I am healed." Now, it profits you something. Cuz it's mixed with faith. It becomes something that does something for you. He said, "My burden was light. and we carry a load. And yet we find out that he said he'd carry our burden. Cast your cares upon him for he carth for you. Now that's a nice saying, isn't it? But if you don't mix it with faith, faith changes the way you look at it. It changes the way that you see it. All of a sudden, it could be a burden. [snorts] Maybe your finances are pressing you. But by faith, he said, "I shall not see the righteous bake bread." [snorts] By faith, you can say, "Lord, I'm going through a hard time, but you're the Lord thy God that deliverth me out of all my troubles." &gt;&gt; By faith, it changes it. Until it's mixed with faith, you can't go forward. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he said. How how important I I I wish I could drive this down. I wish I had the ministry like we just heard to make it so real to you. There's only two powers, doubt and faith. Faith is associated with love. He says here he says &gt;&gt; he says if we ever lose the great faith then we are totally in darkness. If you ever lose faith you become totally in darkness. You will let the darkness of Satan's lies. You let the darkness of this earth now determine how that you're looking at things. You can look at this world as being a terrible place. Or you can look at it and say, "Some glad morning when the battle's over, I'll fly away. &gt;&gt; This is not my home. I'm just so journeying through here. By faith, he's coming to get me. I will not go through the tribulation." by the word of God. You start viewing things through the eyes of God's word and you believe that what God said is true. It changes things. &gt;&gt; The burden isn't so heavy. &gt;&gt; You begin to say, "Oh, the trying of my faith for a season." Rejoice at the trying of your faith. The fiery darts of the enemy are more precious in gold than silver. Why wouldn't that be? Some of the devil's just thinging arrows and you're getting, you know, and I mean, you're about just to cave in and Satan says, "I've got you. I'm bringing you down." And you say, "Oh, I I believe it." And then you're in depression. You know what I mean? You think you're a failure. [snorts] You think it's not going to get better. Pretty soon, you've got the wrong job. You married the wrong guy. You didn't want these kids anywhere. You know what I mean? You hate Texas. You you you hate you hate this place. And and you know, and well, I'm just going to go eat worms. Nobody loves me. Everybody hates me. &gt;&gt; You want to believe that? Is that how you want to look at it? But God gives you another way to look at it. &gt;&gt; Think it not strange. &gt;&gt; Of the trying of your faith. &gt;&gt; Why? Because faith is going to make me stronger. Faith is going to give me a victory. &gt;&gt; Satan, you've got nothing on me. You can't do anything to me. My name's written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lose my house. I'm not going to lose my job. I'm not going to lose my marriage. You're a liar. &gt;&gt; You're an accuser. You're trying to paint a picture for me to look at. You're trying to give me something to put my faith in. And if you lose faith in God's word, you are now in total darkness. If you lose this great faith, do you hear what he's saying? If we lose this great faith in God's word, not did you feel it? Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; If you lose this faith, it doesn't matter what you know about the word. He actually read it. You can read this Bible and be under the intellectual of man's intellectual inspiration. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make it right. &gt;&gt; But when your faith &gt;&gt; anchors in God's word, &gt;&gt; it changes the way you look at it. Faith is the way you look at it. You can go to the doctor. The doctor going to say you're not getting well. Maybe you want a child and the doctor says you can't have a child. You can walk out and believe him. All the evidence is there. Or you can look at another guy who wanted a child, was promised a child. He's 80 years old. No, I'm 76 and I don't want a baby running around in my house. You know, little James comes running up to me. You know what I mean? He wants me to pick him up. I bend over to pick him up. My goodness gracious and he gets on you and you, you [snorts] know, drooling on you and Well, that's you might that's great for you cuz but when you get old you'd like a little peace and quiet, you know, I'm going to tell on you, brother Adrien. So Adrien had 50 people over for Thanksgiving. So he dropped by to give me a crescent roll and some other things I'm not supposed to have. And he sat in my house. He went, "It's so peaceful." I says, "Adrigent, when you get my age, it has to be that way." But Abraham believed God. He didn't look at it that way. He didn't look at the deadness of him or Sarah's wound, did he? &gt;&gt; It was how he looked at it. &gt;&gt; It's how he chose to look at it. Choosing faith was how he chose to look at it. If he had the promise, he knew that God was able to perform the promise and he knew that God was able to put any changes that he needed in his life in order for the promise to come to pass. &gt;&gt; He looked at it totally different. He changed the way he looked at it. He looked at it through the eyes of faith. He didn't look at the impossibility. He didn't look at the negativity. [snorts] He didn't look at himself. The promise didn't come from him. He didn't make the promise. God made the promise. And he knew if God made the promise, then God was obligated to keep his word. &gt;&gt; It was by faith. And that's why the battle's always in your mind. The accuser is always in your mind. He never wants you to believe it's for you. &gt;&gt; He never wants you to get to look at it that this is my promise. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. I believe God made this promise. That's a promise. I believe God is able to keep his promises. Wrong way. That's not faith. That's religion. &gt;&gt; That's creed. That's dogma. That's Bible teaching. I believe Bible teaching. I believe everything the Bible says. But I'll tell you, when you say every promise in the book is mine, every chapter, every verse, every line, now you've changed the way you're looking at it. That's faith. &gt;&gt; And if you take that promise and mix that promise with faith, now it becomes profitable. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We've got a message that we all know is true, vindicated, &gt;&gt; but it's not becoming profitable &gt;&gt; because we're not mixing it &gt;&gt; with faith. &gt;&gt; We've accepted the fact that it's true. &gt;&gt; We've accepted the fact that brother Brandham was a prophet. That's true. [cough] He was a prophet. [clears throat] Many people believe brother, [laughter] excuse me, [cough] believe Brother was a prophet, but God took him home because of his doctrine. You want to look at it that way? Fine. The message doesn't do them one bit of good. &gt;&gt; That's right. But when you believe it's your message, &gt;&gt; then then you start hearing things and it start changing things. But if you mix it with faith, so there's a difference between believing something's true, believing that it's right, believing this is the right way, and then and and taking it and hearing what you hear and looking at it through the eyes of God's word and changing the way you see things. Faith is not the acknowledgment. Paul summed it up this way. Satan believes &gt;&gt; and fears and trembles. &gt;&gt; He knows it's true. &gt;&gt; But here, this is why the faith's important to us because without it, we're in total darkness. He says, "So if faith disagrees with science and science disagrees with faith, that puts them at edge at each other." In other words, at edge means they're in battle. They're trying to cut one another. Satan's trying to cut your faith. He's trying to keep you from mixing it, saying, "This is mine. This applies to me. Like I said about Abraham, you could listen to that doctor or you could walk out in faith and saying, "Lord, my family wants to have a child. I believe what your word says that my quiver will be filled. I I believe that that every promise in this book's mine. I believe that you can do the impossible. I believe that you're a creator and you can start changing the whole way you look at it, the whole way you're perceiving it. Now you're walking by faith. He said, "If I was in prison and I was to be executed in the morning, I'd have faith because faith could save me." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or you could sit in the prison and said, "I'm doomed. There's no way. Tomorrow morning I'm going to be electrocuted." And like most people, they begin to lie to themselves. I never did it. And and I'm innocent and they're guilty of sin. And they start lying to themselves. They start creating a false world that they're looking at things through. They look at the past and it's the source of all their troubles. Your past isn't the source of any of your troubles. Your past is not going to keep you from what God's predestinated you to be. [snorts] If your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life, you will be there. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you were treated. I don't care what you went through. I don't care about your mental battles. I don't care about your failures. If you want to look at that, look at that. It's not going to change where you're going to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're saying you believe in predestination? Yeah. I believe in predestination. &gt;&gt; I believe my name's written on the Lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; I believe I got a lot of terrible history, but it's not going to keep me &gt;&gt; from being where he predestinated me to be before the foundation of the world. Like I told a friend of mine, I said, "You know, really what I love about eternal life is when you get when you get into eternal life, heaven and earth passes away. [crying] So you go back to where you were before heaven and earth was here. &gt;&gt; So you never really done it in the first place. Amen. &gt;&gt; How you want to look at it? &gt;&gt; How do you want to walk through life? &gt;&gt; Do you want to walk through life without faith? Do you want to look at walk through life considering all the negative? You want to walk through life saying this world's true and what Satan's true and what Brent Baird says is true and what Jesse Waters says is true and what what's that other crazy woman on that other station says is true. What are you going to believe is true? Let every word of man be a lie &gt;&gt; and every word of God be true. It's when we start believing God's word. &gt;&gt; Now, you can argue with me about high heels and tight dresses. Alls I wanted you to do was go back and look at where they started and why they were made. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It ain't a law. [snorts] You want to wear them, I can't stop you, okay? But it's I'm obligated to tell you, you can't walk into the kingdom of God with them. So, make your choice. Choose by faith. I can't preach against games. I'm sure that playing a game every now and then is fine. I I knew a young man had a full scholarship to the best geological school there is for drilling and oil and those things. and he lost his scholarship because he got caught up in some war game two or three into the morning because he was almost there. You know, those games are designed to get you almost there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you go down a whole way of thinking and a whole way of pushing your thumbs. Just look at yourself. and you're there. You Oh, I got it. And it's programmed to get you to go this way and then drop a bomb. &gt;&gt; And then you're back again. And then you know where you're next? You're going to all the cheat sites that got all the the you know where you can get the answer. So now you're not playing the game anymore. You're cheating. just to so you can say yourself, "I did it." No, you didn't. You're a cheater. And you want the bottom line? You just wasted about 500 hours of your life looking at a stupid screen pressing buttons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't care how you want to look at it. If you want to look at yourself as being some sort of intellectual giant because you got trapped into playing some stupid video game, have at it. &gt;&gt; Go down to Hobby Lobby and buy yourself a crown and put it on your head. Say, "I'm king of video games." Does anybody know who won the 1957 World Series? Nobody remembers those guys. Big deal. You win the Super Bowl, Monday, it's over. They hang a little thing up there says Super Bowl champ. 1957. Big deal. What did he just tell us? Those things perish. Look to the invisible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just finish today. It says, "Now, if we lose faith, then we'll never get a prayer answered by God." [snorts] It's not the praying, it's the faith. Like I said, if you come to the altar and you could pray and pray, but if it's not mixed with faith, it doesn't do you any good. &gt;&gt; But if you come with faith, I'm going to go there and I'm going to pray and when I'm done praying, I'm leaving it there. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there &gt;&gt; by faith. Whatever convicted you to bring you to the altar, there is a promise of healing for that. &gt;&gt; It's what you're looking for. &gt;&gt; It's what you believe. &gt;&gt; Faith is what makes the altar call. come to life. &gt;&gt; It's not getting the people to the altar. &gt;&gt; I watched Billy Graham bring 40,000 people at one time to the altar. Prophet of God said he goes back and he can't find 30. &gt;&gt; Why? It wasn't mixed with faith. &gt;&gt; It wasn't mixed with the changing of how you look at the circumstance. If you come to the altar and your thinking is not changed when you get up, you're going to walk back with the same thing. at things. Boy, that's a whole definition of faith, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You mean I change the way I see things and things change? Yes. If you don't mix it with faith, you don't get a prayer answered. You can throw all your problems up all day long. But if you don't believe once you give him you commit it into his hands that he's going to take it, then what good is it do you? If you don't believe he heard you, if you don't believe he answered you, all you're doing is offloading for a little while. I'm just going to dump this thing off of me for a little while. You know, the baptism of the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you're not going to remember. And the baptism of the Holy Spirit does not mean that Satan's not going to tempt you and torment you. [snorts] So many people come wanting the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and really what they're wanting is Satan, leave me alone. If I had the Holy Ghost, I wouldn't be tempted. If I had the Holy Ghost, I wouldn't be tormented. If I had the Holy Ghost, no. Get the Holy Ghost. Satan fires it up. &gt;&gt; He'll make you prove every statement that comes out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the seal &gt;&gt; unto the day of your redemption. It means that you go through the trials. The trials are in your path. You don't bring them upon yourself. Did you like what he said? You just brought this upon yourself. So many people, oh, you brought it upon yourself. You were lazy at work. You got fired. That ain't the devil. &gt;&gt; The devil's not dumb enough to do a bunch of the stuff we accuse him of. We've brought it on ourselves. If you start looking at things through the eyes of faith, you'll make a judgment and determination of yourself. And when you're wrong, you'll cry, "Aba, Father, and you'll make things right." But when you get an illusion and you things are going to go away and the devil's going to go away and life's going to be rosy and and I need the Holy Ghost, I need the Holy Ghost. I need the Holy Ghost. You need faith. &gt;&gt; The foundation of a statue of a perfect man is faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Believe first. If you're convicted of sin, know father, you've convicted me of this sin because you're going to forgive me &gt;&gt; and you're going to give me the strength and the power to overcome because it's given to the overcomer. &gt;&gt; You don't need to admit guilt. He knows what you did before you ever confessed it. He doesn't want you to believe you're guilty. He wants you to believe he's your redeemer. &gt;&gt; He's your deliverer. &gt;&gt; He's your power. &gt;&gt; He wants you to believe that joy, he's got joy unspeakable and full of glory. He wants you to believe that you can have peace that surpasses understanding. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He wants us to start turning down all the negativity, all the lies, and start changing the way that we look at things and look at things through the glorious eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Maybe you had a rough past. Maybe you suffered. You know what you can do is you can raise your hand and say, "I suffered. But if I suffered with him, I'll reign with them also. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not the brightest block on the street. Maybe God didn't give you great intellectual understanding. Maybe sometimes you feel like a You want to look at yourself that way. How about looking at yourself and say, you know, God came to the poor in this world, rich in faith. Nowadays, we think only smart people are Christians, only the intellectual, only those that can that can perceive and understand doctrine and and know all these things. And oh, that's the church. That's the message. That's the anointing. No, it's not. He didn't come to restore doctrine. He came to restore faith. &gt;&gt; Simple faith. This promise is mine. &gt;&gt; In closing, he makes these things. If we lose faith, we'll never get a prayer answered by God. For he that cometh to God must first believe. When you come to the altar, you're coming to God, right? Right. First of all, you must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him. You're coming to the altar. You're diligently seeking after God. If you don't mix that with the faith of reward, you won't get anything. But if you come knowing he hears you, knowing he'll reward you, knowing he'll do for you what you're asking him to do. Get up from that place, raise your hands, and say, "Thank you, Lord God. You heard my prayer. Whatever I've asked of you is on the way &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to let any devil in hell take it away from me. &gt;&gt; Once you mix it with faith, it becomes profitable. But without faith, it doesn't do you one bit of good. So if we lose faith, our prayers are enulled. We get nowhere. Now that's stern, isn't it? But aren't you glad you know that? I believe that. So all that we can think of this morning is to hold on to faith. Then if we lose faith, all our hopes are gone. Faith's our only hope. You're sick, faith's your only hope. You're depressed, faith's your only hope. Faith is the door. Faith is deliverance. Faith is everything. You and faith is the simple change of looking at it. the way it's perceived in the world or the way it's perceived in God's word. And now you change the way you look at it. He says, "And if we lose faith, all our spiritual reality is gone." the spiritual reality that God does things in an unseen miraculous way. Now, maybe you're not interested in God. Maybe you don't care. Maybe this world is so big, so heavy, so depressing. so down. You hate school. You hate living at home. You hate the rules. You hate all those things. You all you want to do just let me go. Let me I want to go to the mall. I want to get in my car. I want to do what I want to do. You know what happens? You have no spiritual reality. The reality that we're leaving and the reality that this world is going to burn escapes us. I don't want to be stuck with a carnal reality. Do you? I want to have a spiritual reality. How do you have a spiritual reality? There's only one way to have a spiritual reality and that's to change the way you look at things. Maybe that's a bigger challenge this morning than I realize. But stop and think, how are you looking at things? we lose all our spirituality. For you cannot have faith in things that you see. For the things that you see are all perishable. And then I'll read this last thing and I'll close because there's so much more in here. He says, [clears throat] and I'll read this paragraph. It was about the sculpture. Remember he said they looked at the sculpture and from the outside it looked terrible. What is this thing? And they criticized it. But when he said, "You get down here. Get down here." And he got on his knees and then he looked up at the sculpture the way that it was made to be looked at. when he looked at it the way that it was meant to be looked at. Does the world look ugly? That's because it's the way you're looking at it. It's Satan's kingdom. It's meant to be ugly. You're not meant to fit into it. You're not meant to be here. That's why he's not going to leave you here. &gt;&gt; You're not meant to go through this life with a carnal mind. &gt;&gt; The carnal mind is emanate with God, but the spiritual mind is life. You're meant to live by faith. By believing every word of God is true. You're you're created to live by faith. My God can do all things. All things are possible. You're you're made to to to think not to have a negative thought. You're made to believe that when you read the scripture that what you're reading is what's true. You're made to change the whole way you've been taught through civilization, education, and culture to look at the world. You were made to have your mind transformed by the washing of the water of the word of God. and your peace is in your faith in God's word. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Mr. Spellel, this statue is right and the sculpture had the right thing in his mind. But where the trouble is is with you. Where the trouble is is with me. Can that just set in for a moment? It's not the trouble, whatever that trouble might be. It's you. It's how you're looking at the trouble. It's how you're looking at the trial. It's how you're looking at the circumstance. He says, he says, "The trouble is with you. It's the way you're looking at it. The trouble is with us, with me. The way I'm looking at it. Now, someone might not think this is a very deep sermon, but this is deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the separator. [snorts] It's like the the people that when the golden calf came, you know why they got a golden calf? Because they wanted to take that golden calf and go back into Egypt. But there were those that saw it different. And there is a separation. And God's wanting us to separate from the way that we're looking at things and start looking at things through faith, through the power of God, through the baptism of the Holy Spirit, knowing that every word of God can come to pass in our life. &gt;&gt; Get rid of the negative. He's already thrown your sins in the sea of God forgetfulness. He wants to be real to you. And that's what he does. Have you ever just been somewhere? I remember the first time I felt the presence of the Lord. Why? I I just sat there and and and quivered. I didn't even know what it was. He was making himself real. Listen how beautiful this is. It's the way you're looking at it. He to he took he and his wife by the hand and led them down to the altar at the foot of this said cross. And he said, "Now look up now." And when he looked up, his heart like to have failed him. What a difference it was. to stand off there and look at it that way and to get down and look at it the way that it was made to look at. It's one thing to stand off and look at the word of God, [snorts] but it's one thing to get down and to know how he wants the word of God to be looked at. How do you look at the word of God? It's a reality. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. It's the truth. The word of God is what will be. &gt;&gt; If you mix it with faith, it will be everything it said it would be. Now, listen how he closes. That's the way that God is. That's the way faith is. It's the way you look at it. Do you look at a historical Bible or do you look at the same God that made the promise is alive? What good does this Bible do us if it's not the same God? &gt;&gt; What good does this message do us if it's not the same God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If it's not the same spirit to bring every promise in this book to pass. &gt;&gt; What good does it do us if we don't feel this word of God is every bit alive today as it always was? that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He knows what we have need of even before we ask. That our footsteps are ordered by the Lord. What good does it do that we don't have the same faith? And and then you we always are wondering what faith is and then this very simple reality comes forth. We say faith is a revelation. You what does a revelation do? It changes the way that you look at it. &gt;&gt; And you change the way you look at it. The choosing by faith. You choose how you want to look at it. Punishment or test. failing or victory, sickness or healing, depression or deliverance. Think it not strange the enemy is going to come against us. But we are more than conquerors &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; who deliver us from all things. &gt;&gt; How do you want to look at it? Do you want a big negative view or do you want to take God's word and say, you know, there's a promise in there for that? It's by these great and exceedingly precious promises that we become partakers of divine nature. Moses chose faith He had a choice. He chose faith. [snorts] And that's what prophet of God said. My sermon today to the church in its condition is to choose faith. I hope I could just make that a reality and that you would just think about it. [clears throat] Every decision you make is made by faith. What you choose to believe, the word or the accusation, the truth or the situation. Daniel didn't look at the situation. Nebuchadnezzar threw the Shadrach, Mishak, Neb in a fiery furnace. And when he heated the furnace up and he opened the doors and the two guards that opened the gourds instantly perished. They made a choice how they were going to look at it. &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh king, live forever. Our God is able &gt;&gt; to save us &gt;&gt; faith. &gt;&gt; But if he doesn't, &gt;&gt; we will not bow to an idol. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay true to his word regardless of the test. &gt;&gt; You just heard our messenger say that. &gt;&gt; And they threw him into the fiery furnace. We want the miracle before the furnace, &gt;&gt; but faith will take you into the furnace &gt;&gt; and bring you back out. &gt;&gt; Daniel in the lion's den. Put him in there. It looked like he was lying food. Oh, king. Bless you. I didn't mean to to disrespect the king, but I bow to my God as I'm taught. I turn my heart to Jerusalem and I prayer the prayers of faith. And in the lion's den he went. But he didn't look at he looked at a God that was able &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to deliver him from the lions. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when they went there, oh Daniel, Daniel says, "Oh king, live forever. All is well." &gt;&gt; Why? He entered the lion's den with faith. &gt;&gt; He believed that God would deliver him &gt;&gt; from the lions. &gt;&gt; He didn't look at how long it's been. He didn't look at how many men the lions have eaten. He didn't look at the pile of bones. He didn't look at how dark the cave was. He refused to look at anything that wasn't the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what faith does. It changes the way you look at things. Now, if you could this morning just say, "I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; I've been purchased by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; My name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. All my sins and failures have been thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness. And today I'm going to do my best to put him first. Not to look back, to leave those things which are behind behind. Even this morning, leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling. If you could believe that's you, that he loves you, that he chose you, that he died for you, that he will not leave you nor forsake you, but he'll be with you, even in you till the end. &gt;&gt; That he'll deliver you out of every trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. out of every failure. And if you fail, you cry, "Aba, Father, &gt;&gt; and he's just and faithful to forgive you. We've got to change the way we look at things." Faith is the way you look at things. I hope that as simple as it might sound this morning, there's so much more in here that we could discuss this morning. But mix your prayers with faith. We have not because we ask not. And when we ask, we believe not. But if thou will believe, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Only believe. God bless you. Let's stand this morning. [snorts] How do you look at yourself this morning? Well, I I know the failures. I have a devil that has a notebook and [clears throat] he keeps track [snorts] every day of everything I say, everything I do, everything I do there. But you know, there's another song I sing. It says, "I am redeemed by the blood of the lamb." You know that song? I am redeemed by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed [singing] by the blood of the lamb. I am redeemed [singing and music] by the blood of the lamb. Saved and sanctified. I am all my sins are under the blood. I am redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. I've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. I've been redeemed [music and singing] by the blood of the lamb. Saved and sanctified. I am all my sins are unplugged. I've been redeemed. Oh. Oh. But you can talk about me. All that [music] you please. You can talk about [singing] me. All that you. You can talk about me. All that you [music] talk about you down on high. All my sins are on the blood. I've been redeemed. And that's not all. There's more [music] beside. And [singing] that's not all. [music] There's more beside. And that's not all. There's still beside. I've been to the river and I've been baptized. All my sins are [music] I will be sin washed away. I don't know that verse got so close. He saved me and he filled me with the Holy Ghost. for my sin is I've been redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, isn't that pretty good if you start looking at yourself that way? &gt;&gt; Brother McGary, I know you. I know that you're a real grumpy old man, but you want to know something? God doesn't look at you the way you look at yourself. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He don't. &gt;&gt; He looks at you through the shed blood. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, when did he do that?" Well, you were yet a sinner. &gt;&gt; He died for you. &gt;&gt; What a way to look at life. In other words, now through him, I know I can overcome anything. No lust, no hatred, no nothing that I can't overcome through the Lord Jesus. What if the Lord blessed you and filled you with the spirit and you didn't accept it as being the baptism of the Holy Spirit? You didn't look at it as being the baptism. [music] It wouldn't stay with you. But if you look at it that this is God fulfilling his promise [music] in my life. I have a promise. Every single one of you in here are promised through the blood of Jesus Christ that his spirit will dwell in you. &gt;&gt; It might be different for every [music] one of you, but it's his promise. &gt;&gt; So you believe the promise. I can't create the fulfillment of the [music] promise, but I can tell you if you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will receive the Holy Spirit.
