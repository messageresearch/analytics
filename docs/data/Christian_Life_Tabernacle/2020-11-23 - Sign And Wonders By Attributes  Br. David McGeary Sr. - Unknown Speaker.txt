Description:
Sign And Wonders By Attributes
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Evening Service: November 22nd,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

great verse no matter what comes my way your life is in your hands amen i i said i wasn't gonna scream but you know uh when i get to thinking about the real people that have to stay home then i i kind of softened up a little bit you know it always reminds me when someone met me for the first time they they said are you david mcgeary i said yeah david mcgary are you sure you're david mcgarry of course i didn't get a doubt there about that time i said yeah he says well i thought you were six foot six with the big old patch on your eye and everything i said no really i i might come on to be hard but i'm really a soft puppy so we like that so i do that but anyway let me just take our seats for a moment and everybody's staying we're gonna have brother banks come and give us a the testimony i i'm going to give it a title called the appearing angel and so you know so berbers come tell us those good things of god and then we'll we'll go i really i yes i thought you would enjoy it also amen god bless you lord all right yes sir praise the lord amen all right where do i begin uh i guess i'll just uh jump straight into it i've told a couple brothers already a few people have heard it and i guess i want to just share it with the whole crowd just let everybody know how how god has been a great guy in my life so uh this this started at the [Music] at the end of october right at the beginning of uh november you know when the church closed down and we had a few people seek here and i had a i had caught covet as well and so i was uh i was sick there for a couple days and i got pretty bad you know i started getting all the all the symptoms of it my chest was all uh was all pretty bad and uh and i had the fever and i lost my sense of taste i lost my uh my appetite i couldn't i couldn't eat as much so i was just you know taking my time away from work you know trying to stay away from as many people as i could uh but when i went and got that test for the first time and i told my sister she uh she called the whole family and they had this uh you know you know family they're the kind i mean they're the kind of people that you know you just love them but sometimes when they get bad news you know it's just it's never good so so i after she tells everybody about what i got and what we're going to do next they wanted me to live with my parents so i went to go i went to go live with my parents i went there the first night my parents were you know just like any other parent they want to take care of their k of their kid when they're sick so they're going to do everything that they can they give you all kind of medication and they become the expert of covid that that night you know they they know all the you know all the symptoms and everything that you need to take and and you know they just prescribed me some hydrotherapy they uh prescribed me uh they prescribed me other medicines that we used to take back in africa they call it penicillin or something like that and kimin i don't know if some of you know what that is but we used to take some of those medications and so they were like yeah you guys you guys used to take this when you were young so this is really going to help you now when when you're old and you got covered and stuff and so um they they they gave me medication i was i was pretty sick and so everything they were saying i was just like okay i'll take it they they came they gave me tea i was like i'll take it they gave me all kinds of there's like a list of like 17 different things that i had to take and i was like you know their parents and you know that what they say i just i'll just do it for the time being because i'm sick and you know i'm feeling pretty bad right now so i'll take everything that they give me but there was another thing that they said that really didn't stick well with me and it was that i don't know if some of you are here when i give my testimony about uh being a branimist and switching over to being a believer of the word and believing in jesus christ as being my savior i don't know if some of you were here but uh so immediately my parents saw that and uh you know my dad took that opportunity and said you know what you see it's because you switched from uh being uh you know believing in brandon was god and see now he's punishing you and and now you got covered you see and and you know i i didn't that didn't sit very well with me even though i took all the medication that's the only part that i just i didn't agree with him on that um i kept believing the way i believe because i know where i was and who saved me from where i was and so i believe in in my in my god and so uh uh so the first night uh i wasn't able to i wasn't able to say you know to anything and so uh this the i took everything that they provided for me and the next day i um they took me to a doctor doctor was looking at me and you know they're they're saying well you're you're pretty sick and you know you you got covered you got it pretty well and um so i uh you know i was like okay well that if that's the case then that's the case i don't know what you want me to do uh and the doctor prescribed me a bunch a bunch more you know other things that i needed to take uh and you know they told me to go to cvs and get this and as i was driving up to cvs i could just feel some kind of a con condemnation i would say uh some kind of like like you shouldn't really be you know you're doing all this taking all this medication and all this but you but you know there's a hillary like what what are you what are you doing you know i was feeling like i'm missing out on on true healing instead of you know i'm missing out on true healing and so i um so i i went to cvs i get to the store instead of walking in i just stood there for a while i just kept thinking and then i stopped i went to uh to a little park that i usually go to where i just read my bible and i pray i usually go there and just sit there and just pray and read my bible because i feel i'm closer to god when i'm just seeing the trees and the rivers moving and everything and so i just went there and prayed and just kept reading my bible and just verse after verse you know when god is speaking to you there's verses that are coming in and they're like exactly pointing to your situation right there and so i'm reading that and just telling me about uh he's the guy that heals all diseases he healed me since the foundation of the world and you know a bunch of other verses that are that are going along with healing so i saw that and i took the word and said well he said he's ill he's healed me you know i i don't i don't think i have to take all the all those other medications so i went home waited there in the afternoon i got really hungry so i decided to force myself even though i didn't have the appetite to eat i decided to force myself to go out and buy something to eat so i went to one of my favorite restaurants and you know they were somehow they happened to have closed at that time so i i drove over the wing stop and i get inside a wing stop and uh and there's a guy he's he's standing at the cashier and he's got no mask on and everybody in the restaurant's got a mask on i was like well this is this has got to be pretty good you know 2020 everybody's forced to have a mask this guy's just standing here about 21 years old you know and blonde guy with like a sweater on and and some jeans just you know ordering his food i looked at that i'm like okay well i mean i don't i don't have anything against that um i got my mask on and i'm fine i mean if they're telling him to get out i guess he's got to get out there's nothing i can do about that so i i stand in the line nobody's telling him anything i don't even know if they're noticing how he doesn't have a mask on so he orders his food he comes back and he's walking towards the window and just you know talking i don't know what he's doing and then uh he walks pretty close and i know that i have covert and i have a mask on so i so i turn to him and say aren't you scared of colvin he said he's not a greater z greater is he this in me than he is in the world and so i i was like wow that's that's crazy i mean this guy i don't know who he is i've never seen him at any of our churches or congregation i don't know where he is but he just says that and so he walks back and he's just packing all his food and stuff and i'm just keeping an eye on him now i'm like there's something going on with him so uh you know there's people on the line and they go up and they're ordering and he's got all his food and he's ready to walk out and i'm so close to the door so he uh he walks over and right before he exits he uh he stops and he's he's now he now is watching me and he says uh so uh do you believe in jesus i said yes okay and then he immediately is boldly not asking if i want to get prayed for nothing he just lays his hand on my shoulder and he says a prayer repeats a couple of verses it says uh these signs shall follow them that believe they'll go into all the world and lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover and he just walked out and there was people there and i was i was completely just shocked i was i was completely shocked i was like nobody's doing nobody's doing that i mean not that i've seen uh not in this time that i'm living in i mean you can get sued all kinds of ways and stuff so for you you don't even know who i am you just walked up and you prayed and and you just walked out and so uh you know i i took that and i i believed right away as soon as you did that i was like the kind of boldness that would make a man say that and just pray for you i mean i knew i was healed until i mean all that time i knew i was healed and all that i had was hope that i was healed but as soon as he said that prayer and he walked out i had a hundred percent faith i was healed i went back home and they were looking at me and they're like banks all right are you gonna take your medication i said no i'm i'm healed when did you get healed you just came here about two days ago who healed you like you just you just stopped taking all your medication and you're crazy i say well i don't know how to explain this to you but i'm healed i'm already healed he he healed me i don't know how to put it in words i mean i all in that time when i was when i was telling them i was healed i was my chest was too congested when they were asking me are you here i said yes i'm healed but my chest was too congested and i still had fever and stuff but after two days excuse me after two days i um i got my my sense of taste back i got my uh i got the fevers gone i got my appetite back and and you know all the symptoms were just fading off and fading away my chest was open back up and i didn't have to take any kind of medication my parents were just really upset about the fact that i wasn't taking any medication and and i know that you know any any parent will be concerned about their child not taking medication especially when they're sick but i i knew what i just went through i knew what i just experienced and so even though i couldn't explain it it was true it was a hundred percent true and so i was healed and after i waited uh i waited a while and and all the symptoms were gone i knew that you know god had healed me and you know even though they were saying well you know you you switched from brandon and now you're well i'm here my god is real my god heals and i don't have to take any of your your medications and everything else that you got laid up i don't have to take anything i'm healed you know and it was it was pretty it was pretty hard for somebody to say that especially seeing how covet actually is taking people out it is it is killing people and it's pretty tough even on uh especially they're showing especially on like african americans uh blacks so it's pretty tough to stand there and say i'm not gonna take anything because i know that i am healed it's pretty it was it was the only thing that i could rely on uh through that time i couldn't come to the church because they had forced the brother to close down the church i couldn't come here to get prayed for how i thought i wanted to get prayed for you know my i have somebody lay their hands on me so but god made a way and he did that [Applause] you know everybody panics when they hear a testimony but may i just say this a pardon is not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon you know what i mean and i want to say this on behalf of banks's father i i've meant them and anytime you meet anybody in their family they got the most wonderful spirits but you know they saw the deity that was dwelling in brother branham and they recognized that deity and they are closer to the truth they're not as far away from the truth as a lot of people who are in the message it was the i want to say it's a problem but it it it just takes the lord to give you the revelation of that was deity in flesh none other than the same jesus christ that walked here on earth 2000 years ago no difference in the ministries except for the physical body and divide that deity from the flesh now jesus you couldn't divide the deity come from the flesh because the word was made flesh but in us we haven't got that theory body yet we bypass that so it's still the deity but it's not the flesh hasn't fulfilled that part of it yet and so that's that's why uh you know so when they say brother branham's god well it's such a razor edge revelation so i i pray for them and that the balance of the revelation and the understanding of the deity and the separation of that but you're closer if you recognize the deity than you are if you don't and so i just say that on on his behalf because i certainly would uh love to um you know i i there's so much truth in the stand that they've taken and the things that they see that you don't want to speak against the truth but you trust that the word will correct correct the air so let's stand and let's read one scripture found in our bibles it's the first scripture in the bible and let's just read that this evening and have a time of fellowship together and around the things of the word and trust that the lord will be our our portion this evening amen it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth amen our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated and then we also like to i i always like to read in the gospel of saint john and the first few verses there it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god you say what's the difference between john and genesis the first scripture of genesis was before creation and then the first scripture in john was the beginning of creation so in the beginning there was just god but creation started with the word of god and so it's the same thing and the same person picked up in two different places and this evening we i just want to fellowship with you and and as we begin to understand and we talked this morning that we understand that there's something going on and i think that we've tried to emphasize that this morning and and i think people and believers are beginning to recognize that the enemy has his hand in something and he's trying to force the church or force the believer or create some sort of fear or some sort of doubt or he he's got some intention behind the things that happened that nothing's happened by chance and we've realized that as we talked this morning that in every age every believer was tested we talked about peter and how he was tested we talked about paul how he was tested shadrach meshach and abednego daniel all down through time we can take if it would be a really good time uh for each of us to get the fox book of mortars martyrs and any mortars which you put rocks together with but martyrs apocalypse and martyrs and read about the when the great horse went out and decided to kill and the church in power joined their state joined together in power and we see the church and state starting to join together now the pope coming out and saying you know same gender marriages are okay if they're done in the court and pretty soon they're they're they are being now welcomed into the assemblies of the catholic church and and and they're willing to start giving him limited roles and participation and no longer speaking against the act or the spirit as any form of perversion but presenting it as a natural creation of god now remember the scripture says not wishing to retain god into their knowledge they're giving over to a reprobate mind their conscience being seared with a hot iron and so that's what the america has done that's what the world's done they no longer wish to thank god in their knowledge and and they they rely and have accepted the system of of education and science so they feel they're going to find their answers in science and that's what i thought bank's testimony i you know that god provided an angel you know i personally believe that guy never ate those wings i believe he's probably nowhere to be found you know even the description of them is kind of the description that the lord gives but that's true okay you know i thought the other day when we went to the gymnasium for the young people didn't you just love that scripture on their serves we would see jesus and there they are making their cry out and yet he was here in our generation to be seen and and they they chose not to listen if they would have stopped and listened and heard what he said and what he was preaching they would have clung to him but just the fact that god chose to come in the ministry of a prophet was to blind them you know what i mean if he would have came in a great intellectual scholarship without the signs and wonders and made some sort of presentation they would accepted the idea of it as long as they could form it and present it and practice it in their own way but you have to understand that we're not given the option to practice the word of god in our own way our our goal if i could use that is to practice the word of god just the way that he spoke it and and so we we see that that so there's something and we we read the quote several times to you about the natural types the spiritual and so what's happening natural there's a spiritual parallel to it and so we know that if there's something that is being achieved another there's something that satan is trying to achieve you understand with how that he's handling this plague what that he wants the plague to do how the governments which he is the prophet said the world got exactly what they needed for a leader it's satan you go into the message of the world falling apart and the prophet god begins to talk about the world is looking for a savior they're looking for someone a great somebody a great something to arise and to bring them a salvation to bring to them uh something that will unify them and do something for them and we see the stage of that getting set now as it just seems like the world leaders now are coming together to see what they can do as the world and they begin to form these bonds they begin to create this power they begin to uh take possession of how that they want to do things and so now they they start out feeling that this is what's best for you okay so now they've taken your destiny into their hands and after their motive uh in their thinking is the right thing to do but then they begin to extend that authority into and extend that uh uh governing power and so now they feel what's best for you pretty soon what it'll be what's best for you to drive what's best for you to eat uh what's best for you you know i i remember when they started coming up with these little dinky cans of pop i thought what's this all about you know and people buy because they decided it would be better for you if you only drank 6 ounces instead of 16 ounces well for those of us who can't live on sixth ounces they've got triple the sales you know that i want you to see their thinking that get into the thinking you say well brother mccarrick give me a scripture the scripture tells you that that thinking will go so far that they will persecute you and kill you thinking that they're doing god a service so the best thing for us for our health the best thing for us for our society the best thing for us is to get rid of these disruptors who speak against science who who tells crazy stories about angels coming in and laying their hands on them and saying he who is in you is greater than he was in the world and praying for you and you getting better see that's something they can't sell without faith and we remember we read the quote in in god of this evil age they say they pit soul relied in their science and education that they don't need faith they don't need faith to operate look if you have no faith there's no way you can please god because you can't please god without faith you can't serve god without believing his word you can't praise god without praising him in his word you can't please god without having faith in his word so once you separate the word of god you've cut the only connection that man has with god the only connection that man has with god is his word and his word is his promise the only connection you have with god is that he said i'll not leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you in in you till the end that is the promises he made to you and your faith in those promises it's by these exceedingly great and precious promises that we are partakers of divine nature so that's our connection our only connection is the word of god if we didn't have god's word we didn't have the promises of his presence we didn't have him manifesting his keeping his word there would only be one place left for us to turn in that science and education and knowledge which is of the devil so that's why that work is so important so we understand that god if satan is something that he's trying to achieve and he's trying to get the world in a condition and in a mind where they feel that they need this super savior and i i didn't have the opportunity to find a statement but i believe that brother branham said satan would give them one okay but i don't want to lose the connection with god's word that's what we talked about this morning let's don't lose that connection with god's word let's understand that god is trying to achieve something that's what he wants to achieve and that's what we want to talk about tomorrow what is it that's god's trying to achieve and why has this test come up upon us and we're told don't be don't think it's strange get the fiery darts of the enemy the trying of your faith because it's more precious than gold and the very scripture for our age is i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire and when we had that scripture expounded on by the messenger of the hour he said that gold tried and fire is what christ like character because our escape is if the same spirit that dwelt in christ jesus dwelleth in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies so we see the the the the great uh thing of that so many people have placed that receiving that and and coming that into a pentecostal experience and we understood that it's not based on a pentecostal experience that we even looked at it and the and the what was going to be restored the faith of our fathers it goes back before pentecost and i i hope you that this morning i made that simple enough for the spirit the word did that those people believed in jesus if they didn't have the faith in what he said they would have never went back to that room do you understand that the the pentecost and what we call pentecost it was called pentecost because it was on the feast of pentecost which was a jewish feast that followed so many days i think it's 50 days if i'm not mistaken after the passover there was a feast that they celebrated so they came together on that feast and at that feast the spirit of god came down and gave them power and an anointed them with power to go out and start preaching the gospel with signs and wonders so that gospel would be believed eck and as that gospel went out it struck believers that were predestinated to hear it they had something in them then we know that seed went into the ground and that seed came back up and took the journey and it became in justification it came forth in sanctification and then finally it came up in the restoration of gift and pentecost and then the shock which was the restoration of gifts and that experience it pushed the word out of it so there was a separation because the seed was not air with the shock so as the life came up it was in manifestation we understand that but when it got to this age it was seed form and so really what i want to fellowship with us tonight as we're just trying to grow and and put ourselves personally in to what is the achievement that god's trying to achieve for his church and for the individual so what is he uh looking for or what let's when i say looking for he can only look for his word he can only look for what he prophesied and predestinated so what is he looking that he thought and what is he looking that he predestinated so what is he looking to come to pass in this day and i think that's one of the most beautiful parts of the message of this hour is the prophecy that god spoke of what this bride church would be and so and so we we see so we read this a few statements uh uh and and this is out of thinking man's filter he said what is it so uh he said what is it it kind of in paragraph 127 what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that was in god at the beginning standing here drawing the seed life the seed is in your heart by for ordination hallelujah the seed is already in there by the foreknowledge of god predestinated and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word amen so we know there's something in there that's drawing is that right so if there's something that's been planted there it's been planted for a purpose and therefore if it's a seed then that means it's in the form of what that god is going to transform it into so god put an apple but because that was predestinated to be an apple he knew that every fruit that was on that tree was in that seed so it was an apple therefore we call it a apple seed so this is a bride seed but it's only in in seed form therefore if it was spoken by the word and created by the word the the creator and the speaker of it knew what he had in his mind because a word is a thought expressed so he expressed the finished work in the seed so the finished work was in the seed but god had the power to transform the the seed into the finished work and he chose to do that by redemption by fulfilling the old testament through redemption and then by paying the price of calvary and then putting that seed into the ground and then letting it begin to manifest itself so there's nothing that can draw that life through to that seed but the word so he created that seed to be manifested and produce its fruit through a certain process in a natural seed it had to be in the right environment it had to be there it had to receive water there's all those things and that natural types the spiritual seed in other words that spiritual sheet is not going to draw any life that's not in the word amen hallelujah thank god for the word thank god for the opening of the seals that gave us the word of god that the last thing that was necessary for this seed to receive and draw that life okay and so so if we say now god in the this is a back again and countdown um paragraph 37 he says but god in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backwards so this is brother brandon trying to tell the church world he was telling him more than i see but he's saying we're not going backwards we're not trying to go back to pentecost and experience those gifts so what i i want to just spend a few moments this evening if you will allow me and if i was to tell to put a title on my sermon i i would call it gifts by attribute gifts by attribute restoration by attribute signs and wonders by attribute okay so we we see he says that if spiritual me is going forward and not going back he is going forward looking into the word so in order to look into the word you have to look into what did god have in his mind when he planted that seed what was the finished work of that seed and how was he going to transform that seed into the product that he planted and so we can look and we saw that justification didn't match up to the original seed nothing matched up to that masterpiece seed so he said he's going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that never has come yet for the spiritual revelation to manifest the spiritual things that god has promised oh my what a vision what what a thirst okay i i i i god's there's something he wants to achieve he wants us to move into something that hasn't been yet another it wasn't its time it wasn't its season the seed is coming up but that apple tree is not coming up just to be the sprout it's not looking just to be the seed it's not looking just to be the flower or the bud what it's looking for is the fruit that was in it when it was created that's what it's looking for it hasn't seen that yet but it's looking for the revelation where's the revelation that's what it's looking for it's looking for the spiritual revelation to manifest the spiritual things that god has promised so we began to look what did he promise what was his achievement what was he what was he moving towards and if we can see that the revelation of that then we can move forward because we know what we're believing for we know what we're looking to be manifested we now can have faith because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god you can't have faith in trying to reproduce something that somebody else had what's that called counterfeit amen it's like us building an ark to get out of here so we know there's something because so we we begin to take the word of god and we begin to see what what is it that god's trying to achieve how can he how can he try how can he achieve these things and then so we just take a moment and look in the message who is this melchizedek so we see in this who this malchesta deck was and we go back to the beginning and let's say paragraph 44 of who's this melchizedek he said god came down and became flesh and died the death in christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for fellowship god loves fellowship that's what he made the man in the in at the first time was for fellowship god dwelt alone with his serpents he says now notice he made man and man fell he came down and redeemed man because god loves to be worshiped the very word god means worship oh i mean let's just stop and look at that for a second he said god made man because he wanted fellowship right he walked with adam in the cool of the evening adam was his son everything was found and then man fell so he came and redeemed man because god loves to be worshiped he he he redeemed man so man can worship him i'm redeemed thank you lord what does redeem me it means to be brought back so god paid the price at calvary a man began to worship him because his sins were forgiven but he didn't finish his work at calvary he redeemed the seed in other words if i could say this he made the seed worthy to be planted now that seed's planted it's back to its original purpose why he spoke it in the beginning now he's on his way back to fellowship now he's on his way back to perfection now he's on his way back to where he came from so he allowed us to redeem so we could worship him we could fellowship with him and so he says now god in the beginning dwell alone as i spoke this morning in his thoughts there was nothing just god alone and his thoughts and just like a great architect can set down in his mind and draw out what he thinks he's going to build create now he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it in a different form because god is the only because god is the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thought that's his desire and now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word and a word is a thought when it's expressed is a word god thoughts expressed is the word but first it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought then the word notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel star seraphim or anything else that's eternal if you have eternal life you always was now you're beginning here but shape but the shape and the form and he says he was infinite so we know that we we we can go down that road a long time but what we just wanted to say is we know that we were in his thinking in the beginning so what was in his thinking is what that seed is going to produce now we understand this and as we just go this because we're trying to get to a little point and give some good background to it we know that god allowed adam to fall so in the beginning adam had fellowship with god and adam was created by god and we're gonna just read in the masterpiece in here in a moment but was adam was walking with god adam knew that there was a part of him that adam never knew he didn't know that that god was a healer because there was no sickness there he didn't know god there was a deliverance because he was not captive to anything if you've got a habit and and i know smoking is one of the hardest habits to break uh some people have drug addictions pain pill addictions uh they have they have anxiety medicines addicted and you're addicted when you come to the place that you don't feel you can live without it or you've got to have it you can and and then you're addicted when this thing changes the environment in which you think and and when you're not under the abuse of the substance or you're not under the influence of a substance you feel different now you've created an addiction an addiction is a bondage and man there was none of that there so he didn't know god was a deliverer and and brother man makes the statement he says god was a healer and he wanted to manifest these attributes he said now don't be children now so understand that so we sit back and say well that's not fair for god to uh to let me fall and let me sin and let me become addicted so so he can manifest his attributes oh he's more just than that he put your name on a lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world eternally secures you in him you were in his thinking in the beginning and so he knew that what that he put in you and where it would end up because he's the beginning and the end he's your alpha and he's your omega is that right and nothing ever nothing will ever change that and and so we we realized that that that's that gene seed so he goes out and so adam begins to find out that adam's alone well god was alone right so now god creates adam adam is is an image and likeness adam is the beginning of the creation of god adam's the thus a son of god and adam's alone so adam god takes from adam a part of adam and we could go spiritually in the separation of the two attributes that were in adam male and female he separates the female part out now adam's got somebody says bone in my bone flesh of my flesh and the lord tells them don't eat of this but adam doesn't know that god's a deliverer he doesn't know he's a savior he doesn't know all this sight of god so god allows eve because she's a byproduct adam would have never never never went there but eve was approached she wasn't the original creation she was part of the original creation so when satan brought reasoning to her and he showed her in a perversion all the plan that god had and and as we read it eve had the let me see if i can find that if i even brought it out here this evening uh i guess i i must have left it in my room but we read it four or five times so he said that eve had the word of god in her hand and instead of seeking the baptism of the holy spirit he was typing the church there he said she he she let satan talk him out of it and say that that was the days of the apostles well don't you think that when that when satan was tempting eve that he came to jesus with the same temptation that he gave eve showed her all the kingdoms of the world showed her what a great thing would come to pass what great science and education because remember brother brahm said that eve gave the whole world over to the science and educational system of satan believing it was the church so he he lays this whole program out there and lets her know the way that it can be achieved and that's what he said you participate in this with me you'll now enter my kingdom you'll take on forms you'll you'll grow you'll multiply and you'll be able to build this he didn't even know adam that whole type of relationship was totally hid she wasn't in those realms because he had kept him out of those realms and one day we're going to return back and find out totally what he had in mind look there she is so he says okay and he explains this to her and lays it out to her the scripture says he seduced her he beguiled her he lied to her and and told her something that she thought was god she believed satan's lie as god's truth now here's where i want to start my thought this evening she comes back to adam she talks about the serpent she talks about that adam partakes of it and he finds out that it's not the truth i wasn't there i don't know all that went on but this i know is that adam could have put eve out but adam was a son of god amen god adam was created by god in order to be created of god and god be his father adam had to have in him the attributes of god so adam the first adam was a living soul the second adam was a quickening spirit both of them were adam or if i could say this one both of them were the sons of god one was a living soul one was a quickening spirit but they were the sons of god because they possessed the attributes of god they were the gene of god god's gene another gene is the substance the makeup the transferable part from the father or the mother to the child that gives them their characteristic that gives them their features and everything my family has a gene nose and as you notice that the children that gene mixes with the mother gene and then the features begin to change you see you say oh that looks you got these features of your grandfather this looks like this but yet now they picked up the features the genes of the mother that can the features start to go forward and the transformation takes place but adam only had one place to get his gene that was god so adam had the genes of god in him so when heckle and eve when he could have put eve away he could have then adam didn't know that adam had and possessed within him the gene the attribute of forgiveness he didn't okay he had the attribute of deliverance all of a sudden he couldn't turn the eve out he he wanted to care for her he was a part of him he wasn't gonna let her go he wasn't just gonna turn her out and have her be destroyed he was gonna go out and protect her he was gonna go out and provide for her he was gonna go out and redeem her his whole purpose was to get her back why because he was of the father he had the attributes the attributes were in them they were the gene of god have you ever heard the prophet say that you are the gene of god your gene was in your father sometimes they refer to it as a jain that it was in your father you were in your father you were there so where was this seed the seed was in the father it was in the thinking of god's in the thinking of god so when he created this seed the only thing he had put into that seed was what that he was the genes of god so let's look just here at a moment and let's go to the message the masterpiece paragraph 101 and let's just have some wonderful if we could just turn over to the other page i'd like to read this quote on page 96. it says paragraph 96 the same book the masterpiece just a word quick insert of comfort remember he was the son of prosperity everything that he did prospered whether it was prison or whatever it was he'd come out right amen he said he and he hasn't he promised for his children that i believe he was talking about joseph and those things there he said hasn't he promised for his children that he'd make everything work together for the good whether it was sickness prison house death sorrow whatever it was that it would work for the good to them that love him he promised it it must be so it's got to be there it's figurative spoken to us in him he was that perfect image of god now we see here also that when he comes again and and he's going on and you can go pick that up so he's talking that that he was this perfect image of god in order for jesus to be the perfect image of god he'd have to possess what god was all that god was he poured into him so all the attributes that god had he poured into him so what i'm talking about is is gifts by attribute because everybody is talking and i got a lot of these questions when will the church be endued with that pentecostal power when's that pentecostal power going to come back that the gifts will be working in the church that the nine gifts spiritual gifts will be working that that will have anointing and people will stand up and prophesy what i'm trying to say is is that is going to return but it's not going to return in the form of a gift it's going to turn back in the form of an attribute that's exactly right amen so it's not going to be i've got this it's going to be i am this i don't have the gift of healing i have the attribute of healing it's the gene that is in me the characteristic of my father manifested in me not by gift but by inheritance he knew it was in the seed you don't think he stood there and said the works that i do you shall do also now it's simple to preach the holy spirit comes down most people in the view of a third person or anointing comes down it causes me to do this but this tree this bright tree is going to a maturity where it's beyond a gift it's now a possession they possess the matured fruit possesses the same seed that goes into the ground and can reproduce the tree so what's he trying to achieve and why is this coming on us we possess victory we possess resurrection possessors of the resurrection so let's go back to paragraph 100 the next page over now we could go on and on with that but i believe you have the picture of what i mean now god building back his masterpiece so he's building it back right and so we know the story and why christ speak it comes into such a perfect image he says he takes the hammer and says speak and then in brother branham's message he says god finally got tired of me and said don't cry unto me didn't i make you a prophet do you not possess the gene do you not possess the attribute in other words take what you are take what i made you take what i said and manifest it get the revelation where you can manifest the things you haven't seen yet it's time we just keep believing believing for and we begin to find out how do we get them they asked brother branham should we seek the gifts he said no seek him am i screaming my mother always tells me you'd be a good preacher if you didn't scream i i wanted to say mama you've heard listen to those priests too long but i believe my mama's going to be there now he says but now let's not forget that in the beginning when he smote the sight of adam he took something from his side is that's up there right he's met christ for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride that he might take him a bride so when his masterpiece was perfected then when he had to smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation in other words not another attribute not another personality not something new but a piece of the same creation so what eve was when adam looked at it he said flesh of my flesh bone of my bone a part of me i'll color a woman a from the man a part of me this is me so when he smoked christ he smoked christ for a reason my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word living god in the word what was the original word the original word was what made flesh what was it before it was word attributes it was gene the makeup what he was what he possessed how he thought how he did things that's why the prophet god said if god ever does one thing one way he's always got to continually do it the same way why because it came from him as a part of him it was what he was made out of so when god made adam in his own image what that image was it wasn't that god had flesh the image was the attributes the characteristics the gene that was the image that adam was made in he possessed the same attributes that he did his father did i could have got those quotes how many have heard him you were in your father you have your gene of your father you have the attribute of his father so here we see it because oh cadaver one not a new creation that's what adam was he was the image of god he was the possessor of the attributes of god that's why in that garden he could say name the trees tell the animals he did everything he had what the father had so he makes the second adam let's just read let's just go over to paragraph 106. he said his life matched all the peoples it pleased god to smite him and now why did he smite him for the same cause that he had to smite adam to get a bride to get a family to get a part of himself that he could have fellowship that he could be worshipped he didn't take a different creation he took the attributes that were in adam and he put him in eve he says now we see him stricken smitten of god and afflicted the perfect lamb for sinners sinner slains a perfect masterpiece now for nearly 2 000 years god has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a masterpiece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that have been struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled so what happened in the beginning the old testament became flesh didn't it every promise everything that god said i'll put enmity between thy seed and your seeds i'll send a redeemer all the promises concerning him they were all there in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh the attributes of god were made flesh now this bride comes forth and and the purpose of spiting this bride is so that she now if the if the old testament was made flesh he says the old testament's foreshadowed the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that the old testament now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making so if the first masterpiece was a possessor of the attributes he did things by the attributes that was in him you understand it was the nature that was in him it was the gene that was in him he inherited the way he does things you know i i i i excuse me uh zoey's going to get mad at me but i know she look but when i see zoe i i just crack up i see a little laura you know what i'm here you know the older you get you start seeing people and younger people i remember the first time i went back to michigan with my mom we're on the train and she going oh that's such and such i'd say mom they're only 25. you know you're 50. it's been 25 years old since you've seen them but she saw those people in those young people that come to find out some of them were relatives and the daughters and the things of her friends you see if god ever does things so if he's passing down the gene that you are into your children and he and that's the way he does things he's not going to change the program so in the beginning adam he was made in the image of the gene and attributes of god so he possessed them by attribute and by gene not by gift they possess them by gift because they're not part of the original but you don't possess the power to heal by gift you don't possess the power to deliver by gift you don't possess the hour the power to impart eternal life that day on calvary that's what he said you can impart eternal life you don't do that by gift so people are looking for the restoration of gifts god's looking for the maturity of attributes he's looking for the bride to become one with the word and possess those things by nature by gene by attribute and not by seeking a gift but by receiving the spiritual revelation to manifest what god promised and what did he promise the restoration of the bride now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament if the old testament was made flesh then the new testament has to be made flesh so it's made flesh there's nothing that's in the new testament that's outside of that flesh so healing's in the word and the word is made flesh no wonder he'd look out at us and say you're the word of god you're the attributes of god you're the gene of god what was he doing he was prophesying he was telling us what we were maturing to he was telling us really what was the shock going to spill out the shock received the life by gifts but the seed didn't receive the life by gift the seed received the life because it was spoken in the beginning in them they had seed life from the beginning they were the possessors of the fruit not having the gifts of it i can give you a gift of an apple but the only way you can become an apple is if you have an apple seed not have a seed or a seed those gifts were in the seed so this was in a church so when the shock finally got up there they had no inheritance with the seed because the shack was not air to what the seed was going to get the shack was an heir to the gifts the shack was an heir to the possession of the attributes the shuck was in heir to possession of the gene only the seed was so they went back to pentecost they went back for the anointing they went back for the oil they went back to find what they could do to reproduce this and they came up with every denominational scheme every kind of program every kind of hokey oil and and stuff that they could come up with every kind of anointing raising every kind of man up but let me tell you something we saw the fruit in our generation not a man a man that possessed it made flesh the new testament made flesh so we're not looking for gifts to produce power we're not looking for gifts to heal we're looking for the attribute to be matured in us that we have such love that that we know that he is in you and with you tell the end that you possess the statue of a perfect man you mature into it you know what it is that god's trying to fulfill in you you know what it is he's trying to bring out in you he's not trying to get you to get something from the outside god remember this other spirit works from the outside to change the inside brother brown talks about the control tower okay but god works from the inside out until he can get what's on the inside the seed manifested on the outside and finally she starts burying the fruits she farts bearing the characteristics she starts bearing to the attributes she's one and she stands up and says i'm the tree that's planted i have the fruits the tree of life is in her and they're one there they are the word and we've got to end this idea of seeking an anointing to produce something when what's going to be produced is the very life that he predestinated in you and created in you and that life is making its journey in your person in your mind in your heart drawing you that seed life drawing you to where that he spoke of you and that he created you that those attributes can be made he says as it's taken him 4 000 years to make his masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2 000 years making another masterpiece a bride for christ another masterpiece in doing it he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpiece because he can only be a perfect masterpiece when it's perfect word he does it the same way how'd he do it in the beginning he took his attributes and made flesh how did he let adam adam know that he had those attributes because when eve went out all of a sudden adam found out he had things in him that he didn't even know there and where do you think he knew he got him have you ever realized the patience that you've got came from somewhere the love you've got's come from where the way you feel about somebody that's lost that came from somewhere oh if i could just express it we're moving to higher ground the prophet of god said if a messenger comes and preaches the same old message it's not a message from god if he came and preached the same old restoration of gifts the same old church the same old spirit moving in the congregation the people coming and getting whooped up no it's you out there with a vision and a revelation of what he was like that little eagle it looked up there and saw that's what i want to be and then that eagle cried out and says you are me you are a part of me you have in you what i have in me you have in you what it takes to fly because you came from me and because you came for me you got the attributes of an eagle you got the eyes of the eagle you got the wings of the eagle you've got a veke to eat fresh manna what do i do mama stay in the barnyard and talk about it flap the wings exercise the attribute isn't it about time we say he who is in me is greater here comes this angel that comes says remember son he was in me is greater than he was in the world goes back and preaches the great commission and disappears when are we going to flap the world's got a flapper don't you think it's about time we god's got something that's slapping their wings that in the face of the adversity brings the word of god i love it brother i'm sitting there at that state fair and he's just listening you know he's out with his kids and his kids probably think you know daddy's always having visions he's always talking to people you know you know he just wants to be a normal dad and this guy starts carrying on starts mocking job and everything birdman says i just couldn't take it no more amen wait a minute friend that was a special prepared fish wouldn't you like to sat there and got that sermon that that guy got i'm waiting for the rest of the story that's right i like to think that guy come to christ somewhere down the lower road i like that guy at the train station that little girl comes back home from college she's sitting on that train and she's with her snickerty friends and everything and they're laughing and they finally get to her stop and one of the girls that was one of her best friends sitting there says who's that ugly hag over there all crippled over and bent up and skinned ooh isn't she hideous is that girl's mother so she got off the train and wanted to pretend like she didn't know her until maybe her friends took off that old boy i always i'm just telling you how i think i always felt that conductor was that boy that got healed in memphis remember that guy because remember brother brown said that he found him at a train station someplace and said brother ben is not saved you know i always felt it was him someone that had an experience with god somebody was into and all of a sudden he got up in front of everybody and looked at her and said sister you ought to be ashamed of yourself she says let me tell you something your mother was beautiful there was nobody that could hold a candle to her beauty he said but one day the house caught on fire and you were in it and she went and became ugly and burned out so you could be beautiful you ought to be ashamed of yourself christ didn't go to calvary so we could be a bunch of weak intellectual feeling bound people he went to calvary so the chip off of him would manifest and possess the gifts by attribute where he wouldn't have to keep giving it to us and giving it to us finally one day we would accept the fact that all that he was he poured into me and i have christ i have healing i have deliverance i am a possessor [Applause] of the gifts by attribute by gene by inheritance they're mine but all satan has to do is point to your little body and you fall to pieces did you hear brother branham said that god is not going to judge you by your body in other words he's not going to judge you by the sins that have gone on in your flesh he's going to judge you by your inner spirit man he's going to look to see if that seed long to be what it was created to be and all satan has to detour you is to offer you his kingdom you know you don't need to manifest that gift you know you really don't have to have that gift there or have that attribute of healing because believe it or not i got doctors nothing against doctors we had one here this morning but i've got i've got i've got substitutes for that and god says okay i i i gave them the knowledge of medicine i use doctors but when they run out you don't run out you don't believe god does miracles natalie was this big did you know you were that big natalie you were a kleenex box when i went soar in the hospital i thought my i didn't know they came that little but what do we got today a miracle nobody sent in a gift that was a mama that had healing a daddy that possessed it and they reached into what they were and claimed the promise that they are do you understand what god's trying to achieve in this mess we're in sometimes it takes the situation eve had to go before adam knew he possessed those attributes i believe adam walked out of that garden knowing he's coming back because god gave it to him and he didn't want to return there so when the second atom came he was going to quicken the seed or the gene or the attribute so that person would become an attribute and be able to walk up to his side as a queen and fellowship both of them being from the creator because it wasn't a new creation it was the same creation adam and eve both possessing the original attributes both possessing the original works both possessing the same being the same gene and the characteristics you are beyond sinners saved by grace you are the redeemed thoughts of god restored again you are a different class of people a different category you're gonna live in a different city in a different place in a different kingdom there'll be those that love you and that you love that'll be there they'll live on the side of that mountain and they'll come up and take from the tree of life a leaf that allows them under the attributes that you have to come into that city and to come in and out and have life but you are the word that was in the beginning returned home let's look for the revelation that will manifest the things that god has promised you hear what i say for the things we haven't seen yet but the hour has come the time is here that we better find our weapons because satan is out and this is the greatest battle that's ever been fought and he brings sickness fear death but god's given us the greatest weapon that he could give us not an intellectual word but a gene life amen that was there from the beginning do you love them tonight oh church we are moving into glorious things are we moving into hard times yes are we moving into testing times yes but we're more in conquerors in christ jesus the trying of our faith is more precious than gold but let faith have its perfect work because all that he's sanctified justified he's sanctified and all that he sanctified he glorified and this bride is going to come into her glory the glory of the resurrection the glory of the nature of christ the glory of the attributes and genes that they are manifested god bless you let stan billy if you'd come and help me can you believe that for yourself this evening brother branham said in pervy faith jesus had faith in what the scripture said he was can't we have faith in what the word says we are oh lord let's pray if you look across your life and you look across your mind and you know that that little spirit of doubt works if when our brother gave our testimony if you said oh he he was at this place and he shouldn't have been and oh he's a spreader and and oh my if all those other elements weren't there it wouldn't be the testimony that it was if jesus didn't go past everybody at the pool of bethesda and all those things were there [Music] the scripture said that jesus perceived that the man had faith that the lord gave him a call and vision so he went there and he asked the man sir would you be healed the man believed in healing he said sir i wait and every time the angel comes before i can get to the pool someone steps in before me he looks over look at me no doubt he began to talk to him until he contacted his spirit maybe he told him how he got sick and why what put him on that
