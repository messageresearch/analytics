Description:
60-0611E: Faith Is The Sixth Sense
Br. William Marrion Branham - Tape
August 21, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

your face oh god of Jacob amen Amen brother Philip andrez a tonen if you could come at this time uh good evening sorry I'm a bit nervous but uh so I'll just kind of jump into the story so probably what was it October I think it was October 30th or 29th something around that time so I was overh helping Davey and uh I'd walked up this ladder and I was putting down this fish tank put it down and the ladder slipped back and I fell off the ladder onto my back which was quite traumatizing at the time it hurt I got up walked for a little bit and then I couldn't walk and so they took me to the emergency room and uh so when they went to there like I bruised up my hip and a little bit but when the doctor actually they did a trauma scan and when the doctor got back he wasn't concerned about the bruises or anything cuz what they' found what they call an incidental find of an aortic aneurysm which at the time was like what's that so I looked it up um and looking if you look up what an aortic aneurism it is not so what it is is you have it on your um for me particular it's on the trachea it's where the blood vein that runs off your heart is larger than it should be sort of like blowing up like a balloon to a certain degree and typically the first thing it likes to throw on there is statistics of if this bursts because that is the concern with an aortic aneurysm as it gets larger it increases the chances that it's going to burst and it's like pretty much if this bursts it's going to kill you unless you are already in the hospital the time that it'll B lead your you out will pretty much kill you which reading that straight up terrifying like hold on what and in a lot of ways that that that weighed heavily on my spirit for a long time now the doctors didn't NE they try not to tell you that because they know that it will terrify you and in a lot of ways it'll increase your blood pressure which pushes pressure on it makes it hurt but of course I looked it up immediately and which caused it to hurt to a certain extent and so like when you're feeling for they determine the risk based on size and pain and so now that I'm thinking about it it starts to hurt and so you start worrying about it so it starts to hurt more and that's its own spiral into the the ground and so a lot of times like your chest is hurting and so what they say to do is go to the emergency room so you go to the emergency room they're like it's fine so you go back but then you're walking through your day-to-day and you still have that like chest pain and it creates a lot of concern and so when uh brother Matthew spoke his sermon and like they've been preaching on fear for like two or three sermons and it really it really hit me because in a lot of ways that was absolutely terrifying me and a lot of and I I really had to sit down and pray and like Lord you are in in control and what it be you you will lead it for the better and just surrender it to the Lord and look better and in doing so like you're not worried about it as much because you've trusted to the Lord and it reduces the pain and so you're not like listening to the devil in the back of your head who's like oh you're about to kill over and so instead of listening to that is just surrender to the Lord and so I just want to thank him for [Applause] that amen isn't it wonderful amen amen fear will not help you but faith will sign your pardon amen that's what we'll believe amen give me key of um hey amen Lord my heart can grow so far away and cold oh and by yet and for me your love is still the [Music] same oh [Music] and oh and in and fear of me oh and my head bow down in red to your name oh I your name your holy name oh andelo God it he oh and [Music] gra oh and the reason oh and my comfor and oh and know my heart that's my heart desire tonight is to be filled with [Music] Spirit oh and my purpose is to worship you oh and so open up my soul Hallelujah worship can I oh and to be afraid to your throne oh I [Music] oh and you're holy oh and Je Jehovah God all he oh and you're the Great I Am oh and the oh and my [Music] come just sing that voice one more time tonight oh and I [Music] live oh and oh holy oh and oh Jehovah God all oh and you the great am the is [Music] oh my confor and King hallelujah amen let's all stand tonight amen we're going to open our Bibles amen we're going to be reading uh we we'll listen to a portion of a tape uh tonight let's just open our Bibles in Hebrews uh 11 man it says faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things that do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his own gift and by it he him being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him by faith Noah being warned of God of things not not seen as yet moved with fear prepared enough for the saving of his house house it says by by by the which he he condemned the world and became an heir unto righteousness which is by faith our father we ask that you bless your word tonight to us we commit everything we are and ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats so I was thinking about preaching tonight but it just so happened I was thinking about the just the the services if you really um uh you know I always think it's amazing how the Lord will open up a door and every Minister will almost just line up and it's not like we talk to one another but you just gets inspired this one preached that one gets inspired we we we we it just seems to be a string of the word just tying together and so so much is being said about faith and I was thinking and this tape came to my heart you know the name of it is Faith is the six sense and there's this portion where I feel like baram just takes everything that's been preached and just combine it in about 40 minutes and if you really pay close attention you will really this will really be a blessing because I believe that the purpose of preaching is to inspire faith if we cannot Inspire faith we have failed we don't know what we are doing here the purpose of preaching is to inspire Faith so that faith can operate in the heart of a Believer and produce what God is looking for because without if otherwise if we do it by knowledge knowledge is not going to be helpful knowledge will will help you have a bunch of things that you know but that are not applicable to anything knowledge will cause confusion knowledge will get to a place where it's going to fail you but faith will hold you up no matter what the circumstance is so I was thinking about this in and and this is just me trying to summarize everything about what we're going to hear I I thought from my heart this is the very fundamental of what faith is and how Faith Works and how do we act and put faith in action so I I really want you to pay attention to when we're going to here you hear him talk and and he's it's a it's before a prayer line so he's really going quick you know how it does it just jumps from one or another just trying to compile really quick to build up Faith in the people and and one of the things you really realize that we are really made to live by faith and not by sight and and and 90% or 100% of the time when we fail is because we go by knowledge rather than by faith we we let the word uh and I'm not saying anything bad about what what we know we know so much and not of what the prophet said in fact someone can be reading a quote you already know how to finish that quot and I think that's wonderful because we have to be students of the message and the Bible but there's an element of faith that God is requiring because really faith is the only Supernatural element about us faith is made so it will take you in your flesh as you are connect you to the kingdom of God so you have access to what the Supernatural is yes sir it is not a natural you're not you you you didn't study enough to create Faith In Yourself is a supernatural element that contacts the Supernatural and brings the supernatural into manifestation and and so that's why the prophet will say we the Revelation can never be overemphasized because that's what we live by and so you will hear him say that and so the you also see and and I and I I just want to say this because when we speak about faith there is instances where the Prophet will talk about one coming on the prayer line and and either you know but will say did you feel this did you see this and and they will believe and and they will pray and they will believe and they will go on believing that God did something for them but I thought this was so wonderful because this is what the if the very fundamental Faith was that you one would come and it will be prayed for and I thought I was thinking about the the testimony our sister Heidi came and gave that the people will come and give a testimony without any proof of anything having changed and and hear me out because this is the faith that moves the mountain it's not because you see the mountain crumbling then you have faith no this is nothing has changed everything is exactly the same but God quickens in the hearts of the believer something and they are able to stand there and proclaim the word of God and by doing so it causes the mountain to crumble and that's why I said the very fundamental so if we were to get out of here and say I want to know how Faith Works just listen to what the prophet said you will understand it's not one that you come up and you jump and you feel oh the you prayed for and you feel and I'm not taking that away the are people the the People Prayed for it happens right away there's people they come on the prayer line some thing they came and they they they walk away well and all of that but the fundamental of faith is based upon I am believing what God has said even though with the natural eyes I'm not seeing anything but I believe the word and the word performs what you are looking for I believe the word because something within my heart is believing and you stand there and Faith goes to work for you but whenham says this um in one place he says and and he says it says we are grateful to God and that we have the five senses but by no means were these s given to us to guide you it says they were given to you for you to uh for your Earthly contact but there was one given to you the six sense and that six sense is belonging it belongs only to the Christians something that was given to contact God and it says it's only given and you cannot have the six sense until you are be you have become a Christian he said in another place and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you it says and if we'll if we it says if we will let the five senses be yielded by the six sense it will give you it will guide you and and bring you all the senses under control of that one super sense the scripture will say in John 5 and4 it says 1 John 5 and4 it says whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world it says this is the victory that overcometh the world even of Faith so it's to say that it's the element of Faith that's the the instrument by which we overcome the things of the world it's not because we've gained knowledge it's not because we've gained access and we know this we know that it's not because of what we strive after but God gives you the faith in order for you to be an overcomer in in in the message preparation baram says he says he can't do anything for us till we accept it and say that we have accepted it and believe it and then he says and testify of it is that right he says he can do nothing no matter what you've got to accept it first by faith and believe it and confess confess that it's right and before God makes it right it says in your steady it says in your before God makes it right in your stead as the heart high priest so God wants us to move by faith to to believe by faith to take it by faith then he comes as the high priest to make it happen he says that but but but he cannot touch he says the devil the the devil can get into the five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch the super sense that's as far as that's that's far far beyond his reach brother bam says the super sense controls natural senses the super sense is something that will make you believe God's word and it says and if you would only be spiritual and use the six sense how many things you would bypass I thought we could bypass a lot of pain a lot of headaches a lot of things if we would approach it and believe God by the super sense by the fifth by the F the the six sense and see what God is is is wanting to do with us so it's not long it's only 40 minutes um and I I I don't want to go through it but as we go through you will just hear how and I I I really want you to focus on the fundamental on how God is operating and how Faith the faith of God is moving in the people and bringing the word of God to come to pass so God bless you let's listen to it and then and then we'll close it's only 40 minutes it's not going to be too long it delivers us and rescues us from our five senses that we were put in in the beginning and that fifth sense down here the five senses man fell there with them senses by his appetite now notice that these senses was given to you to only to contact your Earthly home that you might see taste feel smell and hear but they're by no means to lead you and now many times what if I refuse to look anymore and I just bind up my eyes and say I refuse to look all right my eyes can't serve me no more more well then I finally I'll go blind and then when my Boy comes on I'll tie his eyes up and say no sir there's no such a thing as tight I just tie his eyes up don't let him see he said my father told me there was no such a thing as s so I'll tie up my boy's eyes well the first thing you know our generation would be born blind right if you don't use your six senses they become dment they won't act at all brother that's what the church has done to the six sense not putting in he's just placed Faith Off In Miracles and signs and the things that contacts God and gives him the Holy Ghost and things he's placed that off over there or back over here somewhere till the thing has become dead right we don't know how to use it the things that's nothing doing you say well God's A Healer oh what about that God's A Healer if he ever was a Healer he's still a Healer if he ever was a savior he's still a savior if he ever was God he's still God so you see it's a lack of faith that's been preached into the people that makes them let that six sense which is Faith laid dant and Through the Years they'll run out these sick and run to the doctor and say doctor oh I got something wrong with me doctor look at say you'll try a man of good honest doctor or work this as patiently as he can with all the power that God will give him to operate and do things that he should do to help you then the first thing you know it advances on well he says I just have to tell you uh there's nothing more that I can do if you want to go to another doctor go see well then you go to another doctor and you say no nothing can be done it's too far Advanced now now that is the time that's the time to call on the six sense that's the time to accept God that's the time to rely upon the spirit of faith that God has put in you and now when it's been people been taught against it so long it makes it hard brother Bose was telling me they said brother brand I never realize what you bucked against see you don't realize what it is what a hard thing when you bring and the power of God will come right down so real to the people they can look and see the spirit moving among the people and doing things and someone sit there and say oh if you just do this or do this or do that or something other maybe it would help me old brother if that six sense could understand what we've been preaching about this week amen that the Holy Ghost God made this promise Christ made the promise we Puck it through the scriptures this week back and forth and back and forth and comb it over until we know that God promised to do this thing he is doing now in this day the supernatural now real genuine faith that see that and catch a hold of it and all Devils Out of Hell will never Shake him away from it but we stumble at it it's not used enough we depend too much on the five and once most of the time the 95% of the people are better as soon as they see the five senses is finished well it's all gone dig my grave get my casket ready see oh I was thinking of a little woman here I had on interviews a day or two ago I don't see him here now a man's name is uh kind of a D Dash or do and his wife she had a dream and she come telling me the dream and she said brother brandom I I dream that the devil come upside of my bed and he looked over at me and begin to make ging funny uh faces at me and said I got you now and said I just something happened to me and I jumped up out of the bed and said get out of here devil in the name of Jesus and started running him and he run out of the house and she said I don't understand what that means then the holy spirit being present give the interpretation just a little after that her husband had a heart attack and when she seen her husband fall and he's an aged man heavy man and his hands went back and his eyes set death come to take him but God wasn't through with him that little woman's Faith raised up and said I won't stand for it I call for his life in the name of Jesus Christ he got well see why that six sense roll up that crucial moment that time that give her faith God had give her the dream though had not been interpreted to her yet I said there there's your interpretation a little fellow just begins screaming and praising God she said that's exactly the way it happened see that's now that's goes into Grace see give her the dream not even knowing what it was but God is thankful and loyal anyhow to keep his people posted if we would only be spiritual and use that six sense we ohe how many things we could bypass how many things we'd know if the church was an order where the spirits and Gifts of the church would be operating we'd have Anon Sur laying all over everywhere that's right sin would be out of the church but we become so Earthbound with our senses just so well if they can't see it if I can't and then them senses the devil gets into those senses and he'll let you see something with your eyes and then disbelieve it anyhow because many times you kept your eyes close along until you're blind a fellow said to me one time said smile me blind smite me blind you believe in Divine Healing same holy ghost that Paul preached smite me blind I said I can't do it because you're already blind I said your father the devil did that a long time ago see you you you you're already blind for the Bible said he's blind this gospel is is it's hid to anybody it's those that are blind that hasn't tried to use their senses the sense of God gave them that sense if it's used it's a sense of Deliverance when the other five fail by this sense there's been great things done here some time ago in one of my meetings there was a lady come across the platform and she had a a cered stomach bleeding and the Holy Spirit began to speak which she know I couldn't do that and told her who she was where' she come from she had an uler stomach now when got through it said thus sayith the Lord your heel and she went home and there was a a lady neighborhood was way on down the prayer line when it comes she had a growth on her throat and when the prayer line got down to her it said to her said told her who she was where' she come from all about it she said That's All Right Said thus sayith the Lord you're healed and so them two women went that night got together they didn't feel any difference that don't have anything to do with it that doesn't have one thing to do with where you feel you you don't you get away from these feelings if you're going to rely on them you can't rely on that because it's the evidence of things you don't see taste see or smell or here it's another sense watch what happened about two weeks past this woman with the uler in stomach she tried to eat and she just like to die but she still maintained she said there's something Supernatural about it because the man never seen me in his life and yet he told me who it was and it's got to be Godly because it Compares with the Bible see and she said and I know that fellow heard him preach and he's uneducated he knows nothing about these things and told me all about it and the same man said thus sayeth the Lord if he's a servant of God he couldn't say that if he just thought it it's the Holy Spirit talking through him that you are healed and she kept on and her her h husband was a Christian her children and she said and she goes see her little lady frame down the street from her had a not no difference but both of them purposed in their heart that they had accepted that to be God and that's all there was to it one morning the children was gone to school and she's standing washing the dishes and she just could hardly eat anything because the aler would just burn her up she was washing the dishes and she said all at once a real cool feeling come over and she went on thought what was that I just felt so funny just real light and a cool feeling well she just went on washing the dishes in a few moments she got real hungry so she goes over at the at the table and the children had left some oatmeal in a dish so she dipped up that oatmeal in a spoon and she ate it and a little bite of toast she thought well as usual I bombit it up maybe in a few minutes and so she um went on the first thing you know it was all right right went on she got all right then she went over and tasted it again it was all right then she really had a gastronomical jubilees she goes over and Fries her a couple of eggs a big bunch of bacon got her a cup of coffee and she really eat she went on washing the dishes around a little while then she got up on her feet she felt fine she raised up her hands and begin to praise God run down the street she's go tell her sister about what happened when she got down there this little lady was Walking the Floor shaking the Sheep just as hard as she could said well what's the matter sister said look that thing's gone off my neck I can't find it in the sheet I can't find it anywhere at all it was gone what was it because they held on to that six sense how the word of God that wouldn't take no for an answer they come to the meeting about two months after that both of them showed me how they were healed and everything what was it the six sense that six sense that sense of power that thing that delivered him not because I prayed but because that they believed that's it that done it now there was up at the cadle Tabernacle up in Indianapolis or down from here it is the Indianapolis they had a a boy that had had polio and they brought after the rediger girl was healed brother reiger's girl was sitting out there in a in the Coal Shed trying to hold her she gone insane how many remember be rediger the pastor of for Gospel Tabernacle all talk about man believed in healing the days of brother bonworth don't you remember Dr s and very fine man and his daughter sitting out there had gone insane with a disease of the mind that had killed her sister and she was a beautiful woman was on Easter morning and her mother was sitting out there and after got through the prayer line somebody said there's a lady out here in the Coal Shed in the at the church with her daughter said she's Mrs be riger from the fort wine Gospel Tabernacle I thought what be e riger's wife and daughter sitting in my coin and I went out there and there they sit on little old benches have been thrown from the Sunday School in there with papers beautiful girl sitting there about 18 20 years old pulling out her hair like this and saying a nickel is a nickel a penny is a penny nickel is a nickel a penny saved a penny a penny made a penny saved a nickel lost a nickel lost going on like that pulling her hair going on I said Mrs rediger I said you're Mrs rediger she said I am and I said said I'm brother brandom she said well I'm glad to meet you brother brandom I said your husband was almost an idol in my heart when I was a little boy what a great man she started weeping I said this is his daughter said yes brother Brown we've had her everywhere nothing can be done and her sister Roma died I said did Roma die with that I said I got your all pictures at home and everything your books on Living Waters and so forth that brother Ediger wrote I said well when I was even a boy he was a great man I used to listen to him on the radio I said this is his daughter said that's his his daughter something come up on me her daddy dead and buried I walked over to that six sense begin to move I said Satan you can't hold her any longer in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her so the mother said I said she said what must I do I said she's he you'll take her home she's still sitting there nickel is the nickel a penny made a penny lost and so forth like that going on they Tu her home and the next day she come to herself and is a married woman with a bunch of children now what was it holding on to that six cent sometime ago if you wanted the confirmation of this testimony what six cents will do we was at uh I was with brother GH Brown 505 Victor Street at Little Rock Arkansas and there was one of the harest cases I ever seen in my life brother Brown actually was kind of taking a little uh recess from standing in the prayer line long he said brother him down in the basement here in the auditorium is one of the horriblest sites you ever seen said that woman was healed of insanity from up in Mississippi her boy was a soldier she'd been in there for 20 years didn't even know her boy and she came to her right mind while I was praying for her that just set the thing apart and then he said look at this I went down there in a great heavy woman young with her feet sticking right up with just the little clothes on her where they put in on her in the institution because she never raised her feet hadn't been on her feet in two years her limbs were bleeding her arms was bleeding and she was laying with both feet up and both hands up like that and I said to the man I said what's the matter I said she lost her mind brother Brandon she took a shot and something happened to her said right after our baby was born and said it it paralyzed something in her mind said she's been in the institution now for 2 years and said I said what's she bleeding so about said well they wouldn't dismiss her from the institution and said they wouldn't take an anus because she's she's real rational and said I hired a brother to take a chevret car and got four more men and we tried to hold her in that back seat four man and she kicked the windows out and things coming down here about 90 miles from the institution where she was from and I said you mean she bleeding like that I said well I'll walk out and lay hands on her said oh don't you do that said she'd kill you well I was just young in the way and I been in the ministry like this for about oh I guess something like a year and I thought God would take care of that I walked on out on the floor and she just had her hands up I said how do you do sister and it was a good thing that I was watching that great big powerful arm possessed with the devil they're 10 times her power and she gave a jerk like that so hard she jerked me from off my feet and when she did my foot hit right across her her bosom here and jerked my hand loose and I run from her and run up on the step like that her husband standing there and she come after me crawling on her back like a serpent making a good time chasing me on her back with her hands and feet up just going I can still hear that hideous noise dragged like a snake coming across the floor she weighed about 170 lbs and she's dragging like that she come right up there turned around put her big Strong Limbs against the wall like that and kicked real hard hit a a bench sitting out there and knocked the hide off her head part of her scalp peeled out blood began to run out like that she tuck this stick that broke off from it and threw her at at her husband and knocked all the plastering off the wall we had to duck her head he said I told you I said I never seen anything like that in my life he said what is that brother BR I said that's the devil and just saying she crawled right up she said William brandom you have nothing to do with me I brought her here and her husband looked over and said why she don't even know who she is how she don't know you I said that's not her that's the devil that's that devil now I said Satan you realize and do know that I have no power over you but my lord does for he he triumphed over you at Calvary and by a Divine gift given to me by an Angel which told me to get the people to be sincere and nothing would stand before the prayer I said in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her no change her old husband old overhauls on threw his arm around my neck begin to hug me and he said what must I do with her brother brandom I said take her on back to the institution if they'll receive her he saidwell what do you think I said it isn't what I think it's what do you think' he said I believe that she'll be well I said that's all you need to do I believe she'll be well on the road back that night they never had one bit of trouble with her the next morning when the they come in to get her she was setting up and spoke to the matron and the second day she was dismissed from the hospital perfectly normal and well about 6 months after that I was at Jonesboro Arkansas was Richard Reed at the oldfashioned Revival hour Tabernacle at at Jonesboro Arkansas used to be a Baptist Tabernacle seats many more than this year this place and I was starting to preach and I kept seeing somebody waving at me out there and I didn't know who it was and she just couldn't stand it no longer she said you remember me had four or five little children I said I don't believe I do she said I never seen you before either she said but I was the woman that was on my back crawling and her husband in that six months time had been called to the ministry and he was going out to preach the gospel oh my what is it holding on to that's 6 sense Faith said so he said I kept that in my heart if God could do such a thing to others he can do it for my wife he kept holding on to that nothing would separate him from it that's what that six sense will do when it's turned loose and let it have its controlling power one night I come home I was laying in my bed if you want to write for these testimonies I'm giving you addresses you write to Georgie Carter miltown Indiana uh and it'll it'll go to her Georgie Carter mil Town Indiana and she belonged to a church that did not believe in Divine Healing she was taking piano lessons when she was a little girl and her uncle was taking her to this uh to piano uh lesson and when it did

Lord she said all right Billy just go on and go to bed I went in the room and I prayed and praying for a long time and after a while I looked over there and Mama's Just One of these oldfashioned country women wash her clothes and lay them in a chair I don't know whether you women ever did that or not lay them there till she arms them stands around barefooted and arm and uh so I mama had chairs sitting there and clothes in them all of us boys and at home and I was staying home there after I'd lost my wife long time and I looked and looked like that chair was coming toward me and when I looked it was that light coming towards me and when it got right to me I started like going through a Wilderness now I could hear something like a little lamb going bad bad and I thought all that poor little Fell's hooked up somewhere and I started through the brush trying to find it and when I got to a up close to it I could listen again I said where is it at i l the poor little thing and I started up close closer pulling through the brush and when it was bang it was going m mil toown mil toown and I was working trying to get to it and I come out of the vision I thought where is miltown

then on Sunday I asked again anyone know a place named miltown George W many of my people here from the Tabernacle know George W been coming there for years he said uh while brother brandom said Milltown is just down there on the southern about 35 miles from here a little city sits on a little Hill down there I said I know where it's that I said well you take me to it he said I will well then I said I'll be down the following Saturday well I went to Mid toown we went down there there's got about two groceries and I seen people come in their wagons and Buggies like you do down in Kentucky

and when I give the alar call he was on the Altar and become the pastor of that church to yet now a couple days after that I begin to preach on Divine Healing they told me about a girl that lived over the hill that was been in a bed nine years and six eight months without even seeing the outdoors well uh I said well I don't know if their Pastor done give out in a certain denomination Church said the days of Miracles has passed most all the churches around there said if anybody even goes up there you're excommunicated to begin with so her father was a deacon in that church so it was hard for them to come up there and my little book many of you might have read it called Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever well that the Little Nail girl's testimonies in there where she'd been healed well they sent me come up pray for a girl that had TV and her parents wanted me to come I went up and prayed for her she'd come back with me to church that night been laying there for a long time Georgie got a hold this and she just started weeping out finally her mother and father consented and I could come pray for her but they wouldn't even be in the house they went away and went away so I went in pour a little thing she try to call she go she couldn't hold her sped him and cut the spit in and she said I read the little book I looked there was my picture that little book called Jesus the same yesterday and forever and she said I believe he'll heal me and I said well I don't want to cause a friction in your church girly but where's your father and mother tears where she got enough Marsh her to get tears I don't know run down her face where you can even see where her skull was laced together she belonged to a very famous church that denies the power of God going it's a modern Pharisee they don't believe in no Holy Spirit no nothing just be baptized in water and belong to the church and so I didn't want to cause any hard feeling amongst the people and I said well now I'll pray for you and she said will you do like you did for the nail girl I said sister that was a vision I can only do as God says do and I prayed for her she didn't get any better finished up my Revival and I had about 6 years 75 to baptize the end of that week and she promised God if she could be healed she'd go be baptized up in a place called poton Ford in the little blue River there well day when the day come to be baptized I walked out there and there had been a preacher he had ridiculed me on water baptism oh my my and he' had a Revival in a tent just the top of the hill and while I was out there in the water of baptizing I said it just seems to me that the angels of God are sitting along and every one of his congregation that muddy water with pretty white dresses on walked out there and was baptizing Christian baptism every one of them that's right all out of time we started up to Mr Wes to eat supper and when I did I said I don't feel like eating supper before I go back to the meeting tonight I believe I'll go up and pray I have a burden on my heart for that little girl and I went up there and in the Hillside and started praying about few weeks ago I was down there the same Little Bush I was knelt down there praying looking up to God I try to be quiet and there be green bars around my legs scratching me you you just start to pray or do something right watch how the devil gets a hold of you and um I went back over here and the Sunshine setting was shine in my eyes I went back on this side everywhere he was and finally I just give up and I said Lord God let up the sticks hurt my knees or rocks hurt my knees or whatever more I'm praying and I started praying just by the time I got into praying real good I looked and out of a little Dogwood Bush anybody know what a dog wood is oh sure Ohio knows what dog Woods are and a little Dogwood Bush there that light that angel of God whose picture you got here that light was shining down out of that bush said rise to your feet I said yes my lord said go by the way of Carter that's all he said well when I I heard that bell ringing and Mr R told me he said now when that Bell Rings Mama's got supper on the table and you come on an old country Bell said you're ringing she when she's ringing it you come on I heard it but I was in division and I couldn't go you know God answers on both ends of the line don't you believe that the same time little Georgie was so nervous knowing I was going to leave the country she was crying and she wanted to come and be baptized and she'd promised God and she got real restless and her mother wonderful woman and she went out in the kitchen and knelt down and shut the door between her and Georgie and she said oh god of Heaven she said do something to that low down impostor that's come through our country here and the nine years that my poor little girl is laid on that bed she's never complained one time and now he's got her all scrupled up in her mind telling her about a Healer or something or another and said rebuke that man rebuke that man Lord she was honest about it she said run him out of the country my poor little girl laying in there dying with not a hope that she didn't live any longer and there laying in there like that and that imposter getting her all worked up under a false hope she said now this is her testimony I wasn't there she said she raised up she thought she heard someone coming she raised up her daughter lived up the hill a little ways and she thought it was her daughter she looked back she looked and said on the wall where the sun was going down the same time I was praying she seen a shadow coming down the wall it was Jesus she said said there is just as pretty as you ever seen with his beard he said why are you weeping who's is coming said she looked over here and she seen a shadow of me kind of partly baldheaded packing this here same Bible over my heart coming walking in with a man following me and she run in she said Georgie the funnest thing happened she said I must have went to sleep I dreamed a dream I saw that preacher coming about that time the door slammed on the car I was getting out on the outside oh God answers on both ends if you yes let him do it there was Georgie there believing against all the unbelief his still holding on that God would make her well if he could heal one girl he could heal another yes and she SE me I walked up under the anointing I never even knocked at the door just opened the door her father was gone up to his barn to get some milk that had just got through milking and so I walked up opened the door walked in there I this woman the mother just faded and fell over the floor and Georgie was there and she looked over at me and I said sister Georgie the Lord Jesus Christ in whom you love and there behind the bed the little poster bed she rubbed all the paint off of it as long as she get her hands back that way holding to that and crying to God for relief in her church telling her the days of Miracles just passed she was born to be a child of God there she's holding on to that promise God by his Mercy showed a vision and sent me down there there's where it was I said I know who you are now you're that lamb that I saw caught up in this bunch of theology down here amen Hallelujah I said Georgie the Lord Jesus who you love and serve appeared to me up here on the hill a while ago and that same light that hung over the nail girl and he told me to come by this way I command the devil in the name of Jesus Christ to leave you I said rise up on your feet Satan said how's she going to rise up and her leg's no bigger than a broomstick Harley that wasn't a thought come up bow and she couldn't even raise her spean cup and she rose up from that bed under the power of the Holy Ghost walked across that Forest praising God went out and sat down in the yard and bless the grass and the leaves and things she hadn't seen him for N9 years I turned around walked on away her mother raised and began screaming and falling and fell across the porch and out into the yard neighbors be coming thinking the girl had died or something and here she was in the yard walking around patting the leaves and blessing God her father heard all the noise so he come down the other lady's wife out and the people F her like that and he heard the orgon plan and he walked into the house there was his little water setting at the Oregon planing there is a fountain filled with blood dra from when siners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain oh my she hasn't been in bed no more than to go to sleep and since that time that's been 15 16 years ago oh what was it holding on to that six sense something on the inside saying if he can heal one he can heal me Hallelujah that's the truth that's right remember up here at Fort Wayne old John Ryan not the man with the whiskers the other blind John Ryan I was having meeting up there in a big Tabernacle I'm fixing the clothes go to praying for the sick this man was setting up in a balcon he is Catholic they brought him along the altar brought him up on the platform by his card when he come up where was that said your name is John Ryan that's right and you're Catholic but Faith he said that's right you used to ride in a circus that's that's right said and you've been blinding now for 20 something years or better said that's right and it's some kind of lukini or something they got into his eyes and Running Blind I said you're a beggar uh and he said not exactly a beggar but said I said on the street and I said well that's all right I said do you uh believe that Jesus Christ will make you well he said I do I prayed for him laid hands on him I said Lord Jesus I rebuke this blindness now in the name of Jesus Christ let it leave him I turned around looked I see him walking away with his sight I said thus sayith the Lord you watch for that amen thus sayith the Lord you've received your sight well he he said I can't see I said that has nothing to do with it go on on your road rejoicing so he went down there's a woman in a few minutes had a great guarder hanging on her throat while he was praying for her it went away here come John Ryan back pushing through all the ushers and coming back again and so the man was helping me in the prayer line he started putting off the platform he said I want to see that preacher and so they brought him up there again he said he said to me he said you told me I was healed I said you are he said well if I was healed I could see he said I said oh no that has nothing to do with it you told me he said well you said I was healed I said you said you believe me he said I do believe you I said then what are you doubting about he said but if I was he could not see I said you will see when God showed me a vision that you were seeing it has to happen he's Catholic he never been taught anything like that he said but I don't understand it what shall I do I said well the only thing to do is go on your road just praising God for giving your eyesight he said where are you he started pushing on said wait a minute said what is your name and I said brandham he said let me feel you now he put my hands away he said Mr brandham as a Catholic I'm taught to believe my priest and he said I've come to you for help you told me who I was and all about my conditions what nobody knows but God I believe it to be the truth I'll keep on saying praise God off the platform he went I couldn't hardly have the service the next two nights he'd get up everywhere hard say praise the Lord for healing me I'd start preaching to your gra up on praise the Lord for healing me they give him a job selling papers nearly a month was gone holling praise the Lord for healing me and he's down there and X3 praise the Lord for healing me they laughed at him they made fun of him little news boys hiss at him people on the street said that old man's lost his mind and he said xt3 X3 Read All About It praise the Lord for healing me X3 Read All About It praise the Lord for healing me all right they tuck him and they thought this gu had sent him to the insane institution and they questioned him he said I'm just as normal in my mind as I ever was but I believe God praise the Lord for healing me all like that what was it he's holding on to that sixense of the en holding that he wasn't paying attention where he could see that sight had nothing to do with it he was seeing with another sight he seeing God yes we look at things we don't see all the Christian armor is by faith yes he that cometh to God must believe that he is all the fruits of the spirit everything is Faith unseen we look at the Unseen we look at the Unseen by faith we see it Hallelujah a little boy let him across the street to get a shave in a barber shop and some little smart Barber want to make some fun out of him so he lathered up his face right good and other Barbers weeped his eyes I'm like that he said uh got shaving got about half side down had towel Inay up there you know what he said say papa Ryan he said yes son said I heard you go to see the holy order when he was up here yeah I did he said he said um I heard that you got healed he said yes I did praise the Lord for healing me and when he did that his eyes come open in the barber chair out of that chair he jump with a towel around his neck the barber around the door with the razor in his hand down the street when old man rid this as hard as he could go screaming and shouting praise the Lord he has heal me was it holding on that's six sense that's something that makes it real yes sir through this six sense has subdued kingdoms he the six cense subdued kingdoms through that six sense of walls of Jericho fell flat to the ground amen you believe that the walls of Jericho hit the ground through the six sense through the six sense the sea could not drown Paul amen when he went down there with all hopes was gone he saw a vision of the Angel of the Lord he come back up saying be of a good courage what was the matter no moon and stars for 14 days and nights is just as Black As It Ever Was the storm was just as great as it ever was but that six sense went to work when he seen the angel of the Lord hallelujah that six sense could not keep Peter in jail no sir the power of God sent an angel in there and delivered him the six sense could not keep Paul and silus and stocks God sent an earthquake and shut the whole thing down that's six sense let it go to work for you sometime because because of that six sense the Lions couldn't even meet Daniel they couldn't fool that six sense no sir but that six cents of fire couldn't burn the Hebrew children up but that same six cense that was working in Little Martha when she come to see Jesus raise her brother out of the Grave after being dead for 4 days that same six sense clean to leer that same six sense raised up Jesus Christ on the third day that same sucessor rats for the church one of these days and take it out of here Glory don't rely on the five they're deceitful but that's six one's right yes if you want there's a little fell here tonight I don't know whether Charlie Cox is here not I was talking to him on the six SS he tucked that and believed it and played it on a table why I said let me play it running in h the room and she started playing it she said Lord I've got a six sense to I'm going to put it the work I the Holy Ghost and here it come what is it if you believe it seeing we should believe without any seen but yet God lets us see it anyhow he shows it to us and shows us his his presence surely then there be no excuse that that six sense won't go to work let us bow our heads our heavenly father the six sense these testimonies from the Bible that the six sense is I call it faith I was reading in Hebrews 11 are the six sense Faith being the substance of things hop for the evidence of things that senses of the earth don't declare and we see through there how they subdued kingdoms and stopped the mouth of lions escaped the edge of the sword and and Enoch was translated into heaven for that's six sense Abraham Soul Jed in a Str land and received the son after he was 100 years old six cense When Sarah's womb was dead he considered not those things he staggered not the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving glory to God he know God made the promise and God he was fully persuaded would keep what he had promised oh God and we're supposed to be the children of Abraham what a poor excuse we are oh God wake up the sick sense in this church amongst these people tonight when we see that you gave that great sign to Abraham there what taking place God I pray that they'll see the angel of the Lord's presence tonight and will rely not upon their feeling upon their sight but upon the word of God that made the promise and every person in here will be healed and everyone is unsaved will be saved and all without the Holy Ghost will receive it hear me father I pray in Jesus name amen are you ready to receive your healing all of you amen you you going to put your six sense to work what is the six sense now is Faith and faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things that makes Missouri wrong I'm from Missouri you have to show me you know got to see it faith is that thing that subdues kingdoms that broughts righteousness that does all kinds of Miracles and signs of that six sense wake it up take the bandage off your spiritual eyes look around see if you can't see that God Still Remains all right all of you got prayer [Applause] cards anytime you're going through a bad day just put one of them tapes you you will woke up and just feel like Victorious and just still walking around and praising God we have the word with us and he keeps saying holding on to the six sense holding on to the six sense it he went from one example to another from one to another in every circumstance they were holding on to the six sense that's where our Victory lies a victory doesn't lie in the mult multitude of thinking and and whoo is me how do I get out of this and what do I do no take the word of God stand there and Proclaim it to be true stand there no matter what the circumstance looks like holding on to the six sense I I I just feel like going through and reading it but I I I just know that you heard it and it was so wonderful if the musician could come oh I tell you it's just so inspiring to know that th now this was not done 2,000 years ago this is Jesus Christ today this is Jesus Christ today in his church in his Believers this is what he's doing not what he's going to do this is what he's doing what we need is just to believe the word and and sometimes I feel like we we we don't like embarrassment we don't like to put ourselves out there well if I do it people are going to laugh at me what if it doesn't happen it doesn't matter it's not up to you to manifest it it's up to him to manifest it once it quickens your heart you stand there no matter what the ridicule is because you're no longer standing upon your own word you standing on God's word and he's responsible to bring it to come to pass the secret of Faith the fundamental of faith is that I heard the word I believe it and no matter no matter what I'm going to stand on it and it's not what if it doesn't it will transpire because God said we will do it according to his word and those that believe God will come and testify of his own word if we could stand now you see why I didn't preach it so he he just packs it in there I I I feel like it's just like just a boost of faith and and it just comes in and it just raises up and and if you are there how do you not just get in and feel like that same God who healed 2,000 years ago he was here to do the same thing and because banam is not here doesn't mean God is gone he's here in his people to do the same thing and and I believe and I want to say this even to my own thing I I feel like often time we we so much spend so much time studying and knowing and there's nothing wrong with that but I I believe there has to come this element of faith in the church that would take what we have learned what we know about the word of God just Quicken it just light fire on it that way we walking and knowing that I am connected with the supernatural I'm here with the ability to call upon the supernatural to come and defend my case yes outside of that we know we're not different from any other denomination not different from Catholic and and I like that that that that Ryan he he's here he said that well I know when I go to a priest and he tells me something I believe him and here I come to you you told me he said let me touch you he touches him and said on based on what you told me I am believing with all my heart that it's going to happen he walked away now now that's a Catholic we need faith we need God to qu Quicken us with that true Faith by the word of God as we hear it let's not just receive it as a knowledge but let's ask that the spirit of God will come as we are hearing the word to Quicken it in our heart then we won't live defeated Life we'll be victorious every corner every Junction of life amen amen Amen key of G amen you don't have have to worry oh and don't you be afraid oh when Joy comes in the morning oh and TR St on oh and for their of priding Jes Jesus Oh and will WIP your tears away oh and if your heart is broken oh and just lift your hands and sing oh
