from verse 1 to 10 and then we're going to go from 22 to 28. genesis chapter 49 verse 10 sorry verse 1 to 10. it says and jacob called unto his sons and and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which will befall you in the last days gather yourself together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father reuben nawaz thou are my firstborn my might it says in the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power unstable as water that shall not excel because thou wentest up to the father's bed then defiled the fall dao de faldo he when he went up to my couch he said simon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in the inhabitation oh my soul come not down into the secret unto the assembly mine honor be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and the wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel judah thou are he whom thy brethren shall praise says thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee judah is a lion a lion's wealth it says from the prey my son thou gone up thou art gone up he stopped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up the scepter shall never shall not depart from judah no the lawgivers from between his feet united until until shallow shall come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be and then verse 22 it says joseph is is fruitful full bot even a fruit brought by a well whose branches run over the wall it says the arches have surely grieved him and shot at him and and and hatted him but his bow abode in strength and the arms of the i and the arms of his hand were made strong by the hand of the mighty god of jacob from hence is the shepherd from the stone of israel even even by the god thy f even by the god of thy father whom shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above the blessings of the deep that lieth under the blessings of the breast and of the womb the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of thy uh of the progenitors unto the outermost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brother may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats if you're quiet we saw this scripture where jacob at the end of his life or israel at the end of his life i played two seasons he was calling his children up so he could bless them eventually and as we read that scripture i would like to title uh my little message tonight and call it what is your blessing we see here jacob a man who's blessing his children keep on the benediction who's pronouncing blessings upon his children a person immortal man that we know his path we know what it was we know the grace that he received from the lord at the end of his life he he he added out blessings to to his children he told reuben it was his first born making available it was the first bone but it was not to be on on above the others because he went into his father's bedroom his soul he didn't want to get into their secret to see it pascal because in their anger they came and they slaughter they don't you don't treat it so they killed people it was talking about how israel jacob had a daughter unification there was a daughter named and in the pilgrimage there was a prince who came and and and and and and uh took the daughter and simeon and and liver i didn't like it and when uh when the king came to see israel to tell them about that my son went into my idiot daughter mariana if you can give us if you can give her to us so we can marry her simeon simeone and liver i propose they told how their father how they cannot give their daughter to an uncircumcised people that if they want if you if he wanted to take her do some purple dresses frequency that all the other people had to be circumcised well accepted the king accepted it concealed two less zombies he went and had everybody circumcised in his family and when they were in the pain that's when simeon and levi took their sword they went and they killed everybody ela and then when when jacob was here blessing them he realized he said i cannot associate myself to your anger and then for levi and simeon he said i'm going to separate you in israel i am going to disburse you and when it comes to judah you don't like him he gave him the priority of the first place he says the scepter will not go far will not go away from judah the the kingdom the the the the power will never go away from judah jesus until shalom comes i can do it he blessed every single one of them but when the blessing of the father on top of the blessing blessings from above and the blessings from be beneath joseph joseph received all manner of blessings economic says when we see all the children go on after the the george israel had gone on the ship to commerce club we know that there were uh slaves in egypt and we know that god brought him out of uh egypt with moses and when they get to the other side of jordan caller moses uh mission came to its end the jose here it was joshua was supposed to go forward with them they can't lose their land don't leave the issue we realized that from from verse 13 to verse uh from chapter 13 to chapter 15. 15 until all the way up to chapter 19 joshua is allotting or dividing the land of israel and when we get to verse 18 he haven't gone certainly chapter 18 there were there was two tribes that didn't have uh land certificate there was no there was other tribes that didn't have the possession land yet and joshua is asking them to pick three people in each tribe dalek so they can go and explore the land because they had to fight for every piece of the ground one day in order for them to bring him the map so he can go and divide the land and we find out in chapter 18 of the book of joshua and there joshua is saying that levi will not have a place because levi his job was to be the the high priest or the priest of all of him a donkey left in other words levi didn't have a portion of the land he later dispersed he was dispersed in all israel come israel with jacob as israel or jacob said it in you find out in reality simeon didn't really have his own portion of land you find out that the portion that was belong that belonged to judah it was big they don't say donald trump and he was in the territory of judah that simion was placed we know all that according to the word because joseph's expression that joseph himself is the very expression of the blessing the expression of the prosperity it's the expression of prosperity a contest for the cell of my sister i conducted you you know when these children of israel walked with god as you one day is it a fatigued contribution yeah they were they were tired of the leadership of god if you leave warren welcome to lesotho they wanted to have a king like all the other countries they wanted to have a king like all the other nations it's not the level of prophet they went and taught the prophet samuel london that we want a king we want to have a king all right as god promised you something that you didn't get them why do you want a king why are you rejecting the leadership of god montreal what it would take or what what would happen when they if they would have a king you don't need a male ghost they said regardless of all of that they still wanted to have a king and look what happened when they decided to go and pick a king either there was no promise or that was saying that that the kingdom of the power will go to benjamin but saul the benjamin benjamites became king a doctor and in his kingdom he said confronted he came against goliath goliath laughing goliath caused child to tremble goliath caused uh saul and his army to tremble and i want you to realize this young man experienced who had no experience of the army who was just as a a shepherd as a simple shepherd he was his name was david but who knew the attributes that he was of the tribe of judah eleven new solutions he came on the field of battle mode he said who's this and circumcised who's cursing the army of the lord who's this unbeliever who's cursing the army of god i'm going to fight him all i said they tried to discourage him buddhist that he could take you and break every single bone in your body but david was not looking at that davis david knew that he was of the tribe of judah davin what david knew that samuel had already anointed him king thank you that one day he would get to the throne deficit of that everything every everything that came before him if there was one that was supposed to die he was convinced that it would not be him that's why he had the power or the courage to fight the lion that's why he had the the the courage to fight the uh bear basketball because he knew the blessing that was uh laid upon the tribe of judah and what samuel had already done for him when they say that one of them was supposed to die between the two of them david he didn't even bother him the battle against goliath he didn't watch or he didn't care about the training of goliath david didn't look at the the shields and the the the weapons of goliath david was looking at the blessing of the father i come to fight you on the basis of my faith david didn't know what kind of weapon he would use just by inspiration i just want you to imagine a little young child he's going to fight a warrior he comes and he picks up five dollar stones with this that all the philistines could mark the army of israel and no one encouraged david to go and fight goliath but it's david who knew his position is david who knew his blessing the devil one of my young brothers our fourth is unfortunately they landed jack david there was a a son of a deacon his name was david he was seven years old [Music] he was a very interesting young man i would talk to him and one one day i asked him a question david i said your name is david david he said david killed the lion he killed the bear he killed goliath and and you what have you done he said he's actually he says i've already killed a a fly that's why he could fight goliath without hesitation and we know that he killed goliath and when he killed goliath the first thing that soul asked whose son is it in other words of what tribe is he is attributed and when they said it was from the tribe of judah like a country some country that when they go back when they went back that the sisters that knew how to see that they started singing how that david killed tens of thousands thousands and sold only thousands and all that saul could see that the kingdom this this young man was going to take the case that david as son of judah of the tribe of judah that is the the power or the the the power of the kingdom was given to them they contacted that's how we started fighting david mcconaughey regardless of what somebody else is trying to do generally to bring saul's life to an end he says oh it's far from the lord on the anointing but saw him he wanted to put his hands on david but david had the blessing i want you to look at the blessings of a mortal person mortal man proverbs are completely certified it can it can happen in that manner and we know from david until jesus [Music] that the scepter never left judah it was it stayed in the tribe of judah come israel as israel pronounced coming as jacob had said it but he was a man of flesh but our lord jesus cannot repent who's our god everybody is our father he came in this world as a man he walked as a man he gave us an example but says surely they ate manna out there but they didn't know about it about this jeremiah but i want to ask you something have you ever come into that place in in a place in your life plus where christ means more to you than all the arguing you could do about your church ask chris has christ meant more to you than the whole world i don't mean from an emotional or mortal or a mental workout i mean from the depths of your heart that's something that's settled in there montranco [Music] but you are hidden away and your whole motive is to serve jesus christ if you if you if you entered that place have you come into the place where you don't care what anybody's what anyone says not go out and act smart but still but till the love of god is so anchored in you that you can't you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of god love everybody flowing free from everywhere galileo what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we got to come to said where god does the placing and the calling you get what i mean and that's that's that's what was the life of christ the business of the father he shot the complexity of what he was about to do he says if it was about me i won't do it but but all nevertheless that your will be jesus jesus walk by giving us an example evel and at the end of his life he did as israel he did as jacob did john john chapter 14 verse 17 he prayed for us when we read john john chapter 17 we could see the very same thing that israel was telling to his children when jesus began to pray for us he wants he says he wanted to see us united knew this that he wanted that way he was that we can also be there that as it was that we may be the same cause that what he did that we also do it he says he's not praying that he may take us out of the world may preach on the thunder mode but he prayed that us being in the world and each one of us can take it as his personal blessing that god has said this circle jacob if jack or what jacob did you better complete a letter it could come and pass at the letter accomplished at the letter how much more when he went to the cross he says they are complete all it is all finished do they accomplish it's finished according and that means he is giving us all manner of blessings said the kingdoms are called access to sociability it means it's giving us access to all manner of blessings now we read that the children of israel were eating manner but they didn't know what what it was and in the old testament was what was referred to as the hidden manner in the holy of holies that only the high priest could get in lesotho all the rest of them never had access to that place because but when jesus cried out at the cross the bible tells us that the the veil of the temple was ranked into access to tell us that where we didn't have access to the things that we didn't have access to that we can liberally access them now that we now all have access to the holy of holies [Music] it's no longer about the priest himself and it's not just about the preacher himself but it's about every son and daughter of god that god has given every son and the daughter of god that the preacher does not have more blessings than a drunk man who just believed tonight you don't do this that they all have access to the same blessings these are two seconds but they have the same access to the same privilege that there was a powerful preacher he came and he find himself next to one of his servants a sister from his church one of his followers and before them there were two crowns there was one that was big and shiny that was in front of him and there was another one that was a little small next to it they asked the preacher to come forward and come and take the crown he said he could tell us about me and he said certainly that's my believer it says no that crown is not yours it's a return he looks aside it is a pokey he says it's for who what is the pull ourselves it says it's for the sister you know i said to him he said buddy she was my believers i'm the one who brought her to christ it says yes it was your uh uh your sheep and it's you are very successful but when you had success in your meetings it's because that sister was praying for you no success that this crown is due to punish a second it's to say that every single one of us before the lord has the right and the access to all the blessings and we come into that by faith david like david david david had nothing mila vela he had the faith that god promised that the scepter will be in judah that god who spoke to the mouth of his prophet samuel that he will be king i'm not gonna die until that i am never going to die unless i have access to the blessings that do me my regardless of how how uh tired or weak i am see don't set the parallel if in this bible then benediction there is a blessings that's reserved to me and i believe that it belongs to me i am going to go forward like david who posted that ability so i may possess that blessing because it belongs to me i heard speak he says because it's written on the cover he said the holy bible it's the holy bible and that i believe it looks like a permissible religion so every promise in the book promise every promise in the word he possessed that by faith in the sixth sense faith faith is the sixth sense paragraph 55 he says he says now i'm not going to use the line of discernment it was at the end of service and sometimes but random will use the discernment and oftentimes it will increase the faith of the people it it is i'm not going to use the line of discernment i couldn't get 50 through it it says i couldn't do it but i'm going to pray no it says now if god still remains god if god is still god allah is put to fair exactly then here can do oh then he can do all things formula just the way he he says what's the highest form of faith there was a roman there was a roman one a jew said come lay your hands on my daughters that's what the jew said i'm not worthy just say the word that's what the gentiles are supposed to do this solomon empowered just say the word and sometimes we think before god can do anything people can do that but we have to have our people here lay hands on us you know in africa sometimes it's it's it's a little complicated the the the uh placing laying on hands spiritually it's not spiritual oh [Music] it's the highest form of faith when the word is pronounced destiny you know it's for you you know it's yours just and you take that word like david took his word it's a fourth of it and you go forward with it he says it says in the meetings across the city in different places they can see one supernatural thing take place the whole audience will just walk out by faith see they'll believe it but here it's so hard it says there was a captain they don't want to navigate that they were navigating that he got sick he was very sick he thought he was going to die he asked if there was anybody with the bible that if someone could read a scripture to comfort him someone read the scripture to just increase his faith they said there was a young boy who brought him a bible he read him isaiah it says there was no beauty on him to be desired but yet it was for our sins and our trespasses that it was that he brought upon himself it says it's by his stripes that we are healed he said to the captain that's what the bible says but i'll read you the bible like my mom showed me how to read like the way they said that by his stripes we were healed that you replace that with your name if they said the blessings was for paul i am paula that person if the blessing says it was for timothy if the blessing was for esther i am esther at that time because every promise is mine and when jesus went on the cross before whatever i complained to black piazza but says he he he he brought forth a a a double uh expedition it was first for the salvation of our souls and also for the healing of our bodies it was to bring us back to our place is to bring us back into our tarot deed to bring us to a place where we can recognize our place of blessings because regardless of what the enemy is going to come say regardless of what goliath is going to come before you we are never going to tremble we have it says and when a man's when a man has said that he believes the word on street scholar sentence and then when the holy ghost or the holy spirit comes selected it's the abstract to the title and that gives you permission for diversity when you have the abstract allo that very bit of that belongs to you and everything everything is on it there is no exception in a particular level there's not a place that's taken out but everything that's in it all the blessings belongs to me amen amen and that gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this title deed that god that god saw back yonder before the fourth for the foundation of the world a dirty lover and skill and not was born through a man and a woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when i believe on it i received the deed mcconnell but when the holy ghost came like the little epileptic child that i prayed for that came through from the grandfathers genetics even if it's a genetic disease like medicine that when your father has this and your mother has this yeah you have this culturality when you have the abstract dude don't you are like better discerning somebody when you have the blessing of the lord enough the limit there is no limit elijah parallel he said in his word because jesus beat on you i am your god get the pardon who forgives you of all your iniquity there is no limit it doesn't say okay when you get over here there's your purple powder that i can never forgive you it is your sister it says i am your god get the down that forgiveth you of all your iniquity and who heals you i gave it to you it's already done two seconds of ourselves all that we have to do is to come forth and by faith claim those blessings but there's our faith because christ has already done it it's already accomplished but it's for us to come forth he says but when the abstract had cut has come eli fussy is struck off abstraction omitted everything i'm an abstract holder then amen and as sure as the spirit that raised christ from the dead gently to the appropriate and contestable i have an abstract deed that's not part of your body that i'm part of that body my first years impacted us my brother you are part of that body my self-changing partners are causing my sister you are part of that body it's christ who said it it's not me my words as sure as the words of jacob could come to pass if you can come by faith the word of jesus will come to pass for you there's no limit he says it says i have an abstract deed that i'm part of that body palette contest with the abstract the sentence freaky fair completely with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body making that body of the word exactly live out just exactly like he did in him as he promised in the last day contestable the abstract to my persian all my sins by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost says come come contestable what are you scared about and i'm alive again [Music] nothing even death and going to hurt you don't worry about it benediction if you could come by faith and come to it god will bring it to pass it says even death it says it ain't going to hurt you it's so let's go right quick now let's go the abstract the communication we are too it's it's like a house that has everything it treated his atp and everything has been paid for do you think that warfare all that we have to do is to get in if the points you don't have and take what we have need of by faith and that depends upon our faith mother continues to act they told me a story the thief they had to go and give food to a certain group of people a that everything had to bring in the container [Music] that the one who brought the smaller container they will fill up his container and the one who brings the biggest container they're going to fill up his container the principle was they were going to fill up whatever you brought no to jewel about it depends on the faith that you are bringing forth he says that all the blessings in the book is yours he said that and he's able everything against it has been struck off glory i may act silly contestable co and abs an abstract deed do you realize what that means do you realize what that means brother there is nothing can take it away nothing can take it away from you amen amen no my mother not my friend but my friend not my brother maybe jealous even god himself the people he cannot take it off basketball don't stop preaching because in his knowledge it says what what what type of title um which says what did i have it says i have now casted cash in on my uh beneficiary oh it says of his death buried dishonorable of his burial end of his resurrection no he became a sinner because you preached that i may become a son amen amen and hold the abstract deed for these signs and and be and hold the abstract deed on the fifth fourth we are all beneficiaries said could come tonight my brother my sister as god promised you something in his word did you see something that belongs to you in this abstract deed that let nothing in the world may stop you from getting that blessing just as easy as the words of jacob will come to pass the word of the lord i don't see for you the benediction the blessings of the lord for you will come to pass certainly if it doesn't come to pass tonight believe that it will come to pass tomorrow if it doesn't come to pass tomorrow you got to believe that it's going to be the next day don't let the enemy make you think on that day oh that you've awaited for so many years it reminds me of one of my friends i loved it very much when i believed the message it was one of the people that really touched me greatly in the message because every time i was with him he would give me a testimony will be paralyzed oh he was always going to talk to me about the word and every time i i'll pray that every time i meet him that i may also have a testimony to tell i came i went to see him so i can bring him back he might regard me from my care he looked at me says brother you know that i know the word it says i i i don't know if there's anything you're gonna tell me that i don't know did you it's it's it's god's fault he says brother you know what i'm saying that when we go to church say come it's like going to the airport these people that come with you yeah they're shocking for yes and there are people they are people that come and there are those that are traveling it says there's something i ask god it's been three years god does not bring it to practice it says i i when i look at the others they pray and god gives them they pray and god gives them they don't consume me then i i i told myself maybe i'm just one of the the the one who's uh the followers one who just come through our company instead of just accompanying people i i i i prefer to stay back so for now let me consider myself as just one that's accompanying the others he didn't understand well myself you are not here just to accomplish you are not here just to to leave the others truly beneficial you are the beneficiaries i told them i said abraham waited 25 years it says i told him noah preached even for 120 years the same ones the same thing waiting until the promise come to pass if he doesn't come to pass today you are not just one who's coming with others there's no blessing in the book that says oh you're just coming with the others he says that you are son of god every promise in the book is mine oh every promise in the book is mine [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] every childhood [Music] is [Music] amen let's just bow heads tonight our gracious father we are so thankful to being in your presence lord your word is food to us all god and father i can certainly say tonight that my soul has been comforted oh god and father we came in and no doubt we're tired from work in different places and but your word has just comforted us once again and father we certainly can say that we came and we ate of the hidden manner oh god and that you open up the windows of
