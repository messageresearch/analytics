[7:12] Oh, amazing

[9:48] to it.

[10:00] would have died.
[10:06] And I shall go away.

[12:51] my fault
[12:53] and
[12:55] I need. We ask brother Manique to come
[12:58] and open up our service in a word of
[13:00] prayer. Psalm
[13:16] [Music]
[13:17] 103 verse 1 and 2 says, "Bless the Lord,
[13:20] oh my soul, and all that is within me,
[13:23] bless his holy name. Bless the Lord oh
[13:26] my soul and forget not all his benefits.
[13:30] Two weeks back uh you know you all know
[13:33] when the rain comes it comes drop by
[13:35] drop but there is sometime it happens
[13:37] the the cloud splits and tons of water
[13:41] comes all at once. Two weeks back, two
[13:45] or three weeks back where my mother is
[13:47] law is is from, two cities wiped out
[13:52] because two clouds split apart instead

[14:09] people lost their lives when we read the
[14:12] scripture
[14:13] And when we thank the Lord for all the
[14:15] benefits, it just reminds us every
[14:18] breath we are taking, it's given by him.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; So let's bow our heads and give thanks.

[24:29] [Music]
[24:45] Each morning he tenderly
[24:49] feeds them,
[24:52] watches them so faithfully.
[24:58] The birds know their heavenly
[25:02] father
[25:05] always supplies every need.
[25:11] On earth they are not worth much value.
[25:18] Still through the darkness they seek.
[25:24] not born false without his permission.
[25:30] It touches the heart of the king.
[25:37] [Music]
[25:39] He sees each
[25:42] tiny
[25:43] sparrow that falls. He hears every time
[25:49] your broken heart calls.
[25:52] No matter how big,
[25:56] no matter how small, he cares about it
[26:02] all.
[26:04] Don't be afraid.
[26:08] Ye, you are more valued than they
[26:21] [Music]
[26:24] left his heavenly father
[26:30] to say I love you this much.
[26:36] His blood bought your eternal pardon.
[26:43] Why is it so hard to trust?
[26:49] He's near the brokenhearted.
[26:52] [Music]
[26:55] And when you can't face one more day,
[27:02] Jesus will carry you through way.
[27:08] Jesus does everything well.
[27:16] He sees each

[33:04] [Applause]
[33:06] [Music]
[33:23] God bless you.
[33:26] [Applause]
[33:38] We have a couple of announcements. We
[33:40] want to remember
[33:42] the children's
[33:45] gathering that's happening. Remember our
[33:48] pastor threatened without threatening to
[33:50] watch your kids that nobody goes towards
[33:52] the maze for the sake of them not
[33:54] participating but participating.
[33:57] Um we want to remember brother Daniel as
[34:00] we mentioned earlier today with the
[34:02] surgery that's coming up.
[34:05] that the Lord be the surgeon in the
[34:06] process. Brother Joel Villa writes,
[34:09] "Please pray for protection during this
[34:12] pregnancy for Mela Alvareo."
[34:16] They had lost the previous two
[34:18] pregnancies.
[34:21] You know, I I don't know about you, but
[34:23] when when a mother asks for something
[34:25] like that,
[34:27] you know, Brother Brandham says it's
[34:29] it's her right to to mother.
[34:32] And I believe God moves on things like
[34:34] that.
[34:36] Regardless of how simple, how big, how
[34:39] small,
[34:40] he cares. And especially when you come
[34:43] in line with his word, he moves on the
[34:46] scene. We'll ask Brother Jay to come and
[34:48] take these before the the church and the
[34:52] brothers who are taking the tithes and
[34:53] offerings. Please come up.
[35:00] inspire
[35:05] our heads.
[35:08] Heavenly Father, these
[35:10] [Music]
[35:12] serious needs have come up before the
[35:15] church, Lord. And
[35:17] Lord, there's no better place to place
[35:19] them than in your hands, Lord. And so we
[35:22] know that you can
[35:24] Lord give victory Lord to
[35:28] the ones that are battling Lord and
[35:29] struggling Lord and
[35:33] Lord through these trials and
[35:35] tribulations Lord.
[35:38] Your prophet said that he just wants to
[35:41] show us Lord that you can have
[35:44] confidence in us Lord.
[35:46] So we lift these up to you, Lord, and
[35:50] just ask that the Holy Spirit would just
[35:53] move upon the
[35:56] the family, Lord, that's
[36:02] Lord, that's having a baby, Lord, and
[36:06] just pray that you'd be their portion,
[36:07] Lord Jesus.
[36:11] Lord, that you'll increase their faith,
[36:13] Lord.
[36:17] Lord, there's nothing like a love of a
[36:20] mother and a father, Lord, to bring
[36:22] forth a child, Lord. And
[36:25] just ask that you would,
[36:28] Lord, make a way, Lord. Lord, for
[36:31] brother Daniel, Lord, and his surgery,
[36:35] Lord, we just ask that,
[36:38] Lord, the surgery would go well. he
[36:41] would come out a a new man, Lord, just
[36:45] knowing that you're the one that healed
[36:48] him, Lord.
[36:50] Lord, that he would have a burning
[36:51] desire, Lord, in his heart to
[36:54] to just be in fellowship, Lord.
[37:00] Lord, we just ask that
[37:02] Lord, you'd meet every need for the the
[37:05] church, Lord, financially, spiritually,
[37:09] Lord, and Lord, for each one that has a
[37:12] need, Lord, that raised their hand or
[37:14] may not have raised their hand, Lord.
[37:15] You know the hearts and desires of each
[37:18] person, Lord.
[37:20] So, we just lift them up to you, Lord
[37:22] Jesus.
[37:24] and ask that you would just meet every
[37:26] need, Lord, for the tithes and the
[37:28] offerings, Lord.
[37:30] We just put them in your hands, Lord,
[37:32] and ask that,
[37:34] Lord, your will would be accomplished
[37:36] with them, Lord.
[37:39] Lord, we just ask you to be in our midst
[37:42] the remainder of this service, Lord, and
[37:44] ask you to have your perfect will and
[37:46] way in each life in Jesus name.
[37:49] Amen.
[37:54] As we sing this song, just
[37:57] if the Lord put somebody on your heart,
[37:59] put a burden on your heart for somebody
[38:01] else. As we sing this, just keep that
[38:04] person on your mind. Set aside your
[38:06] personal requests that you have and
[38:08] think on somebody else. I trust the Lord
[38:12] will answer to your need in due time.
[38:15] He's got it all in control.
[38:21] [Music]
[38:24] He's got it all in control.
[38:31] He put that reassur
[38:36] way down in my soul.
[38:39] Oh,
[38:42] he's got it all in control. I've put my
[38:48] life in his hands.
[38:50] I put my life in his hand.
[38:55] [Music]
[38:59] I put my life in his hand.
[39:06] And so every road I walk down, I'm sure
[39:11] it's in his hand.
[39:15] [Music]
[39:17] I put my life in his hands. My father
[39:22] knows what I need.
[39:24] Oh, my father knows what I need.
[39:33] My father knows what I need.
[39:41] Every year I go through. Oh, he knows
[39:46] what's best for me.
[39:52] My father knows what I He's got it all
[39:56] in control. Oh,
[40:00] he's got it all in control.
[40:08] He's got it all in control.
[40:13] [Music]
[40:15] He put that
[40:17] [Music]
[40:20] great in my soul.
[40:26] [Music]
[40:30] Let's all stand. I want to sing this
[40:33] song. Take me deeper.
[40:36] There is a longing
[40:40] only you can feel
[40:44] [Music]
[40:45] of a raging tempest
[40:48] that only you can steal.
[40:53] My soul this thirsting love to know you
[40:58] as I'm known.
[41:02] spring from the river
[41:05] and that flows before your throne.
[41:11] Take me deeper,
[41:15] deeper in love
[41:17] with you,
[41:20] Jesus. Hold me close in your embrace.
[41:27] Take me deeper. We invite brother Billy
[41:30] at this time. Deeper than I've ever been
[41:34] before.
[41:36] I just want to love you more and more.
[41:40] How I love
[41:42] to be deeper
[41:45] in love.
[41:47] [Music]
[41:50] Sunrise to sunrise.
[41:53] I will seek your face.
[41:58] drawn by the spirit
[42:01] to the promise of your grace.
[42:06] My heart is found in you. A hope that
[42:11] will abide
[42:15] here in your presence
[42:18] and forever satisfied.
[42:20] [Music]
[42:23] Take me deeper,
[42:25] [Music]
[42:27] deeper in love
[42:30] with you.
[42:33] Jesus, hold me close in your

[42:48] I just want to love you more and more.
[42:55] to redeem. Just sing my course one more
[42:58] time. Oh, take me deeper,
[43:03] [Music]
[43:05] deeper in love with you.
[43:10] Jesus, hold me closing away.
[43:16] Oh, take me deeper,
[43:21] deeper in love
[43:24] before.
[43:25] I just want to love you more and more.
[43:30] How I know
[43:32] you
[43:35] are.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[43:39] Gracious Father, we believe that's the
[43:41] promise you've made us.
[43:43] We know that when we come closer to you,
[43:45] Lord, Father, our love for you grows
[43:48] more and more, Lord.
[43:50] Lord, we know one thing that all we
[43:52] desire is to love you with all our
[43:54] hearts, with all our being, with
[43:56] everything that we are. Father, even
[43:58] though we see
[44:01] our inabilities and our imperfection,
[44:04] Father, we know one thing that you
[44:06] promise that just looking upon you,
[44:08] Lord, will bring about the change that
[44:10] we need. There's never been anybody
[44:13] who's come in the presence of the Lord
[44:15] and remain the same. And I believe,
[44:17] Father, even tonight as we come into
[44:19] your presence, Father, that you're
[44:21] working out everything for our good. We
[44:24] want to commit tonight's service
[44:26] remembering those that are on the way.
[44:28] Father, brother Jeff texted me that is
[44:30] not feeling well. Father, I want to lift
[44:31] him up tonight that you may just touch
[44:33] his body and make him well. We commit
[44:36] the service to you and invite you now.
[44:38] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[44:40] pray. Amen.
[44:42] May God bless you. Let's open our
[44:44] Bibles. Certainly good to be gathering
[44:46] the house of God. I know we have people
[44:48] that are on the way maybe from the
[44:49] meetings and so we will uh uh just try
[44:53] to take as much time as we need and not
[44:56] be too long. Uh let's open our Bibles in
[44:59] Revelations chapter 3. How many enjoy
[45:01] the word this morning?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll just try to pick
[45:04] something from what was said this
[45:06] morning and see if we can just say
[45:08] something that will be of help. Uh
[45:11] Revelations chapter 3,
[45:16] a very familiar scripture reading. Let's
[45:19] start from 14. And they said, "And unto
[45:22] the angel of the church of Laudian,
[45:24] write this thing, saith the Amen, the
[45:28] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[45:31] and the beginning of the creation of
[45:33] God. I know thy works. I know thou thou
[45:37] are neither cold nor hot. I would that
[45:40] thou were cold, oh heart." So then,
[45:43] because thou are lukewarm and neither
[45:44] cold or hot, I will spew thee out of my
[45:47] mouth. Because that saith, I'm rich and
[45:50] increase with good, and have need of
[45:52] nothing, and knoweth not that thou are
[45:54] wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
[45:56] blind, and naked. I counsel thee that to
[45:59] buy of me gold, tried and fire, that
[46:03] thou mayest be rich, and the white
[46:06] raignment that thou be me clothed, and
[46:09] the shame of thy nakedness do not
[46:10] appear, and anoint thine eyes with
[46:13] thyself that thou may see. And as as
[46:16] many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be
[46:19] zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold,
[46:22] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[46:25] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[46:28] will come in. I will come into him, and
[46:32] will s with him, and he with me. To him
[46:36] that overcomemeth, I will grant to sit
[46:38] with me in my throne, even as I al also
[46:41] overcame, and am sat down with my father
[46:44] in his throne. He that has a near, let
[46:47] me let him hear what the spirit saith
[46:49] unto the church. Also, if we could
[46:51] quickly before we be seated, turn to
[46:53] James chapter 4. We're going to read
[46:56] verse seven and just seven and eight. It
[46:58] says, "Submit yourself therefore to God.
[47:01] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[47:04] you. Draw nigh unto God and he will draw
[47:08] nigh unto you. Cleanse your hands, ye
[47:11] sinners, and purify your heart, ye
[47:14] double- minded. You may have your seats.
[47:44] Sorry, technology problem. Sorry.
[47:51] So I I trust you enjoy the word this
[47:53] morning and uh
[47:57] you know we can't say enough about
[47:59] Satan's Eden and I just want for a few
[48:01] moment and say overcoming in Satan's uh
[48:05] evil age overcomers in Satan's evil age
[48:10] you know um we we look at the world
[48:13] around us and as we heard this morning
[48:16] in the God of this evil age we
[48:18] understand that Satan more and more that
[48:21] he's uh he has a desire to build his
[48:24] kingdom and he's building his kingdom
[48:27] and um we was fellowshing in brother
[48:30] David's office he just just beautifully
[48:33] laid it out that even from the beginning
[48:36] here's Satan manifesting
[48:38] giving out of his seed and he didn't all
[48:41] of it to be manifested all at once and
[48:44] he was also gifting out little by little
[48:47] so and uh even by their own thinking
[48:50] thinking that they're making something
[48:52] out of something but not understanding
[48:54] that even knowledge is being imparted to
[48:57] them because the scripture will say that
[48:59] in the end time that knowledge shall
[49:01] increase. So even in his within his own
[49:04] kingdom he's dishing out this knowledge
[49:07] to his people and coming up with this
[49:09] creation and Barabanam will use that
[49:12] even as a type but we see that through
[49:15] knowledge and civilization and education
[49:18] that he's completely taken over
[49:21] everything and his goal is to build a
[49:24] better kingdom than Michael that his
[49:26] goal since the beginning is to have
[49:30] everything uh that we see around us
[49:33] everything work towards his goal not
[49:36] god's goal and it's so amazing because
[49:38] when brotherham speaks about the very
[49:41] deception of the devil he goes even as
[49:43] far as saying that he gained access to
[49:45] the name of the lord Jesus and now he's
[49:48] he doesn't mind being worshiping under
[49:51] the name of the lord Jesus people
[49:53] thinking they worshiping Jesus but they
[49:56] worshiping him so he starts out as a
[49:58] stark uh uh uh one that would come and
[50:01] manifest himself. And then he's
[50:04] disguising himself and taking worship
[50:06] that necessarily don't belong to him.
[50:09] Worship that was not directed at him,
[50:11] but he's taking it over by deception.
[50:15] And he comes and he wants to be
[50:17] worshiped just like God. And he wants to
[50:20] be uh uh to be placed above the stars of
[50:23] God and everything. And he wants people
[50:26] thinking that they are worshiping God,
[50:28] those people are worshiping him. He's
[50:30] designed everything in the world to keep
[50:33] us distracted. And and it's amazing even
[50:36] when we especially when we talk about
[50:38] technology. I'll say perhaps in the last
[50:42] 20 years there's been such an
[50:43] acceleration in technology more than
[50:46] ever before. It it seems like today you
[50:49] know something and tomorrow it's
[50:50] obsolete. It it's no longer of any use.
[50:53] Why? Because knowledge keeps growing and
[50:56] and more information. We are subject to
[50:59] so much information. Even our mankind,
[51:02] our human being, just our flesh is not
[51:05] even made to handle that kind of
[51:07] information. the the amount of
[51:09] information that we go through on the
[51:11] daily basis, the amount of pings you get
[51:13] on your phone, the amount of
[51:15] notifications, the amount of uh uh
[51:18] reminders that you put, the amount of
[51:20] scheduling that you put, it's not even
[51:23] it's not even possible for one human
[51:25] being to to just take that in. It's too
[51:28] much. It keeps you distracted at all
[51:31] time. You can't even sit there. We get
[51:33] to where, you know, if you sit there,
[51:35] it's too quiet. It seems like something
[51:37] is going wrong. They because why you
[51:40] live in the world where there's constant
[51:42] noise, constant this one has to happen,
[51:45] this one has to happen, that has to
[51:47] happen. And in all of that, his
[51:49] objective is to keep you away from your
[51:52] true objective, which is to live the
[51:54] life of Christ. Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; So he comes and and he comes as an angel
[51:59] of light because he doesn't he's not
[52:02] showing up with horns and one that wants
[52:04] to hurt you because he will be clearly
[52:07] visible in that form. But the form that
[52:09] he takes is will say some place the form
[52:13] of godliness but yet denying the power
[52:16] thereof. A form of just of a shell. One
[52:19] that can uh uh he doesn't mind if we are
[52:22] Christians. If we gather here, we say we
[52:24] we want to be like God. He doesn't want
[52:26] us to uh participate in in the customs
[52:30] of the church and and the services and
[52:32] everything. But he doesn't want you to
[52:34] come in real contact with the real
[52:37] living God. So he wants you to keep you
[52:39] away from that. He wants to fill your
[52:41] mind with religion. He wants to fill you
[52:43] with theology, the understanding of uh
[52:46] perhaps knowing all the scriptures. And
[52:48] and I was just fellowshipping with a
[52:50] brother and he just done on my heart.
[52:52] Brennan makes a quote. I don't have it
[52:54] here. It says, "We study too much, we do
[52:56] a lot of things too much, but what we
[52:58] need to do is to fail in love with him."
[53:01] If we can only uh set our hearts right
[53:04] and fail in love with him, that will
[53:06] answer to the needs of every day.
[53:09] Because one minute in the presence of
[53:10] the Lord is more than all the studies we
[53:13] can do. One minute in contact with him
[53:16] will change your life forever. Your life
[53:18] will never be the same. It's not by
[53:21] theology. It's not by education, but
[53:23] it's the contact that we need to come.
[53:26] Like we said the other day, you know,
[53:28] Moses heard that how that he was born a
[53:30] proper child. Moses heard that uh from
[53:33] his parents how that he was to deliver
[53:35] Israel and he saw it perhaps when he
[53:38] looked at the children of Israel. He saw
[53:40] the nation of God and all of those
[53:42] things. But one thing that was lacking
[53:44] was Moses had to have the uh to come
[53:47] into the burning bush and meet it God
[53:49] that God for himself. Moses couldn't do
[53:52] it just by the knowledge that he had
[53:54] acquired. Moses needed a personal
[53:56] experience with that God so he could be
[53:59] empowered. In other words, what God was
[54:02] able to do that the the the teaching and
[54:04] the knowledge uh could not do was that
[54:07] God was going to bring the very word
[54:10] that he was hearing into a reality in
[54:13] his own body is in his own flesh in his
[54:15] heart. That word will become such a
[54:18] reality that by revelation he'll be able
[54:21] to walk into pharaohs and Egypt and
[54:24] speak and have no fear. But what he
[54:26] heard from his parents, even though it
[54:28] was good, it kept him in fear because
[54:30] when the Egyptian uh the Egyptians died,
[54:33] he ran away. But when he came in contact
[54:35] with the living God, and all of his
[54:37] questions were answered, there was no
[54:40] fear anymore. And that's what we desire
[54:42] as Christians, not walk in fear. Oh, I'm
[54:45] going to do this wrong or I'm going to
[54:46] fail over here. You know, if you can
[54:49] ever fell in love with him and meet him
[54:51] face to face for yourself, you have no
[54:53] fear because you know he has you in his
[54:56] own hands.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; So he wants us to worship. He's designed
[55:01] this world to keep us distracted and he
[55:03] has designed the world to keep engaged
[55:06] at all time with the things of the world
[55:08] and no time to see God. He's built a
[55:11] kingdom. He wants us to live by the
[55:14] provisions of what is given.
[55:17] Whatever you have need of, I got it.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; I there's things that you you can it's
[55:26] just as much as your imagination.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; You think about it, somebody's made it
[55:31] somewhere.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And and and and think about it. He and
[55:36] the more time goes by, he makes it more
[55:39] easier, a lot beautiful, more
[55:42] attractive, more appealing, and more
[55:45] everything. Why? Because he he doesn't
[55:48] want us to to live by faith. He doesn't
[55:52] want us to engage into the promises of
[55:54] God. He doesn't want he wants you to
[55:57] rely you need you need money, you get a
[55:59] job or guess what the government will
[56:01] give you money for free.
[56:04] Whatever you have need of, he has a way
[56:07] for him to try to provide it for you so
[56:10] you do not depend from the kingdom to
[56:13] which you came from.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; He's built such a kingdom, such a place.
[56:17] And as long as as believers, this is
[56:20] where it becomes very important. As long
[56:22] as as a believer, there's no heartbeat
[56:24] inside of us that desire to see the
[56:27] reality of God. He's got us right where
[56:30] he wants us to be. So what makes us
[56:32] different is regardless of what Satan
[56:35] has to offer out there, regardless of
[56:37] his money and the things out there,
[56:39] everything that he can offer, his
[56:41] medicine, his hospitals, and all of
[56:43] those things, there is something that
[56:45] hungers for more than what we see.
[56:47] There's something that hunger for the
[56:49] reality of the living God. There's
[56:52] something inside of us that wants to see
[56:54] the reality of what was written in the
[56:57] scripture come to pass into our lives.
[56:58] Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; So he builds a better kingdom and that
[57:03] we can rely on it. And he wants us to be
[57:07] continually
[57:08] living without faith because we know the
[57:12] scripture will say that by that only
[57:16] those that uh the scripture will says
[57:18] that it's by faith that you could please
[57:20] God. It's not by intellect but it's by
[57:23] faith. They that cometh must believe
[57:25] that God is and that he's a rewarder of
[57:28] them that diligently seek after him. So
[57:31] he doesn't want us to be partakers of
[57:34] the supernatural because the
[57:36] supernatural cannot come by
[57:38] understanding or by knowledge. The
[57:41] supernatural can only come and be
[57:43] manifested by faith.
[57:48] He He knows that if we can ever get the
[57:51] key of faith, if we can ever receive
[57:54] revelation by the word of God, that we
[57:57] will look at his kingdom and reject it
[58:00] and seek for the things that which come
[58:02] from above. He knows that if we can ever
[58:05] receive the true revelation of the true
[58:08] bride of the end time and what she is
[58:10] and what she's to be manifested that we
[58:13] will become the very invincible army
[58:16] that God pro promised. So therefore he
[58:18] wants us to he wants us to keep us in
[58:21] the lukewarm state. You know we come to
[58:24] church and we hear the word of God and
[58:26] we go out and we want entertainment just
[58:29] like the world wants it. He wants to be
[58:31] one foot in and one foot out. And he
[58:34] wants us to be in such a place where uh
[58:36] uh you know we even though there's a
[58:39] desire for the things of God in our
[58:41] heart just like our pastor said that we
[58:43] also have a place in our hearts or in
[58:46] our minds or or for for the things of
[58:48] the world. You know we want to be the
[58:50] best gamer there is and want to be the
[58:52] best person there is and the best
[58:54] educated person there there is and we
[58:57] want to manifest also those things and
[58:59] everything. Let me say this. It's either
[59:01] you live by the provision of God or by
[59:03] the precision of the devil. God wants us
[59:06] to live by his provision. And living by
[59:09] his provision will provide everything
[59:11] that you have need of.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; You don't got to be the best anything.
[59:15] You just got to be the best Christian
[59:17] that there is. And he will provide. If
[59:20] he needs you to become something, he
[59:22] will make you what he wants you to be.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] He it's a chasing of something that you
[59:30] can never s that can never satisfy you
[59:32] when it's all said and done. You know in
[59:35] technology used to be even in my own
[59:38] discipline it used to be not not few
[59:40] years ago that if you attend certain
[59:42] certification you are the best that they
[59:44] were you know it was like something that
[59:48] was regarded as great and everybody went
[59:50] for it. But today with a rise in AI and
[59:54] all of those things now the the the
[59:56] direction is completely changing. You
[59:59] cannot just be one thing. You need to be
[1:00:00] this this this this like four different
[1:00:03] things combined before you can do be
[1:00:04] anything. So what is it? It doesn't
[1:00:07] matter. And even if you attain it a a
[1:00:10] sum of it is just good for a year.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Then you got to go through the same
[1:00:17] exercise again.
[1:00:21] And and so it it's a it's a process
[1:00:23] that's built to continually lead you on
[1:00:27] and lead you on and lead you on and it's
[1:00:30] almost like you got you on the leash and
[1:00:32] and just quick and just pushing you
[1:00:34] forward and then when you realize you
[1:00:36] come to the end of it, you realize that
[1:00:38] it's all but vanity.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister, the world is
[1:00:43] nothing but vanity. There's nothing out
[1:00:46] there that satisfy. The only thing that
[1:00:48] satisfy is Jesus Christ living in the
[1:00:50] heart of a believer
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; is the true birth by the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:55] One that can come and make you a
[1:00:57] different person. And once he makes you
[1:00:59] a different person, you will never
[1:01:01] hunger for the things of the world.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; It says it would deceive the very elect
[1:01:08] if it were possible. But says that this
[1:01:11] age speaking about this age he say we
[1:01:13] see in this age what we are living in
[1:01:15] it's the greatest of all the ages the
[1:01:18] age of laian church hate is the greatest
[1:01:20] of all the ages and it says because we
[1:01:23] are because it's the ending of time and
[1:01:26] the blending into eternity and then it's
[1:01:29] the greatest sinful age. It's the most
[1:01:32] sinful. It's the most It says it's the
[1:01:35] mo It's the most sin in this age than
[1:01:38] it's ever been. And all power of Satan
[1:01:42] is many times harder to fight against
[1:01:46] than it was in any other age.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; The power of Satan is many more times
[1:01:54] harder to fight in this age than it ever
[1:01:58] was in any other age. Why? Because if
[1:02:02] you can you can perhaps the best way for
[1:02:05] me to just say it is you can look at it
[1:02:07] as as far as the spectrum is concerned.
[1:02:10] The word of God gives you 100%. And
[1:02:13] every variation from the beginning till
[1:02:16] the 100% belongs to the devil.
[1:02:20] If you want to be the ranked sinners, he
[1:02:22] will give it to you. If you want a
[1:02:24] little bit of watered down type
[1:02:26] Christianity, he's got it for you.
[1:02:28] Whatever version of Christianity you you
[1:02:31] want, he's got he's there to satisfy for
[1:02:34] you.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He's there to give it to you so he can
[1:02:37] keep you a peace and so he can uh have
[1:02:40] you where he wants you to be. But I even
[1:02:43] was fellow fishing with the youth group
[1:02:45] on Friday. But but Ram speaks about the
[1:02:47] seed of Abraham. He says that with them
[1:02:50] there is something different. So that
[1:02:52] when they look at the same circumstances
[1:02:55] that you and I look, for some reason
[1:02:57] they they they refuse to accept
[1:03:00] circumstance for the way they are
[1:03:02] presented. It doesn't matter how hard
[1:03:04] the situation look. If you go reading
[1:03:06] the history of the Bible, you find out
[1:03:09] that there was a group of people when
[1:03:11] they showed up at the Red Sea, however
[1:03:13] difficult they looked, they didn't
[1:03:15] believe that that was the end of them.
[1:03:18] There was something in them that
[1:03:19] believed that something could happen.
[1:03:21] Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And and I believe that's what we are
[1:03:25] called to be. Why? Because we are not
[1:03:27] called to live by the provisions of the
[1:03:29] devil. We are called to live by the word
[1:03:32] of God. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And and I'll say this, the challenge uh
[1:03:38] uh uh uh even in this end time if we are
[1:03:41] not careful is we live in a time where
[1:03:43] when we when when one says the word of
[1:03:46] God people often time replace uh the the
[1:03:49] the minds are drawn to the very text or
[1:03:53] the record of the word of God and
[1:03:56] looking at the letter as if it was the
[1:03:58] actual word. This is the letter and the
[1:04:01] record of the word. But the word of God
[1:04:04] is the very person of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ himself.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And let me say this, that's why
[1:04:11] brotherham says we the weapon that's
[1:04:13] been given to the believer is the word
[1:04:16] of God. Adam and Eve were given the word
[1:04:19] of God. The word of God is the most
[1:04:21] powerful thing that there is on the face
[1:04:24] of the earth. Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; And and and and because we we often time
[1:04:29] look to the letter and fail to realize
[1:04:32] that there's the author of the letter.
[1:04:34] There's the author of the record and
[1:04:36] he's the real word of God.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; The scripture will say that in the
[1:04:42] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:04:44] with God and the word was even God. If
[1:04:47] you go back and look but speak and said
[1:04:50] that God was there with his own thoughts
[1:04:53] and everything and then he the word is
[1:04:57] the thought expressed. The word is the
[1:05:00] thoughts expressed. So the word is not
[1:05:03] the thought but it's the thoughts
[1:05:05] expressed. In other word when it moves
[1:05:08] from the thoughts to the word it's got
[1:05:11] everything that he need in order to
[1:05:13] fulfill what it's supposed to do. Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; When God said let her be, he was taking
[1:05:18] her thoughts and by the time it became
[1:05:21] the word, it was the manifested light of
[1:05:24] what the thoughts was.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; So even you look at it, Jesus came, it
[1:05:31] says that he I come from God and I go
[1:05:33] back to God. The prophet tells us that
[1:05:35] the very form when God moved from the
[1:05:38] spirit that he was when he decided to
[1:05:41] take a form, the first form that he took
[1:05:43] was the logos and he calls it the
[1:05:46] creative power of God. So when you have
[1:05:49] the word of God, you have the creative
[1:05:52] power of God himself.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You you don't have the letter, you have
[1:05:57] the creative power. whatever. In other
[1:05:59] words, when he speaks it, when it
[1:06:01] becomes the word, when it is the word,
[1:06:04] it's the creative force that would bring
[1:06:07] that which you have need of.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; When it's the word, it's finished. It's
[1:06:12] not the beginning. It's the finished.
[1:06:14] But said it may take a hundred years, a
[1:06:17] million years, however long it takes,
[1:06:19] but if he had already spoken it, it's as
[1:06:22] good as finished. So, when we have the
[1:06:24] word of God, we have the finished
[1:06:26] product.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God will not go back and
[1:06:30] change his word when he already spoke
[1:06:32] it. It's got to come to happen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; We We have turned it into some type of
[1:06:42] understanding.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; It's the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:46] Christ. Oh, I love this. And I probably
[1:06:49] won't have time to read it, but he
[1:06:51] speaks. It says God in the beginning it
[1:06:54] would come in
[1:06:56] and he would he says the spirit it will
[1:06:59] hover over his own seed and the prophet
[1:07:02] Jo say he would brood over over it as if
[1:07:05] it was as a chicken will brood over his
[1:07:08] own seed. The word will brood over his
[1:07:12] own seed until that which was spoken
[1:07:15] that which was in seed form will become
[1:07:18] manifested. So it's not a different
[1:07:21] person. So when God speaks, he himself,
[1:07:24] the spirit that spoke the word will
[1:07:27] hover over his own word to bring it to
[1:07:30] pass. All that we need to do is to
[1:07:33] believe the word, trust the one who
[1:07:35] spoke it, and let him do the brooding
[1:07:37] until it comes to pass.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:43] The the challenge is when we have the
[1:07:45] word separated from the spirit, then we
[1:07:48] feel like we need some other spirits
[1:07:50] from some other place to come and make
[1:07:52] the word to come a reality. When it's
[1:07:54] the same same exact person that spoke
[1:07:57] the word, that bruise over the word to
[1:08:00] come to pass.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; So he comes and he bruise over his own
[1:08:05] word. But says until one came that was
[1:08:08] in his very own image. So I was thinking
[1:08:11] about this even in terms of what we
[1:08:14] spoke about I believe a week or two ago
[1:08:16] about uh Michelangelo here it was he was
[1:08:20] the only one who had received the
[1:08:23] inspiration about how that statue was
[1:08:26] supposed to be.
[1:08:28] It wasn't another great artist. There
[1:08:31] was only one artist who was given and he
[1:08:35] had the responsibility
[1:08:37] in shaping this uh uh marble and
[1:08:40] bringing out the image which was
[1:08:43] supposed to come out of. But when says
[1:08:45] oh he worked night and days and for
[1:08:48] years he said perhaps it will go and
[1:08:50] while he's sleeping and he realized oh
[1:08:53] that part doesn't supposed to be is not
[1:08:54] supposed to be. It says they express
[1:08:57] about in the nature of an artist how
[1:09:00] that they are uh uh uh perhaps very uh
[1:09:04] picky about what they do. They want it
[1:09:06] to be exactly the way they want it to be
[1:09:09] that it's not that within the very
[1:09:12] nature that it was created with. He
[1:09:14] cannot just look at something and say oh
[1:09:16] that's fine it will do. No he wanted it
[1:09:18] to match the vision that he had
[1:09:21] received. He wanted it to match the
[1:09:23] perfect vision and inspiration that he
[1:09:26] had received. Why? Because the the when
[1:09:29] he got the inspiration, he wanted what
[1:09:32] we he was building to come alive even to
[1:09:34] himself. But says he built it to such a
[1:09:38] place that he was able to look at it and
[1:09:41] smite it and say speak. Why? Because at
[1:09:44] that particular moment what was a vision
[1:09:47] became a reality. My brother and my
[1:09:48] sister. Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And let me say this, there's coming a
[1:09:51] time where this word of God will move
[1:09:54] from a vision into a reality.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; We we had one who had a vision of what
[1:10:01] the bride's supposed to look like.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; We We're not just walking, you know,
[1:10:07] sparingly and just trying to figure out
[1:10:10] what is this message going to produce.
[1:10:12] No, we know what it's supposed to
[1:10:14] produce.
[1:10:17] We we know and we've been given the
[1:10:20] accurate description of what we are
[1:10:23] supposed to see. And what we need is to
[1:10:25] stand before the message to eat it day
[1:10:28] and night to eat it at every moment and
[1:10:31] let it shape us into the
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; image that God wants us to bring.
[1:10:45] Banana will say in the message God gives
[1:10:48] all always find its place. Paragraph 73
[1:10:53] says
[1:10:55] the whole creation was lost.
[1:10:58] We just went through it
[1:11:00] in the seven seals. It said see the
[1:11:03] whole creation was lost. Everything was
[1:11:07] gone.
[1:11:08] It was all gone to Satan.
[1:11:12] He felt heir of it and he still owns it.
[1:11:16] He certainly does. That's the reason we
[1:11:20] are fighting and having a lot of
[1:11:22] trouble.
[1:11:24] He controls every kingdom. Satan does.
[1:11:28] Every government, every king, every
[1:11:31] kingdom controlled by Satan.
[1:11:35] The whole world is controlled and run by
[1:11:39] Satan. That's the reason we have a lot
[1:11:42] of trouble that we have. Any Bible
[1:11:45] student or anything can tell you that
[1:11:48] Satan well the Bible itself says says it
[1:11:52] here says he did it. It says he did. See
[1:11:57] that he controls the world but Christ
[1:12:01] will fail. It says, "But Christ will
[1:12:04] fall heir to it for now. He is our our
[1:12:08] redeemer and he comes to redeem the
[1:12:11] whole creation and nothing could do it
[1:12:14] but God himself."
[1:12:16] That's the reason it says that's the
[1:12:18] reason it says that's the reason that
[1:12:20] God doesn't do uh doesn't does nothing
[1:12:24] outside of a man. He always works
[1:12:28] through man because he had to use a man.
[1:12:33] Let me say this. God is not working with
[1:12:36] the world as a whole.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; It's not interested. That belongs to
[1:12:41] Satan. He's not even working with the
[1:12:44] churches. Oh, I'm going to work with
[1:12:46] churches. No, the word of the Lord is to
[1:12:49] the individual.
[1:12:52] God is looking for a man, a woman who
[1:12:56] will believe the entire word of God. We
[1:12:58] just read in revelation but one of them
[1:13:00] says that Christ himself was kicked out
[1:13:03] of his own church. He was put on the
[1:13:05] outside and it says for he that will
[1:13:08] hear my voice he because he was kicked
[1:13:11] out Christ became to look for the
[1:13:13] individual who will receive the word.
[1:13:16] That's why even when we come to church,
[1:13:18] it's not a a matter of us receiving it
[1:13:21] as a whole, but it's a matter of each
[1:13:23] one of us coming in contact with what's
[1:13:26] being said and making sure that it's
[1:13:28] talking to something in inside of you.
[1:13:31] Making sure that the word is speaking
[1:13:33] and connecting to something that's
[1:13:35] inside of you. He's not interested in
[1:13:38] groups. He's interested in individuals
[1:13:41] who can receive and make contact with
[1:13:44] that word that's been spoken.
[1:13:46] And I want to say this because we live
[1:13:49] in the time where if we're not careful,
[1:13:51] people go and they they they go to
[1:13:53] church and they they they they pay their
[1:13:56] tithes and they do all of those things
[1:13:58] and they find comfort in doing that
[1:14:01] rather than in making contact with the
[1:14:03] word itself.
[1:14:06] God wants us to make contact with the
[1:14:09] word. He doesn't want us to hide behind
[1:14:12] religion or behind the customs of the
[1:14:14] church and all of those things. He want
[1:14:17] each one as an individual to come in
[1:14:19] contact with that word and know the word
[1:14:22] for himself. That's why we must be born
[1:14:25] again. To be born again uh often time is
[1:14:28] taken uh you know we we look at it as oh
[1:14:31] I must be born again. I it it is because
[1:14:34] the mind that's in you is not the mind
[1:14:37] that's made for you to receive the word.
[1:14:39] The mind that's in you as a human will
[1:14:42] re will reason the word of God every
[1:14:45] time. But when you are born again, that
[1:14:47] reasoning is taken out of you. What you
[1:14:50] have inside of you is a faith that
[1:14:52] believes even when it doesn't make any
[1:14:54] sense, it believes it.
[1:14:59] He He wants us to be a separated people.
[1:15:05] He He But says he God made us to be
[1:15:09] oddballs.
[1:15:13] Yeah, we are you we spend all of our
[1:15:16] lives
[1:15:17] wondering why could I not fit? What's
[1:15:21] wrong with me? We we try to learn new
[1:15:24] habits so that we could just fit.
[1:15:27] We do all kinds of things trying to fit
[1:15:29] in and not knowing that we were created
[1:15:34] the way we were created the way with our
[1:15:37] our taste, our likes and our dislike. We
[1:15:40] were created for one goal and one goal
[1:15:43] only so that God will use you where he
[1:15:47] needs you to be.
[1:15:50] We we completely failed to understand
[1:15:53] that we were made oddballs because God
[1:15:57] had a plan for our lives. He had a plan.
[1:16:00] He elected us and he chosen us. He He
[1:16:04] wanted us to be gathered for his own
[1:16:07] name's sake so he can use us for what he
[1:16:10] wants to use us. And yet we are all of
[1:16:13] our lives fighting that.
[1:16:19] Wanting to fit like everybody else,
[1:16:22] wanting to do everything like everybody
[1:16:24] else, and wanting to be liked by
[1:16:26] everybody, wanting to be appreciated by
[1:16:28] everybody. God don't want you to be
[1:16:30] appreciated.
[1:16:31] If they don't appreciate you, that's
[1:16:33] fine. If he appreciates you, that's all
[1:16:35] that matters.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; The problem with religion today, we we
[1:16:40] we all Christians, right? You know,
[1:16:43] everybody's a Christian.
[1:16:45] No, God don't want us that to be that
[1:16:47] kind of Christian. He wants us to be a
[1:16:50] different kind of a Christian according
[1:16:52] to his own election.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; But Bam says the masterpiece was
[1:16:58] rejected.
[1:17:00] It was despised. It there was no beauty
[1:17:03] in it that there may be desire. But
[1:17:06] guess what? We we we are building a
[1:17:09] Christianity where we want everybody to
[1:17:11] like us.
[1:17:14] If they don't like me, oh, I must not be
[1:17:16] a good Christian. I was telling the
[1:17:18] young people, I said, if somebody said
[1:17:20] they don't like you, just rejoice.
[1:17:21] Praise God. I must be crazy. That's why
[1:17:24] they don't like me.
[1:17:28] He didn't make you to fit. He created
[1:17:30] you to stand out. He created you to be
[1:17:33] that way. So only him can satisfy that.
[1:17:37] So when he takes you and he places you
[1:17:39] where he wants you, that you will act
[1:17:42] exactly that way. And it will fit a
[1:17:44] purpose that even you yourself has no
[1:17:47] understanding.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But Bam says
[1:17:57] in identifying masterpiece he says let
[1:18:00] us turn uh let us turn now our thoughts
[1:18:04] from Michelangelo.
[1:18:06] It says to the great sculptor God
[1:18:08] himself, God Almighty, who in the
[1:18:11] beginning, before there was a day,
[1:18:14] before there was a dawn, it says for
[1:18:17] before there was a dawn, for there an an
[1:18:20] atom or a molecule, God in his mind had
[1:18:24] man what a man should look like, what a
[1:18:27] man should be, and what a man should act
[1:18:30] like. I love that. Everything about us,
[1:18:33] the way we would look, the way we would
[1:18:35] act everywhere, everything about us was
[1:18:39] written about us by God himself. And he
[1:18:42] wanted to make that man to be part of
[1:18:45] him. So he made him in his own image, in
[1:18:48] his own likeness. God created man. And
[1:18:51] he says, "Oh, when God in the beginning
[1:18:54] made man, he says this masterpiece
[1:18:58] something that reflected his thoughts,
[1:19:05] not reflected the thoughts of man, but
[1:19:08] reflected God thoughts."
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; You don't got to be a Christian
[1:19:16] according to somebody's understanding.
[1:19:18] You got to be a Christian according to
[1:19:20] God's understanding.
[1:19:23] Our desire is each one of us to reflect
[1:19:26] God's thoughts, not the human thought,
[1:19:29] not even our own understanding. We come
[1:19:31] to a place, let me say this, in this age
[1:19:34] that we are living in, it's so dangerous
[1:19:37] because there's so many imitation
[1:19:39] everywhere.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; There's so many imitations everywhere.
[1:19:45] You look across the net, everybody wants
[1:19:47] to be like everybody else.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Uh uh people, oh, you know, people study
[1:19:54] what is it that I need to do so people
[1:19:56] can like me. People fake being sick so
[1:19:59] people can like them.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; People do all kinds of things and so
[1:20:06] they can become famous for popularity,
[1:20:09] for for for likes, and for for for
[1:20:12] thumbs up, and for all of those things.
[1:20:14] That's the people are looking for
[1:20:16] attention. But let me say this, the only
[1:20:18] attention we need is to get in contact
[1:20:20] with him.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Because if we get in contact with him,
[1:20:24] then it'll all be settled.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[1:20:32] there's only one way. There's only one
[1:20:35] form of eternal life. and even our name
[1:20:38] and our thoughts. It it says our and our
[1:20:41] name and our thoughts
[1:20:44] were with God before the foundation of
[1:20:46] the world because now we possess eternal
[1:20:50] life
[1:20:52] and to be that we have to be part of
[1:20:55] God. Though we've had to be as much
[1:21:01] as it is taught because we have eternal
[1:21:04] life was predestinated to life and our
[1:21:08] names were put in the lamb's book of
[1:21:09] life before the foundation of the world
[1:21:12] according to revelation. Now that God
[1:21:15] had us in his thinking then we have
[1:21:18] eternal life because then he spoke us.
[1:21:21] We came into existence and a word is
[1:21:25] just a thought manifested. God had us in
[1:21:29] the beginning in his thoughts.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. That's how and that's
[1:21:38] the reason why you are going to
[1:21:40] overcome.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; It is not because of how many
[1:21:47] prayers, works and anything. It's
[1:21:50] because we are here as his thoughts
[1:21:54] being manifested.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the word spoke it. The word
[1:21:59] will bring it to come to pass. Why?
[1:22:01] Because God taught it. The prophet spoke
[1:22:04] it. It's going to come to pass. Why?
[1:22:06] Because he who started the work will
[1:22:09] finish it. Why? Because he placed it
[1:22:11] within your heart tonight to be a son
[1:22:14] and a daughter to him. And there's
[1:22:16] nothing that can stop that from
[1:22:18] happening.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Let me say that. It wouldn't help how
[1:22:26] much enthusiasm we had if that what it
[1:22:29] was not written.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And let me even say this. We wouldn't
[1:22:33] even know what deception is.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know what truth is.
[1:22:40] What what is truth and what is
[1:22:41] deception? It took a prophet to come and
[1:22:44] reveal the word of God in the end time.
[1:22:46] It took God to open our eyes. It took
[1:22:49] God to bless the seed in our heart. It
[1:22:52] took God to bring us to church. It took
[1:22:54] God to transform us. Everything about us
[1:22:57] is God doing the work.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; The problem about it is we feel like we
[1:23:03] can change somebody else.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; We can't. Only God can change him. If
[1:23:08] God change you, that same God can change
[1:23:11] somebody else. That's why we rejoice in
[1:23:13] because we know I have been changed and
[1:23:16] I'm in contact with that God and I know
[1:23:18] that God can do the same for you. That's
[1:23:21] what the gospel is.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It's not that we've come to a place
[1:23:27] where God started the work. Now we say
[1:23:31] it's time for me to take over.
[1:23:34] Let me continue my own transformation.
[1:23:40] It's always God
[1:23:43] through the individual, through the
[1:23:45] work, through everything. It's God using
[1:23:49] men to speak. It's God laying hands on
[1:23:52] people. It's God. What is it? If we look
[1:23:55] at it through the lenses of God, then
[1:23:57] we'll understand the program. If we look
[1:24:00] at it through the program of men, we'll
[1:24:02] fail to see what is it that is trying to
[1:24:05] achieve.
[1:24:07] If the musician could come,
[1:24:13] it says
[1:24:15] in the uncertain sound, it says
[1:24:17] paragraph uncertain sound, paragraph 34,
[1:24:20] it said man in the beginning when he was
[1:24:23] made,
[1:24:26] a man is a god.
[1:24:31] Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Just so I could give you some
[1:24:36] background, we were talking with the
[1:24:37] young people about there was one one of
[1:24:40] our youth here it asked me it says he
[1:24:43] had a question about the uh godhead the
[1:24:47] deity of the Lord Jesus. He said, "Why
[1:24:50] is it that Jesus was praying to God?"
[1:24:52] And you know, "What's the difference
[1:24:53] between?" And it just stayed on my heart
[1:24:56] for such a long time. And and I was just
[1:24:59] I I know I could give a simple answer,
[1:25:01] but for some reason, I just went and I
[1:25:04] was studying on it. You know, I could
[1:25:06] have just responded. It took time and
[1:25:08] everything. And when it was all said and
[1:25:10] done, I understood the reason for
[1:25:13] understanding the the the deity of God
[1:25:16] was because it was our own
[1:25:18] identification.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Straight and simple.
[1:25:25] Because if you don't understand the
[1:25:28] identification of God, you will not
[1:25:30] understand your own identification.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; But Ram says, "Go to a Jew and try to
[1:25:36] feed him that there's three gods. Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; It won't happen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; There's only one God.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And we are offspring of that one God.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; How? By his word.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; He created us. He made us what we are.
[1:25:55] It's by the word. The creative force of
[1:25:58] God. He made us what we are. So we begin
[1:26:01] to show that it was God in heaven. But
[1:26:04] yet says he would have been unjust to to
[1:26:08] send his son someone outside of himself
[1:26:11] to come to die for the sin that we
[1:26:13] committed. If he wanted to p put to
[1:26:16] pardon us, he himself was going to come.
[1:26:18] So God became a man.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; God became a man and he died the death
[1:26:23] on the cross. And he said that he took
[1:26:26] our place so we can take his place.
[1:26:29] Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; A son of God, a son is the reflection,
[1:26:35] is the nature of the father being pour
[1:26:38] into another vessel. It's the same God.
[1:26:41] It wasn't a different God. It's the
[1:26:43] same. And why is it important that we
[1:26:45] understand? Because you tonight that are
[1:26:47] sitting here, you are the God
[1:26:50] manifested.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; It's the same one changing forms. It's
[1:26:57] the same one coming. The one who came in
[1:27:00] the form of God above us. The one who
[1:27:02] came in the form of the Holy Spirit over
[1:27:04] the church ages. The one who came and he
[1:27:07] came in the form of a man God. The
[1:27:09] fullness of God dwelling in the human
[1:27:11] body. The same one promised that I have
[1:27:14] to go so that I am where I am you may be
[1:27:16] also. What was he talking about? It's
[1:27:19] not about some physical location. He was
[1:27:21] taking you back to the word.
[1:27:26] Why was Melisedc supposed to come?
[1:27:29] Melkisedc, what was the representation
[1:27:31] of Melkisedc? Melazedc was the word form
[1:27:35] that that accomplish and fulfill every
[1:27:39] word of God. So when he stood before
[1:27:41] Abraham, when he was speaking to
[1:27:43] Abraham, it wasn't just some thought
[1:27:46] form. It was actually the one who
[1:27:49] promised, who made the promise. He was
[1:27:51] the one who was going to fulfill the
[1:27:52] promise. That's why he looked at him and
[1:27:55] says next year at this same time you
[1:27:57] shall have a child. Why? Because he was
[1:27:59] the creative power of God. And brother
[1:28:02] Benam says the same as Abraham saw him.
[1:28:05] The children of Abraham must come with
[1:28:07] that same identification meet that same
[1:28:10] one
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; not a different God. The same one who
[1:28:14] made the promise
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; suited an generation. And he spoke the
[1:28:18] word. He says I'm going to have a bride.
[1:28:21] And that's why we're gathering here.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with our feelings.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel like you are a
[1:28:30] Christian or you feel like you are a
[1:28:33] sinner, it doesn't matter tonight.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Religion is not about your feeling. It's
[1:28:40] about what's already been spoken.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; You believe it, it happens. You don't
[1:28:48] believe it, you struggle with it.
[1:29:00] And he's absolutely
[1:29:03] a god.
[1:29:05] For he was made in the image of God,
[1:29:09] being a son of God. Then he's an heir of
[1:29:13] all that God is.
[1:29:18] I
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; I love this. There's no variance.
[1:29:22] There's no well is a god but is a lesser
[1:29:25] god. You you know this is what we do to
[1:29:28] ourselves, right? Oh, I'm a god but I'm
[1:29:30] not that kind of god. What kind of god
[1:29:33] are you?
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; You know we we we start watering down
[1:29:40] our own identification.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; There's only one god and you are inade
[1:29:46] form of that one god. There's no two
[1:29:48] god. There's only one. And the spirit
[1:29:51] that was in Jesus is the same spirit
[1:29:53] that came on you. The scripture says the
[1:29:56] spirit that rose him from the dead, if
[1:29:58] it dwells in you, it shall also quicken
[1:30:01] your mortal body. Do not water it down.
[1:30:04] Take it for what it is. If it's too hot,
[1:30:07] believe it. It will come to pass.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Let the one who promise make it come to
[1:30:13] pass into your life. It's not for you to
[1:30:15] understand or explain it. It's for him
[1:30:17] to bring the manifestation.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Then he said
[1:30:29] Jesus was the first born among many
[1:30:32] brethren.
[1:30:35] So really the godhead
[1:30:39] is only a lineage where we really come
[1:30:42] from. It's not about understanding about
[1:30:44] some god that sits up high in the throne
[1:30:48] that we got to go and figure out how do
[1:30:50] I even worship him. It's the
[1:30:52] identification that you are worshiping
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; the one that you came from.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; You are one with him. You cannot worship
[1:31:02] something that you can identify with.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; He's made you in his own image. You are
[1:31:08] part of him and you and him are one. In
[1:31:10] fact, he's not complete without you.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; If he was, why would he give his life?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; He gave his life because you are part of
[1:31:25] him.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; The same way that Adam gave his life for
[1:31:29] Eve, that same God gave his life for
[1:31:31] you. Why? That he may make you an
[1:31:33] overcomer in Satan's hidden.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this.
[1:31:39] God will wait until there is so much sin
[1:31:43] in the world. Until the world is in a
[1:31:46] place where you look, you said this
[1:31:48] cannot work. Almost like it was said,
[1:31:51] can anything come out of Nazareth?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; He comes to such a place. He waits for
[1:31:57] such a time. He waits for such iniquity.
[1:32:00] He comes back and say the reason why you
[1:32:03] can overcome is because you are a god to
[1:32:06] begin with. Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; You are made in my own image. I never
[1:32:10] fail. There's not a promise that I've
[1:32:12] ever made that's come not come to pass.
[1:32:15] Has he ever failed? Has he ever said
[1:32:17] anything that's never come to pass? He
[1:32:19] said because I am that and you are part
[1:32:21] of me. The same thing is going to happen
[1:32:23] with you.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, but our humanity, your humanity
[1:32:30] means nothing to him.
[1:32:34] your human errors and human problem. You
[1:32:37] might as well take that and put it in
[1:32:39] the trash.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because
[1:32:45] he knew it.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; He knew that you will come from the
[1:32:51] place that you came from.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; He knew that you will come from the
[1:32:55] parents that you came from. He knew all
[1:32:57] about the challenges. He knew the
[1:33:00] question tonight. Do you believe what he
[1:33:02] said or not?
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; The question is not where you came from,
[1:33:06] what you did, how much your cup of sin
[1:33:08] is, all of that you have done. It has
[1:33:11] nothing to do with it. All he has is do
[1:33:14] you believe my promise? Do you believe
[1:33:16] what I've called you? Do you believe
[1:33:18] what I've made you? If you believe it,
[1:33:20] then it's a finished work.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[1:33:28] It says being a son and heir of it all.
[1:33:31] And then it says a man was given a
[1:33:33] domain and do the domain was the earth.
[1:33:37] He has all the power over the fish and
[1:33:39] over the fowls. He had everything all
[1:33:41] over. He could just speak and everything
[1:33:44] will obey him because he was a god
[1:33:46] within himself. Not universal god but
[1:33:51] god means god the the god of heaven and
[1:33:55] earth. But he was a rule in his domain.
[1:33:58] He was a king ruler. It says that that
[1:34:01] that was man. It says and even now he in
[1:34:05] his fallen state now he still has the
[1:34:09] appearance.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; How much more when you become redeemed?
[1:34:18] When you realize that I have been
[1:34:20] redeemed. I have been restored.
[1:34:23] You know the challenge with us is often
[1:34:25] time we think power is to go and raise
[1:34:28] the dead and and and just go and speak
[1:34:31] everything. No power brings you under
[1:34:34] subjection.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Power comes when you have real power,
[1:34:38] you have humility with it. When you have
[1:34:41] real power, you care about what God
[1:34:43] wants to be done with his word. When you
[1:34:45] have real power, he imparts to you a
[1:34:48] character that you understand what to do
[1:34:51] with the word when it's necessary.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[1:35:00] Our gracious father,
[1:35:06] Lord, what you have done for us,
[1:35:11] even if we take all the volumes of all
[1:35:14] the books that we know and rewrite new
[1:35:16] ones, Father, it will not be sufficient.
[1:35:22] Our desire tonight, Lord, is
[1:35:25] that you may just enkindle that fire
[1:35:27] within our hearts,
[1:35:31] Lord, that we may recognize
[1:35:34] the power and the things that you have
[1:35:36] done to get us out of this Satan's Eden.
[1:35:39] And Lord, we are in the world, but we
[1:35:42] are not of the world.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are made to be different.
[1:35:51] that we may rely on that which is what
[1:35:54] you said and overcome the challenges of
[1:35:56] every day. Father, not to be tossed
[1:35:59] through and fro, not to feel forsaken,
[1:36:04] not to feel like we have nothing. Yet,
[1:36:07] you've taken your glory. You've taken
[1:36:09] everything that you were. And Father,
[1:36:12] you desired to place it in your church
[1:36:14] that they will become the very
[1:36:16] representation of who you are. I pray
[1:36:18] tonight Lord no doubt we've fallen short
[1:36:22] and but I pray tonight father may you
[1:36:24] just come and restore us by your word
[1:36:27] Lord that we may be empowered by the ver
[1:36:29] the only thing that has the power of
[1:36:31] transformation
[1:36:33] which is your word that we may know
[1:36:36] without any doubt with assurance that
[1:36:40] father you have done the work and we are
[1:36:43] only here to manifest it lead us oh God
[1:36:46] and father I pray for each uplifted hand
[1:36:49] and those that are home in various
[1:36:52] places. Father, I pray just the same way
[1:36:56] we know that the devil couldn't defeat
[1:36:58] you that the devil cannot defeat us. Not
[1:37:02] because of our flesh and our minds, but
[1:37:04] because it's the same word being
[1:37:07] manifested in us that overcame him. I
[1:37:10] pray that you lead us, oh God. Amen.
[1:37:12] Father, let your Holy Spirit hover over
[1:37:15] the word that lives in us that it may
[1:37:18] bring us into the completeness of power
[1:37:21] and joy that we may live the life that
[1:37:24] you want us to live. Forgive our
[1:37:26] shortcoming one again. And Lord, we
[1:37:28] commit everything we are. And we ask all
[1:37:30] of these things in the lovely name of
[1:37:32] the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[1:37:38] Oh, hide me
[1:37:42] now
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] under
[1:37:47] your
[1:37:48] wings.
[1:37:51] Oh, and come home.
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:58] Oh, and
[1:38:00] your mighty
[1:38:05] when the ocean
[1:38:10] roar.
[1:38:12] I will soar with you above
[1:38:16] the storm.
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:19] Father, you are king over
[1:38:23] the flood.
[1:38:26] I will
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:31] go.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was a masterpiece
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; right there.
[1:38:38] You know,
[1:38:40] here we are,
[1:38:42] the sons and daughters of God. Our
[1:38:45] father owns the cattle on a thousand
[1:38:49] hill.
[1:38:52] He's put the pen in our hand
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; and we won't write the check.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And Satan's just a bluff.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; He's just a bluff.
[1:39:09] and and he's got us so beat down with so
[1:39:13] many complexes
[1:39:15] and everything that you know I'm not
[1:39:18] worthy to lay my hands on the sick.
[1:39:20] Never was,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; never will be.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; But he told me to.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Son, you go lay your hands on
[1:39:31] that sick person. They'll get well." in
[1:39:34] Mexico City. The prophet of God was
[1:39:36] there and somebody girl is going over
[1:39:39] crazy over there and he said, "I'll just
[1:39:41] send one of these ministers over." God
[1:39:43] said, "Son, you go down there
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; and lay your hands."
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; You know, and and
[1:39:52] Satan does such a trickery
[1:39:54] because we have we're born in sin and
[1:39:56] shaped in iniquity. He uses our flesh
[1:39:59] against us.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; But that's what he said. I'd overcome
[1:40:05] and we can we can have victory over
[1:40:08] everything. We are the sons and
[1:40:11] daughters of God. Christ the mystery of
[1:40:13] God revealed. He was our kinsman
[1:40:16] redeemer.
[1:40:18] And and you know you never can be like
[1:40:20] Christ. You never be with Christ in the
[1:40:22] flesh.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; But you can be like Christ through his
[1:40:26] spirit.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:40:29] You can ask and you'll have what you ask
[1:40:31] for if you believe what he said.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I I just think we're that
[1:40:38] when we can start grasping this, we're
[1:40:40] we're we're we're starting to go
[1:40:42] forward.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the word of God right
[1:40:45] there. We go forward by what he said.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; I thought that was just wonderful. In
[1:40:52] fact, I'm going to go listen to it again
[1:40:55] and and uh I'm going to steal all those
[1:40:58] notes and preach it in in Zambia
[1:41:02] because that's what we want the people
[1:41:04] to know.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; We we don't have classes,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; you know. We don't have economic groups
[1:41:12] and and and education groups and we're
[1:41:16] all his children.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; That's what's so beautiful. We're always
[1:41:21] children. Amen. I I just really enjoyed
[1:41:24] that. Uh I'd like to sing that song
[1:41:27] because I just thought when Billy
[1:41:29] probably came on my heart, there's two
[1:41:31] roads
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; that we can travel.
[1:41:36] That's what's put before you. You know,
[1:41:38] you can take the road of doubt and
[1:41:40] failure and and complex
[1:41:44] or you can leave that which is behind
[1:41:46] behind
[1:41:49] and you can go by faith.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And oh church, that's what pleases God
[1:41:56] when you accept that you're a son and
[1:41:59] daughter.
[1:42:01] Every time I I hear something like that,
[1:42:03] my mind just goes back to that prodal
[1:42:05] son.
[1:42:07] What a wreck
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; that guy was.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; He had squandered all of his inheritance
[1:42:15] with riotous living.
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:21] And he looked up and he thought, "Well,
[1:42:23] you know something? In my father's
[1:42:25] house, the servants are living better
[1:42:28] than I live."
[1:42:31] So he decided, you know what? I think
[1:42:33] I'm starving here. I'm living with the
[1:42:36] pigs.
[1:42:39] I guess I'll just go home to my father's
[1:42:41] house. And when he got to his father's
[1:42:43] house, what did he find out? He found
[1:42:46] out he was a son,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; not a servant.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And nothing could ever take his sunship
[1:42:54] away because it came from the father
[1:42:57] himself. And nothing can take your
[1:42:59] sunship or daughtership
[1:43:02] away from you because it came from God.
[1:43:05] All he's trying to do is by the word of
[1:43:07] God is bring you to the revelation of
[1:43:11] that and that somehow in your heart
[1:43:15] you'll choose
[1:43:18] your elected predestinated being to be
[1:43:21] the one that rules your life and not the
[1:43:24] deception
[1:43:26] and the lie. And I think if we keep
[1:43:28] hearing preaching like this, I think
[1:43:30] we'll we'll come to that place. So,
[1:43:33] choose tonight. What road do you want to
[1:43:35] go down? There's two roads that you can
[1:43:37] take. One by sight
[1:43:42] or one by faith. Lord, help my unbelief.
[1:43:47] Oh, there are two roads
[1:43:52] may take
[1:43:56] one by side
[1:44:00] and one by
[1:44:04] take the word of God
[1:44:08] for what you see.
[1:44:12] What you believe
[1:44:16] is what will be.
[1:44:20] Set your wings
[1:44:24] through the wings of faith.
[1:44:28] You can fly
[1:44:32] in a high.
[1:44:36] Do not struggle.
[1:44:41] It's by grace.
[1:44:45] Send your wings
[1:44:48] to the wind of
[1:44:53] watch.
[1:44:57] Watch your
[1:45:02] mountain.
[1:45:09] Speak the word of God
[1:45:13] and I am.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like this.
[1:45:21] for you
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:29] to waste
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:46] my praise.
[1:45:50] Send your wings
[1:45:53] to the wings of
[1:45:59] me
[1:46:02] in the sky.
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:06] He does not
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:14] for the power
[1:46:18] that makes him fly.
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's already here. Praise
[1:46:28] God.
[1:46:30] Oh, set your wings
[1:46:34] to the wind of me.
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:51] It's by grace.
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm wondering if tonight there's
[1:47:03] somebody that maybe has something that
[1:47:06] is a struggle or a a conflict or that
[1:47:10] you're battling and the spirit of faith
[1:47:12] is here and you'd want the church to
[1:47:16] pray with you and you're going to walk
[1:47:18] up and you're going to take that thing
[1:47:20] and you're going to say that we're going
[1:47:22] to fly above it.
[1:47:26] Do you believe you can do that?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] ain't going to stop me.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Is there we just want to say if there's
[1:47:45] something that you desiring for
[1:47:48] something, you want God to do something,
[1:47:50] something in your heart and you want to
[1:47:52] you want to take that right to the
[1:47:53] throne and say, "I'm battling." You
[1:47:56] don't have to tell anybody what it is,
[1:47:58] but if you want, you can touch the hem
[1:48:00] of his garment tonight.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; We don't want to let the opportunity
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; go by. You don't want to carry it with
[1:48:08] you. You're tired of carrying it. You're
[1:48:10] tired of packing it. You're tired of it
[1:48:13] just being a burden to you. You say,
[1:48:15] "Lord, I want to go in a different
[1:48:18] direction. I want something in a
[1:48:20] different path." We'd be happy to pray
[1:48:22] for you. If you want to be prayed for,
[1:48:24] you can just raise your hand right where
[1:48:26] you are. But don't let faith
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; pass you by. Claim your sunship.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Claim your position.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I I I can have my
[1:48:39] relationship restored with my family. I
[1:48:43] can have these things that are right. I
[1:48:47] know they're right. I know that's the
[1:48:48] way it's supposed to be. I I can possess
[1:48:51] that gate of that enemy. I can claim
[1:48:54] that promise. I can believe it.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to claim my sunship.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:49:05] with God, you don't have to wait for
[1:49:07] someone to die to claim your
[1:49:10] inheritance.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; You're join
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; right now.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All that he had and all that
[1:49:19] he was, he poured into the church.
[1:49:24] Just think of it. You can claim that
[1:49:26] right now. It's yours. You own it.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; It's just up to you to say, "I'm going
[1:49:31] to accept my position in Christ. I'm
[1:49:35] going to believe what he said about me."
[1:49:37] Yeah.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Did you know in perfect faith the
[1:49:40] prophet of God said that Jesus believed
[1:49:44] what the scripture
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; said about him?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And that was the key to perfect faith.
[1:49:50] Tonight you heard right from the word of
[1:49:52] God straight read to you from the mouths
[1:49:55] of the prophets through his minister
[1:49:58] exactly
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; what God identified in Jesus Christ.
[1:50:03] Christ the mystery of God revealed that
[1:50:06] he was a son because you were sons
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; and daughters and it took a son for a
[1:50:13] son.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; That's what we do.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; If you want to step back into your
[1:50:22] sunship, step back into your position,
[1:50:26] step back in. And if you know you're on
[1:50:28] the outside of it and you know if you
[1:50:30] know you're not living, you just know
[1:50:32] that all that's being said you're not a
[1:50:34] part of, you can stand right where you
[1:50:36] are and say, "Father, I want to enter
[1:50:38] into that world. I want to enter into
[1:50:41] knowing who I am. I want to I want to
[1:50:44] come in. I want your spirit.
[1:50:47] I want your Holy Spirit to come and
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; and place me, Father, back in the
[1:50:54] position of my inheritance.
[1:50:57] that I can do the work that you
[1:50:59] predestinated
[1:51:01] me to do.
[1:51:03] If you want to be prayed for, you can.
[1:51:04] But let's just pray. And you just
[1:51:07] purpose in your heart. You watch God
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; answer your prayer. You say, "How do you
[1:51:12] know that?" Because that's what he said.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "All ye that come unto me and
[1:51:17] know wise will I turn you away."
[1:51:20] That's his word.
[1:51:22] And if you come on that basis, God will
[1:51:26] honor you. Let us pray. A gracious
[1:51:30] father,
[1:51:36] the flesh wars against the spirit,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; and the spirit against the flesh. And
[1:51:41] these two are contrary one to another,
[1:51:45] Father. And we know that the carnal mind
[1:51:48] is emnity with God.
[1:51:51] and the flesh and the carnal mind
[1:51:54] buckled together is such an overpowering
[1:51:58] force.
[1:52:00] But father, the inner ma man coupled
[1:52:03] with faith
[1:52:06] tells us that he who is in us is greater
[1:52:08] than he who is in the world
[1:52:11] and that all things are possible.
[1:52:14] And father, that's what we're desiring
[1:52:17] for our path forward is that we can step
[1:52:20] into the position that you have so spoke
[1:52:23] of us. That our adoption would come into
[1:52:27] its fullness,
[1:52:29] Father, and that we could without doubt
[1:52:32] or fear exercise the authority that
[1:52:36] you've given us in your word
[1:52:40] because we are
[1:52:42] your children. Yes,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart,
[1:52:48] heavenly father,
[1:52:50] and I ask now, father, as our hands are
[1:52:54] lifted,
[1:52:56] our spirits have been moved by the word
[1:52:59] of God.
[1:53:02] We've heard
[1:53:05] that we were in your thinking.
[1:53:10] Why would you tell us it if it was not
[1:53:12] true?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; You said, "I go to prepare a place for
[1:53:17] you. If it were not true, I would not
[1:53:21] tell you.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; And there's one thing you can't do,
[1:53:25] Father, and that's lie because you are
[1:53:27] truth. You can't pervert what you are
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; and you're the way, the truth, the life.
[1:53:35] And father,
[1:53:38] we believe what you said,
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; and Lord, we may not be what we want to
[1:53:43] we be. We may not be what we ought to
[1:53:46] be, Father. But we know we're going to
[1:53:48] be what you want us to be.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And we're going to hang on to that
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; this evening. So, Father, every heart
[1:53:57] that wanted more faith tonight, every
[1:54:00] heart that wanted to be able to take the
[1:54:03] promises of God, the sword of God in his
[1:54:06] hand, and wield it against the enemy,
[1:54:09] not only in their own lives, but in
[1:54:11] other people's lives. Father, we ask
[1:54:14] that you'd enkindle that divine
[1:54:17] revelation in our heart that we come
[1:54:20] from God and we go to God. Man, the
[1:54:23] works that I do shall you do also
[1:54:26] because I go unto the father and I'll
[1:54:29] not leave you comfortless but I personal
[1:54:32] pronoun will come again that where I am
[1:54:36] you may be also oh father sons and
[1:54:40] daughters of God in every walk of life
[1:54:44] you have people here from every walk of
[1:54:46] life father so you can be shining lights
[1:54:49] in every walk of life every conditions,
[1:54:53] every ways and levels of society. You've
[1:54:59] got real children
[1:55:02] shining the light to this lost and dying
[1:55:05] generation. We thank you, Father.
[1:55:08] Tonight, we ask you to enkindle the fire
[1:55:11] of God in our heart. We ask it in Jesus'
[1:55:15] name. Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad to be
[1:55:20] a son and daughter of God?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing for our dismissal song.
