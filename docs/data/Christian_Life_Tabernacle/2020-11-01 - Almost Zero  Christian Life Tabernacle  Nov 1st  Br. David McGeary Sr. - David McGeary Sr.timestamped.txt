[21:20] God bless you happy to be Gather in his
[21:23] presence we're going to invite brother
[21:24] Mike for our ssal reading this morning
[21:26] amen God bless you
[21:44] good morning we're going to read out of
[21:46] Psalm 31 this morning you know and Psalm
[21:49] 31
[21:51] is um it's all about David being uh
[21:56] finding that place of rest finding that
[21:58] refuge in his presence when surrounded
[22:02] by all of the pressures and all of the
[22:04] storms and all of the all of the
[22:06] concerns of life you know I was really
[22:09] just reading it the other day and uh
[22:13] specific verse stuck out to me in in
[22:15] chapter 31 it was in uh Psalm
[22:19] 31:19 and it's toward the end after he's
[22:21] been doing battle with all of these
[22:23] external
[22:25] pressures he says oh how great is thy
[22:27] goodness
[22:28] which thou Hast laid up for them that
[22:30] fear thee which thou Hast wrought for
[22:34] them that trust in thee before the sons
[22:36] of
[22:37] men Thou shalt hide them in the secret
[22:40] of thy presence from the pride of man
[22:44] Thou shalt keep them secretly in a
[22:46] pavilion that's right from The Strife of
[22:48] tongues you know and that verse stuck
[22:50] out to me because we're in a we're in a
[22:53] significant time for this
[22:56] country you know for the last several
[22:59] months we have
[23:00] been surrounded by the voices of the
[23:03] sons of men shouting in the pride of man
[23:08] you know how using the tumult of tongues
[23:12] about how they have something to trust
[23:15] and they have a message that we need to
[23:17] listen to and they have a voice and
[23:20] every bit of it is nothing but the pride
[23:22] of man from the sons of man and what
[23:24] sticks out to me in verse 19 19 is how
[23:30] that you know it it it says that uh it
[23:34] talks about a people that trust in him
[23:37] before they put their trust in any of
[23:40] the sons of men you know there's a
[23:43] promise that he will hide them in the
[23:46] secret of his presence away from the
[23:50] pride of man that's all this is is the
[23:53] pride of man you know and that he will
[23:56] keep them secretly in a pavilion ion
[23:58] from The Strife of tongues doesn't
[24:01] matter whose message wins it doesn't
[24:03] matter whose voice wins it doesn't
[24:05] matter which man which son of man and
[24:08] the pride of man they think is going to
[24:10] win this thing at the end of the day
[24:12] nothing changes a thing for those that
[24:15] put their trust in him because they are
[24:17] hidden in the Pavilion the secret place
[24:20] of his presence and as I was looking at
[24:22] that the scripture came to my mind from
[24:23] Exodus
[24:24] 33 of a time where Moses was
[24:28] fellowshipping with the Lord and the
[24:30] Lord told him my presence shall go with
[24:33] thee and I will give thee rest yes and
[24:37] down in verse 21 it says and the Lord
[24:39] said behold there is a place by me and
[24:43] thou shalt stand upon a rock that's
[24:45] right and it shall come to pass when my
[24:47] Glory passeth by yes that I will put
[24:50] thee in a cliff of The Rock and will
[24:53] cover thee with my hand while I pass by
[24:57] and it was is there in that secret place
[25:00] that he witnessed the presence of the
[25:02] Lord that's right you know so I'm
[25:05] encouraged by that promise and in the
[25:08] beginning of Psalm 31 as David begins to
[25:10] speak he cries out to the Lord he says
[25:12] Lord be thou my rock my secret place my
[25:17] Dwelling Place hidden away in your
[25:20] presence so to this morning I'd like to
[25:22] read Psalm 31 and let's just be
[25:24] encouraged to trust in him that he may
[25:27] hi Us in the secret of his
[25:30] presence Psalm 31 in thee O Lord do I
[25:35] put my trust let me never be ashamed
[25:38] deliver me in thy righteousness bow down
[25:42] thine ear to me Deliver Me speedily be
[25:45] thou my strong Rock for in House of
[25:48] Defense to save me for thou art my rock
[25:52] and my Fortress therefore for thy name's
[25:55] sake lead me and guide me pull me out of
[25:58] the net that they have laid privy for me
[26:01] for thou art my strength into thine hand
[26:05] I commit my spirit thou Hast redeemed me
[26:08] oh Lord God of truth I have hated them
[26:12] that regard lying vanities but I trust
[26:15] in the Lord I will be glad and rejoice
[26:18] in thy mercy for thou Hast considered my
[26:21] trouble thou Hast known my soul in
[26:24] adversities and has not shut me up into
[26:27] the hand of the enemy thou has set my
[26:30] feet in a large room have mercy upon me
[26:33] oh lord for I am in trouble mine eye is
[26:37] consumed with grief yay my soul and my
[26:40] belly for my life is spent with grief
[26:43] and my years with sighing my strength
[26:46] fath because of mine iniquity and my
[26:49] bones are consumed I was a reproach
[26:52] among all mine enemies but especially
[26:54] among my neighbors and a fear to my
[26:57] acquaint
[26:58] they that did see me without fled from
[27:01] me I am forgotten as a dead man out of
[27:04] mind I am like a broken vessel for I
[27:08] have heard the slander of many fear was
[27:11] on every side while they took counsel
[27:13] together against me they devised to take
[27:16] away my life but I trusted in thee oh
[27:19] Lord I said Thou Art my God my times are
[27:23] in thy hand deliver me from the hand of
[27:26] mine enemies and from them that
[27:28] persecute me make thy face to shine upon
[27:32] thy servant save me for thy Mercy's sake
[27:35] let me not be ashamed oh lord for I have
[27:38] called upon thee let the wicked be
[27:41] ashamed and let them be silent in the
[27:43] grave let the lying lips be put to
[27:46] silence which speak Grievous things
[27:49] proudly and contemptuously against the
[27:51] righteous oh how great is thy goodness
[27:55] which thou has laid up for them that
[27:57] fear thee
[27:58] which thou Hast wrought for them that
[28:00] trust in thee before the sons of men
[28:03] Thou shalt hide them in the secret of
[28:05] thy presence from the pride of man Thou
[28:08] shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion

[53:49] to help us walk through this great hour
[53:53] Lord that we're living in we just trust
[53:55] if your blessing in your leadership in
[53:58] jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless
[54:02] you you may be seated this morning and
[54:05] just for a moment it will kind of uh
[54:08] give
[54:09] everybody an update on sort of what's uh
[54:14] transpired so a couple weeks ago you
[54:18] know that uh um I got a
[54:21] report that some people uh Within our
[54:25] body had uh tested
[54:29] positive and not knowing who they were
[54:33] or uh what the condition was we decided
[54:39] to go ahead
[54:41] and uh stop our uh coming together for a
[54:46] couple weeks so we could find out if
[54:49] there was any spreading if there was any
[54:52] uh uh uh you know how sick people were
[54:58] and so we found out that there hasn't
[55:01] seemed to be any more cases of and the
[55:05] people that have had it have had just
[55:09] like flu like symptoms they get aches
[55:11] and body pains for a couple days uh and
[55:15] then uh they're tired for a few days and
[55:18] then it's not long that they're back
[55:22] normal and that it's just something
[55:24] that's just just going to have to
[55:26] cycle and uh uh we know there's hundreds
[55:31] of thousands of people that have this uh
[55:37] virus we know that some people have died
[55:40] from it mostly elderly people that have
[55:44] pre-existing conditions most of the
[55:47] deaths have been in nursing homes where
[55:50] people were were being taken care of
[55:53] because they were rather the real young
[55:55] people get sick they get over it and
[55:58] they go on and uh so you can't stay shut
[56:02] down
[56:02] forever you know what I mean so uh so
[56:07] that's what why that we've started to uh
[56:11] uh go back to normal so we put some
[56:15] precautions in place this week and uh
[56:19] we'll see what how that develops and
[56:22] we'll start lifting them and moving
[56:24] forward and getting back to normal to
[56:26] where all our seats can be filled up
[56:28] again and we can have extra aisles and
[56:32] we can move all the pews back in here
[56:34] and we can be just as cramped and
[56:37] crowded as we used to be I I know
[56:40] everybody kind of likes the uh likes the
[56:45] space but we're trying to create space
[56:48] so uh we did send an email out to you
[56:51] and we noticed in the email that uh
[56:54] because our service numbers are down and
[56:57] our attendance is down just remember
[57:00] that our expenses keep going forward so
[57:02] we need all of us to help uh together so
[57:06] don't don't think that out of sight out
[57:09] of mind okay so uh and so of course next
[57:14] week I expect there to be more people
[57:16] back here than this morning but it's
[57:19] nice to preach to you this morning it's
[57:21] better in the four people I preached to
[57:23] last Sunday so
[57:25] uh we're grateful for that um I want
[57:29] this
[57:31] morning um to listen to 23 minutes of a
[57:36] message called the
[57:39] countdown and if I was to title my
[57:41] sermon this morning I would call it
[57:44] almost
[57:46] zero almost
[57:48] zero and there's a principle I I think
[57:52] the the important thing as believe
[57:55] belies uh in the word of God and we know
[58:00] this morning that there's churches all
[58:03] over on every corner and everybody has a
[58:10] interpretation of the scripture what
[58:13] they feel the scripture means what parts
[58:16] of the scripture that they feel is
[58:19] important and Every
[58:22] Man compared to man
[58:25] would have a right to his
[58:27] interpretation so I couldn't look at
[58:30] another man and say my interpretation
[58:33] right your in interpretation wrong
[58:37] because what makes us
[58:39] different right I'm a man reading it and
[58:42] making my interpretation and the other
[58:45] gentleman is a man reading it making his
[58:48] interpretation and therefore all of our
[58:51] interpretations would be equal and of
[58:55] course then I would go out and I would
[58:57] share what I feel my interpretation is
[59:00] and how and I would assemble people
[59:02] together and we would get together and
[59:05] we would all agree that this is the
[59:07] right interpretation and we'd start a
[59:10] church and then we'd get other churches
[59:13] and other churches and it's all
[59:15] man-made but there comes a time where
[59:18] God inserts
[59:21] himself into the
[59:23] picture
[59:25] and God always inserts himself in the
[59:28] picture by sending a
[59:32] messenger that's how God's always done
[59:34] it in the Old Testament that's how he
[59:37] does it in the church ages he sends a
[59:41] message so God comes in and now he is
[59:45] now going to provide the correct
[59:49] interpretation of the word of God well
[59:52] what would separate him from all the
[59:55] other men that had the
[59:58] interpretation of the Gospel what would
[1:00:01] separate him what would make him
[1:00:03] different that he would have to be
[1:00:07] Vindicated there would have to be a
[1:00:09] certain sign a certain uh Ministry that
[1:00:14] came from above to to vindicate this
[1:00:18] Messer that he was the messenger that
[1:00:22] had the correct interpretation ation of
[1:00:25] the word of God and the correct
[1:00:28] interpretation never forms a
[1:00:31] denomination or a system it deals with
[1:00:35] individuals in their own personal life
[1:00:39] living the word of God as they're being
[1:00:43] led of the spirit of
[1:00:46] God so I I feel as you know I believe
[1:00:50] that God did send a messenger that he
[1:00:53] did intervene in the lives of the
[1:00:55] Gentile Church send a prophet messenger
[1:00:59] with the signs and wonders the same
[1:01:01] signs and wonders that were worked in
[1:01:04] the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:06] were worked again in this day so the
[1:01:09] Gentiles would been able to see the same
[1:01:12] sign that the Jews saw and then God in
[1:01:16] this great Justice uh promised the
[1:01:20] Gentiles a messiah Prophet that would
[1:01:23] come as son of man Ministry God veiled
[1:01:27] in flesh doing signs and wonders and
[1:01:30] that was the son of God to the Gentile
[1:01:33] church since there's only one son of God
[1:01:36] he raised up a redeemed Prophet Redeemed
[1:01:39] by the blood of the lamb and work those
[1:01:42] same signs in his ministry as a veil so
[1:01:46] it was the Lord Jesus doing the work
[1:01:50] through a prophet to the Gentile age the
[1:01:54] that they too would have the true word
[1:01:56] of God how many believe Jesus had the
[1:01:58] true interpretation of the book of of
[1:02:02] the Old Testament that's right he says
[1:02:04] I've not come to do away with the LA
[1:02:06] I've come to fulfill it every jot and
[1:02:09] every tit is fulfilled in my Ministry
[1:02:11] I'm the complete fulfillment of
[1:02:14] everything that was spoken and then we
[1:02:16] have that same promise the Gentiles do
[1:02:19] that we would have the interpretation of
[1:02:22] the New Testament revealed to us in our
[1:02:25] day Vindicated by signs and wonders now
[1:02:31] the world may not see that but I can't
[1:02:33] help it I've seen it amen and I believe
[1:02:36] it now this morning I want to read
[1:02:39] something to you
[1:02:41] and it's a a paragraph here and and it's
[1:02:46] the foundation of what that we want to
[1:02:49] listen
[1:02:51] to okay so so and listen to this very
[1:02:55] carefully you'll hear it when we play
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:58] tape all these natural
[1:03:03] things all these natural
[1:03:07] happenings now let me read it this again
[1:03:11] all these natural happenings now they
[1:03:16] forerun
[1:03:17] spiritual
[1:03:20] happenings each
[1:03:22] happening a
[1:03:27] accomplishes now each happening
[1:03:31] accompanies the other
[1:03:33] happening only it improves
[1:03:37] it now I just want to um not I know I'm
[1:03:42] not a good reader but I I'll I'll go it
[1:03:44] again and just express to you all these
[1:03:49] natural
[1:03:51] happenings now they are
[1:03:55] for they
[1:03:57] forerun
[1:03:58] spiritual
[1:04:00] happenings each happening accompanies
[1:04:04] the other
[1:04:05] happening only it improves it so we know
[1:04:11] that all this that's happening now this
[1:04:15] thing with the virus this thing with the
[1:04:18] worldwide pandemic the thing with the uh
[1:04:24] uh the politics these things with these
[1:04:28] different social movements and and uh uh
[1:04:33] uh riding in some places and and uh
[1:04:38] unemployment in others and and and all
[1:04:42] the turmoil the borderers shut down
[1:04:44] traveling shut down uh people in fear uh
[1:04:50] sickness having people pass away all
[1:04:53] those all the those happenings H are are
[1:04:57] just forerunning that there's a
[1:04:59] spiritual
[1:05:01] happening so all these happenings and
[1:05:04] what they do is they accompany one
[1:05:08] another but they only improve
[1:05:11] it so there in all what's going on there
[1:05:16] is a
[1:05:18] carnal
[1:05:20] achievement that is trying to be
[1:05:23] achieved by all these things that are
[1:05:27] transpiring okay there's something that
[1:05:30] is going to come out of it right you
[1:05:33] know whether we're all driving electric
[1:05:35] cars uh you know what I mean or or you
[1:05:39] know whether we wear face masks for the
[1:05:42] rest of our lives or end up walking
[1:05:44] around in bodysuits you know what I mean
[1:05:48] I don't know there's something that's
[1:05:49] being achieved something is changing
[1:05:53] something is trans transpiring that's
[1:05:55] causing
[1:05:56] changes
[1:05:58] and and also along with that there are
[1:06:03] spiritual happenings and spiritual
[1:06:06] changes so God is using what's going on
[1:06:10] to accomplish something and to achieve
[1:06:14] something what is transpiring did not
[1:06:17] sneak in on the
[1:06:19] Lord you know what I mean he wasn't
[1:06:22] caught by surprise
[1:06:25] you know uh he told us man would fool
[1:06:28] around with the test tubes and they
[1:06:30] would look up and they would just turn
[1:06:33] their heads back down and they would
[1:06:35] keep fooling with those test tubes and
[1:06:37] what would come out of it was death and
[1:06:40] destruction and
[1:06:42] sickness that's I I don't know what to
[1:06:45] tell you I don't know what it takes to
[1:06:50] stir us up when we see so many many uh
[1:06:55] things that have been
[1:06:57] prophesied to our generation coming to
[1:07:02] pass how about how about the car that
[1:07:05] drives
[1:07:07] itself I mean this wasn't thought of in
[1:07:12] 1970 or that 1940
[1:07:18] something seeing a car that drives
[1:07:21] itself and we've got them we've actually
[1:07:24] have them what what what day does the
[1:07:28] light go on what time do we shake
[1:07:33] ourselves out of our complacency what
[1:07:37] time do we realize that the world is
[1:07:40] going and it's going in a direction and
[1:07:43] it's making changes and there's a
[1:07:46] kingdom and there's a God of this evil
[1:07:49] age and there's a Satan's Eden that that
[1:07:52] this great this great uh uh Lucifer is
[1:07:58] trying to build and then God has an
[1:08:01] achievement when could when we sit back
[1:08:03] and say okay the natural things that are
[1:08:07] transpiring only are companions to the
[1:08:12] spiritual things that are transpiring so
[1:08:15] something spiritual is going on for the
[1:08:19] believer there's something that's
[1:08:22] transpiring
[1:08:24] spiritually that go that God is trying
[1:08:27] to achieve something that he's trying to
[1:08:30] bring us to some place he's trying to
[1:08:32] get us to something he's trying to
[1:08:35] accomplish and so we want to look past
[1:08:39] what's
[1:08:40] transpiring on the
[1:08:43] outside and we want to find out what's
[1:08:46] happening in the
[1:08:49] spiritual and there's and so uh in these
[1:08:52] few moments I just we just like you to
[1:08:55] listen as he tries to express to us to
[1:09:00] look at the natural look at how it's
[1:09:02] come up look how it's transpired look
[1:09:05] how it's been going over the church ages
[1:09:08] and over the time and and so what what
[1:09:11] are we coming to we're coming to
[1:09:14] something yes that's what I want to get
[1:09:17] in tune with I want to get in tune with
[1:09:19] what are we coming to what is the
[1:09:21] achievement that God's trying to achieve
[1:09:24] what what is it that he's trying to get
[1:09:26] us to there's there's a great purpose of
[1:09:30] it and let me just read this he says but
[1:09:32] God in the spiritual achievement is
[1:09:36] going forward not going backward he's
[1:09:40] going forward looking into the word and
[1:09:44] believing the promise for the things
[1:09:48] that never has come
[1:09:52] yet amen oh my I'm telling
[1:09:57] you I know this is terrible I mean I've

[1:11:12] can find out if it was uh preached uh in
[1:11:19] Bakersfield
[1:11:21] California uh uh at the fairgrounds
[1:11:23] there in Bakersfield in
[1:11:27] 1964 let us read the scripture found in
[1:11:30] Hebrews the 11th
[1:11:37] chapter and just remember the quat for
[1:11:40] things that never has come yet now Faith
[1:11:46] is the substance of things hoped
[1:11:49] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:11:54] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:11:57] report through faith we understand that
[1:12:01] the worlds were framed by the word of
[1:12:06] God so that things which are seen were
[1:12:10] made of things which do not appear our
[1:12:15] gracious father we ask you to bless your
[1:12:17] word in your precious name we pray
[1:12:21] amen amen things that are seen were not
[1:12:26] he said by faith so that the things
[1:12:29] which are seen were not made of the
[1:12:32] things which do appear in other words
[1:12:36] something is being made by what's going
[1:12:39] on now and that's what you want to make
[1:12:42] sure you get out of what God is
[1:12:44] spiritually creating by the events that
[1:12:48] are
[1:12:49] transpiring now God bless you you may be
[1:12:52] seated as we pick up uh these next 23
[1:12:55] minutes Lord bless
[1:13:12] you practically to every nation of the
[1:13:14] heavens I've seen all kinds of gods and
[1:13:16] all kinds of religions but there's none
[1:13:18] of it true but Christianity it's the
[1:13:20] only one even nature itself it speaks
[1:13:23] for Christianity God the Creator look
[1:13:25] there is life death Buel Resurrection
[1:13:30] Resurrection the you can't go outside
[1:13:33] without seeing it watch the leaves come
[1:13:35] on in the spring watch them get to their
[1:13:37] youth in their old and their middle age
[1:13:39] and then their old age and the veins and
[1:13:41] the leaves packing the life few minutes
[1:13:44] you find out it isn't long before any
[1:13:46] Frost Falls or anything them leaves drop
[1:13:48] off and what happens the life that's in
[1:13:50] that tree that sap goes down into the
[1:13:53] Roots if it didn't the winter coal would
[1:13:55] kill the tree kill the life it can't
[1:13:58] stay up it's got to go down and bury
[1:13:59] itself but in the spring of the Year
[1:14:01] here comes back with a new Leaf again
[1:14:03] it's testifying there is a life a death
[1:14:07] a burial a resurrection everything
[1:14:10] tighten we just can't get from it watch
[1:14:13] the sun when it's Rises of a morning the
[1:14:16] Sun that lights the skies it's a little
[1:14:18] baby rocked in its mother's arms when
[1:14:21] it's weak not very much light not very
[1:14:24] strong then about 8:00 it starts off to
[1:14:26] school at 11:30 she's graduated and it's
[1:14:29] out of high school and out of college
[1:14:31] then she's in her strength from about 12
[1:14:34] till about 2: then she begins to get
[1:14:36] weak weaker weaker weaker and finally
[1:14:38] she gets real weak like an old man or a
[1:14:40] woman goes down is that the end of it
[1:14:43] she comes back the next morning you
[1:14:45] testify there is a resurrection and a
[1:14:46] life beyond death everything testified
[1:14:50] all nature testifies the word testifies
[1:14:53] to to it the very Spirit itself that's
[1:14:55] in our heart testifies to it something
[1:14:57] within us calling out that there is a
[1:15:00] resurrection of the dead so you see to
[1:15:03] say if everything serves God's purpose
[1:15:06] it's got a resurrection but it can only
[1:15:08] rise if it serves God's purpose if a
[1:15:10] flower lives and is not
[1:15:20] deratization but you can can't keep
[1:15:23] anything in the ground that serves God's
[1:15:26] purpose it comes forth again to testify
[1:15:28] of the Resurrection we know that all
[1:15:30] these things are right there are
[1:15:32] testimonies to us to encourage us each
[1:15:35] day everywhere you look you see God
[1:15:37] there is a natural body of people there
[1:15:40] is a spiritual body of people there is a
[1:15:44] natural bride I've had the privilege of
[1:15:46] marrying fine young couples I never
[1:15:49] think of it unless I uh kind of turn
[1:15:52] them around little superstitions and I
[1:15:55] face with my back to the East and them
[1:15:57] looking to the East and as I look at
[1:16:00] them I think of their hearts beating is
[1:16:01] one Christ and his bride there is a
[1:16:05] natural bride and but if there is a
[1:16:07] natural bride it's only a testimony
[1:16:09] there is a spiritual bride there is a
[1:16:12] spiritual bride because there is a
[1:16:13] natural bride all these natural
[1:16:16] happenings now they forerun spiritual
[1:16:20] happenings each happening
[1:16:23] accompanies the other happening only it
[1:16:26] improves it you say what's like that
[1:16:29] well something like a spiritual life
[1:16:31] when it comes into the natural life it
[1:16:34] improves the natural life it it makes
[1:16:36] you in a better condition than you was
[1:16:38] in the natural life when the leaf is
[1:16:40] getting old and dies when it comes back
[1:16:42] with the life again in the resurrection
[1:16:44] to testify in another year it comes back
[1:16:46] in a better condition than it did when
[1:16:48] it went down see everything testifies of
[1:16:52] these things
[1:16:54] now let's take for instance the
[1:16:55] achievement that man has been uh able to
[1:16:58] do on Earth in all of these natural
[1:17:02] achievements now if I want your
[1:17:04] undivided attention now the all the
[1:17:07] natural achievements uh happened in the
[1:17:10] Earth has been forerunners of spiritual
[1:17:13] achievements that God has done by his
[1:17:16] church all the Natural Things Are type
[1:17:18] of the spiritual things now you say how
[1:17:21] is that let's take for one
[1:17:24] Transportation first the transportation
[1:17:26] was by horse the next it was by
[1:17:29] automobile then science build us an
[1:17:32] airplane and but you see it is uh first
[1:17:37] was one horsepower the car was maybe 20
[1:17:40] horsepower the airplane goes up to
[1:17:42] hundreds of horsepower see what it is
[1:17:44] it's just as we come on with the horse
[1:17:47] then an automobile was made then the
[1:17:50] next thing was an airplane we just keep
[1:17:52] achieving on higher and higher going
[1:17:54] greater and greater this is the
[1:17:57] achievement of science this is a
[1:18:01] forerunner of the spiritual things
[1:18:03] that's happened of God by his Spirit has
[1:18:07] been in his promised word the natural
[1:18:10] Man by the knowledge looks backward for
[1:18:13] his achievement that's scienceall see to
[1:18:17] what God has done in a farmer creation
[1:18:20] they go out and pick up clouds and get
[1:18:22] pieces of rocks and fossils and and
[1:18:24] elements and ties them together see on
[1:18:27] that achievement they are taking what
[1:18:30] God has
[1:18:31] done and perverting it from its original
[1:18:34] estate and making his living quarters
[1:18:37] and so forth and his economy a little
[1:18:40] better by what has been created that's
[1:18:43] in the natural achievement by man but
[1:18:46] God in the spiritual achievement is
[1:18:49] going farward not going backward he's
[1:18:52] going farward
[1:18:53] looking into the word and believing the
[1:18:56] promises for things that never has come
[1:18:58] yet for the spiritual Revelations to
[1:19:02] manifest the spiritual things that God
[1:19:05] has promised he sees them come to pass
[1:19:08] just as the scientist in his laboratory
[1:19:10] are working on different things to help
[1:19:12] man take in
[1:19:14] creation the spiritual man is looking
[1:19:17] forward to something that God promised
[1:19:19] that has never yet been
[1:19:21] created the natural man looks backward
[1:19:24] the spiritual man looks forward that's
[1:19:26] the way they got got that in the church
[1:19:29] the natural church member looks back
[1:19:31] says what finny sanki KNX Calvin that
[1:19:33] was all right but that was their date
[1:19:35] we're looking forward for something else
[1:19:38] a promise that's greater than higher and
[1:19:40] what God has promised science goes back
[1:19:43] to pick it up we go forward in the word
[1:19:46] of the Lord to find what God has
[1:19:48] achieved in these two things one forerun
[1:19:51] the other or typ
[1:19:53] now as science has been able to achieve
[1:19:57] more horow as he did by taking the power
[1:20:01] and making greater instruments OS and
[1:20:04] airplanes God has achieved from the same
[1:20:08] manner as each one of those tipe now
[1:20:10] watch way back in the days of Luther
[1:20:14] their power was horse power and then God
[1:20:18] by getting Luther in his hands
[1:20:21] controlled out of a great organization
[1:20:24] or system he let the man see that the
[1:20:27] just shall live by faith and when he was
[1:20:31] able to achieve justification and preach
[1:20:34] it the church come to life it come to
[1:20:38] life it begin to move just a little bit
[1:20:40] back ear the days of the Hors Powers
[1:20:43] when horow was about ready to fade out
[1:20:46] of the carriage and horse and buggy now
[1:20:50] he achieved justification and through do
[1:20:53] that then the church received Life by
[1:20:56] Believing on Jesus Christ not taking
[1:20:58] some you say I believe the church I
[1:21:00] believe this to believe him is life
[1:21:03] justified by faith Luther preached it
[1:21:07] that was tiped by the har and buggy days
[1:21:10] then he got a man in England by the name
[1:21:13] of John Wesley under his control to take
[1:21:16] out all the isms away from him and he
[1:21:19] was able by John Wesley to bring into
[1:21:22] the church
[1:21:24] sanctification sanctification raised a
[1:21:26] church to its feet and got it able to
[1:21:28] walk now at the end of Wesley's age was
[1:21:31] the automobile we realized the when into
[1:21:33] the Wesley church I mean not see Ever
[1:21:35] every reformer comes at the end of the
[1:21:37] age now we find out that Wesley in last
[1:21:41] of his church age it come in just before
[1:21:43] the Pentecostals well we see that the
[1:21:46] church got strength enough through
[1:21:48] sanctification to walk away from the
[1:21:50] things of the world sanctifying means
[1:21:53] separate for the glory of God it too bad
[1:21:56] it lost that but it got strength enough
[1:22:00] Luther give it life back in the horse
[1:22:02] and buggy day Wesley got it on its feet
[1:22:05] to walk and sanctification separating
[1:22:07] from the things of the world through
[1:22:09] that come the little branches off like
[1:22:11] the pilgrim Holiness and nazarin and
[1:22:13] whatever more come from that through
[1:22:15] sanctification but remember they
[1:22:17] couldn't stay still the pillar of fire
[1:22:19] moved out and they come to ausa Street
[1:22:22] here in count California and then what
[1:22:24] did it do it represented the airplane
[1:22:26] days from the automobile when they God
[1:22:29] was able but the right Brothers to or
[1:22:31] the man was to achieve an airplane that
[1:22:34] could fly immediately forerunning that
[1:22:37] the zeusa street Pentecost fell and man
[1:22:40] tucked to the air into the supernatural
[1:22:43] to the unknown he spoke with unknown
[1:22:46] tongues he done unknown things that was
[1:22:48] foreign to the church because he had
[1:22:50] tuck off of the ground he left the air
[1:22:53] into the
[1:22:55] air what did it immediately after the
[1:22:58] airplanes come on he tuck to the air God
[1:23:02] showed by the airplanes that his church
[1:23:04] was arising he shows by the Natural
[1:23:07] Things what's happening in the spiritual
[1:23:08] they always follow just like the wise
[1:23:10] man following the star to find Christ
[1:23:13] after following for two years now notice
[1:23:15] all those things are achievements that
[1:23:18] man has achieved only are types and
[1:23:20] shadows of what God is to do he always
[1:23:23] does it that way he's told us the signs
[1:23:25] that would be in the skies the things
[1:23:27] that would be happening just before the
[1:23:29] coming of Christ we see that now it's
[1:23:31] only a pointing post and we see signs
[1:23:34] how they have achieved and how God has
[1:23:36] achieved by his church does a man riding
[1:23:38] an airplane you don't want no horse and
[1:23:41] buggy no more unless you just want a
[1:23:43] little fun but the horse and buggy
[1:23:45] remember what is the power in the
[1:23:46] airplane just more horses at it that's
[1:23:48] all and so when John Wesley found
[1:23:53] sanctification uh set aside work from
[1:23:56] justification he never condemned
[1:23:58] justification he only added more power
[1:24:01] to it and when the Pentecostals found
[1:24:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:24:06] restoration of the gifts they never
[1:24:08] denied sanctification or justification
[1:24:11] they just got more power and raised
[1:24:15] up God went up because he found more
[1:24:19] power see all those things foreshadowing
[1:24:21] as they come up if we had time we could
[1:24:23] really stay on that but we haven't but
[1:24:25] he raised up as science achieved
[1:24:28] something Looking Backward God chieves
[1:24:30] going this way going forward to the
[1:24:32] kingdom now we find from isusa Street
[1:24:35] the planes tuck off in great revivals
[1:24:38] and swept the world to the unknown in
[1:24:40] the Heavenly places speaking unknown
[1:24:42] tongues with unknown gifts to the world
[1:24:45] why they thought they were fanatics but
[1:24:48] they had been able God got a group of
[1:24:51] people in his hands
[1:24:52] got a little crosseyed negro man down
[1:24:55] here in the zeusa street that had no
[1:24:57] more sense than to believe what God Said
[1:24:59] was the truth that's right see when a
[1:25:03] science has got to get a lot of sense in
[1:25:05] a man's head of wisdom of knowledge to
[1:25:07] go back and find these things God's got
[1:25:09] to get what he's got in him out of him
[1:25:11] so he can use
[1:25:13] him one going this way and one going
[1:25:15] that way one's going down the other's
[1:25:17] going up amen now she left these inter
[1:25:22] churches grounded when the Pentecostal
[1:25:25] tuck off with speaking in tongues and
[1:25:28] great gifts of healing they heal the
[1:25:30] sick they've done great things they've
[1:25:32] done it there's no doubt for what
[1:25:34] they've done it it's a proof that they
[1:25:36] done it sure it did and they left this
[1:25:38] intellectual Church sitting on the
[1:25:40] ground no matter they say well you can't
[1:25:42] go they did it anyhow where they like
[1:25:45] the little boy in jail for shooting a
[1:25:47] gumbo somebody come in said a little boy
[1:25:50] come in to Vis he said oh they can't put
[1:25:52] you you in jail he said they can't he is
[1:25:54] already there and that's way they say
[1:25:56] that the Holy Ghost was for another age
[1:25:59] that's what they think it's here we know
[1:26:01] it we it it it's we've been flying in
[1:26:04] the air for the last 40 50 years with it
[1:26:07] seeing things that the intellectual
[1:26:09] people knows nothing about only thing
[1:26:11] they can do is sit down and say just
[1:26:13] make fun of it like a little calf on
[1:26:15] time come out of the stall they said it
[1:26:17] was just fat round he's kicking up his
[1:26:19] heels and he had a very fine a farmer
[1:26:22] fed him good and he all round and full
[1:26:23] of vitamins and there's another old lazy
[1:26:25] farmer over there that had a little calf
[1:26:27] also BN in the barn that winter when a
[1:26:29] little fell hadn't eaten nothing but
[1:26:31] weeds and when he come out he was so
[1:26:32] poor he couldn't hardly move and every
[1:26:34] time the wind had blowing shove him
[1:26:35] sideways he seen this the little fat C
[1:26:38] just kicking up his heels and having a
[1:26:39] great time you know he looked through
[1:26:41] the crack of the fence and said such
[1:26:43] fanaticism he was all full of vitamin no
[1:26:46] wonder he could kick up his heels and
[1:26:48] when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:51] there's something something in is full
[1:26:53] of God's spiritual
[1:26:55] vitamin makes him praise God shout and
[1:26:58] that give him because why he's no longer
[1:26:59] Earthbound he's in the heavens sailing
[1:27:02] around in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:27:04] Jesus he left them Earthbound with their
[1:27:07] bicycles and
[1:27:08] Automobiles they went to the air yes
[1:27:11] they're practically taking them out of
[1:27:14] their out of date they heal the sick
[1:27:17] they spoke in unknown languages and done
[1:27:19] many things but now friends may I say
[1:27:21] this
[1:27:22] it has come to the age of
[1:27:26] astronaut we moved out of the airplane
[1:27:29] age we got more power now the astronaut
[1:27:33] age has come in what is it not a we've
[1:27:36] come in to a spiritual age of astronaut
[1:27:40] see going above it's not it's the The
[1:27:42] Same Spirit only more power only this
[1:27:45] that higher can go higher see more
[1:27:47] believe more be more like
[1:27:50] Christ God not not the automobile not
[1:27:53] the horse and buggy not even the
[1:27:55] airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on
[1:27:58] and above each one it's called The Eagle
[1:28:01] age in the Bible God calls His prophets
[1:28:03] Eagle age we realize over in the Bible
[1:28:06] we find in Malachi 4 that we're promised
[1:28:08] at in the last days now he likes His
[1:28:11] prophets to Eagles he calls himself
[1:28:13] Eagle he's the great Jehovah Eagle he's
[1:28:16] able to achieve to himself a bride he's
[1:28:20] going to in the last days be able to get
[1:28:22] a bride that with a ministry that's so
[1:28:26] exactly that like a man and his wife
[1:28:29] becomes one and when Jehovah gets his
[1:28:33] people like him then he lives in his
[1:28:36] people they are one it fulfills the
[1:28:39] scripture exactly what he said in St
[1:28:41] John 14:12 he that believeth on me the
[1:28:43] works that I do shall he also also
[1:28:45] fulfill what Jesus said would take place
[1:28:47] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[1:28:50] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:28:51] now now is the astronaut age and the
[1:28:54] astronaut sees things that the horsh
[1:28:57] rider automobile or airplanes either
[1:29:00] sees he goes higher airplanes still down
[1:29:05] here bouncing around in the clouds and
[1:29:07] having blowouts and hit downs and
[1:29:09] everything else but he goes beyond the
[1:29:12] clouds of Creeds and
[1:29:14] denominations Hallelujah moves on up
[1:29:16] into the
[1:29:18] heavens I'm away from everything the
[1:29:21] astronaut age we are living in the
[1:29:24] astronaut age just as sure as God has
[1:29:26] testified of the natural happenings
[1:29:28] there so is he testifying now that if
[1:29:31] we've achieved an astronaut God has
[1:29:34] achieved what he promised to achieve in
[1:29:36] the last days according to Malachi for
[1:29:38] only thing you has to do is get somebody
[1:29:40] in his
[1:29:41] hands that can cut loose from the
[1:29:44] airplanes and Automobiles and what more
[1:29:46] not look back to what it was but more
[1:29:48] power to lift him higher lift him into
[1:29:50] the presence of God
[1:29:52] lift him up there where all things are
[1:29:54] possible now we see it's happening
[1:29:56] there's no doubt to it so does a
[1:29:58] spiritual astronaut as the the natural
[1:30:01] astronaut goes on above the planes the
[1:30:03] planes always wrecking up and fussing in
[1:30:05] the clouds and everything like that
[1:30:08] there can be nothing greater no more
[1:30:10] achievement than the astronaut only
[1:30:12] thing he has to just keep putting more
[1:30:14] power he'll go anywhere he wants to see
[1:30:16] because he's done gone into space
[1:30:19] airplanes are still down Wrecking
[1:30:21] pussing grounded and everything like
[1:30:23] that but the astronaut don't have to be
[1:30:25] grounded he goes on above the clouds he
[1:30:27] goes on above on above the Creed on
[1:30:30] above the denomination on above those
[1:30:32] Say It Isn't So it isn't so he's got a
[1:30:34] guide the Holy Spirit the word tells him
[1:30:37] so and he moves
[1:30:39] on how does a science make an astronaut
[1:30:42] he takes what power they got this keep
[1:30:43] breaking something into it'll make it go
[1:30:45] farther go without air and so forth he
[1:30:47] keeps I don't know the the chemicals of
[1:30:49] it I'm not a mechanic but whatever it is
[1:30:52] he keeps making it go higher and higher
[1:30:54] he keeps improving at all times and now
[1:30:56] he can go beyond any reason so does
[1:30:59] God's astronaut goes beyond all Church
[1:31:02] Creed all boundaries all these things
[1:31:04] says the days of Miracles has pass there
[1:31:05] is no such a thing how did the astronaut
[1:31:07] find this he figured it out on paper it
[1:31:10] come off of paper what he figured out
[1:31:12] the same thing that any man can sit down
[1:31:14] and read the word of God and see what's
[1:31:16] promised amen search the scriptures in
[1:31:19] them you think you have eternal life
[1:31:20] said Jesus and testify of me that
[1:31:24] Earthbound Bunch they had back there in
[1:31:25] them days didn't know what he was
[1:31:28] Ministry what does it the astronaut SE
[1:31:31] things that the planes is everything's
[1:31:33] out of date so does a spiritual
[1:31:35] astronaut goes beyond the clouds and
[1:31:38] Beyond Creeds and Beyond doubt out into
[1:31:40] outer
[1:31:42] space outer space of all
[1:31:45] unbelief outer space where you don't
[1:31:48] hear the chatter saying well you can't
[1:31:49] do it nobody cooperate cooperate with
[1:31:51] you can't do this you can't do that he
[1:31:53] doesn't notice it he's an astronaut he
[1:31:56] goes on Beyond those
[1:31:58] clouds it's too stormy we can't make it
[1:32:00] it don't make any difference to an
[1:32:01] astronaut he goes beyond the storm
[1:32:04] that's the way it is to a real astronaut
[1:32:05] faith today they said well the doctor
[1:32:07] said so so that might be all right but
[1:32:09] an astronaut don't believe that when
[1:32:10] it's wrot here and he's got it in his
[1:32:11] heart something tells him he just
[1:32:13] propels right on out that's all goes
[1:32:15] right on out into the space because
[1:32:17] we're living in an astronaut age yes
[1:32:19] you're out in space we're all things are
[1:32:23] possible to them that believe he has a
[1:32:25] guide which is his word that tells him
[1:32:26] how to go the word of God natural
[1:32:29] astronaut is has uh something to
[1:32:33] controlling when the astronaut is in the
[1:32:35] air he has something backward here back
[1:32:38] down here on the earth that controls him
[1:32:41] is called radar that radar moves him
[1:32:44] around sells where he's that tells what
[1:32:46] he's doing and that radar controls him
[1:32:49] from a radar Tower here on Earth that's
[1:32:53] the natural astronaut so the spiritual
[1:32:55] astronaut has a control Power has a
[1:32:58] control tower too it's not down here
[1:33:01] like man is it's up there and it's the
[1:33:03] Holy Ghost that's in him that's
[1:33:05] controlling him a to of the baptism of
[1:33:09] the Holy Ghost it's under control keeps
[1:33:12] him in control by the word not in a
[1:33:14] bunch of fanaticism some hooped up
[1:33:16] nonsense but thus sayeth the Lord and it
[1:33:19] happens it's always under control he's
[1:33:22] got a control tower that's the Holy
[1:33:24] Ghost and the word is his his program
[1:33:27] and he lays right into that program and
[1:33:29] the power of the Holy Ghost endows him
[1:33:33] to move out and it brings the
[1:33:34] achievement that God wants to be
[1:33:36] achieved for his people that it might
[1:33:38] fulfill what he promised Jesus did not
[1:33:41] heal the people because he had to do it
[1:33:43] he ful it fulfilled the scripture he
[1:33:46] healed because it was written he would
[1:33:48] do it he don't have to show these signs
[1:33:50] today he don't have to have a Ministry
[1:33:52] of such and such but he promised he' do
[1:33:55] it he does it to fulfill his promise
[1:33:59] brother sister man women can't you see
[1:34:01] that can't you see the type of the
[1:34:03] spiritual and the natural these great
[1:34:06] achievements has brought the time clock
[1:34:08] of Science and it broke into such a
[1:34:10] place until they say now it's only on
[1:34:14] the clock of science they say it's three
[1:34:17] minutes till
[1:34:19] midnight they're at the end
[1:34:22] they found the thing that will destroy
[1:34:24] him they found everything an astronaut
[1:34:26] can get in the air and go over with
[1:34:28] atomic powers and set up there and say
[1:34:30] surrender or be blowned up three minutes
[1:34:33] until midnight they have worked on what
[1:34:36] God has done they've been able to
[1:34:38] pervert instead of trying to make life
[1:34:41] they're always trying to find something
[1:34:42] to kill somebody something will out do
[1:34:44] the next thing beat the next Nation beat
[1:34:45] the next place that's what they're
[1:34:47] trying to do but man looks on calling
[1:34:50] man his brother trying to lead to a home
[1:34:52] where he won't have to die one is in
[1:34:54] death the other is in life but these in
[1:34:57] death only represent life the Le when he
[1:34:59] falls off a tree and dies only mean it's
[1:35:01] coming back again because it has been
[1:35:05] the clock ticks upon on the achievement
[1:35:07] of science today to 3 Minutes to
[1:35:08] Midnight on God's Great clot it ticks
[1:35:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:35:14] and forever we have
[1:35:17] arrived the works that I do shall you
[1:35:20] also Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:35:23] today and forever when the scientific
[1:35:25] clock says 3 minutes to destruction
[1:35:28] God's clock says Jesus Christ the same
[1:35:30] yesterday today and forever he's on the
[1:35:33] earth in the power of the Holy Ghost to
[1:35:35] make his word live and do for his church
[1:35:38] just exactly what he promised it would
[1:35:40] do fill in his astronauts get them all
[1:35:43] fueled up and ready
[1:35:45] so they got in their great big
[1:35:48] scientific tube here not long ago
[1:35:50] astronaut to and are taking the
[1:35:54] countdown now headed for the moon
[1:35:58] they're getting off of here too they got
[1:36:00] a astronaut in a big tube powered by
[1:36:04] atomic power that they can send it Plum
[1:36:06] to the Moon they claim they got in their
[1:36:08] tube and are waiting for the countdown
[1:36:11] the spiritual astronaut God in Christ
[1:36:14] and is listening to the countdown of the
[1:36:17] word amen amen how you lose in order to
[1:36:21] shout you Baptist and Presbyterian
[1:36:24] watch's the countdown of the word oh my
[1:36:27] countdown of the word and they're headed
[1:36:30] for heaven not to the Moon they'll pass
[1:36:33] the moon so fast they won't even see
[1:36:37] it oh my waiting for the countdown yes
[1:36:42] sir waiting for the countdown is right
[1:36:44] what are they doing they're waping
[1:36:47] Christ in rapturing Grace nothing they
[1:36:50] did themselves chist took the uneducated
[1:36:52] the foolish things of the world wrapped
[1:36:54] his astronauts in it and empowered them
[1:36:57] with the Holy Ghost to take off this
[1:36:59] world's going to be left alone that's
[1:37:01] right take it
[1:37:07] off that ought to encourage
[1:37:10] us amen okay we we we see what's
[1:37:15] happening okay so if all this is
[1:37:18] happening then we know that God is
[1:37:20] achiev in something uh spiritual too
[1:37:25] because these things work uh right along
[1:37:29] with the other one it improves the other
[1:37:31] one that they work together they're a
[1:37:33] type they're a sign they're everything
[1:37:36] one's going One Direction one's going
[1:37:40] the other
[1:37:41] direction and I just thought it was uh a
[1:37:44] marvelous if if we just think and go
[1:37:46] back and read it he says the mat the
[1:37:49] natural man
[1:37:52] uh by knowledge looks backwards for his
[1:37:58] achievements so that's how he knows he's
[1:38:00] achieved because he looks backwards he
[1:38:03] looks back at what he was to where that
[1:38:07] he is so he's always looking backwards
[1:38:10] for his achievements that's science see
[1:38:14] what God has done in the former creation
[1:38:18] he says but God in the spirit ual
[1:38:21] achievement is going forward not going
[1:38:25] backwards he's going forward looking to
[1:38:29] what the word and and believing the
[1:38:34] promise for the things that
[1:38:36] has never has come yet for the
[1:38:41] spiritual
[1:38:43] Revelation to manifest the spiritual
[1:38:47] things that God has promised so man's
[1:38:52] looking
[1:38:53] back you you you see so what what I'm
[1:38:57] trying to express to you is that the
[1:38:59] reason all of this is going
[1:39:03] on is to for us to see they're going
[1:39:07] backwards they're going into science
[1:39:10] they're looking for achievements but the
[1:39:13] spiritual person the spiritual believer
[1:39:18] the the spiritual astronaut he doesn't
[1:39:21] look back he doesn't look to the carnal
[1:39:24] he doesn't look that he looks
[1:39:27] forward what is God got for me I see all
[1:39:31] this stuff here and all this plague all
[1:39:35] this uh economy this whole condition the
[1:39:40] the world's in it's it's a type it's a
[1:39:45] shadow it's a forerunner it tells me
[1:39:49] that this has come
[1:39:51] in order to push
[1:39:54] me to look forward to what God's trying
[1:39:58] to
[1:39:59] achieve what is he trying to achieve in
[1:40:04] us that's where my heart's beating what
[1:40:07] is he trying to produce what kind of
[1:40:10] Christians what kind of Faith should be
[1:40:13] coming out of this what kind of light
[1:40:16] should be shining from us what's he want
[1:40:19] out of this church why why does he let
[1:40:21] Darkness come upon it so the light can
[1:40:24] shine why the contrast so the truth can
[1:40:27] be
[1:40:30] manifested none of this is all going
[1:40:33] somewhere it it's all it's all trying to
[1:40:38] uh it
[1:40:40] is there's something
[1:40:44] working we we' we' sat down and got
[1:40:49] depressed so you were sick for a
[1:40:53] week sickness is in the
[1:40:58] flesh I I had many people call me this
[1:41:02] virus everybody thought it was so
[1:41:03] terrible someone called me up and said
[1:41:05] you know what if I've I've had the flu
[1:41:07] worse than this I've been a lot sicker
[1:41:11] than this so why is it so
[1:41:15] major why is there such a reaction why
[1:41:18] is what what is
[1:41:21] is the
[1:41:23] negative okay CU everything is an
[1:41:27] achievement what is trying to be
[1:41:29] achieved by this virus by this great uh
[1:41:35] shutdown by by this great fear by all of
[1:41:40] us wrapping our faces up and staying six
[1:41:43] feet you think all this is happening
[1:41:46] just CU a bug got
[1:41:48] loose no there's two things going on
[1:41:52] it's trying to accomplish something and
[1:41:54] it's trying to accomplish an improvement
[1:41:57] in what they feel the world
[1:42:00] needs that's it that's
[1:42:03] it they're try and but yet God's trying
[1:42:07] to accomplish something and to achieve
[1:42:11] something so there's a lot of things
[1:42:13] he's trying to achieve one of the things
[1:42:16] he's trying to achieve is the great
[1:42:17] Falling
[1:42:19] Away or you don't think it's happening
[1:42:22] look this morning you know what you've
[1:42:24] done people have substituted you know
[1:42:27] what Satan wants he wants his
[1:42:29] achievement so we look at the astronaut
[1:42:32] now we look at what do we have today
[1:42:34] what's our biggest achievement
[1:42:36] technology cell phones
[1:42:40] internet right what do you think Satan
[1:42:43] wants he wants an Internet Church
[1:42:47] electronic church if you could have been
[1:42:50] here here this
[1:42:52] morning you were healthy you had
[1:42:56] Faith you need to stop and check if
[1:43:00] you're slipping into the electronic
[1:43:09] Church
[1:43:11] sure that's what he wants he wants
[1:43:13] electronic
[1:43:17] church people are satisfied now with
[1:43:21] watching service
[1:43:24] later they they they they can fit at any
[1:43:27] time in their life that they want they
[1:43:31] they don't have to really be a part of
[1:43:32] an assembly or really sit under a
[1:43:35] Ministry they can listen to brother such
[1:43:37] and such here and brothers such and such
[1:43:40] there they can do this it it doesn't
[1:43:42] matter they're not really part of the
[1:43:44] body they can give when they want to
[1:43:46] give they don't have to give if they
[1:43:48] don't have to give anyway so now they're
[1:43:51] all
[1:43:54] immersed they're
[1:43:56] immersed in electronic
[1:44:00] Church they're immersed in a internet
[1:44:03] experience with the word where they can
[1:44:06] filter it and they can they can sit
[1:44:09] around and they can watch it they can
[1:44:11] watch it in Parts they can uh it just
[1:44:15] all it's just a whole different attitude
[1:44:18] it's a whole different approach
[1:44:21] you don't think that there's something
[1:44:23] going
[1:44:25] on getting everybody to work at home
[1:44:28] keep people from interacting breaking
[1:44:31] down setting up a form of communication
[1:44:34] where you
[1:44:37] text nobody can look at somebody anymore
[1:44:40] take them by the hands look them in the
[1:44:42] face and say friend you're headed to
[1:44:47] Hell the way you're living the wages of
[1:44:51] sin is death you can't do this leave me
[1:44:56] alone send me a
[1:44:59] text send me an
[1:45:03] email it's changing things the old
[1:45:06] fashion gospel was to assemble ourselves
[1:45:10] together to pray till the presence and
[1:45:13] power of God come down and the Holy
[1:45:15] Spirit moved up put people under
[1:45:18] conviction changed their lives fill them
[1:45:20] with the spirit of God where they're on
[1:45:23] fire for the gospel and they went out
[1:45:25] testifying that this is real and it
[1:45:28] lives it ain't a fake electronic
[1:45:34] experience it's
[1:45:36] real it's leaving the
[1:45:40] church because that's what it's trying
[1:45:43] to
[1:45:44] achieve that's what it's trying to do
[1:45:47] press the life out of it press the
[1:45:50] experience exp erience out of it build
[1:45:52] you a
[1:45:54] filter nobody likes conviction
[1:45:59] anymore they asked a great preacher why
[1:46:01] are you so successful why are there so
[1:46:04] many uh people in your uh people in your
[1:46:09] uh uh congregation could you open that
[1:46:12] for me I just ordained you a
[1:46:19] deacon thank
[1:46:24] you and they asked him they said why are
[1:46:26] you so successful why do so many people
[1:46:29] come to your thing he says well we don't
[1:46:31] preach against
[1:46:34] sin that
[1:46:37] works you know why cuz sin has a
[1:46:41] wage and the wages of sin is
[1:46:46] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:46:49] life to know him is
[1:46:53] life so okay if so we can't miss what
[1:46:57] the messenger's telling us
[1:46:59] here we can't we can't let it slip he
[1:47:04] says all the things that are happening
[1:47:07] now there's a
[1:47:09] spiritual
[1:47:12] happening achievement that's running
[1:47:16] parallel with it one is going up and one
[1:47:21] is going down let me just say that again
[1:47:26] he says he is going
[1:47:30] forward looking into the word and
[1:47:34] believing the promises for things that's
[1:47:39] never has come yet so when I see this
[1:47:45] condition
[1:47:46] coming when I see the church slipping in
[1:47:50] into the electronic
[1:47:52] church when I see people not wanting to
[1:47:55] contact one another when I see people
[1:47:59] not wanting to Bear burdens when I see
[1:48:02] people hung up in their own Financial
[1:48:05] commitments nobody's going the extra
[1:48:08] mile nobody's with visiting the Widow in
[1:48:10] her Affliction nobody's feeding the
[1:48:13] hungry nobody's given their cloak to the
[1:48:16] poor the Beatitudes are tossed right out
[1:48:19] of the window in other words it's an
[1:48:22] intellectual
[1:48:23] electronic study of God's word but the
[1:48:27] living life of Christ dwelling in a
[1:48:30] person to where there are many Messiahs
[1:48:34] going about doing the father's business
[1:48:36] with signs and wonders following is is
[1:48:39] now not becoming the definition of
[1:48:47] Christianity the definition of Christian
[1:48:50] is pulling up quotes and having
[1:48:52] intellectual
[1:48:56] comparison but there's
[1:48:59] life okay so if this is going
[1:49:04] on and people are backsliding people are
[1:49:07] happy to be out of
[1:49:11] church like they there's not a need for
[1:49:14] it
[1:49:18] anymore there's no not a need for it we
[1:49:21] don't need to do
[1:49:25] it I'll catch up
[1:49:29] later it's and that's what it is it's
[1:49:32] not the Holy Ghost it's
[1:49:36] ketchup might as well put it on your
[1:49:39] hamburger while you're watching
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:43] service but there's something else that
[1:49:46] God's
[1:49:47] achieving something that hasn't come yet
[1:49:50] yet some of a power a horow that takes
[1:49:55] us higher something that's going to
[1:49:58] empower us that that that's going to
[1:50:01] take us to move to the next
[1:50:04] level something that God wants to give
[1:50:07] his church that that he wants to empower
[1:50:10] his church with that's going to take him
[1:50:12] out take them off take
[1:50:16] off there's an achievement that God's
[1:50:19] trying to achieve
[1:50:20] in the midst of all what's going on God
[1:50:24] is trying to give his church more
[1:50:27] spiritual horse power so she can lift
[1:50:32] off that's what we got to be looking for
[1:50:36] where's that at what's God doing what's
[1:50:40] going
[1:50:41] on you can't let this thing just wrap
[1:50:44] you up like a mummy where you just
[1:50:47] become what do you want me to do wear a
[1:50:48] mask wear a mask
[1:50:51] you want me to stay home stay home what
[1:50:54] do you want me to do
[1:50:56] now wait till the next bulletin comes
[1:50:59] out don't have Thanksgiving no
[1:51:03] Thanksgiving turkey sales will be
[1:51:08] down we're being
[1:51:14] roboted because there's an
[1:51:16] achievement that he's trying to
[1:51:18] achieve
[1:51:22] a One World Government
[1:51:25] yes uh uh whether it's not done with
[1:51:28] maybe in the form of a government but
[1:51:31] what it comes in a way of a thinking a
[1:51:33] way of a philosophy the way that you
[1:51:37] Viewpoint amen and then people are just
[1:51:41] and we we're just throwing out Christian
[1:51:44] principles for throwing out
[1:51:47] things so you know I I I recognize I sit
[1:51:51] back and I I say okay this plague comes
[1:51:55] all right we got to do thing we got to
[1:51:56] shut down Church shut down everybody
[1:51:58] shuts down we shut down
[1:52:00] Church all right
[1:52:03] great then it goes on this now you can
[1:52:06] go 10 people and then now you can go 50
[1:52:09] now you can go 75 now you can go a
[1:52:13] 100 conditioning us conditioning us
[1:52:16] getting us ready getting us the thing
[1:52:19] getting us taking control taking control
[1:52:22] just moving us up then they let us go
[1:52:25] for a while woo there's another
[1:52:32] wave you know what get
[1:52:36] sick get over
[1:52:43] it it's not going to kill
[1:52:48] you
[1:52:50] have you passed from Death un
[1:52:53] life it ain't going to kill
[1:52:59] you you'll overcome it you'll get
[1:53:05] better we know who it hurts we know what
[1:53:09] age group it affects we know what
[1:53:11] condition they have to be in we can
[1:53:13] protect
[1:53:14] those but what we can't let happen is
[1:53:18] let the dark spiritual motives and
[1:53:22] conditions that follow it take hold of
[1:53:27] us because there's something that it's
[1:53:30] trying to achieve but this is what he
[1:53:32] says for this he says had is never come
[1:53:36] yet what are they they're looking into
[1:53:38] the word and believing the promises for
[1:53:42] things that have never come yet for the
[1:53:45] spiritual
[1:53:48] Revelation what are they looking looking
[1:53:50] for they're looking for something that
[1:53:52] hasn't come
[1:53:56] yet for the spiritual Revelation to
[1:54:01] manifest the spiritual things that God
[1:54:06] has promised to come to pass so when we
[1:54:10] see these things we should say
[1:54:13] whoa I see what it's
[1:54:16] doing I see the effect that it's having
[1:54:20] I I see the fear that it's putting in
[1:54:23] the people I see how the the the control
[1:54:28] is taking over the people how they're
[1:54:30] losing their
[1:54:33] individuality I I can see that but it
[1:54:38] tells me that if this is happening in
[1:54:40] the natural the natural types the
[1:54:43] spiritual that these two happenings
[1:54:46] coincide together and they're companions
[1:54:51] one to another because each one is
[1:54:54] helping the other one to improve yes
[1:55:00] amen their darkness is improving
[1:55:03] yes their
[1:55:07] deception is
[1:55:11] improving our country is in political
[1:55:15] chaos our government's
[1:55:18] gone it's over
[1:55:22] they're marrying together the pope even
[1:55:26] come
[1:55:27] out and said oh well you can't have same
[1:55:32] gender marriages in the church but
[1:55:36] they're okay if you do it in the
[1:55:40] government that's what he said how many
[1:55:42] knows he said that it's exactly what he
[1:55:45] said don't you see what he just did he
[1:55:48] legitim ized
[1:55:53] government he
[1:55:55] spiritualized the practices of the
[1:56:00] government because who is he he's the v
[1:56:04] he's the devil that's right sitting on
[1:56:07] the thrones with the Triple Crown out
[1:56:11] there joining the church and the state

[1:56:42] they're for the
[1:56:44] believer for the
[1:56:47] astronaut and he and the one that's

[1:57:03] taking
[1:57:05] place Satan's goes

[1:59:22] blast
[1:59:28] off I don't want the what they're going
[1:59:30] to

[1:59:37] that but I I see where they're
[1:59:40] going I see what they want to
[1:59:44] do I see they want to keep their world
[1:59:47] and protect their world fine
[1:59:49] I want out of their
[1:59:52] world if all this is going on and all
[1:59:56] these things are happening and all these
[1:59:58] events are happening so the world can
[2:00:01] come together and we can do all these
[2:00:04] great things for mankind and everything
[2:00:06] there's something inside of me that
[2:00:08] tells me there's something that God's
[2:00:10] got for me that I have not seen yet a
[2:00:18] spiritual
[2:00:20] a a spiritual
[2:00:23] Revelation to manifest the spiritual
[2:00:27] things that God has
[2:00:33] promised that's where my heart's
[2:00:36] at I have to be the first to admit I got
[2:00:39] caught up in all this
[2:00:40] stuff all of a sudden I see the
[2:00:43] countdown and I thought wow what's the
[2:00:46] prophet telling me he's telling me it's
[2:00:48] a count count
[2:00:51] down it's counting
[2:00:54] down it it's it's it's it's it's working
[2:00:59] its
[2:01:01] way he says he says we me he says the
[2:01:05] astronot has come in what is it we've
[2:01:09] come into a into a spiritual age of
[2:01:14] astronaut see going
[2:01:18] above
[2:01:21] this age brings us above what above our
[2:01:25] fears above our doubts above our
[2:01:30] flesh there's that God's wanting to do
[2:01:33] something to this church he's wanting to
[2:01:36] make this church come alive he wants to
[2:01:38] empower this church so they can be
[2:01:40] little Messiah who they can carry out
[2:01:43] the last work the last sign the last
[2:01:46] Ministry of Christ will be in the pred
[2:01:49] doing the same things that he did under
[2:01:53] a Roman
[2:01:58] Empire he says he says an asine has come
[2:02:01] in what is
[2:02:02] it we've come into a spiritual age of
[2:02:05] asite going above it's the same
[2:02:10] Spirit only more
[2:02:14] power not a different spirit it's the
[2:02:18] same spirit you
[2:02:21] have but the
[2:02:24] age empowers that Spirit
[2:02:28] more not a different
[2:02:31] spirit it's a restoration of Faith
[2:02:34] that's what he said with the church he
[2:02:36] says the church doesn't have the faith
[2:02:38] to use what it's
[2:02:43] got be
[2:02:44] empowered look at yourselves are you all
[2:02:47] caught up in the world you you're all
[2:02:49] caught up in school you all caught up in
[2:02:51] the future you all caught up in worldly
[2:02:53] events you all caught up in these things
[2:02:55] that's fine you live in the world but
[2:02:57] you're not of the world you're not
[2:02:59] staying in the world you shouldn't be
[2:03:02] spending your whole strength preparing
[2:03:05] for a world that you've got a ticket to
[2:03:15] leave I love this what he says here he
[2:03:20] says it's the same Spirit more power
[2:03:23] only lifted
[2:03:25] higher can go higher can see more
[2:03:31] believe more be more like
[2:03:36] Christ it's a power that lifts us up to
[2:03:41] see more believe more to be more like
[2:03:45] Christ okay so this is all going going
[2:03:50] on cuz it's going
[2:03:54] backwards it's going down we're going up
[2:03:59] this is all going on on so now we can
[2:04:01] step back and say wait a minute when we
[2:04:03] see this we know that there's something
[2:04:07] going spiritually
[2:04:09] too in the same exact parallel it's
[2:04:12] going on exactly the same
[2:04:14] way what is
[2:04:17] it what is God have for
[2:04:20] me what is it that he wants me to
[2:04:25] see what's he preparing me
[2:04:28] for take
[2:04:32] off take off there's only one thing he
[2:04:35] wants to do is to prepare his bride for
[2:04:37] take off all this
[2:04:40] pandemic and all what they're
[2:04:44] doing is only is there
[2:04:50] that to help
[2:04:54] us and get us into a place that God can
[2:05:00] achieve what his purpose and plan
[2:05:05] is his plan isn't for this world his
[2:05:09] plan's for a new Heaven and a new Earth
[2:05:13] his plan isn't to leave us here and make
[2:05:16] it better his plan is I have prepared a
[2:05:19] place for you if I had not prepared a
[2:05:22] place for you I wouldn't tell you i' go
[2:05:24] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[2:05:26] to prepare a place for you I will come
[2:05:29] again and receive you that where I am
[2:05:33] you may be
[2:05:37] also rapturing
[2:05:40] Faith this whole thing this whole
[2:05:43] condition this whole what's going on
[2:05:46] this whole
[2:05:47] Madness is got one purpose is so the
[2:05:51] church can
[2:05:53] look and pray for the spiritual
[2:05:57] Revelation for the power that she does
[2:06:01] not have
[2:06:05] yet but man's always looking back at
[2:06:08] their
[2:06:10] achievement they're always looking back
[2:06:12] from where they've come
[2:06:16] from we don't look back we look
[2:06:22] forward we look forward to what God has
[2:06:25] for us we don't s oh wow my goodness
[2:06:30] America's never going to be the
[2:06:34] same oh we're struck at that when we had
[2:06:38] a prophet tell us he quit praying for
[2:06:40] her a long time
[2:06:43] ago I like
[2:06:46] America I'm glad to be American God made
[2:06:48] me an
[2:06:50] American I'm an Irish
[2:06:53] American I hold my Irish heritage
[2:06:57] above you know that's just how we are
[2:06:59] we're Irish
[2:07:02] Americans but I've got am not part of
[2:07:05] this
[2:07:08] world so
[2:07:10] we're we're all upset and and we're all
[2:07:14] depressed and we're we're locked in our
[2:07:17] houses and we're scared to
[2:07:21] death wait a
[2:07:25] minute why am I
[2:07:27] powerless why can't I take up a deadly
[2:07:30] thing and it not harm
[2:07:32] me what's happened to the
[2:07:35] identifications of the church are we
[2:07:37] identified now because we have a cross
[2:07:39] on our
[2:07:41] mask and another one's got a Harley
[2:07:44] sticker and and you know what's our
[2:07:47] identification
[2:07:49] are we just part of the mass are we part
[2:07:52] of the herd are we being pushed
[2:07:57] along the whole reason for it all the
[2:08:00] whole reason for it all the whole
[2:08:02] purpose that God allowed it was so this
[2:08:05] bride can shake
[2:08:09] themselves and realize that what are we
[2:08:12] all
[2:08:13] recognizing we're all recognizing the
[2:08:17] deterioration of the United States and
[2:08:20] its
[2:08:21] morals we're all recognizing that
[2:08:25] science is now becoming the God and
[2:08:29] churches are slowly being done away
[2:08:33] with don't you see that they're closing
[2:08:38] up why do you think they want churches
[2:08:40] closed
[2:08:41] down CU they don't pay
[2:08:45] taxes and they're going to need all your
[2:08:48] money to save the doomed
[2:08:55] world
[2:09:00] sorry I'm not going to fix this doomed
[2:09:03] world they're not going to fix this Doom
[2:09:10] World a way seeth right unto a man and
[2:09:14] the end of that way is death it ain't
[2:09:16] going to get better
[2:09:21] but I can live above
[2:09:26] it I can live in a different realm I
[2:09:29] don't have to be down where the airplane
[2:09:34] is that's what he said Pentecost it's
[2:09:37] crashing it's bumping it's getting
[2:09:39] blowned up by the clouds nobody can
[2:09:41] knows where they're stable that can't
[2:09:43] balance between the move of the spirit
[2:09:45] and the move of the government
[2:09:49] nobody has a Clear
[2:09:52] Vision but what's an astronaut do he
[2:09:55] gets up where he can sees above what the
[2:09:58] airplane can
[2:09:59] see I counsel thee to buy of me isav
[2:10:04] that thou mayest
[2:10:06] see that you can look at your life at
[2:10:11] this world at what's trans uh
[2:10:15] transpiring and you can have spiritual
[2:10:17] eyes and look at it and say wow I see
[2:10:21] this is heading in a Direction that's
[2:10:24] contrary to the word of God what's God
[2:10:27] got for
[2:10:30] me that's what this ought to be doing to
[2:10:33] us it ought to be saying I need to get
[2:10:36] back on fire I need to make contact I
[2:10:38] got to get in my closet I've got to get
[2:10:41] refilled with the Holy Ghost I've got to
[2:10:43] get the spiritual Revelation that will
[2:10:47] cause the man manifestation of the
[2:10:50] promise what's the promise a
[2:10:56] Rapture our promis is a way of
[2:11:03] Escape that's what our promise
[2:11:05] is that's what I ought to be looking for
[2:11:09] I see where they're
[2:11:11] headed I see their iniquity is getting
[2:11:15] filled they're legalizing full term
[2:11:21] abortions if your child's born and it's
[2:11:24] got some sort of defect they lay it on
[2:11:26] the
[2:11:29] table and let it
[2:11:32] die
[2:11:36] America
[2:11:40] America
[2:11:42] America men marrying women men women
[2:11:46] marrying women thousands of kids don't
[2:11:49] know who their parents is divorced
[2:11:52] giving into
[2:11:55] divorce
[2:11:58] America drug addicts everywhere
[2:12:01] alcoholism
[2:12:03] everywhere that's really what you're
[2:12:05] living
[2:12:10] in take your harder money for some weird
[2:12:14] program
[2:12:16] somewhere to save the the grape tick
[2:12:20] from
[2:12:24] Extinction they care more about a grape
[2:12:28] tick I don't know if there is such a one
[2:12:30] but it struck me as being
[2:12:34] possible they care more about that than
[2:12:36] they do the
[2:12:39] soul what if it profited a man if he
[2:12:42] gains the whole world and loses his
[2:12:47] soul
[2:12:50] and and this isn't having the effect on
[2:12:53] us that it
[2:12:56] should it's having a negative effect on
[2:12:59] us we've almost shut down our
[2:13:02] church so we can't afford
[2:13:06] it it's almost getting people to say we
[2:13:09] don't need to build a new Sanctuary
[2:13:10] because we can just do it
[2:13:14] online is changing your thinking is
[2:13:18] changing my thinking is having a
[2:13:21] negative effect on us because that's the
[2:13:23] way the world always goes it always goes
[2:13:29] backwards it it it it it doesn't go
[2:13:32] forward it goes backwards it always
[2:13:34] moves backwards I thought it was that I
[2:13:38] thought that was just such a
[2:13:40] phenomenal
[2:13:42] statement that it it goes
[2:13:46] backwards so it's counting down to its
[2:13:55] destruction do you understand that it's
[2:13:58] counting down to its
[2:14:02] destruction man always counts
[2:14:06] backwards 10 nine
[2:14:11] 7 this is what the prophet of God
[2:14:15] said notice the natural man even counts
[2:14:21] backwards I said he did things backwards
[2:14:25] he counts backwards watch he counts 10 9
[2:14:31] 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero he goes back and
[2:14:40] starts counting 10 it's a bad
[2:14:44] number he says then he says now notice
[2:14:50] he says what does God
[2:14:53] do he starts with his number seven
[2:14:57] that's God's number watch him seven and
[2:15:03] he counts ahead starting with one he
[2:15:07] starts with his first church age that's
[2:15:10] what his symbol on the
[2:15:16] earth that was this Church age his
[2:15:20] symbol that he was on the
[2:15:25] Earth where was he on the earth in the
[2:15:29] spirit filled
[2:15:31] believer he was veiled in flesh that's
[2:15:35] why the scripture says any man that says
[2:15:38] that Jesus Christ has not come in the
[2:15:40] flesh is Antichrist that's not that
[2:15:43] Jesus was here on the cross but that
[2:15:46] Jesus came again
[2:15:48] and indwelled in a living
[2:15:52] people and the works that I do shall you
[2:15:55] do also Silver and Gold Have I None but
[2:15:58] what I received on the day of Pentecost
[2:16:01] the indwelling presence of the spirit of
[2:16:04] God that power which is given to me this
[2:16:08] I give to
[2:16:12] you you want to write that story
[2:16:15] today Peter came in with a m gone so
[2:16:19] they didn't know who he
[2:16:22] was and then he went up to the and I'm
[2:16:24] not against wearing mask you wear mask
[2:16:26] if you want because it don't do do one
[2:16:28] thing for you either
[2:16:31] way if God don't watch the city The
[2:16:33] Watchman watches in vain so I believe in
[2:16:36] washing your hands I believe in staying
[2:16:38] apart but can you imagine the story in
[2:16:40] that
[2:16:41] day Peter would just stay away from him
[2:16:45] he'd have to check with his attorney to
[2:16:47] see if he had a letter that he could
[2:16:50] Minister uh laying on of hands without a
[2:16:57] license you you just couldn't have be a
[2:17:00] Good
[2:17:03] Samaritan and now there's all this story
[2:17:05] and he gets back there and he can't
[2:17:07] really talk to the guy and he he he
[2:17:10] wants to know what religion he is what
[2:17:12] denomination he
[2:17:14] is what what religion are you where do
[2:17:17] you go to church and fellowship Peter
[2:17:20] didn't do any of that he had something
[2:17:23] in him that was bubbling like a
[2:17:28] Brook and I know we have to make
[2:17:30] adjustments because we're in the world
[2:17:33] but we're not of the world but we don't
[2:17:35] have to give up our vision of going
[2:17:38] forward we don't have to stop because
[2:17:40] they've
[2:17:42] stopped so he says this he
[2:17:45] says notice he counts Str Straight Ahead
[2:17:48] not backwards he goes forwards he starts
[2:17:50] from his first church age which began in
[2:17:54] 33 and he starts the countdown he counts
[2:17:58] his
[2:18:00] ages that the birth of the church on the
[2:18:04] day of Pentecost what did he start
[2:18:06] counting he started counting the church
[2:18:08] age the first one was Ephesus number one
[2:18:13] two samarina three pergamus four thyra
[2:18:18] five Sardis six Philadelphia seven Leia
[2:18:22] it's later than you think it's later
[2:18:27] than you think the counting is over the
[2:18:30] next thing is
[2:18:37] zero that's why I'm calling my sermon
[2:18:39] it's almost
[2:18:42] zero they're counting themselves to
[2:18:46] destruction God God has been counting us
[2:18:49] to a
[2:18:53] blastoff it's it's it's over it's time
[2:18:56] to leave it's time to get ready it's
[2:19:00] time to realize that the world's in this
[2:19:04] condition so that the church become
[2:19:06] Awake and Alive and look for the
[2:19:10] spiritual Revelation that will cause the
[2:19:15] manifestation of the promise you're not
[2:19:18] going to study your way by reading the
[2:19:21] SE Seven Seals book into rapturing
[2:19:26] Faith it's a
[2:19:28] revelation and this world condition is
[2:19:32] what it is is to cause us to recognize
[2:19:36] that there is a revelation that has not
[2:19:39] yet been received which is in the
[2:19:41] framework of the word of
[2:19:45] God to empower us
[2:19:49] yes as he
[2:19:51] said this world's going to be left alone
[2:19:54] that's right taking
[2:19:57] off the astronauts are taking off we're
[2:20:01] taking
[2:20:04] off let's get ready to take
[2:20:09] off let's see what's he's got in that
[2:20:12] scripture for us to take
[2:20:16] off where not here just enduring
[2:20:21] this it's by reason of their task
[2:20:25] Masters that they called for the promise
[2:20:27] of deliver it should be by the reason of
[2:20:31] this world condition that we call for
[2:20:34] our rapture we need to start calling
[2:20:37] even so come quickly Lord
[2:20:42] Jesus I have no
[2:20:46] idea what but the government's got up
[2:20:48] their sleeve for
[2:20:51] us I have no idea on environmental
[2:20:55] regulations I have no idea on taxes I
[2:21:00] have no idea on
[2:21:04] laws what lies ahead for the church as
[2:21:08] far as taxing us or not taxing us I
[2:21:11] don't have any idea of those
[2:21:13] things those things will do what they do
[2:21:16] but I know one thing this is a
[2:21:21] sign because the natural types the
[2:21:25] spiritual that God has a spiritual
[2:21:28] achievement that he wants to bring
[2:21:33] forth from what's going on there's
[2:21:37] something spiritual that God's trying to
[2:21:40] accomplish for his elect
[2:21:43] lady in the midst of all this that's
[2:21:47] what we need to be looking for that's
[2:21:50] what we need to be praying
[2:21:53] for something that we haven't got yet
[2:21:57] Satan always looks
[2:22:00] back we're always looking back at what
[2:22:03] brother randam preached what he did
[2:22:05] preach looking back at what the sermons
[2:22:08] were looking back at what his ministry
[2:22:11] was but within that
[2:22:14] Ministry was divine
[2:22:17] Revelation stored up for the bride that
[2:22:22] he could break forth in other words he
[2:22:25] could spiritually interpret to you
[2:22:29] personally what was written here in the
[2:22:33] season that you
[2:22:37] needed not looking back at it as
[2:22:40] history but looking to the father above
[2:22:45] to give the spiritual revelation ation
[2:22:48] that will
[2:22:49] create the
[2:22:51] manifestation it's almost
[2:22:56] zero it's their they're counting down to
[2:23:00] their destruction we're counting
[2:23:03] up to our
[2:23:08] Rapture that song we sing the fruit is
[2:23:10] in the vine you know the life is coming
[2:23:15] to
[2:23:16] maturity bringing us back to the
[2:23:19] resurrection and how are we ever going
[2:23:22] to be raptured when we don't believe the
[2:23:24] raptures Our Only
[2:23:29] Hope how do we believe in we're going to
[2:23:32] have a Rapture when we're looking to
[2:23:34] science and looking to the world to get
[2:23:38] better how how are we going to turn our
[2:23:41] eyes upon him if we still think that
[2:23:44] they have a
[2:23:46] solution
[2:23:49] we need to look for the supernatural
[2:23:56] solution I wonder if we're
[2:23:59] getting what's been
[2:24:03] preached I wonder if we're filtering
[2:24:06] everything through a historical
[2:24:08] message brother brandom left the
[2:24:12] physical
[2:24:14] body that Jesus Christ dwelt in to give
[2:24:19] his message to the
[2:24:23] bride but the message that he get was
[2:24:27] prophetic Living Word prophecy that's
[2:24:31] coming to pass every
[2:24:34] day that's what we've got to get in
[2:24:37] contact with Lord give me the revelation
[2:24:41] of the manifestation of the power that's
[2:24:44] going to bring the promise of the
[2:24:48] Rapture to pass let's let our hearts and
[2:24:52] Minds be set on that and not on a world
[2:24:55] that's counting down the
[2:24:59] destruction you understand me this
[2:25:01] morning those of you out there let's get
[2:25:03] back on fire for god let's get back into
[2:25:07] the word of God let's start doing the
[2:25:09] things we'll weather this little
[2:25:12] storm with this virus thing we'll do all
[2:25:15] these little things that they ask us to
[2:25:17] do for their
[2:25:19] sake yes but it's not for our
[2:25:22] sake the only thing that's for our
[2:25:26] sake is the
[2:25:28] truth and the baptism of the spirit
[2:25:31] bringing the love of God shed abroad in
[2:25:35] our heart by the Holy Ghost let's don't
[2:25:38] miss really what's happening there's a
[2:25:43] spiritual
[2:25:45] takeoff in
[2:25:47] progress let's connect with it amen
[2:25:51] that's my heart's desire Lord I know
[2:25:54] you're doing something your Prophet told
[2:25:57] me I know there's an achievement that
[2:26:00] you're doing your Prophet told me Lord
[2:26:03] that's what I want the revelation of I
[2:26:06] want the revelation of what God is doing
[2:26:10] in all this you say do you have it no
[2:26:15] but I know it's there
[2:26:17] because it's promised to be there I
[2:26:20] don't want to get sidetracked and not
[2:26:22] look for it and pray for it and seek it
[2:26:26] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[2:26:29] any man open I will come in and I will
[2:26:32] eat the evening
[2:26:35] meal that he might sit with me on my

[2:26:57] to the Lord Jesus Christ the Forgiveness
[2:27:00] of their sins baptism in the name of the
[2:27:03] Lord Jesus Christ and being sealed with
[2:27:06] the spirit of God till their day of
[2:27:09] redemption let's get back to what his
[2:27:13] purpose was and his intention was in a
[2:27:16] allowing the world to count
[2:27:19] down and him counting up God bless you

[2:28:17] [Music]
[2:28:19] you know they go through a
[2:28:21] [Music]
[2:28:22] checklist I I haven't been in a
[2:28:24] spaceship but I've been in a
[2:28:28] a uh
[2:28:30] airplane and I've watched the guys sit
[2:28:33] there and do the check
[2:28:35] off and I've watched it on the on the
[2:28:39] video of the doing the check off in
[2:28:42] their spaces
[2:28:44] shoe brother REM called it their to
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:28:50] to you know that did you know I I don't
[2:28:54] know if you caught this maybe the young
[2:28:56] kids I'll just say
[2:28:58] this but you know I thought it was
[2:29:00] something that
[2:29:02] uh
[2:29:04] [Music]
[2:29:10] uh he says like this little boy in jail
[2:29:14] for shooting a gumbo
[2:29:18] did anybody know what that
[2:29:20] was a Gumbo's a
[2:29:26] slingshot now
[2:29:28] listen to what he said here he says it's
[2:29:33] like the little boy in jail for shooting
[2:29:37] a a gumbo or a sling shot somebody comes
[2:29:41] in and says little boy comes in to visit
[2:29:44] him and said oh they can't put you in
[2:29:48] jail for shooting a
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:53] gumbo but he was already in
[2:29:58] it you talk about a
[2:30:02] denial you understand you can't say oh
[2:30:05] they can't do that they can't take over
[2:30:08] my life they can't take over my thinking
[2:30:12] they can't take over they can't make
[2:30:14] laws like this they can't can't shut the
[2:30:17] church down they can't do this they
[2:30:19] can't do
[2:30:21] that and they've already done it you're
[2:30:24] already there
[2:30:30] yes you know there might be a reason
[2:30:32] that we get in
[2:30:33] [Music]
[2:30:37] jail there might be a reason we've got
[2:30:39] to where we
[2:30:41] are I hope it's to shake us and let's
[2:30:44] get back to what's supposed to be
[2:30:47] restored in this day the Faith of Our
[2:30:51] Fathers we've quit trying to become the
[2:30:53] restored church and we're starting to
[2:30:56] try to build a denomination on the
[2:30:59] teachings of brother random instead of
[2:31:01] getting the life that brother brandom
[2:31:05] displayed and
[2:31:09] resurrected and I'll say that this way
[2:31:12] the prophet of God
[2:31:14] resurrected the power power in the life
[2:31:18] that the church had
[2:31:20] lost and put it on
[2:31:23] display that we too could come into that
[2:31:28] let's get to what that he
[2:31:30] had and I believe this hour is to shake
