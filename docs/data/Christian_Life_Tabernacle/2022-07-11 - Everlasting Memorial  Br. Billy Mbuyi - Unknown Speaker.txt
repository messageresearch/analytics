Description:
Everlasting Memorial
Br. Billy Mbuyi
July 10th, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] oh [Music] said sir did you know that your little girls could get yellow fever and black fever and die overnight he referred to a different people that had lost him and i had taken them back there and and he says i had taken them back there and and he says on diseases that had no that they had no uh inoculation and things like leprosy and and and your pretty wife and the two little girl with leprosy and the hot sun and the things they've put on aren't you afraid of the danger of taking your children and your wife is such a place the missionaries stood there and the young fellow and tears begin to run down his cheeks and they turn around and he says brothers my vision of god's call he said if god called me to be in africa my children and my family is more safe in africa than in the play at any place in the world i was thinking about this and a little say this it's because that's the place of our protection it's very important as we gather here we are show within ourselves i'm here because god put me here i i'm here because god blessed me here because if that's not the case then there's a wandering there's no questioning there's everything but this young missionary was sure within his heart it says i'm here it says i would be at the place where god called me to be i'm useful there god will protect you there he will do all things and that's why for a remembrance for you to remember the sacrifice that was given the price that was paid for even is no longer and is living in the people the life it can never die if you go back of all those people including the pharaohs you will go you'll find that there's such a tomb but yet within the tomb you'll find that the body is in there the only tomb that has nobody included where you can go and the body is disappear is the lord jesus christ why because it's a memorial to of god trying to show he says much ever made much he says much everywhere chiefly says and because unto them were committed the oracles of god for what if some did not believe he says then shall the unbelief make the faith of god without a fact oh but in verse verse 4 he says god forbid yeah true but let every man be a liar as it is written oh my brother my sister the unbeliever doesn't make the world of god untrue though make believer doesn't make the world of god untrue all they're doing is they're testifying of the truth of god that only him that god calls will come all they're doing is the testifying of the truth that he already said and only my children my sheep will hear my voice follow they will fall after all of these things but my children will come to me all they're doing is testifying that they were they didn't have it in in them to begin with they didn't have the seed to believe with if the uncorruptable seed will hear the word of god and believe it and he says yeah but random speaks about the the the character to realize and to come to a place where we are here building a memorial we are not here as individual people doing their own things where we just come together and we retorial god is building a spiritual house and every part of us every one of us is a stone that's going to go in this living memorial is a stone that's going to be part of this great building and i don't know if we'll have time to get to it he talks about the temple of solomon how that the parts of the temples were built all across the world they were shaped it talks about if i can put it in categories perhaps for the sake of time he talks about two separate types of memorials talks about two separate types of memorials the first one that he talks about is joshua memorials and i want you to think about this for a time now here is the children of israel they have come from egypt and now they are in at the doorstep of of the promised land for them to cross now i want to remind you that the group that i will call uh a wilderness mentality that god had to get out of them all they did is they were reminiscent of the things that happened in egypt oh do you remember them garlic and do you remember that time and do you remember them onions do you remember this and do you remember they're forgetting about all that they trust them a perfect way for them to move it says that i want you to send the priest with the ark of the covenant first the priest takes the ark and they begin to walk and and as they walk the scripture says when the feet get into the water now when you go read you hear that they went to the river jordan when they went to jordan it was the time where it was overflowing but one of them says they must have gone at the wrong time i want you to think about that you get there and the river is all flooded when there are seasons where it's a little bit lower but you show up at the season when it's overflooded now they could have looked at it and said well you know what this is not the time let's go back but the word of the lord had gone before them and that's what i want us if this tonight we could just capture this i feel like i'll just it will just help us tonight now it's important we as the children of god when we sit here you have to know that you are not here by your own thinking the word went before you before you could be here the word had to come out of god's mouth he had to have pronounced it he had to have said it he have to have promised it he have to have projected it then if you go by the strength of what he protected nothing will stop on your way if you go by your own thinking you're gonna drown if you just go because everybody else is going you're not gonna make it so now they come and the priests get into the watering and now as the crossing joshua tells them it says now out of the 12 tribes i want each tribe each person from each tribe a representative of all of them that they come and come into the very depths of the the river when god had dried it up that they will pick up each one a stone and take it over they came and they pick up a stone one pick up a stone and for each tribe and they took and it says all about a thousand to two thousand two a million to two million they all crossed and they went and they took it to the place where they're gonna rest and this god said they said now i want you to build a memorial with these stones i want you to stack them up and build a memorial it says when your children will ask you that you will tell them what the lord had done now i want you to take that story and just put it to yourself this is god moving in the time where things seem to be impossible this is god moving at the season where it seems like we're never gonna get out of this situation this is god having moved in your life at the time where you thought this was the end of me this is god moving at a time where you knew within yourself that i'm done this is the end of me but yet is moving and then within the movement he's giving you a stone for you to carry a revelation for you to carry out and use that revelation for you to talk to your children about oh my brother my sister god is not built upon just teaching where we can come and teach each and every one god is a savior god is a healer god is this and god does this and says go on and be fine no god wants to give you a stone for yourself he wants you to build the memorial within yourself where you can come up here or where you can go anywhere stand there and say i'm not just talking about this bible but i'm here to let you know that this bible became this person in other words what is said in here he did it here a living memorial that's why i said all the other memorials where are they they're in the ground the only living memorial that stood up that men could never take away was the lord jesus christ and how did he live he says because i live you shall live also you are that memorial that god is building so he takes them and he takes the stone and and they build it and i began to think about peter when he said he said who do men say that i am now those that came out of welding when they came out of egypt when they came when they were there it says who the men said they could have said well you know what i was born in the wilderness my parents told me about how we crossed the red sea they said my parents told me how that god opened up the red sea and it was it dried it up he blocked it on both sides and we were able to walk my parents and everyone was able to walk on dry land and they came in and that's how we come here but you see that was not good enough and then it says what do you say that i am that was the apparent stone what is your stone what is your stone tonight god is not barbara tells us god doesn't have grandchildren he's not interested for us to tell the story over and over and over so he becomes good news no he the reason for the story is so that the ones that hears it seeks his own experience and experience the same god in the same power and that's why when we come together when we talk about those things it's not so much we it's us lifting god in out of history lifting him up out of whatever he's done and bringing me into your situation bringing him into your problem where you are to bring you to the understanding that the same god is here to do the same thing a new generation i came across my mama the wilderness the wilderness mentality my they could talk about the great god yeah in fact on the testimony on the sea he says they would talk and they would sit there and begin to talk it said what done it for you it says my mother told me about god the god of our father in the old testament how did he reign manna from heaven and it says i asked him i said well how did he do it does it mean jehovah has oven up there and and things up there how did he do even in the old new testament when he took bread he said does it mean he has often up their way he would take the bread and bake it and then cut it down and rain it down he said no jehovah is a creator what was he doing he was building memorial but as they began to tell those testimonies he says i heard what my parent says but when i saw him do it when i saw it with my own ass that settles it and my brother my sister don't settle on the stories don't settle on the stories don't settle on what this one says that one says that's wonderful to to comfort you but let that story become the reality for you without that we're just building up building up our own houses we're building up our own memorial the memorial of god is built by individuals that god himself has touched that's why the prophet could say it says what is the the what is the new birth he says it's jesus christ reveal himself to you personally why because then it becomes a memorial you know we could have received what we deserved we could have received what we deserve but oh god who's rich in mercy he came even when you were in your sin when you knew if right now for everything i've done i deserve to die when you knew within yourself that i don't deserve anything good but yet for his goodness but why did he do that i become a slave of his goodness it doesn't matter how down somebody is because i'm slave to his goodness all i could do is tell of his goodness you know you don't have to be like that you're like oh you don't understand my situation i'm worse off i'm gone and everything says well i was gone too but i met a god but i met someone who can take you out of your situation i met somebody who can stabilize you i meant someone who can come and take all of your mess all that you've messed up everything that you've destroyed he takes all of that and he makes sense of it now i want you to realize this memorial of joshua was not built when everything was calm and peaceful and nice where the river jordan was all the way down no when it was over flooded our testimonies it's not something well you know one day i was just asleep and and then i just woke up and the sun rose up just a different way anyway it was shining on the trees it just seemed a little different than i knew god was calling me you were running you were running you were trying to hide he was a hunting for you it was hunting for you in fact he made your life so miserable you looked you said god i come he came dragging you after whatever hole you were in i i hear testimonies even myself i remember i said if i don't do this i'm gonna die in fact the next word that comes out of your mouth is death you're like i don't even understand what i'm saying but that's what he had to do it's not you you've studied a bible and you've come to some conclusion that jesus christ is the son of god then i'll give my life to you they've been people baptized in the midnight 1 a.m 2 a.m in the morning what's wrong god is moving upon them and that same god is here the same bread as well sister i'm not talking about this so we can just say praise god for the past i want us to build a memorial within our own self to come to the place as we heard it this morning where our hearts is on fire when we come to a place it says i want every day that i walk up the same manifestation of this god of what he did what he promised i want my life to be a memorial of those things not the messenger of doom and gloom not one that can perpetrate whatever is happening in the world you know in this book brother branham talks about having visited i believe it was new york it says he went on the statue of liberty and it says there was a light there was there had been a storm and then it says but yet there was a bunch of dead sparrow all across and he couldn't understand he asked what happened it says well what happened is there was a light when the storm came instead of this pharaoh used the light for them to go hide the sparrows were trying to put out the light so they keep beating themselves against the light until the dead you can fight the word of god and survive people that criticize this they don't know what they're criticizing it's not made for them it says that he says if they became insane now if someone all they put all of their efforts they have nothing else to do they sit there they just read the message read the message so they can find mistakes that's signed to him for insanity to me all they do is trust trying to find what letter what scripture what word is not matching with that that's insanity see to them it's insanity but to us is life why because we've seen the same thing happening with us he says in joshua 24 verse 13 and he says and i have given you land which i had not bought labor oh i love this he says i have given you lamb land which thou did not labor and cities ye that have that that ye build not and ye dwelled in them and the vineyard and and olive yard which that he had not planted he had not did not uh the which he planted not that he'd eat he says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood in egypt and serve the lord in deuteronomy 6 and 10 it says and it shall be that when the lord thy god shall have brought you brought thee into the land which you swear unto thy father to abraham isaac and jacob to give thee this great goodly land the goodly cities which thou build us not and a house full of good things which thou fill it not and and wells digged which thou diggest not vineyard and olive tree which thou planted not it says when thou have eaten and be full then be where beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage what a promise houses we did not build vineyard we did not plant what was it it was exactly what he promised that it would give them a land filled with milk and honey god himself promised that it was going to give them for the sake of time i'll just move on what about him says he speaks about he says in joshua now his word was at stake paragraph 21 just as noah of old but joshua must cross over this river and he looked like he picked the worst time that he could ever that it could ever be that he could that he could ever be taught it was in the month of april and that's when the snow was melting in judea coming down through the mountain and and the old jordan is muddy and spread plumbing out into it says into the field water filled of jordan and you look like if it would have been the if it would have been if it would have been the mathematical of of education or scientist he picked the worst time in all the years to cross in all the years across jordan but god likes to take those kind of time to prove that he's god the a memorial is built on god proving that he's god it's not built upon you when you have worked so hard and then finally figured it out it's built on you looking and said i have ran out of all that i could do i have done all that i could it looks like it never worked then something happened you know for a fact that god did this it says in one man of god who believed god and know what god had promised has promised he's not afraid to do it because god will god will stick with his word just as certain as he is god and it says paragraph 22 and he says and when he said first take the ark and go forward and when those priests feet touched that jordan no matter how well she was and how she was swelling it would give way to god's eternal word it says for the word is in is in the ark jesus says now heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away so joshua knowing that his word must rest upon god's word that's the secret his word must rest upon god's word and he put god's word first oh it says wish you sick people here tonight we'll do that put god's word with your confession put your confession it says you believe it and set it out there and call those things which are not as though they were when you are it says then march then we are marching on do it do it that way god's word will take you through it's not as making it through and i want to say this why it has to be the word of god because the word knows things that are to be because the word knows what's before what's to come remember but matthew mentioned it this morning the the characteristic of a prophet is a seer is one who can see what's around the corner you can't he sees what's around the corner and therefore god empowers him to give his people his word that the word that they believe will tell them ahead of time before the corner comes what's going to come around the corner my brother my sister we know what's around the corner we know what to expect that's going to happen in the world we know all of that and as far as the bride of jesus christ we know what's around the corner we know that the rapture will be here any minute we know the adoptions of sun is happening right now we know that's what's around the corner we don't have to worry about anything as long as it's god's word god will stand upon his word but says in this message a memorial it says oh let me just jump ahead because of time he talks about this young man from england who was about to build a bridge he talks about him he says now he came when when something that everybody had rejected was afraid to do he took it he says why because he had a reputation and he put his reputation on the line he says there are two things that we needed he had a reputation and he had a vision reputation and vision in other words vision he could see before the breach could be built how everything was going to lay out he had a purpose in doing that and verbum says that the same way that jesus christ when he came if he if he didn't have a vision if he didn't know what's around the corner if he cannot perform that which he has said then god is not god then his reputation is on the line he comes this young man he says oh i love it it says one place it says he came and he put his reputation he says they said well people from america great engineers good architects they've received this job he says but i will take it he came in he went the same place that they all went he examined the river he looked at it and looked at it and said they all went to the same place they went down what they saw was sinned but whatever says he knew the way that god designed the earth that underneath that sand there had to be a rock somewhere my part of my sister he knew that i don't care how much sand there is if i continue to pump this sand out one day i'm gonna hit the rock somewhere in the bottom that's the same way it is with this message my father says it's not built upon the shifting sins of man the understanding of van or this or this that if you went in the bible if you went and read it one day god is gonna reveal it to yourself you're gonna hit a rock and once you hit a rock he will stabilize forever are built upon saints explanations of men and they heard this great art or i know believe oh i must be here they're headed over here that must be it but remember the church is not built upon men's understanding when he looked at peter it says upon this rock it's always the rock it was the rocket jordan it was the rock in the time of jesus it's a rock in the same time behold i lay a rock a stumbling block and a rock of offense he was not offended in me he who believes that it sits upon this rock what's a rock god choosing a man to reveal his word god using a man that he can come in this generation and turn his back against the audience and be accepted what is that that's the rock the revelation is i looked at the man but i saw jesus being manifested the revelation of who god is to you not to the group but to you oh my i know i'm running out a time but he talks about the other memorial it says about lot's wife now i thought it's very important i say this there's so many different things they said but just for the sake of time i'll just read few of them he says that wife started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome but but says that god used her as a memorial also the same way that the rocks that we just talked about in joshua was a memorial there is another memorial of lot's wife it says it says she wanted to see what others in the world are doing she wanted to have her hair cut because she looked back at the memorial of this grace who were greater it says and and she was a lady she wanted to be among the society in the city of sodom and and of gomorrah and sodom lost wife was carnal and these are part of i i just took they said so much of them i didn't have time to take all of it she started to it says she stands today in the field there as a pill of salt as a disgrace to those who pass she wanted to have a last look lot's wife she says at one place they say she merely look it's like it's not like she turned gum she merely it says oh my she merely looked she wanted to be in luxury it says one place her husband had had to become a great man in the city and and and one in this message she says she was just trying to be sociable and i want to say that to us because it's very important we take this seriously we are called to for a different memorial and the memorial that we are called to represent is cut us off of all those things we we can't be there and and still wants to keep all of our associations out of the likes of following all the instagrams and the the tick tocks and all of the the trains that's going on you know today it's one person standing on one foot tomorrow he has his shirt off and and all of that we're following now what memorial are you really trying to represent you say well it's christ but i still want to have fun the way the world is having fun you you go here but yet you you among people that are i'll tell you this you sit around with people that curse all the time you don't have to force it one day it's going to come out of your mouth i speak by experience you don't have you stay among people that are constantly negative negative or negative they're saying there's like this one day you don't have to you don't even have to have learned it you automatically will display it you you stay around you you be sociable enough with the world oh you know we just go in we're gonna just go play basketball and yet they are you know saying all kinds of things and all of that and and it's getting in you you say well as long as i don't participate at all don't say what they say i'm good you one day you'll find yourself repeating those same things and you're going to wonder what if you ever gone you went to a restaurant and sat in an ate you didn't even know what music was playing but one day out of nowhere your foot is moving you're like what's going on here and some tunes is us out of it in the subconscious not in the conscious the moment your conscience catches it you look at your foot it's where you've been oh let's be careful of what memorial we are presenting i'm saying this to encourage us so we know as our brother said this morning god has got everything under his control but what he wants us to do is to project the memorial that explains us here to do regardless of where i am i have to be mindful of what memorial i'm bringing forth now lot never thought he was going to end up in sodom and gomorrah when he left abraham he didn't pick up because if that was his desire he could have just moved there but all he took was for him to just have his tent pointed towards that direction today he saw the fireworks the next day he saw some light shows he saw some things and all of the sudden it caught his attention and maybe three months later the tank moved a little bit and the tank moved a little bit and the tank moved a little bit and then all of a sudden he was a governor a mayor you don't have to go and say i decide to go in the world i decide to do all of this no it's the association if it keeps continuing it's okay why aren't you living in victoria lives you too much trash too much association my mother my sister we are called but matthew said it this morning we are called to whoop the devil not to associate not to feel sorry for him we are called to kick the devil everywhere we meet him oh i don't know about you i like to see the devil getting kicked i like to see him being chased and and i'd like to see him without a place i wanted to see him out of all the children of god i want to see his deliverance is healing i want to see all of us i don't want to see the devil anywhere near the children of god but yet we are oh god oh god and god is looking and says i've given you my word there is no better weapon i can give you than my word is saying stand up clean yourself remember before they can go over jordan that joshua came in and said sanctify yourself this day get yourself ready the word of god is going before you but once the word of god is already pronounced i've given you the land we've been given the land why don't we have the land then amen sanctification cutting off the things of the world well then you know it's just a game you know it's just a football game it's just just a basketball game you know and then before you know it's five hours in great achievement oh it's not sinful it's not you know it's lawful i'm not cursing i'm in fact i i i'm not even playing with other people if i was playing with other people you'll say you know but i'm just playing with myself or playing with my brother you know so it's just us kick out the trash get consecrated give your life to something oh i don't know about you i want to see god i don't want to see myself i don't want to hear myself i want to see god moving and it's not to him it's up to us i want to be a memorial i want if somebody called me and said brother we need you to come here and pray i want when i show up i am certain that all heaven is with me i don't want to be one that was playing games and then they called me i go oh god oh god help me that's what we do we are in complete distraction then when something happens oh we want the blood we want this i mean we want everything we want it right there no he wants us to be ready we are in a battle he wants you to be ready at all times i have given you the land it's a memorial when your children ask you as your son ever ask you your daughter ask you something you have no idea how to answer because you haven't been practicing that way daddy aren't we supposed to be praying all day is i yeah son but you know daddy got a little bit busy something happening i want to be ready i want to run to it god what would you have me do what would you want me to do if he calls me or if he tells me now condemnation is always going to be there regardless of where it's always going to be there but i don't want to be to have something that i have caused by my own hands i want to do what my part is and let god do his part like we say people that are sanctified ready to take the battle ready to possess the land wherever it's needed people that are ready to speak the word if the musician could come god's building and god is building a memorial is god is building a church as a memorial a memorial of his sacrifice christ never come to earth paragraph 35 christ never come to earth to die in vain his death will not be in vain god's able for these stones to ray to rise children of abraham if people won't leave it they won't take it into under consider under consideration and realize what a great gift god is giving them god's is able of these stones to rise to raise children of abraham truly he will do that so i say today brothers the things to do is the word is the things to do it says the words that you say paragraph 31 how you you treat your brother what you do about christ will be an everlasting memorial you might you might have a fine home to live in to live to your children you might have you might have been working for some livelihood to live to your children but i'd rather leave them the word of god than anything else those houses will vanish that's perfectly right it says that's perfect you're right that's good i have nothing against it but don't do those minor things and leave the great things undone you see because the word that says the word will it says the house will perish the people will perish with it but god's word but the word of god will will raise them up in the last day and give them an eternal and immortal life again examine your own memorial remember it consists of what you do your works not what you say and i'm not saying this in condemnation so to say you don't have it you don't have it i said it's been given to us to do it the scripture says to them it's not given but to you it's getting given when something is given it means it's yours to possess to exercise when something has been given to you it means it's in your power in your authority casting out devil is not something we need to say oh god we need you to go do it no it's something that's been given to you if you sanctify yourself if you get yourself ready if you kick out the trial you have the authority to perform the work in fact it says one place oh i love it it says you speak the word and then it says the holy spirit is the enforcer he takes the word and he runs through the level and says get out of here why because the owner is calling for it amen let's stand oh i say he said he had a vision before a man can make a repetition he has to have a vision of what he's doing oh blessed be the lord that's the reason he says you are it says there are they are in heaven there is in heaven to go to that's the reason we can have a reputation as a christian we know what material is in the building that's right the blood of jesus jesus christ is in the building that's right he stained the blood has washed away all sins he took me from the alley of hell and made me a servant then i believe in him so i pass from death to life and every believer has done as did that because he asked because that they had to go that they that they got confidence and they believe in the great builder in the in this great architect the process it says paragraph 43 says now when the man did this the first thing that he did to be sure that he was right he went down and he said now before we get the bridge to start started we got to go to the solid foundation we've got to go we've got to go he knew that down beneath

he preaches that evening preaches desperation if you want the token if you want the token life if you want an everlasting memorial if you want christ the everlasting memorial if you want to be a lively stone we got to get into desperation but but sadly you know brother branham talks about how we're we're so slothful and dilatory it takes tragedy or it takes trial it takes things to get us into a place of desperation but as our brother was ministering i don't i don't want it to have to take tragedy and all of a sudden you know the call comes across the line like my brother was saying and i said i'm like oh my goodness lord uh clean me up sanctify me i'm i'm unworthy to go pray for that brother i may i ain't able to run over there and play and and you're you're going approaching uh

lord just just and and and you're you're having a battle battle and fight through all that but oh god's wanting a bride to come to a place of maturity uh this everlasting memorial to where you're so in tune and so in harmony with the lord that if i could say it this way you're in desperation every day for god to speak to you oh the prophet was so sensitive and in tune that just even even the wind
