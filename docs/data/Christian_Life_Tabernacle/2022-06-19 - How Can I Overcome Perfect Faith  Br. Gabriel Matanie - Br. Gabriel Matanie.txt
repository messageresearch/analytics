[Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] and god bless you this morning let's all sin and sing that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] as is lovely [Music] why is [Music] [Music] is the sweetest name this morning as we gather we just want to worship him and praise him and give him all that we have amen amen is revived by the might this morning let's just put our heads our gracious father lord we're so thankful to be gathering your presence lord and father just lifting up your name and showing your goodness in our lives and everything that you've done oh god and we invite you even now lord that you may come and take control over the service and father everything now will be done o god and from the songs to the preaching of the word father let you just your spirit come and walk in this isles lord to answer the needs of your people lord and father to touch the afflicted to heal the sick and father that's what the gospel is for to bring the good news to us this morning we commit ourselves in the service into your hands and invite you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen good morning let's go ahead and turn to psalm 119 this morning i know about you but i've been enjoying going through this is one of my favorite psalms uh it's a work to read through it but uh i really uh really enjoy it we're gonna turn to uh verse 73 and read that section this morning and as i was reading that this week you know there was a couple statements that stuck out to me as i was reading that unusual statements and in verse 74 as david speaking he says they that fear thee will be glad when they see me because i have hoped in thy word and then once again in verse 79 let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have known thy testimonies you know they seem like bit odd statements you know is this david asking that you know could i be a center of attention can i be popular you know almost seems like a self-serving or a self-exalting quest you know it seems strange that david would have a desire when we know that very often there's a reproach that comes with this life with this word for one to be asking that people would be attracted to him you know what jesus taught and many times with the disciples john 15 19 he said if he were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of this world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you so we've kind of been taught to expect to find ourselves at odds with a lot of people that the things that we believe the way that we walk are not going to agree with most folks that you know we expect incompatibility with many people around us even family members we expect to bear a reproach for the word so it might seem a bit strange that david is asking for something different but if you look closely at the way he asks this his desire was in spite of the fact that all that might be true that there would be a certain type of person that's attracted to him drawn to him be glad in his presence you know he describes it in verse 79 as they that fear the lord those that have known thy testimonies a special class of people his prayer is that they would be attracted to him and be made glad so because of his relationship with the word it says because i have hoped in thy word because of the relationship he had with the word there might be a certain class of people that would be attracted by him think about that prayer you know there's a maturity in the relationship with the word that takes us beyond separation from the world you know beyond bearing the reproach and those things are part of the walk but there's a maturity that where you get to a place where life begins to attract life yes life begins to impart life you know we know the word has an effect you know jesus describes this the condition as if you abide in me and i abide in you that whole section as jesus is speaking to his disciples in his kind of his last hours about a new way of living a new image being reflected but you know while the word is our anchor or hope there's a maturity that we seek that we desire that ultimately we get to a place where life is attracting life just as all life any life out in even though the the natural world there's a certain point of maturity that they all life reaches where it begins to attract other kinds of life and produce life and it's the same with the maturity with a word relationship there's a point we're able to attract like life and impart life and this was david's prayer you know paul described it in second corinthians of a condition where we have an epistle written in our hearts that are read of all men all men worldly men and godly men you know and second corinthians 4 speaks more of you know the effect of that word just shining a light out of our life with the daily walk that we have manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god that's the calling to get to such a condition with the word that an image is reflected from us that begins to attract life and impart life that was david's prayer lord made though because of my relationship with the word may i get to that place where like life is attracted to me where i'm quickening life to others making them glad you know it says in matthew 5 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you know sometimes if we're not careful we confuse witnessing with preaching right we make it all about a preaching activity or we make it more about the work that we do rather than the work he does and the most effective witnessing is when the image of the word is so reflected in your daily life that it begins to attract like life and impart life this was david's prayer more than just you know may i understand the word more more than you know can i get to a theological place more than can i have religious services or operate a church but can i get to a place where i have such a relationship with the word or i've submitted myself to the word to such a such a situation such a relationship that even without me knowing there's an image reflected from me that's attracting a certain kind of life that was david's prayer you know and i i was reading that and thinking lord that's my prayer as well you know it's not unusual for people to question you know what's my purpose what's my ministry what's my goal submit yourself to the word let that word have an effect so that it begins to attract life that's the calling they that fear thee will be glad when they see me because i have hoped in thy word so let's read that section of psalm 119 this morning just those eight verses starting at verse 73 thy hands have made me and fashioned me give me understanding that i may learn thy commandments they that fear thee will be glad when they see me because i have hoped in thy word i know o lord that thy judgments are right and that thou and faithfulness has afflicted me let i pray thee thy merciful kindness be for my comfort according to thy word unto thy servant let thy tender mercies come unto me that i may live for thy law is my delight let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely with me without a cause but i will meditate in thy precepts let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have known thy testimonies let my heart be sound and thy statutes that i be not ashamed amen god bless you have your seats [Music] oh there's a country far beyond

cement passes the thirteenth cement pokemon uh last week was a very turbulent week a week for me i was a little demoralized on a stream of thinking hello invented there was an inner voice that that that said to me do you remember the the legend of the uh the speckled bird stan the speckled bird was a special vote for barbara during the crucifixion of the lord jesus christ that this bird was trying to remove the nails out of him but when i was born olier said to us instead of that buried for him to to cry again this time he came to sing with great joy it said that you always have to be joyful and that joy that brandon talks about it's not like the joy like you find in the world basket because everybody has joy melancholy but the joy that brother branham is talking about they said i'll be there early morning to pick you up so we can come to church that's the system of the devil he will come and try to take out of you all the unction of the lord jesus christ and what he tries to do is to move you away from your brothers he will keep you away from church but one brother did he told me that he's going to be there to pick me up to come to church and then i was i was really consoled within my soul that's why i want to express my joy with this song yeah this song is in many languages like as i have not uh come to speak english well i'm going to speak i'm going to sing it in portuguese but the symphony is the same allah says it's an ordinance given by the reverend william branham to be always be joyful georges the symphony is exactly the same [Music] [Music] foreign

he's certainly here to answer to the needs of his people amen brother andrew if we could just come and take these needs before the lord and the brothers that are taking the offering see if you could

to your perfect will we're so thankful that we can trust in your wonderful hand this morning we ask you to bless us this morning and jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated this morning certainly nice to be in the house of the lord in it amen i was thinking of how hot it is outside and and i just thought you know what we're going to a place that's not so hot i think what's happening after the rapture the lord's going to take all the believers from the earth and he's going to send everybody else to texas to spend the time but you know that's that's just how it is we just want to kind of give you a little update on things where we're you know we're sorry you have to deal with the parking the way that it is um i talked with my engineer the other day said david he said have courage he said you're in the ugly stage he says in the ugly stage is the hardest and and i you know i saw people scraping mud off their shoes and and uh you know those things so i do recommend that if in our present parking situations that you might uh ladies you might want to wear flats versus uh those other things that i i preach against but um anyway you've heard the expression being stuck in the mud well we certainly don't want that to happen to you but we've we worked out some things i wanted to thank all the brothers that came out yesterday and put their shoulder to the wheel we had some walls that we had built over the years to keep the water off the neighbors property and and because of the new configuration and the new drainage plan we had to remove those walls and everybody just jumped right in there and we got those faults down and and jonathan you look a little tired today man and were you aching at all the other night now you did good those blocks are heavy and the brothers grabbed them and stacked them and did everything so i i want to really extend my appreciation to you all we'll get through it and and it's going to be a hard year ahead um we it's going to be a lot of difficulty in labor but we've we're we've just turned a big corner this weekend and so i hope maybe in a month or so by the grace of god we'll have some of the parking lot in and it'll be it'll be good for you today's father's day and uh so happy father's day to everybody i'm grateful that you know the lord granted me children and that they've all found their way to the lord that's a blessing so good blessing to each of you also this is the 15th anniversary of brother jackson being a deacon for us for 15 years so we're appreciative of that this morning amen so i think jackson believes 15 years is enough for anybody i said oh well i can certainly agree with that i said that's how you feel about five years being a pastor you know but you go on and why why you go on you love the people and you love what the end of everything's going to be so don't get your eyes on this world keep your eyes above because we are leaving here amen and we want to we want to find the last one wherever he might be that when that last one comes in we're going out so lord richly bless you this morning we have a special speaker with us this morning i'm going to have cosman introduce him to you and explain the relationship that he has with our assembly and i really think you'll enjoy the the word of god this morning and the simplicity of the word of god so brother cosby if you and gabriel would come and you could introduce him this morning and we trust it god bless you thank you god bless you amen without your faith thank you amen praise the lord um you know we um we've known brother gabriel since um last year i would say maybe june when we started conversating together and so um well me and matthew had went last year to romania he took us around and he's a pastor down there in a rod and you know he's been serving this message for a really long time and we know we get on the other side of the country as you guys have most of you guys have seen the mission report that we've put together and he held his arms out and loved us and took us around and and you know just showed the love of god you know the bible says that that's how we'll know one with another is by that divine love that we can share with one another and when you can see that spirit just uniting with you and you know just within a few months that i've known him it feels like i've you know i've known him for a really long time so um he's he's a wonderful brother he's got children and and so me and matthew are scheduled to go back out there this year in august we're i'm gonna be holding a youth meeting and he's putting it together for everyone and so we're just expecting god to move you know all of us are just you know vessels and so we just make ourselves available and and god does the rest you know we do the man part like you know we always heard over this pulpit but let god do his god part which is eternal it's in his mind and so may the lord bless you i'm going to turn it over to brother gabriel amen amen amen i want to greet you everyone in this morning i will try to go slow because maybe my the english is not my mother tongue language so i trust that the lord will help you understand we believe in pentecost and we know that the pentecost they speak in their own language and they understood so yes i am here with my precious wife as my best friend sister mary and [Music] we are we have been invited here by brother cosmi his uh the family came from our country and uh last year is true we we had brother cosmin and brother matthew in our country and we traveled around and visited churches message believers and really it was a blessed time and many have been encouraged and this year we already have our 16-year youth camps in romania and these years we we also had privileged we have brother metro and by the course mean back and we we are looking forward we are pleased also to meet your pastor and we are such a wonderful vision in the message for the message and we felt a lot of hospitality which is also our traditional our national i say gift we have we are very hospital hospitalia we we like to receive people and we felt the same thing here we have been very much blessed in the family of brother stefan and his wife and also of course very much blessed and welcomed in the house of brother cosman which is a great thing it's not easy and we are aware that when a guest comes brings joy two times when they come there when they go this is amen so blessed be the name of the lord we don't want to take too much time but i want to bring greetings from believers from our church back home spoken of tabernacle and we believe that the spoken word has to have a tabernacle and i enjoy also to to see that you're you are christian life which is the token christian life literal life of jesus christ yeah so we are not just saying we are manifesting it be the name of the lord so if you don't mind to stand because you know introduction sometimes has only social social things informalities but what we bring us what we need really what we need is a is the word of god amen so maybe we can bow the heads for a word of pleasure bless your heavenly father we are so blessed and privileged to be together gather together around the world the revealed world the open world anointed world so we want to draw power from strength from your father we ask you to take every spirit under your control anoint us and let something be said for your glory let us to step aside and go beyond the veil let your spirit speak from the pillar of fire because we believe that he is here whatever whatever the message is preached your prophet have said the pillar of fire is there so let us be attentive to stay in line stay in the world and preach the message to be an echo of your prophecy from this day we ask you to bless each one of us and anoint us with a special anointing we commit the service and everything will be said and done for your glory in jesus christ's name and let the bride say amen amen amen revelation chapter 3 verse 21 this morning in mark 11 verse 22 revelation 3 so i was inspired yesterday in the how you call it men's fellowship men's breakfast okay so i want to summarize what this brother here and the other brothers have said so because i didn't i was so much blessed to hear the revelation you have how how the the maturity and the way you understand and perceive the message so i put together a you know a subject in this morning what you have spoken yesterday i want to tell the people what what happened what what was going on amen so i hope we will not be upset to you know say what you already said and mother matthew and all of revelation chapter 3 amen are you happy in this morning you are baptized with the holy ghost amen verse 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even i saw i also overcame and i'm sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear yes sir let him hear what the spirit said under the churches amen mark chapter 11 verse 22. and jesus answering faith unto them answer them have faith of god this is the original greek not in god everybody have faith in god even the devil but have faith of god may the lord have this blessing for the reading of the world we can take our seats while i am standing hallelujah somebody say hallelujah we are born to be an overcomers amen the message didn't made us bright actually the message revealed who we were from the beginning we are the eternal thoughts manifested in flesh what once was pleroma in the fullness in jesus now is in many members body amen so what we need today is not another another church service but rapturing faith because we are as the pastor have just said we are going to live here hallelujah when we see the signs all around us we are ready to live here so first of all we must say so my topic my subject in this morning which will be how can i overcome how can i overcome and then the answer and the sub topic is perfect faith so first of all we must say that the message is revealed in his own titles you only need to be able to read the titles to follow the titles and the message is revealed in its own titles somebody say titles you're good so the message is using tapes and papers to reveal the message but the message actually is a person and his bride the message is revealing the bride groom and the bride so brother brennan preaches this message two times once in 60s and then in 63. so first he entitled what it takes to overcome all unbelief coma our faith so first time when he preached this message he preached it in this way what it takes to overcome all the unbelief our faith not our faith your faith made you well if you look in the bible you find out that not not the faith in me but you your faith you already have it in you so then in 63 brother branham takes again this subject and he split it into in the morning he he preached how can i overcome not how not how can we how can we this is for the pentecost but how can i it is i she is him how can i overcome in this designation so the blood is not we it is i can i say man i closed the service already because he said what is it there you already see what i meant so you you you understand what dutch want to say in what he says so you you take what i meant what i want to say not how i say because i say wrong so bt be not afraid it is i my i like that so it's a question how can i overcome to make us think and look for the answer so the prophet will preach how can i overcome and then and the answer was in the evening message the message is in the evening light the message was not in the morning but the answer what is the evening message perfect faith so the answer is i can come over by perfect that word in greek is de leos which means mature complete in hebrew is shalom you must be shalom how my father in heaven is shalom so how can overcome by shalom faith perfect match or complete revelation is the way the great i overcome today so we just we just read it in in revelation chapter 3 verse 21 he that has an ear so we want to to to look for some some answers in the message how can we overcome to come over how can i overcome so he the first things we we need to think about is he that has an ear so the first absolutely mandatory necessarily to overcome is to have an ear not a natural ear he don't speaking about the people that only the people they can hear are bright what is an ear the ear speaking is the gene of god that settles it this is the foundation this is where we come we start to build now so a gene of god a predestinated soul he then had a prayer i can read it in this way in this abraham hammock age he that have a predestinated soul a gene from the loins of elohim he can hear let him here not she not you let him so who is him it is god in you listening it is god speaking to god it is eagle speaking to the eagle it is attributed to the attribute is the eternal to eternal can you say praise the lord hey man so caught i skipped i became oh i didn't read this part no no i i just i just keep one quote so every code is very important so code number one so in this message perfect faith in the second paragraph the prophet says i like that always i had yesterday when i wrote down i had the jubilee i had the revival the rapture in face struck me look what says here but abram refers here that somebody need a pair of glasses not the pentecostal glasses but message glasses to can drink and see the way is on his pulpit look at here there is a pair of glasses here that somebody has lost if you lose the vision the message vision there is a glasses for you and being found in the church somebody when they went home they they forgot they have message glasses in the church but somebody don't take it with them they leave it in the church so when they come in the church you know they take the glasses they speak like they behave like they seem like but when they go home they you take it with you huh hey man you know i how i get older sorry brother how i get older you know i started to need glasses so i get some correction here in america so to don't forget the glasses at home to don't come with my own interpretation i see that the only thing is they don't see that i have inglis or you know samsung lost his eyes pentecostal age prophet age but something happened while sansone was grounding working to defeat the students the hair started to grow it was not something that he could perform it was not something that he could do it was a law and while he was there mocked and persecuted the hair which is the covenant he was born with a covenant he could not manipulate it is you know god was in control of it and his hair started to grow when his hair started to grow the mind of christ came in him hallelujah so this is what is going on the mind of christ came in the bride so if anybody if they belong to you well they are here on the platform message glasses i like that can you say praise the lord code number two how can i overcome how can i overcome in bright form notice overcome paragraph 10 7. 107 everything perfect you know i'm a jew and the problem is when i get under an anointing i became more jew so i'm sorry this is the way i am so uh how notice overcome notice observe pay heed look the god that is in the church no brother is the goddess is in you elohim he said the word of god came to elohim no to singular elohim means plurality attributes so all that the world came to them you never prayed god sent elijah to my way to my father you never prayed just he came because the world came to elohim by his grace you are one of them yes amen hallelujah i am happy to be one of them nobody bought me nobody take me out that god as is in you is greater than the one that is in him in the world the god of this world is not as great as the god of heaven which is in you can you say amen i just called the prophet is not my own thoughts it's god's thoughts so he said that the god of heaven jesus could say who is the son of man he that is in heaven and in is on earth you can say the same thing today the god of heaven is in heaven but of by the same time the god of heaven is in you hallelujah no more than darkness can stand in the presence of light look the next paragraph that one that is in you is or in hebrew is light not a not only a revelation is a little button of light you have been born when your mama and papa have a little baby already elohim we go beyond predestination judas was predestinated the first work of grace that the lord made to us was election actually he torn up himself he took something from the pillar of fire and he places in the wall of jericho and you say praise the lord he places something in you that is a part of him himself that's why when you saw the pillar of fire you recognize you were original amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so and then he said the one that is new that lied you never received that light you have been born with that light that's why the prophet said in the future home you have never be saved in one day you just recognized that you have you have been in him in his thoughts before the foundation of the world you you have been already in his plane of revealing himself and this is what is going on after the seven church edges has ended this is what they go what is going on the marriage of the lamb has come third poll seven thunders invisible union the heavenly bridegroom has returned there is a mystery of the returning of the pillar of fire and this is happening it is it is not a public show this is in your room what it is with the people that don't have a house this is your heart something invisible is happening right now the pillar of fire is knocking wanting to have spiritual relations intimate relationship with you and when you open your heart you can say the marriage has come let her let us rejoin and be happy oh hallelujah he that is in you is great and that he that is in the world but if you are living above that he that is you know has laid you above the darkness amen call number three that's the way it is with to all believers are you blessed i watch the i watch that when the time is gone i sing a song and i sit down you know you need to be polite there's the way is to all believers they are a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus which is the word made flesh which is you do you believe that you are the word you know the difference between us and other people is when we read the bible we read the message we don't read about somebody else we recognize ourself in it we read about us the people don't understand because jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say this and they say you talking riddles we don't understand this if we have time today or maybe afternoon we are going to take the riddles of the message parables of the message we you know we have parables in the message modern parables i like that hallelujah so this so so how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in so we invite you in this morning let's go in his world is right here it's just a step ahead let's enter in and let's start to live there to be a prisoner of this message i am a prisoner of this message i cannot take anymore my decision i have to filter everything through the message actually goes farther i am the message the message became romanian flesh hallelujah glory glory glory it will be a great parade the world became flesh the message became flesh you were flesh and the flesh became the word every fiber i was so happy when i see the testimony of brother hickerson nine years old brother hickerson what is the message for you and he could not harvest the broader message is heavy fiber of my body we can say the same thing today the message is every fiber i said right why are looking to me like that because you say you must eat in the fight the brother brah said i never meant i need to preach and the people listen we are preaching together here i say something that you like it and you say amen say i believe it amen i'm happy i knew it before you just said it i had a chance to say to you you just already know it hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord so in wind and when when we enter to hit sometimes i don't understand my own writing which is good because you became dependent addicted to his spirit so we enter to his word when we enter in his word we have his faith so let's put it this way how can i overcome perfect revelation because faith is revelation that was a good boy gabriel i like it so i celebrate myself yeah a perfect revelation how can i overcome perfect revelation it is his faith it is not my faith it is not my intellect or peter's faith blessed be the name of the lord ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 says hallelujah i try to make you happy brother brown said you cannot be happy enough feel you are blessed with the holy ghost till you are happy happy enough verse 11. amen 4 11. and he have he gave some apostles and some prophets plural and some evangelists and some pastors plural and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of faith not my faith his faith he is he believing in me and the knowledge of the son of god we all have to have his faith his revelation we have to come how i can overcome by his revelation that's why in mark 11 verse 22 we read mark 11 verse 22 have faith of god so actually is his revelation number two adding to the gene of god to the little light that already god god places in you dividing himself towarding up parts from the pillar of fire placing in your heart adding these his revelation we are not living by sight we live by revelation in his revelation in you is that overcome and this is the place where the new bible his wife gave to him opened he gets a new bible quote number four amen hallelujah but when i opened the bible the first little reborn in the bible was a very strange things where it was was when solomon dedicated the temple of god and the glory of god was so glad the shekinah glory the srina in the building till the priest couldn't even minister and the next thing the next string was laying where ezra ezra was the the man who put together the old testament the canon of the old testament ezra returned and dedicated the temple and the third little market that my wife had gotten me and put it in the bible i like that not knowing with my name on it was lying laying mark 11 22. she just struck it in the bible stuck it in the bible and that's where it was and that if you say to this mountain be moved and all of you know when the scripture what that the scripture was in my mind you tape people that's when those squirrels came right into that exactly third pool so that makes me to remember matthew 16. maybe we can open material amen 16. 16. matthew 16 13 we we realized that jesus was for jesus was important to realize if they know who i am to know who is he so what when happened is in matthew 16 we find out it was in bania spring in caesarea philippi the place of philip philippe the brother of herodis so if you have been in israel this is the place they call it the gate of hell that was the pond the idol panic coming from that god the enter is in hell and jesus little his little body stood there and then he turned to his disciples asking them who the men say that i the son of man i the son of man am and then he turned to his disciples they then they answered verse 14 you are john the baptist you are elias elijah in jeremiah jeremiah to bring big dark of the covenant so you are john the baptist you know they are still john the baptist follower today sixty thousand they baptized with alone and they see that jesus was the fourth prophet they have more connection with john johanna the levi the priest johanna was the priest was a kohanim a levite john the baptist and they believe that joe the baptist was the main thing and they are still baptizing themselves for repentance and they speak about jesus jesus was a false prophet are you elijah elijah who has to come to present the messiah or are you jeremiah who bring back out of the covenant and jesus said unto them but whom say you that ego amy a here i shared a here i am who do you say but who say ye you see the answer is in the question so for the disciple he makes it simple he give the answer in the question praise the lord hallelujah he is very interested that we get it and he make it simple they say we have such a wonderful message amen how can i how can i overcome first john chapter 5 verse 4 how can i overcome first we need the general god next we need to have his faith first john chapter 5 verse 4. whatever is born of god hallelujah we are born of the world whosoever is born of god whosoever is born from above god has to be my father god has to be your father whosoever is born of god born of god overcomes the word and this is the victory that overcoming the world his faith is our faith his revelation is our revelation luke 18 verse 8 jesus never after 17 after the apocalypses after he came down from the mountain chapter 18 he's he says something straight striking verse 18 says nevertheless when the son of man cometh he was speaking from this day because he was there the son of god manifesting now he was speaking from a time when he is going to manifest again as the son of man he was two thousand years for son of god the holy spirit but now for a short time he is manifest he was manifesting in our generation in the way of a son of man the next time he will be the son of david but he was asking him here about the time we are living in and he put a question nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find he didn't come to bring he come to find he come to bring the faith that he already placed in the seed in sohora in the sea to bring it to manifestation to squeeze it to bring it to life hallelujah to discover faith to discover revelation to make you free you will know the truth no means intimate relationship like husband and wife not ginosko no not oida not that you learn something but to have a relationship with this message hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah that's why we are back in the book of matthew he agrees verse 16 and sibo and peter answered unto unto him and said tower christ the son of the living god simon simon what means simon is he that can hear but his nature was very wavering unstable unsure how can he build his church over a wavering greed how can he build me on on such an instable nature in five verses you will find that he is called in the different names and simon peter answered tower christ the son of the living god and jesus jesus answered he as he blessed us so what is blessed nobody can curse simon jonah means dove the son of the dove the son of the holy spirit you simon the son of jonah blessed that town because not flesh and blood revealed it not even me not even jesus revealed it for you had a straight channel with the same god that jesus had he was not even baptized with the holy ghost he was not even born again but he have the same channel as jesus because jesus says i didn't reveal it to you he said not even flesh in your spirit but my father which is in heaven have the same connection with you as he has with me oh glory hallelujah amen then the word turns onto him and said so when you have that channel born with that channel is identified who you are the word when you identify the word the word is identifying you i cross in toward peter this is the real name in the name's book of life you are not simon a wavering sheep a man that is stable but you are a rock you are the little rock you are all little rocks then i will build my house and i will come and set them and dwell among them hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i am on them i am one of them and you are one of them nobody made me yes i was born like that we are not here to conquer to bring more people in we are here only to be the servants there we are just showing them the way welcome home welcome home the eagles came home nobody can come only what the father because where in the wedding he came down with a mere certificate that little book is the marriage certificate and my name is on that where from where you know that brother because when he preached these mysteries oh something in me that i could say amens it is me and this is the way i could see my name in the latest book of life it is not written level it is not little cosmic stefan but while he was preaching these mysteries it was calling my name that's why we are here this morning because our name is written in the late book of life and we had the prophet in the land and he said that says the lord when this mystery are preached i can say they said that says the midnight cry not the margo midnight cry is the message of dawah they try to copy you see actually the spirits of the we are the real pentecostals but the spirits of pentecost they try to push in the message to we are the real baptist because we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ by the spirit of the baptist tries to come in we are the real later let's say the bride of christ in the later days you see by the spirits coming also try to we are the real catholics because we are the universal church we are the real jew the prophet said that a real jew is a predestinated seed of god i have the quote you see by the spirit son hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so the words turn unto him and say tower peter your name is the lamest book of life because you have this revelation hallelujah when you identify the word the word identifies you you are christ and you are peter this message is from the lord and you are his bride hallelujah how can i overcome paragraph chapter five are you still with me we can give candice at the end hallelujah i hope you prayed for me say brother i heard the brother from romania is coming his english is not so good lord anoint him such in such a way then i can understand so praying for you or praying for you for me you are praying for you that you can get what i mean amen otherwise i have my translator here i look for my glasses message glasses hallelujah how can i overcome perfect faith paragraph 63 you see how perfect fit 63 1963 you see perfect fact 63 rebecca lift up her eyes who is he who is he is my master so she came down from the camels now it was the time of the third pool when isaac the promised son will throw there in her mother's tent sarah attend where she tried to produce you cannot produce the promiser he's a promiser you cannot make me bride i was born bright in his due season now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word or they might give you power amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith also you can have a lot of gifts but not faith the seventy was fundamentally perfect by they made signs and water with our faith this is what is going on today we see a lot of movement in the message let's go back to the charismatic movement let they prove that we are the seventies had it and the prophet said they didn't have faith that they had signs and wonders right it will be a pentecostal move you cannot feed the bride with pentecostals this mystery divine reveal will literally turn this is for me brother bill this is for you too yes amen this mysteries revealed we literally turn restore because we need restoration back to the faithful that's why we can read the message right when we turn it right but jesus he has he was the world and he had faith that what he said will happen so i see that everybody is happy when we speak about jesus ah he did it he did what he said will happen right jesus said we believe it he has faith with his power how he did it he said i can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was and we all agree yes jesus he lied he was the world he was yeah he relied he know that he was the world and he had faith in god who made him the world he was god the word and there was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his position we are coming to something now shall we stop now he's something more didn't it so he knowed what he was because the scripture he said he was this and the years every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he will be i'm finished now you know i'm polite hallelujah it's better say come over the game than to say you know i'm under anointing i'm different when i come out i tremble you know but wait a minute anointing i am me yessiree hallelujah therefore 65. he relied upon what god what god made him and if he did that [Music] let's read together because you know better than me three can't we rely upon what god made us believe us can you say praise the lord yes we can brother branham yes we can rely upon what god made us believers you never became a believer you always have been a believer that's why the message came to you normally i will kiss the message but this is an ipad say i will i will kiss the bible he's the son let us stand hallelujah amen hallelujah gracious heavenly father we say thank you for this wonderful spirit and that you place is something in us that is coming from you and we rely upon that you made us our children you made us your bride we are so thankful from 8 billion people you just came to us we never prayed lord said elijah we never prayed lord you know make me send me the message we never knew about it but because you you had something with us we are the widow of sarepta we keep your voice alive and the lo of your voice became flesh and we are the voice make flesh bless this wonderful congregation the predecessor the sea the elect of god bless the pastor the ministry the plans they have and let us lift up our heads our redemption the rapture the changing of our body romans 8 has come be blessed and we thank your father in jesus name amen amen amen hallelujah that's a big gospel right there how simple it is but how true you know when you even your faith is what you overcome by you overcome by your revelation it says a kingdom cannot be divided against itself you know what i mean so you if if you don't accept the fact that you're elected you don't accept the fact that god chose you and elected you and put your name on the lamb's book of life then it's the world fighting the world that's right and that there's you'll never get anywhere like that but if you can accept your position like our brother said except the fact that he chose you to carry the seed he chose you to manifest his message he chose you he put your name on the book of life and all that we need to pray for is pray for revelation that's right pray that that's revealed to you because what is revelation it's faith and then that's your victory even the faith right and what that he made you and and i'll tell you we fight things we don't need to fight and we struggle against things i'm the worst person in that in the whole wide world you know what i mean because i try to prove to myself that i'm a believer and when i fail in that then i get discouraged but when i accept the fact that he chose me he didn't have to do it but he did it amen i didn't seek him he sought me he found me he made me to be this he put me here in this age he revealed to me this word that i'm that that word might be revealed through me to others that some other person out there might also find out that that that seed in there that they might find what they've been looking for they might find that identity your identity because the scripture says it's from faith to faith the gospel goes from faith to faith from revelation to revelation from light to light amen and the very revelation coming alive in you will bring that revelation alive in somebody else and that's what he came into the world to do amen what a what a beautiful thought this evening or this morning it says i'm anxious to find out the riddles and the message not very many titles get me interested because you know i got my first thought was i didn't know there was any riddles in the message so i think if you want to come back this evening i
