[40:19] that happens
[40:20] whether i wanted to or i don't it's
[40:23] god's plan
[40:25] um i woke up one day it was probably
[40:28] about two weeks ago and it's a sign on
[40:30] my wall and it says um
[40:31] get up time waits for no one so go
[40:33] attack it
[40:34] and um it's about five in the morning um

[40:47] and all the things that has happened in
[40:50] our life or the things that are going to
[40:51] happen in our life and
[40:53] just looking forward to the future and
[40:55] um he tells me about this time
[40:57] where he was imperfectly aligned
[41:00] with what he needed to be you know he
[41:02] was in the right spot at the right time
[41:04] he didn't know he was there

[41:07] reason why i'm here and
[41:08] he tells me about the situation or
[41:09] whatever and i tell him about my
[41:11] situation
[41:12] and as we're passing through this light
[41:14] there's a truck

[41:18] probably like two seconds to
[41:20] visually see the truck the truck hits us

[49:14] amen amen if you have your bibles
[49:18] uh i'd like to turn over to saint john
[49:21] the 11th chapter
[49:23] i'd also like to just play a
[49:26] a small portion this morning i i just
[49:29] feel
[49:30] like easter would be a good day to
[49:31] listen to a little bit of the
[49:33] messenger amen and
[49:36] and but
[49:40] i love these scriptures and and
[49:44] you know how it is many of you have
[49:45] expressed this to me and
[49:47] and we've expressed it to one another
[49:50] that
[49:51] how that you'll listen to a message and
[49:55] and it really blesses you and then maybe
[49:58] it kind of uh goes back
[50:01] on your shelf or or
[50:04] to wherever that you would store it and
[50:07] then
[50:08] you come back the season comes back
[50:11] and you come back to it again
[50:14] and all of a sudden it's like something
[50:16] that's so brand new
[50:18] and so fresh and and you think
[50:21] wow it's all underlined in everything
[50:25] and sure enough you'll find two or three
[50:27] paragraphs there
[50:28] that are just standing out to you that's
[50:31] not underlined yet
[50:33] and uh and it's just so real well
[50:36] if this this last week is i've been
[50:40] reading the easter seal it's just been
[50:43] just really fresh to me and it's
[50:47] it's been a great challenge to me
[50:51] what it really means to have a
[50:54] resurrected life but
[50:56] we just like the fellowship this morning
[50:59] uh just i i don't really have a lot of
[51:02] notes just maybe read a few things and
[51:04] just
[51:05] really talk about what it is that we
[51:08] really have well let's read these great
[51:10] scriptures here
[51:14] and starting in the 21st verse of the
[51:16] 11th
[51:17] chapter of the gospel of saint john
[51:22] the 11th chapter and
[51:25] then martha
[51:28] then said martha unto jesus lord
[51:33] if thou hath been here
[51:36] my brother had not died
[51:40] but i know that even now whatsoever
[51:44] that will ask of god god will
[51:48] give it thee
[51:51] and jesus said unto her thy brother
[51:55] shall rise again
[51:59] and martha said unto him i know
[52:02] that he shall rise again in the
[52:05] resurrection
[52:07] at the last day now when jesus
[52:10] you know in the 23rd verse jesus said
[52:12] unto her thy brother shall rise again
[52:15] it sounded like the words of comfort
[52:20] that we give one another at a funeral
[52:24] you know i i'm so sorry but he'll rise
[52:27] again
[52:28] you know but this was something
[52:30] different
[52:32] and so now he says to her he says
[52:36] thy brother shall rise again and martha
[52:40] says
[52:41] i said unto him i know that he shall
[52:44] rise again in the resurrection at the
[52:48] last
[52:48] day and jesus said unto her
[52:51] i am the resurrection
[52:55] and i just i like just to let hold that
[52:58] right there i am the resurrection
[53:02] in other words there's no resurrection
[53:04] outside of me
[53:06] i am the resurrection
[53:09] the life
[53:12] and he that believeth in me
[53:15] though he were dead yet
[53:18] shall he live and whosoever
[53:22] liveth and believeth
[53:26] in me shall never die believe us
[53:29] without this and i'll tell you
[53:33] this next verse is
[53:36] something that i hope can always ring
[53:39] from my lips
[53:41] she said unto him yea lord
[53:44] i believe that thou art the christ
[53:47] the son of god which should come into
[53:51] the world heavenly father we ask you to
[53:53] bless your word in your precious name we
[53:56] pray
[53:56] amen god bless you you may be seated
[54:00] what a what a
[54:04] marvelous thing that jesus spoke here
[54:08] he said i i am the resurrection
[54:12] and and the life
[54:15] and what a beautiful day that
[54:20] easter is to us
[54:24] because without it we would
[54:27] have nothing and you know
[54:30] uh we look at this day and we watch
[54:35] the lord as he
[54:40] was trying to express something to
[54:42] martha
[54:44] that he was more than just
[54:47] one that came and uh
[54:52] taught the scriptures
[54:55] and we know that he taught and people
[54:58] marveled at the things that he taught
[55:03] he taught like no other man he spake
[55:06] like
[55:06] no other man and so if you pictured
[55:09] yourself
[55:11] there and you went to one of his
[55:14] meetings
[55:15] and when we were
[55:18] visiting in israel they took us to a
[55:20] place that
[55:21] they said this is the mount where jesus
[55:24] gave
[55:25] the sermon on the mount and the hillside
[55:29] was there and you could look over the
[55:31] rolling hill and you could picture
[55:34] in your mind the people sitting there
[55:36] maybe
[55:37] some had brought their picnic baskets
[55:39] and and
[55:40] they had come to hear what this young
[55:45] rabbi from uh
[55:48] nazareth was preaching the one that was
[55:52] a galilee
[55:53] and uh there at that area was
[55:56] a great trade route they said where
[55:59] people
[56:00] uh traveled and uh and went up
[56:03] and down the coast there by the sea of
[56:06] galilee it was
[56:07] sort of the main highway route so many
[56:11] people would travel
[56:12] and come and jesus taught quite a bit in
[56:16] that area along those places and he
[56:18] would
[56:19] hold his services in his meetings and he
[56:21] gathered the people
[56:23] at this time and he spoke like no man
[56:25] spoke
[56:26] he said you know if your brother compels
[56:29] you to go a mile go
[56:31] twain and if they ask you for your
[56:34] coat give them your cloak also
[56:37] and uh if he smites you on the cheek
[56:40] turn the other cheek
[56:42] they've never heard anything like this
[56:44] blessed is the peacemaker
[56:47] well he shall inherit the kingdom of god
[56:50] and he spoke
[56:51] uh the words there that we so often read
[56:57] in in the sermon on the mount in those
[57:00] chapters of six and so
[57:02] of saint matthew and and the great
[57:05] teachings that he got and
[57:06] everybody was marveled because they
[57:09] never
[57:10] saw a man like this
[57:13] and then you know then he began to do
[57:16] something that had never been done
[57:19] before
[57:20] he began to stretch forth his hand
[57:23] and have compassion and pray for people
[57:27] and and great works begin to
[57:31] happen and signs and wonders was
[57:34] in their midst and
[57:38] and today even if we would look
[57:41] all the people that the lord laid his
[57:44] hands
[57:45] on back there 2000 years ago
[57:48] none of them are sitting in our midst
[57:52] today
[57:54] there there had to be something more
[57:58] that he could offer and though he was
[58:02] doing signs and wonders like nobody had
[58:04] ever done before
[58:06] i mean just think of it
[58:09] the scripture said that there was one
[58:11] that was born blind
[58:13] and he prayed for him and he received
[58:17] his sight
[58:19] and then when they they began to
[58:20] question him and he said you know
[58:22] this one thing i know he said
[58:26] i was blind but now i see
[58:29] and and they said well who by what power
[58:32] did he do this and he looked at me said
[58:35] your guys are the leaders of
[58:37] israel you're the ones that are
[58:41] preaching to the people and telling us
[58:44] and you don't know by which power
[58:46] that i've received my sight this one
[58:49] thing i do
[58:50] know i was blind and now i see
[58:53] [Applause]
[58:54] so uh you know there there was a
[58:57] a great uh controversy
[59:01] and and and i i think so much that
[59:04] the controversy was over what was
[59:06] jesus's motive and objective
[59:09] what was he doing there why did he come
[59:13] and i think that's what they couldn't
[59:15] lay their
[59:17] understanding on what was why that he
[59:21] came why that he was here what was
[59:24] the purpose of his his coming and
[59:27] and as we begin to to understand
[59:31] afterwards as we look back but while he
[59:33] was doing these signs and these wonders
[59:35] and they were teaching there there rose
[59:37] up indignation
[59:39] against him from the leaders and the
[59:42] rulers of that time
[59:44] they they begin to fight against him and
[59:46] they begin to look
[59:48] at ways they could bear false witness
[59:50] against him and twist the
[59:53] the the images of what that he was doing
[59:57] to
[59:58] make it look like he was doing it for
[1:00:00] himself
[1:00:01] and he had a selfie mode and objective
[1:00:03] but he only had
[1:00:04] one motive and objective
[1:00:08] that was to return eternal life
[1:00:12] back to the believer that's why he was
[1:00:16] going to go to that cross he was going
[1:00:18] to go to the cross to pay
[1:00:20] for our sin because the wages of sin is
[1:00:25] death
[1:00:26] and the day that you eat thereof is the
[1:00:29] day
[1:00:29] that you die and and
[1:00:33] and that was what that he saw and that's
[1:00:35] what he said don't worry about him
[1:00:38] that can cause the first death
[1:00:41] but worry about him that causes the
[1:00:44] second death
[1:00:45] or the eternal separation
[1:00:49] from god and and this is why
[1:00:52] that easter as we call it easter or
[1:00:55] resurrection
[1:00:56] sunday or or whatever
[1:01:00] words and everything that we might
[1:01:03] express and want to talk about it
[1:01:07] it what that was delivered
[1:01:10] for us and what was one and so
[1:01:13] jesus expressed uh he expressed
[1:01:17] himself he himself expressed himself
[1:01:23] so it wasn't somebody else expressing
[1:01:26] uh something but he himself expressed
[1:01:29] himself
[1:01:30] and and the love that he had in his
[1:01:34] heart
[1:01:34] and what that he wanted to do for the
[1:01:38] people in in in healing the sick
[1:01:41] it it it was such a a
[1:01:45] representation of what that
[1:01:48] the the uh what that he possessed
[1:01:52] that he possessed a
[1:01:56] power within himself
[1:01:59] to overcome sickness
[1:02:03] leprosy a a thing
[1:02:06] at one time was a great curse something
[1:02:09] that
[1:02:10] came upon a person's skin and ate it up
[1:02:14] and and
[1:02:14] they basically kind of deteriorated
[1:02:18] and and they lost their lives and it was
[1:02:20] so contagious that
[1:02:22] they had to put them in colonies and
[1:02:24] they had to live
[1:02:26] by themselves and they had to ring a
[1:02:28] bell or
[1:02:29] or cry out if they went to the
[1:02:33] to travel they would travel in small
[1:02:35] bands and they would cry out
[1:02:37] unclean unclean so people could
[1:02:41] keep their social distance away from
[1:02:44] them they just didn't want to come in
[1:02:46] contact with them unless that
[1:02:50] they would be contagious and
[1:02:53] we preached that wednesday night that
[1:02:55] faith is contagious
[1:02:57] okay amen but he had within himself
[1:03:03] the power over that
[1:03:08] he had the power over leprosy
[1:03:11] and we we know the story of the leopards
[1:03:14] that came to him and
[1:03:16] and they asked him to make them clean
[1:03:20] and and he cleansed them and they were
[1:03:23] well
[1:03:24] and yet they went away and only one of
[1:03:27] them came back
[1:03:28] and thanked him for what
[1:03:32] that he uh their healing and i believe
[1:03:35] that's when jesus
[1:03:37] imparted to that one leopard something
[1:03:40] that was beyond his healing
[1:03:42] okay and so we we saw that he possessed
[1:03:46] something that that he
[1:03:51] that he had you understand that he was
[1:03:54] he was expressing that
[1:03:56] he had the power over sickness
[1:03:59] he had the power over the
[1:04:02] enemy he had the power over sickness
[1:04:06] now he only expressed that he had the
[1:04:08] power
[1:04:09] over death and so
[1:04:12] this great expression of himself the
[1:04:15] love he had for the people
[1:04:17] the love that uh
[1:04:20] that he he he had for the needy and
[1:04:24] those that were suffering
[1:04:26] and and and this great uh
[1:04:29] uh i only think express it as this great
[1:04:33] command
[1:04:34] and this great conqueror that he was
[1:04:37] that he could do the works that he that
[1:04:40] he did
[1:04:41] and people came to him i can't imagine
[1:04:45] because it's not written so much in the
[1:04:49] word of god but could you imagine
[1:04:51] the counseling that he gave because the
[1:04:54] word of god said he was a counselor
[1:04:57] he was the prince of peace in other
[1:04:59] words the peace that he
[1:05:01] imparted the counseling that he gave to
[1:05:04] people
[1:05:05] the guidance that he gave the situations
[1:05:09] that he fixed i can't imagine how many
[1:05:12] broken homes that he mended
[1:05:14] how many marriages that he mended how
[1:05:17] many
[1:05:18] people that were distraught and
[1:05:21] broken-hearted that he
[1:05:22] healed the brokenhearted in all the
[1:05:26] expressions when he said this day as the
[1:05:28] scriptures fulfilled
[1:05:30] this great manifested work that he's
[1:05:33] done
[1:05:34] that he could that he could do all these
[1:05:37] great works
[1:05:39] and then we know the story being
[1:05:42] christians that
[1:05:43] they they captured him and and
[1:05:46] they according to the scriptures we know
[1:05:50] that but they felt that they were going
[1:05:52] to put an end to them
[1:05:53] and they convicted him of blasphemy
[1:05:57] and and that's what they did him
[1:06:00] uh being a man not forwarded but not yet
[1:06:03] 50 that
[1:06:04] he knew god and before abraham
[1:06:08] you know was i am and and all the things
[1:06:12] that he said that they
[1:06:14] stopped their ears up and they just
[1:06:16] hated the very
[1:06:18] fact that he was there and and and they
[1:06:21] that others said oh he's going to cause
[1:06:23] a rebellion and
[1:06:24] it can and so even when he finally got
[1:06:28] there
[1:06:29] on the cross they looked at me said
[1:06:32] you've saved
[1:06:33] others now save yourself
[1:06:38] and
[1:06:42] that was their thinking
[1:06:45] now he could have saved himself
[1:06:50] he could have come off the cross the
[1:06:52] prophet of god said all that he had to
[1:06:54] do is point a finger
[1:06:56] you know what i mean angels this the
[1:06:59] angels were
[1:07:01] gathered about chariots everywhere all
[1:07:04] he would have done is to to cry out
[1:07:07] and say you know come
[1:07:10] save me you know and he went through
[1:07:13] that great struggling as a
[1:07:15] we listened and and and read out of the
[1:07:18] word of god that he
[1:07:20] faced up to the responsibility that he
[1:07:24] had
[1:07:24] he said for this cause i have come into
[1:07:28] the world
[1:07:29] i've come into the world to to offer
[1:07:32] a sacrifice when john introduced him
[1:07:35] he introduced him as the lamb of god
[1:07:39] behold the lamb of god this is
[1:07:42] god's sacrifice this is god's lamb we
[1:07:46] know that man brought a lamb to the
[1:07:48] temple
[1:07:48] that the priests could sacrifice them
[1:07:50] and and cover their sins and it was
[1:07:54] a sin offering that they gave and now
[1:07:57] it was god himself coming to his own
[1:08:01] temple and providing a lamb
[1:08:04] and here was the lamb of god being
[1:08:07] washed and
[1:08:08] and prepared for that hour now here he
[1:08:11] is he's there
[1:08:12] at at at calvary and
[1:08:15] and everybody in their heart they
[1:08:17] thought oh
[1:08:18] we thought this was he
[1:08:22] there's never been a man like him we've
[1:08:24] never seen works
[1:08:26] like the works that he's done we've
[1:08:28] never witnessed
[1:08:29] anything like this in all our lives and
[1:08:32] we thought this was the one
[1:08:34] that would restore the kingdom we
[1:08:37] thought this was the
[1:08:38] one that was going to take us out of the
[1:08:40] bondage of romans
[1:08:41] we thought this was one that was going
[1:08:43] to become king
[1:08:45] whatever their thoughts were
[1:08:48] they had this great thought
[1:08:51] of what he might be or what that he
[1:08:54] should do
[1:08:55] but yet he stayed true to the word of
[1:08:57] god because
[1:08:58] he had something yes
[1:09:02] as keith told him he says i have power
[1:09:05] to lay my life down
[1:09:08] and to take it up again he was
[1:09:12] the resurrection and
[1:09:15] the life and and so when they mocked
[1:09:18] them and he said oh you've saved others
[1:09:21] save yourself and he could have saved
[1:09:24] himself
[1:09:24] but if he would have saved himself he
[1:09:26] wouldn't have saved us
[1:09:28] [Applause]
[1:09:31] so we we we want to lay
[1:09:35] down and move past
[1:09:38] the point that our sins have been paid
[1:09:42] for
[1:09:45] because no need to do penance for your
[1:09:47] sins
[1:09:48] he's paid for our sins sin isn't our
[1:09:52] question
[1:09:56] every man's sin was covered
[1:10:01] he died for the sins of the world
[1:10:05] can you i don't care who that you find
[1:10:07] on the street i don't care what their
[1:10:09] condition is
[1:10:10] there has been a price paid for their
[1:10:13] sins
[1:10:14] now whether they want to accept that
[1:10:16] payment or not
[1:10:18] we don't have power over that but it's
[1:10:21] been paid for
[1:10:22] and it's their rejection
[1:10:26] of the payment that keeps them
[1:10:30] in the bondage and the power of that
[1:10:33] sin because sin is a slave master
[1:10:39] either you serve god or you serve some
[1:10:42] other master
[1:10:43] that's what habits become they're
[1:10:46] they're slave masters to you
[1:10:48] you're you you you can go so long but
[1:10:51] they
[1:10:52] just seem to be able to return and and
[1:10:55] take
[1:10:55] hold of you and can pull you back into
[1:10:58] bondage and if a believer could ever
[1:11:01] come to the place and say wait a minute
[1:11:03] this has been paid for
[1:11:05] if he i don't i don't have to be under
[1:11:08] this
[1:11:08] not because i can break the spell of it
[1:11:11] because
[1:11:12] you can't break the spell of it but he
[1:11:14] broke the spell of it
[1:11:15] and he broke the spell of it at calvary
[1:11:19] that's why he went there so we find this
[1:11:22] great place that he was
[1:11:24] and and he he possessed and
[1:11:28] demonstrated all this power over
[1:11:30] sickness all this power over
[1:11:32] sin he had answers and good answers for
[1:11:37] every question that he bought was
[1:11:39] brought to him who's
[1:11:41] whose image is on the coin
[1:11:44] you know why do you murmur against
[1:11:46] yourself why do you
[1:11:47] i mean i don't even think that we can
[1:11:49] grasp the
[1:11:51] the power and the majesty
[1:11:55] of jesus life the closest thing that we
[1:11:59] could ever have looked at
[1:12:00] it in our generation was to watch the
[1:12:02] prophet of god in this generation
[1:12:05] can and may i say it the majesty and the
[1:12:08] miraculous and the miracles and the
[1:12:11] spirit
[1:12:12] that was in his life that's what happens
[1:12:14] when god lives in a man
[1:12:18] look when he went when he went
[1:12:22] to the cross the sins were paid and men
[1:12:26] they placed them in the tomb
[1:12:30] and it would have been a marvelous story
[1:12:35] to that point
[1:12:38] but what he possessed
[1:12:42] you understand i am the resurrection
[1:12:46] i am the life so he
[1:12:50] said if i'm this if i am the
[1:12:52] resurrection then
[1:12:53] and i am the life i can lay my life down
[1:12:58] and take it up again
[1:13:03] i mean it's it was the ultimate seal
[1:13:07] for the believer i can lay my life down
[1:13:11] you can
[1:13:11] you you can take my life
[1:13:17] he died a physical death
[1:13:22] but what was in him could never die
[1:13:25] because it was eternal life
[1:13:29] and when he rose from the
[1:13:33] the grave and he came out of the grave
[1:13:37] it was the the absolute
[1:13:40] total expression of
[1:13:43] what that he possessed
[1:13:47] i have the keys
[1:13:51] to hell to grave to death
[1:13:54] i i i'm i have conquered
[1:13:58] death now that would have been great
[1:14:02] if it would have if he would have done
[1:14:04] that it would have been
[1:14:05] his testimony but he said you go up
[1:14:09] there
[1:14:11] and you wait can you tarry
[1:14:14] and the same spirit that raised me
[1:14:18] from the grave
[1:14:24] i'm going to depart on you
[1:14:29] i'm going to give you the same
[1:14:33] quickening power that quickened me
[1:14:36] from the grave i am going to return
[1:14:40] that same power to you
[1:14:45] just think of that
[1:14:49] it wasn't something that he paid the
[1:14:52] price
[1:14:54] and proved that he was the one that
[1:14:56] could pay the price
[1:14:58] and we could sit here this morning and
[1:15:00] say my sins are paid for
[1:15:02] so when i go to heaven
[1:15:06] i'm going to walk there and i'm going to
[1:15:09] say lord
[1:15:10] i'm a sinner and my sins are going to
[1:15:13] be paid for and he's going to set me
[1:15:17] in the judgment
[1:15:21] and i'm going to sit there and hope
[1:15:26] that he chooses me
[1:15:29] no he put an end to that
[1:15:34] at easter
[1:15:38] that's what he did he took the same
[1:15:42] spirit that he had
[1:15:45] the same life that was in him
[1:15:49] and he gave that life
[1:15:53] back to his children back
[1:15:56] to the believer they now became
[1:16:00] possessors of the resurrection
[1:16:05] if you have him you have the
[1:16:08] resurrection
[1:16:09] and the light you are now
[1:16:12] resurrected and are sitting in heavenly
[1:16:16] places
[1:16:17] in christ jesus
[1:16:20] i i feel in my heart even as i listen to
[1:16:24] this sermon
[1:16:25] a greater desire within me
[1:16:28] to come more into
[1:16:32] a revelation and an understanding
[1:16:36] of the possession of the resurrection
[1:16:39] what it really is that i have
[1:16:43] real what it really is what he done for
[1:16:47] me so i want to stop right here and
[1:16:49] i just want to read uh a statement
[1:16:54] uh to us before we
[1:16:58] we go and we listen to this 20 minutes
[1:17:00] this morning
[1:17:02] but the the
[1:17:05] jesus's whole
[1:17:08] life was to depart
[1:17:13] the resurrection to the believer
[1:17:19] to give them resurrection
[1:17:22] so we talk about the baptism of the holy
[1:17:25] spirit like an
[1:17:26] anointing but if we could talk about it
[1:17:29] and
[1:17:30] understand it that the baptism of the
[1:17:32] holy spirit that quickening power
[1:17:35] is the resurrection
[1:17:40] that's right it's not an event it's a
[1:17:43] possession
[1:17:45] it's a condition i know
[1:17:48] that i have resurrection and i know that
[1:17:52] i have life i know that i possess
[1:17:57] the quickening power that's going to
[1:18:00] quicken
[1:18:01] my mortal body though the skin worms eat
[1:18:04] my flesh yet shall i
[1:18:06] see god when it's not just a guide
[1:18:11] even though it leads the same guide just
[1:18:13] into all
[1:18:14] truth and righteousness but that
[1:18:16] resurrection
[1:18:17] is something that can become so real to
[1:18:20] us
[1:18:21] because such a peace to us such a
[1:18:23] satisfying
[1:18:25] a comfort
[1:18:29] to us to that we can actually say i
[1:18:32] now possess the resurrection
[1:18:35] look what he tried to show us on mount
[1:18:38] transfiguration he says look now
[1:18:42] at transfiguration just before we close
[1:18:47] transfigure the transfiguration
[1:18:50] we are all represented
[1:18:54] there in the transfiguration
[1:18:58] so we know that when jesus went up to
[1:19:01] the mountain
[1:19:02] and he took the disciples with him and
[1:19:05] and he went up there all of a sudden
[1:19:08] he became glorified
[1:19:13] and the glory of the lord and there
[1:19:15] appeared to moses
[1:19:16] in elijah with him and we know their
[1:19:20] response they wanted to set up
[1:19:22] tents they wanted to do something
[1:19:25] but that never was jesus intention
[1:19:29] he was showing them the power
[1:19:33] and the resurrection and the life
[1:19:39] he says we're all represented look
[1:19:42] what we are seeing today notice just
[1:19:45] what we're seeing today
[1:19:47] the quickening power of god
[1:19:51] we was all there there was
[1:19:55] the dead saints represented in moses
[1:20:00] and there was the resurrection
[1:20:04] and jesus christ glorified elijah and
[1:20:07] moses
[1:20:08] elijah moses elijah and jesus
[1:20:12] all standing on the mountain the dead
[1:20:15] saints
[1:20:16] were represented by moses the rapturing
[1:20:19] saints
[1:20:20] were met re represented by elijah
[1:20:23] he says jesus standing there on the
[1:20:26] mountain
[1:20:26] the dead saints the raptured saints and
[1:20:30] jesus glorified oh my
[1:20:33] god the dead saints and the raptured
[1:20:36] saying
[1:20:37] now why oh my
[1:20:41] i it's the comfort of it
[1:20:44] you understand once you possess that
[1:20:47] quickening power
[1:20:48] death doesn't change it and we're going
[1:20:51] to listen to brother branham explain
[1:20:53] that
[1:20:53] so if we're going to stop just take a
[1:20:56] few moments here
[1:20:57] out and start at paragraph uh
[1:21:01] uh 177
[1:21:05] and we're just going to listen to just a
[1:21:08] small portion right out of the middle of
[1:21:10] this
[1:21:10] and then we'll finish up this morning
[1:21:13] and we're going to read through
[1:21:15] paragraph
[1:21:17] 239 but i'd like to point something out
[1:21:20] to you
[1:21:20] that changed this whole message
[1:21:24] to me for me um
[1:21:28] it's a statement that brother branham
[1:21:30] makes here
[1:21:31] in paragraph 178
[1:21:36] he says you can put that up there if you
[1:21:38] have it he says
[1:21:40] no i'm yeah just here it says oh
[1:21:42] remember
[1:21:43] we are flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:21:46] his bone
[1:21:51] if we are his bride
[1:21:55] death won't bother that quickening power
[1:21:58] at all though the skin worms destroy
[1:22:02] this body
[1:22:03] yet in my flesh shall i see god
[1:22:08] glory to god what uh i don't know
[1:22:11] what i say but what
[1:22:15] a hope for an old man
[1:22:19] like me knowing
[1:22:22] i see my end time
[1:22:25] right out yonder soon as
[1:22:29] 56 years
[1:22:32] old
[1:22:36] i never saw this message
[1:22:40] in the light that i've seen it as
[1:22:43] brother branham
[1:22:45] foretelling of his departure
[1:22:52] that's what he says i see my coming he
[1:22:55] comes back later and he says a man knows
[1:22:58] when his times come and he looks out and
[1:23:01] he says you know
[1:23:04] i see my departing coming soon at 56.
[1:23:08] of course you know that he passed away
[1:23:10] at 56
[1:23:12] years of age but he and now from that
[1:23:15] point
[1:23:16] he expresses
[1:23:19] what hope that he had and what he
[1:23:23] possessed and what it was
[1:23:26] he was trying to bring to the church
[1:23:32] the return this message
[1:23:35] was the return of the resurrection
[1:23:40] to the believing saints
[1:23:46] it can you imagine that that
[1:23:49] power to resurrect was gone
[1:23:55] and it was restored back in our day
[1:23:58] so let's just listen to this
[1:24:01] this to this morning
[1:24:05] this 20 minutes and
[1:24:09] i almost want to approach it kind of
[1:24:11] more in a somber way
[1:24:14] in a reverent way in
[1:24:17] in a gracious beautiful
[1:24:21] way of appreciation understanding
[1:24:24] what this message
[1:24:28] really was
[1:24:32] it was the quickening power
[1:24:36] it was the resurrection life
[1:24:40] it was the genuine spirit of god
[1:24:46] brought back to the gentile believer
[1:24:50] so that they could take possession of it
[1:24:54] because they were deceived because an
[1:24:57] angel
[1:24:58] satan can appear as an angel of light
[1:25:02] and it would be so close in the last
[1:25:05] days
[1:25:05] it would deceive many and there had to
[1:25:08] be something that was so
[1:25:09] crystal clear that the believer could
[1:25:13] see
[1:25:14] they could see it demonstrated they
[1:25:17] could see it
[1:25:18] manifested they could see the anointing
[1:25:21] of it
[1:25:22] that they could sit there and be able to
[1:25:24] say do
[1:25:25] is what that i'm seeing is it
[1:25:28] dwelling in me and now it's
[1:25:32] offered back to the church
[1:25:35] it's offered back to the believer that
[1:25:37] god has
[1:25:38] come in this day and proved his promise
[1:25:42] presented that life once again to the
[1:25:46] church
[1:25:46] that they can believe and become a part
[1:25:50] of it
[1:25:51] and now they become possessors not some
[1:25:55] lie of satan
[1:25:56] not some joined to some denomination
[1:26:00] not joined as something that isn't real
[1:26:03] not joined to an idea or a philosophy
[1:26:07] or a church with the hopes
[1:26:10] that what you have might make it a
[1:26:12] judgment
[1:26:13] but actually bringing the same
[1:26:17] resurrection life the same quickening
[1:26:20] power
[1:26:21] and presenting it to the gentile church
[1:26:25] today that they can take possession of
[1:26:28] it
[1:26:28] and they too can have it and that's what
[1:26:32] we've got to ask ourselves
[1:26:33] do i have this resurrection
[1:26:38] am i a possessor of it let's just
[1:26:41] listen to our messenger encourages us
[1:26:44] and when you go back home and you read
[1:26:47] the rest of it i'll stop but he goes
[1:26:50] back and
[1:26:50] takes another 10-15 minutes explaining
[1:26:54] to the people
[1:26:55] that that's all my motive and objective
[1:26:58] has
[1:26:58] been the whole time was to bring to you
[1:27:03] resurrection
[1:27:06] and that's what he said the holy spirit
[1:27:08] is seeking those out
[1:27:10] who want the spirit of god so that they
[1:27:13] can be in the rapture
[1:27:14] god bless you let's just listen i think
[1:27:16] it'll be a blessing to you
[1:27:20] now let me show you i don't care if
[1:27:21] you're dead or where you're at
[1:27:23] that quickly empowers your beliefs amen
[1:27:28] years and years after his death
[1:27:31] his meat it rotted away the skin worms
[1:27:34] that eat it up
[1:27:36] but they were packing the dead man one
[1:27:38] day thrown him in on that bones and
[1:27:40] there was so much quickening power there
[1:27:41] until a man come back to life again
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:44] hallelujah raised him
[1:27:48] up from the dead because that quickening
[1:27:50] power

[1:27:54] left him
[1:27:55] stayed right on those bones oh remember
[1:27:58] we are flesh of his flesh bone
[1:28:02] of his bones if we are his bride

[1:28:07] at all
[1:28:09] though the skin worms destroys this body
[1:28:11] yet in my flesh shall i see god
[1:28:14] amen glory to god
[1:28:18] i don't know what to say i don't hope
[1:28:22] for an old man like me
[1:28:24] knowing i see my end time right now
[1:28:25] younger soon as 56 years
[1:28:28] old that's that's a little bitty boy
[1:28:29] i've stood here trying to proclaim this
[1:28:31] but i know that in me nothing good that
[1:28:35] i have nothing i've done
[1:28:37] but in me is that quickening power it
[1:28:40] quickened me one day from the things of
[1:28:41] the world as a young man

[1:33:10] power moses had that quickly power
[1:33:14] you believe that there never was a man
[1:33:16] like him on the earth until jesus
[1:33:18] for he didn't only see visions he talked
[1:33:20] face to face with god
[1:33:22] even a prophetess mariam disputed his
[1:33:24] word one day
[1:33:25] he said don't you fear god consider my
[1:33:28] servant moses not nobody in the world
[1:33:30] like him this hour

[1:33:38] don't you fear god
[1:33:39] don't you say a word against him and
[1:33:41] right then she was stricken with leprosy
[1:33:43] and it was dying she didn't live very
[1:33:45] long afterwards moses prayed for
[1:33:47] and moses climbed up on the mountain at
[1:33:49] 120 years
[1:33:51] of ministry or 80 years of ministry 120
[1:33:54] years of life
[1:33:55] climbed up on the mountains and died and
[1:33:57] was buried in the valley
[1:34:00] but that quickening power was on him
[1:34:02] about 800 years
[1:34:04] later here he stand on my
[1:34:05] transfiguration

[1:34:20] on the day of the resurrection that
[1:34:22] great morning that job and
[1:34:24] all of them knew that would come when he
[1:34:26] said i know my redeemer liveth
[1:34:28] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[1:34:30] christ
[1:34:33] it's actually the book of job was wrote
[1:34:35] before genesis it claimed
[1:34:37] and the oldest book in the bible and it
[1:34:40] is trials and
[1:34:41] like we go through now and his wife even

[1:35:01] he'll stand upon this earth though the
[1:35:02] skin worms destroys this body

[1:35:18] well now he had the potentials of god
[1:35:20] too everlasting life

[1:35:25] when he died or sarah died he bought a
[1:35:28] piece of ground in palestine near job's
[1:35:30] grave and buried sarah
[1:35:32] abraham died and also was buried with
[1:35:35] sarah
[1:35:36] abraham begot a god isaac
[1:35:39] and isaac when he died he slept with
[1:35:42] abraham in the same portion of ground

[1:37:30] matthew 27 51
[1:37:32] when jesus raised from the dead job seen
[1:37:35] that coming said i know my redeemer
[1:37:37] liveth

[1:37:46] prophet
[1:37:48] abraham was a prophet isaac was a
[1:37:51] prophet
[1:37:51] jacob was a prophet joseph was a prophet
[1:37:55] and they had the revelation of god
[1:37:57] according to his word
[1:37:59] amen on that easter morning
[1:38:02] when that one came and redeemed all
[1:38:05] those who
[1:38:05] believed on him they raised two
[1:38:07] according to the bible
[1:38:09] that quickening power come into the
[1:38:10] grave of job where there wasn't even a
[1:38:12] spoonful of the dust of his bones
[1:38:15] after almost hundreds and hundreds and
[1:38:17] hundreds of years
[1:38:19] his bones had decayed it went back and
[1:38:22] turned back to the gases of the earth
[1:38:24] just a mere ash dust lay there
[1:38:28] but yet when that's quickening power
[1:38:30] according to the word of god to the
[1:38:31] promise
[1:38:32] hundreds and hundreds yes thousands of
[1:38:34] years later
[1:38:36] when that quickening power was brought
[1:38:37] forth in the grave job
[1:38:39] abraham isaac jacob harlem come out
[1:38:43] of the grave with him the bible said so
[1:38:46] saint matthew 27 chapter and 51st verse
[1:38:49] it said many of the saints that slept in
[1:38:51] the dust the earth
[1:38:52] resurrected it come out of the graves
[1:38:54] with him when he come up on easter
[1:38:55] morning
[1:38:56] why they had that potential they had
[1:38:59] that quickening power
[1:39:01] see and raised up from the dead and went
[1:39:04] with him in the resurrection enjoyed
[1:39:08] the resurrection with him because they
[1:39:10] were full
[1:39:11] of that quickening power they had that
[1:39:13] genuine easter seal
[1:39:15] which they always shall lay back in the
[1:39:17] old testament wait a minute in first
[1:39:19] thessalonians the fourth chapter the
[1:39:21] 16th verse
[1:39:26] she read that i would not have you in
[1:39:29] your brother
[1:39:29] concerning those that sleep that's your
[1:39:32] sorrow not even as others which have no
[1:39:33] hope
[1:39:34] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:39:35] rose again the third day not make belief
[1:39:37] but we believe it
[1:39:38] even so them that sleep in him shall god
[1:39:42] bring with him
[1:39:43] the new testament saints with that
[1:39:45] quickening power shall resurrect
[1:39:47] also at his second coming just as sure
[1:39:50] as the old testament saints

[1:39:53] their bones and translations and powers
[1:39:55] and so forth that showed of god that
[1:39:58] prophets who the word of god came to
[1:40:00] they resurrected with him on that
[1:40:03] resurrection morning
[1:40:05] and with the promise of god that
[1:40:06] everyone that's in christ jesus will
[1:40:08] also
[1:40:09] come with him in his resurrection the
[1:40:11] quickening power
[1:40:12] of god upon the bones no
[1:40:15] wonder we lay hands on the sick
[1:40:18] no wonder we love one another we are
[1:40:22] brothers and sisters
[1:40:24] we shouldn't hate one another because
[1:40:26] we're corrected by the word of god
[1:40:28] we should love one another and have
[1:40:31] respects for one another
[1:40:32] you know if you don't it won't help you

[1:41:17] even a star left of it
[1:41:19] it was his respect amen
[1:41:23] and the god of heaven by his quaking
[1:41:26] power
[1:41:27] killed that cancer and spared the life
[1:41:30] of donovan wurtz back there it's ryan
[1:41:34] what is these things look at your people
[1:41:35] here in phoenix look at you people who's
[1:41:37] believed in this
[1:41:39] look at the people who has this that
[1:41:40] lays their hands upon you watch what
[1:41:42] happens
[1:41:43] it's quickening power these signs shall
[1:41:45] follow them that believe
[1:41:47] if they lay their hands on the sick that
[1:41:50] quickly power eagle to eagle
[1:41:53] something's going to take place now
[1:41:56] eagle to a buzzard won't work
[1:41:58] eagle to eagle raises from the barnyard
[1:42:03] to the heavenlies these signs shall
[1:42:06] follow them
[1:42:08] that believe when they're both in belief
[1:42:10] see that same quickness power
[1:42:12] of god represented in these two prophets
[1:42:16] elijah and elijah notice the same word
[1:42:19] one of them
[1:42:20] it's ketchup the others caught up
[1:42:24] catch up and caught up see he was caught
[1:42:28] up we'll be
[1:42:29] catch up catch up with him
[1:42:32] meet him in the air be caught up to meet
[1:42:34] him in the air notice
[1:42:35] a bird has to have two wings to balance
[1:42:37] himself
[1:42:39] that right elijah was a translating wing
[1:42:42] elijah elisha was a resurrection wing
[1:42:45] see both of them together representing
[1:42:48] the saints that are living
[1:42:50] and the saints that are going on
[1:42:52] remember
[1:42:53] quicken to see the past the curtains
[1:42:57] how these people were quickened back
[1:42:58] there to look past the curtain and see
[1:43:00] down in this time
[1:43:02] those prophets look at paul said in the
[1:43:04] last days how these people be acting
[1:43:05] call themselves christians
[1:43:07] he was a prophet full of the quickening
[1:43:09] power for sword coming to pass
[1:43:11] we believe that don't we he received
[1:43:13] quickening power
[1:43:14] look at the quickening power today for
[1:43:16] telling things without
[1:43:18] one event missing not one time does it
[1:43:21] fail
[1:43:22] quickening power not the power of a man
[1:43:25] the power of god
[1:43:27] the power the abstract of easter the
[1:43:30] resurrected jesus has sent back the
[1:43:32] abstract
[1:43:32] to guarantee us that we're already
[1:43:34] quickened with him notice
[1:43:36] you remember the little book businessman
[1:43:38] here looking to pass the curtain of time
[1:43:41] i began to get older knowing my days are
[1:43:43] getting shorter
[1:43:45] now i get real i play that little piece
[1:43:47] of them ladies saying a while ago i've
[1:43:48] had it for about
[1:43:49] 18 20 years now i want to talk it over
[1:43:52] lord
[1:43:53] then get out there and go to praying
[1:43:54] then that quickening power comes i'm
[1:43:56] rested up and i looked up there and i
[1:43:57] said look at yonder
[1:43:58] i remember that morning being caught up
[1:44:00] as my wife sitting back there
[1:44:02] laying on the same bed with me that
[1:44:03] morning i was raised up and looked up
[1:44:05] and there she was asleep
[1:44:06] i said if i'm going to do anything to
[1:44:08] the lord you better hurry up or here or
[1:44:09] past 50.
[1:44:11] and then the holy spirit caught me away
[1:44:12] and i looked over there
[1:44:14] i seen those saints just as certain i'm
[1:44:17] standing here but this desperate
[1:44:19] sacred book laying here and a minister
[1:44:20] of the gospel have i
[1:44:22] ever told you anything in the name of
[1:44:23] the lord but what happened
[1:44:26] i want you to tell me about it every
[1:44:28] time has it been perfectly at the
[1:44:29] platform every time has it happened just
[1:44:31] like he said
[1:44:32] this was thus saith the lord
[1:44:36] i stood there and looked over that time
[1:44:37] and i've seen tens of thousands times
[1:44:39] thousands coming
[1:44:40] young men and women run throwing their
[1:44:42] arms around me screaming i'll look right
[1:44:43] back and see myself laying on the bed
[1:44:46] oh lord let me look at past the curtain
[1:44:48] of time
[1:44:49] what is it it's quitting power that'll
[1:44:51] catch us away
[1:44:53] that great quickening power the
[1:44:55] quickening power coming this last days
[1:44:57] that's what i'm in arizona for right now
[1:44:59] there's many people sitting right here
[1:45:01] stood right here at phoenix and heard me
[1:45:02] tell you from this very platform
[1:45:04] thus saith the lord how many remembers
[1:45:07] that
[1:45:07] of course something's fixed that
[1:45:09] happened i saw seven angels come
[1:45:11] didn't life magazine packet is the fog
[1:45:14] of it floated across here 27 miles high
[1:45:16] and 30 miles across
[1:45:17] it's not fred stop and these other gene
[1:45:19] norman i'm sitting back there
[1:45:21] stood right there when them seven angels
[1:45:22] appeared right there on the hill and
[1:45:24] shut the hills for miles around like
[1:45:26] that there stood seven angels and thrown
[1:45:28] a sword in hand said go home and open
[1:45:30] these seven seals they were given
[1:45:33] and here they are the true mystery of
[1:45:36] marriage and divorce and the serpent's
[1:45:38] seed and all these things has been
[1:45:39] fussed about
[1:45:40] it's the santa lord what is it the
[1:45:43] acquainting power
[1:45:44] coming to the church making it already
[1:45:47] this hour that we're approaching
[1:45:49] quickening power oh god help us to
[1:45:52] receive it
[1:45:53] help us to believe it see just depends
[1:45:56] on what attitude you take to it what's
[1:45:57] going to do you any good or not at all
[1:45:59] so you have to believe that if you don't
[1:46:01] believe it it won't do you
[1:46:02] one bit of good how samuel stood there
[1:46:04] before that people said
[1:46:05] have i ever told you anything in the
[1:46:07] name of the lord but what happened did i
[1:46:08] ever beg you for your money to live on
[1:46:10] no but we want the king anyhow that's
[1:46:12] the way the church is today
[1:46:14] they want their own ideas they won't pay
[1:46:16] a bit of attention to you they'll walk
[1:46:17] right around
[1:46:18] well let's just go show the quickening
[1:46:19] power is not there always say well i
[1:46:21] spoke in tongues i jumped i shouted
[1:46:23] that's all fine
[1:46:24] but that quickening quickly powers there
[1:46:25] you'll recognize like that little eagle
[1:46:28] that's his mama that's the word that's
[1:46:29] thus saith the lord that's what god
[1:46:31] promised
[1:46:32] that's what was foretold that's exactly
[1:46:33] what happened we're beyond any shadow of
[1:46:35] doubt potentially in the resurrection
[1:46:37] right now
[1:46:38] the saints getting ready to be taken up
[1:46:41] in the air
[1:46:42] so jesus so full of this quickening
[1:46:44] power
[1:46:45] said if you can destroy this temple it
[1:46:47] took you 40 years you thought to bill
[1:46:49] i'll raise it up in three days
[1:46:52] why why could jesus say that onto ashton
[1:46:55] why could jesus say a thing like that
[1:46:57] he knew that he was amen
[1:47:01] amen i wish i could make that stick
[1:47:07] he knew who he was he knew that
[1:47:11] every word god had wrote in there of him
[1:47:13] he had fulfilled it
[1:47:15] he knew he was one david spoke of
[1:47:18] do you know you're the one the bible
[1:47:20] speaks of yes
[1:47:21] do you know your position is in christ
[1:47:23] if you're in christ you're a new
[1:47:25] creature
[1:47:26] do you know this word is just like
[1:47:27] everyday living to you
[1:47:30] well sure it's yours you are an eagle
[1:47:33] that's your food
[1:47:39] hey man
[1:47:44] you know there's there's some great
[1:47:46] questions
[1:47:48] that settled and
[1:47:51] i i see so many people they
[1:47:54] they battle with whether they're going
[1:47:56] to be in the rapture or not
[1:47:59] but you see the rapture has two parts
[1:48:02] it's got two wings
[1:48:04] the translated right
[1:48:07] and the quickened just how
[1:48:11] just how he he said it i i wanted to
[1:48:16] uh i i maybe i i forgot to
[1:48:20] mark it down here he says a bird has two
[1:48:23] wings to balance it
[1:48:25] that's right elijah was
[1:48:28] translating wing elijah
[1:48:32] was the resurrection wing
[1:48:35] so there's those of us that if the lord
[1:48:38] if the lord tarries and
[1:48:40] it and you would
[1:48:44] bury me somewhere or broad brown goes on
[1:48:46] to say burn me up
[1:48:47] put me into ashes i don't care what you
[1:48:50] do with me
[1:48:53] because if that spirit is in me it's on
[1:48:57] my bones
[1:48:59] it'll quicken my bones then i would be
[1:49:02] the
[1:49:02] i would be the resurrected part of the
[1:49:06] rapture
[1:49:06] i'm in the same rapture you are but i
[1:49:09] represent the resurrection wing
[1:49:12] if you're still here you represent
[1:49:15] the translation wing it doesn't matter
[1:49:18] whether you're in the resurrection wing
[1:49:20] or the translation wing you've got to
[1:49:23] have the quickening power
[1:49:27] that's what makes it it can and then we
[1:49:31] can go back and we can begin to
[1:49:32] understand
[1:49:34] and look at this message in in a much
[1:49:37] greater light it wasn't god
[1:49:40] sending a message to correct
[1:49:43] everybody's heir to to to
[1:49:47] uh prove that all these doctrines were
[1:49:50] false
[1:49:53] he just that's not all that he was doing
[1:49:56] he just wasn't doing the signs and
[1:49:59] wonders
[1:50:00] to prove that jesus was a healer
[1:50:03] because many people believe that jesus
[1:50:06] was a healer
[1:50:07] but you've got to understand what that
[1:50:10] he was
[1:50:10] bringing back to the church
[1:50:14] what he was putting on display what he
[1:50:17] was representing
[1:50:19] what it meant to have the son of man
[1:50:23] show up god veiling himself in a prophet
[1:50:27] proving that he's the same yesterday
[1:50:29] today and forever
[1:50:30] it was the demonstration and display
[1:50:34] of the quickening power so the believer
[1:50:38] could
[1:50:38] look and see it move hear the word of it
[1:50:43] know what it is and be able to ask
[1:50:46] themselves
[1:50:47] do i possess this
[1:50:50] not get in a conflict with it oh that
[1:50:53] doesn't match up to my doctrine
[1:50:55] oh i i don't see it that way this is
[1:50:58] what i think
[1:50:59] that's what he said the church is in the
[1:51:01] same condition today
[1:51:03] they never give up their ideas but your
[1:51:06] ideas won't
[1:51:07] make you a part of that resurrection
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:11] i don't care what part i'm in
[1:51:15] if i'm translated or i'm resurrected
[1:51:18] i know one thing that i've got to
[1:51:21] possess
[1:51:25] that same spirit that he had
[1:51:28] he is the resurrection i am the
[1:51:31] resurrection life
[1:51:32] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:51:36] you've got to have this life
[1:51:40] that i had in me i'm willing to give it
[1:51:43] to you
[1:51:46] but what satan do he appears as an angel
[1:51:49] of light
[1:51:51] he offers religion he offers
[1:51:54] church he offers all kinds of things but
[1:51:57] the one thing that he
[1:51:58] can't offer is eternal life eternal
[1:52:02] life comes from god he was trying to get
[1:52:05] us to see our position
[1:52:06] but there had to be something
[1:52:10] you understand that life had to present
[1:52:13] itself
[1:52:15] so that you can look at it and and
[1:52:18] identify with it
[1:52:19] and it identify with you so that
[1:52:23] now you could look at it you could know
[1:52:25] what it was
[1:52:26] and it would identify you it would
[1:52:29] possess
[1:52:30] you and you would possess it and then
[1:52:32] you
[1:52:33] know you have it
[1:52:38] you know you possess it this
[1:52:41] message was the return
[1:52:45] we can call it a lot of things we
[1:52:48] sometimes we refer to it as
[1:52:50] the lord coming back the appearing of
[1:52:52] the lord the second coming of the lord
[1:52:54] but when reality you understand if it
[1:52:57] was him
[1:52:58] it's resurrection because he is the
[1:53:01] resurrection
[1:53:02] and the life that's what he brought back
[1:53:06] to the church
[1:53:08] it wasn't a new doctrine it was the same
[1:53:12] thing that paul preached
[1:53:15] it wasn't god never was a trinity
[1:53:19] he just preached what god was but what
[1:53:22] was it what was the spirit
[1:53:27] that he had what was the nature
[1:53:30] that was put on display through our
[1:53:32] messenger
[1:53:33] what was what was the what was it that
[1:53:36] he was really
[1:53:37] bringing to us and telling us that we
[1:53:40] had to have
[1:53:41] you have to have him
[1:53:45] you've got not just him as who he was
[1:53:48] historically
[1:53:49] not just him as a a copy
[1:53:53] of his work but that that
[1:53:56] life that you can actually become a
[1:54:01] possessor
[1:54:02] and have the resurrection in you and you
[1:54:04] can actually
[1:54:05] say i know that i live
[1:54:09] because he lives
[1:54:17] i don't know how to express it just the
[1:54:19] way that i'd like to express it but
[1:54:22] but let me just read it to you
[1:54:25] this way it's in paragraph 84
[1:54:29] and the same thing is with every true
[1:54:32] believer
[1:54:34] when the preaching of god's word comes
[1:54:38] forth
[1:54:40] and it's vindicated and proved
[1:54:43] that it's god's word for this
[1:54:46] hour then there's something within the
[1:54:50] believer
[1:54:52] i don't care how loyal his father was to
[1:54:55] church
[1:54:58] or how loyal his mother was
[1:55:01] or his grandparents and if the
[1:55:04] church is teaching contrary to this hour
[1:55:08] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:55:12] message
[1:55:15] what a what a way to word it
[1:55:19] this message was a baptism
[1:55:23] for the believer and what was the
[1:55:26] baptism what did they go into the upper
[1:55:28] room
[1:55:28] so they could be endured with power from
[1:55:31] on high
[1:55:32] that they too would be possessors of the
[1:55:35] resurrection
[1:55:37] oh death where's your string oh grave
[1:55:40] where's your victory
[1:55:41] i have a crown waiting for me they knew
[1:55:44] they would rise up
[1:55:46] they knew he was going to come again it
[1:55:48] was settled
[1:55:51] and let me tell you when you're outside
[1:55:53] the word of god for the
[1:55:55] hour if you haven't become one with it
[1:55:58] if you haven't become a part of it you
[1:56:01] still
[1:56:02] struggle that's good
[1:56:05] thank you i have it i have a nephew and
[1:56:10] and he's a good baptist boy and and we
[1:56:14] always
[1:56:14] marveled at him because his wife never
[1:56:17] wore pants
[1:56:20] and he was clean and and
[1:56:23] lived good and we had a lot of hope
[1:56:28] we go back this time and he's
[1:56:31] smoking a cigar
[1:56:35] and his wife's in pants
[1:56:38] and you sit back because you understand
[1:56:41] their mind can't hold them
[1:56:46] your mind can't hold you you've got that
[1:56:50] you've got to understand what it is
[1:56:54] that he's trying to give you he's not
[1:56:56] trying to give you just
[1:56:58] a holy way of life because this world
[1:57:00] would be done away with
[1:57:02] he's not just trying to to give you a
[1:57:05] temporary peace
[1:57:06] what he's trying to impart to you
[1:57:11] is what will take you out of the grave
[1:57:15] or what will take you off of this earth
[1:57:18] what he's trying to give you is the
[1:57:21] resurrection
[1:57:22] now we are in the resurrection we're
[1:57:26] in easter why because if we've received
[1:57:29] his word for the hour
[1:57:31] we've received his spirit because his
[1:57:34] spirit
[1:57:35] is in his word hallelujah
[1:57:38] don't just receive the word without the
[1:57:41] power
[1:57:42] don't just receive the word without the
[1:57:44] life understand
[1:57:46] what it is that he's giving you
[1:57:52] this message isn't a new just a new way
[1:57:55] to believe
[1:57:56] different everybody else it is actually
[1:57:58] the imparting
[1:58:00] of eternal life to the believer in this
[1:58:03] age
[1:58:05] it's giving those that the holy spirit
[1:58:08] is seeking out
[1:58:10] as we read it here he says it's the holy
[1:58:13] spirit
[1:58:13] coming down to quicken
[1:58:17] and make alive those people that's
[1:58:20] foreordained of god to be
[1:58:22] in the rapture hallelujah
[1:58:28] that's what the message is it's the holy
[1:58:31] spirit of god
[1:58:33] coming down and anointing
[1:58:37] those who are predestinated and
[1:58:40] foreordained to be in the rapture
[1:58:44] oh praise god thank you lord
[1:58:50] thank you you just didn't break america
[1:58:54] and that's to me
[1:58:55] the prophet of god said i'm soon going
[1:58:57] to go but the spirit that's on me
[1:59:00] the words that i have they're still
[1:59:02] anointing
[1:59:03] they still carry the quickening power
[1:59:06] amen just because he left the scene
[1:59:10] didn't mean that quickly and power
[1:59:12] left it's still in the gospel it's still
[1:59:16] the words of life that impart the
[1:59:19] believer that's why the prophet of god
[1:59:21] left the scene
[1:59:22] again he and he stored up to his word
[1:59:25] and the holy spirit's there to break
[1:59:26] that word
[1:59:27] and then you come along
[1:59:31] no matter where you lived one day you
[1:59:34] came along
[1:59:35] why because the holy spirit's hunting
[1:59:37] you out
[1:59:39] isn't that what he's doing i like it
[1:59:42] here
[1:59:43] it says and the spirit today is hunting
[1:59:46] out honest hearts that will believe that
[1:59:50] message
[1:59:52] what did the spirit do what did the
[1:59:54] quickening power do
[1:59:55] what did the resurrection do your name
[1:59:58] was written on the lamb's book of life
[2:00:00] you were for ordained to receive
[2:00:04] the resurrection amen
[2:00:09] not for ordained to recognize that that
[2:00:12] was a prophet
[2:00:15] many people recognize he's a prophet but
[2:00:18] what the
[2:00:19] what that spirit of that message was
[2:00:22] it wasn't an anointed teaching it wasn't
[2:00:25] an anointing teaching
[2:00:27] but it was more than that you understand
[2:00:30] it was
[2:00:31] actually the resurrection itself
[2:00:35] the resurrection power itself the real
[2:00:39] quickening power itself in other words
[2:00:41] this message doesn't impart a knowledge
[2:00:44] it imparts a life
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:49] i am the resurrection and the life
[2:00:52] you can't come in this
[2:00:56] without me and here i've returned back
[2:01:02] veiled in a prophet not son of god son
[2:01:05] of man
[2:01:07] preaching the presenting
[2:01:11] to the church resurrection
[2:01:17] and they turned it down but you didn't
[2:01:22] because it was foreordained for you
[2:01:28] it sought you out
[2:01:32] everything in the bible was promised is
[2:01:34] to the believer
[2:01:36] and when you accept it in its fullness
[2:01:39] then god
[2:01:39] knows that you'll do it he gives you the
[2:01:43] abstract of that
[2:01:46] the proof of it the ownership
[2:01:50] remember that's what a deed does it
[2:01:53] proves you're
[2:01:54] the owner of it nobody can take that
[2:01:57] property from you
[2:01:58] and let me tell you when you've received
[2:02:00] this message
[2:02:01] and you've received the spirit of this
[2:02:03] message when you understand
[2:02:05] what it was that this message was
[2:02:08] bringing
[2:02:08] not knowledge to not a different
[2:02:11] doctrine
[2:02:12] not a different teaching even though the
[2:02:14] doctrines were true
[2:02:15] in life but what comes with truth is
[2:02:18] freedom
[2:02:21] that's what sets you free what sets us
[2:02:23] free from this world is resurrection
[2:02:27] hallelujah resurrection or
[2:02:30] translation i don't care what it is but
[2:02:33] if i have that quickening power
[2:02:35] it'll quicken my body also
[2:02:41] i'm not afraid of the grave
[2:02:47] we're not afraid of that you are if
[2:02:50] you're not sure
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:53] but you understand he's trying to wipe
[2:02:56] away
[2:02:58] all the fear and doubt by sending a
[2:03:01] ministry
[2:03:03] by displaying to you by signs and
[2:03:05] wonders
[2:03:06] and vindication by showing you
[2:03:10] and you know that that's the truth
[2:03:13] that life is the truth that spirit is
[2:03:16] not the spirit of man
[2:03:18] that's the spirit of christ that's the
[2:03:20] word of god
[2:03:22] and you call back out like that like
[2:03:24] coming out of that little eaglet in the
[2:03:26] pen
[2:03:26] you say that's what i want to be
[2:03:32] and when you accept it
[2:03:35] it seals you
[2:03:39] unto the day of your redemption
[2:03:43] nothing can ever take it out you you've
[2:03:46] got it
[2:03:47] it's a possession that's in you so deep
[2:03:51] and so real see there's something with
[2:03:54] he says there's something in him that
[2:03:57] screams out
[2:03:58] he'll leave the barnyard he's got to do
[2:04:02] it
[2:04:03] the chicken might have been all right
[2:04:05] one day
[2:04:07] but this eagle but this is
[2:04:10] eagle hour it's different
[2:04:15] there is something that he must
[2:04:18] leave the old coop and fly away
[2:04:22] into the blue then this earthly body
[2:04:26] is quickened and brought by the
[2:04:28] quickening spirit
[2:04:30] to the obedience of the word of god
[2:04:36] what what makes us line up to the word
[2:04:40] of god
[2:04:42] it isn't law it's life
[2:04:47] he gives you the life he gives you the
[2:04:50] quickening power
[2:04:52] to line up to the word we don't we're
[2:04:55] not perfect
[2:04:57] he said now this holy spirit represents
[2:05:02] as the flying eagle over the land
[2:05:05] to find the believer no man can come to
[2:05:09] me
[2:05:10] no man can come to me as he wants to
[2:05:13] all the father hath given me will come
[2:05:16] to me but no man can come by
[2:05:20] himself it's your
[2:05:23] own thinking your own drawing
[2:05:27] it's god's drawing all the father hath
[2:05:30] given me
[2:05:32] will come to me and now the holy spirit
[2:05:35] is here on earth
[2:05:37] looking out those individuals that god
[2:05:40] has ordained
[2:05:41] to life in this age and as soon as he
[2:05:44] finds it
[2:05:46] it does just like it did on jesus
[2:05:50] a great super son of god
[2:05:53] who redeemed us all it comes down
[2:05:56] and takes its place and abodes
[2:06:00] in the human life now notice
[2:06:03] brought the quickening power now that
[2:06:06] quickening power that comes upon jesus
[2:06:09] quickened him
[2:06:10] to manifest every promise of the word of
[2:06:12] god
[2:06:13] do you understand what he just said
[2:06:16] he says that word goes out that spirit
[2:06:19] goes out
[2:06:20] it's hunting that believer and when he
[2:06:22] finds
[2:06:23] it when he finds the believer
[2:06:26] he finds the one that says that's the
[2:06:29] truth
[2:06:31] i believe that pillar of fire i believe
[2:06:35] that was the messenger of the hour i
[2:06:37] believe this is the fulfillment of the
[2:06:39] word
[2:06:40] i believe it
[2:06:43] and then what does what does he do to
[2:06:45] that believer when he's
[2:06:46] when that believer cries out i believe
[2:06:50] it
[2:06:51] then he departs that power
[2:06:54] to that believer and now they become
[2:06:58] a possession of it
[2:07:02] and that's why that eagle went to
[2:07:04] wherever you are whatever country you're
[2:07:06] in whatever family you were in however
[2:07:08] you were brought up
[2:07:10] it found you it sought you out
[2:07:13] you did not choose him he chose you he's
[2:07:17] the one that sought you out
[2:07:18] he's the one that finds you out you
[2:07:20] recognize it's true
[2:07:22] i just don't want to stop at recognizing
[2:07:26] it's true
[2:07:27] i want to understand that there's a
[2:07:28] promise
[2:07:30] there's an anointing that there's the
[2:07:34] right now is the time that he's
[2:07:37] giving the resurrection
[2:07:42] you can sit back and say i have the
[2:07:46] resurrection
[2:07:47] i am easter did you hear him say
[2:07:51] i wish i could just express it to you we
[2:07:53] are in
[2:07:54] the resurrection now he's now
[2:07:58] going to the gentile church in the lady
[2:08:01] osean age
[2:08:02] giving them the resurrection life
[2:08:10] how are we going to be trans raptured
[2:08:14] if we don't have habit
[2:08:18] [Music]
[2:08:20] and this and when we can see this easter
[2:08:24] this message that was so true
[2:08:28] of the word of god gets so beautifully
[2:08:32] uh spoken and this is how he
[2:08:36] he he he makes this great statement
[2:08:40] and it is so beautiful
[2:08:44] i wrote it down here he said
[2:08:49] not long ago i was preaching and there
[2:08:52] was an old colored man
[2:08:53] come back there at the back
[2:08:57] building and met me and said
[2:09:00] reverend i want to tell you
[2:09:04] i says you is right he said
[2:09:08] i done told the lord a long time ago
[2:09:12] i want my ticket in my hand that morning
[2:09:16] i want to know that it's marked right
[2:09:21] it's going to be a lot of trouble down
[2:09:24] there
[2:09:24] at the river he said i'm coming down
[2:09:29] that river he said i don't want no
[2:09:32] trouble there
[2:09:33] i want to get it all straightened up
[2:09:36] right here that's right he says
[2:09:39] you got your visa
[2:09:43] if you haven't got your visa you might
[2:09:46] have a passport
[2:09:48] but if you haven't got your visa you
[2:09:51] can't enter the land
[2:09:54] you know that you have got
[2:09:58] your everything ready if it isn't
[2:10:03] if it isn't right now is the time
[2:10:07] to do it and in my note here
[2:10:11] i said page 15 paragraph 92
[2:10:16] and that was an old old note and i went
[2:10:20] back
[2:10:20] and i read paragraph 92 he said but he
[2:10:23] that understandeth he that
[2:10:26] knoweth his place in this
[2:10:30] hour he that heareth my word
[2:10:33] and believe on him that sent me
[2:10:37] hath present tense eternal life
[2:10:41] and shall not come into the judgment
[2:10:45] but has already passed
[2:10:48] from death to light then when
[2:10:52] this new eternal life
[2:10:55] dwells in you it's the potential
[2:10:58] or the earnest of your
[2:11:01] being quickened from mortal
[2:11:05] to immortality and i went back
[2:11:08] what's my visa
[2:11:12] what what would i have to do to make
[2:11:15] sure it's ready
[2:11:16] he said he that understandeth and
[2:11:19] knoweth his place
[2:11:21] in this hour and hears
[2:11:24] my word you see how privileged you are
[2:11:29] don't look at this message like a
[2:11:31] religion
[2:11:33] don't look at it like just teachings on
[2:11:36] this
[2:11:37] and and where we can have
[2:11:40] our understanding and though i
[2:11:42] understand all mysteries
[2:11:45] but yet if i don't have
[2:11:49] the love of god if i don't have
[2:11:52] that quickening power if i don't have
[2:11:55] that resurrection
[2:11:56] if i if i haven't seen what's been
[2:12:00] offered to me
[2:12:04] just think he's offered to you
[2:12:09] to be able to take into your life
[2:12:13] and to your heart the spirit
[2:12:17] that will tr translate you
[2:12:21] or resurrect you however god
[2:12:25] has it i don't care
[2:12:32] you say well wait a minute doesn't this
[2:12:34] happen to happen do you understand what
[2:12:36] i'm saying
[2:12:38] if the resurrections come
[2:12:41] and it's here and the resurrection
[2:12:45] life has been departed i don't care what
[2:12:47] the clock does
[2:12:49] that's right
[2:12:52] i don't care if the world goes on the
[2:12:54] thousand years
[2:12:56] that don't matter because the
[2:13:00] resurrection
[2:13:02] the power he came
[2:13:06] in this generation and imparted
[2:13:10] and gave the resurrection to
[2:13:14] every predestinated seed
[2:13:17] so they have it in their hand
[2:13:21] they know where they stand and when the
[2:13:25] train leaves
[2:13:26] they'll be on it
[2:13:31] and when the porter asks for your ticket
[2:13:33] you can show it
[2:13:37] and you know you just
[2:13:40] it don't matter
[2:13:43] oh it
[2:13:47] i when i read this i understood it more
[2:13:49] than ever
[2:13:50] really what brother branham brought
[2:13:54] we we think so much that he brought
[2:13:57] the restoration
[2:14:00] and and he brought the
[2:14:04] back us back to the apostles doctrine
[2:14:07] and brought us back to their miracles
[2:14:10] and brought us back to those experience
[2:14:12] but he said god never goes back he
[2:14:15] always goes forward
[2:14:17] he didn't bring us back what he told us
[2:14:20] was that they
[2:14:21] went to the upper room and received
[2:14:25] the resurrection
[2:14:32] and there's not a new generation
[2:14:36] that's going to get a new baptism and a
[2:14:40] new group of people
