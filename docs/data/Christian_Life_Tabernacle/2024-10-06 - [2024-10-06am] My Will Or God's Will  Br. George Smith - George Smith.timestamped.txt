[1:10:59] light and the
[1:11:02] beautifulness of the word of God is that
[1:11:05] the presence of the holy spirit is with
[1:11:08] his word and no matter what it is what
[1:11:11] what what gospel scripture it is the
[1:11:14] great Holy Spirit has the great ability
[1:11:17] to take that word and mold it and and
[1:11:22] fit it to your ear and your heart to to
[1:11:27] feed you and to meet your
[1:11:30] word we would say oh what he's going to

[1:11:38] not a fact it's more than a fact it's
[1:11:40] eternal life Hallelujah and it's a life
[1:11:43] that can reach the every spot Amen in
[1:11:48] every corner and and and and drive out
[1:11:53] Darkness this morning right so okay you
[1:11:56] know I I just thought this morning when
[1:11:58] brother George first came and I first
[1:12:00] met brother George him and his wife uh
[1:12:03] came to see us and I never could figure
[1:12:06] why they would even come by Fort Worth
[1:12:10] but Lord let them by Fort word and
[1:12:12] brother George our church was no bigger
[1:12:15] than this platform the whole church I'm
[1:12:18] serious it was 11 ft
[1:12:21] wide that's how long it was and it was
[1:12:24] probably about from that to that where
[1:12:26] the pulpit was and we just had 9ft Rose
[1:12:30] coming off one side of the
[1:12:32] wall and and brother George came then
[1:12:36] and and I told him this morning I said
[1:12:39] you know you you've you've seen me and
[1:12:43] stuck with us for Hallelujah 46 years
[1:12:46] now Lord and uh and I believe God had a
[1:12:51] purpose in it because he knew that you
[1:12:54] would be here to morning and that he
[1:12:57] could minister to you through our
[1:13:01] brother so let the word of God reach out
[1:13:03] to your life this
[1:13:06] morning know I don't care what it is on
[1:13:08] your mind you might think it's hopeless
[1:13:11] but remember the light of God's word
[1:13:14] will defeat Darkness Hallelujah every
[1:13:18] time and the Lord Jesus welcomes you he
[1:13:21] doesn't want to lose a one of you he's
[1:13:24] knocking the hold the sin against you
[1:13:27] because he paid for it he wants you to
[1:13:30] accept him this morning and accept his
[1:13:34] word so let us stand together this
[1:13:36] morning as I hope I can say this that I
[1:13:39] invite my
[1:13:41] friend someone who's
[1:13:44] been faithful to our body here and we
[1:13:49] certainly uh trust that his goodness is
[1:13:52] with us and he just didn't come in the
[1:13:55] good times I want you to know that he
[1:13:57] just didn't show up when things were
[1:13:59] good he was here with us when there was
[1:14:03] nothing and so he he just shares a part
[1:14:06] in that and he shares a part and I'd
[1:14:09] like to sing that song as he comes there
[1:14:11] is a
[1:14:12] blood amen how many believe that this
[1:14:15] morning yes

[1:18:01] our Bible to Proverbs Chapter 12 it's
[1:18:04] good to be
[1:18:06] here I first time I've ministered in the
[1:18:09] new
[1:18:11] church and I'm glad that everybody's got
[1:18:13] a seat nobody's stuck in another room
[1:18:15] looking at a monitor I can see you all
[1:18:20] amen thank Brother David for the
[1:18:23] confidence he's got the will only speak
[1:18:25] the word Proverbs 12 verse verse uh
[1:18:29] let's see 12 where we at Proverbs 14 and
[1:18:32] 12 yeah 1412 is where we're
[1:18:35] going there's a way which seeth right
[1:18:37] unto a
[1:18:39] man but the end thereof or the ways of
[1:18:42] death the title is my will or God's will
[1:18:47] now turn over here about 100 Pages or
[1:18:49] more to Jonah it's one of the
[1:18:52] last books of the Old test
[1:18:55] Testament Jonah is our brother he's
[1:18:57] waiting for us in
[1:18:59] glory and he had an interesting
[1:19:02] life today Sunday we're going to have
[1:19:04] Sunday school so pay
[1:19:07] attention Jonah chapter 1 and verse one
[1:19:10] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[1:19:13] the son of Amita saying arise get up go
[1:19:18] over to Nineveh that great City and cry
[1:19:22] against it for their wickedness has come
[1:19:24] up before
[1:19:25] me let us pray Heavenly Father we thank
[1:19:28] you for your mercy to us today we thank
[1:19:30] you Lord that you gave each one of us
[1:19:32] the desire to be in the house of the
[1:19:35] Lord we could be a lot of places but
[1:19:38] your spirit brought us here Lord you've
[1:19:41] given me some words that I want to share
[1:19:43] with your people but only your spirit
[1:19:45] can drive it into the human heart and
[1:19:47] make it real to them your Prophet told
[1:19:49] us very
[1:19:51] clearly that the job of the minister is
[1:19:54] to make Christ real to the people he had
[1:19:57] his way brother David's got a way I've
[1:20:00] got a way the Lord we want to make you
[1:20:02] real to your people bless each Soul help
[1:20:05] us together we ask in jesus' name amen
[1:20:08] you may be
[1:20:12] seated want to congratulate you on the
[1:20:15] new building and how God has
[1:20:17] blessed and brought more people
[1:20:19] in and brother David's wondering where
[1:20:22] we going to put everybody God has a way
[1:20:25] yes sir preach hard some will
[1:20:27] leave the church the church is like a
[1:20:32] hospital now there's nobody out there at
[1:20:34] the door uh I'll see your papers and see
[1:20:36] your P of card no everybody's welcome
[1:20:39] but the word going forth will decide who
[1:20:42] stays and who
[1:20:44] leaves you don't have to worry about
[1:20:46] that God Will Make A Way okay our scene
[1:20:49] today is our brother Jonah he was an
[1:20:53] Israelite from a small town called
[1:20:57] goer which is north of Nazareth up in
[1:21:00] Galilee and he was the first foreign
[1:21:03] missionary okay he was comfortable here
[1:21:07] but God spoke to him in very clear
[1:21:09] language there was no praying there was
[1:21:11] no fasting you go
[1:21:14] there and so a missionary is an apostle
[1:21:19] now I didn't write the
[1:21:21] Bible but in the Bible Paul putting
[1:21:25] things together he says first is the
[1:21:27] missionary the Apostle then the prophet
[1:21:30] so forth so brother brother brandom even
[1:21:33] said it's the high highest calling
[1:21:35] amongst the ministerial
[1:21:38] gifts brother brandom also says I
[1:21:40] believe that every Christian that's
[1:21:41] everyone here all you watching
[1:21:44] online every Christian is obligated not
[1:21:47] so much that you have to go over to the
[1:21:48] old country and preach but if you cannot
[1:21:50] go you can help send somebody else
[1:21:54] everybody is not called right some are
[1:21:56] called to sit still and help send the
[1:21:58] one that is going everybody should hear
[1:22:01] the gospel at least once I want to do my
[1:22:03] part and there's something about
[1:22:05] missionary work that I just love it he
[1:22:07] says just to know that what you're doing
[1:22:10] you're doing God's will when you're
[1:22:12] giving to
[1:22:14] missions I didn't write that either you
[1:22:17] want to say what he says fine I've been
[1:22:20] at this over 50 years let's say what he
[1:22:21] says
[1:22:23] am okay so m AR work isn't only
[1:22:26] traveling to some hot disgusting humid
[1:22:29] place no where they haven't even heard
[1:22:31] of air conditioners yet I've been to
[1:22:33] those places you're sleeping on a
[1:22:36] board you know the man is only that
[1:22:38] thick but um you know some places where
[1:22:41] they don't speak your language don't eat
[1:22:43] your same food missionary work is living
[1:22:46] for
[1:22:47] others right here in
[1:22:51] Dallas when you walk out those doors
[1:22:54] you're are displaying something either
[1:22:57] disgust because Brother David didn't
[1:22:59] shake your
[1:23:00] hand oh yeah there's people like
[1:23:02] that or some bad attitude or glory to
[1:23:06] God we heard from God he spoke to me
[1:23:08] directly and you're out there sharing
[1:23:10] the gospel with others just by showing
[1:23:12] up you know and you know everybody wants
[1:23:16] eternal life if you sat over here at the
[1:23:17] corner and stopped everybody do you want
[1:23:19] everybody wants their eternal life
[1:23:21] everybody would like to go to
[1:23:23] heaven they don't want to go today huh
[1:23:27] maybe tomorrow or next week after I go
[1:23:29] to the beach or whatever that's the way
[1:23:31] people think but you know the scripture
[1:23:33] says in Proverbs
[1:23:34] 29:18 without a vision the people perish
[1:23:38] that's right when you're just going
[1:23:40] around and you're a little circle
[1:23:41] driving your nice car and coming to
[1:23:42] church that's good but are you living
[1:23:45] for
[1:23:46] others so we have many missionary
[1:23:48] projects you all been very good in
[1:23:50] helping us and we're trying to equip
[1:23:54] believer
[1:23:55] witnessing material something they can
[1:23:57] share I had a man helping me with my
[1:24:00] house years ago when we were building
[1:24:03] our house and he was electrician and he
[1:24:06] knew the Believers in the area and he
[1:24:09] said now George they tell me that your
[1:24:11] father-in-law was the prophet of God
[1:24:13] yeah do you have something I can
[1:24:16] understand now these guys they gave me a
[1:24:19] seal book I don't understand
[1:24:22] that you don't start with the Seven
[1:24:25] Seals no you start with the five comings
[1:24:28] of Elijah it's in everybody's Bible oh
[1:24:31] yeah let's start there so we're trying
[1:24:35] to help others share their faith
[1:24:38] now maybe you don't know this but you
[1:24:41] know English is not the predominant
[1:24:42] language of the
[1:24:44] world Hindi over in India that's number
[1:24:48] one language of the world people speak
[1:24:51] it Mandarin in China That's number two
[1:24:55] millions of people speak that language
[1:24:57] it doesn't even not even close to
[1:24:59] English English is only spoken by 17% of
[1:25:02] the people on the planet third most
[1:25:05] spoken language Spanish is 8% the fourth
[1:25:07] most SP spoken language so there's a lot
[1:25:10] to do now the reason we have a Bible is
[1:25:13] because some people have died for this
[1:25:15] Bible that's right it didn't just float
[1:25:17] in one day no people have died getting
[1:25:21] in it into your
[1:25:22] language now this Bible was important
[1:25:25] because it was written over a period of
[1:25:27] 1500
[1:25:28] years by 40 different authors writers in
[1:25:33] three continents three languages and the
[1:25:35] whole thing points to Jesus Christ it is
[1:25:39] very important there's nothing like it
[1:25:41] in the whole
[1:25:42] world so brother Ram says over here on
[1:25:45] that day on Calvary he was just one man
[1:25:47] the perfect man he gave his life made an
[1:25:49] example for you now what must we do now
[1:25:52] the first thing I want to say Jes Jesus
[1:25:54] never lived for himself we live for
[1:25:57] oursel we got to have the finest we got
[1:25:59] have the best our car has to be polished
[1:26:02] but Jesus didn't live for himself his
[1:26:04] life was spent for others that is
[1:26:07] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[1:26:09] go to church and do good things that's
[1:26:10] fine but when you just live your life to
[1:26:13] yourself that is not eternal life
[1:26:15] eternal life is living for
[1:26:17] others I trust you've heard some of
[1:26:19] these things before but you're going to
[1:26:21] hear it maybe a little differently today
[1:26:23] so all you got to do is pi attention now
[1:26:25] I didn't bring my
[1:26:28] level but would you poke that guy he's
[1:26:30] going to sleep already
[1:26:34] yeah we have ways it proved when he came
[1:26:39] as the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:26:41] eternal life because he didn't he did
[1:26:43] not live for himself he lived for others
[1:26:46] and you receive eternal life by
[1:26:48] receiving that day on Calvary and you
[1:26:50] don't live to yourself anymore but you
[1:26:51] live for others okay so let's let's get
[1:26:54] back to Jonah this is all going to make
[1:26:56] sense eventually but you got to pay
[1:26:57] attention so Jonah had a direct
[1:26:59] commission from God God spoke to his
[1:27:02] Prophet directly he didn't have to guess
[1:27:04] he didn't have to pray go preach to the
[1:27:06] enemy their wickedness has come up
[1:27:08] before me I can't stand it anymore go
[1:27:10] preach
[1:27:11] repentance but there was one simple
[1:27:13] problem Jonah was Jewish and the people
[1:27:17] in Nineveh were not Jewish they were
[1:27:20] Gentiles very serious segregation
[1:27:24] okay and so things were out of balance
[1:27:27] so Nineveh at that time was the capital
[1:27:30] of
[1:27:31] Assyria currently Northern Iraq okay
[1:27:35] they were very Wicked sinful people very
[1:27:38] cruel violent city of over 120,000
[1:27:41] people it's a large city it took 3 days
[1:27:43] to walk around
[1:27:44] it and so these Assyrians were
[1:27:47] constantly tormenting and oppressing the
[1:27:50] Israelites this didn't happen just in
[1:27:52] these last 50 years those 3,000 years
[1:27:55] ago they've constantly been tormenting
[1:27:58] God's
[1:27:59] people and they never have
[1:28:02] learned God is with these people this
[1:28:05] week they sent 1,800 expensive Rockets
[1:28:08] into a little bitty Israel and only one
[1:28:12] person died and he was a bad boy that
[1:28:14] was out on the street in Jericho when he
[1:28:16] should have been
[1:28:19] hiding there's many miracles have
[1:28:21] happened in this last year during this
[1:28:23] war am we'll read about it someday but
[1:28:26] anyway this started way back
[1:28:28] there so God is sending his Prophet
[1:28:30] right into the jaws of danger to face
[1:28:33] the enemy go cry against it it was time
[1:28:37] for
[1:28:38] repentance warning before judgment God
[1:28:41] always warns before judgment just like
[1:28:44] when you raise your children don't do
[1:28:46] that because this is going to happen but
[1:28:50] kids you know they tried it anyway then
[1:28:53] they get the whiping you were warned God
[1:28:56] always warns before judgment when he was
[1:29:00] here in the flesh in Israel preached
[1:29:03] everywhere but there was three towns
[1:29:06] that just couldn't get with the
[1:29:08] program and he condemned them they had
[1:29:11] plenty of warning had plenty of Miracles
[1:29:13] beida cim and capernium
[1:29:16] blasted
[1:29:18] them life went on sun came up the next
[1:29:21] day 60 years later came the earthquake
[1:29:26] and it all went to rocks you know and so
[1:29:30] God always remembers his word that's
[1:29:33] right and today Israel they have rebuilt
[1:29:37] every place everything's you know
[1:29:39] according to scripture but those three
[1:29:41] little places viida corim and capernium
[1:29:45] nothing it's a pile of rocks because it
[1:29:47] was condemned you know brother Brandon
[1:29:51] preached a long time ago exactly 59
[1:29:53] years ago ago in Los Angeles the message
[1:29:56] called choosing of a
[1:29:58] bride yeah brother David's very familiar
[1:30:01] today there's big chunks falling off
[1:30:04] expensive homes falling into the
[1:30:06] ocean brother brand said it' be a chunk
[1:30:08] 3 to 400 miles wide 1500 miles
[1:30:13] long FEMA or nobody else can solve that
[1:30:16] no sir no it's going to be bad but it's
[1:30:19] going to happen yes sir that's right I
[1:30:22] know people that live over there please
[1:30:24] come visit us well maybe if I can get
[1:30:27] the next flight out but I have no
[1:30:29] business over there so why is this
[1:30:32] important to us in 2024 well the
[1:30:34] scripture says in 1 Corinthians all
[1:30:36] these things happen back there for
[1:30:38] examples and they're written for our
[1:30:40] admonition for our learning who upon
[1:30:43] whom the ends of the world are come when
[1:30:45] Paul wrote that that was 2,000 years ago
[1:30:48] but we are living in the time when it is
[1:30:51] very important we are the end time
[1:30:53] generation
[1:30:55] the end of the everything is at the door
[1:30:58] the world is falling apart now maybe you
[1:31:01] lived under a rock and you Haven noticed
[1:31:03] that but it's falling
[1:31:05] apart now what we need is a strong
[1:31:10] shaking to shake off the shackles of sin
[1:31:13] shake off the attitude of no concern who
[1:31:15] cares we don't just need a trimming we
[1:31:18] need a cutting away of the idol no
[1:31:20] interest attitudes and the idolatry
[1:31:24] yeah look that up on your smartphone one
[1:31:26] day brother R has a lot to say about
[1:31:28] idolatry it's not just over there at the
[1:31:30] Catholic church with with the image up
[1:31:32] here no it's
[1:31:34] everywhere we got people burning candles
[1:31:36] to William rand's picture right
[1:31:38] now we got people burning candles to the
[1:31:41] tapes what is this Catholic Spirit again
[1:31:45] they let it in how do we get it
[1:31:47] out so it's far beyond the time of
[1:31:50] aspirin or alco celer or pat on the back
[1:31:53] you won't be a okay we need major
[1:31:55] surgery we need the truth we can't
[1:31:59] afford to go on playing church it's high
[1:32:01] time to seek the presence of God in your
[1:32:04] individual lives Brother David can't do
[1:32:07] everything he's doing good keep himself
[1:32:09] standing up and preaching the gospel but
[1:32:11] he can't run your life you've got to
[1:32:13] seek God you see so we want to know
[1:32:16] God's will for our individual lives
[1:32:19] that's what we really want 1 John 4:20
[1:32:22] says if a man says I love God oh yes I
[1:32:24] love God but he hates his brother
[1:32:26] because brother did something he's a
[1:32:28] liar right I'm a
[1:32:31] liar for how can he love uh for he that
[1:32:34] loveth not his brother whom he can see
[1:32:36] how can he love God whom he hasn't seen
[1:32:39] so however we treat each other okay
[1:32:42] believer to believer that's how we treat
[1:32:45] God everybody's nice to Brother David
[1:32:47] everybody's nice to brother Billy what
[1:32:49] about each other amen what about
[1:32:51] inviting somebody out to lunch that you
[1:32:53] you don't really like or you don't know
[1:32:55] real well it's okay these are brothers
[1:32:57] and sisters you know so God is watching
[1:33:01] our reaction to every test you see God
[1:33:04] put everything in order he could put the
[1:33:06] right person in the white house he could
[1:33:07] put everything in order in the next two
[1:33:09] hours no he lets it go and go and go
[1:33:14] when are you going to figure this out
[1:33:15] Lord he lets it Go and he's watching
[1:33:17] reactions of the people you see
[1:33:21] so um Jonah was God's man of the hour
[1:33:25] okay he had a clear-cut decision from
[1:33:28] God go cry against their sin and their
[1:33:31] corruption I know about the segregation
[1:33:34] I know about your fears your doubts go
[1:33:38] anyway okay he had it very
[1:33:40] clear and so that's what happened in
[1:33:42] verse two go preach to that City but the
[1:33:47] verse three says but
[1:33:49] Jonah you see when we start this
[1:33:52] sentence with but
[1:33:54] we know there's a problem right he's not
[1:33:57] willing to just get with the program but
[1:34:00] Jonah now he wasn't just anybody this is
[1:34:03] God's man of the
[1:34:04] hour he's God's Prophet he's God's
[1:34:07] mouthpiece but Jonah rose
[1:34:10] up to obey God that's not what it says
[1:34:14] to flee unto
[1:34:15] Tarsus from the presence of the Lord
[1:34:19] underline and went down to the coast
[1:34:21] where the boats are he found a ship
[1:34:24] that's going to tarus so he paid the
[1:34:27] fair yeah he got in his pocket got some
[1:34:29] tithe money out paid the fair yeah I'm
[1:34:31] going to go as a tourist and he went
[1:34:33] into the boat to go with them to tarus
[1:34:36] and for the second time if you weren't
[1:34:38] paying attention from the presence of
[1:34:40] the
[1:34:40] Lord is serious yes sir now I've studied
[1:34:45] this up on the map okay so we're in
[1:34:47] Dallas so God says I want you to go to
[1:34:49] St Louis and preach to these people I've
[1:34:52] had it with them you go preach
[1:34:54] so Jonah oh but Lord you
[1:34:57] know he goes to El Paso
[1:35:00] instead
[1:35:03] 180° obviously not what God Said from
[1:35:08] the presence of the Lord it's looking
[1:35:10] bad
[1:35:12] so it didn't break the relationship it
[1:35:16] only broke the fellowship he's still
[1:35:18] God's man you're still God's child but
[1:35:20] if you go on a detour there'll be a
[1:35:22] price to pay that's right it might feel
[1:35:24] good for a while you might have you know
[1:35:26] 5,000 in the bank whatever there'll be a
[1:35:28] price to pay you know so
[1:35:33] um our Prophet says and you can go look
[1:35:36] it up anointed prophets make wrong
[1:35:40] decisions they're human that's right
[1:35:43] they're not Divine they don't want
[1:35:45] candles burned to them they're very
[1:35:48] human so here's Jonah he goes and he
[1:35:51] pays the you know the tourist Fair he
[1:35:54] gets on the boat and he goes down gets
[1:35:56] in his bunk ah this is nice yeah nice
[1:35:59] now these Merchants these aren't cruise
[1:36:01] ships like we have today this is a
[1:36:03] merchant ship and they're carrying grain
[1:36:05] from the Middle East over to Rome and
[1:36:08] other places this could be a a 100 ft
[1:36:11] long or whatever you know a big wooden
[1:36:14] ship and they could carry up to 100 or
[1:36:19] 200 tons of grain they have a purpose
[1:36:21] there's people waiting for the Grain and
[1:36:23] here's this tourist okay so they go
[1:36:25] along now they watch for the for the
[1:36:27] climate you can study it there's only
[1:36:29] certain months of the year that they
[1:36:30] could go they didn't have a they didn't
[1:36:32] have a motor they're waiting on the on
[1:36:34] wind you know and so there's certain
[1:36:37] months that they don't go at all but
[1:36:39] this is time when they normally can go
[1:36:42] so they're watching the weather well
[1:36:44] they get out there uh to the about the
[1:36:46] end of the first day and here's this
[1:36:47] huge storm they weren't
[1:36:50] expecting and um so remember we got
[1:36:54] God's Prophet down here asleep big storm
[1:36:58] boat starts rocking they start throwing
[1:37:00] stuff out because they don't want to
[1:37:01] sink the ship and they're praying to
[1:37:03] their gods nothing happens and so they
[1:37:05] said where is that tourist that we let
[1:37:07] on oh yeah let's go find him so they go
[1:37:10] get this tourist up here now he didn't
[1:37:12] have his Prophet suit on okay he was
[1:37:15] trying to sneak in like I'm I'm just one
[1:37:17] of the guys you know one of the brothers
[1:37:19] and so he he sneaks in so they get him
[1:37:23] wow storm yeah pray to your God I don't
[1:37:26] need to pray I already know what the
[1:37:28] problem is I'm the problem you know now
[1:37:32] God knows all the details of your
[1:37:35] individual lives amen even for little
[1:37:37] kids older people he knows the details
[1:37:40] so God had this special fish we're not
[1:37:43] going to worry about what his name is
[1:37:45] the special fish is swimming right
[1:37:47] alongside the boat cuz he knows God
[1:37:50] knows I got to have him near the boat
[1:37:52] cuz he's going to swallow the prophet
[1:37:54] here in a few minutes so Jonah um he
[1:37:59] confesses throw me overboard now the
[1:38:01] scripture says they tied his hands and
[1:38:03] his feet so he's not going anywhere he
[1:38:04] can't even
[1:38:05] swim throw him into the water he barely
[1:38:08] got wet because the fish was right
[1:38:11] there now he's inside the fish now he
[1:38:14] didn't
[1:38:15] know he thought he was going to drown he
[1:38:17] thought this is end of me poor me no bad
[1:38:20] you because you made a wrong
[1:38:22] decision but uh now he's inside the fish
[1:38:26] well um you know he was like Peter
[1:38:29] warming at the
[1:38:30] fire trying to pretend like he's one of
[1:38:33] the guys no he's God's Prophet he's
[1:38:35] somebody special so God had this fish it
[1:38:38] says in verse 17 a great fish to swallow
[1:38:41] up Jonah so you see with our God there's
[1:38:45] no surprises he's got it all mapped out
[1:38:47] he knows where you're going to have
[1:38:49] lunch he knows that the kids are going
[1:38:50] to make a mess somebody's going to knock
[1:38:52] over the Pepsi God got all this figured
[1:38:55] out it's for your
[1:38:58] patience you know God puts hard-headed
[1:39:00] people in some
[1:39:02] Churches you know why for the Perfection
[1:39:05] of the
[1:39:07] pastor everybody's not a nice sheep like
[1:39:09] you are but there's some people that
[1:39:11] they come along and they just just an
[1:39:14] aggravation sometimes but that's for his
[1:39:17] Perfection
[1:39:18] see well anyway so back to our story
[1:39:21] here um
[1:39:23] so now Jonah's in the fish and there's
[1:39:27] no light the miracle is that there was
[1:39:29] oxygen he could stay alive now he
[1:39:32] doesn't know how long he's going to be
[1:39:33] there he's in there there's no light
[1:39:36] can't see a thing all he can do is feel
[1:39:39] it's pretty soft over here pretty soft
[1:39:41] you know and he's he's up to probably up
[1:39:43] to his waist in in fish vomit yeah you
[1:39:48] got to be honest
[1:39:49] with
[1:39:51] reality and um well this isn't part of
[1:39:54] the
[1:39:55] bargain now he doesn't know it's only
[1:39:57] going to be three days I mean you can
[1:39:59] hold your breath for a while but um but
[1:40:02] he's in this mess
[1:40:05] and uh he couldn't see you know symptoms
[1:40:07] were
[1:40:08] everywhere and so um the next time you
[1:40:11] think you have it bad because your
[1:40:13] $50,000 RV won't won't start up or you
[1:40:16] have two flat tires tomorrow morning or
[1:40:18] whatever your problem is you got nothing
[1:40:21] compared to Jonah he didn't have a cell
[1:40:24] phone he didn't have a v he didn't have
[1:40:25] an iPad he had
[1:40:27] nothing okay and so he had plenty of
[1:40:30] time to reflect on his actions you know
[1:40:33] back here in verse three but Jonah arose
[1:40:36] to flee yeah 180 degrees different it
[1:40:40] wasn't just 10 miles no 180 de he had
[1:40:44] seaweed all around his neck and um fish
[1:40:47] belly everywhere things were looking
[1:40:50] good it's very dark and so
[1:40:54] uh he he didn't matter if his eyes were
[1:40:57] open or closed he couldn't see anything
[1:40:59] anyway and he said these symptoms are
[1:41:01] all lying
[1:41:02] vanities he was at the bottom of the sea
[1:41:06] inside the fish's belly up to his waist
[1:41:08] and vomit yeah you can't get much lower
[1:41:11] than that these are all lying vanities
[1:41:14] he was very much alive he could touch he
[1:41:17] could taste so TI I'll show you know
[1:41:20] couldn't see he could hear he could
[1:41:22] smell but God supplied the oxygen he he
[1:41:26] he could praise God you know because
[1:41:29] this wasn't part of the bargain you know
[1:41:31] you know I thought things would be
[1:41:32] different you know according to my
[1:41:34] calculations and what I figured out hey
[1:41:37] over these 46 years that I've known
[1:41:39] David we have known people that have
[1:41:41] figured a lot of things out but they
[1:41:43] came to a certain place and they went
[1:41:45] right off the edge it didn't work out
[1:41:47] the way they thought you know so Solomon
[1:41:50] said all is Vanity it'll all come to
[1:41:52] zero
[1:41:54] so the symptoms were very real he had to
[1:41:56] ignore the present reality and focus his
[1:41:59] mind on the word of God that he had
[1:42:01] stored in his
[1:42:02] mind your Prophet said read your Bible
[1:42:06] and pray because there might come a day
[1:42:08] like Jonah when you can't read your
[1:42:10] Bible when you don't have your iPad you
[1:42:12] don't have your $1 thousand phone to go
[1:42:14] check things out you might be
[1:42:16] totally like some of my friends over in
[1:42:18] North Carolina in Tennessee right now
[1:42:20] they're cut off no electricity no or no
[1:42:23] phone or nothing it's coming so he had
[1:42:28] no prophetic transcript didn't have no
[1:42:30] pictures he had nothing he got real
[1:42:32] serious about praying but he didn't know
[1:42:34] it was only going to be three days he
[1:42:36] thought this was the end you know
[1:42:38] Prophet says Devils Tremble When the
[1:42:40] weakest of saints goes to their knees
[1:42:42] what a power and a privilege has been
[1:42:44] given to the Church of the Living God
[1:42:47] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[1:42:49] even the devil's
[1:42:51] tremble the weakest of the Christian
[1:42:53] that do that the devil's tremble in
[1:42:55] another place the weakest Christian here
[1:42:57] tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any
[1:43:00] place any time under any conditions with
[1:43:02] thus sayith the
[1:43:04] Lord but you better be sure it's thus
[1:43:06] sayith the Lord and not thus sayith
[1:43:08] Grandma cuz her words ain't going to
[1:43:10] carry much weight you got to know that
[1:43:12] you know that you
[1:43:14] know okay so why is Jonah in this
[1:43:17] situation why is he in this pickle okay
[1:43:20] apparently you know just on the surface
[1:43:23] it looked like he shered away he evaded
[1:43:26] his duty he ran from responsibility he
[1:43:29] ran from the presence of God twice in
[1:43:31] one verse ran from the will of God he
[1:43:34] opted for his own will yeah God said St
[1:43:37] Louis but you know over here in El Paso
[1:43:41] they speak my language a little better
[1:43:42] and I think I can do better over there
[1:43:44] Lord all due respect but I think I'll go
[1:43:46] that way
[1:43:48] instead watch out you know only the
[1:43:52] fellowship was broken not the
[1:43:54] relationship and every one of you had to
[1:43:56] make a choice today you
[1:43:58] know people on virtual they can click
[1:44:01] the button right now and go to somebody
[1:44:03] else they go they go see some real
[1:44:04] preachers but God's got them locked in
[1:44:07] you know so people can stay in bed they
[1:44:10] can stay on the couch with their
[1:44:11] favorite remote control because we got
[1:44:13] three kinds of Believers everywhere
[1:44:15] there's three kinds of Believers sitting
[1:44:17] here and so if you look this way you're
[1:44:19] going to see some yeah okay we you look
[1:44:21] this well that's don't don't worry about
[1:44:23] them who are you which one are you
[1:44:27] that's God will seek you
[1:44:30] out okay so Jonah had to make a choice
[1:44:34] he was willing to pay the price and go
[1:44:36] his own way remember our title my will
[1:44:40] or God's will he just didn't have any
[1:44:43] idea how high the price is going to be
[1:44:45] you see he chose to go in the opposite
[1:44:47] direction and he probably thought well
[1:44:49] there's probably a lot of sinful people
[1:44:50] over in Tarsus I'll go preach to them
[1:44:53] not so much hassle not so much
[1:44:54] opposition and God would have blessed
[1:44:56] his word yeah you preach the word
[1:44:59] whether it's here or out on the street
[1:45:01] or wherever God will bless the word see
[1:45:04] but obedience is far better than
[1:45:08] sacrifice and I'm sure we could come up
[1:45:10] with a lot of testimonies because you
[1:45:12] know if we put the microscope on the
[1:45:15] Catholic church or all the Baptists in
[1:45:17] Dallas or any of these groups um they're
[1:45:20] using the same Bible it's not a
[1:45:22] different Bible
[1:45:23] I mean from here to South Carolina
[1:45:25] they'll fight you for a King James Bible
[1:45:26] you know they know the Bible many are
[1:45:29] being blessed there's healing there's
[1:45:31] Miracles they believe they're
[1:45:33] approaching God God honors
[1:45:38] faith brother brand says God ignores
[1:45:41] your
[1:45:43] Doctrine we know people given their life
[1:45:45] for their Doctrine they'll fight and
[1:45:47] kill that's why all the wars over
[1:45:50] religion God ignores your Doctrine
[1:45:53] but he gave the Holy Ghost to those who
[1:45:55] obey him
[1:45:59] okay uh message thirsting for life and
[1:46:01] this great Pillar of Fire the angel of
[1:46:04] God the lcos that went out from God that
[1:46:06] led the children of Israel through the
[1:46:07] Wilderness when it came amongst the
[1:46:09] people it separated itself and great
[1:46:11] looks of fire came down on each one as a
[1:46:13] pillar of fire began to break up God
[1:46:15] dividing himself among his people that
[1:46:17] ought to tear the heart out of anybody
[1:46:20] God tearing himself apart that he might
[1:46:23] divide himself a little bit with each
[1:46:24] one of us now we appreciate it but the
[1:46:26] fact that God you know is separating
[1:46:28] himself for us he says can you see now
[1:46:31] why I'm standing for the unity of every
[1:46:34] church that's not the end of the
[1:46:36] sentence that would be very charismatic
[1:46:38] can you see why I'm standing for the
[1:46:40] unity of every church every Full Gospel
[1:46:43] Church every believer we have to be of
[1:46:46] one heart one mind one Accord no matter
[1:46:48] how much we differ in the scriptures or
[1:46:51] our favorite quotations or our favorite
[1:46:53] preacher whatever he says that that
[1:46:55] might be one might see it this way other
[1:46:59] see it that way has nothing to do with
[1:47:01] it but in principle we ought to stand as
[1:47:04] one Mighty Army of God marching on
[1:47:07] because each one of you in your
[1:47:10] peculiarity now look I've been working
[1:47:11] with brother R's words for over 50 years
[1:47:14] putting it English into Spanish it's not
[1:47:17] easy putting Kentucky English into
[1:47:19] readle Spanish and when a new word comes
[1:47:22] up like
[1:47:23] peculiarity it's obvious so he
[1:47:26] says um because each one of you in your
[1:47:30] pecularity God has proved that he's
[1:47:33] ignoring your Doctrine because he gave
[1:47:34] you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he
[1:47:36] gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey
[1:47:37] him acts 532 now if I obey him in my
[1:47:41] peculiar way and you obey him in your
[1:47:44] peculiar way he gave us both the Holy
[1:47:46] Ghost so we ought to be Christian and
[1:47:47] Brethren and sister enough to arm up and
[1:47:50] March together for one great purpose the
[1:47:52] gospel
[1:47:54] say what he
[1:47:56] said so but you see unto us that have
[1:47:59] been called to this glorious gospel he
[1:48:02] has revealed the mysteries of the
[1:48:04] Kingdom he has a plan the Bible is in
[1:48:08] portions we're in the seventh age we
[1:48:11] receive the fullness and God has not he
[1:48:14] doesn't hold those people out there
[1:48:15] accountable for what you
[1:48:17] know there's many things that we believe
[1:48:20] it's not even for them there's things
[1:48:23] brother Brandon preaches like in the 70
[1:48:24] weeks in the Feast of trumpets that's
[1:48:26] for Israel he's just painting the
[1:48:28] picture we're not going to be a part of
[1:48:30] that but he's giving you the full
[1:48:32] counsel okay so God has a perfect will
[1:48:36] and a permissive will for each one of us
[1:48:38] okay get that
[1:48:40] straight does God change his mind we try
[1:48:43] to work on God's permissive will and he
[1:48:45] will permit it but also if we take his
[1:48:48] permissive will though it's not exactly
[1:48:50] right he will make his permissive will
[1:48:52] work out to together to glorify his
[1:48:53] perfect will he does care his word will
[1:48:57] come to pass and you are not going to
[1:48:59] thwart his program I don't care who you
[1:49:02] are there is a price and it'll be much
[1:49:05] higher than you can
[1:49:07] imagine there God changed his mind
[1:49:10] 1965 we must submit ourselves to his
[1:49:13] will and to his word don't question it
[1:49:16] just believe it don't try to find a way
[1:49:18] around it just take it the way it is so
[1:49:21] many wants to go around go go some other
[1:49:23] way and when you do you find yourself
[1:49:25] going on you find God blessing you but
[1:49:28] you're working in his permissive will
[1:49:30] and not in his perfect will he will let
[1:49:33] you do it so the question is I've been
[1:49:37] many countries how can we know for sure
[1:49:41] which is God's perfect will okay God's
[1:49:44] word is his will but this is a a lot of
[1:49:47] verses it's a lot of chapters how are
[1:49:49] you going to know well here's something
[1:49:52] you can write down see if it works for
[1:49:54] you God's word God's spirit and God's
[1:49:57] will always run in parallel they don't
[1:50:00] cross not one going one way no they
[1:50:02] always run in parallel you see they
[1:50:05] agree the word the will and the spirit
[1:50:08] run in harmony we got some fantastic
[1:50:11] musicians over here but if one shows up
[1:50:14] one day well I've had enough of this
[1:50:15] stuff I'm going to play the way I really
[1:50:17] want to let's see how that works out
[1:50:20] doesn't work no in Harmony in parallel
[1:50:25] some people have a portion of the word
[1:50:27] memorized to the very
[1:50:29] letter and if you don't line up out of
[1:50:32] here you know but their wires are
[1:50:34] crossed and they display a contrary
[1:50:37] Spirit even when they're quoting the
[1:50:38] very word you see so there's no harmony
[1:50:43] with the rest of the word produces bad
[1:50:46] fruit and the results are contrary to
[1:50:49] the word in John chapter 4 when Jesus is
[1:50:53] dealing with the woman at the well which
[1:50:55] is one of the examples Brother Brad
[1:50:57] mentions almost on every
[1:50:59] tape Jesus said to the woman at the well
[1:51:02] you remember we don't even know her name
[1:51:03] do we yes she's very famous amongst us
[1:51:06] and he said to her now look honey God is
[1:51:09] searching for those that will worship
[1:51:11] Him in spirit and in truth not all
[1:51:15] Spirit not all truth it's got to be
[1:51:19] balanced that's how they built this
[1:51:21] place here with the level it's got to be
[1:51:23] balanced the sound's got to be balanced
[1:51:25] the Lightning's got to be balanced it's
[1:51:27] all about balance you know okay so how
[1:51:31] do we know which is God's perfect
[1:51:34] will they asked brother R the same
[1:51:36] question
[1:51:38] 1961 how do you feel is the best way to
[1:51:40] find God the Lord's perfect will in some
[1:51:42] important matters good question all of
[1:51:45] our matters are important aren't they I
[1:51:47] tell you dear friend the best way to
[1:51:49] find the will of God in some important
[1:51:50] matters is prayer yes and immediately we
[1:51:54] think of non yeah now non I know you're
[1:51:57] dirty so you go in the river Lord I took
[1:52:01] a bath this
[1:52:02] morning so people say prayer well I'm
[1:52:05] always praying okay so there's one
[1:52:08] here's the way I do it I take it before
[1:52:10] the Lord it's always been my strength
[1:52:12] what prayer I wait upon the Lord to see
[1:52:14] what he says so we got prayer and we got
[1:52:20] wait and I just let myself be new
[1:52:22] neutral to
[1:52:23] it well that neutral part is very
[1:52:27] difficult when you want the red Tesla
[1:52:29] but your your economy gives you a a
[1:52:33] three-year-old Ford pickup it's it's and
[1:52:37] you're supposed to be neutral but you're
[1:52:39] supposed to pray and um be patient you
[1:52:43] know wait on him and be neutral okay
[1:52:47] don't take either side so if I was in
[1:52:49] your place it didn't have these Visions
[1:52:51] so he didn't have a handicap you know
[1:52:53] I would just wait on the Lord and say
[1:52:54] now Lord you show me what's the decision
[1:52:56] to make and then the way you feel led do
[1:53:00] it no wait a little bit and wait what's
[1:53:03] this waiting business hey if there's
[1:53:06] four cars at the GU you know coffee I'll
[1:53:08] go cross the street and get something
[1:53:09] different we don't wait we want it
[1:53:12] now wait a little while longer see which
[1:53:15] way a father in my heart you know it
[1:53:17] doesn't matter I want to know what you
[1:53:19] want to do about it if you all you young
[1:53:22] people would would even take half of
[1:53:24] that and apply it to your life you'd be
[1:53:28] a lot happier I can give you a list of
[1:53:31] people I heard of one case just just
[1:53:33] this week Preacher's
[1:53:36] Daughter thought she really loved this
[1:53:38] guy well the dad could see a little bit
[1:53:41] farther than she could that's always the
[1:53:43] case and she was probably beautiful etc
[1:53:46] etc but the dad could see this is this
[1:53:49] is bad news he offered her just before
[1:53:52] before the wedding he offered her here
[1:53:53] here's a check $20,000 walk away nope
[1:53:56] going through within the year she was
[1:53:59] beat up with a
[1:54:00] 2x4 sad sad sad
[1:54:04] case pray do what the prophet says so
[1:54:08] with
[1:54:08] Jonah God did make his permissive will
[1:54:11] turn around to accomplish his perfect
[1:54:13] will amen yeah he uh he's in the he's in
[1:54:18] the fish and verse 10 here of chapter
[1:54:22] two and the Lord spoke to the fish now
[1:54:26] if you don't believe in the Supernatural
[1:54:27] you're in the wrong Church to begin with
[1:54:29] amen God spoke to the fish that he
[1:54:32] created and His prophets inside that's
[1:54:35] right and what the fish do after God
[1:54:38] spoke to him vomited Jonah upon on dry
[1:54:41] land now if you ever made a long trip
[1:54:45] with little
[1:54:46] kids and they got too much coke or too
[1:54:49] much sugar things can happen right well
[1:54:52] here's Jonah he is totally
[1:54:55] totally covered in fish
[1:54:58] vomit
[1:55:00] and because of what the fish heard from
[1:55:04] God okay sir so he turns towards dry
[1:55:07] land which he's in the water he don't
[1:55:09] know where dry land okay there's dry
[1:55:11] land like a
[1:55:12] missile and he hits the dry sand starts
[1:55:16] rolling he is a
[1:55:18] mess the only solution is take this guy
[1:55:21] down to the car was
[1:55:23] and put him through there right so okay
[1:55:27] so he
[1:55:28] goes and gets cleaned up gets some clean
[1:55:31] clothes Gets a Haircut verse one of
[1:55:34] chapter 3 and the word of the Lord came
[1:55:36] again came into Jonah the second time
[1:55:40] okay you might not have the luxury of a
[1:55:44] second
[1:55:45] opportunity let me give you a little
[1:55:47] story a long time
[1:55:50] ago 1950 5 um the movie came out the Ten
[1:55:55] Commandments we've all seen most of it
[1:55:57] or all of it four
[1:55:59] hours and some people at the Tabernacle
[1:56:01] in Jeffersonville had snuck over to new
[1:56:03] alany and seen the film and so they come
[1:56:06] back and told Brother Brown oh it's
[1:56:07] great film you got to see it so he you
[1:56:10] know got his family together which is
[1:56:12] him and his wife and uh been
[1:56:14] nine-year-old Rebecca so they go down to
[1:56:17] the
[1:56:18] theater and um so they they're watching
[1:56:21] the film and it's a small theater I've
[1:56:23] been there it's like a third of this
[1:56:24] right here it's a very small place this
[1:56:27] 55 and so when the when the pillar of
[1:56:31] fire comes on the screen they were
[1:56:34] inspired so perfectly brother Brown
[1:56:36] thought it was a real thing he jumps up
[1:56:37] took his hat off oh it's a film okay so
[1:56:40] sits back
[1:56:42] down okay so they watched the whole
[1:56:44] thing and now they're on the way back to
[1:56:46] the house after 4-Hour film and Rebecca
[1:56:49] being very
[1:56:50] sensitive she was crying crying well
[1:56:53] dear what what's the matter you know
[1:56:54] Daddy just took you to the movies we
[1:56:56] don't ever do this but you know well she
[1:56:58] thought it was like a newsreel you know
[1:57:00] she didn't think of Hollywood and so she
[1:57:02] says but Dad didn't you see Moses said
[1:57:05] now all you on the Lord's Side come with
[1:57:06] me so pronouncing those words we're all
[1:57:09] watching them well she was watching
[1:57:11] these people back here they were you
[1:57:12] know holding back a little bit and she
[1:57:15] was feeling sorry for them so he stopped
[1:57:18] the car he said okay now I want you to
[1:57:19] pay attention
[1:57:22] you saw those people waiting you might
[1:57:25] not have a second chance when God speaks
[1:57:28] you do it the first
[1:57:29] time now you know so Jonah got himself
[1:57:35] together and he went and preached under
[1:57:38] a very powerful
[1:57:39] anointing chapter 3 5-10 records the
[1:57:43] reaction of the people to the preaching
[1:57:45] of the word of God greatest Revival in
[1:57:47] recorded history entire city of 120,000
[1:57:50] people turned to God and kept back the
[1:57:52] wrath of God they had a choice repent or
[1:57:56] perish with the unbeliever right but
[1:57:59] guess what happened about 150 years
[1:58:01] later the entire
[1:58:04] city departed from what happened back
[1:58:07] there with grma 150 years ago they
[1:58:10] forgot about the mercy and the
[1:58:11] Forgiveness of God and God permitted the
[1:58:13] Babylonians to come in the year 621 BC
[1:58:16] and utterly destroy the city and so
[1:58:19] devastating was that destruction that
[1:58:22] the ruins were not even discovered until
[1:58:25] just over a 100 years ago they didn't
[1:58:28] have bulldozers they didn't have
[1:58:29] Dynamite I don't know what they did but
[1:58:31] it was you know 2500 years nobody knew
[1:58:33] where it was they had such a hatred to
[1:58:37] destroy and it's on your phone and on
[1:58:39] your TV every night what's going on over
[1:58:41] there right now hatred to
[1:58:44] destroy you would think if people had
[1:58:46] any Common Sense okay we've got 1,00
[1:58:49] Rockets we sent in we didn't kill
[1:58:51] anybody
[1:58:53] what's going
[1:58:55] on and yet we can send you know Israel
[1:58:58] can send one rocket and take out their
[1:59:00] main
[1:59:01] man wouldn't you think okay there's
[1:59:03] something going on here why don't we
[1:59:05] just go back home and take care of the
[1:59:08] garden leave those people alone no
[1:59:10] hatred to
[1:59:11] destroy even scoffield says such is the
[1:59:14] way of God light rejected brings
[1:59:17] destruction but see first you have to
[1:59:19] reject then God okay
[1:59:23] so brother Bram said in 1956 this year
[1:59:26] will be decisive either America will
[1:59:28] decide to stay with God or depart and of
[1:59:31] course they departed and we've lived
[1:59:33] long enough now to see the results of
[1:59:36] those
[1:59:37] decisions it's Insanity because in 1964
[1:59:40] he said right here in Dallas I believe
[1:59:42] it was he said if things go on the way
[1:59:44] they are right now in 50 Years it'll be
[1:59:47] Total
[1:59:48] Insanity that Circle was closed in 2014
[1:59:52] we've been 10 years in Total
[1:59:55] Insanity look at
[1:59:57] it so God always warns first we're
[2:00:01] seeing the prophecy
[2:00:03] fulfilled so Jonah was in fact a very
[2:00:05] crucial part of a larger picture so much
[2:00:09] so that was repeated in the New
[2:00:11] Testament by our Lord in Matthew chap 12
[2:00:14] so here's the lesson when you don't
[2:00:16] fully understand an issue whether it's
[2:00:18] in your family whether it's in the
[2:00:20] pastor's family whatever when you don't
[2:00:22] fully understand an issue be careful
[2:00:26] amen scripture says I'm God you're not
[2:00:30] he still I got it figured out whatever
[2:00:33] you're seeing could be part of a much
[2:00:35] larger picture you see and God allows
[2:00:38] scenes to play out oh that doesn't look
[2:00:41] right don't worry he lets it play out
[2:00:43] watching for reactions along the
[2:00:46] way so uh God has not called me or you
[2:00:51] to straighten things up out all the
[2:00:53] items that I think are out of order if
[2:00:55] it was up to me I told my brother-in-law
[2:00:57] Billy years ago I said you know if I was
[2:01:00] God I'd wipe this thing clean right now
[2:01:03] but I'm not God I don't have the
[2:01:05] patience of God you know it would seem
[2:01:07] that God's man God's prophet of the age
[2:01:11] his anointed messenger it looks like he
[2:01:13] was backsliding and stepped out of the
[2:01:15] will of God it would seem that way
[2:01:17] because we as Mortals with a little
[2:01:20] Canary brain and I know there's people
[2:01:22] here with great education great
[2:01:25] SUV etc etc etc okay but we all have a
[2:01:29] canary brain we're small creatures and
[2:01:32] we don't have all the facts now we would
[2:01:35] like to control things so we have all
[2:01:37] the facts but it doesn't happen forget
[2:01:39] it we make need your reactions and
[2:01:43] judgments with only a little bit of the
[2:01:45] information and we're wrong you see very
[2:01:49] few people in any given generation
[2:01:52] recognize the value of the message of
[2:01:54] God during their day that they live we
[2:01:57] look
[2:01:58] back and uh we can look perfectly
[2:02:02] backwards but we miss what's going on
[2:02:05] right
[2:02:06] now I mean when you consider the gospel
[2:02:08] has been um uh preached for 2,000 years
[2:02:12] the fact that we have a perfect Bible
[2:02:15] that's already translated into 750
[2:02:18] languages why didn't everybody believe
[2:02:21] why do we still have missionaries in
[2:02:22] Haiti in Philippines they should have
[2:02:24] had them all baptized by
[2:02:26] now because we're fighting against evil
[2:02:29] spirits you see so it would seem that
[2:02:34] this man was backsliding because we as
[2:02:36] Mortals don't have all the facts we make
[2:02:39] these judgments and very few people
[2:02:41] recognize what God is doing in present
[2:02:43] day okay Simeon lived near the temple in
[2:02:46] other words he lived right next door to
[2:02:48] the church back then and he was old and
[2:02:52] God spoke to him and son I know you're
[2:02:53] old but you're not going to die until
[2:02:55] you
[2:02:56] see my provision for Israel and so God
[2:03:01] gave him some kind of sign we don't know
[2:03:03] what it was so every time that there was
[2:03:05] baby dedication let's say on Thursday or
[2:03:07] whatever he'd go out and he'd look no no
[2:03:09] sign today well one day he's out there
[2:03:11] he saw the sign that God showed him he
[2:03:14] walked up to Mary Mary was dressed like
[2:03:16] everybody else no no gold chains no
[2:03:19] nothing and um can I hold the baby well
[2:03:22] sure so only Simeon and Mary and Joseph
[2:03:25] knew what was going on nobody else and
[2:03:28] he took the baby and he said my eyes
[2:03:31] have seen thy salvation let thy servant
[2:03:34] depart in
[2:03:35] peace thousands of people okay but only
[2:03:39] a few saw what was really going on and
[2:03:42] so he was very ridiculed but he knew
[2:03:45] what he was talking
[2:03:47] about okay questions and answers 57 this
[2:03:51] city Jeffersonville at the day of the
[2:03:53] judgment will answer a great price
[2:03:56] someday there have been hundreds and
[2:03:58] hundreds outstanding healings done right
[2:04:01] here signs and wonders the appearing of
[2:04:04] the Angel over at the river and the
[2:04:06] paper blasted it forth and everything
[2:04:08] and still people don't believe why is it
[2:04:11] now someday I'm going to leave here I'm
[2:04:14] 48 years old right now why didn't the
[2:04:16] world recognize that picture right there
[2:04:19] why didn't they catch these things
[2:04:20] quickly why don't they catch these other
[2:04:22] things why don't they catch these
[2:04:24] prophecies and things you know they
[2:04:26] can't do it now but one day I'm going to
[2:04:29] leave this world and when I leave
[2:04:31] they'll recognize some of you young
[2:04:33] people will see that after I'm
[2:04:36] gone this day that scripture is being
[2:04:39] fulfilled the message is around the
[2:04:42] world in over 40 languages to the
[2:04:45] english- speaking world there's no
[2:04:47] excuse
[2:04:50] whatsoever a couple things I want to
[2:04:52] share Harvest Time
[2:04:53] 1964 but what did the lutherans do after
[2:04:56] the death of Martin Luther they met
[2:04:59] Satan and made a denomination and
[2:05:03] died never done anything else just to
[2:05:07] become a great mass of people two tapes
[2:05:10] and I've mentioned this before but
[2:05:11] there's people that forgotten new people
[2:05:13] two tapes you need to listen to soon are
[2:05:16] the two tapes from April of 1963 they're
[2:05:19] the messages immediately after the seals
[2:05:22] he's over in
[2:05:23] Albuquerque one of them is world falling
[2:05:25] apart he says you might not believe what
[2:05:29] I've just said but this is taped listen
[2:05:32] to it a few years from today if there is
[2:05:34] such and then you'll know whether it is
[2:05:36] true or not one day when the evening
[2:05:38] lights are breaking and it's too late
[2:05:39] then you'll say that man could have been
[2:05:41] right but it's too late then just
[2:05:44] exactly like Jesus said when he was here
[2:05:46] on Earth quote God sent you prophets
[2:05:48] down Through the Ages Every time the
[2:05:51] world system you know falling apart and
[2:05:53] what did you do with each one God sent
[2:05:55] you the prophet you all killed them put
[2:05:57] him in the grave and then in about
[2:05:59] another generation you wake up and
[2:06:01] realize oh that was a prophet and then
[2:06:03] what do you do you garnish the tomb oh
[2:06:06] yeah what do you do you make a tradition
[2:06:09] of his
[2:06:10] life and people that is what has
[2:06:12] happened today with William
[2:06:14] brandham now I'm one of the few
[2:06:17] eyewitnesses left I knew the man I
[2:06:19] talked to him I have memories but people
[2:06:22] have made a tradition of his
[2:06:24] life that is exactly what Israel done
[2:06:26] with Moses they made a tradition of his
[2:06:30] life for for thousands of years every
[2:06:33] Saturday yesterday they meet around the
[2:06:36] world in synagogues see there's only one
[2:06:38] Temple it's destroyed so they meet in
[2:06:40] synagogues around the world and they
[2:06:42] read a portion of their little spoken
[2:06:43] word book Moses said Moses said now they
[2:06:48] have a calendar that you can get and it
[2:06:50] shows you what portion to read for that
[2:06:54] Saturday that's called organized
[2:06:56] religion that's not called Unity of
[2:06:58] spirit they made a tradition of his life
[2:07:01] and that's the way we do with Martin
[2:07:03] Luther John Wesley and other men huh
[2:07:07] wonder who that'd be yeah William
[2:07:10] Brandon right always looking back making
[2:07:13] a tradition of their life garnishing the
[2:07:15] tombs and their message was for another
[2:07:17] day by the time you wake up that day's
[2:07:19] lived on and we're in another day the
[2:07:21] whole system has worked that way since
[2:07:23] the beginning man-made systems we're in
[2:07:26] that wake up get in the word the whole
[2:07:30] promise of Malachi I'm going to send you
[2:07:33] Elijah he going to bring you back to the
[2:07:34] original but we're so busy burning
[2:07:36] candles to William brandom said no back
[2:07:39] to the Bible over 200 times back to the
[2:07:43] word so may God help us when we don't
[2:07:47] have all the
[2:07:48] facts be careful
[2:07:51] so Jonah was God's Prophet but as human
[2:07:54] he looked for the easy way just like we
[2:07:57] do if you go to Papados after a while
[2:08:01] and they say it'll be 20 minutes forget
[2:08:03] that we'll go over here there thousand
[2:08:06] restaurants when you know in two miles
[2:08:07] from here so um he was human he looked
[2:08:11] for the easy way no pressure he wanted
[2:08:13] people to agree with him he wanted pat
[2:08:14] on the back many times God will indicate
[2:08:17] his will then we go and we discuss it
[2:08:19] with the relatives we discuss it with
[2:08:21] the people in church friends we're
[2:08:23] looking for consensus we want somebody
[2:08:25] to agree with us you know and we look
[2:08:28] for the easy way brother Brandon says
[2:08:30] you have to struggle to do the will of
[2:08:32] God sometimes it's not always easy but
[2:08:35] it does produce the best
[2:08:37] fruits so we have many people today that
[2:08:42] um we want to call a message Believers
[2:08:45] but after you're around them 30 minutes
[2:08:47] they're only book carriers or tablet
[2:08:50] carriers
[2:08:51] now Believers act a little different but
[2:08:53] they're willfully by their own will
[2:08:56] they're climbing onto boats that look
[2:08:58] like the ship of Zion it says you know
[2:09:01] end time whatever and yeah people dress
[2:09:04] right and they look pretty good and
[2:09:05] people girls have long hair but
[2:09:08] eventually it's going somewhere else
[2:09:11] yeah it's not sticking with the with the
[2:09:14] gospel it's not
[2:09:15] balanced so friends you can have a
[2:09:17] leading you can have a Doctrine right
[2:09:20] out of the pages of the Bible bible
[2:09:22] promises out of the Bible but if it's
[2:09:24] not in the proper season flowing in the
[2:09:26] economy and the plan of God for the hour
[2:09:28] you will be fighting the will of God you
[2:09:31] be fleeing from the presence of the
[2:09:33] Living God thinking and believing you're
[2:09:36] right you'll be choosing your will not
[2:09:38] God's will you haven't rightfully
[2:09:42] divided the word of Truth and there will
[2:09:45] be a price to pay okay Revelation
[2:09:48] chapter 4 nowadays well we don't believe
[2:09:50] in saying hell in the Pulpit we need men
[2:09:53] of God men who won't hold back we got to
[2:09:56] speak the truth
[2:09:57] regardless we're not here to make
[2:09:59] everybody happy we're not here to pass
[2:10:02] out you know candy bars no this is
[2:10:06] church he says here now everybody can't
[2:10:09] be a preacher but you've got a voice if
[2:10:13] you're if you're a preacher you're
[2:10:15] called to the P to preach if you're not
[2:10:17] you're still a preacher but live the
[2:10:19] people a sermon let your sermon be lived
[2:10:22] and it's the voice of God that'll bring
[2:10:23] a reproach to them who reject it just
[2:10:26] live your
[2:10:27] sermon when your ladies go to Walmart
[2:10:29] and you have your hair you got your
[2:10:31] dress many people will come oh God bless
[2:10:34] you okay they just signed their ticket
[2:10:36] you know make it easier to heaven but
[2:10:38] the ones that laugh at you they're going
[2:10:40] the other way and you didn't have to say
[2:10:42] a word just just show up the preacher
[2:10:45] called to preach his sermon and live it
[2:10:47] also if you can't live it then stop
[2:10:49] preaching but just supposed to live your
[2:10:52] sermons how we need in Jeffersonville
[2:10:55] and Dallas thousands of lived voices God
[2:10:59] on display let's say the Thunder of God
[2:11:02] thundering out in sweetness Holiness
[2:11:05] Purity undefiled lives walking around
[2:11:08] the earth without a blemish real
[2:11:10] Christians that's the Thunder against
[2:11:12] the enemy the devil doesn't care how
[2:11:14] loud you can holler the devil doesn't
[2:11:15] care how high you can jump how much you
[2:11:18] can do that or the other What Hurts The
[2:11:20] Devil is to see that Sanctified holy
[2:11:23] life consecrated to God say anything you
[2:11:26] want to him call him anything he's just
[2:11:29] as sweet as can be moves right on that
[2:11:32] throws him that's the Thunder that
[2:11:34] shakes the devil your individual
[2:11:37] Christian Life not because you know or
[2:11:41] you heard no your life so if we turn our
[2:11:44] back on the word of God and we've seen
[2:11:46] people do it maybe not
[2:11:48] openly just by indifference by a bad
[2:11:52] attitude I'm going this way
[2:11:54] instead fleeing from the presence of God
[2:11:58] and they're following an antichrist
[2:11:59] spirit and Antichrist Doctrine and soon
[2:12:02] they will be Anointed with arrogance
[2:12:04] selfishness self-righteous respective
[2:12:06] persons if we deviate one degree off a
[2:12:11] center we won't hit the target you got
[2:12:13] to stay perfectly balanced well I think
[2:12:17] I don't care what you think over here is
[2:12:19] truth and don't go the other way it's
[2:12:22] got to stay balanced if we deviate one
[2:12:25] degree okay Jonah was 180°
[2:12:29] off God worked it around but he had to
[2:12:33] pay a price don't you know he never
[2:12:36] never ate fish after that he wanted to
[2:12:39] stay so far away from
[2:12:42] fish so we got to see what God wants us
[2:12:46] to do don't deviate you know when Mary
[2:12:51] and Joseph went down to Jerusalem it's
[2:12:53] about 60 miles from Nazareth down to
[2:12:55] Jerusalem they went down every year for
[2:12:57] the feast and things and okay so it's a
[2:13:00] big family deal so now they're on their
[2:13:02] way back
[2:13:03] home and they're they're getting ready
[2:13:06] to set up camp the first night and Mary
[2:13:09] says to Joseph uh Joseph where's the boy
[2:13:14] I don't know thought it was your turn to
[2:13:15] watch
[2:13:16] him the boy wasn't with them they walked
[2:13:20] off and and left the promise of God how
[2:13:24] in the world well they thought it was
[2:13:25] with the Rel he's over there he wasn't
[2:13:27] there don't you know they had a not a
[2:13:30] very peaceful night that
[2:13:32] night so that's day one okay day two oh
[2:13:36] and they finally found him back there
[2:13:37] where they left him now if you'll notice
[2:13:40] the scripture a a normal Jewish mother
[2:13:43] you know in that predicament would have
[2:13:45] said oh dear have have you had anything
[2:13:47] to eat here let me get you some orange
[2:13:49] juice no she was so
[2:13:52] arrogant Jesus why did you do this I
[2:13:55] look bad you know I look terrible why
[2:13:59] didn't you stick with us she blamed him
[2:14:02] it's right there in the Bible so they
[2:14:05] left behind the promise of God and the
[2:14:07] same thing
[2:14:08] today thinking God is with them better
[2:14:12] balance things out be careful okay we're
[2:14:15] looking a few other things here before
[2:14:16] we before we quit but um the thing is
[2:14:20] you need look around be sensitive
[2:14:22] discern your surroundings be sure that
[2:14:25] he's with you check up our life our
[2:14:27] Doctrine our experience has to match
[2:14:29] God's word not brother David's opinion
[2:14:32] not no God's word you
[2:14:36] see God's word of the hour not match
[2:14:39] your imagination or your
[2:14:42] explanations we can't afford to live in
[2:14:45] the glare we've got to live today
[2:14:47] prepare for tomorrow we're on a journey
[2:14:50] we have have a
[2:14:51] destination the Gate of the
[2:14:54] resurrection and so in this day you know
[2:14:57] many Born Again Christians all all the
[2:14:59] people in Dallas they carrying a Bible
[2:15:01] they can't
[2:15:02] see correct baptism for some reason it's
[2:15:05] right there in their Bible you know well
[2:15:07] we've got a track you probably have it
[2:15:09] back here it's all about history and
[2:15:12] scripture brother Bram didn't invent
[2:15:14] acts 238 no he just repeated it so this
[2:15:18] this track shows Christian baptism you
[2:15:20] know
[2:15:21] so we don't want to be like religious
[2:15:24] tourists you know accumulating getting a
[2:15:27] little rock from here a little rock from
[2:15:29] there and a little flag and a little
[2:15:30] sticker no we want the life you see
[2:15:37] amen okay he says over here and standing
[2:15:39] at the door well that's the way it is
[2:15:41] today with people who call themselves
[2:15:43] Christians you say oh I belong to the
[2:15:45] church yeah there on on Central Avenue
[2:15:48] yeah that's good but you see the reason
[2:15:50] there's so much trouble in the
[2:15:53] church the reason there's so much
[2:15:55] confusion in the church so much
[2:15:57] discontent in the church is not that
[2:16:00] Jesus isn't there it's because Jesus
[2:16:02] can't gain access to the places he wants
[2:16:04] to go we have those little compartments
[2:16:07] oh don't touch that come in that's far
[2:16:10] enough I'll join the church I'll be
[2:16:13] there for every you know special
[2:16:14] occasion otherwise let me run my own
[2:16:16] business Jesus wants to be supreme ruler
[2:16:19] of your being and the only way that he
[2:16:21] can bless you is when he becomes your
[2:16:24] lord lord is rulership ownership who
[2:16:27] made you who has the right to replace in
[2:16:29] your heart the Creator Have No Secrets
[2:16:32] before him and when Jesus comes in he
[2:16:34] wants to be welcom well we've got little
[2:16:37] secret doors little bitty doors in our
[2:16:39] heart and we don't want Jesus in over to
[2:16:42] the right side of the human
[2:16:44] heart now you might know what he's
[2:16:46] talking about I mean this is the man
[2:16:48] that talked to the angel you know so
[2:16:50] leave it alone over in the right hand
[2:16:52] side of the human heart after Jesus gets
[2:16:54] in is a little bitty door called Pride
[2:16:59] oh I'll receive him as Savior but don't
[2:17:01] try to tell me how to run my how I
[2:17:03] should dress what I have to do if I have
[2:17:06] to have let my hair grow stop smoking
[2:17:09] quit going to the pool room I don't want
[2:17:11] nothing to do with it don't worry he
[2:17:12] won't stay too
[2:17:14] long no don't worry about it pride very
[2:17:18] very
[2:17:19] dangerous so so you cannot expect God to
[2:17:23] fix what you don't hand over to him you
[2:17:26] hold all this stuff to yourself he can't
[2:17:28] fix that you got to be open yes Lord I'm
[2:17:31] yours whatever you say so if he's not
[2:17:35] Lord of all and he is calling you today
[2:17:38] if he said anything to Your Heart during
[2:17:40] all of this then you must yield to him
[2:17:43] you see just let it
[2:17:45] go we can pray for you and this can be a
[2:17:49] turning point in your life you don't
[2:17:51] have to go on carrying that load got you
[2:17:53] all bound down so if the musicians would
[2:17:56] like to come please we'll try to wind
[2:17:58] this up we want you to leave here in
[2:18:01] peace don't leave burdened and feeling
[2:18:04] bad at somebody you can receive pardon
[2:18:07] he can change your will he can change
[2:18:10] your desires and put you on the right
[2:18:12] road to fulfill his will you see the
[2:18:16] word of God says in 1 Corinthians 2 but
[2:18:19] it is written I has not seen Ear Has Not
[2:18:22] Heard neither has entered into the heart
[2:18:24] of man the things which God ha prepared
[2:18:27] for them that love him but God hath
[2:18:30] revealed them unto us by his Spirit we
[2:18:33] are a special people we have seen the
[2:18:36] glory of God let's stand together let's

[2:19:49] bless you
[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:20:00] the Lord of
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:16] allus you
[2:20:17] know
[2:20:19] God has
[2:20:21] just so many marvelous ways of doing
[2:20:27] things but one thing God always does he
[2:20:30] always provides an
[2:20:33] opportunity he doesn't he doesn't leave
[2:20:37] you without the opportunity to
[2:20:43] change and what a word just to Simply
[2:20:48] say that we all ought
[2:20:51] to stop for a
[2:20:54] moment and just look at our
[2:20:57] lives and say am I am I in the will of
[2:21:00] the
[2:21:02] Lord and you know God's
[2:21:07] faithful you know and just like he said
[2:21:10] it the the message so beautiful you know
[2:21:13] if if you seek the kingdom of
[2:21:16] God and and you you you you you seek his
[2:21:22] will and you
[2:21:25] knock he's faithful to
[2:21:30] open you know if if you're up against
[2:21:33] something you know if you have a fear
[2:21:36] that's shackling your life you can't go
[2:21:39] forward in a relationship you you you it
[2:21:42] just seems like there's a great wall in
[2:21:46] front of you then he gives you the
[2:21:48] opportunity he'll make a way for you
[2:21:51] he'll he'll give a word to you he'll
[2:21:53] speak to you the scripture really says
[2:21:55] that he seeks you
[2:21:58] out you know and he puts a conviction on
[2:22:01] your heart he sews a seed in your your
[2:22:04] mind and your heart and and and he's
[2:22:07] he's reaches out to you to provide to
[2:22:11] you an
[2:22:13] opportunity and and he doesn't do that
[2:22:16] because he's he's he's not going to uh
[2:22:22] uh answer
[2:22:24] you you know he doesn't put put a
[2:22:27] conviction in your life about
[2:22:30] Sin if he's not prepared to forgive you
[2:22:33] for it amen you see he's not that kind
[2:22:36] of God right he doesn't come convict
[2:22:39] your heart and and and and make you feel
[2:22:42] oh I shouldn't have done that I uh you
[2:22:45] know uh if if he's not going to say i'
[2:22:48] I've done that to forgive you he's not
[2:22:52] going to challenge you to examine your
[2:22:56] life to see if you're in the will of God
[2:22:59] or not if he's not prepared to show you
[2:23:04] what his will
[2:23:09] is you see that that's what you've got
[2:23:11] to understand he he hasn't forsaken
[2:23:14] us he says I'll not forsake you nor
[2:23:17] leave you but I'll be with you even in
[2:23:21] you till the
[2:23:23] end so it when when you hear the word of
[2:23:26] God and it it the word of God is asking
[2:23:29] you to stop stop and look at
[2:23:33] yourself you know you may be smoking I
[2:23:36] don't care you can be a secret
[2:23:39] smoker you know what I mean but if he
[2:23:41] convicts you of it it's because he wants
[2:23:44] to deliver you of it he's not the kind
[2:23:48] of God that just wants to send you to
[2:23:50] hell thank you Lord oh you're a smoker
[2:23:53] I'm I'm I'm putting you under conviction
[2:23:55] cuz I want you to feel
[2:23:57] miserable that's not why he went to
[2:24:01] Calvary that's not why he he he took
[2:24:04] those stripes he took those stripes
[2:24:07] because he wants to heal
[2:24:09] you if you got things in your life that
[2:24:12] aren't right and you know they're not
[2:24:14] right the word of God comes along and
[2:24:17] says don't don't cover it up don't don't
[2:24:20] put on a religious covering you know but
[2:24:24] just be honest and you could say my life
[2:24:28] is not lining up to the word of God God
[2:24:32] is not telling you that just to let you
[2:24:36] know what he
[2:24:39] knows he's not saying I know your life
[2:24:42] isn't lined up to the word of God he
[2:24:45] doesn't have to show us that he's God
[2:24:48] Amen he created Heaven and Earth that's
[2:24:51] right he's trying to show
[2:24:54] you that if he tells you your life's not
[2:24:57] lined up he's really saying I want to
[2:25:00] line your life up I want to give you
[2:25:03] that Deliverance I want to do for you
[2:25:07] exceedingly and
[2:25:09] abundantly above what you can even ask
[2:25:12] or think you might even think of your
[2:25:16] deliverance I thought as he told that
[2:25:19] story of of of Jonah I wondered how many
[2:25:22] times Jonah rehearsed in his mind what
[2:25:26] he was going to say to
[2:25:32] Nineveh and finally he looked at it and
[2:25:36] he said I don't got nothing to say I'm
[2:25:38] out of
[2:25:41] here but God just took it and brought it
[2:25:46] around and made Jonah more successful
[2:25:50] than he would have ever
[2:25:53] been so maybe you've tried a hundred
[2:25:56] times maybe you've looked at your life
[2:25:58] over and over again and you don't think
[2:26:01] that there's one thing you can do if the
[2:26:04] Lord convicted you this
[2:26:07] morning it's not because he's that kind
[2:26:10] of God he's he's the kind of God to say
[2:26:12] I put you under conviction so I can show
[2:26:16] you the
[2:26:17] way and anybody that's ever been
[2:26:20] saved has got to the place where they
[2:26:24] didn't know what in the world am I going
[2:26:27] to
[2:26:29] do I cannot go on the way I'm going
[2:26:33] on I cannot continue this way something
[2:26:37] has got to happen in my
[2:26:40] life and they finally lifted their hands
[2:26:43] in
[2:26:44] desperation and said God help me God
[2:26:47] help me I don't know what I am
[2:26:50] but I'm not
[2:26:52] this I'm not someone that wants to be
[2:26:55] bitter I'm not one someone that wants to
[2:26:57] live in fear I'm not somebody that wants
[2:27:00] my
[2:27:02] past to rule over
[2:27:08] me that's a great kind of God he is he
[2:27:13] cares and if if you wait on him he
[2:27:18] promised that he'd renew knew your
[2:27:21] strength if you're sincere with him
[2:27:24] about your life and your life's
[2:27:27] Direction and the decisions you're
[2:27:30] making he will answer
[2:27:34] you and you know what the Zeal of this
[2:27:37] age is how many knows what the Zeal of
[2:27:40] this age is the Zeal of this age is to
[2:27:43] repent say I'm
[2:27:45] sorry I've been not going the right way
[2:27:50] and if you're willing to do
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:55] that if you're willing to do it he'll
[2:27:57] answer
[2:27:59] you I don't I don't have the
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:06] answer I am thankful
[2:28:08] though and I I I it's amazing I I I I
[2:28:12] said to brother George George when he
[2:28:16] come visit me he said Brother David now
[2:28:18] I want you to know no matter matter what
[2:28:20] we talk about the bread's already been
[2:28:24] sliced know as that means I have my
[2:28:26] sermon I'm going to preach what I'm
[2:28:28] going to preach and nothing's going to
[2:28:29] change
[2:28:30] it but we were fellowship and I and I
[2:28:33] think some of the brothers were with us
[2:28:35] and I said you
[2:28:37] know one of the greatest things brother
[2:28:39] Bram ever said was that he works his
[2:28:42] permissive will to his perfect
[2:28:46] will that gives me a lot of comfort amen
[2:28:50] so this morning ask yourself if there's
[2:28:54] things in your life
[2:28:56] that are
[2:28:59] permissive you ask for
[2:29:03] perfect if you have
[2:29:06] questions ask for
[2:29:09] answers if you have
[2:29:11] trouble ask for
[2:29:14] deliverance he said come unto me all ye
[2:29:17] that are heavy laden and I'll give you
[2:29:20] rest and in no
[2:29:22] wise will I cast you
[2:29:25] out do you believe that this
[2:29:28] morning he's here you say well I don't
[2:29:32] feel him he's here because he said he
[2:29:34] would be here
[2:29:37] amen and he can do exceedingly and
[2:29:40] abundantly above what we can ask or
[2:29:42] think because he said he can do
[2:29:45] exceedingly and
[2:29:47] abundantly and I just want to ask him my
[2:29:50] my
[2:29:51] life I just simply say
[2:29:54] Lord not my
[2:29:58] will but your will be done maybe we
[2:30:02] could sing that little song search me

[2:33:26] love Lord I I I'm lifting my hands to
[2:33:29] you this morning the most important
[2:33:32] thing in my life father is to be
[2:33:34] right and to be in your will if you'd
[2:33:37] like to lift your hands maybe you're so
[2:33:39] you're perfect it's not about me

[2:33:43] yourself
[2:33:52] and you'd say father I have a
[2:33:54] choice my will or your
[2:34:00] [Music]
[2:34:02] will my will or your will

[2:34:09] don't know I don't know whether I'm in
[2:34:11] my will or your
[2:34:13] will that question's not answered in my
[2:34:17] heart but I'm willing to be honest with
[2:34:20] myself and lift my hand and say Lord I
[2:34:22] don't
[2:34:24] know where I'm
[2:34:28] at and I'm putting my hand up that
[2:34:31] you'll give me that
[2:34:36] answer he'll see that
[2:34:39] hand he'll see that
[2:34:42] heart and he's
[2:34:45] faithful and if you ask him a sincere
[2:34:48] question he'll give you a sincere
[2:34:51] answer if you ask him for sincere
[2:34:54] leadership he will lead you yes and not
[2:34:57] forsake
[2:34:59] you so we just want to give you that
[2:35:01] opportunity this
[2:35:06] morning to pose

[2:35:13] your
[2:35:17] will am I in your will
