[42:24] amen god bless you
[42:25] amen
[42:27] let's open our bibles we're going to
[42:30] read couple more verses and then
[42:32] we'll continue where we left off this
[42:34] morning
[42:37] revelation chapter 5
[42:39] we'll just read couple of verses
[42:44] um let's read verse 9.
[42:47] let's start from verse 8 revelation
[42:49] chapter 5 verse 8 it says
[42:54] and when he had taken the book the four
[42:56] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[42:59] fell down before the lamb
[43:01] having every one of them a harp
[43:04] harps in golden
[43:06] vial full of the order
[43:09] which
[43:10] which are the prayers of the saints and
[43:12] they sung a new song
[43:14] saying thou are worthy to take the book
[43:17] and to open the seals thereof thou
[43:20] was slain
[43:22] and has redeemed us
[43:24] to god by the blood
[43:26] out of every kindred in tongue
[43:29] and people and nation
[43:31] it says and thou has made us unto our
[43:35] god kings and priests and we shall reign
[43:39] on earth amen we may have your seats
[43:45] man we just want to continue on
[43:48] with the same thought of the redeemer
[43:52] the song of the redeemed the song of
[43:54] redemption
[43:56] and just a reminder that
[43:58] we it's
[43:59] really the hard purpose
[44:02] is to bring us to remembrance of the
[44:04] things that we have received in this age
[44:08] to understand
[44:10] that
[44:11] we live in such a great hour and we
[44:13] don't want to
[44:15] be distracted
[44:17] we don't want to be pulled aside we
[44:19] don't want to lose focus
[44:21] but we we certainly want to be
[44:23] concentrated on the things that god is
[44:26] revealing this hour and the things that
[44:28] we know are promised to come to pass
[44:31] and you would ask the question you know
[44:34] i was
[44:35] when this uh just thought came to my
[44:37] heart
[44:38] uh
[44:39] the primary reason is to just kind of i
[44:42] realize
[44:43] uh some of the young believers that may
[44:45] not understand what is what is the
[44:47] message
[44:48] why do we believe what we believe and
[44:50] what do what is it about the seventh
[44:52] angels and the seven seals what does
[44:54] that even have to do with me
[44:56] just to come to the understanding that
[44:58] what god god has done in this hour had
[45:01] never done be done before and it was
[45:04] only reserved for this generation
[45:06] we're not like methodists we're not like
[45:08] baptists we're not like god done great
[45:11] things with them
[45:12] but then in the final hour we are those
[45:15] that god have called for this last final
[45:17] work that he's doing
[45:19] and so i thought it's important that we
[45:22] are not like the man that was living
[45:24] close by the sea by the ocean
[45:26] who came and you know he became so
[45:28] familiar to him he would look at it and
[45:31] and he saw someone visiting and excited
[45:34] about the ocean and he's looking at him
[45:35] he's like what are you so excited about
[45:37] we don't want to be those kind of
[45:38] believers we want to be those uh
[45:41] so excited with what god has done in
[45:44] this age and i'm not talking about
[45:45] excitement just to talk about it but
[45:47] leaving an expectation to show those
[45:50] things come to pass
[45:52] living in the expectation that one of
[45:54] these days i'm going to take the next
[45:56] step and i won't be here one of the
[45:58] steps one of this morning the meeting in
[46:00] the air is going to take place one of
[46:02] this morning it's not long anymore
[46:05] we have gone for so many years and we
[46:07] remember we live in borrow time so one
[46:10] or this morning this is going to come to
[46:11] pass
[46:12] and just be under the expectation to see
[46:15] god bring it to pass in our lives and so
[46:18] he
[46:19] david speaks in psalm 40 and 3 and he
[46:22] said he had put a new song in my mouth
[46:26] even praise unto our god it says many
[46:30] shall see it and fear
[46:32] and shall trust in the lord so you see
[46:35] the same theme going over and over about
[46:38] what god is doing how that it's his work
[46:41] that gives you a song it's what he has
[46:44] done that actually brings you to come to
[46:46] a place where you can sing about it it's
[46:48] it's the work that he promised when he
[46:50] comes and he does it it becomes a song
[46:52] to your life
[46:53] isaiah 42 and 10 it says sing unto the
[46:56] lord a new song
[46:59] and his praise from the end of the earth
[47:02] he says ye go it says ye go down in the
[47:05] sea
[47:06] and all
[47:08] that that are there in the isles and the
[47:10] inhabitation thereof
[47:13] psalm 104 108
[47:15] verse 2 and 3 says awake
[47:18] sultry and harp it says
[47:20] i myself will awake early i will praise
[47:24] thee o god oh lord among the people and
[47:28] i will sing praises unto unto thee among
[47:31] the nations so where we are and as we
[47:34] come back to this age like we said this
[47:37] morning we are commanded to sing a new
[47:40] song
[47:41] we are we've been giving a new song that
[47:43] we could live our lives by a new song
[47:46] that we can walk by a new song that we
[47:49] can prophesy by because remember when
[47:51] the lamb took the book when he came and
[47:54] we'll read those things shortly here in
[47:56] revelation chapter 10 when he came
[47:59] remember john in revelation chapter 5
[48:02] when they began to sing they began to
[48:04] sing and he sang that song but when he
[48:06] came at the end in revelation chapter 10
[48:09] and he gave the book to the angel the
[48:11] book was given so john can eat it it
[48:13] says when you eat it you shall prophesy
[48:16] so the book whatever we are prophesying
[48:19] is not coming from us it's coming from
[48:21] the eating of the book
[48:23] and therefore we have to you can't sing
[48:25] a new song if you haven't eat the book
[48:29] you're going to continue to sing the old
[48:31] song you're going to continue to think
[48:33] the old way but the new life come by the
[48:36] eating of the new book
[48:38] the prophecy come by the eating of the
[48:40] book it's all connected together
[48:42] and so in this generation if i may
[48:45] reiterate it again now i'll say a song
[48:48] is connected to worship and is connected
[48:51] to the worshiper but in this generation
[48:53] i said this morning we have been given
[48:56] the sum of all that god done
[49:00] all together plus more
[49:03] uh you you see because permanent speaks
[49:05] about how that this age the final age it
[49:08] says it's the totality of all the evil
[49:11] combined together that is coming brought
[49:14] towards the end and and that's what we
[49:16] see as the manifestation of it outside
[49:18] but he says it's the same what god has
[49:21] done he's come and he received reserve
[49:23] for the end time he's now giving the
[49:26] best of what he has
[49:28] god himself is coming down it's not even
[49:31] so much that is sending you and say in
[49:33] the first age we know that they had a
[49:35] messenger that came and the second
[49:37] messenger that came but then in the end
[49:39] time we'll get to it in a short time he
[49:42] sends one and and he says the messenger
[49:46] of the end the seventh angel messenger
[49:49] will have two jobs to do one of them
[49:51] will be to tie the loose ends in other
[49:54] words he will come and take all the
[49:56] other messengers in fact he would even
[49:59] place them throughout the church it will
[50:02] come the truth that we left out and
[50:04] things that were unexplained things that
[50:06] were not properly and now i'm speaking
[50:08] about his sage i'm speaking why we
[50:10] believe what we believe and i'm speaking
[50:12] about the power of it so he comes he
[50:15] lays out all the messengers lays out and
[50:18] he comes all the truths that were not
[50:20] properly explained the things that were
[50:22] left out he ties all the loose hands
[50:24] that was one part of his ministry but
[50:26] the next part was to reveal all the
[50:29] mysteries
[50:32] to reveal all the mysteries the plan of
[50:35] god what he wanted to do from the
[50:37] beginning what was hidden in god's back
[50:39] part of the mind the whole plane of
[50:41] redemption so you are sitting here with
[50:44] the whole word of god being revealed
[50:48] you are sitting here with a king's sword
[50:50] may i say
[50:53] god it's not just this send you some
[50:55] words and you know we'll get to it who
[50:57] says then he was praying in slovenia
[51:00] canyon and he says then something
[51:02] touched my hand and i look it was the
[51:04] the king's sword that came down he's not
[51:06] well perhaps it's just a king sore is
[51:09] there some king's sword that came into
[51:11] my hand and he said he feed it so
[51:13] perfectly if it it's open why because he
[51:16] was born to do that job he was born for
[51:20] that moment in other words
[51:22] this
[51:23] all that he had done until that time was
[51:26] only in preparation of what god was
[51:28] about to do at that particular moment
[51:31] so he comes and he holds it within his
[51:34] hand and says i thought perhaps it's a
[51:36] king's sword and he said no this is the
[51:39] king's sword this is the very word of
[51:42] god this is god's sword himself
[51:45] and and let me say this and i thought if
[51:48] it was the king's sword and it's placed
[51:51] because remember he says if all it takes
[51:53] is the sword what you need is a hand of
[51:56] faith to hold it and drive it in the
[51:58] heart of the enemy so he's giving you
[52:01] the best for you to go fight with he's
[52:03] giving you the best that he has so you
[52:06] can go and kill the enemy now remember
[52:08] after this there shall no more be any
[52:10] enemies this is the finality of what the
[52:13] devil is going to be because this bride
[52:16] is going to go out of here triumphant is
[52:18] going to destroy the enemy she's not
[52:21] going to go out of here with the enemy
[52:23] on the tail and everything after this
[52:25] we're going into the millennium
[52:33] so he says
[52:38] i thought it was so
[52:42] fading
[52:44] because remember
[52:46] he's starting off
[52:49] this isn't a message to preach
[52:51] he's starting off with that testimony
[52:53] about the king's sword
[52:56] and he said well i wonder what it meant
[53:00] that is the king's sword and i thought
[53:03] this is paragraph 13. he says
[53:05] if he would say a king sword
[53:08] i might have
[53:09] i might have been that it would have i
[53:11] would have understood it
[53:12] but he said
[53:14] the king's sword
[53:18] so may i not it says it says
[53:21] so i may not have have it right
[53:23] but i thought there's only one
[53:26] king there's no only one d king
[53:30] that's god
[53:32] and his sword
[53:34] is this
[53:35] it says sharper than two edges to it two
[53:38] edges so hereby if he abide in you and
[53:40] my words abiding you and then don only
[53:43] says then it takes the strength of a man
[53:47] dueling because his sword would be
[53:50] pointed to my heart and mind to his
[53:53] but they're
[53:54] locked as our knives are striking each
[53:57] other's and that they strike and then
[54:00] the sword came together and the only
[54:03] thing that can shove it out in the other
[54:06] any one down it says it's once it says
[54:10] down the sword straight down to the
[54:12] heart so it takes so it takes even
[54:15] though the sword would be the word it
[54:18] takes the hand
[54:20] of it takes a strong hand of faith
[54:23] to hold it
[54:25] so the king's sword
[54:28] now i want you to realize even as both
[54:31] whatever is saying is
[54:33] it's very important to understand that
[54:35] satan hates revelation
[54:39] because now this is the we we're dealing
[54:42] with the book of revelation
[54:44] because here he is god is now revealing
[54:49] and i'll say this god is exposing the
[54:51] devil
[54:52] and revealing who you truly are
[54:55] and brother enemy is saying this is the
[54:57] king's sword
[54:58] so in other words he's letting you know
[55:01] this is what's going to end the battle
[55:03] this is what's going to end all of it so
[55:06] if you take this word because remember
[55:08] when he says the king so i want to say
[55:10] this this message is the king's sword
[55:14] this revealed word of god is the king's
[55:16] soul i don't want you to think of some
[55:18] physical sword or something no this is
[55:21] what was put in his hands
[55:23] and so if you take the king's sword that
[55:25] was put in his hand you drive it to the
[55:28] enemy's heart you're going to end up
[55:30] victorious
[55:32] that's what he's telling you so he's
[55:34] saying satan hates revelation why
[55:36] because revelation exposes him and shows
[55:40] him what he's gonna end up being this
[55:42] message is open to us and it showed us
[55:45] the satan is just a bluff for the first
[55:48] time
[55:49] for the first time we understand that at
[55:52] calvary all the power had been taken out
[55:54] of him all his teeth had been knocked
[55:57] out of him and all that he's been doing
[55:59] is just going and barking like a roaring
[56:01] lion but no strength at all because the
[56:04] power of death was taken for him because
[56:07] remember that was the greatest power and
[56:09] then remember it was the greatest power
[56:11] because you can go back to israel
[56:13] remember the last flag was death and
[56:15] then so to the even to the mankind the
[56:18] last power that man could not overcome
[56:20] was death but when christ came and died
[56:23] what he did is he came to death not that
[56:26] he annihilated death but he took power
[56:28] out of death so even when a believer
[56:31] comes in contact with death death has no
[56:33] power against him
[56:36] so now he comes and he takes and he
[56:39] takes power over death and now in the
[56:41] revealing of the end time when he's
[56:43] coming and the purpose is because he had
[56:46] already paid the price that was only you
[56:49] say well he said christ said it was all
[56:51] finished yes it was finished but i need
[56:53] to remind you that the when it came the
[56:56] first time that was a sacrificial lamb
[56:58] that was given he came to pay the price
[57:02] for the sin that man committed he came
[57:04] to do that and that was the mission that
[57:06] he came to do and as far as the price is
[57:08] concerned that was done completed but
[57:11] remember redemption has to part he
[57:13] needed to come and claim that which he
[57:16] paid the price for and he didn't do it
[57:18] that time but when he says that only
[57:21] happens at the end time
[57:26] only at the end time
[57:28] you know i was thinking i said
[57:30] oh my no wonder
[57:32] all the prophets
[57:34] all the men that ever leave it
[57:38] all of them
[57:39] because i'll i'll say this but it says
[57:42] when that book was being opened it says
[57:44] elijah was there
[57:45] they all they all they were all waiting
[57:48] for this great event to take place after
[57:51] they had done the part that they played
[57:52] a part oh they were in such anticipation
[57:56] waiting to see what's going to come to
[57:58] pass
[58:01] amen
[58:03] so i want to say this
[58:06] and in revelation chapter five
[58:08] but when i'm and i'll just go
[58:10] uh read it and and and and perhaps just
[58:13] walk through it
[58:14] as we go along so we we said it only
[58:17] happens at the end time now we we we
[58:20] understand the order of it is revelation
[58:22] chapter 5 happens and then after that we
[58:25] jump over to revelation chapter 10. so
[58:28] he takes the book from revelation
[58:29] chapter 5 and then revelation chapter 10
[58:32] that's when he comes down for the book
[58:34] with the book open for him to give to
[58:36] the angel so he says this and i saw in
[58:39] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[58:41] throne this is a revelation
[58:44] a written
[58:44] a book written within and on the
[58:47] backside and still with seven seals and
[58:49] prabhupada says this is the book of
[58:51] redemption
[58:53] this is the title deed this is the title
[58:56] deed or the right to eternal life that
[58:58] was given now and i want to say this we
[59:00] know that adam lost that when he sinned
[59:04] adam fulfilled his right but says he
[59:06] write to his right to eternal life and
[59:09] his right to the earth because it was
[59:11] god of the earth god created them to be
[59:13] the god of the earth and and
[59:16] tells us that satan could not touch that
[59:18] book
[59:19] with his dirty hands in other words when
[59:22] when adam lost it that book went right
[59:24] back to the original owner
[59:27] now but i want to say this but also
[59:29] remember the book god didn't make the
[59:32] book for himself
[59:35] no he was god over all things he was god
[59:38] of the earth and god of heaven and god
[59:39] of all things he didn't need a book he
[59:42] made the book it was the title deed that
[59:44] he made and it was he made it for man
[59:47] he made it solely for man so when man
[59:50] came and he lost the book he lost the
[59:52] power over all nature
[59:54] he lost his ability to control nature he
[59:57] lost his ability to rule over nature he
[1:00:00] lost his ability now where he was the
[1:00:02] god of the earth and we know barbara
[1:00:05] will tell us that god will come down in
[1:00:07] the cool of the evening and fellowship
[1:00:08] with men and and find out what adam has
[1:00:11] been busy doing and he'll find out that
[1:00:13] perhaps he moved some trees and moved
[1:00:15] some mountains and did some things and
[1:00:17] they'll sit around and they will talk
[1:00:19] and they will fellowship about those
[1:00:21] things but when he lost when he when he
[1:00:23] when he sinned all of that was taken
[1:00:26] away from him he lost the fellowship now
[1:00:28] he never stopped being a son
[1:00:30] but he's lost his fellowship that's why
[1:00:32] when one backslide if it's a seed
[1:00:36] god cannot annihilate his own seed
[1:00:38] god god cannot create something and then
[1:00:41] lose it
[1:00:42] god is because what whatever he creates
[1:00:46] it's part of himself whatever he makes
[1:00:49] is part of himself whatever it does is
[1:00:52] extension of who he is so adam adam
[1:00:56] though he was uh separated from god but
[1:00:59] yet he was still a son
[1:01:02] and so we say as we said redemption has
[1:01:05] to process and and god was coming the
[1:01:08] first part that he came and he came and
[1:01:10] he paid the price but then the time for
[1:01:12] the redemption claim had to come and we
[1:01:15] find out that jesus paid the price but
[1:01:18] when him makes a statement he says it
[1:01:20] this way it says what what the law
[1:01:22] required what the law required grace
[1:01:26] provided
[1:01:29] what what the law required grace
[1:01:32] provided and i want to say this because
[1:01:34] remember when fellowship was lost
[1:01:38] we we go right back in the old testament
[1:01:40] we see that uh
[1:01:42] there was a way provided or god's
[1:01:45] provided way was then for offer
[1:01:46] sacrifice they came and they offered
[1:01:49] burnt offerings and they did all of
[1:01:50] those things and they came by which they
[1:01:53] would come and offer to god uh and then
[1:01:57] we realized that uh by the offering of
[1:01:59] the sacrifice i was not good enough
[1:02:01] because the sacrifice would be offered
[1:02:03] but the life of the sacrifice could not
[1:02:05] come up on the worshiper because it was
[1:02:08] a lesser life but that happened not
[1:02:10] happen until christ came and now when
[1:02:13] christ came it was the first time when
[1:02:16] actually the life of the sacrifice the
[1:02:20] life that was given could actually come
[1:02:22] upon a person
[1:02:24] it would actually come upon a person and
[1:02:26] make the worshiper perfect
[1:02:29] and then that was offered but that was
[1:02:31] not the final of it and let me say this
[1:02:33] when that happened
[1:02:35] uh we we got into another stage where
[1:02:39] when men sit
[1:02:40] what happened it came and we receive
[1:02:43] what is known as the token
[1:02:45] or we receive
[1:02:47] a portion a seal
[1:02:48] to unto the day of our redemption
[1:02:52] so you may ask well what happened to
[1:02:54] paul and what happened to all of them
[1:02:56] even what happened to all the believers
[1:02:58] throughout the ages
[1:03:00] when those that came after christ died
[1:03:03] what happened is god released upon his
[1:03:06] own spirit because remember he was a
[1:03:08] sacrifice when christ died he promised
[1:03:11] the holy spirit on the day of pentecost
[1:03:13] and all of those that believe on him
[1:03:16] receive of his spirit and they became
[1:03:18] sons and daughters of god
[1:03:23] they became sons and daughters they
[1:03:25] received the token they received the
[1:03:27] seal unto the day of redemption unto
[1:03:31] what unto the final day unto this day it
[1:03:35] it didn't mean that all was over now as
[1:03:37] far as their saving was there was safe
[1:03:39] there were suns there's nothing that
[1:03:42] could break the seal because remember
[1:03:43] the seal satisfies three things one of
[1:03:46] them is that the price has been paid the
[1:03:49] other is security but the other is
[1:03:52] ownership
[1:03:54] so when something has already been
[1:03:56] sealed it means that no one could touch
[1:03:59] it it means that it could never be lost
[1:04:02] and it means that it belonged to god and
[1:04:04] no one can touch it so that was what was
[1:04:06] happening until that time but that was
[1:04:09] not the end of it because there was also
[1:04:11] a promise for redemption where
[1:04:14] here they are with just the spirit
[1:04:16] moving upon them and and it says in that
[1:04:20] state they were still groaning
[1:04:25] and so we are this tonight
[1:04:28] you know he said
[1:04:29] they would walk up and
[1:04:32] perhaps sickness striking
[1:04:35] and then
[1:04:36] that perfect man inside began to groan
[1:04:39] for a well body
[1:04:42] you will go and you will see something
[1:04:44] happening it just didn't happen the way
[1:04:46] you want it or someone will pass away
[1:04:49] oh you would see and the spirit with him
[1:04:51] is groaning
[1:04:53] he would say even nature groan
[1:04:56] because nature wanted to see a son of
[1:04:58] god in control
[1:05:00] nature grown
[1:05:01] for the manifestation of true sons and
[1:05:03] daughters of god at the end time so even
[1:05:06] in this state yet we are with a seal
[1:05:08] within our heart
[1:05:10] with a seal with the permanent security
[1:05:13] knowing that we'll never be lost but yet
[1:05:15] we are we are longing for the full
[1:05:17] redemption to come into manifestation
[1:05:23] so he says
[1:05:26] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:05:28] with a loud voice who is worthy to take
[1:05:30] the book and to lose the seal thereof
[1:05:33] and no man in heaven or in earth or in
[1:05:36] earth
[1:05:37] neither under the earth was to was able
[1:05:40] to open the book
[1:05:41] neither to look upon
[1:05:44] now
[1:05:45] i want you to realize it says no man was
[1:05:47] found worthy and for foreign uses it to
[1:05:50] say that
[1:05:51] this is why
[1:05:53] uh when when john looked he realized
[1:05:56] what was happening
[1:05:57] and he realized what was happening and
[1:05:59] john began to cry because he realized
[1:06:02] that if no one took that book that we
[1:06:05] will be lost
[1:06:07] in other words i want to say this john
[1:06:09] realized the importance of that book
[1:06:13] he realized the importance of the moment
[1:06:15] and the importance of the book
[1:06:17] and if we sit here and we are
[1:06:20] the type because remember john is
[1:06:23] considered the type of the bride then we
[1:06:25] need to understand the importance of the
[1:06:27] book
[1:06:28] then we need to understand the
[1:06:29] importance of that moment then we need
[1:06:32] to be under the same expectation because
[1:06:34] he wanted to see that book taken and he
[1:06:37] wanted to see it broken he says john
[1:06:39] knew that his name was on that book and
[1:06:42] i trust this morning that you know your
[1:06:44] name is on the book
[1:06:48] so no but random says that no angels
[1:06:51] could touch it
[1:06:52] and the reason was because they had to
[1:06:55] be a kinsmen redeemer they had to be one
[1:06:58] that was born in the family of the man
[1:07:01] one who was a man himself but who's
[1:07:03] never done anything wrong they had to be
[1:07:06] one who's able an angel couldn't take
[1:07:09] your place
[1:07:10] oh i like that no one can take your
[1:07:12] place no one he said he had to be born
[1:07:15] of the same family they had to be one
[1:07:17] who's akin to you
[1:07:19] and that's why christ came by the virgin
[1:07:22] birth and he came and he was conceived
[1:07:24] and he was born and he came and he took
[1:07:26] your place so you can take his
[1:07:30] now if god takes your place you become a
[1:07:32] sinner who do you become
[1:07:35] you become gods
[1:07:37] you become him
[1:07:39] let's not be afraid of those things my
[1:07:41] brother my sister
[1:07:42] i feel like every time we talk about it
[1:07:44] people gets timid and people start to
[1:07:46] look at it it's like what do you mean
[1:07:48] i'm god you are gods
[1:07:50] i'm speaking to gods i'm speaking oh my
[1:07:54] let me just jump forward now now
[1:07:56] remember when the book opens the
[1:07:58] reference that is coming to you right
[1:08:00] after that everything after that it's no
[1:08:03] longer the reference of you in your
[1:08:05] flesh or how you were born or how you
[1:08:07] came to the earth the reference was that
[1:08:09] he was with you in the beginning
[1:08:18] let's not be afraid of what god sent us
[1:08:21] to save us
[1:08:22] let's not walk be afraid of walking up
[1:08:25] in the morning and say i am god this is
[1:08:28] the domain that god has given me i'm
[1:08:30] gonna conquer it like a god i'm gonna
[1:08:33] treat it like a god i'm gonna treat my
[1:08:35] wife like a god i'm gonna treat my
[1:08:38] children like a god i'm gonna treat them
[1:08:40] like god treats me why because he's
[1:08:42] placed me here to conquer over my job
[1:08:45] i'm a god i'm this that's what you've
[1:08:48] been put here for
[1:08:50] why do you think the world is getting
[1:08:52] worse if so you can go out there and
[1:08:55] conquer it
[1:09:03] we're not gonna finish
[1:09:12] i know you love the word i i love the
[1:09:14] lord
[1:09:15] i love the word so much
[1:09:17] i tell you there's nothing that just
[1:09:19] burns my bounds like that
[1:09:21] because it's it's so much given to us to
[1:09:24] walk in it
[1:09:25] and and oftentimes when i when our lives
[1:09:28] get far away from it it's just so sad
[1:09:31] because this is our life this is life
[1:09:34] the work we do out there is not life
[1:09:37] going a job and do this that's not if
[1:09:40] that's all we live for we are the most
[1:09:41] miserable people that is on the face of
[1:09:43] the earth but when you take this you put
[1:09:45] it on top of that it makes all the sense
[1:09:47] in the world
[1:09:49] so he had to be one who was a kinsmen
[1:09:52] redeemer someone from the same family
[1:09:55] and god became a man
[1:09:58] so we may take his place
[1:10:00] and barbara says his grace provided what
[1:10:04] law was requiring
[1:10:06] the law was if the day you eat this you
[1:10:09] shall die so death was required
[1:10:12] but it says that was a law requirement
[1:10:14] grace came in provided
[1:10:16] and he said in one place it says god
[1:10:18] provided the bleach
[1:10:22] he provided the bleach something that
[1:10:24] can annihilate everything and leave no
[1:10:27] sign behind you're like oh there was
[1:10:30] just a mark here why poor oblate and see
[1:10:32] what happens god came in the but ranam
[1:10:35] says one place it says it it's like you
[1:10:37] you take whatever happens you take the
[1:10:40] stain it's probably a composition of
[1:10:42] molecule a and b and this and this he
[1:10:44] says god takes all of that composition
[1:10:47] he breaks it all apart he returns it
[1:10:50] into what it was in before he became
[1:10:54] only god can do this
[1:10:56] only he has to have the power to
[1:10:58] remember the difference was satan wanted
[1:11:01] to be like god but what he liked is he
[1:11:03] liked the power of creation that's why
[1:11:06] he came after you he wanted to be like
[1:11:08] god but it was just a one that could
[1:11:10] just twist it and twist things and
[1:11:12] modify it and deform it and deform it
[1:11:15] but yet god has the power not just to
[1:11:17] take what was deformed and bring it
[1:11:19] right but it was able to bring it out of
[1:11:21] nothing
[1:11:22] just bring it into existence
[1:11:27] it says and then i wipe because no man
[1:11:30] was
[1:11:31] found worthy to open
[1:11:33] oh
[1:11:35] the book to open and to open and to read
[1:11:39] the book
[1:11:41] it says neither to look upon
[1:11:43] aren't you glad the way the lamb is
[1:11:45] worthy
[1:11:47] aren't you glad the lamb is able to take
[1:11:49] the book
[1:11:50] aren't you glad the islam he came
[1:11:53] and he took the book and john knew the
[1:11:56] importance of the book as we said it he
[1:11:58] knew that if no one was able to take it
[1:12:00] the whole creation will be lost
[1:12:03] and so john is a type of the bride so so
[1:12:06] we have to understand the importance of
[1:12:07] that book and and and then so we
[1:12:10] realized that the that the message
[1:12:13] he talks to us in the message it says
[1:12:15] now when the when the he takes the book
[1:12:18] yes but one of them says that the end
[1:12:21] time message will meet the challenge of
[1:12:23] the hour
[1:12:27] the end time message will meet the
[1:12:29] challenge of the all and then he says
[1:12:31] the end time message will meet the end
[1:12:33] time condition
[1:12:35] and i want to ask you because remember
[1:12:38] when he did this he talks about how we
[1:12:41] have the devil's answer
[1:12:45] we have now they
[1:12:48] think about this we are challenging the
[1:12:50] devil
[1:12:51] for the word that has been revealed to
[1:12:53] us and telling him you have no place
[1:12:56] anymore in the body of christ you this
[1:12:59] pride has the same power of overcoming
[1:13:02] as christ did this bride can do the
[1:13:05] works that christ did this bride in fact
[1:13:09] is the manifestation of christ in the
[1:13:12] end time
[1:13:14] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:13:16] question i ask you what's the question
[1:13:21] what's the question
[1:13:23] you come up with the question the answer
[1:13:25] is here
[1:13:28] whatever you want come up with a
[1:13:30] question
[1:13:32] listen let me say this but random comes
[1:13:34] and he says when you talk about the the
[1:13:35] creation of the squirrel he says when he
[1:13:38] comes he says how do you want the scroll
[1:13:40] to jump he he said i give some
[1:13:42] ridiculous answer drop from here jump
[1:13:45] over there and do this over here this is
[1:13:47] a then appear over here and it happened
[1:13:54] i mean you're like it's not even
[1:13:57] how do you perceive this this is a son
[1:14:00] of god coming into full redemption the
[1:14:03] manifestation of it you talk about okay
[1:14:05] where are we going to this is what i'm
[1:14:08] talking about someone who's so fully
[1:14:10] surrendered in god's hand who's fully
[1:14:12] surrendered where his words god's obey
[1:14:16] where he speaks and the angel move where
[1:14:19] he doesn't have to scream he doesn't
[1:14:21] like brother said we sex people here we
[1:14:23] move him up and we scream we think if we
[1:14:26] do that god will hear us no just knowing
[1:14:28] that i've been given the authority to
[1:14:31] speak the word and it will come to pass
[1:14:36] we are moving into a maturity now
[1:14:38] remember when a church started he came
[1:14:41] they they obeyed the word and moved to
[1:14:43] where they are the spirit came and moved
[1:14:45] upon them and they did signs and wonders
[1:14:48] and yes we go throughout the church
[1:14:51] edges there were imperfection you know
[1:14:53] there were things they had to move from
[1:14:55] sanctification to justification to all
[1:14:57] those things and everything but even the
[1:14:59] baptism of the holy ghost they came into
[1:15:01] and all of that but that's not the end
[1:15:03] of it because remember the baptism of
[1:15:05] the holy ghost is only the beginning
[1:15:08] it's the sale but god wants to take you
[1:15:10] even higher into the adoptions of sons
[1:15:14] into those that will speak the world
[1:15:17] those that are representative of christ
[1:15:19] on earth those that knows that i have
[1:15:21] been placed here for me to perform at
[1:15:24] work
[1:15:27] not just to hold my job and
[1:15:30] to feed my family and go home
[1:15:34] it's in this revelation
[1:15:37] that we are promised the rapture
[1:15:38] condition will come
[1:15:43] my mind to my sister
[1:15:45] it's not another word
[1:15:47] it's not anything else it's this word
[1:15:50] this message
[1:15:51] the revealing of christ in the end time
[1:15:56] it says
[1:15:58] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:16:01] whip not
[1:16:03] or behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:16:05] the root of the root of david
[1:16:08] had prevailed
[1:16:10] to open the book
[1:16:12] and to lose the silo
[1:16:14] and i want to say this only the lamb
[1:16:17] could open the book
[1:16:19] only the lamb
[1:16:21] could open the seals
[1:16:23] no one else could
[1:16:25] and i'm here to announce to you this is
[1:16:27] not brother branham's message
[1:16:29] it's not the lamb
[1:16:31] the lamb came and used him
[1:16:33] so he can open the seals
[1:16:35] it's the lamb's message
[1:16:38] it's the one who overcame the victory
[1:16:41] belonged to the lamb it's always the
[1:16:44] lamb when you hear the lamb you have to
[1:16:46] know that the price was paid that he won
[1:16:48] victory when you hear the word lamb know
[1:16:51] that he was the sacrificial that was
[1:16:53] given and after the sacrifice was given
[1:16:56] victory was won and therefore you have
[1:16:59] the power and the authority
[1:17:01] and so we have to understand we could
[1:17:04] look at this and and know that
[1:17:06] it's it's important because
[1:17:09] and i was thinking about this
[1:17:12] and this is where
[1:17:14] people run into confusion because
[1:17:18] we talk about the opening of the seals
[1:17:20] and and the things thereof and people
[1:17:22] will wonder what it actually means
[1:17:24] because
[1:17:26] we understand all of those things are
[1:17:27] connected to the rapture and the coming
[1:17:29] of the lord
[1:17:30] now
[1:17:32] if you
[1:17:33] some of the things perhaps the way that
[1:17:35] was easier for me to understand or
[1:17:37] perhaps to assimilate some of these
[1:17:39] things you when when jesus came for the
[1:17:42] first time when john was presenting him
[1:17:45] we saw it was a very clear picture that
[1:17:48] was set before us we saw john in the
[1:17:51] water at jordan and we see jesus coming
[1:17:54] and john and and jesus came to john
[1:17:56] where branham says what is it the word
[1:17:59] always comes to the prophet
[1:18:01] now he
[1:18:03] he's saying that because they want you
[1:18:04] to understand what's going to happen
[1:18:06] next over here so the word always comes
[1:18:09] to the prophet so the prophet is here
[1:18:11] the word comes to the prophet and the
[1:18:13] prophet presents the word to the people
[1:18:15] this is the lamb of god this is the lamb
[1:18:18] of god that was given for sacrifice he
[1:18:21] see his ear to give his life so he
[1:18:23] baptized jesus and he presents him but
[1:18:25] in the end time here he is but branham
[1:18:28] says we'll read it there is a heavenly
[1:18:30] messenger who comes down with a book but
[1:18:33] there's only one earthly messenger so
[1:18:35] what he says is the heavenly messenger
[1:18:37] hands the book down to the earthly
[1:18:39] messenger who takes it and proclaims it
[1:18:42] so people wonder where where is christ
[1:18:44] or where is he i can't see him well in
[1:18:47] order for you to see him you have to see
[1:18:48] the same person the one who declared him
[1:18:51] to come he's the one who presents him
[1:18:54] you say how is that i said go read the
[1:18:56] third exodus because brahmanam says the
[1:18:58] same thing happened god said i am come
[1:19:01] down and i'm sending you moses so if god
[1:19:05] came down why didn't god go
[1:19:08] when when
[1:19:09] you ask a question when pharaoh see when
[1:19:12] he came before pharaoh who did pharaoh
[1:19:15] see he saw moses and god and the prophet
[1:19:18] answered that question he says god went
[1:19:20] into the form of a man
[1:19:22] god went into moses so he can speak and
[1:19:25] it's the same time in this third
[1:19:27] accident it's no different than any god
[1:19:30] came down but what form did he use he
[1:19:33] used the form of a messenger
[1:19:45] we live in wonderful times
[1:19:50] sometimes i feel like i could just run
[1:19:52] in the wilderness somewhere and just
[1:19:54] stay there forever just myself and just
[1:19:56] sing and shout and just have a jubilee
[1:19:59] this is the lord
[1:20:01] this is the word of god being manifested
[1:20:04] this is not some gimmick this is not men
[1:20:07] trying to insert some understanding or
[1:20:09] something this is what god is doing and
[1:20:12] i want to say this don't be offended by
[1:20:14] that why because the same way he used a
[1:20:17] messenger to dwell in him to do he wants
[1:20:19] to do the same for you
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:23] by not believing that you're blocking it
[1:20:25] for yourself you're not understanding
[1:20:27] the plan in his totality the plan is not
[1:20:30] just for him to be in the messenger but
[1:20:32] for him to be in his voice
[1:20:46] he took the book
[1:20:49] and he broke the seal thereof
[1:20:52] no man was worthy
[1:20:55] and we are not worthy within ourselves
[1:20:58] because when we say ourselves our
[1:21:01] description of ourselves is the way we
[1:21:03] were brought up how we were born where
[1:21:05] we come from and everything
[1:21:07] but oh if we can change our description
[1:21:10] of ourselves
[1:21:11] into what he actually says into what he
[1:21:15] actually calls you to be
[1:21:17] into what he actually presents you to be
[1:21:22] it says
[1:21:24] and i be held and low in the midst of
[1:21:26] the throne look at where he is
[1:21:29] in the midst of the throne
[1:21:33] in the midst of the throne and
[1:21:35] and after four beasts
[1:21:37] and of in the midst of the elders
[1:21:40] stood the lamb as if as he has been
[1:21:42] slain
[1:21:44] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:21:46] were the seventh spirit of god
[1:21:48] sent forth in all the earth and we know
[1:21:50] we can go in some of those description
[1:21:53] probably don't have time but he he says
[1:21:55] that the lamb was coming from the
[1:21:56] intercessory he has been there in a
[1:21:59] seating for what for your ignorance
[1:22:03] ignorance of what
[1:22:05] you didn't know you were a son
[1:22:07] you didn't know you were with him in the
[1:22:09] beginning
[1:22:10] you just did those things because your
[1:22:11] flesh lets you do it
[1:22:13] you didn't know who you were you didn't
[1:22:15] have the whole revelation but once the
[1:22:17] revelation is given the ignorance is
[1:22:19] going away
[1:22:20] and it's not in the fearful manner where
[1:22:22] you say well if there's if he's not in
[1:22:25] sinning for ignorance no god doesn't
[1:22:27] lose attributes
[1:22:29] no god takes one and he rolls it into
[1:22:33] another
[1:22:34] all every whatever he was in the
[1:22:36] beginning is what he's going to be at
[1:22:38] the end he's never going to diminish in
[1:22:41] being god he's never going to become a
[1:22:43] small god or whatever now even when he
[1:22:45] took himself and he became a germ it was
[1:22:49] still god
[1:22:55] and he says
[1:22:57] and he came and he took the book out of
[1:22:59] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:23:00] throne
[1:23:02] and now
[1:23:04] he's coming for possession time
[1:23:07] now i like this but when him says there
[1:23:09] came
[1:23:10] he comes
[1:23:11] and he says behold the lamb of god
[1:23:15] but when
[1:23:16] when he comes we also read that he
[1:23:20] changes from a lamb to a lion
[1:23:25] but
[1:23:26] what is that now he says
[1:23:29] further down that a lamb when we say a
[1:23:31] lamb it doesn't mean an animal with
[1:23:34] carnaby says then he couldn't take the
[1:23:36] book
[1:23:37] he says it's only a representation it
[1:23:39] was his nature that was what it was he
[1:23:42] was meek he was a lamb he was there to
[1:23:44] give himself up but when he changes to a
[1:23:46] lion what is alliance signification the
[1:23:49] king
[1:23:50] now he's no longer playing he's not
[1:23:52] there to negotiate he's there to take
[1:23:55] what belongs to him he's there to
[1:23:57] possess what belonged to him and brother
[1:24:00] and sister this is not time to negotiate
[1:24:02] with the devil
[1:24:03] we don't live in the time where you go
[1:24:05] devil can you just give me this and say
[1:24:07] with this everything whatever what your
[1:24:10] children your family your loved one your
[1:24:12] all you have the rights
[1:24:15] you have the right to claim everything
[1:24:18] oh sickness or death you have been
[1:24:20] empowered by this lamb who's turned into
[1:24:23] a lion to possess all that belongs to
[1:24:26] you
[1:24:27] that's the time we live in
[1:24:36] he says
[1:24:42] in the song a new song
[1:24:45] it says and when he had taken the book
[1:24:48] and the four
[1:24:49] beasts and the four uh
[1:24:51] the phobiast and the four and twenty
[1:24:53] elders
[1:24:54] fell down and began to sing
[1:24:56] it fell down before the lamb having
[1:24:59] every one of them harps and golden vows
[1:25:01] full of others which were prayers of the
[1:25:04] saints and they sang a new song saying
[1:25:06] thou are worthy
[1:25:08] to take the book
[1:25:10] and to open the seals thereof
[1:25:13] for thou have slain
[1:25:15] and has redeemed us back
[1:25:17] is redeemed us to god by the blood out
[1:25:19] of every kindred
[1:25:21] out of every tongue and out of every
[1:25:23] nation
[1:25:24] we have been given a new song
[1:25:27] i want to say this
[1:25:30] this is for what i'm saying
[1:25:32] the bible has become a new book
[1:25:37] the same bible
[1:25:39] it become a new book
[1:25:41] why because now the sales were open
[1:25:44] the understanding of what
[1:25:46] what we had ownership over the very
[1:25:50] because remember this is the same thing
[1:25:51] that happens with the children of israel
[1:25:54] when do we in bondage
[1:25:55] the devil's tactic is always to tell you
[1:25:58] a lie and once you believe a lie you
[1:26:00] stuck
[1:26:03] you're stuck you work and you labor
[1:26:04] under a lie you know it says you got
[1:26:07] this from your parents you got this from
[1:26:09] such and such you know you were born you
[1:26:11] you know you're never going to have full
[1:26:13] functionality you had surgery you had
[1:26:16] this and you did that you were stuck you
[1:26:18] only have to accept how many times i
[1:26:20] mean
[1:26:21] everywhere you know oh you know you you
[1:26:23] can't do this that's not what you were
[1:26:25] good at and all of those things and
[1:26:27] everything oh but how many even to the
[1:26:29] unbelievers how many of them have been
[1:26:31] told things that they believe in state
[1:26:34] and the condition on how many have been
[1:26:36] told they refuse to believe and they
[1:26:38] change their lives
[1:26:40] we don't have to believe anything from
[1:26:42] the devil
[1:26:43] in fact why do we even talk to him in
[1:26:45] the first place why do we even listen to
[1:26:47] him in the first place
[1:26:49] because remember he's trying to redeem
[1:26:51] his time he's trying to do all of this
[1:26:53] so he can stay a little longer because
[1:26:55] he knows in the end he's a defeated fall
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:27:03] so i want to say this
[1:27:05] this message
[1:27:07] is giving us the title did back to man
[1:27:11] this message is the only thing that
[1:27:12] restores all that relationship
[1:27:15] this message is what brings you right
[1:27:17] back into the condition that god wanted
[1:27:20] you to be in the minute this this
[1:27:22] message the final product of it is it
[1:27:25] produce what we call the manifestation
[1:27:27] of the third pool
[1:27:31] god
[1:27:33] working in man
[1:27:35] a son of god
[1:27:36] taking full power
[1:27:39] now let me jump around
[1:27:41] i know i'm running out of time like i
[1:27:42] said the goal is not to finish
[1:27:45] we'll we'll the lord willing we'll pick
[1:27:48] it up or we'll
[1:27:49] get back to it somehow i you know it's
[1:27:51] it's amazing because as a preacher you
[1:27:54] you know you see something and and
[1:27:57] the more you closely you look and the
[1:27:58] bigger gaps and so and the bigger it
[1:28:01] gets the scary you get because you're
[1:28:03] like am i ever going to pitch the whole
[1:28:05] bible again
[1:28:06] so you want god to just show you so you
[1:28:08] can stay at least in one lane and just
[1:28:11] bring it otherwise you just come here
[1:28:12] and you preach the whole bible again so
[1:28:15] it gets bigger and bigger and it's
[1:28:17] wonderful because god wants to
[1:28:18] fellowship with us in his word
[1:28:21] it wants you to know him he wants you to
[1:28:24] see
[1:28:25] oh
[1:28:25] our eyes have been opened we can never
[1:28:27] be the same
[1:28:29] a true son or daughter of god you you
[1:28:31] you can say oh i don't want to listen to
[1:28:34] tapes i don't want to do that you can
[1:28:36] you would open this bible you can never
[1:28:38] see it the same again
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:42] absolutely no way because my
[1:28:44] understanding has been changed
[1:28:46] everything has been affected all of that
[1:28:49] i can never return to what i was all i
[1:28:51] need to do is keep
[1:28:54] going now here here he is now he's
[1:28:58] talking in he he moves us now in
[1:29:01] revelation chapter 10. now now
[1:29:04] when we when we open the book of
[1:29:06] revelation chapter 10 if you go to the
[1:29:08] the verse one so you realize the
[1:29:11] description that's been given in
[1:29:13] revelation chapter 10 the uh uh verse
[1:29:17] one it says and i saw another mighty
[1:29:19] angel come down in uh from heaven
[1:29:21] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon
[1:29:24] uh was upon his head and his face was as
[1:29:27] though the sun
[1:29:28] and his and his feet as the pillow fire
[1:29:31] so this is the same description with the
[1:29:33] angel in revelation chapter one and
[1:29:35] verbum says that's christ
[1:29:39] so
[1:29:40] as he comes it's the same description
[1:29:42] but he says but but in the days of the
[1:29:45] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:29:47] begin to sound
[1:29:49] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:29:52] he is declared to his servants to
[1:29:54] prophet so the finishing of the mystery
[1:29:57] but what i'm saying is starting at the
[1:29:59] sounding of this seventh century
[1:30:01] messenger now listen to what it says now
[1:30:03] in the breach paragraph 39 it says now
[1:30:07] but it's the book it's a mysterious book
[1:30:09] it's the book of redemption it says
[1:30:11] we'll get into that in a little while it
[1:30:13] says now we know that that is we know
[1:30:16] that this book of redemption will not be
[1:30:19] thoroughly understand it's probed at
[1:30:22] through six ages
[1:30:25] but in the end when the seventh angel
[1:30:27] began to sound dismiss his mystery
[1:30:32] he says
[1:30:33] he he winds up all the loose hands
[1:30:36] of these fellow
[1:30:38] fellows probe that and the mysteries
[1:30:40] come down from heaven
[1:30:43] come down
[1:30:45] sorry come down from god as the word of
[1:30:48] god and revealed the entire revelation
[1:30:51] of god
[1:30:52] it says then
[1:30:54] then god it says
[1:30:56] then the godhead and everything else is
[1:30:58] settled it says all the mysteries
[1:31:00] serpent seed whatever more uh is to be
[1:31:03] revealed it says now see it's just it's
[1:31:07] it says i'm just not making this up it
[1:31:09] says that's what it's that says the lord
[1:31:12] i'll read it to you out of the book it
[1:31:15] says the sounding of the seventh angel
[1:31:17] messenger message it says the mystery of
[1:31:20] god should be finished that is declared
[1:31:23] to his holy prophet that's he says
[1:31:26] that's the prophet who was who has uh
[1:31:29] wrote the word
[1:31:30] and
[1:31:31] wrote the word at the sounding of the
[1:31:33] seventh church age the last church age
[1:31:37] all the loose hands that
[1:31:40] through these church ages have been
[1:31:42] probed that will be
[1:31:45] wandered up together and when
[1:31:48] and when the seals are broken the
[1:31:50] mysteries are revealed down come the
[1:31:52] angel it says down come the angel
[1:31:55] messenger so now remember he's giving
[1:31:57] you a description when he broke the
[1:31:58] seals he comes down
[1:32:01] and i want to remind you now
[1:32:04] as he says
[1:32:06] in revelation chapter 5 the book is
[1:32:08] still close
[1:32:10] but when it's coming down to revelation
[1:32:12] chapter 10 it's coming down with an open
[1:32:14] book
[1:32:15] now he says when he breaks it down the
[1:32:17] the god down come the messenger christ
[1:32:20] he says setting his foot upon the land
[1:32:22] and upon the sea with a rainbow upon his
[1:32:24] head now he says now remember this
[1:32:26] seventh angel is on the earth at this
[1:32:29] time of this coming
[1:32:35] now
[1:32:37] you you can't disassociate the two
[1:32:41] you you
[1:32:42] and and i want to say this because
[1:32:44] sometimes people associate the coming of
[1:32:47] the lord
[1:32:48] directly with well they're coming
[1:32:51] where's the rapture
[1:32:52] but you have to understand it's a season
[1:32:55] because in thessalonians it speaks about
[1:32:57] that the law themselves shall come first
[1:33:00] because if the law doesn't come there's
[1:33:02] no rapture
[1:33:04] if the revealing how do you know who you
[1:33:07] are and how do you identify how are you
[1:33:10] getting your heart changed how you get
[1:33:12] your heart turned back how do you get
[1:33:14] into the condition for the rapture
[1:33:17] the seals have to be open and there's
[1:33:19] only one who can open it and it's christ
[1:33:20] and it's when he comes down he reveals
[1:33:23] himself when you get to know who he is
[1:33:25] then he takes you up to the meeting in
[1:33:27] the air but that doesn't happen until
[1:33:30] christ comes down first
[1:33:34] we get twisted because people have uh
[1:33:37] projected it in a manner where it's so
[1:33:39] confusing people say the coming of the
[1:33:41] lord oh i want to see him then why are
[1:33:43] we still here no it's the understanding
[1:33:46] that this has to take first first before
[1:33:48] the other takes place but it's in the
[1:33:50] same spectrum of god performing what he
[1:33:53] promised he would do
[1:33:56] so when this heavenly messenger who's
[1:33:59] christ when he's coming down but what
[1:34:02] i'm saying right the earthly messenger
[1:34:04] has to be there because what is he gonna
[1:34:06] go say to the bride what is he gonna go
[1:34:08] preach to the people he has to get it
[1:34:10] from this heavenly messenger who's
[1:34:13] coming down for him to take it and go go
[1:34:15] give it to the bride
[1:34:20] it says
[1:34:24] and we we
[1:34:27] it says now see
[1:34:34] now we see
[1:34:37] that this seven seal book now
[1:34:40] is a mystery of redemption
[1:34:43] it's a book of redemption from god
[1:34:46] now all the mystery all the mysteries
[1:34:50] that this book that this
[1:34:52] that this time
[1:34:53] should be finished at the sounding of
[1:34:56] this messenger
[1:34:57] now he's the angel of the lord
[1:35:00] and another angel a mighty angel comes
[1:35:02] down see the angel was
[1:35:05] was an earthly messenger
[1:35:09] it was an earthly angel messenger but he
[1:35:13] comes but but here comes one from heaven
[1:35:17] a rainbow covenant
[1:35:20] so one is an earthly
[1:35:22] was it one is in heavenly
[1:35:27] now
[1:35:31] he says this
[1:35:33] in paragraph 47 he says
[1:35:36] and here he returns back
[1:35:40] in revelation chapter 10 after the
[1:35:42] coming time
[1:35:44] after the coming time
[1:35:47] and all the mysteries is finished is to
[1:35:49] be finished
[1:35:51] and the seals are to be broken and
[1:35:53] proclaiming that this is the time that
[1:35:55] that time shall be no more
[1:35:58] and he said when the seventh angel has
[1:36:01] begun to sound
[1:36:04] then the mystery should be finished
[1:36:08] and the time for the
[1:36:10] angels to appear
[1:36:12] we are close
[1:36:15] we say somewhere that's right
[1:36:18] now
[1:36:20] i know i'm going to run out of time
[1:36:23] i i
[1:36:24] perhaps just want to
[1:36:26] expand on this for a little bit and then
[1:36:28] we'll see where we can close
[1:36:30] now
[1:36:31] here he is it says when this angel comes
[1:36:33] it says
[1:36:34] when he
[1:36:35] it takes the book and he comes and he
[1:36:37] comes down and he says
[1:36:39] he says time shall be no more
[1:36:43] now he's here now declaring
[1:36:47] that
[1:36:48] because remember time was made for god
[1:36:50] to come and deal with sin and the devil
[1:36:54] he came and he created time for him to
[1:36:56] come and deal with that but he says time
[1:36:59] shall be no more in other words i'm not
[1:37:01] allowing this to continue on
[1:37:06] time shall be no more what time because
[1:37:08] remember the the very scripture tells us
[1:37:11] it says if had the lord not shorten the
[1:37:13] time then there will be no flesh saved
[1:37:16] but when it comes it says time shall be
[1:37:18] no more it's the understanding that he's
[1:37:21] now moving
[1:37:23] into whatever he wanted to fulfill for
[1:37:25] the he's now moving into the claiming
[1:37:29] work he's now moving into the place
[1:37:31] where he's now to claim that which he
[1:37:34] gave because remember he swore by no
[1:37:37] great about it that himself so in other
[1:37:39] words god is saying that i had paid the
[1:37:41] price i had given my life now i'm here
[1:37:45] to declare that it's time for me to take
[1:37:47] what belongs to me
[1:37:49] it's time for me to take man and return
[1:37:52] him to the position that i wanted him to
[1:37:54] be now he's not saying well when i say
[1:37:57] this then you shall do this you shall do
[1:37:59] this no he's swearing by no greater than
[1:38:01] himself
[1:38:02] he's saying by himself he's saying time
[1:38:04] shall be no more in other words he's now
[1:38:07] saying that this is the time for this to
[1:38:09] happen
[1:38:12] so we we can't have the word of god and
[1:38:15] sit in one and say well i wonder when is
[1:38:18] he going to do it no he's doing it now
[1:38:21] he did it he's doing it right now in our
[1:38:23] generation in our time he's here to
[1:38:26] bring you right back into what you were
[1:38:28] in the beginning that's why i said when
[1:38:30] i jumped forward i said it's important
[1:38:32] we realize that when he does this he
[1:38:34] comes and the references that he has for
[1:38:37] you is no longer you as a human he has a
[1:38:40] reference for you from what he was in
[1:38:42] the eternity
[1:38:45] everything he was
[1:38:47] i was with you in the beginning
[1:38:49] you were part of me he talks about the
[1:38:51] matter eagle who lost an egg he comes
[1:38:53] all the stories and all the references
[1:38:56] is about him taking you back
[1:38:59] taking you back taking you back bringing
[1:39:01] you back talking about amnesia talking
[1:39:04] about all of those things so you can
[1:39:05] come to a place where you could realize
[1:39:08] now he wants to bring me back
[1:39:11] so god is no longer needing to deal with
[1:39:14] us as creatures of time
[1:39:16] he wants to start referring to us as
[1:39:18] creatures of eternity he wants us to be
[1:39:21] reminded that we were with him in the
[1:39:23] beginning
[1:39:24] he wants us to know that
[1:39:26] what we are
[1:39:28] is not a sinful person who's born out of
[1:39:30] a parent and we just came into the world
[1:39:33] now remember this this is the first time
[1:39:36] that man is actually understanding
[1:39:39] where they come from
[1:39:41] how did they get here where they're
[1:39:43] going and their purpose here
[1:39:47] because remember if a man doesn't answer
[1:39:49] but what random says it says you have to
[1:39:51] answer that question you have to
[1:39:54] understand why am i here
[1:39:57] we we hear
[1:39:58] people people lose their mind they say
[1:40:01] it's because they don't understand they
[1:40:02] don't have a purpose in their lives
[1:40:05] they just woke up and they go they go up
[1:40:07] and down and all of that but it's when
[1:40:09] you have a purpose and you understand
[1:40:11] your purpose that's what gives your life
[1:40:13] a meaning and i'll say this this message
[1:40:16] gave our lives a meaning
[1:40:19] we were here just wondering and
[1:40:21] groveling in sin and darkness and
[1:40:24] all kinds of things happening and for
[1:40:26] the first time we even understand
[1:40:30] why we were sinners
[1:40:32] we understand why how come we fall to
[1:40:35] where we were we understand why we were
[1:40:38] in the condition that we were not just
[1:40:40] what we were we now have a purpose and
[1:40:43] understanding of where we're going
[1:40:57] if the musician could come
[1:41:12] i want to say this
[1:41:16] we have to
[1:41:18] take this word of god
[1:41:23] it's god purposing within himself
[1:41:27] to reveal himself to you
[1:41:30] it's god purposing within himself
[1:41:35] that we are going to be returning to the
[1:41:38] original state
[1:41:39] and this message
[1:41:42] is not like what pentecostal preaches
[1:41:45] it's not what makes it different is that
[1:41:47] we live in the restoration time
[1:41:50] and god himself has made himself real to
[1:41:53] you his medic and i want to say this
[1:41:56] let's not just take it as a text or as
[1:41:58] something that the prophet messenger
[1:42:00] said
[1:42:01] it's with every word of god you have to
[1:42:04] prove it to be true for yourself
[1:42:07] for what good is the word if we could
[1:42:09] just come and hear it on tapes and hear
[1:42:11] it in the church and hear it and rejoice
[1:42:13] and say i live in that time no if i live
[1:42:16] in that time i want the manifestation of
[1:42:18] it in my life
[1:42:20] i want to see i want a taste of it
[1:42:23] myself i want the reality of god that
[1:42:26] god to become my reality
[1:42:28] we're not called here to just believe oh
[1:42:30] the messenger says this we are called to
[1:42:32] have faith in the word but faith in the
[1:42:35] word is to produce what the word said it
[1:42:37] will produce
[1:42:38] we we are being given this remember john
[1:42:41] was asked to eat the book and i know you
[1:42:43] hear that many times oftentimes we are
[1:42:46] in the condition that we are in because
[1:42:48] we're not eating right
[1:42:50] we're not eating enough
[1:42:52] we're not feeding on it you that because
[1:42:55] remember the more you eat of something
[1:42:56] the more you become it the only way we
[1:42:59] get to become this is by eating of it by
[1:43:03] feasting on it drinking it that morning
[1:43:06] midday and night and every day and ask
[1:43:09] that god to take his word and come to
[1:43:10] pat and bring it to come to pass
[1:43:13] and i want to say this the spirit and
[1:43:14] the word are one perhaps we'll speak on
[1:43:17] this when you receive the word the
[1:43:19] spirit within the word will bring the
[1:43:21] world to come to pass oftentimes we have
[1:43:24] this mentality well i'll receive the
[1:43:26] word and i'll wait for the spirit to
[1:43:27] reign from heaven somewhere no what the
[1:43:30] the words of someone has his spirits
[1:43:33] attached to it the words of jesus christ
[1:43:36] is a spirit coming into manifestation
[1:43:38] once you receive his word you have
[1:43:40] received his spirit
[1:43:47] he never asked for any other
[1:43:49] manifestation
[1:43:50] or any other evidence except the
[1:43:52] believing of the word you believe the
[1:43:54] word he'll come to us
[1:43:56] why because it's god
[1:43:58] it's the word of god the same word that
[1:44:00] created heaven and earth the same word
[1:44:02] that says letter be the same word he
[1:44:04] says that word is never going and come
[1:44:06] back and return void every time it's
[1:44:09] spoken it brings forth that which it was
[1:44:11] spoken for
[1:44:14] and that's what we're dealing with here
[1:44:16] i said god let it produce what it was
[1:44:18] spoken for i will eat it i'll believe it
[1:44:22] i'll stay with it until the very
[1:44:24] manifestation of it i see
[1:44:26] you don't see it continue to eat
[1:44:29] you you'd struggle continue to eat this
[1:44:32] word will stick will take the struggle
[1:44:35] away
[1:44:36] why because it's the king's sword
[1:44:39] it's not a man's sword it's not a man's
[1:44:42] understanding this is the king's weapon
[1:44:46] this is to annihilate for once and for
[1:44:48] all this is to end the battle this is to
[1:44:51] say
[1:44:52] uh now it is done
[1:44:55] this is to say i have been returned into
[1:44:58] the original position and devil get
[1:45:01] there behind me you have no power over
[1:45:04] me now he comes remember he will come
[1:45:07] until the time he is because remember
[1:45:09] this flesh was born of sin and it was
[1:45:11] shaping iniquity and everything as long
[1:45:13] as we're still here we'll be tempted but
[1:45:15] god has come this generation to make you
[1:45:18] know to make you realize that you are
[1:45:21] here as god
[1:45:23] within the body of flesh doing the same
[1:45:26] works that he did when he was in the
[1:45:28] body of jesus let's all stand
[1:45:32] [Applause]
[1:45:45] he swore by no greater than himself
[1:45:48] that he will bring this to pass
[1:45:51] oh my if we could just reduce in what he
[1:45:53] says
[1:45:55] just to know that if he said it is going
[1:45:56] to come to pass there's no way and
[1:45:59] that's the song
[1:46:00] thou are worthy
[1:46:02] thou art worthy o god
[1:46:05] to
[1:46:06] do all of these things all we do every
