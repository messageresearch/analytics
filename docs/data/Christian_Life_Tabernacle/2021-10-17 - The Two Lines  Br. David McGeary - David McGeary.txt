amen amen certainly welcome everyone in the house of god this morning amen happy and glad to be gathered here in his presence as revived by mike for psalm reading this morning god bless you we're going to read psalm 77 this morning you know this is one of a group of psalms that was not actually written by david this is written by asaph at a time that david was king asaph and a handful of other ministers levites they were responsible for leading worship in the place of the tabernacle when it was really just a ten and it says in first chronicles 6 31 it says in these are they whom david set over the service of song in the house of the lord after that the ark had rest and they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing until solomon had built the house of the lord in jerusalem and then they waited on their office according to their order you know as i was just reading that three different things kind of stuck out to me there first of all this group was a chosen group it was a very specific group of people in fact if you read that chapter it names them by name it can't be more than a few but it was a specific group of people that was called to do a specific work the second thing that stuck out to me is it was in a specific place it says there in first chronicles 6 that they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle this was before the house was even built even before the building was made manifest on earth they had a ministry of worship in the dwelling place that temporary dwelling place of that tabernacle and then was for a specific point of time it says in first chronicles 6 that it was they were chosen to minister from the time that the ark had rest until the time that solomon built the temple and then they moved on to a different ministry so there was a small space of time when there was a temporary dwelling place that a chosen handful of people conducted a very specific ministry for a very specific space of time you know and i thought about that and you know it uh certainly sounded familiar to me you know i think we can all say that there is a chosen hand full of people that have been called for a space of time during the hour of the temporary dwelling place to perform a specific ministry for a specific space of time so it's a little hard not to read that and say mama that's me you know psalm 77 is one of the songs that comes forth from this people and you know as we read this we maybe get a little bit of a glimpse into what kind of ministry this people may have performed it says in verse 1 i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me now notice this ministry this song has to do with their voice and there was a voice that went forth that says that caused god to hear so there was an effect of the voice that this group of people in their ministry sent out and it caused the lord to hear you know sometimes i think we get trapped a little bit in our own religious teachings and vocabulary you know when someone says the word minister or ministry it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with a man in a suit and tie behind a pulpit and when somebody says the word worship it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the song service where the spirit is moving and when someone speaks of crying with my voice it doesn't necessarily mean that we're screaming aloud in prayer in fact brother branham said what that our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our words right so what is that but that there's a voice that comes out of this people so what is that voice what does that voice say it says in once again verse 1. this is an hour of desperation if you read the psalm it says i cried unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me so what is it that caused him to listen in verse 10 and i said this is my infirmity this is my trial this is my burden this is my need but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings so in his hour of trouble it says he cried unto his voice and the message that he said is i will remember your works and your wonders and who you are and what you do you know this cry was not a cry for something new some new work to be performed something but instead it was to look back at who he was and what he does at what he said the things that the way that he works his wonders and to speak them forth the song of this ministry of this people you know the rest of psalm 77 starting in verse 13 is all about that song in the time of trouble in the hour when they had a need and an hour when they had a burden the voice of this people in this specific hour in the time of the temporary dwelling place was to speak forth his wonders his word his works how he opened it says here that you know it says that you redeemed a people we're gonna read about that waters parted to make a path water from the sky when it was dry shaking the very foundation of the earth when a mountain needed moving right this is who he is this is what he does and the ministry of this people is to speak that forth no matter what their need is no matter what situation they're in there's only one ministry that this people has and that's to declare the name of the lord just as that chosen group of people was back there so you know as i thought about that scriptures began to come to my mind about you are written epistles read of all men right you know that you are kings and priests before him there's a ministry that this chosen people is to perform in the hour they've been given and that's to proclaim the works and the wonders and the word of the lord not to look for some new work not to speak something new but to be his ministry in that time to speak forth who he is and so as i thought about that again i looked at that scripture and thought mama that's me so as we read this morning i i hope that you know you put yourself in the scripture and remember we're in a temporary dwelling place for just a certain space of time and there's a very specific ministry that we've been called to do there's a voice there's a message that we're called to deliver let's read that together starting in verse one i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed sila thou holdest mine eye is waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with my own heart and my spirit made diligent search will the lord cast off forever and will he be favorable no more is his mercy clean gone forever doth his promise fail forevermore hath god forgotten to be gracious happy in anger shut up his tender mercies sila and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god is our god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known thou lettest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron amen amen praise the lord i have your seats this morning man let's sing the original live this morning amen all god's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last who we are

as the great physician though we ask that you'd be with her lord that you'd give her strength and lord that you'd be the one that makes the difference lord because we know that you're the healer lord we think of the great testimony that our brother shared about your mercy lord how you preserved him lord you did it for a reason not just to show how good you are and kind and merciful lord but to stand as a testimony that each and every one of us would more fervently serve you lord lord we're so grateful that we have such a loving kind heavenly father lord we think of our precious brother

undone with the god o his son when he reached down his hand just for me i was nearing in despair [Music] that i could be free then he lifted my feet and gave me glory complete i'm glad he reached down

choice from [Music] [Music] just for me when he reached down his hand over me [Music] i [Music] when he reached down [Music] i was lost and undone with [Music] me [Music] amen aren't you glad it

doubt that your chosen place to meet man is under the shed blood father such a powerful fountain that can wash us from every stain deliver us from every shortcoming set us free from every oppressor oh lord you are so good to your children we love you and we just ask you to bless us this morning as we fellowship around your wonderful word and we lift praises to you father in thanksgiving lord we just ask that you would give us more eyes father that we can comprehend the greatness that you have revealed to us father answer each of our prayers and we ask these things in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning let's turn in our bibles over to numbers and we'll just ask the lord to bless us and and they mentioned sister ellen santiago in prayer we were able to go to a doctor and they feel that her eyesight may be taken care of with some cataract surgery so they're going to go in there and look at that this week and we just trust that it's the lord you know so if anybody needs a truck just get with brother joel he will definitely be able to take care of that for you i remember one time richard lenny greenlee were planning to move and they were living in chicago and and they were fixing up the house and everything and so sister lenny said you know what the only way we're ever going to sell this house is somebody comes up and knocks on the door and says you want to sell your house a day later someone walked up and knocked on the door said you want to sell your house so let's not forget that's the kind of god we serve amen that's what we want to remember amen we have a god that only manifests himself in the supernatural so if we can just keep that growing in us that's what we want to grow let's read here in numbers um the 22nd chapter and the 31st verse it says the lord then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face amen father we ask you to bless this word in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning this this morning we want to have some fellowship this morning uh continuing out of the message does god ever change his mind about his word and today we'd like to title this sermon the two lines the two lines and uh this is a uh a great lesson here uh in in this uh uh message uh of uh is your life worthy of the gospel and uh no not your life or does god ever change his mind about his word and so um this uh statement is real important i think as brother branham brings this out in the beginning now this is sunday school this morning okay so it i know most of you have just come back from a evangelistic uh uh you know deliverance type meeting where they preach the delivering power of the lord and and we see god's mighty hand moving and healing and those are our great things but also the scripture tells us to that we should have sound doctrine and that we should be steadfast in the in in the word of god and study to show ourselves approved so it takes a balance of it all to keep us going um and you know so we just trust the lord will bless you but brother brahm says in this message in the seventh the paragraph paragraph 70 he says in israel of the old testament is the type of the bride of the new testament coming out of the world marching on the road to canaan or canaan that we go to the millennium and so he says now this is a type or if we could use another word this is a preview so you can look at at look at israel's journey and from looking at that begin to come to an understanding of what's going to happen or what's going to face you in your journey so the things that you are going to come in contact with these are the things that are along the way uh these are the spirits that will be there these are the uh enemies that you will face uh these are the situations that will be there because he brought them through those situations so the bride can look and say oh i see that i see that i see that i see that and that we could apply the isab that we need to apply in our day because you know in in in the book of revelations that we were counseled were counseled up for three things to buy gold uh to buy gold trident fire to put on white ramen and to have isab and so we don't want to pass up the very instructions of the lord for our day so as we sit there and we we sit back and we say okay what are the three things that i need and those three things were told to us when the in in our generation he said i counsel thee and we know what gold trident fire is right it's character we know what putting on the white garments is to hide our nakedness but but to have eyes have that thou mayest see and that that's what we were talking about this morning we're talking about going to the word of god and applying the eye salve out of the word of god to our eyes and so that's part of what this message is that our messenger brought us he brought us all three of those okay in the message all three of those great requests that we were counseled to have of the lord those are brought to us now what we're talking about this morning is taking the isaf how many really understand that the messenger gave us i sat amen things we would have never seen or never recognized or never understood if the the word of god the message of god that i sav wasn't applied to us that we can see so we're counseled to do that so we we sit back and we see okay they're on this journey what things did they come in contact with what things that were they uh challenged with and and understand with isab that we should expect to uh be challenged uh by the very same things uh you know so uh that is uh that is one of the great things that we we realize and so there's another great thing that we see on this journey uh that we're taking that there's two lines on this journey okay and you say well what do you mean by a line a line of thought a a certain line of approach and so in this journey we're going to cross two lines of approach two complete uh different approaches two different means of and methods there are two different lines all together but yet we also know that they're so close they would deceive the very elect if possible what a paradox what a what a challenge and and so this challenge of these two lines is brought out in this message the the challenge that we have to face the the challenge of knowing that they're they're going to be close and there's it's not gonna be so obvious you know we've got the devil with little horns you know what i mean and a big tail and a pitchfork and oh you're wow you know you're gonna miss that guy no how many knows what the scripture says that a that satan appears as an angel of light now that's why this is the most deceiving age is ever because both both lines are represented by an angel okay this journey is in as easy as we would like to make it you know it's not as clear you know the the contrast is there but the contrast is only given to those who have eyes have to see otherwise it appears to be the same and and so as we're reading this message now we're there's a another teaching within the framework of this message that we've touched on and that's the permissive will and the perfect will of god we don't want to go into that this morning in depth at all but that is there as you study the message or if you choose to study it along with us but so we see that in this in this journey that we're we're taking if we would read in paragraph uh uh 86 and we read here and we're talking about uh the the journey now just for a moment of israel and what happened it says and so we know that uh korah and dathan withstood moses and then we read down here a little bit we'll just pick up in the middle of a paragraph 85 and he said ancora being being carnal wanted to raise up an organization among them he wanted to make a group of man and god doesn't deal with people like that so he doesn't deal with groups so even in our midst it's important as christian life tabernacle we don't form ourselves as a group our church our this together we're going quote unquote we're right the way we do things is the way it should be done even though we're here fellowshipping we're fellowshipping in the universal body of the lord jesus we're not fellowshipping and have any authority as a quote-unquote local group okay now now we are a body we are fitted and joined together every member supplies the need to the other but it's not based on location it's not it's not based under whose ministry that you set under you still have that individual part so god is going not going to ever deal with us as a complete group in other words where one word applies to us all the same way the word applies to us the same but even in this sermon this morning god will deal with each of your hearts separately so it's never if we could say this i heard an advertisement the other day no such thing as one sock fits all you know you got to have a sock nowaday that's according to your foot size you know you can't buy 11 to 12 or you know 7 to 10 or something like that i don't know what i'm going to do so uh but but you you understand the the the idea of trying to put everybody in one mindset give everybody the same revelation have everybody use the same terminology god will never do that okay and the ministry the carnal ministry will try to labor to get everybody to think the same way but no that's what you want you should be able to walk out of this sermon we should be able to get 200 different explanations of what was preached many times i've talked to people and they said i really like what you said here and preached here and the whole so i said i didn't preach that did i preach that you know and i think well he missed the whole thing you know but the truth of the matter is god dealt with him in that way so understand that understand that could don't so you are not relying on what's going on with other people you know you you're not comparing notes to come up with some conclusion that we all make together as a group of people so you and so therefore if we take that a bit farther you may have revelations in the word of god that i don't it's a love affair between you and him he whispers his secrets in your ear and we would not everybody does things the way that i do so we don't have the right way the wrong way in my way we have his way and that's between you and him personally as we just study this so he he and he's saying here he says god doesn't deal with people like that it shows right there in the scriptures a type of the journey today it shows right there in scriptures a type of the journey today that organizing is not what god ordains now that's important because this is one of the things that we'll meet on our journey is the desire of men to organize to create groups to create ministerial fellowships to create certain ways of worship certain types of identity certain certain descriptions of what the move of the spirit is what the move of the spirit isn't uh and and there's none of those things can be applied in a group setting everything everything is personal so as we just read is the scripture the type of the journey organizes not ordained of god for as soon as korah done it he said to moses you take too much upon yourself in other words the whole congregation is holy now we've got to be careful because we say we are the bride we are the elect we we us us okay and and that's fine i i believe you're all saved i believe you're all filled with the holy ghost i believe you all have pure intentions and it's fine to say we we but you can't take that and say because i'm a part of this group that we're going now remember these are thinkings and lines of approach that are presented to the bride on their journey so these are the things that they're coming in contact with they're coming in conflict with another because someone wanting to put their arm around you and say worry it or we've got the right spirit here we've got the right system here okay the way our church does it if god is with us well you know if god's with us come here clever if god's with us and i leave he's in trouble because i'm going to take god with me before i i leave him with you but do you understand you can't get into this idea of us now if he's got god and i've got god and he's got the word and i've got the word then we have a unity together and we bless one another but he has got to have as we heard wednesday night a personal experience with the lord i do believe god's with us because wherever two or more are gathered in his name there he'll be but it doesn't take both of us it's when two of us come together that's the difference so you've got to understand so why this spirit is so bad is because it allows you to move away from your responsibility of a personal relationship i don't my this just keeps opening up he said and so he says in other words the whole congregation's holy why you say you're the only holy man you have no right to do any such as that you try to make yourself some big some uh yourself some big somebody big we're all holy we're all god's children and moses just turned his head and walked away he said lord what will i do and god said separate yourselves from him i've had enough of it and he swallowed him up in the earth see there was a clash now i want to talk about this just for a second there was a class when the carnal and the spiritual meets there's always a clash now we have to understand that because as christians you understand we that clash makes us feel unchristian you know what i mean we don't like that the spirit of uh a contention we don't like that you know what i mean so it's uncomfortable feeling when there's a clash between the carnal and the spiritual now if one of these spirits would come up against you somehow in some way there's people that form doctrines and they form groups and they have they have a certain teaching and they suck you into belonging to that many times people come under the influence of a certain pastor and he controls their lives did you buy a car without asking me did you go to the store without asking me you know i don't approve of those shoes i don't like that dress you know let me look at your wallet i don't like the way you folded your money up what you got too much money in your wallet you should have put some of that in the offering you know what i mean and and so oh don't don't it's that bad it's that bad you you you understand it can so uh they they they push that out there and so people become uncomfortable with the clash they don't want to say up get behind me satan oh you can't say that to the preacher if the preacher satan you tell him to get behind you rev don't mean nothing you know what i mean you're subject to one thing and one thing alone and that's god's word what settles it and but sometimes the clash makes us shrink away the clash we don't want to stand up we don't want to speak out we don't want to even do what he says in the thing he said they put their finger in their face and said you're not saying what the apostles are saying they don't want that so their life comes to a place where they're always sidestepping they're always avoiding and and sometimes you've just got to realize you've got to put your your your feet down and stand on what you believe because if you won't stand for something that you believe you won't stand for anything and then you really don't have a testimony so basically nobody can put a finger on your life they don't know what you believe or what you stand for because we run from the clash and we've got to understand the clash is going to be there it doesn't matter you've got to have that individual understanding in your heart that it doesn't de-christianize you because you have a spiritual clash and it's good people that have wrong ideas and it doesn't mean they'll remain in those ideas all their life but it's important that you feel in your life the the uh confidence in your revelation that when a clash comes that you're able to hold and stand your ground and that is the right spirit because if you have the wrong doctrine and you have the right spirit god will take care of any heirs that you have or bring you to an understanding but if you're always constantly backing away running down uh could not stay standing for what you believe nothing will ever happen to you and so what is we just look he says he said the clash is there jesus meant jesus there was a clash one the son of god the other one the son of satan just like cain and abel there was a clash when they met one of them was one of them was the treasure of the church the other one a pastor and as now we come into this day the same thing again so we're not walking over this this is a type so if you're on the journey this is this is what's going to happen so you we might as well just put our boots on and understand this is the truth the carnal denomination to the spiritual bride of christ the spiritual bride of christ is so much different from the carnal denomination till there's no comparison of them at all so we we recognize this great uh a clash and uh and uh so we we watch this clash where it comes from so if we could turn over to paragraph 100 and um and we'll read this paragraph because what the reason that the clash exists okay i hope that you can bear with me this morning the reason the clash exists because they're both on two different directions they encounter one another okay but they're going in two different directions okay so when when that spirit whatever it is i'm not going to try to go through a list of them because each of us have our own different clashes but there's always a draw satan has even invited jesus to his kingdom satan offered his line his approach how he thought the world should be in other words jesus we will accomplish a better kingdom through science through education through system through organization now if you will just join my approach and my line okay we can accomplish this together now satan was no slouch he was right up there can you imagine someone that was so gifted with majesty that he could deceive two-thirds of the angels you understand so he the conversation he had with jesus was extremely eloquent and extremely persuasive so if if you're not going to take the clash you're going to take the persuasion you know it's like like you know sitting in a a a i'll use a carnal example because many of our young people are involved in sports you know you get a team and everybody's sitting there and they're all rooting for that team and there's they're jumping up when there's a first down and everything and you're the only guy sitting there because you're not rooting for that team you know what i mean and if you're not pretty soon you know what i mean you're down at the concession stand changing jerseys because you want to shout and you want to be the winner you know what i mean but if your team comes back we can do run changer jersey again you know you stick it out and so the clash is because there's a sense about you that this is not the direction i'm wanting to go okay i don't i'm not comfortable with this you know what i mean i'm not going to move till i i the lord deals with my heart so that's the individual part that takes you out of the group move and and so you can't be afraid of the clash because in the long run there's no comparison now look at this quote as we read it together that's the way the church started that's the way it started at nicaea rome when the roman catholic church at the very beginning where it come from was pentecost but when they organized and brought in celebrities into the church they started to make having prayers and running beads and praying for the dead and all these other things now see that line now that line has changed from the catholic church but it's still been coming down right it's it ended up in luther it ended up in wesley it ended up in pentecost and where's the last place it's going to try to end up right here get us to enter in to that same pattern it says running beads and others and and then it just started rolling from one air to another one air to another until look where it's gone to there is not one representation of pentecost in it at all see one air picking up another picking up another there is only one thing to do and that's clean off the record and go back to the beginning [Music] a lot of people never cleared off the slate they liked brother branham they liked the ministry they liked the signs and wonders but they were also holding to things that they thought were true and it wasn't that they weren't true but they weren't placed in the right place and we could go into the five musts and and those things but you you've been in this word uh uh for a long time so uh and so we we find out now so we see these two paths so here's israel coming up a type of the bride being led by a what prophet pillar of fire will read the statement now they come in contact with the moabites here they come and and we'll just take a look at this except he said so they're coming along their journey and and we read here about martin luther and wesley and and going on how they all organized and god moved out of it and now we're looking at it says here in 102. now lots group here or moabite was lot's daughter's child illegitimate to start with now notice as the natural church moabite represents natural denomination natural denomination why that word because it's man's natural tendency to find birds of a feather flock together nobody wants to stand out nobody wants to be the only one right so it's a natural tendency we've got to be careful that we don't fall into the natural tendency of trying to create our own church personality you you understand the only the parts of the message that i preach on i can't preach the whole message there's parts in there that are for you that you've got to listen to that you've got to take into your heart you've got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it it's not let's form these are the main subjects matters that we have we'll talk about election or we'll talk about uh uh our power over the devil and all those things are great things they're very exciting things but there's a lot of other things that's going on and one of the other things that's going on is satan appears as an angel of light now that might not be the most jump up and down sermon but i'm telling you it's true so i'm not saying getting rid of the jump and up and down that's great i don't want to hinder anybody except you can only run in one line because there's no room on the side and there's no room in front so you can run from the back door to the front door and all that you want you can jump out of your chair all you want you can raise all your hands all you want that's fine that doesn't bother me it doesn't mean a thing but when you meet this natural spirit you've got to be able to recognize the two spirits in the framework of the church and so we're talking about those two spirits not as being out there look as being in here he's already god out there you understand he's not he doesn't have to conquer that he's here trying to conquer our minds trying to conquer our independence your personal independence he's offering you group solutions it's like little clicks at school some of you are still in school you know how certain girls get together you know what i mean and and it could you know i don't know if it's by hairstyle or by dress size or but you know what interest grades you know i mean i always tried to hang around the smart people i was dumber in a rock but at least that is smart enough to hang out with the nerds because i knew all those other dumb rocks of friends were never going to get anywhere i wanted to know the people that would get somewhere in life so i i don't know the reasons that people that they hang together but it's their natural tendency to uh to uh hang together and and so represents the natural denomination israel represents the spiritual church israel there was a church true was that the bride of that day called out of egypt vindicated to be the truth vindicated to be the truth you are called out to be the truth you understand no deception in you no deceit in you no false word in you when they see you they see the what the truth jesus said i am the way the truth no man cometh unto the father but by me so the only way you could come to him is by the truth therefore you're vindicated to be the truth so what you're standing for can what you're representing is not a different line you're only representing one line that's his line and his line is the word amen so let's don't keep putting this off so we all say the denomination is already there no that spirit is trying to denominate this bride it's a seduction spirit that's what it said they said the angel tried to seduce me that's what satan did he seduced eve by getting her to believe that his lie was god's truth i'll tell you where the truth is the truth is in the message that god's prophet delivered don't take it on any other basis you have the ability to read it yourself and if i say brother branham said go find it [Music] i'm trying to save you the trouble by putting it up there read it yourself notice when they the two of them come together both of them offered the same sacrifice both built saw seven altars both offered up clean sacrificed oxen and they even offered up rams testifying that there was a coming messiah so they believed in what they all believed in jesus that's that's the key hold to denominations we're all the same we all believe in jesus how many knows with this spirit that they offered the same oxen they did this they did all that what did it lead to it led to the marriage of israel men and moabite women and vice versa it what did it do it polluted the pure bloodline of israel and god never forgave them for it in fact we know they didn't make it and and so he said he said they even offered up rams testifying the coming messiah fundamentally they were both exactly the same fundamentally they were both exactly the same they're saying the same thing they believe the same thing and so can we find out what goes on so we he says fundamentally they're exactly the same israel down in the valley moab up on the hill i i think that's just a beautiful reference isn't it to this six or seven hills or six hills in roman and uh and moab with seven altars israel with seven aldos moab with seven oxen israel with seven auctions moaz with seven rams speaking of the coming messiah israel with seven wrens what was the difference in them okay you've got these two lines that are just really identical so close it will receive the very elective possible and he says he says so what's the difference in them fundamentally both right but you see moab didn't have the vindication of god with them they were only a nation a group of celebrities but israel had a prophet with them now i'm going to say something here and i hope i don't offend too many people because you know me for a long time it's not in my spirit ever to offend anybody or call anybody out or to point out any wrong i'm the kindest gentlest person you've ever met he said but but they had a prophet with them they had a smitten rock with them they had a pillar of fire they had a brass serpent for healing they had the blessings of god moving right along with them and there they was the called out children of god now so what did moabite do they had a prophet and they had vindication but they didn't so what did they do they went and got one so we have a prophet too now they still have their line they still have their thought they still have their approach now that spirit is in the message so they went and got a prophet too they went and got william branham to be their prophet too [Music] now they've got a prophet it just happens to be the same prophet the elect is god but they're preaching evidences they're preaching anointings they're preaching the holy spirit as a person the holy spirit is not a person it's an office the same spirit that was in jesus was the holy spirit the same spirit that was in the beginning was the holy spirit the holy spirit if i can quote this is the same god not in flesh form but in spirit form that's all you don't ask the fact the holy spirit or the holy ghost didn't even come to speak of itself but to bring you in remembrance of the word so when we say you need to be baptized with the holy ghost we are not talking about a a separate experience many people have intellectually come to the knowledge of jesus christ as savior and based on that they've changed their lives which is good but the experience of the true believer is to have the same spirit that was in jesus christ dwell in you and the works that i do shall you do also so you can we sometimes get starting to refer to as the holy spirit like it's something different the same holy spirit that makes you praise god is the whole same holy spirit that makes you read your bible it's the same spirit that makes you turn your car key on there's not a level that all of a sudden you say the spirit's here the spirit is here because the word said the spirit was here but now that the the they're measuring i'll tell you when you have a meeting because when someone hears the word of god they go home and they apply the token and satan's moved out of their life that's a meeting and i'm sure that people rejoiced at the loaves and fishes in the days of jesus let's go look at all the demons that were cast out after that meeting okay so this spirit see that now so they went and got one so now to this spirit now moves into the framework of the church is that right what happened at nicaea satan got access to the name of jesus christ and now started putting his same system his same line was now being presented in the name of jesus christ and now he's covered up so now this same spirit wants to get back into the bride so they've got to gain access so they go find themselves a prophet which just happens to be william branham and now they're trying to use william branham to bring their same line of thought that's what i see and i i just pray that you understand because this prophet began a real prophet of god begin to challenge a real prophet of god did you know that's right what happened ben was a real prophet of god he heard from god he sought the will of the word of the lord he was a real prophet now you've got a prophet challenging a prophet and let me tell you that spirit is in this message right now of challenging people whether they've got the holy ghost or not and providing an evidence thereof i know the secret of deliverance ministry you know how you have a deliverance ministry first of all you convict everybody that they're sinners and you're needy and you're short i don't mean height wise you're lacking in spiritual things you're not spiritual you're not where you should be you know you you're a secret sinner you think that's a new approach job sat there with boils lost everything had no appearance of any victory whatsoever and his friends this other line was there convicting him of being a secret sinner but what's the one thing that job knew he had offered the sacrifice according to the word of god you know you're a sinner you're a secret sinner god would be pouring out his blessings on you no you know what all that suffering got job the greatest revelation any believer should ever have though the skin worms eat my flesh yet i will see god glory to god you don't think that was worth everything to job it didn't matter to him anymore he knew he was going to live he knew he was going to come alive so that so he says he says now look at he said they had a the blessings of god moving right along with them and they was the called out children of god 104. now we find that so perfectly types here in them churches of today as moab was not so israel was sojourner from place to place wherever the pillar of fire moved they moved with it moab not so they were settled down in their own denomination down in their own nation they didn't move they stayed there that's that comes very personal are you moving let's look at ourselves individually and i'll i'll be the question asker which i have to answer myself am i moving with god have i been in the same spiritual place have i have i prayed for revelation have i asked god to move on my spirit to transform me more like him or if and this is what we do and this is real common with teenagers and and if you've lived a while and you've raised a few you understand that that they come along and they find little comfort pockets a certain style a certain this a certain that you know i mean if you go back and look at some hairdos out of the 50s none of you would do that they took a comb and they puffed their hair way up like this and then they took a big ball of hair and stuck it in there you know and and you'd look at those hairstyles today and you'd go home but every kid had them the flip the feet you know do so any of your black sisters remember the afros i don't know why they called them afros i didn't see any when i was in africa they were american froze you don't see that anymore you know i never saw an extension when i was in school i love them nothing against them wear your hair any way you want to just don't cut it but we find pockets of comfort we find groups of comfort people we're comfortable with people that don't challenge us and if you're not careful god's pulling on your heart to move on with him and you'd want to stay put and that's the worst thing that can happen to a local assembly is when you get such a group feeling about yourself such a group anointing such a comforting song service that everybody just wants to get there and stay put but what does the eagle have to do eventually he's got to kick you out of your nest and sometimes we hop from one nest to another nest to another nest and that's fine just as long as you're moving up so if you're going to go from one nest to the other make sure it's out up the mountain towards the sky don't keep moving down into the world so this is a spirit that meets us along the way to stay put to get in a comfort zone to get a job get in the lifestyle get in our income set our budget and then i'm just going to fulfill the system i'm going to give my offering my tithes i'm going to go to church on sunday i'm going to go back to my job no this spirit that's the spirit of the other line the spirit of god's line is they're a sojourner they're moving they're moving into revelation they're moving into further thing they're praying for revelation god is taking the individual and transforming that individual into the image of his son and he wants to express himself in you the way he made you the way that he wants to by the attributes and characteristics and gifts he gave you don't be ashamed of christ in you because it's the hope of glory he says so they didn't move they were set they didn't move they stayed right there they had their celebrities maybe their revivalists listen what he said they had ordained things as they should do and they had their warriors that's preachers they had their fighters they had their king they got a lot of their orders from and so on but muam saw israel with something they didn't have and they sent over this is the paragraph 105 they didn't have so they sent over to another country and hired a prophet to come over so they could have a prophet and would have the power amongst them just like israel had amongst them now we're just going to close up here on these two lines and we're going to we're going to come down here and read and so they're talking they both have the same prophets they both have the same things let's go to paragraph 111. he said so i mean 110. and some of them said god said do this and god said do that now i don't question that but if it's out of the line of god's word the prophet no matter if he be is a prophet he's out of the line so many people get deceived like that oh this brother can do this and this brother can do that and deny the word so you understand he's pointing out this is where people get deceived is by the two lines because they're so close now you say brother gary what am i going to do the message came to reveal the son of perdition and that's why we get i sav that we can see now you think oh i'm overwhelmed i can never fight this devil god gave you the weapon to fight him with and he promised i will not leave you nor forsake you let's just close real quick here he says now i don't question that but if it's not the like he says the prophet no matter if he's a prophet he's out of the line so many people get deceived like that though i speak with tongues of men and angels though that i have gifts that i can move mountains i give all my goods to feed the poor yet i am nothing many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have i not prophesied in your name now i want you to understand this spirit it's doing works it's doing wonders they're standing up and prophesying and speaking in tongues there's everything is going on that you would think that that's god now you've got to know something so you have got to have an absolute something that your anchor to that you know is the vindicated true word of god else not what's moving you the move is moving you the very spirit that's in the framework of the church is what's moving it's what's influencing it's raising questions in your mind it's challenging you just like the prophet challenged uh challenged moses do you got the holy ghost is your church on fire is your pastor preaching the move of god i know god's move it's that pillar of fire the church moves with the pillar of fire that's what the church moves with as that fire goes into the storehouse and brings the food out and feeds it but they won't even play tapes no they'll say brother branham brother bran and brother bran and brother bran and brother brown because they've got a prophet too but tell you what he said they might say he said it's your responsibility except and yet i'm nothing many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have i not prophesied in the name have i not in your name i've cast out devils in done mighty works and i will say unto them depart from you depart from me you workers of iniquity i never even knew you yet they come with a confession that they have did it that's their confession we did that yet they come with the confession that they did it but jesus said they were workers of iniquity what is iniquity it's something that you know you should do that's right to do and yet you don't do it see what is going to be in the last days now let me tell you something brother branham was a prophet you understand if everything that he spoke was so obvious then we would have never recognized the spirituality of it they just thought brother branham was a crank they just thought he was a critic but he was literally pointing out the son of perdition trying to come in and seduce the bride of jesus christ and telling us and prophesying to us the things that were there and he says so he says here's the whole line and that's my purpose tonight i said i'd be out at nine o'clock but i'm going to be a little bit after maybe look at look that was my whole purpose to show you this line by the word of god the god has to keep his word in order to stay god so we can go on we know that baal god spoke to balaam and yet he didn't he didn't take the answer that god gave him that you know brother bram said a lot of things that people just don't want to take one you can receive the holy ghost without sensation what the evidence of the holy ghost really is what the holy ghost really is it's the spirit of jesus christ the thing you're going to be raptured by is the same spirit that well dwelt in jesus christ dwelling in you so it it it's a a beautiful thing so we can see this lines they'll fuss and they'll debate they'll do all that but let's just turn over here to paragraph 1 23 and and we'll just finish up with this next few paragraphs because now we want to talk about where we've been talking about that line okay another another characteristic of that line is in paragraph 130 he says you know i'm able to promote you look where he's getting his word from the head of the nation where did moses getting his word the king of heaven amen so we understand how that this spirit promoted itself i probably i hope you're still with me but even in our ranks what happens is ministers get promoted they get promoted to fame they get promoted to a bigger name they get promoted to bigger meetings they become headliners so so this is that line you you know you begin to look at that line you look at where they're getting their orders from you you look at the things that are are going around you you start to measure them but we don't measure ourselves by that line you understand we don't measure ourselves by that standard you know they measure themselves by a better class of people they don't want poor people even though god came to the poor of this world rich in faith they like a better class of people the working-class people the person that maybe doesn't have all the same ways they don't get sucked up into fellowship they sit around the table begging crumbs and then people get lifted up they've got names they're they they've got great influence a better class of people they they go for personality the personality of the preacher it doesn't you know pair really what he's saying now he's accepted because of his personalities accepted because of his fame he's accepted because of his style measure somebody by the truth eat you know eat the pie spit out the seeds but look at the whole content of the message we're into buzzwords right say the buzzword that's all you got to hear so i'm waiting do i hear the buzzword why do they call the buzzword because i press your button and you start buzzing we want to go forward don't we we want to go higher we've got to understand there is a spirit another line that wants to interbreed and that's what the moaiths did in israel did they mix the two lines and and we know something else about uh uh moab's group they they never liked their true believer anyway down in their heart we judge people by we judge people by buildings and by beauty numbers numbers don't mean nothing number means you've got more deceived people in your midst you've got more make-believers more unbelievers numbers don't mean anything numbers shouldn't mean a thing to you one thing should move you that's the word of god so you know our worship becomes the way that we worship we base it on talent that's that line how many people get in that spirit and now they become they become performers oh yeah i've seen it now i'm going to perform they get a yodel in their voice they're in the spotlight you don't think the spotlight moves you sure it affects us we become talented you know we don't want to sit in the corner you know we don't want to sing behind the piano we don't want to sing you know pretty soon we're performers put me in the spotlight i'm for it if it's genuine but let me tell you about a genuine trip to the altar you're not dancing and running in the spirit in one service and at the altar in the next something created the change it was the mixing of the lines am i preaching too hard it's a mixing of the lines and and it's not bad it's just that you've got to know it for yourself the people are of of of that moabite line that's what they are okay that's fine we are mixed together the two seeds grow up together but it's you you that's got to be able to make sure that you can recognize that and you're not going to be moved by that and you have your absolute you know who you're following we played the tape wednesday night called faith and and people say well why do you play a prayer line from 50 years ago i'll tell you why because 50 years ago that was the word and he is the word and when we played that tape he was here he was doing the same things because he got they say god dwells in his church our line god dwells in his word [Music] we're reading a sermon that's 50 years old and it's more true right now in this hour they didn't even recognize it then they weren't there for what he was teaching they were there for the loaves and the fishes they were there for the miracles they were there to see if they could imitate it and they always tried to criticize it they were jealous of it in everything these are things that you and i would tell you but you cannot escape the challenge that's being present it to us to eat our bread with singleness of heart and to work out our salvation with fear and trembling and and so that that was this line but let's just talk about our line for a second okay he said that let's just start it with this paragraph we'll read this and we be finished down in his heart he didn't like them they wasn't of his group and anything that didn't belong in his group wasn't right to begin with see he looked down at them and said there has been some awful thing then people did surely a holy god will curse such a people as that they they're they're illiterate they're not educated like us we're a smarter people oh they claim to serve god but look at them what are they a bunch of why a bunch of slaves mud daubers that the egyptians run out down there why god would never have anything to do with a dirty bunch like that oh god's not gonna have anything to do with somebody that sits there solid as a rock and believes every word now just listen closely we're talking about our line now where we come from what our characteristics are he failed to see that smitten rock and that brass serpent that pillar of fire he tried to judge them from a moral standpoint i can't come here every service and keep judging you by your moral standpoint and see if i can fall on some shortcoming that makes you feel that you're not living up to my christian moral standard now just think of that you're not living up to the moral standard look okay you desire to be more like the lord jesus you'll lose that when you think you've got it you will never ever think that you're good enough for god you will always have a desire to be more godly to be more free from unbelief could be more thin you will always feel unworthy i'll step out of this pulpit and i'll go to my office and i'll feel like a hypocrite i won't want to come back tonight i want to run and hide i'm going to say to myself who do you think you are you go in there and you say these things you're a nobody that's just the way it is but there's one thing i know the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness he said it i believe it now listen to our line here as we close this morning he failed to see the smitten rock the brass serpent the pillar of fire he tried to judge them from a moral standpoint he failed to see the higher calling of god he failed to see the higher calling of god by grace by election they were in that line and with god's word they were in that line by grace by election now let's look at their characteristic they they were in that line they're with god's word and when he wanted to curse them god said don't you do it they're mine leave them alone don't touch them he said now so the man turned around went back now watch his denomination headquarters though he he he gets back they send more influential group this time they might have some instead of regular layman they have some doctors of divinity that come this time they might have bishops or maybe state presbyters they send a better group and a little more influential group somebody that had a little better education to lay it out in in plain out the plane to him better could it make it could make it reasonable you know they don't stay with just what the prophet said yes they're going to make it a little better a little more reasonable a little more palatable brother branham says some things that are extremely unpalatable he calls billy graham an angel and oral robert's an angel and he's the one that elohim stayed back with you think the world jumped up and down at the stuff he was saying they threw him out this message does not draw a crowd and because the message don't draw a crowd they try to substitute it with emotions anointings feelings and everything else somebody a little more influential someone who can get to you a little better who can explain it a little better who might have influence on you that maybe the local pastor doesn't have or or the humble church doesn't have or the little backwards brother doesn't have you know but paul said i didn't come to you with enticing words i came to you with power and demonstration of the spirit do you understand what we're reading this morning is the power and demonstration of the spirit of god to expose satan right where he's at even jesus said if you can't believe me for my word believe me for my works but what does the elect do they believe him for his word the works attracted them but they believed they believe for the word and so if he said a better more info somebody that can lay it out plainer because they want to move you into their line in their approach because they think that's what's best for you their motives aren't wrong their objectives aren't wrong they think they're helping they think they're doing god a service but let me tell you this is thus saith the lord god gave you the best weapon he could give you when he gave you the word of god in the form of this message that's what you need to be married to amen he said now listen to this this is us this is our line this is the line that we're a part of we cast down reasoning we believe god no matter what any thing else says we believe god we don't reason what god says you can't reason with it you have to accept it by faith now just turn with me real quick if you would to luke we just talked about this group right the higher calling look at luke 10 and and we'll start with verse 17. i am closing i just got to close and and the 70 returned you know the story he sent him out the 70 out he said in the 70 returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan satan has lightning falling from the heavens behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall be any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not but rejoice because your names are written in heaven hallelujah for the lamb's book of life that's what you read you rejoice for the higher calling by grace and by election if you have your bibles there we'll just flip over again to luke the 18th chapter and we'll read this verse there he said we cast down reasonings you don't have to reason anymore he said you have accepted it by faith so this is what we are trying our line has got to come into is faith and anything that you know you don't have to reason anymore i don't know how he does it i just believe he doesn't i don't know how he is going to keep that promise but he said he would do it i believe it i accept it on the basis that i believe that it's the word of god no sensation no anointing feeling just god said so i said that you say well you can't get by with that i don't know how i'll get by with it but he said so i remember my baptist pastor told me he said why billy you will preach to the post of the church why you think anybody will hear a thing like that i said god has said so how are you going to with a seventh grade education pray for kings and preachers around the world i said i don't know how i'm going to do it but he said so and that's just good enough for me see he said so i don't know how it's going to be done but it's based on he said so alone so if malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 in revelations 10 7 is the vindicated scriptures that were to be fulfilled in our age and we can look past the veil and see that was none other than the same lord jesus christ back in spirit form veiling himself in a messenger doing the same works then i believe we can have confidence in what he said and not be moved to another line of thought for any other presentation or any other uh something that's more explainable has greater feelings seems to have greater movement seems to have greater thing because it's not a group it's you sitting on your couch clicking on your recorder and knowing that god is speaking to you does that do away with the five-fold ministry no he uses the fightful ministry to bring things to your remembrance but the five-fold ministry is not to take the place of the husband and wife relationship in the bride so we come to see that we're not measured by anything what we're measured by is faith we're measured by god said so i don't know how i don't know when but if he said so that settles it he said i was elected i may not look elected i may not act elected i may have a lot of shortcomings but i'll tell you one thing he said so that settles it so do you believe it when he tells you your name's written in the lamb's book of life do you believe it when he tells you that your sins are washed away do you believe that you can have whatsoever things you ask do you believe so do that understand god's not looking to the beauty he's not looking for the emotion he's not looking for the intellectual explanation he's not looking for a system that's got great preachers and great outpourings and great things he's not looking at a group he's looking at you and your individual faith in him that's what he wants to cultivate that you say to this mountain be moved that you say to this tree be plucked up and you can have it amen don't be afraid to move up the ladder and take the power of the resurrection into your life and start claiming the things you want loved ones sick children sick parents lost children [Music] whatever it is that's what he wants to see forget the substitute i would that you would all stand up and jump up and down like jumping jacks praise god i love to praise god i would that you spoke in tongues i've spoken tongues more than all of you praise god but when it the curtains closed and the show's over are you married to this or you're positive of it nothing wavers you nothing questions you nothing raises doubt i can grab the tambourine and dance down the beach with miriam but i know when moses speaks it's thus saith the lord the two lines and if we read this scripture let's stand together as we read this scripture superbowl the widow who sought the judge and and wouldn't let him go until she got what she asked for and the lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth this message was a restoration of the position of the believer to take god at his word if anything god wants moving let it be faith first the church is built on faith the individual's built on faith all things are possible only believe let us rise in the arms of faith let us not be moved by whatever the world's doing we're not going to pattern ourselves after the way this world holds their services we're not going to worship according to what's the top 10 hip parade song you know we don't need to have a light show here we don't have to have a mini concert but what we have to have is faith you've got to have the faith that if you've got a devil that's parked in your life you'll never sing them out of there you'll never shout them out of there you'll never lay hands on them and have them come out of there the only thing that moves him is faith satan you're in my life and my life belongs to him and this is what the word says now that other line will offer you a substitute it'll offer you an emotion it'll offer you some deliverance my prayer will cast them out no everything you ever read if thou can't believe if doubts can't believe if they shall believe you shall lay hands on them and cows if they shall believe these works will follow them that believe it's not in a movement it's in you and he's given you the faith it comes with the seed and the high calling that's why paul said let's leave those things watch our behind behind and press for the high calling that's where we want to go we want to go to the hyde calling silver and gold have i none but as doubt can believe rise up and walk you can have what you asked for this morning don't be proud if your marriage is you're maybe a fussing a little and you're a little upset or there's a misunderstanding or those things we have i have faith i just think leslie rules me by faith i do something she just goes believes and pretty soon i'm doing something now aren't you glad you have a god like that let's move mountains let's let's have the faith let's go to the line that we're called up the line of the higher calling leaving those which things which are behind and rise up in the arms of faith let's find our line and let's walk in it i want to be a part of this line don't you amen let's power heads in prayer lord we just read a few pages lord we see you standing in your word today calling us to a place where we don't reason we just believe we know that our line has a true prophet we have the brass servant serpent we have the pillar of fire we have the signs and wonders and we have the truth that sets us free and father we know there's another line that's trying to intermarry because that's what happened on the journey in a perfect type they begin to blend their worship they begin to blend their musics they begin to blend their sermon styles and it all just began to blend father and it began to become a group and it began to come a movement and so many of the jews left their line and married into that and father i just stand here this morning not talking to the world i'm not talking to any other church i'm talking to our body of believers that we each become steadfast and we know our higher calling and we know that it's the faith in your word that we're resting on so we just ask you to help us this morning be with us father may they have grace for me being longer this morning than i should have but we ask you to help us father may this set deep and father may they go home and take out this great message and listen to all the beauty that's held within it we ask these things in jesus name oh this is my desire oh [Music] within [Music] and i me you praise [Music] lord i give
