[49:14] name born Traeger born
[49:20] thank you brother
[49:22] amen praise the Lord
[49:26] well I have to say uh I've learned a
[49:30] very valuable lesson this weekend and
[49:31] that it's not
[49:34] not to share about how long I like to
[49:37] study before a sermon
[49:41] seems like he Brother David decided it's
[49:45] best to just uh call me on the spot if I
[49:47] do that so
[49:50] I appreciate all the prayers and
[49:52] um
[49:53] if y'all would let's turn turn to the
[49:56] scripture Leviticus 24
[50:00] starting with
[50:02] verses 1 through 4.
[50:05] and while you're all turning there I I
[50:08] just wanted to say that
[50:11] um I'm going to be taking the time to
[50:13] just
[50:14] share my testimony tonight and my my a
[50:18] little bit of my life story
[50:21] so
[50:23] when you reach that you say Amen
[50:25] praise the Lord
[50:29] Leviticus 24 1.
[50:32] and the Lord
[50:34] spake unto Moses saying
[50:36] I want you to to notice right there I
[50:39] want to stop right there for a little
[50:41] bit and just take time to think about
[50:43] that for a minute and the Lord spake
[50:45] unto Moses
[50:47] and if you think about that it's no
[50:49] different than the Lord spoken to
[50:52] brother Branham it's no different it's
[50:54] the only difference is the name it could
[50:57] have very easily been changed around to
[50:59] where it could have been an hour day
[51:00] that Moses was here and brother brother
[51:03] Brandon would have been back there and
[51:04] the Lord spoke to brother Branham and
[51:05] he's it's the very same thing in our day
[51:07] that he spoke to brother Branham and he
[51:10] gave us the words it was the very
[51:13] inspiration that came to Moses then it
[51:15] was the very inspiration that came to
[51:16] brother Brandon in our day so the only
[51:18] difference is uh the Lord said the
[51:21] prophet spoke in our day was recorded by
[51:24] a tape whereas uh the words that was
[51:26] recorded by Moses was in in in in in
[51:30] letter form
[51:32] and in verse 2 it says command the
[51:35] children of Israel that they bring unto
[51:38] the pure oil now if you notice command
[51:41] this was not a request if you will if
[51:45] you feel like it it was a command in
[51:47] that day that they bring unto Aaron the
[51:50] priest a pure oil and it had to be a
[51:53] pure oil it was not just any oil it was
[51:55] not just a just any oil that they found
[51:58] or any oil that they could produce it
[52:00] had to be a pure oil
[52:02] uh from an olive olive beaten for the
[52:05] light to cause the lamps to burn
[52:07] continually without the veil of the
[52:10] testimony
[52:12] in the Tabernacle of the congregation
[52:14] shall Aaron order it before the Lord
[52:17] continually
[52:19] and if you notice I want to stress in
[52:21] that word a little bit as well
[52:22] continually as it is mentioned
[52:25] uh
[52:26] three times it in in these verses
[52:30] without the veil of the testimony in the
[52:32] Tabernacle of the congregation
[52:34] shall Aaron order
[52:36] it from the evening into the morning
[52:39] before the Lord continually it shall be
[52:42] a statute and in other words a statute
[52:46] stands for in it translates to law it in
[52:49] in in other words it is
[52:52] it is
[52:53] before the Lord continually it shall be
[52:56] a law forever in your Generations he
[53:00] shall order the lamps upon the pure
[53:01] Candlestick and as the prophet said a
[53:04] Candlestick
[53:06] also is uh in that day it's it's good
[53:10] for a lampstand it was a lampstand and
[53:13] so in other words it would be a pure
[53:16] lampstand before the Lord continually
[53:18] and I just love the detail that they put
[53:20] in that it was not just any lampstanding
[53:22] he said he said that for a reason a pure
[53:25] Candlestick a pure lampstand before the
[53:28] Lord continually
[53:30] let's go to the Lord of Lord of Prayer
[53:33] Lord Jesus father
[53:36] such a wonderful Name Lord that

[54:45] it is a privilege and an honor to be
[54:49] here tonight
[54:50] and um
[54:52] I have to say I'm
[54:55] I'm just
[54:57] very young yet in in the ministry and
[55:01] and this is my first time that I've ever
[55:04] had that I've only had two hours to
[55:06] prepare for a sermon
[55:10] pray for the Lord
[55:13] so like I said I I wanted to start with
[55:18] um sharing a little bit of my life story
[55:21] and starting out
[55:25] I
[55:28] I grew up as a little Amish boy and
[55:33] and for many of you who may not be
[55:35] familiar with the Amish they I do
[55:38] respect their
[55:39] their
[55:41] way of living and their original motive
[55:45] of the why they want to live the way
[55:47] they did they want it to be separated
[55:49] from the world they chose to live that
[55:51] lifestyle because
[55:54] it was their way of
[55:57] being separated from everything that was
[55:59] going on they wanted to live a holy life
[56:01] before the Lord and that's the best way
[56:03] that they knew to do it
[56:06] and so that is the lifestyle that I grew
[56:08] up in there was no technology there was
[56:10] we um we
[56:13] our way of getting around was with a
[56:15] horse-drawn carriage horse and Buggies
[56:17] while we called it
[56:18] and I grew up in northeastern Missouri
[56:22] was born and raised there
[56:25] and growing up it was a very simple life
[56:28] we we didn't have like I say we didn't
[56:31] have technology we didn't have electric
[56:32] we didn't have we uh finally at the age
[56:36] of
[56:37] at the age of I'm get I if I remember
[56:40] right it's like seven or eight is when I
[56:43] first remembered that we actually were
[56:44] able to have running water in our house
[56:45] that uh we always had to carry water in
[56:48] we had running water into the property
[56:51] but we never were able to have it into
[56:52] the house so we had to go out to the to
[56:55] the
[56:56] um
[56:57] what would it was a hydrant out in the
[57:00] middle somewhere we just had to get a
[57:01] pail of water and take it inside that's
[57:03] where we drink our how we had our water
[57:05] to do whatever we needed to do
[57:08] and so finally
[57:10] um
[57:11] the bishop which is the bishop of the
[57:14] community every Community has to have a
[57:15] bishop that is that is how the community
[57:18] has run that the bishop decides what how
[57:22] we live and what we live by we have all
[57:24] these Traditions that we live by and and
[57:26] and some communities are allowed to have
[57:29] cell phones some are allowed to be able
[57:31] to drive vehicles they can't own them
[57:33] but they can drive them some are allowed
[57:34] to have cell phones they can't own them
[57:35] but use them some can use them and own
[57:37] them
[57:39] um so every Community is a little bit
[57:41] different it is all based on what the
[57:43] bishop decides just to put in simple
[57:45] terms
[57:47] and in our community in particular we
[57:49] did we were not allowed to have cell
[57:50] phones we were not allowed to have uh
[57:53] Power mowers the only power mower that I
[57:55] had was push them by my arms and that
[57:57] was a challenge
[57:58] but it was a good great exercise we
[58:01] didn't go to the gym but that was the
[58:02] perfect way to do it
[58:04] and so it was very simple it was a very
[58:06] very simple life we
[58:09] um
[58:09] we would get home in the evenings the
[58:11] house was dark we had to grab a match
[58:13] FInd matches
[58:14] and
[58:16] um light our lamps and that was what was
[58:19] our light we had maybe a lantern a gas
[58:22] lantern that we would
[58:24] use to have in our living room would be
[58:28] hanging on the ceiling and we'd have to
[58:29] take it down from ceiling light it hang
[58:31] it back up and that would be our light
[58:33] and then of course once we head to bed
[58:35] we weren't able to do like Matthew as
[58:37] able to Matthew McGarry is able to do he
[58:38] can just say hey Google turn off the
[58:40] lights it didn't work that way it was it
[58:43] was hey honey could you go blow out the
[58:44] lantern please
[58:48] and so it it was it was that was our
[58:51] lifestyle we did not have heater AC we
[58:54] did have heat and that was a wood stove
[58:56] and it
[58:58] it would
[59:00] uh having a wood stove would really help
[59:02] my mom clean the house a lot more often
[59:04] with all the smoke blowing around every
[59:06] time
[59:07] um but no AC the only AC we had was the
[59:10] windows open
[59:11] all day and all night and a hot summer
[59:13] day
[59:14] with screens to keep the insects out of
[59:17] course but we had flies all around every
[59:19] time
[59:20] every day and I have to say I've I I was
[59:25] always a strange person because I
[59:26] enjoyed them but my mom didn't she hated
[59:28] me
[59:29] and
[59:31] my mom she would I remember coming home
[59:34] from our private school we had a little
[59:35] private school in the community
[59:37] and I loved it it was it was
[59:40] um
[59:42] it was
[59:43] a
[59:45] it was easy to haven't you know our
[59:49] personal little
[59:51] school we all spoke the same language
[59:53] and in this in this case we had one
[59:56] language and that was our German which
[59:58] is everybody knows it by Pennsylvania
[1:00:00] Dutch
[1:00:02] and that was our language so we learned
[1:00:04] that language at home so we actually had
[1:00:06] to learn the English language
[1:00:08] we had to learn that so that was
[1:00:10] actually part of our schooling was to
[1:00:11] learn that language because that's
[1:00:12] something we were not taught at home
[1:00:15] um so under my family we all left the
[1:00:18] Amish at the same time so under our
[1:00:19] family that's still our main language is
[1:00:21] is the German language and and um
[1:00:24] uh
[1:00:25] so uh I I have many fond memories from
[1:00:29] our our little private school but I I I
[1:00:32] I remember coming home and my mom would
[1:00:34] be baking
[1:00:36] and she didn't have a guest so like I
[1:00:37] said it was wood so even if it was 90
[1:00:40] degrees outside with no AC all the
[1:00:43] windows would be open and we'd still
[1:00:45] have that hot wood stove burning to bake
[1:00:47] whatever she was baking or canning
[1:00:49] whatever she was doing
[1:00:51] and it was extremely hot on the in in
[1:00:53] that house it was very very hot I had
[1:00:55] now now the fact that we have all the AC
[1:00:57] and everything we have I'm just trying
[1:00:59] to think back and imagine how we
[1:01:00] survived it but
[1:01:02] but I forgot those days honestly
[1:01:04] and I don't regret it
[1:01:09] um
[1:01:11] so yeah she uh she would bake with her
[1:01:15] with her wood stove and so that was part
[1:01:18] of my chores and evening was to make
[1:01:20] sure that we still had wood supplied in
[1:01:22] the house every evening
[1:01:24] and then we had livestock as well
[1:01:27] and it was fun I loved I loved taking
[1:01:30] care of the chickens
[1:01:31] and summer times was my favorite time
[1:01:33] there was not that many responsibilities
[1:01:35] growing up it was like heaven you know I
[1:01:37] could go back in the woods and we would
[1:01:39] build our houses we would
[1:01:43] we would be inspired by all these
[1:01:45] western books we didn't have movies so
[1:01:47] we had western books and as boys we have
[1:01:49] fun reading these books and you know
[1:01:52] talking about these Six Guns and how
[1:01:55] they would twirl them on their fingers
[1:01:57] and all that you know it was it was fun
[1:01:59] we we would pick up little branches that
[1:02:01] looked like pistols and we would use
[1:02:03] those and we'd play around and and then
[1:02:05] we'd have friends over and we'd ride
[1:02:07] ponies and our horses you know we it
[1:02:09] that that that was our life and I really
[1:02:11] enjoyed it I I have to say I don't
[1:02:13] regret where I came from
[1:02:15] but at the same time I'm glad I'm not
[1:02:18] there either I'm I'm very thankful
[1:02:22] that the Lord has shown me the truth in
[1:02:24] this day and my family we all we all
[1:02:27] left at the same time like I said we we
[1:02:29] we came to the message but I'll I'll
[1:02:31] come back in come to that in a minute
[1:02:34] and so
[1:02:37] and yeah in in in the summertime it was
[1:02:41] we were Carefree we were able to do what
[1:02:43] we we weren't able to do everything we
[1:02:45] wanted to do we had boundaries but still
[1:02:46] we were able to play back in the woods
[1:02:48] we were able to uh it it was just it was
[1:02:51] all I can say is I have many many fond
[1:02:53] memories of of doing that and and
[1:02:56] um
[1:02:57] and
[1:03:02] being a strange kid as I am or it used
[1:03:05] to being I'm not anymore my wife still
[1:03:07] thinks I am but I thought I'm pretty
[1:03:08] normal by now
[1:03:10] I used to enjoy
[1:03:12] going out in the chicken coop and just
[1:03:14] laying down and having the chicken set
[1:03:15] all over me
[1:03:17] and it was relaxing I'd take a nap like
[1:03:20] that and
[1:03:21] and um
[1:03:24] and
[1:03:26] yeah
[1:03:27] um unfortunately my family didn't see it
[1:03:29] that way but
[1:03:32] I I used to when I was younger I'd go
[1:03:35] out and eat with the dog when I was
[1:03:36] hungry after supper all the scraps would
[1:03:38] be thrown out for a dog to eat and then
[1:03:39] my family would find me out there eating
[1:03:42] eating with the dog and
[1:03:44] so I've I've
[1:03:46] always been
[1:03:48] been very very strange and
[1:03:54] I've also
[1:03:58] had some struggles
[1:04:00] in my
[1:04:03] uh years in school
[1:04:05] I never we had eight grades in our
[1:04:09] school and I I I never made it to the
[1:04:11] eighth grade I I
[1:04:15] was dyslexic and my teachers
[1:04:19] did not understand what was going on and
[1:04:22] and I just had trouble with learning and
[1:04:24] of course being a private school you
[1:04:26] know we none of the teachers they were
[1:04:28] basically just hired by the community
[1:04:29] all right we'll pick a young girl here
[1:04:31] she'll take this on like she's been
[1:04:33] through the grades so she understands a
[1:04:34] little bit she knows the answer if she
[1:04:36] can help us that's basically it there
[1:04:38] was no there was no training that the
[1:04:39] teacher went through there was nothing
[1:04:40] for her to learn how to really
[1:04:43] be a good teacher and
[1:04:46] so
[1:04:48] so they would never really understand my
[1:04:52] challenges and and so I just
[1:04:55] I I found it hard I wanted to learn but
[1:04:58] I found it hard to
[1:05:00] and I just based I just soon lost my
[1:05:02] interest in learning so I
[1:05:06] uh in later years and my mom just
[1:05:09] homeschooled
[1:05:10] me and and the rest of my siblings
[1:05:12] actually and
[1:05:13] and
[1:05:17] I
[1:05:19] I was criticized many times in school
[1:05:22] and
[1:05:24] it thinks it just I I wasn't very well
[1:05:27] liked among
[1:05:28] the students
[1:05:30] and so
[1:05:33] I I found it a challenge I found it a
[1:05:36] challenge to I had this stuttering
[1:05:39] problem and and it just seems like I
[1:05:42] couldn't do anything right
[1:05:44] and
[1:05:45] then in in in later years growing up I
[1:05:49] made so many mistakes
[1:05:52] and like I said I I I was a crazy child
[1:05:55] so I I have to say I embarrassed my dad
[1:05:58] a few times as well
[1:05:59] and so but yet at the same time I always
[1:06:02] felt like I have a purpose
[1:06:04] I have a purpose in life
[1:06:07] and
[1:06:09] I didn't know what it was
[1:06:11] but there was just something in me
[1:06:14] at growing up like that
[1:06:17] feeling like
[1:06:18] many Town sailing alone I just didn't
[1:06:20] have friends
[1:06:21] and I was just odd
[1:06:23] the rest of my siblings did
[1:06:26] um
[1:06:27] and it hurt and though nobody really
[1:06:28] seemed to notice and I wouldn't share
[1:06:30] anything I kept all that bottled up
[1:06:32] inside and
[1:06:33] and I was trying to make sense of of
[1:06:36] this life and
[1:06:40] and in in later years that took effect
[1:06:43] on me
[1:06:45] but I've always I've always felt like
[1:06:47] there's just something more that I can
[1:06:48] do and so finally as the years went on
[1:06:51] my dad
[1:06:53] started reading the Bible and that is
[1:06:55] something you just can't do in the out
[1:06:57] the Amish community is read an English
[1:06:59] Bible it's not allowed and the reason
[1:07:02] for that is because the English Bible if
[1:07:05] you truly take some time to study it it
[1:07:09] things are revealed to you
[1:07:11] and in the Amish community there's so
[1:07:13] many things that the Traditions that the
[1:07:15] Amish have and well first of all
[1:07:18] um uh
[1:07:20] uh uh Jesus himself
[1:07:22] speaks out against the traditions of man
[1:07:24] so that's already puts all that away
[1:07:28] but the more that my dad started reading
[1:07:31] the scriptures he he began to question
[1:07:34] whether the Amish lifestyle was right
[1:07:37] and whether
[1:07:39] um it truly took us to heaven the way
[1:07:41] they were saying it would it's the only
[1:07:43] way you can go to heaven is if you live
[1:07:45] the Amish life so basically every
[1:07:48] 99.99 of all the world is lost in from
[1:07:52] the Amish Viewpoint the only the
[1:07:53] embouchure can be saved and the only way
[1:07:56] anybody can be saved is if they join the
[1:07:58] Amish community so they basically have
[1:08:00] to leave everything behind they have to
[1:08:02] join us and live our lifestyle in order
[1:08:05] to be saved and go to heaven
[1:08:07] so basically in my relatives eyes and
[1:08:11] everybody that knows that we left the
[1:08:13] Amish
[1:08:14] we're lost to them
[1:08:16] but
[1:08:18] it just it's it I have a burden for them
[1:08:21] because they don't know they don't know
[1:08:23] what we know and like I said I just
[1:08:26] praise the Lord that
[1:08:28] he's revealed this to me because I I I I
[1:08:30] was just thinking about that you know I
[1:08:32] could
[1:08:34] I could very easily not be here anymore
[1:08:36] because
[1:08:37] of of the things I've gone through I've
[1:08:39] studied with
[1:08:41] suicidal issues for many many years
[1:08:45] and
[1:08:47] it
[1:08:51] it was it was hard and
[1:08:55] I wanted to take my life so many times
[1:08:59] and
[1:09:08] finally
[1:09:10] I I knew that life was wrong that
[1:09:13] thought process was wrong and
[1:09:15] and finally one day
[1:09:20] my dad seen that he had to he had to do
[1:09:22] something for me
[1:09:24] and so he sent me off somewhere he said
[1:09:27] he's he sent me to a
[1:09:30] um
[1:09:32] to a seminar in Colorado
[1:09:36] and it was all about
[1:09:38] seeing
[1:09:40] finding your purpose in this life and it
[1:09:43] was a blessing even though
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:47] this place that I was sent to had
[1:09:51] um
[1:09:53] you know it had it it was not based on
[1:09:55] Christian values it was based strictly
[1:09:57] on helping people become a better you
[1:10:01] just to put in simple terms and so he
[1:10:03] sent me there hoping that would help me
[1:10:05] in which he did and I I I just thank the
[1:10:08] Lord for for leading me that way
[1:10:11] um it was there that I've learned I've
[1:10:13] learned
[1:10:15] that I have a purpose in life
[1:10:17] and it was there that I
[1:10:21] I took some time to really
[1:10:26] find my purpose and what I've always
[1:10:28] wanted to do was to be a blessing to the
[1:10:30] people
[1:10:31] and
[1:10:35] and anyway but uh back to my story so my
[1:10:41] dad began to question whether it was
[1:10:43] right and so finally he left we we all
[1:10:47] left
[1:10:48] um
[1:10:50] uh my mom my dad both they just they
[1:10:53] they just my dad first it was revealed
[1:10:56] to him that this is not right the Amish
[1:10:58] way is not right and so he he
[1:11:01] um I came to my mom she was a little bit
[1:11:03] reluctant but then finally one night
[1:11:07] she was really burdened about this and
[1:11:09] and and the the the the the Lord tester
[1:11:12] that night revealed it to her and and
[1:11:15] that was it so after that we left the
[1:11:17] Amish
[1:11:18] and I was excited of course like I I I
[1:11:23] was a redneck as a family so when I
[1:11:25] heard that they were leaving I was
[1:11:27] excited I was like now I can wear jeans
[1:11:29] I don't have to I don't have to abide by
[1:11:31] these rules anymore I can I can drive a
[1:11:33] car now and I was excited but before all
[1:11:37] this happened to back this up a little
[1:11:39] bit
[1:11:40] I was not aware that my parents were
[1:11:45] going through this process and
[1:11:49] my dad had a palette
[1:11:53] we would sell pallets to a certain
[1:11:55] company and so it was me and my
[1:11:58] brother's job to build these pallets and
[1:12:00] so one afternoon while we were building
[1:12:03] pallets we got bored and so we were like
[1:12:04] well we're going to go do a little
[1:12:05] fishing my parents ain't home anyway and
[1:12:07] they won't know so we went out to the
[1:12:09] pond to do some fishing and suddenly I
[1:12:11] seen the van come around the curve and I
[1:12:12] was like oh dad's coming so we quickly
[1:12:15] we started running up there and just as
[1:12:17] we got up close to the shed I seen him
[1:12:20] coming in the driveway mine was sitting
[1:12:22] in the passenger seat my dad was driving
[1:12:25] and I was feeling like a center for
[1:12:26] disobeying him and not doing pallets but
[1:12:29] at this point I was wondering which of
[1:12:30] us is actually the real sinner because
[1:12:31] he's driving a car
[1:12:37] so
[1:12:39] at that point it that was that was the
[1:12:43] the changing point for us
[1:12:45] um he
[1:12:48] he drove behind the building parked the
[1:12:51] vehicle my mom wouldn't decide and and
[1:12:53] uh they both went inside actually and he
[1:12:56] he had one of my little brothers come
[1:12:58] out
[1:12:59] and um tell us tell me and me and my
[1:13:04] brother Joe that we got to come inside
[1:13:05] and I was like oh we're in trouble and
[1:13:07] so we go inside and he just sits down
[1:13:09] with the family
[1:13:11] and he's like I want you all to know
[1:13:13] that
[1:13:14] this is not wrong in God's eyes for us
[1:13:16] to drive a vehicle it's not wrong and
[1:13:19] God's eyes for us to change our
[1:13:20] lifestyle he it it's as long as we serve
[1:13:23] him that's all that matters but it is
[1:13:25] not wrong to drive a vehicle and change
[1:13:29] our clothes that's that's not a problem
[1:13:32] and so I was like okay it didn't I did
[1:13:35] not question it after that I was like
[1:13:36] okay that's fine perfect and at that
[1:13:39] point my mind started rolling like okay
[1:13:40] what else can I do now
[1:13:42] and
[1:13:44] so
[1:13:46] but
[1:13:47] uh for my oldest sister she's the oldest
[1:13:51] of family Mary
[1:13:52] she's she was the only one that was a
[1:13:55] little bit she was at the point where
[1:13:57] she was coming she was at the age where
[1:13:58] she was looking to get baptized in in
[1:14:01] into the Amish community and once you do
[1:14:04] that you're locked in so if you leave
[1:14:06] after you're baptized into the Amish
[1:14:08] community you're you will be shunned and
[1:14:10] you will not have any access unless if
[1:14:13] you want to return to the Amish there's
[1:14:16] a process you have to go through there's
[1:14:17] a long process uh you have to go through
[1:14:20] to come back in basically what they
[1:14:22] would consider the purification stage
[1:14:25] for you to come back
[1:14:27] and so she was come to that age where
[1:14:30] she was uh you know she really wondered
[1:14:34] whether my parents were making the right
[1:14:36] step but with a little bit of persuasion
[1:14:38] she finally was like okay it's it's good
[1:14:41] and so the whole family left we all left
[1:14:43] at the same time
[1:14:44] and
[1:14:47] and then
[1:14:49] of course it was hard after that because
[1:14:51] our relatives found out
[1:14:53] uh both of my grandparents on both sides
[1:14:57] um
[1:14:58] found out and so they were of course
[1:15:00] trying to
[1:15:02] convince us that it's wrong
[1:15:04] but my parents were settled their ways
[1:15:07] and there was no changing they were they
[1:15:10] were out and so we just we just followed
[1:15:13] our parents
[1:15:15] and then we started looking for churches
[1:15:17] to go to we went through so many
[1:15:19] different denominations
[1:15:22] and none of them it just it just it just
[1:15:26] did not sit in our minds it it there was
[1:15:29] just something wrong and it just did not
[1:15:31] satisfy us and that we we were
[1:15:34] um we were very uh
[1:15:38] unsettled
[1:15:39] with every church that we went to and we
[1:15:42] went to many of them out of state
[1:15:43] friends were like you know after we left
[1:15:46] we had many friends out uh in in in in
[1:15:49] in different denominations they were
[1:15:51] like oh well why don't you come to my
[1:15:52] church you know they were so excited
[1:15:53] like come join us you know so we went to
[1:15:55] so many different churches
[1:15:57] and none of them
[1:15:59] uh just it it just wasn't right and so
[1:16:04] um then uh brother Matt Morse which is
[1:16:09] uh use was my former Pastor uh he
[1:16:14] pastors a church there in Arkansas
[1:16:16] and that's actually where my family's at
[1:16:18] right now
[1:16:20] um so he started uh we were very good
[1:16:23] friends with him and so he he started
[1:16:26] coming up and having holding a Sunday
[1:16:28] service with us
[1:16:30] and he would just preach to the family
[1:16:31] and so we had a little church Gathering
[1:16:34] there and he would not mention the name
[1:16:36] William Branham but he would he would um
[1:16:39] and it I uh he has he has a very deep
[1:16:43] burden for touching people you know
[1:16:47] outside and so he has this very unique
[1:16:50] way of of preaching
[1:16:54] this message without using Brother
[1:16:56] random which I I I I I've heard so so
[1:16:59] many ministers do that so I'm not just
[1:17:00] pointing towards him but uh what I'm
[1:17:02] saying is just he's he was really good
[1:17:04] at that and so he uh he would be
[1:17:07] um uh you know he he'd be bringing the
[1:17:10] message and he's for some reason it was
[1:17:12] just there was something about it my dad
[1:17:14] was like that's so powerful that's such
[1:17:15] a you know that's such a powerful
[1:17:17] thought and so he he really had great
[1:17:19] respect for brother Matt and finally
[1:17:24] um
[1:17:25] his Uncle David Morse uh was holding
[1:17:28] special meetings
[1:17:30] and so brother Matt was like well why
[1:17:31] don't you come down and
[1:17:33] and
[1:17:34] um visit our church and so we were like
[1:17:36] sure
[1:17:37] that was the very first message church
[1:17:39] we ever went to very first and at that
[1:17:42] point we didn't know it was a message
[1:17:43] church but uh that was the first one
[1:17:46] and we liked it it was something about
[1:17:49] the church so it it it was just it just
[1:17:52] sat right it was just something about it
[1:17:53] that's what we're looking for we didn't
[1:17:55] know it at the time
[1:17:56] but you know there there's a reason that
[1:17:58] it says in the scriptures
[1:18:01] where the carcasses the Eagles will be
[1:18:03] gathered
[1:18:04] and so at the time we didn't know
[1:18:07] why but it just that that was right and
[1:18:11] so
[1:18:13] so then we got introduced to the brother
[1:18:15] random to all the tapes from Brother
[1:18:17] random
[1:18:19] and for some reason I just never had a
[1:18:22] question about it when I listened to
[1:18:23] that very first message well I I I have
[1:18:26] to go back to this what actually got me
[1:18:29] in
[1:18:30] and and convinced that the prophet was
[1:18:34] uh you know that brother random was a
[1:18:38] prophet in our day
[1:18:40] um
[1:18:41] uh was one afternoon when we got
[1:18:45] introduced to it
[1:18:46] my dad was sitting in the living room
[1:18:48] with his computer and my mom was sitting
[1:18:50] there too and they were looking at a
[1:18:52] video of brother Branham in the
[1:18:55] discernment line in the prayer line
[1:18:58] and I walk in
[1:19:00] and I looked at that and I was like I my
[1:19:03] mom and dad were just sitting there
[1:19:04] watching that they were very into it I
[1:19:06] noticed that I was like
[1:19:08] and that woman started crying he was
[1:19:10] talking to the woman pointing and she
[1:19:11] just started crying I was like wow that
[1:19:13] woman's putting on a good show and my
[1:19:15] dad was like no that's real I was like
[1:19:17] okay
[1:19:18] what did I just do so I just looked at
[1:19:20] it for a little bit longer and I was
[1:19:21] like after that it just it just clicked
[1:19:23] I was like okay that was it so as soon
[1:19:25] as I listened to an actual message from
[1:19:27] brother Brandon I was like wow so after
[1:19:29] that it was just like that's absolute I
[1:19:31] just never it it it it it it it there
[1:19:35] was no longer a question in my mind and
[1:19:36] then it um the the Revelation just
[1:19:40] struck me which a few years later I was
[1:19:43] struggling with that for a while but a
[1:19:45] few years later
[1:19:46] um another brother uh helped me with
[1:19:49] that to understand that these messages
[1:19:51] these recorded tapes uh
[1:19:55] all these messages that brother Brandon
[1:19:57] preached is basically the word of God
[1:19:59] revealed so it's not that we can
[1:20:02] separate these messages from the word of
[1:20:04] God it was just uh a greater revelation
[1:20:07] of what the word is actually talking
[1:20:08] about and without that I mean how would
[1:20:11] we really uh just personally for myself
[1:20:14] if it if it wasn't it if it wasn't for
[1:20:17] the message it'd be very hard for me to
[1:20:19] to be able to understand what the word
[1:20:21] is truly saying there's so many things
[1:20:23] that brother around me even says that
[1:20:25] I'm still hard to understand but you
[1:20:27] know we don't
[1:20:29] we don't understand it but we believe it
[1:20:31] you know
[1:20:32] and so
[1:20:33] so it it it it was just after Brandon uh
[1:20:38] you know the message wasn't introduced
[1:20:40] to us there was no question about it
[1:20:41] anymore we we
[1:20:43] um we we we we we we've been following
[1:20:47] the message ever since then that was the
[1:20:48] turning point and and then
[1:20:52] um
[1:20:54] we we were in the message for
[1:20:58] five or six years at least
[1:21:02] and with no church to go through to go
[1:21:05] to we we would live stream a church in
[1:21:07] South Carolina
[1:21:09] and uh finally brother Matt had it was
[1:21:14] laid on his heart to to
[1:21:17] start a church in BlackRock and to Black
[1:21:20] in in Black Rock Arkansas and so he did
[1:21:23] and uh that was about four years ago
[1:21:26] and he invited us to come and of course
[1:21:29] we've been in the message already uh for
[1:21:31] for a few years at that point so yeah
[1:21:34] um and I was like yeah you know that's
[1:21:35] uh from where we were living to there
[1:21:37] was six hours it was like we don't have
[1:21:39] that far to move we'll just move down
[1:21:41] there we can have that as our home
[1:21:43] church and that was our very first
[1:21:45] message church that we could actually
[1:21:46] call home
[1:21:48] and
[1:21:49] and we moved down there
[1:21:52] and um
[1:21:57] and
[1:22:00] I'm I'm I'm I'm getting a little ahead
[1:22:03] of myself I I want to back up to say
[1:22:05] this I
[1:22:07] I got baptized
[1:22:10] and
[1:22:13] I was searching and longing
[1:22:16] for the Holy Spirit
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:22] one evening after this is why we were
[1:22:25] live streaming uh the church in South
[1:22:28] Carolina
[1:22:29] uh one evening it was after Wednesday
[1:22:31] night's service there was an altar call
[1:22:33] and there were just I mean almost every
[1:22:35] person that church was up there the
[1:22:36] Elder praying and something just hit my
[1:22:38] heart I just I was like Lord I just want
[1:22:40] to be right
[1:22:42] and
[1:22:43] so that night I went up to my bedroom
[1:22:45] that was just a burden and I just
[1:22:47] couldn't help it I went up to my bedroom
[1:22:48] and I just cried for a full hour
[1:22:51] I felt like the worst sinner ever
[1:22:54] but
[1:22:55] at the end of it
[1:22:57] the Sleep presence just came over me and
[1:23:00] I knew
[1:23:01] and it is it was an experience that I
[1:23:03] cannot explain what I was experiencing
[1:23:05] at that full in that full hour
[1:23:07] but it changed something changed in me
[1:23:10] at that point and
[1:23:12] I'm gonna say
[1:23:14] since I've received the Holy Spirit from
[1:23:16] that point
[1:23:18] life has not been easy has not been easy
[1:23:20] at all it has been many many battles
[1:23:23] along the way but it has also been
[1:23:26] uh many years of molding
[1:23:31] many flaws and habits bad habits and
[1:23:35] things in my life that does not serve me
[1:23:38] in my relationship with the Lord
[1:23:40] and it's
[1:23:42] it's
[1:23:43] just like
[1:23:46] um
[1:23:48] the scripture says I I can't call it now
[1:23:52] exactly where I was but God led a
[1:23:55] prophet down through The Potter's House
[1:23:56] to show him
[1:23:59] how the Potter will take a piece of clay
[1:24:01] and mold it
[1:24:04] and
[1:24:06] I've learned that that's our
[1:24:08] that's our life we have a purpose here
[1:24:10] and it's he's molding us into that
[1:24:13] perfect that Perfect Image that he has
[1:24:16] of us
[1:24:17] and that has been that has been
[1:24:21] my the the the the the the process in my
[1:24:25] life
[1:24:26] and
[1:24:28] um
[1:24:30] and then since since we've been in
[1:24:32] Arkansas
[1:24:33] we've been there for about four years
[1:24:37] and back when I was 16 after we had left
[1:24:41] the Amish we we left out the damage when
[1:24:45] I was uh
[1:24:46] uh almost 15 years old and at the age of
[1:24:49] 16 I just had this something in my heart
[1:24:52] that I just I felt like
[1:24:54] I wanted to be a speaker I wasn't
[1:24:57] thinking about preaching but I wanted to
[1:24:58] be a speaker of some kind I wanted to be
[1:25:00] a blessing to the people
[1:25:02] I didn't have an education I don't have
[1:25:04] very much of an education at all
[1:25:06] but I I I I I I I I I I I wanted to be a
[1:25:10] speaker I longed to be before people and
[1:25:13] to help people I wanted to see something
[1:25:15] that would be a blessing to people
[1:25:17] and that just kept going in my mind on
[1:25:19] and on all the way up till uh we went to
[1:25:24] Brother Mass church
[1:25:25] and so finally I told Brother Matt I
[1:25:28] just I I feel like I feel like I'm
[1:25:31] called to breach and of course he didn't
[1:25:33] take that lightly and he didn't take me
[1:25:35] seriously
[1:25:36] um
[1:25:37] so
[1:25:38] I had to I had to come back to him a few
[1:25:41] times and finally finally
[1:25:44] um one evening it was like okay
[1:25:46] well you want to take the Wednesday
[1:25:47] night service I was like sure
[1:25:50] and
[1:25:54] um of course being as nervous as I was
[1:25:56] and trying to stay with my notes I I
[1:25:59] have to say I was kind of unsatisfied
[1:26:01] with that with my first message
[1:26:03] but it it it was a start and we have we
[1:26:07] all start somewhere
[1:26:08] uh
[1:26:11] and then
[1:26:18] um about less than a year later
[1:26:23] I have to back that up
[1:26:27] it was
[1:26:28] before I actually started preaching
[1:26:33] um
[1:26:37] of course being new new in that church
[1:26:40] yet and we had many many great friends
[1:26:42] in that church people wanted to help us
[1:26:44] and uh
[1:26:46] uh and so you know I wasn't I didn't
[1:26:51] have uh I was not in a relationship with
[1:26:55] any girl and so many of the friends down
[1:26:57] have friends down there thought that you
[1:27:00] know that
[1:27:01] they should find somebody for me and I
[1:27:04] did not ask them to but
[1:27:06] I I kind of felt like I have the right
[1:27:08] to make up my own mind here but anyway
[1:27:10] unfortunately
[1:27:12] um
[1:27:13] we had special meetings there in
[1:27:15] Arkansas
[1:27:16] and uh
[1:27:19] um
[1:27:20] many of you might know know the rent the
[1:27:23] Reynolds
[1:27:24] family there in Arkansas but anyway
[1:27:27] they're very good friends with
[1:27:29] um uh
[1:27:32] brother Bryce and his family
[1:27:34] and so
[1:27:36] Sarah
[1:27:38] um of course not knowing anybody either
[1:27:42] um
[1:27:43] sister Haven which was a very good
[1:27:45] friend of Sarah's
[1:27:47] thought that it might be a good idea to
[1:27:49] get us together
[1:27:50] and of course me being a strange fellow
[1:27:54] that I am I didn't think it was a good
[1:27:55] idea
[1:27:56] so when I caught wind that this was
[1:27:59] taking place I did my best to avoid her
[1:28:03] but at the cafeteria after service that
[1:28:07] night this was on a Friday night after
[1:28:10] service
[1:28:12] I immediately went out it was dark
[1:28:14] outside so nobody could see me so I went
[1:28:16] out in the dark I was out there by the
[1:28:18] vehicles and my brother Joe comes out
[1:28:20] and he's like hey Haven's looking for it
[1:28:22] and I was like oh yeah she is I was like
[1:28:23] she was like he was like yeah she's
[1:28:26] looking for you and she she wants you to
[1:28:27] come up and I was like yeah no I don't
[1:28:30] think I will just tell my brothers to
[1:28:31] come we're leaving and so we left church
[1:28:34] and we go over to the to the uh
[1:28:38] cafeteria where uh where they were
[1:28:40] serving food
[1:28:41] and in the food line
[1:28:43] I see brother Joe and Haven but I didn't
[1:28:46] see Sarah and
[1:28:48] and so brother Drew was like come over
[1:28:50] here and so I was like okay
[1:28:52] um so and then he he I come over there
[1:28:55] and he's like I want to introduce you to
[1:28:58] a very good friend of mine
[1:29:00] and that was Haven I mean uh Sarah's
[1:29:03] standing in front of those two and
[1:29:07] and so she turns around with a big old
[1:29:10] smile on her face you know and she was
[1:29:11] shy and I was shy and I didn't want to
[1:29:13] talk to her and and so
[1:29:15] uh
[1:29:17] and so I shook her hand with a big smile
[1:29:19] and and then he was trying to
[1:29:21] keep the conversation going but I didn't
[1:29:23] say anything and she didn't say anything
[1:29:26] so
[1:29:27] so finally I just shook my head and I
[1:29:30] said
[1:29:31] that's what I told brother Joe I said I
[1:29:33] gotta go find myself and I went outside
[1:29:39] and and so I did not say anything for
[1:29:43] the rest of that evening
[1:29:45] to her I did not even look at Sarah I
[1:29:48] did not want anything to do with her I
[1:29:49] was perfectly fine making new friends
[1:29:51] there were a whole bunch of young boys
[1:29:52] there so I was out just having a good
[1:29:54] time
[1:29:55] and I was my evening was going really
[1:29:57] really well but then I was actually
[1:29:59] talking with Haven's fiance they were
[1:30:01] not married yet they were engaged
[1:30:04] I was talking with him
[1:30:06] brother Ben Lovell
[1:30:08] and
[1:30:11] and Haven walks over there and she was
[1:30:13] kind of sad I could tell she seemed kind
[1:30:14] of upset she didn't she she didn't make
[1:30:18] eye contact with me directly and she
[1:30:20] didn't smile either
[1:30:22] um and then she told Ben it's time to go
[1:30:23] so I was like okay yeah you gotta go
[1:30:25] ahead and
[1:30:27] that night on the way home it something
[1:30:30] just struck me I was like
[1:30:32] what did I do wrong Lord I felt like I
[1:30:35] was living in such a world of
[1:30:36] condemnation I was like what in the
[1:30:39] world did I do I I it it didn't make
[1:30:43] sense
[1:30:44] and then
[1:30:46] but I was feeling so bad because I had
[1:30:48] turned my back on Sarah I I I was
[1:30:51] feeling horrible about that I was like I
[1:30:54] just I couldn't get it on my mind after
[1:30:56] I left the cafeteria going home it was
[1:30:57] just it was such a heavy burden in my
[1:30:59] heart I was like I I I I I I I I felt
[1:31:03] like the worst sinner ever and so
[1:31:06] the next day the burden kept getting
[1:31:08] worse and worse and then that was on
[1:31:10] Saturday so the whole church was
[1:31:12] gathered at a campground and we were
[1:31:14] playing volleyball and having a good
[1:31:15] time and but I wasn't having a good time
[1:31:17] I felt like crying and so
[1:31:20] I uh at that point I just wanted to
[1:31:23] apologize to Sarah for turning my back
[1:31:24] on her and then leave her alone I don't
[1:31:26] want anything to do with her but I just
[1:31:28] want to tell her that I'm sorry I felt
[1:31:31] so bad that I did that to her the night
[1:31:32] before I felt like a disrespected lady
[1:31:34] and so
[1:31:36] but that didn't happen I never got that
[1:31:37] opportunity and that night
[1:31:40] in church service I was at that point I
[1:31:43] was feeling so horrible that I could not
[1:31:45] even focus on the ministering of the
[1:31:47] word on the entire message I was feeling
[1:31:50] horrible
[1:31:51] and
[1:31:54] and so finally at the end of the service
[1:31:56] the spirit of God was just moving in the
[1:31:58] building and people were coming up to
[1:31:59] the Altar and I finally just raised my
[1:32:01] hand I said Lord
[1:32:03] I will talk to her tonight if you will
[1:32:05] just take this burden from me
[1:32:09] and immediately as I said that
[1:32:12] I heard a clear Audible Voice
[1:32:16] that said
[1:32:18] don't turn your back on the one I send
[1:32:23] and as soon as I heard that
[1:32:27] I immediately flipped from not wanting
[1:32:29] to get married to I knew this was the
[1:32:32] girl I'm going to marry
[1:32:35] and she didn't know that of course not
[1:32:37] and so
[1:32:38] through our entire relationship I felt
[1:32:40] like I was walking on thin ice because I
[1:32:42] didn't want to you know shy her away I
[1:32:45] had to be very very careful not to you
[1:32:47] know mistreat her in any way
[1:32:49] um
[1:32:50] and
[1:32:52] but it it and I I I did not tell her
[1:32:55] what happened until we were engaged I I
[1:32:59] was very careful with who I shared the
[1:33:00] story with because I did not want to use
[1:33:03] it as an advantage
[1:33:04] of convincing her that she's the one uh
[1:33:08] and I don't take this story very lightly
[1:33:10] it it it it it it was very it was very
[1:33:12] special and very special experience to
[1:33:15] me and that was that was the the turning
[1:33:19] point for me before that I have to be
[1:33:22] clear I did not want to get married at
[1:33:23] all
[1:33:25] um
[1:33:26] and so that was going through my mind I
[1:33:29] was I I I was just going to grow up to
[1:33:31] be a bachelor and single I'm good
[1:33:34] and so but that night it it all flipped
[1:33:37] for me and so
[1:33:39] then during our our relationship I I
[1:33:42] started preaching
[1:33:43] and
[1:33:45] um
[1:33:46] and then of course
[1:33:48] we come to a point where we wanted to
[1:33:50] get married
[1:33:51] a year later
[1:33:54] and
[1:33:56] then I decide well if we're getting
[1:33:58] married I'll move to Oklahoma
[1:34:00] and my did that not it did not sit with
[1:34:03] my pastor or my family
[1:34:04] it was it was quite a quite a hard
[1:34:07] decision to make but
[1:34:10] when I tend to make decisions I stick
[1:34:13] with them and so
[1:34:14] uh though I had a lot of objection on
[1:34:17] either side I did it anyway
[1:34:19] and
[1:34:20] uh I had this
[1:34:24] I had this burden on my heart to help
[1:34:27] Brother Rice in in his church there in
[1:34:31] Claremore and I I uh he you know he's
[1:34:35] he's he's pastoring alone and and he
[1:34:38] takes almost every Sunday and Wednesday
[1:34:40] service alone he's he's doing uh it's
[1:34:43] it's it's a big load on him and plus
[1:34:45] he's he's working sometimes as well and
[1:34:49] it was on the heart that you know
[1:34:51] I just want to be a blessing to him in
[1:34:53] his little church and and so I'm I'm I
[1:34:56] moved out there for that reason and and
[1:34:58] I I've been helping him out uh here and
[1:35:01] there and and
[1:35:03] um
[1:35:05] uh
[1:35:06] that has been
[1:35:10] that that has been my
[1:35:15] my desire through
[1:35:20] um I have to say since
[1:35:22] in
[1:35:23] from my growing up years up until now
[1:35:26] having the
[1:35:27] uh
[1:35:29] you know the problems that have been
[1:35:30] dyslexic and hard of learning and all
[1:35:33] that not any much of an education at all
[1:35:37] it I have a soft spot for people like
[1:35:41] that it's like
[1:35:43] whenever I see a person who's uh has
[1:35:46] some type of an issue it's just it's
[1:35:48] just it just hits me like I I just have
[1:35:51] a burden for people like that just
[1:35:53] because I've
[1:35:54] I I I I've been there and I know how it
[1:35:57] feels like but I I I I I believe that it
[1:36:01] has it has it turns out it has been a
[1:36:04] blessing
[1:36:05] because it gives me a greater burden
[1:36:07] to help people like that indeed and I
[1:36:09] have an opportunity to do that
[1:36:11] and uh I'm able to touch people where
[1:36:16] where I couldn't if I hadn't gone
[1:36:18] through the things I've been through and
[1:36:20] so
[1:36:21] um
[1:36:24] it's so
[1:36:25] I've
[1:36:27] wanted it wanted to make this my purpose
[1:36:30] in this life and I've I've I've I've I
[1:36:32] believe this should be the purpose of
[1:36:34] every Christian
[1:36:36] I I wanted to share this little story
[1:36:38] too it just come to my mind actually
[1:36:40] while I was in Florida one time
[1:36:44] uh the whole family was there and my
[1:36:46] older brother
[1:36:47] he was a great influence to me
[1:36:50] but he moved to South Carolina to the
[1:36:53] church that we were live streaming
[1:36:55] and
[1:36:57] he
[1:37:00] he he wanted a message church at that
[1:37:03] point we weren't going to any message
[1:37:04] church so he wanted to go to a message
[1:37:05] church so he moved down there and for
[1:37:07] some reason it just didn't work out for
[1:37:09] the rest of the family to move we wanted
[1:37:11] to but it just didn't there were too
[1:37:12] many complications it just didn't work
[1:37:14] out and so we finally just decided Well
[1:37:17] it's just not the will of the Lord for
[1:37:18] us to do so the Samuel moved my older
[1:37:21] brother Samuel moved down there anyway
[1:37:23] and uh though he wants to admit it or
[1:37:26] not I know he was looking for a girl so
[1:37:28] you know that's a good reason to move
[1:37:30] um
[1:37:31] uh anyway he he got married and now I
[1:37:34] get to enjoy his little his little son
[1:37:37] whenever I get to see him cute little
[1:37:39] fella too
[1:37:41] um
[1:37:42] anyway
[1:37:43] we were in Florida and Samuel I was
[1:37:46] dealing with depression suicidal issues
[1:37:49] at that point and Samuel told me
[1:37:51] something that always stuck to me
[1:37:53] I was like what's my purpose I just want
[1:37:55] a purpose I want something to do I I I
[1:37:58] want to make a difference I can't just
[1:38:00] go through this life
[1:38:01] working a job going home doing nothing
[1:38:05] and just repeat this cycle all over
[1:38:07] again I have to have something that I
[1:38:09] can do I want to make a difference for
[1:38:10] people
[1:38:11] and Samuel was like you know the
[1:38:13] greatest purpose you have in this life
[1:38:15] is to serve the Lord
[1:38:17] and that just
[1:38:19] stuck with me it just it it hit a little
[1:38:22] differently that time and I got to
[1:38:23] thinking about that statement the
[1:38:26] greatest purpose we have is to serve the
[1:38:27] Lord and yes it is the greatest purpose
[1:38:30] we have in this life but and this
[1:38:33] purpose that we have every single
[1:38:35] individual it can Branch out a little
[1:38:39] bit differently for some it is preaching
[1:38:41] that is their that is their the the the
[1:38:43] the way that they serve the Lord for
[1:38:45] others it is
[1:38:46] um you know just being a just living a
[1:38:49] clean pure holy life on the street
[1:38:50] you're still preaching a message to
[1:38:52] people whatever it is everybody it can
[1:38:55] Branch out a little bit differently to
[1:38:56] every individual but still we have that
[1:38:58] one purpose and that is to serve the
[1:39:00] Lord
[1:39:01] and so uh cut uh coming down to a close
[1:39:06] I just wanted to make this statement
[1:39:08] that always stuck with me our purpose is
[1:39:12] to serve the Lord
[1:39:13] and to keep our lights shining in this
[1:39:16] wicked Dark Age that we live in
[1:39:20] and while
[1:39:23] I was studying one day
[1:39:26] I uh came across the scripture and it
[1:39:30] just really hit my heart
[1:39:33] and it is
[1:39:36] it it it just could caught my attention
[1:39:40] and my my my my Bible here has a title
[1:39:44] for every every uh topic and or or or
[1:39:49] the verses that uh whatever the verses
[1:39:51] are talking about it has a small title
[1:39:53] for that and it just hit me when it said
[1:39:54] oil for the lamps and I was I started
[1:39:57] studying on that and that's where it
[1:39:58] really where it really stuck with me
[1:40:00] that
[1:40:02] um
[1:40:02] you know we are the spiritual Seed of
[1:40:05] Abraham
[1:40:06] and just as it was in the natural Seed
[1:40:09] of Abraham it was commanded of them
[1:40:13] that they bring unto Aaron
[1:40:15] a pure oil
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:18] beaten for the light it had to be a pure
[1:40:22] oil and a olive that was beaten so it
[1:40:25] was basically this is not going to be an
[1:40:27] easy task either
[1:40:29] to bring this oil but it was a command
[1:40:31] so they had to beat this oil out of this
[1:40:34] Olive and it was not it it it it it it
[1:40:37] it was not an easy task to be able to do
[1:40:40] that but they had to do this continually
[1:40:42] and that's what I want to stress on
[1:40:44] tonight is the fact that
[1:40:46] be in the spiritual seat of Abraham that
[1:40:49] is required of us too it is a law to our
[1:40:51] generation that we have to continually
[1:40:55] keep before the Lord we have to how do
[1:40:57] we produce this well how do we get this
[1:40:59] oil we get it by reading the word this
[1:41:01] is where the oil comes from because as
[1:41:03] the prophet said
[1:41:05] as the prophet said that the oil
[1:41:08] symbolizes the Holy Spirit Well what is
[1:41:10] the holy spirit it is the word of God
[1:41:12] and and Jesus said that he would never
[1:41:14] leave us comfortless but he would send a
[1:41:16] comforter to us and in order to keep
[1:41:19] feeding that keep feeding the fire of
[1:41:21] God the oil to keep it lit because when
[1:41:25] you receive that fire when you receive
[1:41:26] the Holy Spirit and you receive the fire
[1:41:28] of God in your heart
[1:41:29] it can go out if you don't feed it if
[1:41:32] you don't continue to beat that Olive
[1:41:34] and you keep feeding on the word and if
[1:41:36] you don't continue to keep before the
[1:41:38] Lord in prayer and yes I know it gets
[1:41:39] hard so many times for us because
[1:41:42] in this wicked world that we live in
[1:41:44] it's dark and we have demons just like
[1:41:46] uh Brother Davis said this morning a 200
[1:41:49] 000 demons it is not easy to get down to
[1:41:51] our knees and pray sometimes it is not
[1:41:52] easy to sit down to read the word
[1:41:54] because we have so much to do there's
[1:41:56] all this work that needs to be done and
[1:41:58] and uh schedule I mean we have so our
[1:42:01] schedule is booked we have so many
[1:42:02] things that we need to meet we have all
[1:42:04] you know we have uh friends so we got to
[1:42:06] help and and just everything that we
[1:42:08] have to do so it is it is not an easy
[1:42:11] task but it is important that we keep
[1:42:13] beating we keep producing that oil from
[1:42:16] the word of God and continue in prayer
[1:42:20] and that produces the oil to keep that
[1:42:22] lamp burning and if you notice it has to
[1:42:25] be on a pure Candlestick a pure
[1:42:28] lampstand not just any lampstand but how
[1:42:30] is our lampstand tonight I'll repair
[1:42:32] before the Lord it is a very sobering
[1:42:34] thought to think about that what if what
[1:42:36] is our heart like tonight that heart
[1:42:38] that is where the light is burning
[1:42:40] continually and from the heart is where
[1:42:42] where everything that we do in our daily
[1:42:45] lives
[1:42:46] flows out from the heart what your
[1:42:48] actions is in your natural life will
[1:42:50] show what is inside your heart
[1:42:53] so is is is our lampstand is it pure is
[1:42:57] it pure enough to be able that the fire
[1:42:59] of God can actually burn on top of that
[1:43:02] landstand and from the lampstand I I I I
[1:43:06] I love how the prophet explained that so
[1:43:08] beautifully he said
[1:43:09] that in this lab stand the lamp sits the
[1:43:13] top of the lamp stand and there's a wick
[1:43:15] that hangs down into the oil and it
[1:43:18] burns from the oil so it sucks the oil
[1:43:20] up through that Wick and then it burns
[1:43:22] on top of that and so we it it is
[1:43:24] important that we constantly keep that
[1:43:26] oil there or the fire will go out and I
[1:43:29] uh and I'm just going to end with this
[1:43:32] quote right here how the prophet said I
[1:43:34] love it so much in in in 1953 uh
[1:43:38] Witnesses is it is the title of this
[1:43:41] message
[1:43:42] he said but brother let your light shine
[1:43:45] in the darkest places where it is really
[1:43:47] needed out in the hedges and the
[1:43:49] highways
[1:43:50] in the bar rooms out down the street
[1:43:53] everywhere you're at let your light
[1:43:55] shine as a witness and I love that that
[1:43:59] is so beautifully said because in this
[1:44:00] day and age the the thing that we need
[1:44:03] the most is for our light to shine and
[1:44:05] it is very critical and it is not as we
[1:44:09] are the spiritual Seed of Abraham it is
[1:44:11] a law in Our Generations that we keep
[1:44:15] producing that lamp that oil continually
[1:44:17] it is it is not just a it is not just a
[1:44:20] whether you feel like producing this oil
[1:44:22] if you notice it was a command it was
[1:44:24] not just well today I'm busy so maybe
[1:44:27] tomorrow
[1:44:28] maybe next week or well I don't feel so
[1:44:31] good today I'm kind of sick I'll I'll
[1:44:33] just take the day off and maybe watch a
[1:44:35] movie
[1:44:36] uh maybe tomorrow we'll we'll I'll I'll
[1:44:39] I'll read my Bible I kind of feel like
[1:44:41] maybe tomorrow might be a better day for
[1:44:42] me
[1:44:44] that's not what God said it was a
[1:44:46] command whether you feel like it or not
[1:44:48] whether you have time for it or not it
[1:44:50] doesn't matter what you're going through
[1:44:52] this is a requirement that we constantly
[1:44:55] keep feeding on the word of God and
[1:44:57] producing that oil to keep that light
[1:44:59] burning because if you don't feed on the
[1:45:00] word of God and you don't keep in prayer
[1:45:03] that like that fire will go out the uh
[1:45:06] the fire of God cannot live and cannot
[1:45:09] survive without oil it just cannot so
[1:45:14] um
[1:45:14] I that that was that that was on my
[1:45:18] heart tonight and
[1:45:20] I I I I I'm just going to close and say
[1:45:24] I really
[1:45:25] appreciate this opportunity and I thank
[1:45:28] you all for listening it's a blessing
[1:45:30] being here and I'm just glad that I'm
[1:45:33] have this opportunity to come down and
[1:45:35] and to be a blessing to the church and
[1:45:37] to be able to film this building for you
[1:45:39] all God bless you all
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:53] it's an individual Affair isn't it
[1:45:57] you know
[1:45:58] God
[1:46:00] deals with each of us
[1:46:02] you know and Sarah I know you didn't get
[1:46:05] to tell your side of the story
[1:46:08] but uh
[1:46:10] uh you can tell me your side of the
[1:46:14] story and I'll relay it to everybody for
[1:46:18] you but you know I I appreciate what we
[1:46:22] heard
[1:46:24] because I know that within the framework
[1:46:27] of it
[1:46:28] you could all relate
[1:46:30] to the troubles you went through the
[1:46:32] Mind battles
[1:46:34] you had the
[1:46:36] the
[1:46:37] insufficiencies you felt
[1:46:40] but he never forsook you amen that's
[1:46:43] right you know he brought you
[1:46:46] through it all
[1:46:47] because he made a promise a long time
[1:46:49] ago that nothing could pluck you
[1:46:52] from the palm
[1:46:55] his hand
[1:46:57] and and he'll always remain that way and
[1:47:01] it's it and we always just trust that
[1:47:04] that hunger
[1:47:06] brother prophet of God said that draw
[1:47:08] what what you're drawing in you know he
[1:47:12] said that's that's what determines
[1:47:15] whether you have the light what you what
[1:47:17] do you want to pull into your life
[1:47:20] what do you want to pull into your life
[1:47:22] even Corinthos our brother said uh his
[1:47:25] problem of being
[1:47:28] the lexic
[1:47:29] stutters a little all those complexes
[1:47:32] that had was no excuse
[1:47:36] he didn't use it as an excuse
[1:47:39] because what was hungering on the inside
[1:47:43] and if you can connect with that deep
[1:47:48] calling to the deep that deep will
[1:47:51] always respond
[1:47:53] it'll always be there to get you through
[1:47:56] your complex to get you through your
[1:47:58] doubt
[1:47:59] to get you through the the times that
[1:48:04] you feel like you're different and that
[1:48:06] you're alone and that you're separated
[1:48:09] and you're going through all this inner
[1:48:11] turmoil
[1:48:12] he's still there
[1:48:14] and he promised I'll never leave you in
[1:48:17] fact we know for a fact that it's
[1:48:20] through those times that he's there the
[1:48:22] most amen oh yes when you think he's the
[1:48:24] farthest away
[1:48:26] he's really the closest amen
[1:48:29] um
[1:48:31] you know I I thought of something I had
[1:48:34] an opportunity to visit with a a young
[1:48:38] man the other day in it
[1:48:40] It's a Wonderful testimony
[1:48:45] um me and Leslie had went to visit and
[1:48:47] we walked into the house and
[1:48:51] and I I I guess we all packed a presence
[1:48:55] with us I hope the presence we pack is
[1:48:58] the presence of the Lord amen that you
[1:49:01] make could make a difference in the
[1:49:03] atmosphere I was talking about uh how
[1:49:07] brother Andrew the other day just his
[1:49:09] approach and he changed the atmosphere
[1:49:13] you know what I mean and it it makes a
[1:49:16] difference you we don't know why but
[1:49:19] certain people just have that ability
[1:49:21] you know I've never had the ability to
[1:49:24] make a good first impression you know
[1:49:27] what I mean but after I finally win a
[1:49:31] friend we're friends for life you know I
[1:49:33] have very few but uh it's something that
[1:49:36] ability to understand that you you can
[1:49:39] just your presence your attitude
[1:49:41] can can make a difference in
[1:49:44] and uh you know when when I uh
[1:49:50] sometimes when I'm not feeling well
[1:49:53] there's certain Brothers I'll call to
[1:49:55] pray for me because for some reason God
[1:49:58] hears their
[1:50:00] prayer you know I mean it makes a
[1:50:02] difference so we need one another but we
[1:50:05] walked into this house and this young
[1:50:07] man
[1:50:08] was there and he said you know the
[1:50:10] minute you walked in the door I felt a
[1:50:14] feeling all over me that I needed to be
[1:50:17] baptized
[1:50:21] and
[1:50:22] so first of all he was wondering what
[1:50:24] was that
[1:50:26] you know
[1:50:28] and I said well you know it it was just
[1:50:32] the Lord it just the time you know
[1:50:35] and
[1:50:37] and it's such a human response but he
[1:50:41] wanted to
[1:50:43] I said God told you to be to be baptized
[1:50:46] they said
[1:50:47] do it
[1:50:49] obey it
[1:50:51] and and of course he thought well my
[1:50:53] life's not right
[1:50:55] you know what I mean there's things I'm
[1:50:57] doing I'm not I'm not living for God I
[1:51:00] don't I'm not believing the way that I
[1:51:02] should and I said you know you don't get
[1:51:06] well before you take the medicine that's
[1:51:09] right amen
[1:51:10] that's true you know what I mean and so
[1:51:13] many people want to do that they want to
[1:51:16] get well
[1:51:17] before they take the medicine they want
[1:51:19] to get right before they get baptized
[1:51:21] they want to try to clean their house
[1:51:23] before they give their heart to the lord
[1:51:26] it's never about that it's like our
[1:51:29] brother said I command you
[1:51:31] oh yeah amen so when he speaks move
[1:51:35] you know what I mean when he talks your
[1:51:37] heart act upon it
[1:51:39] just let it just put it into his hands
[1:51:44] and he'll do it and uh
[1:51:48] I know what it's like when God sends you
[1:51:50] somebody so I know that part of your
[1:51:53] testimony really well you know I had
[1:51:57] someone call me
[1:51:59] on the phone
[1:52:00] and very strange but we've had 50 some
[1:52:05] years together so I believe it was the
[1:52:08] Lord amen so I I trust you feel
[1:52:11] something in your heart tonight that you
[1:52:13] feel that that God's with you
[1:52:17] and no matter what you think your
[1:52:19] circumstance is the footsteps of the
[1:52:22] righteous are still ordered by the Lord
[1:52:23] that's right amen and he's determined
[1:52:26] not to lose a one amen and he'll get you
[1:52:30] who you have need of having he'll
[1:52:32] provide for your life he'll take care of
[1:52:35] you put God first amen and all also be
[1:52:38] added unto you God bless you let's stand
[1:52:41] this evening
[1:52:43] that's which y'all
[1:52:46] pray for
[1:52:49] Adam and I guess they call you little
[1:52:52] Amos because you're a junior right yeah
[1:52:55] okay so we uh asked y'all just to keep
[1:52:59] them in prayer it's been extremely hot
[1:53:03] and they're all the way up in the top of
[1:53:05] that attic and it's about 107 probably
[1:53:11] 112 or 14 degrees up there
[1:53:15] and then when he sprays his gun
[1:53:18] that phone comes out of there at about
[1:53:22] 128 degrees
[1:53:24] so it hits there that chemical is
[1:53:28] you know poofing out and it's really hot
[1:53:32] and uh so if you just pray that God
[1:53:35] really give them some Supernatural uh
[1:53:40] strength and and just really make it go
[1:53:43] well
[1:53:44] form and it's quite a sacrifice that
[1:53:48] he's put out on our behalf so don't
[1:53:51] forget him in prayer and I hope you know
[1:53:54] you always have a place here and you'd
[1:53:57] love to have your fellowship with us and
[1:54:00] speak to us again if you love the Lord
