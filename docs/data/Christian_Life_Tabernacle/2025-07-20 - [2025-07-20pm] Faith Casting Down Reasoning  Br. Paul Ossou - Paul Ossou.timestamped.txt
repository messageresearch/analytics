[14:19] Oh, you got me into trouble when Jesus
[14:24] got me down. I can

[23:43] brother David Kaku bring his
[24:12] God bless you all.
[24:15] Um, the song that we just sang is one of
[24:18] my favorites. And uh, I want to thank
[24:21] God because he gave me a song today
[24:25] &gt;&gt; to sing about his goodness
[24:27] because this morning I was meditating
[24:29] upon a scripture, the one our pastor
[24:32] preached upon this morning.
[24:35] So, it's an answered prayer and I'm
[24:39] still believing for more.
[24:42] Uh the song I'm going to sing it's um in
[24:45] Sha and it says
[24:51] which simply means God fulfill
[24:56] uh your word.

[28:05] God bless you.
[28:07] [Applause]
[28:41] God bless you, saints. Amen. Um, just
[28:44] want to share a little testimony before
[28:46] I sing this song.
[28:49] Lately, I've done uh
[28:52] I've done seeing almost all hell break
[28:55] loose. you know, uh, Satan has just been
[28:57] attempting everything he can and he
[29:00] knows, you know, to try to sink my faith
[29:04] to try to just get me a little bit, you
[29:08] know, off of the right path. You know,
[29:11] coming to church, I've seen Satan in the
[29:14] last few three weeks maybe. I've seen
[29:16] fights after fights after fight. You
[29:20] know, at some point it's, you know, it's
[29:22] the sibling that's in the accident. And
[29:24] then later on it's you know it's
[29:26] sickness and then after that you wake up
[29:29] okay it's your car that's not broken and
[29:32] you know everything I've seen all kind
[29:34] of episodes but in the midst of it you
[29:38] know one testimony that I've kept
[29:40] throughout all of that season is
[29:42] you know we underestimate the power God
[29:44] has put in us you know where we had a
[29:48] situation going on our home all we could
[29:50] do is just pray you know you don't even
[29:52] know how to bring it to people it's like
[29:54] how do you ask for a prayer request
[29:56] saying this?
[29:58] But we've seen how faithful God is and
[30:01] it feels like you just start commanding
[30:03] everything around you. You pray about it
[30:05] and you see the thing come to pass and
[30:07] it scares you. It's like did I just ask
[30:10] for this? It sounds ridiculous but you
[30:11] did and God answered the prayer. Um very
[30:15] grateful. You know the devil was really
[30:18] attacking me internally but God has been
[30:20] there. So, I want to sing a song. If you
[30:23] know the song, please help me sing it. I
[30:25] don't know it that good, but I really
[30:28] just been wanting to sing it. So, the
[30:30] song is who I am.
[30:35] [Music]
[30:46] C
[30:51] Oh, glorious victory.
[30:55] That day he set me free
[30:59] and my heart
[31:03] is very thrown.
[31:06] My life's no longer mine. I'm a prisoner
[31:11] of love divine.
[31:14] And now I leave
[31:17] to praise his name.
[31:21] Who I am, Lord,
[31:25] who I am.
[31:29] I can see now
[31:32] who I am.
[31:36] A part of my Savior,
[31:39] a part of his word.
[31:43] It's a revelation
[31:47] of who I am.
[31:51] Who I am, Lord.
[31:55] Who I am.
[31:57] [Music]
[31:59] I can see now
[32:03] who I am.
[32:06] A part of my Savior.
[32:10] A part of his word.
[32:14] It's a revelation
[32:18] predestination
[32:21] of who I am
[32:25] on Calvary.
[32:27] Dine
[32:29] to redeem me very bright. The king of
[32:34] kings
[32:37] became my savior.
[32:41] This is God's great mystery
[32:44] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[32:49] none
[32:52] might be made one.
[32:56] Who I am Lord
[33:00] who I am.
[33:04] I can see now just who I am.
[33:11] A part of my savior,
[33:15] a part of his word.
[33:18] It's a revelation
[33:22] of who I am.
[33:27] Who I am, Lord,
[33:30] who I am.
[33:34] I can see now
[33:38] who I am.
[33:41] A part of my savior,
[33:45] a part of his word.
[33:49] It's a revelation
[33:53] of who I am. God bless you. Amen.
[34:11] We have a prayer request here. Sister
[34:13] April writes, "Please keep me in prayer
[34:15] as I have a medical procedure next
[34:17] week." Thank you all.
[34:21] Hallelujah.
[34:23] We saw what God did for our sister who
[34:25] testified for us on Wednesday. We serve
[34:28] the God of the all the impossibles.
[34:31] Whether he chooses doctor's hands or he
[34:33] chooses a miracle, his power remains the
[34:36] same.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ask brother Jerome to come
[34:39] and take these. And if you had a need on
[34:41] your heart and you want to make it known
[34:43] to him by the uplifting of your hands,
[34:46] please do so. We'll ask the brothers
[34:48] that come in and take the tithes and
[34:49] offerings to please come up.
[34:52] [Music]
[35:02] Let us look to God in prayer.
[35:05] Heavenly Father, we thank you once again
[35:07] for an opportunity to be found in your
[35:09] presence.
[35:11] Lord God, as many requests have gone
[35:14] forth from this altar prayer, you have
[35:16] been faithful over the years, Lord God,
[35:19] and you have answered by fire. We pray
[35:22] even now with the assurity that knows
[35:25] that whatever we ask in prayer believing
[35:27] by faith it shall be done.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; You simply said in your word if we would
[35:32] knock,
[35:34] if we would ask,
[35:37] you would answer. Lord God, I pray and
[35:40] ask in the name of Jesus that you would
[35:41] continue to minister and to move in such
[35:44] a mighty way.
[35:46] I pray for this ministry, Lord God, and
[35:48] those who you have called to minister to
[35:51] the needs of our hearts. I pray and ask
[35:55] even now that you would anoint every
[35:57] speaker that speaks over this pull pit.
[36:00] That you would give him a word of hope
[36:02] and deliverance to lift heavy burdens
[36:04] from the hearts of your people. Lord
[36:07] God, there are those who are in the
[36:09] audience, Lord God, who have been
[36:11] afflicted, Lord God.
[36:14] Oh, and our faith may be too weak, Lord
[36:16] God, to touch the hem of your garment.
[36:20] But we pray even now, Lord God, that you
[36:22] would encourage us and you would
[36:24] strengthen us and that you would
[36:26] increase our faith, Lord God, that we
[36:29] would have the faith to speak to the
[36:31] mountains in our lives and say, "Be thou
[36:34] removed and to be cast into yonder sea,
[36:36] Lord God.
[36:38] Oh Lord, I believe in you, Lord God."
[36:41] But we even pray, Lord God, help me in
[36:45] my unbelief, Lord God, that I will
[36:47] continue to trust you and place all my
[36:50] faith and confidence in you, Lord God. I
[36:53] pray if there's any sick among us
[36:55] tonight, Lord God, I pray that through
[36:57] the preaching of the word, Lord God,
[36:59] that by faith they might be healed. Lord
[37:02] God, if there's one seeking salvation
[37:05] and deliverance from a habit, I pray
[37:08] even now through the foolishness of
[37:10] preaching, Lord God, one might be saved.
[37:13] Lord God, I pray for every family that's
[37:16] assembled here, Lord God. I pray even
[37:19] now that you would begin to watch over
[37:22] us, Lord God. I pray even now that the
[37:25] blood would be applied upon every
[37:28] doorpost that is represented here, Lord
[37:30] God. For I know that if the blood is
[37:33] applied, Lord God, you would pass over,
[37:36] Lord God. I know that if we are your
[37:39] people and we're covered by your blood,
[37:41] Lord God, you would protect us from
[37:43] every disease, Lord God. And the cares
[37:47] and the troubles of this world, even
[37:49] though they might buffet us, they would
[37:51] not overwhelm us, Lord God. If we would
[37:54] walk through the water, Lord God, it
[37:56] would not consume us. If we would go
[37:58] through the fire, it would not consume
[38:00] us even now. We pray and ask in the name
[38:03] of Jesus that you would bless and
[38:06] ministers, Lord God. Heavenly Father,
[38:08] tonight my soul is thirsty and I need a
[38:12] refreshing, Lord God, I pray even now
[38:15] that you would touch the minister heart.
[38:18] even the direction that they've studied
[38:20] and wanted to go. I pray even now that
[38:22] you would speak to their hearts and give
[38:24] them your way, Lord God, that they would
[38:27] hide themselves behind your cross and
[38:30] speak only your word. For we ask and
[38:33] pray in the name of Jesus. We pray a
[38:35] blessing upon the offering tonight. We
[38:37] ask that it may be used for the further
[38:40] of your kingdom. For it's in Jesus holy
[38:43] name we pray. Amen.
[38:47] Hallelujah. As we sing the song, we want
[38:50] to remember these these were special
[38:52] moments. You know, we don't we don't
[38:54] want to get accustomed and used to just
[38:56] coming to church. You know, our prophet
[38:58] says we got to work on our spur of the
[39:00] moment. When that pulsation comes and
[39:02] you hear something that's directly for
[39:03] you, you got to grab a hold of it. He is
[39:06] the God that fights for you. He is the
[39:08] God of your victory and you got to claim

[46:11] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; God our father.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful you are.
[46:20] [Music]
[46:23] Because where men think thought it was
[46:26] impossible,
[46:29] &gt;&gt; you were able to open up the Red Sea.
[46:34] [Music]
[46:35] &gt;&gt; You were you are able to lead us in all
[46:38] circumstances.
[46:41] And it's you that invited us here
[46:43] tonight.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Here we are, Lord.
[46:50] that you may give to us that which you
[46:53] have reserved for us
[46:56] &gt;&gt; as you talk as you told us this morning.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You blessed us by your word
[47:04] &gt;&gt; and tonight we're waiting upon you.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Come Lord, come Lord
[47:12] &gt;&gt; as we are committing everything into
[47:14] your hands
[47:15] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; I believe we once again happy to be in
[47:28] the house of God tonight.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; As we're still standing, we'll take our
[47:34] Bibles
[47:37] in this uh book of 2 Corinthians chapter
[47:41] 10.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; We're going to read the first uh five
[47:46] verses.
[47:48] Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 10.
[48:06] Now I Paul myself beseech you by the
[48:09] meekness and gentleness of Christ who is
[48:13] present whose presence and based among
[48:16] you but being absent and bold towards
[48:20] you.
[48:34] But I beseech you that I may not be bold
[48:37] when I'm present with you.
[48:40] Thy confidence wherewith I think to be
[48:43] bold against some which think of us as
[48:47] we walked according to the flesh.
[48:53] For we we for we for through the flesh.
[48:58] Though we walk through we walk in the
[49:00] flesh, we do not war after the flesh.
[49:11] [Music]
[49:13] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[49:15] carnal, but mighty through God to the
[49:19] pulling down of the stronghold.
[49:33] casting down imagination and every high
[49:36] thing that exalt itself against the
[49:38] knowledge of God and bringing into
[49:41] captivity every thought to the obedience
[49:44] of Christ.
[49:46] [Music]
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Let's also turn to Hebrews chapter 11.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; It's a very familiar scripture reading
[49:57] &gt;&gt; that we love so much.
[50:00] Hebrews 11.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Now faith is the substance of things
[50:12] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[50:14] seen.
[50:21] For by it the elders obtained a good
[50:23] report,
[50:27] visible.
[50:36] Through faith, we understand that the
[50:38] world were framed by the word of God so
[50:41] that the things which are seen were not
[50:44] made of things that do appear.
[50:48] The Lord blessing the reading of his
[50:49] word. You have your seats.
[50:54] We're once again happy to be gather in
[50:56] the house of God tonight
[50:59] [Music]
[51:03] and I believe we all appreciated the
[51:04] word of God this morning
[51:08] by may God bless richly brother David
[51:15] &gt;&gt; I was uh out missing I was out uh for
[51:19] two months
[51:21] &gt;&gt; I was in Africa
[51:25] [Music]
[51:31] I spent a couple of uh days in in France
[51:35] for a friend who invited me to go preach
[51:37] the word uh for him during Easter.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; I also spent time with my mom also in
[51:45] France
[51:48] &gt;&gt; and I went uh to Africa and spent two
[51:51] months over there.
[51:56] The Lord has helped me throughout my uh
[51:58] travel.
[52:03] As for the uh professional uh side of
[52:06] it, what which is what I went to do
[52:11] &gt;&gt; uh on the spiritual side,
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I preach at brother Raphael's church in
[52:21] Brazville.
[52:27] Sister Leslie, my mom has almost the
[52:30] same blessing as sister Leslie.
[52:34] She has three boys
[52:37] and all the three boys are preachers.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Older brother is has a church and I was
[52:47] I had the opportunity to go preach for
[52:49] him.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; It was wonderful.
[52:54] I am back home
[52:58] &gt;&gt; and I thank you all for all your prayers
[53:01] &gt;&gt; and your support
[53:04] and God bless you richly
[53:14] and I was very excited this morning as I
[53:16] heard brother David and brother Brennham
[53:18] when he was commenting on those message
[53:21] this morning.
[53:24] what the Lord has placed on my heart
[53:25] tonight.
[53:28] Something that goes in that same vein.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to uh get uh come up with my
[53:38] little exhortation for tonight
[53:42] [Music]
[53:44] of verse five of 2 Corinthian chapter 10
[53:49] where Paul says,
[53:54] We are casting down imaginations and
[53:57] every reasoning that lift itself up
[53:59] against the word of God.
[54:06] I know when I read in my
[54:08] English version of my Bible,
[54:13] it's saying that we are reversing all
[54:15] imagination.
[54:18] And on the side there's a there's a
[54:20] commentating
[54:24] where that could be replaced by
[54:26] reasoning.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; It's a imagination or reasoning
[54:34] and asam told us this morning
[54:39] and it's not to for us to lean upon our
[54:41] understanding or knowledge.
[54:45] And when we when we rest upon our
[54:47] knowledge,
[54:49] &gt;&gt; we are reasoning.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are even reasoning
[54:55] we are imagining.
[54:58] But when we rest upon that,
[55:03] it will certainly take us away from the
[55:05] word of God
[55:09] because God has never placed reasoning
[55:12] &gt;&gt; to lead us.
[55:15] And this inspiration came to me.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; It was Wednesday morning.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; We had finished praying with my family
[55:27] &gt;&gt; and I told him we're going to take time
[55:29] to listen to 15 minutes of sermon.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; It was the super sign.
[55:35] And when we put it,
[55:40] we we realized that 15 minutes was not
[55:42] enough.
[55:44] Finally, we ended up listening to the
[55:46] whole message
[55:54] and I I came to the understanding that
[55:57] God is leading us to something beyond
[55:59] our reasoning.
[56:03] listening to the testimony that brother
[56:05] was giving him in that message
[56:10] &gt;&gt; to say that scientifically we have no
[56:13] evidence, no explanation,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; that God sent us a message
[56:21] that God confirmed the prophet
[56:28] that would bring us to things that
[56:30] nobody can explain.
[56:35] Even our own human reasoning cannot
[56:37] explain it.
[56:40] In the brother tells a testimony
[56:44] &gt;&gt; that he was somewhere with Billy Paul.
[56:48] Oh,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; there were young men that that had been
[56:50] in an accident
[56:57] and the car had flipped and it was
[56:58] laying on on on top of one of the young
[57:01] men.
[57:02] And the others had gone out.
[57:06] And those that had gone out were trying
[57:08] to pull their friend.
[57:12] And he was crying out saying that don't
[57:14] do that. You're going to kill me.
[57:17] You're going to do don't do it. You're
[57:18] going to kill me.
[57:21] And comes.
[57:24] He asked him if he was a Christian.
[57:27] He said he was not a Christian,
[57:30] but Ram said it would be good that you
[57:32] be a Christian. He said, "Oh, I want to
[57:34] be that."
[57:39] And but says all of the sudden the six
[57:41] sense came on the scene
[57:45] and he just started making steps around
[57:47] the car. He didn't pray. He didn't say a
[57:51] word.
[57:53] And the car came back to to to to over
[57:56] on out from on top of him
[58:01] &gt;&gt; and the boy came out without a problem.
[58:06] Can human reasoning explain that
[58:14] and how reasoning can bring us to doubt
[58:17] of that word.
[58:22] how that reasoning can bring us to doubt
[58:24] even the message
[58:27] &gt;&gt; and even Paul like Paul tonight.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I pray that I pray that God may help me
[58:35] &gt;&gt; that we may reverse all reasoning
[58:40] &gt;&gt; and my title tonight
[58:43] [Music]
[58:44] &gt;&gt; is faith casting down reasoning.
[58:51] Because this message that we have
[58:52] received
[58:55] even like what David was saying it this
[58:56] morning
[58:58] &gt;&gt; the the the point is this uh today.
[59:06] Many preachers have brought their own
[59:08] interpretation of the message
[59:12] instead of preaching the message.
[59:15] One day I was uh uh talking with a
[59:17] friend
[59:21] I said maybe one day I would like to uh
[59:23] uh uh have do a a documentary
[59:28] &gt;&gt; where I'm going to try to film all the
[59:30] preachers of the message
[59:35] where every one of them is saying that
[59:37] you have to say exactly what the message
[59:39] said. They all say that
[59:44] &gt;&gt; but they're contradicting themselves.
[59:48] If it means
[59:52] they're not saying what the message
[59:54] said,
[59:56] like brother David said this morning,
[59:59] &gt;&gt; they give you a MacBook,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; we are all in one accord.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; They give you the message.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody has their own point of view.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; And when each one has their own way of
[1:00:14] viewing it,
[1:00:19] It means they are those that are resting
[1:00:21] upon their own intelligence.
[1:00:26] They are those that are resting upon
[1:00:28] their own reasoning.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; God sent us a message
[1:00:35] that doesn't need reasoning
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; that doesn't need interpretation.
[1:00:42] Because when you interpret,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; you are making the message of non
[1:00:48] effect.
[1:00:51] But when you say exactly what the
[1:00:53] message is saying,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; the message will bring forth the faith
[1:00:59] that's needed
[1:01:01] because the the the the very uh uh need
[1:01:04] for the message or the objective of the
[1:01:07] message
[1:01:10] is to bring us so we can have rapturing
[1:01:13] faith.
[1:01:17] But if we don't have faith to doubt our
[1:01:19] own reasoning,
[1:01:24] How can we have the faith for the
[1:01:26] rapture that's contained in the message?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Then it's very important for us
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; to be like Paul to do
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; that each one of us
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; to cast down by faith
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; your own reasoning.
[1:01:51] It's not that brother Paul is going to
[1:01:53] reverse your reasoning
[1:01:56] that you yourself will take hold of the
[1:01:59] word
[1:02:01] that you will take hold of the message
[1:02:07] that you will cast any reasoning that
[1:02:10] comes against that message.
[1:02:15] And to today we have the impression.
[1:02:19] We have a message from Africa.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; We have a message for Europe.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; We have a message for America.
[1:02:29] There's no different messages.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; There is only one message.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And that message is what the brotherham
[1:02:41] said.
[1:02:43] It doesn't need any interpretation.
[1:02:48] It doesn't need for me to go and grab my
[1:02:51] cultural things.
[1:02:53] But I take things from my tradition
[1:02:58] that I may take it and try to transform
[1:03:00] it into the message.
[1:03:02] It's not going to work.
[1:03:06] The message has to remain the message.
[1:03:09] what the message says.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the most important thing is.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to give us life.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's not what the family says.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; It's not what my tradition says.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I have a friend who's a preacher.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He had a a church in Spain.
[1:03:35] One day he was just sending comments in
[1:03:38] social media.
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:43] He said that for him a young man who
[1:03:45] didn't give the dollar,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; he's not going to bless that wedding
[1:03:53] because the dollar is in the Old
[1:03:56] Testament. It's in the Bible.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; So I sent him a message.
[1:04:01] I said, "My friend, if it's the word,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; that's the your the brothers in Spain,
[1:04:09] the white
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; before they get married,
[1:04:13] do you obligate them to give dollars?"
[1:04:17] He never responded to that
[1:04:21] because if it's the message,
[1:04:25] because they say, "Well, Bernham didn't
[1:04:26] really say anything about it.
[1:04:29] It's not really in the American culture.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; It's not true.
[1:04:35] Brother Brandham preached the word.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached the message.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; If the Valerie was in something that was
[1:04:45] needed in the Bible,
[1:04:47] brother was going to mention it and say
[1:04:51] about it in the message,
[1:04:54] white, black, no matter who you are that
[1:04:57] it's the word of God.
[1:04:58] But you have to do it.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; If he didn't say it,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; then don't interpret the message.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Say that, "Brother, I I desire to to
[1:05:13] remain in my culture."
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; But don't say it's the message.
[1:05:21] You are You are free to reason.
[1:05:25] You are free to take whatever you want
[1:05:27] from your culture. But like Paul
[1:05:31] by faith,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; we want to reverse every reason
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; and and and keep the message pure.
[1:05:41] You can do whatever you want,
[1:05:44] but don't justify it by the message of
[1:05:47] the hour.
[1:05:51] Brother says
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; in wisdom versus faith
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; preach uh uh April 1st 62
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; paragraph
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; paragraph 263
[1:06:07] now look
[1:06:12] Satan could scientifically prove
[1:06:17] by his wisdom
[1:06:21] Now I'm going to play the role of a
[1:06:22] doctor for here.
[1:06:27] Satan could prove scientifically
[1:06:35] by his wisdom that the soil that he was
[1:06:38] going to give for the human race to grow
[1:06:41] it,
[1:06:46] the soil had vitamins. Sure he did. He
[1:06:49] could scientifically prove it.
[1:06:57] They can scientifically prove anything
[1:06:59] they want to almost see. Sure.
[1:07:04] If you can prove that this soil had
[1:07:06] vitamins,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; so he can attract you to what belongs to
[1:07:11] the soil
[1:07:13] to from everything that belongs to the
[1:07:16] world.
[1:07:17] vitamin.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; It had the vitamin P,
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; pleasure, popularity.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Vitamin P.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's vitamin P
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; that's in the world.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; It's in there.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; It's in it's it's in his wisdom soil.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Sure,
[1:07:36] all all worldly pleasures,
[1:07:40] all the picture shows and all the dances
[1:07:42] and all things.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. That's That's all right.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Won't hurt nothing.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; See popularity.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Popularity.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are the biggest church there is
[1:07:58] in the city.
[1:08:01] Vitamin C.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; All right. It had the vitamin C in it
[1:08:05] which he referred to as common sense.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Vitamin C.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Vitamin C.

[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't let the daughter
[1:08:18] just go like that.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Vitamin C.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; It's vitamin C.
[1:08:22] The make sense.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; It had vitamin R,
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; which means reasoning.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He had reason. He could reason.
[1:08:35] You see that won't work. vitamin B.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; He had vitamin uh uh vitamin B
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; which means beauty.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Satan is beautiful.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Sin is beautiful.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; And sin sin began to get more and more
[1:08:54] beautiful it becomes.
[1:08:58] It's the vitamin that that the devil is
[1:09:01] placed here on earth
[1:09:03] that the devil has placed here on earth
[1:09:06] to attract us.
[1:09:11] How much better house we got today than
[1:09:14] the log house.
[1:09:17] How much more prettier it is.
[1:09:22] How much prettier is our women today
[1:09:25] than they used to be. See,
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:31] how much prettier is Florida uh is now
[1:09:34] uh and the way God created it. See
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; it's got beauty.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; How much know how many knows that Satan
[1:09:45] is beautiful? Beauty.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; How he desire beauty
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; and he tried to create a beauty
[1:09:55] uh uh more beautiful kingdom
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and so forth. Sure. We know that
[1:10:03] Satan is in the beauty. Now notice
[1:10:07] vitamin A.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; He had the vitamin R
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; which which is reasoning. Vitamin B
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; which is beauty, vitamin N,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; vitamin B,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; which is modern.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to be more than
[1:10:26] just take his knowledge and find out if
[1:10:28] you don't believe that stuff.
[1:10:31] It will grow right in you.
[1:10:36] That that vitamin will come right where
[1:10:38] you are sitting.
[1:10:43] uh some fellow stand up and gives you
[1:10:45] some kind of some some of his knowledge.
[1:10:48] Now look friend,
[1:10:56] what would it be if we would take this
[1:10:58] great lovely cathedral here and had a
[1:11:02] lot of screaming and and crying
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; and speaking in tongues
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; and running up and down the floor.
[1:11:13] floating of mouth like mad dogs.
[1:11:17] This is the things that we see today in
[1:11:19] the message churches.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; People dance like they dance in the
[1:11:24] world and
[1:11:29] that's what's more than it's the vitamin
[1:11:32] M
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; that Satan is placed into the world
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; that we are bringing into the church.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; We want to take All vitamins that's in
[1:11:42] the world vitamin mo
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; vitamin A modern
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; vitamin B
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; vitamin vitamin B beautiful
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; things do the things that the world is
[1:11:52] doing
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; vitamin R like reasoning
[1:11:56] brother there's nothing wrong with that
[1:12:02] I heard like a preacher from a
[1:12:04] denominational preacher saying
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; he was saying in in Lingala in Congo
[1:12:11] He said that days come from heaven
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; and we are in the time of restitution.
[1:12:24] [Laughter]
[1:12:27] So
[1:12:30] this this vulgar dance
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; was coming from heaven
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; and it's time for us to take it back.
[1:12:40] What? What? What? Uh uh uh uh
[1:12:44] complete uh nonsense.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Vitamin M.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Vitamin M.
[1:13:01] and they're running up and down the
[1:13:02] floor
[1:13:04] or the the the frauding like off the
[1:13:06] mouth like a mad dog.
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:14] I said I said what do you think of the
[1:13:17] mayor of the city would say deacon board
[1:13:20] and and if we would uh uh uh permitting
[1:13:23] such such stuff as to come here.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Oh sure it's more than
[1:13:31] Paragraph 273.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; We want to be modern.
[1:13:38] See,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; that's the devil's wisdom.
[1:13:45] You know, even in Africa
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; in in in the the diary was something
[1:13:52] that was made to be symbolic
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; where the family they would just give
[1:14:00] something symbolic.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Now it's become a
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; a a public uh show a public sale.
[1:14:16] and with an an amount that depends on on
[1:14:20] who the buyer is.
[1:14:23] Continue.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; We continue.
[1:14:36] You see, it's the wisdom. That's the
[1:14:38] devil's wisdom.
[1:14:41] That's what it grows.
[1:14:48] That's the vitamin that's in the soil
[1:14:51] that comes out of the product that it
[1:14:53] produced.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; It's the That's the vitamin in the soil
[1:15:03] that comes out in the product that is
[1:15:05] produced.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; We're going to see a little bit down.
[1:15:11] that it's not the seed,
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; but it's the vitamin.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; So, you can have the seed of God.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; God has a seed in you.
[1:15:28] But if you take vitamin K,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; vitamin M,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; vitamin M,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; vitamin A,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; vitamin R,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; vitamin B,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; vitamin B,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; you will produce the things of the
[1:15:40] world.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; But you have the seed in you.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; We want to reverse all of those vitamins
[1:15:54] to bring the vitamin that will produce
[1:15:56] your true nature.
[1:16:00] the nature that correspond to the seed
[1:16:02] that's in you.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; paragraph 274.
[1:16:24] That's the vitamin that's in the soil
[1:16:26] that comes out in the product that is
[1:16:29] that it produced.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Go on you more than Jezebel. All right.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Modern like like women today of today.
[1:16:38] Sure. Oh, modern.
[1:16:44] Well, the most modern people of the town
[1:16:47] will come to to to the church.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; It's God. Why?
[1:16:53] They grow in that vitam in the modern
[1:16:57] vitamin
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; reasoning vitamin
[1:17:02] they grow in that see
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; that's what it is
[1:17:10] in reasoning but as soon as you start
[1:17:12] growing in that
[1:17:15] you are dead to the word
[1:17:20] you have to deny the word before You can
[1:17:23] be that.
[1:17:25] When you reason,
[1:17:28] you are rejecting the word.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You are basing yourself or setting
[1:17:35] yourself upon your own reasoning.
[1:17:39] The only way you could ever be a sinner
[1:17:43] is to deny God's word.
[1:17:46] What is sin? Unbelief.
[1:17:50] Unbelief in what?
[1:17:52] God's word. See,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; you have to deny the word.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; You have to deny the word first. Oh, I
[1:18:04] got about 10 more vitamins written down
[1:18:07] here
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; that the devil
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; is placed upon the earth
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; to attract our attention
[1:18:19] to keep us away from the word,
[1:18:23] to bring us to reason the word.
[1:18:27] Because what God wants from us
[1:18:31] is not just to be church members
[1:18:34] or to and reason with the word.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; God wants us to be true Christians.
[1:18:43] He continued,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; he continues
[1:18:48] paragraph 17 uh 276.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; But here's one vitamin that he failed to
[1:18:56] tell them all to tell them to tell them.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; He had the vitamin D.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; It's the most that's the that's the
[1:19:07] biggest vitamin in there.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Results death.
[1:19:14] Heam he's making you taste of all the
[1:19:17] other vitamins,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; but he's not telling you that behind all
[1:19:22] of those vitamins vitamin D,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; there is the vitamin D, vitamin,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; the vitamin of death. You see
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; 281
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus said
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; man lives by every word.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Every word that proceedth out of the
[1:19:46] mouth of God. Who said that? Jesus.
[1:19:50] That's right.
[1:19:52] He said,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; "If any other man said anything
[1:19:57] different,
[1:19:58] let him be a liar.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; His word, his word be true.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; but my word shall not pass.
[1:20:16] There you are." So vitamin D lays in his
[1:20:20] formula Martin.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; but the seed word of the Bible
[1:20:35] can't grow in such ground as that.
[1:20:41] The seed that God placed in you,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; the seed of God that's in you,
[1:20:50] he cannot grow
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; when you when you are surrounded by all
[1:20:56] of these vitamins.
[1:20:59] You are you are suffocating the seed.
[1:21:05] You are preventing this seed from
[1:21:07] growing.
[1:21:10] It doesn't mean you don't have the seed.
[1:21:13] The seed is there,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; but it cannot grow
[1:21:20] because there's too many vitamins of the
[1:21:23] devil around it.
[1:21:34] 282. But now the word seed can grow in
[1:21:37] there. It says how can a person go into
[1:21:40] one of these modern church now
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God come upon come come
[1:21:46] upon it they they they they want to
[1:21:50] holler
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; glory to God hallelujah
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; the seed of God
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; the seed word
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; cannot grow
[1:22:07] when we Deep reasoning vitamin
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; vitamin
[1:22:11] M vitamin
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; vitamin M modern vitamin
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; I want to do modern things.
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; I I I do it because if I don't do it
[1:22:24] they're going to look at me and they say
[1:22:26] I'm oldfashioned
[1:22:30] two 28 291
[1:22:37] vitamin
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; but faith only grows in one vitamin.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; It only had it only has one vitamin.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Don't have to be to have any mix mixture
[1:22:55] vitamin.
[1:22:57] Faith grows in one vitamin.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:23:05] Faith comes from what we're hearing,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; what we are hearing from the word of
[1:23:10] God.
[1:23:14] If we have other vitamins,
[1:23:18] the only way for us
[1:23:22] to get rid of all of the other vitamins
[1:23:25] is to to believe the word
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; is to say amen to every word,
[1:23:32] even when it hurts,
[1:23:35] even it's against me,
[1:23:41] even when I feel like I won't be able to
[1:23:43] make a step.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Just say amen
[1:23:48] and ask the Lord to help you.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Don't reason.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; The devil will try to keep you in his R
[1:24:00] vitamin
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; to keep reasoning,
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; but the seed,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; the faith
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; only need one vitamin.
[1:24:14] That's vitamin word.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that faith can
[1:24:30] grow in is the word.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; And the only way it can it can grow
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; is because it believe the word.
[1:24:45] And he has to take the whole world
[1:24:49] and believe it's true
[1:24:51] vitamin
[1:24:56] and faith vitamin.
[1:25:01] He spelled in a little forward letter.
[1:25:05] life.
[1:25:07] Life
[1:25:15] has the vitamin
[1:25:17] L.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It has the vitamin L.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Faith has vitamin L.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's the only vitamin that we need.
[1:25:33] It's the only vitamin that allows us to
[1:25:36] move forward.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It's the only vitamin that gives us
[1:25:41] life.
[1:25:46] Butam says
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; in believers uh the believer's position
[1:25:54] in Christ
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; uh preach uh January 16, 1955
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; paragraph 13.
[1:26:04] Now,
[1:26:12] now if we can find our position and know
[1:26:15] that it's the word that has promised it,
[1:26:25] that's the reason Joshua and Calb had no
[1:26:27] fear that they could take they could
[1:26:30] that they could not take the promised
[1:26:33] land.
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:37] because all the rest of the nine came
[1:26:40] back uh or the 10 uh and said
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; we can't do it.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; That's the vitamin R that we're talking
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; we won't be able to do it.
[1:27:02] He said, "These cities are fortified
[1:27:08] and the walled and we're like
[1:27:09] grasshoppers on
[1:27:12] grasshoppers up on the this the people.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; They are so big and they are armed.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Our five senses natural.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; We bring us to reasoning. Our eyes see
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; our ears will hear
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and we'll touch will say no.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; I know God said it.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; But vitamin A
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; vitamin R
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; and you know what it does.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; It said we won't be we won't we can't do
[1:27:52] it.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Those cities walled high
[1:27:58] And we look like grasshoppers.
[1:28:02] They are so big. They are so armed.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And said,
[1:28:08] "We just can't do it."
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:28:14] they were looking at the sense of
[1:28:17] reasoning.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You can't look at the sense of
[1:28:22] reasoning.
[1:28:25] You've got to look at the promise of
[1:28:27] God.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Now, God had already sent his angel
[1:28:35] and the angel was in the camp.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Moving on.
[1:28:40] God has already sent us his angel and we
[1:28:43] know that
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; and the revelation of God
[1:28:54] had brought the word of God manifested
[1:29:00] and now there was ready to push into the
[1:29:03] promised land.
[1:29:06] Therefore, Joshua and Caleb had all the
[1:29:09] promise.
[1:29:12] All the promises was to them. For God
[1:29:15] had promised he was going to give them
[1:29:17] the land.
[1:29:19] God has already given us all the
[1:29:21] promises.
[1:29:24] We are like Caleb and Joshua today.
[1:29:29] God gave us all the promises.
[1:29:34] And he says,
[1:29:48] [Applause]
[1:29:50] A pill of fire formed over them and they
[1:29:54] followed it.
[1:30:00] And here it was right up here at the
[1:30:03] promised land now ready to push over.
[1:30:11] So he could believe it because God's
[1:30:13] promise are in is infallible.
[1:30:17] They are the truth.
[1:30:24] It's the reasoning that brings us to not
[1:30:26] believe that the promises of God are
[1:30:28] infallible.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Even in our lives when we think we don't
[1:30:41] have greater manifestations,
[1:30:46] You look at the little things that God
[1:30:48] is doing.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; I remember I had a friend who was a
[1:30:55] deacon in France.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; He had a a child who was about seven,
[1:31:00] eight years old.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; His name was David.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; I was with him. I was playing with a
[1:31:08] little kid. And I said, "Oh, David,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; how can you have a great name like
[1:31:14] David?"
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; You know, David in the Bible,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; he he killed the the the the uh uh bear.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He killed a lion and he killed Goliath.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; And you you you you buried you carry the
[1:31:32] name of David. What what have you done?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I already clearly fly.
[1:31:40] It was his testimony.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He already killed the fly.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; So he had the he had the right to bear
[1:31:48] the name of David.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; So the little thing that God had done
[1:31:54] for you,
[1:31:57] you considered herself that you purpose
[1:32:00] for carrying a name.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It was a testimony.
[1:32:04] Now he didn't kill a lion.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't kill Goliath.
[1:32:08] But he had already killed a fly.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That was his testimony.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; But says,
[1:32:23] "The promises of God are infallible.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; They are the truth.
[1:32:37] How do you think it's been friends uh
[1:32:39] through these years of meetings
[1:32:42] opposition around the world in many
[1:32:44] different in many different uh 20ome old
[1:32:48] different nations
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; that the Lord sent me into to visit
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and there were city there were critics
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; the oppositions
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; demons
[1:33:02] scientists
[1:33:04] trying to oppose it
[1:33:10] and throw into every trial that they
[1:33:12] could be that they could be tried.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Regardless of all the oppositions,
[1:33:21] God confirmed that this message was
[1:33:23] reality.
[1:33:28] God confirmed that this message had the
[1:33:31] vitamin L vitamin
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; vitamin of life vitamin D
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; vitamin of faith
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; as I'm going to come to a close
[1:33:47] I'll take a a super sense
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; preached December 27 1959 9
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; paragraph 163
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; faith will will topple reasoning.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Faith has to reverse all the reasoning
[1:34:14] into our lives
[1:34:17] regardless of what circumstances look
[1:34:19] like,
[1:34:21] regardless of what happens.
[1:34:25] When we take position for God,
[1:34:29] he will take position for us.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things we do by
[1:34:36] ignorance.
[1:34:39] We do things because we've seen others
[1:34:41] do.
[1:34:46] Things that we do because in the message
[1:34:48] they told us we could do it.
[1:34:52] I don't have the
[1:34:57] I don't have the message here but uh I
[1:34:59] remember in a message brother was saying
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; when
[1:35:08] to find the bride for uh for uh Isaac
[1:35:14] when he when he when he found Rebecca
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; he had two people that he had to to to
[1:35:23] to come in contact with.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; There were two pe two people that were a
[1:35:31] a problem for him.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; When he said that his mission was done,
[1:35:36] that he had to go back.
[1:35:41] There were two people who wanted that
[1:35:42] Rebecca should remain.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; It was the mother
[1:35:48] and the brother.
[1:35:52] The mother is the one who claims to be a
[1:35:54] mother. That's the Catholic church. And
[1:35:57] the brother is the preacher.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Those the those are the two people that
[1:36:04] are holding forth the bride.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 163.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; A super sign.
[1:36:19] It says it's the most powerful force
[1:36:22] that's ever been on Earth.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; It's the most powerful force that's ever
[1:36:31] hit the earth.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; It's the most powerful force.
[1:36:39] Look at look at how we are letting the
[1:36:41] vitamin R reasoning
[1:36:47] prevent us from talking or take
[1:36:49] partaking of the vitamin that's the most
[1:36:51] powerful.
[1:36:58] It has nothing to do with this down
[1:37:00] here.
[1:37:05] If this down here declares it and says
[1:37:08] amen to it,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; that's all right.
[1:37:12] you are moving on.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; But regardless of what this does,
[1:37:21] believe that.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; That's where the that's where that's
[1:37:25] where the power.
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:28] If you believe in your heart,
[1:37:35] your fifth sense of thinking
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; lays lays within your brain.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; But your sixth sense
[1:37:46] lays in your heart.
[1:37:49] You believe with your heart.
[1:37:52] Confess. Confession is made by the
[1:37:55] mouth.
[1:37:57] You believe with your heart.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; that six sense that powerful force.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Listen
[1:38:10] because of the six sense.
[1:38:14] There was a prophet thrown into a lion's
[1:38:17] d.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; He speak makes commentary.
[1:38:24] Someone who's thrown into a lion's d of
[1:38:28] full of hungry lion
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; but he was not eaten.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Reasoning cannot explain that
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; but faith can make it possible.
[1:38:42] He continues he speaks about Peter
[1:38:48] who was in prison.
[1:38:51] Peter in prison
[1:38:54] with chains
[1:38:56] sleeping
[1:38:59] and then they find themselves in in
[1:39:01] Mark's house. The people within the
[1:39:03] house of John Mark
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; in praying
[1:39:11] utilizing the faith vitamin.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Now they didn't know how God was going
[1:39:19] to work it out.
[1:39:21] But they knew that when we ask God,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; he will do it according to his word.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; And as they were praying,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; God who heard their prayers,
[1:39:37] he took Peter away was in prison
[1:39:40] and he brought he brought him where they
[1:39:42] were praying for him.
[1:39:44] Reason cannot explain that.
[1:39:49] So if we want to keep reasoning,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; we are living or staying under our
[1:39:56] privileges.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; We are uh uh uh starving oursel from the
[1:40:04] most powerful force
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; as I called a musician at this time.
[1:40:10] But says
[1:40:14] paragraph 165,
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; but the same six sense,
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; three Hebrew children were thrown into a
[1:40:25] fierce furnace
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; and they defy the flames of furnace.
[1:40:33] When you read the story, the Bible tells
[1:40:36] us
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; that they they they they tied these
[1:40:40] young Hebrews
[1:40:43] and there were people that were not
[1:40:44] tied.
[1:40:46] They were they were free
[1:40:49] that were leading these young men's into
[1:40:51] the furnace.
[1:40:54] And when they get before the furnace,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; the same flame,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; it burns those that were behind leading
[1:41:04] them into the flame
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; and it brings to them an AC, an air
[1:41:11] conditioner,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; the same flame.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; How can the reasoning explain that?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; What kind of God do we have?
[1:41:26] All that the devil is giving us vitamins
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; is to prevent us from accessing
[1:41:35] our privileges.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Is to hold us from growing this seed
[1:41:43] that God has placed inside of us.
[1:41:47] But it's time for us to to water this
[1:41:49] seed with a word.
[1:41:53] It's the time to take the word
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; faith
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; and to go forward with it.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Just to say amen to every word.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Even when you don't understand
[1:42:08] when it's the word,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; just say amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe I don't have that revelation of it
[1:42:18] today.
[1:42:21] to tomorrow God will give me the
[1:42:23] revelation.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; But when it's the word,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I just say amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to take faith.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I want to reverse all the reasoning.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I want to stay far from all the vitamins
[1:42:44] that the devil is giving
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; and guide and keep your vitamin. faith.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, our heavenly father,
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; we really need this vitamin of faith
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:13] as we are just traveling on this ocean
[1:43:17] full of waves.
[1:43:23] Sometimes all these vitamins,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; they came and to overtake and to water
[1:43:32] our lives
[1:43:37] to express things that are not of your
[1:43:39] word,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; but from our heart. Lord,
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; we know that you placed a seed in us.
[1:43:52] We feel that deepness of that seed
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; that cries after your word
[1:43:59] that claims your word
[1:44:03] that says, "Lord, here I am.
[1:44:06] Lord, look at here's my brother.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, here's my sister.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Oh dear. Oh Lord,
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; help us to take your word.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Help us to keep the faith
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; regardless of circumstances. Lord,
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; let us just love you, Lord.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; To love you from the bottom of our
[1:44:32] heart.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I commit every one of your children,
[1:44:39] Lord.
[1:44:40] I commit myself into your hands.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that nothing in this
[1:44:48] world can help us,
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; but you are the only one.
[1:44:54] Lord, we learn this morning
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; that when we are invaded by all these
[1:45:02] vitamins,
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; when we are tired,
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; when we are deprived,
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; we need a coach for life.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; You are our coach.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; You Your word is our coach.
[1:45:25] Oh Lord, we need your coaching tonight.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Not just tonight,
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; but all the days of our lives.
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; We commit ourselves to you.
[1:45:40] We believe that you've heard our prayers
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; because it's your promise
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and we ask
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:56] And let's just sing down.
[1:46:02] Oh, when I look upon holiness,
[1:46:11] oh when I gaze into your lovely
[1:46:18] and when all things start around
[1:46:23] become shadows in the light

[1:46:39] your heart.
[1:46:42] And when my will become enthroned in
[1:46:46] your love.
[1:46:49] And when all things pass around,
[1:46:54] we become shadows in the light
[1:46:58] of you.
[1:47:02] Oh,
[1:47:04] I worship you.
[1:47:12] I worship
[1:47:14] you.
[1:47:18] Oh

[1:48:19] that we may go. And we want the word of
[1:48:21] God to have an effect on our hearts. We
[1:48:24] don't just want to be listeners. We want
[1:48:25] to be doers. We want to see the word as
[1:48:27] Alberta said that we may move away the
[1:48:30] reasoning and let the word take effect
[1:48:32] in our life. Amen. Brother Ben, if you
[1:48:35] could just come and continue the songs
[1:48:36] as we get ready for the baptism. Amen.

[1:49:18] When I found the joy of reaching your
[1:49:24] heart,
[1:49:27] let my be

[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:50] my
[1:53:53] to
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:57] I am
[1:54:00] where my help comes from.
[1:54:03] Oh, I look to you.
[1:54:08] I
[1:54:09] he
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:14] Jesus is the Lord.
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Thankful for the word.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it's the word. It's only
[1:54:28] the word of God that creates faith as we
[1:54:31] heard it. And you can even ask, well,
[1:54:33] how can one just by the process of being
[1:54:36] baptized and and then get the Holy Ghost
[1:54:39] and all of that? How reasoning cannot
[1:54:41] understand that? But we understand
[1:54:43] that's a promise.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And we know that many of us are sitting
[1:54:47] here. We gather here because it proves
[1:54:50] that the promise is true, that the
[1:54:52] formula is true. We heard the word of
[1:54:55] God. Some preachers preach somewhere and
[1:54:57] we were convicted in our hearts and we
[1:54:59] came to the altar and we prayed and all
[1:55:02] of the sudden our lives changed. What
[1:55:05] changed it? God changed it. Why? Because
[1:55:08] we believe in the formula. God came and
[1:55:10] he made his word a reality in our lives.
[1:55:13] Amen. And as the scripture will say in
[1:55:15] Acts chapter 2, it says that now they
[1:55:18] were when they heard this, they were
[1:55:20] pricricked in their heart and they said
[1:55:23] unto Peter and the rest of them of the
[1:55:25] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[1:55:27] we do? Then Peter said unto them, repent
[1:55:30] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:55:33] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:55:36] of your sins, and ye shall receive the
[1:55:38] gift of the Holy Ghost. For this promise
[1:55:41] is unto you and unto your children and
[1:55:44] to all that are far off, even as many as
[1:55:47] our Lord God shall call. So the promise
[1:55:50] is still in effect. The promise is still
[1:55:53] true. We're still baptizing and the Lord
[1:55:55] is still receiving and giving the
[1:55:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So,
[1:56:01] Brother D'Angelo, and we certainly uh
[1:56:05] come here by the great commission that
[1:56:06] we've been given. And the word says that
[1:56:09] go into all the world. And when the word
[1:56:11] is preached and is received, it says
[1:56:13] baptize everyone in the name of the Lord
[1:56:16] Jesus Christ. And we know that's the
[1:56:18] name of the father, son, and the holy
[1:56:19] ghost that's been revealed to us in the
[1:56:22] same time to be the name of the Lord
[1:56:23] Jesus Christ. So tonight we baptize you
[1:56:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:58] Hallelujah.
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:05] Oh, and all the way.
[1:57:10] I'm going all the way.
[1:57:15] I will not rest until I see his shiny
[1:57:20] face on that sweet day.
