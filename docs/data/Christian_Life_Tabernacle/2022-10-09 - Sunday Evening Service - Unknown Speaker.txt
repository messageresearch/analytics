the purchase of that blood if we had a diamond that would buy us an island we could go live on in Paradise and we had to sell that diamond to gain access to that Island once we're on the island you wouldn't rule losing the value of the diamond because you got the island I don't want to profane the blood of the Lord Jesus it wasn't in vain [Music] but if we don't live up to what he purchased then

hold my hand granny [Music] oh when it is [Music] for me I was loved and I'm done without God [Music] is [Music] enjoy detail and hearing your voice he asked me to bless you need a way to keep my sermon a little short s and then we'll have it uh and I'll try not to get too excited I thought as I listened to this I said you know this whole sermon is only an hour and 30 minutes long and there's more in it than I could preach in 10 years but uh so we're going to just read our scripture that we read this morning found in Isaiah the seventh chapter and uh and uh read from uh that again and uh and then let me see if I can find that here and then we will uh get prepared to uh listen to that so Isaiah 7 said the 10th verse moreover the Lord's fake again to to azad's saying ask the assign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the the depth or in the highest above but Asad said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said hear ye now o House of David it is a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary My God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel Lord bless you you may be seated so we're certainly uh talking about the sign and uh I had a wonderful a chance to have some fellowship uh this afternoon and we had a sister come to church and she came to the church for the first time and and the reason that she came to church was because she had a dream about a storm and um so in this dream that she had about a storm it it touched her so much that she made contact with her family and said I want to go to church and then when she came to church well the first thing we began to talk about was the oncoming storm and preparing for this storm and and so so she came to fellowship and we got to talking and I says well do you go to church she says I don't go to church and I said well you know better than that and she said yeah she says but I'm going to start going to church so I thought that was pretty good here open that for me would you and um as they took a bone out of my hand and I don't have uh much strength in that but we're going to listen to 40 minutes right now out of the message super sign and we're going to start with paragraph 55. and uh but I just want to read this statement uh to you again before we go forward and uh I I wanted to I was going to try to preach this next part but he can do it so much better that I just felt that to play this part and it says now that's the way the gospel is today uh it can only be seen this is paragraph 54. it can only be seen in the way that God presents it to you and that's why the church will never flourish on second-hand revelation you know so how many understands how God chose to present the message to us he chose to present it to us through Malachi 4 5. Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7. in order to present it to us who weren't there he stored it up in a storehouse put it on magnetic tape that we too could hear and listen and hear that voice so that voice wasn't lost to us and now so the only way we can see it is the way he presented it and and so we've had that presentation in our day and and so he says and if it's presented to you outside the continuity of the Bible then it's not God telling you that you can't make the Bible lie it's infallible word of God and it has to agree with the continuity of his the rest of his word it just can't say this one place and this something else and do this over hit and Scatter it hits the target every time the word does so you have to make it in the continuity of the rest of the word therefore his way has always been in the word to send a prophet before that time therefore he makes his word Vindicated and so where we pick at up after that statement brother Brennan makes this statement now I want to speak just a minute on what is a prophet I think you'll enjoy it uh just a few of us will listen to 40 minutes and then we should be out here in just a little bit it's uh I don't know what time is it 5 30 40 minutes then maybe we'll be out by what 6 30 7 something like that close anyway I love listening to the message don't you amen I think you'll enjoy this there's some other comments brother Brandon makes in here and brother Ram's going to make a statement why people build big nice houses you ever can think of that and there's he tells you why he tells you why people go build these great big gigantic houses you know so listen to that it's really good and then he he talks about a lot of little things and then at the end of this he talks about how important you are as a believer because if you didn't believe it it wouldn't be a message and so there's some really wonderful things here that I think you'll enjoy so God bless you as we listen to our messenger explain to us what is a prophet God bless you now we might speak here just about what is a prophet now in the English terms according to the English terms of it it means a preacher well that's the English terms but in the Hebrew terms it's called seer and a Seer was the one who had the interpretation of the written word and he foresaw things that was to come and when he spoke of the things that was to come and proved that he was a Seer then he no they knowed he had the right interpretation of the scripture because God through him manifested the written scripture for that day Hallelujah don't be Soulful wake up that was a plain identification a seer a fourth teller not tell her fourth and the only way that they know he's getting the right interpretation to do the scripture because what he said come to pass then they know he was called of God God said that and then he noticed that it did it come right back in continuity with the word for that day Jesus said search the scriptures when they seen he could discern the thoughts that was in their mind they called him Beelzebub he said search the scriptures they're the ones that testify on me the continuity of the scriptures run it perfectly but the sign of the time he was God's side of the time he was the manifestation of the written word and also could foretell what would happen and they could not deny it he was a super sign of the day he certainly was notice the continuity of his unchanging word also the Holy Spirit Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will remind you or reveal these things I've told you and also we'll show you things to come now the Bible the people say today there is no such a thing as a prophet in the world why as if Paul said it in the church there were first apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists certainly there was the Holy Ghost is the prophet when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will reveal or teach you show you these things I've told you it's all been in a riddle you don't understand them now because it's not far your age now but when the Holy Ghost has come he will make those things live outright to the promise not only that but he'll show you things that is to come Glory the continuity of God's word God's promise God's spirit we're living in the hour watching the unfolding of the Prophecies of the age coming to pass what a great time that we're living in the Holy Spirit was the surest things that was to come man has ever tried to achieve and make for himself a name by making him a super sign what makes a man try to make himself something super over the other why does he do that sinner but his statue he's a fallen Son of God why does he make himself such a pretty home making it better all the time is the the bird don't make his home any different the groundhog still lives in the ground like he did a thousand years ago see the bird still builds a nest like he did a thousand years ago see but man is increasing why he's a any and he is a fallen Son of God there's something in him that tells him that a palace more beautiful than something in him is trying to find it it's searching for it oh if we look at some of these homes today what will them be on the other side when a fallen nature can do a thing like this what will it be but that's what makes him do that is nature inside of him though he is Fallen he tries to make something in himself he tries to do that it's been from the beginning Adam he tried to make a super religion without an atonement they're still trying to do it a super religion make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to without an atonement and still have a covering he tried to do it in the beginning and he's still trying to do it but God's provided what he wasn't atonement and it'll never work the other way it has to come back to an atonement Nimrod tried to build a super Tower a religious Tower whether it be anybody that would a little Tower might have been 30 feet high but he wanted to make something super something greater so he built him a tower that wasn't his day Nebuchadnezzar wanted to build a super City he took the pattern off of Heaven The Swinging Gardens the river Euphrates by the throne just like the Water of Life the River of Life running by the Throne of God he tried to make a super City the United States a few years ago tried to make a super ship they made it so they said it would never sink it couldn't be saint God put the Titanic in the bottom of the sea or is that man's achievement well never amount to anything it's all Dustin going back to the Dust what's in him Russia Today is trying to raise up a super scientist that can do some scientific things to conquer the world France not all gold thought they could still have their women whining big time so they made himself a called imaginal line had their guns all towards Germany the arch enemy if they ever come this way we'll just live any way we want to we'll make a big super line out here and make out of concrete horn or guns and to ever come we'll touch a button it'll all fire and blow him back in Germany Germany marched right around behind it they forgot soil Weavers off god with his my hands shows this world he cannot stand but they want to Super sign they made him imagine online at Germany marched out of behind because he forgot so they could put the gun on a tour you could roll it back around the other way and shoot they forgot that that's just what the church is forgetting today they got a super Church they got a super denomination they got super dressed people they got everything they want super ministers with super education but you forget that God's word cannot fail it's got to come the way God said it was going to come there's no way of getting around it Along come Germany later on they thought that was a good idea so they'd fix it so they could turn their guns the other way so they built themselves a line called the Siegfried line but American Blockbusters blow them out of the ground see they're trying to make something super super all the time churches today won't their super denomination we've tried for a long time methodists take all Baptists take all then the Pentecostal come in the race they take all Catholics try to take all so they find out a little scattered group they can't do it but put them together how scriptural it sounds put us together put us together we'll do it then we'll run communism out of the ocean not knowing that God raised up communism to defeat him that's a big word for a preacher to say but I get so sick of hearing this communism communism you know there's signs of Communism but the hour you're living in you don't know nothing about it and you know God promised to do that the same as he started to raise up Nebuchadnezzar destroy Israel because they didn't walk in his way the Bible plainly teaches that this is the hour for it to happen we find out in the day that we're living all these things are not nothing hid it's something that God has revealed in the word but people are too blind to sin today we think well now if we can all get together in the unity there is uh in the council the multitude of council there is safety that is true but what kind of multitude are you Counseling in how can you walk together how can you throw these denominations together some of them Believers and some unbelievers and some make believers how do you go to put them together and walk together how can two walk together except they'd be agreed it's also written look here what they do they make themselves a multitude one time they did the same thing in the Bible when Ahab was in trouble and uh they have sent down for Jehovah to come down from from Judea and and to find out if he would take these armies and help him fight the battle and Jehoshaphat a Believer out of connection with these God went down there and said yes said there's a piece of ground up there that belongs to us that's ours God gave it to us the prophet Joshua lauded us at ground and now we find out that it belongs to the enemy the enemy is growing wheat on Earth it should go in the bellies of us Hebrews and now they're taking it over there with the Enemy said shall we go up will you go up with me well now Jehovah not taking the second thought said well sure my church is your chariots my Horseman's your Horseman my footman is your footman we are brothers let's agree together we'll make an alliance and we'll go up that is struck him we better seek God first oh my before you join that thing you better seek God first you better find out before you throw your church in such a babbling as that you'll have to do it or either take the mark of the beast but when they said Ahab said certainly I want to thought of that I said I've got 400 down here at the Seminary Hebrew prophets the best there is in the country there's no better anywhere we'll go get them not come the prophets of the all prophesied sure there was exactly with the the right idea they thought it said certainly that belongs to Israel if God gave that to Israel it belongs to Israel but God only gives you these things on conditions that's what I think about the gifts of the Spirit in the church today so many says it needs to be in there but it'll only come in there utter conditions Northern Minister said to me not long ago won't you quit picking on them women and men about this side of the other said they'd regard you as a Seer a prophet said why don't you teach them how to receive the Holy Ghost and great gifts I said what would they do with them said you you are to teach them better things than trying to tell them how to cut their hair and wear their clothes and so forth like that you shouldn't do that I said how am I going to teach them algebra when they won't even listen to their ABCs thank you how do you go to do that they got the God gives these gifts on conditions and that land belonged to Israel on conditions that have stayed true to God but look what I Renegade they had in there for a pastor let's let in idolatry and everything else be swept in but the prophets thinking that that belonged to God belonged to Israel was a gift to Israel they ought to possess it that's the same thing taking place today but remember when they all prophesy would want a carbon one of my things zedekiah I've met him a great big set of iron horns he said you'll take these and push the serious come out of the country with them and they just didn't suit this uh religious good moral man uh Jehoshaphat he said well haven't he got one more one more when we got 400 400 with one of cards say we'll have the Council of churches we just do it see they're all in unity said they're everyone in agreement say why don't you go ahead and just go on up with me he said isn't there just one more that you could consult about this that has contact with God he said yes he's one more but I sure hate him that's it oh let not the king say so said Jehoshaphat let's go consult him and see what it would be he said there's one yeah I know and the son of England said Micah but said I hate him said he's always putting curses on me he's always telling me I'm wrong and uh hell's waiting for me I said I hate to eat here and preach now the rest of minutes won't even have them in their churches said we've kicked him out a long time ago out of the association said I don't even know where you'd find him oh I said don't let the king say so let's go get him so then one of the association went action he said now Micah you got a chance to get your membership card back again if you'll say the same thing they say see you're just so good if you'll agree with us that we all should join the council and all going together well yes you be one of us oh but God's always got somebody you'll stand true he said as the Lord God Lives I'll only say what he tells me to say hey that was the sign to Jehoshaphat you know how the story goes and he said why God said although 400 in a council was against him yet he stood and it was a sign to Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat wouldn't go out there so we find out how the outcome was because that man's word was exactly what the prophet's word that have been prophesied for ahab's day because he took the righteous and nabob and slayed him in things God told him through the Prophet Elijah that the dogs will lick your own blood that's right and what would take place and how they'd eat Jezebel he prophesied that was the word and Micah was the one who could bring it to pass amen he was a prophet's sign of that day that only listened to him it has never failed God always sends it everybody's always wanting a sign we're supposed to look for signs that's right but religious uh scriptural signs not religious signs Bible signs everybody was going to look for a sign and they know this should be a super day God's seeing the end from the beginning so he said I'll give them a sign a super sign I'll give them an eternal sign amen I'll give him one that'll never fail and never pass away amen they want a sign so I'm going to give them on the super sign he didn't come in the Polish of the world the way they expected him to come but what did he say a virgin shall conceive that was a sign that was a super sign a virgin shall conceive amen a super uh super sign not a natural sign but a super sign a virgin conceiving see a supernatural sign Supernatural it was a super sign for a virgin I never did it before but she shall conceive what was it to be his name Shall be Called Emmanuel how would it be God in man will become one that's a super sign oh God if the world could only see that that God is near one the super sign was that first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church super sign God and man together that was to be the Super side of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days a super sign a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested In the Flesh a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's still a super sign notice super sign they've got Superman today they got fictions of Superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in human flesh God you're not a man he's sure super sign notice the Eternal sign an unfailing sign it will never fail man at the word and man become one when God's word and man become one is Saint John the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the super sign or if that was a super sign of that day when that same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that's still the super sign the church can have the sign of the council all of them getting together for a fake world peace and all they want to be the Baptist can say we got a million more and 44. the Methodist should make any kind of brags they won't do Oneness or Trinity's whatever they may be but the super sign is still God ever remains true to that super sign it's God in man manifesting his written word his word when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you he'll reveal these things show them to you and we'll show you things to come Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever exactly Abraham's supersede he was super Sun Abraham had one son he begot that by the natural flesh that was Isaac then he had another son that son was the faith that was Jesus he was the son of Abraham son of David Son of God he foresaw it in the vision faith in his promised word shown in the last to show forth in his last days Abraham we're supposed to be Abraham's seed if we are dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and Heir with him according to the promise now why was this super sign given to Abraham because that it would bring forth the super sign of the last day it has to be displeased God showed Abraham the end from the beginning and what was going to take place God manifested in man his super Faith son man that could not destroy this son they could destroy Isaac they could destroy Jacob and the sisters after them but this super son could not be destroyed Abraham the Seed of Abraham the faith that not the natural seed but the faith that Abraham received not by the law of circumcision but by the faith in the word Abraham's super Faith son which was Jesus Christ now all his other sons died but this son could not be killed he was killed but could not stay dead the grave could not hold him he's the same yesterday and forever notice Genesis 22 16 and 17 upon the mount where God showed Abraham to go and there he saw a ram hooked by his horns in the wilderness notice quickly now after you took Isaac and bound him which was his natural son lady him upon the the altar to take his life and they started to take his life in Obedience of love to God and when he did something happened he heard a boy saying Abraham stay your hand for I know that thou loves me and then he heard a ramble hooked by its horns in the wilderness behind him and he called the name of the place Jehovah Jireh notice God said and uh your seed the Seed of Abraham now would possess the gates of its enemies he would take the gates possess the gates he promised it now his natural seed did just that all of Abraham's natural seed was the prophets to come after him that was Moses Abraham's seed and when he did he came to the gate in a line of duty he came to the gate of the Red Sea after teaching the children of Israel of the promised land that God had promised he was God's prophet he had been manifested before the people as God's prophet God created by him God did all kinds of signs and wonders by him and he stayed just exactly with God's word because he sought God first and he knew his position he knowed he was born for that age to manifest the word of God at that time and then right in the line of duty he come up against something that he know not what to do that was the Red Sea but what happened the Seed of Abraham was promised to possess the enemy's Gates so when the Red Sea become a gate that he couldn't come to God moved upon the scene and took the gate and went away with it and Moses walked across the sea on dry land assess the gate the Hebrew children possess the gates at the fiery furnace that could not even burn them Daniel possessed the enemy's gates at the line miles it could not be open to eating Samson one time caught in the a bunch of people uh he faced him in the city and when he did he pulled those great big Gates out of the Rocks put him up on his shoulders and walked up the top of the hill why was he he was still in the Covenant his locks are still hanging on him the promise is still there and he'll possess the gates of his enemy hey man sir certainly all these died fine Warriors of the faith they all died then come on the scene the super Seed of Abraham the Royal seed the super Royal Sea Jesus Christ which was Abraham's Faith son that he saw by faith through a promise of God and he'd bless all be the father of many nations his supersede come on the sea what do these others do they possess the gates of lions the Gates of Fire the gates of the sea the gates of the city and everywhere they come they was able to possess the gates because they were promised it but when it come to death they all had to die now here comes a royal seat on not only did he possess the gates of the enemy but he possessed the gates of death Hell In The Grave rose up on the third day and opened up the way rent The Veil from top to bottom and made a way for every man or woman who desired to come to him to come he possessed the gates not only did he that but those who had died in faith he led captivity captive and let's set it on high and give gifts unto man that's Abraham's supersede that's the Royal Sea Jesus Christ the super sign remember it was an everlasting sign a supernatural Everlasting sign Jesus was he arose from the dead they cannot hold him death Heller the grave cannot hold him Hebrews 13 8 as I said he says same yesterday ever to show to show this super sign in this age watch let's take the path of Abraham just for a moment a type of a seed Abraham the prophet watch God has spoken to him in many ways since he had left the child here the city of her he had traveled along and God had showed him many great signs that appeared to him showed him all kinds of things that would happen told him what would take place all these things he had told him but before he received his promised son he was standing near the gates of the Gentiles just above Sodom and before he received uh his his super son or his son that was to be born a super son of course before he received him not the Royal one now but before he received him he received the super sign what was it God came down to him in a form of a man notice that man that talked with him it stood at the tent where he was at and performed a super sign and when his super son came on the scene his super Sun performed the same sign to show that he was Abraham's supersede he's fine and he promised the same thing in the last days you see what I mean Abraham before the just before the promised son arrived as we were looking for now Abraham's seed Royal seed that was a natural seed this is a royal seed when the national seed got their sign they they rejected it so have well nothing but the Royal seeds still that church seed rejected again they've always done it but notice what kind of a sign was it let's just look see what the super sign was there was a man came up three of them and did you notice when when Abraham saw three men coming he went out he said my Lord will you pass by me come in and sit down let me fetch a little water and wash your feet and take a marshall of bread then go about your business he saw three coming and called the three one lord lock the church nominal down down there in Sodom he saw two coming and he said my lords Abraham knowed these 3r1 there's actually only one of them watched two of them went in and Sodom and the one stayed with him he said my Lord notice the one that stayed with him Abraham being a type of the called out not in Sodom the elected for that hour now remember the Gentiles were fixing to be burned just like it is now the Gentile world is to be destroyed by fire we know that I watched the super sign God came down in a form of a man and performed a sign with his back turned to the tent and asked where Sarah was and Abraham said she's in the tent behind you and he said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life watch that eye see I will visit you and while she didn't call him Abram just a few days before that he was Abram but God changed his name in the spirit talking to him but here's God in flesh had just eat a calf that Abraham killed drinking the milk from the cow and eat bread think of it a man Dusty clothes dirty feet amen God you say it wasn't God Abraham said it was he said it was Elohim the one that created the heavens and the Earth the all-sufficient one God in a human form amen and he performed a sign to Abraham to let him know that at the Gentile world wasn't in and he was that supersede he said where is Sarah said she's in the tent behind you he said I'm going to visit you according to time of life and Sarah did something she kind of laughed he said why did Sarah laugh saying these things can't be he perceived the thoughts that was in Sarah's mind in the tent behind him and he knew that was God now look Jesus when he come on the earth he was that super seed and when he come he declared to the people the very same thing is that right now knowing that this end time was coming and said the things that I do shall you the same because God said I'm going to give you an eternal Everlasting sign amen there's a super sign look at the track of the church it's come up through Luther Wesley Pentecostal denominations we've had Revelations and all other kinds of things we had speaking in tongues we've had gifts of healing we have everything manifested but look right at the end time before the burning and to destroy the super sign appears mysteriously right on the scene again before us amen God himself not a man but God faith manifests a super sign on Everlasting sign an eternal sign a super sign God manifested In the Flesh same sign that his son did his super son promised the same at the end as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man the super sign will return we've had all these other things the path of Abraham's Royal seat has come up that same path and Abraham come up but just before the destroying of the world the super sign must appear again on Eternal Everlasting Resurrection sign that proves that the Royal seed could not be killed like Daniel and like the rest of the prophets was the grave couldn't hold him because he the others conquered the gates of the enemy such as fire and lion and sword and so forth they conquered that but this Royal seed conquered death hell in the grave nothing could hold him why he's an everlasting super sign that is a super sign the resurrection of Jesus Christ after being dead for 2 000 years still stands in the midst of us the same as he did there manifesting himself in his church in human now she's the same yesterday today and forever hey man a virgin shall conceive and from that time God and that'll be one United together an everlasting Eternal sign a super sign he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today you may ask me how an oily as he lives within my heart I see him Among Us all of his elected seed will see it yes sir the elected in his day saw it the predestinated got to see it in the midst of unbelief they still believed it they set right amongst unbelievers and still confessed it publicly there you are the Son of God of the king of Israel home right amongst thousands of unbelievers one man by the name of Simon Peter walked out he said your name is Simon and you're the son of Joseph what was that that super sign that was a prophet sitting there that was a super sign and Simon Peter accepted it regardless of what anybody said a big old husky uh bully become a Meek lamb before god notice that was Nathaniel a teacher a scholar indeed who believed God and uh Philip went over and brought him back from this his City brought him over when he come Lord Jesus was standing Jesus said behold and Israelite indeed in whom there is no God he said Rabbi when did you know me this is astonishing I've heard my great great great great grandfathers talk about so and so on so and so way back I never heard of him how'd you know me Jesus said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you I super sign amen priests and rabbis is finished there was God's Eternal super sign yes he had to go by Samaria remember his three races of people ham Sam and japheth's people he went by the Samaritans there come a little woman out at the well to get some water Jesus as soon as he spoke to her he said bring me a drink she said you have nothing to draw with and so forth that a conversation went on and talked about the racial problem and so forth hey to what he said to her go get your husband and come here now she said this man's trying to get smart with me see I don't have any husbands that you've told the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband super sign listen at her sir I perceive that thou art a prophet super sign a manifestation of the word for that day watch you're a prophet but I don't see in the Bible where any prophet's supposed to be at this time but we are looking for the Messiah and when he comes he will manifest God's promise word that poor little woman mode more about God than half the preachers of the day in that estate why she was predestinated to it when that light struck at that seed come to life and hide it no look at Nathanael he didn't care he didn't care who stood there he stood right before his priest and all said Rabbi you're the Son of God you are the king of Israel that we look for he saw the super sign there's still a woman in the midst of all the trouble she's in run down through the city and said come see a man that's told me what I've done isn't this the very Messiah isn't that what we're looking for supersonic now remember the Gentiles never got it then but they're kept they're receiving because God can't change his continuity he has to remember he promised it he said he would do it he promised he would do it and in the last days he would do it Jesus said so as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man where promised in the last days according to Malachi 4 that someone would raise up in the last days that would try to bring back and Shake back all the coldness and all the traditions and things and restore the faith of the people back to the apostolic fathers again to the original word yes you said that was a that was Elijah and John oh no not Elijah in John's time was Malachi 3 ma Sam I miss you before my Feast because immediately after this prophecy went forth the whole world was burned up two thousand years has passed the world wasn't burnt up and the righteous walk out on the dust of the of the ashes of the wicked brother and sister we are living in the days of supermarkets super jets super highways super races super everything else and there is a super sign we've had the sign of religion we've had the sign of Revival we've had the sign of getting together we've had the sign of speaking in tongues we've had the sign of Healing The Sick we've had all these signs but yet we find in the Bible that the last sign before the promised Sun arrived it was a super sign Jesus said as it was then before the promised sun arise again that super sign would come on the Earth again I declare it to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ it's on earth now not only that but it's right here among us tonight the Holy Ghost God's super signed the resurrected Jesus Christ it cannot fail it's an eternal sign it can never be changed heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never change it's an eternal Everlasting sign God manifested in human flesh may God made himself known in human flesh you leave that to be the truth with all your heart you believe in don't shut yourself up like a turtle in a shell if there's any Turtle you take the shell out let the Holy Spirit come in don't close yourself to some Creed or denomination brother sister the hour has arrived I believe that God's done as much as he's going to do the next thing is action of the church or either we're going to be lost I just asked anybody to dispute that to be so I've asked it around around the world and not one time as everybody anybody ever tried it they know better no better because it's a word they want to accept it if it's a time don't put it off too long many people wanted to accept Jesus they thought they'd do it in some other convenient time once said they won't accept Christ but they put it off too long some of them tried to get him off their hands and tried to wash it off of the water pass the buck on to somebody else but it backfired it's on your hands tonight don't write back in your lap Hebrews 13 8 regardless of how many counselor churches we have Still Remains as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever works that I do if it if his life is in you it'll manifest Jesus Christ amen now you all can't be that one but you can be a part of that with your faith all of them couldn't be a Jesus when there's on Earth but they could believe him and accept the message there was one Moses one Elijah one Noah on down always been that but the rest of them could accept it and they would have had no Ministry and there should be somebody believe it Jesus would have had no Ministry lest somebody believed it Paul would have had no Ministry let somebody believe it the Holy Ghost has got no Ministry by the word today unless somebody's willing to get away from their Creed and come back to the word again no matter how well it sure and how real a chair it's here now I know it's here I feel it I know it's here the word says it's your wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'm in the midst of them I truly believe that he's here the same yesterday today and forever amen oh my it wasn't that beautiful just just think and as you know brother Brandon would go on and prove this over and over again by turning his back to the audience by Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and say what what was the final sign it was God veiled in human flesh speaking to us the words of Truth um and and we can certainly see and understand that this is the way that God chose to speak to his church and so I just trust that that was a a blessing to you tonight I I just I'll never drive down the road again and look at a great big gigantic house and ever look at it the same I'll just see there's a poor man that's trying to do everything to get back to what his original state was and that's what man's trying to do to get back to their original state because they're Fallen and they want to get back to their original state and but you can only get back by the way that God provides for you to get back there wasn't a wide open Choice there was a way I am the way the truth the life no man comes unto the father but by me and what was that way it was a super sign have you ever had the the scripture of possessing the gates of the enemy ever explained so more perfect than that how they possessed all the gates every time there's a something that stopped you from your possession a gate that Satan rose up whether it be water whether it be fire whether it be this and there was one last gate and that was death and he possessed that gate and now we know we can possess the gates of our enemies anything that's standing between you and God you can possess that what a beautiful explanation of the scripture and so we find that that when a man's building these big houses they're trying to build some because there's something in them calling because they want to get back and and this is what Malachi 4 5 was Luke 17 30 wherever I will restore the faith I will restore the way back to them and that way was the way that God provided in this day through the ministry of the son of man and there's no other way to get there isn't that beautiful isn't it just wonderful and you've been privileged to have the isab to see it it can only be revealed to the predestinated don't be ashamed of this gospel it's the life I I know a lot of people they don't like the product that the message produces so they try to change the product let me tell you the product of this message is the rapture that's what this message is going to produce it's going to produce a Rapture for the church God bless you tonight I hope you enjoyed the word
