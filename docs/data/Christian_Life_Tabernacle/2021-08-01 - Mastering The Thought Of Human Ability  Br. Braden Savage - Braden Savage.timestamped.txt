[1:00:51] certainly
[1:00:52] is a privilege to be here amen in texas
[1:00:55] with you to preach the word of the lord
[1:00:57] and
[1:00:58] we certainly uh got to meet brother
[1:01:00] david
[1:01:01] i don't know three or four months ago
[1:01:03] and and actually i
[1:01:04] actually met him for the first time at
[1:01:06] brother harold brown's funeral
[1:01:08] and then he come up and preached a
[1:01:10] meeting there at my at our pastors
[1:01:12] at our church here brother ivey's uh in
[1:01:14] missouri and uh
[1:01:16] got to talk and just i've always
[1:01:18] respected brother david
[1:01:19] loved his ministry and and just a
[1:01:22] special person you have a
[1:01:24] wonderful pastor amen and i know you
[1:01:26] know that this morning so
[1:01:28] amen we'll just get right into the word
[1:01:30] of the lord if you'll turn with me to
[1:01:31] hebrews chapter 11.
[1:01:34] we'll start with verse 32.
[1:01:37] we'll read two verses there and then
[1:01:38] we'll turn over to second corinthians
[1:01:40] chapter 12.
[1:01:43] i certainly don't come with any new
[1:01:45] revelation this morning i
[1:01:47] i don't have none of that and i
[1:01:49] certainly
[1:01:50] don't come to preach to you anything
[1:01:52] that you haven't already heard
[1:01:54] but we just want to stir up our minds by
[1:01:56] the way of remembrance this morning
[1:01:58] amen that something something might just
[1:02:00] draw us closer to him
[1:02:02] amen and and
[1:02:05] i always try to uh
[1:02:08] find something that that will help me
[1:02:10] too because if i can't
[1:02:12] if i can't be helped by what the lord
[1:02:14] has given me then i know it won't help
[1:02:15] you
[1:02:16] so we have to uh we have to put
[1:02:18] ourselves in this
[1:02:19] in these uh in this message so
[1:02:22] i certainly certainly uh
[1:02:25] certainly am speaking to myself this
[1:02:27] morning and the things that i want to
[1:02:29] speak on today
[1:02:30] uh i've been studying on and been
[1:02:33] thinking
[1:02:34] about for quite some time now and
[1:02:36] preached at home
[1:02:37] on it several times and different
[1:02:40] different uh
[1:02:41] titles and different things but yet it's
[1:02:43] just something that's been on my heart
[1:02:45] i think some a place that we need to be
[1:02:48] as
[1:02:48] christians and believers as as we're
[1:02:51] maturing
[1:02:52] in the word i think it's time that uh
[1:02:55] you know that we just don't stay down
[1:02:58] here no more but it's time to
[1:02:59] come up here so may the lord just bless
[1:03:02] you this morning
[1:03:03] and help me and calm my nerves this
[1:03:05] morning i'm not used to standing in this
[1:03:07] in front of this many people so i'm a
[1:03:10] little nervous this morning so you just
[1:03:11] bear with me this morning
[1:03:13] hebrews chapter 11 start with verse 32
[1:03:17] and what shall i more say for the time
[1:03:20] would fail me to tell of gideon and of
[1:03:23] barrick
[1:03:24] of samson and japheth david also and
[1:03:28] samuel and of the prophets who
[1:03:31] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[1:03:34] wrought righteousness
[1:03:35] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[1:03:38] lions
[1:03:40] they quenched the violence of fire
[1:03:41] escaped the edge of the sword
[1:03:43] how did they do it out of weakness
[1:03:47] were made strong waxed violent in flight
[1:03:50] turned the turn to flight the armies
[1:03:54] of the aliens now turn with me to second
[1:03:56] corinthians
[1:03:57] chapter 12. we'll start with verse 1.
[1:04:03] and we'll just read down through about
[1:04:05] verse 10 and have your seats this
[1:04:10] morning
[1:04:16] paul's speaking here he says it is not
[1:04:19] expedient which that word means
[1:04:21] profitable it's not profitable
[1:04:23] for me doubtless to glory i will come to
[1:04:26] visions and revelations of the lord
[1:04:28] i knew a man in christ above 14 years
[1:04:31] ago
[1:04:32] whether in the body i cannot tell or
[1:04:34] whether out of the body
[1:04:36] i cannot tell god knoweth such a one
[1:04:39] caught up to the third heaven and i knew
[1:04:41] such a man whether in the body or out of
[1:04:43] the body i cannot tell
[1:04:45] god knoweth how that he was caught up
[1:04:47] into paradise
[1:04:48] and heard unspeakable words which it is
[1:04:52] not lawful for man to utter of such a
[1:04:55] one will i glory
[1:04:56] yet of myself i will not glory
[1:05:00] but in my infirmities for though i would
[1:05:03] desire to glory
[1:05:04] i shall not be a fool for i will
[1:05:08] say the truth but now i forbear for bear
[1:05:10] lest any man should think of me
[1:05:12] above that which he seeth me to be
[1:05:15] or that he heareth of me and lest i
[1:05:18] should be exalted above measure through
[1:05:20] the abundance of revelation
[1:05:22] there was given to me a thorn in the
[1:05:24] flesh messenger from satan to buffet me
[1:05:28] lest i should be exalted above measure
[1:05:32] for this thing i besought the lord
[1:05:33] thrice that it might depart from me
[1:05:36] my what is what a statement and he said
[1:05:39] unto me
[1:05:41] the the the lord spoke to him and said
[1:05:44] my grace
[1:05:45] is sufficient for thee for my strength
[1:05:49] is made perfect in weakness
[1:05:53] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:05:55] glory in my infirmities
[1:05:58] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:06:00] me
[1:06:01] therefore oh that what what the lord
[1:06:04] spoke to him
[1:06:05] changed his whole attitude he said
[1:06:07] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:06:10] in reproaches in necessities and
[1:06:12] persecutions
[1:06:14] in distresses for christ's sake for when
[1:06:16] i am
[1:06:17] weak then i am strong may god bless his
[1:06:20] word you can be seated
[1:06:22] this morning i could say this morning
[1:06:25] that
[1:06:26] paul he had found the key that unlocked
[1:06:29] the power of god being able to work
[1:06:32] through all mankind
[1:06:33] amen and i want to title the message
[1:06:35] this morning
[1:06:37] mastering the thought of human ability
[1:06:40] i believe er to me one of the greatest
[1:06:43] messages that
[1:06:44] our messenger to this age ever preached
[1:06:47] was
[1:06:47] was a message called perfect strength by
[1:06:50] perfect weakness
[1:06:52] amen and you know uh people there's a
[1:06:55] lot of people that might uh
[1:06:57] turn me off on this what uh what i'm
[1:06:59] fixing to say but
[1:07:00] but just follow me here this morning as
[1:07:02] we go through this
[1:07:04] you know the seals were great messages
[1:07:06] and uh
[1:07:07] some of the most anointing uh messages
[1:07:10] that was ever preached was the seals how
[1:07:11] many can say amen to that
[1:07:13] amen they were wonderful messages and we
[1:07:15] needed them
[1:07:16] amen we we we needed all those loose
[1:07:19] sins that the prophet of god talked
[1:07:20] about
[1:07:21] we needed uh we needed all those things
[1:07:24] we needed all those things
[1:07:25] amen to come together and know the real
[1:07:27] truth about them
[1:07:28] amen and it took those seals the
[1:07:31] breaking of those seals to
[1:07:32] to to see all those things but but to to
[1:07:35] me
[1:07:36] one of the greatest messages that he
[1:07:38] ever spoke was perfect strength by
[1:07:39] perfect weakness
[1:07:40] amen and you know you can roll these
[1:07:43] things over and over in your mind again
[1:07:45] but
[1:07:46] let's just look at how brother branham
[1:07:48] approach these seven seals and we can we
[1:07:50] can see
[1:07:51] amen where i'm going with this this
[1:07:53] morning amen before he
[1:07:55] before he started the seven seals amen
[1:07:57] and the breach
[1:07:59] he comes out and he preaches a message
[1:08:01] called amen he preaches a message
[1:08:03] and i just went back he he preaches a
[1:08:05] message called
[1:08:06] god hidden in simplicity
[1:08:10] amen why would he come out right before
[1:08:13] these great supernatural seals
[1:08:15] amen and preach his message god hiding
[1:08:17] himself
[1:08:18] in simplicity and then when the seals
[1:08:20] were all over
[1:08:22] he comes right back again amen and
[1:08:24] preaches the same message again
[1:08:26] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:08:29] revealing himself
[1:08:30] in the same way amen so he's he's
[1:08:33] showing us something
[1:08:34] amen that that to be able to receive
[1:08:37] amen what the seals
[1:08:38] was bringing forth amen we were going to
[1:08:41] have to get ourselves in a place
[1:08:43] amen to be able to receive what god was
[1:08:46] trying to tell us
[1:08:47] amen that that we can't we can't come
[1:08:50] amen to god and receive revelation amen
[1:08:53] thinking that we're somebody special or
[1:08:55] or that we've got uh some great
[1:08:57] revelation or
[1:08:58] that we're a great preacher or we're a
[1:09:00] great a song leader or we're a great
[1:09:02] this that or the other
[1:09:04] or that we're just in the message hey
[1:09:06] man bless god
[1:09:07] i'm favored among all people no friends
[1:09:10] we're only
[1:09:10] favored among amen the world amen
[1:09:13] because god's grace
[1:09:14] amen that drop down in our lives that's
[1:09:17] the only reason
[1:09:18] that we're favored among people amen
[1:09:20] mary
[1:09:21] amen the angel spoke to her and said
[1:09:23] you're highly favored married
[1:09:25] amen but it wasn't nothing that mary
[1:09:27] done amen but it was god's
[1:09:29] choosing amen that made her highly
[1:09:31] favored
[1:09:32] and it's god's choosing amen that god
[1:09:35] allowed us
[1:09:35] to to be able to sit here this morning
[1:09:38] amen in a message church in a message
[1:09:40] pew
[1:09:41] and be able to hear amen a divine word
[1:09:44] from god
[1:09:45] amen speak directly to our hearts amen
[1:09:48] it's not nothing that we done so why
[1:09:50] should we boast
[1:09:51] amen within ourselves but it's the grace
[1:09:53] of god that's been given to us
[1:09:55] amen in that we boast but we don't boast
[1:09:58] within ourselves
[1:10:00] amen so he was trying to get a point
[1:10:02] across amen to the people that
[1:10:04] that in jesus's day amen god bypassed
[1:10:08] the nobles that
[1:10:09] that thought they knew amen the word
[1:10:10] they they studied the scrolls day in the
[1:10:13] pharisees they
[1:10:14] they they were great religious leaders
[1:10:16] and you know
[1:10:17] as far as they're outside you couldn't
[1:10:20] put a you couldn't put a pen upon them
[1:10:22] nowhere because
[1:10:23] they were perfect they lived right they
[1:10:24] were they were holy on the
[1:10:26] inside on the on the outside but jesus
[1:10:29] said but on the inside you're full of
[1:10:31] dead man bones
[1:10:32] amen so god doesn't necessarily see amen
[1:10:36] what's on the outside but he sees what's
[1:10:38] in the heart
[1:10:38] amen of man and that's what he judges
[1:10:41] amen every one of us by this morning
[1:10:43] amen is what's in our heart amen but
[1:10:46] he didn't come to those religious
[1:10:48] leaders amen in that day that that
[1:10:50] thought they knew it all
[1:10:52] he bypassed the nobles he bypassed all
[1:10:55] those
[1:10:55] amen but he come to those who were
[1:10:58] rejected
[1:10:59] and cast out amen there was nothing in
[1:11:01] the world
[1:11:03] amen i think of it church amen that you
[1:11:06] think of
[1:11:07] mary magdalene who had seven devils amen
[1:11:10] it was and was possessed with devils you
[1:11:12] think of legion
[1:11:13] amen that jesus would go all the way
[1:11:15] across the sea
[1:11:17] amen to save one's soul amen i tell you
[1:11:19] church
[1:11:20] he didn't come to the high and mighties
[1:11:22] he come to those who needed him
[1:11:24] he come to those amen who were nothing
[1:11:26] within ourselves
[1:11:27] nothing of this world those are who he
[1:11:29] come to
[1:11:30] oh just let me be one of those this
[1:11:32] morning don't
[1:11:33] don't let me be one of those amen in the
[1:11:36] ma in our own ranks
[1:11:38] you know and this is what's on my heart
[1:11:40] here this morning
[1:11:41] amen and so so please don't take offense
[1:11:43] to
[1:11:44] to these things but let's just open up
[1:11:46] our hearts this morning and
[1:11:48] and see what god has for us you know
[1:11:51] i believe that if the prophet of god was
[1:11:54] standing here today
[1:11:56] amen and preaching that he would not
[1:11:58] have to be he wouldn't be hammering the
[1:12:00] pentecostals anymore
[1:12:02] he wouldn't be hammering the baptist in
[1:12:03] the nominal world no more
[1:12:05] but he would be having to deal with his
[1:12:08] own
[1:12:08] issues amen in the own ranks of the
[1:12:11] message of the hour
[1:12:13] amen because amen let's be honest with
[1:12:15] ourselves church
[1:12:16] amen we have received a message amen as
[1:12:19] paul received a message
[1:12:21] amen and we've been lifted up into a
[1:12:23] sphere amen that may be
[1:12:25] no other denomination has ever been
[1:12:27] lifted up to
[1:12:28] amen no other pentecostal church has
[1:12:30] ever been lifted up to
[1:12:32] and it's so easy amen for us to get
[1:12:34] puffed up
[1:12:36] but god can't deal with us when we're
[1:12:39] puffed up
[1:12:39] he can't deal with us even when we're
[1:12:42] all about ourselves
[1:12:43] i go to the greatest church in the
[1:12:45] message i go to this church
[1:12:47] i believe this if you don't see it my
[1:12:49] way then you're out of the message
[1:12:51] god don't come to those kind of people
[1:12:53] he comes to those who are rejected
[1:12:55] and who realize they're nothing that's
[1:12:57] the kind of people he comes to
[1:13:02] amen so i've been been studying this and
[1:13:07] to me it's just it's just outstanding
[1:13:10] that god would do these things and
[1:13:12] brother branham says this and this is
[1:13:14] where i got the
[1:13:15] the the title from he said there's one
[1:13:18] thing that we've got to master if we
[1:13:20] expect to fulfill
[1:13:21] god's desire in our life
[1:13:24] amen how many here desires amen to
[1:13:28] fulfill god's desire in your own life
[1:13:30] amen we all are here this morning
[1:13:33] and we all have a purpose amen that god
[1:13:36] brought us to this world for
[1:13:38] it's more than your natural job it's
[1:13:41] more than maybe just raising your
[1:13:42] natural family
[1:13:44] but god's got us here for a specific
[1:13:46] reason for a specific purpose
[1:13:49] amen and he wants to see his own desires
[1:13:53] amen fulfilled through you and i this
[1:13:55] morning
[1:13:56] so he says there's one thing that we've
[1:13:58] got to master
[1:13:59] if we expect to fulfill god's desire in
[1:14:02] our life
[1:14:03] that is we have to master the thought of
[1:14:06] human ability
[1:14:09] oh and he goes on and he says if we ever
[1:14:11] get to a spot
[1:14:13] where we think that we can do it with
[1:14:15] our own intelligence
[1:14:17] and our own abilities we've got to
[1:14:21] master that in such a way
[1:14:23] amen that we can get rid of the thing
[1:14:25] and lay it aside
[1:14:26] so that god can use us now brother
[1:14:29] branham in this message you'll find if
[1:14:31] you go back and you listen to it
[1:14:32] brother branham used dwight moody in
[1:14:34] this and he began to talk about dwight
[1:14:37] moody how he was ignorant he was
[1:14:38] unlearned
[1:14:39] amen he was insignificant in itself but
[1:14:41] brother branham put him in
[1:14:43] with god one of god's heroes and he said
[1:14:46] he was god's hero
[1:14:48] and he said but but if dwight moody amen
[1:14:50] you know they got the moody college out
[1:14:52] there they got the wesleyan college they
[1:14:54] got the lutheran college
[1:14:55] he said but you know he said if dwight
[1:14:58] moody would come back
[1:14:59] from the grave and come back amen the
[1:15:02] first thing he would do
[1:15:03] is get rid of the moody college
[1:15:08] so brother brandon goes on and he he
[1:15:10] explains it
[1:15:11] he talks it like he talks to to you like
[1:15:14] you know that
[1:15:15] that you know here this college is and
[1:15:18] he said dwight moody never started the
[1:15:20] college
[1:15:20] he was god's hero but it was the man
[1:15:23] after
[1:15:24] dwight moody left the scene amen they
[1:15:26] thought that they got to secure
[1:15:28] amen this great revelation amen that was
[1:15:31] brought through to what moody
[1:15:33] amen so they started a school they began
[1:15:35] to put their own ideas to it
[1:15:37] and god left them right then amen church
[1:15:41] i'm afraid amen in in our own ranks that
[1:15:44] if we're not careful
[1:15:45] amen ichabod will be rid over our hearts
[1:15:49] amen because we have let our
[1:15:51] intelligence
[1:15:52] take the place of spirit given
[1:15:54] revelation
[1:16:01] this is why this is why that
[1:16:06] men that have preached this gospel for
[1:16:08] years
[1:16:09] and all of a sudden they don't believe
[1:16:11] it no more
[1:16:14] they just turn away from it amen they
[1:16:16] don't even see it no why
[1:16:18] not in that way anymore and matter of
[1:16:20] fact now they're building their churches
[1:16:22] back
[1:16:23] amen from the people that that didn't go
[1:16:25] with them now they're building their
[1:16:27] churches back
[1:16:28] amen to disprove amen brother branham
[1:16:31] and the message of the hour it shows
[1:16:34] that and some of them
[1:16:35] amen they could preach you into a corner
[1:16:38] amen and they could preach like a
[1:16:40] house on fire in a windy day amen and
[1:16:42] they could teach it they could lay it
[1:16:44] out
[1:16:44] amen from genesis to revelations from 47
[1:16:47] to 65
[1:16:48] amen they could teach it the best to the
[1:16:51] best
[1:16:52] amen but it shows that all those years
[1:16:54] amen of learning
[1:16:56] it was nothing but head knowledge and
[1:16:58] never spirit given revelation
[1:17:01] if it was spirit given revelation it
[1:17:03] would change their lives
[1:17:04] it would have caused them to stay humble
[1:17:06] amen and dig deeper
[1:17:08] and deeper into the word of god
[1:17:14] something's lacking that i believe in my
[1:17:17] heart that needs to get back into the
[1:17:18] church again
[1:17:22] we've been on this road most of us now
[1:17:24] for many years
[1:17:26] myself i've i've i was raised in this
[1:17:28] message
[1:17:31] but there come a time that i needed an
[1:17:33] individual
[1:17:34] walk with god
[1:17:38] hey man i couldn't go on mama's religion
[1:17:40] no more
[1:17:41] i couldn't go on daddy's religion no
[1:17:43] more something had to change in my heart
[1:17:47] oh i could quote the scripture i could
[1:17:49] quote this i could quote the quotes even
[1:17:51] when i was lost
[1:17:52] amen but let me tell you there was
[1:17:54] nothing there to give life behind it
[1:17:57] amen and it's time that the word amen is
[1:18:00] not just in letter form no more
[1:18:02] but it is revealed and manifested
[1:18:04] through the hearts and lives of his
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:11] hey man moab most of us now has been on
[1:18:14] the road for many years
[1:18:16] and knowing what the message says is not
[1:18:18] something that we don't know
[1:18:21] is that right for most of us we know
[1:18:24] what the message says
[1:18:26] most everyone can pick a topic and the
[1:18:28] quotes begin immediately to come
[1:18:32] we can spit them out faster than a
[1:18:33] machine gun can or a copy or can
[1:18:35] copy them off on paper
[1:18:39] is that right brother branham said this
[1:18:42] and brother branham said that
[1:18:43] we can tell the day and the year amen
[1:18:46] and where he preached it at and
[1:18:47] whether it was the morning service or
[1:18:49] the evening service
[1:18:51] amen we can tell what city it was
[1:18:53] preached in we can tell all these things
[1:18:55] and what page and what paragraph
[1:18:57] in the seals book of the church age book
[1:18:59] amen but where is the life
[1:19:02] amen where is the grain today church
[1:19:05] amen it's not
[1:19:06] supposed to just stay in the word or
[1:19:09] letter form
[1:19:10] it's supposed to come out in the hearts
[1:19:13] and lives of the people
[1:19:19] you see it's become head knowledge
[1:19:22] instead of spirit given revelation and
[1:19:24] many times it's confused between the two
[1:19:28] let me tell you this the word is a
[1:19:30] living word amen
[1:19:32] the letter killeth the bible says but
[1:19:34] the spirit giveth life
[1:19:36] amen we're living in the time where the
[1:19:38] word must be on display
[1:19:41] it's not good enough to say i have the
[1:19:44] token
[1:19:44] it's not good enough to say yes it's
[1:19:47] here amen
[1:19:48] but it's time that it has to be on
[1:19:50] display
[1:19:53] back in the days of egypt amen when the
[1:19:56] death angel was fixing to pass by
[1:19:58] amen the angel of the lord told them
[1:20:00] they said kill the lamb
[1:20:02] amen prepare it amen and take the blood
[1:20:05] amen take the blood and put it over the
[1:20:08] doorpost
[1:20:09] amen of your home amen
[1:20:12] so what good would it have done for him
[1:20:14] to say i've got the word
[1:20:16] amen i've got the blood i believe i'll
[1:20:18] just leave it in the basin
[1:20:19] and inside the house the death angel
[1:20:22] would have came
[1:20:23] amen and killed amen the firstborn
[1:20:26] but the the blood had to be on display
[1:20:30] and the blood the bleeding word in this
[1:20:33] day
[1:20:33] has to be on display in our hearts amen
[1:20:37] it's got to be living manifesting itself
[1:20:40] through our very lives
[1:20:43] it's not good enough to be able to quote
[1:20:44] the message and the bible
[1:20:46] it must be able to live through us and
[1:20:49] we don't have to try we don't have to
[1:20:51] manufacture
[1:20:52] if god the holy spirit is on the inside
[1:20:54] of us and he's leading us
[1:20:56] and guiding us it will produce itself
[1:20:59] it will come out naturally we don't have
[1:21:02] to try to manufacture it
[1:21:04] a sheep is not ass amen to manufacture
[1:21:07] woe
[1:21:08] amen but he he brings forth wool because
[1:21:11] he is a sheep
[1:21:13] amen we are not ass amen you got to do
[1:21:16] this
[1:21:17] you got to do that you got to do this
[1:21:19] here and this over here
[1:21:20] amen because we are the blood-bought
[1:21:23] sons and daughters of god
[1:21:24] we bring forth the word because it's
[1:21:27] living bread to us
[1:21:28] it's inside of us and it's what we are
[1:21:38] it's hard to find people
[1:21:42] that you can just sit down and
[1:21:43] fellowship with and enjoy talking about
[1:21:45] the word
[1:21:46] without them saying oh i know that well
[1:21:48] i know that yeah yeah yeah
[1:21:50] yeah brother brown said this 1947 he
[1:21:54] said
[1:21:56] they know what brother brown said and
[1:21:58] they want you to know that they know
[1:21:59] what brother brown said
[1:22:04] they pride themselves with the fact that
[1:22:07] they know
[1:22:10] and it's confused with spirit given
[1:22:12] revelation
[1:22:15] i heard something brother biscuit said
[1:22:17] years ago
[1:22:19] that he made a statement that has stuck
[1:22:21] with me all these years
[1:22:23] he said god-given revelation will line
[1:22:25] up with the word
[1:22:27] and it will not exalt you and make you
[1:22:29] puffed up in yourselves
[1:22:31] amen it will actually humble you to
[1:22:34] where
[1:22:34] you realize you are nothing and true
[1:22:37] revelation
[1:22:38] that comes from god it never comes to a
[1:22:40] person unless it changes that person's
[1:22:43] life
[1:22:47] and i find that statement is very very
[1:22:49] scriptural
[1:22:51] amen paul we read from was a very
[1:22:54] educated man
[1:22:56] according to the church world paul had
[1:22:58] all the credentials
[1:23:00] hey man that he needed he could have
[1:23:01] went anywhere in the world
[1:23:03] and held a worldwide meeting
[1:23:07] because he had all the the religious
[1:23:10] sect backing him up
[1:23:13] he was a great man to the world
[1:23:16] he was taught by the best of the best
[1:23:18] teachers gamaya
[1:23:22] he knew all the greek meanings and was
[1:23:25] taught how to speak with great eloquence
[1:23:29] but when he was converted
[1:23:32] for god to be able to use him he had to
[1:23:36] lay every bit of education
[1:23:38] and every bit of human uh human ability
[1:23:40] aside
[1:23:41] or else god could not use him
[1:23:45] brother branham in this message he says
[1:23:48] i know this is an unusual title
[1:23:50] amongst pentecostal people he says
[1:23:53] because your
[1:23:54] you pentecost are always testifying how
[1:23:56] strong you are
[1:23:59] amen and i feel the same way today
[1:24:01] within our own ranks
[1:24:03] amen we pride ourselves that we're in
[1:24:05] the message
[1:24:06] but it's the message in you amen is the
[1:24:09] message living out through you
[1:24:13] amen you say
[1:24:16] you say well i'm in the message well
[1:24:19] that's great
[1:24:21] that's not a very good witnessing tool
[1:24:22] though
[1:24:25] because when you go out into the when
[1:24:26] you go out into dallas and fort worth
[1:24:28] area here
[1:24:29] amen and somebody says uh you look
[1:24:32] different
[1:24:32] uh uh tell me tell me tell me why you
[1:24:34] looked at it well god sent a prophet
[1:24:39] i'm in the message i go to brother david
[1:24:42] mcgary's church
[1:24:45] or i go to brother ivey's church in
[1:24:47] missouri
[1:24:49] what are you telling them people want to
[1:24:51] see a living god
[1:24:54] amen and you don't have to say many
[1:24:56] words when they see a living god
[1:24:58] amen what was the man that said amen
[1:25:01] preach always use words when necessary
[1:25:05] amen amen let my life ring out the life
[1:25:08] of jesus christ
[1:25:12] you say well i've messed up you know i i
[1:25:15] i
[1:25:16] i see where i didn't live out the life
[1:25:18] here i didn't live out the life here
[1:25:19] listen church we're humans
[1:25:22] we're humans and we're gonna have to
[1:25:25] deal with this human flesh until we
[1:25:27] leave this world
[1:25:28] amen amen but listen church amen what is
[1:25:32] your motive what is your desire
[1:25:34] that's down in the heart amen
[1:25:37] amen listen let me just tell you amen
[1:25:39] i've been thinking about this and
[1:25:42] and and studying on this as well amen do
[1:25:44] you realize that when noah
[1:25:46] amen here he was and he was floating
[1:25:48] along in 40 days
[1:25:49] the rain the rain came and it stopped
[1:25:52] and
[1:25:52] noah wanted to see you know if there was
[1:25:55] any land that he could that he could go
[1:25:57] out upon so he sends out two birds
[1:26:00] amen they roosted amen in the same room
[1:26:03] together
[1:26:04] think about it now amen one was a crow a
[1:26:07] raven
[1:26:07] and the other one was a dove amen
[1:26:11] they both roosted together they both
[1:26:14] heard
[1:26:14] noah preach
[1:26:18] and noah takes these two birds he sends
[1:26:21] out the raven
[1:26:22] and the raven never comes back
[1:26:26] now remember god totally utterly
[1:26:29] destroyed the earth he only saved noah
[1:26:31] in his family
[1:26:32] amen so there was dead bodies floating
[1:26:35] everywhere
[1:26:36] human bodies animal bodies amen that
[1:26:39] crow was having himself a jubilee
[1:26:42] he was having himself a time because not
[1:26:44] only could he eat on what noah was
[1:26:46] preaching
[1:26:47] but he could eat upon all the dead
[1:26:49] things of the world
[1:26:52] is that right amen so here this crow was
[1:26:55] he was having himself a jubilee but he
[1:26:58] sends out the dove
[1:27:01] but it wasn't long that the dove he came
[1:27:04] back to the ark
[1:27:06] amen amen why did he come back to the
[1:27:08] yard
[1:27:09] because he couldn't eat upon just
[1:27:11] anything
[1:27:12] he couldn't eat upon the dead caring of
[1:27:14] the world he had to come back
[1:27:16] and hear noah's food amen the revealed
[1:27:19] truth of the hour
[1:27:21] so let me tell you friends the dove
[1:27:23] represents the holy ghost
[1:27:25] amen living inside of us we may leave
[1:27:28] the ark
[1:27:28] amen temporarily we may have a fault
[1:27:31] here and a fault here
[1:27:32] we may backslide temporarily but we're
[1:27:35] coming back to the ark
[1:27:37] because god is living on the inside of
[1:27:39] us there's something in us
[1:27:41] that we can't feed upon the things of
[1:27:43] the world that we've got to come back to
[1:27:45] noah we've got to come back to what the
[1:27:47] revealed truth
[1:27:48] is speaking to our hearts we're not
[1:27:51] satisfied on
[1:27:52] a baptist denomination we're not
[1:27:54] satisfied
[1:27:55] upon message amen ideas and creeds
[1:27:58] we want to reveal truth of the word of
[1:28:01] the hour
[1:28:02] amen and we come back to that
[1:28:06] is that okay this morning
[1:28:10] i have family uncles they were raised in
[1:28:14] this message
[1:28:16] and you know they've been out of
[1:28:20] been out of church for a long time and i
[1:28:23] don't know
[1:28:23] seven or eight years ago they thought
[1:28:26] that they would
[1:28:27] try to get back in church so they go
[1:28:29] down to the baptist church
[1:28:31] or they join up with them hey man
[1:28:33] everything looks good for a while
[1:28:35] but all sudden they quit
[1:28:39] you know why because they know
[1:28:42] that that is not real food they see the
[1:28:45] deceitfulness
[1:28:46] just because they were grown up in it
[1:28:48] they know it's not for them
[1:28:50] amen there's something greater let me
[1:28:53] tell you here this morning
[1:28:54] there's something greater amen amen that
[1:28:57] we're feeding upon
[1:28:58] then what the world's got we're not
[1:29:01] waiting upon it it's here
[1:29:08] human ability if it was true revelation
[1:29:13] from god
[1:29:14] it would constantly humble a person
[1:29:18] hey man it would cause a person to
[1:29:19] realize they're nothing
[1:29:22] but dust amen god help me this morning
[1:29:29] brandon says now that's hard i know
[1:29:31] because we're always wanting to put our
[1:29:33] part
[1:29:33] in something we know
[1:29:36] something that we know that we want to
[1:29:38] do it say well i just know it should be
[1:29:41] done this way but as long as you're
[1:29:43] doing it that way
[1:29:44] it's going to be wrong and god will
[1:29:48] never use that effort
[1:29:50] maybe with the help of the lord we're
[1:29:51] going to get into that in a few minutes
[1:29:53] and just show you how
[1:29:54] god cannot use your ability he said
[1:29:56] that's the mat what's that's that's
[1:29:58] what's the matter with the world today
[1:29:59] there's too much seminary experiences
[1:30:03] too much placed upon education
[1:30:06] too much placed upon relationship or
[1:30:08] fellowship in denomination
[1:30:11] he says we rest one another or we rest
[1:30:13] on one another we rest upon men
[1:30:16] with ability
[1:30:20] we met we rest upon men with great
[1:30:23] ability
[1:30:25] well if i could just go here and be
[1:30:26] prayed for i know if so and so laid his
[1:30:28] hand on me i'll get well
[1:30:31] do you not believe church that the same
[1:30:33] god
[1:30:34] amen that parted the red sea amen for
[1:30:37] moses
[1:30:37] and they walked out on dry ground do you
[1:30:39] not believe that he's here with us this
[1:30:41] morning
[1:30:41] amen i believe that this morning i
[1:30:44] believe i'm looking at a group of
[1:30:45] believers that believes
[1:30:47] amen that if i'm driving to work in my
[1:30:49] truck amen and i have a need
[1:30:51] i can call out to god and he'll answer
[1:30:54] amen i don't have to have a special man
[1:30:56] to lay hands upon me
[1:31:02] we respect the ministry we we respect
[1:31:04] amen godly men we respect
[1:31:06] amen one another amen but we don't
[1:31:09] prefer one another brother branham even
[1:31:10] says that he said
[1:31:12] he says we rest upon one another we rest
[1:31:14] upon men with ability he said the bible
[1:31:16] says
[1:31:17] he says how can you have faith when
[1:31:19] you're preferring one another
[1:31:20] i believe that's found and i believe
[1:31:22] that is in first timothy 5
[1:31:24] 21 i believe he said how can we have
[1:31:27] faith
[1:31:28] when you're preferring one another when
[1:31:30] we are expecting saying this guy he's a
[1:31:32] great person
[1:31:33] he's a great person i'll just lean up on
[1:31:35] him he says that displeases god
[1:31:37] when you do that we must lean upon god
[1:31:40] and god alone
[1:31:42] amen we mustn't trust the ability of
[1:31:45] ourselves
[1:31:47] or anybody else we must completely
[1:31:50] yield to god amen the song it just
[1:31:54] stirred my heart
[1:31:55] as y'all were singing it before we come
[1:31:57] out amen i surrender
[1:31:59] i surrender that's what god wants us to
[1:32:01] do amen is a total surrender
[1:32:04] to him a total yielding to him
[1:32:09] he says if he's got something for us to
[1:32:11] do and as long as we feel that we're
[1:32:13] doing a pretty good job out of it
[1:32:15] then we'll never be able to be used of
[1:32:17] god
[1:32:20] this is what paul had to get rid of
[1:32:22] church he had to guard against it
[1:32:24] was his own human ability he was an
[1:32:26] educated man very eloquent
[1:32:28] but when god got a hold of him and he
[1:32:30] realized that all of his knowledge and
[1:32:32] all that he had learned it wasn't no
[1:32:33] good
[1:32:34] amen but notice what he says when god
[1:32:36] lifted him up
[1:32:37] he lifted him up into the third heavens
[1:32:39] think about this now because
[1:32:41] paul knew in himself that no man had
[1:32:43] ever
[1:32:44] been lifted up into the sphere of god
[1:32:47] that he had been allowed to go
[1:32:49] never but he said lest i be exalted
[1:32:52] above measure through the abundance of
[1:32:55] revelations
[1:32:56] not just one revelation but the
[1:32:58] abundance which is many
[1:32:59] amen many revelations there was given to
[1:33:03] me a thorn in the flesh
[1:33:07] notice his flesh not his soul now but
[1:33:09] because his soul that's born again
[1:33:11] amen listen church a born-again person
[1:33:15] can't get puffed up in his soul
[1:33:18] absolutely not
[1:33:20] it's born again it's born of god
[1:33:23] but this flesh wants to get puffed up
[1:33:30] but a thorn in the flesh a messenger of
[1:33:32] satan to buffet me
[1:33:34] watch now why did the thorn come lest i
[1:33:37] should be exalted
[1:33:38] above measure oh my church
[1:33:42] he's saying i realize that god amen
[1:33:45] can't use my pride
[1:33:46] he can't use my my eloquent words he
[1:33:49] can't use
[1:33:50] amen the big person that i think i am he
[1:33:52] can't use none of that
[1:33:56] that's why he had to get it out of him
[1:33:58] god wants me weak
[1:34:00] in my human strength amen we sing the
[1:34:03] song i am weak
[1:34:04] but thou art strong jesus keep me from
[1:34:08] all wrong
[1:34:09] i'll be satisfied as long let me walk
[1:34:13] close to thee amen do you love him this
[1:34:16] morning
[1:34:18] i think of the story brother branham
[1:34:19] tells of mr
[1:34:21] read head that came to brother branham
[1:34:23] one day
[1:34:24] he'd received the holy ghost and he said
[1:34:26] brother branham he was a great educated
[1:34:28] man
[1:34:29] he said i have enough degrees brother
[1:34:31] branham to plaster your walls with
[1:34:35] he said i've got all these degrees but
[1:34:38] he says he breaks down and he says but
[1:34:39] where is god in all of it
[1:34:44] oh my what good is it church
[1:34:49] if we can quote the message from 47 to
[1:34:51] 65
[1:34:53] if it's not in our heart
[1:34:59] i wonder no wonder why no wonder why
[1:35:02] people can't go any further
[1:35:04] because they're stuck right there and
[1:35:05] god can't deal with them as long as
[1:35:06] they're stuck
[1:35:07] in their own selves or they're relying
[1:35:09] upon some other man
[1:35:12] it's an individual affair moses was a
[1:35:16] man that thought
[1:35:17] he could do things with his own ability
[1:35:20] being raised in the palace is pharaoh's
[1:35:22] daughter's son
[1:35:24] he was taught in everything by the best
[1:35:26] of the best
[1:35:28] in battle he was trained by the best and
[1:35:30] he became the best
[1:35:32] why there wasn't nothing that could come
[1:35:35] before moses that he didn't know
[1:35:37] exactly how to handle and and deal with
[1:35:41] he was a great man there wasn't nothing
[1:35:44] in war
[1:35:45] when he went to go out to battle there
[1:35:47] wasn't no situation that moses
[1:35:49] did not know how to handle
[1:35:53] it wasn't a battle that he couldn't
[1:35:54] fight without winning
[1:35:57] he was a great man but one day
[1:36:01] one day he recognized amen that he was
[1:36:05] on the wrong side
[1:36:07] he began to recognize that the people
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:10] that he was seeing being whipped and
[1:36:12] dying amen out there
[1:36:14] what pharaoh was calling the mud daubers
[1:36:17] he began to realize
[1:36:18] those are my people hey man we have the
[1:36:21] same blood
[1:36:22] those are my people and moses
[1:36:26] brother branham and i'm going to read it
[1:36:28] here in a minute he said brother
[1:36:30] he said moses went out
[1:36:34] to do the will of god to do a right
[1:36:37] thing
[1:36:39] and it was his time for him to do it and
[1:36:42] it was the will of god for him to do it
[1:36:44] but he went in his own ability
[1:36:47] and all he had to show for it was one
[1:36:49] dead egyptian
[1:36:55] my he says we know he was strong he was
[1:36:59] well trained
[1:37:00] so he took it upon himself seeing the
[1:37:03] need of the day
[1:37:04] oh may god let us let this sink home
[1:37:07] seeing the need of the day moses with
[1:37:10] his intellectual powers
[1:37:12] and his ability that he had to do it
[1:37:14] with he was a smart man he was
[1:37:16] he was the coming pharaoh he had
[1:37:18] psychology he had power
[1:37:20] he had physical strength he had
[1:37:22] everything
[1:37:23] so he said i am well equipped i know all
[1:37:26] of it
[1:37:26] oh my and if there's a man in the land
[1:37:29] that's able to do it i am so
[1:37:31] i'm the man of the hour so i'll step out
[1:37:35] and he went out to accomplish a work
[1:37:37] that was right and in the will of god
[1:37:39] and he offered his natural abilities and
[1:37:42] god
[1:37:43] refused it he couldn't use one thing
[1:37:46] moses had
[1:37:53] oh my paul in chapter
[1:37:56] in the chapter of heroes of faith
[1:37:58] hebrews 11 there where we
[1:38:00] where we read our text from verse 24
[1:38:02] says by faith moses
[1:38:04] when he was come to years refused to be
[1:38:06] called the son of pharaoh's daughter so
[1:38:08] he was recognizing
[1:38:10] his position look what he had to give up
[1:38:12] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:38:14] with the people of god
[1:38:16] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:38:19] season
[1:38:20] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:38:23] riches than the treasures in egypt
[1:38:25] for he had respect unto the recompense
[1:38:27] of the reward
[1:38:29] now brother branham said now the
[1:38:31] scripture says the pleasures of sin
[1:38:33] for a season that's not just talking
[1:38:36] about
[1:38:37] amen immoral acts
[1:38:40] but moses's own human ability
[1:38:44] thinking that he is a great man that
[1:38:46] he's able
[1:38:47] to achieve amen what god wants him to do
[1:38:50] with his own human ability it was a
[1:38:52] great sin in that hour
[1:38:54] and i'll say it's a great sin in this
[1:38:56] hour
[1:38:57] if god couldn't use it then he can't use
[1:38:59] it now
[1:39:03] as it is today it's a sin it's an unholy
[1:39:06] thing
[1:39:07] amen listen church there's no great ones
[1:39:10] among us but jesus
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:16] if it wasn't for him where would we all
[1:39:17] be tonight this morning
[1:39:20] the grace of god i tell you church
[1:39:23] i'm sure if we opened up testimony
[1:39:24] service hey man we would have some great
[1:39:26] things to tell
[1:39:27] of what god's brought us out of then
[1:39:30] where are we
[1:39:31] where do we come into the picture that
[1:39:33] we're something great
[1:39:39] the spirit it's a spirit
[1:39:46] that i want to stay as far away from as
[1:39:48] i possibly can
[1:39:50] brother branham when he would begin to
[1:39:52] speak on these things in this message
[1:39:54] he would say now i want you young
[1:39:55] preachers to especially listen close
[1:39:59] why would he why would he address young
[1:40:02] preachers
[1:40:02] because he wants them to understand
[1:40:04] listen it's not about you
[1:40:08] this is not about me this is not this is
[1:40:10] not about you
[1:40:11] it's about christ it's about what he's
[1:40:14] done for us
[1:40:15] amen and taking that word into our
[1:40:18] hearts
[1:40:19] and letting that word friends amen live
[1:40:21] out through us
[1:40:23] amen do you realize friends the very
[1:40:25] reason why
[1:40:26] amen that christ had to come to the
[1:40:29] cross and die on the cross
[1:40:31] amen and spill and his blood amen come
[1:40:34] forth from his body
[1:40:35] amen was that very life that lived in
[1:40:38] christ could come out of him
[1:40:39] and into a people that his very life
[1:40:42] could live
[1:40:43] again
[1:40:47] so we're doing ourselves a detriment
[1:40:49] when we when we feel like that we're
[1:40:51] something special
[1:40:52] because i'm in the message
[1:40:57] i hope this is okay it's just what's on
[1:41:00] my heart
[1:41:07] i've seen great men i've seen great men
[1:41:10] preach
[1:41:13] stand behind the pulpit
[1:41:16] could out preach me by by eons and eons
[1:41:20] if
[1:41:22] well however you want to say it and then
[1:41:25] walk out
[1:41:28] and gossip
[1:41:31] lie and run the people down
[1:41:36] tell me that's god
[1:41:42] there's something more hey amen there's
[1:41:45] something more that god wants from us
[1:41:48] he wants us to get ourselves out of the
[1:41:50] way that he can show us that more
[1:41:53] amen that he can bring himself in
[1:42:01] notice god allows moses now
[1:42:04] amen to try to do what was right and was
[1:42:07] the will of god with his own strength
[1:42:10] he lets god he lets moses try this amen
[1:42:13] and it took him doing it to see
[1:42:15] that his own great big powerful self
[1:42:18] amen
[1:42:18] amen here he was nothing and he was
[1:42:21] running for his life
[1:42:22] from egypt the greatest man
[1:42:25] now running for his life from egypt
[1:42:30] and he got back there on the back part
[1:42:32] of the desert
[1:42:34] found himself hurting just jethro's
[1:42:36] sheep
[1:42:39] i think of it what a demotion that was
[1:42:42] amen going from
[1:42:43] next in line to being pharaoh amen and
[1:42:47] now he's back there herding sheep
[1:42:51] but you see god was working something in
[1:42:54] moses that moses didn't know
[1:42:56] what was going on amen
[1:42:59] amen he needed to be on the backside of
[1:43:02] the desert
[1:43:03] amen for god to get moses where he was
[1:43:05] needing to be
[1:43:07] all the knowledge of egypt amen was
[1:43:10] drilled into moses for 40 years
[1:43:13] amen and when god got him out of egypt
[1:43:15] it took another 40 years to get all that
[1:43:17] out of him
[1:43:19] so at 80 years old god begins to use
[1:43:22] moses
[1:43:30] god i hope it don't take 80 years for me
[1:43:34] because i don't know if i'm going to be
[1:43:35] here every time i'm 80 years old come
[1:43:37] i'm just now almost 40.
[1:43:42] but you see church his human ability he
[1:43:45] had to get it out of him
[1:43:48] now just because he was in egypt
[1:43:52] to begin with doesn't mean he wasn't
[1:43:53] god's man to begin with god knows
[1:43:56] amen god knows and he knows what each
[1:43:58] and every one of us have to go through
[1:44:00] amen to get that human ability out amen
[1:44:03] whatever whatever thing that we've got
[1:44:05] in our lives amen that
[1:44:07] that that we need to get out amen god
[1:44:10] knows how to deal with that
[1:44:13] god knows what he's doing the quicker we
[1:44:16] can yield and surrender
[1:44:17] amen every fiber of our being to him
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:20] the quicker he can fulfill his very word
[1:44:23] and
[1:44:23] desire through us amen notice now
[1:44:28] god wanted him on the backside of the
[1:44:30] desert i'm gonna i'm gonna hammer on
[1:44:31] this just for a few moments
[1:44:34] he he wanted him on the backside of that
[1:44:37] desert
[1:44:39] because he was right where god wanted
[1:44:40] him
[1:44:42] because after being on the backside of
[1:44:44] the desert 40 years
[1:44:46] one day he looked up and he seen
[1:44:50] a fire amen that
[1:44:53] that was in a bush and the bush wasn't
[1:44:55] being consumed
[1:44:56] and it caught his attention oh my
[1:45:00] it caught his attention and he said i
[1:45:02] got to go see what that is
[1:45:05] amen and let me just say this we all
[1:45:06] know the story
[1:45:08] amen but to save time let me just tell
[1:45:10] you
[1:45:11] amen when he got there amen what the
[1:45:14] burning bush had
[1:45:15] amen what moses has lacked the burning
[1:45:17] bush had
[1:45:19] amen it's what he needed all those years
[1:45:21] prior
[1:45:22] amen what the burning bush had is what
[1:45:24] moses needed
[1:45:26] amen when he come off the mountain
[1:45:30] the bible says that you could just see
[1:45:31] it on his face the glory of god
[1:45:34] amen he was a changed man amen now
[1:45:38] now when he was doing it in his own
[1:45:39] ability we find him running from egypt
[1:45:43] but now when he's not got no strength of
[1:45:45] his own
[1:45:46] and no no weakness and his weaknesses is
[1:45:49] all gone
[1:45:50] amen and all that is there and he
[1:45:51] realizes that he's nothing
[1:45:53] he comes back and he says i'm going to
[1:45:55] egypt amen what had changed
[1:45:57] the backside of the desert the pillar of
[1:46:00] fire
[1:46:00] changed him church we need that pillar
[1:46:03] of fire
[1:46:04] to change us amen not just on the
[1:46:07] surface
[1:46:08] amen but we need it in our hearts amen
[1:46:10] to come down in our hearts and say
[1:46:13] it's not me that runneth but it's christ
[1:46:15] amen that show is mercy
[1:46:17] it's christ that's doing the work
[1:46:18] through me
[1:46:24] hallelujah
[1:46:26] i like what he he's up there at the bush
[1:46:29] and god begins to speak out of the bush
[1:46:31] and moses he realizes in the presence of
[1:46:35] that pillar of fire
[1:46:37] and god he realizes i am nothing

[1:46:45] i was next in line for pharaoh
[1:46:46] but i'm nothing

[1:47:15] as i said i can only preach
[1:47:17] amen what what what what helps me as

[1:47:55] your heart there's something out there
[1:47:57] to fulfill that longing
[1:48:02] hallelujah he says moses you're the man
[1:48:07] he said i have come down i've heard the
[1:48:09] cries of my people he said and i've come
[1:48:11] down

[1:48:37] he knew god was with him
[1:48:38] hey man he didn't give up amen when
[1:48:41] pharaoh would come
[1:48:42] amen and do the very same thing amen
[1:48:44] that
[1:48:45] that moses would do amen pharaoh would
[1:48:48] come back and back it up
[1:48:49] amen but moses he didn't get discouraged
[1:48:52] he knew god had sent him
[1:48:54] he knew he was there on a mission and he
[1:48:56] wasn't given up until it was done
[1:49:00] hallelujah
[1:49:05] the backside of the desert changed
[1:49:08] brother branham types the backside of
[1:49:11] the desert
[1:49:12] with the new birth
[1:49:16] is that right the new birth makes us
[1:49:18] realize how insufficient we
[1:49:20] are in ourselves
[1:49:23] that's exactly where god wants us amen
[1:49:26] on the backside of the desert
[1:49:28] jesus told peter he said after you are
[1:49:30] converted
[1:49:32] go strengthen your brethren
[1:49:35] go strengthen your brethren but not
[1:49:38] until
[1:49:39] you're converted
[1:49:43] what good would it do for a man to get
[1:49:45] up here
[1:49:46] without the holy ghost and preach to you
[1:49:49] you need the holy ghost
[1:49:50] it wouldn't do you no good because he
[1:49:52] needs it himself
[1:49:54] is that right amen so so he's saying
[1:49:57] peter you're not able to do amen you're
[1:50:00] not able to strengthen your brethren yet
[1:50:02] but after the day of pentecost amen
[1:50:05] after the spirit comes
[1:50:07] amen you're going to go and strengthen
[1:50:09] your brethren
[1:50:12] amen you can tell amen before jesus was
[1:50:15] was hanging on the cross and dying you
[1:50:17] can tell peter
[1:50:18] wasn't able to to strengthen his own
[1:50:21] brethren
[1:50:22] there in the garden amen they were
[1:50:24] coming for jesus
[1:50:25] peter grabs a sword cuts the ear of the
[1:50:28] soldier off
[1:50:30] i tell you he wasn't aiming for the ear
[1:50:32] he just hit the ear
[1:50:33] he was aiming for the neck
[1:50:37] without god church we're murderers
[1:50:40] without god
[1:50:41] amen we're just beasts amen that's why
[1:50:43] we need god
[1:50:44] amen to come in our lives does it mean
[1:50:47] you're not
[1:50:47] you're going to be perfect no
[1:50:51] but you got an anchor you got something
[1:50:54] hey man that'll help you get back up
[1:50:55] again
[1:50:56] and keep marching forward
[1:51:01] failure is not when you fall down but
[1:51:03] failure is when you fall down and you
[1:51:05] don't get back up
[1:51:08] believers don't get they don't just stay
[1:51:10] down they get back up again
[1:51:13] i'll put it to you this way amen when
[1:51:15] you fall just make sure you fall
[1:51:16] forwards that way you're still going
[1:51:17] forwards
[1:51:18] is that okay amen believers they know no
[1:51:22] retreat
[1:51:23] they don't know nothing backwards all
[1:51:25] they know is flowers
[1:51:27] amen we're not stuck amen on one thing
[1:51:30] that the prophet brought
[1:51:31] amen we want more we want more and more
[1:51:35] and more if we put a period
[1:51:39] on the prophet of god in the message of
[1:51:40] the hour we do some the same thing
[1:51:43] that the pentecost did and the baptist
[1:51:45] denomination did
[1:51:46] amen but god there is no period with god
[1:51:50] amen with him all things are possible
[1:51:53] i believe church when we get over on the
[1:51:55] other side god will just continually
[1:51:57] keep unfolding
[1:51:59] and unfolding himself
[1:52:05] my
[1:52:10] i see there's no clock
[1:52:18] now back to paul turn with me to first
[1:52:20] corinthians chapter two
[1:52:26] we'll start with verse one
[1:52:38] paul again is speaking here
[1:52:43] after his conversion he he realizes
[1:52:48] that he's not going to be able to to act
[1:52:51] the same way that he
[1:52:52] he acted before and i just love this
[1:52:55] it's so beautiful
[1:52:56] he says and i brethren when i came to
[1:52:58] you
[1:53:00] came not with excellency of speech or of
[1:53:03] wisdom
[1:53:04] though he had excellency of speech is
[1:53:06] that right he was taught by the
[1:53:08] the best teacher there was gamaya
[1:53:10] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[1:53:12] so he didn't come to him
[1:53:14] with great speech and great big words
[1:53:17] he said for i determined not to know
[1:53:19] anything among you
[1:53:21] save jesus christ and him crucified
[1:53:25] and now he says i was with you in
[1:53:27] weakness
[1:53:29] and in fear and in much trembling
[1:53:32] oh my you know church paul knew
[1:53:36] that all his education was nothing now
[1:53:38] amen but it was a hindrance
[1:53:40] something that was going to try to get
[1:53:42] in god's way
[1:53:44] and it caused him to constantly amen
[1:53:47] come before the people
[1:53:49] amen not in his own strength but in
[1:53:53] amen weakness fear and trembling
[1:53:58] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:54:00] enticing words of man's wisdom
[1:54:02] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:54:05] of power
[1:54:06] that your faith now here it is that your
[1:54:09] faith should not stand
[1:54:11] in the wisdom of a great man
[1:54:15] or of men but in the power of god
[1:54:20] what a preacher he was amen
[1:54:24] paul had been cured church amen
[1:54:27] he was right where god wanted warning
[1:54:29] him that god could use him
[1:54:32] paul was so cured because because paul
[1:54:35] he was a prideful man
[1:54:37] before his conversion he was a a
[1:54:39] prideful man he
[1:54:41] he was he was backed up by all the
[1:54:43] religious sect and
[1:54:44] you know he was smart and all this thing
[1:54:46] he was a he was a prideful man
[1:54:49] and he you know he boasted about uh uh
[1:54:52] do uh going out and persecuting the
[1:54:55] christians and
[1:54:56] making havoc of the church he he boasted
[1:54:58] about those things
[1:55:03] but god was trying to get him into a
[1:55:04] place because god was going to use him
[1:55:07] in a great mighty way
[1:55:09] he would write most of the you know now
[1:55:11] here's the thing
[1:55:13] god can use a smart person okay
[1:55:16] he can and there there's many smart
[1:55:19] people in here i'm sure
[1:55:22] he can use a smart person but that smart
[1:55:25] person has to
[1:55:26] come to the understanding that they're
[1:55:28] nothing
[1:55:30] amen that god gave him that intelligence
[1:55:33] amen not to get puffed up
[1:55:35] amen but to use it for the glory of god
[1:55:37] is that right
[1:55:38] amen so god can use a smart person
[1:55:42] amen paul was that
[1:55:46] and he wrote god took that once he got
[1:55:49] that that pride
[1:55:50] amen that puffiness of i'm a big guy i'm
[1:55:53] a big fella
[1:55:54] out of paul amen then paul would set
[1:55:58] and write a big majority of the new
[1:56:00] testament
[1:56:02] and he would later become amen the
[1:56:04] messenger to the first church age
[1:56:07] so god was was curing him amen because
[1:56:11] god was wanting to use him
[1:56:13] in a mighty way watch what brotherhood
[1:56:16] says he says some back through the
[1:56:17] scriptures we find out
[1:56:18] that god always used the nobodies to
[1:56:21] become his somebody
[1:56:24] he always taken those that the world had
[1:56:26] rejected
[1:56:27] the modern age had rejected and that's
[1:56:29] the kind that he picked up to use
[1:56:31] he says consider the apostles think
[1:56:33] about peter the fisherman
[1:56:35] not enough education to write his own
[1:56:37] name john the ignorant and unlearned
[1:56:40] he he bypassed the nobles and the
[1:56:41] educated priests
[1:56:43] and the celebrities of them days the
[1:56:45] scholars the church members
[1:56:47] and them people who thought that they
[1:56:48] were somebody
[1:56:50] and picked up those who were nobody and
[1:56:52] used them
[1:56:54] but but now now listen we're talking
[1:56:56] about two great men here
[1:56:58] that were great moses was a great man
[1:57:01] amen he was next in line for pharaoh
[1:57:04] paul was a great man amen he even liked
[1:57:06] to brag about it you know we talked
[1:57:08] about that
[1:57:09] amen so god can use somebody that's
[1:57:11] great
[1:57:12] but they have to forget amen that they
[1:57:15] were a somebody
[1:57:17] for god to be able to use them
[1:57:21] i like how brother branham says it he
[1:57:23] says now if somebody can become one of
[1:57:25] his people
[1:57:26] god can use them if they are ready to
[1:57:28] forget they are somebody
[1:57:31] if you are ready to forget that you are
[1:57:32] a somebody
[1:57:34] and become a nobody then god can use you
[1:57:37] and make us somebody out of you
[1:57:39] amen but you've got to forget that
[1:57:42] you're so
[1:57:43] important well i just you know brother i
[1:57:47] just feel like this church just
[1:57:48] wouldn't be able to go on without me
[1:57:53] bless your heart bless your heart
[1:58:02] you know i i think a lot about this you
[1:58:04] know i never was
[1:58:05] able to see or profit i never got to
[1:58:07] shake his hand i was too young
[1:58:09] wasn't born yet i'd never
[1:58:12] never been in any of his services or
[1:58:14] anything
[1:58:16] but you know from being raised in it and
[1:58:18] knowing that that this is the truth
[1:58:21] that malachi 4 was sent for me as an
[1:58:23] individual
[1:58:24] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[1:58:27] before the great and
[1:58:28] terrible day of the lord amen i realized
[1:58:30] that it was for me
[1:58:31] that this message hey bad i'm a part of
[1:58:34] it
[1:58:37] amen but but you know i i believe just
[1:58:40] being human
[1:58:41] what if brother branham was here today
[1:58:44] how many you think would be here
[1:58:52] you see john the baptist said i
[1:58:55] must decrease so he christ
[1:58:59] can increase so brother branham had to
[1:59:02] go off the scene
[1:59:04] or else me included would probably be
[1:59:06] wherever he was
[1:59:10] so god has to increase he has to weigh
[1:59:13] amen
[1:59:14] of bringing the increase amen we got to
[1:59:16] get our eyes off a man
[1:59:18] we got to get our eyes off of human
[1:59:20] ability and get our eyes on god
[1:59:23] he's the one that's going to rapture us
[1:59:25] out of here he's the one that's going to
[1:59:27] take us out of here
[1:59:31] he said when he said he said
[1:59:34] there are so many of us in our lives
[1:59:36] some people as soon as they become
[1:59:37] christians
[1:59:38] they become arrogant and different
[1:59:40] that's right when they're just taking a
[1:59:42] vice versa path
[1:59:43] they're going backwards instead of
[1:59:45] forwards when more of you
[1:59:47] when more you can get out of yourself
[1:59:50] the more room you've got for the holy
[1:59:51] spirit to come in
[1:59:54] i want to show us an example and then
[1:59:56] we'll then we'll try to
[1:59:58] bring this down
[2:00:02] first samuel 15 if you turn with me
[2:00:04] there
[2:00:08] when we try to inject our own abilities
[2:00:11] into the word of god
[2:00:14] then then that word becomes hybrid and
[2:00:16] it's no more an
[2:00:17] original word of god to you anymore amen
[2:00:20] we're going to look here
[2:00:22] uh with me at king saul first samuel 15
[2:00:25] verse 1.
[2:00:34] samuel also said unto saul
[2:00:37] the lord sent me to anoint thee to be
[2:00:40] king over his people
[2:00:41] over israel now therefore hearken thou
[2:00:45] into the voice of the words of the lord
[2:00:49] thus saith the lord of hosts i remember
[2:00:51] that which
[2:00:52] amalek amulek did to israel how he laid
[2:00:56] weight for him in the way when he came
[2:00:57] up
[2:00:58] from egypt now go and smite amalek
[2:01:01] and utterly destroy all that they have
[2:01:03] and spare them not
[2:01:05] but slay both man and woman infant and
[2:01:08] suckling
[2:01:08] ox and sheep camel and ass and saul
[2:01:12] gathered the people together
[2:01:14] and numbered them in telome two hundred
[2:01:17] thousand footmen
[2:01:18] and two thousand men of judah and saul
[2:01:21] came to a city of amalek
[2:01:23] and laid weight in the valley and saul
[2:01:26] said unto the canaanites
[2:01:27] go depart get you down from among the
[2:01:29] amalekites
[2:01:30] lest i destroy you with them for you
[2:01:33] showed kindness to all the children of
[2:01:35] israel
[2:01:36] when they came out up out of egypt so
[2:01:39] the canaanites
[2:01:39] departed from among the malachites and
[2:01:42] saw smoth the amalekites from
[2:01:44] hawaii until thou cometh to sure
[2:01:48] that is is over against egypt and he
[2:01:50] took ag the king of the amalekites alive
[2:01:53] and utterly destroyed all the people
[2:01:55] with the edge of the sword
[2:01:58] but saul and the people spared a gag
[2:02:02] and the best of the sheep and of the
[2:02:04] oxen
[2:02:05] and of the fatlings and the lambs and
[2:02:07] all that was good
[2:02:09] and would not utterly destroy them
[2:02:12] now as we go through this
[2:02:15] bring it to bring it to our day okay hey
[2:02:18] man let's not just leave it to
[2:02:19] to the oxen and to the sheep and to all
[2:02:22] those things
[2:02:23] amen god wants to bring us amen amen in
[2:02:26] into further into the word of god
[2:02:28] and he's asking us to yield our our
[2:02:31] entire being
[2:02:32] to heal don't spare anything
[2:02:36] amen yield it out to god
[2:02:39] he said he wouldn't and the lambs and
[2:02:42] all that was good and would not utterly
[2:02:43] destroy them
[2:02:44] but everything that was vile and refuse
[2:02:48] that they destroyed utterly then came
[2:02:50] the word of the lord unto samuel saying
[2:02:52] it repenteth me that i have set up saul
[2:02:55] to be king
[2:02:56] for he has turned back from following me
[2:02:59] and hath
[2:03:00] had not performed my commandments and it
[2:03:03] grieved samuel and he cried unto the
[2:03:05] lord all night
[2:03:06] and when samuel rose early to meet saul
[2:03:08] in the morning
[2:03:09] it was told samuel saying saul come
[2:03:13] saying saul came to carmel and behold he
[2:03:16] set him up a place and has gone about
[2:03:17] and passed on
[2:03:19] and gone down to gilgal and samuel came
[2:03:21] to saul and saul said unto him
[2:03:23] blessed be thou of the lord i have
[2:03:26] performed
[2:03:27] the commandment of the lord
[2:03:34] i'm just going to stop right there for a
[2:03:36] moment many people think because they
[2:03:38] come to church
[2:03:40] we shout we dance
[2:03:43] we sing we've performed
[2:03:46] the work of the lord
[2:03:50] those things are good church shouting's
[2:03:53] good i love to shout
[2:03:54] i've done my share of it amen dancing i
[2:03:57] like to dance
[2:03:59] amen i like to sing i like to do those
[2:04:01] things but there's something more
[2:04:04] there's something more that what god
[2:04:06] wants out of us
[2:04:07] did he not the prophet of god not say he
[2:04:10] said that if i can get her still long
[2:04:12] enough i'll dresser
[2:04:16] is that right amen
[2:04:21] lord help me how can god
[2:04:24] dress us when we're always shouting
[2:04:29] how can he dress us when we can't even
[2:04:32] settle down long enough to hear the word
[2:04:35] is that is that okay amen we've got to
[2:04:38] settle down we got to we got to get
[2:04:39] still long enough
[2:04:41] amen that the spirit of god can drop
[2:04:43] down not just in our flesh
[2:04:45] not just in our mind that we walk away
[2:04:47] and say glory to god god sent a prophet
[2:04:50] no it's got to be more than that
[2:04:52] hallelujah it's got to be more than that
[2:04:54] it's got to come down into our heart and
[2:04:56] become a revelation
[2:04:59] that's performing god's word
[2:05:06] i was listening
[2:05:10] on the way to from florida to here
[2:05:12] traveling as i was traveling i was
[2:05:14] listening to a message
[2:05:15] what here's thou elijah and brother
[2:05:18] branham makes this statement
[2:05:20] he says we've had our healing campaigns
[2:05:24] we've had our times of shouting we've
[2:05:27] had all this
[2:05:30] we've had all this but there's something
[2:05:33] more
[2:05:34] amen there is it's more than the thunder
[2:05:37] it's more than the wind it's more than
[2:05:39] the rushing mighty wind
[2:05:41] amen god wants to speak to you in that
[2:05:43] still
[2:05:44] small voice
[2:05:48] he wants to speak to you when you're on
[2:05:50] the job
[2:05:52] oh my don't you believe that he can
[2:05:54] speak to you and reveal himself to you
[2:05:56] on the job
[2:05:57] amen i tell you church i you know i i
[2:06:00] drive
[2:06:01] about an hour 45 minutes to an hour to
[2:06:03] work
[2:06:04] and there's been times when i'd be going
[2:06:06] to work early in the morning all by
[2:06:08] myself
[2:06:08] and just sitting there not listening to
[2:06:11] a tape
[2:06:12] just just sitting there and meditating
[2:06:15] and all of a sudden the
[2:06:16] the holy spirit would drop down in that
[2:06:18] truck amen and i was driving
[2:06:20] and just put a thought there and then a
[2:06:23] scripture would come to me
[2:06:24] amen and what was it god was bringing me
[2:06:27] a revelation
[2:06:31] he wants to speak to us in an individual
[2:06:34] way
[2:06:35] listen church this is not this is not a
[2:06:37] church move
[2:06:39] this is an individual move of the holy
[2:06:42] spirit
[2:06:43] amen an individual affair it's more than
[2:06:46] the rushing mighty winds
[2:06:48] it's more than the thunder and the
[2:06:50] lightning it's that still small voice
[2:06:56] let me get back to the scripture he said
[2:06:58] what meaning
[2:07:00] and so samuel came to saul and saul said
[2:07:03] unto him blessed be thou the lord
[2:07:04] i have performed the commandment of the
[2:07:06] lord so
[2:07:08] my whole theme in that is it's more to
[2:07:11] coming to church
[2:07:13] and just hearing a good sermon it's more
[2:07:15] to come into church than here
[2:07:17] than shouting and singing and dancing
[2:07:19] and and having
[2:07:20] healings and all those things we'll get
[2:07:23] into that maybe tonight
[2:07:25] healing is a minor we don't major on a
[2:07:27] minor
[2:07:32] he says samuel said to him he said then
[2:07:35] what meaneth
[2:07:36] then this blessing of the sheep and my
[2:07:39] this bleeding of the sheep in my ears
[2:07:43] and the lowing of the oxen which i hear
[2:07:46] and saul said they have brought them
[2:07:50] from the amalekites for the people
[2:07:51] spared the best of the sheep and of the
[2:07:54] oxen
[2:07:54] to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and
[2:07:57] the rest we have utterly
[2:07:59] destroyed
[2:08:02] oh saul's just dancing he's yeah this
[2:08:04] praise the lord
[2:08:05] i did a good thing then samuel said unto
[2:08:08] saul
[2:08:09] stay and i will tell thee what the lord
[2:08:12] has said to me
[2:08:13] this night and he said unto him say on
[2:08:15] and samuel said
[2:08:17] when thou was little
[2:08:20] in thine own sight wast thou not made
[2:08:24] the heads
[2:08:25] of the tribes of israel and the lord
[2:08:27] anointed thee king
[2:08:29] over israel you see church it sounded
[2:08:32] like
[2:08:32] a good and sweet idea we'll save the
[2:08:35] best sheep
[2:08:36] amen and we'll bring them back and
[2:08:39] because we got victory over the enemy
[2:08:41] amen we'll sacrifice these sheep amen
[2:08:43] we'll sacrifice these oxen
[2:08:45] unto the lord glory to god what a great
[2:08:47] jubilee service we're going to have
[2:08:51] we're going to dance we're going to
[2:08:52] shout we're going to but the word of god
[2:08:54] was not fulfilled
[2:08:56] the word of god was not performed
[2:08:59] they were leaving out something
[2:09:04] was one problem it wasn't what god told
[2:09:06] him to do
[2:09:08] he was told to utterly destroy
[2:09:10] everything and leave nothing
[2:09:13] and god spoke back through samuel and
[2:09:15] said obedience is better than sacrifice
[2:09:18] you see samuel when he was little
[2:09:22] in his own sight god blessed him
[2:09:26] and made him king over all israel
[2:09:30] he said you know go on you think but you
[2:09:33] got all puffed up
[2:09:35] you got to thinking that you were
[2:09:37] something among the people
[2:09:39] and now you've got better ideas than god
[2:09:46] what hour are we living in church what
[2:09:49] time are we living in
[2:09:53] i think it's going home time don't you
[2:09:56] amen
[2:09:57] i i want to be i want to be found doing
[2:10:00] all the word of god not just part of it
[2:10:05] if we have get to if we have got to the
[2:10:06] spot i hope this is okay
[2:10:09] brother david can correct me if not
[2:10:14] but if we have come to the spot within
[2:10:17] our own ranks
[2:10:20] that shouting
[2:10:23] is all that we need we have done the
[2:10:26] very same thing that pentecost
[2:10:28] did brother branham said that this
[2:10:31] message would not
[2:10:32] denominize it can't denominize because
[2:10:35] it is the pure
[2:10:36] word of god but the spirit of
[2:10:38] denomination would be around it
[2:10:40] amen to try to denominize people are
[2:10:43] wanting
[2:10:44] an outward amen fleshly uh emotion of
[2:10:47] some sort
[2:10:54] i've sat in churches and i say this
[2:10:57] respectfully
[2:10:58] i've sat in churches
[2:11:02] where now it's got to where preachers
[2:11:06] that if you're not jumping you're not
[2:11:07] shouting they will condemn you
[2:11:10] for sitting there for just trying to
[2:11:12] hear what's going on
[2:11:15] and they will condemn you and say well
[2:11:17] if you felt like what these other people
[2:11:19] felt you would be up to
[2:11:25] where have we went church
[2:11:29] but i'm so thankful i'm so thankful that
[2:11:32] the word goes on
[2:11:34] amen and i want to be one of those that
[2:11:36] when the word moves
[2:11:38] i move with it hey man i don't want to
[2:11:41] be just stuck in a tradition
[2:11:43] i don't want to be stuck just going one
[2:11:45] way amen i don't want to be just going
[2:11:47] with the big crowd
[2:11:48] amen i want to go with the word i want
[2:11:51] to go the way
[2:11:52] the word goes if it leads me to south
[2:11:55] and so be it
[2:11:57] if it leads me to dance around this
[2:11:58] church so be it
[2:12:01] is that right i'm not against it i've
[2:12:04] run before i've shouted before i've
[2:12:06] danced before

[2:12:14] individual way
[2:12:16] amen but make sure he speaks to you
[2:12:21] make sure it's not man trying to work it

[2:15:56] worship you now for
[2:15:58] next few moments we just want to give
[2:16:01] our
[2:16:01] all to you i know lord
[2:16:07] there's preachers here that could take
[2:16:09] this thought lord and
[2:16:11] probably explain it and preach it in a
[2:16:13] lot better way
[2:16:17] but i just was doing lord what
[2:16:20] you've led me to do this morning
[2:16:25] let's sing this song together consume me
[2:16:27] oh lord
[2:16:29] somebody would help me
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:42] of your spirit
[2:16:48] [Music]
[2:16:56] is that your desire this morning
[2:17:00] [Music]
[2:17:10] of my life
[2:17:16] [Music]
[2:17:24] all once again with all our hearts now
[2:17:28] oh god
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:18:05] of my life
[2:18:11] [Music]
[2:18:20] hey man amen i think that's
[2:18:24] all of our hearts desire isn't it just
[2:18:26] to
[2:18:27] really be led of the holy spirit and
[2:18:31] it's easy to go down the path of ability
[2:18:36] you know that's a lot of times
[2:18:40] our ability is our natural course
[2:18:44] you know you do the things you can do
[2:18:47] and so you know the real important
[2:18:52] part of it is that you seek the face of
[2:18:55] the lord
[2:18:56] because there's one thing i know that
[2:18:59] the lord
[2:19:00] will always do he'll always put you
[2:19:03] in a no matter how he arranges your life
[2:19:08] he's going to put you in a spot where
[2:19:12] you're going to have to take his
[2:19:14] leadership
[2:19:15] above what you want to do
[2:19:17] [Music]
[2:19:19] and he'll he'll he'll rearrange that
[2:19:22] situation
[2:19:23] again that's thus saith the lord
[2:19:27] until you'll find yourself in a spot
[2:19:31] where it's what you want to do what you
[2:19:34] can do
[2:19:35] and he's going to give you place in that
[2:19:37] choice to have that leadership
[2:19:40] over your life and
[2:19:44] and that's when you have to be weak
[2:19:48] and surrender and that's the
[2:19:52] great part of our lives and when we
[2:19:55] follow our ability we
[2:19:57] run from that but we really need to get
[2:20:00] to that place where we just
[2:20:02] seek the lord's face say lord really
[2:20:05] what would you have me to do
[2:20:08] and there's a lot that's on my heart on
[2:20:11] that very subject but
[2:20:13] so we trust that we're going to have a
[2:20:14] baptism now and
[2:20:17] brother cosman and brother joseph are
[2:20:20] going to baptize a friend
[2:20:22] of theirs when they've been witnessing
[2:20:24] with and
[2:20:25] discussing baptism this morning is that
[2:20:27] this morning brother congressman so
[2:20:29] we're going to do that so what we're
[2:20:30] going to do is we're going to dismiss
[2:20:33] us and for those that
[2:20:37] need to go we'll have communion this
[2:20:40] evening
[2:20:41] at five o'clock we'll have our communion
[2:20:44] service
[2:20:45] and then uh also next sunday
[2:20:48] uh we'll be starting our study in
[2:20:52] the message uh the is this the rising of
[2:20:55] the sun
[2:20:56] and this is the rising of the sun and i
[2:20:59] think it's going to be a wonderful time
[2:21:01] uh just soaking in god's word
[2:21:04] so be praying for that for this sunday
[2:21:07] so
[2:21:07] we'll just be dismissed at this time for
[2:21:09] those that have to go
[2:21:11] uh brother cosman if you and joseph and
[2:21:13] our brother would go
[2:21:14] uh baptized in and uh
[2:21:18] and then the rest of steam missed
[2:21:20] anybody that liked to stay for the
[2:21:21] baptism

[2:21:25] worship and
[2:21:26] for a little bit and you are dismissed
[2:21:29] and uh
[2:21:29] so you can just go if you have to go and
[2:21:32] i know some of you have to go
[2:21:33] but if those of you that would like to
[2:21:35] stay for the baptism
[2:21:37] feel please be free to pay to the
[2:21:39] baptism
[2:21:40] amen let's have a word of prayers we're
[2:21:44] distance our father
[2:21:46] lord we've been challenged in our heart
[2:21:49] this morning
[2:21:51] by your word
[2:21:55] but lord we just
[2:21:58] don't always know what our abilities are
[2:22:00] because
[2:22:01] that's the natural course of our life
[2:22:05] we just naturally go with the things
[2:22:07] that we can do
[2:22:10] but father just to sit still and
[2:22:16] and hear ye him
[2:22:19] and just really seek out that
[2:22:23] your voice really gives us direction
[2:22:27] father and and we stop and
[2:22:31] go the path that you make for us
[2:22:35] and take that the journey that
[2:22:39] can only be performed by your grace and
[2:22:42] your mercy
[2:22:44] and that each of us would just come to
[2:22:47] that spot that we come to that place
[2:22:50] that we consider are going in
[2:22:54] and are coming out and we look at our
[2:22:56] own life
[2:22:59] in the light of your presence in the
[2:23:01] light of your word and
[2:23:03] the light of your will
[2:23:09] we don't go with the crowd we don't go
[2:23:13] with what the norm is
[2:23:17] but we just find that individual heart i
[2:23:19] just believe our brother
[2:23:21] spoke that to us just that
[2:23:25] personality and personal part of it
[2:23:29] that i know that i've heard from the
[2:23:32] lord and i'm
[2:23:34] i'm being obedient to that
[2:23:38] and if i don't have the ability to do it
[2:23:40] lord your strength
[2:23:42] is perfect in my weakness
[2:23:46] and by your grace is sufficient for us
[2:23:49] may each of us know that in our heart
[2:23:53] today
[2:23:54] all right god bless we hope to see you
[2:23:56] back those that need to go you are
[2:23:58] dismissed brother billy would you lead
[2:24:00] us in a
[2:24:01] song of worship the more that i
[2:24:06] surrendered
[2:24:09] the light of my lord
[2:24:15] the more that i
[2:24:18] release my cares
[2:24:21] the more you take control

[2:33:11] actually manifesting that word this
[2:33:12] morning and just
[2:33:13] accepting the baptism not only
[2:33:17] in the death and the burial of the water
[2:33:19] but they're the gift of the holy ghost
[2:33:21] that comes afterwards
[2:33:22] so we're just we're just gonna if you i
[2:33:26] don't know you have a few words brother
[2:33:27] randall i do
[2:33:28] a few months ago i don't know if y'all
[2:33:30] remember who i am
[2:33:32] i came in and uh i seen the beauty in
[2:33:35] this church by
[2:33:36] the people i mean that
[2:33:40] i looked at a place i had long hair and
[2:33:42] a beard and
[2:33:43] none of y'all really criticized me you
[2:33:45] know it was a wonderful feeling
[2:33:48] and for a little while i
[2:33:51] i took off and came back today
[2:33:54] but i started reading the baptism thing
[2:33:58] and
[2:33:59] and about a month ago i said something
[2:34:02] about
[2:34:03] to a guy that works with this man here
[2:34:05] he says i said when you see him again
[2:34:07] and tell
[2:34:07] brother coffman that uh i want to be
[2:34:10] baptized
[2:34:12] that took me a long time because i've
[2:34:13] been baptized before a long time ago
[2:34:16] but no matter how many times i've read
[2:34:19] that bible
[2:34:21] it's a different thing you know because
[2:34:23] peter was given
[2:34:24] the authority to loose and bind things
[2:34:27] on heaven and he said something
[2:34:28] different
[2:34:29] about being baptized with jesus christ
[2:34:31] amen
[2:34:32] it's just uh something had to go through
[2:34:35] my mind and snapping
[2:34:38] and like i say when i wanted to do it
[2:34:40] things started happening that was really
[2:34:42] bad
[2:34:42] i mean we lost phones everything you
[2:34:45] know and
[2:34:45] it was a bad month i said wow you know
[2:34:48] sometimes when you know you're going to
[2:34:50] do right something is going to happen
[2:34:52] become a constant battle but here i am
[2:34:55] here i am today and i want to get this
[2:34:57] done
[2:35:00] [Applause]
[2:35:05] we're just going to read our box 238
[2:35:10] and uh what a beautiful what a beautiful
[2:35:12] fulfillment this morning from what we
[2:35:14] heard from brother brayton
[2:35:16] and uh you know they heard the same
[2:35:19] message
[2:35:21] and that day and here's
[2:35:24] here's verse 37 as it says
[2:35:28] now when they heard this they were all
[2:35:31] pricked in their hearts and said
[2:35:33] unto peter and to the rest of the
[2:35:35] apostle
[2:35:36] man and brother and what shall we do
[2:35:39] then peter said unto them repent
[2:35:42] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:35:44] name of the lord jesus
[2:35:46] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:35:48] remissions of sins
[2:35:50] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:35:52] holy ghost
[2:35:54] for the promise is unto you and to your
[2:35:56] children and to all that are
[2:35:57] far off even as many as the lord our god
[2:36:00] shall call
[2:36:01] and with this many other words did he
[2:36:03] testify and exhort
[2:36:05] saying save yourselves from this unworth
[2:36:07] generation
[2:36:09] then they that gladly receive his word
[2:36:12] were baptized and the same day they were
[2:36:16] added unto them
[2:36:17] about three thousand souls
[2:36:21] whether randall fulfilling the
[2:36:24] the scripture just like the bible says
[2:36:27] go into all the world and be baptized in
[2:36:30] the name of the father the son of the
[2:36:31] holy ghost
[2:36:32] and we know by the divine revelation
[2:36:35] peter comes
[2:36:36] and he says that the name is the name of
[2:36:37] the lord jesus christ
[2:36:40] so we baptize you this morning in the
[2:36:41] name of the lord jesus christ
