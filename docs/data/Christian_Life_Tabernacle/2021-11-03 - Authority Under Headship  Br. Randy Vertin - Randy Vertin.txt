Description:
Authority Under Headship | Br. Randy Vertin 
Wednesday Evening Service: November 3, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

may be seated this evening we just would like to make a a few announcements uh before brother randy comes and blesses us with the word i'm i'm in expectation uh i know the lord's moving and he's i believe he's trying to bring us into a a greater realization of of his very presence and our desire to be more christ-like so we we have a couple announcements uh once again it's on my heart that if anybody would have a burden uh to help us with our sunday school age uh children uh i think we're like from five to twelve to maybe plan some events or some get-togethers or some things that we can do for them we've had to kind of give up our sunday school area because of our services so uh if you could uh pray for that that would be wonderful also uh there is a bin in the fellowship room or the back room there for donations for our homeless brothers and sisters and we need coats and jackets blankets skirt scarfs gloves mittens and socks are needed and you can place them back there in the back if you have other items you can contact joseph gordon and cosmine and brother chris harris and and they'd be happy to help you with any of those items that you need so if you have some extra coats and clothes and stuff it's starting to get cold and so we certainly uh want to reach out to them you know they're all part of our family right there maybe that last seed might be out there how much would you rejoice if you found the person that was going to cause the rapture amen i'd be excited all right we'd also like to uh i told uh brother randy tonight that this is the first service of our meetings because now we're starting to get in meeting mode uh we've we've done it so many years now that uh we seem to have it down but we don't want to forget it anything so uh we're a little different this year there will be a flyer on the bulletin board back there and uh so you can get the information uh the meetings are november 12th 13th and 14th uh brother tom ray and brother burleigh williams will be ministering friday evening service at 7 00 p.m uh service with brother burley uh williams and then uh saturday evening at 5 pm that's saturday evening at 5 00 p.m not to be mistaken with 6 p.m or 4 p.m saturday evening 5 p.m is our saturday evening service sunday morning at 11 a.m so we're going to give you an hour longer to sleep in i don't know when the clock changes but i hope they don't rob us of that hour but anyway service will be at 11 a.m on sunday if you get here at 10 that's wonderful most everybody get here at 10 30 so that would make you a half hour early for a change but so just come at your normal time or be ready for service at 11 am sunday evening we're having our singing our praise on worship singing sunday at 6 00 p.m so but if you have a special that you'd like to sing during the meetings uh get with brother billy and any of that sir songs that we can't get through uh through the meetings we will have our recording and singing and worship sunday evening at 6 00 pm and what we do is we we gather those together and we record them and we put them on a a cd or whatever media form that they have nowadays and we do that so you can play them in your home in your cars and just have something to fellowship and worship i think we got some of the best singers around personally so i really enjoy listening to them ourselves also along with our meeting we are having no saturday morning service no saturday morning in service if you happen to forget that and you come saturday morning uh you can have a prayer meeting for the service uh yourself or with anybody else that would happen to not know there's a saturday morning service but no saturday morning service but we are going to have a luncheon saturday from 11 to 3. so from 11 to 3 we have the gymnasium over on bedford euless i call it bedford euless road but it's on bedford road you just go up central you make a right on bedford road and it's at a location is 2503 bedford road you can take a picture of this on the bulletin board and then put that address in your phone and it will lead you to some excellent barbecue and a gymnasium for basketball volleyball badminton or whatever they're going to do for the rest of us we can sit around and fellowship and eat if the sisters there's a dessert sheet on the back if anybody would like to sign up to bring a dessert that would be wonderful and uh in any of the sisters that might be interested in helping with the side dishes for the barbecue please see sister leslie i think we do beans and corn or any other imaginary items that you would like to put together so that those are our announcements our meetings uh uh somebody pray and see if the lord would raise somebody up in our midst that has a burden for our young children and see if we can try to get something uh going uh during at least this school year to offset uh some of the things that are going on and then also our donations for the homeless also if there's any maintenance items that you notice in church uh something that's broken somewhere or that you know needs uh you know needs to be fixed maybe the pew is falling apart where you're sitting or something if you would let brother matt thomas sack and brother troy mackey know or any one of the deacons we will try to get any maintenance items fixed that you might come up with so we hope there's not any questions uh this year uh we we don't really uh send out a lot of announcements to other churches of course we you know we don't really have the facilities of course i know that brother jackson could put 500 people in this building here so but i'd like to see this year to see have more of our friends and relatives and people from our community come so if you have somebody that's been on your heart and you'd like to invite him to church i know certain people will come from from the outside for various different reasons but uh and then some of them in coming for years but let's just maybe extend a special invitation out to someone like you'd like to have come and fellowship and maybe we could just uh extend some fellowship right in our own community in our own neighborhoods and so we're just [Music] hoping that we can just invite people to come in i'd love to have a maybe someone that's away from the lord come in and the presence of the lord deal with their heart wouldn't that be wonderful and i believe god can still do it in fact i believe that the scripture says he's compelled at the end to go into the highways and byways and bring them in and he knows the hours at hand so i believe there's going to be a special grace and a special mercy to get out and bestowed upon them because all that the father hath did to me will come so those are our announcements if you have any questions ask somebody that listened and uh they will certainly uh let you know what's going on so let's just i will remind you several other times in the near future but are you excited for the word aren't you glad in this hour you know the truth and you know the lord oh what more could you have than to know that nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand and you're secure in him so let's stand together this evening as we invite brother randy i don't know if he'll sing a song for us tonight or not it's up what's ever upon his heart to do but let's sing amazing grace how sweet the sound as we turn the service to whatever brother our brother has on his heart and i love brother randy's spirit i love the pureness of his heart i love his motive and objective and i i enjoy the gospel that he preaches so i'm excited this evening to hear the word of the lord aren't you also don't you love them just invite them in think about the grace that saved you think about all the times that you stumbled and failed he lifted you up think about how he's never left you and never forsaken you and how he promised to get you through all the way to the end that's what i call grace [Music] how sweet [Music] me [Music] it was grace that taught my heart to fear [Music] just [Music] through many dangers through many days [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen let's just power heads in a word of prayer [Music] heavenly father lord jesus lord today we're still relying upon that same amazing grace oh god [Music] lord i believe it was your prophet paul who said if we started by this grace were he made perfect by the law or by the flesh lord we can answer an emphatic no to that god we're still relying lord jesus upon your grace this evening lord lord and even as i was thinking earlier today lord how we make so many mistakes and we stumble and we fall but oh god if that same grace could that same blood could wipe away a lifetime of sin and trespasses in just a moment how much more was is that grace still available oh god to your children lord who believe this evening oh god lord for our mistakes that we make every single day oh god that grace is still available that blood is still available lord we even had a prophet lord that you showed how you just reach into your side and write part and over all those things that we do every single day that would be wrong lord we're relying upon that grace once again oh god this evening lord may that amazing grace just cover us oh god right now lord that you'd look down upon us through the shed blood of your son the lord jesus and see pure spotless white oh god because we're covered in that blood oh god lord we love you we just praise your holy name lord this evening lord as we come to hear from you oh god lord it wouldn't be any benefit lord for me to preach my own thoughts or my own ideas oh god lord no no doubt a man could tickle the ears oh lord but lord only the the pure unadulterated word of god can transform a heart we're just asking once again oh god you'd reach down by your mighty hand and lord massage our hearts with the oil of your spirit o god and soften us to you lord jesus lord of the bernies stoniness lord any hardness in our hearts may your oil lord god of the holy spirit just come down and soften us now break up the fallow ground lord jesus let your perfect will be done lord and your people we just surrender ourselves to the hand of the potter lord upon the wheel in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen let's just open our bibles to a couple of scriptures here uh we would just want to maybe finish up what we ministered before a few weeks ago here we're going to turn to the book of matthew chapter 8 read a few scriptures here and then we'll go also back to the book of genesis chapter 3 just keep that in mind um how many of you love the lord jesus his mercies endure forever they're renewed every morning we thank the lord for his grace it's grace that we started out with and it's grace that we're leaving here with because if we think we're gonna fulfill it in our own flesh then we're we're sorely mistaken and i thank the lord for a message that that proves that and for even the life of a prophet that we saw in this day he was who was brave enough to to share his faults and his shortcomings and yet lived a life that proved that the grace of god was enough because he was he was just a man but he was a man that was just crazy enough to believe in an overcoming grace to cover all of his faults and if the lord could do that for him i'm believing that for myself and for each every one of us so matthew 8 and we've read verses 5 through 10 says when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled and sent it to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and then let's turn to the book of genesis chapter 3. and we'll just read a couple scriptures starting at verse 1. it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the truth of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god that said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil amen let's just bow our heads in one more quick word of prayer heavenly father we just pray that you would bless your word father this evening lord your scripture said that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god lord we just ask oh god that we would just come in faith and expectation lord knowing lord that your word can never fail and you said that he that hungereth and thirth after righteousness they shall be filled lord we've come hungering and thirsting after you this evening lord lord may you just feed your children lord may we just reach into the storehouse oh god and and break the bread of life to us oh god and just have your perfect will and way this evening in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated so we just kind of want to finish our thought that we spoke a few weeks ago i don't remember how long ago it was now but on the power of obedience and the subtitle that we kind of spoke at the time but maybe we'll get to in earnest this evening is authority under headship and and just to kind of recap very quickly what we spoke about before you know we we could read in the book of second timothy chapter three it says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come and how many know we're living in the last days so we can surely apply this uh to our day right now it says for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and holy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highmended lovers of pleasure more than loves of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away and we know that is the day that we're living in we can see it on every hand the attitude of the people of this world the attitude of i guess what we'd say many so-called christians that that claim christ but don't live a life that would even come anywhere close to expressing the character of jesus christ and we see that it's so true men are lovers of their own selves i've said it i've said it before here i just always kind of thought of it that i caught i caught the unholy trinity of me myself and i the the thing the that's what people care about is they only care about what affects themselves you know i see it all the time people would say well it doesn't it doesn't affect me so what should i care well you know but the but we've heard even from our pastor and and what fulfills the law and the prophets of as you would have men do unto you do unto do unto one another and even the lord jesus said you would know my disciples by their love one for the other and we find that the natural love between men is even waned to the point the scripture says that because iniquity would abound the love of many would wax cold and we find because the name of christ is blasphemed in such a way where you know that people would turn on a television and see you know a preacher on tv just begging for money or living one kind of way and preaching another thing that because iniquity abounds the love of the love of many would wax cold and but but god is calling for a complete separation from all unbelief god is calling for a complete obedience to his word we read the quote and i guess we could read it even again here from the token and brother branham says the full obedience to the word of god to the to god's entire word will entitle you to this token but if we looked at that from a purely intellectual standpoint we'd surely fail because we've already fallen short so what does it come down to is what are we really looking at in the in the end is are we truly looking at our sacrifice or if we become carnal and start to look at the things that we can perform because in the end brothers and sisters it all comes back to the lord jesus christ it all comes back to grace now we don't live in disgrace thinking that we can just go live in any kind of way and just do whatever we want and say well we're just happy because the lord did all of it no but because the when when one truly believes the word of god it brings a change in an individual god you can't come into the presence of god you can't come to a to a true knowledge of the word of god and leave the same way you came in it just can't happen you'll either go away you'll go away an unbeliever and be sealed away to that fate or or something will change in you then you'll cling to that blood you'll cling to that sacrifice and what we find is so many times the devil has tried to trick the people of god into thinking that once they've con once they've started in this way of grace that they're made perfect by their own actions but we know that's not the truth because it's always the grace of god and so much that we find out that when the capstone came it didn't shout works works it didn't shout law law it didn't shout self-righteousness self-righteousness but it came with shoutings crying grace grace unto it i was i was driving down the road probably a month ago and we were driving and i just had a lot of things on my heart and i was really just praying just lord i really i just really need you know we need a touch from the lord how many need a touch from the lord you know it's not enough you know it's not enough to just think about what the lord did for you way back when i'm thankful for what god did for me way back when i wouldn't be where i am now if it wasn't for how god changed me and brought me to the place i'm at now but i need i need rivers of living water flowing out from my belly right now we can't live in that broken cistern back there heaping up testimonies of days past and days gone by i want i need a living god right now and we have a living god right now if we could receive it but i was just really crying out to the lord and you may think this is really simple and that is really simple but i would just something i just was sitting here at a stoplight and i looked up and we know how they have the road signs around texas those big ones with the orange letters how they have the little orange lights that light up to make the different words and and and i know that they it may be in the natural it may have seemed like nothing because surely maybe someone was just running a test on the screen or something but i looked up and i saw and it said test test and i was like oh my and just something in my heart was like that was the lord just preparing me for something like the lord was just kind of giving you know maybe you say well that was just a guy a technician doing something wasn't on the other billboards so i don't know what it was but i looked at it and something just said that was for me and i kind of you know how it is when the lord might give you a warning on something you can almost get that the devil tries to put a fear it's like oh my what's around the corner what test test is coming and i started thinking about i said well lord praise god you know if there is a test coming you warn me about it and i know i've got a way of escape by his grace he said you won't go any temptation but the lord will provide a way of escape and it was just something that the lord came to me like a few hours later and i started thinking about that scripture and i said you know what lord i said there's grace grace for the test test and i said praise the lord because no matter how the devil comes in though the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will lift up a standard against it so it doesn't matter how many the enemy comes in with i think the scripture says in one place he says he says one of you will put flight to a thousand and ten of you will put flight to tens of thousands how much more is it for the people of god how the prophet could say well when that when the when the weakest christian gets on their knees the demons tremble the satan cow is in the corner why because he knows more than we do many times what power lays in the word of god and when we just put our simple faith in him i i i think about this and if if we started by grace then we got to finish with grace and it comes down to realizing brothers and sisters that when when it's at the end of the day no matter how much you think you've accomplished no matter how much you think you've done for god no matter how much you think you've achieved for him you're going to lay that crown at his feet when it's all said and done you're going to lay it all down before him because it was only by his grace that you achieved it it was only by the grace of the lord jesus that you're here right now it was only by his will for your life if you could just accept it but he's working something in us and so we just to kind of recap we talked about that power of obedience and how even in the old testament we find so many things that looked silly we talked about jericho and now it made no natural sense that people marching around a city and shouting and blowing a trumpet could bring the walls down how naaman how the prophet didn't even bless him with his presence sent the servant and said go dip in the jordan and it wasn't that it wasn't the scientific act of dipping in a muddy river that cleansed the leper from his spots why we talk about abraham how god said separate yourself and i'm going to bless you it wasn't just abraham doing that that made him have a child but it was obedience to the word of god that brought the blessing but now you start to think about obedience and we talked about ob obeying from the heart how how it's got to be a life that comes from inside the inside it's it's not enough to have a mental conception of it it's not enough to just be able to read the word and say well yes i see this and i see that as our pastor was talking about seeing the book from the other side because it goes remember our prophet even taught us that the word we're seeing this word it's between the lies you say oh brother you're starting to get outside the word no we start to understand that to truly understand the word you've got to be one with the word because the only way you can truly see what this word is bringing us to is to know the author doesn't matter how much you can memorize it doesn't matter how much you can quote it doesn't matter how many messages you can listen to except you be in tune with the with the composer if you're not in in unity with the writer of the music you'll never know how it's supposed to be played i think we've heard our pastor even mention uh uh my i might have been brother david or another brother mentioned about that that carburetor and how they couldn't get it to work well what would it have been if that if that man that was trying to work on it would say you don't know what you're talking about well they say well i can produce the credentials that show you i created that's why you don't know what you're talking about and that's many times without even knowing what we do to the lord you say lord how could this be in my life how can i live this overcoming life how can i be more than an overcomer more than a conqueror he said it doesn't matter how it can happen the only thing that matters is i said it would happen if you could just be audacious enough to believe it he'll perform it that's what separated abraham was no matter what he felt no matter what he did no matter what mistakes he made he was crazy enough to believe that because god said it he will perform it he that begun a good work in you is faithful to complete it he said i know the thoughts i have towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring it to an expected end so if if or if you've already had that thought about you then why do you keep trying to change god's mind about yourself but the problem is we live so much in our flesh that we can't even accept what god's made us we can't even accept it many times because we can't we can't overcome this carnal mind that sees nothing but wickedness in the flesh you're in good company because even paul said oh wretched man that i am he said what i would do good evil is present with me the good that i would i do not but that would i don't want to do that i do so brothers and sisters you're in good company but be like paul as well and say forgetting those things that are being because it has nothing to do with your ability if it had anything to do with your ability one drop of your ability would make the blood of christ of not effect it has nothing to do with you [Music] i'm preaching at myself tonight too because it's about time we got out of our own selves about it he promised the word he said i will have a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish and then he called you to the only word that could produce that and the devil's in your ear telling you it can't happen you need to be crazy enough to stand up no matter what happens and look the devil in the eye and say i believe what god spoke about me in spite of all my failures in spite of all my shortcomings in spite of how i've failed him over and over and over and over and over and over and over again because it's not about you anyway that's why christ died that's why he rose again that's why the blood is there for you you know brother bradham said people wouldn't make a rapture because they can't accept the fullness of the atonement except the fullness of the atonement to be crazy enough to believe that even if you messed up even when you fall flat on your face you can get back up apply the blood put it behind you and keep walking forward [Applause] brothers and sisters if david under the blood of bulls and goats could reach into the grace of god when he was a murdering adulterous liar so much so that the law didn't even apply to him anymore he should have died pronounced his own judgment but the prophet got right through the prophet come back and says you won't die if he could pull the grace of god down in the blood of bulls and goats how much more in the final age what god is bringing your people to perfection if he could do that how much more us the blood wasn't even applied then but his faith in that sacrifice was so much that he could reach beyond time and grab a grace that wasn't even in his time yet did you ever think about that now that's that may be crazy but that's the faith i want to have that's the faith i you know what i'm going to be crazy that's the fate i possess why because paul said paul said that the life that i now live i live by the faith god put in me no sir he said the life that i live i live by the faith of the son of god he wasn't even relying on his own faith anymore hallelujah that's the faith i want glory to god not to even rely on my own faith because you can't work it up anyway i believe in pentecostal stuff i believe in singing and shouting and dancing speaking in tongues and words of wisdom and and prophecies and all that stuff but it doesn't do any good if then when you get out there you go and back bite one another and fight with one another and do all these things it doesn't it doesn't do anything power without character say 10. so we wonder why the power isn't here like it ought to be because he's building character first see god does it the right way satan will come down and just pour a bunch of power out on a bunch of people that don't care nothing about god in their hearts but the ones that do care about god and want to do it the right way you know what he's going to do he said he said that husbandman he said he waited long he waited patiently for the fruit he waiteth and waiteth and waited and you know what they say about the fruits the fruits that you got to wait the longest on those are the best ones those are the ones that are most precious those are the ones that are worth the most because those are the fruits that take a lot of patience to go oh you can go throughout a bunch of weeds and they'll sprout off overnight but the one that you gotta cultivate the one that you gotta put prayer into the one that you gotta get that on your knees and you gotta jump about it and dig it up and the wind's gonna blow and the rain's gotta come that's the precious fruit so don't get discouraged god's got a bride right here all around the world he's got it right here you got to put that to yourself he's got a bride right here that he's bringing to perfection i don't care how he does it i don't care what i got to go through i don't care what i got to look like because i already look like a fool anyway so i might as well go 100 percent with it as it is and you could call me crazy and say brother but but did you did this and brother you failed here that you know what i'm not counting on myself anyway yeah even if it was true even if it was true i said lord forgive me i'm gonna do the best i can and that's where grace takes over that doesn't excuse anything but there's a reason why when you really became a christian when your heart was really changed that no matter how many times you mess up it tears you up every time the devil's always there you ain't no christian because of this and because of that well if i don't if i'm not a christian then why do i care so much every time it happens remember that devil he's slick he's going to get you coming and going he's going to tell you he's going to tell you when you don't feel condemnation because you believe in the grace of god that your conscience is just seared with a hot iron but then he's going to get you when you feel some conviction because you did something that's he ate a christian because you wouldn't have done it anyway and god wouldn't let you feel this bad see it doesn't matter if you try to do it intellectually you'll lose every time but you've got to look beyond that sense you've got to move beyond your mindful thinking that's rapturing faith you say oh that's simple yeah it's simple enoch walked with god that's all he did noah was out there building a boat he was working hard enoch walked with god which one looked like they were more righteous which one looked like they had more fruit you know what you can call me fruitless all you want as long as when you look for me i'll be gone that's all right you you know everybody else could go out there and build their boats you can go out there and build your big kingdoms you can go out there and build your big things your big monuments to your own ability if i could just walk humbly with god and then and then and then when you turn around when that when that person turns around and say oh look at this big thing i built and i'm gone that'll be that's the fruit all that's the fruit i need right there that's the kind of fruit i'm looking for brothers and sisters see but the devil's got us all thinking that it's all about us now you started out in grace are you made perfect by works or by your own righteousness sir i mean remember if god did one thing one way he's always got to do it that way so if he started this working grace is he going to finish it by works i think that you think we're going to glory when we get up there and say praise the lord look how well i lived look how good i lived you know what we're going to say is glory to god for the blood of the lamb who cleanses from all unrighteousness who sealed us away into his kingdom by his grace we ain't gonna be singing any songs about how good we did how many people i witnessed to how many songs i was saying and how perfectly in key they were and i didn't hear how well i did this or did that or how many how many things i did it was all him that did it and you already have listen except the lord built their house they labor in vain they build it remember what brother branham said statue of a perfect fan he said you don't add to it it adds to you so why do you think you're going to get your little twigs of self-righteousness your little haystacks and and little hay bales of of of good works that you think now there's nothing wrong with good works see because the life of christ produces that in the individual see now the devil because the devil run the other side see well you ain't got to do nothing you're just predestinated right no it'll produce something it may be the littlest remember brother ram said he said if you just wiggle that little finger you wiggle the little finger he said pretty soon it'll be the whole finger pretty soon it's the hand pretty soon it's the arm pretty soon you don't you're running down the street but it'll produce something and i don't believe there's anybody in here that can say when god touched their hearts they didn't see that little thing start to fly as little as it might have been why because the one littlest drop of the power of god in your life is more powerful it's more overcoming than all the devils those 200 million demons from euphrates that got their guns trained right on the bride one drop of the blood of jesus christ if you could have faith in that it's all it doesn't matter why because it's not about you it was never about you and that's what we that's where many times we've gotten off the track because we hear so much about the bride the only thing that makes the bride special is that he's in her is that there she's one with the groom that's why she's the bride did you ever know there's a reason why there's the bride and the bride groom see the bridegroom has all of it the bride's just got the bride but i need the bride groom i need to have all of it i don't want just the peace i need all of him because he's got everything i need hell should i you know we got we've gotten so much thought i've called it before maybe he said it here bride pride well i'm the bride now i by the grace of god brother matthew you may be able to back me up on this brother because and this isn't calling you out i know i believe you'd you'd take this but because i was never into like the bar scene the lord just kind i had my own struggles but that was one but i've heard a lot of people that i knew that were in there and you might be able to back this up said the one you at the at the you know they get the guys that would get riled up in the bar and i've heard people say this a lot of places i worked at in the construction sites they said it ain't the one that talks biggest you got to worry about it's the guy that sits in the corner that's real quiet see and that's see that's what the devil's looking at with a lot of people i'm brian i'm bright i'm bride you ain't got to worry about the talkers hey but but that one that's in their closet real quiet like praying out to god all right becoming unified with the bridegroom that's the one the devil's scared about brothers and sisters now no i believe in speaking a confession he's the high priest of your confession but the lord knows the way you're speaking it you know when you walk around your chest puffed out and head so big you couldn't fit it through the double doors over here see but but the life of christ brings humility remember the way up is down the way up is down i know i'm nothing i'm proving that to myself over and over and over again maybe let the lord jesus prove to you that he's all in all that he's all we need i hope that's all right so what we really want to get to here we just talked about that obedience and how we find out what happens in that denominational spirit is they can't obey the word of god because they've they've trapped themselves in a little cage of their own creeds and dogmas so when the lord says receive ye the holy ghost and it's outside those bars they can't reach it because they're trapped when he says believe every word jesus christ the same yesterday and forever and it's outside they can't reach it why because they've been trapped they can't obey the full word of god there may be something in there that could intellectually maybe grasp it and say oh yeah that looks right but my church but my experiences taught me this i don't care what your experiences have taught you i don't care what your intellect can come up with if it's against the word of god it goes in the trash i know that's simple but that's where eve that's why we read genesis there because eve's simple thing if you listen to the the to the message satan's eden brother branham said that what happened was they were naked and that they were not ashamed why because the brother brahem said that they were covered with a holy ghost veil a holy veil that shielded them from all those things that they didn't even need to know it it wasn't anything to them but see what happened brother branham says that she lusted for knowledge and when she did that and she accepted the devil's lie she replaced a holy veil with a lust veil and that's why we see now so many people shipwrecks because thinking that they're with the word of god they've replaced that holy veil that was once presented to them with the lust veil of oh i want to know this i want to accomplish that i want to do this and i want to do that you remember i is one of the wickedest words you can use because that was the devil's word your brother david and i were just talking about that yesterday was it just yesterday i'm losing track of time brother i don't know but we were just talking how what was that was the devil that said i will do this i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will be like the most high i will do this and i will do that and if you find yourself this if this isn't the age for i i don't know what is i mean they plastered everywhere he got ipad iphone imac you know all these different things everything's about that unholy trinity me myself and i right why because that's what the devil's desire was was to create a kingdom unto himself but see the desire of christ when he came on the seat he said i do nothing except what the father shows me my work is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work so if that was his desire what should our desire be it's to do to find the will of god and the will of god is his word so now we kind of get to the to the crux of the matter here authority under headship see because i we read that i'll just read this again here the of obedience the the definition of it because it's really powerful it says obedience is compliance with an order a request or law and so that's that's the surface level of it you say if i tell you something i say i need you to obey this order and you go do it you've obeyed right but this is what really struck me and this is where we'll read matthew 8 again the secondary the the end of that it says or submission to another's authority that's the kind of obedience god is looking for see because you remember in the scripture the lord told a parable and i think i have it in here if i could find it really quickly here we go matthew 21 verses 28 to 32 it says but what you think he a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work today in my vineyard he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i go sir and went not whether the twain did the will of his father they say unto him the first jesus saith unto him verily i say unto you that the public republicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believed in not but the republicans and the harlots believed him and ye when he had seen it repented not afterward that he might believe him and so what are we seeing here it's a difference between an intellectual religion and a heartfelt religion because i tell you what brothers and sisters there's many times in my life that because of the flesh the lord said do this and because my flesh either i either i felt you know in a bad mood if i could just say it that way or i was struggling with a mind battle i said lord i can't do it but my heart's desire said lord help me and whether it was like this every single time or not more than often than not you repent and you go say lord help me to do the right thing and not to disobey you lord when you want me to do something or whatever it might be apply that however you will but how many proclaim and say lord i'll do whatever you want me to do repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ well i can't go that far love your neighbor as yourself well i can't do that i mean you did did you see what they did to me see but there's a difference between a heartfelt religion something that changes an individual and that's the submission that's the obedience we're talking about it is a submission to authority i want to be fully submitted to the will of god in my life i want a hundred percent submission so i and and and if you'll bear with me we'll just go through this and we'll we won't be too much longer but uh we'll go back here and read in matthew chapter eight it says and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him and the saturn answered lord i am not worthy that thou should has come unto my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed now we read that and we think oh that's just a powerful statement just speak the word we use that part of it so often just speak the word that spoken word power sounds really good but what i want to focus on is why what revelation did he have that could give him that kind of a faith what was it that he understood there was something in this centurion that understood something that was so powerful that jesus said i've never seen a faith like this even in israel and brother branham said that was a type of you that's a gentile faith right there that's a gentile faith so you can say lord this is me i may not understand it but this is me right i don't care about i don't care i want understanding don't get me wrong but if that's not a barrier to receive from god abraham did not understand how his body would be transformed to receive a child and sarahs would be transformed but he believed it until it came to pass say lord i don't know how it will but you know what lord prove your word in me by bringing it to pass interpret your word in me by bringing it to pass in my life that's what i want yes but in verse 9 we we see why he could have this revelation he said for i am a man of authority is that what he said no he didn't say he was a man of authority now many times i think when we read this we have a tendency to fill that in ourselves and think well he was a centurion remember what it's a centurion he had a hundred soldiers under him so he said oh i'm a man of authority so i understand that because i'm in charge this and this happens no that's not the revelation he had he said i'm a man under authority so there so i want you to see this brothers and sisters there is a power there is a see this is exactly the opposite of what the world would have you believe in this day because the world wants to tell you you're just an independent person you don't need nobody else and you can do whatever you want if you put your mind to it if you do this and you do that and this or that or the other especially young people you're getting ready to go to college you're getting ready to finish high school and they're pumping you up until you do whatever you want to do you're the masters of your own destiny nothing but antichrist there's one that holds my destiny in his hands and i want what he's got for me so don't let him tell you that because it's antichrist all right but look what he says and it's not about well i have this power and i have this no he says he says i am a man under authority having soldiers unto me under me see having soldiers under him was secondarily this was a byproduct of him being under authority he says and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another comet he cometh unto my servant do this and he do with it so there was something in this centurion what did he see in jesus in the lord jesus he said i'm a man under authority so much so i can understand that whatsoever you say why because he knew remember what brother bran i'm told in the little parable if i could call it that of the police man in the middle of the intersection and he and brother brandon went out of his way when he describes this to describe a little pipsqueak that he said his hat pressed down over his ears he's got clothes that barely fit and he's walking out there he's just a little thing he said he couldn't i was just reading before i didn't get the quote down but brother brandon says what fight he said he couldn't even stop a bicycle if you wanted to so that's a pretty weak individual see this see the prophets get into something with these things he doesn't they didn't see them say things just for fun but he was but what was it he said but when that when that policeman walked out into that street and he put that hand up and blew that whistle he said three he said hundreds of horsepower vehicles would come screeching to a halt why it wasn't because the whistle it wasn't if you let let me go out there right down to the street put my hand up and start blowing away so you think anybody should stop for me you'll probably be praying for me in a couple minutes because i probably get run over why because that's not my place it's not my position but see when that policeman walked out there with that badge on with that uniform on with that hat on it man looked silly to the cardinal person but everybody had to recognize when he stood in his position and he blew that whistle in the line of duty everything had to recognize what authority was behind the man so that a centurion understood that being under authority is what granted the authority so he can sit there and look at the lord jesus and say if thy if you're not that you i believe you're the messiah thou art the messiah which means you are the man sent from god the lamb of god for the sins of the world if that be so that means somebody had to send you on the scene did not the lord say he said my father who is greater than i it's your father greater than you so what is he looking for he said because you came under authority there's something back in you all of heaven is back in you all of heaven is backing your word all you need to do is say the word he said if because if in the natural i as a roman centurion when i tell a soldier go do this it's not me saying it it's caesar because he had all of rome behind his word and that soldier knew and he didn't obey he's lucky if he's going to prison he's probably going to the chopping block so he understood the power of authority but the authority could only come underneath the appropriate headship it doesn't come just by doing anything willy-nilly just by doing it any kind of way but it has to be the right place it's got to be the right position you've got to be in the line of duty it's got to be for the purpose otherwise you end up like the sons of scheme well i will preach this because i saw paul do it but they didn't have authority because they weren't under authority and so when anybody runs out there and just wants to do any kind of way all the gospel of the message that william braden preached the devil laugh at you he said well i knew william branham i i knew i knew william branham but who are you but when you when you come underneath that authority when you come under the headship of the holy ghost and this message that's been preached then and you're in the line of duty every demon in hell's got to move out of the way see and we could take that all the way back all the way back it did not the lord even say to moses he said i've come down to deliver them and behold i send you why because god chose the foolishness of preaching he uses man to accomplish his desires in the earth and so moses come under authority and therefore he could go before pharaoh and say let my people go thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go let there be flags and those flies let there be frogs and there was frogs why because all of heaven was backing that word because he was under the authority of the word so how can we expect to have authority if we have not come to the revelation that we need to be under it first submitting ourselves this is where the true nature of the bride of christ comes into view because the nature of the bride is to submit paul said some wives submit yourselves to your husbands paul wasn't just talking about natural here brothers and sisters he said this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church so when you see when you start reading these things when you find out the nature of the bride of jesus christ i'm just going to say this i had this thought a few months ago and i thought about you know as a minister how powerful it is and how important it is it's a scary thing you better not as a minister come and preach your own thoughts you know because when you preach your own thoughts you know what happens you become you become a woman preacher because i can't give you anything i'm part of you i'm part of the bride i'm part of the feminine side but if he will come and speak if the husband will speak to the wife then we got something but if i just come on it'll be eve all over again it'd be eve trying to interpret the word to our own husband to our own people it'll bring death that's why we cannot stray from this message that's why we cannot stray from this word because it was the very mind of the husband coming down to speak to the bride so i can't speak my own thoughts it'll bring death it would be i'd be a woman preacher because i'd just be bride preaching the bride but if he'll come if the holy ghost can get me out of the way and the man can speak let the man speak i want my husband to speak this evening i want i i can't do anything for you but your husband could do everything for you i don't want to speak my own thoughts i don't know anything anyway the lord's given me grace just over 19 years to have a revelation of this message and be serving him according to this this word i feel like i know less now than i did when i started because the more you come to know him the more the littler you become paul was the same way he started out i'm an apostle by the time he ended he said i'm the greatest the sinner chief of sinners you ever you ever heard that if you look at the timeline of the books that paul the the epistles he wrote he starts out talk bragging about being an apostle and if you go in the natural timeline by the time he ends that's where he ends on the chief of sinners why because the more he knew christ the more he knew how little he was that's how the people of god are that's how the people you get closer to god you get more humble you don't start to get built up in pride you don't start to get built up in your own abilities no sir you don't want to be of ashtai how many remember vashtai from the book of esther the king called her and she said i ain't going to the king i'm too busy with all my women over here remember a woman types the this vast i was puffed up in her position i sit as a queen i have need of nothing and no it's not that you're blind miserable wretched poor naked and so you know what the king did he said depose her i'll get you a new one you're the new one amen he wooed the denominations in brother branham's day he wooed them with everything he had he said he shook every gift before him like that little child and they wouldn't take it you know what they did they said i'm gonna the book of esther vashtai she went and had a feast with her women that's what the pentecostals did they went right back to mama right back to the harlots right back to the and had a feast of the women so you know what god said i'll depose you and i'll find a woman that'll come after my own heart i'll find a woman that'll submit to this world i'm going to find me a bride that'll come under headship that he can be buffed up like the first one that's who he's looking for that's who he's found he's found a people that is going to rise up i ain't talking about rising up to anything great according to the world i'm talking about rising up in humility i'm talking about rising up in more sincerity i'm talking about rising up in more love i'm talking about divine love that is so powerful i remember i was just thinking about this quote you could look it up i'm sure you've heard it before brother branham talks about that divine love and he says oh you know you'll get all fussy with one another you're like oh i just can't stand this brother i just can't take this sister he said let something happen to him and watch your heart break for him oh i'm sure look i ain't the pastor so don't get me wrong but as a person who knows people oh i'm sure there's a lot of scruples that go on i'm sure there's a lot of things that go on people get mad at one another and little things start don't you worry the holy ghost is going to get you where you need to be remember iron sharpeneth iron it ain't a pleasant experience he said iron sharpeneth iron so sharpened with you the countenance of your friend yeah the lord uses one another to to beat one another up sometimes just to give you a little bit more love just like the just like the disciples remember james and john said we want to be the greatest and then all the disciples got mad and said what are you doing they got mad about it it's a human response i'm tired of human responses i want to have a supernatural response i want to have a holy ghost response i want to have a get down on my knees and pray for my brother response i want to get down and have my heart break for one another response that's the kind of life that is in each and every one of you i believe it it's in me sometimes i let the flesh get in the way a little too much and it blocks that expression how many of you can say amen to that sometimes you let the flesh get in the way and it blocks the expression but it doesn't mean it's not there it doesn't mean it's not there's something crying out in you it doesn't matter how many times in the natural in your mind have you given up i couldn't count how many times in my mind i've given up what does the song say something keeps holding me every day that i see there's something you can't stop it it's unstoppable because it's deity that was planted in you before the foundation of the world and then when the light of this gospel shone across that seed and brought it to life nothing will stop it reaching its destination yeah you make it you might make it a little harder on yourself it's hard to kick against the pricks you might make it a little bit harder on yourself but it's going to get there just the same why because i think we just heard a brother mention it i talked with it it's fun it's interesting you know i praise the lord for how he does things because you find out that channel of the holy ghost it's universal because you'll be thinking something a little bring a thought in your heart you'll talk about it to another brother and then a week or two later you'll hear someone say the exact same thing and you know you didn't talk to them but you just think about how it fixed this whole thing is brothers and sisters brother branham said oh yeah you can take the permissive will of god and oh every you know the devil as soon as you hear that you know what the devil does he goes permissive will you're going to get spanked it's going to be really bad you're going to suffer it's going to be horrible but you know i have a scripture that says all things work together for good all things work together for good and then even more than that when you think about how the prophet would say come back and say yeah you may take the permissive will but he will turn it around to glorify his perfect will so because we're an intellectual age let's examine that statement intellectually and let's beat the devil down with his own ideas let's take what the prophet said literally let's actually take it for what it means if you find that you've been the devil's always you're in the permissive will of god there's no way you can make it but then the prophet said he'll work it to glorify his perfect will he'll bring it right back around so you can look the devil right in the face and say devil i may have taken the permissive will you know brother branham took the permissive will he did it in south africa when he listened to those men and the angel flat out told him he said you can do it but you're going to suffer that was the permissive will but you know what he did he worked it to his perfect will because then when the cat when the time came see that was a learning experience so now when the time came see brother branham took the permissive will when he rejected the pentecostals the first time around then he suffered lost a wife lost a child tried to kill himself but what was god doing he took that and worked it around for his perfect will so that when the time came then that mighty proclamation could come forth and say because that was chosen the harder way do you realize all of those taken the easier way still didn't stop that pronouncement that should give you a little bit of hope that no matter how many times you may have felt like you took the easy way you're still taking the way with the lord's despised you you're still present forward by his grace and no matter what the devil says or you took the permissive will you can look at the devil and say yes but he'll work it to the perfect will he'll bring it back around so you realize you can never be out of the perfect will in the grand scheme you can't because god's will for you was already finished before the foundation he just wants you to walk in it but brother branham said you'll save yourself and god a lot of trouble but i could take consolation in knowing that even when that doesn't happen he's working all things for my good that doesn't give us an excuse brothers and sisters but it should give you a confidence in god to know that if you would submit yourself under this word he's working on you little by little that potter's hand is breaking you down and building you up breaking you down and building you up sometimes the potter has got to seemingly take you down to a lump again how many of you ever felt broke down like that you felt like you were coming into something and then before you knew it you were just a lumpy mess what was it the potter said oh there might have been an impurity got to get that out so what does he do he starts over again he takes that gold and puts it back in the fire he takes that gold and starts beating on it again but it doesn't stop the master's purpose for your life so what what's the what what happens now brothers and sisters is we got to come just come under accepting the headship of the world stop pushing it away you say oh i'm not good enough yes it's true that's not the point he was good enough you can't do it that's the point he did it for you and now he wants to do it through you you know i was thinking when i first i ministered this message in ohio like a couple months ago and it really you know it's amazing how the lord orders your footsteps because i learned you know i ministered here on the on the different flights and everything like that and we kind of talked about those things and how the lord will use even like your natural things the job and the different things you go through to teach you certain things and i was just struck because as i ministered the lord really brought it and i never even thought about it it was a fresh thing and i just want to share it to you as we close here you know as an air traffic controller i can say the same thing that centurion said according to the national man under authority you know when i sit down at that place and i'm and i'm sitting there and i'm talking airplanes they generally have to do what i tell them to do you know if i tell them to turn left they got to turn left if i tell them to go up they go up they go down they go down all those different things is it my voice that's anything special no is it my ability to fly an aircraft no because i have no idea how to fly an aircraft that's not my job it has nothing to do with that but because the words that i speak the federal government has placed a commission in my hand that said you are an air traffic controller in the national airspace system and you have authority over this airspace when i'm sitting down and what i say is backed by the authority of the federal government and so much that we if if if a pilot were to to do something wrong i can issue what's called a brasher warning and say well you did something wrong you got to call this number brother james probably has heard her heard of that i believe brother james has never had to deal with that because he's such a good pilot but but but but but it has nothing to do with me it's about the position i'm in and and what has been invested in me now if i were to just go out on the tarmac i just start waving around in an airplane and say you go over here and you go over here it wouldn't do me any good but see when i sit down see when i go into my place of work i have to have an identification but when my identification is met the door is open and when the door is open i can walk in the building i want you to catch this spiritually when the doors open i can go in the building and when i sit down at the position that i've been assigned to and i have the appropriate equipment i have an earpiece and i have a thing that i can plug in and a clicker to talk to him so when i'm equipped appropriately and i sit down at the appropriate position and not only that see that's not good enough because now i got to plug into the position see many times we get in trouble because we don't quite plug into the position we're supposed to be in lord help us all i want to be more i want to be more plugged in but see even that's not enough because now that's all well and good but i need to be certified to operate that position so i have to have a certification which means somebody else has signed off that i'm going to do the appropriate job and then when i do that i have to operate according to a certain set of rules i can't just go about doing whatever i want to do but i operate according to a certain set of rules that were given to me but when i meet all those requirements well then what i say goes and that's not puffing me up it's just the way it is and if i could say it the same way it's not puffing the bride of jesus christ but it's the way it is that when the bride of jesus christ comes into her position when she operates according to the set of rules that's been given to her and not just this but a message by a prophet that helps us to understand what this see i could read we i've told you before we have it called the 71 10.65 it's the rules for air traffic control in the national airspace system it's like that thick it's written by lawyers so you tell you how complicated it is to understand but but i couldn't just read that and quickly go into the job but i had to go through training i had to be tutored i had to come to an understanding of what certain things meant because i could read it a certain way and say well i would apply it this way they said well that's not the way it actually works you know there's a one time where maybe we thought we had this down but then along came a prophet and said oh no that's not quite the way it works and he was a vindicated prophet just like my trainers who all trained me they were already certified on the position they already had their credentials so but the bride of jesus christ when she comes into her position and then she operates to the set of rules and then she's been trained and tutored by the holy ghost who's taught her all the rules of the road taught see and what my job see i have to say the right thing at the right time and i have to say it in the right way and then we hear brother matthew preaching that a couple weeks ago about how what was it she said the right thing when you say the right thing at the right time powerful things can happen and see in my job it's the same way i can't just say well go do this and go do that no there's a certain we call it phraseology that i have to use to say it a certain way otherwise it's not obeyed kind of like baptism you know they want to go do it all the ways they want to do but we got to do it the right way and so but when all those things are met then i have to be equipped and so has the lord equipped his bride he equipped her with everything she needs to make it it was already in you from the foundation of the world and if that wasn't enough he gave you a word he gave you a message he gave you a vindicated prophet to prove that you're on the right place and then when you do all that when the bride sits in her position kind of like moses then he could say speak and go forward and that's what i guess the crux of the whole thing as we stand just to kind of end it on that note if we could understand the power of the authority if we'll come under that headship the carnal mind wants to have it their way i want to speak this into existence i want to go do this and do that and do this what if it's not for you to do i want to do what the lord wants for me to do i mean i i'll be honest according to the flesh i'd prefer not to be up here right now in the flesh i not good with groups of people i get very nervous i'm a loner by nature my wife will tell you that because we live together and sometimes she hardly sees me but i want what god wants for me and i don't say that just to be funny i say that because each one of us has a different battle that we're fighting in the flesh not everybody fights those battles not everybody fights the battles that i fight but see you couldn't be an overcomer if he didn't have a battle and so the devil is always trying to tell you that the battle is proof the battle is proof i think brother david our pastor has been saying it just beautifully how the devil if he can get you to think that god's your enemy and all he's done is he's tried to put a god mask on himself because it's always him he's the he's the accuser of the brethren and he tries to make you think that it's the lord brother branham said a powerful statement when he when he i believe he was talking about coming to an understanding of the the true the true oneness of god he said i always used to think that god was angry with me but jesus loved me come to find out what he say he said but jesus christ was the love of god expressed oh my oh oh lord help us to get that full revelation god's not angry with you god wants you to succeed he wants you to succeed so much that he already paved the way all you have to do is be cr i have to say it crazy enough to believe him because the devil's going to tell you that you're crazy your flesh is going to kick and scream every step of the way that's why you got to kill it every day the old man has to die every day take the sword of the word stab him down every day you're not alone paul said the good that i would i do not that that i don't want to do that's what i do oh wretched man that i am but then he comes back at another point and says the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god oh that gives me comfort because it wasn't even his faith he was living by the faith of jesus christ put your faith in the sacrifice that's where it lays and then just come under submission to that word little every bit by bit the devil wants you to finish this thought the devil wants you to think that because you're battling you're failing it's because you're battling because you're you're in the right remember the battle doesn't start till you crossed over jordan you didn't start fighting the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and all the jebusites and everything that's where the real battle started you had some battles out in the wilderness sure but the real battle got hot and heavy when you crossed that jordan now that that was okay this guy's first this guy's serious this brother and sister's serious they're really going to serve god now so now i got to pay some attention to him so don't be discouraged just pick up the sword and start cutting it doesn't need to be any if i could say it this way supernatural thing because jesus in the wilderness just used the word just the simple word he that begun a good work in you is faithful to complete it i know the thoughts that i have towards you thought the peace if not an evil to give you an expected end you know we had a glimpse of that expected end when we had a prophet go beyond the curtain of time that's my expected end i expect to throw my hands around brother branham and say my precious brother that's part of my expected end and i'm claiming it won't you claim it tonight and say i don't care what it looks like let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord maybe just a little bit of a broken up message this evening father but lord i want to come underneath the headship of your word i want to find that authority of your word that i can only find when i come under the headship of my husband lord i don't want to have my own thoughts i don't want to have my own ideas lord i don't want to have my own desires i don't want to have my own dreams lord i think so often of that song that we sing all of my ambitions hopes and plans i surrender these into your hands lord i think back onto how many big plans that i had when i was coming out of high school and thoughts that i had that i thought i was going to do this and do that and lord according to the nature you had to upend all those things and i didn't understand why until just a few months after that you brought this message across my path that i might not have ever heard if it wasn't for your grace to strip all those dreams away from me lord at the time lord being a christian in a denominational church i thought maybe you were out to get me or that you didn't love me but i found out later on lord it was because you loved me that you took all those things away so you could express your love to me through your election that you explained to me and showed to me and continue to show lord i pray for each one here lord that you just help them to make their calling and election sure lord that we could just be more sure of your word oh god that we could look to the sacrifice lord that we'd look to you that we'd look to calvary lord to look to the empty tomb and to the blood that was shed for us oh god that cleanses us from all unrighteousness that we would know with a surety lord that we stand before you it's perfectly spotless lord not because we've done any great thing but because we've trusted the work of calvary lord we've trusted a word that we've heard in our day lord we're going to come underneath that headshot lord we're going to submit ourselves to the word of this message that you've brought through the word of a prophet lord even as rebecca lord heard eliezer's call and said i'll go with him and lord what did she do but she stayed with that messenger all the way until she saw her isaac in that field and lord even then when she saw her isaac in the field what did she do but she she failed herself she came under headship she submitted herself lord to her husband lord i just want to surrender myself to my husband once again lord lord i just want to submit all of my desires to you all my thoughts all of my own thinking lord i don't want to look at anything intellectual and immoral god but i want to look at it through the eyes of faith lord i i don't want to live in this intellectual civilization lord but your prophet said in a place father that we'd be living in a faith civilization lord and i want to live in that faith civilization father i'm tired of looking at myself lord i believe each one here could say the same thing but we're going to look to you from now on lord we're going to be just like enoch and walk with you day by day step by step little by little lord it doesn't matter what all the things around us look like father but we're gonna look lord to the mark of the high calling set before us lord we just submit ourselves to you father this night we give you glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray [Music] getting amen the pull i felt was more than i could have and i was on the verge of giving over the strength within myself just wasn't there something keeps holding me every day i see helping me faithfully to overcome my trials he's guiding me constantly giving me victory [Music] is a reality cause something keeps holding me satan laid before [Music] and something keeps holding me every day i see he's helping me faithfully to overcome he's guiding me constantly [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen i enjoyed that i thought there was such an outstanding statement that was made he said being under authority is what gives you authority just think of that you know we always want to prove it but if you come under authority the authority comes natural amen i thought what a wonderful uh revelation heading into our meetings if we could just bring ourselves under the authority of the world make contact with them then then we can put ourselves in position to see what god could do for us i i don't think there's anything that could be added to that i hope the beauty of the simplicity of it it does and even jesus says i do nothing except the father shows me i was fellowshipping just a little bit ago with somebody and i said jesus said the scripture says he learned obedience by the things he suffered i can't even wrap my mind around that but it starts being under authority gives you authority let's just think on that as we go forward that what a wonderful calling we have to come under this objection to be a to be a a bride and to love them and serve them and lord i i need that tonight that's my heart's desire hey man billy give us a song to sing and we'll have a word of prayer and we'll worship the lord and we'll be dismissed this evening take this word with you amen take we think it in your mind if i'm under authority it gives me authority if i'm obedient he'll take everything amen our gracious heavenly father lord what a wonderful word from you this evening to get the things in the right order in the right perspective father if we just come under your authority then whatsoever things we ask they shall be done oh god that's just such a rich thing lord i love that about the centurion he didn't say i am a man of authority but because i'm under authority i understand what authority is i've experienced god telling me do this and do that i know what it's like oh father i pray that in our each individual life that sets deep in our heart being under authority is what gives us authority granted lord jesus we pray in your precious name we pray amen god bless you sing this as you are dismissed tonight and worship the lord and just take this word with you it's your secret amen it's a great secret tonight really wonderful amen [Music] one with the other [Music] what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus christ [Music] is jesus you didn't want heaven without us jesus [Music] my saying was great your love was greater one [Music] what a beautiful name [Music] of jesus christ [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] you
