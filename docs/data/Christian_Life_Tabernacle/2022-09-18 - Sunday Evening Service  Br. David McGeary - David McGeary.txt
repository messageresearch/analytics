in Jesus name we pray amen amen isn't God good you know I love Sunday evening because uh you know when you come to church Sunday evening you're coming to church with those that are going in the rapture yep and so that's good we called out all the make-believers and all the unbelievers and and so we're just here now with the elect and so I just enjoy no I I don't mean that but uh uh I I just I like Sunday evenings I like the the Warmness of it um and the fact that you know you really can enjoy the word of God and and I enjoy the word of God don't you we're going to listen to a few moments of a message this evening uh but I didn't tell that let's open our Bibles to uh uh First Corinthians the fourth chapter and um and the first five verses that brother Branham refers to this scripture in a statement that he makes and I thought it was good and so it says in the fourth chapter of the first uh epistle to the Corinthians it says let a man sow account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God that's how I account My Messenger for my age as a steward of the mysteries of God Amen moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment yea I judge not my own self for I know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby Justified but he that justify me is the Lord amen therefore judge nothing before its time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsel of the hearts and them shall then shall every man have Praise of God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word and your precious name we pray amen God bless you that again this evening as we just speak on a few things and share a little bit before we listen to this wonderful portion of message I like to read a statement I wanted to read this this morning but he says here he says we find out in Revelations 3 that at the lady of CIA age which we are now living in to my interpretation of the scriptures that when the message has come forth of the ladies age and as it did in each age and each age had a messenger that we come forth in this last day and find out that the church was very rich and they were so disagreeable with him they put him out of the church now that's got to be Pride to the max but he said do you ever wonder why they put him out of the church because they got so disagreeable with them they disagreed with what his dress standards was they disagreed with what his Holiness was they disagreed with what he thought was important and where their lives should be and how they should live and how they should worship and they just they got so they just disagreed with them so much that they they put him out of the church because it's the only church age that we find even through the Well we'd think of the Ephesian age and the Sardis and the church ages that they were and down through the Philadelphia and Wesley age and so forth even into all the ages he was not put out but in the lady of certain seeing Church age he was on the outside but was still knocking trying to get into his people and with this divine presence as it was when he was on Earth God was in one person now God is in his church his life divided among his people God living among them trying to unite them together in a mystical body of Christ which is called the bride and when he's trying to do that and he will do it for as the prophet said it coming forth his Forerunner of his first Advent said God is able of these stones to rise up children and today when the blessings fall upon the Pentecostals years ago and they separated themselves seemingly not having the faith God is able of methodists and Orthodox and so forth of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham amen so that's what he did he called us out of denominations raising up Stones children to Abraham and did you ever think my brethren did you ever come to you in the scriptures that that very day that the sleeping virgin come to buy oil that was the day when he come when you see Greek Orthodox episcopalians Methodist Baptists Presbyterians coming in hungering for this where can we get this oil remember it was the hour that the bridegroom came let us watch our investment where they pay off amen what great uh word advice and then this other statement here I I think is uh I like it very much and he speaks here and he says now notice the day of man if you want to put it down I was going to read it Corinthians 4 1 to 5 apartment Corinthians 4 1-5 was Paul speaking of being judged by man in man's day the day why do you call it man's day for you would say it's the day that the works by the knowledge of man is glorified so that's why it's man's day because this is the day that the works of man's knowledge is being glorified right the great Technologies and and uh I was visiting this afternoon uh with uh my bookkeeper and and we were fellowshipping and I said you know it's always a bad time when you have lunch with your bookkeeper and she said well don't worry Brother David because he I says now with 187 000 new IRS agents I'm sure they're going to come after me she said no she said don't worry because nowadays everything's done electronically you send your electronic form and they electronically teach to you they they look electronically they go search all the data all your spending all the W-2 forms everything anybody's reported of you and they've gathered any of that data and if there's one little bit of discrepancy the computer automatically shoots out a letter to you and nobody's even seen it or touched it yet and she was telling me she said that when you go for further education now they don't tell you talk to you about books and the numbers and tax things they just teach you how not to excite the computer now that's gloring in man's look at your cell phones look at the WhatsApp look at apps the app apps everywhere I asked somebody a question the other day and they grabbed their phone and they they moved and that was a page of apps and they moved another page of apps and another page app that I guarantee you they had 20 pages of apps how in the world do you use so many apps they got an app for everything I think the real word should be ape but they they've got it they've got it for for everything so why is this the day of man because it's the day that man's glory in his achievement all that he's accomplished in in all the great things that he's done and make glory in that and they glory in that and anything that relates to God is out of the picture because they're a carnal and God's spiritual he says he says why do you call it man's day for you would say it's the day that the works by knowledge of man is glorified what's all the bragging of the Communists and somebody trying to get somebody to the Moon God's trying to get somebody to heaven now here they are they're trying to get you to the Moon they're trying to get to Mars they want to live forever and hear eternal life is free see but look how they're spending millions and billions and trillions of dollars in a wasted effort when they get there they ain't gonna find nothing I mean that's that's such vanity right what's the matter with them I don't care about the moon I want to pass the moon so far I won't even see it just keep going higher I want to pass the Milky Way and go go on just keep going yes that's what we're about and if you are going to be about that in life you're certainly going to find out that uh that uh the things of God are foolishness to man I mean they're trying to get technology to go to Mars and you're sitting back waiting for a spirit to change you to take you to heaven you think that makes you look smart I think that makes you look like a genius myself because that's what's going to happen because God said so the same God that says Let There be lights the same God that's going to call for the rapture and all those whose names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life is going to be there now let's go in as we're talking about the Rapture being so uh important to us I think it's important that we understand what's going on out in our country and and because you know our country type types the move of civilization from east to west and we know spiritually the sun the sun moves for the east to west naturally we know that civilizations move from east to the West we know the gospel and moved from the East to the west and ended up on Sunset mountain with the mysteries of God for the age being related so we begin to understand the age that we're living in the little section that we're going to listen to is out of a continuation out of the message of the God of this evil age and and and we'll what this portion's talking about is how Satan has positioned himself in a place of worship by mankind and and how do they worship him they worship Him by accepting his knowledge and his thoughts and and so man's accepting their knowledge and look at what's happening into our schools whether we realize it or not Satan is being taught in our school they took prayer out they got all these kind of theories and they got all this kind of uh new morality teaching and everything and and most of the problem is is that those teachers have come out of liberal colleges they've been educated in the system and now they think it's real important that you teach your children uh how to accept uh except ungodliness in others they don't teach that God made them male and female nope that's out you you know if you want to keep your children safe from perversion teach them what perversion is you got to because you've got to remember he's out there trying to teach them something else I mean the books that they have now and the books that are on the shelves and and I've said this to you before because our children are back there uh in uh a Sunday school our best effort to try to let them know that there's another teaching that exists and it's the teaching of the word of God and the and the they they've gained such power that they don't even want to voice to rise up against it and speak against it make it a crime to preach the gospel but it's the truth anyway and the only thing that sets you through free is the truth and the only thing that's going to keep the delusion and the deception from overtaking is the true word of God and and the prophet of God will talk about this and I want to read this before we play it because uh maybe with me reading it and then you seeing it and then listening to it it'll kind of uh catch it in our heart that we recognize what is the atmosphere that we have to grow in and I'm not talking about the spiritual atmosphere we have to grow spiritually in a very desperate dry land and and it's going to take rain and Leadership from the Holy Spirit and God's grace and mercy to get us through this darkness and he gave us a guide through this Darkness he gave us a voice to lead us through this darkness in fact he predestinated and knew that we would be here and because he knew we were be here he made Provisions for us in order to not be deceived but I'd like to read just a couple statements and then we'll play it's about 15 minutes long but um he makes this little statement here and uh and I I thought it was uh uh pretty good now we know that anything that was planted any seed that's planted it always returns back or heads back up into the seed that went into the ground unless it's something that's hybrid and that means it's been taken out of God's natural process and man has injected His science and knowledge and then it can't reproduce which only shows that when man injects His science and knowledge into something it dies but God's seed is designed to live eternally and so we're in that age that everything's coming up and so and we know that Eve uh bet uh she's it it wasn't that she didn't believe God no but she but she what she did is she believed in air just a little twist or a misinterpretation of the word of God that's why we understand a way of a true Prophet is to stay with the word of God so you've got to be careful because we're living in a day of a lot of voices you've got to know and and there's no reason for us to take second-hand revelation we have full access to uh The Source itself but and so in the garden he says Satan never come out and said oh well that's not even the word of God he admitted it was the word of God but he put his own interpretation to it which God plainly told them not to do it so that that's the same age we're in now that man's putting his interpretation to the word of God you want to know how to know exactly what the true interpretation of the word of God is stay with the messenger because the prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word of God no matter how enticing that it sounds how blessed it sounds how beautiful the promises it it sounds No matter how it feels like the spirit's moving and and what signs and wonders are done we've been taught over and over and over and over again if it's not according to the word leave it alone Satan appears as an angel of Light and he's got a little spin in a little twist now remember when that bullet leaves that Barrel if it's not straight in line it's only this far away in the beginning but the farther down range it goes the farther away it hits and the farther if you don't if you don't examine everything that comes to you and put it through the filter of God's word if you Church chasing something that's not right it'll move you farther away and you'll be farther off the word of God now we always believe that God will correct you and bring it but it's a lot easier to take care of things right at the beginning than letting him grow into a seed form and then this little last statement I could read this also he says now he says he says now and as he quickened who were once he says and you has he quickened who were once dead in trespassing sin Quicken means to be what brought to life so he brought you to life when you were once dead and in in sin and trespasses wherein times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience so you used to be walked in that spirit until he quickened you and made you alive from it and now he goes on and I thought this would think he says if the Antichrist begin there in the infancy of disobedience now look what he said here he said you know sometimes we don't think the uh how important it is to obey every word of God but the Antichrist Spirit began in its infancy in the spirit of disobedience so just those little foxes though that little bit of Disobedience that little bit of not being disagreeable with them and and and just not accepting first of all maybe it was water baptism maybe it was The Cutting of hair maybe it was the wearing of makeup maybe all these little seeds of Disobedience but that that was the Antichrist in its infancy was just a spirit of disobedience but now he says what will it be when it's headed up in the person of the Antichrist how deceptive it'll be so just that little bit of Disobedience that little bit of letting down the bars it conditions you for a greater deception so it's real important to learn to have principles that you stand by things that you don't say things you don't do places you don't go things you don't listen to well you know and and I know music is one of the tools that Satan uses and Something's Got a certain beat and it's got a certain thing and and the lyrics might be real good but you gotta just be able to sit there if something like that comes and let the spirit that's in you judge it some of that stuff just isn't edifying if you get caught up into the beat you can almost feel the spirit just kind of move away from you and the pleasure of the song move in don't be disobedient to that Holy unction because that's always Satan is infancy moving to something greater he says how much more powerful of deception could an adult give to the world than an infant child and it says the spirit of delusion now working in the children of disobedience to the word so we got that's one little point the prop you're going to hear the prophet make and I just I'd like that to set in because this take this is an age that it takes real discipline and we're what we're preaching what we're talking about is the discipline of the believer in order to make the rapture and then I'll just read this paragraph uh it's kind of beautiful you I don't you can put it up there if you'd like God of this evil age uh paragraph 65 page 16. it says now in these messages I want to emphasize the things that I have told you in the message of this evening light that God would come that God said would come upon the Earth now notice man the Beast that was to come upon the Earth would deceive all whose names were not put in the Lamb's Book of Life slaying before the foundation of the world you're living in a world that is going to be totally deceived the prophet of God said they would have no more common decency and no common sense whatsoever in God's Own thinking God the great spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was God and did you know you were in him then if you are a Christian now you was in him then and then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then so if you were in God's thinking in the beginning right and and you were a part of him then and he summed all that up right and put all the word and everything into Jesus Christ then when he went to the Cross you went there with them you were in him then for he was the fullness of the word made manifested knowing that we would be manifested later Hallelujah amen he put us there took care of everything because he knew we'd be manifested later you're not a secret to God he's got something for us hallelujah he says and and we was at Calvary with him we went in the grave with him and we raised with him in his resurrection and now we've ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grace setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus always for as The Germ of the Natural Life is brought down germanized from father to father to father to father so is the Life of Christ germatized that's the reason God used the spirit Elijah's Spirit five different times what is it it's the handing down just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world Hallelujah so that spirit's been handed down the traits you have is handed down you know now that that I'm pretending to meet people's grandchildren and people and my friends children I can look at them and say why you look just like you look just like your dad or you look just like your grandpa or or can you look you can actually see those traits passed down well they're spiritual traits of the father that are passed down so Keys past these spiritual traits down to you he can uh he says the predestined before the foundation wrote and when the entire word of God is complete complete and headed up in the human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there well I never felt he made me pay for my sins but he he made me pay for him there in other words he because I was in him I get the benefits of it I like that don't you he said and uh for my sins in him there and he rose and he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over the devil oh if you could only believe what God has given well if God can prophesy the condition of this world and we can see that wouldn't that allow us to come back and see that this is true also but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe and you're afraid to move you'll never use it that's what we want to overcome we want to come overcome the fear in this evil world of using the grace and the knowledge and the revelation of God's word to live our lives you'll never use it but if you are seated there and you will use it for your ordained to do what you do amen so the Lord bless you I you're going to hear this over again it has the messenger but uh mother Branham says so many things in such a small amount of time that we're only going to listen to 15 minutes and it's worthy of three hours of discussion but okay just let let the food of God's word uh bless you for a few moments tonight and again tonight we're we're kind of experimenting with our Sunday school so if you have any feedback uh please uh let us know we'd be so happy to hear from you God bless you as we listen to our messenger we're starting on paragraph uh I believe it's uh let me tell you the paragraph number I I guess you can look it up on your phones or your tablets if you wish but we're starting at paragraph 57 of cloud of this evil age and we're going through to the end of paragraph uh of paragraph 76. So I I just think it's real uh wonderful as brother Branham shows us how that Satan climbed the throne to become the god of this evil age thank you God bless you that down he purchased now back to there you block other ages you belong to the nominations you belong to this that or the other what happened to the denominational stalk it dries up the spirit keeps leaving it going on and it heads up in a seed you see and the temptation of both heads back the same way it was at the beginning notice don't don't know don't forget it now uh John first John four five six if you want to put that down he putseth the spirit of error Eve never just simply walked out willfully say I don't believe in God no he was the error she believed Satan never come out and said oh well that's not even the word of God he admitted it was the word of God but he put his own interpretation to it which God plainly told him not to do it what does this do it makes a strong delusion for the people to believe a lie and be damned divine now if you want to read that second Thessalonians 2 11. as I have about quite a few scriptures here we won't be able to read them all one now and then I'll give them to you as it seems strange that you're questioned or something and we might put it down and read for your uh you're good making a strong delusion as the Bible said it would second Thessalonians this man of sin would come into existence and set in the temple of God showing himself he was God and cause the people to go into strong delusions to believe a lie believe it would be damned by that's the same thing he did to Eve Giver never never told her the word wasn't right but give her a strong delusion that she believed a lie the spirit of delusion is of the devil Devil's now working in the children of Disobedience Disobedience to love what's the children of this day disobedient to like Eve was at the beginning the true word of God right now if you were going to get that let's turn to it Ephesians 2 just to make it close it seems good that we uh stop this if you're in no big hurry and read some of this Ephesians 2 1-2 and you has he quickened who were once dead in trespasses in sin worry at times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience children of disobedience and if the Antichrist beginning there in the infancy of disobedience what will it be when it heads up in the person of the Antichrist how deceptive it'll be how much more powerful of deception Coulda and adopt yield to the world than an infant child and he said the spirit of of delusion now working in the children of Disobedience disobedient to the word notice now I want to dwell on this just a minute the children of disobedience a child did you know you your beginning I can prove by God's word that you any person in your was a lie in your great grandfather and your great grandfather you were produced down to your grandfather then to your father and then to you you know that the Bible said I believe it's Hebrews 7 that male Cassidy when Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings Abraham paid Melchizedek hiding of all the spoils and here's Paul saying now that Levi who received tithes was yet he paid times for he was yet in the loins of Abraham when he met Melchizedek so whatever that Abraham did then we find that Levi was then in Abraham which was his great grandfather Abraham begot Isaac Isaac we got Jacob Jacob begot the Patriarchs Leva now then you see here comes into perfect view predestination uh in these messages I want to set and to emphasize the things that I have told you in the message of this evening life that God said would come upon the Earth and notice man the Beast that was to come up on the Earth would deceive all whose names were not put in the Lamb's Book of life's land before the foundation of the world in God's Own thinking God the great spirit in the beginning before that was the beginning he was God and did you know you were in him then if you are a Christian now you was in him then if that be sold the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and then when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later and we was at Calvary with him we went in the grave with him and we raised with him and his resurrection and now we've ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus always for as The Germ of natural life is brought down germanized from father to father to father to father so is the Life of Christ germatized that's the reason God uses Elijah's Spirit five different times what is it it's a handing down just as your natural life and traces handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose the raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't bleed and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do payroll on the other side was raised up for this purpose the Bible said to be Pharaoh Judas iscaris was raised up to be the son of perdition now notice these great truths that we are approaching now we see that the church refuse to accept God's word to rule over them and accepted Barabbas instead now if you want the scripture on that's Matthew 27 15 to 23. what did this do what position did this do now think of it when the church World in its organized line of righteous holy man as they thought they were and were in the eyes of the people they crucified Jesus and said we'll not have this man rule over us and Jesus was the fullness of the word of God first John 1 expresses it and they said will not have this word of God to rule over yet he was the word but their eyes were blind into what he was for he was the direct answer to every prophecy that was to come to pass any now we all believe that because we're looking back to see it happen but if the world will it is now this present evil age that would have been back there at that time they'd do the same thing they're doing today because it's still the same word for this age being manifested did you do it they can't do nothing else they are children of disobedience given a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by notice when the church world would not accept Jesus the word manifested of that day because why they hadn't interpreted another way but they ought to have known that he was that word because everything that God said he would do he did it and he said to him search the scriptures for this hour and if I do not meet the qualification that was spoke for me to do then don't believe me they said we believe Moses he said if you were to believe Moses you would have believed me for Moses spoke of me and still they didn't see it the very God Of Heaven dying on the cross was saying the same words the prophet said he would say and still they didn't see it okay they were not of his kind they was not the word not the word and they yet they were very religious but they was not the word or it would recognize his place for that hour notice how beautiful the scriptures tie themselves together in every age notice now and when the church world would not have the word of God to rule over them they accepted a murderer Barabbas what did this do it exalted Satan the God of this evil age to a place that he's always wanted now listen for Satan is not spoke of as a god of any other age but this age he once spoke of the god of the age of Noah you once spoke of of the god of the age of Moses the god of the age of Elijah but this evil age he is the oh don't miss it he is the god of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it but let's let the scripture uncovering this morning and let's see then you'll know let the scripture as in the meetings of discernment when the Holy Spirit gets among his word and he calls out this man and says you have no business living with this other woman what did you do that for 10 years ago when you run off of that man's wife what's he doing uncovered him exposing Satan that's got the man bound or the woman living with some other uh woman's husband are the sins that they've done the things that they have done what does it do exposing the doctors take instruments and try to find what's wrong they can't do it we can't tell but then the Holy Spirit comes out and reveals what he is and exposes him see that's what the word of God is it is a light that shines in darkness and when you take a noise in the room it sounds mysterious a bunch of something working and you don't know what it is turn on the light quickly crickets roaches they're they are children of the darkness and when the light flashes they scatter away they went out from us because it wasn't of us the Bible said they cannot live in the light of the world for the god of Heaven is sent his light in this last days and he might lightened the path or his children as they might not walk in darkness and stumble but they might walk in the light of The Shining of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen isn't that wonderful I mean isn't it wonderful that this is the kind of voice and knowledge and Revelation that is available to us don't we see what's going on don't we you say how could things get so bad it's because it's being passed down it's being passed down that's what it was from the beginning they were disbelievers from the beginning because that's what he he said that's what he told them he said you are of your fathers the devil that's why you don't hear me that's why you don't listen to my word that's why you don't recognize who I am and so the spirit's just been passed down it's been passed down and then you notice what he said just that little time of that Disobedience how it's it's set in position when they rejected the word Jesus Christ and they crucified him and said give us Barabbas right then they exalted Satan to a place where he was worshiped think of it and they put the seed into the ground that's what they did they rejected it the Catholic Church came on the scene because it is slaughtered millions of believers brought the church into total darkness where it went into the ground and and it was all lost in Catholicism no true understanding they had a pope as a Vicar of Christ they had people going into boxes uh confessing their sins to priests lighting candles all this was done in the name of the Lord and it's not one thing to do with the predestinated seed of God but it came up because God promised he said it had to go into the ground and it's coming up and what's that Spirit been it was passed on from justification the sanctification it was passed on from sanctification to the restoration of gifts now to the true word of God and the opening of the Mysteries the same Spirits been passed down so he said just he said in the temptation of the two heads coming together so you understand it right now he's he's manifesting himself and he's bringing all his children into strong delusion and God's manifesting himself bringing all the predestinated in the left and this is where we are that's why you sit back and you you just can't imagine them teaching the things they teach and saying the things they say you can't imagine them letting criminals out of jail you can't imagine it no fine no crime no them they release them release them you know why because they released Barabbas and here comes the Same Spirit in our day you read it on the news all the time this man killed somebody he was just in jail for six months and they let him loose they let him loose they let him loose so where did that come from where does man get to the place he does it because they don't realize it but that Spirit was passed down on them that's why they're there that's why then they've done all these things before and they've been taught they've been taught and they've been taught to think that way taught to do that way you know the Bible says that that to agree with them swiftly and then he says that those that are in Authority are the Angels of God carrying out the wrath of God and the will of God and they've got no respect for him they just they just it's total delusion look you've got to understand this is happening why is it happening because it's been passed down Through the Ages so I don't know what time it is but now I know exactly how much of those children the Sunday School teachers can stand if at any one time so they've all come back and enjoying this but so don't if if I can say this if if we see what's been passed down if we can see that they're doing the same thing they did when they let Luca Barabbas we can see the same thing that that's going on because that spirit's been handed down handed down we can see the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah right because that Spirit was what handed down and here we are now in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah we're here we are in the days of Noah marriage giving and where did that come from because they've been handed down it's been to us they could never accept the truth because it wasn't in them they're the children of Disobedience you understand they're going to disobey the word of God they can't help it they can't even follow the law their own laws wouldn't it be terrible to have a spirit of disobedience how many people don't have communion how many churches don't have communion and foot washing I don't care how great they preach it's disobedience plain disobedient it's just what it is I can't help it you say well how do you know at least I had an example that I can look to and and and and I have a scripture the Paul said be followers of man of myself also be followers of me as I'm a follower of Christ well then I can look and see I have the same messenger that preached the same thing he did and I can look to him again he's my example because he's a prophet in a way of a true Prophet to stay with the word of God and leave the examples to the word of God he's my guide he's my voice how can people believe that that's the voice of God the voice of the Divine interpreter go back and read through this message how many times the prophet of God said God will perform this through Malachi 4. God will perform it through Malachi 4. God will perform it through Malachi 4. it takes Malachi 4. it takes a fulfillment of Malachi 4. it takes Elijah the prophet it takes how many times does he say it and people just why in this age is The Voice of the messenger outside of the church because they put it out they put it out and it's not alarming to everybody it ought to be alarming honestly it ought to be alarming the condition but we sit back and we understand and are further coming to the revelation that it takes revelation takes predestination something had to be passed down to you from the spirit of God that makes you hunger and thirst after the true word of God and to me this is part of rapturing condition you say brother McGarry you're just on a you're just on a hobby horse yeah yeah I want to be on the hobby horse of God's word I don't want to be on one of those four horses I want to be on the one that came back that said had on its side the word of God that's the horse we want to ride it's the word of God God has provided us and now he strictly shows us that that Disobedience to the word position Satan to be worshiped by millions and billions and they don't even know it and we wouldn't have known it right because we were once in darkness living under the spirit that now lives in the children of Disobedience but the voice of God cut you free from that spirit and now set you free to live in the glory and the knowledge and the revelation of his word so I I I I'm just so thankful that the path to the rapture has been revealed to us it was hidden simplicity veiled in the ministry of a church age messenger but yet there was the secret and the path and the key to the way out of here let's hold to it amen believe me this message will get you raptured you can trust it you can count on it it's life and it's life more abundant so God bless you tonight I I'm I'm anxious to hear this Sunday school report and the things that they need and I think next week it's uh what is the uh 9 10 11 12 8
