[57:36] amen
[57:38] amen he's worthy of our praise
[57:42] amen you know what i like that because
[57:43] we have a we have a double witness
[57:46] of a promise because he said wherever
[57:48] two or three are gathered he would be
[57:50] there in the midst but he also said he
[57:52] inhabits the praises of his people
[57:54] so we have a double confirmation that
[57:57] he's here with us right now amen
[57:59] praise the lord we're standing on the
[58:01] promises of god
[58:03] amen we just appreciate the word of the
[58:05] lord this morning
[58:07] amen how many appreciated the word this
[58:09] morning amen i've it fed my soul
[58:12] amen i was telling brother billy in the
[58:14] back you know he's talking about
[58:15] bringing under conviction everything i
[58:16] say i just think
[58:18] hey it brings me under conviction
[58:20] and then i repent and then it washes me
[58:22] clean
[58:24] you know that's what i love about the
[58:25] lord it's it's the lord he provides
[58:27] everything that you have needed
[58:29] you need go nowhere else if i could say
[58:32] it like this without sounding
[58:33] sacrilegious our lord jesus is a
[58:35] one-stop salvation shop
[58:38] you don't have to go anywhere else
[58:40] the same word that convicts you
[58:42] is the same word that you can bring
[58:44] before the father the promises that he's
[58:46] given
[58:47] underneath that shed blood and it's the
[58:49] same word that'll wash you clean and
[58:51] bring you deeper into his presence so
[58:53] you don't have to fear anything you
[58:55] don't have to worry about anything thank
[58:56] the lord for the conviction
[58:58] the fact that you you know in this age
[59:00] when everybody's numb to sin
[59:02] everywhere they just go around doing
[59:04] whatever they want to do the scripture
[59:06] said in the book of judges it said every
[59:07] man did that which was right in their
[59:09] own eyes and if we're not living in that
[59:11] hour right now
[59:13] where else are we living
[59:15] everybody just does whatever they feel
[59:16] like doing that's their motto if it
[59:18] feels good just go ahead and do it but
[59:20] there's something about a christian
[59:23] that even just seeing those things it
[59:26] burdens you
[59:27] it pricks your heart just to even hear
[59:29] about it or see it by the scripture says
[59:31] it's even a shame
[59:32] just to talk about the things that they
[59:33] do in secret
[59:35] praise the lord for the convicting power
[59:38] of the holy ghost in your life
[59:41] not everybody's got that brothers and
[59:42] sisters
[59:43] sometimes we take it for granted because
[59:45] we get we have this bountiful
[59:48] word that we've received and the
[59:50] storehouses are open to us
[59:52] but we ought to be so humble so thankful
[59:54] so grateful
[59:56] for the holy ghost that can come by your
[59:58] heart and knock at that door and say
[1:00:00] well you need to open up this area of
[1:00:02] your life
[1:00:03] you need to open up this little spot
[1:00:04] that that was just preached on today you
[1:00:07] know i know it's not it's not any any
[1:00:09] minister that would get up here it's not
[1:00:10] anybody's wish to make anybody feel bad
[1:00:12] that's not the point
[1:00:15] but he said he makes his ministers flame
[1:00:17] a fire
[1:00:18] what is it sometimes they need that
[1:00:19] fireball to go in there and just cleanse
[1:00:21] out the enemy
[1:00:22] just scour it all clean and you know
[1:00:24] what's the best sterilizer but fire
[1:00:27] come through and sterilize all the stuff
[1:00:28] you know you're rubbing shoulders with
[1:00:30] the world all week and then you get a
[1:00:32] couple days out of the week you know
[1:00:34] even if the services go long you may
[1:00:36] have nine to ten hours out of the week
[1:00:38] that you're here in the sanctuary and i
[1:00:40] think how many hours are there in a week
[1:00:41] seven times 24 is 168 hours i think
[1:00:45] something like that 106.00 10
[1:00:48] give or take hours out of 168 a week
[1:00:51] that you're able to be here amongst the
[1:00:53] believers in a larger group and the rest
[1:00:56] of the week you got to pick up that
[1:00:57] sword and shield and you got to go up
[1:00:59] there and start fighting
[1:01:00] you know that's why i kind of wanted to
[1:01:01] sing that kind of more maybe an upbeat
[1:01:03] song as we're getting into the work
[1:01:04] because it's a battle
[1:01:07] we're going into a battle we're going
[1:01:09] into a scriptural warfare
[1:01:12] so close jesus said it would deceive the
[1:01:13] very elected if it were possible but how
[1:01:15] many elected do we have in here so
[1:01:17] thereby by definition it can't deceive
[1:01:20] you
[1:01:20] because it's not possible
[1:01:22] so praise the lord for that
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:25] amen thank you
[1:01:26] musicians
[1:01:28] we're standing on the promises of god
[1:01:31] let's turn to the book of isaiah
[1:01:35] chapter 55
[1:01:37] already reaching for the water
[1:01:39] praise the lord for the water
[1:01:45] isaiah chapter 55
[1:01:47] and then from here
[1:01:50] we will go to philippians chapter 2.
[1:01:55] isaiah chapter 55 will read verses 6
[1:01:57] through 11.
[1:02:01] i don't know about you but i am
[1:02:04] earnestly and just
[1:02:08] i can't even you can't even put it into
[1:02:10] words but you're just painstakingly
[1:02:15] yearning for the coming of the lord
[1:02:18] this world doesn't hold anything for me
[1:02:20] anymore
[1:02:21] i'm so tired of it i'm sick of it
[1:02:24] i'm tired of seeing the things of the
[1:02:26] world and
[1:02:28] having that devil trying to constantly
[1:02:29] push things in your face all the time
[1:02:31] and all the things that you have to deal
[1:02:33] with but you know what praise the lord
[1:02:34] we have a refuge
[1:02:36] the word of god
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] he's a strong tower that the righteous
[1:02:41] run into and are safe
[1:02:43] isaiah chapter 55 will read verses 6
[1:02:45] through 11
[1:02:47] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[1:02:50] call ye upon him while he is near
[1:02:53] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[1:02:55] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:02:57] return unto the lord and he will have
[1:02:59] mercy upon him
[1:03:01] and to our god for he will abundantly
[1:03:03] part
[1:03:04] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:03:06] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:03:08] lord for as the heavens are higher than
[1:03:10] the earth so are my ways higher than
[1:03:12] your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:03:14] thoughts
[1:03:15] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:03:17] from heaven and returneth not thither
[1:03:18] but watereth the earth and maketh that
[1:03:20] bring forth and bud that it may give
[1:03:22] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[1:03:24] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:03:27] of my mouth
[1:03:28] just think about that just let's read
[1:03:30] that scripture again
[1:03:32] for as the
[1:03:33] verse 10 for as the rain cometh down and
[1:03:36] the snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:03:38] there but watereth the earth and make it
[1:03:40] that bring forth and bud
[1:03:42] why that it may give seed to the sower
[1:03:45] and bread to the eater
[1:03:47] so shall my word be that go forth out of
[1:03:49] my mouth
[1:03:50] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:03:52] every word
[1:03:54] and whether you realize it or not as the
[1:03:56] word goes forth as it went forth this
[1:03:57] morning as it went forth than any other
[1:03:58] service you've been in that word is
[1:04:00] watering your ground
[1:04:02] you don't necessarily feel it
[1:04:04] that's why i love the prophet he talked
[1:04:06] it's in an age of pentecostalism where
[1:04:08] everything's about feelings doesn't
[1:04:10] matter whether you feel it i praise the
[1:04:11] lord for the feelings i feel good right
[1:04:13] now i feel like if we're in the presence
[1:04:16] of the lord i praise the lord for that
[1:04:17] but i don't base it on my feelings
[1:04:19] either
[1:04:20] it shall not return unto me void but it
[1:04:22] shall accomplish that which i please and
[1:04:24] it shall prosper in the thing whereto i
[1:04:28] sent it amen let's turn over to
[1:04:29] philippians
[1:04:31] chapter 2 verse 5.
[1:04:54] let this mind be in you
[1:04:56] which was also in christ jesus
[1:04:59] and we'll just stop there
[1:05:01] let's just put our heads in a word of
[1:05:02] prayer heavenly father we just love you
[1:05:04] so much lord jesus
[1:05:06] lord we're just yearning
[1:05:09] lord we know that
[1:05:11] you've come in word form in this hour
[1:05:13] we understand lord by teaching in
[1:05:16] revelation that you came in the form of
[1:05:17] the son of man to reveal yourself to
[1:05:20] your people
[1:05:21] but lord we're just longing to that time
[1:05:23] when you come and catch your bride away
[1:05:24] lord to forever be with to forever be
[1:05:26] with you lord when we can cast off this
[1:05:28] mortal coil
[1:05:30] lord but until that time lord
[1:05:33] may we just be able to say as our
[1:05:35] brother paul said i've fought a good
[1:05:36] fight
[1:05:37] i've finished the course i've run the
[1:05:39] race lord we've come once again to our
[1:05:40] posts of duty
[1:05:42] lord to serve you
[1:05:43] lord to hear from you
[1:05:45] we just pray oh god that you would
[1:05:47] fulfill your word father when we just
[1:05:49] read lord that your word will prosper in
[1:05:52] the thing where unto you sent it may you
[1:05:54] just be with us this evening lord speak
[1:05:55] to your people lord get us all out of
[1:05:57] the way lord that may we you may speak
[1:05:59] to our hearts lord and may we receive it
[1:06:01] with gladness and with joy we just love
[1:06:04] you lord be with all those that are
[1:06:05] traveling lord we just remember them
[1:06:06] once again those that are also laboring
[1:06:08] in the gospel brother matthew and
[1:06:10] brother david and all those that would
[1:06:12] maybe desire to be here but couldn't
[1:06:13] because they may be traveling or
[1:06:15] something else lord you know the hearts
[1:06:16] of your people and their needs we just
[1:06:17] ask you to meet them right where they
[1:06:19] are lord and as we're here together we
[1:06:20] just pray that you would meet us now in
[1:06:22] this place in the name of the lord jesus
[1:06:23] christ we pray amen
[1:06:26] amen you may be seated
[1:06:30] and we'll just turn to one more
[1:06:31] scripture here as we're seated
[1:06:35] romans chapter eight
[1:06:44] didn't want to leave you standing too
[1:06:45] long
[1:06:46] i feel like we'll just read this one
[1:06:52] and start at 8
[1:06:54] chapter 8 verse 18
[1:06:56] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:06:58] present time are not worthy to be
[1:06:59] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:07:02] revealed in us
[1:07:03] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:07:05] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:07:08] of the sons of god
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:13] how many of you are in expectation
[1:07:17] how many of you know that the lord right
[1:07:18] now is working
[1:07:20] on your heart even at this very moment
[1:07:22] your very attitude towards the word the
[1:07:24] very thoughts that you're thinking
[1:07:26] remember your thoughts even right now
[1:07:27] are speaking louder in heaven than your
[1:07:30] actions
[1:07:31] you may raise your hands and scream and
[1:07:33] shout at the top of your lungs and those
[1:07:34] things are great we appreciate it but if
[1:07:36] it doesn't come from a heart that's
[1:07:38] surrendered to god said i just be a
[1:07:40] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol
[1:07:42] though i could know all mysteries and
[1:07:43] have not charity what is charity it is
[1:07:45] the holy ghost
[1:07:47] any of us who are here on wednesday and
[1:07:49] certainly enjoyed the the message that
[1:07:51] our pastor spoke unto us talked about
[1:07:52] that what how we require
[1:07:55] that love shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:07:57] the holy ghost the only one that can do
[1:07:59] it
[1:08:01] i just want to preach a message this
[1:08:02] evening to give it a title
[1:08:04] if i could just maybe ask a question of
[1:08:06] all of us
[1:08:08] but maybe ask it in a personal way
[1:08:11] what are you expecting
[1:08:14] see the scripture says that the creature
[1:08:16] is an expectation for the manifestation
[1:08:19] of the sons of god so there is
[1:08:21] an expectation for something to happen
[1:08:24] you know expectation is that feeling
[1:08:26] that something is coming something's
[1:08:28] coming around the corner there's
[1:08:29] something just waiting to happen it's
[1:08:31] it's just just maybe around the next
[1:08:33] bend or you know there's such an
[1:08:35] anticipation type of feeling to that of
[1:08:37] we can feel it even in the atmosphere of
[1:08:39] believers how we can see the condition
[1:08:41] of the world around us we can see the
[1:08:43] conditions of sodom we are well aware of
[1:08:46] those conditions i don't think it's
[1:08:47] hidden from any of us to see that that
[1:08:49] evil seducers are waxing worse and worse
[1:08:52] that the natural affection has been lost
[1:08:55] as the scripture said it would we're
[1:08:57] seeing
[1:08:58] modern events that are being made clear
[1:08:59] by prophecy we've we've had a prophet in
[1:09:02] our day prophesy things and no doubt
[1:09:04] they we know they thought he was crazy
[1:09:06] in the day to say oh surely that
[1:09:08] couldn't be but we know a prophet could
[1:09:09] see those seed forms of things oh my how
[1:09:12] we'd say oh the the homosexuality is on
[1:09:14] the rise and the the women would be
[1:09:16] skipped down so much that it was just a
[1:09:18] fig leaf and and they and back in that
[1:09:20] day they were just seeing little seed
[1:09:22] forms of it but that prophet could see
[1:09:24] beyond those things and see exactly the
[1:09:26] age that we're living in now and no
[1:09:28] doubt we are seeing exactly those things
[1:09:30] come to pass
[1:09:33] and it fills us with an expectation
[1:09:35] we have an expectation that we know the
[1:09:38] changing of the bodies around the bend
[1:09:41] we can feel it if i can say it that way
[1:09:44] it's deep down in your soul there's just
[1:09:47] the bridegroom cometh
[1:09:49] go ye out to meet him
[1:09:51] we've heard the cry
[1:09:53] the midnight cry has gone forth
[1:09:56] and what are we doing we're in a we're
[1:09:57] in a time of preparation
[1:10:01] but the real question i i've really and
[1:10:03] i say this because a preacher a minister
[1:10:06] can only minister the things that god is
[1:10:08] working on in their life
[1:10:10] you know and that's what i love about
[1:10:12] the lord he says he chose the
[1:10:13] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:10:15] that are lost because how could a man
[1:10:18] who's i'm living my own life
[1:10:20] going about my own everyday affairs i go
[1:10:22] to work i go home you know my dogs lick
[1:10:25] me on the face when i get home jump up
[1:10:26] and i'm happy i live my little life
[1:10:28] there i eat my food i go to sleep you
[1:10:30] know i i try listen to the word of god
[1:10:32] and you try to read and pray as much as
[1:10:34] you can and those things but my
[1:10:36] experience is not maybe brother andy's
[1:10:38] experience
[1:10:39] my struggles are not necessarily brother
[1:10:41] billy's struggles or brother banks
[1:10:42] struggles or anyone else's and yet god
[1:10:45] would choose to take a man as me a
[1:10:47] finite individual
[1:10:49] in flesh
[1:10:50] sinful flesh
[1:10:53] and yet he would
[1:10:54] take pleasure in clothing himself in
[1:10:57] badger skins as it were
[1:10:59] oh i love the lord for that
[1:11:02] he takes these these old nasty badger
[1:11:04] skins that we gotta wake up with every
[1:11:06] day that stink and and smell and we
[1:11:08] gotta wash and and i i sometimes i'm
[1:11:10] almost i'm almost amazed of how how if
[1:11:13] you actually even look at our own life's
[1:11:15] affairs how this flesh is literally
[1:11:17] embodiment of the law
[1:11:19] how it's all the washing in the
[1:11:22] the trimming and the taking care of
[1:11:23] these little natural laws that we have
[1:11:26] to take care of we have to feed
[1:11:27] ourselves naturally and we have to we
[1:11:28] have to rest naturally and we have to
[1:11:30] wash ourselves and or will stink and all
[1:11:32] these different things that they even
[1:11:34] did in the law
[1:11:36] and because why the the scripture says
[1:11:38] there's a law in our flesh
[1:11:40] that wars against the law
[1:11:42] of the inside man
[1:11:44] that wars against the law of this word
[1:11:47] every single day of our lives
[1:11:50] but there is an expectation
[1:11:52] deep inside the believer who has been
[1:11:54] once quickened to the word of god
[1:11:57] sealed by the holy ghost made alive in
[1:11:59] christ jesus that there is an
[1:12:01] expectation that you can't even put a
[1:12:03] you can't put a natural finger on but it
[1:12:06] waits for the manifestation of the sons
[1:12:08] of god
[1:12:11] but my question is what are we expecting
[1:12:15] because
[1:12:17] i fear that many times our expectations
[1:12:20] have become carnal in nature
[1:12:23] because we can read so much of this
[1:12:25] message we can listen to the words of a
[1:12:27] prophet we can read the words in the
[1:12:29] scripture and it's so easy i believe
[1:12:32] even our our pastor has been taking that
[1:12:34] message it is the rising of the sun and
[1:12:36] he brought out that little phrase how
[1:12:37] they said they'd have their own
[1:12:39] spiritual theories
[1:12:41] their own little ideas and and different
[1:12:43] and what is it it's nothing it's the
[1:12:45] nature of a man to desire to understand
[1:12:47] things
[1:12:48] and even in the spiritual sense it's a
[1:12:50] good thing because the lord desires to
[1:12:53] have under us to have understanding
[1:12:55] but spiritual understanding not
[1:12:57] necessarily a carnal understanding
[1:13:00] and i know that in many of the services
[1:13:02] we've ministered recently i've really
[1:13:03] been hitting this home but it's just
[1:13:06] such impressed upon me because the age
[1:13:08] that we live in see we've been smitten
[1:13:10] out of laodicea
[1:13:12] laodicea was spewed out of his mouth he
[1:13:14] was found on the outside of the door
[1:13:16] tried to get in we've moved past that
[1:13:19] age and yet we're still surrounded by
[1:13:21] that spirit every day
[1:13:24] of of the desires to understand and to
[1:13:26] know and to to have all the answers and
[1:13:29] and it's so easy because we have so much
[1:13:32] now
[1:13:33] we've received so much from god in this
[1:13:36] hour we don't even truly understand the
[1:13:40] scope of it
[1:13:42] i believe paul said he says to
[1:13:43] understand what is the height and the
[1:13:45] depth and the breadth and the width of
[1:13:47] the the love of god that he's got for us
[1:13:49] and and this message came a supernatural
[1:13:52] vindicated word that started to unveil
[1:13:55] these things to us
[1:13:58] seven seals were broken and now we can
[1:14:00] behold god face to face
[1:14:03] the scripture being made a new book
[1:14:06] and it's our desire to understand these
[1:14:09] things and to know
[1:14:10] but what are we
[1:14:13] has our expectation turned to something
[1:14:16] more natural
[1:14:18] more carnal
[1:14:20] or are we truly
[1:14:22] have we received the mind of christ
[1:14:25] to be able to go into whatever move he
[1:14:28] would have according to his word
[1:14:32] because the scripture says
[1:14:34] isaiah we read it in isaiah 55 he says
[1:14:36] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:14:39] and my ways are not your ways
[1:14:42] for as the heavens are above you so are
[1:14:44] my thoughts above your thoughts and my
[1:14:46] ways aren't your ways and so many times
[1:14:49] we wrestle in our lives and this is
[1:14:51] where the devil seems to try to pin us
[1:14:53] down
[1:14:54] because he tries to pin you down in a
[1:14:57] carnal understanding
[1:14:59] of your circumstances of your situation
[1:15:02] when what god desires out of us in this
[1:15:05] hour is a complete surrender
[1:15:08] of our understanding
[1:15:11] of our own wills
[1:15:12] of our own desires
[1:15:14] every little bit of it has to die
[1:15:18] every little bit
[1:15:19] there won't be one speck
[1:15:22] of randall verton's nature
[1:15:24] on that other side
[1:15:26] there won't be because god won't share
[1:15:28] his glory with anybody
[1:15:30] his nature cannot coexist with a carnal
[1:15:34] nature
[1:15:35] it is impossible
[1:15:38] it says that the carnal mind is enmity
[1:15:40] with god
[1:15:41] hatred that same hatred that goes all
[1:15:43] the way back to the garden of eden
[1:15:46] it's the same hatred that exists now
[1:15:48] between the soul
[1:15:50] and this flesh
[1:15:53] and so what i find this i'm just giving
[1:15:55] you i try i've told you this many times
[1:15:57] i try to be transparent about about
[1:15:59] myself
[1:16:00] because i don't have anything to hide
[1:16:03] there's no reason to do it anyway
[1:16:04] because god knows all anyhow now i'm not
[1:16:06] going to come up here and treat it like
[1:16:08] a confessional and confess all of our
[1:16:10] sins but the scripture says confess your
[1:16:12] faults one to another and pray one for
[1:16:13] the other
[1:16:14] you know when so many times if we had
[1:16:16] divine love in our hearts that would be
[1:16:18] happening a lot more and there'd be a
[1:16:20] lot more freedom and liberty in christ
[1:16:22] because we'd find that if we had that
[1:16:24] divine love in our hearts to what does
[1:16:26] he say love covers a thing
[1:16:29] love covers over the thing and i so
[1:16:31] appreciated our pastor talking about the
[1:16:34] the gossip spirit and all the other
[1:16:35] things that go on because i i i was
[1:16:37] listening to a message i'll read some
[1:16:39] quotes in there a little bit the lord
[1:16:40] led it on my heart to listen to that
[1:16:42] message proving his word in 1965 and
[1:16:45] brother branham brings out a quote in
[1:16:46] there about that that just really struck
[1:16:48] me
[1:16:49] but we find that
[1:16:51] i found at least that for so long the
[1:16:54] lord had started to really change my
[1:16:56] expectations
[1:16:58] he started to change even more than it
[1:17:01] ever had been my way of thinking
[1:17:03] and he started to
[1:17:04] to impress upon me things in the
[1:17:06] scripture of how easy it is for people
[1:17:09] that might even mean well
[1:17:12] to get let off by their own
[1:17:14] carnal theologies they're caught they're
[1:17:17] they're scriptural theories
[1:17:19] they're little ideas that move on this
[1:17:21] way in that way and and it strays from
[1:17:24] the simplicity in christ
[1:17:26] so simple that it'll go right over the
[1:17:28] top
[1:17:32] i'll just give you a just give you an
[1:17:33] idea of what i'm talking about you know
[1:17:35] when i first when the lord first
[1:17:36] revealed this message to me going on 20
[1:17:39] years ago
[1:17:40] we would just have these discussions you
[1:17:42] know we talk about oh we're going to see
[1:17:43] you know brother brahm talks about
[1:17:45] missing limbs will be restored and and
[1:17:46] these things are going to and i believe
[1:17:48] every bit of that
[1:17:50] but see my carnal mind
[1:17:52] starts going off and thinking i remember
[1:17:54] singing that song i'll run through a
[1:17:56] tube i'll leap over a wall and i'm
[1:17:58] starting to think what happens i feel
[1:18:00] like maybe we've almost gotten into a
[1:18:01] way without even noticing it that that
[1:18:04] pentecostalistic i grew up in
[1:18:06] pentecostalism so i know how the thought
[1:18:08] processes are it tur it literally turns
[1:18:11] into a hollywood affair because that's
[1:18:13] what they turned into it's all theatrics
[1:18:16] and what does it do it starts to turn
[1:18:17] the things of god into a carnal
[1:18:19] impersonation that our prophet warned us
[1:18:22] about
[1:18:23] and so what did my mind do and even
[1:18:25] until even until just recently
[1:18:28] maybe i didn't fully necessarily believe
[1:18:30] this but my mind would start to you
[1:18:31] start your imagination start to take
[1:18:33] over and you're just imagining running
[1:18:35] through walls and and and just jumping
[1:18:38] over literally doing those things
[1:18:40] but i still the lord started to bring
[1:18:42] scriptures to my mind and i started to
[1:18:44] think about isaiah chapter 40.
[1:18:47] and it says he says let's turn to isaiah
[1:18:50] chapter 40.
[1:18:52] let's turn to isaiah chapter 40. and
[1:18:54] i'll show you what we're talking about
[1:18:56] with man's ideas
[1:18:57] in our ability
[1:18:59] to take the things of god
[1:19:02] and come out it's like a game of
[1:19:03] telephone you ever play the game of
[1:19:05] telephone where you get around in a big
[1:19:07] circle and one person starts with the
[1:19:08] phrase and by the time you get to the
[1:19:10] end you see if the phrase matches up
[1:19:13] and it's completely different from what
[1:19:14] you started out with
[1:19:16] that's what happens when man
[1:19:18] tries to deliver their own ideas
[1:19:22] because it starts out god delivers an
[1:19:24] idea to to to man through a prophet
[1:19:26] through his word
[1:19:28] and then by the twisting of man's ideas
[1:19:31] that's why brother branham and the the
[1:19:33] the lord hates denominations so much
[1:19:36] because it takes the things the pure
[1:19:38] things of god and it cankers it and it
[1:19:41] twists it and it contorts it and
[1:19:43] perverts it until it comes out looking
[1:19:45] like a catholic church that has nothing
[1:19:48] to do with the things of god
[1:19:50] and our prophet would call the greatest
[1:19:51] form of spiritualism that there is
[1:19:53] literal devil worship
[1:19:55] and the people don't know it
[1:19:58] and it will it is the mark of the beast
[1:20:00] to join up with such and yet they would
[1:20:02] believe that they're doing god a service
[1:20:06] by following that and will absolutely
[1:20:09] look you square in the eye and tell you
[1:20:11] that you're going to hell that that i
[1:20:13] could kill you if you don't convert to
[1:20:15] our beliefs and they're going to do it
[1:20:17] and are doing it now
[1:20:21] and it started he said he did run well
[1:20:26] that's why brother branham could say
[1:20:27] honestly and i don't think he was just
[1:20:29] joking he said i'm an original catholic
[1:20:32] i'm one that believed the word of god as
[1:20:34] the day of pentecost
[1:20:35] repented me baptized in the name of
[1:20:37] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:20:39] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:20:40] holy ghost
[1:20:42] not the ugly perversion that came later
[1:20:44] on but remember that nicholated spirit
[1:20:47] is not dead
[1:20:50] and it's not dead in the message
[1:20:52] and i'm not talking about the actual
[1:20:54] message because we know the message the
[1:20:57] word of god
[1:20:58] we call it the message but it is the
[1:21:00] word of god it is jesus christ revealed
[1:21:05] it is jesus christ revealed in this hour
[1:21:09] we call we give it a title just another
[1:21:12] title the message but when i say the
[1:21:14] message i mean the umbrella of it
[1:21:17] those that would be hangers on and those
[1:21:19] that would say well i believe the
[1:21:20] prophet if you believe the prophet you'd
[1:21:22] put nothing before jesus christ
[1:21:25] you'd put nothing before the word of god
[1:21:31] it's just the truth
[1:21:32] because the spirit of nicolaitanism
[1:21:35] that spirit that would com remember what
[1:21:36] liquor latinism is conquer the laity
[1:21:40] that's conquering the church remember
[1:21:42] it's got to go back to being so subtle
[1:21:44] because remember it started out as just
[1:21:46] the deeds of the nicolaitans just a
[1:21:49] little bit those little foxes that
[1:21:50] spoiled the vine and paul would say even
[1:21:53] before he left the scene he spent the
[1:21:55] spirit of antichrist which now worketh
[1:21:59] not which will but which not worketh in
[1:22:01] the children of disobedience
[1:22:04] that's why as we heard our brother talk
[1:22:05] about this morning about how we've got
[1:22:08] to come to a place where the holy ghost
[1:22:10] is so apparent in the church it's so
[1:22:12] apparent in our lives not just our lives
[1:22:15] but in the body that sin can get called
[1:22:18] out at the door
[1:22:19] that we can see the two spirits in the
[1:22:21] framework of the church why because he
[1:22:23] said in the church facebook that is what
[1:22:25] would make us become an invincible army
[1:22:28] he said if we can recognize the spirit
[1:22:30] in what and by god's spirit withstand
[1:22:33] that spirit
[1:22:37] i believe in our lives many times we
[1:22:39] recognize
[1:22:41] but we don't always withstand
[1:22:43] because we get tired we get weary be not
[1:22:46] weary in well-doing it's hard why the
[1:22:48] scripture says the scripture says that
[1:22:50] the devil would wear out the saints
[1:22:52] wear them out if there's not a day of
[1:22:55] wearing out i don't know what other day
[1:22:57] it could be
[1:22:58] from the time you wake up we were
[1:23:00] talking about it in the back brother
[1:23:01] billy how from the time you wake up to
[1:23:03] the time you go to bed name a time or a
[1:23:06] place or a season or an era that has
[1:23:09] ever surrounded people with filth as
[1:23:12] this day
[1:23:14] no matter where you go your cell phone's
[1:23:16] throwing ads at you the tvs you may not
[1:23:18] even own a tv but if you go into a store
[1:23:21] the tvs are screaming at you they got 50
[1:23:23] of them on the wall
[1:23:25] everywhere you go evil music is playing
[1:23:27] everywhere you go evil is being spoke of
[1:23:30] people are dressing immorally people are
[1:23:32] acting immorally people just look evil
[1:23:37] when has it ever been just that from the
[1:23:39] time you wake up oppressive demonic
[1:23:42] forces are on top of you
[1:23:47] and we're going to get to that in a
[1:23:48] second
[1:23:49] isaiah chapter 40.
[1:23:53] isaiah chapter 40
[1:23:55] starting at verse 3
[1:23:56] he says the voice of him that crieth in
[1:23:59] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:24:01] lord make straight in the desert a
[1:24:03] highway for our god
[1:24:05] every valley shall be exalted every
[1:24:07] mountain and hell shall be made low and
[1:24:09] the crooked shall be made straight and
[1:24:11] the rough place is made plain and the
[1:24:13] glory of the lord shall be revealed and
[1:24:15] all flesh shall see it together for the
[1:24:18] mouth of the lord had spoken it that
[1:24:19] sounds like a great event
[1:24:22] who would have thought that that would
[1:24:23] have been a scrubby scruffy gross
[1:24:26] looking man wandered out of the
[1:24:28] wilderness stop at his feet clothed with
[1:24:30] skins eating locust and wild honey
[1:24:33] pointing his finger in the face of the
[1:24:34] leader of the time and said it's not
[1:24:36] lawful for you to have her
[1:24:39] see carnal minds would think what
[1:24:41] brother branagh taught oh he's going to
[1:24:43] come down from heaven he's going to make
[1:24:45] himself known to a priest and say i'm
[1:24:47] here to announce the messiah
[1:24:52] when you read that where does your
[1:24:54] carnal mind go every valley shall be
[1:24:57] exalted
[1:24:58] think the carnal mind where that takes
[1:25:00] that
[1:25:02] every mountain and hill shall be made
[1:25:04] low
[1:25:05] i mean i'm thinking seismic activity
[1:25:09] it was on a spiritual level
[1:25:11] we're talking spiritual shaking brothers
[1:25:13] and sisters
[1:25:15] he said this time i shake not earth only
[1:25:17] but the heavens
[1:25:19] oh my see if we could get in his mind
[1:25:22] if we could pick up that channel
[1:25:24] you won't miss it then
[1:25:26] but if you're busy thinking carnally
[1:25:28] you're going to be just like those
[1:25:28] pharisees oh but i thought every hill
[1:25:31] would be would be made low yeah you were
[1:25:33] the hill and you're getting made low
[1:25:35] right now
[1:25:36] glory to god
[1:25:39] praise the lord humble yourself and you
[1:25:41] shall be exalted
[1:25:43] in due time
[1:25:45] that's always the time element that gets
[1:25:46] us brothers and sisters it's easy to
[1:25:48] take it if it's right now
[1:25:51] but when i was a child i thought as a
[1:25:52] child i speak as a child i acted as a
[1:25:54] child what is a child i don't have
[1:25:56] children yet but they're coming i'm
[1:25:58] standing on the promises of god they're
[1:26:00] coming
[1:26:00] but what was it what was the child what
[1:26:02] does a child do i know because i was one
[1:26:04] and i get to see him i have eyes to see
[1:26:06] and ears to hear
[1:26:07] what do they do oh i want this mama goes
[1:26:10] bottle right when they're a baby you're
[1:26:11] a baby
[1:26:12] oh i want this and if you don't get it
[1:26:16] you're a baby
[1:26:17] lord i really need this in my life
[1:26:20] ten seconds later lord you've forsaken
[1:26:22] me
[1:26:23] you're a baby still
[1:26:26] you're thinking as a child
[1:26:28] i and i made this point i was up in ohio
[1:26:30] last weekend ministering and i made this
[1:26:32] point i said i and i and this at least
[1:26:34] this is true for me i don't know if it's
[1:26:35] true for everybody but i remember when
[1:26:36] the lord
[1:26:38] saved me filled me with the holy ghost
[1:26:39] and i'm babe in christ and everything's
[1:26:41] fresh and new it just felt like i was
[1:26:43] just floating
[1:26:45] maybe like six months a year maybe maybe
[1:26:47] even longer for some of you you're just
[1:26:49] floating it's like everywhere you look
[1:26:50] it's like lord can i have this and boom
[1:26:51] it's there lord could you do this for me
[1:26:54] boo if it's there what's he doing he's
[1:26:55] he's babying you because you're a baby
[1:26:58] you're a babe you need that you need
[1:27:01] that thing oh lord help me i need that
[1:27:03] he just he comes down and comforts you
[1:27:04] his presence is right there but then
[1:27:05] when you became a man it's time to put
[1:27:07] away childish things brothers and
[1:27:09] sisters the lord lord you say lord
[1:27:12] i need this out of my life and the lord
[1:27:14] says
[1:27:15] pick up your sword and go to work what
[1:27:17] are you waiting on me for why christ
[1:27:19] thou and to me speak
[1:27:21] and go forward
[1:27:23] and we're we are maturing brothers and
[1:27:25] sisters some of you may in here baby
[1:27:27] babe still and that's fine but we ain't
[1:27:29] raising hot house plants those little
[1:27:32] sprays and those those wonderful people
[1:27:34] to come around and get all the bugs off
[1:27:36] you ain't going to be there forever
[1:27:37] because you're going to be put to the
[1:27:38] test god wants to see if you're going to
[1:27:40] be a faithful child he wants to see if
[1:27:42] he can put the keys of the kingdom in
[1:27:44] your hands and that you sign your name
[1:27:46] on the check but he can't do it if you
[1:27:49] don't have the character that he
[1:27:50] requires
[1:27:51] he's looking for soldiers he's looking
[1:27:54] for ones that can endure hardness
[1:27:57] it says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:27:59] flood the spirit of god will raise up a
[1:28:00] standard it didn't say if the enemy
[1:28:02] comes in it said when the enemy comes in
[1:28:04] like a flood and he's coming
[1:28:07] every single day those waves are beaten
[1:28:09] against you like the ocean on the
[1:28:11] seashore trying to erode your faith
[1:28:13] every single day that you wake up
[1:28:18] 200 000 000 demons in this hour
[1:28:22] and to deluvian devils
[1:28:24] those are pre-flood for those of you
[1:28:26] that don't know the fancy language stuff
[1:28:29] and i barely know it either
[1:28:31] pre-flood devils those are the devils
[1:28:33] that as it was in the days of noah
[1:28:36] and they have been released in this hour
[1:28:40] and they are got their sights trained on
[1:28:41] you brothers and sisters
[1:28:44] so i want you to think about what are
[1:28:45] you expecting
[1:28:47] see we say well i'm going to run through
[1:28:49] a troop i leap over a wall you know
[1:28:50] you're doing it right now every day you
[1:28:52] serve jesus christ in this hour
[1:28:54] you don't even realize at the time you
[1:28:56] wake up and you settle in your heart
[1:28:58] because that holy ghost is beating jesus
[1:29:01] jesus jesus jesus jesus every single
[1:29:05] morning you wake up and it's the first
[1:29:06] thing on your mind say lord help me help
[1:29:08] me serve you today do you have any idea
[1:29:11] how valuable that is do you have any
[1:29:13] idea that as soon as you wake up oh yeah
[1:29:14] you're running through a troop all right
[1:29:16] there's a troop of devil standing
[1:29:17] outside your door right next to your bed
[1:29:19] for you to run through from the time you
[1:29:21] wake up to the time you go to bed there
[1:29:24] are walls set up all around you to try
[1:29:27] to block you i'm talking spiritual walls
[1:29:29] we got to get out of the carnal mind
[1:29:34] the world's all caught up and they're
[1:29:36] all superheroes and super this and super
[1:29:38] that
[1:29:39] see but we've gone beyond the natural
[1:29:43] that's why the world will miss it all
[1:29:46] he said that'll be the third poll he
[1:29:47] said and you won't tell anybody about it
[1:29:49] he said it won't be an open show
[1:29:52] it won't be an open show
[1:29:54] and we've got these visions i know i did
[1:29:56] for the longest time i had these visions
[1:29:58] of just running around and people trying
[1:30:00] to kill me and but i can run right
[1:30:02] through a wall because my body change is
[1:30:04] coming and you know i believe those
[1:30:05] things will happen too
[1:30:07] because it's scriptural jesus the
[1:30:08] scripture says jesus walked right
[1:30:10] through the crowd that was trying to
[1:30:11] kill him and they couldn't even find him
[1:30:12] you tell me that's not supernatural
[1:30:15] scripture says he walked right through
[1:30:16] the wall and he was in the
[1:30:18] supernatural room
[1:30:19] believe in those things but we don't
[1:30:21] just settle on carnal things we're
[1:30:23] looking for spiritual victories we're
[1:30:25] looking for a spiritual uplifting to
[1:30:28] because i don't care whether what the
[1:30:30] devil has tried to tell you but this
[1:30:32] flesh will never be converted
[1:30:36] it must be cast off at the body change
[1:30:39] that's the type we have the tabernacle
[1:30:41] in the wilderness that ark of god the
[1:30:44] shekinah glory the holy ghost dwelt in
[1:30:47] tabernacles or badger skins
[1:30:49] that is us right now the holy ghost in
[1:30:51] you dwelling in badger skin
[1:30:54] it's nasty it's wicked it's evil it's
[1:30:57] it's angry ever seen a badger they're
[1:30:59] not happy animals
[1:31:01] they got attitudes
[1:31:03] they like to fight
[1:31:04] they're wicked mean little things that
[1:31:07] is what you are clothed in
[1:31:09] that is what god chose to dwell in right
[1:31:11] now and what are we doing because we're
[1:31:13] pilgrims and strangers just like israel
[1:31:15] was all that time and we've entered into
[1:31:18] the promised land now and that
[1:31:19] tabernacle is still going on but we're
[1:31:21] fighting the enemy we're possessing the
[1:31:23] gates of the enemy we're taking it step
[1:31:25] by step because footsteps our possession
[1:31:28] we're putting our foot on the neck of
[1:31:30] the enemy and we're taking it over
[1:31:31] little by little
[1:31:33] and one of these days just like the
[1:31:35] natural son of david solomon had said he
[1:31:38] had rest round about him so what could
[1:31:40] he do he could build a temple unto his
[1:31:43] god and what did they say each of those
[1:31:45] stones were hewn in the place where they
[1:31:47] were found and when they came together
[1:31:49] there wasn't a sound of the tool in the
[1:31:52] building of the temple so shall it be at
[1:31:54] the coming of the lord when this bride
[1:31:56] comes together in the twinkling of an
[1:31:59] eye it'll come together the temple of
[1:32:01] god the body of god will come together
[1:32:03] into an instant
[1:32:05] without the sound of a tool
[1:32:07] like a thief in the night
[1:32:10] it'll poof it'll be put together and you
[1:32:11] won't even know it the world won't know
[1:32:13] nothing about it
[1:32:14] but you know what's going to happen then
[1:32:15] just like solomon
[1:32:16] like our son of david we're going to
[1:32:18] have rest on every side glory to god
[1:32:20] we're going to be sitting at the wedding
[1:32:22] the wedding supper ready for a thousand
[1:32:24] year honeymoon with him
[1:32:27] but what are you expecting
[1:32:29] i'm not expecting a better ease on this
[1:32:32] side
[1:32:33] we got to draw the sword
[1:32:34] our brother mentioned it this morning
[1:32:36] we've got to die more to ourselves
[1:32:39] that death to self is where we're at in
[1:32:42] this hour because it was the last thing
[1:32:44] that has to be conquered it's the last
[1:32:46] thing that christ conquered in
[1:32:47] gethsemane he had to die to his own
[1:32:49] desires he had lord i would that this
[1:32:52] cup passed from me you know brother
[1:32:53] branham said that the spirit of god left
[1:32:55] him in the garden and he was left there
[1:32:57] a man
[1:32:58] when he conquered his own will as a man
[1:33:00] you know what else he did he conquered
[1:33:02] my will he conquered your will he
[1:33:04] conquered all your desires but here's
[1:33:06] the thing we've got to be honest with
[1:33:08] ourselves and say lord there are things
[1:33:11] in me
[1:33:12] that i know are still there that i don't
[1:33:14] want to be there
[1:33:16] call them out
[1:33:17] shine the light of the word of that
[1:33:19] devil
[1:33:20] oh he's a slippery little cockroach that
[1:33:22] devil they know that as soon as the
[1:33:24] preacher comes and sheds that gospel
[1:33:26] light out of he tries to skin her away
[1:33:29] and he'll skin her away for a season
[1:33:30] maybe in the service you'll feel oh lord
[1:33:32] i'm free but he's still out there
[1:33:34] lurking somewhere there's a little
[1:33:35] desire that's why was it i can't
[1:33:37] remember the names you forgive me for
[1:33:38] not knowing all the stories verbatim but
[1:33:40] i remember remember the sister that was
[1:33:42] kind of crazy or she thought she was
[1:33:44] crazy and brother brandon said let's
[1:33:46] pray prayed with her and she said oh i
[1:33:48] feel a little bit better and brother and
[1:33:49] say no that's not it yet that's not it
[1:33:51] we got to go a little deeper we got to
[1:33:53] dig a little deeper this had prayed with
[1:33:55] her again oh i feel okay no no but then
[1:33:57] she got down and she started praying
[1:33:59] she said there's there's a soul travail
[1:34:02] there is a crying out from someplace
[1:34:05] that's deeper than your mind there's a
[1:34:07] crying out then someplace deeper from
[1:34:10] the superficial flesh that says well if
[1:34:12] i can because you don't understand it
[1:34:14] you may not completely understand it
[1:34:16] naturally i don't either but there are
[1:34:18] two different people
[1:34:19] that are with you right now
[1:34:22] there is one on the inside of the inside
[1:34:24] the seed of god that has been quickened
[1:34:26] by this gospel that there's no matter
[1:34:29] what you say lord my only heart's desire
[1:34:32] is to fulfill your word perfectly
[1:34:35] every bit of that inside man is desiring
[1:34:38] to because it can't do it it is the word
[1:34:40] of god and the word of god can only
[1:34:42] fulfill the word of god its desire is to
[1:34:44] do that but yet there's another man
[1:34:47] this man
[1:34:48] he happens to be physically larger than
[1:34:51] the little that we call the little
[1:34:52] inside man that's here but spiritually
[1:34:55] speaking brother if you could what was
[1:34:56] the what was the parable even brother
[1:34:58] branham allowed the native american man
[1:34:59] to share with us
[1:35:01] he said i find i have two dogs fighting
[1:35:03] within me
[1:35:04] he says i have a white dog and a black
[1:35:06] dog he said which one wins said the one
[1:35:08] i feed the most
[1:35:10] when the reason we're not winning is
[1:35:12] because we're not feeding
[1:35:13] the reason we're not winning is because
[1:35:14] we're not feeding he said as the word
[1:35:17] goes for as the water comes down from
[1:35:19] heaven water at the ground so will my
[1:35:22] word be that goes forth so you have to
[1:35:24] stay under that word you've got to stay
[1:35:26] under it you know the lord and forgive
[1:35:28] me if this seems for many of you this
[1:35:30] may be a revelation you received a long
[1:35:32] time ago
[1:35:33] well this just happened to me and i
[1:35:35] praised the lord for it in the last week
[1:35:36] i said lord you know the scripture says
[1:35:38] that every man's given a measure of
[1:35:40] faith and i say lord
[1:35:42] i feel like my measure of faith is so
[1:35:44] small
[1:35:45] though how many of you ever felt like
[1:35:47] that lord why does it always feel like
[1:35:49] my measure of faith is smaller than
[1:35:51] everybody else's it's what the devil
[1:35:52] does he's there to whisper i'm just i'm
[1:35:54] just calling him out i don't i'm not
[1:35:56] scared of the devil
[1:35:58] we've got to call them out because we
[1:35:59] fight these things we're
[1:36:01] we're mortals
[1:36:03] and yet we're immortal
[1:36:06] we are eternal
[1:36:07] clothed by finite flesh and so there's
[1:36:11] that that they call it i think in
[1:36:12] science they what do they call it like
[1:36:14] uh uh uh
[1:36:16] it's a dichotomy or whatever they call
[1:36:17] it there it's a it's a cognitive
[1:36:19] dissonance
[1:36:20] where
[1:36:21] where there's two separate ideas that
[1:36:23] are warring at the same time in the same
[1:36:25] space
[1:36:26] you know you say lord i know that i've
[1:36:28] been called i know that you've chosen me
[1:36:31] and yet i see this thing happening over
[1:36:33] and over and over again but you've got
[1:36:35] to water that seed i said lord why does
[1:36:37] it always seem like i had the smallest
[1:36:39] faith
[1:36:41] and then the lord just quickened
[1:36:42] something to me recently and forgive me
[1:36:43] if it seems like this is elementary to
[1:36:45] you but the depth of it went so far
[1:36:47] deeper than i had ever heard the lord
[1:36:49] just spoke to me and said but faith
[1:36:50] cometh by hearing
[1:36:52] and hearing the word of god
[1:36:54] so if you need faith
[1:36:56] then all then you need to hear
[1:37:00] how have you
[1:37:01] do you lack faith do you feel like you
[1:37:02] lack faith then let's do some more
[1:37:04] hearing
[1:37:05] because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:37:07] hearing the word of god
[1:37:09] so if you find your lacking faith well
[1:37:11] maybe you need to hear a little bit more
[1:37:13] maybe you need to surround yourself
[1:37:15] saturate yourself with it just like the
[1:37:17] old testament said they bounded his
[1:37:18] front lit with their eyes put it upon
[1:37:20] their wrists upon their garments they
[1:37:21] wrote it on their doors and their posts
[1:37:23] and everywhere everywhere you look
[1:37:24] should be jesus everywhere you look
[1:37:26] should be word this word here word there
[1:37:29] you say i don't care you know what i
[1:37:31] don't care if you got to put it on while
[1:37:32] you're sleeping together subliminally
[1:37:35] saturate yourself with this word
[1:37:37] you say oh brother you're talking works
[1:37:39] yes i'm talking works because he said
[1:37:41] you show me you're faithful that works
[1:37:43] i'll show you my faith by my works
[1:37:45] i don't work to get to the kingdom of
[1:37:47] heaven jesus christ did that for me
[1:37:49] already but i'm working so that i can
[1:37:51] fulfill the part he's got for me
[1:37:54] he didn't call us to sit on the
[1:37:56] sidelines he didn't call you just to sit
[1:37:58] there as a lump on the lawn
[1:38:00] you've got work to do that only you can
[1:38:02] fulfill
[1:38:04] that's that nicholaten spirit again
[1:38:06] brother brother billy just hit on it a
[1:38:08] little bit this morning it's not on the
[1:38:10] preacher
[1:38:12] i'd say that's actually the littlest
[1:38:14] part of it how can a man preach except
[1:38:17] there'd be someone to preach to
[1:38:20] if there's no pull for the word
[1:38:22] if there's no need
[1:38:24] see if god will supply your needs not
[1:38:25] your wants
[1:38:29] he promised to supply every need
[1:38:31] so many times we get the two confused
[1:38:33] my i want my i need my wants
[1:38:36] well no you don't
[1:38:39] we we run into that a lot what is that
[1:38:41] that's that old child nature trying to
[1:38:42] take over now we need to have faith as
[1:38:45] children but we have need to have
[1:38:47] maturity as soldiers
[1:38:49] that could just pull out the sword and
[1:38:51] go to fighting but think about that
[1:38:53] carnal mind and how it how it twists the
[1:38:55] things of god to come up with something
[1:38:57] totally different to the point to where
[1:38:59] john the baptist came pharisees
[1:39:01] sadducees the most learned men i know
[1:39:03] i've mentioned this before but they said
[1:39:04] history says they could rule the scrolls
[1:39:06] put a pin in there and tell you what
[1:39:08] letter it hit
[1:39:09] that's how well they knew their scrolls
[1:39:12] they could they could quote
[1:39:14] the entire old testament and you think
[1:39:16] about the old testament
[1:39:18] this is kind of a example here but old
[1:39:20] testament verse new testament that's all
[1:39:23] the old testament they could recite it
[1:39:24] verbatim
[1:39:26] they were so good it shows it's not
[1:39:28] about knowledge
[1:39:29] because they knew the word
[1:39:32] but they didn't know the word
[1:39:36] you understand what i'm saying they knew
[1:39:38] the word
[1:39:39] but they didn't know the word
[1:39:42] and you have to know him just like what
[1:39:44] did we hear this morning i have so
[1:39:45] appreciated because brother billy
[1:39:47] started hitting on a couple of those
[1:39:48] little things five minutes in the
[1:39:50] presence of god
[1:39:52] and it made obsolete 80 years of moses's
[1:39:55] learning in five minutes
[1:39:57] and not only that not only did it make
[1:39:58] it obsolete but it superseded it to the
[1:40:01] point where everything he had desired
[1:40:02] see moses had gotten caught in that same
[1:40:05] thing what was moses expecting see his
[1:40:07] expectation
[1:40:09] the end goal was the right goal
[1:40:11] he's been called to be a deliverer he
[1:40:13] had an expectation
[1:40:14] but what what was the what was the
[1:40:16] problem his carnal interpretation of
[1:40:19] that expectation
[1:40:21] caused him to get him nothing but a dead
[1:40:22] egyptian a bunch of shame and fleeing
[1:40:25] from the presence of god
[1:40:27] how many of you have been there the lord
[1:40:29] puts it on your heart i've got something
[1:40:31] for you
[1:40:32] and because the scripture says where to
[1:40:33] say whether it be ministering weight on
[1:40:35] your ministry
[1:40:37] wait for the lord to give you the
[1:40:38] unction for the move don't try to come
[1:40:40] up with it on your own wait for him to
[1:40:43] put it and open the door for you to do
[1:40:45] it and give you the right place to do it
[1:40:46] and the right motive and the right
[1:40:47] objective in the right season remember
[1:40:49] all these things had to line up our
[1:40:51] prophet put it into place for us it's
[1:40:53] not just a david oh nate nathan said do
[1:40:56] whatever's in your heart david and the
[1:40:58] lord had to come and correct that
[1:40:59] prophet
[1:41:00] if he had to correct a prophet how much
[1:41:02] for us who've just received the word of
[1:41:05] a prophet and here we are trying to
[1:41:06] interpret what he said
[1:41:09] we try to interpret what brother branham
[1:41:11] said
[1:41:12] we try to take what he said and dissect
[1:41:13] it
[1:41:14] and come up with carnal expectations for
[1:41:16] it like i said about tent ministries and
[1:41:18] all these different little doctrines
[1:41:20] that come out of it and all these other
[1:41:21] things that people try to come up with i
[1:41:24] don't want to know anything else but
[1:41:25] christ and him crucified
[1:41:28] because i know if i try to put my own
[1:41:30] see god will interpret it when he brings
[1:41:32] it to pass
[1:41:34] and as long as i and i'm just speaking
[1:41:36] personally but apply it to yourself as
[1:41:38] long as we are in the right channel
[1:41:41] and in in the holy ghost in the right
[1:41:44] spirit to receive at the time
[1:41:46] then we'll go right along with it when
[1:41:48] he comes
[1:41:49] but if we're all off over here working
[1:41:51] on our own ideas in our own
[1:41:53] interpretations and the lord's working
[1:41:55] over there
[1:41:57] how many people read that scripture
[1:42:00] isaiah chapter 40.
[1:42:03] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:42:04] make straight
[1:42:05] the path of the lord make a highway for
[1:42:07] our god knew that that was talking about
[1:42:09] the coming messiah and yet
[1:42:11] completely missed the fulfillment of
[1:42:13] that scripture
[1:42:15] you know jesus was on the scene
[1:42:18] the very god of heaven the messiah
[1:42:19] himself the fulfillment of all scripture
[1:42:23] the fulfillment of all of that the very
[1:42:25] word himself
[1:42:27] and not only
[1:42:29] did hardly anybody know he was there
[1:42:31] an even tinier percentage could actually
[1:42:33] believe it
[1:42:37] and even
[1:42:38] think about this
[1:42:39] think about where we're at because
[1:42:41] if we be in that type
[1:42:43] of receiving a messenger before the
[1:42:45] coming of the lord
[1:42:47] how many received the messenger
[1:42:50] but failed to go on with jesus
[1:42:52] and didn't even know
[1:42:54] well what about when they found
[1:42:55] disciples of john
[1:42:57] we not even heard about a holy ghost
[1:43:00] well what baptized baptism were you
[1:43:02] baptized with the baptism of john
[1:43:04] so if that be the case how privileged
[1:43:06] are we and where are we to be to say
[1:43:09] lord give us your mind
[1:43:11] lord give us your heart to receive what
[1:43:12] you've got for us let us not get off to
[1:43:15] this side or that i said but just remain
[1:43:16] steady right in the middle of the road
[1:43:19] right down the center
[1:43:20] lord i'm not gonna i'm not gonna just
[1:43:22] join in with this or join with that i'm
[1:43:24] going to stick with that word i'm going
[1:43:25] to stick with what we've received in
[1:43:26] this hour i'm not going to try to
[1:43:28] interpret it because i don't know
[1:43:29] anything anyway
[1:43:32] but lord you reveal it to me as i have
[1:43:34] need of it and i will receive
[1:43:35] and lord give me grace that when you do
[1:43:37] reveal it i can just jump right in with
[1:43:39] both feet and say lord be unto me
[1:43:41] according to thy word
[1:43:43] but how easy is it to get off that path
[1:43:48] it's very easy
[1:43:51] i got a couple quotes just to quote here
[1:43:53] and in proving his word
[1:43:56] see it's just about see god didn't call
[1:43:58] us
[1:43:59] to bring the word to pass he just want
[1:44:01] us to believe it
[1:44:04] because i don't have the power to bring
[1:44:05] it past anyway
[1:44:07] i want all this work to come to pass and
[1:44:09] i know it will
[1:44:10] if if my own natural desires i'd be out
[1:44:13] of this body right now
[1:44:15] i'd be bringing thessalonians to pass
[1:44:17] right now
[1:44:18] how many would say amen to that
[1:44:20] let's get out of this body
[1:44:22] but see it's not time yet the season's
[1:44:25] not here it's not up to me it's up to me
[1:44:27] to believe it and be in the spiritual
[1:44:30] condition that when he comes to fulfill
[1:44:32] it i can receive it
[1:44:34] that when he comes and says come up
[1:44:36] hither
[1:44:37] i'm i'm hearing the voice
[1:44:39] i'm not just listening to the to the to
[1:44:41] the whirlwind i'm not just listening to
[1:44:43] this but i can hear the still smallest
[1:44:44] voices come up here
[1:44:46] but he says in proving proving his word
[1:44:49] he says
[1:44:50] also we'll take another just for just a
[1:44:52] moment abraham was another prophet of
[1:44:54] the lord that the word came to
[1:44:56] and told him when he was 75 years old
[1:44:59] and sarah 65 years old that he was going
[1:45:00] to have a child by sarah
[1:45:02] now that was quite a shock to an
[1:45:04] unbeliever could you imagine today such
[1:45:07] a thing happening even in this day with
[1:45:09] all of our scientific achievements and
[1:45:11] all these test tube babies they talk
[1:45:12] about and so forth
[1:45:14] but this old woman now of 65 years old
[1:45:17] and an old man of 75 years old but the
[1:45:19] word of the lord came to abraham and
[1:45:20] told him that this was going to happen
[1:45:22] and abraham believed god
[1:45:24] now no matter how much god spoke and how
[1:45:27] true it was
[1:45:28] abraham had to believe what god said to
[1:45:31] make it so
[1:45:33] now look how that man was tested with
[1:45:35] his testimony that he did believe so you
[1:45:38] say you believe
[1:45:39] we'll be ready to put to the test
[1:45:41] be ready god's going to try you he's
[1:45:44] going to try what did he say about
[1:45:45] israel he said i put them in the
[1:45:46] wilderness to try your hearts
[1:45:48] to show and it wasn't see god already
[1:45:50] knows
[1:45:52] he knew what was in them
[1:45:53] god knows all we act as if that that
[1:45:57] like brother billy said it perfectly
[1:45:58] this morning so many times we do when he
[1:46:00] was reading some of the quotes of
[1:46:01] brother branham he said we'd act certain
[1:46:03] ways because we don't really believe
[1:46:04] that he's there with us
[1:46:08] certain times when we think oh well
[1:46:09] we'll just do this it's because we're
[1:46:11] not what do you say he said it's the
[1:46:12] presence of god that's going
[1:46:14] unrecognized
[1:46:16] and if we recognize that everywhere we
[1:46:17] go he's with us
[1:46:20] you got the holy ghost he's with you
[1:46:24] he is with you whithersoever thou goest
[1:46:27] but are we aware of his presence are we
[1:46:29] cognizant of his presence
[1:46:32] or is it just okay well we'll do
[1:46:33] whatever
[1:46:34] but you have to believe that
[1:46:36] he says now look how that man was tested
[1:46:38] with his testimony that he did believe
[1:46:40] that same man that made that confession
[1:46:42] that he believed god he's a person like
[1:46:44] you are sitting here tonight
[1:46:46] we still believe god
[1:46:48] we got to believe his word is the truth
[1:46:50] and he'll prove it
[1:46:52] that it's the truth if we'll just
[1:46:54] believe it now how simple is that
[1:46:58] so simple you say i just take things
[1:47:01] like healing we have people that need
[1:47:02] healing
[1:47:03] in our midst we have people that are in
[1:47:06] desperate need of healing
[1:47:08] he's already healed you
[1:47:10] do you believe it you say amen then you
[1:47:13] stand still and you confess that until
[1:47:16] he brings it to pass because he will
[1:47:19] prove it to be true
[1:47:21] because it's his word his word said so
[1:47:24] it's not a question of anything else you
[1:47:26] say well i have this and that in my life
[1:47:28] and i've i fell here and i sit here put
[1:47:30] it beneath the blood
[1:47:31] cast into the sea of forgetfulness make
[1:47:34] it right and move forward with god
[1:47:36] that's as simple as it is brothers and
[1:47:38] sisters
[1:47:39] but then we put god on a timeline and
[1:47:41] say well lord it didn't happen yet
[1:47:43] why not
[1:47:44] he's not obligated to tell you that
[1:47:47] he just said it would happen
[1:47:49] didn't say when didn't say how didn't
[1:47:51] say who didn't say where
[1:47:55] well we'd say oh lord
[1:47:57] there's that carnal expectation again oh
[1:47:59] lord i need this healing or i need this
[1:48:01] in my life and you've already planned it
[1:48:02] down in your head how god will perform
[1:48:03] it
[1:48:05] right there you missed it because you're
[1:48:07] off on this path
[1:48:08] and the lord's sitting right over here
[1:48:10] saying i could meet your need over here
[1:48:11] if you just wait on me
[1:48:15] i'll give you a testimony i was over in
[1:48:17] ohio ministering and i was talking to to
[1:48:19] a brother there
[1:48:21] and he witnessed to me how the devil had
[1:48:22] been fighting him and it happened a
[1:48:24] couple times and recently again the
[1:48:27] devil
[1:48:28] had been giving him dizzy spells and he
[1:48:30] kind of he could kind of tell the devil
[1:48:32] was trying to attack him with like a
[1:48:34] diabetes spirit
[1:48:35] he never had a problem in his life never
[1:48:37] had an issue with this at all
[1:48:39] and he said the lord put on his heart he
[1:48:40] said i'm going to give that back box of
[1:48:42] snakes right back to the devil and he
[1:48:43] spoke and he said i'd refuse this and it
[1:48:45] went away
[1:48:46] and then he said recently within the
[1:48:47] last few months he was with a person
[1:48:50] and and he saw that a person that was
[1:48:53] that had that had that
[1:48:55] problem diabetes
[1:48:57] and he saw him you know have to inject
[1:48:59] themselves with the insulin and he said
[1:49:01] immediately
[1:49:02] like he almost felt something come on
[1:49:04] that devil trying to attack him again
[1:49:06] see that devil's gonna keep trying to
[1:49:07] attack he we think oh we just fought him
[1:49:09] off once he's gone for good no he's
[1:49:11] gonna come back
[1:49:13] he's going to try to attack you
[1:49:15] when you're least expecting it when your
[1:49:16] guard's down
[1:49:18] and what happened he said he had to he
[1:49:19] said he said no i refused that
[1:49:21] and he had to speak against that devil
[1:49:23] for like three days straight he said he
[1:49:26] woke up and he was dizzy and he felt all
[1:49:28] woozy and everything that devil trying
[1:49:30] to put a a
[1:49:31] demon on him with diabetes
[1:49:33] and he said the lord just put it on his
[1:49:34] heart he said i'm going to speak against
[1:49:35] that devil i'm going to give that box of
[1:49:37] snakes right back to him i refuse to
[1:49:39] accept it
[1:49:42] and he spoke that and he confessed that
[1:49:44] and the god brought it to pass because
[1:49:45] it didn't have a problem
[1:49:47] now i'll tell you this the reason i say
[1:49:49] that is because
[1:49:50] the devil been fighting me over the last
[1:49:51] month and a half with headaches
[1:49:53] like constant headaches from the time i
[1:49:55] wake up to the time i go to bed i've
[1:49:57] never struggled with that in my life
[1:49:58] never had a problem with headaches my
[1:50:00] dad had him all my life but i never had
[1:50:02] any problems by the grace of god and
[1:50:03] then the last few months i'd had this
[1:50:05] constant headache
[1:50:07] that wasn't like a migraine by the grace
[1:50:09] of the lord but it was always present
[1:50:11] from the time i woke up to the time i go
[1:50:12] to bed i get a little relief here and
[1:50:14] there and i would just you know how the
[1:50:15] devil is oh you're definitely dead
[1:50:17] you know you're dead
[1:50:19] you probably got two months to live they
[1:50:21] didn't catch it in time you're gone you
[1:50:23] know how the devil is
[1:50:24] and i and i'm ashamed to admit you know
[1:50:26] you entertain those thoughts for even
[1:50:27] more than a second and the devil's gotta
[1:50:29] latch on to you right
[1:50:32] and that i tell but i'd say this to to
[1:50:34] give glory to the lord jesus because
[1:50:35] this is how powerful your testimony is i
[1:50:37] heard that brother's testimony i didn't
[1:50:39] even tell him about what i was
[1:50:40] struggling with but it it stirred
[1:50:42] something up in me
[1:50:43] and i was like you know what devil i'm
[1:50:45] tired of this i ain't gonna settle for
[1:50:47] this i'm a i am a spoken word son of god
[1:50:51] and so from that night forward i just
[1:50:53] started to speak i said devil i refuse
[1:50:55] this thing i don't i don't care if
[1:50:56] you're because you know the devil's
[1:50:57] putting all these oh it could be high
[1:50:58] blood pressure it could be this it could
[1:50:59] be that it could be whatever and this
[1:51:00] that and the other i said devil i refuse
[1:51:02] high blood pressure i refuse whatever
[1:51:05] else you're trying to give me i refuse
[1:51:06] these headaches in the name of the lord
[1:51:07] jesus christ and i went to bed that
[1:51:09] night woke up the next morning and it
[1:51:11] had subsided a little bit and i said
[1:51:13] devil i ain't satisfied you get
[1:51:14] completely out of here
[1:51:17] and i've been speaking against it ever
[1:51:18] since and by the grace of god i haven't
[1:51:20] had any hardly of the issues and not
[1:51:22] only that he's completely delivered
[1:51:25] he's a complete deliverer and that devil
[1:51:28] tries to come back on me every once in a
[1:51:29] while and i say no devil i have not
[1:51:31] received return to sender
[1:51:35] because it ain't mine to begin with i
[1:51:37] don't accept it and the problems we come
[1:51:40] into many times because we we just sit
[1:51:41] back and say well this is just this is
[1:51:43] my burden to bear
[1:51:45] this is what i have to deal with
[1:51:48] it's time we started exercising those
[1:51:50] faith muscles
[1:51:52] i'm not saying just go around you know
[1:51:54] go around and just start speaking to
[1:51:55] everybody but the lord's got to put it
[1:51:57] on your heart to do this
[1:51:58] that was my testimony maybe it'll
[1:52:00] encourage one of you i don't know but
[1:52:02] this is why our testimonies are powerful
[1:52:05] because this is what this is faith it's
[1:52:07] building faith
[1:52:08] when you hear a testimony of her brother
[1:52:10] or sister how the lord delivered them
[1:52:11] from something someone takes heart and
[1:52:13] said that's me
[1:52:15] if he could do it for that person what
[1:52:17] about me
[1:52:19] and that's that's what we're here for
[1:52:20] brother not a carnal expectation of oh
[1:52:22] we're just going to do this and i just
[1:52:24] have to do this and i have to do that no
[1:52:26] we're beyond that we're beyond carnal
[1:52:28] ideas
[1:52:30] but we've got to get out of our own
[1:52:32] minds about it our own ideas have to die
[1:52:35] our own thoughts have to die our own
[1:52:36] expectations have to die lord give me
[1:52:38] your thoughts
[1:52:39] give me your ideas give me your
[1:52:41] expectations lord however you want to
[1:52:43] perform your word
[1:52:44] let me be ready to receive it let me be
[1:52:47] ready so that i can be a minister of
[1:52:48] that word in whatever portion you would
[1:52:50] have me to minister
[1:52:53] he says now look at the hindrance that
[1:52:55] abraham had first thing was his age 75
[1:52:58] years old and sarah being 65. she was
[1:53:00] way past the change of life the
[1:53:02] menopause no doubt but what it stopped
[1:53:04] many years before could you imagine that
[1:53:07] not only did the lord give this promise
[1:53:10] but he gave the promise after all hopes
[1:53:13] was already lost
[1:53:16] it's one thing if you know
[1:53:18] things seem to be going you know you're
[1:53:20] maybe struggling
[1:53:21] but
[1:53:22] you kind of feel like you have a
[1:53:23] fighting chance
[1:53:25] and the lord says take heart but see
[1:53:27] that's why the lord does it he loves the
[1:53:28] paradox
[1:53:30] he loves to to get glory out of this
[1:53:32] situation because in weakness he's made
[1:53:34] strong
[1:53:35] when i am weak then he is strong
[1:53:37] remember when we talked about being
[1:53:39] mature christians remember what paul
[1:53:40] said he said i had this thorn in the
[1:53:42] flesh
[1:53:43] he said i prayed three times for the
[1:53:44] lord to take it away and he said not so
[1:53:46] he said my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:53:48] wives he said for my strength is made
[1:53:50] perfect in weakness now a baby christian
[1:53:53] would have said well god why would you
[1:53:55] do that
[1:53:56] well i deserve it you said i'm healed
[1:53:58] and this and that he said my grace is
[1:54:00] sufficient for thee but what did paul
[1:54:01] say he was a mature soldier he said
[1:54:03] therefore he said i will glory in my
[1:54:05] infirmities that the power of god may
[1:54:08] rest upon me
[1:54:10] i'm not saying that and i don't let the
[1:54:12] devil use that to say well i just have
[1:54:13] to live with whatever the devil's trying
[1:54:14] to give me or whatever i'm fighting with
[1:54:16] that's not so but we have to understand
[1:54:18] there's a balance to be struck here
[1:54:21] between that instant gratification of
[1:54:23] lord i prayed for it why isn't it done
[1:54:25] yet
[1:54:26] and the time sometimes the lord will say
[1:54:28] no
[1:54:30] it's just it's just a fact
[1:54:32] let us be in the place where we can
[1:54:33] receive that as mature people mature
[1:54:35] christians
[1:54:37] soldiers
[1:54:39] he says no doubt what it's not many
[1:54:40] years before he had lived with her as a
[1:54:42] wife it was his half-sister and had
[1:54:44] probably taken her when she was just a
[1:54:46] girl in her teens and had married her
[1:54:49] and he had had no children she was
[1:54:51] absolutely barren and now we find that
[1:54:53] to do this he had to separate himself
[1:54:56] from all the peoples who did not believe
[1:54:58] it in order to make it come to pass
[1:55:01] see that's what the lord's waiting for
[1:55:03] separating ourselves from all unbelief
[1:55:06] now i want you to hear what he says
[1:55:07] because this is where i was just so
[1:55:08] i actually looked it up in the message
[1:55:10] before a service today you know in the
[1:55:11] message search and i was just wondering
[1:55:13] how many times did brother branham
[1:55:15] because if you were here on wednesday
[1:55:16] and we're just blessed by what our
[1:55:18] pastor preached and he kind of mentioned
[1:55:19] that gossip type of thing and never you
[1:55:21] don't hear that really preached on much
[1:55:23] and i wonder how much brother branham
[1:55:25] even mentioned it he only mentioned it
[1:55:26] that word gospel only showed up 13 times
[1:55:28] in the message and i just happened to
[1:55:30] listen to proving his word and one of
[1:55:31] those times is right here is the last
[1:55:32] time
[1:55:33] but i love the way it just encouraged me
[1:55:36] because i say lord maybe i'm just in
[1:55:37] that channel you know i'm right it's
[1:55:39] just little things i take heart how many
[1:55:40] of you take heart in those little things
[1:55:42] who has despised the day of small things
[1:55:44] those little bread crumbs that he leaves
[1:55:45] for us
[1:55:46] it's like ruth out in the field those
[1:55:47] handfuls of purpose just to know like
[1:55:50] you're on the right trail just keep
[1:55:51] pressing just keep going
[1:55:53] i say thank you lord for letting me see
[1:55:55] these things but he's talking about
[1:55:56] abraham and separating yourself from
[1:55:59] this unbelief and he says i don't mean
[1:56:00] to say that you have to separate
[1:56:02] yourself from peoples
[1:56:04] but you have to separate yourself from
[1:56:06] all the gossip of unbelief
[1:56:08] and stay away from that
[1:56:10] when people says oh those things don't
[1:56:12] happen that's a bunch of lunatic people
[1:56:14] there is no such a thing as that
[1:56:15] happening just close up your ears and
[1:56:18] walk away don't pay any attention to it
[1:56:21] and that's where we get it's if we let
[1:56:24] it catch our ear he's got us right there
[1:56:26] but we we look don't look to the left or
[1:56:28] to the right don't look to one side or
[1:56:30] the other you've got to be completely
[1:56:32] dead what did we hear this morning a
[1:56:33] dead man doesn't react
[1:56:35] a dead man can't do anything of himself
[1:56:39] i want to be dead
[1:56:41] i want i want this body to be dead
[1:56:43] wrecking myself dead but alive to christ
[1:56:46] so that he can live through me
[1:56:48] amen now we're just going to skip down a
[1:56:49] little bit
[1:56:50] so
[1:56:52] down here in paragraph 86 he says if his
[1:56:54] children will only take his word so he
[1:56:57] can i want you to listen to this if his
[1:57:00] children will only take his word
[1:57:03] so he can prove it by you
[1:57:06] that struck me the way he said that
[1:57:08] because he didn't say prove it to you
[1:57:11] because we already already have the word
[1:57:13] proven to us if we say we believe
[1:57:15] if we say we believe
[1:57:17] it's already been proven to us
[1:57:20] but now he wants to prove his word by
[1:57:22] you in you
[1:57:25] through you
[1:57:26] your testimony you're a written epistle
[1:57:29] you are to be the one that proves that
[1:57:32] the god
[1:57:35] of william branham the god of abraham
[1:57:37] isaac and jacob jehovah of the old
[1:57:39] testament jesus christ of the new is
[1:57:41] still alive and well right now
[1:57:44] your life he wants to prove it by you
[1:57:48] not just by the preacher
[1:57:50] not just by the pastor not just by the
[1:57:52] the musician or this other but every day
[1:57:55] that you live
[1:57:56] god is wanting to prove his word
[1:57:58] by you
[1:58:01] we shouldn't if we claim we believe if i
[1:58:03] could say it this way if we claim that
[1:58:04] we believe how many of you say i believe
[1:58:06] i believe the word of god well then he's
[1:58:09] already proven it to you
[1:58:11] now he wants to prove it by you
[1:58:14] that's where we got to step off the
[1:58:15] sidelines
[1:58:16] that's where what our pastor was
[1:58:18] preaching a couple months ago about
[1:58:19] working the works of faith about
[1:58:22] actually being active in this world not
[1:58:25] just sitting on the side oh someone else
[1:58:26] would do that someone else would do this
[1:58:28] but the book of james says true religion
[1:58:30] undefiled is this to visit the orphans
[1:58:32] and the widows when you see someone in
[1:58:34] need you're there to act
[1:58:35] you say oh lord what can i do for you
[1:58:38] he's laid out a lot of things right here
[1:58:40] that are just so simple
[1:58:43] but he told the pharisees he said you
[1:58:44] tried to do these he said you left one
[1:58:46] thing done you did one thing but you
[1:58:48] left the others undone
[1:58:50] how many little things are we leaving
[1:58:51] undone because oh someone else will do
[1:58:53] that
[1:58:54] someone else will do this
[1:58:55] no he maybe he's called you to do it
[1:58:58] maybe he's got that for you to fulfill
[1:59:01] he wants to prove his word by you
[1:59:04] that's the way that that's the only way
[1:59:06] he can prove his word
[1:59:08] he doesn't prove it to unbelievers
[1:59:12] they can't be proved they're unbelievers
[1:59:15] but it's not to unbelievers
[1:59:17] it's not for unbelievers
[1:59:20] it's to them that believe
[1:59:22] if he can find someone who will believe
[1:59:24] his word he will prove his word by you
[1:59:28] that's that's the difference and i love
[1:59:30] the way what are the brother billy's did
[1:59:32] this morning he said how many times do
[1:59:33] we get in our mind oh i just want to put
[1:59:35] it to him i just want god to do this so
[1:59:38] i can just stick it to this person who's
[1:59:40] been criticizing me that's not the
[1:59:41] spirit of christ
[1:59:43] because the spirit of christ was father
[1:59:44] forgive them they know not what they do
[1:59:46] laying out the sin the spirit of christ
[1:59:48] and stephen lord laying out this sin to
[1:59:50] their charge
[1:59:51] wasn't the spirit of god seeing so many
[1:59:53] times i've been there
[1:59:55] lord i just wish lord if you could just
[1:59:58] do this thing just to prove these
[2:00:00] naysayers wrong
[2:00:04] i'm just being honest
[2:00:06] elijah did that if i be a man of god
[2:00:08] send fire from heaven said that was an
[2:00:10] angry prophet why because he was a man
[2:00:12] of like passions
[2:00:15] fighting these battles
[2:00:17] but let's let the spirit of christ work
[2:00:19] in us that spirit of love
[2:00:21] if you can do all these things but not
[2:00:22] have not charity it profits nothing
[2:00:25] it's not going to get anywhere
[2:00:28] it said he wants to prove it by them he
[2:00:31] said do you remember the blind man jesus
[2:00:32] found
[2:00:33] he said he says it's to him to believe
[2:00:35] and if he could find someone who believe
[2:00:36] his word he will prove his word by you
[2:00:38] and sometimes sickness and things happen
[2:00:41] to us that way
[2:00:42] that god can prove himself
[2:00:44] do you remember the blind man that jesus
[2:00:46] found they said who sinned he or his
[2:00:48] father his mother
[2:00:50] he said in this case neither but that
[2:00:52] the works of god might be made known see
[2:00:54] they had the same idea right we want to
[2:00:56] understand why the how the why why did
[2:00:58] this happen why did he said
[2:01:00] well you went completely over the top of
[2:01:02] it it wasn't for any of those reasons
[2:01:03] it's just so i can prove the word of god
[2:01:05] to you
[2:01:06] and prove the word of god to this
[2:01:08] individual in this moment to prove i am
[2:01:10] who i am
[2:01:12] his ways are so past our finding out but
[2:01:15] that's why we need to we've received the
[2:01:17] mind of christ let this mind be in you
[2:01:20] that was also in christ jesus see you
[2:01:22] can't just have it your your own ideas
[2:01:25] the only way you can have the mind of
[2:01:26] christ is to have the spirit of christ
[2:01:28] in you
[2:01:30] the only way you can do it
[2:01:35] he said in this case neither but that
[2:01:37] the works of god might be made known see
[2:01:40] it happened to that boy so that jesus
[2:01:42] could be glorified sometimes sickness is
[2:01:45] not a curse
[2:01:46] it's a blessing
[2:01:48] that we can stick our faith out there
[2:01:50] and call those things which are not as
[2:01:53] though they were
[2:01:55] god said so
[2:01:56] and he'll prove it so if you'll just not
[2:01:59] weaken under the test oh my
[2:02:01] oh lord help us
[2:02:03] you know i think
[2:02:04] you know i remember just to give another
[2:02:06] little testimony of my own life
[2:02:08] i know god proved something to me
[2:02:10] you know i had been got engaged to
[2:02:12] sister lindsay and within a week almost
[2:02:15] had my hand chopped off at my job it was
[2:02:17] like within a week wasn't it within a
[2:02:18] week or a couple of of getting engaged
[2:02:21] to her proposed to her and then i was at
[2:02:22] work and i don't know if you may have
[2:02:24] seen my hand with the scar and
[2:02:25] everything on it but i had a piece of
[2:02:27] sheet metal on a crane on an overhead
[2:02:29] crane slide by and guillotine my hand
[2:02:32] almost chopped my whole hand in half
[2:02:34] cut it all the way down to the bone it
[2:02:35] was a thin piece of metal it was
[2:02:36] probably an eighth less than it's
[2:02:37] probably an eighth inch thick piece of
[2:02:39] sheet steel a four by eight sheet on a
[2:02:41] crane
[2:02:42] and i walked through an area and the guy
[2:02:45] i thought he stopped i was going to go
[2:02:46] to the bathroom i was i worked at the
[2:02:47] factory and
[2:02:49] i was getting ready to walk through his
[2:02:50] area i saw him he saw me he stopped the
[2:02:52] crane
[2:02:53] and i was like oh he's going to let me
[2:02:54] go through as soon as i walked through
[2:02:56] he started the crane again
[2:02:58] and i didn't have anywhere to go there's
[2:02:59] a big stack of stuff behind me
[2:03:01] and that he stopped the crane but if you
[2:03:03] know if you ever worked with an overhead
[2:03:04] crane they have momentum to them the
[2:03:06] brakes don't stop right away and it
[2:03:07] stopped came to a stop and it swung
[2:03:09] right at me and just instinctively i put
[2:03:11] my hand out and it just banged it
[2:03:13] against there and chopped it almost in
[2:03:14] half it chopped my all the way down to
[2:03:16] the bones chopped all the ligaments all
[2:03:18] the tendons all the blood vessels
[2:03:20] everything
[2:03:21] and
[2:03:22] you know by the grace of god you know
[2:03:23] had i tried to duck it might have
[2:03:25] chopped my head off
[2:03:26] but the lord just i stuck my hand out
[2:03:28] there you know
[2:03:29] and
[2:03:30] i i say it this because you know that's
[2:03:33] a test
[2:03:34] it's just the fact of the matter it's
[2:03:35] just a test
[2:03:36] but the lord
[2:03:38] showed me something you know that that i
[2:03:40] take heart into myself
[2:03:43] well in that moment you know a reaction
[2:03:45] you know my first reaction was i
[2:03:46] screamed you know i just screamed out
[2:03:48] loud you know it's an instant reaction
[2:03:50] but i'll never forget
[2:03:52] that
[2:03:53] and this isn't to glorify myself because
[2:03:55] i know it's only god because a man can't
[2:03:57] do it
[2:03:59] in that moment you know you think you'd
[2:04:01] just be crying out in pain or whatever
[2:04:03] and i remember my first thing was i
[2:04:05] cried out in pain just a quick ah you
[2:04:08] know that kind of a thing because it was
[2:04:09] a surprise
[2:04:10] and then i remember the first thing that
[2:04:12] that came to my mind was do not look at
[2:04:14] it because it will be worse and i
[2:04:16] grabbed my hand
[2:04:17] and i knelt down on the floor and and i
[2:04:20] i prayed and i remember being
[2:04:23] excruciating pain like you can't
[2:04:24] describe
[2:04:25] you know and without you know i don't
[2:04:27] want to be graphic about it but i knew
[2:04:28] it was bad because i could i could feel
[2:04:31] that this top half of my hand was just
[2:04:33] flopping around i could feel that in an
[2:04:34] instant i just grabbed it and i knelt
[2:04:36] down and i remember praying to the lord
[2:04:38] i said lord
[2:04:39] because i i be honest i was fly i saved
[2:04:42] this way i was flying really high the
[2:04:44] lord had answered a bunch of my prayers
[2:04:45] he brought a lot of things to pass in
[2:04:47] getting engaged to sister lindsay he'd
[2:04:49] answered prayers
[2:04:50] and different things that had happened
[2:04:51] and brought and you know how you're just
[2:04:53] on a mountaintop
[2:04:54] and sometimes you know the lord wants to
[2:04:56] just kind of like job right you were on
[2:04:58] a job was on a mountaintop
[2:05:00] he said he said the only satan said the
[2:05:01] only reason he loves you is because you
[2:05:02] blessed him so much he's always on the
[2:05:04] mountaintop you're answering his prayers
[2:05:06] you blessed him with all the goods and
[2:05:07] things he said all right we'll try them
[2:05:08] we'll see what happens
[2:05:10] and not that i'm job of any or anything
[2:05:12] i wouldn't put myself in that category
[2:05:14] but um
[2:05:15] just to show you that the lord will take
[2:05:17] those opportunities to test you and i
[2:05:20] remember getting down on the on the
[2:05:21] ground and i just knelt there because i
[2:05:22] had nothing else and the only thing i
[2:05:24] could think is i prayed to the lord i
[2:05:25] said lord because you know when i came
[2:05:27] when i came to the lord to this message
[2:05:29] in 2002
[2:05:30] i just remember
[2:05:32] that i i i prayed to lord and i still do
[2:05:35] i but i prayed to the lord one of the
[2:05:36] first things i pray i said lord when i
[2:05:38] when you come to a realization of the
[2:05:39] truth of this message and where we're at
[2:05:42] at the coming of the lord it sobers you
[2:05:45] and you start to real when you really
[2:05:46] have a revelation you start to
[2:05:47] understand
[2:05:49] the opportunity that lays before you and
[2:05:51] what god has opened up to you
[2:05:54] and how he's chosen you and who you are
[2:05:56] and you start to realize lord how can
[2:05:58] people reject this
[2:06:01] and i remember just praying to the lord
[2:06:02] i said lord i prayed the lord and i
[2:06:04] still do i said lord i don't care what
[2:06:05] it takes
[2:06:06] what i have to go through
[2:06:08] don't let me miss it
[2:06:10] and and i remember getting down on that
[2:06:12] ground
[2:06:13] my hand bleeding and just closing my
[2:06:15] eyes and praying i said lord
[2:06:17] and i and this is basically this is what
[2:06:18] i prayed almost verbatim i said lord i
[2:06:21] said lord i don't know why this is
[2:06:22] happening
[2:06:23] because right then i knew you know i
[2:06:25] play guitar
[2:06:26] you know i like to play instruments and
[2:06:28] things
[2:06:29] and uh all and i'm like you know the
[2:06:31] first thing is going into your mind the
[2:06:32] devil's right there oh you're going to
[2:06:34] lose your hand you're not going to be
[2:06:35] able to work anymore you're going to be
[2:06:36] crippled you're not going to do anything
[2:06:38] the rest of your life all these things
[2:06:39] are going through your mind
[2:06:40] now maybe and then you all you're going
[2:06:42] to get gangrene in the hand or something
[2:06:43] and they're going to chop off your arm
[2:06:44] you know you know how the devil works he
[2:06:46] goes right to the end of the line
[2:06:49] you know he's right there to take it all
[2:06:50] the way to the end
[2:06:52] and and i remember i got down i said
[2:06:54] lord
[2:06:55] i said lord i don't know why this is
[2:06:56] happening
[2:06:58] i said but lord if this is what it's
[2:07:00] going to take for me to if this if going
[2:07:02] through this is part of what it takes
[2:07:03] for me to make a rapture i said lord
[2:07:04] just give me the strength to endure
[2:07:08] that's not a man
[2:07:10] i know that was god
[2:07:12] because
[2:07:13] my natural instinct and and even just as
[2:07:16] a confession you know
[2:07:17] there have been times since then
[2:07:19] that you know i've had pity on myself
[2:07:22] and you kind of sit on the ass sheep as
[2:07:24] it were he said lord why did that happen
[2:07:26] to me you don't maybe necessarily
[2:07:27] understand everything but i tell you
[2:07:29] what had it not been had it not been for
[2:07:31] that i wouldn't be here
[2:07:33] because it was because of that and some
[2:07:34] circumstances that
[2:07:36] happened afterwards that led me to get
[2:07:38] the job that i had now that led me to
[2:07:40] leave that job and become an air traffic
[2:07:42] controller that led me down to get an
[2:07:44] apartment that was five minutes from
[2:07:45] this church without even knowing it you
[2:07:47] know and the thing see the lord does all
[2:07:49] things well the footsteps of the
[2:07:51] righteous are ordered by the lord
[2:07:53] but you know my carnal expectation was
[2:07:55] not to have my hand almost chopped off
[2:08:00] but but i tell you what i do know one
[2:08:01] thing he promised to heal it
[2:08:03] i've had a dream of it and i know we
[2:08:05] don't always take stock in dreams and
[2:08:07] you say oh that but i know he's already
[2:08:08] healed it because his scripture says
[2:08:09] that so i take any dream that confirms
[2:08:11] that as a positive and i've had a dream
[2:08:13] of it
[2:08:14] and i know a brother up in ohio that had
[2:08:16] a dream of a similar thing of me playing
[2:08:18] guitar again so i know it's coming and
[2:08:20] for any of you that are that have a that
[2:08:22] have a healing need in your body
[2:08:24] god's going to fulfill it
[2:08:27] because not because of your expectation
[2:08:29] of it but it's because he said he would
[2:08:33] that's what he wants from you is to
[2:08:34] stand that's why that's why i felt led
[2:08:36] to sing that song at the beginning
[2:08:37] all he wants is to find someone who's
[2:08:41] willing to stand on that promise
[2:08:43] and not move from it
[2:08:46] no matter what the circumstances lord i
[2:08:48] don't understand why it hasn't happened
[2:08:49] yet
[2:08:50] lord i don't understand
[2:08:52] why you know sister lindsey and i
[2:08:54] haven't been able to have a child yet
[2:08:56] haven't i don't understand it
[2:08:58] i know there are others that have
[2:09:00] probably gone through the same thing
[2:09:01] that have gone through the same thing i
[2:09:02] don't understand it i don't have to
[2:09:03] understand it lord you promised it
[2:09:06] and i will stand here
[2:09:07] and i will wait until you make the
[2:09:09] promise come to pass because i didn't
[2:09:11] give the promise
[2:09:13] i can't make it come to pass but i know
[2:09:15] the one who did promise and this and i
[2:09:17] know that he can't lie
[2:09:19] and if he can't lie then he will bring
[2:09:22] it to pass
[2:09:23] that goes the same for you those those
[2:09:25] of you who have loved ones that are
[2:09:26] astray
[2:09:27] that the lord's given you a promise says
[2:09:29] i haven't lost one
[2:09:31] is that i've given you your family
[2:09:33] it doesn't matter what the circumstances
[2:09:34] are because god doesn't care about
[2:09:36] circumstances circumstances don't have
[2:09:38] anything to do with god's word god's
[2:09:40] word overcomes the circumstance
[2:09:42] not the other way around
[2:09:44] so don't look at the circumstances don't
[2:09:46] look at your situation god wants someone
[2:09:48] that can look at the word
[2:09:50] that can look at that promise and stand
[2:09:52] there
[2:09:53] like abraham growing stronger in faith
[2:09:56] well sarah do you feel any better no
[2:09:58] well bless god we'll have it anyhow
[2:10:02] brother randy is your hand healed yet do
[2:10:04] you feel any different well maybe not
[2:10:05] yet i got a little pinky that doesn't
[2:10:07] want to go straight yet and i feel a
[2:10:08] little tingle in my hand but you know
[2:10:10] what bless god i'm gonna have it anyhow
[2:10:13] why because i didn't make the promise
[2:10:17] but i believe the promise i believe the
[2:10:19] one that made the promise
[2:10:21] he's looking for someone that simple
[2:10:26] let's stop making it complicated
[2:10:28] brothers and sisters
[2:10:29] when he says something in his word he
[2:10:31] means it
[2:10:35] he means it
[2:10:36] you say brother you're getting fired up
[2:10:37] about this yes i am because satan has
[2:10:39] tried to complicate things so much even
[2:10:42] even within the word that we've received
[2:10:44] tried to make it so complicated but
[2:10:47] brother branham had to come and bookend
[2:10:49] the seals with god hidden in simplicity
[2:10:52] and revealed in the same why because he
[2:10:54] knew
[2:10:55] that with all this word that would be
[2:10:56] revealed satan would be right behind it
[2:10:58] to do what he did in the garden yea hath
[2:11:01] god said
[2:11:03] he said but in that day you eat that
[2:11:04] love you shall be as gods knowing good
[2:11:06] and evil
[2:11:08] eve didn't even realize she already was
[2:11:10] god
[2:11:11] she was already a god of the earth with
[2:11:13] her husband
[2:11:14] already was in that space but the
[2:11:16] devil's trying to entice her with
[2:11:18] something supposedly above what god had
[2:11:20] already given
[2:11:21] she already was in that position
[2:11:25] not only that
[2:11:26] she knew good and evil
[2:11:29] because to do god's word is good and to
[2:11:31] not do his word as evil
[2:11:33] it's that simple but see how the devil
[2:11:35] just tried to mix it up complicated just
[2:11:37] a little bit
[2:11:39] that's where let us have faith as little
[2:11:41] children but let's have the maturity of
[2:11:43] grown-ups
[2:11:44] lord you said it i believe it that
[2:11:46] settles it it's that simple
[2:11:48] but we've got to die to ourselves
[2:11:50] as we stand
[2:11:51] let's just stand
[2:11:54] just wanna maybe
[2:11:55] one little one little other thing
[2:11:58] i started thinking about this you know
[2:11:59] god
[2:12:01] what is our expectation what are you
[2:12:03] expecting
[2:12:05] see i expect that god can hear our cry
[2:12:10] he said my people which are called by my
[2:12:11] name if they will turn from their wicked
[2:12:13] wicked ways
[2:12:15] and seek the lord he said i will answer
[2:12:16] from heaven
[2:12:18] we heard brother billy even mention it
[2:12:20] this morning you know any you know how
[2:12:22] many of you gone through dry times in
[2:12:23] your life
[2:12:24] gone through times just oh lord it feels
[2:12:26] so dry i feel like maybe even i feel a
[2:12:28] little dead i just feel i don't have
[2:12:31] that life isn't is it pulsing the way
[2:12:33] like lord lord restoring to me the joy
[2:12:35] of thy salvation
[2:12:38] you know what i appreciate i appreciate
[2:12:39] jonah
[2:12:41] because jonah was dead
[2:12:44] jesus said as jonah was in the belly of
[2:12:46] the well three days and nights that was
[2:12:48] a type of death
[2:12:49] and even in death
[2:12:52] jonah had enough in him he said once
[2:12:55] more well i turn again towards thy holy
[2:12:57] temple
[2:12:58] he said because he knew that what did
[2:12:59] the prophet say he said he knew
[2:13:02] that there was a prayer that was prayed
[2:13:04] by solomon
[2:13:05] he said that if any of your people be
[2:13:07] anywhere
[2:13:08] they turn towards this temple and pray
[2:13:09] hear thou from heaven and he said and he
[2:13:11] knew that god answered and honored that
[2:13:14] prayer
[2:13:15] even in that dead state
[2:13:17] could i say it that way jonah was dead
[2:13:21] but god could hear
[2:13:23] bring him back to life a type of the
[2:13:24] resurrection
[2:13:26] i had a brother there was a brother in
[2:13:28] iowa that preached and i loved the way
[2:13:29] he said this so much he said he said it
[2:13:31] took seemingly how god
[2:13:34] gets glory in these things he said he
[2:13:35] took seemingly one of the most
[2:13:37] disobedient acts in the scripture
[2:13:40] and made it a type of the most obedient
[2:13:42] act ever done
[2:13:44] i loved it seemed like he was disobeying
[2:13:46] so greatly but we understand by a
[2:13:48] prophet that the lord was ordering all
[2:13:50] these things
[2:13:51] but think about
[2:13:52] that aaron's rod that butted
[2:13:55] totally dead
[2:13:57] doesn't matter if you feel dead
[2:13:59] just get in the presence of god
[2:14:03] but what's the problem
[2:14:04] our carnal ideas
[2:14:06] our carnal expectations lay that aside
[2:14:09] when when the children of israel came up
[2:14:12] to the river jordan remember jordan
[2:14:14] types death
[2:14:16] death to self that's where you have to
[2:14:18] die
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:21] brother branham said it in here i didn't
[2:14:22] we didn't read the quote but i could
[2:14:24] just kind of paraphrase he says he said
[2:14:25] god looked like a horrible general
[2:14:28] bringing his people to the river jordan
[2:14:29] in the springtime when when the banks of
[2:14:31] the river overflowed
[2:14:34] death overflowing on every hand that's
[2:14:36] where we're at right now
[2:14:38] death on every hand spiritual death
[2:14:41] but what happened the children of israel
[2:14:43] said put that ark
[2:14:45] forward what is the ark that's the world
[2:14:48] put the word before you
[2:14:49] and go forward and what did it do death
[2:14:52] had to part and they could walk over on
[2:14:55] dry land
[2:14:57] so if you're looking
[2:14:58] to find the promises of god in your life
[2:15:01] you've got to die to yourself we have to
[2:15:03] be more sincere we need to be more dead
[2:15:05] to ourselves
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:07] if there's nobody else that needs it
[2:15:08] lord i do
[2:15:11] i can raise my hand and say lord i need
[2:15:12] that
[2:15:14] i need more depth to myself
[2:15:16] lord from the time i wake up to the time
[2:15:18] i go to bed let me just bury that old
[2:15:20] man under the ground let me get rid of
[2:15:22] him
[2:15:23] and find your mind lord jesus
[2:15:25] let me not have any expectation for
[2:15:27] anything else lord but let me be in your
[2:15:29] mind
[2:15:30] [Music]
[2:15:32] amen
[2:15:33] let's just bow our heads
[2:15:36] heavenly father
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:39] lord i believe the earnest desire of
[2:15:41] every one hero god is to see you
[2:15:42] manifest in their lives
[2:15:45] lord to see themselves die away o god
[2:15:48] until only the life of jesus christ
[2:15:50] remains
[2:15:53] lord surely we we have our little
[2:15:55] personalities lord we like maybe
[2:15:57] different foods in the natural and
[2:16:00] we like different colors or different
[2:16:02] things according to that nature oh god
[2:16:03] but we're not looking at the carnal
[2:16:04] themes of god we're looking at a
[2:16:06] spiritual appetite
[2:16:08] we're looking at a nature oh god
[2:16:11] that could say as mary did be it unto me
[2:16:13] according to that word
[2:16:15] that would lay down ourselves upon the
[2:16:17] altar
[2:16:19] as a living sacrifice which is in our
[2:16:21] which our reasonable service
[2:16:24] lord we don't want to have any of
[2:16:25] ourselves anymore of god
[2:16:27] we don't want our own appetites anymore
[2:16:29] the appetites of the flesh that try to
[2:16:31] war against the spirit
[2:16:33] but lord let us meet the enemy on the
[2:16:36] battlefield with the word
[2:16:38] let us draw that sword of the spirit
[2:16:41] have the shield of faith
[2:16:43] the whole armor of god lord to go out to
[2:16:45] battle

[2:17:56] thing but lord he couldn't do anything
[2:17:59] more for us than you've already done

[2:23:47] me and forgive me until somehow you
[2:23:49] think you're gonna work up enough that
[2:23:51] god will do something for you he's
[2:23:52] already done it
[2:23:54] he just wants you to accept it and stay
[2:23:57] with that confession

[2:39:53] and words cannot express the

[2:40:29] [Music]
[2:40:31] we will use the
[2:40:34] know
[2:40:36] [Applause]
[2:40:39] [Music]
[2:40:53] i just want to give a testimony here
[2:40:55] something that just happened up here
[2:40:56] because i want to give glory to god
[2:40:58] and i want you to know that no matter
[2:41:00] what it looks like to you on the outside
[2:41:02] to the natural god's working
[2:41:05] we just had
[2:41:06] two independent sisters come up here
[2:41:08] [Music]
[2:41:10] within a span of a couple minutes and
[2:41:12] ask prayer because they felt a burden
[2:41:14] for sister heidi thomas
[2:41:16] sister laura came up here
[2:41:17] and then sister kelly came up right
[2:41:19] afterward
[2:41:20] they didn't they couldn't have known
[2:41:21] that
[2:41:22] and then i witnessed a sister laura and
[2:41:24] sister kelly during first service this
[2:41:26] morning i sat behind sister heidi and
[2:41:28] brother brother matt and i felt such a
[2:41:31] burden this morning on my heart for
[2:41:32] sister heidi knowing what she's going
[2:41:34] through
[2:41:35] can't explain it but i i felt like my
[2:41:38] spirit was locked into sister heidi this
[2:41:40] morning if i could say it that way i
[2:41:42] just it was such a burden the whole
[2:41:44] service i was praying lord
[2:41:46] you know her heart
[2:41:47] she desires to serve you with all that
[2:41:50] she's got
[2:41:51] she suffered greatly
[2:41:53] but she's standing on the promise
[2:41:56] and then god comes and confirms it
[2:41:59] god is working
[2:42:01] amongst his people
[2:42:03] we can stand on that promise i don't
[2:42:05] know how he's going to do i don't care
[2:42:07] how he does it but he's going to fulfill
[2:42:09] his promise to sister heidi and brother
[2:42:11] matt
[2:42:13] so i just want to say that because you
[2:42:15] know so many times those things might
[2:42:16] just go and nobody maybe they would get
[2:42:18] known but i'm going to say it right now
[2:42:19] because it's a testimony that jesus
[2:42:22] christ is alive amongst his people right
[2:42:24] now
[2:42:26] oh that was for brother branham say
[2:42:27] that's for our day right now that's the
[2:42:29] children's bread
[2:42:30] that's not for the world out there
[2:42:33] benny hinn and all the rest of those
[2:42:34] televangelists and things that try to
[2:42:36] make things act like a certain thing but
[2:42:37] that's a scarecrow but this is a real
[2:42:40] god
[2:42:42] because i can tell you i didn't talk to
[2:42:43] sister laura's sister kelly
[2:42:45] i know they weren't talking to each
[2:42:46] other about this specifically but
[2:42:48] there's a holy ghost
[2:42:50] that is putting a burden on the hearts
[2:42:51] of the people and then just to have an
[2:42:53] unction and then to not only that but to
[2:42:55] be obedient to that unction
[2:42:57] amen
[2:42:59] and i'm glad that the lord brought that
[2:43:00] to mind because i want you to remember
[2:43:02] i wrote it down but i didn't get to it
[2:43:04] just one last thing and then we'll close
[2:43:05] in prayer with brother cosman you know
[2:43:08] when joshua when they went over into the
[2:43:10] into the promised land what was the
[2:43:11] first thing they did they they came to
[2:43:13] jericho and the lord said you compass
[2:43:15] that city about
[2:43:17] you compass it about once a day for
[2:43:18] seven days and on the seventh day do it
[2:43:20] seven times and then blow the trumpet it
[2:43:22] wasn't the trumpet blast and the
[2:43:24] marching that caused the wall to fall
[2:43:25] down but it was obedience to the word of
[2:43:28] god
[2:43:30] the power was in the obedience
[2:43:33] and god brought to pass you tell me how
[2:43:36] a sound wave from a trumpet or the
[2:43:37] voices of people could do it i don't
[2:43:39] know don't care but it was the obedience
[2:43:42] to the word of god that looked silly
[2:43:44] you're going to conquer a city by
[2:43:46] marching around it a bunch of times yeah
[2:43:48] why because god said we would
[2:43:51] and that's what sister heidi i know
[2:43:53] you're probably listening to right now i
[2:43:54] want it to be an encouragement
[2:43:56] wherever
[2:43:58] that is it's coming to pass
[2:44:00] he's confirmed here
[2:44:03] god is working right now
[2:44:05] it's not about what you can see or feel
[2:44:07] with your hands or all these different
[2:44:09] things but obey the word of god these
[2:44:12] sisters obeyed the word of god they felt
[2:44:13] an unction they came forward just like
[2:44:15] the sister that prayed for that baby
[2:44:17] she obeyed the word of god and god
[2:44:19] honored it
[2:44:20] because of that obedience and that's
[2:44:22] what we're coming to
[2:44:24] so as our brother cosman i just wanted
[2:44:25] to say that to encourage you
[2:44:27] god is working amongst his people
[2:44:29] it's not an open show
[2:44:31] it may not be out there to the
[2:44:32] unbeliever what a brother brain i'm
[2:44:33] seeing the quote right he says not to
[2:44:35] the unbeliever
[2:44:36] that's the children's bread
[2:44:39] that's yours that's mine that's our
[2:44:41] inheritance
[2:44:43] so we're not going to let the devil take
[2:44:44] it from us
[2:44:51] this second verse is brother billy comes
[2:44:53] in this message tonight amen
[2:44:55] if words could fall like
[2:44:59] [Music]
[2:45:08] if
[2:45:12] [Music]
[2:45:13] i will still run out of time
[2:45:17] [Music]
[2:45:35] thank you for the truth
[2:45:44] so listen to our hearts
[2:45:50] and hear us
[2:45:52] [Music]
[2:46:08] we
[2:46:10] [Music]
[2:46:18] you
[2:46:19] are
[2:46:26] [Music]
[2:46:30] hallelujah
[2:46:31] did you enjoy the word tonight
[2:46:34] hallelujah it's wonderful to be in his
[2:46:36] presence
[2:46:37] you know that's what randy was speaking
[2:46:40] you know we all want to be at the
[2:46:42] mountaintop all the time
[2:46:44] but you know that's where if you stay
[2:46:46] there too long your fruits will freeze
[2:46:49] you need some valleys experience
[2:46:51] where you can know god who he is and
[2:46:54] you can get into some fights and
[2:46:56] where you can get into your knees and
[2:46:58] pray and let the word of god become a
[2:47:01] reality to you that could take you right
[2:47:03] back into the mountaintop but he's made
[2:47:06] the valley so we can fight
[2:47:08] amen i so enjoy what he was saying and
[2:47:11] for our sister heidi i'll just say it
[2:47:13] was amazing how the just the sisters
[2:47:15] just came and showed up and we looked at
[2:47:17] each other we said god is going to do
[2:47:19] something
[2:47:20] let's just spot our heads our gracious
[2:47:22] father
[2:47:23] father as your children with soul
[2:47:25] father
[2:47:26] move to be in your presence even tonight
[2:47:29] lord
[2:47:30] father your word came forth and
[2:47:33] and i believe with all my heart you're
[2:47:34] making your word a reality to us
[2:47:37] father we don't want to be the
[2:47:39] interpreter of your word and
[2:47:41] because your prophet tells us that you
[2:47:43] are your own interpreter
[2:47:44] and the way you interpret it is by
[2:47:46] taking what you said and making it to
[2:47:48] pass
[2:47:49] and father even now we say
[2:47:52] father let the word that was spoken
[2:47:54] tonight lord and let it be applied to
[2:47:56] our lives lord let it become a reality
[2:47:59] lord and we don't want to be just
[2:48:01] hearers of the word but we want to be
[2:48:03] doers also
[2:48:04] we want to be a people with the
[2:48:06] expectation of the supernatural lord and
[2:48:09] not the interpretation of the mind but
[2:48:11] those that
[2:48:12] they can grab the supernatural they can
[2:48:15] believe in the supernatural and god will
[2:48:18] take the supernatural and translate it
[2:48:20] into the natural world that's what we
[2:48:22] desire tonight father for the desires
[2:48:24] those that came up for prayer lord we
[2:48:27] commit everything into your hands and we
[2:48:29] know you never fail lord and we know

[2:48:45] everything lord we claim every single
[2:48:48] promise and why because you've placed us
[2:48:51] in the promised land and you've given us
[2:48:53] all this promise and it's up to us to
[2:48:55] claim them and bring them to you and
[2:48:57] cash them out lord we're here to cash
[2:48:59] our healing oh god and we're here to
[2:49:01] cash our deliverance loan we're here to
[2:49:04] cast every bit of things that we have
[2:49:06] need of lord why because we pro you
[2:49:09] promised to us that the things which you
[2:49:11] have said in your word they will become
[2:49:13] a reality within our lives and therefore

[2:49:42] spoken to his heart and i pray father
[2:49:45] even now you increase him with abundant
[2:49:47] revelation lord lord we are a people
[2:49:50] under an expectation that any moment

[2:49:55] this thing will end and we'll be in a
[2:49:57] rapture therefore we walk with that
[2:49:59] expectation we continue to look on you
[2:50:02] because you said look unto me until the
[2:50:05] end of the earth so look unto me ye all
