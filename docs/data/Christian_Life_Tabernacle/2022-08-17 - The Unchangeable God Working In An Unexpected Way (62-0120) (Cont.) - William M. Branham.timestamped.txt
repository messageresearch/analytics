[22:44] you have a God that can do all things
[22:48] and you just like to lift your hand to
[22:49] him and maybe it's somebody on your
[22:52] heart or

[22:59] raise
[23:00] there's all things are possible
[23:03] to them that believe
[23:05] let us pray our heavenly father
[23:08] we ask you tonight to look upon our
[23:12] hearts
[23:14] Lord the scripture tells us that you
[23:17] know what we have need of even before we
[23:20] asked
[23:22] father we have requests that we make
[23:26] but Lord there's also those things that
[23:28] we don't know that we need
[23:30] and we ask that you supply those also
[23:34] Lord Jesus that you grant us tonight
[23:37] your grace
[23:38] your mercy your goodness
[23:41] father that the love that we sing about
[23:43] that each of us
[23:45] may feel the touch of that love
[23:48] and our Lord and savior prayed father
[23:51] might they know the love wherein you
[23:53] love me
[23:54] and father we ask that we could know
[23:56] that this evening in your precious name
[23:59] we pray amen amen God bless you may be
[24:04] seated tonight we're just going to
[24:07] finish a little bit of the message we
[24:11] listened to the other evening but before
[24:14] that I was fellowshipping with Matthew
[24:17] and we were talking about a few things
[24:20] about the placing of the message and
[24:22] where it is in time Matthew's real good
[24:25] about Bible timelines and message
[24:28] timelines so I've asked him to come up
[24:31] just
[24:32] share a few Thoughts with where this
[24:36] message fell in place and how God's
[24:39] perfect timing is so if Matthew is here
[24:42] Mary Matthew if you just come up and
[24:44] share some of those thoughts that we
[24:45] fellowship with with the people will joy
[24:49] and then we'll finish this tape this
[24:51] evening and uh so Lord bless you brother
[24:54] man
[24:57] I don't think I can live up to that
[25:00] statement there about being good with
[25:03] timelines and things like that but
[25:06] um
[25:08] certainly enjoy the message that we've
[25:11] been fellowshipping around the
[25:13] unchangeable god working in an
[25:15] unexpected
[25:16] way
[25:18] amen you enjoy that
[25:20] maybe maybe maybe just to to settle
[25:23] ourselves I'm I'm on a I'm on a a short
[25:27] leash here so I want to
[25:29] when the pastor gives you a time limit
[25:32] it's law to me I don't care how inspired
[25:36] You Think You Are
[25:38] you do not
[25:40] go over your time limit
[25:42] amen that's just that's just my heart's
[25:45] conviction so I'm going to start a
[25:47] stopwatch here
[25:51] and why don't we just stand
[25:53] because I think that would just make
[25:54] everybody feel a little bit more a more
[25:56] comfortable
[25:57] Lord we just ask your blessings upon
[26:00] this time lord as we would just say a
[26:02] few things and listen to your Prophet
[26:04] messenger Lord we thank you now ask it
[26:06] in your name Jesus Christ just open your
[26:08] Bibles will just read a very familiar
[26:10] scripture just to maybe have the order
[26:13] of the service a little more familiar to
[26:15] you we read Hebrews 13 8.
[26:18] how many are familiar with that
[26:20] scripture
[26:26] we all know it by heart
[26:29] so without even turning there I'm sure
[26:31] we could all read it together
[26:33] Hebrews chapter 13 verse 8 reads like
[26:36] this let's all read it together Jesus
[26:38] Christ the same yesterday today and
[26:41] forever amen you may have your seats uh
[26:44] just in this uh the message here the
[26:46] unchangeable god working in an
[26:48] unexpected way you know Jesus Christ is
[26:51] the same yesterday today and forever and
[26:54] you know I I'm reminded I believe in
[26:56] Matthew chapter 11. Jesus would pray
[26:59] this prayer he said Lord I thank you uh
[27:02] father I thank you that you have hidden
[27:04] these things from the wise and prudent
[27:06] but you've revealed them unto babes such
[27:09] as would learn and I I just the title of
[27:11] this message in itself is a paradox
[27:13] because he's saying it's the
[27:15] unchangeable god
[27:16] so he's unchangeable yet he's working in
[27:20] a way that's unexpected he's working in
[27:22] a time that's unexpected he's working in
[27:24] a place that's unexpected so this
[27:26] unchangeable God we know he changes his
[27:28] mask but he never changes his nature
[27:30] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:32] forever but yet it even though you might
[27:34] know his pattern you you might know the
[27:36] way he works it has to be a revelation
[27:38] because the theologians down Through the
[27:40] Ages have always been probing at the
[27:42] scriptures and and had their idea well
[27:44] this is how God is this is how he'll
[27:46] reveal himself this is how he's going to
[27:48] come but that unchangeable God whenever
[27:51] he goes to fulfill his word he goes
[27:53] right over the heads of the wise and
[27:55] prudent but God Reveals His word unto
[27:57] babes such as would learn and so just in
[28:00] thinking upon this message here I don't
[28:02] know why I'm ramping up because I'm not
[28:03] going to preach so I'm just going to
[28:06] slide right back down into the gear that
[28:08] I need to be in so I can honor my time
[28:11] limit but brother Brandon makes the
[28:13] statement he says you know he works in
[28:15] an unexpected time
[28:16] an unexpected place
[28:18] and an unexpected way
[28:21] and you know that's as as the I I wanted
[28:24] to refrain from even revisiting
[28:27] um the the the Bible stories that the
[28:31] prophet has gone through but he's moving
[28:33] towards something uh whenever you know
[28:35] the son of man Ministry what are we
[28:37] we're living in the time at the
[28:38] revealing of the son of man so whenever
[28:40] he's preaching about the Bible stories
[28:41] or the son of man ministry here on Earth
[28:43] and he's pointing out all of these
[28:45] examples he's moving to show you that
[28:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[28:49] forever and that there's a present uh
[28:52] truth that he's wanting you to catch now
[28:54] that the unchangeable God is working
[28:56] right now in an unexpected way in an
[28:59] unexpected place and an unexpected time
[29:02] and I would I would like to move your
[29:04] attention to uh brother Brandon would
[29:06] preach
[29:07] um in in a September 8 1962 he had
[29:12] preached present stage of my Ministry
[29:14] and he would start to talk about even in
[29:16] the very beginning of that message he
[29:18] would start to talk about how
[29:20] um that that it was some 30 years ago
[29:23] that I dedicated this this uh uh Church
[29:27] in 1933 and he's talking about that that
[29:30] um oh 150 yards from here on 7th street
[29:33] that it was that morning I had woke up
[29:36] and I had a vision and he starts to talk
[29:38] about how he had a vision of the
[29:40] Tabernacle and God took him took him up
[29:42] in the spirit and and placed him into a
[29:44] field and he would say that that
[29:46] Tabernacle is not your Pulpit but the
[29:48] world is your Tabernacle and it would be
[29:50] in that same year in 1933 that the uh
[29:52] you know he would dedicate the the
[29:54] Tabernacle there in 1933 and then uh
[29:57] later the pillar of fire would come down
[29:58] on the Ohio River and I would say as
[30:01] John the Baptist foreign the first
[30:03] coming of Jesus Christ so saw your
[30:05] ministry forerun the second coming of
[30:06] Christ and and I just you start to look
[30:08] back into the prophet's Ministry I I
[30:10] want to say that when the prophet was
[30:12] born there I believe in 1909 is that
[30:14] right uh in 1909 April uh something
[30:17] unexpected happened a light hung in the
[30:19] window
[30:20] amen it was an unexpected a a place and
[30:24] it was in an unexpected way that this
[30:26] light uh would hang in the window there
[30:28] and then a seven-year-old boy was
[30:30] walking down a pathway and all of a
[30:32] sudden the Whirlwind was found in an
[30:34] unexpected place
[30:36] and it spoke in an unexpected way and
[30:39] you you see all of these things uh uh
[30:41] start to to start to move forward that
[30:44] uh what would seem so unexpected it's
[30:46] God fulfilling prophecy what was the
[30:49] attraction on the mount it was it was
[30:51] God fulfilling prophecy and so when
[30:53] brother Branham starts to lay out this
[30:55] uh preaching present stage of my
[30:57] Ministry you know brother Branham
[30:59] traveled the world and he had great
[31:01] campaigns and healing campaigns and and
[31:04] people came in by the thousands and
[31:06] sometimes the hundreds of thousands in
[31:07] the meetings but yet brother Brandon
[31:09] would start to preach uh uh here in in a
[31:12] present stage of my Ministry because
[31:13] he's showing that my Ministry is now
[31:15] coming into a change and he would start
[31:18] to take uh the scripture in second
[31:20] Timothy there that he he pulled out of
[31:22] the Bible and and he ripped it out and
[31:24] he put it there in the Cornerstone and
[31:26] and he would say that that has now been
[31:29] fulfilled I fulfilled second Timothy uh
[31:32] uh uh the first five verses there it's
[31:34] now been fulfilled but now he's the
[31:35] first and second pool has been fulfilled
[31:37] but now he's saying I'm moving into the
[31:40] third pool of my Ministry something is
[31:42] taking place there's a change that is
[31:45] happening now in my Ministry and I've
[31:46] come to that place but he's saying and
[31:48] he starts to draw the type uh hopefully
[31:51] we're just we're just trying to you know
[31:53] this wasn't uh anyways I didn't have a
[31:56] way to maybe uh put it down and
[31:57] articulate much so we're just going to
[31:59] try to open up the fountain for a few
[32:00] minutes here and just just speak to you
[32:02] but he starts to talk about present
[32:04] stage of my Ministry and he's showing
[32:05] the type there and the parallel with
[32:07] Paul now think about Paul he he stood on
[32:10] a boat there and and there was an angel
[32:12] with him and he said look if everybody
[32:13] stays in this boat not one of you is
[32:15] going to perish and the boat come to a
[32:17] wreck and no man lasts their life and
[32:19] they come up on the island there and
[32:21] he's throwing wood into the fire and a
[32:22] Viper snatches on his hand he shakes it
[32:24] off in the fire and there was uh they
[32:27] was oh man this must be a God and then
[32:30] the man they wanted to kill all sudden
[32:31] they think he's a god he's holding a
[32:33] prayer line and people are being healed
[32:34] and Paul's Ministry went forth in power
[32:37] and demonstration and it was recognized
[32:40] by by the by the the disciples and it
[32:42] was recognized by the church this this
[32:44] great powerful Ministry but yet now as
[32:46] Paul has come down to what brother
[32:48] Brandon would call the crowning of his
[32:49] ministry he's now in Chains he's in
[32:52] bondage here Luke he has a nurse that's
[32:54] looking to care after him and it seems
[32:56] like now all of these demons has
[32:58] forsaken me he's now come to a place in
[33:00] time in his ministry where it would be
[33:02] unexpected that this would be a crowning
[33:05] time of his ministry and here I go
[33:06] preaching I'm sorry I try to ramp it
[33:08] back down because I got just a few more
[33:10] minutes but it would be unexpected here
[33:12] Paul this great mighty man who preached
[33:14] the gospel uh this wouldn't be the time
[33:16] for him to start writing the letters and
[33:18] the Very word that would be preparing a
[33:20] bride that I might might present you a
[33:22] Chase version uh to Jesus Christ but yet
[33:24] what was it it was now a crowning of his
[33:27] ministry and now brother Brandon is
[33:29] showing that here in 1962 there's coming
[33:31] a change in my ministry here I am in the
[33:34] Tabernacle I'm speaking to but but but
[33:36] just a few 200 people and coliseums have
[33:39] been fulfilled of a field and and doors
[33:42] were open and organizations were
[33:43] accepting them and oh there was such a
[33:45] mighty move but now the doors are
[33:46] closing they're all shutting they they
[33:48] they're not and it would be now he would
[33:51] say oh but it's in a time and if you
[33:53] could maybe bring a paragraph 114 there
[33:55] in present stage of my Ministry it's a
[33:58] profound uh statement but he would say
[34:00] so it is it's even true he says it's
[34:02] when men forsake men
[34:04] when men forsake men that God's servants
[34:06] stay true to his word that it's the
[34:09] crowning of their Ministry and here the
[34:12] prophet is saying that oh though
[34:13] everybody might leave though every my
[34:16] buddy might go away but now I'm coming
[34:18] into the crowning of of of of my
[34:21] Ministry what was it going forth why
[34:23] because he's now Christ he's setting up
[34:26] the breaking of those Seven Seals what
[34:28] is it as it was in the days of Noah so
[34:30] shall it be at the revealing of the son
[34:32] of man what's happening scripture now
[34:34] God is bringing the prophet to that
[34:36] final third pull the climax of his
[34:38] ministry the crowning of his ministry
[34:40] what's going to happen is God's going to
[34:43] break those Seven Seals those seven
[34:45] thundering Mysteries that that thundered
[34:47] their voices that God says seal it up
[34:49] for it won't be until the end time at
[34:52] the sounding of the seventh Angel's
[34:54] message when he begins to sound oh those
[34:56] great uh messages will be revealed now
[34:59] now every theologian
[35:02] everybody in the history is probing at
[35:05] how this is going to unfold
[35:07] but you want to talk about an unexpected
[35:10] place
[35:11] an unexpected time and an unexpected way
[35:14] a hillbilly
[35:15] born in Kentucky without proper grammar
[35:19] without an education but this was going
[35:22] to be the vehicle that God chose to mask
[35:25] himself in and break the Seven Seals
[35:28] where at is it going to be in Jerusalem
[35:30] is it is it going to be is it going to
[35:33] be back on Mount Moriah where is this
[35:35] great unfolding going to be is it going
[35:37] to be when the the word turns back to
[35:39] the Jews is it going to be in the great
[35:40] organizations is it going to be a Billy
[35:42] Graham is it going to be a Oral Roberts
[35:44] is it going to be some great man that
[35:45] that's garnered a great esteem from the
[35:49] organizations of Pentecost and the
[35:51] Baptists and Methodist and he's going to
[35:53] bring everybody together no
[35:55] no that that's not going to be the place
[35:57] that's not going to be the way that he's
[35:59] going to do that but I just want to draw
[36:01] your attention to now as we move uh move
[36:04] to uh God hiding himself in Simplicity
[36:06] brother Branham would preach that March
[36:09] 17th in the morning service and in
[36:11] paragraph four if maybe you could pull
[36:12] that up this is this is uh I I think
[36:16] it's just a beautiful way as we just uh
[36:19] about to uh turn it back over to our
[36:22] pastor to to recognize uh what is taking
[36:25] place because now uh the prophet took
[36:28] what was just a mud bed
[36:30] in Jeffersonville Indiana
[36:33] that people actually avoided because it
[36:36] was just a swamp an all stinky muddy
[36:39] swamp that even the road when it got to
[36:42] that point said we'll just go this way
[36:45] but just to think now that this this
[36:47] parcel of land that seemed to have no
[36:49] value I think it's amazing
[36:52] when God created the heavens and the
[36:54] Earth
[36:56] he had that little mud bed predestinated
[36:59] he said that's where I'm going to unfold
[37:02] the the the climax of my very plan of
[37:05] creation that I would that I would
[37:08] introduce a bride
[37:11] to the Lord Jesus Christ in the end time
[37:13] and he would say this in paragraph four
[37:16] it would read like this and uh God
[37:17] hiding himself in simplicity
[37:19] you say no matter uh where I'd ever roam
[37:22] this spot will always be sacred for
[37:25] about 30 years ago in a Muddy Pond bed I
[37:27] dedicated this piece of ground to Jesus
[37:29] Christ when it wasn't nothing but a mud
[37:31] bed
[37:34] this was all upon that's the reason the
[37:37] street is out of cater the road had to
[37:39] go around to get away from the pawn that
[37:41] was in here and in here there used to be
[37:43] Lily Pond lilies come up
[37:45] and the Lily is a very strange flower
[37:48] though it is born in the mud it has to
[37:50] press its way through the mud and then
[37:52] through the waters and the Slime to get
[37:54] itself to the top to show its beauty
[37:56] and I think this morning
[37:59] think about what morning this is
[38:01] now come
[38:03] to break the Seven Seals
[38:06] I think it's this I think this morning
[38:09] that that's a whole lot of what's
[38:11] happened here that's since that time oh
[38:14] an unexpected time an unexpected place
[38:17] in an unexpected way a little ponderly
[38:18] has pushed itself and when it got to the
[38:21] top of the water it spread its wings
[38:22] forth its little petals went out
[38:25] and it reflects reflected the lily of
[38:28] the valley
[38:29] May at long stand may it be a house
[38:31] fully dedicated to God and are the
[38:33] prophets going to move and he's going to
[38:35] dedicate
[38:37] the Tabernacle again he dedicated 30
[38:39] years ago but now they've done a remodel
[38:41] and it's fitting because now now think
[38:44] of the natural types the spiritual
[38:45] because here now the prophet is coming
[38:47] to fulfill that third pool the opening
[38:49] of the word who is those seals those
[38:51] seals is Christ Christ is the one that
[38:53] opened those seals where is he going to
[38:55] do it he's going to do it in a humble
[38:56] Kentuckian
[38:58] he's going to Veil himself in a man and
[39:01] he's in an unexpected place and he's
[39:03] going to to loose uh and reveal the
[39:06] Seven Seals
[39:08] but then he then you move on a couple
[39:10] paragraphs and he goes you know before I
[39:12] came out here he said I I just married a
[39:15] young couple he says it's a type
[39:17] why because now what is taking place now
[39:20] it's moving into the crowning of his
[39:22] ministry he's now dedicating a a bride
[39:25] he's now marrying what Behold the Lamb
[39:28] of God he's now in this mud bed in
[39:31] Jeffersonville Indiana there's something
[39:33] that's being performed if I could say it
[39:35] like this in a type of wedding ceremony
[39:37] is starting to happen why because it's
[39:39] an invisible Union between the the the
[39:41] the the the Earthly bride in the
[39:44] Heavenly bride room and in an unexpected
[39:46] place at an unexpected time in an
[39:49] unexpected uh vessel in an unexpected
[39:51] man the whole climax of a Christendom uh
[39:56] everything that everybody had been
[39:57] looking for what is it what is that what
[40:00] what was that picture we didn't know
[40:02] what it was about but what was it that's
[40:04] our Lord up there just turn it to the
[40:06] right now what is happening the seals
[40:08] the revelation of those seals are coming
[40:09] and when he preached the first seal he
[40:11] said oh I'd have made a great mistake
[40:12] but but who was there and Christ was
[40:15] there given the Revelation this
[40:17] Revelation didn't come come from a man
[40:19] this Revelation was Christ Paul said I
[40:21] didn't receive this of man I received
[40:23] this of Christ and now what we see
[40:25] revealed there in Jeffersonville Indiana
[40:27] it's revealing Christ and now that
[40:30] message that has been revealed has now
[40:31] come to an unexpected place
[40:33] because now that message has to take on
[40:35] your flesh
[40:37] unexpected place an unexpected time
[40:41] in an unexpected way
[40:47] [Applause]
[40:51] so we we see our our messenger uh in
[40:55] this message preparing
[40:58] the people
[41:00] for something that God's fixing to do
[41:03] and that's the reason that uh it came on
[41:07] my heart to play this message because
[41:10] Satan is making it seem
[41:13] that it's impossible for the word to God
[41:16] to come to pass
[41:18] that's the atmosphere and the
[41:21] environment that he's trying to create
[41:22] he's trying to put up insurmountable
[41:25] circumstances
[41:27] in our vision in our eyes
[41:31] and and and you know so we find out that
[41:35] and he's trying to let this set in all
[41:39] the denominations are turning against
[41:40] them all the doors are shutting down and
[41:43] God's fixing to do the greatest thing
[41:46] that has ever been accomplished in the
[41:50] word of God to this time
[41:54] can open those seals
[41:56] and like he's trying to get us this
[41:59] you're looking
[42:00] pre-pre the event how he's preparing us
[42:03] well if if this was something we had to
[42:07] look to pre the event of the seals how
[42:11] much more now are we sitting in the same
[42:13] circumstance about the rapture
[42:16] how are we going to figure it out how's
[42:18] it going to come to pass where is it
[42:21] going to be when's it going to be and
[42:23] he's telling us look it's an
[42:24] unchangeable God is going to work
[42:29] in an unexpected way
[42:32] you don't
[42:34] get
[42:35] don't let your anxiety
[42:38] blind you
[42:39] you know it's going to happen
[42:42] and so we know that God works in ways
[42:46] outside of the realms
[42:50] that we can comprehend
[42:53] let me say that again God's word and God
[42:59] works in ways outside of the realm we
[43:03] can comprehend
[43:04] and okay so as we pick it up uh we want
[43:09] to build our faith and uh so what what
[43:13] faith do we have to have
[43:16] rapturing faith
[43:18] We've Got to Believe
[43:20] that were part of the rapture
[43:23] and the Rapture is us we got to move
[43:25] from a wait and see I'll jump on it when
[43:29] it comes if he shows no right now
[43:33] do you have to believe that promise is
[43:36] yours
[43:38] and it's going to come a pass in your
[43:40] life in an unexpected way a way that's
[43:44] beyond you figuring it out
[43:48] but you figuring out
[43:51] is not part of the equation
[43:54] you just believe you're a part of it and
[43:57] God's going to bring it to pass in a way
[43:59] that's unexpected
[44:01] so you that could you have and before we
[44:03] continue the last 30 minutes that we're
[44:06] going to listen to listen to this
[44:08] statement this is paragraph
[44:10] 125 we're going to start on 126th
[44:14] no matter what the promise is
[44:19] okay don't matter
[44:22] are you promised a rapture
[44:25] yes you are I'll come again and receive
[44:28] you we'll be changing the twinkling of
[44:31] an eye in a moment we'll be caught up in
[44:33] the air with the Saints
[44:35] do you believe you're a part of it you
[44:37] believe that's your promise do you
[44:39] believe that your hope how's it going to
[44:42] come to pass
[44:44] I don't know
[44:46] but it'll be in a way
[44:48] that's going to be unexpected
[44:52] he says it's yours anyhow
[44:55] no matter what the promise is it's yours
[44:58] anyhow because God gave it to you
[45:08] whosoever will
[45:10] let him come and drink of the Fountain
[45:14] of the Water of Life freely it's yours
[45:19] it belongs to you
[45:22] any promise belongs to you if you have
[45:26] faith to appropriate it
[45:30] and it'll and it'll do it
[45:35] if you'll just believe it now let's pick
[45:39] up the rest and let's keep this and let
[45:42] your faith build because you're not
[45:44] looking of how it is you're just looking
[45:47] at the word that said it would come and
[45:50] you know it'll happen when it helps or
[45:53] if you ask for it you can have but it's
[45:55] going to come in an unexpected way let's
[45:58] finish this message this evening build
[46:00] your faith hold on to God no matter who
[46:03] you are where you are what you are what
[46:06] position in life are it's the word of
[46:09] God's been given to you to hang on to
[46:12] God bless you
[46:15] now
[46:17] but when Jesus came we found out he's
[46:20] born in a manger so right quick the Jews
[46:22] disagreed it didn't come the way he
[46:25] thought they thought he was to come so
[46:26] they just excommunicated him from their
[46:29] fellowship and he was no more in it but
[46:31] watch what he done he when he that
[46:33] didn't stop
[46:36] didn't stop when Pentecost was first
[46:37] born
[46:39] the church is excommunicated you
[46:42] that didn't stop the message right it
[46:45] goes on just the same
[46:49] Jesus can be stopped
[46:52] who can stop God
[46:55] man you can't do it
[46:56] no you could have more do it you could
[46:58] easier stop the Sun
[47:00] but you can't stop God his program's
[47:03] going to move on
[47:04] so it come when the churches back there
[47:06] was praying for a Revival it come in an
[47:08] unexpected way he got a bunch of some
[47:11] one-eyed colored man over here in
[47:13] California and a couple of hobos on the
[47:17] street and things like that and fill
[47:18] them with the Holy Ghost and start the
[47:20] fire there's look where it's gone to now
[47:21] man
[47:22] it's the fastest growing Church in the
[47:24] world
[47:25] they had more Converse last year and all
[47:27] the rest of them put together
[47:29] praise the Lord that's right our Sunday

[47:34] they registered a million five hundred
[47:36] thousands
[47:39] praise God
[47:41] Glory
[47:42] word sales oh
[47:46] yes people never take down their
[47:49] soldiers
[47:51] amen calls the word of the Living God is
[47:54] burning in their hearts man that's right
[47:56] God's sending them things in different
[47:58] places blessing him bringing them on now
[48:01] let's keep our in mind on the word and
[48:02] on God
[48:03] and keep moving on now don't get it off
[48:06] then I'm we're going to be the biggest
[48:07] grouper we got the best group in the
[48:09] town the best dress crowds comes to our
[48:11] place or something like that and if you
[48:13] get that on your mind you're falling
[48:14] right then
[48:16] yes sir just remember wherever the
[48:19] spirit is they're the living creatures
[48:22] and that's right
[48:24] stay with the spirit of God whatever you
[48:26] do stay with that Spirit now
[48:29] Jesus when he grew up he proved he was
[48:32] that Messiah that prayed for
[48:34] he showed them the his sign of Messiah
[48:38] he proved that he was Messiah
[48:41] by the signs that he did look at the
[48:43] woman at the well when he told her her
[48:45] sins that she had five husbands while
[48:48] she said sir we know when Messiah cometh
[48:51] he'll tell us all things but she didn't
[48:53] know who he was he said I'm he
[48:56] look at Nathanael when he came back
[48:59] with Philip and he walked up in the
[49:02] presence of Jesus and Jesus told him who
[49:04] he was
[49:05] where he come from what he been doing oh
[49:09] my God that proved he said rabbis are
[49:12] the Son of God Howard the king of Israel
[49:15] my sure because what he is proven
[49:20] he was he was the he was not a brought
[49:24] in the way that Israel thought he'd be
[49:25] issued in they thought he'd be a mighty
[49:27] king with a stick in his hand and go out
[49:29] and beat the Romans over the head with
[49:30] it but that wasn't God's way
[49:33] that wasn't even the scripture for him
[49:35] to do it and that coming the next coming
[49:36] is what he's going to do that they got
[49:38] the first and second coming mixed up
[49:40] together
[49:40] so he come then lowly meat setting on a
[49:43] mule riding in and you come out of a
[49:47] the smallest city amongst all the of the
[49:50] big provinces and all the scriptures
[49:52] just fulfilled of his coming the way you
[49:54] come but they fail to see it see but he
[49:57] did the Messiah sign prove that he was
[49:59] Messiah and they rejected it because he
[50:01] come in an unexpected way to them
[50:04] now if they had just been willing to
[50:07] accept him upon the basis that God sent
[50:10] him
[50:12] can we tonight as Pentecostal people
[50:15] except the Holy Ghost
[50:17] upon the basis of God sent it
[50:21] can we expect the Holy Spirit to do what
[50:24] God said it would do anything
[50:27] is that the basis we want to accept it
[50:29] up on or do we want to say oh I believe
[50:31] I receive the Holy Ghost when I believe
[50:34] I'll shook my pastor's hands and I tell
[50:36] you I believe I got the Holy Ghost
[50:38] that's not what the Bible said
[50:40] when he comes he'll testify of Me Jesus
[50:43] said see when he comes now how does he
[50:46] testify uh of of God he testifies it by
[50:49] the life that he lives in You by the
[50:51] fruits you are known you can say well
[50:53] brother Branham I got the Holy Ghost I
[50:55] spoke in tongues I believe that too but
[50:57] if that life don't follow that
[50:59] experience then there was something
[51:00] wrong see you got the wrong thing see
[51:03] but if you got if you got the real Holy
[51:06] Spirit and you spoke in tongues then the
[51:08] life follows it and then if you claim
[51:11] you've had the Holy Spirit and had the
[51:12] experience and then your life don't
[51:14] tally up to God's word then you got the
[51:16] wrong spirit because you can't gather
[51:19] grapes off of a a thistle you know that
[51:23] see and by their fruits they are known
[51:26] and Jesus when he come claiming he was a
[51:28] messiah
[51:29] he did the works of the Messiah
[51:32] amen
[51:34] said if I do not the works of my father
[51:36] then don't believe me that's right
[51:38] that's right but if I do the works of my
[51:39] father then believe the works
[51:42] what a statement
[51:44] same today
[51:46] as he promised in Hebrews 13 8 Jesus
[51:49] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[51:52] forever
[51:53] the denominations
[51:55] the great organizations of the world
[51:57] what do they expect when they see a
[51:59] Revival and break in the city what does
[52:02] the denominations expect a great
[52:05] intellectual speech
[52:07] he has to come by fine education
[52:11] swell words
[52:13] and uh Abel with a personality to get
[52:17] cooperation everywhere and uh everything
[52:21] like that in a great big program what do
[52:24] you do get to the altar a bunch of
[52:26] painted face Jezebels that never worship
[52:29] a bunch of cigarette smoking guys that
[52:32] claim to be Christians and they're never
[52:33] straighten your life still as crooked as
[52:35] a barrel of snakes you tell me that
[52:38] that's the Holy Spirit no sir the holy
[52:42] spirit is Holiness and power all the
[52:45] resurrection of Jesus Christ the Bible
[52:47] said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[52:49] today and forever
[52:51] amen
[52:52] that is true my brother not no slight
[52:55] but the what is it get a man up there
[52:58] might stammer a little bit and splutter
[53:00] a little bit in his language and
[53:01] misspell some words or mispronounce them
[53:03] and then they say ah there ain't nothing
[53:05] to that guy
[53:08] what about your Dwight Moody
[53:10] one of the greatest you've had since
[53:12] Charles Finney
[53:14] Drive what about Moody he hardly could
[53:17] read his name little old shoe cobbler
[53:19] one day over in his preaching to the cop
[53:22] and he's over in England and he tried to
[53:24] read the Bible he mispronounced it what
[53:27] you gotta think he'd call Philistines
[53:29] Philistines or something some guy
[53:31] worried he made it he went back half the
[53:33] verse he tried it again he thought he'd
[53:35] have time to try to spell it out he
[53:37] missed it again he went back and read
[53:39] the whole thing over and he missed it
[53:40] again
[53:41] close the Bible and he noted them
[53:43] companies were sitting there just it's
[53:45] got to be intellectual to them he closed
[53:47] the virus said Lord God I'll speak with
[53:49] the tongue that you sent me in it he was
[53:52] tore that face-to-face
[53:55] [Music]
[53:57] the tears rolled down his cheeks
[53:59] a newspaper comes to investigate to see
[54:02] why it's drawing so many people
[54:04] and the newspaper come and wrote up an
[54:06] article said why would anybody come to
[54:09] see Dwight Moody he said the first thing
[54:11] he's so homely to look at and so the
[54:14] next thing says he talks to his nose he
[54:16] asks how he hasn't got a good speech and
[54:19] said his grammar is a poor season to
[54:21] nothing and said he's a horrible to look
[54:24] at he's fat and round and whiskers all
[54:26] over his face oh they call him
[54:27] everything nearly his manager come up
[54:30] and said Mr Moody hears what the paper
[54:32] said about she read what it was Mr said
[54:34] why would anybody come to see Moody and
[54:36] Mr Moody just passed off once I said huh
[54:38] sure enough to come see the Lord
[54:40] they didn't come to if they're coming to
[54:42] see Dwight Moody that's different he has
[54:45] to be something to look at brother if
[54:47] you're coming for an intellectual speech
[54:49] that's what you're looking for that's
[54:51] what you expect but if you come to see
[54:53] the power and demonstrations of the Holy
[54:55] Ghost it'll take the power of God out of
[54:58] Heaven
[55:00] depends on what you're looking for what
[55:03] you're expecting not come to church I
[55:05] expect salvation I expect holy people I
[55:09] expect a cleaned up Bunch from a life of
[55:12] sin that's what you expect those that's
[55:15] what God requires but you see how we're
[55:18] letting down the bars oh brother
[55:19] Spurgeon an old Methodist Minister
[55:21] friend of mine used to preach on said we
[55:23] our talk saying about brother he said we
[55:25] lay down the bars we lay down the bars
[55:27] we compromise with sin we lay on the
[55:29] bars the Sheep got out but how did the
[55:31] goats get in letting down the bars right
[55:35] lay down the bar stay with the word God
[55:38] doesn't
[55:40] even get from this one who can
[55:42] not Jesus
[55:44] you are the same one that held the day
[55:47] of Pentecostals filled all the house for
[55:50] the Russian Mighty Wind and clothing
[55:51] tongues of fire set up on them and they
[55:54] were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:55] that's the same God that we look to see
[55:59] video depends on what you're looking for
[56:01] the infinite God
[56:03] I am God and I changed up
[56:06] he doesn't change he can't change
[56:08] if that's what he give those first
[56:10] expectants back there that's why to give
[56:12] the second expectance that's why to give
[56:14] the third fourth and everyone he calls
[56:16] will be the same name
[56:18] he said I am the vine you're the
[56:20] branches if a Vine puts forth a branch
[56:22] and it brings up grapes the next by or
[56:25] the next branch of that vine puts forth
[56:27] a bear grapes
[56:28] you can't make one by our pumpkins the
[56:30] other watermelons and then grapes you
[56:32] can't do it
[56:33] see it shows it's been cast it's a it's
[56:36] a Vine that's been drafted that's right
[56:38] there's some vinesville or some branch
[56:40] have been drafted into the Vine I was
[56:42] standing here one time with Brother John
[56:43] shared he showed me about about four or
[56:46] five different Citron fruits on a on the
[56:48] um
[56:49] a tree I believe it's pomegranates and
[56:52] and uh I know maybe I'm wrong there it
[56:55] was oranges lemons and tangerines and
[56:58] tangels and grapefruits all growing on a
[57:01] orange tree I said but Brothers John I
[57:04] want to ask you something when they come
[57:06] forth now put forth their bloods again I
[57:08] said is it all going to be oranges he
[57:10] said no each one of the branch each one
[57:12] of the little branches is cut off and
[57:14] put in this tree if it's a lemon tree if
[57:16] it's a lemon Branch it'll bear lemons
[57:18] I said but what if the original tree
[57:20] puts forth the other lamb said it Bears
[57:22] oranges you're right so brother we can
[57:25] bounce ourselves into organization
[57:27] that's all we got we bear organizational
[57:29] fruit
[57:30] s prepare organizational evidence but if
[57:33] you come forth in the vine it'll put you
[57:35] forth a new creature in Christ you'll
[57:37] bear The Life of Christ so help me you
[57:39] will
[57:40] you'll have the same experience they had
[57:43] in the beginning amen I know it's the
[57:45] truth the denominations look for the
[57:47] intellectuals the trouble we
[57:49] Pentecostals we look so much for Russian
[57:51] wind we miss the still small of all I
[57:53] think that's just what it is yes sir
[57:55] it's unexpected sometimes if it ain't
[57:58] got a steal Small Voice in it well uh
[58:00] has it in their way we don't want to be
[58:02] accepted sometimes our real good
[58:03] teaching sometimes it just cut us to
[58:05] pieces and Tony ruffle our feathers up a
[58:08] little bit you know sometimes that helps
[58:10] us a little bit you know that's true
[58:14] it's the truth yes there's something
[58:16] that'll help us do us good now Elijah
[58:19] heard Russian wins and he knew that was
[58:21] God out there or something going by
[58:23] heard it rains everything but what
[58:24] alarmed him was when he come in that
[58:26] still Small Voice you'd see you come in
[58:28] the rain and see him come in the fire
[58:29] even
[58:30] he heard the winds and heard the rain
[58:32] and heard the fire and seen the fire and
[58:34] all but he was alarmed when that still
[58:37] Small Voice came so he put a veil over
[58:39] his face and walked out oh brother
[58:41] that's it what we ought to do is listen
[58:43] way down deep in our heart that we hear
[58:47] the voice of God and walk out on it
[58:49] believe it is true yes sir
[58:52] ah but I wonder today brother if we are
[58:55] failing to recognize yet Among Us the
[58:58] Holy Spirit I wonder if the people in
[59:01] our attitudes today if we don't fail to
[59:03] recognize that this is the holy spirit
[59:06] see now I know to some of you strangers
[59:09] may be around in the camp tonight some
[59:12] people might live a life that you'd be
[59:13] ashamed to live yourself that may be
[59:15] true but my brother's sister they
[59:17] haven't got what they're talking about
[59:19] that's right that is true but don't you
[59:21] never judge for that when I went into
[59:23] India there was a man wanted to prove to
[59:24] me he could lay on spines one wanted to
[59:26] walk in fire I want to do all these
[59:28] things to show what he could do for a
[59:30] nickel or a dime or Penny whatever you
[59:32] give him but listen but he is playing
[59:34] the part of a hypocrite out there but
[59:36] way back in that interior with some
[59:38] honest person most absolutely doing that
[59:40] thinking they were sacrificing to a god
[59:42] somewhere but he was playing the part of
[59:43] a hypocrite we have the same thing it's
[59:46] exactly right some man women just a poor
[59:49] socologist tries to put on and act like
[59:51] they got the Holy Ghost and uh just
[59:53] cause the rest of them goes that way as
[59:54] I was telling you the other night when I
[59:56] first got in the Pulpit on I got up
[59:58] there and I watched Dr Davis preached
[1:00:00] and I just got exhort his license so I
[1:00:03] got up there and I thought it was saying
[1:00:04] you know what I can preach like that too
[1:00:06] so I got up there and swung my arms the
[1:00:08] same way he did and jumped up and down
[1:00:10] the same way he did and I was just
[1:00:11] saying hallelujah glory to God and
[1:00:13] Hallelujah glory to God and Hallelujah
[1:00:15] the glory to God and then first thing
[1:00:16] you know when it got out from there all
[1:00:18] the old women around said oh that was
[1:00:20] wonderful Billy but old Dr Davis sat
[1:00:22] there and oh law you looked at me like
[1:00:24] that I said how did you Dr Davis said
[1:00:26] rotten
[1:00:29] worst I ever heard
[1:00:32] oh my did he deflate me
[1:00:35] so I want you my study tomorrow
[1:00:37] afternoon at two o'clock I said oh hi Dr
[1:00:38] Davis I went in and all beat down you
[1:00:41] know he looked at me said I guess you
[1:00:42] feel like you never forgive me Billy I
[1:00:44] said no I want to know why he said when
[1:00:46] I first started practicing law he said
[1:00:48] I'll watch the lawyer and that's no
[1:00:50] doubt for what you've done to me watch
[1:00:51] me he said because I see you tried to go
[1:00:53] through every action that I went through
[1:00:55] he said but you know what so the reason
[1:00:57] I said the rightness I ever heard he
[1:00:59] said because you never brought a bit of
[1:01:00] the word of God you're just crying
[1:01:02] snorting and slobbering and carrying
[1:01:03] home and said I never said a thing about
[1:01:05] the word said and so on he said I got up
[1:01:08] there and tried to go through and
[1:01:09] pleading the divorce case and I said
[1:01:10] this poor little woman
[1:01:12] poor little woman when I like answered
[1:01:15] an old attorney set across there and
[1:01:16] looked like that for about a half hour I
[1:01:18] got through beating and crying I was out
[1:01:19] of voice really said the old attorney
[1:01:21] said judge your honor how much more of
[1:01:23] this nonsense will your court stand
[1:01:26] he said I said I went to the old
[1:01:28] attorney and he told me he said you know
[1:01:30] what you were making a lot of noise and
[1:01:33] everything you're you are that all right
[1:01:34] but said you wasn't bringing any of the
[1:01:36] law out it takes the law to defeat the
[1:01:38] case
[1:01:39] brother that's what I think tonight too
[1:01:41] it's got to be the same thing brother no
[1:01:44] matter how much education intellectual
[1:01:46] and whatever more we got there's got to
[1:01:47] be some power and demonstration of the
[1:01:50] Holy Ghost recruit that it is God that
[1:01:52] will speak up your life that'll perform
[1:01:54] and do the same life that Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] did amen
[1:02:00] promised in the last days that he'd
[1:02:03] it'd be light in the evening time the
[1:02:06] prophet promised that we notice the
[1:02:08] light geographically rises in the East
[1:02:10] and sets in the West
[1:02:11] and the same Sun that rises the East is
[1:02:14] the same Sun that sets in the West
[1:02:16] we know that's true
[1:02:18] now
[1:02:19] why did civilization start in the east
[1:02:23] that's right it's travel with the sun
[1:02:25] and now it's at the West Coast it goes
[1:02:27] any further it'll come back East again
[1:02:30] the East and West has met
[1:02:32] civilization
[1:02:33] we want you to notice this just a minute
[1:02:35] now remember the prophet said there will
[1:02:38] be a day that will not be light or dark
[1:02:40] a dismal league but in the evening time
[1:02:43] shall be light
[1:02:45] now I notice it shall be light in the
[1:02:47] evening time
[1:02:49] now the Son of God shined his
[1:02:52] righteousness and power upon the Eastern
[1:02:54] people about 1900 years ago
[1:02:57] and there's come a span of time that
[1:02:59] we've had intellectual teachings we've
[1:03:01] had a great time we've made
[1:03:03] organizations we have done great work
[1:03:05] which is science it's just a dismal day
[1:03:07] I don't guess you get them here in
[1:03:08] Phoenix but in the East we get them kind
[1:03:10] of Cloudy enough light to get around but
[1:03:12] the sun isn't shining some words shining
[1:03:14] of course you it wouldn't be light if it
[1:03:16] wasn't shining but it's not exactly the
[1:03:18] good sunlight but then in the evening
[1:03:20] time the clouds roll back in the same
[1:03:23] Sun that shines in the East is shining
[1:03:24] in the West
[1:03:26] then the same Jesus the Same holy ghost
[1:03:29] that fell back on the Eastern people has
[1:03:31] come down through the day of
[1:03:32] organization that's dropped down here in
[1:03:34] the last days to shine the light upon
[1:03:36] the Western Horizon
[1:03:38] the same Jesus the same thing
[1:03:42] the same loving one he's sure tonight in
[1:03:45] the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:47] comes he's he's the unchangeable God you
[1:03:51] just can't be changed no he comes in
[1:03:54] unexpected ways working and wonders
[1:03:58] different ways his wonders to perform
[1:04:00] mysterious ways brother his wonders to
[1:04:03] perform but remember
[1:04:07] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:04:10] Sodom
[1:04:11] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:04:14] of man
[1:04:16] no one can doubt that but what he said
[1:04:19] as it was in Sodom
[1:04:22] now in Sodom that was just before the
[1:04:25] fire fell and burn up Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:04:28] and now we're just before striking that
[1:04:30] Midnight Hour
[1:04:32] for the second coming of Christ and the
[1:04:34] world to be destroyed by fire
[1:04:36] what happened there was three classes of
[1:04:39] people in that day
[1:04:40] and there are three classes of people
[1:04:42] today
[1:04:43] first there was a sodomite the world
[1:04:46] there was lot in his people the church
[1:04:48] formal intellectual type and there was
[1:04:51] Abraham and his group
[1:04:53] Abraham and his group sitting up there
[1:04:56] they elected and called out Church
[1:05:01] remember
[1:05:02] now there was three groups the sodomites
[1:05:07] sinful Wicked world like today there was
[1:05:11] a church member lukewarm Cole lost his
[1:05:15] group there was Abraham the called out
[1:05:18] of it was sitting out here in the desert
[1:05:20] taking the hard thing
[1:05:21] right and the Lord came down in a form
[1:05:26] of a man
[1:05:27] the speaker of these three angels that
[1:05:30] stood now someone asked me said brother
[1:05:33] Branham you don't believe that was God I
[1:05:35] said it was God
[1:05:37] they call us now listen Abraham called
[1:05:39] him capital l-o-r-d and any scholar
[1:05:42] knows that that's capital L O R D is
[1:05:44] Elohim which is God he said well how
[1:05:47] would he ever I said he said God eaten I
[1:05:50] said sure I said God just read sure we
[1:05:53] got a handful of uh cosmolite and
[1:05:56] whatever more we had to get together
[1:05:58] some petroleum and Cosmic light and and
[1:06:01] some calcium and potassium step in there
[1:06:03] Gabriel
[1:06:05] step in that Michael and stepped into it
[1:06:09] himself
[1:06:10] he's God
[1:06:11] you fail to see who he is he's the
[1:06:13] unchanging God I'm glad I've got faith
[1:06:16] in him tonight that someday when my life
[1:06:18] my body with his 16 elements so be back
[1:06:21] in the dusty Earth but he'll say William
[1:06:22] Branham and I'll come forth
[1:06:25] free of the breath of life and do it
[1:06:27] today
[1:06:28] you'll bypass the birth of to my mother
[1:06:31] and so forth like Jesus on his first
[1:06:33] miracle he turned water into wine
[1:06:35] eventually it would have been wine but
[1:06:37] he bypassed all that procedure and said
[1:06:39] turn the water to wine at the
[1:06:41] resurrection you'll not see Mr Miss
[1:06:43] Brown get married again and bring forth
[1:06:44] William you'll speak and I'll come
[1:06:46] forward
[1:06:47] that's him he's gone sure he did walk
[1:06:51] down there before Abraham and watch what
[1:06:53] he did now
[1:06:55] remember they was going down two of the
[1:06:57] angels went down and preached in Sodom
[1:06:59] is that right they had a meeting down
[1:07:02] there but what did they didn't perform
[1:07:04] too many uh Miracles but what did they
[1:07:06] do they smote them sodomites blind and
[1:07:10] now we've got them same Angels preaching
[1:07:12] to the church Farmall today of Billy
[1:07:14] Graham and so forth
[1:07:16] and what this blind world is the word
[1:07:20] and preaching the word is a blind the
[1:07:23] unbeliever
[1:07:25] but watch this elected called out church
[1:07:28] this angel that spoke there to Abraham
[1:07:32] he's not remember his name had been
[1:07:34] Abram until just a few days before
[1:07:37] and his wife's name have been Sarah
[1:07:39] s-a-r-r-a
[1:07:42] but he God had met Abraham in a spirit
[1:07:45] form and it changed his name from Abram
[1:07:48] that Abraham
[1:07:51] from Sarah to Sarah
[1:07:53] I now watch this angel
[1:07:55] dust on his clothes
[1:07:57] and he said Abraham
[1:08:01] where is your wife Sarah
[1:08:06] I wonder Abraham must have said
[1:08:08] uh my leading was right I just felt
[1:08:11] something that fellow was different
[1:08:14] he said he said she's a tent it's behind
[1:08:16] you there how do you know he had a wife
[1:08:20] how do you know what his name had been
[1:08:21] changed how do you know that she uh uh
[1:08:25] these conditions said I'm going to visit
[1:08:26] you according to the time of life
[1:08:28] how do you even know Abraham was married
[1:08:31] where is thy wife Sarah he said no watch
[1:08:34] I have that personal pronoun there I'm
[1:08:36] going to visit you according to the time
[1:08:38] of life you see who it was
[1:08:41] you see who it was and he said um and
[1:08:45] Sarah in the tent said how can I she
[1:08:48] laughed in other words little snickery
[1:08:50] will fall self said now look how can I
[1:08:53] have pleasure again Abraham was 100
[1:08:55] years old and the Bible plainly speaks
[1:08:58] it out there now that there were both
[1:09:00] well or old in age
[1:09:03] and the way of Sarah had been gone for a
[1:09:06] long time Abraham his body as good as
[1:09:08] dead and her womb have been dried up and
[1:09:10] dead for years
[1:09:12] I'm going to visit you according to
[1:09:14] lifetime of life and you're going to
[1:09:15] bring this song
[1:09:17] I noticed foreclosing
[1:09:20] and Sarah laughed at how could that ever
[1:09:22] be me as old as I am have pleasure again
[1:09:26] and my Lord also I notice that's the
[1:09:28] little L there Lord Abraham him being
[1:09:31] old also and the angel said why did
[1:09:34] Sarah last
[1:09:36] oh my
[1:09:38] God I remember Jesus said as it was in
[1:09:43] the days of Noah
[1:09:44] and in the days of Sodom
[1:09:47] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:09:49] of man what is it it's God the Holy
[1:09:53] Spirit
[1:09:54] dwelling among human flesh in these
[1:09:58] Sanctified vessels that the son of God's
[1:10:00] blood cleansed by faith and God dwelling
[1:10:04] in these vessels performing and carrying
[1:10:07] on the works of Jesus Christ making him
[1:10:09] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:12] if we are baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:10:14] into the body then we become the body of
[1:10:16] Christ then we're resurrected with him
[1:10:19] when he raised up we raise up also in
[1:10:22] the resurrection with him because he is
[1:10:24] the head and the head and the bodies
[1:10:25] together
[1:10:26] then today Christ is in the church in
[1:10:30] you
[1:10:31] and his works that he once did Saint
[1:10:34] John 14 12 he that believeth on me the
[1:10:37] works that I do shall he do also amen
[1:10:42] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:10:44] yesterday today and forever
[1:10:47] see there
[1:10:49] people don't expect it to be that way
[1:10:51] they expect this to be a bunch of uh
[1:10:52] literary people don't even know what
[1:10:54] they're talking about they believe it to
[1:10:56] be some a bunch of dummies
[1:10:58] well we we might be in the sense that
[1:11:00] they're talking about
[1:11:02] but we accepted the Holy Ghost the way
[1:11:04] God poured it out and got the same
[1:11:06] results that they had back there so it
[1:11:08] proved
[1:11:09] he's the unchangeable god
[1:11:14] we get the same result
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:17] my old mother when she was dying she
[1:11:20] said Billy you've been I baptized her
[1:11:22] many years ago she said you've been kind
[1:11:24] of a spiritual God to me Billy I said
[1:11:26] mother you know our people are Catholic
[1:11:28] now I said when I first know that God
[1:11:31] was the god I noted all my life from a
[1:11:33] little boy but a lot of people never
[1:11:36] went to church and I went out and talked
[1:11:37] to the priests and he said this is a
[1:11:39] church this is a way I said well the
[1:11:41] Bible could I said now you get all
[1:11:43] confused see this is the church God is
[1:11:46] in his church you must believe the
[1:11:47] church well I went over to the lutherans
[1:11:49] and they said we are the church we're
[1:11:51] the body Believers one of the methodists
[1:11:53] to say we're the body believers and went
[1:11:55] to baptist they said oh they're all
[1:11:57] wrong we hear that
[1:11:58] I thought what is going on here a church
[1:12:01] is a body of people and this one says
[1:12:04] this way this and says this way and this
[1:12:05] way and that way and that way
[1:12:06] something's got to be wrong
[1:12:08] so I said I went right back to the Bible
[1:12:10] mama
[1:12:11] and read just exactly what that first
[1:12:13] church did
[1:12:15] and the way they did it that's the way I
[1:12:17] did it too and got the same results it's
[1:12:20] gone that's good enough for me as long
[1:12:22] as I got the same results I see the same
[1:12:24] Jesus I see the same God that worked in
[1:12:27] the Old Testament in the New Testament
[1:12:28] down the pre Nicene Council he worked in
[1:12:31] there until the coming of the Roman
[1:12:32] Catholic Church that accepted dogmas
[1:12:34] instead of the Bible went out through
[1:12:36] the Dark Ages and come back through
[1:12:38] Luther Wesley and down here and the lady
[1:12:40] was seeing Church agents I'll be like in
[1:12:42] the evening time God will pull out a
[1:12:44] church
[1:12:46] there will be and seeing the same Holy
[1:12:48] Ghost by the same promises doing the
[1:12:50] same works and the same things blessed
[1:12:53] be the name of the Lord r the
[1:12:56] unchangeable god
[1:12:59] amen or give you the same holy ghost
[1:13:01] that he gave them there without a change
[1:13:05] he'll do the same things that he did
[1:13:07] when he was sure on Earth that any man
[1:13:09] or woman that'll believe it and accept
[1:13:12] it if you've got the Holy Ghost take a
[1:13:14] hold of it like Jacob did and hold to it
[1:13:18] until positive results come
[1:13:21] amen believe it for him
[1:13:24] and at a unexpected time
[1:13:27] and maybe an unexpected place
[1:13:29] but if he'll do it at an unexpected
[1:13:31] Place how much more should he do it
[1:13:33] tonight in an expected place where we're
[1:13:35] expecting this didn't happen
[1:13:37] it's bow our heads just a moment
[1:13:45] while your heads are bound
[1:13:47] and I trust that your hearts are bowed
[1:13:49] too
[1:13:52] this scares me for keeping as long as I
[1:13:54] have till nine o'clock
[1:13:58] but I'd like to ask you this question
[1:13:59] you know we may never meet again
[1:14:04] daylight may never come in the morning
[1:14:05] for some of us
[1:14:08] and if it would be so that we'd never
[1:14:11] see another break of days
[1:14:13] would we meet again beyond the river
[1:14:15] would there have you the peace and the
[1:14:19] in your heart and the assurance
[1:14:23] a scriptural assurance that these people
[1:14:26] have talked about tonight that when you
[1:14:28] met God
[1:14:30] you had a scriptural experience
[1:14:34] God changed your life completely
[1:14:37] and now you're not just the same person
[1:14:39] just rebuilt polished over but you are a
[1:14:42] new creature
[1:14:44] a new creation in Christ
[1:14:48] if you're not that way
[1:14:50] we have no
[1:14:51] standing at the altar room but I'd like
[1:14:54] to ask your sincerity if you would
[1:14:56] desire that I'd offer prayer for you
[1:14:58] here from the pulpit knowing it someday
[1:15:01] I'll have to meet you again and meet my
[1:15:02] words that I've said tonight would you
[1:15:04] with all with their heads about in the
[1:15:06] eyes closed would you just raise your
[1:15:08] hand and signify with that pray for me
[1:15:10] brother and I I I want to be that way
[1:15:14] God bless you and bless you bless you
[1:15:16] young lady God bless you outside
[1:15:19] anywhere put your hands against the
[1:15:21] windows wherever it is God will be just
[1:15:24] raise up your hand and deem sincerity
[1:15:26] and say God be merciful to me I I have
[1:15:30] always wanted to be that way brother
[1:15:31] Branham but somehow another I've just
[1:15:33] never been able to get that oh precious
[1:15:35] friend won't you take a hold of
[1:15:37] something believe me as his servant
[1:15:40] the holy spirit is right
[1:15:43] don't let no one ever talk you away from
[1:15:45] it hold to God's unchanging hand
[1:15:47] Christian friend if you've just joined
[1:15:50] church if you've just been baptized and
[1:15:53] water and having yet been baptized with
[1:15:55] the Holy Spirit
[1:15:58] you've never been actually regenerated
[1:16:01] now you say brother Branham I I spoke
[1:16:04] with tongues I I did this or did that
[1:16:06] now I believe in that too I told you but
[1:16:08] remember you could dance in the spirit
[1:16:10] you could speak with tongues I've seen
[1:16:12] the Hindus do that I've seen Witch
[1:16:14] Doctors speak in tongues interpret it
[1:16:15] and I've heard I went into a camp on
[1:16:18] time where there's some brothers went in
[1:16:19] there and seen a table tap out in
[1:16:21] tongues and a pencil will come and write
[1:16:22] none knowing tongues and then read it
[1:16:24] all see all those things that's that
[1:16:26] could be the devil but brother if you do
[1:16:28] speak with tongues and then you continue
[1:16:31] to live the life that you once lived
[1:16:33] then there's something wrong with your
[1:16:34] experience
[1:16:37] if you have got that just the only thing
[1:16:40] you're leaning up on is speaking with
[1:16:42] tongues don't you try that
[1:16:45] you'll go over the falls and that boat
[1:16:47] will never stand up to it but with a
[1:16:49] poor Larry's tongue they shall cease
[1:16:51] where there is prophecies that shall
[1:16:53] fail but when that which is perfect has
[1:16:55] come all that love of God so rich and
[1:16:58] pure fabulous and strong then these
[1:17:01] other gifts will work right in with it
[1:17:02] see that's gifts of the holy spirit
[1:17:04] that's given to you speaking in tongues
[1:17:07] prophesying and what more
[1:17:08] interpretations that's to edify the
[1:17:11] church for the edification of the body
[1:17:13] but first receive the holy ghost that
[1:17:16] you see that your life has changed now
[1:17:17] it's been about eight or ten hands grew
[1:17:19] up since I've been talking would there
[1:17:20] be another before all for prayer God
[1:17:22] bless you lady well God bless you Sister
[1:17:24] will there be someone else just put up
[1:17:26] your hand say and deem sincerity brother
[1:17:28] Brandon remember me God bless you there
[1:17:29] brother someone else just say pray for
[1:17:32] me I can only pray for you my friend God
[1:17:34] bless you lady and God bless you their
[1:17:36] sister now he sees your hand
[1:17:39] remember Jesus said he that heareth my
[1:17:42] words believeth on him it sent me has
[1:17:46] everlasting life
[1:17:48] and shall not come into condemnation
[1:17:51] but has passed from Death unto lion
[1:17:56] we must believe that with all our heart
[1:18:00] just believe it with all that's in you
[1:18:02] and God shall take care of the rest
[1:18:08] Heavenly Father we now give this little
[1:18:10] audience to you these broke up nervous
[1:18:14] spoken words tonight Lord standing here
[1:18:16] with a feeling of those people standing
[1:18:18] there their Liam's aching

[1:18:31] what little seed was in it father sow it
[1:18:34] in the hearts of them people
[1:18:37] and I claim their soul
[1:18:39] that it shall not be lost yes Lord
[1:18:42] but it will appear under that day at the
[1:18:45] resurrection
[1:18:49] our God
[1:18:52] there's no other God but you
[1:18:54] the heathens has images
[1:18:57] we have a living God the only true
[1:19:00] Living God
[1:19:01] we can think of you father setting out
[1:19:03] on eternity Millions times brighter than
[1:19:06] a 10 billion Sun

[1:19:12] the worlds
[1:19:14] but their great solar system in the
[1:19:16] skies and then come down to save a
[1:19:20] sinner
[1:19:21] interested enough to be here in this
[1:19:23] little Tabernacle tonight with these
[1:19:24] Christian people
[1:19:25] or Jesus give us the word that wherever
[1:19:28] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:19:29] I'll be in their myth
[1:19:31] now say these people father that's all I
[1:19:34] know to ask you I believe that you'll
[1:19:36] answer my prayers
[1:19:37] and I pray that tomorrow they'll be
[1:19:39] right at the church and ready for
[1:19:40] baptism even yet tonight if they've
[1:19:42] never been baptized I pray that you'll
[1:19:45] fill them with the Holy Ghost let them
[1:19:46] hold on to this real truth of God until
[1:19:49] Death Shall Set them free in Jesus name
[1:19:52] I pray amen
[1:19:56] foreign
[1:19:59] ly hope tonight that this message
[1:20:03] encouraged you
[1:20:05] to be sincere
[1:20:07] and if you have any questions in your
[1:20:10] heart or your mind about whether you
[1:20:13] have the Holy Spirit
[1:20:15] I think that there's a couple statements
[1:20:18] I'd like to say
[1:20:20] it says we what we ought to do is to
[1:20:23] listen way down deep in your heart
[1:20:27] till we hear the voice of God
[1:20:29] then walk out on it believe
[1:20:34] it is true
[1:20:35] yes sir
[1:20:37] until that really that questions settled
[1:20:40] way down in your heart
[1:20:42] and he says
[1:20:45] well your heads are bowed and I trust
[1:20:47] that your hearts are about to
[1:20:51] excuse me for keeping you as long as I
[1:20:54] have till nine o'clock
[1:20:56] but I'd like to ask you this question
[1:20:59] you know
[1:21:01] we may never meet again daylight may
[1:21:05] never come in the morning first home of
[1:21:09] us
[1:21:09] and if we would be so
[1:21:13] that would never see another break of
[1:21:16] day
[1:21:17] would we meet again Yonder at the river
[1:21:23] would there
[1:21:24] have you the peace
[1:21:28] and in your heart
[1:21:30] and the assurance
[1:21:33] a scriptural Assurance as these people
[1:21:36] that I've talked about tonight
[1:21:38] that went to meet God
[1:21:41] you had a scriptural experience
[1:21:44] God changed your life completely
[1:21:47] and now you're not just the same person
[1:21:51] just rebuilt or polished over
[1:21:55] but you are a new creature
[1:21:58] a new creation in Christ Jesus
[1:22:01] if you're not that way
[1:22:05] and and you know it's not something that
[1:22:09] can be answered anyplace else
[1:22:12] but within your own heart
[1:22:14] he said if you desire it
[1:22:17] then ask for it
[1:22:19] stay there
[1:22:21] and tell you're assured it he says it's
[1:22:27] it's not the rushing wind
[1:22:30] is this still small boy
[1:22:32] Act and the experience is still the same
[1:22:35] God changes lives
[1:22:38] he's still cast out Devils he still
[1:22:42] delivers he still does everything he's
[1:22:44] he's unchanging
[1:22:46] he can work in unexpected ways and he
[1:22:50] can work in unexpected people
[1:22:53] he can feel it
[1:22:55] all of us any of us any person here
[1:22:59] with the spirit of God
[1:23:01] but we never want to lean so much to the
[1:23:04] intellectual side that it's just the
[1:23:07] intellectual conception of the message
[1:23:09] the message was Jesus Christ born
[1:23:13] in our hearts and the hour we're living
[1:23:17] in a lot of counterfeit that we have to
[1:23:20] fight our way through
[1:23:22] but we can't be fools to compare
[1:23:24] ourselves one with another is something
[1:23:27] we all have got to make sure in our
[1:23:29] heart
[1:23:30] and it's got to be a desire of your
[1:23:33] heart
[1:23:34] and it's the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:23:38] is so individual
[1:23:41] that it can't be compared to anybody
[1:23:43] else's experience it's your baptism
[1:23:47] it's your birth it's your marriage it's
[1:23:52] your union with him
[1:23:55] and if it's something that we can't
[1:23:59] Tarry
[1:24:01] any longer
[1:24:03] to make sure
[1:24:05] we've got to make sure
[1:24:07] and I felt we saw the message so
[1:24:11] beautifully laid out and how The
[1:24:14] Messengers reached out
[1:24:16] for the elect because the elect is going
[1:24:20] to receive this birth
[1:24:22] going to receive this baptism
[1:24:24] and they're going to have these signs
[1:24:26] and wonders
[1:24:27] following individually and and I hope
[1:24:31] tonight that that
[1:24:34] um
[1:24:35] that we never
[1:24:38] let the message
[1:24:40] as
[1:24:41] the word of God
[1:24:44] seeing it
[1:24:46] and recognizing it and knowing its truth
[1:24:50] become a substitute
[1:24:52] for our own birth experience
[1:24:55] and like I said you can't compare it to
[1:24:58] anybody else you've got to know that
[1:25:01] something in your heart has changed you
[1:25:03] and if you desire that
[1:25:06] if you're calling for it in no wise will
[1:25:10] he turn you away he said it's whosoever
[1:25:13] will come drink from the rivers of Life
[1:25:16] freely I invite you to invite the Holy
[1:25:20] Spirit
[1:25:21] into your life God bless you let's stand
[1:25:24] together this evening
[1:25:27] our musicians will come
[1:25:34] I know the messenger made an altar call
[1:25:37] and and I hope you responded as I did
[1:25:40] for the need you have
[1:25:42] but we just like to give you an
[1:25:44] opportunity once again you play God's
[1:25:47] unchanging hand
[1:25:49] and
[1:25:51] to just excuse
[1:25:53] but
[1:25:54] if you're not
[1:25:57] sure you have the Holy Spirit
[1:26:00] you might have it and not be sure
[1:26:04] because it's such a mental battle
[1:26:08] but if if you know that you don't have
[1:26:11] it and you say Lord I believe the
[1:26:13] message
[1:26:14] I believe God sent a prophet I believe
[1:26:16] everything I hear him say
[1:26:19] but I just haven't had that scriptural
[1:26:22] experience
[1:26:24] Lord where I've been changed and
[1:26:27] and you'd like to lift your hands up and
[1:26:29] say Lord
[1:26:31] would you
[1:26:33] come by in my life
[1:26:36] it might be an unexpected way I'm not
[1:26:40] trying to produce any way that it'll be
[1:26:43] I want you to do it
[1:26:46] but I want to have this experience
[1:26:50] I want to
[1:26:51] have it settled in my heart forever
[1:26:55] that I have the spirit of life
[1:26:58] and Truth
[1:27:01] and I want to know it surely father not
[1:27:04] to anybody else around me
[1:27:07] not any evidence Lord but that personal
[1:27:10] evidence of you giving me your spirit
[1:27:14] in changing my life and you'd like to
[1:27:17] lift your hand to him to say say Lord I
[1:27:20] really want that baptism
[1:27:22] I really want the question answered
[1:27:24] forever in my heart
[1:27:28] I want it to be so deeply rooted I'll
[1:27:30] Never Be Shaken from it even if I fail
[1:27:34] if I sin if I fall
[1:27:36] Lord I know that spirit will rise me up
[1:27:39] because I know I received it from a gift
[1:27:42] from you
[1:27:43] if you would like to do that tonight and
[1:27:46] ask it
[1:27:47] and if you ask it be leaving and no
[1:27:50] wisely turn you out
[1:27:52] but you may the way it just said in your
[1:27:54] heart and may you continually to reach
[1:27:58] out
