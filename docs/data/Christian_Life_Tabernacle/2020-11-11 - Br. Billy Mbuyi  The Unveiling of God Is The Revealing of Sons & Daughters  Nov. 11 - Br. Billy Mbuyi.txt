Lord that's the desire of every believer that we could just praise you all day long Lord praise you when we work upen praise you when we go out father that our very life may just be a praise unto your name and the things that you have done Lord we so fortunate to be gathered in your presence in your house Lord I know we say that often times but the hours coming where we can even within our own selves come to that realization that we are very fortunate group of people and we ask tonight father that you may speak to us through your word Lord we have come with desires and needs within our heart and Lord we believe that the god who's called us the god who's placed us at this place and who made a way that we could be gathered tonight that he has in his word a promise that if we believe it that he would come and bring his word to come to pass in our lives Lord for every need that's represented in this room Lord I know that you are the creator of Heaven and Earth and there's nothing that escapes you I pray that you come and you answer to every need oh God and as the word Goes Forth father that it may that you may just so become so big that our problems will just become so little and ins insignificant that we may just realize in whose pres presence we are standing and all our needs will be answered because because you are the creator of Heaven and Earth speak to us through your word for we have need of it we commit everything to your hands Lord I pray that you just touch my lips even tonight Lord to just put your words in my mouth Lord that I may speak only what you would like for me to speak father that our ears may only hear your word and nothing else we commit everything we are to you and ask it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so good to be gathered in the house of God Amen let's just open our Bibles certainly want to welcome everyone uh who's here those that are home streaming we welcome you to in the presence of the Lord and pray that uh something will be said tonight that will be of help to all of us amen uh let's turn our Bibles let's open to uh Romans chapter uh 8 a very familiar scripture reading we're going to start from verse 14 Romans 8 and4 it says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again for fear but ye have received the spirit of the adoption where where we cry whereby we cry ABA father it said the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS of God and join air with Jesus if so be that this that we suffer with him and we shall that we may be also glorified together it says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of of of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but the reason of him who had subjected the same in hope now I want you to realize what it said the creature was made subject to vanity not by his own will but that's how it was made it says because the the the create the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God and I so like this I I'll just Paul is continually just reminding us the children of God the children of God the children of God it said for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now not only only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we also grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body he said for we are saved by hope but hope that is not seen is not hope for what a man seeth why did where why do does he hope for for if we hope for what we see we see not then we do with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helped our infirmities for we know for we know not what we should pray for as we ought as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and then he says and we know that all things work together for good for them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for new he also did he predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son and that he might be the first Mo be be the firstborn among many Brethren it says moreover whom did he he did predestinate them he also call whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorify what shall we say of these things if God be for us who could be against us let's also turn to one more scripture reading in Philippians uh chapter 2 chapter 2 he says if there be if there if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit any bows of Mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love uh being of one Accord and one mind let not let not let nothing be done through strive of in glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own thing on his own things but every man on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus whom being in a form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every that the name of Jesus every knee should bow all things in heaven and things on earth and things under the Earth and that every Tong should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father father we ask you bless your word to us we commit ourselves to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you may have your seats amen we'll try not to be too long tonight but am man just have a a little thought in on our mind and we'll give you the title as we move along um I was just thinking about some of the things that our pastor has been talking about um even about the time that we're living in and what uh a time where a faithless generation like the scriptures calls it a faithless generation where man is rejected faith and embraced uh science and and you begin to look uh we can uh look at the Bible and we know but bham says often and and and so many times it would say that you know if I was asked in what age I would live in this is the age and this is the age and yet we sit here we look at the wickedness that's around us we look at just the confusion and all those things and and and what we need to come to the realization is uh uh to an unbeliever this is scary this is the scariest condition that you can ever be that's why people are Marching and and fighting and all kinds of things because this that's all they have but to the believer it's a glorious time because it's a glorious time because this is the Fulfillment of scripture this is the Fulfillment of Prophecy we can look at the world's condition and come together tonight and say that we can look outside and say that today this scripture is fulfilled and everything that's playing out there everything that we look out there that's happening it's happening exactly according to the prophecy that was given at the end time if you think about people and and and and the nature and and the way people are acting and I was talking about David uh the other day I said I was so amazed even as you was reading those things I was following uh one of the speeches that the the president-elect gave and everything and one of the the point that he wanted to make was that we and I'm just paraphrasing it it says that we will follow science whatever science tells us to do that's what we're going to do whatever this experts this educated people whatever they come up with whatever they tell us to do that's what we're going to do in other words science has become their God and I thought about there's another group of people who have not taken science and and God is their God faith is what they've been given for them to walk by it's not because we realize that this world was not framed by science science can take it and tell you that this is this many years old this is this you could put this together and do that but we understand the scripture tell us it was by the word of God that this was put together so we can come to a place and we begin to realize you know the the the the world out there is is making history united state has made history this is the first elected woman of color and a woman in the position of Vice President you can look at that people are rejoicing over those things and realize that how that this uh with they're making advancements they can claim they're making great achievement but we realize as our even as our Pastor said as the world is making his achievement we need to pay attention to the achievement that God is making these things are not just happening over the blue and we just look and say we are a people that have been warned that have been given given a word for us to look at what's happening out there and be able to look at the word of God and say that this today is the scripture being fulfilled and as this is happening I need to look at what is my portion in the word what is my portion in the scripture because as that is being fulfilled God is also fulfilling something God is not sitting on the sideline God is fulfilling his word and and we we know we don't have a portion with what's happening out there but there a portion for us in the scripture for us to also fulfill so we could see uh how that they they put the hearts and they put everything that they have in in science and they're hoping that they can come up with a way for them uh uh to make life better they always try to improve uh they a home that was built 10 years ago the home that's built today they make Improvement by science they do it better they achieve it they go forward and they do all those things and the prophet tells us perhaps I'll don't know if I'll get time to get to
