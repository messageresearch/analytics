tonight that there would be expectation I know that our bodies may be trying to fall asleep I was just thinking about this I was talking to brother Tommy just the other day about dragging this old Roman around you know like Paul was having to drag the old Roman around and sometimes you just have to tell them you're going to praise the Lord I don't care what you think I don't care what you're you're going to praise the Lord you're going to pull on the word of God it may want to fall asleep it may want to do something that it may not want to pull towards the spiritual real but you can ask and he shall be given you and that's a life that he gives you amen so don't let it be tradition don't let it be just a way of gathering don't let it just be where we enjoy the AC and we're all just out of the heat but let it be with expectation amen amen that that way we can receive the word of God Amen just invite brother Billy to come at this time then give me the key of D please and there are

you will change us and the more we come into your presence the more we'll never remain the same that is a promise you made unto us come unto me that are heavy laden and I shall give you rest we ask father this for the few that have gathered here may you just come by our way Lord and speak to us and father that we may receive the word of God in our hearts and go out of here at different people Lord and you said that rapturing Faith was is was in this message and we believe it Lord and not only that but you said that every Divine promise Lord that you made Lord was in your word that we could partake of it and never be the same want to commit this Gathering into your hands and Lord we remember those that are not here remember our pastor Lord and may you be with them oh God and we commited service we ask that you just come by our way and speak to us we love you and we ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you let's turn our Bibles uh for scripture reading amen I trust you enjoy the word this morning amen it certainly uh I was telling with Matthew in the back I said this is the promise for our time in fact I feel like it would just fit very well with the same things we were talking about about possessing our Promised Land Deuteronomy chapter 1 let's read verse 6 and 7 and 8 um and then you'll be seated it said the Lord Our God has spoken unto us in horb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount it says turn ye and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and unto the place n unto there unto in the plains in the plain and in the hills and in the valley and in the South by the sea to the land of the Canaanites and unto the unto Lebanon unto the Great River and the river Euphrates it says behold I have set I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and their seed after them we ask for the lord to bless his word you may have your seats I was reflecting on some of the things that were saiding this morning and and I'll just mention a few because I feel like when we say possessing our Promised Land what is it exactly that we're trying to Pro possess and this the end time message is our Promised Land it it really uh tells us what is it that belongs to us and in fact I was thinking about it if you really think it's not a new word but it's the original word it's not a new message but it's the very original message that God intended from the very beginning the prophet will say that the hardest thing that God has ever had to do is to get one model to believe another you you you think about that and guarding the human flesh has always been a controversy it's easy to believe God in heaven because everybody does that it's easy to believe that God was in Jesus Jesus we could see by the works that he did but the prophet will take it and he will say but if you were there in that time you wouldn't believe the same as you believe today in other word if you think you're going to believe him just because you read the text if you saw it face to face it was going to be a challenge for you too so it's easy for us to come today and in fact the scripture will say be behold I lay in Zion and stumbling block in a rock of offense and he will say bless is is he that is not offending me every time that the word of God takes flesh is always an offense for people people always misunderstood it because every time it never comes in the way like we heard it this morning that people expect it to come and I'll say this it's only given to the elect to see God in flesh amen it's only given to the elect the ability to see God in flesh when God makes a transition when he changes from one form to another when he turns the corner people are left behind people get caught in the tradition they get caught in the way the old way of doing things and I wouldn't even say this yet we are sitting here tonight saying oh we believe this do we really see it for what it is and I think that's a question we have to ask ourselves we can say thank God we've seen God In the Flesh and we seen God in the man yeah but remember the promise was not so we could just sit here and talk about how God was in the messenger because the goal was that what he did he was going to do it in you the promise was what he did there because remember the prophet didn't just come in lay all of this foundation work and all of this and so we can know how God can use a man and all of those things no God was condescending God wanted the says God desire from the beginning he wanted to be flesh he wanted to be in a human flesh if we can see it in the prophet I think that's wonderful and I think we should because with the vindications that we have seen with this message there's no no way you couldn't see that but do you see him in you do you see him in your neighbor do you see him in the person sitting next to you that's where the offense comes because now we the prophet we could read based on the text we read and we know some of the things he done and we are happy about it and we see oh my what that's wonderful but if you were to go to bed with that person and wake up with them and know all of the fault and everything would you still believe that God is in that man you know you ask Paul you know in the scripture says you know some of the people that were with him just woke up and say I don't know about ask they had questions so God has always set it that way so that only the elect will see the disciples stood there and he came butam says they came there were so many of them they came and over they came and he said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood oh it says well help all the intellectuals they left because it didn't make any sense to eat somebody's flesh and drink the blood unless you a vampire and then there was some 80 that was left and then he will say some more until there were the 12 and then he looks at them and says why don't you go also why are you here I tell you they didn't stay because of any human knowledge they had because he had already wipe all of them out they looked at him they said we don't understand but one thing we know is you have the words of eternal life and if you're going to follow this gospel you have to come to the same conclusion I don't understand everything I don't know how is God going to be made flesh I don't know what he's going to do I don't know how he wants to do but one thing I know is this is the word of eternal life so when he turns a corner to worship the god of history is not a problem we nobody has ever been offended if you talk to them about Jesus 2,000 years ago they'll gladly receive him but to talk about Jesus today that's that's where the offense comes but I don't want to say this the the most important part then becomes a god of history is not really relevant until that God can be this God today to believe a god of History it would not help you unless that same God can be the God today unless it's the same God who can touch you and heal you today unless it's the same God who can deliver you unless it's a God you can call upon so what makes him the same is the fact that what he did yesterday he can do today so we don't want to just gather and talk about God in the sense of a history of what he did without the understanding that is here doing the same thing but when I'm speaks it says in the message proving his word paragraph 135 he says now we say he's raised from the dead it says I didn't say that the word say the word here says it they said he raised from the he raised from the dead and is the same yesterday today and forever he says you believe that he's he says he's promised these things to happen in the last day the the same son of man will be manifested it says now now remember he says now remember this is the one preach on 08:16 proving his word 64816 it says paragraph 136 it says now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there now I thought this was so wonderful that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there it says it says that could discern the thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him it says that was not Jesus it says he had not yet been born but it was a man in a human flesh and let me say this because this becomes very important because every time people every time they we talk about the son of man people have the imagery of the person of Jesus Christ who walked the Flesh and everything and every time you do that it's going to get you confused because he's saying that this person this human he says he came in the time of Abraham it wasn't Jesus because he was not born yet but there was that person that came to Jesus we call him MDC he came and he was manifested and I say MDC came and he was in the time of Jesus he said he became Jesus Christ but he was talking about that person of the word it says it was not Abraham called him Elohim the great Almighty showing he said and and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch closly in the day of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed it says it says uh not uh not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called it says in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom called will come right through this remember that the son of it says the son of man will come down and and it said it will it will come down and come in a human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two United together and to that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man now because why is it so important that we know about the son of man because it's the time for the union the son of man is coming the manifestation is so that we can become one with the word is so we can be United with the word is so the bridegroom can come and be manifested because he saying that it's a time for the union together he said not a clergy I don't know he says do you see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in a human flesh Among Us and he will make his word so real that he will unite that he will unite the church and him as one the bride Jesus Christ making his word so real telling you about where you came from telling you about how you got here making it so real that in your mind you wouldn't have any question that you will be United with him that the part of you as will say in the time where flesh is becoming word are you uniting with the bridegroom so you can be one and then she will go home with a W to the wedding supper amen he saying that she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not the marriage it says fill your flesh it f said the Flesh of of Mighty Man it says cause the marriage of the Lamb has come but but but the Rapture is going the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word oh I love this the word it says when the word here unites with a person and they to become one and then what does that do what does that do then in manifest the son of man again the word in the prophet son of man the word in you son of man you know there are days where I woke up I you know I stretch I say man the son of man have a lot of work to do today you know my wife laughs at me you know we are the son of man it's you the son of man it's God in you makes you the son of man why it's the word uniting with you it's you uniting with that part of you that was in the beginning so you can become one it's new it's you knowing what you were made for what you were created how you got here it's you going back to the original position that God intended for you to be it's not a mystery and it's not something that we have to be scared of this is us this is you but when I'm will say in the breach he yeah he was there was a promise that he would be coming as a son of man and he came to the Jews and we understand that as a Son of God that was throughout the church ages because Son of God is spirit so throughout the seven Church ages and but the next coming that was in line was for him to come as son of David King but he said but in between the son of the the Son of God and the son of David that he was to come again but this time it was to specifically come for the Gentile because they didn't get access when it came the first time but we promised what he did for the Jews that he was going to do to the Gentile so we can come and see that same manifestation but to do what the same thing that he did when he came to Abraham he's doing with you why is he doing that so we don't sit here and just talk about stories so we can know the real God who is he from the beginning what did he created us for why are we sitting here for how did we get here he's here to bring you back in our orinal condition he says in the rising of the sun paragraph 93 says Now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word made flesh is the son of man the word when the word unites with the individual you are partaking of that same promise oh I love this that's why we can't come here and just lay it on the prophet and just say well he was a prophet he was born with a gift you know the say it said that God took the word and when Jesus came and said he was the most gifted person that there was but he knew that not all of us will be as gifted as he was so he takes and he does it by the word so we can do it by the word and I want to say this this is what we are partaking of this is when when I speak about our promised land this is what we are talking about it's the revealed message of the yah and I want to say this I know as we sit here without a doubt we could certainly say that God has revealed himself in this message this message is not the message of brother brandham this message is God himself we we could certainly say that I don't believe that we have any questions about this being God we we again we've passed those stages there could be those that are doubting that's fine but as we sit here tonight I believe that whatever the question is whatever you are whatever your situation is you do not question that this message came from God we we we can certainly say that we we have look we are looking at the promise that God made becoming a reality in our midst we we we can certainly say that The Works that were done by the manifestation that was God that did it it was God who Vindicated his Prophet it's God who sent the message and is God here making his message true we we can look at it and say this message was not given in the form of or for us to form some religious community to just have another church and say oh we are the message Believers we we are here uh you know we don't belong in a denomination but we have our own group we're going to C ourselves message belie no it wasn't given for that intent but this is the message that as as John will say that which was in the beginning that which our hands has handled that which we knew from the father this is it that we're talking about it brought to us the reality of the Living God who God is how to approach him how did go operates in our relationship with him it's the the prophet will say it's the perfect came to tie the loose hands so it could present to us the perfect picture of what God intended from the beginning Joshua will say in Joshua 1 the scripture will say now after the death of Moses my servant after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it says it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of num it says Moses uh Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan it says that that that that thou and all the all these people and unto the land which I I do give to them even the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall thread upon I have given it unto you and as I as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto the Great Rivers the river Euphrates and all the lands of the heads sites and unto the great sea towards the uh the going down of the sun it says shall be your Coast it says there shall not a man listen to this there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee oh I I could just take this and interpret it in quotes after quotes after quotes after quotes didn't brother Ram says the my ever never failing presence will always go before you behold I have sent an angel before you what did he do all of that so we can know the L is real why did Brother manifest the things that we say all of the things that we have seen so we know that the land is real and let me just jump ahead when he sent the spice to go over the purpose was not to go examine and see how hard the land was the scripture says that go and taste of the land and see if it's real it wasn't to go and say what the Giants that were in the land were it was for them to taste of the fruits to taste of the healing of the land to test of the Salvation of the land to test of the goodness of the land and say the land is real and if the land is real the rest is up to God but guess what they go and some all they saw was the challenges well didn't he say I have given you the land so if there are any challenges if there is sickness and if there's anything isn't he the one who gave you the land and you tasted it and you say it was good isn't it capable of taking care of those challenges we we we tend to become very intellectual with this message and and my heart desire and I want to just say it I I I if I could just live by what I know today if I could just live a life that's worthy of what I know now that will be enough for me we know God Is A Healer we know God is a provider we know all of those thing but yet we are challenged when the challenge comes we run off and we try to provide for ourselves we try to do all those things yet the word is here it says I Told You Be not Afraid don't run off stay with it stay with it stay with me well I I said it and I will bring it to pass so as you read this one of the things you understand that God never really changed what the purpose of the commission was so what he's telling what he's telling Joshua to do is the continuation of what he told Moses so when he comes he's saying and he's not telling him well Moses is gone now I want you guys to take a different direction and that's what's happening in this message the prophet is gone now everybody has their own Doctrine now everybody has their own way of seeing it everybody becomes all of the sudden the next Prophet everybody all of the sudden gets a revelation that it's no longer the prophet it's them it there was nothing that changed because the message was not the message of Moses the message was the meage message of God he says as I was with Moses so will I be with you now remember if you read further down whether the condition was that this book of law will not depart from thy mouth so you repeat what Moses said you do what Moses did and as I was with him so will I be with you you abandon Moses God is no longer with you we're not making a new way we following the same way we're not going in our own Direction we're following the Holy Spirit we're not making new discoveries no the word is unfolding before us what was promised is what we are seeing if what we're seeing is not what was promised we're not going to go in that direction but one them will say in the message the great warrior uh uh Joshua paragraph 38 it says now when Joshua oh I love this it says when Joshua was over over there talking uh walking around and and walking around and here he crossed over Jordan he says he began to eat some old corn he says and I can imagine Joshua that morning after having that great vision it says of the Lord saying I'll be with you just as I was with Moses so will I be with you it says called him out one night and said now look Joshua he says they give him a vision and said now my servant Moses is dead rise and go over Jordan it says Thou and the host of Israel and the Lord thy God thy God will be with thee he says no man shall stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with you only be of be good courage and do not uh uh be discouraged just keep moving on I'll be with you it says in every place you set your soul of your fi is your Poss uh uh your feet as a possession for you it says footprint means Possession It says brother what the church needs today what the church needs tonight is some Footprints over here in this land I said hey man what we need is just footprint what we need is just to know what did malachite 4 said about the bride in the end time what did God promise about this end time and take footprints on it and just go stand on it and just begin to stand on it he says don't hang around the Jordan too long let's get out of here and see what we got all right he says every time that he had to make a footprint he says every time that he he footprinted on it was a possession it says I can see Joshua after he had had the vision it says now gather all Israel and Stand Down by the by the Jordan sanctify yourself watch your clothes it says and come down to its banks in the morning and I will show you what what I'll show you what the glory of God is amen he had a vision what we like is a vision oh if God can give us a vision of what this message is if we can come and take the vision of this message if we can know that the God the same God who created heaven and earth is the one who send this message to us if we can know this message is the vision of the Lord regarding your life this message is God showing you his vision what he intends to do with you how that he brought you out of sin all of those things if we can just see it's his vision being made manifest to us because the moment Joshua understood that he had no fear he stood there you know the Lord with me the god of Moses the one who parted the Red Sea the one who did those great signs and wonders he says if he the same God with me I'm going oh I tell you God is looking for the same people tonight he's looking for people that said the God that was with Malachi 4 The God Who came and opened the seals The God Who came and Vindicated himself and he did all the sign and wonders his ear is looking for people to say if it's the same God I'm walking with him God told him in his word and he says the word said I have given you the land it's yours it's your possession oh my you know one of the things before somebody can sell you something they have to sell you a vision if you ever go and somebody Nam on you go to those car salesman my goodness they're going to let you know that you need every function every button every feature in that car oh this over here is just the seat the memory seat so you press it it just automatically does that you're like oh I need that this over here when you press it it does this oh yeah I need that this over here you can flip over here and it will do this oh I need that and you could buy a car and never use any of those features right but yet we are given a book full of pictures everything that you have need of it's in here everything that you whatever you going to encounter in the way it's in here but yet we are we not using the features it says I have given you the land it's yours whatever you desire and let me say this if God made a promise God is able to keep his promise but when I'm talks about Peter cwright he was sent over to go and have a Revival service and so he goes over and he's fixing the place and yeah he is working at the place and and then the bully of the Town shows up he says who ask you what are you doing here he says well I'm cleaning up so I can have service he says who told you you're going to have service here he says God told me we says well before you can have service over here you got to come through me you got to have to pass over me he says well if that's what I need to do that's the next thing I'll do he stood up and he folded his shirt and he went and he stum and he beat the guy up and he said the Lord will strengthen me and he stood up and he says is that enough he said yes and the shook hand and the guy got saved why that's someone who knew that God sent him somewhere I love that story because when he began to talk to him he didn't move he continued to scrub and butam goes in detail he continue to do what he was doing it's only after he said that you couldn't do that you have to come through me then he said okay I'm here to have a Revival and if you are on my way of Revival then I'll take care of you why because God told me I'm going to have a Revival meeting and I will have it and nothing will stop it so what we need as children of God is when God has given you a promise when God told you that I have healed you when God tells you I have delivered you when God said I'm your provider it's for us to look at the Devil and say okay now if you come on my way then it's time for me to kick you because I'm not going any way God has given me that it's easy to Proclaim great promises but yet we don't live by them but says God created men to depend on him I love that I tell you I never understood that every day I read it I get a new revelation about that God made you so you could be dependent on God on him now the world looks at that they says that's childish but God says he say that's wisdom you wake up in the morning how am I going to have my bread doesn't come from the strength of my hand my bread comes from him my good health doesn't become doesn't come from how many vitamins I take my good health comes from him my food comes from him my he's my provider in everything what the devil wants you to do is well you know I educated you you went to school you got a degree so it's by your knowledge that you get your bread from it's really not by God and says where man fails is when they're trying to achieve things without God when they go and they try to do it by themselves if he can raise the little of fish you think he doesn't know what you have need of in fact veram says when he says when he talks about that he says it shows you that he did that to show you that he cares about everything even the little things he says it says what we need I like this what we need he says you got to go you got to go do some fighting you got to go do some fighting not some not some feast and after he talks about pyra not some Feast but some but the power of God with your testimony that's how you overcome by the blood of the lamb and by your testimony tell the Devil he's got no string tied to you you've got to put this dis disase on me you you you've put this disease on me but Jesus delivered me from it he promised it to me he continues on he says brother footprint is possession ministering brother don't be afraid to put Footprints where God has told you to put them amen it's your possession he told Joshua everywhere the salt of your feet set it's yours amen paragraph 38 32 sorry he says we don't back up we don't back up we take what God said that's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems how difficult it is God said so it's yours it says when he give when he gave it to Joshua he never said I'll take all the Hat sites the Philistine and give it to you Joshua had to fight for every inch of ground but God was with him who's with you you know we act as if we were left alone God said okay I have giving it to you I I'm going to sit here and you just go I'll be watching from distance we live in the day where he says at that day you shall know just as I was in Christ and Christ and I I'll be in you and you in me the oness we we sing that song there's never been a day like this day what oh I tell you if the there could just be a fire within our hearts to see that this message is real if they could and let me say this not that I'm not saying that we don't believe it is real because let me say this each one in this building is a testimony of Jesus Christ how you sitting here today it's not by Your Own Strength it's a testimony of Jesus Christ oh how we can recall the joy that was when God came and took us out of sin and how he came and he paid the price for us how we open our eyes to see the things we are seeing we can never forget that every time we think about it it brings the joy in our heart because we know know we didn't make ourselves believe in everything and let me say this if he started in Joy he doesn't want to end in misery it's it starts in joy and he end in Joy he cannot do today and tomorrow he let you down no he said I'll be with you I'll continue to be with you he says just be of good courage continue to walk continue to prosper continue to go forward why as I was with Moses so will I be with you as I was with the Prophet so will I be with you and God keeps his word brother bam says paragraph 141 it says if it's for re if it's for salvation if it's for Divine Healing if it's for more blessing if it's for peace if it's for anything it's it's God promise it says make footprint amen every place that the soul of your feet set that I have given it to you God promised it God keeps his word am God promised it God keeps his word it says God's word is Everlasting truth I believe it you believe it brother it's time for us to make fruit prints he says you don't stay right here and you don't stay right here in the same camp it's it the fire's moving on let's move on from the glory to glory from from from from the Bible experience to Bible experience let's unfold and open up our hearts raise up our hands to God keep saying stay in the Bible don't get outside of it stay right there he's telling you and and the reason I read this is the the trick of the enemy is for you to try to go do it on your own he will either do two things one he will say well you don't qualify for it yes the promise is real but it's not for you why is it not not for you I don't know I mean he will find anything that he can convince you by if it's what you did yesterday or what you did 10 years ago he will go dig it up well you did this so that means you don't qualify for the promise you did this that's what you don't qualify for the promise you say well the promise I'm not saying the promise is not real but it's just not for you and we fail for it every time how do we fail for it something happened W is me it must have been something I did it must be that thing I did 10 years ago it's still hunting me we do that we go back and you know we we we we we go back on everything we've ever done wrong where God said it's in the sea of forgiv foress because remember forgiveness is part of the promise it's part of what the promise is God said if you come unto me I will forgive you so if he a forgiven you it's not up to you to go dig it up or try to find out what it was he he's doing all of this to cause us to move forward he doesn't want us to stand still at one place and to continue to to stay at one place no he wants us to be moving forward in him the same God who came and took you out of sin the same God who saved you the same God is the same god pushing you and saying go forward go forward by promise the thing about it is we try to get it by knowledge we started with the promise now we want to get it by knowledge we started with Revelation now we want to add some knowledge to it he says we've got the prophet of God we've got the word of God speaking about the children of Israel we've got the angel of God he's leading this church just exactly like he led them he led in them days he says that's exactly right the word of God is before us the prophet of God the prophet of God is the Holy Ghost is the Holy Spirit the angel of God is leading the church we are moving into the pillar of fire in glory it says in the glory of God sitting together in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ now we are sons of God it says and that great Revel and the great revelation of the word of God the Holy Spirit sinks it into our hearts and bring us and uh bringing forth the tree of salvation of Salvation righteousness living love joy peace and love long suffering goodness gentleness and patience sure it is and so if that's the case then it's very important that when we have challenges that we are reminded that we have a promise the way that God wants us to come and and and get this land is to stand upon on the promise that he has given us is to stand to say that this is mine you have given me you have given me my children you have given me my family you promised that you will be with me you promised that you will walk with me here I am full of challenges God here I am he wants you to pray about it he wants you to approach it to go find in the Bible the promise that he has made and come stand upon it and claim it it has doesn't want you to go and wander and and on your own and try to figure out a way to do it no he wants you to take it and stand upon the promise and put your footprint on it and say this is mine and I'm claiming it but what I'm will say is the hypress of our confession when you do that you're giving him something that he can work with when you do that then you giv him it says that the holy spirit is the enforcer of the law when you stand up on the word of God which represented the law then the Holy Spirit has the power to go and take it for you in fact even in the fighting it's not you taking it out it's him taking it for you he says oh I love this in the rising of the sun paragraph 1 one uh 3:21 it says no wonder he says he no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are Redeemed by him and now not in the future raise and now risen with him that's what EO means to the people risen with him notice it says now we have his spirit in us the the abstract deed fully paid listen to this now he says no you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it you don't say well I'm going to overcome you've already overcame you're not going to say well I'm going to get healed you are already healed so when you go to the very sourc of it God doesn't want you to approach it with some hop so with some uh I don't know if it's going to happen let me say this Abraham waited 25 years for the promise and the prophet said that every time the years went by Abraham Faith grew stronger why because he knew he had an understanding that God if God said he was going to have a child he will have it and the more that he will die in himself the more God will have to produce that child is that what the Bible say so what what about us if God made us a promise if God told us that we are healed if God told us we are delivered if God told us he will take care of us I don't care how long it takes the children of because remember the word was to Abraham and his seed after him the Seed of Abraham in the end time are identified as those that will look at the promise and say it's mine and I got it it's mine and there's nothing that will stop me from having it that's right they have no doubt about it there's nothing that can change the outcome because they know God already gave them so now he says you've already made it not that I will make it you've already made it I it says I never made it he made it for me oh I love that he made it for for me see not me him well brother bam say I don't care what you say there he says there he made it for me it says that's all I want it says I'm caring about I'm caring about he says I just want to see him manifested how can he do it he says call him he says call him down he says he is he is in you and he is see he is in you well then Lord he says if I can get myself out of the way you can manifest myself he said how can you do it because you ordained it so all that the father had given me will come Glory it says notice Glory the challenge we have is we try to make it ourselves if he said says you already made it it's like the disciples yeah they are and the boat is just rocking goodness and just the waves just bringing it up and down and everything you know so that they're like now how is it possible that they were going to die and he was not going to die if the Sheep went over you know if there were if if Naturally Speaking he should have been scared just as they were yeah they are caring not that we perish well if it's if they going to die obviously he was so supposed to be concerned about him dying so he stands up and he looks at them and puts his hands up and he speaks and the wave stops and everything comes down and everything and calls them ye of little faith and they looked at him they just astonished and brother bam said the word with with them was with them and they didn't even know it how many times he's with us we don't even know it he said oh we need to do is just raise him up say master I there's just a circumstance right now that I I just don't know how to deal with it there's just things happening now I don't know how to take care of it is this can you just help can you just work up I tell you says God wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed that's the quote he wants to give you the Holy Spirit more than you wanted sometimes we feel we act like we the one that really wanted and he doesn't want that's the that's Satan that's trying to make print that picture for you but the real God that we serve he wants to save you he wants to do more for you more than you can ever think because he gave his own life for you he has invested so much in you that he never want to see you perish thank oh if we can only understand the love of God that is in Jesus Christ what he had done for us we certainly will be a different people if the musician could come he says oh I love this the same Holy Spirit that's leading the church today it's the same this that's the same Holy Spirit that's leaving the church today the only thing you have to say is well is say well God tells God tells me in my heart that Jesus heals me he says this is my possession I take it and I go on it's mine and I said that's what you just have to say in your heart it says well then just go on the Holy Spirit just keeps leading you no matter how you are feeling I like that no matter how how you are feeling if you go if you go to your feelings then you are certainly going to you're going to go back you're going to go back to that every time you have a negative testimony every time that you look at your symptoms then you are falling right then there's no Christian in here here no matter how solid you are in faith if right now that you say something has happened to get a hold of you and tell you that you are not a Christian and you start out testifying well you're not a Christian no more oh I tell you and I say this this this is to show you how simple it is that you have it it's not to scare you for what you don't have but it's to show you how simple it is that you have it yes so all I need to do is just work up and testify I read the promise he told me I'm Healed the Holy Spirit told me in my heart I'm heal and that's all I'm going to go saying if he didn't tell me anything different how many times did have said well you know they they asking me to see Visions they asking me for this he said says I can't say it if it didn't tell me it says pray for the sick do this it says I can't if if God didn't show me anything I can't say it it says my own mother was dying right God didn't show me anything and I couldn't speak anything the problem is we speak our own imagination we speak what the devil is wanting us to speak no if God didn't show me I'm not going to speak it I'm only going to speak what the word tells me the word says I'm well I claim I'm well the world tells tells me that I'm good I I claim I'm good whatever the word tells me is my testimony my testimony is the word of God now remember in Leviticus the promise it says the land shall never be sold forever so in other words it doesn't matter how many circumstance will come upon you it doesn't matter how much trial will come upon you God is said that so nothing will last forever the devil can pile it up on you today I I want you to just walk and say the devil you piling up on me I might as well start rejoicing today why are you rejoicing because I know there's nothing that the devil can do that will last forever everything that he does is temporary and I have a God who does permanent things and if it tells me I'm Healed then I'm permanently healed you go today they measure everything that tell you oh you're going to die you go you take the medicine and you go and then you measure it says oh you well you come back again and said oh it's back no it's not back that's just your meters if God heals me he heals forever if God Saves you he saves you forever the devil can try to pull it back on you but the healing is not based on how I feel the healing is not based on my manal in fact says that's why it's so important we have the right manal attitude he says the right manal attitude towards any any promise will bring it to pass oh Church of the Living God let's not fa short of our commission and the things that God has given us let's not fell short of the things that God wants us to live by the scripture speaks about the men of old when God has spoken to them something you couldn't turn them otherwise all right every day when they woke up come on is this it the day is this the manner of choosing that God is going to do they didn't even have the clear picture the whole full picture all they knew is God told them but says when God told Simeon that you shall not die until you see the sun I'll tell you every day he went in the temple just singing today is the day today is the day and it didn't matter how many babies were around he touched them he knew oh Simeon you're getting old it didn't matter to him one thing he knew that God told me that I'm not going to go in the grave until I see the Promise one day he woke up he went Temple just the same way as he did he went to prayer the same as he did but that day was the day that God promised was going to come to pass and as he walk in he walk across and says there were so many babies he just came and there was one in a swaddling clo in this little girl holding him and all of the sudden the same God who gave the promise the same God leads him to the promise and he gets in he says my eyes have seen the promise of the glory of the coming coming of the Lord why he s the baby God promised it it didn't matter how old he got he didn't die until he saw the promise God promised you Rapture you going into the Rapture God promised that he will be with you even in you he's not going to let that God promis you will provide for your daily need that same God will be with you you're not going to die he promised he'll be with you and he's going to be with you let us stand he says this now remember when they got to Kadesh Baria butam calls it the Judgment seat because this is really where they had to make their decisions after the spies came and they brought all the reports yeah they are like I said a while ago the this spies were only there's no place where they told them go in there and count how many hammerites they have how many malachit there are in there how many heads sites and tell us the size that they are tell us the size of the arms and everything and then come report everything no all that they were told was go in there and come back with a report whether the land is good or not not bad good or not in other word go examine the land it says it will be flowing with milk and honey it will be all just go look and tell us if the land has those things my brother my sister we have come into this land is this the is this land exactly as the prophet said it is this exactly as the prophet promised is it exactly everything that was told us does it have any healing does he have Deliverance does he have all the things that he promis it does don't number one don't let the devil tell you it's not yours because it's yours and number two don't focus on the giant focus on the land how is it that I'm going to go in the Rapture goodness I don't have enough faith for a Toof how am I going to hit faithful Rapture now that's your giant right there I'm struggling with this how am I going to go in the Rapture it's none of your [Music] business you're not going to go in a Rapture because you did so many good works and God compiled it and said oh then you can go I I think with the principle of Christianity I feel like we have been so much indoctrinated with denomination it's it's so hard to perceive it because we we have this understanding that works equals to acceptance the more works I do the more God likes me no Jesus was beloved but didn't he go to the Cross to Die the very beloved of the father but whatam says he was so perfect like like that statue the the the statue we talk about God smote him the very perfect one oh sorry I was just going to go let me let me just read this so he says this I liked it so cish B so they had to choose it says this is where they fell because they listened to the bigger percentage of them men that came back and said so their understanding and their judgment was well there's 10 over here but there's only two who you going to listen to now we we think this is a reality now if you were put there now you can all put your spiritual caps right now say I would I no I want you to really think about it there is 10 that came from the same place as two 10 of them are saying it's not good well well you know the part that they said was good was good but there's more than that that we got to watch out for but there's only two on this side that are saying the land is good and we can take it so listen to what it said why they look like grasshoppers it says why we look like grasshoppers up there and then it says they were looking at the symptoms when Joshua called when Joshua when Joshua and Caleb was looking to what God Said said it says I give you the land no matter how big the cities how big the Giants God bigger than all my brother my sister your God Is Bigger Than all your God Is Bigger Than all he said God is the one that made the promise he's bigger than all and he's the one who made the promise so if you met if your giant is Big then God Is Bigger Than him if your problem tonight is Big then God is bigger than your problem whatever size you put your problem just know that God is above that just know that you have a god who's able and if he made the promise he'll come and keep it if we can go out of here just know if you didn't remember anything I said Just remember your God is bigger than your problem God bless you let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful Lord and Lord this is such a reality to me that every day I work up I just try to live the word and father that every morning on our daily exercise daily challenges of life and may we just know that you are bigger than our problem Lord and may you come to our rescue father and Lord God where we have fallen short we just pray Lord that you strengthen us and father that we may get that boost of energy from you Lord from your word and and be reassured that you are the same yesterday today and forever that's really our desire Lord and father some may run fast and some may run slow you didn't say it's those that run fast that will get there it's not some can fight faster some have abilities that others don't and but Lord even those that can make half a step Lord you still with them we pray that regardless of whatever measure you've puled you've placed in each one father may we just keep walking with you oh God may we not look to the other and say oh he prospering fast and may we just look upon you and say my God is with me and that's all that count Lord may you come to the rescue of your people and father that we may see this message this word of God materializing into our lives Lord and we don't want to be those that are just theologians and educated of the message that we can quote it and but yet in our daily daily lives we are full of defeat Lord we want to be those that would practice and eat of the message and that will put it to to use that it would actually bring forth the results that we can come and testify about help us Lord that's the desires of our hearts tonight and we lift you up onight and we ask Lord that you walk with us tonight father remember those that are sick and need and father those that have needs and we all have needs and we lift up our hands to you and pray Lord may you just come by our way oh God and and touch us tonight we remember our past so we commit everything we are to you and ask us things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's just sing now oh the same God who spoke to the woman and the way the same God
