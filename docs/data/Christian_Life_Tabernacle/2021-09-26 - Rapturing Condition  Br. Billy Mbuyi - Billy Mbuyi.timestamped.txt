[15:34] [Music]
[15:42] just go ahead and
[15:44] pray this morning
[15:46] father we're always so grateful for
[15:47] every opportunity we have to be gathered
[15:50] together
[15:51] lord to fellowship one with another
[15:54] lords to lift up your name in worship
[15:58] lord but more importantly lord that we
[16:00] would give preeminence to your word
[16:03] lord that you'd come by our way and make
[16:04] yourself known to us
[16:06] lord for without your presence this is
[16:08] just another religious gathering
[16:11] lord without you giving witness to your
[16:13] word into speaking the hearts
[16:15] to changing lives
[16:17] it's just another church service father
[16:20] lord we
[16:21] are depending upon you to come by our
[16:23] way
[16:24] to speak to each one to make yourself
[16:25] known to meet every need
[16:28] lord we pray that lord that you take
[16:30] dominion over every spirit that would
[16:32] prevent
[16:33] you from having dominion in this place
[16:36] lord that there would be nothing
[16:37] distracting that there would be
[16:40] no thoughts of the enemy but father that
[16:42] it would be just you and your word
[16:44] from the beginning to the end we commit
[16:46] the service to you we depend upon you
[16:48] and we thank you in jesus name amen
[16:53] [Music]
[16:54] well good morning
[16:58] you're one of the things that
[17:01] you spend any time at
[17:02] all you know among those that are out in
[17:06] the world or listen to the news or
[17:08] there's just this theme of looking for a
[17:10] safe place
[17:11] a safe place to provide
[17:14] my perspective a safe place to work a
[17:16] safe place to go to school
[17:18] this desire to be safe
[17:21] even to the point that we're willing to
[17:22] surrender freedoms for it
[17:25] that we could be safe
[17:26] to search for safety
[17:29] you know there was a time in david's
[17:30] life where he was
[17:33] looking for a place of safety
[17:36] remember the story that he had that
[17:38] victory over goliath and
[17:40] had been raised up to a position in
[17:42] saul's
[17:44] army in his court
[17:46] and then because of his reputation he
[17:48] began to be a threat
[17:50] to saul
[17:51] saul began to be afraid of the fact that
[17:54] the people are
[17:55] you know beginning to praise david and
[17:58] so he set it upon his hearts to destroy
[18:00] the man
[18:02] and so you know the story that david had
[18:04] to run
[18:05] he was looking for a place of safety
[18:08] a place to get away from this king
[18:12] you know it's interesting that the place
[18:14] that he ended up in
[18:16] was gath
[18:19] the city of the philistines
[18:21] the very city
[18:23] that goliath was from
[18:26] why would david go there of all places
[18:31] you know goliath
[18:33] literally stood out in a crowd
[18:36] in his home
[18:38] he was also their champion
[18:41] known for his
[18:43] great battles
[18:46] you know no doubt
[18:48] people knew of the fact that they were
[18:50] humiliated in battle
[18:52] when this david
[18:54] killed their champion
[18:56] and had them running
[18:58] and here he is
[18:59] in their very town
[19:02] let's also not forget
[19:05] the goliath family
[19:08] there were other giants in town that had
[19:10] it out for david
[19:11] david had to deal with later in his life
[19:15] and
[19:17] he was also carrying goliath sword
[19:21] what could go wrong
[19:24] and yet that's the very place
[19:27] that david goes
[19:30] for safety
[19:34] you know clearly at first david was
[19:36] nervous about his choice
[19:39] you know he
[19:40] pretended to be crazy
[19:42] you know the moment people recognized
[19:44] him and brought him before the king
[19:47] but you know ultimately he and his band
[19:50] of men became close allies
[19:53] with achish the king of gath
[19:57] in fact
[19:58] in first samuel 28
[20:01] akish the king of gath
[20:04] made david and his men part of his
[20:06] personal guard
[20:09] and he fought alongside him
[20:12] in the very battle where the philistines
[20:14] defeated the children of israel and saul
[20:16] was killed
[20:19] you know eventually the men of gath had
[20:21] had enough and
[20:23] you know pressured their king to let him
[20:25] go
[20:28] but for a time
[20:29] david
[20:30] sat
[20:32] strangely in safety
[20:34] in that place
[20:36] where even though all the men of gath
[20:39] wish they could get him alone in the
[20:40] darkness and have their way with him
[20:43] he was under the protection of a king
[20:47] it's a strange
[20:49] surreal situation
[20:52] that when david needed a place of safety
[20:56] he found it
[20:58] in the camp of his enemies
[20:59] where you think he'd be the least safe
[21:06] you know something besides david's own
[21:08] thinking brought him to this place
[21:10] nobody in their right mind
[21:12] will go i got an idea
[21:14] i'm going to go where i just defeated
[21:15] them and hide with them
[21:18] you know there was clearly some other
[21:20] leading going on there and in fact we
[21:22] turned into psalm 56 this morning
[21:26] you know psalm 56 was written during
[21:29] this time
[21:30] when david was
[21:33] finding safety and protection in this
[21:36] unsafe place
[21:40] he says in verse 8
[21:42] thou tellest
[21:44] all my wanderings
[21:47] put thou my tears into thy bottle
[21:50] are they not
[21:52] in thy book
[21:54] thou tellest
[21:55] all my wanderings
[21:58] the lord
[22:00] was directing his steps
[22:03] he's testifying he's recognizing that
[22:05] you know the steps of the righteous are
[22:07] ordered the lord
[22:08] clearly there was something leading
[22:10] david to this place when he sought a
[22:12] place of safety
[22:14] the lord
[22:15] brought him here
[22:19] beyond any any idea of man
[22:23] you
[22:24] know it didn't look like a safe place
[22:29] but for david it was the safest place in
[22:31] the land
[22:35] in verse 2 of psalm 56
[22:38] giving you an idea where david's head
[22:40] was at
[22:41] he says mine enemies would daily swallow
[22:43] me up
[22:45] for they be many that fight against me o
[22:47] thou most high
[22:50] what time i am afraid
[22:52] i will trust in thee
[22:55] in god i will praise his word
[22:58] in god i have put my trust
[23:01] i will not fear what man can do unto me
[23:05] and then again it says in verse 11
[23:07] in god have i put my trust
[23:10] i will not be afraid of what man can do
[23:12] unto me
[23:15] surrounded on every hand by his enemy
[23:20] yet
[23:20] in the safest place in the land
[23:24] you know i was reading that it occurred
[23:26] to me that
[23:28] no matter where the lord has you
[23:32] what circumstance you're in
[23:35] what's going on it is the safest place
[23:38] in the land
[23:39] for you if he's directing your steps
[23:44] the place you find yourself in
[23:47] right now
[23:48] is the safest place in the land
[23:52] in spite of what might be around you
[23:55] you know i'm reminded of daniel and the
[23:57] lion's den
[23:59] surrounded by creatures that should have
[24:02] torn him apart
[24:05] but he was in the safest place he could
[24:07] be in the land safer than his own home
[24:10] safer than in the palace of a king
[24:13] right there in the middle of the lions
[24:14] was the safest place he could be
[24:19] so how was it that david could find
[24:21] safety
[24:23] in a place where there should be none
[24:26] it says in verse 12 thy vows
[24:29] are upon me
[24:31] oh god
[24:33] there was a word that had gone forth
[24:35] concerning david
[24:37] spoken by a prophet
[24:40] that he would be taking up a position
[24:44] that he would be a king
[24:47] he was anointed for that purpose
[24:51] but there was a word god's vow
[24:54] for his word is his vow
[24:56] that had to be fulfilled
[25:00] you know twice in psalm 56 david makes
[25:03] this statement
[25:04] in god
[25:06] i will praise his word
[25:09] you know this isn't talking about
[25:11] raising his hands and
[25:13] saying praise the lord you know with his
[25:15] lips in a worship service or even when
[25:18] he reads
[25:20] or hears the word of the lord
[25:23] god's word is praised when it is
[25:25] fulfilled
[25:28] the fulfillment of the word
[25:30] is the praise thereof
[25:34] and david recognized his part in that in
[25:37] god
[25:38] will i praise his word
[25:40] there will come a time when his word
[25:42] will be fulfilled
[25:44] to his praise and i have a part in that
[25:48] so he could dwell in safety in that
[25:50] dangerous place knowing
[25:52] he was in the safest place in the land
[25:57] you know all along the way
[25:59] every circumstance that he found himself
[26:01] in
[26:03] was part of the fulfilling of that word
[26:05] that had been spoken to him
[26:07] so where else could he be to find better
[26:10] safety
[26:11] than that
[26:13] in god i will praise his word
[26:17] in god i have put my trust i will not
[26:19] fear what flesh this physical realm
[26:22] can do unto me
[26:25] you know as with david he directs each
[26:28] and every one of our steps there's a
[26:29] word that's gone forth concerning us
[26:33] you know it's funny we live in an hour
[26:34] where everyone's crying for safety
[26:37] looking for a safe place
[26:39] but if he's directing you no matter what
[26:41] circumstance you're in
[26:43] you're in the safest place
[26:45] in the land
[26:47] so i hope that's a blessing to you but
[26:49] that's what stuck out to me as i was
[26:50] reading this we'll read psalm 56
[26:52] together
[26:55] starting in verse 1.
[26:57] be merciful unto me o god for man would
[27:01] swallow me up he fighting daily
[27:03] oppresseth me
[27:05] mine enemies would daily swallow me up
[27:08] for they be many that fight against me o
[27:10] thou most high
[27:12] what time i am afraid i will trust in
[27:15] thee
[27:15] in god i will praise his word in god i
[27:19] have put my trust
[27:20] i will not fear what flesh can do unto
[27:23] me
[27:24] every day they rest my words all their
[27:26] thoughts are against me for evil
[27:29] they gather themselves together they
[27:31] hide themselves they mark my steps when
[27:34] they wait for my soul
[27:36] shall they escape by iniquity in thine
[27:39] anger cast down the people o god
[27:42] thou tellest my wanderings put thou my
[27:45] tears into thy bottle are they not in
[27:48] thy book
[27:49] when i cry unto thee then shall mine
[27:51] enemies turn back this i know for god is
[27:55] for me in god will i praise his word in
[27:58] the lord will i praise his word in god
[28:01] have i put my trust i will not be afraid
[28:04] what man can do unto me
[28:06] thy vows are upon me o god i will render
[28:10] praises unto thee for thou has delivered
[28:13] my soul from death will not thou deliver
[28:16] my feet from falling that i may walk
[28:18] before god in the light of the living
[28:21] amen
[28:29] amen god bless you we may be seated
[28:35] we don't have any song requests but um
[28:38] there's this song on my heart i would
[28:39] like to sing
[28:43] when peace

[49:53] but if you have any need in your heart
[49:54] just lift your hands now as we're gonna
[49:56] invite the brothers to take tithe and
[49:58] offerings

[50:01] if my brother taught me to
[50:03] pray for these offerings in tithe
[50:16] it's just about our hearts
[50:21] dear lord lord we're just gathering here
[50:24] this morning in your name lord
[50:26] knowing that you're present lord every

[50:44] we get down lord or we start
[50:46] looking at the negative lord
[50:49] but as
[50:51] i was reading the word lord i just i
[50:53] caught a little personal thing myself
[50:56] lord that
[50:57] that simple little faith that we have
[51:00] just that brother branham speaks of lord
[51:03] that
[51:03] starts our car or just
[51:05] helps us to get up and
[51:07] walk across the room lord i
[51:10] i realize that same faith is the faith
[51:12] that you've given me to
[51:15] believe in you lord
[51:17] lord we know that each day that we walk
[51:20] through this world lord that without
[51:22] that faith we have nothing

[51:34] lord we so thank you for your love and
[51:36] your mercy on our lives lord
[51:39] none of us would be gathered here today

[59:39] this morning
[59:42] father as we sang the songs to lift up
[59:44] your name lord we're so thankful this
[59:47] morning that we can say we know the
[59:49] master lord
[59:51] that we've met him ourselves lord that
[59:54] he's touched our lives and he's done
[59:56] something for us that's why we gathered
[59:58] here lord father we pray that if there
[1:00:00] be any needs in our midst lord
[1:00:03] no doubt as we gather lord we always
[1:00:05] have a desire within our heart father we
[1:00:08] pray that as the word goes forth that we
[1:00:10] may receive that which we have need of
[1:00:13] father because we know that
[1:00:15] the very things we desire lord
[1:00:18] is because you place the desire within
[1:00:20] us
[1:00:21] lord if it be any natural any desire
[1:00:25] father we've been told that if we ask
[1:00:27] according to your word that you shall
[1:00:29] give it to us
[1:00:30] father we've been told that if we come
[1:00:33] and
[1:00:33] if you've done one thing one way before
[1:00:36] lord that you are obligated to do it
[1:00:38] again if we come
[1:00:40] therefore this morning lord we invite
[1:00:42] you to be the guest of honor in our
[1:00:43] midst lord
[1:00:45] father may you have your preeminence
[1:00:47] over the service lord and father use our
[1:00:49] mouth and speak to our heart lord that
[1:00:52] we may receive from you lord we don't
[1:00:55] we're not interested to receive from man
[1:00:57] we're interested to receive from god the
[1:00:59] words of life
[1:01:01] father we asked this morning that you
[1:01:03] remember brother david and
[1:01:05] i know he's ministering this morning i
[1:01:07] pray that you just give him strength
[1:01:08] lord and father bless the service that
[1:01:11] they may have a wonderful time and

[1:01:24] heart and change it
[1:01:26] oh god
[1:01:27] what a privilege it is to stand before
[1:01:29] you lord and the bible says in psalm it
[1:01:32] says bless the lord o my soul and it
[1:01:35] says forget not all is benefit who
[1:01:37] forgiveth all thy iniquity and healeth
[1:01:40] all of that diseases lord
[1:01:42] we're so thankful that we have a god who
[1:01:44] can do that
[1:01:45] be lifted up this morning we commit
[1:01:47] everything we are to you and ask it in
[1:01:49] the name of the lord jesus christ amen
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:54] amen so glad to be gathered in the house
[1:01:56] of god this morning
[1:01:58] i want to welcome everyone all our
[1:01:59] visitors who are certainly happy to have
[1:02:02] you with us
[1:02:03] amen let's open our bibles in
[1:02:07] romans the book of romans chapter 8.
[1:02:33] amen let's start from verse 1.
[1:02:41] it says there's therefore no there's
[1:02:44] therefore now no condemnation
[1:02:46] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:02:49] who walketh not after the flesh but
[1:02:52] after the spirit
[1:02:53] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:02:56] christ jesus had made us free from the
[1:02:59] law of sin and death
[1:03:01] for what the law could not
[1:03:03] do
[1:03:06] in that it was
[1:03:08] weak through the flesh
[1:03:10] it says god sent his own son
[1:03:13] in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:03:16] and for his and for and for sin condemns
[1:03:20] sin in the flesh
[1:03:22] it says that the righteousness of the
[1:03:23] law might be fulfilling us
[1:03:26] who walketh not after the flesh but
[1:03:28] after the spirit it says for they that
[1:03:31] are after the flesh do mind the things
[1:03:34] of the flesh but they they are after the
[1:03:36] spirit
[1:03:38] the things of the spirit
[1:03:40] it says
[1:03:41] for to be carnally minded is death
[1:03:45] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:03:48] peace
[1:03:49] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:03:52] against god
[1:03:53] for
[1:03:54] um for it is
[1:03:56] not subject to the law of god neither
[1:03:59] indeed can be
[1:04:00] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:04:03] cannot please god
[1:04:06] it says but you are not in the flesh
[1:04:09] amen i'm sure glad
[1:04:10] yeah again i perhaps i'll try to use as
[1:04:13] a background that's what we heard on
[1:04:15] wednesday
[1:04:17] uh you know however david brought it out
[1:04:19] so beautifully that everything it was by
[1:04:22] faith it was by faith everything that's
[1:04:25] accounted to us was by faith
[1:04:27] it says by e or not in the flesh and is
[1:04:30] ex
[1:04:31] explicitly letting us know that we are
[1:04:33] not in the flesh
[1:04:35] but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:04:37] spirit of god dwelleth in you
[1:04:40] it says now if any man have not the
[1:04:43] spirit of god he is none of his
[1:04:45] and if the spirit
[1:04:47] if if if christ be in you
[1:04:49] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:04:52] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:04:55] but if the spirit of him that raiseth uh
[1:04:58] that raise up christ jesus from the dead
[1:05:01] dwelleth in you
[1:05:03] he that raised up that raised up christ
[1:05:05] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:05:07] mortal bodies
[1:05:09] by the spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:05:13] therefore brethren we are not debtors
[1:05:16] we are we are debtors not to the to the
[1:05:19] flesh but to live after the we are not
[1:05:22] debtors to the flesh to live after the
[1:05:25] flesh for if we live after the flesh
[1:05:28] ye shall die
[1:05:30] but if
[1:05:31] ye through the spirit do mortified the
[1:05:33] deed of the body of the body ye shall
[1:05:36] live
[1:05:37] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:05:40] god they are the sons of god
[1:05:43] for ye are not have not received the
[1:05:46] spirit of bondage against again to fear
[1:05:49] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:05:51] adoption where whereby we cry our father
[1:05:56] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:05:59] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:06:01] god
[1:06:02] and if children
[1:06:04] then heirs
[1:06:06] heirs of god and joining with christ
[1:06:10] if so be
[1:06:11] be that that we suffer with him that we
[1:06:14] shall also
[1:06:16] glorified together
[1:06:19] amen let's just buy heads our gracious
[1:06:21] father we thank you for your word we ask
[1:06:23] that you just multiply the word to our
[1:06:25] heart this morning we ask it in the name
[1:06:27] of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[1:06:30] man you may be seated but also as you
[1:06:32] see that let's turn to another scripture
[1:06:34] here
[1:06:35] uh in uh
[1:06:37] first thessalonians chapter four
[1:06:39] uh let's start from verse 13.
[1:06:42] um
[1:06:45] it says but i wouldn't
[1:06:46] but i would not
[1:06:49] but i will not have you to be ignorant
[1:06:51] brother and concerning them which are
[1:06:53] asleep
[1:06:55] that ye sorrow not even as other which
[1:06:58] are not which have no hope
[1:07:01] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:07:04] rose again even so them which are which
[1:07:08] sleep in jesus will god bring with him
[1:07:14] for
[1:07:15] it says for we we say unto you
[1:07:18] by the word of the lord
[1:07:20] that we that they which we alive are
[1:07:23] remain
[1:07:24] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:07:26] shall not prevent them which are sleep
[1:07:29] for the lord himself shall descend
[1:07:32] from heaven
[1:07:34] with a shout with a void
[1:07:36] of an archangel and with a trump of god
[1:07:40] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:07:43] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:07:47] be caught up together with them in the
[1:07:49] cloud to meet the lord in the air so
[1:07:52] shall we ever be
[1:07:54] with with the lord it says therefore
[1:07:56] comfort one another with these words
[1:08:03] as we read
[1:08:06] this morning
[1:08:10] there was just i guess some of the
[1:08:12] things that our pastor said on wednesday
[1:08:15] uh perhaps
[1:08:16] uh
[1:08:17] this morning i just want to go in that
[1:08:19] direction for a little bit
[1:08:21] and
[1:08:22] i hope it will be a blessing to you
[1:08:24] amen like we pray let's remember whether
[1:08:27] david and brother cosman
[1:08:28] and uh brother matthew i believe brother
[1:08:31] paul is traveling back to congo we want
[1:08:33] to remember him uh this afternoon we may
[1:08:36] have a bridal from chile
[1:08:39] he's this morning with brother jesus
[1:08:41] over there he may minister for us
[1:08:42] tonight so let's just keep that in
[1:08:44] prayer that the lord may make a way
[1:08:47] so as we read in romans we can certainly
[1:08:50] say that everything a believer obtains
[1:08:53] or everything about us is in the spirit
[1:08:56] we realize nothing is in the flesh it's
[1:08:58] all in the spirit our salvation is in
[1:09:01] the spirit we're obtained by the spirit
[1:09:04] our healing we obtain it by the spirit
[1:09:07] everything anything we try to do in the
[1:09:09] flesh will not work because the
[1:09:11] scripture tells us that ye are not in
[1:09:13] the flesh we've not been given the flesh
[1:09:16] to operate by but we are being given the
[1:09:19] spirit in order for us to transform
[1:09:21] what's happening in the flesh
[1:09:23] it's it's the it's by the spirit of god
[1:09:26] that everything happens it's by the
[1:09:28] spirit of god that the world will form
[1:09:31] it's by the spirit of god that that we
[1:09:34] are transformed to what we are today and
[1:09:36] it's by the same spirit of god that will
[1:09:38] be will receive our body change
[1:09:41] now brother david read this quote and i
[1:09:43] certainly want to go over it before we
[1:09:45] could just jump into what i have in my
[1:09:47] heart
[1:09:48] this is in the rising of the sun
[1:09:50] paragraph 3 or 7. it says
[1:09:53] look it says look what we've seen in
[1:09:56] this day
[1:09:57] quickening power has come to us to open
[1:10:00] the seven seals it says what was that
[1:10:03] the intelligence of a man no
[1:10:06] quickening power of god see quickening
[1:10:09] power of god foretold that this will
[1:10:12] take place now remember that uh sir is
[1:10:16] this the time he comes and he tells
[1:10:18] about the event and and what's going to
[1:10:20] happen he doesn't understand how all is
[1:10:23] going to transpire and everything and
[1:10:25] he's talking about all this
[1:10:27] thing is wondering if it's the end of
[1:10:29] his life and all those things and here
[1:10:31] it comes on what is the attraction of
[1:10:33] the mountain god comes and he makes his
[1:10:35] word a reality and so we can sit here
[1:10:38] and say that we have seen those things
[1:10:40] come to pass it's the quickening power
[1:10:43] of god being made manifest in this end
[1:10:46] time
[1:10:48] it's the quickening we can you know we
[1:10:50] were talking with the youth and you know
[1:10:52] some begin to ask a question you know
[1:10:54] what's the difference between the holy
[1:10:56] ghost and the quickening power when i
[1:10:58] got the holy ghost it means do i does it
[1:11:00] means that i need to wait again and get
[1:11:02] the quickening power well the quickening
[1:11:04] power is the holy spirit
[1:11:06] it's the same thing it's the holy spirit
[1:11:10] but throughout the ages we have to
[1:11:12] understand that what has happened is the
[1:11:14] the the throughout the ages that there
[1:11:17] was only a measure allotted based on the
[1:11:20] word that was dispensed in the time so
[1:11:22] if all they knew was sanctification or
[1:11:24] justification that's how they walked and
[1:11:27] the holy spirit came it was the work of
[1:11:29] the holy spirit to quicken that
[1:11:31] sanctification to them that
[1:11:33] justification to them and even the
[1:11:35] baptism of the holy ghost on pentecost
[1:11:38] but oh my we've come in such a place
[1:11:40] where we we're not going right back
[1:11:43] again at the beginning we're not going
[1:11:45] right back again to get faith and back
[1:11:47] up but now the capstone itself has come
[1:11:50] down
[1:11:51] now it's the revealing of the entire
[1:11:53] mystery of what god intended to do from
[1:11:56] the beginning
[1:11:57] so therefore the quickening power has
[1:12:00] come to reveal to you what god called
[1:12:02] you to be in the first place it's just
[1:12:05] not in a place where you say well you
[1:12:07] know you receive enough holy spirit to
[1:12:10] not do wrong and to not lie and to just
[1:12:12] try to live a good life that's not what
[1:12:14] we are about in this generation we've
[1:12:17] received such quickening power to make
[1:12:19] the word of god a reality
[1:12:23] to make god live in other words we've
[1:12:25] come back to where
[1:12:27] man once again is being brought in the
[1:12:29] condition that he was in the garden of
[1:12:31] eden where he can manifest god in his
[1:12:34] flesh where he can bring and come to a
[1:12:37] place where god's mind is his mind he
[1:12:40] can come back to a place where god can
[1:12:42] look at him and he can say something and
[1:12:44] god honors it we come back to a place
[1:12:46] where the fullness of what god uh
[1:12:50] prophesy what he says in joel that i'll
[1:12:52] pour up my spirit it's been poured into
[1:12:55] his body
[1:12:56] so he says it's quickening power that
[1:12:58] done that it's quickening fire the
[1:13:00] foretold of these things the quickening
[1:13:02] power of god made the world testify of
[1:13:06] this uh
[1:13:07] of this to be the truth the angel of the
[1:13:10] lord he says i told you was around the
[1:13:12] pillar of fire the quickening power let
[1:13:15] the word testify that this is the truth
[1:13:18] it says and in and in that they it says
[1:13:21] they didn't know what it was and we knew
[1:13:24] he said just look look at it this way
[1:13:28] it's a load up there they didn't know
[1:13:30] they took the picture they didn't know
[1:13:31] what to do with it but it's the same
[1:13:33] quickening power the prophesy of it it's
[1:13:36] the same quickening power that talked
[1:13:38] about it it's the same quickening power
[1:13:40] that said take it and turn it around and
[1:13:42] it will see what it is it's the same
[1:13:45] it's always the same god
[1:13:47] the same christ and what is it doing is
[1:13:50] manifesting himself in a greater manner
[1:13:52] to his people why because it's it's a
[1:13:55] uniting time it's a time where his
[1:13:57] desiring to become one with us is a time
[1:14:01] where his desiring to manifest himself
[1:14:03] isn't his people it's a it's a time
[1:14:06] where after he's died and he gave his
[1:14:08] life and he gave all that he was it's
[1:14:11] the time that he comes and claimed what
[1:14:13] he died for
[1:14:14] so he can fully manifest himself in a
[1:14:16] human body
[1:14:19] now he says he continues on it says in
[1:14:22] this
[1:14:23] it says
[1:14:25] he is the one who opens those seals he
[1:14:28] is those seals for the whole world of
[1:14:31] god is christ and christ is the seals he
[1:14:34] says
[1:14:36] christ is the seals that was open which
[1:14:38] is what is the opening of the seals
[1:14:40] revealing christ it says and the very
[1:14:43] and the very seven angels which
[1:14:45] represented the seven churches all
[1:14:48] completed and we couldn't even see it we
[1:14:51] didn't they took a picture not us
[1:14:54] they uh it says there it is standing
[1:14:57] there the supreme judge showing is the
[1:15:00] alpha and the omega the beginning and
[1:15:03] the end what an identification
[1:15:06] quickening power did that to us
[1:15:10] quickening power did that to us
[1:15:13] and then he says it's all our lord is
[1:15:15] full of
[1:15:17] quickening power let us not let us see
[1:15:19] this these things coming quickening
[1:15:22] power snatches from death to life
[1:15:25] quickening power gives us discernment to
[1:15:28] to know what's wrong with us what to do
[1:15:31] and what we have done and what what we
[1:15:34] ought to what what we have we ought to
[1:15:36] we have done and to show us
[1:15:40] and what we should have done that we and
[1:15:42] what we will be quickening power all
[1:15:45] these things so in other words the
[1:15:47] quickening power is here so it can let
[1:15:49] us know what do we need to do what is
[1:15:52] our portion uh quickening power is here
[1:15:55] to lead us to guide us quickening is
[1:15:58] quickening power is here so we can live
[1:16:00] by it so we can walk by it everything
[1:16:02] about us is by quickening power
[1:16:05] quickening his power is here to make
[1:16:06] himself a reality to us so we can
[1:16:09] understand what he wants to do with us
[1:16:12] so we can understand in what direction
[1:16:14] he wants to tell us he wants to lead us
[1:16:16] so it's always about the quickening
[1:16:18] power
[1:16:20] he says
[1:16:21] hello jesus is so full of quickening
[1:16:23] power
[1:16:24] he was he was he says he was all of it
[1:16:28] together he says he was full of
[1:16:31] quickening power he said you destroyed
[1:16:34] this body and i'll raise it up again in
[1:16:36] three days
[1:16:37] he says talk about confidence in
[1:16:39] quickening power
[1:16:40] it destroyed this body
[1:16:42] this temple and i will bring it up again
[1:16:45] and i'll bring it up in three days
[1:16:47] why
[1:16:48] he says
[1:16:49] yes
[1:16:51] he would say why he would say that he
[1:16:53] says he knew
[1:16:55] that it was written of him
[1:16:58] now i like how our messenger takes
[1:17:00] something he will speak and then now you
[1:17:02] can already sense when he's about to
[1:17:04] bring it to us you can already sense how
[1:17:06] he's about to turn it around and how
[1:17:08] he's about to just take it and and turn
[1:17:11] the light to you so you can understand
[1:17:13] it says he knew what was written of him
[1:17:16] see
[1:17:17] it says that was what was written of him
[1:17:19] by the word of god that he could not
[1:17:21] fall that he that the word of god that
[1:17:23] could not fail the word says i will not
[1:17:26] suffer my holy one to seek corruption
[1:17:29] neither will i have living soul his soul
[1:17:32] in hell he knowed that quickening power
[1:17:35] would raise him up
[1:17:37] it says
[1:17:38] we raise him up he says there wouldn't
[1:17:41] be one cell corrupt he says destroy this
[1:17:44] temple and i will bring it back up again
[1:17:47] in three days why
[1:17:49] it was prophesy the word of god a
[1:17:52] prophecy it says if it be true the word
[1:17:55] of god it cannot fail and the same
[1:17:58] prophecy of the word of god of of word
[1:18:01] of god said that it will raise them up
[1:18:04] says that we are already raised
[1:18:08] so the same word that says that is
[1:18:10] already risen up he says i'll raise he
[1:18:13] up from the dead he's saying we are also
[1:18:15] raised up with him
[1:18:18] no wonder he says fear not it is written
[1:18:21] that the spirit it says the spirit that
[1:18:24] is now
[1:18:26] what he says the spirit that is now was
[1:18:29] in him now is in us
[1:18:32] also quickening our mortal bodies fear
[1:18:35] not friends the sun is up the eson is up
[1:18:40] so here he is in other words is
[1:18:42] comforting us is letting us know he's
[1:18:45] bringing us to a place where we can have
[1:18:47] understanding this morning that the same
[1:18:50] way the spirit walked in him the same
[1:18:52] way the spirit raised him up from the
[1:18:55] dead the same way the spirit put
[1:18:57] confidence in him to know what the word
[1:18:59] said about him the same way the spirit
[1:19:02] led him
[1:19:03] to go places to do things that revealed
[1:19:06] to him visions of what he should and and
[1:19:09] where he should go and where he should
[1:19:11] not go when the spirit comes into the
[1:19:14] bride is there to do the same thing
[1:19:17] the spirit is here to lead us to give us
[1:19:20] confidence to tell us to fear not to
[1:19:23] provide for our needs to give us victory
[1:19:26] to give us healing to give all of those
[1:19:28] things why because it's the same exact
[1:19:31] spirit in fact i want to say this just
[1:19:33] so i can get to what i want to say this
[1:19:35] morning the script the spirit is here to
[1:19:39] put us into rapturing conditions
[1:19:42] and that's my title this morning
[1:19:44] rapturing condition we cannot be in the
[1:19:47] rapture condition unless the spirit of
[1:19:50] god comes and quicken us
[1:19:52] it quickens us today it will quicken
[1:19:54] tomorrow it will click it why it's
[1:19:57] making every single word of god a
[1:19:59] reality to us bringing us into a
[1:20:01] condition where we can receive the body
[1:20:04] change bringing us into a condition
[1:20:06] where we can be aware of what he has
[1:20:08] done because i want to say this what's
[1:20:10] the purpose of sending the quickening
[1:20:12] power
[1:20:15] it's not for us to just say oh we
[1:20:17] received the quickening power it's to
[1:20:19] bring a change in you remember he says
[1:20:22] it's the secret lies within the sent
[1:20:25] them seven seals it says the rapture in
[1:20:27] faith was in the seven sails the window
[1:20:30] seals will open what up in the seven
[1:20:32] sales is the quickening power so by
[1:20:35] receiving the seven sales i am receiving
[1:20:38] the quickening power i am receiving and
[1:20:41] it's transforming me putting me in the
[1:20:43] rapture condition where i'm no longer
[1:20:46] about the business of this world where
[1:20:48] i'm not interested in the things of the
[1:20:50] world where my mind is being changed
[1:20:53] where everything about me is change to
[1:20:55] where i'm focused to where i'm going
[1:20:59] amen
[1:21:00] now
[1:21:01] when you speak about to be conditioned
[1:21:04] when you say i'm being conditioned
[1:21:07] it speaks i just took a definition so i
[1:21:09] can just frame this in what we want to
[1:21:11] say this morning uh it says uh it's a
[1:21:15] it's significant influence
[1:21:18] or or it's it's something to determine
[1:21:20] the manner of the outcome of something
[1:21:23] so when you are being conditioned it it
[1:21:26] it's it's a pressure it's something
[1:21:28] that's been applied in order to to have
[1:21:31] a certain outcome
[1:21:33] and and it speaks about the similar
[1:21:35] words that could be used it's to
[1:21:37] constrain
[1:21:39] or to control to govern or to to to
[1:21:42] determine something or to decide how
[1:21:45] something is going to work out to be
[1:21:48] so when you put it in a certain
[1:21:49] condition there's a certain outcome
[1:21:51] that's expected and also
[1:21:53] i like this it says to bring something
[1:21:56] into a desired state to use it
[1:22:00] to bring something into an expected end
[1:22:04] into a desired state it's to treat it to
[1:22:07] prepare it to make it ready to radiate
[1:22:11] to in the set of readiness to temper
[1:22:14] with it to process it
[1:22:16] and and and year
[1:22:18] i was thinking about this even this
[1:22:19] morning uh yet we are
[1:22:22] you you woke up this morning
[1:22:24] you you you prepare yourself you
[1:22:26] showered yourself you got ready you took
[1:22:29] a clothes out of the closet and you took
[1:22:31] your breakfast you did whatever
[1:22:33] preparation was needed you place
[1:22:35] yourself in condition because you knew
[1:22:38] you were coming to the house of god
[1:22:40] in other words you didn't walk up this
[1:22:42] morning with your pajamas and took a cup
[1:22:44] of coffee and sat on the chair and said
[1:22:46] i was going to church
[1:22:50] that in other words if you had somebody
[1:22:52] looking at you
[1:22:54] it would be confusing but if they saw
[1:22:56] you go through the shower they saw you
[1:22:59] got your clothes ready they saw you
[1:23:01] doing all of these things automatically
[1:23:03] without you saying a word they knew that
[1:23:06] that person was getting into a condition
[1:23:09] because they're going somewhere
[1:23:12] why you put yourself in condition
[1:23:15] whatever your makeup whatever you did
[1:23:18] sure that there was an expectation of
[1:23:20] something of an action that was to take
[1:23:22] place uh and i thought about it in sense
[1:23:26] of uh perhaps in the uh wordly i was
[1:23:28] thinking about this in the sport uh
[1:23:31] mainly boxing i thought this was that a
[1:23:34] while ago i came across this and really
[1:23:37] it shocked me per se
[1:23:40] and so it was talking about there was a
[1:23:42] fight and this person lost the fight and
[1:23:45] everybody expected him to win and so
[1:23:49] i was following one of the commentator
[1:23:51] mexico and he says well you know i just
[1:23:53] looked at him when he came out and i
[1:23:55] knew he was going to lose and he said
[1:23:57] they asked him so how did you know he
[1:23:59] said oh well you know when he came out
[1:24:01] he was he was really dry you know he
[1:24:04] wasn't breaking sweat he came out so dry
[1:24:06] and that's how you know he wasn't even
[1:24:08] ready and i thought well this is
[1:24:11] interesting
[1:24:12] i said you know if i was going to a
[1:24:14] boxing match i'll try to preserve my
[1:24:17] energy all that i can so that the first
[1:24:19] punch i will give will be in the ring
[1:24:22] but no
[1:24:23] now i want you to understand this
[1:24:25] conditioning is not training training
[1:24:28] has already taken place but right before
[1:24:30] they can come out to the ring and before
[1:24:33] the match gets taught they are there in
[1:24:35] the back and just relaxing the muscles
[1:24:37] and throwing just punches and just
[1:24:39] getting ready they're there and they'll
[1:24:41] break a sweat just trying to get the
[1:24:43] combination going and all the things and
[1:24:46] they just they're shaking and just
[1:24:47] making sure that they don't get cold and
[1:24:49] everything therefore when they come into
[1:24:51] the ring oh my goodness they're just
[1:24:53] ready to go and i thought about it i
[1:24:56] said that's exactly what god is doing
[1:24:58] with us
[1:24:59] my brother my sister the quickening
[1:25:01] power is not for us to go use it over
[1:25:03] the other side oh he's wanting us to get
[1:25:06] into the ring when sickness come around
[1:25:09] you throw the punches and when something
[1:25:11] come around you throw the punches why
[1:25:13] because he's getting you conditioning
[1:25:16] for something that's about to take place
[1:25:18] he's just getting you ready he's warming
[1:25:21] the muscles he's warming everything up
[1:25:23] because if that quickening power has
[1:25:26] worked one time you are guaranteed to
[1:25:28] know that you can use it and it will
[1:25:30] work again
[1:25:32] he didn't say well i'll get my
[1:25:34] quickening power and i'll remain cold
[1:25:36] and i won't do anything and i'll wait
[1:25:39] until i get the rapture then i'll go you
[1:25:42] said no that's not how god works he
[1:25:44] wants you to move around and he wants
[1:25:47] you to go and when the enemy comes he
[1:25:49] knows how to step it and to do all those
[1:25:52] things why you are being conditioned for
[1:25:55] something that is to come
[1:25:58] oh i thought god blessed my soul and i
[1:26:01] said that's what the quickening power
[1:26:03] has been given to us for you know the
[1:26:05] scripture says it's the same thing in
[1:26:07] the end time he says that in the end
[1:26:10] time that god will send a messenger in
[1:26:13] the end time malachite 4-5 will come why
[1:26:16] because there's a bride that's about to
[1:26:18] take a flight
[1:26:19] it says in the end time even as we read
[1:26:22] it in uh first thessalonians chapter 4
[1:26:25] it says the lord himself shall descend
[1:26:28] and verbatim says when he comes down
[1:26:31] there's three things that happen
[1:26:33] he comes down with a shout he comes with
[1:26:36] the voice and then there's the trump
[1:26:38] that follow and then he says what is the
[1:26:41] shout he asks the question what is the
[1:26:43] shout it says it's the living word of
[1:26:46] god
[1:26:47] it's the living word of god calling
[1:26:49] forth the bride it's bringing foster
[1:26:52] bride in other words if the word doesn't
[1:26:55] go out the blood will not come out
[1:26:58] therefore when the word comes forth that
[1:27:00] word as it goes forth a bride has been
[1:27:03] gathered to him and when the bride is
[1:27:05] being gathered the voice is the voice of
[1:27:07] resurrection the same voice that raised
[1:27:10] up lazard and the trump is trying to
[1:27:12] take us into the wedding supper so in
[1:27:15] other words what is that doing what is
[1:27:17] the purpose of the message of the hour
[1:27:20] oh my brother my sister to get us into
[1:27:22] condition
[1:27:26] so now
[1:27:28] now listen to this
[1:27:29] he speaks here in the message abraham
[1:27:32] grace cavanaugh i just want to see if we
[1:27:35] can go through this he says
[1:27:38] and now
[1:27:39] i want to ask you
[1:27:40] something as we go on it says forgive me
[1:27:43] sisters it says it's a mixed audience
[1:27:46] it says but you listen to your doctor so
[1:27:49] i'm your brother uh he says
[1:27:52] how would an old woman
[1:27:54] a hundred years old go into labor and
[1:27:57] give birth to a child
[1:28:00] it says it's it's 45 years old
[1:28:03] it's as if a 45 year old woman went into
[1:28:06] labor today the doctors they would have
[1:28:10] respiration and everything else in there
[1:28:12] for her it says and years a woman a
[1:28:16] hundred
[1:28:17] years old
[1:28:18] about
[1:28:19] he says with no artificial respiratory
[1:28:23] uh respiration he says
[1:28:25] he had to do something
[1:28:28] he says what did he do
[1:28:30] he just met her new again
[1:28:33] prove it he says yes sir they took a
[1:28:36] trip 300 miles to guerrera and where
[1:28:41] they got they got that when they got
[1:28:42] down there this old little old grandma
[1:28:45] abimelech fell in love with her it says
[1:28:48] it says it says the most beautiful woman
[1:28:52] he ever saw
[1:28:54] abraham straight up
[1:28:55] straighten up his hair and got black
[1:28:58] again sarah became beautiful see
[1:29:01] listen to this he says he just made a
[1:29:04] new creation
[1:29:05] so they could get they could live
[1:29:07] together again like they were young men
[1:29:10] and young women he says what what was he
[1:29:13] doing
[1:29:14] he was he had to get them in condition
[1:29:17] to receive the promised son
[1:29:20] now who does the conditioning is god who
[1:29:24] has to prepare he gives you what you
[1:29:26] need in order for you to get ready he
[1:29:29] provides what is needed for you to get
[1:29:31] ready they needed a body change and we
[1:29:34] know when we read the scripture one of
[1:29:36] the things you realize quickly is it
[1:29:39] didn't it wasn't so much that sarah had
[1:29:41] to be turned young because she was young
[1:29:44] and she didn't get a child
[1:29:47] and and this is the church because sarah
[1:29:49] is a type of church but what it would
[1:29:52] take is they had to come in quickening
[1:29:54] power
[1:29:55] that actually changed the elements
[1:29:58] inside of her to give her the ability
[1:30:00] for her to have a child
[1:30:02] oh my brother my sister it takes this
[1:30:05] quickening power to change us because
[1:30:08] remember he says he continually says it
[1:30:10] on if you go in 5152 and all those
[1:30:13] things 56 and all he will talk about oh
[1:30:16] the church is here they can't they don't
[1:30:18] have enough faith for the tooth freak
[1:30:20] and they don't have
[1:30:22] you know faith for this how are we gonna
[1:30:24] have faith for the rapture how are we
[1:30:25] gonna have faith for the rapture oh but
[1:30:27] there comes a time where he begins his
[1:30:30] message change and he begins to let you
[1:30:32] know that something has happened
[1:30:35] quickening power is coming there is the
[1:30:38] revealing of the word and the end time
[1:30:40] to give you what you need in order for
[1:30:42] you to be prepared
[1:30:46] so therefore i want to say our ability
[1:30:49] to become christian is not good enough
[1:30:52] we can cry all we want that's wonderful
[1:30:55] but
[1:30:56] because and the fact that he puts the
[1:30:58] desire in there is so you can come and
[1:31:01] receive of the quickening power to bring
[1:31:03] forth the things that you desire so it's
[1:31:06] not because the scripture says it's not
[1:31:08] my mind it's not my power but it's by
[1:31:11] this quickening power that brings about
[1:31:13] the change
[1:31:18] so he continues on
[1:31:22] he says
[1:31:23] what's the next thing after the signs
[1:31:27] goes away
[1:31:28] he says god is going to condition
[1:31:31] abraham children
[1:31:33] getting ready getting them ready
[1:31:35] to receive the promised son
[1:31:38] now you're not not talking about sarah
[1:31:39] anymore he's talking about us god is
[1:31:42] going to condition abraham's children
[1:31:45] getting them ready to receive the
[1:31:47] promised son
[1:31:48] and then he says how are we going to
[1:31:51] receive it how are we going to receive
[1:31:53] it it says we can't receive
[1:31:56] we can't receive him in these bodies
[1:31:59] we're going to meet him
[1:32:01] up in the air press god forever
[1:32:03] the trumpet shall sound the dead in
[1:32:05] christ shall rise and we'll go up to
[1:32:08] meet him he says what is he doing in the
[1:32:11] last in the last sign before the
[1:32:13] transformation the last sign before the
[1:32:16] rapture he says the most the most for
[1:32:20] most anything of the atomic bomb going
[1:32:22] to destroy the world before is it
[1:32:25] screams into the tape
[1:32:27] jesus is coming which is it says which
[1:32:30] is
[1:32:31] uh we which are lives and remain
[1:32:34] shall not be shall not present or hinder
[1:32:37] them that are asleep or dead for the
[1:32:39] trump of god shall sound the dead in
[1:32:42] christ shall rise we which our lives and
[1:32:44] remains shall be changed in a moment in
[1:32:46] a twinkling of an eye it says an old man
[1:32:49] will be young an old woman will be young
[1:32:52] and will be conditioned to meet him
[1:32:56] to meet the coming promised
[1:32:59] to meet the promised coming son
[1:33:02] glory to god hallelujah the next thing
[1:33:05] in god's order
[1:33:07] so if we are being conditioned
[1:33:10] to meet the coming son
[1:33:12] and that's why this is becomes very
[1:33:14] critical to us because here he is saying
[1:33:18] there's a promise of meeting him in the
[1:33:20] air there's a promise of us coming to a
[1:33:22] place where we're going to meet him in
[1:33:24] the air there's a promise for the
[1:33:25] rapture but before the rapture can
[1:33:27] happen god is trying to change the
[1:33:30] condition he's trying to change us and
[1:33:33] get us ready into a place where we can
[1:33:35] meet him in the air and therefore in the
[1:33:38] same time that's why he sent forth
[1:33:40] malachi 4. that's why he's open up luke
[1:33:43] 17 30. that's why revelation 10 and 10
[1:33:46] and 7 has come to pass why all of those
[1:33:49] things probably says in one place that
[1:33:52] god has given us all the material here
[1:33:55] on earth for us to be ready in other
[1:33:58] words what we need to do this morning is
[1:34:01] to eat afterward is to embrace what the
[1:34:04] word says because remember what what the
[1:34:07] quickening power did
[1:34:09] is it opened up the things that were not
[1:34:12] known before
[1:34:14] it opened up your potential that you
[1:34:16] didn't even know existed
[1:34:18] yeah he is the church and the church
[1:34:21] world will come in all they can preach
[1:34:23] about is you got to get the baptism off
[1:34:25] the holy ghost you got to get the
[1:34:26] baptism of the holy ghost and that's
[1:34:28] where they stop
[1:34:30] after you receive faith and you went
[1:34:32] into justification sanctification once
[1:34:35] you reach the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:37] there was nothing else to talk about
[1:34:39] they took you right back down to
[1:34:41] repentance again
[1:34:43] oh but this messenger came on the scene
[1:34:46] there he is that one place is even
[1:34:48] saying you can have the baptism of the
[1:34:50] holy ghost and still go to hell
[1:34:52] what a confusion it was to those people
[1:34:55] why because they didn't understand that
[1:34:57] there was a new entrance being open
[1:34:59] there was a new world that was open
[1:35:02] there was a new land that was being
[1:35:04] opened that all that god has been
[1:35:06] working for everything that he's been
[1:35:09] talking about why because now
[1:35:12] is not the baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:35:15] he's talking to you about your
[1:35:17] inheritance and what you should be doing
[1:35:23] i i don't want to just have enough holy
[1:35:25] ghost to not sin and and to not lie and
[1:35:28] be satisfied that's not the calling for
[1:35:30] this time that's not the inheritance in
[1:35:33] this time this time we are called in
[1:35:36] fact the scripture says about them in
[1:35:38] the end time that they have been given
[1:35:41] power to put the devil under their feet
[1:35:46] they have been given power over death
[1:35:49] now remember in the old testament
[1:35:52] when romanum speaks it says oh they all
[1:35:54] came in and they did great wonders and
[1:35:57] all those things but there was one thing
[1:35:59] that they couldn't overcome that was
[1:36:01] power over death so all of them abraham
[1:36:04] and jacob and all of them after they'd
[1:36:07] done all that they could and after
[1:36:09] they've done great things where did they
[1:36:11] find themselves locked up
[1:36:14] because they couldn't break past the
[1:36:16] death and it just had power all but when
[1:36:19] jesus came
[1:36:21] he went into the
[1:36:22] the the place of death and he went to
[1:36:25] those that were there and it took the
[1:36:27] key and when the sting of death was put
[1:36:29] in him he took it and he swallowed it
[1:36:32] and dissolved what death was
[1:36:37] and in doing so all that was to come
[1:36:40] all that was to come he came down and he
[1:36:43] gave his life he came down and he gave
[1:36:46] them the same power that he had so they
[1:36:48] can overcome death
[1:36:52] in other words we are here
[1:36:54] to change the things and to hear to to
[1:36:58] represent the kingdom of god we are here
[1:37:01] in order to move forth and to conquer
[1:37:03] for the kingdom of god we are here as a
[1:37:06] representation of what christ is to be
[1:37:09] on the earth
[1:37:15] he says
[1:37:20] he talks
[1:37:22] here it comes and
[1:37:24] he's talking about
[1:37:27] nathaniel
[1:37:31] he's talking about being put in
[1:37:32] condition
[1:37:34] this is after philip came in
[1:37:39] so philip came to nathaniel and they
[1:37:41] called him
[1:37:45] and
[1:37:46] we know that nathaniel looked at him and
[1:37:48] he said
[1:37:49] could anything come out of nazareth
[1:37:52] asking a question
[1:37:54] is there anything that can really come
[1:37:56] out of nazareth
[1:38:00] and philip told him he says just come
[1:38:02] and see for yourself
[1:38:05] come and see for yourself
[1:38:08] you know
[1:38:10] i talked about their condition for
[1:38:12] rapture
[1:38:14] one of the things that the prophet says
[1:38:16] and i'll come to it in a moment
[1:38:19] about what's happening in the end time
[1:38:21] about the condition for rapture
[1:38:23] he says the markers will go first
[1:38:27] the markets will come out first oh
[1:38:30] there's nothing to it
[1:38:32] what is that cloud they're just talking
[1:38:33] about things they don't it's just smoke
[1:38:36] the markers will always come first
[1:38:39] oh you know i i don't believe what
[1:38:41] they're talking about oh there's no such
[1:38:43] thing as god and there's no the atheist
[1:38:46] and no you know we're talking with the
[1:38:47] young people you know the reason why the
[1:38:50] world is in the state that it is is
[1:38:52] because there's been so many fake
[1:38:54] representation of what a christian
[1:38:56] should be
[1:38:58] people calling themselves christians but
[1:39:00] they're found in all kinds of things it
[1:39:03] created the whole distrust
[1:39:07] you can talk about being a christian it
[1:39:09] becomes like being a laughingstock why
[1:39:12] because they've met so many faiths but
[1:39:14] it's in that time it's in that situation
[1:39:17] it's in that condition god says i'm
[1:39:19] gonna raise a true one
[1:39:21] i'm gonna raise one who's not gonna be
[1:39:23] like the other one i'm gonna raise one
[1:39:26] who is gonna be just like i am who's
[1:39:28] gonna be my very true representation
[1:39:31] it's in that time that god chooses it's
[1:39:33] in satan's eden
[1:39:35] at the very peak of all the same that
[1:39:38] could be that god comes and he says this
[1:39:40] is exact time that i'm going to have my
[1:39:42] bride
[1:39:43] you say well could you not pick another
[1:39:44] time he says no this is the exact time
[1:39:47] why because at the peak of what the
[1:39:49] devil can do that's where i can show my
[1:39:52] past
[1:39:56] so now he's talking about nathaniel and
[1:39:59] then he says
[1:40:00] it says
[1:40:02] he says when he looked at him it says
[1:40:04] before philip called you
[1:40:06] when you were under the tree
[1:40:09] i saw you
[1:40:10] now listen it says
[1:40:12] thou are the son of god
[1:40:14] god the king of israel
[1:40:16] he says he was willing to admit
[1:40:19] to him he was willing to admit him to be
[1:40:22] the son of god because of because of
[1:40:25] what he did
[1:40:28] jesus looked at him and he said
[1:40:30] he says
[1:40:31] because i told you
[1:40:34] and you believed
[1:40:35] it says yes
[1:40:37] he says
[1:40:38] you'll see greater things than this
[1:40:42] oh my what a favor that is given to one
[1:40:45] that believes he says he was getting in
[1:40:49] condition
[1:40:50] then to see the things
[1:40:52] you can never see anything until you get
[1:40:56] into the spirit of it
[1:40:58] as always
[1:40:59] you can never see where the christianity
[1:41:02] is right if christianity is right until
[1:41:05] the holy spirit wants saves you
[1:41:08] they don't know what they're talking
[1:41:09] about oh i don't believe this you didn't
[1:41:12] come close enough all this is not right
[1:41:14] because you didn't come close enough you
[1:41:17] come closer you let this god touch you
[1:41:20] you let this message come into you you
[1:41:22] let this god do for you what he did for
[1:41:25] me you let this god come in contact you
[1:41:28] let him touch you one time he opens up
[1:41:30] your eyes and it opens up everything for
[1:41:33] you so the thing is people are
[1:41:35] approaching it with an intellectual
[1:41:37] understanding it's just scripture to
[1:41:39] scripture or something you let that
[1:41:42] reality of god touch you and you will
[1:41:44] never be the same nobody has to tell you
[1:41:47] if this is true or not because you know
[1:41:49] that it's touch you
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:54] so it's not a matter of getting offended
[1:41:57] it's just a matter of knowing that you
[1:41:59] didn't see what i saw you didn't get
[1:42:02] touched by what i got touched with you
[1:42:04] didn't get your eyes and get open to
[1:42:06] what my eyes got open to if you saw what
[1:42:09] i saw oh we were talking about
[1:42:11] witnessing you see there's such a thing
[1:42:15] you know one of the questions that you
[1:42:17] want to know if a person is a true
[1:42:19] witness or not is you people examine
[1:42:22] when they put you up on the bench they
[1:42:25] want to see the effect of what you saw
[1:42:28] so are you a witness yeah
[1:42:31] how did you feel when you saw it
[1:42:34] nothing
[1:42:37] what did it do to you what did you think
[1:42:40] when you saw it nothing
[1:42:44] everybody's going to wonder did you
[1:42:45] really see it
[1:42:48] did you really see it did you really see
[1:42:50] did you really see what you're talking
[1:42:52] about
[1:42:53] why because the effects are enough to
[1:42:56] tell whether you are eyewitness or not
[1:42:58] the effects are enough to tell whether
[1:43:01] you are witness or not or my brother my
[1:43:03] sister i don't need the intellectual
[1:43:05] effect oh i don't need the intellectual
[1:43:08] understanding i want to change life
[1:43:11] where a person looks at me says what did
[1:43:13] you feel it says it was everything to me
[1:43:16] how did you do it changed the way i see
[1:43:19] things it changed the way i approached
[1:43:21] things it changed the way i see things
[1:43:23] why because i was touched
[1:43:31] it says
[1:43:33] you can never see
[1:43:35] where christianity whether christianity
[1:43:37] is right
[1:43:38] until the holy spirit once saved you
[1:43:41] then you can see
[1:43:44] that's where it's right
[1:43:45] he says amazing grace how sweet the
[1:43:47] sound
[1:43:48] you know i once was blind but now i see
[1:43:52] it says that's the way
[1:43:54] you have to do with divine healing you
[1:43:56] have to get into the spirit of it the
[1:43:59] holy spirit it says and let it show you
[1:44:02] and reveal himself to you
[1:44:05] when you come to that place where it's
[1:44:07] been revealed himself to you
[1:44:09] that's when you got the real
[1:44:10] understanding of what it means that's
[1:44:13] what what makes you a true weakness
[1:44:15] he says in a message my angel shall go
[1:44:18] before you he says
[1:44:20] and i want you to get close he says
[1:44:22] because
[1:44:23] you know you know you know what i'm
[1:44:25] doing and now he's speaking to a woman
[1:44:27] coming into i believe it's a prayer line
[1:44:30] it says it says i'm contacting your
[1:44:32] spirit i'm talking to you
[1:44:34] it says
[1:44:36] i want you to believe this it says
[1:44:39] i want you to believe this that god
[1:44:41] knows all things
[1:44:42] what he's trying to he says and what
[1:44:44] he's trying to do
[1:44:46] is to get you in condition to receive
[1:44:49] your healing
[1:44:51] i thought oh my
[1:44:52] that's what this whole message is all
[1:44:54] about
[1:44:55] here he is he will stand a person before
[1:44:57] him it says now i see you standing in
[1:45:00] the doctor's office and i see them
[1:45:02] examining you and and i see after you
[1:45:05] walk out i see him writing the report
[1:45:07] and and i see him right such and such
[1:45:10] and and i see you being told this and
[1:45:12] everything and and i see you walk out of
[1:45:14] that office and this is what he told you
[1:45:16] you have this is what he told you
[1:45:18] everything and it says it's not right if
[1:45:20] it's right raise your right hand and
[1:45:22] they will do so and everything oh but
[1:45:24] what is he doing it's not just for
[1:45:26] purpose to let you know something but
[1:45:29] what he's trying to you to do is
[1:45:31] bringing you into a condition why he's
[1:45:34] forcing you now he's raising your faith
[1:45:37] and it's bringing you an excuse now he's
[1:45:40] got an expected end but for him to get
[1:45:42] you in an expected hand he has to change
[1:45:45] the condition oh your condition was this
[1:45:48] is what you're told this is what your
[1:45:50] grandmother had this is what your father
[1:45:52] had this runs into the family that's the
[1:45:55] condition you are in but when you come
[1:45:57] before this god he begins to frame the
[1:45:59] condition differently he says well i see
[1:46:02] all of that i see all of that and within
[1:46:05] your mind you know no one was there when
[1:46:07] this was told to me no one saw this and
[1:46:10] if this person knows what he's talking
[1:46:12] about that means he can tell me what's
[1:46:14] to come
[1:46:15] [Applause]
[1:46:19] the reason why we can believe what's to
[1:46:22] come
[1:46:23] is because there's a perfect description
[1:46:25] of what we wear
[1:46:28] he's able to tell you what's to pass he
[1:46:30] looks at you and says now i know where
[1:46:33] you live this is your house number this
[1:46:35] is what you when you woke up this
[1:46:37] morning this is what you did and you
[1:46:39] talked and you said you will be standing
[1:46:41] in line you'll come to the prayer line
[1:46:43] and you'll be praying for such insight
[1:46:45] that was in your heart is that true you
[1:46:47] said yes so he told you what was he told
[1:46:50] you what you just did before you came
[1:46:52] therefore he can predict the future
[1:46:57] what a mighty god why condition is
[1:47:00] everything with the moment he changes
[1:47:03] the condition the outcome is changing
[1:47:10] yeah we are
[1:47:12] grew up in denomination and all we need
[1:47:14] is
[1:47:16] you are sinner
[1:47:18] you got to get right
[1:47:21] however rights you try to get you still
[1:47:23] need to get right
[1:47:28] everything it's i mean you thought
[1:47:30] yesterday you had the holy ghost
[1:47:32] and you just so happy
[1:47:34] and then next sunday you hear you don't
[1:47:36] have it
[1:47:40] it's such a confusion state and here he
[1:47:42] is and barbara calls it the cycle of
[1:47:45] revival and death that's all that was
[1:47:47] stuck in it's revival then it's death
[1:47:50] it's revival then it's death it's
[1:47:52] revival then it's death oh it took
[1:47:55] somebody to come and break the cycle
[1:47:58] and there's only one that can break the
[1:48:00] cycle and that's the lord jesus christ
[1:48:02] why because he has something that he
[1:48:04] needs to do in the end time so he comes
[1:48:07] and he breaks the cycle it says you're
[1:48:09] no longer going back why are you not
[1:48:11] going back because he goes way back he
[1:48:14] says because over here
[1:48:17] you were already this to begin with the
[1:48:20] moment you hung up for it you only
[1:48:22] identified to what was here in the
[1:48:24] beginning so if you try to go back the
[1:48:26] only place you can go back is in his
[1:48:28] mind
[1:48:32] that's what happened to us the only
[1:48:34] place we can go back is in his mind
[1:48:39] why because we go back past our parents
[1:48:41] we go back past where we were born we go
[1:48:44] back past all the things that we know
[1:48:46] why that's the quickening power in the
[1:48:48] end time
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:54] it says
[1:48:58] and god knows all things
[1:49:01] and is trying to get
[1:49:03] and it's trying to get to you
[1:49:06] so there's already an expected end
[1:49:11] now you are here just
[1:49:13] roaming in the stream of life and just
[1:49:15] toasting to and fro
[1:49:17] now he's trying to get you in position
[1:49:19] with what was already
[1:49:20] in the beginning
[1:49:22] now what was already in the beginning
[1:49:24] is manifested in what you're going to be
[1:49:26] at the end anyway but you are here in
[1:49:29] between
[1:49:30] so
[1:49:31] what when you try to look back you can
[1:49:34] only look until you were born
[1:49:36] you can only look to your parents you
[1:49:38] can only look how you were raised and
[1:49:40] that's the only identification that's
[1:49:42] the only thing you can look at but this
[1:49:45] one comes and says okay
[1:49:47] i know this he tells you about your
[1:49:48] parents he tells you about everything
[1:49:51] but it says i also know this he takes
[1:49:53] her right back past the parents he takes
[1:49:55] you about what was in the mind of god
[1:49:57] and i says now what i'm trying to do is
[1:50:00] because of all of this this was to come
[1:50:03] to this expected end i'm trying to
[1:50:05] position you to where you're coming now
[1:50:08] it's god working the past is working the
[1:50:11] future he's working the present to bring
[1:50:14] an expected hand why because unless we
[1:50:16] are brought into that condition
[1:50:19] then we won't know where we're going or
[1:50:21] how to get there the world is here to
[1:50:23] put us in condition
[1:50:27] he says here says
[1:50:29] this has kind heavenly father
[1:50:31] we thank you we thank thee tonight for
[1:50:33] the people who are willing to come and
[1:50:35] sit in a hot building like this
[1:50:38] and make a sacrifice and come it says
[1:50:42] and be inconvenient
[1:50:43] to them it says and come to hear the
[1:50:45] gospel the preaching of the gospel and
[1:50:47] see the power of the resurrection of the
[1:50:49] lord jesus christ convicted sinners in
[1:50:52] in and their sins and bring them to the
[1:50:54] reconciliation to god and i pray father
[1:50:57] that you will bless them for their
[1:50:59] effort he says many poor people
[1:51:03] sitting here tonight suffering with
[1:51:05] heart trouble cancer stomach trouble and
[1:51:08] tb and all kinds of diseases and
[1:51:10] affliction of course this crowd pushes
[1:51:12] like essen and and thinks an intense
[1:51:15] heat and the
[1:51:16] intense heat in the building it says
[1:51:19] they are suffering as you can as as they
[1:51:22] are suffering as they said he as they
[1:51:24] sit here oh god may the holy spirit come
[1:51:27] in this in his great power
[1:51:29] like he did to the children the hebrews
[1:51:32] children in the furnace in the fierce
[1:51:34] furnace and put our minds and put on
[1:51:38] and put our minds so in condition
[1:51:42] to think upon him and listen to his
[1:51:45] blessed word
[1:51:48] he says until the heat in the building
[1:51:51] will fade away
[1:51:52] and we won't think about it no more
[1:51:55] i said god i want to be in our condition
[1:51:59] i don't want to come to church and my
[1:52:02] mind is here
[1:52:03] my mind is there
[1:52:05] and i'm thinking oh what is this one
[1:52:07] thinking
[1:52:08] what is this what is that i want my mind
[1:52:10] to be so focused on him because that's
[1:52:13] how i can receive what it has in store
[1:52:15] for me it's the conditioning of the word
[1:52:18] coming and the word being preached and
[1:52:20] one receiving within the heart that's
[1:52:23] what changes the circumstance for you to
[1:52:25] look up and to expect so he can come
[1:52:27] down and do according to his word it
[1:52:29] says if we could just come by the power
[1:52:31] of the holy ghost that we renew all the
[1:52:34] faith and all the strength granted he
[1:52:36] said he says but look friends this time
[1:52:39] is coming that we are rising that we are
[1:52:42] that there is a rising church up here
[1:52:46] and he says and we can't have faith of
[1:52:49] divine healing how are we going to have
[1:52:51] faith for the rapture we've got to move
[1:52:53] up friends we've got to get out of this
[1:52:56] old and slow church condition it says
[1:52:59] that we are in and step out and launch
[1:53:02] out in the shoreline and get into
[1:53:05] somewhere where where you lose all your
[1:53:08] senses of fear and doubt and dare all
[1:53:12] things are possible brother just just be
[1:53:15] free as free as could be you've got you
[1:53:17] you've got to sail towards heaven and
[1:53:20] nothing can stir you no way
[1:53:22] it says you are done that way that's all
[1:53:25] nothing can harm you
[1:53:27] and and i want and i want us to think
[1:53:28] about even what we minister on last time
[1:53:31] it's in looking into the unseen
[1:53:34] it's in in in moving into the five
[1:53:37] senses that's why i said we are not of
[1:53:39] the flesh but we are of the spirit if we
[1:53:42] operate by the flesh we shall surely
[1:53:44] fail but if we operate by the spirit the
[1:53:48] spirit will bring us into that condition
[1:53:50] where all things are possible where god
[1:53:53] can come this morning and minister to
[1:53:55] our heart where god can come and make
[1:53:57] himself known to each individual where
[1:54:00] whatever you came down here with a need
[1:54:02] in your heart god can make it a reality
[1:54:11] now
[1:54:12] i want to change directions for a little
[1:54:14] bit
[1:54:15] we just read the scriptures
[1:54:19] but when i'm
[1:54:21] i was
[1:54:23] looking in the message
[1:54:27] ah the the brother branham speaks in the
[1:54:30] message the rapture
[1:54:34] and and we know if you if you've ever
[1:54:37] uh read that message you you understand
[1:54:41] if it has been uh told and and preached
[1:54:43] many times
[1:54:45] how that it's strange the scripture that
[1:54:47] he chooses to
[1:54:48] bring as his opening text for the
[1:54:51] rapture
[1:54:57] so he chooses psalm 27 for rapture
[1:55:00] which is very strange because
[1:55:03] one would perhaps use
[1:55:05] first thessalonians
[1:55:07] 4 as we read it this morning
[1:55:09] but here he comes and
[1:55:11] and now he's what is he doing but
[1:55:15] when he starts to speak in that message
[1:55:18] the first thing that he's trying to
[1:55:19] paint is the condition around us
[1:55:24] the condition for the rapture
[1:55:28] and even as we read in his text you
[1:55:30] begin to see very clearly
[1:55:33] he says the lord in psalm 27 1 it says
[1:55:36] the lord is my light
[1:55:39] and my salvation
[1:55:41] whom shall i fear
[1:55:43] the lord is the strength of my life
[1:55:46] of whom shall i be afraid
[1:55:49] is invoking a condition where fear is
[1:55:51] trying to be injected
[1:55:56] it's talking about a time where there's
[1:55:59] he's talking about a time where there's
[1:56:01] markers
[1:56:02] there's people saying all kinds of
[1:56:04] things he's talking about a time where
[1:56:06] men will lose their minds
[1:56:09] he's talking about a time where there's
[1:56:11] wars and he because the next verse he
[1:56:13] says when the wicked even my enemy when
[1:56:16] they come when my enemies and my four
[1:56:18] come upon me to eat up my flesh they
[1:56:21] stumble and fall and now he's talking
[1:56:23] about enemies and people trying to eat
[1:56:25] his flesh
[1:56:27] and then he says though in a whole
[1:56:28] shooting camp around me my heart should
[1:56:31] not fear the war should rise against me
[1:56:34] in this will i be confident it's not
[1:56:37] talking about a happy time
[1:56:39] it's not talking about a time where
[1:56:41] everything is easy where you are loved
[1:56:43] by all he's talking about a time of
[1:56:45] persecution where it seems like they're
[1:56:47] trying to get the best out of you
[1:56:50] and i began to think about this because
[1:56:52] it's very important we realize that
[1:56:54] the time of rapture is the time where
[1:56:57] the devil is trying to come and distract
[1:57:00] you as much as possible with anything
[1:57:03] possible so the last thing you can think
[1:57:06] of is the rapture
[1:57:09] now i i don't care whether it's family
[1:57:12] whether it's job whether it's the your
[1:57:14] responsibility whatever anything that's
[1:57:17] put above god the devil can raise it up
[1:57:20] so he can keep your focus away from
[1:57:23] rapture and that's what david is saying
[1:57:25] here my enemy is a time of rapture but i
[1:57:28] have enemies
[1:57:29] it's a time of rapture but
[1:57:31] they're trying to eat up my flesh it's a
[1:57:34] time of rapture there's wars
[1:57:36] it's a time of rapture that's just
[1:57:38] happening why it's a time it's trying to
[1:57:41] get you distracted so you can keep your
[1:57:45] mind on something else because the
[1:57:47] moment you consider those conditions you
[1:57:50] won't be focusing on the rapture
[1:57:52] but look at david it says but one thing
[1:57:54] i have desire of the lord and not which
[1:57:57] i will seek after that i may dwell in
[1:58:00] the house of the lord all the day of my
[1:58:03] life david is saying this may be going
[1:58:06] on that may be going on this may be
[1:58:08] happening over there but all my heart my
[1:58:11] desire within me is to focus on the lord
[1:58:15] if my desire is the lord my desire is to
[1:58:18] remain in the lord my desire is to do
[1:58:21] this because i know that in the time of
[1:58:24] trouble he shall hide me
[1:58:27] it says for in the time of trouble he
[1:58:30] shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:58:32] in the secret place of his tabernacle he
[1:58:35] shall hide me he says he shall set
[1:58:38] me up on the rock he says he shall set
[1:58:41] me up on the rock so here he is after
[1:58:44] the condition has been spoken after all
[1:58:46] those things and and the devil is trying
[1:58:49] to get you distracted he's trying to
[1:58:51] bring up all kinds of things they feel
[1:58:53] saying
[1:58:55] in this very time
[1:58:57] of confusion as per say
[1:59:01] it says i'll have a single heart desire
[1:59:04] that i may please the lord
[1:59:06] that was david's desire
[1:59:09] and that was his preparation for the
[1:59:11] rapture
[1:59:13] his preparation for the rapture was the
[1:59:16] lord is my light
[1:59:18] and my salvation
[1:59:20] of whom shall i fear
[1:59:22] when they
[1:59:23] when the enemy even when the when the
[1:59:26] enemy even falls when they came out to
[1:59:28] eat up on my flesh i will not fear
[1:59:30] when the war should rise against me in
[1:59:33] this will i have confidence
[1:59:35] so a one who's going in the rapture his
[1:59:38] condition is focused on one thing
[1:59:41] oh
[1:59:42] that i may dwell in the presence of god
[1:59:44] you know the enemy is the master of
[1:59:46] confusion
[1:59:47] it's the master because we understand
[1:59:49] within our minds every time we are
[1:59:52] caused to make decisions and and every
[1:59:54] day we walk up his decisions and the
[1:59:56] decisions and what he's trying to do
[1:59:58] trying to get your rapture out of your
[2:00:00] mind and i want to say this this morning
[2:00:03] that's why it's important we focus on
[2:00:04] the word it's important we realize the
[2:00:08] word has been open to us and the world
[2:00:10] is here to bring us into the right
[2:00:13] condition and the right condition is i'm
[2:00:15] here to manifest christ
[2:00:18] whether it be for my family whether it
[2:00:20] be for my job whether it be for whatever
[2:00:22] it is whatever i need to take care of
[2:00:25] i'm taking it as a sun i'm doing it as a
[2:00:28] sun why because i'm placing the lord
[2:00:31] always before me
[2:00:36] david said
[2:00:37] but but i'm says
[2:00:40] he says
[2:00:42] he's speaking about
[2:00:44] another time of confusion
[2:00:49] what i'm speaks about
[2:00:51] elijah
[2:00:55] because you have to understand
[2:00:58] it was always important that god sends
[2:01:00] his messengers
[2:01:02] because after the people have gone
[2:01:04] awhile
[2:01:05] they will find themselves right back in
[2:01:07] the condition they weren't but they were
[2:01:08] in before
[2:01:10] he will send the prophet and they will
[2:01:11] come back again he'll send the prophet
[2:01:13] he would have though they will backside
[2:01:15] and they will have to send another
[2:01:16] prophet
[2:01:17] so now he speaks about a time of elijah
[2:01:20] says
[2:01:20] a time of great confusion
[2:01:23] until people didn't even know what god
[2:01:25] to worship
[2:01:28] they didn't even know where they should
[2:01:29] go who they should worship
[2:01:32] they said but god
[2:01:33] spoke to elijah
[2:01:35] and he came and he came to balin he came
[2:01:38] to ahab and and he told them that they
[2:01:40] should come to the mount kamal
[2:01:43] the showdown
[2:01:44] it says well you know we can't keep this
[2:01:46] confusion going
[2:01:48] you go call out all your prophets
[2:01:50] and i will meet you at the mount carmel
[2:01:52] and the god who shall answer by fire
[2:01:55] that god will worship
[2:01:57] and so they gather up tonight they
[2:01:59] gather up and i want to say this it's
[2:02:01] the representation even of the time that
[2:02:03] we're living in because barbados says
[2:02:05] denomination that brought such a
[2:02:07] confusion about everything is it one god
[2:02:10] is it to god is it three god
[2:02:13] is it the baptism in the name of jesus
[2:02:14] or is it father son and holy ghost what
[2:02:17] is it it says well there's got to come a
[2:02:19] showdown
[2:02:20] the god who answers by fire let him be
[2:02:24] god he says they gather up on the
[2:02:26] mountain and here they go it says you
[2:02:28] can go first they went up and they
[2:02:31] screamed and they shouted and they cut
[2:02:33] themselves and did all kinds of things
[2:02:35] and
[2:02:36] and and you know he says when it came
[2:02:38] lunch time he came around and he says
[2:02:40] perhaps you need to scream a little
[2:02:42] louder
[2:02:43] mocking them and he says perhaps your
[2:02:44] god is on vacation you need to cry out
[2:02:47] so he can come back and they came and
[2:02:49] they screamed louder and did all kinds
[2:02:51] of things oh but it wasn't until the
[2:02:54] evening time
[2:02:55] when the evening time came he knew that
[2:02:57] this was my time and he came and says
[2:03:00] okay now let's move the altar he came
[2:03:02] and he cleaned up the altar and he put
[2:03:04] the sacrifice and he put the wood and he
[2:03:06] put everything and what madam says at
[2:03:08] one place he told them to pour water to
[2:03:11] put it until every word was soaked
[2:03:16] and the purpose was he wanted to show
[2:03:18] them
[2:03:19] that this was god in other words it's
[2:03:22] just not the fact that you can light up
[2:03:24] fire on the altar but there had to be
[2:03:27] some evidences that this is god that a
[2:03:29] man cannot do this that's why in the
[2:03:32] ministry of the son of man in this end
[2:03:34] time they can criticize all they want
[2:03:37] well you know what he preaches we don't
[2:03:39] understand though what he says lest we
[2:03:41] don't understand
[2:03:42] but when it came time for the
[2:03:43] discernment they knew that a man of
[2:03:46] flesh cannot do those things they knew
[2:03:48] there was something different about what
[2:03:50] the man was doing because he will stand
[2:03:52] there he would have the sign of the son
[2:03:55] of man in the end time where he can turn
[2:03:58] his back and begin to discern the
[2:04:00] audience people that he knew nothing
[2:04:02] about they knew that that was the sign
[2:04:05] of god
[2:04:07] put up the words they did put the
[2:04:10] sacrifice
[2:04:11] he laid it out
[2:04:13] according to the promised word
[2:04:16] and he said pour water
[2:04:18] they pour water and he soaked and he
[2:04:19] says
[2:04:20] now if god be god
[2:04:22] let him answer by fire my brother my
[2:04:25] sister the gospel that comes from god
[2:04:28] cleans
[2:04:30] provides fire is purity
[2:04:33] fire is here to cleanse fire is here to
[2:04:37] consume
[2:04:38] fire is here to click out all the things
[2:04:41] if you receive a gospel that's not
[2:04:43] cleaning you that didn't come from god
[2:04:46] that's not the god who answers by fire
[2:04:49] he says when the holy spirit dwells
[2:04:51] within your heart it will burn out all
[2:04:53] the trash
[2:04:55] it will cause you to kick out all the
[2:04:56] trash it will put you in condition for
[2:05:00] you to be a son it will put you in
[2:05:02] condition for you to manifest him oh my
[2:05:05] brother my sister this is not
[2:05:07] condemnation this morning if i have any
[2:05:10] other gospel i don't want it this is the
[2:05:12] kind of gospel i want this morning
[2:05:14] something that can change me cleans me
[2:05:17] make me something different not the same
[2:05:20] old person but someone changed
[2:05:25] the god who answers by fire and barbara
[2:05:29] says at one place for the sake of time
[2:05:31] he says he stole the same god today he
[2:05:34] hadn't changed him in a little bit if he
[2:05:37] answered by fire at that time he can
[2:05:39] answer by fire this morning if you need
[2:05:42] anything burned within you this morning
[2:05:44] he can come and burn it out the
[2:05:46] scripture says that the bride her made
[2:05:49] herself ready how did she make herself
[2:05:51] ready she's received the word
[2:05:54] my brother my sister we talk about
[2:05:56] conditioning
[2:05:57] the word
[2:05:59] the way we make ourselves ready is by
[2:06:02] obeying the word that we have been given
[2:06:05] is by us conditioning practicing and
[2:06:09] letting the word work on us letting
[2:06:12] bring out of us the things that he need
[2:06:14] for us to do
[2:06:15] let me just read this
[2:06:17] real quickly before i can close
[2:06:21] but says in the message the marriage of
[2:06:23] the lamb it says
[2:06:24] and that we know
[2:06:26] that there is going to be a bride
[2:06:28] and there is going to be a wedding
[2:06:29] supper and there's going to be a wedding
[2:06:32] sample in the sky it says that's as sure
[2:06:34] as to be
[2:06:36] as god is because it's his word and we
[2:06:39] know that those that are going to make
[2:06:42] to to that are going to make up the
[2:06:44] bride
[2:06:45] is going to be in this in his church and
[2:06:48] is going to appear before him without
[2:06:52] spot a wrinkle without it says they have
[2:06:54] the material on earth to make themselves
[2:06:57] ready you it says if you notice he says
[2:07:00] she has made ourselves ready
[2:07:03] he says now so many says
[2:07:06] if god will take evil spirit from me
[2:07:10] from drinking or from gambling
[2:07:13] or from lying or stealing i'll serve him
[2:07:17] he says
[2:07:19] but that's up to you
[2:07:21] see
[2:07:23] you got something to do
[2:07:26] they that overcome shall inherit the
[2:07:29] things
[2:07:30] they that overcome
[2:07:32] you have the power to do it
[2:07:36] now this is not condemnation let me say
[2:07:38] this this morning the church has gone
[2:07:41] from the cycle of revival as we said
[2:07:44] from oh i don't got it i need the holy
[2:07:46] ghost i don't got it now he's
[2:07:49] positioning you to a place where there's
[2:07:51] no place back to go you are what you are
[2:07:55] what were you what you were in the mind
[2:07:57] of god is saying to you now those that
[2:08:01] have received the message in the end
[2:08:03] time he's saying to you now that you
[2:08:06] have the power to do it
[2:08:09] you have the power to do it
[2:08:13] and i'm so encouraged this morning that
[2:08:15] i know i have the power to do it
[2:08:17] it's not my own power but is his power
[2:08:20] working in me so i can go to him and say
[2:08:24] god you gave me the power to do this
[2:08:27] therefore remember brother david says
[2:08:29] they've been given permission
[2:08:31] that's the one that he uses they've been
[2:08:33] given permission so they can stand there
[2:08:36] and say
[2:08:37] devil you don't belong in my house i
[2:08:40] have the power to cash you out why i
[2:08:43] have been given permission by the
[2:08:45] opening of the seals
[2:08:47] now listen it continues on it says
[2:08:51] shall i never take over god it says
[2:08:54] they have the power to do it it says but
[2:08:57] you must be willing to lay it down see
[2:09:00] she has made ourselves ready i like that
[2:09:04] word he continues on and says see
[2:09:07] god could not push you through like a
[2:09:10] little pipe
[2:09:11] put us out there on the other hand and
[2:09:13] then say
[2:09:14] blessed is he that overcome
[2:09:17] you have
[2:09:18] nothing to overcome
[2:09:21] he just pushed you through
[2:09:23] but he's got to make but but you've got
[2:09:26] to make the decision for yourself
[2:09:28] i have to make a decision for myself i'm
[2:09:32] do it says in doing that
[2:09:34] show our faith and respect to god
[2:09:41] think about it we show our faith and our
[2:09:44] respect to god by standing where he has
[2:09:48] placed us
[2:09:50] by proclaiming the things that he's want
[2:09:52] us to proclaim
[2:09:53] if he called me overcomer how can i call
[2:09:56] myself anything different
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:09:59] all i have to do is walk in the word and
[2:10:01] say
[2:10:02] you call me overcomers i'm calling forth
[2:10:05] for the manifestation of this because
[2:10:07] you have given me permission to say this
[2:10:11] you have been giving me permission to do
[2:10:13] this
[2:10:14] and walk in it he continues on and says
[2:10:17] abraham was promised a child but it was
[2:10:20] but but he says but he maintained his
[2:10:23] promise for 25 years the ups and downs
[2:10:26] and as he that he had and the temptation
[2:10:29] in those 25 days 35 years but he held
[2:10:32] the word of the promise
[2:10:35] and israel was promised a promised land
[2:10:38] but they
[2:10:39] but he says but they had to fight for
[2:10:42] every inch of it whatever the soul of
[2:10:44] your foot threads upon i have given you
[2:10:47] god said to joshua
[2:10:50] it says it was all there
[2:10:52] the land was there god gave it to them
[2:10:55] but they must fight for it
[2:10:58] it says now listen the same way it is
[2:11:01] about divine healing
[2:11:03] god
[2:11:05] god has got the power to heal you
[2:11:08] if you've got the courage to accept it
[2:11:13] i said god give me the courage
[2:11:17] god has got the power to heal you
[2:11:20] if you've got the courage
[2:11:28] god has got the power to heal you if
[2:11:30] you've got the courage to accept it
[2:11:34] but you'll fight every inch of the way
[2:11:37] god has got amazing grace to save you
[2:11:40] he will do it but you've got to fight
[2:11:43] for every inch of the way
[2:11:45] it says i've been behind the pulpit
[2:11:47] going on 31 30
[2:11:49] 31 years and every inch
[2:11:52] every inch of that has been fighting
[2:11:54] constantly it certainly has but we must
[2:11:57] fight if we must rain
[2:11:59] so we find out that the bride has made
[2:12:02] ourselves ready
[2:12:03] be willing to lay aside every weight
[2:12:06] that does so easily beset us
[2:12:09] that we might run the patients the race
[2:12:12] that is set before us we must lay aside
[2:12:15] ourselves we can't say god you came i
[2:12:18] lay myself aside we've got to do that
[2:12:23] ourselves
[2:12:25] in the sudden catching away he says
[2:12:28] some say
[2:12:29] some people say
[2:12:31] well
[2:12:32] i go to church on sunday morning i
[2:12:35] listen to a pastor which is a fine
[2:12:37] preacher that's good it says i
[2:12:40] appreciate that in you
[2:12:43] or
[2:12:44] the america
[2:12:45] the world
[2:12:47] whoever it is
[2:12:49] but it takes more than good message from
[2:12:52] a pulpit
[2:12:58] it takes your life
[2:13:00] it takes you to get ready
[2:13:03] in revelation 19 chapter says 17 19 and
[2:13:07] 17 it says the bible says speaking of
[2:13:09] the bride she made herself ready
[2:13:12] no
[2:13:13] we have the word
[2:13:17] we have to walk in obedience in the word
[2:13:20] we have to apply the token
[2:13:22] we have to have to let the word live in
[2:13:24] us we have to love the word to love the
[2:13:28] truth and let it we have to go on our
[2:13:30] knees and call those promises to be
[2:13:32] manifested
[2:13:34] sometimes we do so much preaching and so
[2:13:36] much word and very little prayer we know
[2:13:39] that it takes prayer and the word for
[2:13:42] you to bring up the promises of god to
[2:13:44] come to pass it takes you going to pray
[2:13:46] and said god you said this and i'm
[2:13:48] standing here so that what you said will
[2:13:51] come to pass and i'm not moving until it
[2:13:53] comes to pass
[2:13:56] we can go example after example in the
[2:13:59] bible people who change circumstances by
[2:14:02] going to their knees
[2:14:03] people who went and they some thought
[2:14:06] they were drunk and some called them all
[2:14:08] kinds of names but they knew in doing so
[2:14:11] that they will bring the word to come to
[2:14:13] pass
[2:14:17] the scripture says be hearer endure how
[2:14:20] do we do it we go to our knees and say
[2:14:23] god you promised me this god you said in
[2:14:26] your word this is what i'll be god you
[2:14:28] said this and and i see the promise and
[2:14:31] i see the fullness of the word being
[2:14:33] revealed i'm not staying behind whatever
[2:14:36] your word says i am and therefore i'm
[2:14:39] calling upon you i'm calling upon the
[2:14:41] spirit that spoke the word i'm calling
[2:14:44] for the spirit to come and bring the
[2:14:46] world to come to pass
[2:14:48] the word is here to put us in condition
[2:14:51] he changes both the outside and the
[2:14:53] spiritual condition so we can hunger for
[2:14:56] it oh i don't know
[2:14:58] let me just say this in this end time
[2:15:00] and even perhaps more than before
[2:15:03] there's such a hunger and a desire from
[2:15:06] the true believer to see the
[2:15:08] manifestation of the hour
[2:15:13] we're not interested just in talking
[2:15:15] about a god in history
[2:15:17] we're not interested in just talking
[2:15:19] about oh he promised it's going to come
[2:15:21] one day no we are in the time where he
[2:15:24] says today ye are the sons of god today
[2:15:28] we are sitting in heavenly places so
[2:15:30] therefore i want to call it from
[2:15:32] wherever it is in the future and bring
[2:15:34] it today
[2:15:39] it's today
[2:15:41] it says when you hear your word his word
[2:15:44] hidden not your voice if the musician
[2:15:46] could come
[2:16:03] it says
[2:16:06] and when the bride
[2:16:08] because i want you to remember
[2:16:12] the rapture
[2:16:15] is only for the elected few
[2:16:23] rapture
[2:16:25] is only for those that are
[2:16:27] members of the bride
[2:16:30] who are talking in some way asking well
[2:16:33] how about someone who's in the
[2:16:34] nomination and
[2:16:36] if they receive the holy spirit then
[2:16:40] it's not up to us to judge who's going
[2:16:42] to be saved and who's not
[2:16:44] there will be those that will be in by
[2:16:46] the white throne judgment
[2:16:47] that's god's choosing
[2:16:50] but they are those that are coming from
[2:16:52] the message of the hour
[2:16:55] they are a selected few who's heard the
[2:16:58] voice of the seventh angel
[2:17:01] as he began to sound of the trumpet as
[2:17:04] he began to sound of his message as he
[2:17:06] began to call forth prabhupada says the
[2:17:09] living word of god the living bread of
[2:17:12] life
[2:17:13] bringing forth the bride
[2:17:15] as the word is going forth there's a
[2:17:18] selected view that are gathering there's
[2:17:21] a selected few that are saying i heard
[2:17:22] my name being called there's a selected
[2:17:25] viewer says that's me that is calling
[2:17:27] there's a selected view that says that's
[2:17:29] me that's me that's me that is calling
[2:17:32] the description that he gave that was my
[2:17:34] description what he talked about the
[2:17:36] past that was me when he called and he
[2:17:39] says you came from this this is your
[2:17:41] address that was me
[2:17:42] and now that he told me the past and the
[2:17:44] present he's the same intelligence that
[2:17:47] told the tree to hide his life in winter
[2:17:50] he's the same intelligence that told the
[2:17:52] geese to fly and go out when the season
[2:17:55] changed all that same intelligence is
[2:17:58] here tonight this morning to speak to us
[2:18:00] and to let us know what direction are we
[2:18:03] going
[2:18:06] rapture ready
[2:18:08] oh i want to be so light but when it
[2:18:10] says fly one place that we are heavy we
[2:18:13] we carry the burdens of the world and
[2:18:15] you know we we have this and we have
[2:18:17] this and and pretty soon we get
[2:18:19] depressed and we need a vacation we come
[2:18:22] back we are depressed from the vacation
[2:18:24] we pick up where we left off it's a
[2:18:26] complete mess
[2:18:30] oh but there's a place by me he says
[2:18:33] there's a hiding place david says
[2:18:35] that in the time of trouble
[2:18:37] he shall hide me
[2:18:40] he shall provide a place for me to be
[2:18:42] when the world is falling apart when
[2:18:45] everything seems to just go sideways
[2:18:47] where there is trouble on every side
[2:18:49] where we are persecuted when there's
[2:18:52] churches shutting down where there's all
[2:18:54] kinds of people falling away in that
[2:18:56] time
[2:18:57] it will hide me in the secret place
[2:19:00] of his tabernacle he shall hide me
[2:19:03] it says and then my head shall be lifted
[2:19:05] up above my enemies
[2:19:07] he shall set me up upon the rock
[2:19:11] upon a revelation he didn't say well i
[2:19:14] will set myself upon the rock
[2:19:16] remember when the opening of the says oh
[2:19:18] i just want to stop but just excuse me
[2:19:21] this was a place that man has never
[2:19:23] stood before remember when the sword
[2:19:26] came remember the pyramid it was a place
[2:19:29] that man has never been before we were
[2:19:31] standing on the rock of ages
[2:19:34] a place where we've never been before
[2:19:37] what is he doing he's saying
[2:19:39] you i'm your hiding place
[2:19:42] you don't have to fear
[2:19:44] you don't have to worry
[2:19:46] i predestined it all things
[2:19:48] and i am changing the conditions
[2:19:51] because there's a condition that you got
[2:19:53] to come into
[2:19:55] where the desires of the world have
[2:19:56] fallen off where the only thing you're
[2:19:59] desiring is me
[2:20:02] i feel like sometimes we are so attached
[2:20:04] to the world that that god is just have
[2:20:06] to come and cut those strings off
[2:20:11] you know
[2:20:12] the pandemic struck here and
[2:20:15] you know we felt like we're about to
[2:20:17] lose our jobs and then we started adding
[2:20:19] up i lose my job i lose my home i lose
[2:20:22] my car i lose this i lose this oh my
[2:20:24] what's gonna happen
[2:20:25] we forget that there's a hiding place
[2:20:27] for us
[2:20:31] we are not of the flesh
[2:20:34] we are off the spirit
[2:20:36] and then he says if you walk in the
[2:20:38] spirit you shall not fulfill the desires
[2:20:41] of the flesh but if ye are carnally
[2:20:44] minded
[2:20:45] it's enmity to god let's all stand
[2:20:48] tonight this morning amen
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:56] i want to be spiritually minded this
[2:20:58] morning
[2:21:00] i want everything about me to be
[2:21:01] spiritual
[2:21:05] in fact i want even everything that
[2:21:07] naturally comes at me
[2:21:09] the only way i look at it is spiritual
[2:21:12] you're losing your mind that's fine
[2:21:15] i probably am better off that way than i
[2:21:17] am this way
[2:21:21] because the more we look at carnally
[2:21:24] the more we don't understand
[2:21:26] but spiritually is the way we've been
[2:21:28] given let's just bow our heads this
[2:21:30] morning
[2:21:31] our gracious father we're so thankful
[2:21:33] lord for everything you do for us
[2:21:37] lord to know that
[2:21:42] you are making the condition necessary
[2:21:45] for us
[2:21:46] to be ready
[2:21:51] father the scripture speaks about the
[2:21:52] children of israel who said
[2:21:55] that when they started crying
[2:21:59] when they were in egypt
[2:22:04] when they begin to call out
[2:22:08] when they got into a condition where
[2:22:10] they didn't like what they were seeing
[2:22:11] around them
[2:22:15] when the egyptian afflicted them and
[2:22:19] it said then they began to cry for the
[2:22:20] promise
[2:22:23] but your messenger comes around and he
[2:22:25] says
[2:22:28] you are not changing us by the
[2:22:30] circumstances of the world
[2:22:32] in fact it says
[2:22:36] that the world council of churches and
[2:22:39] the forces of the world
[2:22:42] it says it will lead the church into the
[2:22:48] into the world council of churches
[2:22:52] but he says it's the power of god
[2:22:55] that's going to bring us up
[2:22:57] and i believe your word is here
[2:23:00] changing our circumstances lord
[2:23:03] opening our eyes to see the things which
[2:23:05] was doing in this end time

[2:23:11] understanding
[2:23:15] letting us know the things

[2:23:42] are weak
[2:23:44] you strengthen us and give us one more
[2:23:46] chance lord

[2:23:50] and claim our victory lord
