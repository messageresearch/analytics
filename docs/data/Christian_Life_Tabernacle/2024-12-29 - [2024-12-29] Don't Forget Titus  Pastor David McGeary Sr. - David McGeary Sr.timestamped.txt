[1:04:53] times and in diverse manner
[1:04:56] spake in times past unto the fathers by
[1:05:00] the
[1:05:01] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[1:05:05] unto us by his son whom he hath
[1:05:09] appointed heir of all things but whom
[1:05:14] also he had made the worlds who being
[1:05:18] the brightness of his glory and the
[1:05:22] expressed image of his person
[1:05:26] and upholding All Things by the word of
[1:05:30] his
[1:05:31] power when he hath by himself purged our
[1:05:36] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[1:05:40] Majesty on high being made so much
[1:05:46] better than the angels as he hath by
[1:05:51] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:05:54] Name than they For unto which of the
[1:05:59] Angels For unto which of the Angels said
[1:06:04] he at any time Thou Art my
[1:06:09] son this day have I begotten thee and
[1:06:14] again I will be to him a father and he
[1:06:19] shall be to me a son and again when he
[1:06:26] bringeth in the
[1:06:28] firstborn into the world he said let all
[1:06:32] the angels of God worship him our
[1:06:36] gracious father we ask you to bless our
[1:06:40] service this morning in Jesus precious
[1:06:43] name we pray amen amen you may be
[1:06:51] seated we want to look at uh this
[1:06:55] scripture and it says who being the
[1:06:58] brightness of his glory and the
[1:07:01] expressed image of his person and I I
[1:07:05] want to just to Fellowship a little bit
[1:07:07] this morning I I received uh uh some
[1:07:12] quotes and and uh they inspired me and
[1:07:16] uh looking at the sermon uh with the
[1:07:20] passing of brother Mariam
[1:07:23] expressions and uh
[1:07:26] the
[1:07:28] uh brother BR made this statement he
[1:07:30] says there is so much of life that's
[1:07:35] Expressions
[1:07:37] expressing and the definition of
[1:07:39] expression is to convey a thought or a
[1:07:43] feeling or to show what you think or
[1:07:47] what you feel and so uh life is an
[1:07:51] expression we we don't uh realize it but
[1:07:56] uh we're we're always expressing
[1:08:00] something you know uh we we even know
[1:08:03] that the the whole beauty of of the Lord
[1:08:08] Jesus being the expressed love of God
[1:08:12] that God so loved the world he expressed
[1:08:16] that Love To Us by giving us his only
[1:08:20] begotten son and so we we says that
[1:08:24] Jesus was was you know God's expression
[1:08:27] of love but what was that what was he
[1:08:31] expressing he came down and he
[1:08:33] identified himself as one of us and and
[1:08:38] the purpose of doing that is so that he
[1:08:40] could express to us that he knows what
[1:08:44] we feel he knows what we're going
[1:08:48] through we have an
[1:08:50] identity with him that that he was
[1:08:54] tempted in every way that I was tempted
[1:08:57] so when you feel weak he he knows what
[1:09:01] you're going through he knows what the
[1:09:05] failures is he he knows when you feel
[1:09:09] broken and that's why he came to bind up
[1:09:13] the Brokenhearted he he knows when
[1:09:15] you're discouraged you know what I mean
[1:09:18] I I always I always chuckle uh when I
[1:09:22] hear that song about Santa Claus you
[1:09:26] know he knows what you're thinking he
[1:09:29] knows when you're asleep he knows if
[1:09:31] you've been good or bad you know and
[1:09:34] like like he knows everything I I I
[1:09:36] thought you know isn't that just what
[1:09:39] the devil tried to do with Christmas is
[1:09:42] take it off the Lord and and give all
[1:09:45] those attributes to some guy that in a
[1:09:48] red suit that goes down a chimney and
[1:09:52] that it just expresses to you how
[1:09:54] ignorant man really can be you know what
[1:09:58] I mean that they'd want to Pedal that to
[1:10:01] their children and pedal that to the
[1:10:04] world when the truth is so much better
[1:10:07] you know I would rather know that
[1:10:09] there's someone that's really real and
[1:10:12] really alive that knows what I feel that
[1:10:15] suffered sickness like I suffered
[1:10:17] sickness that was weary like I I was
[1:10:21] weary that was tempted the way that I
[1:10:24] was tempted so somebody that that could
[1:10:26] put his arm around me and say I know
[1:10:29] what you're going through I I know what
[1:10:32] what trials you have uh so it's been an
[1:10:35] expression he was the expression of
[1:10:38] God's love he was the expression of of
[1:10:41] the uh expressed image of God in other
[1:10:44] words he was the expression of God's
[1:10:47] feelings and and and and love for us and
[1:10:52] knowing what we're going through he
[1:10:55] Express that identity to us he he's he's
[1:10:59] he's not our enemy he's our friend you
[1:11:03] know Satan's always trying to make God
[1:11:06] our enemy boy you better be right you
[1:11:08] know else you know he's going to get you
[1:11:12] no he's there for you he's always there
[1:11:16] for us he he's there to do for us
[1:11:19] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[1:11:23] can ask or think so you when you begin
[1:11:26] to to to approach it it it it's an
[1:11:30] expression and and you know our Our
[1:11:33] Lives Express things God's always been
[1:11:36] trying to express to man he expressed to
[1:11:39] been trying to show men there's life
[1:11:41] after
[1:11:43] death that that that there there's this
[1:11:46] is not the whole substance of everything
[1:11:50] that God is our little 80 90 70 whatever
[1:11:55] years are allotted to us that's not the
[1:11:58] whole sum and substance what God is this
[1:12:02] portion of our life is not the full
[1:12:06] substance of what we are we were before
[1:12:13] here we were before here we we we were
[1:12:17] in his thinkings we were in his plan we
[1:12:21] were we were part of his expression then
[1:12:24] there became came a time when he spoke
[1:12:27] it there became a time and this is just
[1:12:30] a a a a small uh time frame and then we
[1:12:35] know that that there's life after this
[1:12:39] life so the the we we get caught up so
[1:12:43] many times in the 50 60 70 years uh some
[1:12:47] people haven't even been given that time
[1:12:50] on life many a young child has passed
[1:12:53] away many a baby only had a few days on
[1:12:57] this Earth just a a short time of
[1:13:00] expression but this is not the whole
[1:13:02] picture right and God tries to express
[1:13:06] that to us but he did it in the sun
[1:13:09] rising and coming up and the whole
[1:13:13] pattern of life is just expressed right
[1:13:15] before us and it sets and it rises again
[1:13:19] it does it with the trees it it it does
[1:13:22] it in nature we can see it all around
[1:13:25] around the day and the night the the the
[1:13:28] winter and the representing this the
[1:13:30] spring of Life the seed and leaves
[1:13:33] falling off going in the ground the tree
[1:13:36] springing up again that it's all an
[1:13:39] expression it it's
[1:13:42] God relaying to us or conveying his
[1:13:47] thoughts and feelings that's what to
[1:13:49] express means is to convey your thoughts
[1:13:53] a and feelings you you can't express
[1:13:56] something unless there's something
[1:13:58] behind it to express you know maybe
[1:14:02] sometimes you express your
[1:14:04] disappointment sometime you express uh
[1:14:07] your
[1:14:08] frustration sometime you express
[1:14:11] different feelings that you have we're
[1:14:14] we're very proned in our weaknesses to
[1:14:18] express our our feelings and and it it's
[1:14:22] a great challenge in life to bring that
[1:14:26] under subjection and to control you know
[1:14:30] some of us are a little more hot-headed
[1:14:32] than others and and and you know we got
[1:14:35] short fuses you know and our Expressions
[1:14:39] come a lot quicker and a lot faster and
[1:14:42] a lot harder you know what I mean but
[1:14:45] nevertheless if you if we can begin to
[1:14:49] understand that everything about God was
[1:14:53] expressing God had thoughts thoughts
[1:14:56] right and then to express those thoughts
[1:14:59] a word is a thought expressed so he
[1:15:03] expressed what he was thinking and he
[1:15:06] put it in word form so he said what he
[1:15:09] was going to do he said let there be so
[1:15:13] he had a thought in his mind of what
[1:15:16] light was and so he said let there be
[1:15:20] and and then when light appeared then we
[1:15:23] knew what the interpret ation of that
[1:15:26] was because the expression now became
[1:15:30] manifested and we can see it and so what
[1:15:33] we do is we have a thought we have a
[1:15:36] feeling and that's within us and all of
[1:15:38] a sudden we express that and so that
[1:15:43] expression is conveying or telling
[1:15:46] everybody around us what we
[1:15:49] think what we
[1:15:52] feel and that what life is and and so I
[1:15:59] I realize that we're all
[1:16:02] here for a
[1:16:06] purpose and Jesus had a purpose and it
[1:16:09] was to express God's thoughts and
[1:16:16] feelings that he had in his heart to
[1:16:20] express them to us so he became the
[1:16:23] expressed image of God he became the
[1:16:26] feelings of God the thoughts of God God
[1:16:29] so loved us that he gave his son God
[1:16:32] wanted to forgive us of our sins so he
[1:16:35] paid the price for us he everything he
[1:16:38] wanted to
[1:16:39] share his life with us so he sent his
[1:16:43] spirit it's hard to believe that men
[1:16:45] would reject that that they would reject
[1:16:48] the love of God that they'd reject the
[1:16:51] spirit of God that that they would that
[1:16:55] they wouldn't want to come into
[1:16:56] fellowship with him that that they
[1:16:59] wouldn't want to have the joy
[1:17:01] unspeakable full of Glory it's amazing
[1:17:03] that people would take a substitute you
[1:17:06] know they're they're searching for it
[1:17:08] they're hungering for it you know why do
[1:17:11] you think you go by a liquor store and
[1:17:13] they call it
[1:17:16] Spirits we they might as well put the
[1:17:18] sign up there substitute for the Holy
[1:17:23] Spirit you can get in this bottle peace
[1:17:27] you can get deliverance from depression
[1:17:30] you can you can feel
[1:17:32] good for a a a few hours you you know
[1:17:37] what I mean why don't they put it on a
[1:17:40] drugstore you know substitute for the
[1:17:43] word of God here take a pill you know
[1:17:47] that'll take care of the word of God God
[1:17:51] has given us he he's expressed to us
[1:17:54] that I love you amen I know how you feel
[1:17:59] I want to walk with you I won't leave
[1:18:01] you or forsake you I'll be with you even
[1:18:05] to the end I'm going to take this
[1:18:07] journey with you uh when when you're
[1:18:09] down I'll be there you know when you're
[1:18:12] going through good times I'll Rejoice
[1:18:15] with you when you're going through sad
[1:18:17] times I'll suffer with you it the the
[1:18:20] whole thing is a great expression uh of
[1:18:24] what it is now can you imagine just
[1:18:27] sitting back and and putting your your
[1:18:31] head in the sand and say God's not
[1:18:33] expressing
[1:18:36] nothing that's what Peter said you
[1:18:38] everybody says oh where's the signs of
[1:18:40] is coming everything goes on the way he
[1:18:43] said now just
[1:18:46] remember God's not slack concerning his
[1:18:49] promises the time will come
[1:18:54] CU not on our
[1:18:57] time but man will disease this world to
[1:19:00] death he'll blow this world to death
[1:19:03] he'll drive people insane I mean think
[1:19:06] what's going on in our country uh just
[1:19:09] the there there's something else that's
[1:19:12] being expressed how does a man go light
[1:19:15] somebody on
[1:19:16] fire in a subway car what if that
[1:19:21] doesn't tell you demons
[1:19:24] are now expressing
[1:19:27] themselves they're coming out of the
[1:19:31] woodwork people are killing one another
[1:19:33] stealing robbing gangs are going through
[1:19:37] apartment complexes you know you can sit
[1:19:39] back and say oh you know I'm going to
[1:19:43] live in my
[1:19:44] bubble but you're missing the
[1:19:50] expression the Satan and the world is
[1:19:53] expressing what's really going
[1:19:57] on we knew these Expressions would be
[1:20:01] here we knew the thoughts and the
[1:20:03] feelings of what Satan had in mind would
[1:20:07] one day manifest themselves he told us
[1:20:10] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[1:20:14] it be in the coming of the son of man as
[1:20:16] it was in the days of Noah when they
[1:20:18] were married and given into marriage we
[1:20:21] we see these things we see the same
[1:20:24] Spirits at work what that's an
[1:20:27] expression on that if I could use the
[1:20:30] saying that's an expression on this side
[1:20:33] of the
[1:20:35] fence people doing things to people that
[1:20:38] are totally unjust without without any
[1:20:44] real
[1:20:46] process they'll do it it it's because
[1:20:49] their their
[1:20:52] minds have been taken over
[1:20:56] because they they they haven't
[1:20:59] connected with the understanding that
[1:21:03] their lives are expressing something and
[1:21:06] the question comes to us what is it that
[1:21:11] we want to
[1:21:14] express I'm not interested in expressing
[1:21:17] a certain
[1:21:19] political
[1:21:21] agenda I I I don't want to express woke
[1:21:26] you know but I'm I'm not I don't want to
[1:21:28] express you know I I I don't want to
[1:21:30] express you know make America great
[1:21:33] again why am I going to want to express
[1:21:35] make America great again when a prophet
[1:21:39] full of the spirit of God none other
[1:21:42] than deity dwelling in them said that
[1:21:45] this place is
[1:21:49] gone I'm not interested in expressing
[1:21:52] America
[1:21:55] that's but I've got to come to
[1:21:58] Consciousness what is it that I'm
[1:22:01] expressing am I expressing the American
[1:22:08] dream you know I'm going to go out and
[1:22:10] get a house I'm going to get a car I'm
[1:22:12] going to get a good job I'm going to get
[1:22:14] a big retirement I'm G to have a a
[1:22:17] program I'm going to take
[1:22:20] vacations
[1:22:21] uh what is it
[1:22:25] what is
[1:22:26] it that my
[1:22:30] life is
[1:22:33] conveying and
[1:22:35] expressing what I
[1:22:40] feel is is if if my life is full of
[1:22:44] depression if my life is is full of
[1:22:48] discouragement then I'm expressing I
[1:22:51] don't believe there's any hope
[1:22:55] amen it becomes an expression of a of a
[1:22:59] hope if I if I don't like where I'm
[1:23:02] living I don't like what my job is I
[1:23:05] don't like this I don't like that you
[1:23:07] know may maybe it's expression that that
[1:23:11] you haven't found something that makes
[1:23:13] you
[1:23:16] happy but if you knew you were going to
[1:23:20] heaven and you knew any day now you knew
[1:23:24] you you had the mansion that everybody's
[1:23:27] looking
[1:23:30] for you say how big's your Mansion my
[1:23:33] Mansion is
[1:23:35] 15,000 miles
[1:23:38] across 1,500 wide 15 this way 15 that
[1:23:43] way 15 this way 15 up 15 down you figure
[1:23:47] out how many square feet it
[1:23:51] is that's my mansion
[1:23:55] that's the one I
[1:23:57] possess now am I expressing
[1:24:01] that so I I if if if I could just lay
[1:24:05] that down to you and then I would like
[1:24:08] to give you the the uh my sermon
[1:24:14] title and it's called don't forget
[1:24:21] Titus and you know Titus is quite
[1:24:24] a
[1:24:26] book little three chapter book of a
[1:24:29] letter that he wrote to
[1:24:33] Titus but Paul when he writes this
[1:24:36] letter to Titus he's reminding Titus why
[1:24:40] that he sent Titus I believe to cre is
[1:24:45] is where that he he he sent him and
[1:24:51] uh and and so he he goes through there
[1:24:55] uh yeah cre c r e te I think that's cre
[1:25:00] he says for this cause left IV in
[1:25:04] cre so he's reminding Paul of the
[1:25:09] purpose that he was sent to cre and what
[1:25:14] it was that he
[1:25:19] wanted Titus to express
[1:25:26] what it was what Titus why are you here
[1:25:30] what are the purpose that you're in cre
[1:25:34] the purpose that I have left you in De
[1:25:36] creete is to he wanted to ordain Elders
[1:25:40] he wanted to spread the gospel he wanted
[1:25:44] to to pick things so he had a purpose in
[1:25:48] expressing to cre through the people of
[1:25:53] God the things that God was and
[1:25:57] is and if I could take that we won't be
[1:26:01] long this morning but I'd like to go and
[1:26:05] pick
[1:26:07] up Paul letter to
[1:26:12] Titus and start reading in the second
[1:26:15] chapter and then we will bring this down
[1:26:20] now we're talking about
[1:26:22] expression so Paul is going to start
[1:26:25] writing to Timothy things that are
[1:26:29] important in our
[1:26:31] life because they
[1:26:34] express so how many of we've heard this
[1:26:37] saying our actions speak louder than our
[1:26:41] words our life
[1:26:45] choices you understand Express and
[1:26:49] there's if you keep let's say you had
[1:26:51] opportunity and and you kept it at
[1:26:54] choosing work over church now sometimes
[1:26:58] you you have to choose work over church
[1:27:00] I'm not going to try to go through
[1:27:02] scenarios sometimes your Ox is in the
[1:27:05] ditch but if all you do is is is work on
[1:27:10] that
[1:27:13] Ox then you're expressing to me that Ox
[1:27:18] is more valuable to you and it's more
[1:27:22] important to you to get that Ox out of
[1:27:25] the ditch than anything which tells me
[1:27:28] your first love is that
[1:27:32] Ox that's what you want to preserve
[1:27:35] that's what you want to take care of
[1:27:38] that's your nest egg that's your hope
[1:27:41] that's what your life's depending on you
[1:27:44] could call that Ox anything you want to
[1:27:46] do a lot of times it's a job a lot of
[1:27:49] times it's a possession but it doesn't
[1:27:51] matter but you no matter what you say
[1:27:54] I love God praise God Ox
[1:28:00] time your your
[1:28:03] real
[1:28:07] feeling and your real
[1:28:10] thoughts are
[1:28:13] expressed
[1:28:16] in your
[1:28:21] action if if you're afraid
[1:28:24] some people have Financial
[1:28:28] fear they if they don't have enough
[1:28:30] money in the bank if they don't have
[1:28:32] that cushion if they can't make that car
[1:28:35] payment if they can't make that rent
[1:28:38] they they they they they they're they're
[1:28:41] driven they'll make the choices that
[1:28:44] cover those
[1:28:47] bases because they don't
[1:28:51] trust they don't they don't they don't
[1:28:54] they're expressing I don't think that if
[1:28:57] I make a different choice that God will
[1:28:59] cover
[1:29:02] this they they don't realize
[1:29:05] it but but we we become an expression
[1:29:09] God put all of nature around us to
[1:29:14] express his glory that's right the the
[1:29:17] scriptures written in the skies the
[1:29:19] invisible things of God are clearly seen
[1:29:24] by the visible things around us so it's
[1:29:27] all became a great big expression that
[1:29:31] we're living in like the little boy and
[1:29:34] the fishing with the man on the boat he
[1:29:38] said you know Granda can you show me God
[1:29:41] and and he he said look around you he
[1:29:45] said I see God
[1:29:51] everywhere well if you saw God
[1:29:53] everywhere
[1:29:56] there would be part of your
[1:29:59] life part of your
[1:30:01] experience part of your atmosphere part
[1:30:04] of your
[1:30:06] nature that would express it you know
[1:30:10] everything's
[1:30:12] okay you might get
[1:30:14] weary but you're not going to
[1:30:19] quit you might fall
[1:30:22] down but but you're going to get
[1:30:25] up cuz your expression is I'm going to
[1:30:29] keep running this race I I've got to
[1:30:32] finish this race I know there's a a goal
[1:30:35] at the end I want to run I I want to
[1:30:38] succeed I I want to be a
[1:30:41] Christian but if it's
[1:30:47] lukewarm you know what lukewarm is is is
[1:30:50] equal cold and is equal hot
[1:30:54] you know 5050 God 5050 the world and it
[1:30:58] becomes a big beautiful blend that's
[1:31:01] nickol
[1:31:03] lism that's lady oan
[1:31:07] ISM and that's what we've got to
[1:31:10] overcome we've got to overcome lady oia
[1:31:14] we've got to overcome the natural
[1:31:18] expression of our human nature in our
[1:31:22] life as John said herein is the love of
[1:31:26] God made perfect that he as he is so are
[1:31:30] we in this
[1:31:35] world so now
[1:31:38] Titus Paul's telling
[1:31:40] Titus to start to instruct the people
[1:31:44] and why is he instructing the people
[1:31:47] because what the people's actions are
[1:31:52] are an expression and we we'd like just
[1:31:54] to bring this out if if you you get a
[1:31:58] chance to read him he's talking to him
[1:32:01] avoid the crans avoid their their this
[1:32:04] they're that they're lazy they're
[1:32:06] they're all these things he's warning
[1:32:09] them what do he War don't let their
[1:32:12] attitude their way of life their
[1:32:18] complacency the spirit in which they do
[1:32:21] things don't let that spirit
[1:32:24] get on you because if it does you will
[1:32:28] not
[1:32:30] express the true reality of what it
[1:32:34] means to be born
[1:32:36] again and you know something a Christian
[1:32:40] never has to
[1:32:46] worry there's no virtue in worry there's
[1:32:49] no strength in worry if you got sick
[1:32:53] what what are you going to do worry
[1:32:55] you're going to
[1:32:56] die to die is
[1:33:01] gain it's
[1:33:04] victory we pass from this life to
[1:33:09] another it it it it it it's not the end
[1:33:13] of it it's a
[1:33:16] change death isn't the finish of
[1:33:18] anything is the change of One Life to
[1:33:22] another brother Mary just
[1:33:25] changed from the life he had here the
[1:33:28] years allotted him here to the rest of
[1:33:32] time that was allotted to him he was in
[1:33:36] he was where where were
[1:33:39] you when the sons of God rejoiced before
[1:33:44] the foundation of the world it's hard
[1:33:46] for you to believe that you were it that
[1:33:48] you were
[1:33:52] rejoicing you were there because when if
[1:33:55] God thought it it's
[1:33:57] real but you didn't know it just like
[1:34:00] you were in the loins of your father you
[1:34:02] were in your mother you you were in your
[1:34:05] father but you didn't know it until you
[1:34:08] showed up now you showed up in this
[1:34:11] little space of time but this little
[1:34:14] space of time is not what you are you're
[1:34:17] more than that you're bigger than that
[1:34:21] you have a bigger expression than that
[1:34:23] amen we don't have to just Express the
[1:34:27] the carnal side of Our Lives why don't
[1:34:29] we express the Eternal side of Our
[1:34:34] Lives the Eternal
[1:34:38] reality that we
[1:34:43] possess all we do is Express this dumb
[1:34:50] flesh 50 years ago you think that would
[1:34:54] be hard for me to put on my
[1:34:57] socks I could stand my socks up and jump
[1:35:00] out of bed and land right in my
[1:35:04] socks and now my arms have got
[1:35:07] short and my feet have got far away and
[1:35:11] I bend over and I'm
[1:35:16] groaning get my back stiff and my knee
[1:35:19] won't come up I got something SC stuck
[1:35:21] in between my knee and my foot and and
[1:35:24] andless he'll get so upset she says you
[1:35:27] want me to put help put your socks I'm
[1:35:29] for you she got such sympathy for
[1:35:34] me I don't you think this is what I want
[1:35:37] to express uh I got a new man coming I
[1:35:42] got a new body hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:45] this ain't me this Old Rag is is
[1:35:50] gone but I've got one waiting for me
[1:35:54] he's young and
[1:35:56] handsome well maybe I'm old and ugly but
[1:35:59] one day I'm going to be young and
[1:36:01] handsome praise
[1:36:04] God so let's just take our lesson this
[1:36:07] morning and and grow because our
[1:36:10] Messengers taught us so many of these
[1:36:14] things he's thought he's saying now he
[1:36:17] said let's re read 1 and 16 as we go
[1:36:22] through they Pro they
[1:36:25] profess that they know
[1:36:29] God but in
[1:36:32] works
[1:36:34] and but in
[1:36:37] Works they deny
[1:36:41] him being abominable and disobedient
[1:36:46] unto every good work
[1:36:50] reprobate so right now he's saying that
[1:36:53] even though they profess they know
[1:36:57] God their their
[1:37:01] expression proves
[1:37:08] otherwise you can say you're saved but
[1:37:11] if you're miserable you ain't
[1:37:17] saved when you're saved you can say life
[1:37:20] is miserable my body is miserable but
[1:37:24] inside the joy Bells Are
[1:37:27] Ringing Hallelujah even so come quickly
[1:37:31] Lord
[1:37:33] Jesus if if when you know
[1:37:37] him he's all your glory so you you don't
[1:37:41] have to prove the man you're wealthy you
[1:37:43] don't have to prove the man you're
[1:37:45] successful you you know what I mean I
[1:37:48] always thought in my day there was a guy
[1:37:50] called the I guess he was the the the
[1:37:54] M Sha of Aran or whatever he was he he
[1:37:57] had a hospital he every place he
[1:38:01] flew he he brought a complete hospital
[1:38:06] he had a
[1:38:08] 747 I guess was the biggest plane in
[1:38:11] that day full
[1:38:13] surgical operating room with every
[1:38:18] medicine full team of heart specialists
[1:38:22] internal Med down special every place he
[1:38:25] went he had a score of doctors and
[1:38:28] nurses where do you think he is
[1:38:31] today he's dead as a door
[1:38:38] now you think he's going to change
[1:38:42] that he wanted to
[1:38:46] stay we don't want to
[1:38:48] stay we want to go but we need to
[1:38:52] express to the world there's a place to
[1:38:55] go
[1:38:56] to if if you're living miserable then it
[1:38:59] just shows you that you don't believe
[1:39:02] there's something better
[1:39:04] coming so what we're talking about is
[1:39:07] becoming conscious of our expression
[1:39:10] don't forget
[1:39:11] Titus let us
[1:39:14] read but speak thou the things which
[1:39:19] becometh sound Doctrine
[1:39:25] speak those things which becometh sound
[1:39:29] Doctrine he's talking about
[1:39:31] expression that the Aged
[1:39:34] men be sober grave temperate sound in
[1:39:41] faith in charity in
[1:39:45] patience because if they do these things
[1:39:48] they're expressing
[1:39:50] something the Aged woman likewise that
[1:39:53] they be in Behavior as becoming becometh
[1:40:00] Holiness not false
[1:40:02] accusers not given too much wine
[1:40:06] teachers of good
[1:40:09] things that they may teach the young
[1:40:13] woman to be sober to love their husbands
[1:40:18] to love their children to be
[1:40:22] discreet ch
[1:40:23] Cas keepers at
[1:40:26] home good obedient to their own
[1:40:31] husbands that the word of God be not
[1:40:37] blasphemed do you see lacking these
[1:40:40] things was an
[1:40:43] expression and really what they were
[1:40:45] expressing is blasphemed to
[1:40:51] God you know we
[1:40:53] we preach these things like law oh you
[1:40:57] sisters you better be obedient to your
[1:41:00] husbands well you know sometimes your
[1:41:03] husbands you know you're just plain
[1:41:05] smarter than they
[1:41:09] are oh I hope that didn't offend any of
[1:41:12] you
[1:41:14] gorillas that's not why they're
[1:41:18] obedient they they they want to
[1:41:21] express that they have a greater head
[1:41:23] head it's an expression of not
[1:41:26] blaspheming
[1:41:28] God they're chased they're obedient
[1:41:31] they're keepers of
[1:41:33] home they do their
[1:41:35] Duty why because they're expressing
[1:41:38] something they're expressing their
[1:41:41] Revelation they're expressing their
[1:41:43] position they're expressing their place
[1:41:46] it's beautiful expression but if you're
[1:41:50] not doing these things it doesn't matter
[1:41:53] what you're
[1:41:56] professing your expression is greater
[1:42:00] than
[1:42:01] your
[1:42:05] profession he
[1:42:09] says young men likewise exhort to be
[1:42:13] sober
[1:42:15] minded in all things showing thyself a
[1:42:19] pattern of Good Works in Doctrine
[1:42:24] showing
[1:42:26] uncorrupt gravity
[1:42:29] sincerity sound
[1:42:31] speech that cannot be
[1:42:34] condemned that he that is of the
[1:42:38] contrary part may be ashamed having no
[1:42:44] evil thing to say of
[1:42:47] you
[1:42:50] wow this is this what I'm saying don't
[1:42:53] forget
[1:42:56] Titus these are all Paul telling Titus
[1:43:01] what to tell the people that they might
[1:43:05] Express really what Christianity is
[1:43:10] about I just love that sound speech that
[1:43:13] cannot that that's the Titus himself
[1:43:15] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[1:43:19] that he that is of the contrary part may
[1:43:22] be ashamed
[1:43:25] having no evil thing to say of you so
[1:43:28] you don't tangle with
[1:43:30] them exhort
[1:43:32] servants to be obedient to their own
[1:43:36] masters and to please them well in all
[1:43:41] things not answering
[1:43:44] again not
[1:43:47] pering but showing all good
[1:43:50] Fidelity that they may adore Adorn the
[1:43:54] doctrine of God our savior in all things
[1:43:59] I'm going to return back to that
[1:44:01] scripture in just a moment for the grace
[1:44:04] of God that bringeth salvation hath
[1:44:07] appeared to all
[1:44:10] men teaching us that they deny
[1:44:15] ungodliness and worldly lust we should
[1:44:19] live soberly righteously and godly
[1:44:23] in this present world looking for that
[1:44:28] blessed hope and glorious appearing of
[1:44:32] the great God and our Savior Jesus
[1:44:39] Christ everybody should know that we're
[1:44:42] looking for that appearing we're not
[1:44:46] looking for our payche we're not looking
[1:44:48] for our retirement we're not looking for
[1:44:50] our social security we're looking
[1:44:53] looking for that soon return of our
[1:44:55] great Lord and Savior it expresses out
[1:44:59] of you if you have it Satan might knock
[1:45:04] you down but you'll that expression will
[1:45:07] rise back up and it'll it'll take hold
[1:45:10] in your life who gave himself for us
[1:45:15] that he might redeem us from all
[1:45:18] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[1:45:22] peculiar people zealous of good
[1:45:27] works so these are all this is this
[1:45:31] again is is
[1:45:34] Paul speaking to Titus letting him know
[1:45:39] what the true expression is what a real
[1:45:44] believer should be
[1:45:46] feeling what he should be thinking what
[1:45:49] what's important to him to be on H
[1:45:53] EST not to be caught up in the things of
[1:45:56] the world not not not to you know a good
[1:46:00] soldier doesn't entangle himself in the
[1:46:03] things of the world so his whole life
[1:46:06] becomes an expression of the fact that
[1:46:09] he's looking for that great and glorious
[1:46:12] appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:46:15] should be able they should be able to
[1:46:16] read that
[1:46:19] Amen in fact so much so the scripture
[1:46:23] tells us that men should inquire of us
[1:46:26] what is the hope that you
[1:46:36] have I mean if you you sit down with
[1:46:39] somebody and
[1:46:41] boy you know oh I don't have enough
[1:46:43] money in my retirement and uh you know
[1:46:46] man you leave that place
[1:46:50] depressed really wouldn't you like to
[1:46:54] sit down with a guy says man one day
[1:46:57] Hallelujah I'm going to be caught out of
[1:46:59] here this body's going to be changed I
[1:47:02] got a mansion waiting on the hillside
[1:47:05] I've Got a
[1:47:07] Mansion Just Over the hillt in that
[1:47:11] bright City where I'll never grow
[1:47:14] old man you look at that guy and you say
[1:47:16] that guy's
[1:47:18] Rich the guy looks at you that guy don't
[1:47:20] have a dime well he's got something
[1:47:23] don't
[1:47:25] God besides he came to the poor of this
[1:47:28] world rich in
[1:47:34] faith he came to the poor of this world
[1:47:38] rich in
[1:47:39] faith think of
[1:47:41] it rich in the knowledge of the things
[1:47:45] of God and what God
[1:47:48] thinks see this is what's happened to us
[1:47:52] is
[1:47:53] we've got a doctrinal
[1:47:55] message with all
[1:47:57] truths and all
[1:48:00] doctrines but our very
[1:48:03] atmosphere and our very
[1:48:06] attitude and the way we take on our
[1:48:09] daily
[1:48:11] challenges speaks louder than what we're
[1:48:20] professing when When We complain and we
[1:48:23] we we get grumpy and and everything
[1:48:27] bothers us then then it it doesn't
[1:48:31] matter what we
[1:48:33] believe we're not
[1:48:35] expressing we're not
[1:48:38] conveying what we really
[1:48:41] feel what's really in our heart we're
[1:48:44] not really conveying what God's done for
[1:48:49] us and and when the message M loses
[1:48:55] that the whole point of this message was
[1:49:01] that God opened things to
[1:49:04] us that should have a profound effect on
[1:49:08] us that we were
[1:49:12] predestinated that's a that that we were
[1:49:15] in his
[1:49:17] thinking that it was by his
[1:49:20] election he choosing those aren't
[1:49:22] doctrinal issues that we want to sit
[1:49:24] down and argue the church with the
[1:49:27] Church of
[1:49:28] Christ or or the Baptist or the
[1:49:31] Methodist those are things that were
[1:49:33] revealed to us that we can express the
[1:49:38] love of
[1:49:40] God because that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:49:43] does it expresses the love of God shed
[1:49:46] abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit
[1:49:49] it it it becomes glorious
[1:49:54] that's what it done it's it allows
[1:49:58] you despite the religious
[1:50:01] persecution despite the political
[1:50:04] pressure Des despite the financial
[1:50:07] atmosphere it allows you to stand up and
[1:50:10] say praise God I'm going home I'm
[1:50:14] elected my name's on the Lamb's Book of
[1:50:17] Life he's called me to be his bride I've
[1:50:20] got the wedding band of predestin on me
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:26] Hallelujah without that
[1:50:29] expression this message is dead it's
[1:50:33] word
[1:50:35] only it's a doctrinal
[1:50:38] fight I'm better than
[1:50:42] you that's why I said we ought to put a
[1:50:44] sign out front it says this we're right
[1:50:47] in everybody else's wrong Tabernacle
[1:50:55] they should be
[1:50:57] drawn by the hope you
[1:51:00] have they should be affected by the
[1:51:04] expression that's coming out of your
[1:51:07] heart and your
[1:51:10] life and I'm preaching to myself this
[1:51:13] morning not like I'm some beautiful
[1:51:16] angel Paul says I'm the chiefest of all
[1:51:20] Sinners and need the greatest to
[1:51:22] overcome but it doesn't change the word
[1:51:25] of
[1:51:31] God just like brother Stefan that
[1:51:34] preacher from abene you know he brother
[1:51:37] stepan sits down they're they're eating
[1:51:39] a brother comes over he visits with
[1:51:42] brother Stephan just for a little bit
[1:51:44] he's so moved that he reaches all the
[1:51:46] way out from abalene to talk to me why
[1:51:51] because there was something
[1:51:54] expressed he could see it in the
[1:51:56] clothing he could see it in the manner
[1:51:59] of eating he could see it when his head
[1:52:01] was bowed to pray he knew that but when
[1:52:04] he went and he made contact with the
[1:52:07] hope when he went contact with the
[1:52:10] excitement of the revelation of God's
[1:52:13] word he knew he didn't possess
[1:52:15] that he knew what he was in and what he
[1:52:19] belonged to and what he was a part of
[1:52:23] lacked the Eternal expression of God's
[1:52:31] love and we'll never draw
[1:52:34] anybody cuz what you'll get is you'll
[1:52:37] get
[1:52:38] intellect and if somebody could change
[1:52:40] their thinking to put them in here
[1:52:43] somebody else could change their
[1:52:44] thinking to take them
[1:52:48] out and alls it is is a that's what the
[1:52:51] scripture says they go from Pillar To
[1:52:54] Post they're like ships without anchor
[1:52:57] they're driven hither by this wind or
[1:53:00] that wind or by every wind of
[1:53:05] Doctrine because they don't have
[1:53:08] anything to
[1:53:17] express you ever argue with somebody do

[1:55:48] authority let no man despise thee and I
[1:55:53] I was going to continue reading but I
[1:55:54] want to stop there because I want to
[1:55:56] drop back just for a moment here to the
[1:56:01] 10th verse in closing this
[1:56:05] morning this is the end we've come to
[1:56:08] the end of our year and this has been
[1:56:12] quite a
[1:56:13] year it's been the year we moved into
[1:56:16] this
[1:56:17] building we've had baptisms and uh we've
[1:56:21] had marriages and and there there comes
[1:56:25] a time
[1:56:27] that that we look back we're about to
[1:56:30] finish I don't know if we'll finish this
[1:56:32] year it was my goal but to finish the
[1:56:35] Pavilion and and our storage and and E
[1:56:40] and then we'll it'll go from building to
[1:56:45] maintaining and uh then you know my life
[1:56:50] changes significantly
[1:56:53] and uh so I've been longing for the end
[1:56:58] of this year been fiveyear journey two
[1:57:03] years to get it through the city April
[1:57:06] 1st when we had our first Sunday meeting
[1:57:10] here in the church that was one year
[1:57:14] from the day we poured
[1:57:16] concrete and you know we'd walk through
[1:57:19] it and and and you know and you You'
[1:57:22] seen it transformed and Matthew did a
[1:57:25] beautiful job on the Landscaping which I
[1:57:28] apologized for him for tearing up
[1:57:32] but and and now we're going to have a
[1:57:34] nice place back there and pretty soon
[1:57:37] for you to sit under we have picnic
[1:57:39] tables we can put out and store and and
[1:57:42] a lot of things that they're all here to
[1:57:46] make life we've got Sunday school rooms
[1:57:48] that we didn't have before and we got
[1:57:51] places for young people and facilities
[1:57:54] and and and different things it's it's
[1:57:58] been a long
[1:57:59] journey but you know when you comes time
[1:58:06] that your
[1:58:08] expression changes your life
[1:58:11] changes and you move forward and and as
[1:58:14] a church I this is my heart's
[1:58:19] desire is that all of our lives lives
[1:58:22] start
[1:58:23] expressing the hope that we
[1:58:29] have and this is Paul's
[1:58:32] instruction
[1:58:35] here in the 10th
[1:58:38] verse he starts he says exort servants
[1:58:42] to be obedient to their own masters is
[1:58:46] don't we call ourselves Servants of the
[1:58:50] Lord and to please them well in all
[1:58:54] things not answering
[1:58:57] again you know that that's gain saying
[1:59:01] you know gain saying is where you always
[1:59:04] answer back you know you know you ever
[1:59:07] you ever be with people that you want to
[1:59:10] do a certain thing a certain way and it
[1:59:12] ain't two seconds they've got their
[1:59:14] their way of doing it well I think we
[1:59:17] ought to do it this way and then the
[1:59:18] other guy he thinks he ought to do it
[1:59:20] that way you know and pretty soon you're
[1:59:22] sitting back you guys think I'm a
[1:59:25] dummy you might do it that way I know
[1:59:27] how to do it cheaper and
[1:59:31] faster but you can't get involved in
[1:59:34] gain saying you say okay do it the way
[1:59:38] you want to do it just get it
[1:59:42] done right he's telling the servants
[1:59:44] don't
[1:59:46] gainsay you know don't fuss don't argue
[1:59:49] with everything don't argue with life
[1:59:52] Life Church don't argue with Life Is
[1:59:56] Life Fair no but we're not part of this
[1:59:58] life this is not our
[2:00:00] life you understand our purpose is to do
[2:00:05] something and Paul and Titus now
[2:00:08] expresses this so beautifully in this
[2:00:11] verse he
[2:00:13] says
[2:00:15] not
[2:00:17] pining purloining is I'm I'm probably
[2:00:21] not pronouncing that
[2:00:22] right that is
[2:00:25] to take
[2:00:28] away from
[2:00:30] something it it's it's it it it is
[2:00:35] attached to
[2:00:37] stealing but you know you take away from
[2:00:40] something if somebody does something and
[2:00:42] they maybe they they decorate and you
[2:00:45] come in and you look at they say oh you
[2:00:47] could have done this or they could have
[2:00:49] done that or why didn't they do this why
[2:00:51] did they use this color why didn't they
[2:00:53] use that
[2:00:55] color you know someone puts on a new
[2:00:57] suit and and and you don't like their
[2:01:00] Turtle
[2:01:02] tie well I like my turtle tie if you
[2:01:05] want to argue about me with my turtle
[2:01:07] tie you know what I mean that's
[2:01:10] okay but they they they they prolong you
[2:01:14] know they always tear it down they
[2:01:17] always drop it to a lower level they
[2:01:20] they they're they're they're they're
[2:01:22] stuck in taking
[2:01:24] away so he's telling the servants don't
[2:01:27] take away from things don't run your
[2:01:29] master down don't take away he's also
[2:01:32] saying don't steal from
[2:01:35] them don't take advantage of
[2:01:39] them you know don't don't do that that
[2:01:42] that that is that that don't prolong he
[2:01:45] said he says so listen to what he says
[2:01:47] this is beautiful and he says but show
[2:01:51] good
[2:01:53] Fidelity you know when you Fidelity
[2:01:56] means good
[2:01:57] service good works good do a good job go
[2:02:02] the extra
[2:02:03] mile because there's something that is
[2:02:06] taking
[2:02:08] place whether you know it or
[2:02:14] not whether you're aware of it or not
[2:02:18] when you don't
[2:02:19] PR does somebody know how to pronounce
[2:02:22] that word correctly am I okay with
[2:02:25] it okay so when when you don't don't do
[2:02:30] that it's not part of your nature to
[2:02:32] always find the fault to always take
[2:02:35] away from something to to always add
[2:02:38] your two
[2:02:39] cents you you know what I mean oh she
[2:02:43] plays the piano good but she just misses
[2:02:46] that
[2:02:48] sea
[2:02:50] huh you know or or it's just too loud
[2:02:53] it's it's not this it's not that and you
[2:02:57] you you be you become you're absolutely
[2:03:01] you you change the
[2:03:04] direction and the
[2:03:06] focus of what's
[2:03:11] transpiring and and Titus is pointing
[2:03:14] this out he Paul's pointing these things
[2:03:17] out to Titus Titus say went decree to
[2:03:21] build a Church to Adorn El Elders to
[2:03:26] have the
[2:03:28] purpose of the
[2:03:30] Believers
[2:03:33] expressing that they're looking for the
[2:03:36] Glorious appearing of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:39] Christ don't forget Titus the book of
[2:03:42] expression and then he says this not
[2:03:44] poining but showing all facility that
[2:03:48] they may Adorn the do
[2:03:52] of God our savior in all things you know
[2:03:56] what adorn means and I thought of that
[2:03:59] Christmas you said this a Christmas
[2:04:01] message yeah it's a Christmas message
[2:04:04] because this is the time that we Adorn
[2:04:06] we Adorn our
[2:04:08] houses right we put lights on them we
[2:04:11] put we put Reefs on them we We Lay
[2:04:15] Garland on and we Adorn our homes and
[2:04:18] and and you drive down the street and
[2:04:19] everybody's live what are they trying to
[2:04:21] do they're trying to make their house
[2:04:23] more attractive trying to make it stand
[2:04:25] out more because it's Christmas we we
[2:04:28] Adorn our trees and and put lights in
[2:04:31] our trees some people have Christmas
[2:04:33] trees some people have nativity
[2:04:35] scenes but but they Adorn it they
[2:04:38] they're they're trying to add
[2:04:42] attraction to make it more attractive to
[2:04:45] make it more
[2:04:47] beautiful to attract people to the
[2:04:49] season to the message
[2:04:53] they're they're trying to Adorn it it it
[2:04:55] it's it's to uh make it uh more
[2:04:59] beautiful or more
[2:05:01] attractive more lifted
[2:05:06] up and and so this is the
[2:05:11] season that everybody adorns everything
[2:05:14] you get a package somebody gave me a
[2:05:18] gift now I know inside that gift there's
[2:05:20] a box
[2:05:22] and if they would have just given me the
[2:05:24] box I would have got the
[2:05:27] gift just the same but they adorned
[2:05:31] it they wrapped it in paper and they put
[2:05:35] a bow on
[2:05:37] it and they made it look more attractive
[2:05:40] and More Beautiful they they had let
[2:05:42] they made it appear as a
[2:05:45] present as a gift they were
[2:05:49] expressing a Feeling or a
[2:05:54] thought I hope it's not
[2:05:58] deodorant but but uh
[2:06:02] uh but you know what I'm saying it's
[2:06:05] that now so he's telling us He's listed
[2:06:08] all these things tell the fathers to do
[2:06:11] this tell the mothers to do this tell
[2:06:13] the young men to do this tell the young
[2:06:15] ladies do this he's giving a whole list
[2:06:18] of behavior because he knows that that
[2:06:22] expression is going to make God more
[2:06:27] attractive to make the doctrines of God
[2:06:30] more beautiful because they can see the
[2:06:35] expression of what they believe being
[2:06:38] made
[2:06:42] manifest number one purpose of
[2:06:46] Christianity is to bring glory to the
[2:06:49] Lord Jesus Christ in in all
[2:06:52] things to the doctrine of God in all
[2:06:57] things and we've used the doctrines of
[2:07:01] William brandham as a substitute for
[2:07:04] real pure
[2:07:06] Christianity and you know I believe in
[2:07:08] the prophet of God and I'm not going to
[2:07:10] run him down I'm not going to say he
[2:07:11] made
[2:07:12] mistakes I believe everything was a
[2:07:15] purpose as a man he may have done things
[2:07:17] I don't know about I'm sure he's
[2:07:19] repented of many things but when when it
[2:07:21] comes to the word of God it was the
[2:07:24] unadulterated
[2:07:31] gospel but but we've
[2:07:34] lost what it is we're
[2:07:40] expressing the message is in
[2:07:44] war this group's blasting this group and
[2:07:47] that group's blasting that group I don't
[2:07:49] care what somebody wants to preach
[2:07:53] preach if they want to preach the
[2:07:55] raptures the cow sitting on the moon and
[2:07:57] the people want to sit there and listen
[2:07:59] to it praise God there my brothers and
[2:08:02] sister as for me and my
[2:08:05] house we want to serve the Lord we want
[2:08:09] to express the Lord Jesus Christ we want
[2:08:12] our actions our attitudes our motives
[2:08:15] our objections the words that come out
[2:08:18] of our mouth to Adorn the doctrine of
[2:08:22] our
[2:08:25] father to make it more
[2:08:27] attractive to make it more
[2:08:31] beautiful but when you prong and you are
[2:08:35] infidelity and and can you you you have
[2:08:38] a half attitude and a terrible approach
[2:08:42] and and you're
[2:08:44] miserable boy someone just wants what
[2:08:47] you got how did you get so miserable
[2:08:50] I've just been wanting to be be that
[2:08:51] miserable all my
[2:08:54] life no you know why I'm
[2:08:58] happy because one
[2:09:01] day the Lord showed me a pillar of fire
[2:09:05] came and that the Lord Jesus
[2:09:10] himself veiled
[2:09:13] himself in a
[2:09:15] man that in our generation the Gentile
[2:09:19] age Jesus came and put on a different
[2:09:25] robe
[2:09:27] imor a different
[2:09:29] appearance there was no difference
[2:09:31] between this ministry and the ministry
[2:09:34] of Jesus Christ except for the Corporal
[2:09:39] body and he used this
[2:09:44] man
[2:09:46] to
[2:09:49] express his love Amen to
[2:09:53] express his power to express his wisdom
[2:09:59] to express the hour we live in the time
[2:10:03] the expression that brother brandom
[2:10:05] expressed was
[2:10:07] eternal so it doesn't matter what the
[2:10:09] calendar says the expression was eternal
[2:10:13] so it'll be the same for ages to come if
[2:10:16] this world lasts 300 years the
[2:10:19] expression that God expressed through
[2:10:22] William Brandon will remain the same
[2:10:24] because it came from the beginning of
[2:10:26] the world it is Alpha and Omega it's the
[2:10:30] beginning and the
[2:10:34] end you can never take the
[2:10:38] light out of
[2:10:41] it and alls we're trying to do is take
[2:10:44] the flesh out of
[2:10:46] it and I hate to say it but too many men
[2:10:48] are trying to put the flesh back in
[2:10:54] it you can't take the deity out of this
[2:10:58] message because then you got a human
[2:11:00] expression and a human expression leads
[2:11:03] to misery you know why they're fighting
[2:11:05] beating down prolonging one another
[2:11:08] arguing with one another fighting for
[2:11:11] influence trying to start movements in
[2:11:13] the church trying to get people to go
[2:11:15] the way they are you know what we need
[2:11:17] to return we need to return back to the
[2:11:19] prayer closet
[2:11:22] we need to get back and let the love of
[2:11:24] God and the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:11:27] fill our beings
[2:11:30] again it's your way it's not the whole
[2:11:33] church World waking up in the morning
[2:11:34] it's you waking up in the morning it's
[2:11:37] your day it's your hour this is the day
[2:11:40] of your salvation this is the day you
[2:11:42] praise God this is the day you share
[2:11:45] what's in your heart with the rest of
[2:11:47] the
[2:11:48] world to Adorn
[2:11:51] to make more
[2:11:53] attractive to make more beneficial to
[2:11:57] make more beautiful the doctrine of God
[2:12:01] our savior in all
[2:12:04] things the doctrine of God our savior
[2:12:10] our Doctrine is Jesus
[2:12:15] Christ and when
[2:12:19] we go forward
[2:12:23] I preached last week we got
[2:12:25] weaknesses and I I had pages of human
[2:12:30] weaknesses but
[2:12:31] Jesus was God's gift to every
[2:12:38] weakness and how
[2:12:40] beautiful if we could go to go forward
[2:12:45] in the beauty of his likeness and the
[2:12:49] beauty of his
[2:12:52] Glory you say brother
[2:12:55] McGary I want more
[2:12:58] Doctrine though you understand all
[2:13:02] Mysteries and you speak with tongues of
[2:13:04] men and angels and have not a love in
[2:13:08] your
[2:13:09] heart that can be
[2:13:12] expressed then we are
[2:13:17] nothing so you say what's our clothes
[2:13:20] we've had had
[2:13:21] a tough year toughest year I've probably
[2:13:25] been in lost my mom uh uh uh a tough
[2:13:32] year but you know what I don't want to
[2:13:36] let a tough here ruin my
[2:13:40] expression I want to go
[2:13:45] back and in my heart make a rededication
[2:13:51] of saying Lord I'm going to
[2:13:54] reexamine what my life is
[2:14:02] expressing does my life Express that I'm
[2:14:06] displeased with my children or I'm
[2:14:08] displeased with my station in life I'm
[2:14:11] displeased with
[2:14:15] lesie can you imagine me walking through
[2:14:17] oh I wish lesie was a better cook
[2:14:21] I wish lesie didn't spend so much money
[2:14:25] I wish lesie wouldn't do this and I wish
[2:14:28] lesie wouldn't do that oh wouldn't you
[2:14:30] just want to get
[2:14:35] married that'd be
[2:14:38] terrible of course I don't have a right
[2:14:40] to do it I I would be
[2:14:43] lying but what what is it is that we
[2:14:46] want to express they'll know that you
[2:14:49] are Christians by your love one for
[2:14:54] another they'll know you are my
[2:14:57] disciples but how you express your
[2:15:01] feelings and thoughts one to
[2:15:06] another I want to Adorn this
[2:15:12] message I want to
[2:15:14] Adorn this
[2:15:16] message I want to make the doctrines of
[2:15:19] this message beautiful
[2:15:22] I want to make the doctrines and this
[2:15:24] life of this word more
[2:15:27] attractive how can I do that by
[2:15:32] examining and becoming aware of what it
[2:15:36] is that I'm
[2:15:38] expressing and my deepest apologies if
[2:15:42] through my weariness in my human flesh
[2:15:45] I've ever expressed to you anything
[2:15:49] other
[2:15:52] than the fact that I'm a sinner saved by
[2:15:57] grace and God's goodness shared a
[2:16:01] portion of his spirit with me and I love
[2:16:05] you and I want to say to you and help
[2:16:10] express to you the things that'll help
[2:16:13] you get to the kingdom of heaven so this
[2:16:18] year this week this going forward let's
[2:16:24] realize that we're put
[2:16:26] here like the tree like the seed to
[2:16:31] express the life that God put in that
[2:16:34] seed and let's let's have a year of
[2:16:38] expression getting rid of the bad
[2:16:40] expressions and letting the good
