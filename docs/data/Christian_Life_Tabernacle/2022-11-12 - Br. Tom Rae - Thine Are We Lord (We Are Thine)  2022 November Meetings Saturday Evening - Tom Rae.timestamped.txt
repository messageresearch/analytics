[54:55] and I I was reading and thinking on my
[54:59] heart and
[55:00] this statement that the prophet of God
[55:04] made and and to see if I can find it
[55:07] here
[55:09] and it comes from the message of
[55:13] called investment
[55:15] and
[55:17] let me see if I just give me a second
[55:19] here and
[55:23] I might have lost it which is the police
[55:30] anyway the prophet of God said this this
[55:33] young man was
[55:36] he was
[55:37] thirsting
[55:39] for something that he saw
[55:42] that's right in the Lord Jesus
[55:44] he wanted to be a partner with it he
[55:49] wanted that life
[55:52] and in this great message the prophet of
[55:54] God says that God gives everybody the
[55:57] opportunity
[55:58] to invest and I I thought you know God
[56:02] really
[56:03] has been here yeah with us so far giving
[56:08] us the opportunity
[56:10] he said that young man was given the
[56:12] opportunity but he didn't take the
[56:15] opportunity
[56:16] to have the new birth
[56:19] amen don't miss the opportunity tonight
[56:24] he's going to come by your way and he's
[56:26] going to give you the opportunity

[56:34] to give you the opportunity to Touch the
[56:37] Hem of His Garment he's going to as our
[56:39] as our brother preached that that
[56:41] opportunity may just come in a moment

[1:06:54] we love you dearly
[1:06:57] let's turn to the scripture
[1:07:01] First Corinthians
[1:07:06] now you think I got the energy what you
[1:07:08] just saw
[1:07:12] it ain't gonna happen
[1:07:18] but for an old fellow somebody said to
[1:07:20] me the other day not too long ago
[1:07:23] they said you do not so bad for an old
[1:07:25] fella
[1:07:26] I said I didn't know I was old
[1:07:30] the crazy thought somebody told me I'm
[1:07:33] old
[1:07:34] shame on them
[1:07:38] no sir we're young at heart
[1:07:41] we love the Lord Jesus
[1:07:44] well did I say First Corinthians 1 30.
[1:07:48] did I not say that yet
[1:07:50] First Corinthians I heard those pages
[1:07:52] turning
[1:07:54] foreign
[1:07:58] now I'm a type of preacher that looks at
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] you know me by now
[1:08:06] so if you're nodding off
[1:08:09] it's my fault
[1:08:11] not yours
[1:08:13] okay
[1:08:14] First Corinthians chapter one
[1:08:17] verse 30.
[1:08:19] but of him are ye in Christ Jesus
[1:08:25] who of God is made unto us wisdom and
[1:08:29] righteousness
[1:08:31] sanctification and Redemption
[1:08:36] that according as it is written
[1:08:39] he that glorifieth let him glory
[1:08:42] in the Lord
[1:08:44] let's turn to Second Corinthians chapter
[1:08:46] 5.
[1:08:54] II Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21.
[1:09:04] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:09:08] who knew no sin
[1:09:10] that we might be made
[1:09:13] the righteousness of God in him
[1:09:18] now if you wouldn't mind doing me a
[1:09:20] favor
[1:09:21] would you help me read that verse again
[1:09:25] for he hath made him be sin for us who
[1:09:29] knew no sin that we might be made the
[1:09:32] righteousness of God
[1:09:34] in him let's pray one more time Heavenly
[1:09:37] Father your words Eternal and it is life
[1:09:40] to us Lord would you open it to every
[1:09:42] one of us Lord from the youngest to the
[1:09:45] oldest we ask it in Jesus name amen you
[1:09:49] may have your seats
[1:09:51] thank you brother David for the
[1:09:53] invitation again sister Leslie my
[1:09:57] goodness we feel like we are home
[1:10:00] I've looked at I've looked at a few of
[1:10:02] my
[1:10:04] travels over the years and it started in
[1:10:07] 206
[1:10:08] and I don't often go to the same place
[1:10:10] twice in a year but I find out that this
[1:10:13] is the place that I've come the most
[1:10:15] twice in a year
[1:10:17] and now we're at 2 20. 22 22 20 22.
[1:10:23] I am getting old
[1:10:27] and uh
[1:10:31] you haven't changed the BET you've only
[1:10:33] gotten better
[1:10:35] you see the young men coming up Matthew
[1:10:38] Gabriella they made just this tremendous
[1:10:42] Dave and Juliet Deacons
[1:10:45] Bible studies I've enjoyed the last
[1:10:48] couple years
[1:10:49] they've they've allowed me to say
[1:10:51] something
[1:10:52] I don't know whether it was worth it but
[1:10:55] we had a good time a wonderful time
[1:10:59] and now we're here in the evening
[1:11:01] service and one last one after tonight
[1:11:04] so I I determined to myself I'm not
[1:11:08] going to hold him much more than 40
[1:11:10] minutes
[1:11:12] I know that you're laughing because
[1:11:13] that's that's an impossibility even on
[1:11:16] my end of the stick but I know you're
[1:11:19] tired and I know you've put a lot in and
[1:11:21] and uh
[1:11:24] I appreciate it
[1:11:32] so
[1:11:33] bless you your reflection
[1:11:36] of this great message we love so dearly
[1:11:41] God be with you
[1:11:44] I've enjoyed as I said in the prayer
[1:11:46] I've enjoyed so much the last two
[1:11:49] Services of brother Michael
[1:11:51] not that he's just my son he's my son
[1:11:56] and I love him
[1:11:58] I thank God for his life
[1:12:02] so I'm gonna speak a little title on
[1:12:05] thine are we lord
[1:12:08] we're yours
[1:12:11] and maybe the subject will run into
[1:12:14] tomorrow morning so that's why I said I
[1:12:16] won't hold you that long in that late
[1:12:19] but I would love for you to be attentive
[1:12:22] as we go through the word of God
[1:12:26] we read out of First Corinthians 1 and
[1:12:28] 30 and uh
[1:12:30] the scripture says I'll destroy and help
[1:12:32] you remember he is the source of your
[1:12:35] life
[1:12:35] in Christ Jesus whom God made our wisdom
[1:12:39] our righteousness our sanctification and
[1:12:42] our Redemption
[1:12:44] if I look it up in a few more
[1:12:46] translations and you take it to the the
[1:12:49] Greek can you take it through whatever
[1:12:51] whatever and you find out that you know
[1:12:54] there are some things in there that may
[1:12:56] be help you understand a little bit more
[1:12:58] clearly but it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:13:01] make it alive
[1:13:03] and it goes on to say but it is from him
[1:13:05] that you are in Christ it's from him
[1:13:07] that you are in Christ so right away
[1:13:09] Paul whether it be whether it be
[1:13:11] Ephesians Colossians
[1:13:14] Corinthians he's really identifying you
[1:13:17] in Christ Jesus
[1:13:19] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:13:21] the world
[1:13:22] so this is not a great uh mystery now
[1:13:25] because we're going to go through it
[1:13:26] that through a servant of God a
[1:13:30] messenger of this age we start to really
[1:13:33] realize who we are in Christ Jesus we
[1:13:36] are thine
[1:13:37] and we start to understand we are not
[1:13:40] just a bunch of weak need Christians
[1:13:43] that sit around here and wonder why are
[1:13:46] we here
[1:13:47] Paul is really laying down in the
[1:13:50] scripture who we are in Christ Jesus
[1:13:55] and that is very important because
[1:13:57] there's a lot of people that are losing
[1:13:59] their identification
[1:14:01] and their identity in Christ Jesus and
[1:14:05] they identify with just the church but I
[1:14:08] want to be identified with the god that
[1:14:10] dwells within the church
[1:14:13] and then it becomes then a more of a
[1:14:16] reality and a personal relationship with
[1:14:18] God
[1:14:19] we have a lovely building and you will
[1:14:21] have another lovely building of God
[1:14:23] should tarry but if God doesn't dwell in
[1:14:26] the building it's just the building and
[1:14:29] if God is indwelling in the people
[1:14:30] you're just a people but I want to say
[1:14:33] that God is dwelling in a people you've
[1:14:36] caught the moment of time for your new
[1:14:38] birth you know who you are in Christ
[1:14:40] Jesus and now we start to identify as
[1:14:44] the bride of Christ we're going to let
[1:14:46] the devil know who we are what we're
[1:14:49] called for and where we're going and
[1:14:51] there's nothing going to stop us
[1:14:56] yeah there you go let's close our Bible
[1:14:58] to have a word of prayer and go home
[1:15:00] you caught it all in five seconds
[1:15:05] but it's really the truth
[1:15:08] you know uh anybody here play football
[1:15:13] ever
[1:15:15] that is a tricky question huh oh you do
[1:15:19] do ya what are you
[1:15:21] doing out there huh you know spandex
[1:15:28] just trying to catch it right no but if
[1:15:32] you ever on a team it's a team effort
[1:15:37] so they're all there tapping into is the
[1:15:39] perversion of God
[1:15:41] there's a there's a there's a
[1:15:43] quarterback
[1:15:45] telling you how to play there's a coach
[1:15:48] everybody's got to do their part
[1:15:50] they'll criticize the you know the back
[1:15:53] end front hand side and whatever and
[1:15:56] didn't do their part they got the
[1:15:59] statistics yeah no I know you only show
[1:16:02] up for special meat I mean you know
[1:16:05] no no no no no no I'm only getting
[1:16:10] but everybody's got a part to play
[1:16:13] and everybody really has a part to play
[1:16:15] when it's a team effort and you really
[1:16:17] want to win
[1:16:18] but I want to let you know we already
[1:16:20] won
[1:16:23] it is not a question am I going to win
[1:16:26] if my Prophet is your prophet he said in
[1:16:29] the rising of the sun you've already
[1:16:32] made it
[1:16:33] I saw you over there so I want to ask
[1:16:36] you the question what's your problem we
[1:16:39] come to church and we got our woes and
[1:16:41] we got this catch the moments
[1:16:44] yeah
[1:16:46] everybody hear me in the back
[1:16:49] yeah I know everybody you know I always
[1:16:51] listen to back at school that's a bad
[1:16:53] place
[1:16:55] I hope it's not that way in church huh
[1:16:58] you hide in the back so the teacher
[1:17:00] doesn't see you
[1:17:02] David
[1:17:06] no
[1:17:07] so we're we take the word of God
[1:17:09] seriously
[1:17:11] it comes with intent and Power
[1:17:14] and there's many things throughout the
[1:17:16] ages that they did not know what you
[1:17:18] know of course today
[1:17:20] and there's many things that you thought
[1:17:22] or you hear and we hear is that I've
[1:17:25] heard that before then why are you watch
[1:17:27] a football game
[1:17:31] they throw the same silly ball
[1:17:34] every game
[1:17:37] huh and they throw it a certain way and
[1:17:39] I think the same guy catches it
[1:17:42] and the place goes nuts
[1:17:46] am I in a trap
[1:17:48] is that true
[1:17:50] huh same place same guy gets the ball
[1:17:54] quarterback throws is a 350 yard
[1:17:57] whatever no it's not how ridiculous
[1:18:00] huh it's a long throw out of the
[1:18:04] ballpark
[1:18:06] but it's how and everybody gets excited
[1:18:09] but then you get to church
[1:18:11] the most exciting thing that could ever
[1:18:13] happen
[1:18:14] when the God has unveiled it the seals
[1:18:18] are open and when John saw it all that
[1:18:22] was in heaven and under the heaven heard
[1:18:26] him say hallelujah
[1:18:30] amen I bet I wonder what they were doing
[1:18:32] in Jeffersonville when it was happening
[1:18:34] heaven was having a good time
[1:18:38] I'll let you think about that one
[1:18:43] but Angels rejoice
[1:18:45] there's another dimension
[1:18:48] there's another realm that's here
[1:18:51] and I'd like to delve in and get into
[1:18:53] that realm but first of all I want to
[1:18:55] deal with this realm with you
[1:18:57] and then we'll deal with the Angels
[1:18:59] tomorrow
[1:19:01] because they're here with you and
[1:19:02] brother Brown says they never leave your
[1:19:04] side
[1:19:04] he said you have your own personal Angel
[1:19:07] he that has borne again Son of God
[1:19:11] Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb has
[1:19:14] your own personal angel
[1:19:17] have you said good morning or a good
[1:19:18] night to him
[1:19:21] I'll just let that one go too
[1:19:23] just throwing some things out for you
[1:19:25] just to get your juices
[1:19:27] simmering here
[1:19:31] who we are in the Lord
[1:19:34] who I'm identified with
[1:19:37] and what I'm identified with
[1:19:41] brother Brown said in Revelation of
[1:19:43] Jesus Christ series taking the same
[1:19:45] scriptures we took tonight out of second
[1:19:47] Corinthians 5 and 21 it says we are the
[1:19:50] very righteousness of God himself
[1:19:55] being in Christ
[1:19:58] now
[1:20:00] he may he make he's very gracious to us
[1:20:03] he says
[1:20:04] it says that he Jesus became sin
[1:20:08] for us
[1:20:10] it does not say he became sinful
[1:20:14] but he became sin for us
[1:20:16] that our Union with him might become the
[1:20:19] righteousness of God
[1:20:22] if we accept the fact and
[1:20:26] we must
[1:20:28] that he literally became sin for us
[1:20:33] by his substitution
[1:20:35] for us
[1:20:37] then we must also accept the fact
[1:20:40] that we by our Union with him
[1:20:45] are
[1:20:47] the very righteousness of God
[1:20:50] now that one he says is hard for you to
[1:20:54] take
[1:20:55] say well I'm the righteousness of God
[1:20:58] he goes on to clear that up he says to
[1:21:01] reject one is to reject the other to
[1:21:04] accept one is to accept the other
[1:21:06] now we know the Bible says that it can't
[1:21:09] be denied because the scripture declares
[1:21:12] it but the revelation of it's missing
[1:21:18] it's not real to the majority of God's
[1:21:21] children
[1:21:23] it's just a good verse in the Bible
[1:21:27] but we need to have it made alive to us
[1:21:33] that will take revelation
[1:21:36] you heard about that last night so then
[1:21:39] if we say we have become the
[1:21:41] righteousness of God
[1:21:43] it will take a revelation
[1:21:46] for you to catch that you are indeed the
[1:21:50] righteousness of God
[1:21:54] my
[1:21:55] that should have got you out of your
[1:21:57] seat it would at a football game
[1:22:02] that was that was a what a Hail Mary as
[1:22:05] they call it is that the one where they
[1:22:07] throw it way down the field
[1:22:10] we actually have to come to the
[1:22:13] realization saints of God that we're
[1:22:16] more than just church members
[1:22:19] okay when I saw the songs being sung
[1:22:23] here tonight my my buttons were popping
[1:22:26] for your pastor
[1:22:28] does he standing here saying the glories
[1:22:31] of God
[1:22:32] we proud absolutely of you no
[1:22:36] of Christ in you yes
[1:22:39] I just didn't want you to feel to it
[1:22:45] but we start to understand because the
[1:22:48] prophet said in Christ The Mystery of
[1:22:49] God revealed which is quote often
[1:22:52] when she understands who she is
[1:22:56] than the rapture
[1:22:57] takes place
[1:22:59] so then it's not just uh come to church
[1:23:02] to hear a nice sermon and
[1:23:05] and go home and forget what you heard
[1:23:09] just know that it was a good time
[1:23:12] and you might catch a warrior or a
[1:23:13] phrase but we want that word to turn
[1:23:17] from spoken
[1:23:18] to flesh
[1:23:22] so we are maybe taking my time a little
[1:23:25] bit as I get younger
[1:23:28] instead of being a little bit expressive
[1:23:31] and I'll get there probably hopefully
[1:23:34] but we want to understand
[1:23:37] where God is calling us and where we are
[1:23:39] in him
[1:23:42] it will take a revelation from almighty
[1:23:44] God
[1:23:45] and especially today as we know we're
[1:23:48] coming to the end of the ages
[1:23:52] and coming to the edge end of the ages
[1:23:54] is then coming to a time where the
[1:23:56] Prophet said we're blending from time to
[1:23:59] Eternity
[1:24:01] and there's a crossing over and it's
[1:24:03] only for those I'll get there to the
[1:24:06] quote to those that are under
[1:24:08] expectation for it
[1:24:11] because it was those that were under
[1:24:13] expectation that will raise them out of
[1:24:16] the grave
[1:24:18] it'll be those that are under
[1:24:19] expectation that will take the change in
[1:24:22] the body
[1:24:24] so that is an important word
[1:24:27] just hold on to that word
[1:24:29] so now we're coming to a time and we've
[1:24:31] come to an age of where we're coming to
[1:24:34] the
[1:24:35] summation of all things
[1:24:41] there will be a time when there will not
[1:24:42] be any more marriages
[1:24:46] I'll look over here
[1:24:47] the boys will take that better than the
[1:24:49] girls
[1:24:52] I'm only not kidding but there will be
[1:24:54] that time there will be a time when
[1:24:56] everything's over
[1:24:59] we've taken our last breath and we've
[1:25:01] taken a change in the atoms
[1:25:03] who's living for that time
[1:25:08] who's dwelling on that thought
[1:25:12] what do you think this message came for
[1:25:15] just to start another church
[1:25:18] or to get a people ready for a rapture
[1:25:21] because they without us cannot be made
[1:25:24] perfect and they're waiting for us a
[1:25:26] great host of Heaven is Waiting for you
[1:25:29] to catch
[1:25:31] a revelation of rapture
[1:25:33] but we want to live our lives through
[1:25:35] our children
[1:25:39] people force them to be certain things
[1:25:41] want them to be certain things drive
[1:25:44] them to be certain things cause
[1:25:45] complexes and hurts and whatever
[1:25:50] but really saints of God would come to a
[1:25:52] place in time
[1:25:55] where we need to really take inventory
[1:25:59] and say Lord what is the first and
[1:26:01] foremost thing on my mind as we approach
[1:26:05] now the crossing over
[1:26:07] you say well brother Tom we've heard
[1:26:09] about this for a long time well you're
[1:26:12] just fulfilling what the scripture says
[1:26:14] in Peter
[1:26:15] we've heard about this coming
[1:26:18] but there is a time when it is over
[1:26:21] and uh let me just tell you you've got a
[1:26:24] crazy fellow over in Russia right now
[1:26:27] that's got a few missiles getting ready
[1:26:30] and they're
[1:26:31] what do you call it inter ballistic
[1:26:35] intercontinental ballistic missiles
[1:26:38] now they they're trying trying to tell
[1:26:41] us that they can get to our continent
[1:26:42] and how many minutes
[1:26:45] 30 minutes
[1:26:48] and brother Brown says now he and he
[1:26:51] starts laboring the cities that got
[1:26:54] those bombs names on them
[1:26:56] I wonder whether that you think that
[1:26:58] that's filler
[1:26:59] or do you actually think that that's
[1:27:01] what a prophet
[1:27:03] is trying to tell us
[1:27:05] that they can pinpoint now
[1:27:08] missiles
[1:27:09] to a place
[1:27:11] but then we understand through the word
[1:27:14] before one Falls
[1:27:19] ah
[1:27:20] is it real to you
[1:27:23] and I'm just digging around the tree
[1:27:27] I'm just digging around
[1:27:29] right now just laying a few thoughts out
[1:27:31] because it has to be real
[1:27:34] it just has to be real now brother Brown
[1:27:38] says we are in the time of the opening
[1:27:43] of the sealed book
[1:27:47] we are now in the time of redemption
[1:27:51] it's now time to claim that Redemption
[1:27:56] to claim it for me and to claim it for
[1:27:59] you
[1:28:00] what he redeemed us back from
[1:28:04] back to everything Adam lost
[1:28:06] in the garden he has redeemed it back to
[1:28:10] us
[1:28:11] now that lamb that took the book
[1:28:15] we are ready to ask his grace and mercy
[1:28:17] upon us to open the seven seal book let
[1:28:20] us look past in that curtain of time
[1:28:22] just a bit
[1:28:25] and notice now the title deed
[1:28:28] the Seal's been open
[1:28:30] he broke those seals the Mysteries
[1:28:33] revealed to bring them for us to see
[1:28:37] all the claims for the redeemed subjects
[1:28:41] of God
[1:28:44] so now we we love the time and we love
[1:28:47] it when the preacher gets all excited
[1:28:50] and and we talk about Adam and we talk
[1:28:53] about him walking with the tiger and
[1:28:55] saying to this mountain be removed and
[1:28:57] that's what we're being brought back to
[1:29:00] and we can't even bring ourselves
[1:29:02] subject to our own temper
[1:29:11] there's things in life
[1:29:13] that we have to get this Earth in order
[1:29:19] for the next Earth
[1:29:21] to get put into order
[1:29:24] letting God then
[1:29:27] becoming the reality within our lives
[1:29:30] and that we see who we are in him
[1:29:35] because you will find yourself if you
[1:29:38] look at yourself you will fail miserably
[1:29:42] if you look to him to take care of self
[1:29:47] you will conquer self
[1:29:49] triumphantly
[1:29:54] brother Graham says and things that are
[1:29:55] to be he said that which is in you will
[1:29:58] take control of that which is on the
[1:30:01] outside
[1:30:04] so now those are great statements
[1:30:08] but now I want to encourage you to take
[1:30:11] a hold of those statements
[1:30:13] and say there's things within my own
[1:30:15] particular life
[1:30:18] that I need to bring subject
[1:30:22] to the word of the Lord
[1:30:25] are we okay right now we're okay because
[1:30:28] we're not this is just free right now
[1:30:30] this is all free
[1:30:32] okay
[1:30:34] so now we start to understand then that
[1:30:37] God in his great mind has an uh uh not
[1:30:40] just an idea of who you are but I've
[1:30:44] thought of Who You Are
[1:30:47] and that thought will manifest
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] as we heard this morning the arrows are
[1:30:55] flying
[1:30:56] and he's looking for a womb for that
[1:30:59] Arrow to land
[1:31:02] and when that seed flunk is closed in
[1:31:05] the womb
[1:31:06] it has its own Natural Life
[1:31:11] I've never yet come in contact with a
[1:31:15] pregnant sister in a church
[1:31:18] who sat at a table and said I sure hope
[1:31:22] the hands are forming
[1:31:27] it's a natural event
[1:31:31] of a promise
[1:31:33] that when that body starts growing
[1:31:37] every organ
[1:31:39] every circulatory blood system nervous
[1:31:42] system whatever you want is now starting
[1:31:44] to grow
[1:31:46] and nobody is having a raw raw period in
[1:31:50] the morning saying honey let's get our
[1:31:52] blower out
[1:31:54] and blow our horn and say son come on
[1:31:56] let those fingers be so many inches long
[1:32:00] that's going to be what it is
[1:32:03] so when the seed lands in your womb
[1:32:08] there is going to be growth
[1:32:12] it is not something you manufacture
[1:32:15] it is something that's already in it
[1:32:19] all you have to do is say Lord let it be
[1:32:23] unto me according to your word
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:29] because the word's already impregnated
[1:32:34] so now it's not going to church to try
[1:32:37] and be a Christian
[1:32:39] going to church being a Christian once
[1:32:44] you've been born again
[1:32:49] okay
[1:32:51] because I know I'm just gonna I'm just
[1:32:53] gonna watch you now I'm watching you
[1:32:56] now watch what brother Bram says here he
[1:32:59] says now
[1:33:00] Isaiah prophesied as Michael was saying
[1:33:03] this morning there were many arrows
[1:33:06] shooting or can we say many word
[1:33:08] scriptures going
[1:33:10] and when that seed went out from Genesis
[1:33:14] and it and it said that that seed of the
[1:33:17] woman
[1:33:18] is going to crush the head of the
[1:33:20] serpent
[1:33:21] that seed saints of God is going to find
[1:33:24] ground
[1:33:26] and it's going to bring forth the
[1:33:28] promise
[1:33:29] and did it let me ask you the question
[1:33:32] not assuming that you don't know it
[1:33:34] didn't happen but did it happen
[1:33:37] did Jesus come
[1:33:39] was the prophecy fulfilled then there's
[1:33:42] a prophecy of a bride
[1:33:45] and that broad is going to be victorious
[1:33:49] triumphant
[1:33:52] sinless
[1:33:53] spotless
[1:33:55] who on Earth is it
[1:34:01] amen you have to come to the conclusion
[1:34:04] if God has called me
[1:34:07] and I'm that womb
[1:34:10] then I've got to bring forth him
[1:34:15] I am the very righteousness of Christ
[1:34:20] amen it's not trying to pump you up get
[1:34:23] saved tonight and get lost tomorrow it's
[1:34:26] you Desiring the very thing
[1:34:29] that we heard about an eagle
[1:34:31] brother Brown's had an invisible union
[1:34:33] he saw something he wanted to be like
[1:34:38] so it isn't coming to church like trying
[1:34:40] to be a Christian it's a gene in you
[1:34:44] that's driving you
[1:34:51] amen because you are a living attribute
[1:34:55] and Gene of God there is going to be a
[1:34:58] manifestation
[1:35:00] of a bride
[1:35:02] that's been prophesied in this
[1:35:04] generation
[1:35:06] Foundation
[1:35:08] Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 if you
[1:35:11] don't mind turning to it Colossians
[1:35:15] 1 26.
[1:35:25] are you there
[1:35:27] Colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[1:35:31] has been hid

[1:59:33] I better go over here but it's true
[1:59:37] it's just true if you got into tapes
[1:59:41] this would not be some sort of mystery
[1:59:44] to you
[1:59:45] if you listen to what a prophet said you
[1:59:48] will find your position
[1:59:50] your hope raising children helping other
[1:59:54] mothers
[2:00:03] I better turn the page
[2:00:05] it says right here Tom Turn the Page
[2:00:12] there are people
[2:00:14] in the Old Testament
[2:00:16] that are your brothers and sisters that
[2:00:20] weren't even a part of Israel
[2:00:22] that realized that David
[2:00:25] was the anointed
[2:00:27] and that he was going to come into his
[2:00:29] position
[2:00:30] Israel was missing it
[2:00:33] but there were some Gentiles that were
[2:00:36] getting it
[2:00:38] and I have to believe saints of God
[2:00:40] there's some of us that are getting it
[2:00:42] whether laodicea missed it or not
[2:00:45] we receive it
[2:00:51] I preached just a couple weeks ago on
[2:00:53] Joseph
[2:00:54] and all of us probably all know all the
[2:00:57] story of Joseph
[2:00:58] and we know the trials Joseph went
[2:01:01] through and we know how his brothers
[2:01:03] turned on him
[2:01:04] did he have it easy
[2:01:06] but was there a prophecy was there an
[2:01:09] arrow come on stay with me was there an
[2:01:12] arrow that there would be sheep's vowel
[2:01:15] right
[2:01:15] huh the Sun the moon has started
[2:01:17] couldn't bow right he went to prison
[2:01:20] he got falsely accused
[2:01:22] but he came and got on the right hand of
[2:01:24] pharaoh
[2:01:26] God had to have him there because there
[2:01:28] was Jacob
[2:01:29] in another land
[2:01:31] that was going to need seed
[2:01:35] come on God is not interested in Egypt
[2:01:40] he is only interested in his redeems
[2:01:45] so God raised him up
[2:01:48] to sit on their right hand
[2:01:50] to make a granary the seed
[2:01:54] for seed
[2:01:58] amen raise up seed for his seed and God
[2:02:03] sent the prophet
[2:02:06] and this Greenery is full it is full
[2:02:11] seed for seed
[2:02:17] but you know what when you read Hebrews
[2:02:20] about the faith chapter when it speaks
[2:02:23] about Joseph it doesn't tell about his
[2:02:25] Ascension to the throne it doesn't tell
[2:02:27] about him going in prison and getting
[2:02:30] out of prison it doesn't tell him about
[2:02:31] anything other than when you get out of
[2:02:34] Egypt take my bones with you
[2:02:38] what was he interested in Redemption
[2:02:41] come on he wasn't interested in all this
[2:02:44] other stuff the only thing he had in his
[2:02:47] mind Redemption Resurrection
[2:02:51] all right
[2:02:53] amen amen
[2:02:55] hallelujah he knew his position
[2:03:01] Direction
[2:03:03] Resurrection
[2:03:06] oh I got the victory over this that's
[2:03:08] great
[2:03:09] and you get that Victory you challenge
[2:03:11] that devil you beat him down
[2:03:14] but you keep on thinking of the
[2:03:16] Resurrection
[2:03:17] you keep thinking of
[2:03:19] a change in the atoms
[2:03:22] in a moment
[2:03:24] in the twinkling of an eye
[2:03:26] remember now
[2:03:28] David was rejected he was the anointed
[2:03:31] yet rejected
[2:03:33] this message is the anointed
[2:03:36] yet is rejected
[2:03:41] but there were men that rose up
[2:03:45] that followed David
[2:03:47] even though he was rejected
[2:03:53] there were those men that said you're
[2:03:56] the anointed David we don't care what
[2:03:59] Absalom says
[2:04:00] we don't care what Jerusalem says we
[2:04:03] only care what God Said
[2:04:05] a prophet anointed you to be king
[2:04:09] and when you get into your kingdom
[2:04:11] remember me
[2:04:14] come on and they stuck with David and
[2:04:18] they were victorious with David and the
[2:04:21] Bible says and God gave them cities
[2:04:24] because they stayed with David you stay
[2:04:27] with this message
[2:04:28] [Applause]
[2:04:30] he has given you a city
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:04:34] Hallelujah
[2:04:40] these men had their names you know
[2:04:42] you know sometimes people say you know I
[2:04:44] wish my name was in the Bible
[2:04:46] mine is
[2:04:48] but don't go farther than that
[2:04:52] Thomas
[2:04:55] the faith Giver
[2:05:00] huh
[2:05:02] but God had these men's names written
[2:05:04] down
[2:05:05] there is either
[2:05:07] whoever heard of ease or who named their
[2:05:09] kid either
[2:05:11] hi either
[2:05:13] hi easy
[2:05:16] I don't know what you call a little baby
[2:05:18] easy
[2:05:24] and there was names I can't pronounce
[2:05:29] but they have tremendous meanings
[2:05:33] easy or easer means to help
[2:05:38] then you got Obadiah which is a servant
[2:05:40] of God which is a Hebrew then you have
[2:05:43] other men e l l e l then you've got
[2:05:46] elzab dab dab
[2:05:52] and we laugh at the names but God knows
[2:05:55] exactly their name
[2:05:57] written in the book
[2:05:59] but I don't know about you but my name
[2:06:01] is written in the book also
[2:06:04] amen
[2:06:06] God knows her name
[2:06:08] and then Israel failed to back up their
[2:06:13] King so then there was a group of men
[2:06:15] that came to David and his name was
[2:06:17] amishai
[2:06:19] and amishai he was a chief of captains
[2:06:21] for Israel
[2:06:22] and he made this lovely exclamation
[2:06:25] which I've used over the years and he
[2:06:28] said David
[2:06:29] thine are we
[2:06:32] thine are we
[2:06:35] we are on your side
[2:06:39] and I'd like to tell the devil
[2:06:41] all right right now
[2:06:44] I am the Lords
[2:06:48] and I'm on the Lord's Side
[2:06:53] and I am his
[2:06:55] ten thousands of thousands separated
[2:06:58] themselves from David
[2:07:01] but if David would have stayed in
[2:07:02] Jerusalem
[2:07:04] The Scholar said those tens of thousands
[2:07:06] would have stayed with David
[2:07:11] if he would have stayed in Jerusalem
[2:07:14] they would have followed David but
[2:07:16] because David was a fugitive brother
[2:07:19] Brown said
[2:07:21] they left David
[2:07:23] that tells you where their Revelation
[2:07:25] held
[2:07:28] and many over these years
[2:07:31] have fallen away
[2:07:34] because this message has become a
[2:07:36] fugitive
[2:07:39] but as far as God's concerned
[2:07:42] as God is as far as God is concerned
[2:07:45] this is the anointed word
[2:07:49] of the hour
[2:07:51] and though the tens of thousands
[2:07:53] wouldn't follow David there was a
[2:07:56] handful
[2:07:57] that said
[2:07:59] we are thine
[2:08:01] we're on your side
[2:08:03] David we're going to stand with you in
[2:08:05] the good times
[2:08:06] and the bad times
[2:08:08] whether the israels rejected you or not
[2:08:11] we're going to stand with you
[2:08:16] no matter what
[2:08:21] the Bible says that the weapons
[2:08:24] of our Warfare
[2:08:26] are not physical
[2:08:28] but the weapons
[2:08:30] are divinely powerful look it up in the
[2:08:34] Hebrew Greek
[2:08:37] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[2:08:40] but against principalities and powers of
[2:08:42] wickedness in high places
[2:08:46] but what God has empowered you with
[2:08:49] according to the Greek God has given you
[2:08:52] divine power
[2:08:55] to conquer
[2:08:57] Satan's kingdoms
[2:09:02] and thus Paul writes we destroy
[2:09:07] Satan's kingdoms
[2:09:11] his sophisticated arguments
[2:09:14] it goes also on to say and every exalted
[2:09:18] proud thing that sets itself up against
[2:09:23] the knowledge of God God has given you
[2:09:27] the most powerful weapon on the face of
[2:09:31] the Earth
[2:09:32] and that is his word
[2:09:35] and the atomic bomb is prayer
[2:09:46] brother Brown goes on to say then how
[2:09:48] can we do anything else under the fifth
[2:09:50] seal
[2:09:51] how can we do anything else besides the
[2:09:54] power that God has released to us
[2:09:59] we're not talking about man ox
[2:10:04] we're not talking about a line we're
[2:10:06] talking about eagle
[2:10:07] and you heard about it
[2:10:09] the biggest
[2:10:10] chicken scratcher around
[2:10:14] I like that Mike
[2:10:17] object lesson
[2:10:22] we have been anointed
[2:10:25] by an anointing
[2:10:27] that has been released in this hour
[2:10:30] to conquer anything
[2:10:32] Satan has thrown against you
[2:10:36] and that's the only Power you can work
[2:10:39] by
[2:10:42] that's the only Power that works
[2:10:44] people don't want to get in the message
[2:10:45] no power
[2:10:47] you you know you don't put gas in a a
[2:10:50] lawnmower what happens
[2:10:53] it's a glorified push something
[2:10:56] it's not even a lawnmower can't even cut
[2:10:59] nothing but if you go if you don't if
[2:11:01] you get power to it
[2:11:03] it becomes what it was intended for
[2:11:07] and if you've got the power of God
[2:11:09] living in you
[2:11:11] you're going to have the power that has
[2:11:13] been intended for to defeat the enemy
[2:11:17] in laodicea
[2:11:19] lion oxman eagle
[2:11:22] we are under the power of God to defeat
[2:11:26] the Devil anytime
[2:11:29] any place
[2:11:33] we all know the quote
[2:11:36] let's do it

[2:11:42] word only but we're what

[2:11:54] Greek means power to perform to promise

[2:12:01] to this promise

[2:30:46] I am
[2:30:55] [Applause]
[2:31:02] en
[2:31:06] I'd like to read to you the quote that
[2:31:09] um
[2:31:10] was
[2:31:12] said uh quite a bit
[2:31:15] it says now remember this Christ in the
[2:31:18] true church
[2:31:20] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[2:31:26] he says but the Book of Revelation shows
[2:31:30] how that the Antichrist spirit
[2:31:34] would come into the church and defile it
[2:31:39] and make it lukewarm
[2:31:42] formal and Powerless
[2:31:46] it would expose Satan revealing his
[2:31:50] works
[2:31:53] attempted destruction of God's people
[2:31:57] and the discrediting of God's word
[2:32:01] right down to the time he is cast into
[2:32:05] the Lake of Fire he fights that
[2:32:08] he cannot stand it he knows that if this
[2:32:13] people
[2:32:14] gets the true revelation
[2:32:18] of the true church
[2:32:21] and what she is
[2:32:24] and what she stands for
[2:32:34] yes right
[2:32:38] and that she can do the greater work
[2:32:44] basically what Tom's telling you brother
[2:32:47] Tom excuse me
[2:32:49] you can do the greater work what are you
[2:32:52] standing for
[2:32:54] the formula is always in God's word
[2:32:58] she can do the great work she will be an
[2:33:01] invincible Army
[2:33:03] all right now you got to follow it all
[2:33:05] the way through sure
[2:33:07] if they can get the true revelation of
[2:33:11] the two spirits
[2:33:14] in the that the revelation of the
[2:33:18] of the two Spirits within the framework
[2:33:23] of the Christian church
[2:33:26] and by God's spirit discern
[2:33:30] wow
[2:33:31] and withstand the Antichrist spirit
[2:33:38] you know what it means to apply the
[2:33:40] token
[2:33:42] what it means to apply the token is you
[2:33:45] look through your life and you find the
[2:33:47] devil
[2:33:51] you find that Spirit you find that thing
[2:33:54] and you identify it
[2:33:58] you got a Tormentor
[2:34:01] you gotta have it that torments you you
[2:34:05] gotta call it what it is you gotta
[2:34:09] separate yourself from it
[2:34:12] you got to discern that this is the
[2:34:17] devil
[2:34:20] anything that's anti-word is
[2:34:23] Antichrist
[2:34:25] this is not the world right right this
[2:34:29] is not the thinking of God this is not
[2:34:32] what God does
[2:34:34] every good and perfect thing comes from
[2:34:38] the father above the father tempted no
[2:34:41] man
[2:34:43] right right so in other words this this
[2:34:47] is not a listening message right it's a
[2:34:52] doer message we heard that right that
[2:34:54] was in the sermon tonight so we got to
[2:34:57] start looking at things
[2:35:00] that are ungodly
[2:35:03] worldly yeah not true right right Satan
[2:35:07] is the accuser of the brethren
[2:35:10] but it can't be laid to your charge
[2:35:13] but you're letting Satan lay it to your
[2:35:16] charge here letting that luck yeah
[2:35:18] that's me I'm terrible no he can't lay
[2:35:21] that to you
[2:35:23] identify him right Satan you're a liar
[2:35:26] liar Satan this is not me I am not I'm
[2:35:30] not going to take this sickness I am not
[2:35:32] going to take his habit I am not going
[2:35:35] to take this disease I am going to apply
[2:35:38] the token
[2:35:41] another father God says applying the
[2:35:44] token was casting it out
[2:35:48] yes sir click get it out yeah call it
[2:35:52] what it is
[2:35:54] identify it
[2:35:56] amen so if there's something going on
[2:35:58] identify it identify it for what it is
[2:36:01] don't take credit for it
[2:36:05] exactly exactly
[2:36:07] don't be in fellowship with it
[2:36:11] tell it you hate it
[2:36:13] I hate that I get angry I hate that I
[2:36:17] get mad it's the devil I hate that I
[2:36:20] lust I hate that I have bad thoughts I I
[2:36:23] hate that I'm lazy
[2:36:28] [Applause]
[2:36:30] yeah I found one thing I was a pastor
[2:36:35] you know who borrows money from me the
[2:36:37] most
[2:36:38] the people who don't pay their ties
[2:36:42] it's like clockwork
[2:36:49] identify this stuff yeah
[2:36:51] I mean what else can God do he told you
[2:36:54] who you are
[2:36:55] okay but you've got to understand after
[2:36:58] you know who you are yeah
[2:37:01] I I remember preaching this to you that
[2:37:04] after we know who we are right then we
[2:37:07] got to know what were to do
[2:37:14] we've got something to do and what we've
[2:37:17] got to do first is identify the devil in
[2:37:20] our lives right
[2:37:22] identify where he's tormenting us from
[2:37:25] identify him when he's on our children
[2:37:27] identify him wherever he's at discern it
[2:37:32] call it out he tries to appear as an
[2:37:36] angel of Light he tries to put fluffy
[2:37:39] Wings on him in a little Halo on himself
[2:37:41] and just said no no it doesn't line up
[2:37:44] with the word is what
[2:37:47] Antichrist identify the Antichrist
[2:37:50] spirit and with
[2:37:54] stand it
[2:37:55] then she becomes yes sir
[2:37:59] I mean just the fact that you all jump
[2:38:01] up and say I'm it yeah yeah
[2:38:04] that's half of it yes
[2:38:07] now what do you got to do with who you
[2:38:10] are
[2:38:12] what do you have to do with the power
[2:38:16] that was
[2:38:18] Reviving you tonight by the preaching of
[2:38:22] the word of God that brought you to your
[2:38:25] feet
[2:38:26] the whole idea of this gospel is to get
[2:38:31] it out of religion and put it in reality
[2:38:34] living
[2:38:38] find the devil
[2:38:40] sir
[2:38:41] find them
[2:38:43] hunt them down
[2:38:46] go after them
[2:38:49] beat your plowshares into swords
[2:38:54] and go fight the fight apply the token
[2:38:57] start getting rid of the devil
[2:39:01] get them out of your life
[2:39:04] let's start with standing up
[2:39:07] let's start Discerning them yeah
[2:39:10] yeah let's find them where he's at let's
[2:39:12] look over turn every stone in your life
[2:39:15] find out if he's hiding somewhere
[2:39:21] I remember going through a real hard
[2:39:23] time
[2:39:25] I couldn't figure it out
[2:39:28] and I remember being on an airplane
[2:39:31] and just my heart just thinking you know
[2:39:35] what is it
[2:39:38] and all of a sudden come by a little
[2:39:39] conversation I had with somebody
[2:39:43] in something mean I said
[2:39:48] oh it seems so simple I just thought oh
[2:39:50] God
[2:39:51] can that be it
[2:39:54] and I remember I went and made that
[2:39:56] right
[2:39:58] I tell you a ton of bricks lifted off me
[2:40:04] I couldn't imagine something so long you
[2:40:07] know what the
[2:40:09] scripture says
[2:40:11] and this is to you
[2:40:13] love hides a multitude of sins
[2:40:17] never broadcasts that never calls
[2:40:21] anybody never tells them
[2:40:24] right and that's why they don't have the
[2:40:27] victory because it's broadcasted
[2:40:32] take it to the blood
[2:40:33] [Music]
[2:40:35] if it's a devil if it's a spirit if it's
[2:40:39] a hardship somebody's going through
[2:40:42] you hurt tonight
[2:40:45] that you have power over that
[2:40:47] amen Prophet if God said sometimes you
[2:40:51] have to believe for somebody else
[2:40:53] because they don't have the faith too
[2:40:58] but that's what we want to do we want to
[2:41:01] become a real church that's just not a
[2:41:05] believer
[2:41:06] but a liver
[2:41:07] [Music]
[2:41:10] a doer
[2:41:12] of God's word no big eyes no little use
[2:41:16] everybody in here's a devil fighter
[2:41:22] amen we're the army of the Living God
[2:41:25] we're the Church of the Living God we're
[2:41:28] gonna find them yep we're gonna defeat
[2:41:31] them and we're going to deliver who's
[2:41:34] ever under is bondage do you believe
[2:41:36] that
[2:41:37] do amen that's
[2:41:41] what I think he's saying to us tonight
[2:41:43] here
[2:41:44] [Music]
[2:41:45] at our Tabernacle
[2:41:47] [Music]
[2:41:49] the people that are assembled in this
[2:41:51] area
[2:41:52] [Music]
[2:41:53] I think every sermon
[2:41:56] the whole thing that we've been through
[2:41:58] through the last few months
[2:42:00] it's bringing us to this place
[2:42:04] it's time we recognize
[2:42:07] and discern the Antichrist spirit
[2:42:10] and we stand up Glory
[2:42:16] and when you do that
[2:42:18] that's when you become
[2:42:21] an invincible Army do you believe you
[2:42:24] can do that you know I'm not a singer
[2:42:26] what are you playing
[2:42:28] okay
[2:42:30] I think you all know that right
[2:42:33] How great is our God
[2:42:36] are you willing to look around and see
[2:42:38] if there's any place
[2:42:41] if he's got any hold
[2:42:44] he's a snake you know he'll hide under a
[2:42:47] rock
[2:42:51] he'll hide somewhere
[2:42:56] but are you willing to say Lord I want
[2:42:58] to be totally exposed
[2:43:01] I want you to search every part of my
[2:43:05] being
[2:43:06] and when I see something that's not
[2:43:08] right I'm not going to say that's me I'm
[2:43:11] going to say that's him yeah exactly
[2:43:14] that's the devil
[2:43:16] that's the devil
[2:43:18] that's the devil you might say well I
[2:43:20] got an awful lot of devils yeah but you
[2:43:23] got an awful big God
[2:43:27] right if your heart condemns you God is
[2:43:31] greater than your heart I just think
[2:43:33] we've laid down a little bit
[2:43:36] and let him take too much of our land
[2:43:41] we've let him take too much of our
[2:43:43] possessions it's time to drive them out
[2:43:45] try to drive Mouse try time to apply the
[2:43:49] token and claim back
[2:43:51] what's ours
