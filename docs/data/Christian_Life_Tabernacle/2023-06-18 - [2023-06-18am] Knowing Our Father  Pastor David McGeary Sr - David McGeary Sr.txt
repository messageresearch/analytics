blessing is being a son and Man's brother Joe Mont said we have a father Lord that's what we're thankful for this morning amen we're going to read uh out of Psalm 68 this morning it's applicable uh thank you [Applause] I wanna just exhort you and remind you this morning you know we saved the course forget about yourself concentrate on him and worship him sometimes it's hard to do we we rush about we work during the week we set aside things and say well I want to get to church on time and things always come up whether it be traffic or you know the sink won't turn off whatever it is uh we try to rush rush rush we try to put on our best clothes and we look in the mirror and make sure we've got everything just right the ties straight the the barrettes in the right place all these things we can lay all that aside just forget about yourself concentrate on him and worship him and we I believe there's a true beauty of holiness we can look around and say my I appreciate being in this congregation more than anywhere I'm at during the week there's not a place we'd rather be in the right here with with the majority of whom we're going to spend eternity with just think of that if you can't get along with people next to you here are you worthy of that place the Lord has Provisions I tell you we uh we're blessed in that we're at the very end of time when God is completely revealed himself I was reading in Exodus chapter 6. God spoke to Moses and said unto him I am the Lord my Bible says that's Jehovah he said I had appeared under Abraham Isaac and Jacob by the name of God almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them he had things in store for Moses and the people that were in Egypt at that time became Jehovah to them what is God to you today what has he delivered you from he said I am he's a current God ever present help in the time of need whatever you have need of this morning he's here he's able to provide we just lay aside everything enter into a special place of worship where it's you and him and he's Duty Bound by his word to be here and to meet that need I fully believe that and the Bible says you were some you were Darkness not in darkness ye were Darkness and Light came and and light always manifests okay you can't hide from light it manifests all things amen so let's uh let's just stand we're going to read through the 19th verse you know and I I studied that Jehovah if you look in the uh the fourth verse says extold him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah j a h you know the strong concordance says that's a shortened version of Jehovah and but it's Hebrew and it goes back to the uh they call it a tetragrammatin I think is the uh the acronym j h w h which became Yahweh uh is God it's Jehovah God and I'm thankful he said there remaineth the rest for the people of God before the gospel was preached they didn't enter into rest because they mixed it with unbelief we don't want to have that unbelief this morning we want to enter into his rest we're here gather together on the Sabbath and that Sabbath was a type of rest it's not a holy day that we keep out of tradition it's his rest we come in here let's lay aside everything and rest rest on God's word amen to have his provision amen and we look uh let's see somewhere down here the Psalms 10 also speaks of fathers and he says that he's a friend of the fatherless we're going to read in here uh in verse 5 it says he's a father of the fatherless and the judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation and I like this verse God setteth the solitary in families you know you can claim to be a loner but you're not going to go by yourself there's a family of God and I'm glad I'm part of it let's just read together through the 19th verse Psalm 68 blessed be the name of the Lord let God arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of God but let the righteous be glad let them Rejoice before God yea let them exceedingly Rejoice amen sing unto God sing praises to his name extol him that wideth upon the heavens by his name job and rejoice before him a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation God said at the solitarian families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in the dry land oh God when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst March through the Wilderness Selah the Earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of God even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God the god of Israel thou o God did Ascend the plentiful rain whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o God has prepared of thy goodness for the poor the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it Kings of armies did flee a pace and she that teared at home divided the spoil though ye have leaned among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and are feathers with yellow gold when the almighty scattered Kings in it it was white as snow and sound the hill of God is as the hill of Bashan a hill as high as a hill of beisham while leap year high hills this is the hill which God desire to dwell in yea the Lord will dwell in it forever the Chariots of God are twenty thousand even thousands of Angels the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the Holy Place thou has ascended on high thou has led captivity captive thou has received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with his benefits even the god of our Salvation God bless you amen I'm gonna have your seats I believe

kindness to us your love for us Lord we're just ask the question that others have asked me for what is man that you're mindful of them what are we father that your thoughts towards us are good and kind World honors the natural fatherhood today Lord but we honor the father of all things and we ask you to bless us this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you if you have your Bibles this morning Happy Father's Day to all the fathers um so we're we're always grateful for that good things that God does for us we want to turn to first John in our scripture reading this morning just the first few verses of First John and anyway we'll try to read there first John 1 and 1. first John 1 and 1. it says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life for the life was was manifested and we have seen it and bear Witness and show unto you that eternal life which was in the father and was manifest unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy might be full Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word test this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you know I was thinking this morning you know that uh Father's Day really doesn't get the recognition that Mother's Day gets and uh but but that's okay you know our our mothers are kind of stuck with us and the hard Parts uh I'm not saying this to my credit I'm saying this to my shame but I didn't change very many diapers so um you know but Mom's always there you know what I mean but you know I I was also thinking about the difference how things change over time you know when we had Mother's Day it used to be tradition in our family that we always served mother breakfast in bed and uh I just were thinking on that today and I thought man she must have dreaded that because you know we bring in all the crumbs and everything and put the tray up in front of her and she would have to eat all that food that we ruined and she but she just sat there grinning and thanking the lord and everything and I I just thought on those things this morning how grateful I am Leslie's flown out to San Diego to take my mom back to Michigan to where she grew up and and to be out there and just kind of completing that great cycle of life and uh you know you realize that any day now that she could be taken from me you know maybe even while she's there and so I'm going to fly out next weekend to be with my mom up there with my cousins who I haven't seen very much and with my mom make sure she's good she has everything she needs and you know I often think about what brother Billy Paul told me one time and he said you know my dad called his mother every day and and I said wow that's wonderful and he said he said but you know he told me he said I should have gone seen her and you know some of those things just cut you sometimes because you don't you realize that you don't really give the honor and respect and you know one of The Commandments of God is to honor your father and your mother and there's a blessing that goes with that and the blessing that goes with that's a long life um you know I I feel sorry for many people they've they don't have fathers I mean they have fathers but they don't have fathers you know and you know the father is that definition covers uh a wide range of items and for so when we speak of a father naturally what our first thought is as one who procreates life or causes birth but the father goes the definition goes well beyond that it some of the definitions read like this I like some of these it's it's the original cause of so the if you are the father you're the original cause of so that's the father that we want to talk about this morning the one that was in the beginning in the beginning was the father I amen it means the original cause of the founder or the producer the author of uh uh so those are those are terminologies we use for the father we say the father of our country is George Washington I think they say I'm not sure on this but I think they say Thomas Edison the father of electricity or maybe Benjamin Franklin I don't know but but we call these people the the father of the railroad the father of this the father of this team engine you know I guess singer was the father of the sewing machine but he he's the original founder and we bestow honor on uh the uh a person that's a father or a founder and uh we we give them a a form of recognition maybe a plaque or uh something of of that but there's another uh meaning of father that I think is even greater than the one that found something because you can found something and abandon it you you understand you can start something and and and and then abandon it or have a change of heart our country today is cursed with so many single parents and and uh and uh and it comes from weak homes you know people and parents not sitting down with their children especially their young daughters and and expressing them the importance of keeping themselves and and tell they have marriage and you have so many fatherless children they have a father but they don't have a father in this form of the definition that we want to emphasize this morning they don't have a father that accepts responsibility so we're talking about a father the the attribute of a father is one that accepts responsibility and uh or if I could say it that or takes care of or raises something that they're going to Father it they're going to uh tutor it and teach it and Mentor it and guide it that's that's the kind of fatherhood that you have many people have had a their natural father but somebody else stepped up and took the the act of fatherhood and they should receive just as much honor maybe even uh more so maybe through life circumstances uh you were in that situation where you had a stepfather or maybe your father had passed on or maybe there was a divorce uh early in your childhood and you didn't uh you didn't have uh a father and maybe somebody came along and and of a venture mom and they stepped into that responsibility and you know this this is the world we live in today that's the reality of it we have many circumstances and many situations today that are are very difficult and we have to navigate through them and people come and and with all kinds of great uh things that have transpired but uh the this father in the natural may have stepped up into your life or or your circumstances and took care of you and took responsibility and and raised you and and and to me that's a great thing I honor that I I respect it I I hold it dear in my heart anybody's cool uh Mentor or father uh a lot of even times in communities and neighborhoods uh there might be a child in the neighborhood and maybe one of the neighbors just takes that kid under its arm and and talks a little bit about to them and maybe share some fishing or hunting stories or give them a little pocket knife to whittle or something somebody that expresses care or wants to teach somebody something who wants to Mentor somebody train somebody has that kind of love that goes out that great fatherly love that great attribute of God act and I love that when I see that attribute come through human beings because we're getting into such a Godless Society in such a time that people don't care for one another they don't they don't they don't take thought of the effect that their actions okay I have and the influence that their actions has uh bullying sometimes is what spoke a lot in school and and I guess they have nowadays they call an internet bullying where they can put chats out there and Echo whatsapps and that's apps and back saps and all kinds of zaps and apps about out there and and that can actually say things about people and they don't realize in the influence that they're having the hurtful things that are are are being said and so there's a great influence and I I appreciate anybody that takes the time to have positive influence you know just to stop by a child or so maybe and just say some nice thing to them you know how are you today or boy that's a good job or or something like that something that has a fountain of love that flows from it that's an expression of goodness and an expression of kindness something that'll help somebody along the way so many times I heard our Messengers say I just want to say or do something to help somebody along the way to be conscious of that and I think it's important that all of us even I I say this in a way to we would say to our sisters the attribute of motherhood which really fatherhood and motherhood are really the same thing but they just come from a different Source in a different part but they all play a role of influencing and and having an effect so the real father and motherhood that we're talking about is something that proceeds from somebody that goes out from somebody that they they're giving of themselves and so they accept responsibility and those are going to care for somebody they're going to raise and tutor and do those great things and uh when you you see that you you understand that as a Christian that's what we're joined to we're joined to our father as John says our True Fellowship is with the father is with the father and I I reflected back um maybe this would be a little personal this morning I mean not try to be long but I I was thinking back today about my father my Earthly father and maybe you can join in me in this uh maybe you can't I don't know but I realized how little I really knew about my father you know how really I I how little I really knew what that he went through the things that he experienced okay how he felt uh and you've got to understand that here's a person that's going to influence my life that's going to talk to me that where he takes me are going to be the things that I eat and the things that I like the things that he uh that he his viewpoints are going to be the viewpoints that he passes on to me if you were born in a certain home maybe of a certain political persuasion it's probably pretty certain that you come up in that persuasion if you're born in a religious persuasion it pretty much of an opportunity you'll come up in that religious persuasion if you were born in a Jewish Home and and you were raised that way and you prayed that way and you ate that way and and you were served that way that became your life if you were being influenced by the the founder of that in your life what what the original source of influence was to you and it molded you and it shaped you and it made you what you are and uh and I I I I sat there I thought you know hear my father uh had so much influence on my life but I wondered what made him and I remember I got glimpses my mom would begin to start to share it to me about my father and give me glimpses that my my father uh um parents separated at a young age and he was raised basically raised himself you know and he had to make himself he had to struggle you know I didn't know what those struggles were you know yeah he he didn't have a lot of clothes and a lot of shoes and a lot of those things and all those things had had a very tremendous effect on on what made him not being raised with the mom he had a dog that uh that was like his best pal you know that waited for him at school and and all those things as a kid that that raised up and and uh and so as I I thought about it and I I thought through it and I was thinking you know uh what how how little I really knew about him i i as growing up I I know that my my father and he uh he put himself through school graduated from school he was played football and and Lacrosse I guess and and put all those things for school and signed up for the Navy and I was working you know getting a job and doing to all those things and I just had these glimpses I know him as a person you don't understand that I called Dad that raised me and worked and and uh uh took me to work and because of the way that my dad was that he had to work and he had to labor and and he had uh do all the things that that he did that that would have an influence in an effect on me it's going to make my personality it's going to mold me and I I'm getting to something as I'm talking about my dad and each of you have yours or or some form of influence in your life but uh I remember my dad became a school teacher now I didn't know him as a school teacher I mean he was teaching school when I was born and he was a a man that was given to um human Justice and humans right causes I guess in a way that you might call them today he he had a form of activism about him and as a as a school teacher he saw a lot of injustices uh in the labor force and things of those things so my father founded the first teachers union in all of the country actually got organized teachers together for further rights of the teachers you know I never realized all that that he had done what that took what that meant what effort he put for that I remember that when I was a child he ran for to be a member of the school board because he didn't like the way the direction of education and he didn't like the way the administration controlled things and he wanted greater rights these are all parts of things that were in my father that were influencing me that I never really understood and then later on he left teaching I don't know why and he became an electrical contractor and was president of the electricians Union and I I don't want to go into the personal sides of those things but I began to look out and I have a source of influence in my life that has done all these great exploits and and uh founded things and ran for offices and all these things and and I thought how little I really know about him you know that personal uh I I A lot of times I think uh I would like to ask you more now and talk to them more you know what I mean found out more of the reasons and the causes you know uh what happened you know uh you know my mom and my dad stuck together a lot of marriages don't stick together today and it causes questions in our hearts and in our minds we don't know why those things and how I'd like this to sit down and and talk about what it was like in the depression you know well it was like how the changes have come how the things have gained this great the the person that has the most influenced on my life naturally how little I know really about and how little time I took to really draw close and and to consider his feelings what he went through in life what his struggles were what his Visions were you know to look at him as a man you know as a child you're always looking up and and you so much is just taken for granted you know you just take them for granted that's what Dad does he gets up in the morning and he goes to work every day you know you think why you know if you don't real you know we sometimes fall so short of giving respect because we don't know what the cause and of the of the respect should be yourself we don't know what he's doing so we really can't respect it the way he should but you know every day he'd get up and he'd go to work and he'd be in his office and bidding jobs and and doing all the stuff you know and and uh I never understood what all that took that was just what Dad did but what was motivating him what was doing it why he did those things those are all things now that my father's passed on but they're all things now I would have loved to have had fellowship with him in but I never even considered that that Fellowship was there for me to have you know if I'd have sat down and opened the door and and and just speak to him and of course now uh you would love to do that and if you have the opportunity now you know learn what you can learn I remember in my life I I I've always I I'm I've been a worker I just work that's because my dad took me to work he needed a Helper and I worked with him from all through school and all through the Summers no I enjoyed it you know what I mean he taught me electrical he taught me construction he taught me a lot of the things that I was in and I I sit back and I think now I said You know here I had this great influence in my life I had a person that my political views were no doubt influenced and and my tastes my Foods my culture where he raised me that I ended up where I raised in California and all those things have a great impact in how that now I sit back and how much I really knew about that man as a man how much what really made him tick and and what his motives were and what his of objectives were and I could never have that opportunity even though after many years now it's something that I long for maybe because I've come to that place of maturity I remember one time he called me unless they answered the phone and and he said to Leslie where's David he he and she said he's in the bathroom he's got the toilet off the because one of the kids stuck a hairbrush down the thing you know so I and I could just hear him laughing ah Vengeance he said you know now you know what comes around what goes around you know and then I realize those are things that I did you know uh we did how many times did I see those two legs sticking out underneath the car to fix it if all the struggle that he went through to survive and I looked at it now and I sit back this morning and I think you know how little I knew about the greatest influence in my natural life and I thought that was my father and now I I sit back and I think well you know something I have another father and he's my original father he was my first father in fact he used my great-grandfather my grandfather and my father to bring me here this this other if I could I just to say it in this light forgive the word but my other father my original father My real father the one that was the original cause he was the original cause of me my natural father he was the the method by which God by the union the scripture brother Branham tells us with mother brought us here and yet our seed was in our fathers and our fathers and our fathers back and and all those characteristics and attributes came down how many times have you looked at somebody said well you look like your mother you know I mean or you look like your father it's like teenagers they don't want to be identified so they go sit off by themselves you know and everybody's looking at them like I'm here by myself but yet they look just like their dad you know they look just like they're they're a mother you know the you can't separate yourself from that but so we have another father this morning my Earthly father has passed on and all the things and I trust that he's in the hands of God he wasn't a religious man uh he was a fair and just man but the prophet of God said all that you loved and all that loved you would be there and I I hold to the fact because my original father and my first father chose me to come through that path that there will be a blessing that lays up in Eternity for them whether they live in that City that's given to the bride but those that live on the outside and come to and fro that God that just God will give them a portion of that Kingdom I'm ashamed of all the things that I never recognized in all the efforts that my father put forth and all what he suffered and gave up the vacations he took us on my dad took a scheme and now I realize how expensive that was how much money he used to spend to take the skiing put us in a cabin to to do those things it the failure of my recognition and respect innocent it astonishes me maybe almost to the form that it almost a a form of of maybe not disrespect but just lack of appreciation their lack of knowledge but now that I look at my first father my original father the one that used my Earthly father to bring me here I thought you know I I don't want to not know him I want to know him okay Mark maybe I didn't have growing up and I got my own concerns and I I walked maybe past and missed the opportunity to honor my father the way I really should have honored him maybe to have the respect for him that I should have really had for him to give him the honor and the recognition that I should have really given them maybe I've passed that but I thought this father I want to know him my original father and I hope you can understand that my first father the one that was the the original cause of me and we know all about predestination and all about the thinking and all about where we are but take all that you know about your where you come from your name being on the Book of Life who you are who your original father is all the the words and definitions that you to describe to describe yourself as a child of God that's what we say this morning I am a child of God I have a father and he knows my name I have a father I have a father that was the cause of my natural father that's my original father and he has put me in a place that I claim to be his child and then the question comes back how well do I know him am I going to can I make the same mistake again well I made it in the natural can that same thing happen to me in the spiritual because I didn't make the effort I didn't take the time I was about my own business I had you know I didn't like some of the influences that he was putting on me as a teenager about being disciplined and what kind of crowds I should hang out with and and why I couldn't be lazy and all the things that he taught us that we rebelled against and I thought Lord I don't want to make that mistake this morning I want to know you I want a fellowship with you I don't want it to be just religion I want it to be personal I want to know you as you are I want to know you for what you are I want to know you for your attributes may I say it like this to you this morning I want to know you for your personality what I guess I can say I missed about my natural father is I never understood his personality but now I have an opportunity to know the personality of my original father my first father the one that deserves all respect because I'm trusting him for the soul of my natural father so how do we know Our Father we know our heavenly father through his word and his son we know him through his word for what that is I I don't I so if I'm going to know him and I'm going to take the time because my fellowship is in the father this is what he said our fellowship is in the father this morning we're here and we are here for one another maybe you came to see somebody maybe there's a certain sister here you just got your eye on and the main reason that you're coming to church is that your heart's just a twittering it's all right keep it on us keep it holy keep its pure don't do anything that would seem evil or have uh anything those that's the natural course of life I'm great for that maybe you're here because you just like the people it's the thing to do it's where everybody's going you know we have our community and we're all going to gab and talk and go out and eat and that's fine too I think that's wonderful that should be a part of it but our real Fellowship is in the father that's what we're hearing this morning I'm here this morning to say father I don't want to miss you because when I was in the flesh being growing up my fleshly man wasn't able to comprehend of the what my real Earth but my Earthly father was but now Lord I don't want my spiritual man to miss what you really are so I want to Our Father which heart in heaven Our Father this morning our fellowships in our father and I just thought to talk about what our father is and the scripture says that that he's he God Reveals His nature and his attributes and his person and his nature not only through his works but through his word through his name and we know some of the names of God we sang it this morning I thought it was so perfect Elohim Adonai right we know him as Jehovah Elohim refers to God as the omnipotent creator now this morning do you know him as the Creator of all things but when you think about them and you look out and you look at the stars like that little man on the boat talking that boy he said look around he's in everything that man knew him as the omnipotent Creator he saw the invisible things of God are are clearly seen by the visible things around us God wrote his Bible in the Stars he he becomes the US Elohim to know him in that attribute and have fellowship and that's my heart's desire for this my original father Jehovah the self-existing Lord who reveals himself Jehovah the self-existing standing alone no he had no father he was the father that's why we say our father he was the father and he's the self-existing one who reveals himself oh Jehovah when I say Jehovah what am I saying this great father God that I have it wants to reveal himself to me once they have fellowship with me make himself known one of the great principles that our messenger told us so we could get our eyes on the right thing you can know him this morning but not just know him as a guard God far off but you can know him as the god that wants to reveal himself here this morning you can know your original father you can personally know him know his purposes know his reasons know his wise you can be be close to him crawl up in his lap I thought even my natural I remember every night I'd crawl up in my Daddy's lap and he would sit there and Rock and sing songs to me you know way out in the West there was a little Nest you know you know and saying make he'd Sing Make the World Go Away and he'd sing those songs and rock us and he'd go to bed I want to sit in his lap My real father my original father it says ad and I the master and head of all things there's so many names of God but I just want to take just a moment quick moment this morning to go through the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah the seven manifestation characteristics of our father that he put on display so that we can know him and my question this morning is do I know my father in these attributes I just don't want to know of him I want it to become closer I want it to become more real I want to know that this is the god that's looking after me that's fathering me that's keeping me and training me and raising me that's responsible for me because a father takes on the responsibility and God is taking on the responsibility for your soul and sometimes that means chastisement and correction sometimes that means he's got to put you in a place to force us to sit down and realize I've got to take heed and take note if you keep finding yourself back in the same spot over and over and over again you need to take a good look at what are you missing from the father because he has you covered you understand that it's just we got such thick skulls I mean I do my thoughts goes thick that I just get so angry with myself that why is it so hard for me to learn a lesson so one of the great names of Jehovah if Jehovah Roy the Lord my shepherd it just you know in Psalms it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. just to think about that my father is my shepherd and there is he's he's my shepherd do you know him as a shepherd do you know him when he's in intervenes in your life do you know him when he's guiding your footsteps do you know him when he's shutting doors and opening doors I mean how many doors does he shut we don't even realize it how many doors does he open and it just goes by us how many that we don't even understand that this great father is responsible for our lives he's influencing Our Lives he's in our lives he's dealing with us every day he promised he won't leave us nor forsake us that he be there with us and I think how I want to become conscious of that he's not going to change he's always going to be my shepherd but I can have fellowship with him knowing he's my shepherd being have a fellowship with the father be more aware of that attribute and and his presence in my life and give him respect and honor for it the scripture says he's Jehovah Jireh the Lord my provider isn't that beautiful and Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah jirei as it was said to his day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide as our brothers testimony this morning I want to know him in that attribute because he's a father he's there every day in my life with that attribute he's in there every day of my life providing ho I I gave somebody a gift a little while ago and they just took it stuck it in their pocket didn't even say thank you and I you know I was a little miffed at first and then I realized you know it's just issues you know the poor person's got issues you know he doesn't know how to say thank you and so instead of being upset I thought you know maybe ought to be just more in prayer because how how terrible it must be that you can't say thank you and then I realized that that was a lot to my problems it was just getting something I was thankful but I didn't know how to handle the emotion I didn't know how to say I'm thankful I I wasn't comfortable with that feeling and yet I've got a father that is a provider I want to get comfortable with receiving God's blessings I want to thankful it's a relationship God's pouring His blessings on us because he loves us you know and we can hardly accept it you know like it's got a string attached to it and we're suspicious of our very father that so loved us that he gave his only begotten son oh God I I want my whole relationship with my father to move to a higher level I don't want to miss it like I did in the natural and maybe you have a the opportunity and the natural to build that bridge back with your father build it back take the humble side I did a funeral one time and and I met a man and he was dying with cancer and his daughter had come down to take care of his son had come down to take care of his daughter-in-law was a Believer and the man gloriously came to the Lord and then when it came time for the funeral this man was a rascal he abused his children he he was was a terrible father and when the time for the funeral came Leslie was standing there with me and we knew something was wrong so finally they got enough courage to come up and say we don't want you to tell us all about what God did for him and all this he was a rat and I thought well wait a minute you know I didn't want to go into that they're just as ratty we're all ready but I remember the Lord come down I said you know maybe you had it hard and maybe he wasn't all that he could should have been and if God forgave them that's God's business amazing I can't change that I says but the one thing that you guys can change right now is you're still brothers and sisters you can still love one another you can still have Fellowship one with another and by the time that service is over they were all in the front bawling and holding on to one another why because they found out that they had a father a real father the original father that loved them and God is love and there's no variance in them in every good and perfect gift comes from the father above that's the father they needed to know and that's a father we got to know we call them Jehovah raphi the Lord my healer it says in Exodus lord said and if thou Wilt diligently hearken to my voice of the Lord thy God and we'll do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that he lit thee Hallelujah do you know him as that not just God's a Healer that he's got the power to heal but to know him in the fellowship that if I keep his Commandments and I live for him and I put him first that he's going to keep things from coming on me [Music] I have that relationship with them I have that fellowship with them I know him as that kind of God I have that fellowship with them Lord I live for you you protect me that's a good thing right I wonder if we start to understand how little that we're really in fellowship with our father and how little we really know him let's don't miss the opportunity our messenger opened the door for us in this age to have True Fellowship with our father Jehovah shalom the Lord my peace then get even built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is yet the Oprah of the I know how to say that aberration that's judges 6 and 24. he called it the Lord is my peace the Lord's a mighty shelter he's a rock that we can run into these are this is the god that keeps making himself known in these great attributes so we can understand that we can have fellowship with them that we can know him as the god that's our peace my peace I give you a peace that's her path understanding we can know him as these things Jehovah nissai the Lord's my banner and Moses built an altar and called the name of the place Jehovah nissai unto this day it is yet and the Oprah I don't know how to say that it's judges 17 15. Zach can you put that up there judges 17 15. not possible okay I just wanted to know how to to say that if they can find it um now I don't know how to say this either but Jehovah to say the kidney the Lord my righteousness and in the days of Judas shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely in this his name whereby he shall call the place the Lord our righteousness that's Jeremiah 23 and 6. Jeremiah 23 and 6. what a beautiful uh of scripture the Lord is my righteousness our righteousness is what filthy ranks oh to know the Lord as your righteousness is there any good thing in us that any of us should boast no my father is my righteousness he is what stands righteous before the Lord I don't he does he's my righteousness he's my Declaration of Faith he's what's standing there holding me close and clean to know him not just about him but to know that he's actually in your life justifying you and cleansing you and forgiving you of all unrighteousness every day every little mistake of the father you confess your sins they go before you and he's right there making it right making it right making it right how many things has he made right in your life where you sowed all kinds of trouble and bitterness and your righteousness was there fixing it up cleaning it up oh the Lord is my righteousness I want to know this God personally I want to know my father my original cause the one who orchestrated all my Generations in the past to come together to produce me the way that I am I oh I want to have that kind of Fellowship with the Lord don't you it says Jehovah Shama the Lord is there for me I was round about 18 000 measures in the name of the city of that day shall be called the Lord is there we have so many wonderful names of the father but all those names were just there so he could he could express himself that we could have Fellowship we we know him we know him through his attributes we know him through his name so we know him through his word in the Old Testament as the recept seven Redemption names of Jehovah that's why when brother Bosworth was arguing with brother best he looked at him he says brother best do the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ he had them right there because the scripture says he's Jehovah my healer amen the Lord that delivereth us from all our diseases amen and we know him we know the father he who hath seen me hath seen the father we know our father through his son no man cometh unto the father but by me so if he's Jehovah of the Old Testament if our father of the Old Testament was manifested in the flesh that we could handle him see him and touch them as we read in John that we could have True Fellowship with our father that's what he came right and let's just talk we can just go quickly through some of the names in closing this morning I hope that you understand my point this morning don't miss coming into Fellowship with your real father [Music] make time to know him make time to spend with them make time to learn of him because the opportunity is eternal he's Redeemer he's the bread of life he's the Lord creator these are all scriptural names and descriptions of him he's the son of the Living God the only begotten son the only begotten of the Father the beloved Son the Holy One of Israel he's all those things he's wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace just think this morning we're not here to worship afar off we're here to have fellowship with the father His Holy Spirit which he is the Holy Spirit coming in our lives making himself known so you can walk out and you can grow in life and you can say I know God not I know about God I know God that's what he wants right he's Jehovah let God who reveals himself we could just talk so many things about the Lord all that he is and and all the great things that he is he's the head of the church the almighty the Alpha and Omega the king of the Jews the high priest the prophet the teacher Emmanuel God With Us an advocate those are all descriptive names of Jesus in the New Testament that he has he's a mediator the judge the Chief Cornerstone the author and finisher of our faith the Lamb of God the Good Shepherd the shepherd and Bishop of our souls Hallelujah he's the shepherd and the bishop of our soul you know Bishop is is one that that is responsible for delegating The Authority that caused things to happen he's the bishop of your souls he's going to cause things to happen in your life that are pertaining to the value of your soul not the increase of your flesh what would you rather have nothing in eternal life oh what does that Prophet the man if he gains the whole world loses his Souls just think to know him as the one that's responsible for your soul and is The Shepherd of your soul and the bishop of your soul I'm glad my soul is not in my hands I'm glad that I'm in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me in I'm glad to know if he started a good work in me he'll finish it till the end but I want to know him in that Fellowship I don't just want to be about my business and every once in a while God's got us give me a good SWOT to bring me back the realization that he is there he's there every day every moment every hour loving us and keeping us and making a way for us and providing for us because he's the father the father of light is a challenge to know him but I want to let you know this morning the opportunity is there and maybe I miss the opportunity in the natural but I don't have to miss the opportunity in the spiritual there's so many things that he is he's the word the Fountain of Living Waters he's the rock the True Vine the branch the bridegroom the day spring Shalom Lord Lion of the tribe of Judah Brighton morning Spa the invisible image of the invisible God the I am the way the truth the life he's Christ the anointed how many people in life would long to know a great person or somebody who's famous oh you know I'd like to know maybe a a certain baseball star or something I remember Aaron my son Aaron he liked baseball and he had a picture of Julio Franco playing for the Rangers on his wall you know Julio Franco just the baseball player he just he held this bat real funny you know and and as a kid he just said you know I wouldn't it be nice to know Julio Franco and one day Ronnie took and Aaron went to a little baseball luncheon and Ronnie went over and mentioned to Julio Franco and Julio Franco came over and talked to Aaron Aaron told me he's a Christian Julio Franco said I'm a Christian and when Julio Franco would come into town he'd call Aaron up and they go hang out together and he'd go over to this room and talk to him and and so what used to be a star and an idol became a friend Jesus says you are my friends not like an idol not like a foreign object not like somebody that's a far off somewhere but someone you can know personally and real and you can say I have a father and all that he is he is to me and I am fellowshipping with him and know him in the power of His might in the power of his resurrection I know him just like those demons told those sense of seethers clinically he said Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you you how many times do we ask people do you know what you're talking about no you can know your father this morning don't let the opportunity to go when you walk out these doors this morning and look up and say father God you are the reason I'm here and you said I could know you I could have fellowship with you I can walk with
