[30:06] [Music]
[30:33] there
[30:39] is amen do you believe that
[30:43] tonight amen I I just felt led of the
[30:46] spirit tonight to play uh a portion of a
[30:52] sermon called well it's really the whole
[30:55] sermon uh from the scripture
[30:58] forward called taking sides with Jesus
[31:02] and we'll uh turn to the St John the 9th
[31:07] chapter and the 26th to the 35th
[31:12] verse um you know I I A lot of times
[31:19] I you know something will come on my
[31:21] heart and when anything ever comes on my
[31:24] heart I always try to shake it
[31:28] and you know talk myself out of it but
[31:32] if it keeps coming back and it keeps
[31:34] pressing and I can't get away from it
[31:38] then I become a prisoner to that I don't
[31:40] know how to explain that to you but if
[31:43] you've ever had something on your heart
[31:46] it it finally it consumed you and I just
[31:49] got consumed with playing this and as I
[31:53] listen to it uh
[31:56] myself I I begin to
[31:59] see the wisdom in it and if I could say
[32:03] it like this I begin to see the prophecy
[32:06] in it and I never thought that I would
[32:12] see the
[32:13] day that our country is developing such
[32:18] a negative attitude towards
[32:20] church now it's under the cover of
[32:24] sickness and disease you know
[32:28] and uh trying to make out the church you
[32:32] know the governor of
[32:34] Washington asked the churches if they
[32:37] would
[32:38] please stop having
[32:40] Services the governor of
[32:43] California ask the churches if they
[32:46] would please stop having
[32:49] services and you know it throws you into
[32:52] such a
[32:53] dilemma and but you can't you a man's
[32:56] got to sue serve either God or Mana you
[33:01] know what I mean and as we as we
[33:05] navigate our
[33:07] way it seems like I wanted to say this
[33:11] to you as you know a friend more than as
[33:16] a
[33:16] pastor but as we TR try to navigate our
[33:20] way we're going places we've never been
[33:23] before and this whole idea of the
[33:26] pandemic this whole idea of not seeing
[33:28] anybody and talking to anybody it seems
[33:32] like it's robbing us from an
[33:35] opportunity to serve God to do good
[33:39] works to
[33:41] testify and one of the beautiful points
[33:45] that I believe that brother Brandon
[33:47] makes in this message is taking sides
[33:50] with him is serving
[33:53] him and I I hope that you can hear that
[33:57] as he brings it out it's a very
[33:58] wonderful tape to listen to It's it's
[34:02] not a tape where he's going into the
[34:05] mysteres or the seals or the third pole
[34:09] or the son of man Ministry this is also
[34:12] part of the message where he deals with
[34:14] our everyday life I believe you'll enjoy
[34:18] it I I I I'm trusting the Lord that I by
[34:22] me being obedient imp plain this that he
[34:25] will come and standad stand
[34:28] behind his word and that it'll bless
[34:32] your heart and you'll be blessed by it
[34:36] so what we'll do is we'll say a short
[34:38] prayer we'll play the uh uh the
[34:42] scriptures and at the end of the
[34:45] scriptures uh brother brand will say now
[34:48] I'd like to just speak uh a minute to
[34:52] you
[34:52] Brethren and and
[34:55] uh and at that point you can sit down
[34:59] okay and and just enjoy the word soak it
[35:02] up let it speak to you and I I I you
[35:06] know I'm not a type of person I know
[35:08] that that uh builds a lot of confidence
[35:12] but uh if anything else I'm playing to
[35:15] you the message of the hour and I think
[35:17] it'll bless you tonight so let's pray
[35:20] our gracious father Lord I feel that
[35:23] your spirit has directed our body
[35:28] to listen to
[35:30] this message
[35:33] that you Prophet brought to the church I
[35:36] believe it's fitting for the things that
[35:39] we're facing and the things that's being
[35:41] said and the spirit that's getting
[35:44] developed in the land father I believe
[35:48] there's wisdom and
[35:50] prophecy and instruction in
[35:54] righteousness contained in this hour and
[35:57] 12 minutes minutes that we're going to
[35:58] listen to I ask that you bless it to the
[36:02] heart that your spirit comes by each one
[36:05] and addresses something in their life
[36:08] something in their thinking something in
[36:11] their situation father and give them
[36:14] some of the Mana that's been stored up
[36:17] for us to listen to this evening I ask
[36:20] it in the wonderful and precious name of
[36:22] the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you our
[36:25] Messenger as we listen to him min
[36:28] taking sides with Jesus to us God bless
[36:31] you now in St John the 9th chapter I
[36:35] want to read from the 26th verse until
[36:39] the 35th now just for a few minutes and
[36:42] then we'll we'll close in the next 20 or
[36:45] 30 minutes or maybe before that time the
[36:48] Lord willing now I want to read these
[36:50] scriptures now from St John 26 to uh St
[36:54] John 10 9 uh 26 to 5 I've got rot down
[36:58] here this something I was thinking of
[37:01] then said they unto him again
[37:04] what did he do to
[37:09] thee how opened he thine
[37:12] eyes and he answered them I have told
[37:15] you already and you did not hear
[37:19] wherefore would you hear
[37:22] again will you also be his
[37:25] disciples then they
[37:28] reviled him and said th his disciples
[37:32] but we are moses' disciples we know that
[37:36] God spake unto Moses but for this fell
[37:39] we know not from whence he
[37:43] is the man answered and said unto
[37:46] them why herein is a marvelous thing
[37:51] that you know not from whence he is and
[37:54] yet he has opened mine eyes
[37:58] now we know that God heareth not Sinners
[38:01] but if any man be a worshipper of
[38:05] God and doeth His will him he heareth
[38:10] since the world began has it not heard
[38:14] that any man has opened the eyes of one
[38:17] that was born
[38:18] blind if this man were not of God he
[38:22] could do nothing then
[38:25] answered they answered and said unto
[38:28] him thou was altogether born in sin and
[38:33] does thou teach us and they cast him
[38:38] out and Jesus heard that they had cast
[38:41] him
[38:41] out and when he had found him he said
[38:44] unto him does thou believe on the Son of
[38:49] God
[38:51] now I'd like to speak just for a few
[38:54] minutes to you Brethren knowing it my
[38:57] little talk here I don't know what will
[39:00] become of it trusting that God will use
[39:03] it in some way and now in this upon his
[39:05] word so I know that brother Saint
[39:08] brother Neville or one of you ministers
[39:09] usually preach and just being here with
[39:11] you uh if you pardon me I just like to
[39:14] speak to you a little bit on this manner
[39:16] now I want to take a subject here of
[39:19] taking sides with
[39:22] Jesus the
[39:24] Pharisees and leaders of his they always
[39:28] tried to belittle him before the
[39:32] people that was just a way that the
[39:36] devil had a
[39:38] working all the Pharisees and the
[39:42] teachers of his day constantly tried to
[39:47] belittle
[39:49] Jesus they all the Thro that they could
[39:52] give to him they done
[39:54] it they watched him constantly to find
[39:58] where they could find a fault and they
[40:00] never spoke of his good things they were
[40:02] always finding something that they could
[40:05] belittle him about and say you see look
[40:09] here if he was a man of God he wouldn't
[40:11] do it this way or if he was a man of God
[40:14] he wouldn't do it that way they were
[40:17] trying to cast The Shadow upon him to
[40:20] get the people to disbelieve him
[40:23] amen that's the work of the devil amen
[40:27] and that old scheme has never
[40:31] ceased there's many times that a
[40:33] minister will make a
[40:35] mistake and if he comes into a
[40:37] neighborhood a precious brother who's
[40:39] trying to do what's right and to lead
[40:41] the people right everything that the
[40:44] devil can point to the unbeliever or the
[40:47] so-called Christian in that neighborhood
[40:50] to throw off on that man he'll do it you
[40:53] know the real Christian way is to hide
[40:56] everything you can from a rather don't
[40:58] tell his bad things just tell his good
[41:01] things just tell what you know about
[41:03] him's good if anything's bad let it
[41:05] alone poor Fell's got enough against him
[41:08] anyhow don't try to take a pole and
[41:10] shove a man further into the ditch the
[41:13] Christian attitude is pick him up and
[41:14] take him out of the ditch don't never
[41:17] try to shove him down he's down already
[41:20] try to help him up and but too many of
[41:24] us today too many people today I might
[41:26] say try to do that if they could just
[41:30] get something and other that they could
[41:32] say that was real bad now for instance
[41:35] of if one of you Brethren make a mistake
[41:38] and do something's wrong which you're
[41:40] subject to do it I am too every one of
[41:44] us but as we go along let's remember we
[41:47] are
[41:49] brothers we are brothers and if we got
[41:51] any fighting let's fight with one
[41:53] another bring it together bring it
[41:55] before our Brethren and settle it
[41:58] now they used to in the Brandon family
[41:59] if one of the little ones done something
[42:01] he's going tell Bill about it because I
[42:02] was the biggest and I had to stand there
[42:04] and see which is right and wrong well my
[42:07] decision was that uh if they uh which
[42:11] one is right and wrong if they still
[42:13] didn't believe it then he got around
[42:14] behind my back and fought it out but
[42:16] they were still Brothers you see they
[42:18] fight in the backyard with one another
[42:20] and fight in the front yard far one
[42:21] another so that's the way it was see it
[42:24] were still Brothers well that that's the
[42:26] way we we got to do this see if you got
[42:30] something against somebody you're a
[42:31] brother don't tell somebody else about
[42:33] if it's wrong go to him and tell
[42:37] him and then if he's going to argue with
[42:40] you then take somebody else with you
[42:42] then bring it up the way the Bible said
[42:44] but
[42:45] Jesus they they just tried to find every
[42:49] little shadow that they could find to
[42:52] try to belittle him in the sight of the
[42:56] people and that's what the devil wants
[42:58] they want to they want to hurt your
[43:01] influence before the people that's why
[43:04] you want to watch careful what you do
[43:07] walk like real man of God talk like man
[43:09] of God see act like man of God live like
[43:12] man of God because a devil your
[43:15] adversary is going about like a roaring
[43:17] line trying to devour what he
[43:19] can why did they do this they were
[43:23] jealous of him amen that was what's the
[43:25] reason they tried to be him they were
[43:28] jealous of his
[43:29] ministry and that's the reason they were
[43:31] trying to belittle but he had the
[43:34] ministry of God and they knew that but
[43:36] it was contrary to their Creed so they
[43:38] were trying to belittle him make
[43:41] everything every little flaw that they
[43:42] could find get him out of the way they
[43:45] want him to quit they wanted the people
[43:47] to denounce him they wanted to say now
[43:50] uh this guy's nothing look here now
[43:52] there he is he he he did this and you
[43:54] know that's not right we've been taught
[43:56] all of our life that we should believe
[43:58] the elders and Y he stood right there
[44:00] and Bal that Elder out he disagreed with
[44:03] the tradition of the fathers and we've
[44:04] been we are to believe the tradition of
[44:07] our fathers we've been taught that by
[44:08] each Rabbi all the years through and
[44:11] here this man comes around and disagrees
[44:12] with them see well the man like that
[44:15] ain't fit to be a preacher see they were
[44:18] trying to belittling but in all of that
[44:22] the ones that believed him and loved him
[44:26] and had seen his scriptural Miracle
[44:28] signs would not be hindered by
[44:32] them no sir them who believed him
[44:35] believed him amen those who loved him
[44:38] stood by him they would not see what
[44:43] others pointed out to them oh if we
[44:46] could do that if we could just not see
[44:49] if somebody come around here say you
[44:51] know what they say you're a Pentecostal
[44:53] not by denomination well you was the you
[44:56] you that kind of baptizes in Jesus name
[44:58] yep that's right well let me tell you
[45:00] something I Know a Man one time was
[45:01] baptized like that and he did so and so
[45:03] but looky that has nothing to do with it
[45:06] it's a devil trying to throw a shadow on
[45:08] you they're always trying to point you
[45:11] to some old ship that got wrecked upon
[45:13] the seashore but they're not pointing to
[45:15] that one that made the void safely
[45:18] that's right that's right they're always
[45:20] trying to throw a crowbait out there and
[45:23] say this is example here's what I did it
[45:26] uh I know a certain preacher that was a
[45:28] Holiness preacher and he did this that
[45:30] the other but they don't point out
[45:32] others that wasn't Holiness did that
[45:34] also you see and they don't point the
[45:36] great things that God did like somebody
[45:38] say oh he this man went too far he he
[45:41] went too far he might have done that he
[45:44] wrecked himself up he went too far he
[45:46] become a fanatic he might have done that
[45:49] but while they're pointing to how many
[45:50] that went one that went too far how
[45:52] about these millions that never went far
[45:55] enough May Fable to see that see what I
[45:58] mean so the people tried them Pharisees
[46:03] and Sadducees and hypocrites and
[46:06] herodians and all tried to cast The
[46:09] Shadow on Jesus but them True
[46:11] Believers that was predestinated to hear
[46:15] that message heard it and see no fault
[46:18] in it at
[46:19] all same now those who believe him love
[46:24] him those who believe him see no fault
[46:27] any amen they don't see any heresy they
[46:29] don't see anything wrong they don't see
[46:31] anything wrong with his word they don't
[46:33] see anything wrong with these people
[46:35] they just see Jesus and that's all
[46:37] they're they're they're predestinate
[46:40] eternal life so they just take sides
[46:42] with Jesus and stay there we used to
[46:44] write sing a little song brother Roy uh
[46:47] roon we used to sing a little song Here
[46:50] guest time you come here I take the way
[46:53] with the Lord's thisp few I started in
[46:56] with Jesus and I'm going through I'd
[46:58] rather walk with Jesus alone and have
[47:00] for my pillow like Jacob a
[47:03] stone you've heard the little song
[47:06] that's right I'd rather take the way of
[47:08] the
[47:09] discard take the way of the despised
[47:13] take the way all the talked about and
[47:16] walk with Jesus see no fault in it at
[47:20] all don't see another fellow's ER just
[47:23] keep on going that's all now that's way
[47:25] they did to Jesus didn't they didn't and
[47:28] you must teach your people you pastors
[47:30] to do the same if somebody comes along
[47:32] and says uh you know uh your church they
[47:34] was so and so they yes sir they maybe a
[47:37] dozen of them sitting there then but how
[47:38] about that one it's it's it's all right
[47:40] sitting there see you're you're you're
[47:43] you just can't see the woods for the
[47:45] trees that's all that's it right back
[47:47] again see now and so they tried they was
[47:52] not willing to admit that he was doing
[47:54] the work of God so they they were trying
[47:57] to so discard and get the people not to
[48:00] believe but them people who believed him
[48:02] stayed right with him they took Sid you
[48:05] know I thought you're a couple of people
[48:07] I got wrote down here the blind man
[48:10] would not be changed by them that man he
[48:13] just gave his sign we know the story and
[48:17] um he gave them a very stinging question
[48:20] beside now they come up there and Jesus
[48:23] walked by and he was a man that was
[48:25] despised hated the Bible said he would
[48:28] be rejected uh there be no beauty of him
[48:31] we should desire him and all we like
[48:34] sheep have gone astray he's a man of
[48:36] sorrow acquainted with grief and how all
[48:39] the Bible said what he would be he'd be
[48:41] despised and
[48:42] rejected and we see that man now those
[48:45] who believe the word they know that the
[48:48] very things that Jesus was doing and the
[48:50] things is of his life they knew who he
[48:53] was so they couldn't put nothing light
[48:55] on him
[48:57] because they couldn't see it am and you
[48:59] know love is blind
[49:02] anyhow love covers up a multitude of sin
[49:05] you know perfect love cast out fear and
[49:08] sin all discard love does now this blind
[49:13] man was sitting there and Jesus and his
[49:15] disciples come by and I Think Jesus gave
[49:18] them a little lesson here when they seen
[49:20] this poor blind man they thought well
[49:22] now surely there's a sin behind that
[49:24] somewhere when we see something happen
[49:26] to a man we always say well he sin he
[49:30] got out of the will of the Lord
[49:31] somewhere brother CHR hit the post he
[49:34] got out of the will of the Lord
[49:35] somewhere in somebody's idea when the
[49:37] gun blowed up on me well is out of the
[49:40] will of the Lord Brother Neville hit the
[49:41] car is out of the will of the Lord
[49:43] that's not exactly right no sir it isn't
[49:47] God permits those things Jesus turned
[49:50] around and taught him a lesson they said
[49:52] his father must have sinned or or did
[49:55] his mother sin or did he sined Jesus
[49:57] said neither of them
[50:00] sin but that the works of God might be
[50:03] made manifest amen see God lets things
[50:06] happen just to for the works of God to
[50:08] be made
[50:09] manifest now and so he said told the man
[50:14] and give him his sight and he went his
[50:16] way and here come the Pharisees up when
[50:19] that was rumored around here was the man
[50:21] as blind satting now there begging and
[50:23] here he could see and that's rumored
[50:25] around among him and oh my that stirred
[50:28] up something and here they come up there
[50:30] and they see that the blind man could
[50:32] see and first they went wanted to find
[50:36] some way to put a fear upon all the
[50:39] people because they had already said if
[50:41] anybody goes after this new doctrine and
[50:44] this new Prophet called Jesus of
[50:47] Nazareth immediately they'll be handed
[50:49] their paper and fellowship from the
[50:50] church they cannot go to synagogue no
[50:53] longer if you associate with him 10 one
[50:55] of his meetings or anything you can't go
[50:56] no more so they wanted to make a big
[50:59] display out of it because they hated him
[51:02] they wasn't thinking of that poor blind
[51:04] man but they wanted to make a big
[51:07] display to make the people keep away
[51:09] from him they said they want to ask his
[51:11] father and mother so they went and got
[51:13] the father and mother they said is this
[51:15] your son he said yes sir was he born
[51:18] blind yes sir and uh what means does he
[51:22] see and the father and mother was afraid
[51:24] the Bible said because they know they'd
[51:26] be put out the synagogue if they
[51:28] admitted it it was and see there he was
[51:30] taken down they said now we know this is
[51:32] our son all probably a few thousand
[51:35] people stand there but if he could if
[51:37] them stinking Pharisees could only put a
[51:41] blight on his name right there had done
[51:43] something to scare the people they' run
[51:44] him out of there for that meeting see
[51:46] all of his influence have been lost so
[51:49] they said uh a bunch of them come up
[51:51] there at their Priestly garments on and
[51:54] they said uh speak for him they said we
[51:56] know this is our son we know he was born
[51:59] blind but now how he sees I don't know
[52:03] you ask him he's of
[52:05] age all right so they went over and got
[52:07] him said who give you your sight how do
[52:10] he heal him he said uh one called Jesus
[52:14] of Nazareth give me my sight and they
[52:17] said give praise to God said well we
[52:21] know this man's a sinner said uh and I
[52:25] said when is he said said I don't know
[52:27] you just come by and heal men that's all
[52:30] I know about I know one thing I do know
[52:33] I couldn't tell you about him being a
[52:35] sinner or not I don't know I've just met
[52:37] the man today but if if he could give me
[52:40] my my sight I know this one thing that
[52:43] where I was once blind I can now
[52:46] see I'm sure of that where I was blind a
[52:50] half hour AG go and now I got this good
[52:52] as sign as any of you fellas so I know I
[52:55] can see what a stinger that put on them
[52:58] so they thought well he said well I said
[53:00] you all want to be his disciples
[53:04] too that's good that's good solid
[53:08] testimony that that that's good that's
[53:11] good
[53:12] backgrounds that that that's really good
[53:14] witness in what I think said do you all
[53:17] here's a lay member a blind man standing
[53:19] on the street after meeting Jesus now
[53:22] asking the disciple asking the Pharisees
[53:24] if they want to be his disciples the
[53:26] Bishops head man you want to be his
[53:29] disciples also they said nay you're his
[53:33] disciple we're Moses disciple looking
[53:36] way back down through history you know
[53:38] we're Moses
[53:39] Disciple This Man we don't know nothing
[53:41] about him we don't know where he come
[53:43] from well we haven't got a rule of any
[53:45] of our schools he ever come up he never
[53:47] come and ask us about these things see
[53:50] we don't know nothing about it you
[53:51] people out there you realize that man's
[53:54] not
[53:54] ordained that man's a sus or something
[53:58] he's B you're being Bewitched why he
[54:02] doesn't have any Authority we haven't
[54:04] give it to him yet see we don't even
[54:06] know when this man comes from this old
[54:09] boy standing there could see said now
[54:11] this is a marvelous
[54:15] thing see he's about to get the people
[54:17] be down these Pharisees while make them
[54:19] afraid see but he had done T Sid with
[54:22] Jesus am so he said uh this is a
[54:25] marvelous thing
[54:26] let me break it down some of the words
[54:28] he might have said now you fellas around
[54:30] here has been running all the religious
[54:32] end of this for hundreds of
[54:35] years and uh you speak of a coming
[54:38] Messiah and something is going to take
[54:41] place just in the shadows of time when
[54:44] to deliver is coming to see us and you
[54:47] tell us that when he comes that that
[54:49] what all he's going to do and here you
[54:52] the spiritual leaders the high priest
[54:55] and priest
[54:57] of this community standing here together
[54:59] before these people trying to Blacken
[55:01] his name trying to say something evil
[55:04] against him and the man come and open my
[55:07] blinded
[55:08] eye I was born blind here's my father
[55:11] and mother giving witness that I was
[55:13] born blind been sitting right here among
[55:15] you for all these years born blind and
[55:18] that has never happened since the world
[55:19] began
[55:21] am and here a man can come and perform a
[55:25] miracle that hasn't been done since the
[55:27] world began and you the spiritual
[55:29] leaders and don't know nothing about it
[55:35] am and I say this is a marvelous
[55:39] thing he took sides with
[55:42] Jesus see he was permitted to be blind
[55:46] so the works of God could be manifested
[55:49] see because he come on the side of the
[55:52] Lord Jesus he took sides with him now he
[55:56] put Stinger to him you know what they
[55:57] did they said now we know you were born
[55:59] in sin try to teach us and shoved him
[56:01] out of the church knocked him out pushed
[56:04] him out throw him out but as soon as he
[56:07] was sowed out did you notice Jesus found
[56:10] him
[56:12] again amen Lord Jesus found him again so
[56:18] don't worry if they throw you out he'll
[56:21] find you again am all right and he said
[56:25] to him does thou believe on the Son of
[56:27] God he said Lord who is he he didn't
[56:31] even know but the only thing that he
[56:32] know that where he was blind he could
[56:34] then see I know this one thing brother
[56:38] they might call this fanaticism and
[56:39] whatever they want to but wh in I once
[56:41] the
[56:42] sinner I'll come into Grace now
[56:45] something has happened to me see this
[56:47] one thing I I now know by trusting his
[56:50] word by believing him I've been kicked
[56:53] out of every organization under the face
[56:55] of heavens there's none of them that
[56:57] will receive me anymore you know that
[56:59] some of their man will out here good man
[57:01] will accept but every organization is
[57:03] thumbs down on me that's right but he's
[57:05] found me you'll find me somewhere that's
[57:06] right that's right come along like that
[57:09] and um so it'll be all right because we
[57:12] want to take sides with Jesus and the
[57:13] only way you take sides with Jesus is
[57:15] taking sides on what he said believe in
[57:18] his word so let's take sides with him
[57:20] the blind man gave him a real testimony
[57:23] all right we find again that they tried
[57:25] to block his name just for a little bit
[57:28] and um I've got to skip over some things
[57:30] here so um one time is a Pharisee I
[57:35] preached on it here some time ago and
[57:37] called it washing Jesus feet I believe
[57:40] you all heard me preach on that here
[57:42] when a Pharisee asked Jesus to come down
[57:45] to his house a big old stiff starched
[57:48] Pharisee and asked him to come and you I
[57:51] gave it a little drama how The Courier
[57:53] come and found him and he come on down
[57:56] yet he know he was hated yet he went
[57:59] anyhow and when they got him in there
[58:01] they never washed his feet let him sit
[58:02] down there stinking and everything else
[58:04] from the T of the road and there he sat
[58:06] there and a little woman come in they
[58:08] thought oh my the Lord is good to us
[58:11] because look this just brings our big
[58:13] party they brought him there just to
[58:15] make fun out of him they brought him
[58:17] there just to have some fun from him and
[58:19] now they thought the Lord was working
[58:21] right with them because that this ill
[58:24] Fame prostitute woman woman come over
[58:27] and was crying and washing his feet with
[58:30] their tears and wiping them with his
[58:31] hair and old Pharisee and all the rest
[58:33] of the priest stand on the corner that
[58:35] brother everything the Lord set it up
[58:37] just exactly for us here we can put a
[58:39] smear on his name right now he calls
[58:41] himself a prophet and the people thinks
[58:44] that he's a prophet and they call him
[58:46] the Galilean prophet and he even claims
[58:49] to be the Messiah and we know Messiah
[58:51] will be a prophet and here he is sitting
[58:53] back there you see where we brought him
[58:55] look at there boy we got him fixed right
[58:57] now there he is sitting back there
[58:59] stooped down like a whipped out puppy or
[59:01] something back there and some prostitute
[59:04] of his own class would come around and
[59:06] wash his feet like that and now he don't
[59:09] even know if he's a prophet he' know
[59:11] what kind of a woman that was now boys
[59:14] we'll drink on this one said because
[59:16] look there see anything to blot his name
[59:20] anything to ruin the confidence of the
[59:22] people not knowing that they were
[59:24] possessed of the de devil to do
[59:27] [Applause]
[59:30] that they were working in harmony with
[59:32] the devil trying to blacken the name of
[59:36] the son of God how did they do this
[59:38] Brethren because they never searched the
[59:40] scriptures amen Jesus said search you
[59:42] the scriptures in them you think you
[59:44] have eternal life and they are they that
[59:46] testify of
[59:48] Me Oh What A Ministry he had see yes sir
[59:53] if I do not the works of my father then
[59:54] don't believe me see but the Pharisees
[59:57] said we got him now oh look here there's
[1:00:00] probably 1500 people here this Feast now
[1:00:03] look at him sitting over there there he
[1:00:05] sits with a prostitute and oh my what a
[1:00:08] horrible thing that was in that day and
[1:00:11] there he was with an ill-fame woman
[1:00:13] slipped in like look like he slipped in
[1:00:16] he got by the foot wash flunky and
[1:00:17] everything else and S there and said
[1:00:19] here she was over there washing his feet
[1:00:22] now if he was a prophet you see Breen
[1:00:26] that man's no
[1:00:27] Prophet if he was a prophet then he'd
[1:00:30] know what manner of woman that was
[1:00:31] washing his
[1:00:33] feet and Jesus just sat and watched her
[1:00:36] never moved a foot till she got on if
[1:00:39] you're going to do something for Jesus
[1:00:40] Jesus said and watch you do it sometime
[1:00:43] he let you go ahead till you get
[1:00:44] finished then the reward comes maybe you
[1:00:46] run the whole race of Life working for
[1:00:49] him but don't worry there's a reward at
[1:00:51] the end if you just take your way with
[1:00:53] his side you might not know see one
[1:00:55] person heal let you pray for just keep
[1:00:57] on praying for him I've often said if I
[1:00:59] prayed for 500 tonight all 500 dead in
[1:01:02] the morning tomorrow night I'll be
[1:01:03] preaching Divine Healing and praying for
[1:01:05] the sick am don't have one thing to do
[1:01:07] with it see he'll let you come right
[1:01:09] down through defeats and everything else
[1:01:11] till he come right down to the end of
[1:01:12] the road and finish your work like he
[1:01:15] led that woman she wanted to do him a
[1:01:16] service so he just held his feet out
[1:01:18] there and let let her wash him or if he
[1:01:21] said don't do that she have jumped and
[1:01:22] run but he let her do the service and
[1:01:25] after she got through finished the
[1:01:28] service that she was going to do then he
[1:01:31] looked up to that hypocrite standing
[1:01:34] back there was trying to cast the
[1:01:35] Blackness on his name amen said Simon
[1:01:39] I've got something to say to
[1:01:41] you not to her but to
[1:01:45] you you standing back there in your
[1:01:48] heart that's the reason you brought me
[1:01:49] down here you had no fellowship with me
[1:01:53] didn't I know it but you brought me down
[1:01:56] here and you set me back here to make
[1:01:58] fun of me let you never give me no water
[1:02:00] to wash my feet you never give me
[1:02:02] nothing to sooth me me sitting here

[1:02:23] them with the very tears of her eyes
[1:02:26] wiped him with the towel of her own
[1:02:29] hair then I'll just show you where I'm a
[1:02:31] prophet or

[1:02:50] it they thought they' stopped it they
[1:02:54] thought they'd fixed him so his Revival
[1:02:55] could never be in that Community they
[1:02:57] thought they ruined his
[1:03:00] influence but just taken one person that
[1:03:03] loved him to turn the whole
[1:03:07] situation how do you know that you're
[1:03:09] not that person for your
[1:03:12] community or somebody that you'll meet

[1:03:21] what I mean Brethren take your side with
[1:03:23] Jesus
[1:03:25] take it make him your choice do service
[1:03:29] for him regardless of whether anybody
[1:03:31] else or you're ever repaid or anything
[1:03:32] don't make any difference wait till the
[1:03:34] work's
[1:03:35] over how would you like for him to say
[1:03:38] even though you had prayed for sick and
[1:03:39] they didn't get well though you prayed
[1:03:41] to get to speak with tongues you didn't
[1:03:42] do it you prayed to prophesy you didn't
[1:03:44] do it but yet the only thing you do is
[1:03:46] tell the story of Jesus in your church
[1:03:49] or in your community at your work you
[1:03:51] couldn't even do one thing didn't lead
[1:03:53] one person that woman didn't lead one to
[1:03:55] Christ
[1:03:56] but she done a service for himen what
[1:03:59] difference does it make at the end of
[1:04:01] the road if he'll say and I say unto you
[1:04:03] all your sins oh there not one prayer
[1:04:06] was answered for you but you come on the
[1:04:09] basis of my word you come because you
[1:04:12] believe me and you did me a service and
[1:04:15] I say that the many sins that you have
[1:04:17] done is all forgiven you that would be
[1:04:19] good enough for me amen yes sir all
[1:04:22] right they want to say the days of
[1:04:24] Miracles are pass and and so forth let
[1:04:26] him go ahead and say it but let us do
[1:04:28] the service for the Lord they hated him
[1:04:32] because they were jealous of him that's
[1:04:34] the only reason they were
[1:04:35] jealous they were trying to destroy his
[1:04:39] influence before the people the same as
[1:04:41] they're doing now they they can just in
[1:04:44] destroy the influence of the message
[1:04:48] before the people then they've got the
[1:04:50] thing whipped that's right amen because
[1:04:53] why did they try to do it because he was
[1:04:56] against all their Creeds and all their
[1:04:59] Church doctrines and everything that
[1:05:01] they believed in and called all their
[1:05:03] all their fats and so forth he was
[1:05:06] against it all and they hated him
[1:05:08] because he didn't barge in with them

[1:05:51] Marvelous race of people oh you all keep
[1:05:54] the traditions of the father is just
[1:05:56] exactly right you know you could be the
[1:06:00] Messiah no he wouldn't have been amen

[1:06:05] wasn't amen when you see somebody come
[1:06:08] say come here and I'll show you what
[1:06:09] I'll do and come here I'll do this and
[1:06:11] do that you remember right now there's
[1:06:13] something Shady about it to start with
[1:06:16] Jesus said I'll do nothing till the
[1:06:17] father shows me
[1:06:19] first yes he was against them he taught
[1:06:22] against them he condemned their Sabbath
[1:06:25] keeping he condemned the way they
[1:06:27] dressed he condemned all the ways of
[1:06:30] their life all their Traditions all
[1:06:33] their pot washing and K washing and hand
[1:06:36] washing and everything else he condemned
[1:06:38] it every bit you know dressings he said
[1:06:41] you wear broad garments and desire the
[1:06:44] high seats and and make long prayers and
[1:06:47] the with Dev our winess home said you
[1:06:49] receive more
[1:06:50] damnation well remember I'm Dr so I
[1:06:53] don't care who you are
[1:06:55] oh man he really put on they did why
[1:06:59] because they didn't believe him he was
[1:07:01] the word see he was trying to break up
[1:07:05] that legalistic Bunch am and if he's
[1:07:08] here on Earth today he try to do the
[1:07:10] same thing amen some people say well now
[1:07:12] wait a minute we keep the Sabbath ever
[1:07:14] we do this and uh you know we keep all
[1:07:17] this and we keep that and ever why ever
[1:07:19] Good Friday while when fast time comes
[1:07:21] on 40 days before Easter we always
[1:07:24] observe lent I give up smoking for 40
[1:07:26] days I give up drinking for 40 days
[1:07:29] before during time of Lent oh tradition
[1:07:32] of the fathers legalist if you love God
[1:07:35] you you don't smoke in the first place
[1:07:39] if you love God you I I wrote in the
[1:07:41] back of my little bible first one I ever
[1:07:43] had I said don't ask me foolish
[1:07:45] questions make this up in your mind if
[1:07:48] you love the Lord with all your heart
[1:07:49] you don't smoke drink or or don't smoke
[1:07:51] Che or drink any shine and that still
[1:07:53] stands good today amen I don't do it
[1:07:56] because I think he condemns me for doing
[1:07:57] it I would quit it because it's a dirty
[1:08:01] thing and isn't becoming to a minister
[1:08:03] am that's
[1:08:06] right I wouldn't say many times I go to
[1:08:09] houses there are women standing out
[1:08:11] there and I go to the house knock on the
[1:08:13] door and a sister come to the door just
[1:08:15] come in brother Brandon if her husband's
[1:08:17] not there unless it's the case of
[1:08:19] sickness and somebody with me I don't go
[1:08:22] and then call me to a hospital or to a
[1:08:25] room say brother B come over here I'm
[1:08:27] sister so and so from so and so I'm here
[1:08:29] at the hotel I I I brought my mother
[1:08:32] along she's
[1:08:33] sick I take my wife if I don't I take
[1:08:37] some other brother see I I don't I don't
[1:08:39] think I think it'd be all right for me
[1:08:41] to go in there but why does somebody see
[1:08:43] me go in there
[1:08:45] see why does somebody see me do it
[1:08:49] see then the first thing you know they'
[1:08:52] say he went in there where that woman
[1:08:54] was he's chasing that after women that
[1:08:56] see that would be a thing I shouldn't do
[1:08:59] see you shouldn't never do anything like
[1:09:01] that cuz you put a stumbling in somebody
[1:09:03] else's way see I don't believe that I
[1:09:05] would do anything wrong in there it
[1:09:07] would I wouldn't trust God to go in
[1:09:09] there no matter what the thing was I'd
[1:09:11] trust God but yet you see and and and I
[1:09:15] love the Lord well enough till I
[1:09:18] wouldn't do it see it's a love you have
[1:09:21] you you not do it because it's a duty to
[1:09:23] do it you do it because you love love
[1:09:25] the Lord you don't have to do it but you
[1:09:27] do it
[1:09:29] anyhow Paul said to me all things are
[1:09:31] lawful but not all or expedient see Paul
[1:09:35] could do lots of things that maybe that
[1:09:37] he know the Lord understood him and
[1:09:40] trusted him but it wasn't expedient for
[1:09:42] him to do it so that's the way these
[1:09:44] legalists trying to say 40 days before
[1:09:47] Easter we always starting to fast and
[1:09:50] they eat just as much as they ever do
[1:09:52] maybe they say well I don't like beans
[1:09:54] so I'll give up beans for lint I've
[1:09:56] heard him say that I don't like pork so
[1:09:59] I'll just give up pork you know I'm
[1:10:01] going to quit drinking for lint one
[1:10:03] woman told me said you know what I give
[1:10:05] up for lint this year brother R I said
[1:10:06] no I said candy said I I never did care
[1:10:10] too much for it anyhow see there you are
[1:10:13] now they call that fasting see
[1:10:16] legalism they say well I got a you know
[1:10:20] I I I stagger at church a long time
[1:10:22] because I tell you I kept Sunday school
[1:10:24] for a full year but because my teacher
[1:10:26] said if they give a Bible to the one
[1:10:28] that didn't miss a day oh brother that's
[1:10:31] some way of going i' let's go by me a
[1:10:33] Bible see if you don't go to church
[1:10:36] because you love the Lord you might as
[1:10:38] well stay away that's all see because
[1:10:41] you go therefore you love
[1:10:44] God I think of this song We Sing blessed
[1:10:47] be the ti that binds our hearts in
[1:10:48] Christian love Fellowship of Kinder mind

[1:10:57] hope to meet again see that's it when we
[1:11:00] are part it gives us inward pain I've
[1:11:04] seen the time brother let me not condemn
[1:11:07] us but let me just wake us up to
[1:11:09] something I've seen the time and this
[1:11:12] church that when people had to wait
[1:11:16] until Wednesday night to meet one
[1:11:17] another they would cry
[1:11:20] over that's right I seen ministers come
[1:11:24] in here and would say how do you do it
[1:11:29] well then people just one heart see they
[1:11:33] meet the door and say and sisters meet
[1:11:35] one another back there and hug each
[1:11:37] other and saying sister be sure to pray

[1:11:46] making like that and Tears In Her Eyes
[1:11:49] see the brothers Shake one of's hands
[1:11:50] and it's could hard to get away from
[1:11:52] each other like that that's real
[1:11:53] Christian Fellowship see
[1:11:56] just waiting praying for each other yes
[1:11:58] sir that's the way we should be all
[1:12:01] right now these men that made these
[1:12:04] statements they wasn't bad man they
[1:12:07] didn't mean to be
[1:12:09] evil they thought they were doing a
[1:12:11] service for God them Pharisees and
[1:12:14] things they wasn't bootleggers and
[1:12:16] drunkards they were religious man it
[1:12:19] wasn't bad they just they just did not
[1:12:23] accept the word of the truth they did
[1:12:27] not accept the spirit what they held to
[1:12:30] their Creeds and their their leaders
[1:12:35] Traditions see it showed that they love
[1:12:38] their leaders here's Big cus is the high
[1:12:40] priest there's the rest of those big
[1:12:42] priests and those men go along now you
[1:12:44] take like Catholic they not throwing off
[1:12:46] to
[1:12:47] them same thing in Protestants you take
[1:12:50] a Catholic he loves his
[1:12:52] priest and uh and I tell him about the
[1:12:55] word of the Lord and and he sees the
[1:12:57] works of God he say but my my church
[1:12:59] don't believe that and you go talking to
[1:13:02] pin man say a woman said to me today
[1:13:04] said it's a sin for me to listen to you
[1:13:07] see she didn't want to be bad she just
[1:13:10] thought so much of her church and her
[1:13:12] priest so if she listen to anything else
[1:13:14] she was loyal to that
[1:13:17] priest Jehovah Witness is loyal to what
[1:13:21] they believe the Baptist is loyal to
[1:13:24] what they they
[1:13:26] believe the Presbyterian is loyal to
[1:13:29] what they
[1:13:30] believe and there this is loyal to their
[1:13:33] pastors can't we be that loyal to the
[1:13:36] word see now if those I want to ask you
[1:13:40] something you say well brother BR how
[1:13:41] you know they're not now if those
[1:13:45] Pharisees and Sadducees and leaders of
[1:13:48] that day would have got away from their
[1:13:51] Creeds and their dogmas and listen to
[1:13:55] what the word said and what Jesus Is
[1:13:57] Telling just exactly what Messiah was
[1:13:59] supposed to do they would have held on
[1:14:01] to him amen see but they thought so much
[1:14:04] of their leaders they wasn't bad man
[1:14:06] they wouldn't steal lie cuss anything
[1:14:09] like that they wouldn't do that they
[1:14:11] wouldn't commit adultery why certainly
[1:14:13] not why they would witness the stoning
[1:14:16] of one that had did such a thing and
[1:14:18] they wouldn't they wouldn't do that they
[1:14:20] were good man but the only thing that
[1:14:22] was they wasn't spiritual man
[1:14:25] amen morally they were fine but that
[1:14:29] isn't what counts and what did Jesus
[1:14:32] tell them even them loyal people he said
[1:14:34] you are of your father the
[1:14:38] devil see it's a word that counts now
[1:14:42] I'll hurry just quick as possible H they
[1:14:44] wasn't spirit filled but they were loyal
[1:14:47] and held to the modern Creed of their
[1:14:50] leaders see all right his ministry was
[1:14:54] short showing up their Doctrine that's
[1:14:57] what the matter now look I just take it
[1:15:00] I just Brethren I I I'm I'm going to ask
[1:15:02] you forgive me right now for being this
[1:15:04] long um uh maybe you won't want me to
[1:15:06] come back or another one but look listen
[1:15:09] to this see I want you to be sure to get
[1:15:12] this now they had their Creeds and they
[1:15:15] were great churches and great people and
[1:15:17] great man holy man good man gentle man
[1:15:21] fine man honorable man man of Honor
[1:15:25] educated smart religious is that right
[1:15:30] now we all know that just as good as you
[1:15:33] can find
[1:15:34] anywhere see but when Jesus come
[1:15:38] on his
[1:15:41] ministry showed up their
[1:15:45] Doctrine cuse God was proving by the
[1:15:48] ministry of Jesus Christ that he was
[1:15:50] with him amen didn't Peter quote the
[1:15:52] same thing he said you men of Israel
[1:15:55] let this be known unto you and Heen to
[1:15:57] my words and said Jesus of Nazareth a
[1:16:00] man approved of God among you amen see
[1:16:05] see if they like this blind man said
[1:16:08] isn't this a marvelous thing you're the
[1:16:10] spiritual leaders of the nation and here
[1:16:13] comes a man in and opens My Eyes by the
[1:16:15] power of God and yet you don't know
[1:16:18] nothing about it amen he said this is a
[1:16:22] marvelous thing he had something didn't
[1:16:25] he yeah sure did all right he did a man
[1:16:28] that could do this and yet they didn't
[1:16:30] know whence he
[1:16:31] was now that was a marvelous thing now
[1:16:34] look at today Brethren see we have a we
[1:16:38] know we have a mve of God we know it's
[1:16:42] performing Miracles it's Healing The
[1:16:45] Sick it's even raising the dead it's
[1:16:48] casting out Devils it speaks with
[1:16:51] tongues it interprets tongues it sends
[1:16:54] forth prophecies
[1:16:55] they happen
[1:16:57] amen he's showns dreams interpretations
[1:17:01] perfect
[1:17:03] strictly then isn't it a strange thing
[1:17:06] that great leaders would say was a bunch
[1:17:08] of crazy people when they're the leaders
[1:17:10] of the nation the leaders of churches
[1:17:13] that's a marvelous thing what is it it's
[1:17:15] still
[1:17:16] jealousy the spirit and power and word
[1:17:20] of God in these last days is showing up
[1:17:22] their dogmas and Creeds that's all is
[1:17:25] that they got man blinded by them so my
[1:17:28] young Brethren you all that's going out
[1:17:30] here in these churches hold to God's
[1:17:32] word don't you move if you can't make it
[1:17:35] come to pass don't stand in nobody
[1:17:37] else's way stand there beating at the
[1:17:38] door just parting right to it that's
[1:17:41] right stay right there don't start
[1:17:43] fanaticism because it'll show you up but
[1:17:46] if you'll stay true and holy and with
[1:17:48] that word God will vindicate you that's
[1:17:51] right his ministry was showing up their
[1:17:53] doctrines and dogmas so they took every
[1:17:56] chance to get rid of him they could find
[1:17:59] everything that they could find to get
[1:18:00] rid of him they did it trying to say
[1:18:03] when I look here look at here so and so
[1:18:06] this one there he said one day in the
[1:18:08] house of Simon the
[1:18:10] leper not one word said he heal
[1:18:13] him he a
[1:18:16] leopard nothing says he heal him that's
[1:18:19] right he passed by the pool of Bethesda
[1:18:23] and there laid about 2,000 people people
[1:18:25] lame blind Hal
[1:18:26] withered and he walked over the one man
[1:18:28] and healed him and walked away say well
[1:18:30] now if he was Messiah he' healed all of
[1:18:33] them if he is full of compassion as you
[1:18:35] all say is he' had mercy on all of them
[1:18:39] everything that they could find to throw
[1:18:40] a black mark on him they did it
[1:18:43] everything they could find they throw it
[1:18:45] on him all
[1:18:47] right they took every chance they could
[1:18:50] to rid get rid of him question his birth
[1:18:54] his birth wasn't questioned they put
[1:18:56] that before the people they couldn't
[1:18:59] understand how he was born to Virg birth
[1:19:01] and Joseph his father supposed to be a
[1:19:03] Cartner and he's born before Joseph Mary
[1:19:05] was married they throw that before the
[1:19:07] people yes sir see what am I saying now
[1:19:10] they're black marketing see look at him
[1:19:13] where did he come from look at his
[1:19:16] mother no more than a street
[1:19:19] prostitute had this baby and after the
[1:19:22] baby was
[1:19:23] born she's already pregnant the baby is
[1:19:27] to be born then Joseph mared to hide
[1:19:29] then come around with some kind watch
[1:19:31] the work of the devil can't you see it's
[1:19:32] that kind of a birth they filled that
[1:19:34] before the people and not reading in the
[1:19:36] Bible Isaiah 9 and6 a virgin shall
[1:19:39] conceive see what was it they got away
[1:19:41] from the word amen that's it they throw
[1:19:44] black figures at his authority gentlemen
[1:19:48] don't you know we're Moses disciples
[1:19:50] don't you know we're Servants of Christ
[1:19:53] don't you know we search the scriptures
[1:19:54] daily and we have not one thing they
[1:19:58] said the Messiah would come to his
[1:20:00] Temple not one word of him coming to a
[1:20:02] temple where is he at what school did he
[1:20:05] come from ask any of the Brethren both
[1:20:07] Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian
[1:20:09] you know Pharisees Sadducees and so
[1:20:11] forth what Fellowship card does he pack
[1:20:14] where's his authority even to preach he
[1:20:16] hasn't been ordained he hasn't even got
[1:20:17] a right to preach he said my ordination
[1:20:20] comes from God my Works vindicate what I
[1:20:23] am that's right I don't have to have
[1:20:25] your papers see what I mean they throw
[1:20:28] that his Doctrine why they called him be
[1:20:31] elub his Doctrine they couldn't
[1:20:33] understand why he disagrees with all of
[1:20:36] the traditions of the fathers he even
[1:20:39] disagrees with the Pharisees he
[1:20:40] disagrees with the Sadducees he
[1:20:42] disagrees with a whole group of them
[1:20:44] amen now where does he get his
[1:20:47] Doctrine the Bible of course well you
[1:20:51] say well how do I know that that's right
[1:20:54] God backed it
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:57] up that's what the blind man said it's a
[1:21:00] strange thing if you're so right and
[1:21:02] he's so wrong yet he can take the power
[1:21:04] of God and open my eyes and you never
[1:21:05] have seen it done yet
[1:21:08] even that's a strange thing oh my I like
[1:21:12] to take sides with him don't

[1:25:47] and that way to make any differ
[1:25:48] somewhere it's going to strike a
[1:25:50] seed when it did it'll B to life like
[1:25:53] that this is sure as the world yes sir
[1:25:56] like that blind boy said this was done
[1:25:58] that the works of God might be made
[1:26:00] manifest he know what was going to take
[1:26:02] place sure it did all right now the
[1:26:06] predestinated when they seen his
[1:26:09] scriptural signs know that the word
[1:26:12] Vindicated the works or The Works
[1:26:14] Vindicated the word that the word was
[1:26:17] right they were predestinated to see it
[1:26:20] and they were right in line to see it
[1:26:22] and they got it then they said
[1:26:25] after they seen they couldn't get
[1:26:26] nowhere because the people is
[1:26:27] predestinated to eternal life they just
[1:26:30] going to find it that's all all the
[1:26:32] father's given me will come to me and
[1:26:35] all that comes to me I'll give eternal
[1:26:36] life and raise him up to the last day
[1:26:38] there will not be one of them lost amen
[1:26:41] I'm holding right to that not by works
[1:26:45] not by Deeds not by power not by might
[1:26:47] by my spirit sayth God not what I done
[1:26:50] what I am or what I will be but what he
[1:26:52] is and I am in him and whatever he is
[1:26:54] I'm part of him amen I'm saved because
[1:26:57] I'm part of him and he's he is God and
[1:27:00] I'm part of him being his son am that's
[1:27:02] right so it ain't what I done what I
[1:27:04] will do is what he has done that's my
[1:27:07] trust right there all right so they
[1:27:10] seemen they couldn't get nowhere I'll
[1:27:12] skip a few of these scriptures here They
[1:27:15] Se they couldn't get anywhere with him
[1:27:17] so you know the next thing they had to
[1:27:18] do to try to get him off the field they
[1:27:21] went and said to his Brethren and his
[1:27:23] mother you know he's awfully
[1:27:25] tired you should take him off to one

[1:27:37] to get rid of him it wasn't they thought
[1:27:39] he was so tired they'd like for him to
[1:27:40] work himself to death but every time he
[1:27:43] went out the miracle started pouring the
[1:27:45] word of God went forth I would not like
[1:27:47] to hear him stand up there that day on

[1:32:31] same there's many a man out there with
[1:32:33] medicine and surgery and stuff that
[1:32:34] denies God and everything else but
[1:32:36] there's a man one that believes him

[1:35:51] her and looked at her and there her
[1:35:54] husband stood there and said Billy
[1:35:55] here's what it was said I'm Catholic I
[1:35:57] want you to say a prayer for her because
[1:35:59] she's going to purgatory and I said what

[1:36:25] distress people I've heard him say I
[1:36:27] don't believe in God let him hurt
[1:36:29] himself right bad once see the first one
[1:36:31] he'll call on even his disciples one
[1:36:34] time when they were in a
[1:36:37] storm though when they saw him they were
[1:36:39] a little bit afraid of him they didn't
[1:36:42] know this exactly what it was they said
[1:36:45] it's a spirit and they cried
[1:36:47] out but yet all hopes for being saved
[1:36:50] was gone so they invited him in amen
[1:36:53] yeah they're always where you're a
[1:36:55] little suspicious or
[1:36:56] not when all hopes is gone you like to
[1:36:59] invite him in amen yeah they took him in
[1:37:03] because they had a need of him that's
[1:37:05] right you know I've often
[1:37:10] wondered sometime maybe that's why the
[1:37:12] storms come on did you ever think of
[1:37:15] that he set up there and watched them
[1:37:17] till they had need of him and then he
[1:37:18] come on the
[1:37:20] scene so we can see we are need of him
[1:37:25] now we see that the storm is coming
[1:37:28] brother let's take sides with him
[1:37:31] tonight take sides with his word I I I
[1:37:34] quit here um let's take sides with him
[1:37:39] let's us you and I Brethren jar up with
[1:37:41] him tonight the storms are coming and
[1:37:45] don't wait till the little board
[1:37:47] sunk let's take him into our little B
[1:37:50] now you might look off and say I can't
[1:37:53] understand all these things brother
[1:37:54] brandom see if we say anything but
[1:37:57] what's in the word see if there's
[1:37:59] anything there but what he promised to
[1:38:01] do it might look a little spooky to you
[1:38:04] sometime you think oh my I can't
[1:38:07] understand that but there'll be a day
[1:38:09] when this life of yours is leaving it it
[1:38:12] won't look so bad to you then when you
[1:38:14] know yourself you got to turn back to
[1:38:16] the god that created you you'll want to
[1:38:18] take him in then let's take him in now
[1:38:21] before the storm gets any worse than
[1:38:22] what it is I want him to into my heart I
[1:38:26] want him so much in my life to my whole
[1:38:27] being is saturated that my mind my
[1:38:30] thoughts my everything that I am is
[1:38:32] governed and controlled by Christ Jesus
[1:38:35] I want to be so lost to to myself that
[1:38:38] all I'll know and see is Jesus Christ
[1:38:41] and I want to come before you all if the
[1:38:44] god of Heaven permits you to have these
[1:38:45] things that I've talked about when I
[1:38:47] come among you I want to know Christ him
[1:38:49] crucified I I want to know the glory and
[1:38:52] precious Praises of of God sit down
[1:38:54] among you and hear one Minister get up
[1:38:56] and give the praise to God the what he
[1:38:58] had seen done in his church and another
[1:39:00] and what he saw done in his church
[1:39:01] nothing what he saw done in his church
[1:39:03] that's exactly what they did and when
[1:39:05] they come together and met in Fellowship
[1:39:07] in Acts 4 they was given account what
[1:39:10] God had did over here and what God had
[1:39:11] did over here and Peter and John had
[1:39:13] been whipped and and and made a promise
[1:39:16] that they' what they' do to him if they
[1:39:17] preach anymore in jesus' name and they
[1:39:19] gathered with their people and they all
[1:39:21] prayed with one Accord and prayed in the
[1:39:23] will of God and quoted the scripture why
[1:39:25] did the heathens rage and the people
[1:39:27] imagine a vain thing and when they
[1:39:29] prayed the Holy Ghost shook the place
[1:39:31] where they were assembled together
[1:39:33] that's the kind of a meeting we need
[1:39:35] that's what we got to have Brethren
[1:39:36] let's be fortified by the word of God by
[1:39:39] the spirit of God by the power of God
[1:39:42] and let our lights so shine now that
[1:39:45] we'll be like Stevens he stood there one
[1:39:47] man alone before that Stan hadran
[1:39:50] Council of a half a million man may be
[1:39:52] standing there every one of them
[1:39:54] pointing their finger of acquisation in
[1:39:56] his face when that little fell walked
[1:39:57] out there said he's shine like an angel
[1:40:00] I don't mean maybe a light on his face
[1:40:02] like that an angel don't have to have a
[1:40:04] light on him but an angel is a man or an
[1:40:07] angel is a messenger and a messenger who
[1:40:10] knows what he's talking about walked out
[1:40:13] there and said man and Brethren and
[1:40:14] fathers our fathers in mapon how they
[1:40:17] was brought out in Abraham and so forth
[1:40:19] and oned and so and so and then he got
[1:40:20] down to the farling point he said oh you
[1:40:22] stiff neck uncircumcised the heart and
[1:40:24] ears why do you always resist the Holy
[1:40:26] Ghost like your fathers did so do you he
[1:40:28] knowed exactly what he was standing at
[1:40:31] that's the reason he was Shin he wasn't
[1:40:32] a bit afraid he know in whom he had
[1:40:35] believed even when death knocked at the
[1:40:37] door of St Paul's heart and he said I
[1:40:40] know in whom I have believed and I'm
[1:40:41] persuaded he's able to keep that which
[1:40:43] I've committed to him against the day
[1:40:45] amen the Lord bless you Brethren I'm
[1:40:47] sorry I kept you here till 25 minutes
[1:40:50] until 11: I know this is uncustomary for
[1:40:52] you I'm sorry to do it but you've been
[1:40:55] real nice tonight none of you has left
[1:40:57] you set and give your undited attention
[1:40:59] and I trust and hope that in my little
[1:41:01] broke up nervous talk that God the Holy
[1:41:03] Ghost has somewhere has poured out a
[1:41:06] little seed into your heart that the
[1:41:09] power of God will strike and bring it to
[1:41:11] life just like the woman at the well and
[1:41:13] others who are predestinated to eternal
[1:41:14] life God bless
[1:41:20] you that bless you tonight
[1:41:24] I mean I could go through here and point
[1:41:27] out so many wonderful
[1:41:31] things that he said you know I like this
[1:41:35] what he said so the people tried them
[1:41:37] Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites
[1:41:41] and herodians they all tried to cast a
[1:41:44] shadow on Jesus but them True Believers
[1:41:48] that was predestinated to hear that
[1:41:51] message heard it and seeing no fault in
[1:41:56] it at all do you wonder why you can not
[1:42:00] see a fault in it you know to you it's
[1:42:03] life amen amen aren't you thankful for
[1:42:06] that he said they were predestinated to
[1:42:09] eternal life so they just took sides
[1:42:13] with Jesus and stayed there then he said
[1:42:16] and you and you must teach your people
[1:42:21] you pastors to do the
[1:42:24] same Amen in another place he said that
[1:42:28] they couldn't see it but the blind could
[1:42:31] I thought this was a great thing here
[1:42:35] that he said he said but as as soon as
[1:42:38] he was throwed out did you notice Jesus
[1:42:42] found him
[1:42:44] again Jesus found him again so don't
[1:42:47] worry if they throw you out you he will
[1:42:51] find you again thought of so many
[1:42:54] Believers that go through times where
[1:42:57] they might lose their job they might
[1:42:59] lose work uh maybe something falls
[1:43:02] through on them and I I just thought how
[1:43:05] beautiful he is he said and he comes
[1:43:08] down here and he says I've been kicked
[1:43:11] out of every
[1:43:12] organization under the face of
[1:43:17] Heaven there's none of them that will
[1:43:21] receive me and anymore you know that
[1:43:25] that's what brother Ram did for a living
[1:43:28] He preached the gospel yeah okay all the
[1:43:31] doors were shut on him he never threw
[1:43:34] his hand up and said what am I going to
[1:43:36] do he just simply said this he says he
[1:43:40] says some of their men well out here
[1:43:44] good men will accept but every
[1:43:47] organization is thumbs down on me that's
[1:43:50] right but he has found me
[1:43:53] he will find me
[1:43:56] somewhere that's right see that's right
[1:44:00] come come along like that he promised he
[1:44:05] would never see the rightous beg
[1:44:08] bread you know and and I I I I just
[1:44:12] thought that was such words of comfort
[1:44:15] because we sit back and and uh we
[1:44:20] uh just you know there's so much times
[1:44:23] of wondering that's going on I thought
[1:44:27] this was really
[1:44:30] spectacular you see that that's it we a
[1:44:35] Sunder part it gives us inward pain I've
[1:44:39] seen the time
[1:44:41] brother let me not condemn
[1:44:48] us but let me just wake us up
[1:44:53] to
[1:44:56] something let me don't condemn you but
[1:44:59] let me wake us up to
[1:45:06] something
[1:45:09] prophecy you think God sent a
[1:45:11] messenger because he needed us to wake
[1:45:14] us up to something you can that's
[1:45:18] paragraph 206 if you want to put it up
[1:45:22] on the screen paragraph 206 I just want
[1:45:25] to take this let me not condemn us but
[1:45:30] let me just wake us up to something I've
[1:45:34] seen the time in this
[1:45:37] church that when people had to wait
[1:45:40] until Wednesday night to meet one
[1:45:43] another they would cry over
[1:45:51] it and that's right
[1:45:53] right I've seen ministers come in here
[1:45:57] and would say
[1:46:00] how do you do it well then people just
[1:46:05] one heart see they meet at the door and
[1:46:09] say them sisters meet one another back
[1:46:12] there and hug each other and say sister
[1:46:16] be sure to pray for me now honey I'll
[1:46:19] see you again Wednesday night I'll pray
[1:46:23] won't you pray for me I'll be praying
[1:46:26] for you and make it like that and
[1:46:31] Tears in their
[1:46:35] eyes see the brothers Shake one
[1:46:38] another's hands and just could go hard
[1:46:42] to get away from each other like that
[1:46:45] that's
[1:46:47] real Christian Fellowship see see just
[1:46:52] just wait pray for each other yes sir
[1:46:57] that's the way we should be all
[1:47:01] right a
[1:47:05] germ took that out of the
[1:47:07] church people sit home for
[1:47:12] months they they're lacking
[1:47:15] that they don't call and say oh brother
[1:47:19] I've missed you or I I'm sick I won't be
[1:47:22] there there well I just want you to
[1:47:26] know prophet's not condemning you but he
[1:47:30] is trying to wake you up to something I
[1:47:34] think this message was a
[1:47:36] tremendous wakeup
[1:47:38] call of the things that's going how
[1:47:42] they're trying to throw off how
[1:47:45] everything that it is going you know uh
[1:47:50] how they don't want the move of God they
[1:47:53] don't want uh the Miracles I mean I just
[1:47:56] marked so many wonderful things that
[1:48:01] were said and you know the parts about
[1:48:05] people condemning you know someone gets
[1:48:07] sick he said brother navel ran into a
[1:48:10] car did any of you know brother R
[1:48:13] Neville ran into a
[1:48:15] car yeah and everybody said he must be
[1:48:18] out of the Lord's will he said not
[1:48:20] so you know I I thought that was a great
[1:48:23] lesson tonight did you notice how he
[1:48:27] talked about someone that took sides
[1:48:29] with Jesus never did a miracle never did
[1:48:31] a work never did anything he said you
[1:48:34] just keep serving him your reward comes
[1:48:37] at the end of the rad he said he said
[1:48:41] that woman that washed his feet never
[1:48:43] LED anybody to Christ maybe not in her
[1:48:46] lifetime but her story has and her
[1:48:50] testimony of just doing that that
[1:48:53] service has brought many
[1:48:56] backslider back to serving God uh I I
[1:49:00] just hope that we can see the
[1:49:04] seriousness and the difference between
[1:49:08] believing something and having Creeds
[1:49:11] and dogmas because this message has a
[1:49:15] lot of doctrinal truth but without
[1:49:18] Christ that doctrine of truth becomes a
[1:49:21] Creed and the doctrine it's something we
[1:49:24] believe but brother Brandon was talking
[1:49:27] about a life we live and so we've got to
[1:49:31] really take into
[1:49:33] consideration that everything is going
[1:49:36] to throw off against us the government's
[1:49:40] going to throw off against us the laws
[1:49:42] of the land are going to throw off
[1:49:44] against
[1:49:46] us they want to turn our fellowships
[1:49:49] into
[1:49:51] warehouses they they want us to be the
[1:49:53] evil
[1:49:55] ones because we gather did you remember
[1:49:58] the part in that tape where he said they
[1:50:01] want to shut it down because when those
[1:50:03] people get together miracles
[1:50:06] happen people get
[1:50:09] well and that's what they don't want
[1:50:12] because it disproves every single one of
[1:50:16] their
[1:50:16] theories and and as a
[1:50:20] Christian and as a brother and as the
[1:50:24] Lord leads me to see this and I see that
[1:50:28] man
[1:50:30] creates a
[1:50:33] pandemic and they they say you know get
[1:50:38] totally afraid of
[1:50:40] it and yet a
[1:50:43] Christian he goes to the
[1:50:46] doctor and if the doctors can't take
[1:50:49] care of it he goes what a little little
[1:50:54] higher you you understand they why do
[1:50:56] they want to take the little higher away
[1:50:59] from
[1:51:02] us you you you in other words we are
[1:51:05] fighting such a mental battle and I sit
[1:51:08] here and I think well how can I appease
[1:51:11] this side and and appease that side and
[1:51:15] then he finally comes down and says just
[1:51:17] take sides with
[1:51:20] Jesus I suffer the little ones to come
[1:51:23] un me all ye that are sick and heavy
[1:51:27] laden come unto me and I'll give you
[1:51:31] rest amen you know our testimony he says
[1:51:34] go out into the world how do you know
[1:51:37] that you're not that one person that
[1:51:39] makes the whole difference for the
[1:51:42] community I mean this is the
[1:51:47] thief that came in in the night
[1:51:54] this thing I've never seen anything Rob
[1:51:58] Christians that used to have the words
[1:52:01] of Faith pouring out of their mouths and
[1:52:04] now they haven't come to the house of
[1:52:06] the Lord they haven't C called anybody
[1:52:09] they there there's nothing about their
[1:52:12] lives that are are saying hey I miss you
[1:52:15] I long for you I long
[1:52:17] for the word and if you go back and
[1:52:20] listen to this he draws a great
[1:52:24] distinction between people that believe
[1:52:28] and and stay that and the person that
[1:52:31] goes out and lets that love of God be
[1:52:34] shed abroad in their heart well as much
[1:52:38] as people have stayed home I'll
[1:52:39] guarantee you their couch is
[1:52:44] converted their couch is full of
[1:52:47] love and you say well brother
[1:52:50] mcer you know what I long for people to
[1:52:53] get over the
[1:52:56] fear what's going to happen if oh
[1:52:58] brother MC I haven't had the virus I can
[1:53:02] go through the people in the church that
[1:53:03] have had it they've
[1:53:06] suffered and they've got well and they
[1:53:09] raise their hand up and they give God
[1:53:11] the glory for being healed I don't want
[1:53:14] anybody to be
[1:53:17] sick but I I would rather serve God and
[1:53:22] be sick then not serve
[1:53:26] God you you know what I mean I just
[1:53:29] think that it comes a time where you
[1:53:31] just got to walk out by faith and and
[1:53:34] those men were told if you go and preach
[1:53:38] in this name of Jesus we'll chop your
[1:53:40] head
[1:53:41] off Angel lets them out of prison they
[1:53:44] all get
[1:53:46] together they all get together and
[1:53:49] they're praising the baby Jesus
[1:53:53] and all the Miracles that God has done I
[1:53:57] I in my heart I I'm just wondering what
[1:54:02] does God have for
[1:54:04] us if we can come together in that unity
[1:54:08] in love that he spoke about in this book
[1:54:12] what does God have for us and why is the
[1:54:16] enemy trying to crush it so
[1:54:20] bad cuz it proves he's a
[1:54:23] liar and you're are predestinated part
[1:54:27] of a kingdom and he's
[1:54:30] jealous of you cuz you're going to cast
[1:54:34] him
[1:54:35] out and you're going to throw him in to
[1:54:39] the Lake of Fire and you're going to
[1:54:42] judge him amen amen church just go back
[1:54:45] and take that into
[1:54:48] consideration you know and I know you're
[1:54:51] here but if there is anybody listening
[1:54:54] online then I I really would hope they
[1:54:57] would take that into consideration and
[1:55:01] come to some place in their
[1:55:04] heart but I ask the question is you've
[1:55:08] got to come to the find out what's
[1:55:10] leading
[1:55:12] you what's influencing you and I could
[1:55:16] go through pages I mean this was this
[1:55:19] was a marvelous sermon
[1:55:23] marvelous and
[1:55:25] wonderful marvelous to
[1:55:29] behold what was spoke to us tonight I I
[1:55:32] certainely hope it was a a blessing to
[1:55:35] you brother Brandon prayed at the end he
[1:55:37] said he hoped that what was said would
[1:55:40] give some hope and some leadership to
[1:55:44] everybody that heard it and that's my
[1:55:47] prayer tonight that you were that you
[1:55:49] were blessed by the word of God let's
[1:55:52] stand together we'll say a word of
[1:55:54] prayer brother Billy can lead us in a
[1:55:56] song of worship or two and dismiss
[1:56:02] us let us
[1:56:05] pray heavenly
[1:56:08] father I'm humbled by the words that
[1:56:11] were spoken tonight by your
[1:56:15] Prophet the subjects that he
[1:56:19] covered about doctors being in
[1:56:23] medicine God using
[1:56:25] it what he talked about doing good works
[1:56:29] and and serving you what he said about
[1:56:33] lifting one another up what he said
[1:56:36] about the fellowship that used to be
[1:56:38] with the Believers where they would
[1:56:42] cry they would cry cuz they had to wait
[1:56:46] till Wednesday to see one
[1:56:49] another he said I'm not condemning
[1:56:52] you but I just want to bring it to your
[1:56:57] attention that's the way we should be as
[1:57:02] Christians Lord I hope it catches our
[1:57:06] attention it's not David McGary saying

[1:58:53] them and that they'll know one thing
[1:58:56] that if God be for them who can be
[1:58:59] against them and that if they take sides
[1:59:02] with
