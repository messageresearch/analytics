[0:22] [music]
[1:45] Good evening everyone. We're just uh
[1:47] grateful to be here this evening as we
[1:50] uh have our Sunday school class give
[1:54] their uh Christmas program. And there's
[1:57] so many good things that come from it
[2:00] when the children work together and they
[2:04] work together as a team. They support
[2:06] one another and they learn uh the
[2:10] benefits of uh participating in
[2:15] something and it takes a lot of effort,
[2:17] takes a lot of love and it takes a a lot
[2:22] of our Sunday school teachers and
[2:26] helpers and everybody donating their
[2:29] time. So the benefits are uh really
[2:33] long-term
[2:35] and uh so we're grateful for it and so
[2:38] happy for it and so every year they come
[2:42] up with some idea and then they work on
[2:47] that idea and they share the parts and
[2:50] everybody cooperates together. So we're
[2:53] going to open with prayer and then we're
[2:55] going to turn it over to brother uh uh
[2:57] Tim Syler. He directs our Sunday school
[3:00] and coordinates everything. And we can
[3:03] see all their handiwork and all their
[3:06] ideas up here. And and uh
[3:10] these are the pyramids. I thought that
[3:12] was quite well done. And and uh so uh
[3:16] we're just going to do that. So let
[3:18] let's all just pray together uh as we
[3:22] bow our heads. Our gracious heavenly
[3:23] father, Lord, we celebrate the time that
[3:28] you
[3:30] chose in your eternal plan to become
[3:34] flesh and dwelt among us. And Father,
[3:38] then to go on to Calvary and pay the
[3:42] price for our sins. And we're grateful,
[3:45] heavenly father, that we celebrate this
[3:47] time of year, this time that you've
[3:50] chosen.
[3:51] and we remember the birth of your son
[3:55] and how marvelous it was. We thank you
[3:58] for your goodness and love to us.
[4:01] We thank you for those Sunday school
[4:04] teachers and helpers who love the
[4:06] children and want to teach them about
[4:09] your our great savior. So, Father, once
[4:12] again, we ask you to smile upon us,
[4:16] to love us, to be here with us this
[4:19] evening, and we're grateful for it. We
[4:22] ask your blessings now in the precious
[4:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[4:28] Amen. Amen.
[4:36] This is our precious brother Tim Syler
[4:40] and he's done so much for us and we just
[4:43] ask God to richly bless him.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. Tim,
[4:46] &gt;&gt; welcome. Welcome. This is uh as he said
[4:49] the 2025
[4:51] Christian Life Tabernacle
[4:55] Sunday school Christmas program. Uh
[4:59] somebody came up with the idea of a
[5:00] Christmas road trip. We've all been on
[5:02] those road trips. You're riding in the
[5:04] car and it just gets uh long and boring.
[5:07] You think when are we going to get
[5:08] there? And along the way, they recite
[5:11] the Christmas story. So, it's integrated
[5:13] in that. But I tell you, it's been a
[5:15] blessing to see the excitement level,
[5:19] the ferveny, and the dedication of
[5:22] children at such a young age jumping in
[5:25] and doing their part. They really enjoy
[5:26] this. So I hope that the excitement of
[5:29] this and the story itself and the
[5:31] meaning of it can come through and
[5:34] transmit to us and we get the same
[5:36] excitement level. So without further
[5:39] ado,
[5:40] a Christmas road trip, a journey to
[5:44] remember. Lord bless you.
[5:48] Hey, pardon me. By the way, this uh will
[5:52] kind of conclude the Sunday school
[5:54] activities for this year, okay? because
[5:56] of uh the holidays and the set and
[5:59] tomorrow we're going to be doing the
[6:01] singing. There won't be any Sunday
[6:02] school until about January 4. I think
[6:05] that's the date the next Sunday school
[6:07] will be in attendance. Okay. Lord bless
[6:10] you.
[7:04] all Christmas, a time of love and joy, a
[7:07] time of peace and goodwill.
[7:10] A time for decorating and baking and
[7:12] realizing you don't have time to
[7:13] decorate or bake. A time of driving to
[7:16] the mall you didn't realize was still
[7:18] open and not being able to find a
[7:21] parking space.
[7:24] And it's a time for family. Many of us
[7:27] will be hitting the road this Christmas.
[7:29] Going home for the holidays in order to
[7:31] see family and friends we haven't seen
[7:33] in some time. Spreading a little holiday
[7:37] with those we love, if we still have any
[7:40] to spare.
[7:42] The Anderson family is about to start
[7:44] their long journey to grandpa's house.
[7:47] This trip will be proved to be a road
[7:49] trip they won't ever forget. One that
[7:52] reminds them of what Christmas is really
[7:54] all about. Let's check in on the
[7:56] Andersons as they get ready to hit the
[7:58] road.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the last of the bags. We're
[8:08] going to be gone for 3 days, but we have
[8:10] enough clothes and supplies for a month.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; You never know what the weather's going
[8:13] to be like out there, or in your dad's
[8:15] house for that matter.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[8:18] &gt;&gt; He goes a little crazy with the the
[8:19] thermostat. [snorts]
[8:20] Last
[8:22] last time we went last time we went to
[8:25] grandpa's house. It was so cold in my
[8:27] room. I had to wear my pa.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; The time before that, it was so hot. I I
[8:32] use a tub of ice cream as a pillow.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; No complaining, everyone.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Why do we have to go to grandpa's at
[8:38] all? It's Christmas.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; That's why we're going to Grandpa's.
[8:41] It's Christmas.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; But what about all those Christmas
[8:44] presents? We're going to have to wait
[8:45] until after Christmas to open them. No,
[8:48] I packed all of the presents so we can
[8:49] open them at grandpa's.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; What about the singing? The youth group
[8:53] is going going Christmas going through
[8:55] the neighborhood tonight and I'm going
[8:56] to miss it.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; There's a Christmas Eve service at your
[8:59] grandfather's church. You'll have plenty
[9:00] of chances to sing.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; What about mom's Christmas cookies? We
[9:03] can't have Christmas without those.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Of course, I packed by Christmas cookies
[9:08] and left them on the counter. Turn
[9:09] around. We have to go back for the
[9:11] Christmas cookies.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Look at you all. Christmas isn't isn't
[9:14] about gifts, songs, or cookies.
[9:16] Christmas is about a family.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; You're right.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; I thought Christmas was about Jesus.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; Of course, you're right, Alicia.
[9:24] Christmas is about Jesus. When he when
[9:27] he left heaven and came to earth, he God
[9:29] made sure that he had a family. We need
[9:33] We need everyone in our world to love
[9:35] and care for us. We We know that we
[9:37] belong and we are not alone in this
[9:40] world. So, God gave us a gift to family.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; You're right, Dad. I'm glad I have you,
[9:45] mom, and even Alicia.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; I love you, too, Kylie. And now that
[9:48] group lives all alone in that big house,
[9:50] he needs to do that he still has a
[9:52] family that loves him, that he still
[9:53] belongs.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; That's really sweet, you two. I'm proud
[10:03] of you both. This is shaping up of the
[10:06] start of a great road trip.
[10:10] Where are you going? This is the way we
[10:11] usually go to get there. I'm going back.
[10:14] I'm headed back home first. will
[10:16] kill me if we don't show up without your
[10:18] Christmas cookies.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; The Christmas road trip is nothing new.
[10:24] It started long ago. The first Christmas
[10:27] travelers came from very far away all
[10:29] the way from heaven to deliver some good
[10:31] news.
[10:40] And in the sixth month, the angel
[10:41] Gabriel was sent from Gon into a city of
[10:44] Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin, a
[10:47] spouse to a man whose name was Joseph,
[10:49] the house of David, and the verdant's
[10:51] name was Mary. [snorts] And the angel
[10:54] came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou
[10:58] that art highly favored, the Lord is
[11:00] with thee. Blessed art thou among women.
[11:03] And when she saw him, she was troubled
[11:05] at his saying, and cast her mind what
[11:07] manner of solution this should be. And
[11:10] the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary,
[11:13] for thou hast found favor with God. And
[11:16] behold, thy shall conceive in thy womb,
[11:19] and bring forth a son, and shall call
[11:21] his name Jesus. And he shall be great,
[11:24] and shall be called the son of the
[11:25] highest. And the Lord God shall give
[11:28] unto him the throne of his father David.
[11:30] and he shall reign over the house of
[11:32] Jacob forever. And the and of his
[11:35] kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary
[11:37] said unto the angel, how shall this be,
[11:40] seeing I know not a man? And the angel
[11:42] said, angel answered and said unto her,
[11:46] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
[11:48] the power of the highest shall
[11:50] overshadow thee. Therefore also the holy
[11:53] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[11:56] be called the son of God. And behold,
[11:58] thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also
[12:01] conceived a son in her old age, and this
[12:04] is the sixth month with her, who was
[12:06] called barren. For with God nothing
[12:08] shall be impossible. And Mary said,
[12:11] Behold, the handmade of the Lord, it be
[12:14] unto me according to thy word. And the
[12:16] angel departed from her.
[12:21] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[12:23] this wise when as his mother Mary was.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[12:41] this wise when as his mother Mary was
[12:44] espoused to Joseph before they came
[12:46] together she was found with the child of
[12:49] the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her
[12:51] husband, being just a man, and not
[12:53] willing to make her a public example,
[12:55] was mighty to put her away privately.
[12:58] But while he thought on these things,
[13:00] behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
[13:01] unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thy
[13:05] son of David, fear not to take unto thee
[13:08] Mary thy wife. For that which is
[13:11] conceived in her is the Holy Ghost, and
[13:14] she shall bring forth a son, and thou
[13:16] shalt call his name Jesus. For he shall
[13:19] save his people from their sins. Now all
[13:22] this was done that it might be
[13:24] fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord
[13:26] by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin
[13:29] shall be the child and bring forth the
[13:31] son, and they shall call his name
[13:33] Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God
[13:37] with us. Then Joseph, being raised from
[13:39] sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had
[13:42] bidden him, and took unto him his wife,
[13:45] and knew her not till she had brought
[13:47] forth her firstborn son. And he called
[13:49] his name Jesus.
[14:07] Oh. Oh, there's one from Kansas. I just
[14:09] Kansas. I just need um one from Hawaii,
[14:11] Alaska, and Vermont. And I'll win
[14:13] license plate bingo.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; That's nice, Mom.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Hooray.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; You two are way behind. It's almost like
[14:22] you're not even trying to win.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think they are.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Okay, so you're obviously bored with
[14:28] license plate bingo. We can sing
[14:30] Christmas songs.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; How much longer until we get there?
[14:35] Kylie, don't ask that again.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; We will get
[14:39] &gt;&gt; get there when we get there.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; How on earth can you to be bored? Look
[14:43] at the wonderful sides we are
[14:44] encountering on this journey.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; What sides?
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Why? There's a ferocious mountain line.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; That's a cat in someone's yard.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; And 2 minutes ago, we passed a mighty
[14:53] Amazon River.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; You mean that bridge that run over that
[14:56] little creek?
[14:56] &gt;&gt; And up ahead, I could see the Eiffel
[14:58] Tower.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, dear. What
[15:00] do you call that then?
[15:01] &gt;&gt; A weird looking tree. Ah, forget it. The
[15:06] Christmas tradition sizing has totally
[15:09] un has totally lost on you all.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Since when is sight seeing a Christmas
[15:14] Christmas tradition?
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Since first Christmas.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; What?
[15:17] &gt;&gt; An angel appeared in the
[15:23] an angel appeared in the shepherds
[15:27] followed by a whole company of heavenly
[15:29] hosts. That must have been quite a
[15:30] sight.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Sure. And when the shepherds went to
[15:33] Bethlehem, they saw the greatest side of
[15:35] all,
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Jesus was God's gift to
[15:38] us. He sent his son to us so so we so we
[15:42] could have the gift of the family.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; That must have been quite sad for the
[15:47] shepherds to see the savior of the world
[15:49] as a little baby.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's good to just sit back and
[15:52] relax and enjoy the sight.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; I see. We're driving up the Grand Canyon
[15:57] right now.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; What Grand Canyon?
[16:01] Bottle,
[16:09] &gt;&gt; what sites are you seeing this
[16:11] Christmas? Or better still, who do you
[16:14] have your sight set on? Now, Mary and
[16:16] Joseph start out on their own road trip.
[16:22] And it came pass in those days that
[16:24] there went out a decree from Caesar
[16:26] Augustus that all the world should be
[16:28] taxed. And this taxing was first made in
[16:31] Sierra the governor of Syria. And all
[16:33] went to be taxed everyone into his own
[16:36] city. And Joseph also went up from
[16:39] Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into
[16:42] Judea unto the city of David which is
[16:45] called Bethlehem because he was he was
[16:48] of the house of David to be taxed with
[16:51] Mary his espoused wife being great with
[16:54] child. And so it was that while they
[16:56] were the days were accomplished that she
[16:59] would be delivered and she brought forth
[17:03] her son her son and wrapped him in a
[17:05] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[17:07] manger because there was no room for
[17:10] them in the end.
[17:17] There's still more traveling to be done
[17:19] for our angel friends. They've been
[17:21] really busy lately. They will be joined
[17:23] by a group of shepherds who only have a
[17:26] little ways down the road to get to
[17:27] their destination.
[17:33] And there were in the same country
[17:36] shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
[17:38] watch over their flock by night. And lo,
[17:41] the angel of the Lord came upon them,
[17:43] and the glory of the Lord shone around
[17:46] shone around
[17:48] about them, and they were sore afraid.
[17:51] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[17:54] for behold, I bring you good tidings,
[17:57] for great joy, which shall be to all
[18:01] people. For unto you is born this day in
[18:04] the city of David, a Savior which is
[18:07] called Christ the Lord. And this shall
[18:10] be a sign unto you, ye shall find the
[18:13] babe wrapped in a swaddling clothing,
[18:16] lying lying in a manger." And suddenly
[18:19] there was with an angel a multitude of
[18:22] of the heavenly hosts praising God and
[18:25] saying, "Glory to glory in the highest
[18:28] and on earth peace God will toward men."
[18:32] And it came to pass as the angels were
[18:34] gone away and for in into heaven. The
[18:39] shepherd said one to another, "Let us go
[18:42] now, go even unto Bethlehem, and see
[18:46] this thing which is come to pass, which
[18:49] the Lord hath made known unto us." And
[18:53] they came with haste, and found Mary and
[18:55] Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
[18:58] And when they had seen it, they known
[19:01] aboard and the saying which was told
[19:06] them concerning this child, and all that
[19:09] they heard, it was it wondered if those
[19:13] things which were told them by the
[19:17] shepherds. But Mary kept all these
[19:19] things, and pondered them in her heart.
[19:23] And the shepherd returned glorifying and
[19:25] praising God for all for all the things
[19:28] that they had heard and seen as it was
[19:31] told unto them.
[19:38] Ready?
[19:41] The first thing I'm going to do when we
[19:43] get to Grandpa's house is give him a big
[19:45] hug and say, "I missed you and I love
[19:47] you." The first thing I'm going to do is
[19:49] kneel down and kiss the solid ground and
[19:51] say I missed you and I love you.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; We haven't been in the car that long.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; We won't be too much longer now. Just
[19:57] take this next right onto Highway 17 and
[19:59] then it's a straight shot the rest of
[20:01] the way.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; We do not take the next right.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; That's what the GPS says.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; I've been to my grandpa's house a
[20:07] million times. I know the way to go.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; And there goes our turn.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; That's not our turn. We go down three
[20:16] miles and then we turn left. Not right,
[20:19] left.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; I think the lady who lives in the GPS
[20:22] knows better than you do, Dad.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; There's no lady living in computer. It's
[20:27] just a computer.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Her voice sounds too natural. She can't
[20:30] be a computer.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; She is. I mean, it's a computer.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; And the computer says we need to make
[20:36] the next available U-turn.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Shut that thing off. I know the way to
[20:39] go.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Dad, can I ask you a question?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Is it about the GPS? No.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Then go ahead.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Why don't you have to do the things you
[20:47] tell me I have to do?
[20:49] &gt;&gt; What on earth are you talking about?
[20:51] &gt;&gt; A couple weeks ago, I was complaining
[20:52] about my volleyball coach. I didn't like
[20:54] the play she was calling. Do you know
[20:56] what you said to me?
[20:57] &gt;&gt; No,
[20:58] &gt;&gt; I do. You told Kylie when someone knows
[21:00] more than us. We should follow them. Let
[21:02] them show us the way.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; That doesn't sound like me. Yes, it
[21:05] does.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Why don't Why don't I have to follow
[21:09] Coach Benson and you don't have to
[21:11] follow
[21:12] &gt;&gt; I get it. I get it.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; This reminds me of the star.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; What?
[21:17] &gt;&gt; The Christmas star. The magi understood
[21:19] that God had placed that star in the sky
[21:21] and so they followed it. God through the
[21:24] star led them straight to Jesus. We
[21:26] don't always know the way we should go,
[21:27] but we can trust God and but we can
[21:30] follow God and trust that he will show
[21:31] us the way.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; That's really nice, Mom.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sweetie.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[21:36] &gt;&gt; What's wrong, Dad?
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing there, Jess. Where's talk about?
[21:40] There should be a talk about right
[21:42] before that turn.
[21:44] Make the next available U-turn. Now you
[21:47] tell me.
[21:50] We are now joined by more travelers on
[21:52] this Christmas road trip. Men who have
[21:54] come from very far away. Magi or wise
[21:57] men from the east. They come bearing
[22:00] gifts to God's gift to us, Jesus.
[22:05] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[22:08] Judea, [clears throat] in [snorts] the
[22:10] days of Herod the king, behold, there
[22:14] came wise men from the east to
[22:16] Jerusalem,
[22:18] saying, "Where is he born king of the
[22:21] Jews? For we have seen his star in the
[22:25] east, and we are come to worship him."
[22:28] When Herod the king had heard these
[22:30] things, he was troubled and all
[22:32] Jerusalem with him.
[22:35] And when he had gathered all the chief
[22:38] priests and scribes of the people
[22:40] together, he demanded he demanded
[22:44] of them where a Christ should be born.
[22:48] And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem, O
[22:52] Judea, for thus it is written by the
[22:54] prophet, [clears throat]
[22:57] and thou [snorts] Bethlehem and the land
[22:59] of Judah, art not least [clears throat]
[23:03] among the princes of Judah, for help
[23:06] thee shall come a governor that shall
[23:08] rule my people Israel."
[23:11] Then Herod, when he had privy called the
[23:14] wise men, inquired of them diligently
[23:17] what time the star appeared, and he sent
[23:20] them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go search
[23:23] diligently for the young child, and when
[23:25] ye have found him, bring me bring me
[23:28] word again, that I may come and worship
[23:31] him also."
[23:37] When they had heard the king, they
[23:40] departed, and lo, the star which they
[23:43] saw in the east went before them.
[23:46] [clears throat] Till it stood over where
[23:48] the young child was.
[23:51] When they saw the star, they rejoiced
[23:53] with exceeding great joy. And when they
[23:57] come into the house, they saw the young
[23:59] child with Mary, his mother, and fell
[24:02] down and worshiped him. And when they
[24:04] had opened their treasures treasures,
[24:07] they presented unto him gifts, gold,
[24:11] frankincense, and myrr.
[24:40] There's a gas station.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; I said no. We have to stick with the
[24:44] plan.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Come on, Dad. I'm dying back here.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; We went to the bathroom 30 minutes ago.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; She didn't have to go then.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; It's only 1 hour until we get to
[24:53] Grandpa's house. You could go then.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; I'll never make it. Dear, she looks like
[24:58] she's about to burst. We really need to
[24:59] stop.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; This was not the plan. The plan was to
[25:03] stop at 12:15 for lunch, which we did.
[25:06] Then go back on the road at 12:55, which
[25:08] we did. Then use the restroom break
[25:10] between 2:00 or 2:03,
[25:12] &gt;&gt; which we did.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; We did.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; But okay, but hurry.
[25:32] I hate when things don't go to plan.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; When do they ever?
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Most of the time.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; I don't think so, dear.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; What about your plan to lose 10 lbs this
[25:40] year, Dad?
[25:41] &gt;&gt; I'm almost there. Just 50 more pounds to
[25:43] go.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Or when you plan to fill that bookcase
[25:46] for Kylie's room and the whole thing
[25:48] fell apart.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; She doesn't read very much anyway.
[25:50] Remember when we wanted that house on
[25:52] Sycamore, but someone else got it?
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Our house is better than that one
[25:56] anyway.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; I agree, but that wasn't the plan.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Much better. Thanks, Dad.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; So, you're saying that things don't
[26:09] really go as planned?
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Sure they do.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Kylie, we were just telling your dad
[26:13] that things don't always work out the
[26:15] way he intended.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; No, but God's plan never fails. You're
[26:19] right about that.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; It was God's plan to show us his love
[26:24] and uh and make a way to save us from
[26:27] our sin. So, he gave us his son, Jesus.
[26:30] And even when King Herod had a plan to
[26:33] stop him, it failed.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. And God has a plan for
[26:40] each one of us. And nothing can stop
[26:41] God's plan.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; I think God had a different plan for us
[26:45] than us getting to Grandpa's house.
[26:55] Why do you say that?
[26:56] &gt;&gt; We just got a flat tire.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Our Christmas road trip has been a happy
[27:04] one. We have met the savior of the
[27:06] world, Jesus, God's own son. But tragedy
[27:09] is just around the corner. We must hit
[27:12] the road again, this time to save a
[27:14] child's life. Others won't be so
[27:16] fortunate.
[27:22] And being warned of God in a dream that
[27:25] they should not return to Herod, they
[27:28] departed into their own country another
[27:30] way.
[27:32] And when they were departed, behold, the
[27:35] angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph in
[27:38] a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young
[27:42] child and his mother, and flee into
[27:45] Egypt, [snorts] and be thou there until
[27:47] I bring thee word, for Herod will seek
[27:50] the young child and destroy him."
[27:53] And when he arose, he took the young
[27:56] child and his mother by night, and
[27:58] departed into Egypt.
[28:01] And when they were unto the death of
[28:04] Herod, that it might be fulfilled, which
[28:06] was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
[28:09] saying, "Out of out of Egypt, I have
[28:13] called my son." There Herod, when he saw
[28:17] that he was mocked, he [snorts]
[28:20] he the wise man was exceeding worth and
[28:24] set forth and slew all the children that
[28:27] were in Bethlehem.
[28:29] and in all the cost. Therefore, from 2
[28:33] years old and under, according to the
[28:36] time which he had diligently inquired of
[28:40] them, of the wise men. Then was fulfill
[28:44] that which was spoken by Jeremiah the
[28:47] prophet, saying, "And Rama, there is a
[28:50] voice heard lemonation and weeping in
[28:53] great mourning. Rachel weeping for her
[28:56] children and will not be conformed
[28:59] because they are not. But when Herod was
[29:02] dead, behold, the angel of the Lord
[29:04] appearth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
[29:08] saying, "Arise, and take the young child
[29:11] and his mother, and go into the land of
[29:14] Israel, for they are dead, which sought
[29:17] the young child's life." and he arose
[29:22] and took the young child and his mother
[29:24] and came into the land of Israel.
[29:28] When he heard that Archus did reign in
[29:31] Judah in the room of his father Herod,
[29:35] he was afraid to go there not staring
[29:38] standing. Being warned of God in a
[29:41] dream, he turned aside to the parts of
[29:44] Galilee. and came dwelt in a city called
[29:48] Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled
[29:50] which was spoken by the prophet. He
[29:53] shall he shall be called a Nazarene.
[30:01] Jesus, he made the ultimate road trip,
[30:04] leaving his place in heaven to come to
[30:06] earth. He left his place as God the son
[30:10] to become a baby, the son of Mary and
[30:12] Joseph. His trip would continue as he
[30:16] grew into a man. As he preached about
[30:18] God's kingdom. As he healed and
[30:20] performed miracles,
[30:22] as [snorts] he went to a cross for us.
[30:24] As he died for our sins, as he was
[30:27] placed in a tomb, as he rose again from
[30:30] that tomb to life again. What a journey.
[30:34] How will you be hitting the road this
[30:36] Christmas? Wherever you travel to,
[30:39] whether it's across the country to see a
[30:40] family, across town to see the lights,
[30:43] or across the living room to the kitchen
[30:45] to grab another cookie, we invite you to
[30:48] take that trip with Jesus. He wants to
[30:50] hit the road with you, to be your
[30:52] savior, to shine his light brightly in
[30:54] your heart. Not just at Christmas at
[30:57] Christmas, but every day.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[31:11] [applause]
[31:18] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word and the
[31:20] word was with God and the word was God.
[31:24] The same was in the beginning with God.
[31:26] All things were made by him and without
[31:28] him was not anything made that was made.
[31:30] In him was life, and the life was the
[31:32] light of men. And the light shineth in
[31:34] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[31:36] it not. There was a man sent from God,
[31:39] whose name was John. The same came for a
[31:41] witness, to bear witness of that light,
[31:43] that all men through him might believe.
[31:45] He was not that light, but sent to bear
[31:47] witness of that light. That was the true
[31:49] light, which lightth every man that
[31:51] cometh into the world. He was in the
[31:53] world, and the world was made by him,
[31:55] and the world knew him not. He came into
[31:58] his own, and his own received him not.
[32:00] But as many as received him, to them
[32:01] gave he the power to become the sons of
[32:03] God, even them that believe in his name,
[32:07] which were born not of blood, nor the
[32:09] will of flesh, nor the will of man, but
[32:11] of God. And the word was made flesh and
[32:13] dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory,
[32:16] the glory of the only begotten of the
[32:17] father, full of grace and truth.
[32:26] Let me tell you what I think about him.
[32:28] I think in his birth he was wonderful.
[32:31] Though he came to you by the way of a
[32:33] stable door and went out through capital
[32:35] punishment, yet there's never been a
[32:37] virgin kings, whatever it might be.
[32:39] There's never been a virtue compared
[32:41] with it or never will be. He was a pant
[32:43] born son of a living God when he was
[32:45] born here. When he was in his wisdom, he
[32:48] was natural. There was no one could
[32:50] match it with him. As a preacher, never
[32:53] a man could take back any machine.
[32:56] That's right. As a healer, he was
[32:58] divine. Hallelujah. If there any death,
[33:01] he was my redeemer. Living, he loved me,
[33:04] dying, he saved me, carried, he carried
[33:07] my sins far away. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[33:10] When he returned on earth, he looked
[33:12] like God. He acted like God. He said he
[33:14] was God. He lived like God. He preached
[33:17] like God. He died like God. He rose like
[33:20] God. He is God.
[33:23] He was our

[54:09] tonight I think they did a wonderful job
[54:10] and let's give them one more round of
[54:12] applause. I think it's worth it.
[54:14] [applause]
[54:22] I see brother Adrian here. Thank you for
[54:24] all the desserts. he's always uh coming
[54:27] through for us and uh all the we're uh
[54:29] we're neglecting refreshments tonight.
[54:31] We're going to do this again in the
[54:33] morning and it's already kind of getting
[54:34] late on us. So I say we're going to do
[54:36] this. We're going to do the singing
[54:38] portion of this. We're going to take all
[54:39] this down tonight and restore the pulpit
[54:41] as far as I know. So uh thank you and
[54:44] the Lord bless you and appreciate your
[54:45] attendance and and the Lord be with you
[54:47] and be safe on your travels home. God
[54:50] bless.
[54:58] Amen. Didn't they do great?
[55:01] Amen. [applause]
[55:06] I like that King Herod waving that
[55:08] stick. I thought that was that was
[55:10] pretty good. each of their parts. You
[55:12] know, uh we got we invest a lot in our
[55:17] children and there's no better place to
[55:20] invest and it takes a lot of time.
[55:23] Somebody took a lot of time out of their
[55:25] life to get all these kids I guess has
[55:28] 60some kids right there all working
[55:31] together all doing their part that
[55:33] harmony you know no wonder Jesus said
[55:36] unless you become like little children
[55:38] you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven
[55:40] and and I just thought it was a
[55:42] beautiful example and once again we'd
[55:44] like to thank brother Tim
[55:46] sister Melinda and all the Sunday school
[55:49] teachers and helpers and everybody and
[55:52] And just remember this will be a memory
[55:55] that the children carry in their heart
[55:57] and it was a blessing to me and I
[56:00] appreciate God's love for us that he
[56:03] would send his only begotten son and
[56:05] that he would bring into our lives his
[56:09] love and his joy and also let us know
[56:13] that he has a place prepared for us and
[56:15] we want all our kids to make it. So keep
[56:18] us in prayer. Tomorrow we'll have a
[56:20] wonderful time and I think we just ought
[56:22] to leave it up, brother Tim, for the
[56:24] morning just and it's so beautiful.
[56:26] You've done such a nice job. Brother Tim
[56:29] built all this and and it's just it's
[56:32] just tremendous. It's it's great.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; All right, Sister Man Harland did the
[56:39] Jeep and it looks like it's ready to
[56:41] drive away and and we appreciate Grandpa
[56:45] in the in the story and and everybody.
[56:48] So, let's just pray and have a good and
[56:50] just let's grow in the love of God and
[56:53] let's share what God's put in our hearts
[56:55] with others because one day the curtain
[56:57] of life's going to come down and we're
[57:00] going to rise out of here. Let's close
[57:01] in prayer this evening. Our gracious
[57:04] father, you've been so good to us and to
[57:06] see the children singing with all their
[57:09] hearts and and being so inspired, you
[57:12] know, and when they saw the star, they
[57:15] rejoiced. Father, when I saw your son in
[57:18] my life, I rejoiced. And may each heart
[57:21] in here be blessed this evening. May we
[57:24] have a good night's rest. And Father,
[57:27] may we come back in the morning to
[57:29] worship you. We thank you for the
[57:31] effort. Father, may you reward them a
[57:33] hundfold in this life, in the life to
[57:36] come. Now we ask your blessings on us in
[57:39] the precious and wonderful name of the
[57:41] Lord Jesus Christ. We are dismissed. God
[57:45] bless you. Thank you so much.
