[45:26] first corinthians chapter 11.
[45:34] i want to read from the 23rd verse
[45:41] for i received of the lord that which
[45:44] also i delivered unto you
[45:47] that the lord jesus the same night in
[45:48] which he was betrayed took bread
[45:51] and when he had given thanks he break it
[45:54] and said
[45:56] take it this is my body which is broken
[45:59] for you
[46:00] do this in remembrance of me
[46:04] after the same manner also he took
[46:07] the cup when he accept
[46:10] saying this is this cup is the new
[46:13] testament
[46:14] in my blood this he do
[46:18] as of as ye drink it in remembrance of
[46:21] me
[46:26] may the lord has ready to love the word
[46:28] you may be seated
[46:35] and we thank the lord this evening for
[46:39] bringing us back again
[46:43] we thank him for all that he's doing our
[46:45] life
[46:47] preparing us for his coming
[46:51] to come and take us back home
[46:55] tonight as we are all informed
[47:00] that we're going to take communion i
[47:03] hope we are all prepared
[47:04] for the convenience service i believe
[47:09] we know what communion is and
[47:12] [Music]
[47:13] we are ready to be part of it
[47:18] tonight yeah we thank the lord for the
[47:21] scripture red
[47:24] this is paul writing to the corinthians
[47:29] trying to tell them about what communion
[47:33] is
[47:35] and the conditions by which
[47:38] they take it
[47:41] i believe
[47:44] that communion is an ordinance of the
[47:47] lord
[47:50] two thousand years ago we're forbidden
[47:53] to do it
[47:54] we're bidding to do it and as we do it
[47:57] we remember
[47:58] the lord we know communion
[48:05] is for overcomings
[48:10] because if we go back the scripture we
[48:11] found out that when abraham
[48:14] when he went and conquered
[48:18] the kings slaughtered them
[48:22] and he was coming back victoriously
[48:26] he met mercy zedek
[48:29] and then the scripture said he had a
[48:32] communion with him he strengthened him
[48:34] he fortified him
[48:37] gave him bread and wine
[48:40] and abram gave entities to him
[48:44] so communion is for overcomers
[48:49] those that overcome the enemy
[48:53] those that overcome all the forces
[48:58] that are fighting their christian life
[49:01] communion is for them
[49:04] and paul
[49:09] warned the believers in his days
[49:14] about taking communion without
[49:15] descending
[49:17] the lost body taking communion
[49:21] wasn't seen
[49:24] taking communion
[49:28] was right taking communion
[49:32] they did what the lord expected of them
[49:36] but their problem in taking the
[49:38] communion was that
[49:39] they did not descend the lost body
[49:44] and the lord's body is the believers
[49:49] if we are talking about discernment or
[49:52] descending the lord's body
[49:55] it means doing
[49:59] what the church does not believe
[50:04] if you descend the lord's body you
[50:05] listen the believers
[50:08] you know what we stand for
[50:11] you know what we are believing
[50:15] you flee from it
[50:20] as believers but if you do not
[50:23] descend the lord's body
[50:26] you go doing it so paul won them
[50:31] they did the right thing but they did it
[50:35] without descending the lost body
[50:40] discernment is very important
[50:44] in a believer's life
[50:47] our the same discernment determined
[50:53] where we are going a wrong discernment
[50:59] of the word of god of the ordinances of
[51:03] god
[51:04] will lead you to sin but the right
[51:08] discernment
[51:10] everything a man does as a christian
[51:14] he ought to measure it by the word of
[51:17] god
[51:20] he has to measure it by the message of
[51:22] the arrow
[51:23] he has to measure it by what the church
[51:26] stands for
[51:29] if you don't do it that way then you
[51:32] don't descend the lord's body
[51:35] tonight we are going to take communion
[51:40] communion is an institution of the lord
[51:48] and as i said abraham
[51:52] when he met mercedes he had a communion
[51:55] with him
[51:57] and when the israelites were to leave
[52:01] the land of bodies when god was going to
[52:05] deliver them
[52:06] the scripture made us to know that they
[52:09] were instructed
[52:11] to kill a lamb and when they kill the
[52:14] lamb
[52:17] they should apply the blood at the
[52:18] doctors
[52:20] and they should eat the lung holes
[52:27] they should eat it before the following
[52:30] morning
[52:32] we found out that god instructed them
[52:37] that death engine was to pass by
[52:41] and every house that does not have
[52:45] blood on it the
[52:48] the first born in that house will have
[52:51] to die
[52:53] so they have to make sure that they
[52:56] follow this instruction
[52:58] if you are the firstborn in that house
[53:01] you have to make sure
[53:03] that the blood is applied you have to
[53:06] question your father
[53:07] whether he has done according to what
[53:11] god required of him
[53:14] and we found out that when jesus christ
[53:17] came here
[53:20] before he left he had a communion with
[53:22] his disciples
[53:26] and he even said he is not going to take
[53:29] it with them again on this earth
[53:32] until he take it with them at the other
[53:35] side
[53:37] what is communion
[53:41] we are talking about communion
[53:45] communion is to communicate
[53:50] is to talk is to speak
[53:54] and we have the privilege to have
[53:55] communion
[53:58] tonight it is time to speak
[54:02] with the lord to tell him our heart
[54:05] desire
[54:06] to tell him our needs to tell him the
[54:09] challenges that we are facing in our
[54:11] life
[54:16] to have fellowship with him we find out
[54:19] that in the world
[54:22] when businessmen want to discuss
[54:26] business they go
[54:30] to fellowship by eating together
[54:34] by drinking tea together and during that
[54:38] time
[54:40] they share their visions they share
[54:43] their business plans with one another
[54:46] but tonight it's not business
[54:52] it is spiritual business it's not
[54:55] physical business
[54:56] but it's spiritual business we have the
[54:58] privilege to come before the lord
[55:01] and when we come to eat it we need to
[55:05] tell the lord
[55:06] our challenges the challenges that we
[55:09] are facing
[55:09] in our christian life the challenge that
[55:11] we are facing in our homes
[55:13] the challenging that we are facing in
[55:15] our daily life
[55:16] we need to tell him
[55:20] amen communion
[55:27] whosoever
[55:30] will want to take communion must
[55:33] understand
[55:34] that communion does not save
[55:40] communion does not save as
[55:43] the denominations may teach
[55:48] communion strengthens us
[55:52] fortifies us stimulates us
[55:55] to live a right to us and a clean life
[56:02] according to scripture when israel was
[56:05] instructed
[56:06] to apply the blood at the doorpost with
[56:08] his soup
[56:09] they have to stay indoor
[56:13] they should not go outside
[56:17] even though they apply the blood
[56:21] and they are inside they send one of
[56:23] their
[56:24] foot outside when the death engine comes
[56:27] he'll cut it
[56:31] because it's not protected it's not
[56:33] under the blood
[56:35] when we take communion we need to stay
[56:38] in the world
[56:40] we need to leave by the word
[56:43] we don't take communion and go outside
[56:45] and live anyhow
[56:47] and mingle with the world if we do this
[56:50] we bring reproach upon the world
[56:54] we bring reproach upon christ if we take
[56:57] communion
[56:59] we need to stay inside
[57:02] and coming in
[57:06] is not for everybody
[57:10] when we come to take communion we must
[57:13] make sure that
[57:15] first we are washed by the waters
[57:18] of the world separated
[57:23] by the waters of from our sins
[57:31] amen we must repent
[57:40] from our sins we must repent from our
[57:42] unbelief
[57:45] we must repent for anything
[57:48] that the church does not believe
[57:51] that israel paul inserted the
[57:54] corinthians
[57:56] he said when you come to take it
[57:59] you must first examine yourself
[58:03] self-examination
[58:07] you didn't ask somebody to examine you
[58:10] maybe somebody is examining you there
[58:13] are things you can hide from him
[58:16] you can hide from her but if you are to
[58:20] examine yourself
[58:23] i don't think there's anything you can
[58:24] hide from yourself
[58:27] if you can deceive yourself then you are
[58:30] a miserable fellow
[58:34] amen you need to be frank with yourself
[58:38] so a person everybody must
[58:42] examine him or herself
[58:45] self-examination he said this is what
[58:48] the corinthians did
[58:51] they did not examine themselves they did
[58:53] not descend their lost body
[58:55] so when they took communion some die
[58:59] prematurely when we say they die
[59:02] prematurely
[59:03] it means the number of years that they
[59:06] need to live on earth
[59:09] they could not leave it they died
[59:12] prematurely
[59:14] because they did not descend their lost
[59:16] body
[59:18] but i believe tonight that
[59:22] it is not going to be the physical one
[59:25] but it is going to be the spiritual one
[59:28] some took it and they became sick
[59:33] some took it and they became weak
[59:36] but communion is for divine healing
[59:41] anybody that is sick in a way
[59:44] when you come to take communion that
[59:46] sickness
[59:47] must go because communion is for divine
[59:51] healing
[59:52] i remember at home there was a brother
[59:56] who was suffering from oscar
[59:58] also he's been to many hospitals
[1:00:03] he was not healed there was a day we
[1:00:06] held a communion service
[1:00:08] after taking the communion the following
[1:00:10] day it vanished
[1:00:15] there was a brother who was having
[1:00:18] a west pain he went to the farm
[1:00:21] to go uproot cassava
[1:00:25] and then he has this location in the
[1:00:28] west
[1:00:29] he's been to different hospitals the
[1:00:32] chinese hospitals
[1:00:35] he was not healed one day when we took
[1:00:38] communion the following day
[1:00:42] the sickness vanish the pain vanish
[1:00:46] breathiness is a lot anytime
[1:00:50] there is communion we need to take
[1:00:53] advantage of it
[1:00:55] by taking it rightly
[1:01:00] that is why
[1:01:03] we need to take it by ourselves
[1:01:10] when you come to take it across the
[1:01:13] scripture
[1:01:14] when you take it unworthily
[1:01:18] you eat and you drink damnation for
[1:01:21] yourself
[1:01:22] you think condemnation but i don't think
[1:01:26] a normal person
[1:01:28] will see anything
[1:01:32] which may cost his life
[1:01:37] and then he takes it and drinks it he
[1:01:39] takes it and eat it
[1:01:41] i don't believe it that fellow there's
[1:01:45] something wrong with him
[1:01:47] therefore tonight when coming to take
[1:01:49] the communion
[1:01:52] we need to take it by faith we need to
[1:01:55] take it
[1:01:56] having it repented from our sins
[1:02:00] our own beliefs our backsliding
[1:02:03] we need to take it by faith
[1:02:08] i normally type communion
[1:02:11] to something we do in africa
[1:02:17] in africa when a woman
[1:02:20] the husband dies
[1:02:24] to make sure that he doesn't teach cheat
[1:02:26] on the
[1:02:27] man there's a porridge
[1:02:30] they prepare and give
[1:02:34] to the woman to drink when she drinks it
[1:02:37] if she had cheated on the husband the
[1:02:40] bella would swallow
[1:02:44] if she has not cheated she'll drink it
[1:02:48] and she'll be okay i know my tapping to
[1:02:51] communion
[1:02:53] like paul said if you eat it unworthily
[1:02:57] knowing very well that there's something
[1:02:59] in your heart knowing very well there's
[1:03:01] something you need to put
[1:03:02] right knowing very well that there's
[1:03:04] something between you
[1:03:06] and your brother you and your sister
[1:03:11] and you don't put it right you are
[1:03:14] trading on a dangerous
[1:03:15] ground that's a poor one that
[1:03:19] we have to carry ye for one another
[1:03:23] carry ye for one another
[1:03:27] let us reconcile with one another
[1:03:31] let us forgive one another
[1:03:35] let us make peace with one another
[1:03:40] before we come take it
[1:03:43] then of course
[1:03:47] we will be blessed communion is not for
[1:03:51] case
[1:03:52] it's for a blessing once a man takes it
[1:03:56] rightly
[1:03:57] he need to be blessed she need to be
[1:04:00] blessed
[1:04:01] but if you don't take it rightly that's
[1:04:04] where
[1:04:05] the problem lies you have to take it
[1:04:08] by dedicating yourself you have to take
[1:04:12] it
[1:04:12] by separating yourself from every
[1:04:14] unbelief
[1:04:16] you have to take it with faith you have
[1:04:19] to take it
[1:04:20] proven to the church that you are a
[1:04:24] christian there are many people when we
[1:04:27] talk about communion
[1:04:29] they postpone it
[1:04:32] so let this month's communion go
[1:04:36] i am not ready what are you waiting for
[1:04:38] what are you not ready for
[1:04:40] i'll do it next month maybe next month
[1:04:43] he said another meant again
[1:04:45] and he continued postponing continue
[1:04:47] postponing it and finally
[1:04:51] he will condemn himself there is no fit
[1:04:54] to take communion
[1:04:56] but greatness a lot we have to do it
[1:05:00] to remember the lord
[1:05:04] we have to do it to prove that we are
[1:05:06] christians we have to do it to prove
[1:05:09] that we believe the total word
[1:05:12] we have to do it to show
[1:05:15] that we are part of the church
[1:05:18] communion is what we are talking about
[1:05:22] tonight
[1:05:26] paul said
[1:05:30] as orphaned
[1:05:34] as he drink it as often as he eat it
[1:05:39] he do remember me
[1:05:42] amen we remember what the lord has done
[1:05:46] for us
[1:05:47] he saved us he died for our sins
[1:05:52] and we need to remember it it becomes
[1:05:54] fresh in our memory
[1:05:56] it's not fresh in our heart it becomes
[1:05:59] fresh in our conscience
[1:06:02] that prevents us from going but to do
[1:06:04] the very things
[1:06:06] that he died for
[1:06:09] if we go back to those things we'll
[1:06:12] crucify him the second time
[1:06:16] that is why we need to remember him
[1:06:20] we are going to remember him tonight
[1:06:23] and i believe that we are all ready
[1:06:28] for this ordinance it's an undines it's
[1:06:31] a commandment of the lord
[1:06:34] it is not an option whether i like it i
[1:06:37] take it
[1:06:37] whether i like it i don't take it no
[1:06:41] when our lord was going he left us
[1:06:44] three commandments
[1:06:47] baptism in jesus name communion and foot
[1:06:51] washing
[1:06:53] and this communion
[1:06:56] these ordinances is
[1:07:00] an obligation paul said if you claim you
[1:07:04] are spiritual
[1:07:08] you should note all that i'm saying are
[1:07:10] the commandment of the lord
[1:07:12] and when we say something is commandment
[1:07:16] it's not an option it's something
[1:07:19] you have to do it therefore
[1:07:23] when communion table are set like we are
[1:07:26] saying today
[1:07:28] whatever our hindrances are whatever
[1:07:32] our problems are we must be ready
[1:07:36] to sacrifice them and to be part
[1:07:39] of the communion
[1:07:42] amen and amen for communion that's
[1:07:45] good things to us communion
[1:07:48] is a must
[1:07:51] amen you see there are three things that
[1:07:57] we
[1:07:57] must that we must
[1:08:01] three things that we must do as symbols
[1:08:06] the last supper feet washing
[1:08:12] and baptism
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:19] three things you cannot do one
[1:08:23] and leave the rest you have to do
[1:08:27] all the three in order
[1:08:30] to be complete and we found out here
[1:08:33] that paul wants us
[1:08:36] that we must not do it without
[1:08:38] descending the lord's
[1:08:40] body amen we should not do it without
[1:08:43] discernment
[1:08:46] we should not do it without knowing what
[1:08:48] we are doing
[1:08:49] we should not do it without believing
[1:08:51] what we are doing
[1:08:53] we have to do it by faith believing
[1:08:58] it is the commandments of god and once
[1:09:01] we do it
[1:09:03] it will do a whole lot of things in our
[1:09:05] life
[1:09:07] it will change our life it will heal us
[1:09:11] it will strengthen us
[1:09:14] all that we are not able to do we will
[1:09:17] start doing them
[1:09:19] because we've been to the presence of
[1:09:22] the lord
[1:09:26] communion
[1:09:30] in the life of a believer
[1:09:33] proof
[1:09:36] he's a winner proof
[1:09:41] he's victorious prove he has defeated
[1:09:45] the enemy and the plans of the enemy
[1:09:49] but when we run from each
[1:09:53] we are giving more room
[1:09:56] to the devil communion
[1:10:01] is more or less like a sieve
[1:10:06] that the lord has permitted in the
[1:10:08] church
[1:10:11] it is used to sieve
[1:10:15] the wrong things in the church
[1:10:18] there are people who have kept things in
[1:10:20] in their heart for years
[1:10:22] they will never put it right but
[1:10:26] when there's a communion that is when
[1:10:29] they put it right
[1:10:33] so if there's no communion we don't put
[1:10:36] this right
[1:10:38] if there's communion before we put this
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:42] that's why i say communion is deceived
[1:10:46] the scriptures say we should do it as
[1:10:47] often
[1:10:49] as we can do it and the more we do it
[1:10:52] very often
[1:10:54] the more we
[1:10:57] close every door to the devil from
[1:11:00] infiltrating into the church
[1:11:04] the more we close every door
[1:11:11] from the devil coming in
[1:11:16] and preventing the church
[1:11:19] from living a life that is not worthy of
[1:11:23] the gospel
[1:11:25] communion is very important amen
[1:11:30] and we need to do it
[1:11:34] by reference
[1:11:39] we need to reference it we need to do it
[1:11:42] with reverence
[1:11:44] we need to do it knowing what we are
[1:11:47] doing
[1:11:51] more or less in between life and death
[1:11:55] it's a challenge to every believer
[1:12:00] in time of communion
[1:12:04] many may use different excuses
[1:12:08] but i will prefer
[1:12:12] to sacrifice everything
[1:12:15] to come to a communion rather than
[1:12:18] using minor excuses
[1:12:23] knowing very well that a man is not
[1:12:26] ready
[1:12:27] he'll use a minor excuse
[1:12:32] no sir a child of god
[1:12:35] must attach important to communion
[1:12:39] communion is a feast with the lord
[1:12:46] and when it's time to feast with the
[1:12:47] lord
[1:12:49] we need to be happy we need to rejoice
[1:12:53] i remember at home if it take time that
[1:12:57] we don't take communion
[1:12:58] bernie come to me pastor it seems this
[1:13:01] long time we took communion what is
[1:13:02] wrong
[1:13:04] we want to take communion
[1:13:08] for we know what it does to us
[1:13:12] it is true that a believer taking
[1:13:15] communion
[1:13:16] it does a whole lot of things in his
[1:13:18] life
[1:13:21] which you cannot even imagine
[1:13:24] because you take the lost body into
[1:13:28] yourself
[1:13:30] not a literal body it's a symbol
[1:13:34] it's something that represents the
[1:13:35] lord's body
[1:13:38] but you take it with faith we take it
[1:13:40] with understanding
[1:13:42] you take it with the belief and that's
[1:13:45] where it works
[1:13:49] tonight we are going to take communion
[1:13:55] i believe we are prepared how many of us
[1:13:58] are prepared tonight to take the
[1:14:00] communion
[1:14:01] how many are happy tonight that we are
[1:14:03] going to die at the lost table
[1:14:06] how many of us are happy tonight because
[1:14:09] we have
[1:14:09] won victory over the enemy
[1:14:17] i will not take you so far
[1:14:20] this is just an exhortation gives us an
[1:14:23] advice
[1:14:25] to prepare ourselves for tonight's
[1:14:29] communion if there's something between
[1:14:33] you
[1:14:33] and your sister
[1:14:37] it will be advisable to call him out or
[1:14:40] to call her out and put it right
[1:14:44] put it right wait on one another
[1:14:47] carry ye for one another
[1:14:54] and get the right atmosphere
[1:14:58] the right anointing
[1:15:01] come to take it now the blessing that
[1:15:04] goes with it
[1:15:07] becomes your part

[1:17:45] pray for your brother or your sister
[1:17:48] that is at your side

[1:18:06] church
[1:18:10] asking the lord to forgive us
[1:18:14] maybe there's something in our life the
[1:18:16] holy spirit

[1:18:23] which will not make us to be qualified
[1:18:27] for communion this night

[1:19:32] and prepare us whether we do not take
[1:19:36] this communion
[1:19:40] and let it be a judgment a condemnation
[1:19:44] we should not take it and deceit
[1:19:49] if there's any sickness in our life
[1:19:54] after taking this communion
[1:19:57] it should be the end of that sickness
[1:19:59] that demon that is tormenting us

[1:20:06] so that will be made whole
[1:20:24] pressure heavenly father

[1:23:49] is my salvation
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:06] amen as our brother so beautifully
[1:24:10] spoke to us communion is a wonderful
[1:24:13] opportunity if it's approached the right
[1:24:16] way
[1:24:17] if you know you have a weakness in your
[1:24:20] life or
[1:24:21] a sin that so easily beset you
[1:24:24] and you know it's wrong and you've
[1:24:27] repented of it
[1:24:28] you can approach the table in the right
[1:24:32] spirit an atmosphere for that
[1:24:35] deliverance
[1:24:37] if you have sickness in your body and
[1:24:39] and you know
[1:24:40] that you have faith in your heart this
[1:24:43] gives you a place
[1:24:46] in my vocabulary i'd call it a place of
[1:24:48] contact
[1:24:50] something that god's provided for you as
[1:24:53] our brother
[1:24:53] said that you can get your healing you
[1:24:56] can stand for somebody else
[1:24:58] if you have a loved one and and you'd
[1:25:00] really like to see god do something in
[1:25:02] their life
[1:25:03] this is a chance to approach
[1:25:06] this table with communion service with
[1:25:10] faith and have done for you exceedingly
[1:25:13] and abundantly
[1:25:15] above that which you can even
[1:25:18] think so okay see it's so it's
[1:25:21] a wonderful opportunity that god's
[1:25:23] provided for us
[1:25:25] to meet him and and
[1:25:29] show our heart and and i know a lot of
[1:25:32] us
[1:25:32] we we war against the flesh because the
[1:25:35] flesh wars against the spirit
[1:25:38] and we want to overcome the flesh and
[1:25:40] that's what communion
[1:25:42] does it gives us an opportunity to
[1:25:44] approach god and the right spirit and
[1:25:46] say lord i need overcoming power
[1:25:48] i'm sorry for the things i've done
[1:25:50] they're in the sea of forgetful but now
[1:25:52] i want to receive
[1:25:54] from you what i need to be victorious
[1:25:58] amen let's turn in our bibles since our
[1:26:00] brother read the scriptures
[1:26:02] in corinthians let us turn to matthew
[1:26:05] the 26th chapter
[1:26:17] and
[1:26:21] and we'll just take the story here
[1:26:24] starting in the 19th verse of the 26th
[1:26:28] chapter
[1:26:34] in the 19th chapter verse of the 26th
[1:26:38] chapter of matthew matthew 26 and 19
[1:26:42] reads as follows and the disciples
[1:26:46] did as jesus had appointed them
[1:26:50] and they made ready the passover
[1:26:54] and now when he was come
[1:26:57] he sat down with the twelve
[1:27:01] and as they did eat
[1:27:04] he said verily i say unto you
[1:27:08] that one of you shall betray me
[1:27:12] and they were exceedingly sorrowful
[1:27:16] and begin every one of them to say
[1:27:20] unto him lord is it i
[1:27:24] and he answered and said he that
[1:27:28] dippeth his hand with me
[1:27:31] in the dish the same shall betray me
[1:27:36] the son of man goeth as it is written
[1:27:39] of him but woe unto that
[1:27:43] man by whom the son of man
[1:27:46] is betrayed it had been
[1:27:49] good for that man if he had
[1:27:53] not been born
[1:27:56] then judas which betrayed him
[1:27:59] answered and said master
[1:28:03] is it i and he said unto him
[1:28:07] thou has said
[1:28:10] and as they were eating jesus
[1:28:14] took bread and blessed it and break it
[1:28:18] and gave it to the disciples and said
[1:28:21] take eat this is my body
[1:28:24] and he took the cup and gave thanks
[1:28:28] and gave it to them saying drink ye
[1:28:31] all of it for this is my blood
[1:28:35] of the new testament which is shed for
[1:28:38] many
[1:28:39] for the remission of sins but i say unto
[1:28:42] you i will not
[1:28:43] drink henceforth
[1:28:46] of this fruit of the vine until
[1:28:49] that day which i drink it new
[1:28:53] with you in my father's house
[1:28:57] that's the communion service i'm looking
[1:28:59] forward to

[1:30:45] the charge of our sins and the
[1:30:48] punishment
[1:30:49] and the chastisement of our sins
[1:30:52] would not be laid upon us but he took
