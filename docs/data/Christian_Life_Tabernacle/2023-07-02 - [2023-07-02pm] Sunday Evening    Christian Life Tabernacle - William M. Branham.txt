Description:
Sunday Evening 
July 9, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

I love you right now amen amen father May that become our rest that we know that you're in control that our footsteps are ordered by you and no circumstance can pile up against us that you can't control we just ask you to bless us this evening in our time of Fellowship in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles let's just turned to a real scripture that I'm sure that we all know in the gospel of Matthew the 16th chapter and the 15th verse and uh we certainly enjoy that thank you musicians and singing and all those wonderful things it says in this scripture in the 15th birth and we know and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it father we ask you to bless your word and your precious name we pray amen Lord bless you the importance of Revelation our messenger told us he says I cannot emphasize to you enough the importance of Revelation and we notice how each of the people before when they asked they had filtered it through a lot of their own ideas one say you're this one say you're that he says but who do you say I am and then he filtered it through the word of God and he got the answer amen after this morning's message I thought it would be appropriate to play the messenger and so we're going to play a portion out of the message thinking man's filter and from paragraphs 103 through 188 and I just highlighted a few little statements I'd like to read them before that we hear them and then when you hear them again maybe they'll be a a twice but he makes this one statement uh I I thought was pretty good just to express back about how the thinking and Filter Works he says I come out of a meeting here there was a little Ricky standing back here behind the church one night and he said to me about three or four years ago he said the reason you say that you're an old man said I think they look nice and I said I can imagine that for just the looks of him you can tell what he looked like and I said tell me something how old are you he said I'm 30 years old he said when I was 15 years younger than you I thought the same thing right it's and it's still felt a thinking man's filter notice if he had been his mind filtered through the word of God God's filter he wouldn't look upon her he wouldn't think she's pretty he'll think she's a jezebel he'll think behind those red lips is poison fangs that would sting him and the Bible said her Gates is the gates of the hell and a man that walketh in them walketh like an ox going to the slaughter there's a thinking man's filter amen so we certainly see these things I'd like to make another statement here and it's it's a paragraph of 109 he says a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of God my sheer sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow for down in there is life and life connects with life because we're he's going to build to something and he says sin connects with sin and sin is so hypocritical until it thinks that it's saved when it isn't saved and it's the very depths of hypocrisy church members want a denominational filter so that they can have their own desire and still be classed religious people you hear them say oh he's very religious amen that's this another quote here found on paragraph 121 he said but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in you there that began to draw I want us to think on this part about something in you drawing he said you didn't put that there God did something in in you begin to draw if you know it it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word then you took the church you took their ideas when you was told better you never used the think immense filter but when you use God's filter which is a thinking man's filter because all other filters will pass away but mine shall not and when you take God's filter you draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter a think immense filter there is nothing left but the holy God amen isn't that wonderful hey man let's just read another statement here and it says let me plant this is paragraph 147. let me plant the word of God in my heart and purpose there that I'll not turn to the right hand or to the left hand away from it but I'll live true to it all the days of my life and oh Father God then send down upon me the Holy Spirit of life to Quicken those words to me that I might manifest Jesus Christ before those who are before me to look for it to happen that's my prayer what a beautiful statement just Mark that down he says he says I said this this morning paragraph 157 or 56. I said this this morning we're in the seeing age the top there's no more facilities above that that you can move upwardly to know you from your nose you can smell your lips you can speak from your hands you can feel and reach and your feet and so forth but you can't go no further than your eyes Malachi 4 has come sight it shall be light about the evening time oh walk in the light amen amen I believe our brother alluded to that paragraph 163. he says now let us all tonight check our desires and then you can see what kind of filter you've been drawing through let's check each one of us here and out Across the Nation check your desires what you want really in life check what you're fighting for check what you're here for check what what you go to church for what makes you it's good to go to church but just don't go to church only that won't save you see just check just a few minutes say is my is my objective what kind of filter am I drawing through anyhow amen and then this is the statement I really want to emphasize as we listen to this uh for it's 41 minutes long I'm sure you can stay uh attentive for that it says this is paragraph one um 80 I believe or 181 it says the word if you are predestinated you see it there's no way to hide it from you you look there and say why it's just so plain before my face I look at it and there it is I'm looking right at it I see it here it is the word every word just word by word living out there's a a taste of eternal life that you want and when you breathe through that then can come through and and then can come through that God's filter nothing but the spirit no world at all no one belief at all it's God's filter and when you breathe through that nothing can get through that but the Holy Ghost now you've got the evidence of the Holy Ghost see a holy man or woman's taste they want to live they got eternal life and because this word is quickened to them they live a thinking man's filter a holy man's taste amen you know that's probably the biggest question you get how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost if there's something that draws through you amen because something that you just see it right you just can't deny it it's right before your face you just can't get away from it there it is and you draw that word he said that's the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost amen so Lord richly bless you as we listen to this 41 minutes I believe it's inspirational I believe it's just necessary and uh especially after what our brother said about saying only what he said I think the best way to say only what he said is to hear him say themself amen the Lord Mercy bless you as we listen in this portion of this message thinking men's filter father bless your word Jesus name we pray amen oh so now we want to look at Ephesians 5 26 that it is the washing of the Water by the word a Waters of separation what does it do then the filter of God is the word Waters of Separation washing other waters of Separation by the word God's filter then you can't come into Christ through a church Builder you cannot come by the nominational filter or a Creed filter there's only one filter that you can enter into that Holy place that's to the washing of the water follower the word of God is a thinking man's filter the church WIll judge you here whether you're a good name or not they'll give you a good feeling half past the flag at your death same great wreaths of flowers and do everything for you but when it comes down to your soul facing God it's got to have eternal life if it's an eternal life it's part of the word and it's my own word cannot be on my own hand cannot deny my hand my own eyes cannot deny my hand out of my foot or my Tor any part of me they cannot lie and either can a man that's part of the word of God or a woman then I have one part of the word of God then remember when you think you can have Bob Harry come in the presence of God you're wrong that's it you're wrong you can't come through God's silver or you're Washed by the Water of the word then you enter you to the fellowship You Think You Are but you can't be until you come through the word and every little spot every little word of God man shall not live by better owned by every word it's got to come through that filtration coming through and that gives a righteous man's taste because that's what he's looking for looking for something to cleanse him the word the word of God is a faking Man's children and it makes a righteous man's taste we know that truth filters all the sin of unbelief out there's a little more disbelief when he comes through the filter because it is the true believer's taste the True Believer wants to be right regardless you just don't want to stay alive on the social ranks I'll belong to church the biggest church in town I don't care if it's a mission on the corner if it's a brush Harbor somewhere a thinking man knows that he's got to meet God in regards to what the church says or anybody else says he's got to come on God's terms and God's terms is God's word well they say God's word sure I don't believe it's God's word but can you filter through it I go let a bob-headed woman come through there see it ain't a thanking man's taste no thanking me I don't think I think you now think twice before he jumps into something like that notice that word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there all that the father has given he will come to me there is an idiom going to be lost a faking man's taste when a thinking man Hears A word of God my sheep sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow or down in there is life and life connects with life still connects with sin and sin is so happy hypocritical until it thinks that it's saved when it is insane it's in the very depths of hypocrisy church members wanted a nomination filter so that they could have their own desire and still be class religious people you're always very religious in Africa was out there one day is talking about these some of the kids that's talking about these rock and roll songs that Elvis Presley and they were singing Pat Boone and whatever more Ricky Nelson and all them others I said there are a bunch of Renegades some little girl said well he's very religious I said so was Judas I said Judas only got 30 pieces of silver Elvis Presley got several million dollars they're both sold out their Birthright I said there's enough of the very important statement the nation's gone still just as deceiving as the filter of the cigarette these denominations that those members come in they ought to even be a lord be a law that they couldn't sing religious songs it's against or to be against the law for them to do it but the whole thing's become one great big pile of hypocrisy that's where they stay today the true film for the soul says if you love the world are the things of the world the love of God's not even in you see you can't you can't say rock and rollers of the world as of the god rock and rollers of the world any of those dances that filtered nasty filthy things rather is of the world it's all over the world you can't say that Bob's hair for a woman is a God the Bible says it's not so it's a bill to the world and if you love one Speck of the world the love of God's not even in you see what's that law what's wrong is something down on the inside drawing the soul is drawing your resource to the outside down through the spirit into the soul if the soul loves the world is dead I don't care how it's anointed it is out yet how righteous it is out here down in here it's dead or he that loves the world are the things of the world the love of God's not even any no matter how religion the true filter that we will will set all those things out and bring nothing but the trueness of God the word into the real true soul they're like Esau outwardly okay ESO was religious on the outside and when it comes to religion it seem to be more religious than Jacob was you see to be a better man than Jacob was but the inside of him what he was is outwardly religious but his thinking was not feeling he doesn't think right of the birthright he didn't think that God's a Birthright meant as much as God said it did see I'll go to church I'm just as good as you are my denomination just says what's one of the greatest in the world my mother volunteer my father brought to it all this that the other my pastor was educated he's got sourceful that touching that much farther from God that ain't no thinking means filter if it would how could Peter ever been what he was but he attacked the thinking man's filter notice all mine Esau thought that that Birch art didn't mean what God said it did that was the difference between life and death and so like Eve and like Judas sold their birthrights for a satisfaction of the taste of the knowledge of civilization that's exactly what Eve sold her birthrights for she sold it for a little taste of science a little taste of worldly knowledge a little better church a little better glass of people today it would be called see and Judas sold his birthrights for 30 pieces of silver to make a few extra dollars my congregation can pay me better over here and I'll just preach over here see sold out if I become a preacher well they said brother Graham We believe that message is the truth but we can't accept it if we did well where would we preach at the word brother that's the parish thoroughly well I'm none of the brothers in the back yeah but I'm looking for another brother to back me up I'm looking for Jesus Christ to back me up because he stood by him he's the one who said it and when the true Birthright the blood fill it out by the word all sin and the world and church and denominations and sectarianism is left outside education civilization church denomination system sin of all types is left outside when a thinking man takes a thinking man's filter and God's estimation there's nothing left in it when a man draws his wrists life to a God's filter notice here your life is all messed up as sin because you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking eyes I'm going to say something that's done McCullough used to say listen to me when you come in this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lives within your own spirit the desire of sin a Lover's sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that began to draw if you know it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and he read his word and you took the church you took the ideas when you're told better then you'd ever use the thinking man's filter God's filter which is the thinking man's filter because all other filters will pop but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires to God's filter a thanking them filter there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost now if you aren't the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is when that Soul if you're of the line with the word of God in every respect amen shows you draw your life through the thinking man's filter God filter notice is that God's filter he said we was Washed by the Water of the word and when God gave Adam and Eve a filter in the Garden of Eden he said don't you draw now this in there but Satan punched a hole in and say oh it's a little bit won't hurt just one drop too it's all it took to step death into the human race that's all it takes just one Taste of nicotine then they're gone there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost and then that shows that in you were that predestinated seed down in you that makes you hunger for God all the father has given he has given me to redeem they died with me at Calvary the Rays of thee in the resurrection all that he has given me will come to me they'll be tracing the body where foot arm nose mouth whatever it is they'll be placed in there and they will come to me in their season oh my There Is that real filtration of all the sin of the world and the love of the world is dead and the soul is drawing only one thing don't forget it oh you out there on the telephone set this down in your mind when a thinking man begins to think who he's going to stand before and what the word of God is what he begins to think then when he draws do that there's nothing can't get to it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning studying her drawing the sea life the seed is in Your Heart by Florida Nation Hallelujah the seed is already in there by the foreknowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word and then it's the taste of the cake it's a righteous man the holy man who sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever what comes into that place down there that word that's in the heart of hid that word in my heart that are sitting out against thee what is it what is drawing through the word there's only one thing to pass through the word what's the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that can pass through the word is the Holy Ghost and a thinking man's filter is a holy man a taste then he's tasted of the Heavenly pain he's got the word of God in his heart he sees it manifested before it and his whole Souls wrapped into it and the world and all things that stand around a thinking man's filter of religion I'm thinking of filtering religion now what a thinking man's filter gives a holy man's taste I think it satisfies his taste he sees that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there it is seen right before doing the same things he did it satisfies the holy man's taste his thinking he knows then it is past and death and alive and he loves and and loves for the world to be confirmed and what's the word to be confirmed and Vindicated in each age he waits for it for he is a holy man and he's got a desire to see God others just wants to join church this man wants to see God he don't see him in a bunch of Creeds he don't see any big fine pipe organs or Cathedrals and high crosses or polished up Scholars for their Scholars turn around he doesn't see him in theology on a theologian he sees him in the confirmation of his word of the Lord is typing out the Finish where The Grapes of Wrath are stored these loose of faithful lightning with his terrible Swift sword his truth keeps marching on it will to them yes sir see what I mean a filter man a thinking man's filter a man that wants to stand in the presence of God what was God's filter his word that day you either of that day you die don't care what's happening out here don't you pass that word washed By the Waters of the word a thinking man's filter not a denomination not a Creed not a church not a cathedral but a thanking man filter for you're going to be judged by the word uh thank you man I'll think that a foolish man or a taste of the world will just take anything a substitute why substitute when there's a real one think just think of him a woman speaking in tongues with bobbed hair and lipstick on and then the church still holds to it and that's the evidence the Holy Ghost honor a preacher from a seminary or some Bible School using the trinitarian baptism or compromising with the words of some Creator denomination is that a thinking man's filter not the way I see it brother it's a foolish man going through that right could you imagine that instead of using God's word as a filter for his soul letting it all Creed and denomination piling on top of him like that instead of taking God's word for a filter and then he's all contaminated and let him induce into him doctrines of man doing things almost deceiving the very elected and neglecting the word when he could draw to his own soul if there's anything in there to draw a Bible but if that predestinated seed don't miss this if that predestinated seed is not in there it will not draw through there because it'll draw for its desire if a smoking man wants a smoky man's taste and if you've got to hold a stick I say suck your finger and he stood there stuck in his finger well he said that's silly why his taste is for nicotine so he's not a thinking man see but he said I don't I don't taste nothing and I won't taste the word I want to taste tobacco I don't taste the vein give him a toast and let him suck on that sure they suck on that he said I don't taste nothing what you sucking on it for then you've got to desire to taste nicotine and when you're sucking on a church Creed and still you women wear bobbed hair painted faces and this sexy dress and you man look at them and all these other things to carry on the way you do what is it what's in there the world's still in there and you're gonna taste you're pulling on it for a taste I go to this church you don't ever name that thing you don't say nothing about this nothing about that now these things are brought up our preacher's more wide-minded than that we don't say things like that what is it you've got the taste of the world you're sucking for eign and the only thing that you can draw through God's word is the spirit the quickening power to make the word itself which is in you live to manifest Jesus Christ in the age you're living oh my god brother if that ain't the truth I don't know what the truth is I've lost my mind if that isn't the truth it is the word itself in your heart prejestinated there that's drawing and it spits out that word that don't want it but when it gets over here in the world it begins to crawl and when it draws to the word it can be nothing else then a thinking religious man's filter is a word and it satisfies that Holy case that's in his heart a thinking man's filter a holy man's taste oh man what we're into instead of using God's filter for his soul he's letting Satan deceive him but some denominational Creed just as Zachary the tobacco companies are deceiving you people smoke cigarettes you just get more members and that's all or let me close in a few minutes saying this how blind can we get the leading the blind at this age under false pretense under false Creeds under Douglas's pulse under denominations false under Creed books is false oh blind ledorcia leading the ground you're all headed for the ditch change your filter tonight preacher don't draw that denominational nicotine into your system up dogmas it creates which Jesus said whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it when you tell your congregations right then women to do that those men did it and all these things that and the other as long as they stay true to this and do that and keep these Creeds and things aren't you ashamed of yourself blind Pharisees Jesus said Jesus cried blind Pharisees the Holy Spirit my own hearts and I cross how else God would it give you a Revival but now your time has come it's too late now how did you laugh and make fun of the people that God sent to you but now

Saint hundred or maybe 40 miles down into that great fall out the under one of these days and ways will shoot plan out to the state of Kentucky and what it does it'll shake the world so hard that everything on top of it will shake down oh I mean a Rock of Ages God let me let me breathe upon me Lord spirit all the Living God Breathe on Me Let Me Take God's filter and live under that Lord let me breathe the fresh air of the Holy Ghost into my lungs and my soul each day that I sin not against You O Lord Breathe on Me Holy Spirit breathe on me oh let me plant the word of God in my heart and purpose there that I'll not turn to the right hand or to the left hand away from it or I'll live true to it all the days of my life oh Father God then sent down upon me the Holy Spirit of life to Quicken those words to me that I might manifest Jesus Christ before those who are before me to looking for it to happen that's my prayer oh man knows how they do today in those churches sucking their people to those denominational pillars Into The ecumenical council why why for it gives them the desire of their heart organization they have a taste for organization they'll do it every time God sent him a Revival therefore they do they organize it is that right so they got their kind of filter because they've got a great taste and now God's going to give them their desire of their taste he's going to give them they're sucking them right into the ecumenical council and then they get the organizational taste there they got it coming old church of lady acia don't be deceived in this age by their deceptions all painted calls you've gone into Lydia you were part of legosia the church dead through Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian just a ritualistic form but you're Pentecostals who could still once in a while Say Amen who can pull a lot of music up on a platform and have Bob had women dancing all the place I still do believe in Divine Healing how off God would have took you but you took another filter a denominational filter how off God would have took you how deceiving it was Matthew 24 24 Jesus said that the it would deceive the very elected if it was possible how close did you are it looks like Eve just leaving off one or two little things that you couldn't receive because you're organized and can't receive it that's all it takes this might as well take the whole thing or to offend in the Middle East is guilty of a whole oh did it costs Pentecost pass thou thinking to God's filter not your denominational dreams and you will come out with a holy man's taste the true baptism of the Holy Spirit could you imagine a man letting his wife cut her hair wear shorts or wear slacks and say he's coming through a thinking man's filter could you imagine a man doing a thing like that can you imagine a preacher standing In a Pulpit because he's paid good by our congregation and a peps him on the back calls him Dr brother Reverend takes him out to all kinds of parties where you mix bathing and everything else on the beaches could you imagine a man claiming he's coming to a thinking man's filter and some of those women on a platform with their dresses above their knees and cuts the Titan shows every Farm every move they make in their underneath clothes showing through their dresses just as bad as wearing shorts bikinis or anything else you Pentecostal Blind Lady of sin preachers how long will God suffer you out babe God be merciful to yours to your blind eyes he's got I saved and I have to open your eyes that you might see as I said this morning we're in the seeing age the top there's no more faculties above that that you can move outwardly to know you primers those you can smell from your lips you can speak from your hands you can feel and reaching your feet and so forth but you can't go farther than your eyes Malachi 4 has come thanks it shall be light about the eating time oh walk in the light we'll walk in the light a beautiful life that comes for the dewdrops of Mercy Albright shine All Around Me by day in the night Jesus the word the light of the world Listen pass through it O Brother and you will come out uh with a holy man's taste with the Holy Ghost old woman just pass your modern thinking of dress as your modern thinking before you got on the street before me and you young women your women before you go out on the street where you're close to tight pushed out in the back in front I'm not critical I'm your brother I stand between the living and the dead and realize what I'm seeing before you enter out and know that your body is a sacred order a sacred task that God has given you before you enter the street dress like that pass your mind through a thinking woman's filter and let it remember that whosoever looks upon you tell us that you you have committed adultery with him already remember that sister and brother before you turn your head to look at her on that Second Glance pass your mind through a thinking man's filter you'll come out with a holy man's taste of doing what's wrong notice if you pass your mind through a thinking woman's filter you'll come out with a holy woman's dress that's right you'll come out brother with a holy man's look now that's just one thing everything that you do pass it through the filter of God's word see if it's right or wrong you'll come out with a holy woman's dress with long hair decently dressed or quite humble Spirit not up brawling and fighting the carnal a quiet meat Spirit which is a great treasure from God the Bible said so now I want to ask you something out in the lands or close a few minutes now let us all tonight check our desires and then you can see what kind of a filter you've been drawing through let's check each one of us here and out Across the Nation check your desires what you want really in life check what you're fighting for check what you're here for check what you go to church Barn what makes you it was good to go to church but just don't go to church only that won't save you okay this check just a few minutes say is my objective what what kind of filter am I drawing to anyhow and if you all cope with the word of God and your soul don't do it then there's something wrong for it shows up your taste that's a lie what kind of a life is in you if it's a holy discreet honorable it'll come out that way if it isn't you've got another taste in you you're drawing from the Zachariah if the taste is the word of God in the will of God then you know what's in you what's drawing The Taste shows you are a part of that word that word is in you drawing from the word what's the drawing it's drawing to the word because you are a part of the body of Christ of this age and if that word is in you it can only draw through the word the spirit that quickens that word that's in you this the word alone won't live that's the reason all the father has given me will come to me and if I be lifted up I'll draw all man unto me see see the Father the part of the body of Christ that's in the world predestinated put it into the hearts any man that's a real Christian born again it ain't no sense he was a little kid a little girl either that there is something in you that hungered for God and you tried joining churches and everything else it wouldn't work why was it it was that word you was hunting for a filter and one day it passed before you you seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever that satisfied the taste so life was in you drawing see the life in you strong yes tell what does all you got here you're you're pulling you can't pull through this or that and the other you've got to find that right killer cause you're a thinking person if you're a thinking person you are predestinated or filtered for from the for the foundation of the world and if a denominational Minister hears this I hope that he takes the thinking man's filter if he's a denomination minister then he'll throw down that denominational Pact that's sure to perish because it's a word of man and except God's filtered word that can never fail or pass away and it will suit the holy man's taste and like Jacob will sacrifice all the world and the appetites of ever denomination or fame that there is in the world where you can be Bishop Cardinal or you could be a state prisoner or a pastor of some great church you'll sacrifice everything that there is not like Esau to become part of the world but like Jacob you'll give everything you've got to obtain the birthright the filtered of the thinking man calls it'll give you the holy man's taste and it will satisfy and to be satisfying we'll sanctify with the Eternal Taste of the Holy goodness of God remember Satan punched the first hole through ease mind or her thinking to let the taste of his wisdom and knowledge get through now think of this I'm closing Satan punched the first hole through because all she could draw was the word that was a spirit through the word of God because she said as long as you breathe through this filter you'll never die but you take a breath of this I hear it you'll die see and Satan said but you don't know nothing here but you take a little taste of this year and then you'll know you'll be like God see he knows right wrong you don't and if you just take a little taste of this and she let him punch a hole in it just one little hole now you see why I say why don't you teach women and so forth how to receive gifts and things like that I said how can you teach him algebra when they won't even learn their ABCs one little hole all the time he took the world's wisdom and when it did it set death to the whole family wanting to taste of wisdom now look at the filter and certainly it expressed her taste her taste was for the world that's what she's got that's what it is today they loved the world and the things of the world was a form of godliness but denying the power there see Satan speak of tongues he let him shout he'll have had Divine Healing service he led you all these kind of things they say many will come to me that day Lord and our cast out Devils have not done many things done this you say I didn't even know you you worker of iniquity when the word was placed right before you and you still sucked that old filter out of the world they chose a taste that was in the heart doves cannot eat a Karen they cannot eat it they don't have any gall a crow can eat the seed like a dove and he can either carrying like a crow see because he's a hypocrite but a dove is not built like any other Bird that's why God represents himself as a dove descending from Heaven see it cannot it cannot stand to stink of a Karen it's not a vulture the reason they don't have any Gall it couldn't digest it would kill it if it eat it and a dove never has to take a bath a Dove's body puts out oil from the inside that keeps it clean It's A Life That's ended up it generates in it or oil that keeps the feathers clean and so is a Christian there's a life within them that keeps them clean it's filtered oh notice now look at either at the filter and certainly you can see the taste thereof of what they're doing today look at this modern Church look at the filter you see what they love which is headed for God's judgment that's right the love the church throughout today is for radio Sia a great organization a great setup a great proper thing foreign dress people highly cultured full of wisdom full of devil under the deceit of the Church of Christ there's only one word ought to be in their Antichrist or everything you Christ talk they're against practically everything just enough so they can call themselves that now if you are a thinking people tonight here in out in the land where the message is going your desire will be a Bible taste not a denominational taste or you will be judged by the very Bible the word that I'm asking you to filter your soul through and to reject one word of it and not let your soul pass through that one word you'll be turned down for a man shall not live breathe by our bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it will be brought into you predestinated and when the Lord breathes upon you his spirit will Quicken that word to a reality and you'll see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh man leave the world's denomination religious pact let it lay look at cigarette pack in the woods let it rot in the key it's it's a wrong filter and take the word which is Christ that gives and reaches and preserves the taste of eternal life to everyone that will take it eternal life the word if you're predestinated you sit there's no way to hide it from you you look there and say watch this playing before my face I look at it there it is I'm looking right at it I see it here it is the word every word just word by word living out then there's a taste of eternal life that you want and when you breathe through that what can come through that God's filter nothing but the spirit at all it's God's filter and when you breathe through that nothing can get through that but the Holy Ghost now you got the evidence of the Holy Ghost see they are holy man or woman's taste they want to live they got eternal life and because this word's quickened to them they live are thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste don't take the world like them cigarette companies under a deception but take the real thinking man's filter filter the breath that you breathe the food that you eat everything that you are breathe it through God's word and you'll have a holy man's taste for it will produce that for he's the same yesterday today and forever and I know whether we are whether we are not I believe that we are but if we are not there's somebody in the world the day that's part of the body of Christ and it will live only by the word of God every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God for this age that we're living in now and I can't see where denomination of those words so plainly in the Bible say it would happen and the things that would be in here we are living right in it now I can't see where it could be anything else it is church I realize I've got to stand with you in the Judgment someday or be it for me never tell you anything wrong for popularity I don't want that if I had my desire I'd just my human desire to take my rifle and go to the woods and build me a cabin and trap the rest of my life I'm getting old tired weary and broke down but I can't quit there's something in me grinding whoa unto me if I don't tell the truth and the whole truth wow to me if I don't stand here for the last breath of bodies left me I must have regardless of what anyone else says I'm responsible for God and I truly believe that the things that we're preaching is the truth not because it's me preaching it no my brother no sir God knows my heart I would like to sit out in the congregation and listen to the anointed priest how much easier it would be on me certainly because I'd have eternal life is seen as the man in the pulpit I'm a part of it is same as he is I go with the same heaven have the same privileges how easy it would be for me to sit out there and not take all these bruises and beats and carry on how easy it would be throughout the all night with no sleep an hour and a half or two hours wrestling all night with things that's coming how easy for me to do that take up my gun the next morning my fishing rod and go fishing or honey how easy would be brother it fell my lot God help me to never shun my post to duty but to stand loyal and true and produce to you a thinking man's filter that'll give you a holy man's taste the thinking man filler is the waters other waters of Separation it's the purification from sin which is the word of God and the thinking man the man that always has got to stand before God knows he's got to answer for every word of the Bible it'll satisfy that taste that's in your heart may God help us to receive it as we bow our hands and that wonderful amen I I hope it does cause us to think you know so many things brother random said in there you know and there's little nuggets and little things like you know he said a woman not having her knees covered when she you know sitting here your knees should be covered standing and sitting they just slowly washed away all those things clothes so tight you can see the underneath garments all those things just they just drop them and drop them and drop them and drop them and drop them but yet every single one of them is important all the word of God's important so I really trust in and hope it's a blessing I love the prophet of God how he made his commitment he said be easier not to be here and that's true after my little dinky part of it just think he's talking to a whole world you know I've got people that believe the message he was just bringing it for the first time what a soldier what a courageous man what a true lover of God's word I just really think it's wonderful amen I think our pool's ready now is our pool ready and his sister hope ready is she here their sheets over there she's ready Brother Paul's ready I'm ready we'll turn the service over to brother Billy and brother Paul let us go prepare for baptism and we'll baptize our sister Lord Richard say bless you tonight brother Billy

God manifest foreign Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what

you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall fall and with many other words then they testify and his daughter saying save yourselves from this up
