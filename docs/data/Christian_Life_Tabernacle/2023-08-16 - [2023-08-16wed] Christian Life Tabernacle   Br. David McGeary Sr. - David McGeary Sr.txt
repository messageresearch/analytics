Description:
Christian Life Tabernacle 
August 16, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

my friends [Music] [Applause] [Music] in my savior [Music] amen let's bow our heads and pray father when I heard your messenger say that all of that God was he poured into Christ and all what Christ was he poured into the church father I heard that again and I thought oh I need to know that I need to understand that I need to have a greater revelation and father that's why we're here tonight that we might come to a greater realization of what that you have in mind for your children Lord we ask that you would bless us this evening and be with us in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated just a moment this evening and I don't know if if Joseph and grace are here are you in here no yes no I guess they're not here as well anyway they're probably getting ready to get married and which is certainly uh an all right thing to do but I I just I I wanted just to say a few things about Grace and Joseph is a really fine brother I don't know him well but I I really watch grace through life and she's always been such a a shining the light you know somebody that you could just trust and know wherever she was out or wherever she was she was just living and shining the gospel of the Lord and and so she'll be leaving us of course you know her husband will take her away and and so I mean this will be the second grace that I've lost and but I know we're getting a Grace so the Lord's good but so I just want to let you know don't name your girl's Grace no I haven't had anything but anyway uh I just wanted to say I'm just really happy for him and and everything so um uh there's a a kind of a reason on my heart tonight that I want to share with you before we open the scriptures and and uh just to kind of tell you um what's on my heart and the direction that I'm going in and what that I sensing and and you may be going through this too but um I just don't think that we can just survive uh letting Satan beat on us all the time you know what I mean um and uh just you know where all you see is the times getting worse and the world falling apart and and uh and everything just gets so Dreadful and and and you just can't uh stand it um and and there's a a great uh his Spirit of hopelessness and if you can make people feel hopeless they will look for something that they can rely on right that's just how man is the prophet of God said if you get a person hungry enough they'll eat out of a garbage can and I thank the Lord I've never been that hungry but I have been hungry before but there's there's just you know we just can't uh let Satan's Army uh just keep bringing because this is what he brings he brings uh he brings destruction I think that's what the prophet of God describes in the message the greatest battle ever fought he says that Satan's Army brings destructness sickness death and he just battles your mind all the time and so I I just see people and and and this continuous oppression that putting on not only us as Believers you think we've got it bad because there's 200 000 demon demons loosed on us you know but you just look at the world too I mean without hope they just have this continuous uh bombardment and so I on my heart I I just uh have just been thinking in My Heart Lord what is our answer to these things and it brought me to this message that I I want to just minister to you tonight out of in and read a few quotes to and and hope it'll lift your heart this evening so I just want to share a little bit out of this message that's called works is Faith expressed and I begin to see something in there like I've never seen before um and I thought well this seems like a type of message that would have been maybe preached earlier in brother branham's Ministry but it was preached in November of 65. and many of us who look at the message and and hear statements that brother Branham made brother Brandon made a statement he says a man knows when God's fixing to call him home he's got that sense I um thankfully I have an experience that yet but someday I will if the Lord tarries and if it's not for death I will experience for the rapture but so I think that towards the end of his ministry there's a whole series of messages he starts to give especially in 1965. now let there be no mistake I believe all the messages the word of God and just a valuable from 1940 to 1965. I I don't believe that the message changed any I know it moved into a different pull but everything was perfectly laid out by God every aspect of it every reason he only gave us what we could eat he nursed us like babies he gave us milk through the first poll and the second poll and then finally when it came time he started laying up meat he didn't feed us all the meat he stored it up for us amen he had the vision store it up and so there's a great Storehouse of uh of things that are stored up so this message took on the new significance to me simply because of the of where it's placed in the sermons and I began to realize there's something in this message that he's trying to get across to his church and and there's something in my heart that's burning and this begins to make contact with that so let us open our Bibles and let's stand and and I just want to read a couple's scriptures um there's so many scriptures that we could read but I want to read out of Hebrews the sixth chapter and and he makes this statement and um sometimes it's good when you sit down to read like The Book of Hebrews that you read it from beginning to end as one letter you know and we always have a tendency to break out chapters but if you kind of get a theme then you can understand what he's what he's pointing to here in chapter six he jumps over into chapter 11. and picks it up after he covers some things in between but he picks it up what the Perfection is he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundations of repentance from dead works and Faith towards God of the doctrines of baptism of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God so permit so they want to turn there and then I also want to turn over to James which is just the next book after uh Hebrews and I just want to read one scripture there the 17th and 18th verse it said even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone so we we don't want our faith to be alone and he says yea a man may say doubt hath faith and I have works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated I I like what the Paul says here and it yeah and James says that it certainly could be misunderstood and misdirected and I'm certainly I don't want to go into the all the aspects of dividing them scriptures but I I've come to the place where I just don't want to keep hashing over what I believe you know what I mean I mean I I could preach a sermon tonight about you being the bride and the the son of man Ministry and how deity came in flesh in our day and dwelt in the prophet of God and how he was totally Vindicated and how the seals were open and the Word was broken to us and and and how that were elected and and how that were were chosen and how our names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life and we could go over all that uh once again and I would think looking out here this evening that you all believe that I mean every head will nod everybody loves to hear that they're eternally secure everybody loves to know that uh that I'm in his hands and everything's good and uh and Paul talks about a Perfection that goes on past that and in my heart I I I'm just so Desiring that uh that my that what what did he have in mind when he spoke in Ephesians and he says we are his workmanship in Christ Jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them and we we talked about the the word of God how that uh uh as we look about our election and we know we're elected and we know we're chosen if can you imagine that all that is been spoken to us for a reason God has a reason for everything that he does he had a reason for every sermon that he had his messenger preach he had a reason why that he put them in the order that he put them in he he there was something that he was trying to tell us and and he was delivering to us a message Nick it wasn't a book of theology it wasn't uh it wasn't just straightening out everybody and giving us his interpretation of the message because this is a love letter to you if it's something that he's trying to uh uh get to you or get across to you or deliver to you so what the the message isn't just given to remain intellectual it's not given just to be discussed though I love discussing it but it's given because it possesses a substance that can be possessed there's something that he's preaching that the church world doesn't know that you didn't know and I didn't know and and just to say this humbly when I recognize that the prophet of God was a prophet that he had a message when I read Christ The Mystery of God revealed and then I saw that deity standing there in that Ministry of the son of man that didn't mean that I knew all that he was trying to get to me so it wasn't I've got the revelation or belief and now I've I have all that God's done God sent a prophet I believe that he opened the seals I believe that he was a seventh Church age messenger uh I believe that and and so there there's there's there's something that's talked about that the believer can establish that and then move on from that into a perfection and that's what strikes me we talk about the chief offering and the first fruit and how he was ripened but whatever a life that it was that came up through this stock that came up through these Church ages that came up that came into him and and that he possessed because he went through the polls he uh I know this I hope I can say this in a way that isn't offensive in any way but but he grew as he went along uh well I might use this statement to help explain it better if and this is in this message works is faith expressed paragraph 99 he says well that's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong see you've got to learn and you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means so you you've got to learn you've got to grow in to uh the acceptance of what it is that God is trying to do and so a lot of times we talk about faith and you know and we say things like this we allow sometimes we'll say this guy didn't have enough Faith this guy didn't do this and this and there's a reason there for that there's a reason for it so sometimes he said it's unconfessed sin so much other things but so there's there's something that's lying out there and I don't want to sit back and try to explain what it is or what that I think it is okay I just want to say I believe there's something greater for us and not to put it in the form of a Revival not could put it in a move of some movement but there's something that God has got for each of us individuals a Perfection of maturity something that we're learning and moving into because we can't sit in this state of being a punching bag for the devil you know what I mean I mean in other words we we've got to to finally come to the the place wait a minute he didn't put me here for this he had a purpose he had something he wanted to express and again so we begin to uh even look at the basic a description of Malachi 4 5. and that it was that God was going to send us Elijah the prophet to restore back to us the faith that our fathers had so there was there was a revelation that he was trying to get across to us and that uh that was to to grow in us as believers and so I think that we know that without faith it's impossible to please God and we read this scripture I believe it was in Hebrews I think it may I forget exactly what verse that it was but we spoke about Enoch and he said by by faith Enoch was translated now every time that God does anything he's got to do it the same way so he's got to translate this church by faith also could you understand he can't he can't do Enoch one way and somebody else one way that's why we know as a believer that if anybody approaches God on the same terms that anybody else approached him on then God has to respond the same way Elsie responded wrong the first time that's why it's so important to read your Bible about those stories of Faith how that they approach God what took place in their life and when that you can grasp a hold of those things then you can learn some of us just don't learn you know and and I don't need to give you the definition of insanity but uh so there there's just something that uh that there's a substance out there and I'm I'm striving for this along with you Paul makes a statement in the scriptures he says I'm not saying as if I have obtained you know what I mean but uh if if God's moving and he can speak to us I believe that that we could move together that we can grow together I don't believe in nickelodeonism where the minister sets himself up above the people like I I've obtained all these great things and you poor pathetic people you better listen to my great Fountain of wisdom you know what I mean I I believe that when we sit down to a meal we all eat together we say grace together you know what I mean and remember the guy that's doing all the Talking at a dinner table doesn't get very much food I would rather just dig in and eat on God's word amen so we're feasting together this evening now we always refer to as faith faith is a big word that is kind of uh maybe misunderstood a lot because believing in faith is not the same thing faith is not a belief system you know what I mean or articles of doctrine that we agree on I believe this I believe that the other day somebody was wanting me to explain and I sat there and I started said well we believe this and we believe this and we believe that and I I just got I stopped them and I said well wait a minute that's really not what I believe what I believe is Jesus Christ is present right now to do exceedingly and abundantly above what I can even ask her thanks and that was the Super sign the super sign was a virgin shall conceive in other words I'll be with you even in you tilled again the end I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun will come again and I will be there with you I will not leave you I will not forsake you I I will be there for you and I I I I feel that's one of the great things that Satan is trying to Blind the church from by looking in the mirror it is just causing us to not be able to come to that spot so we substitute a false definition for faith and Faith becomes what we doctrinally believe what we believe and we have 111 messages that are a thousand uh 100 I believe 1100 or so that we can go through and say I believe this I believe that I believe this I believe that and we have Great Fellowship in that and and and I'm not against that and and so many means but faith is really something different right so I I'm trying to move to something because I I don't want like I said to just be stuck and be battling and building a wall up so that hoping that Satan doesn't penetrate it you know I don't want to hold the fort because James says that that faith without works is dead that kind of faith is dead and and it's it I don't take that like it it you don't believe it and you don't have it but what he's saying is that kind of Faith it's not working it's not working it's not accomplishing anything it's not doing anything so there's got to be a different faith that he's wanting us to have and a greater understanding and so I think that he's been bringing this to us by bringing us the message by bringing the messenger because we know that the teaching Reign has to come before the latter rain and so there's we we have to learn you know I can sometimes I I sit back and I don't think that that we've really got all the lessons but he's so patient with us and so long suffering with us and it has such regard for us as his children that he keeps reminding us and reminding us trying to bring us along and trying to get us to grow to a greater State and leave behind the idea that faith is what I I believe Faith Comes fresh faith is fresh manna it's fresh it's new it's it's living and I'm not talking about sound Doctrine he said we're not laying again the principles of sound Doctrine water baptism of the opening of the seals the church age Messengers the godhead explain we're not laying on again the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're not laying those but we're moving into something that's more perfect for the believer something that's more real more fresh more living more active something that's so genuine that it's unshakable and undeniable so let's just if you help me here I'm going to read out a paragraph and I know we say these things all over and over and over again but there just comes a time where the spirit of God just cracks it open for you and you just get a little more light [Music] just like a scripture all of a sudden takes on a new meaning for you so never read your Bible thinking you know what it says I don't read the Bible I read read 20 years ago that was all marked in yellow and now it's been marked in blue and it's been marked in red now it's been underlined now words are circled and pretty soon the Bible's old and I have to get a new one because it's full of fresh manna okay so this is what he says now Faith is a revelation from God now just listen oh we know Faith's a revelation the church is built on Revelation but do we really understand that now Faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay they're just a moment now there's a need for him to stay there Now understand now he's not trying to give us some doctrinal truths he's trying to actually create in US by the word of God a mind like Jesus had let this mind be in you that was in him he's actually trying to get the spirit that Jesus had in you because if the same spirit that was in him dwelleth in you it will also Quicken your mortal bodies what does Quicken mean means make a lie don't think that's the rapture you've got to be made alive before the rapture you've got to be quickened you've got the word has got to come alive and that's not done through Doctrine that's why Paul said let us move on to Perfection let us leave those things behind let us move on there's something else here that the elders obtained a good report by that without it's impossible to please God in fact he even comes down when he talks about Enoch he says he had this testimony before he was translated that he pleased god without faith it's impossible to please God put them together don't break those scriptures up Enoch was translated because he had faith and what is it that he's trying to get to us is a real faith so he says now I want to say that in just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace Faye Revelation is something that's been hid from you and now is made known to you you can get a revelation of an ant pile you didn't know those fire ants were there but all of a sudden you become aware and you completely realize that those ants are there they exist it's real it's exactly the way it is now there's a difference in believing there's red ants in your backyard and coming in contact with them I don't know why I came up with that analogy it don't seem very spiritual but sometimes we just gotta get bit he said he said he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did so it's not I believe I believe I believe this I saw this I saw that this was opened up to me it's beyond that it's something that he he said he did so let me bring it in present tense not changing the quote it's something he's doing the church is built on what revelation God moves his church by Revelation he changes lives by Revelation not by your increase in Doctrine not by your increase of the Mysteries and the teachings that you continually to learn but it's an active participation of God in your life speaking directly to you and showing you things personally it is not a group revelation because sometimes you do things that nobody else does so it's it's and it's by grace you didn't work yourself up into faith notice you didn't read the book you didn't read the promises you didn't do it there's something that took place you read the word God by Revelation quickened that word to you by his Spirit by Grace right the word don't Quicken the spirit quickens you read the word and by Revelation he made that word a reality to you not an understanding not a piece of a puzzle he made it a reality not a perception but the word now becomes reality it is what is you can't work yourself into that that's why you pray for it if you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God now the church is absolutely wearing itself out preachers just keep thinking maybe I shouldn't say that maybe I keep thinking that if I keep pounding you with the doctrine keep pounding you with the Revelation keep teaching the Malachi 4 5. keep teaching the opening of the seals keep teaching the doctrine keep teaching the son of man keep talking all those things to you explaining it this way and explaining it that way somehow you're going to get Faith you're not you're not you're not going to give faith that way faith is given to you by God personally and it's by his grace and we're substituting education emotion teaching Doctrine self belief and group belief as being our faith we believe that God sent a messenger fine show me that faith the best most of us could do is have an intellectual argument with someone that don't believe then we Pat ourselves on the back and come away man I won that argument that guy he couldn't stand up to what I said and all you're doing is throwing out things that brother Branham thrown out not for him right but for you and the Very fact that you're in that argument shows you didn't get what he was saying am I okay okay God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation and we could just uh go down here and uh maybe 114 just to read this he says now he talking about the Protestant says it's Jesus and the and the Catholic said it's Peter and he says now they could be right but to me they're both of them it's wrong it was upon spiritual revelation of who he was Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you Peter but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this to you Upon This Rock in other words the whole church is built on the whole church is going to grow by the whole church is going to go forward by God personally revealing to you not only Doctrine or teaching but all things concerning life God revealing to you so much so that the prophet of God made this statement and I know we throw it out all the time and we put it in our thing but every time we make this statement in our Consciousness we're always thinking about it in the realm of Doctrine teaching message books and tapes but he said the bride does nothing until she has thus saith the Lord [Music] another God told me God spoke to me and oh we get so scared of getting to that place because we think that we're going to be attacked or our belief structure is going to be attacked or someone's going to bombard us with quotes I've seen people take quotes and Destroy more faith than they've ever built up maybe I'm getting too personal but I gotta move on I've got to move out I've got to get going I want to know what this messenger is talking about what does he mean works is the expression of the revelation that I have and he because he says it it he says Upon This Rock the revelation of who he is it's upon the Revelation he is the word and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it it shows that the gates of hell would be against it so he's he's not against your Doctrine Because he believes in fears and trembles he's against the relationship that you personally have with God showing you and revealing to you and leading you oh he'll let you believe everything you want but don't let God tell you to do something you know and and so let's read 117. I'm going to try to move quickly he's expressing this trying to draw the difference between what we call intellectual Faith what we call doctrinal Faith teaching how many knows that God's A Healer we all believe that you believe God's A Healer sure you believe God's A Healer but that don't get you healed like someone says well I'm not sick yeah you're sick you're sick as a dog well God's A Healer well show me because that's not what we're talking about we're not we're talking about he's talking about something moving on to if I could tie this into perfect Faith but you you have your messages and your books I'm just sharing my heart with you the direction that I'm going in personally the direction I'd like to lead this flock in and I I think I'm obligated to let you know that he says in an audience of people we're a prayer line comes through you'll find some and they were all good people they will say their there's something that's trying there's some that is trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all and others it's just by grace it's just given to them and now there is the difference see that does it that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first so you in other words you can see it I read it all the time Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God's A Healer by his stripes we are healed we confess that you understand we confess it because we believe it that's our foundation but once we keep saying that one day he reveals to you that this is your hour of possession I've come to fulfill this scripture that you've hung on to I've come to fulfill it in your life today a virgin shall conceive every generation a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive of urgency but one day that word was revealed to the predestinated person that was called to receive it because amen and Mary said what Let It Be unto me according to thy will now that's where he's trying to get us to right not using one another as a crutch not using song service not using the Fellowship of the church not using our programs and all that we've got he's trying to rise us up to a higher place he said it must be revealed first Jesus clearly expressed this when he said no man can come to me except the father draws him first or reveals me to him first Revelation is a real action it's something that actually takes place man it's like grabbing a hold of 277. it might look like a wire there but Betty when you grab it you know that that wire's got life it looks like a wire you don't see it nobody can explain what electricity is nobody's ever been able to Define it they know it's electrons and magnets and negative pole and negative push but once you get a hold of that wire you become alive or dead that's scriptural the same word brings some to life and kills others draws him first he says you ought to read this is Saint James 6 and 14. to 46. they didn't know who he was they thought he was was just an ordinary man they thought he just to be as people does today some prophet he was a prophet but he was an ordinary man but there was more than that so we we understand that that in paragraph 22 he says that Jesus said that no man could come to me except my father draws them first maybe I'm just redundant or maybe I've been so far behind you all first for so long that I'm just catching up but we've eliminated the drug because we already believe I believe God's A Healer if you believe God's A Healer then you should be looking for the draw you should be looking for the Revelation you should be looking for the the spark you should be looking for it to come to pass you don't sit there and say I believe God's A Healer and sit there and let the letter kill you start looking for it you start look at you start revealing that well man you start walking to it why you know it's coming you know it's coming I believe in a Rapture that don't mean I'm going to get raptured I gotta look for it look up your rejection I got to prepare for it I got to get a faith that'll let me possess it so he says here he says draws him first and all that the father has given me will come to me no man can understand who he is or how it is who he is or how it is how it is he lays that in there because he's a prophet he stores it up we've got that scripture so already made up in our mind that we read it and Buzz through it in our preconceived idea and we never stop and say wait a minute I can't even know how it is until I get a revelation it's a perception it's a perception you're living by perception and not by Revelation I'm sorry I'm living by perception and not Revelation but God show me how it is n't that amazing no man can understand who he is or how it is except it be revealed to you by the revelation of God and then faith in that you'll Act accordingly and we could go read some more because it's also fabulous at paragraph 125 he says that's the reason you stagger out of these things and stagger into what you have now it was God leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be now listen to this if the ground isn't prepared beforehand it can't grow right that's the reason the seed of faith when you preach faith you see the discernment of the Lord and you see what takes place and all the gifts of the Bible working people working themselves out oh Hallelujah I believe it and come up and find themselves disappointed see the ground has to be for ordained and you know when it strikes you oh I hope something's striking you tonight it's all I can say so you you see that that there's a preparation that has to be prepared what do you think this message has been doing we've been believing it and studying it and we've never seemed to ever get to the place wait a minute this message is preparing me the ground has to be prepared first in others he can't put in what he wants to put in he can't plant what he wants to plant he can't have to grow what he wants to grow until he prepares the ground first Lord I don't know I've been in this 50 years I probably have only let you prepare me about a month but I know that you got something that you want to grow up in me I'm going to go along if you have to go or you're busy don't let me hold you back go ahead feel free he said paragraph one chain just seed has to have the ground prepared first therefore all he foreknew he called all he foreknew he predestinated if you want to read it it's Romans 8 28-34 and also Ephesians 1 1-5 all he foreknew he called all he called he justified all he justified he has already glorified there's nothing out of order we think there is but look at the scriptures it's just hitting exactly the way God's word said it would we see the messages rejected today isn't that just what the scripture said it would do sure all these things are ordained of God oh it should make you happy that's the trouble with we today so much differences in Christianity alone he just goes on to say a few more things there and and so I just want to go back and I said those things till late a foundation because we've got to get to a place where our faith will be a working faith of a faith that we can show that we have by the actions that are according to the revelation in there we're just we don't sit back but actually now we can actually take The Works of God the revelation of God and it actually becomes something that is no longer in our minds no longer in our hearts but it's actually manifested in flesh now we've all got the idea that the words manifested in flesh in other words I'm the word I'm the seed you know against God in flesh and God's manifested in flesh God's manifested in his health and you're unfruitful that's not what our messenger taught us that's not even what Jesus taught us he says the works that I do the pastor shall do also the works that I do the preacher shall do also the works that I do the Elder shall do also so I just Proclaim myself to be one of them that's not what it says in other words you're not going to do anything that he doesn't show you that you have a revelation he's got a church that he's preparing so he can start give him give them revelation so each of them can play their part a body fitted and joined together each one plots us playing the need children teenagers everybody led to the spirit of God by what Revelation Lord speak to my heart I believe it I know it but I know when it strikes me Let It Strike me Lord make this scripture alive let me see it lead me have something in my life I'm tired of sitting on a dead stump believing all the things that I believe and not seen any fruit people have been in this word for years and don't have one convert they never knelt down with nobody they never took them by the hand and say I'd like to lead you to the Lord all you're doing is leading them to the one that reaches down and touches them if you believe he's there if you believe he hears his prayer if he's shown you revealed to you if you lay your hands on that sick person they will get well I'm almost to the place I just don't want to have somebody come up in the prayer line me lay my hands I'm going to say God's A Healer in everything now you go away and be it done according to your faith I believe there's something there that he has for his sons and daughters of God that they can confront that situation that they possess the Revelation to say to that person this ends here and not by a workup amen not by any motion but by a revelation and a revelation you you're as cool as a cucumber I remember sitting in places in big meetings and everybody's sending the Holy Spirit over here Holy Spirit go over here go over there do this do that you know yeah wait a minute Lord reveal to me how it is and what you're going to do sometimes brother REM said they're not going to live that would shake a lot of people's faith but I don't want the saith my inspiration now the question I'm trying to ask you this morning is it given to us to move into that type of faith I say yes not scolding anybody I'm putting it on myself tonight I believe there's coming a time because we've been prepared we've been taught we've been elected we've come to the realization of that that now he can impart to us you can there's no need be doing a big explanation of adoption or taking over the thing he simply said it this way the works that I do you shall do also because I do nothing unless the father reveals it to me first put those two together and then you don't have a church that's trying to produce wool you have a church that's bearing wool am I making sense are you with me I'll try to close because with faith and revelation you have an ability to do things by faith that can't be done any other way by revelation you can do things that cannot be done any other way things that seem impossible only have Revelation all things are possible no negativity you take it out David by revelation defeated Goliath okay amen his faith was expressed by the work of killing Goliath that's what he said wait a minute you uncircumcised Philistine what are you trying to do to the five-day armies of the Living God you can't do this he says I'm going to pluck you on the tree he said if you pluck me on the tree what Samuel told me that I was going to be the king of Israel and come into pass you're a dead man I'm going to cut your head off that wasn't words because he had the revelation the Revelation was expressed because he acted accordingly now the work came from the revelation you can't go reproduce that work now you could if you got the Revelation then the revelation will produce the work but you can't read the story and create the Revelation you can read the story and pray for the Revelation as for the Revelation seek for God to make it real to you and then act upon it when you know it strikes you but that's what faith does that's what Revelation does he wants a church now that can come up that he's in such personal contact with with such Union in that he can start having them do things that are seemingly impossible that they can express by their works their revelation because if it's not expressed it's all in you and the whole Commission of the church was to take it out of you and give it so Revelation allows you to do things that you couldn't do you know you know he only did it by faith Dave only did what he did by the Revelation he had he didn't figure out a plan they tried to give him a plan but he waited until he knew beyond the shadow of a doubt God spoke to his heart all these Great Men Sampson what he did he did by faith by revelation he felt his hair he said God Revenge my eyes I told him to tie the things up and he did what he did Moses did what he did Daniel you can just go on and on and on because you know like we say you know sickness that that has no other hope but faith it has no other hope the only hope it has right is God's going to reveal to me and make this word come alive in my life that's what I'm waiting for I'm not going to try to produce it I know it's by Grace faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen you don't make it come to pass it comes to pass in his time by his grace you just have the great hope so sickness has no other hope but faith faith produces what was hoped for you're hoping for it right you've read it you know it's yours but you're waiting on something you're waiting on the Revelation from God to make that real to you by his grace that you can say the saith the Lord I'm well until then keep hoping keep praying keep hanging on but he's trying to bring his church from that place to the place that he can start giving them the Striking Force that you know it's yours and you'll act accordingly he prepares you to receive revelation or as I would call it working faith he wants to take all that we've been taught and all that we believe and put it to work and it won't be a public show it won't be a great big movement it'll be on the individual basis you walking into the library at school in the spirit of God just giving you that Revelation go sit next to that girl pray for you don't know what thought she's in but you're a daughter of God you're a son of God he wants to start taking you because he made a promise The Works that I do shall you do also the thing is he had to prepare the ground he had to prepare us he had to give us to the place where we really knew what a revelation was you know what message he preaches right along with all this doing God of service without it being his will church this message is fantastic get reacquainted with it go back into it go back into the storehouse start asking yourself wait a minute God I know you got more for me I remember one time I told I told somebody I says there's more to this message and I'm seeing they used to call me a more boy there's one of those more boys well I I'm a more and more boy than I've ever been I want more I believe he's got more I want to have a working faith I want everything I believe about the Seals Everything I believe about the son of man I want everything I believe about all the drakens all who brother Branham was the deity that he possessed I want all that to come in to the fore ordained works that he wants me to walk in I hope that this is where I'm wanting to go Church okay you you pray if you want to go down this road I think is your pastor I think I need to tell you what it is I'm preaching what it is I'm trying to get across with what it is that's burning in my heart because I Want You Victorious over every devil and the only way that is going to happen is when God shows you by his grace I can't teach it right I can't create it he's Sovereign do you love him let's Stand Together isn't he marvelous he's so good he's so wonderful amen amen I just you know and and if this mind could it get in us we're going to have this faith and the faith isn't for us it's for him it's for those that are out there the gift is for you so what God wants to do in you he wants to do for others let's just pray our gracious Heavenly Father tonight maybe Lord I took a little time to Bear my heart and I I hope father that the people just bear with me in my folly but Lord I I want more I want to see everything that I believe actually be manifested in work form show me your revelation without your works and I'll show you my Revelation by my works works is Faith expressed oh Father what does it do if you show me something and I'm too afraid to step out on it [Music] Shadrach and Abednego they looked at that King and said O King live forever they never said oh you filthy unbeliever you're going to hell O King live forever and King I want you to know this one thing my God is able to deliver me but if he doesn't I'm still knocking a bow down to that Idol Lord and what was there there was a Fourth Man in that fire Lord I want that fourth man in my life Lord I want the hopes that I have in my heart The Desires in my heart father I want you to come Lord Jesus if you would be so kind and merciful by your grace and reveal to me the reality and make it alive I can't do it myself I can't work it up myself faith is a revelation it's a gift of God it's nothing that you do but you know when it strikes you Lord strike me not just tonight but every circumstance that I come into father speak to my heart give me Revelation how it is oh Father continued open to us the storehouse the wonderful secrets that are contained in the pages of what
