[52:46] he does not mean his words
[52:48] he goes straight to the point
[52:51] so uh without wasting much of your time
[52:53] let us open our books our bibles to the
[52:55] book of first peter
[52:57] chapter two
[53:00] the ninth
[53:12] verse first peter chapter two the ninth
[53:16] to the tenth verse
[53:20] it reads but you are a chosen generation
[53:23] a royal priesthood
[53:25] and holy nation a peculiar people that
[53:28] you should show for the praises of him
[53:30] who hath called you out of darkness
[53:33] into his marvelous light which in times
[53:36] past
[53:37] were not a people but are now the people
[53:39] of god which had not obtained mercy but
[53:42] now have obtained mercy so we want to
[53:45] focus on
[53:47] verse 9 which says you are a chosen
[53:50] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[53:52] nation
[53:54] amen let us open our bibles to
[53:56] the book of jeremiah
[53:58] chapter 1 verse 4 and 5.
[54:11] verse 4 reads
[54:13] then the word of the lord came unto
[54:15] me saying before i formed thee in the
[54:17] belly i knew thee
[54:20] and before thou came his forth out of
[54:22] the womb i sanctify thee and i ordain
[54:25] thee a prophet unto the nations
[54:28] we'll open our bibles to one more
[54:30] scripture before we take our seats let's
[54:32] open uh our bibles to the book of
[54:34] ephesians chapter one
[54:36] verse four and 5.
[54:51] verse 4 reads according as he has chosen
[54:53] us in him before the foundation of the
[54:55] world
[54:56] that we should be holy and without blame
[54:59] before him in in love
[55:01] having predestinated us unto the
[55:03] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[55:06] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:08] of his will may the lord add blessings
[55:11] to the reading of his word we can take
[55:13] our seat
[55:21] in the book we were reading in uh first
[55:23] peter
[55:25] it is telling us that we are a chosen
[55:27] generation and a royal priesthood a holy
[55:30] nation
[55:31] and a peculiar people we are not a
[55:34] normal people
[55:36] tonight i'm not looking at a normal
[55:38] people
[55:39] but a chosen generation
[55:41] the lord has been um working with me on
[55:44] this subject that i'm planning to speak
[55:46] on
[55:47] which is uh stepping into our true
[55:49] identity
[55:52] you know i've been realizing and looking
[55:54] around
[55:56] as we see people
[55:58] are concerned about where they came from
[56:00] everyone wants to look where they came
[56:03] from
[56:04] everyone
[56:05] wants to know where their roots is
[56:08] people are going for dna tests
[56:10] wanting to see how much percentage i am
[56:12] of this
[56:13] how much percentage i am of that yeah
[56:16] there's nothing wrong with that it's
[56:18] because people are having a yearning to
[56:21] realize their true identity
[56:23] people are having a yearning they want
[56:25] to know where they came from
[56:27] it's because
[56:28] everyone wants to know because before
[56:30] you know where you're going you have to
[56:32] know where you are coming from
[56:34] but we thank god we don't have to look
[56:36] far to know where our true identity is
[56:39] we don't have to look far for us to know
[56:41] where we came from because the lord
[56:43] jesus christ told us in the word who we
[56:46] are amen we already know our true
[56:48] identity
[56:50] we know that we are a chosen generation
[56:53] we are a royal priesthood
[56:56] and as people are going around
[56:58] trying to find out who they really are
[57:00] people are being told go find out
[57:02] yourself
[57:03] go out there in the world
[57:06] and realize your true identity of who
[57:08] what you were supposed to be and now the
[57:10] devil is taking advantage of that
[57:14] he goes in and takes over the mental
[57:16] faculties of the people
[57:18] we know the devil is the god of this
[57:20] evil age yeah you know the pastor was
[57:22] preaching earlier on he owns the
[57:24] kingdoms
[57:25] he was trying to offer jesus the kingdom
[57:28] to say if you worship me i'll give this
[57:30] unto you
[57:31] and now satan is taking advantage of
[57:34] that people trying to find out who who
[57:36] they are and then that's when he slides
[57:39] in right there
[57:40] people now
[57:42] they're coming up with hideous things
[57:44] someone who is born a man they are now
[57:46] being told that you can change your
[57:48] identity you can be a woman if you want
[57:52] someone who is born a woman they are
[57:54] being told you can go change and become
[57:55] a man if you want
[57:57] why is because the devil has
[57:59] come in into the education system he has
[58:03] come in and he is
[58:05] polluting people's minds and this was
[58:07] not the original part that god had
[58:10] but we are not worried about that we
[58:13] don't go out to try and find ourselves
[58:15] or realize who we are because we already
[58:18] know
[58:19] god told jeremiah that before you were
[58:21] formed in the valley of your mother i
[58:23] had you i knew you
[58:25] i had you predestinated so we know we
[58:28] are the bride of christ we don't have to
[58:30] fear that we don't have to go out to try
[58:33] and find something else
[58:35] we just have to go and look what god had
[58:38] for us before the foundation of the
[58:40] world
[58:41] the true identity that he had for you
[58:43] and me
[58:44] before he placed us on this earth that's
[58:46] what we are supposed to and how do we do
[58:49] that we go by going straight into the
[58:52] word the word is like a mirror it shows
[58:54] us our true identity
[58:56] you see
[58:58] so we were predestinated predestinated
[59:00] means you were determined beforehand
[59:03] before you were even born
[59:05] god already has set out your identity he
[59:07] had already chosen you
[59:09] before you were even born
[59:12] so it is important for people to know
[59:14] who they are
[59:15] and not only in the physical realm or
[59:17] physical aspect but in the spiritual
[59:19] realm people it's important for people
[59:22] to realize their true identity because
[59:24] if you don't realize your true identity
[59:26] the devil is going to take advantage of
[59:28] you the devil you're gonna leave under
[59:30] your own privileges if you don't know
[59:32] who you are so it is very important that
[59:35] you and i this evening that any other
[59:38] day the more we read our word we can see
[59:41] who we are we can see where we came from
[59:43] and so that we can step into the true
[59:46] identity that god had for us
[59:49] so
[59:50] we are not afraid of the devil trying to
[59:53] point us at a different direction saying
[59:55] you can be that you can be this or the
[59:57] other but we know the author of our
[1:00:00] faith we know jesus christ is able to
[1:00:03] point us and show us who we really are
[1:00:06] you know many people especially young
[1:00:08] people when they are growing up you have
[1:00:10] you're so under pressure you are saying
[1:00:13] lord what do you bring me here on earth
[1:00:15] for but now the devil if you are not
[1:00:18] careful the devil will point you at
[1:00:19] something else
[1:00:20] you end up not knowing your real
[1:00:22] identity but if you approach god with
[1:00:25] the right attitude he is willing to show
[1:00:28] you where you came from
[1:00:30] so your true identity is not determined
[1:00:33] by where you came from
[1:00:35] where you were born does not determine
[1:00:37] where you came from
[1:00:39] it doesn't matter if your parents with
[1:00:41] drug addicts that doesn't determine your
[1:00:44] true identity
[1:00:45] but if you go back god will tell you
[1:00:47] that before the foundation of the world
[1:00:50] i had you on the back part of my mind he
[1:00:52] told job he said
[1:00:54] where were you when the sons of god
[1:00:55] shouted for joy where was that before
[1:00:58] the foundation of the world
[1:01:00] so where you were born has nothing to do
[1:01:03] with your true identity
[1:01:05] being born in an underprivileged family
[1:01:08] has nothing to do with your identity
[1:01:10] but if you just come back and look into
[1:01:12] the word and say lord what did you bring
[1:01:15] me on earth for lord whom am i he is
[1:01:18] willing to show you
[1:01:20] god is more than willing to show you who
[1:01:22] you are more than you are willing to
[1:01:23] find out
[1:01:25] because he wants to use you he wants to
[1:01:27] use me and that can only happen when we
[1:01:30] realize our true identity
[1:01:32] and your past does not determine your
[1:01:35] identity
[1:01:36] what you have done does not determine
[1:01:39] who you are because the devil is slick
[1:01:41] he is smart
[1:01:43] things that you done 10 15 years ago
[1:01:45] he's gonna point to that and say you see
[1:01:47] that that's who you are
[1:01:50] but you gotta show him and you say the
[1:01:52] bible tells me that
[1:01:54] i was forgiven
[1:01:55] his blood covers me
[1:01:58] so that is not me that was somebody else
[1:02:01] and the bible says you and i we were
[1:02:03] justified which means we never done it
[1:02:06] in the first place
[1:02:07] so the moment the devil shows you back
[1:02:10] in the past what you did you say that
[1:02:12] was not me that's attributable back to
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:17] you know the devil is so sleek he comes
[1:02:19] into our memory he uses
[1:02:21] memory as a great tool to fool you and
[1:02:24] me
[1:02:26] he makes you forget that jesus christ
[1:02:29] died for your sins
[1:02:30] he pardoned all of them
[1:02:32] he erased them not only erased but he
[1:02:35] does not remember
[1:02:37] i remember was hearing this other
[1:02:38] testimony this brother went to brother
[1:02:40] branham and he was saying
[1:02:42] he had repented years ago and he says
[1:02:45] every time i feel so condemned and every
[1:02:47] time i feel condemned i kneel down to
[1:02:49] pray
[1:02:50] to ask god for forgiveness for the
[1:02:52] things i've done
[1:02:53] brother branham said you know what
[1:02:55] when you kneel down that's the first
[1:02:57] time god is hearing that
[1:02:59] because he doesn't remember
[1:03:01] the moment you repent
[1:03:03] it's gone in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:03:06] but we find there are people
[1:03:08] who have long rods that are long enough
[1:03:10] to go and fish out what god cannot get
[1:03:14] and we are discouraging one another we
[1:03:16] ought not to do that
[1:03:18] when someone is trying to live a
[1:03:19] christian life
[1:03:21] someone trying to get
[1:03:23] rid of their past we are supposed to
[1:03:25] encourage them we are not supposed to
[1:03:27] keep on digging the things that they
[1:03:29] have let go of
[1:03:31] we try to keep on misconstruing their
[1:03:33] identity but that not ought to be like
[1:03:36] that because your past is your past it
[1:03:38] is gone
[1:03:39] if you come to christ he is able to give
[1:03:41] you a new future you remember the lady
[1:03:45] mary when she was there everyone taught
[1:03:47] her as a prostitute
[1:03:50] all the pharisees
[1:03:52] they called her a prostitute because of
[1:03:54] her current lifestyle because of what
[1:03:57] she had done
[1:03:58] because of her past
[1:04:00] and she has all she called she she
[1:04:02] thought she was a prostitute because of
[1:04:04] the life she was leaving but when she
[1:04:06] came to jesus and then she realized that
[1:04:09] he could give her a new identity that
[1:04:11] jesus could change her life then she
[1:04:14] came and she knelt down in tears and she
[1:04:17] she was done with that life and then god
[1:04:20] made her a candidate that was able to
[1:04:22] receive the holy ghost on the day of
[1:04:24] pentecost
[1:04:25] so it don't matter what you have done
[1:04:28] don't matter what sins you have
[1:04:29] committed or your life that you are
[1:04:31] living right now if you are only willing
[1:04:34] to let go and go to god he is willing to
[1:04:37] give you a new identity he is willing to
[1:04:40] forgive all of your sins he is willing
[1:04:43] to call you child because that's what he
[1:04:46] had in mind before the foundation of the
[1:04:48] world he called you a chosen generation
[1:04:51] a peculiar people
[1:04:53] a bride that doesn't have a spot or
[1:04:55] blemish why because you never done it in
[1:04:58] the first place so when next time the
[1:05:00] devil shows you something you say that
[1:05:02] was not me
[1:05:04] you did it
[1:05:05] because he fooled you into doing it amen
[1:05:08] so your past does not determine your
[1:05:10] identity
[1:05:12] your current life if you're not living
[1:05:14] right and you're willing to let it go
[1:05:16] that does not determine your identity
[1:05:18] either
[1:05:19] it doesn't matter what people call you
[1:05:21] what people call you has nothing to do
[1:05:23] with your identity but what god says
[1:05:26] about you that's what matters
[1:05:28] so
[1:05:29] if you are just
[1:05:31] humble enough to come to god and you say
[1:05:33] lord what do you say about me in your
[1:05:35] word
[1:05:36] lord i'm willing to take that identity
[1:05:38] he is willing to do that for you
[1:05:41] amen we read of rahab she was a city she
[1:05:45] was a city prostitute jericho people
[1:05:47] knew her as a prostitute but god had a
[1:05:50] different idea of her
[1:05:52] he wanted her to be in the lineage of
[1:05:54] jesus
[1:05:55] he wanted her to be called the
[1:05:57] grandmother of god but people taught her
[1:05:59] as a prostitute
[1:06:01] but then god came and brought the word
[1:06:04] of the day in in her gates and she was
[1:06:07] able to accept it and she was she she
[1:06:09] was willing to let go of her old life
[1:06:12] and god gave her a new identity instead
[1:06:14] of being a prostitute she was now being
[1:06:17] called the grandmother of jesus christ
[1:06:19] that's the identity that god had for her
[1:06:22] so this is a sign this is evidence to us
[1:06:25] that god is willing to give you a new
[1:06:27] identity your current life your past
[1:06:30] life has nothing to do with what god has
[1:06:32] in store for you with what god wants you
[1:06:35] to be doing
[1:06:36] you you go to god he will show you many
[1:06:39] times we think oh i should be a preacher
[1:06:42] or i should be a singer or i should do
[1:06:44] this and that in church i might i'm
[1:06:46] supposed to be a deacon you want
[1:06:49] maybe you are not called to do that if
[1:06:51] you go to god he will show you what you
[1:06:53] were supposed to
[1:06:54] some people are given attitude just just
[1:06:58] being nice
[1:06:59] kindness some people got to see the the
[1:07:02] light of the world of this day because
[1:07:04] of the how people treated them
[1:07:07] that's a calling
[1:07:08] that somebody else is calling
[1:07:10] hospitability
[1:07:11] someone else may see christ through you
[1:07:14] because of the way you handle yourself
[1:07:17] i had a testament i was talking to one
[1:07:19] brother the other day he was a he
[1:07:21] he was gone down and he was doing all
[1:07:24] sorts of drugs and everything and this
[1:07:27] brother his brother friend didn't even
[1:07:29] testify to him but he saw the life he
[1:07:32] was living he saw the life how his life
[1:07:35] was changed and he yearned for it and he
[1:07:37] said i want that
[1:07:39] you see the life that someone else was
[1:07:41] leaving there can be a calling leading
[1:07:43] someone to christ
[1:07:45] because because of that so if you
[1:07:47] approach god with the right attitude and
[1:07:50] you are willing for him to change you he
[1:07:52] is willing to do that and the moment you
[1:07:55] stand in your position he is able to do
[1:07:57] wonders with you
[1:07:59] so don't care what people say about you
[1:08:03] don't if what you think about yourself
[1:08:06] is not aligned with the word don't even
[1:08:08] think yourself about it like that
[1:08:10] take away what you think about yourself
[1:08:12] and take what god says about you
[1:08:15] that is the only identity that matters
[1:08:18] we read in the bible of a man called
[1:08:20] gideon
[1:08:25] gideon was at a thrashing flow
[1:08:27] and he was hiding harvest from the media
[1:08:29] night
[1:08:30] he was being a coward
[1:08:33] and we have no history in in the bible
[1:08:35] there's no way he tells us that gideon
[1:08:37] was a was a warrior or he was a soldier
[1:08:41] or any military training
[1:08:43] but he was right there he was threshing
[1:08:46] he was threshing of bali or whatever
[1:08:49] wheat he was working with
[1:08:51] and then when the media knights would
[1:08:53] come he would run off and try to hide
[1:08:56] their their harvest
[1:08:58] but then this one time the angel of the
[1:09:00] lord came unto him amen it says
[1:09:03] thou mighty man of valor
[1:09:06] it did not say gideon had never we we
[1:09:09] don't have any history of gideon winning
[1:09:11] any fight we don't have any history of
[1:09:14] gideon winning any battle
[1:09:16] but what did the angel of the lord come
[1:09:17] to him and say he says thou art mighty
[1:09:19] man of valor it did not say you coward
[1:09:23] that's what he was being there
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:26] in george's chapter 6 verse 11 he says
[1:09:30] and there came an angel of the lord that
[1:09:33] said and set under an oak which was in
[1:09:36] offer
[1:09:37] that pertained unto jewish the abyss
[1:09:39] right
[1:09:40] and his son gideon thrashed wheat by the
[1:09:43] wine press to hide it from the media
[1:09:45] knights
[1:09:46] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[1:09:48] him and said unto him
[1:09:50] the lord is with thee thou mighty man of
[1:09:53] valor
[1:09:54] why the angel was addressing him with
[1:09:57] his real identity amen the angel of the
[1:10:00] lord was addressing him with his true
[1:10:02] identity to what he really was
[1:10:04] he was not a coward as he thought of
[1:10:07] himself or as he showed himself to be
[1:10:10] and he was willing to accept that
[1:10:12] identity that god had for him and he was
[1:10:15] willing to step into that identity and
[1:10:18] we know he stopped being a coward and he
[1:10:21] got up and he accepted the true identity
[1:10:24] that god had for him and he walked into
[1:10:26] it and we know he had victory he brought
[1:10:29] victory to the whole children of israel
[1:10:32] why it's because this man
[1:10:34] decided he accepted the identity that
[1:10:37] god had for him he and he refused the
[1:10:39] identity that he thought himself as he
[1:10:42] was not a farmer or a coward but god
[1:10:44] called him a mighty man of valor and
[1:10:46] that's what he was so whatever the word
[1:10:49] of god tells you that you are you take
[1:10:51] it you accept it and you walk into it
[1:10:55] god has a work for you
[1:10:56] god has a job for you if you accept that
[1:11:00] identity he has for you amen
[1:11:03] also in the bible we read of a man
[1:11:05] called shamga
[1:11:08] he was also in the same situation that
[1:11:10] gideon was in
[1:11:11] after they have harvest the philistines
[1:11:13] would come in and then take all of their
[1:11:15] harvest away
[1:11:17] i'll read in um in the book of faith by
[1:11:20] experience
[1:11:22] 58
[1:11:24] we'll start from paragraph 34 he says
[1:11:26] you know what
[1:11:27] shanghai begin to think you know i'm not
[1:11:30] a fighter but i'm a son of abraham i am
[1:11:34] the tribe and the lineage and i'm
[1:11:36] circumcised i know that my god still
[1:11:38] lives and there is a crisis at hand
[1:11:43] and the spirit of the lord come upon him
[1:11:44] and he jumped out there in the middle of
[1:11:46] the road
[1:11:47] you see
[1:11:48] shanghai realized that his father
[1:11:51] abraham
[1:11:52] had been given a promise and the promise
[1:11:54] said that york's seed shall possess the
[1:11:58] gates of the enemy
[1:11:59] so
[1:12:01] sham god realized that the word of his
[1:12:03] day that's what he told him and he was
[1:12:05] living under his own privileges
[1:12:07] after they have harvest the philistines
[1:12:09] would come in and steal all of it and
[1:12:11] his family was starving but then he said
[1:12:14] no
[1:12:15] it's now his time is time is up
[1:12:18] this is now a different case altogether
[1:12:21] i have lived under my own privileges for
[1:12:23] so long and then whilst he was standing
[1:12:25] there he looked into his
[1:12:28] blood he saw his veins and he saw that
[1:12:31] he was
[1:12:32] abraham's blood was flowing in it and he
[1:12:35] saw the word that said your seed shall
[1:12:37] possess all the gates of the enemy
[1:12:40] and he knew that word was going to take
[1:12:42] care of him he didn't care whatever that
[1:12:44] was coming for him because he knew that
[1:12:46] if he stand upon the word of god nothing
[1:12:48] can stand before him and you know what
[1:12:51] he took he took an ox god and he went
[1:12:53] his head is straight for those
[1:12:55] philistines and he slew 600 of them with
[1:12:59] with a weapon that's not even used in
[1:13:01] the military why is because he was
[1:13:03] standing on the word he looked at what
[1:13:05] the word said about him and he said and
[1:13:08] he looked himself he said i am a seed of
[1:13:10] abraham i am entitled to possess all the
[1:13:14] gates of the enemy because that word
[1:13:16] will take care of him he said i don't
[1:13:18] care if i don't have no military
[1:13:20] experience but i know if i stand in
[1:13:22] god's word is going to keep me that word
[1:13:25] that say i'll possess that's happening
[1:13:27] today and he went and he stood there and
[1:13:30] he got victory he killed all 600
[1:13:33] philistines and he delivered his family
[1:13:36] from that so you and i if we do the same
[1:13:39] thing too if we stand upon the word of
[1:13:41] god god has the same reaction to his
[1:13:44] word god is bound by his word so if you
[1:13:47] come and you realize that you are also a
[1:13:50] seed of abraham you stand that same
[1:13:53] promise stands for you so you have the
[1:13:56] right to claim it to you
[1:13:58] and he says and any man that's here
[1:14:00] that's been circumcised by the spirit of
[1:14:02] god that's born again any of you people
[1:14:06] that's sick the devil is a bluff you rob
[1:14:08] you he'll pay your checks he'll do
[1:14:10] everything he can but don't you have to
[1:14:13] stand for it no longer you say
[1:14:16] i'm not a preacher but you are a
[1:14:17] christian he didn't know how to fight
[1:14:20] know nothing about faith but just step
[1:14:23] out anyhow
[1:14:24] so long you are a christian so long you
[1:14:27] accepted christ as your personal savior
[1:14:29] and you receive the holy ghost by virtue
[1:14:32] you are a child of abraham you are a
[1:14:35] seed of abraham that scripture applies
[1:14:38] to you so you just take that word and
[1:14:41] say lord this is me i'm a seed of
[1:14:44] abraham
[1:14:45] now i'm going to possess all the gates
[1:14:47] of my enemy you don't matter what enemy
[1:14:50] it is whether it is disease you go for
[1:14:53] it i tell you god is bound by his word
[1:14:56] he is able to come there and deliver you
[1:14:59] he's able to come and help you it might
[1:15:01] be a it it might be a different enemy of
[1:15:04] fear you come there stand on the word
[1:15:07] he's going to able to help you it might
[1:15:09] be an enemy of financial problems that
[1:15:13] don't matter it didn't specify which
[1:15:15] enemy says dicey shall possess the gaze
[1:15:17] of all the enemy so you come out right
[1:15:20] there and stand and you say lord your
[1:15:23] word is going to keep me god will never
[1:15:25] disappoint you
[1:15:27] amen god is not a man that he should lie
[1:15:30] or a son of man that he should repent
[1:15:32] the bible tells us that his word will
[1:15:34] never go back to him void so if you
[1:15:37] spoke it and you take it and you apply
[1:15:40] it it's going to happen to you it's go
[1:15:42] his that his word is going to keep you
[1:15:45] his word is going to give you victory to
[1:15:48] possess all the gates of the enemy
[1:15:49] standing in front of you
[1:15:51] all you have to do is take that identity
[1:15:54] and you say lord i'm stepping into it
[1:15:56] that's what i am that's what you wanted
[1:15:58] for me before the foundation of the
[1:16:00] world
[1:16:02] if you just stand on the word your
[1:16:04] revealed word for the day
[1:16:08] now the devil knows that the more you
[1:16:10] look at the word the more you read your
[1:16:13] word that's where you get your strength
[1:16:14] from but now the devil he's so cunning
[1:16:17] he's trying to he tries to make us
[1:16:20] not read the word he has so many
[1:16:22] distractions in front of us
[1:16:25] we have the cell phone you have
[1:16:27] everything right there and you spend
[1:16:29] your whole day on the cell phone and you
[1:16:31] don't have time for god
[1:16:33] if you go look in your cell phone
[1:16:35] settings your if the phone screen time
[1:16:38] you'll be shocked
[1:16:39] later on if you compare that with your
[1:16:41] bible with your bible time or prayer
[1:16:44] time
[1:16:44] those are the devil's techniques he is
[1:16:47] trying to deem our focus he's trying to
[1:16:49] get us distracted because he knows that
[1:16:52] the more we look and read into the word
[1:16:55] of god you get to realize who you are
[1:16:58] and he has no power against you in
[1:17:02] question and answers on the holy ghost
[1:17:04] the prophet of god said
[1:17:05] thus the death struck to satan
[1:17:08] when a man takes god at his word brother
[1:17:11] that will kill satan every time
[1:17:14] not sometimes but he says it will kill
[1:17:17] satan every time
[1:17:19] the hardest hitting that satan can get
[1:17:23] when a man will take god at his word
[1:17:26] that's what he's trying to do
[1:17:28] he'll make you not have time for your
[1:17:30] bible
[1:17:31] not have time for devotion not have
[1:17:34] enough time to pray
[1:17:36] you just pray over food or two minutes
[1:17:38] just before you go to work
[1:17:39] that's not gonna help you i had one
[1:17:42] person say if prayer doesn't chase sin
[1:17:44] out of your life
[1:17:46] sin is going to chase prayer out of your
[1:17:48] life
[1:17:48] and now prayer is that connection we
[1:17:51] have with god if you don't communicate
[1:17:54] and you don't have that connection where
[1:17:56] are you going to have your overcoming
[1:17:57] power
[1:17:58] you are not going to have it but if we
[1:18:01] just realize that these are the devil's
[1:18:03] techniques these are the devil's tricks
[1:18:05] and we make sure we go back to the word
[1:18:08] we are not distracted and keep on
[1:18:11] looking at what god has for us what he's
[1:18:13] telling us who we are
[1:18:15] we will never fail we know victory is
[1:18:18] certain we know that victory is set for
[1:18:21] sure
[1:18:22] that's why many people end up losing
[1:18:24] their identity they forget who we are
[1:18:28] people forget who they are because
[1:18:30] they are not being reminded by their
[1:18:32] bibles of who they are they're not
[1:18:34] listening to the tapes they're not
[1:18:36] reading the message of the hour so how
[1:18:38] are you gonna know who you are where are
[1:18:40] you gonna get that power from to
[1:18:42] overcome everything that comes in your
[1:18:44] way
[1:18:46] many people have lost their identity
[1:18:49] people trying to be balanced
[1:18:51] here in the message people try to
[1:18:53] they say no we are being too too too
[1:18:56] strict or we are being too legalistic
[1:18:58] and then they try to balance in the in
[1:19:01] the process they over balance and then
[1:19:04] we end up being lukewarm and cold
[1:19:07] we have lost our identity people end up
[1:19:10] going to places that they never went
[1:19:12] before
[1:19:13] christianity has lost its identity
[1:19:16] christianity people were called
[1:19:18] christians in the first place because
[1:19:20] they were living like christ
[1:19:22] when people said oh those people are
[1:19:24] acting like christ this is how christ
[1:19:27] used to work like
[1:19:28] that's
[1:19:29] that's where the name christianity came
[1:19:31] from but now christianity has lost its
[1:19:33] identity
[1:19:34] it's because people are not reading
[1:19:36] their word people are not praying there
[1:19:39] is no prayer life but if we go back to
[1:19:42] the word of and see what god says about
[1:19:45] us and see what god has for us will be
[1:19:48] able to regain back our identity and see
[1:19:51] who we really are
[1:19:53] amen so we have to know our true
[1:19:56] identity we are the bride of jesus
[1:19:59] christ
[1:20:00] and we are here to tell the world who
[1:20:02] christ is
[1:20:03] he died on the cross of calvary so that
[1:20:05] he could come and live within you and me
[1:20:08] and so that we could reflect him amen
[1:20:12] we also read in the bible of a man
[1:20:14] called
[1:20:16] david then he was a boy he was out there
[1:20:20] in the wilderness
[1:20:21] and then he is taking care of his
[1:20:23] father's sheep and then the father sends
[1:20:25] him to go to go feed his brethren
[1:20:28] and then david he was there but whilst
[1:20:30] he was still in the desert there's a
[1:20:32] bear that came he wanted to take one of
[1:20:35] his lamps there's a lion that came and
[1:20:37] wanted to take one of his lamps but you
[1:20:39] know what he did he had a slingshot
[1:20:41] he killed the lion
[1:20:43] he killed the bear whilst he was there
[1:20:46] and he was no longer scared of these
[1:20:48] wild animals he was not scared of this
[1:20:51] beast whilst he was there he was
[1:20:53] realizing and stepping into his true
[1:20:56] identity he was tapping into the
[1:20:58] identity that god had for him he was
[1:21:01] having his identity building his
[1:21:04] credentials
[1:21:05] as a beast slayer
[1:21:07] whilst he was there in the wilderness
[1:21:09] when he was sent by his dad to go give
[1:21:13] food to his brothers
[1:21:15] then he hears someone defying the name
[1:21:18] of the lord the the lord of israel and
[1:21:21] he's wondering who is that and then when
[1:21:23] he goes to look he sees that it's just
[1:21:25] another beast
[1:21:27] and then he realized he said i'm a beast
[1:21:29] slayer yeah that's the identity i
[1:21:32] created for myself that's my credentials
[1:21:35] and then they try to stop him but he
[1:21:37] says no i'll go
[1:21:38] he is not anymore different because he
[1:21:41] is just another beast if you read your
[1:21:43] bible carefully says david ran towards
[1:21:46] goliath why to him that was just another
[1:21:49] beast in modern day language that what
[1:21:51] we call huge people right he was just a
[1:21:53] beast and he said from my
[1:21:56] previous experiences with god i have
[1:21:59] known myself to be a beast slayer
[1:22:02] he's so goliath
[1:22:03] no any other different beast and he ran
[1:22:06] towards him and he had victory why it
[1:22:09] was because he was using the identity
[1:22:11] that god was working him on
[1:22:14] so when you see trials coming your way
[1:22:17] don't hesitate go for it
[1:22:20] god has trusted you with that trial when
[1:22:22] you see a temptation come your way you
[1:22:25] go for it god has allowed the temptation
[1:22:27] to come your way
[1:22:29] that's an opportunity for you to build
[1:22:31] your identity that's an opportunity for
[1:22:33] you to step into the identity of who you
[1:22:36] are to be an overcomer
[1:22:39] because we have promised that to
[1:22:41] overcome every enemy enemy's gaze to
[1:22:44] possess all of them
[1:22:47] when a trial come you go for it you are
[1:22:49] building your identity
[1:22:52] there is no temptation that god can
[1:22:55] bring to you or trial that god can bring
[1:22:58] to you that he he doesn't trust you with
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:02] we know for job
[1:23:04] god was having a conversation with satan
[1:23:06] and he said have you conceded my servant
[1:23:08] job satan he said well how can he not
[1:23:11] serve you and you have given him all
[1:23:13] these things
[1:23:14] god said go touch him whatever you want
[1:23:18] i know he will stand for me
[1:23:20] why in all these things god allowed
[1:23:22] satan to bring those trials so god
[1:23:25] doesn't bring to you any trial but he
[1:23:28] allows satan to do it and when satan
[1:23:30] comes with it
[1:23:32] know for sure that god has already
[1:23:34] entrusted you with it
[1:23:35] god already knows that you're gonna
[1:23:37] overcome it
[1:23:38] god already knows that you are gonna be
[1:23:41] an overcomer so whatever sickness
[1:23:43] disease god that comes your way whatever
[1:23:46] tribulation trial affliction when it
[1:23:49] comes your way you say thank you lord
[1:23:52] you this is an opportunity for me to
[1:23:53] have a testimony this is an opportunity
[1:23:56] for me to step into my true identity as
[1:23:59] an overcomer this is an opportunity for
[1:24:02] me to show who i really am and god
[1:24:06] always has a way for you in first
[1:24:08] corinthians he said there is no
[1:24:10] temptation that's uncommon to man god
[1:24:12] already opens away whenever you are in a
[1:24:15] corner so whenever you're in a tight
[1:24:18] spot you look and say lord show me the
[1:24:20] doorway i'm supposed to go
[1:24:22] he already has that for you and when you
[1:24:25] come out of that door you're gonna come
[1:24:27] out of a warrior you're gonna come out
[1:24:29] and overcomer you're gonna come out
[1:24:31] victorious so every time you are in a
[1:24:34] tight spot the devil tries to put you
[1:24:36] between a rock and a hard place you look
[1:24:38] around and pray and say lord show me
[1:24:41] that open doorway and when you come out
[1:24:44] you'll be able to give a testimony and
[1:24:46] you can stand and you say i'm an
[1:24:48] overcomer next time trials come your way
[1:24:51] you say i have an identity my identity
[1:24:53] is an overcomer my identity is a demon
[1:24:57] killer because you are working it out
[1:24:59] whenever when any time things come your
[1:25:02] way you are fighting it you are building
[1:25:04] up your credentials so that's what you
[1:25:07] got to do know that god has trusted each
[1:25:10] and every trial that comes your way each
[1:25:13] and every disease that knocks on your
[1:25:15] door you say thank you lord this is an
[1:25:17] opportunity for me to win this is an
[1:25:19] opportunity for me to be an overcomer
[1:25:24] so the devil is always trying to
[1:25:26] distract us so that we don't see who we
[1:25:28] really are
[1:25:32] in an expert in an exposition of the
[1:25:34] seven church ages the prophet of god
[1:25:36] said now remember this
[1:25:38] christ in the true church is a
[1:25:39] continuation of the book of acts but the
[1:25:42] book of revelation shows that the
[1:25:44] antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:25:46] church and defile it
[1:25:48] making it look warm formal and powerless
[1:25:51] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:25:54] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:25:57] and discrediting the word god's word
[1:25:59] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:26:01] the lake of fire
[1:26:03] he knows that if the people gather true
[1:26:05] revelation of the true church
[1:26:08] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:26:11] and what she can do to the greater works
[1:26:14] she will be
[1:26:15] an invincible army
[1:26:17] the devil knows that the more you read
[1:26:20] the word
[1:26:21] the more you see in revelation this says
[1:26:24] to whom who overcometh in the seven
[1:26:26] church ages he doesn't want you to be
[1:26:28] like that so that's why he's always keep
[1:26:30] on distracting you from reading your
[1:26:32] word
[1:26:33] the moment he realizes you the moment
[1:26:36] you realize who you are he knows that's
[1:26:38] destruction for his kingdom
[1:26:40] that's why he's trying to dim us he has
[1:26:43] brings he has brought so many false
[1:26:45] doctrines in in the message trying to
[1:26:47] distract people but we thank god there
[1:26:49] is a people like we were told who has
[1:26:52] that part of god that seed of god that's
[1:26:55] in here nothing can change it
[1:26:58] there is no false doctrine that can
[1:26:59] change what god has placed in you there
[1:27:02] is no form of wind
[1:27:04] wind of doctrines or false religion that
[1:27:07] can touch it the seed of god that he
[1:27:09] placed in within you is untouchable so
[1:27:13] we thank god we can never be distracted
[1:27:16] we can never be fooled amen
[1:27:19] so if we can just stand and trust on god
[1:27:22] knowing that what he has placed within
[1:27:24] you and me that will not fail so make
[1:27:27] your calling and election sure and say
[1:27:30] what i have within me is it the right
[1:27:32] thing because when christ is gonna come
[1:27:35] and try and find you he's not going to
[1:27:37] look for anything else but the holy
[1:27:39] ghost is going to look for the very
[1:27:42] same peace that would dovetail with what
[1:27:45] he had in the beginning
[1:27:47] nothing different that's why we gotta
[1:27:49] stay on the world stand flat footed so
[1:27:53] that we cannot be moved
[1:27:56] hey man
[1:27:57] he don't want us to realize who we are
[1:28:00] the reason for the whole world coming
[1:28:02] into our in this day is for you and i to
[1:28:05] realize who we are
[1:28:07] is for you to realize that
[1:28:10] whatever that was in christ is supposed
[1:28:12] to be within you and me
[1:28:14] jesus came down so that he says the
[1:28:16] works that i do shall you do also
[1:28:20] that is the that's the holy sense for
[1:28:21] him to come on calvary so that he could
[1:28:23] live within you and me so that he could
[1:28:26] do the works he was doing
[1:28:28] in the body of jesus he wants to do it
[1:28:30] within you and me
[1:28:32] in the book when they when their eyes
[1:28:34] were up and says
[1:28:36] then
[1:28:37] if he is raised from the dead he is
[1:28:39] normal in a corporate body but he is in
[1:28:41] our body
[1:28:43] all that was in god he poured into
[1:28:45] christ and all that was in christ he
[1:28:48] poured into the church
[1:28:50] see it's just a continuation
[1:28:52] that day you'll know that i'm in the
[1:28:54] father and the father in me and i in you
[1:28:57] the holy spirit working amongst his
[1:28:59] people
[1:29:00] that's why the devil don't want you to
[1:29:02] know that the very same power that was
[1:29:04] in god when he said let there be light
[1:29:07] was in jesus christ when he broke that
[1:29:10] bread and multiplied it
[1:29:12] that same power is lying within you and
[1:29:15] me because church we know church is not
[1:29:17] a building
[1:29:18] we are the people
[1:29:20] look at your neighbor and say god bless
[1:29:22] you church
[1:29:24] that person is a church
[1:29:27] that's the church so whatever that was
[1:29:29] in jesus christ he put he poured it
[1:29:32] into
[1:29:33] a body
[1:29:35] that he calls bride people who are
[1:29:37] willing to receive the holy ghost when
[1:29:39] you receive the holy ghost
[1:29:41] then you can say i am bride then
[1:29:44] everything that was in him is poured
[1:29:46] into you and you have the very same
[1:29:49] power that he had
[1:29:52] if if you go to the sea and you take sea
[1:29:54] water
[1:29:56] and you if i put it in a bottle here i'm
[1:29:58] not going to call it bottled water i'm
[1:30:00] going to call it sea water
[1:30:02] why is because the same chemical
[1:30:04] elements in this
[1:30:05] sea water in a bottle is the same
[1:30:07] chemical elements in the water that was
[1:30:09] in the sea
[1:30:10] it's just in a different container
[1:30:12] so the very same power that was in god
[1:30:15] it was just transferred into jesus and
[1:30:18] the same power was transferred into you
[1:30:20] and me so whatever he did those works
[1:30:24] you and i we can do it because we have a
[1:30:26] promise that says greater works than
[1:30:29] this shall you do
[1:30:31] only if we're able to realize that
[1:30:33] that's our identity to be a tabernacle
[1:30:36] of christ a people whom he wants to live
[1:30:39] in
[1:30:41] in the book of john
[1:30:42] chapter 10 verse 34 he says jesus
[1:30:45] answered them is it not written in your
[1:30:47] law i said you are god's
[1:30:49] and if he called them gods unto whom the
[1:30:52] word of god came and the scripture
[1:30:54] cannot be broken
[1:30:56] that is your true identity you are a god
[1:31:01] so we have all that power that god
[1:31:03] invested in us for that us for that
[1:31:05] power for us to use
[1:31:08] whilst we are living here on earth we
[1:31:10] have power against all principalities of
[1:31:12] the devil we have the power to create an
[1:31:15] atmosphere
[1:31:16] we have the power to chase demons
[1:31:20] we have the power to profess healing we
[1:31:22] have the power to live a christian life
[1:31:25] is because we are gods whatever that the
[1:31:29] life that jesus lives you lived you and
[1:31:32] i we can live the same one because
[1:31:34] whatever that was in him has been
[1:31:37] pleasant to us all the temptations that
[1:31:39] he went through you and i we can
[1:31:42] overcome those jesus also grew up from
[1:31:45] being a young man from from from being a
[1:31:47] baby to a 33 year old man so all those
[1:31:51] temptations he came across them too
[1:31:53] so he the same power that he had if you
[1:31:56] dedicate your life to christ he is also
[1:31:59] able to give you the same victories that
[1:32:00] he had
[1:32:01] because
[1:32:02] you and i the bible tells us that we are
[1:32:05] gods so if we are only able to realize
[1:32:08] that and step into that
[1:32:10] identity the devil will not be able to
[1:32:14] to make us live under our own privileges
[1:32:17] because we know and we would have
[1:32:19] realized who we are amen
[1:32:23] yes sir
[1:32:26] in the bible in the book of romans
[1:32:27] chapter 12
[1:32:29] verse 2 he says and be not conformed to
[1:32:32] this world but be ye transformed by the
[1:32:35] renewing of your mind
[1:32:37] that you may prove
[1:32:39] what is that good and acceptable the
[1:32:41] perfect will of god
[1:32:44] if
[1:32:45] you be transformed by the renewing of
[1:32:47] your mind that means letting go of your
[1:32:50] old carnal mind and getting a new mind
[1:32:53] that that christ had
[1:32:55] that's how we will be renewed that's how
[1:32:58] we renew our identity to be changed we
[1:33:00] are transformed into the real identity
[1:33:02] that christ has for us if we look at
[1:33:05] philip chapter 2 verse 5 it says let
[1:33:08] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:33:10] christ jesus who being in the form of
[1:33:12] god thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:33:14] to god
[1:33:16] so you be renewed by taking the mind
[1:33:19] that was in christ jesus and you put it
[1:33:22] in your mind
[1:33:24] and we know that this mind is being
[1:33:26] talked about is the heart
[1:33:29] because when you take it to the mind the
[1:33:31] devil is able to come and reason it out
[1:33:34] that's how he overcame adam and eve in
[1:33:36] the first place
[1:33:37] he that's how he overcame eve because
[1:33:40] he she reasoned it she used the the mind
[1:33:43] to reason when you try to reason with
[1:33:46] the devil you'll never win
[1:33:47] he's been around for 6 000 years
[1:33:50] he probably knows the bible more than
[1:33:51] you do
[1:33:53] so never
[1:33:54] reason the word in the mind with the
[1:33:56] devil
[1:33:57] take that mind that was in christ and
[1:34:00] put it down in your heart
[1:34:02] proverbs 23 7 tells us that as a man
[1:34:05] thinketh in his heart so is he so you
[1:34:08] have renewed your mind yourself by
[1:34:10] taking the mind that was in christ and
[1:34:13] you place it within yourself
[1:34:15] and the way
[1:34:16] that you think in your heart that's who
[1:34:19] you are if you have that mind in christ
[1:34:22] you become christ-like because you are
[1:34:24] now thinking like christ
[1:34:27] so that's why never reason the devil he
[1:34:31] is cunning
[1:34:32] but if you have that word in your mind
[1:34:35] in your heart he can never touch it
[1:34:38] in the
[1:34:39] in the book and exposition of the
[1:34:40] servant changes the prophet of god said
[1:34:42] so when a spirit born spirit filled man
[1:34:45] in faith takes that word into his heart
[1:34:49] and places it upon his lips why does the
[1:34:52] same as deity speaking
[1:34:54] every mountain has to go
[1:34:56] satan cannot stand before that man why
[1:34:59] because he has the mind that was in
[1:35:01] christ and he has the word in his heart
[1:35:05] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:35:06] word was with god and the word was god
[1:35:09] you have that word in your heart you
[1:35:11] have god in your heart nothing can stand
[1:35:14] before you every mountain has to go
[1:35:17] satan cannot stand
[1:35:19] no affliction can stand before you
[1:35:22] because
[1:35:22] you know your true identity
[1:35:25] you know that i am tabernacling deity
[1:35:28] you know when i speak it is the same as
[1:35:30] dear to speaking because i have taken
[1:35:32] the word of the lord into my heart
[1:35:35] yes sir
[1:35:40] i'm sure many of you you heard
[1:35:43] the little story of the
[1:35:44] this little boy who went to
[1:35:47] to visit his uh his relatives and he was
[1:35:50] he was coming from from the country he
[1:35:52] had never seen a mirror before
[1:35:54] when he goes he sees a mirror he stands
[1:35:56] in front of the mirror
[1:35:58] he waves he sees a young man similar to
[1:36:00] him waving back he says who is that
[1:36:03] whatever actions he was doing this boy
[1:36:06] the boy in the mirror was mimicking
[1:36:09] those same
[1:36:10] movements back to him so he was
[1:36:12] wondering he had never seen a mirror
[1:36:14] before
[1:36:16] and then after a while it struck him he
[1:36:18] said
[1:36:19] that cannot be somebody else that is me
[1:36:22] amen and he ran back to his mama and he
[1:36:25] said mama that is me i saw myself in the
[1:36:28] mirror
[1:36:30] i'm here to tell you that we have a
[1:36:31] mirror in front of us this evening when
[1:36:34] you look into that mirror it will never
[1:36:36] lie to you when you look into the mirror
[1:36:39] of the word of god he always shows you
[1:36:41] who you are when you look into the
[1:36:43] mirror of god he always shows you your
[1:36:45] true identity so just whenever you come
[1:36:48] to any situation just look and see what
[1:36:51] does the mirror say about me you know
[1:36:54] there's this man who gave his friend a
[1:36:56] spoken word book and he read it and he
[1:36:58] went back to his friend and said this
[1:37:00] book called me a buzzard but then this
[1:37:03] friend said oh that same book called me
[1:37:04] an eagle why because a mirror doesn't
[1:37:08] lie it just shows you who you really are
[1:37:11] so you just walk into the mirror it will
[1:37:14] show you your true identity
[1:37:17] you might get lost for a while but
[1:37:20] because of your true identity that will
[1:37:22] never change every time we come to
[1:37:24] church so that we can check our identity
[1:37:28] to make sure that we align with what the
[1:37:30] mirror is saying
[1:37:32] when things are going wrong maybe you
[1:37:35] are in school or anything and you you
[1:37:38] have back threat you have bad grades
[1:37:41] just look at what the mirror says the
[1:37:43] mirror says you shall be the head and
[1:37:45] not the tail so you take what the mirror
[1:37:47] says about you and apply it to you when
[1:37:50] you are at work they don't wanna they
[1:37:52] don't wanna promote you or they're
[1:37:54] trying to suppress you you look take up
[1:37:57] the mirror and look and say what does
[1:37:58] the mirror say about me the mirror says
[1:38:01] you are above and not beneath you take
[1:38:03] it and you step into it that's the
[1:38:06] mirror will never lie to you whenever
[1:38:08] you are sick take that same mirror it
[1:38:11] will show you it will say by my stripes
[1:38:14] you were healed so you just take it and
[1:38:17] you accept it you will be healed because
[1:38:19] the mirror never lies amen the mirror
[1:38:22] says we shall perform exploits when you
[1:38:24] are in a tight fix god wants to perform
[1:38:27] an exploit with you and me this evening
[1:38:29] amen just look into that word
[1:38:32] that word will never lie that mirror
[1:38:34] will never lie amen
[1:38:37] whenever you look god is duty bound to
[1:38:40] his word we have read we all know the
[1:38:42] story about auntie jemima the the little
[1:38:45] lady in memphis tennessee she was
[1:38:47] reading the bible
[1:38:49] then she saw herself
[1:38:51] she saw she looked and she saw the shuna
[1:38:53] my woman she looked into the mirror and
[1:38:55] she said that was me and then she saw a
[1:38:58] sick boy and she saw that as well but
[1:39:01] there was no elisha in the picture
[1:39:03] and she knew the the picture has to be
[1:39:05] complete because the mirror does not lie
[1:39:08] and then she
[1:39:09] knelt down and she prayed her prayer
[1:39:12] brought a whole plane down
[1:39:15] why because she had realized her true
[1:39:17] identity it is not the prayer of william
[1:39:20] branham that was working it was the
[1:39:22] prayer of a woman who realized who she
[1:39:24] was there were a lot of important men on
[1:39:26] that on that plane but prayer did not
[1:39:29] even regard all of that it just said
[1:39:31] there is a woman who realized her true
[1:39:34] identity and the picture has to be
[1:39:36] complete and the man the prophet of god
[1:39:38] was walking not knowing where he was
[1:39:41] going it's because the prayer of this
[1:39:43] woman was directing the man of god
[1:39:47] it's because she had realized her true
[1:39:49] identity she saw herself in the mirror
[1:39:52] of the word and her child was healed
[1:39:55] because of her prayer so it don't matter
[1:39:57] who you are you might be a mother you
[1:39:59] might be
[1:40:00] you might be a father a son or a
[1:40:02] daughter whatever it is look yourself in
[1:40:05] the mirror whatever the mirror says
[1:40:07] about you
[1:40:08] it will never lie and you step into that
[1:40:11] identity that the mirror has for you
[1:40:14] the mirror of the word of god it never
[1:40:17] lies
[1:40:18] amen the moment you realize your true
[1:40:21] identity
[1:40:22] all hell will know who you are
[1:40:24] all forces will know who you are
[1:40:27] peter ran away when he didn't know his
[1:40:29] true identity but when he came in
[1:40:32] contact with christ
[1:40:33] his identity knew his identity changed
[1:40:37] he was willing to die for the cross he
[1:40:39] was willing to die for the word because
[1:40:42] his identity had changed you remember
[1:40:44] the sons of skever when they were trying
[1:40:46] to pray and cast out these these devils
[1:40:49] this demon says paul we know but who are
[1:40:52] you
[1:40:54] they didn't even know their identity and
[1:40:56] they ran so if you don't know your
[1:40:58] identity you the devils are gonna make
[1:41:00] you run
[1:41:02] you're gonna run away from temptations
[1:41:04] you're gonna run away from trials if you
[1:41:06] don't know your true identity but when
[1:41:09] you know your true identity the whole
[1:41:12] host of heaven is willing to back you up
[1:41:14] because they know who you are one time
[1:41:17] the prophet of god said we are
[1:41:18] ambassadors of heaven when an ambassador
[1:41:21] speaks they are representing the whole
[1:41:23] country so when you and i speak we are
[1:41:26] representing christ the whole host of
[1:41:28] heaven has to back up whatever you say
[1:41:31] they know who you are when you speak
[1:41:34] heaven has to back it up when you chase
[1:41:37] demons when you chase sicknesses when
[1:41:40] you come what after whatever that's
[1:41:41] coming after you heaven has to back you
[1:41:44] up if you are a true ambassador and you
[1:41:47] have the holy ghost
[1:41:48] god is duty bound by his word to make
[1:41:52] that come to pass if you just realize
[1:41:55] your true identity of who you are god is
[1:41:58] willing to come down god is willing to
[1:42:01] show it to you god is willing to show
[1:42:03] you
[1:42:04] that you are supposed to be victorious
[1:42:06] god is willing to give you all the
[1:42:08] victories that you need and all those
[1:42:11] trials and temptations that maybe you
[1:42:13] have in your past and you said lord i
[1:42:16] was not able to overcome this two weeks
[1:42:18] ago but you say lord now i realize that
[1:42:21] i am a son i am a daughter of abraham

[1:42:25] all the gates of the enemy all those
[1:42:28] battles i was able i was not able to
[1:42:30] overcome now that's the thing of the
[1:42:33] past i'm may i'm applying it to me this
[1:42:35] evening i want it to be for me i want to
[1:42:39] step into my identity
[1:42:41] all the things that are gonna come in
[1:42:43] front of me lord help me give me the
[1:42:45] ability to overcome it because your
[1:42:48] mirror the word never lies it will
[1:42:50] always show me my true identity it will

[1:42:56] amen let's stand up on our feet

[1:48:37] you know
[1:48:40] we look for who that we really are and
[1:48:42] the lord and i i couldn't add anything
[1:48:45] to what the brother said but you know in
[1:48:48] as being a christian sometimes we should
[1:48:51] increase our borders
[1:48:53] you know what i mean but what other work
[1:48:55] does god have for me to do how can what
[1:48:58] can i do to mature
[1:49:00] in the lord what what what gifts and
[1:49:04] what attributes are there that i can lay
[1:49:07] possession on how can i grow my
[1:49:10] christianity how can i grow my nature
[1:49:13] how can i grow
[1:49:16] you know grow my strength and
[1:49:18] how can i let my light shine greater and
[1:49:21] and how can i have a greater impact on
[1:49:24] people around me all that's part of your
[1:49:27] identity
[1:49:28] all that if i could just use uh add a
[1:49:32] word
[1:49:33] to what my our brother was saying along
[1:49:35] with identity your identity holds your
[1:49:38] potential
[1:49:41] you know and to and to be able if you
[1:49:44] can expand your identity
[1:49:46] i just liked how he said it when he says
[1:49:48] i saw then i saw that's me
[1:49:50] i looked in the mirror and i saw that's
[1:49:53] me and he said if you look in the word
[1:49:56] you can see that's me not just from a
[1:49:58] standpoint of being forgiven but when he
[1:50:01] said these works that i do you shall do
[1:50:04] also do you look at your life and say
[1:50:07] well
[1:50:09] i want those works that what are those
[1:50:11] works what are how can i expand my
[1:50:14] christianity and a lot of times we set
[1:50:17] up camp
[1:50:18] but we've got to go beyond our camp
[1:50:21] we've got to go beyond our comfort zone
[1:50:24] we've got to reach into places that
[1:50:26] we've never walked before we've got to
[1:50:28] have faith to express our faith in ways
[1:50:31] that we never expressed it before
[1:50:35] we've got to have that growth potential
[1:50:38] and that growth potential is a part of
[1:50:40] your identity your final identity is the
[1:50:43] works that i do you shall do also
[1:50:48] that's winning souls to christ
[1:50:50] to help going an extra mile visiting the
[1:50:54] widow and the fatherless in their
[1:50:56] affliction do you look in that and say
[1:50:58] well it says in here that i'll visit the
[1:51:00] widow in the fatherless in in their
[1:51:03] affliction have i ever done that
[1:51:06] have i ever expressed that
[1:51:09] have i ever took this word
[1:51:11] and
[1:51:12] transferred it from letter
[1:51:15] into identity
[1:51:17] and then from identity into actions that
[1:51:21] prove who that you are i can say that
[1:51:24] who i am
[1:51:26] i can say i can lift the thousand pounds
[1:51:30] but when i lift a thousand pounds then
[1:51:33] i've identified that what i've said
[1:51:36] is true
[1:51:37] and that's what god will do he'll
[1:51:39] identify
[1:51:40] what he said is true but let's that
[1:51:43] identity grow in us let us be in our
[1:51:46] life let it be in our action let's be in
[1:51:49] our word let's see if we could expand
[1:51:51] our christianity
[1:51:53] explain expand our area of influence
[1:51:56] expand our testimony expand
[1:52:00] the shedding abroad
[1:52:02] of the love of god by the spirit
[1:52:06] if if we can and i think that's
