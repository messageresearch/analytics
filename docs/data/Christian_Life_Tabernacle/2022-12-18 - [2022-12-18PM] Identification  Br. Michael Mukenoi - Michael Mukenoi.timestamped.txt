[45:48] [Applause]
[45:48] [Music]
[45:51] everything
[45:53] is here fall
[45:56] so I come
[46:02] [Music]
[46:03] through Proclaim
[46:06] that is coming back for you
[46:12] good evening friends you may be seated
[46:18] I am not a preacher but
[46:23] I just yield to the spirit of the Lord
[46:28] we were sitting in a restaurant and
[46:31] the pastor just turned and told me
[46:34] you're gonna speak for us Sunday
[46:37] out of nowhere
[46:41] so I turned and I looked
[46:44] people using the forks and the knives
[46:47] differently so this thought of the
[46:50] prophet
[46:51] caught me
[46:54] there was a time when you know
[46:57] etiquettes had an absolute
[47:00] I can't think of that woman's name
[47:03] but the whole nation trusted in what
[47:06] that woman said
[47:08] I forget her name
[47:10] I was writing a note here I couldn't
[47:12] think of that woman's name what it was
[47:15] but here a few years ago they had to be
[47:19] this woman what she said
[47:22] if she said use the knife in the left
[47:25] hand
[47:26] that was that was it
[47:31] that was the absolute
[47:33] she was the answer to all of it
[47:37] and if you put the fork in the left hand
[47:40] then you were absolutely wrong
[47:45] what was her name congregation says
[47:48] Emily post oh that's for sure sure yeah
[47:51] that's who that now you were you were
[47:56] absolute she was she was etiquette
[48:00] absolute
[48:02] it must be that way
[48:04] okay so from there my thoughts that just
[48:08] traveling
[48:10] and I came
[48:12] to think about
[48:15] what does people in the world do I work
[48:17] in manufacturing as an electrician how
[48:21] do you troubleshoot
[48:22] a an equipment
[48:26] you have a print
[48:28] that shows the state of a good equipment
[48:33] so you have to identify
[48:36] your equipment that is down to the one
[48:39] that is good and winning in that state
[48:41] so that is identification so that's how
[48:45] the world does even those who do uh
[48:48] quality control
[48:50] they have this sample that is good so
[48:54] everything that comes out of the chain
[48:55] of production that must match this one
[48:58] that is good
[49:00] so from there I said Lord what do you
[49:04] want me to tell your people
[49:06] I don't know how to speak
[49:08] and I don't know how to tell it
[49:13] and I had this
[49:15] identification
[49:17] and who are you identifying yourself to
[49:22] and how do you identify to something or
[49:26] somebody you don't know
[49:28] so you got to know the characteristic
[49:30] that
[49:31] of the some people that you want to
[49:33] identify to
[49:34] so you can be like him so you can mush
[49:37] him
[49:39] so we stand and read the scripture
[49:44] so I took it in the message
[49:45] identification
[49:47] that brother when I'm preaching 63.
[49:51] he took the scripture in Philippians
[49:54] chapter 2 verse 5.
[49:58] shall we read
[49:59] let this mind be in you which was also
[50:03] in Christ Jesus
[50:06] who being in the form of God fought it
[50:09] not robbery to be equal with God but
[50:14] made himself of no reputation and took
[50:18] upon him the form of a servant and was
[50:21] made in the likeness of men
[50:24] so if the Mark you may be seated thank
[50:27] you
[50:29] if the mind that was in Cross be in you
[50:33] you will live the life of Christ
[50:37] no doubt about that because behind that
[50:40] mind is the spirit there is a life
[50:44] so you can say you are a Christian and
[50:47] leave any other life then the life that
[50:50] Rose in Christ that was in his mind that
[50:53] he has put in you
[50:55] a Christian is to be christ-like
[51:01] Christ's like is to believe the word
[51:05] and if you don't believe the word
[51:08] then you can't be Christ's like
[51:13] how can you say you are a Christian
[51:16] in the night half of the word
[51:20] how
[51:21] there's no way
[51:23] you've got to believe every single word
[51:26] from Kevin to Kevin
[51:29] like this old brother used to say like
[51:31] brother Branham said it
[51:33] so in our Psalm reading this morning we
[51:36] were reminded of ASAP
[51:39] and his work reminding
[51:43] children of God What the Lord Has Done
[51:46] and we have the same Duty
[51:49] this is what the Colossians tells us in
[51:52] Colossians 3.
[51:55] verse 16.
[51:59] says here let the word of Christ dwell
[52:03] in you richly
[52:06] in all wisdom
[52:09] teaching and admonishing one another in
[52:13] Psalms in hymns and spiritual songs
[52:16] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[52:20] Lord
[52:21] so what does the word of Lord
[52:23] do in your midst when it abides you
[52:27] remember the story of sister happy right
[52:29] they were fellowshipping around the
[52:31] world what happened
[52:33] A great miracle remember the story of
[52:36] Mary brother Abraham says they were
[52:38] walking together with Joseph talking
[52:40] about the Lord
[52:42] and the angel of the Lord came to her
[52:44] that night and revealed himself to her
[52:47] remember the disciples on the road to a
[52:50] mouse
[52:51] they were talking about the Lord and he
[52:53] appeared so do you take your time to
[52:56] talk about the Lord and talking about
[52:59] the word of your day
[53:01] and have you done that to experiment the
[53:04] power behind that word
[53:06] it is still the same as it was yesterday
[53:08] the Bible says by the word of the
[53:13] testimony they shall overcome
[53:17] so where do you hide your testimony and
[53:19] what do you keep it for
[53:21] and yet you know behind that testimony
[53:24] is life there is overcoming power why
[53:28] don't you use it you are giving yourself
[53:31] ideas like the Pastor said this morning
[53:34] you are hiding behind your fears
[53:38] stick the word use it it's going to
[53:42] produce what for which it has been sent
[53:44] David of old
[53:47] he was not fearsome when he saw Goliath
[53:50] he stood up he was a little fellow and
[53:53] this guy was a giant
[53:56] even more bigger than his soul the king
[54:00] Sorrows fearsome yet he was the most
[54:04] powerful among all the children of
[54:06] Israel
[54:07] and do you think that when they let
[54:10] David go to fight him it was because
[54:12] they think he was going to win no it's
[54:14] just because every one of them was
[54:17] afraid to die
[54:18] so they say
[54:20] he doesn't worth anything even if he
[54:22] dies at least we're gonna leave and yet
[54:25] be slaves
[54:27] so they had already accepted to be
[54:30] slaves but that was not the case with
[54:32] David he knew where he stood
[54:35] he knew whose God he was serving he was
[54:39] a living God
[54:41] that can't be defeated
[54:44] today the same God he can't be defeated
[54:49] so who do you want to identify yourself
[54:53] to
[54:54] the Bible says that the character that
[54:59] we have to identify to is Jesus Christ
[55:02] he's God
[55:04] but he sent
[55:06] Prophets
[55:07] to show us that us is moral we can
[55:11] identify ourselves ourselves to him
[55:13] because he was God in flesh but these
[55:17] were morals like you and me and yet they
[55:21] produced his character
[55:24] let's take one of them
[55:26] uh Elijah
[55:29] Elijah was a man of like passion like
[55:31] you and me he prayed
[55:34] for the wind not to come for three and a
[55:37] half years do you know what happened his
[55:40] word
[55:41] was made to live by the Living God
[55:46] you can do the same
[55:48] but you have to surrender yourself to
[55:50] God and be sure that what you do is the
[55:53] perfect will of God because when you are
[55:56] in the perfect will of God
[55:58] he will give life to the word that comes
[56:00] out of your mouth
[56:02] he always does that
[56:05] we want to be
[56:07] make this Bible
[56:09] our Looking Glass
[56:11] and let ourselves be molded by his
[56:15] character
[56:17] having his character his mind letting
[56:21] the mind that was in Christ be in us his
[56:26] mind was always what was his mind to do
[56:30] the mind that was in Christ always to
[56:33] say with the father's word
[56:36] no matter what looked glossy and what
[56:40] looked this way it didn't make any
[56:43] difference to him
[56:44] the father's word is what counted
[56:48] everywhere when he met the devil he
[56:52] never even used his power to defeat him
[56:55] he used what the word
[56:58] because that was him
[57:01] I like this double study that you do
[57:05] when I came yesterday you were talking
[57:07] about desperation
[57:09] do you know that all these characters
[57:11] that the prophet talk about in this
[57:14] message desperation
[57:16] they overcame because there was
[57:19] something common
[57:21] among all of them either they have come
[57:24] across this testimony like Blind by
[57:27] Timbers who heard about Jesus and he
[57:30] believed or like Elijah he was immersed
[57:35] in the word Moses he was immersed in the
[57:39] word so when the time of trouble came he
[57:42] knew where he stood
[57:44] so don't wait until the time of Trouble
[57:47] Comes to feed on the world you've got to
[57:51] feed on the word every second minute of
[57:55] the day every
[57:58] you know where you stand there's nothing
[58:02] greater than the word
[58:05] nothing listen to what the prophet said
[58:07] about the word
[58:12] the best way
[58:16] that God could ever fortify his army was
[58:19] to fight fortify them with the best
[58:24] in our nation we got spies in England
[58:29] has got spies here yet we are friendly
[58:34] we got Spies all over the world
[58:37] and the word has got spies in here
[58:41] they are watching see what kind of new
[58:44] missile what kind of a new thing then
[58:48] they go back to the nation find
[58:51] something to counter attack
[58:53] why
[58:55] and they are they they address their men
[58:59] get things ready for that kind of a war
[59:03] it's always going on there is a Warfare
[59:06] between the devil and God always has
[59:08] been
[59:09] and every year they are finding
[59:12] something new
[59:13] the old airplanes they used back there
[59:16] the old p-38s and whatever they was they
[59:20] scrapped them
[59:21] they got new Jets
[59:23] the old Springfield is no good at all
[59:26] they got a missile rifle now the old
[59:30] Blockbuster is for far behind
[59:33] well even the all trains the old steam
[59:36] engines used to pull the stuff up and
[59:39] down the tracks obsolete
[59:42] they got something new they always
[59:45] searching something new something new
[59:49] now they are trying to dig down in the
[59:52] ground find some way to escape the
[59:54] atomic bomb
[59:55] they won't
[59:57] something new something new every day
[1:00:00] that the world has been the same
[1:00:03] since before the foundation of the world
[1:00:05] and it is still overcoming
[1:00:08] God gave the best
[1:00:10] at the beginning for his Great Mighty
[1:00:13] Army
[1:00:14] and he has never had to change it
[1:00:17] because as I said last night his first
[1:00:20] decision is the best and only he gave
[1:00:24] his people his word
[1:00:26] and he gave us today his word
[1:00:30] in the totality of it he hasn't hidden
[1:00:35] anything everything that was in the back
[1:00:37] of his mind he has reveal it to us
[1:00:40] so what do we do with it do we try to
[1:00:44] identify ourselves to him or do we try
[1:00:47] to do something new some theology not
[1:00:51] the Theology of the denomination because
[1:00:54] we have theology now in the ranks of the
[1:00:56] message
[1:00:58] God has sent us a prophet
[1:01:02] when he sent Moses one of the characters
[1:01:05] that we have to identify to
[1:01:08] before taking Moses or after taking
[1:01:10] Moses out of the scene
[1:01:13] he called Joshua and do you know what
[1:01:15] God told Joshua
[1:01:17] let us wait together
[1:01:20] Joshua 1
[1:01:22] 7.
[1:01:24] only beasts thou strong and very
[1:01:27] courageous
[1:01:29] that Val mayest observe to do according
[1:01:32] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:01:37] commended me who is talking to Joshua
[1:01:40] and where is Moses
[1:01:42] date but listen what he tells him
[1:01:46] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[1:01:48] turn not
[1:01:50] from it to the right hand
[1:01:53] or to the left
[1:02:03] raise the secret of succeeding
[1:02:08] you have the word you have the message
[1:02:11] what do you want to look for
[1:02:15] with the word
[1:02:17] stay with the message
[1:02:19] there's no other weapon
[1:02:22] if you want to succeed stay with this
[1:02:24] word
[1:02:26] stand fast is the Prof the Pastor said
[1:02:28] this morning
[1:02:29] and let me take that a little further
[1:02:31] will you the scripture is what tells you
[1:02:35] what you are
[1:02:37] that expresses you and expresses me
[1:02:42] the scripture tell what we are it's so
[1:02:45] loud that our voice cannot be even heard
[1:02:48] our life speaks louder than our voice
[1:02:52] see and it God's way of letting us see
[1:02:57] what we are
[1:02:59] Jesus said the same thing they are they
[1:03:04] that testify of me
[1:03:06] they prove what I am
[1:03:08] and which one of you can condemn me of
[1:03:10] unbelief sin
[1:03:12] if I haven't properly listened I'm
[1:03:15] talking about looking at yourself
[1:03:20] if I haven't properly identified myself
[1:03:23] as being what the word said that I would
[1:03:27] be so each one of us
[1:03:30] he is talking of each one of us do we
[1:03:34] identify ourselves properly to what the
[1:03:38] world say we should be
[1:03:41] wonder if we Christians could think that
[1:03:44] tonight
[1:03:45] wonder if we can look in God's looking
[1:03:48] glass
[1:03:49] of what requirements is of a Christian
[1:03:53] and identify ourselves that way
[1:03:56] I wonder if we could
[1:03:59] I wonder if we can identify ourselves
[1:04:03] tonight with John 3 16 and all all other
[1:04:08] kind of scriptures mark 16.
[1:04:12] chapter and all these other places
[1:04:15] I wonder if we can
[1:04:17] and you know the result if we do
[1:04:20] nothing is going to stand our way we're
[1:04:23] going to be the most successful people
[1:04:25] on the Earth but the problem is
[1:04:28] we want to define success our own way
[1:04:34] we want to give ourselves
[1:04:37] a picture of something we are looking
[1:04:40] for instead of going and search for the
[1:04:43] will of God for our lives
[1:04:46] when you discover the will of God for
[1:04:48] your life
[1:04:51] whatever comes your way troubles and
[1:04:54] everything he will be there
[1:04:58] he will make you successful whatever
[1:05:01] comes your way
[1:05:02] put yourself in the shoes of the
[1:05:04] children of Israel in the furnace
[1:05:07] what do you do have done
[1:05:10] what
[1:05:12] are you going to stand in that heat
[1:05:16] it took the word of God the life behind
[1:05:20] that word in their heart to stand that
[1:05:24] fear your furnace
[1:05:27] it took that same word for Daniel to
[1:05:30] stand the Lions
[1:05:34] do you realize that even the king
[1:05:35] believed in the god of Daniel
[1:05:37] because that morning he came
[1:05:40] and called Daniel
[1:05:42] how can you call somebody that has been
[1:05:44] put in the lion dance and these lions
[1:05:47] are hungry how he believed in the god of
[1:05:50] Daniel
[1:05:51] and he came that morning Daniel servant
[1:05:54] of the Living God your God has he saved
[1:05:57] you and the god of Daniel has done that
[1:06:00] just what the king believed so if this
[1:06:03] Pagan King could believe in the god of
[1:06:06] Daniel
[1:06:08] you are here standing today God has
[1:06:11] revealed to you all the secrets that was
[1:06:14] behind his mind what do you want to do
[1:06:16] with that
[1:06:18] do you want to use it properly and
[1:06:20] identify yourself as a winner like God
[1:06:25] has put you here to be aware
[1:06:28] let's go back in the garden of healing
[1:06:31] can
[1:06:33] he saw his brother Abel offering a
[1:06:36] sacrifice that was accepted
[1:06:39] it was so simple for him just to do what
[1:06:42] God told him identify yourself to what
[1:06:45] your body is doing
[1:06:47] but you know what
[1:06:48] there was no life in him
[1:06:51] there was no seed in him like the Pastor
[1:06:54] said this morning there was no seed in
[1:06:55] him for him to do what his brother did
[1:06:57] but if there was a seed of life in him
[1:07:01] he was going to do what his brother did
[1:07:04] and he was going to leave
[1:07:07] as a winner
[1:07:09] so
[1:07:10] what we have to do
[1:07:12] is humble ourselves before God
[1:07:15] search his will
[1:07:19] yield to him
[1:07:21] and he's going to use this
[1:07:23] the way he wants to use us not the way
[1:07:27] we think we should do
[1:07:29] because that's where most of our
[1:07:32] problems come
[1:07:34] because I will look my brother and I
[1:07:37] want this my brother here to be this way
[1:07:40] and if he is not acting the way I think
[1:07:43] of him
[1:07:44] then he's wrong
[1:07:47] no that's not the way that God God asked
[1:07:49] us to
[1:07:51] accept each other I have to accept my
[1:07:53] brother the way God has made him
[1:07:58] that's the way I have to
[1:08:03] and
[1:08:04] that's what we want to look at tonight
[1:08:07] I want to look at me and I want to look
[1:08:10] at yourself I want you to look at
[1:08:12] yourself and as we look into God's Great
[1:08:16] mirror of his word
[1:08:18] be able to identify ourselves with some
[1:08:22] that we are going to be to speak about
[1:08:25] some of the characters of other times
[1:08:29] and I want to see myself in God's
[1:08:32] looking glass
[1:08:33] cause if anything will show you where
[1:08:37] you are standing
[1:08:38] it's this book
[1:08:45] there is no book like it because it is
[1:08:48] all truth
[1:08:51] I don't say that other books are not
[1:08:54] true but I know this one is true
[1:08:58] it's all all
[1:09:01] a-l-l truth because it's the word of God
[1:09:06] now
[1:09:09] Jesus gave us the example of what we
[1:09:12] ought to be looking at
[1:09:15] when he reflected his life to us through
[1:09:17] the word what we should see
[1:09:20] when we look into God's mirror we should
[1:09:24] see ourselves identified with him
[1:09:28] that is a perfect example
[1:09:31] for each one of us
[1:09:34] we want to be
[1:09:38] like
[1:09:40] Mary
[1:09:44] who told the angel
[1:09:46] Let It Be according to Thy Word
[1:09:51] and the brother Branham says that the
[1:09:54] word is in the bride like it was in Mary
[1:09:59] so we've got to do like
[1:10:03] like every single promise that we read
[1:10:06] and listen to from this message it may
[1:10:09] seem awkward
[1:10:11] it may seem strange but it is still the
[1:10:14] truth
[1:10:16] imagine as I said
[1:10:19] this Daniel in
[1:10:22] the lands then
[1:10:24] it was strange that yet he knew where he
[1:10:27] stood
[1:10:28] he had to be standing on the world
[1:10:30] because what was the word
[1:10:32] you shouldn't worship idols
[1:10:35] and they gave him two options
[1:10:38] you worship this Idol we spare your life
[1:10:42] all you worship your God and we kill you
[1:10:46] he knew he was worshiping the truth and
[1:10:48] living God
[1:10:49] kill me my one my life doesn't worth
[1:10:52] anything
[1:10:54] but your life with
[1:10:57] everything in the sight of God
[1:10:59] do you know what he gives what value he
[1:11:02] gives your life
[1:11:04] the blood of his only begotten son that
[1:11:09] is the value God gives to your life
[1:11:12] when we were yet dead in sin and
[1:11:16] trespasses he quickened us
[1:11:20] go to the cemetery today can you talk to
[1:11:23] them what can they do in those Graves
[1:11:25] nothing but he quickened you
[1:11:29] every one of you when we were yet dead
[1:11:33] in sin and trespasses we couldn't do
[1:11:36] anything it's by grace
[1:11:39] so what do we do with that Grace are we
[1:11:42] fooling it or are we valuing it
[1:11:49] we should value the grace that God is
[1:11:51] showing to us
[1:11:53] if you were in that day
[1:11:56] what group would you be identified with
[1:12:01] the prophet
[1:12:03] with the Vindicated word
[1:12:06] although they were in the minority
[1:12:09] we had a Vindicated word today
[1:12:12] so which group are you identified with
[1:12:15] today
[1:12:17] because the same group you are
[1:12:19] identified with today
[1:12:21] is the same you would have identified
[1:12:24] with during that day
[1:12:28] or would you be with the popular opinion
[1:12:30] folks
[1:12:31] well I tell you I believe that man is
[1:12:34] crazy that man he's crazy and the only
[1:12:37] way that you'd ever know he wasn't crazy
[1:12:40] is for the same God to reveal to you the
[1:12:43] same thing he had revealed to Moses
[1:12:47] and the only way that we'll ever be able
[1:12:49] to be the images of God and the sons of
[1:12:52] God is for God to reveal to us and
[1:12:56] express himself through his word to us
[1:12:59] and us to the world
[1:13:03] that's the only Channel they are not two
[1:13:07] for Christ was the image here on Earth
[1:13:10] that you could see
[1:13:13] God in a man
[1:13:15] expressed image of God because God was
[1:13:19] in him so much that they were one
[1:13:24] and now when Christ left he Sanctified
[1:13:27] the church
[1:13:29] you
[1:13:31] that the church might take his place
[1:13:35] and express the word of God see that's
[1:13:38] the only way it can be done
[1:13:42] look the place God is giving you
[1:13:45] to represent him on Earth
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:49] do you know what happened to the
[1:13:52] ambassador of the U.S when he goes where
[1:13:55] he is sent
[1:13:56] all the power of the United States is
[1:13:58] behind him but that power is nothing
[1:14:01] compared to the power of the Living God
[1:14:04] when he sends you as his representative
[1:14:08] here on Earth
[1:14:10] you have all the support of Heaven
[1:14:12] behind you
[1:14:16] what did he say whatever you bind on
[1:14:18] Earth
[1:14:19] I'll land in here whatever you lose on
[1:14:22] Earth I'll lose in heaven
[1:14:26] do you realize what you have in your
[1:14:28] hands
[1:14:29] do you want to use it
[1:14:33] like in the message yesterday
[1:14:35] desperation
[1:14:37] where brother Branham says that faith
[1:14:39] and love are sisters
[1:14:42] there's no way you can have
[1:14:45] love true love without faith
[1:14:48] and there's no way you can have true
[1:14:50] faith without love
[1:14:52] they are twin sisters
[1:14:57] and then they work hand in hand but you
[1:15:01] see what side would you have to look in
[1:15:04] your present character
[1:15:06] if Deton would have raised up and said
[1:15:09] that and you had been standing here at
[1:15:12] that time would you have held on to
[1:15:15] God's message
[1:15:16] and messenger and stayed by it
[1:15:20] and was forefully Vindicated to be the
[1:15:22] truth
[1:15:24] or would you have took your your papers
[1:15:27] and went over and drained some other
[1:15:30] group
[1:15:32] or that see just think about it
[1:15:35] when it seemed all was against God's
[1:15:39] Vindicated message and messenger of that
[1:15:42] age
[1:15:43] the Chiefs was down on Moses
[1:15:47] everything was gone
[1:15:50] look like God had forsaken him
[1:15:53] but they had dancing God do something
[1:15:56] they knowed God was in it
[1:16:01] and God is in it tonight as you stand
[1:16:06] here he is in it to tell you that he
[1:16:10] loves you that he has paid the price
[1:16:14] that he has
[1:16:16] the purpose of Christmas is the past to
[1:16:19] say this morning is for you to receive
[1:16:22] the life
[1:16:23] behind the mind of Christ is for you to
[1:16:27] get that mind of Christ in you and live
[1:16:31] by that mind brother sister now to you
[1:16:35] people who has received Christ years ago
[1:16:38] and maybe you feel that that you have
[1:16:41] received that token I hope that it's
[1:16:44] right if you have you don't have to
[1:16:47] worry about it
[1:16:48] it reflects him itself
[1:16:53] how could I keep from being Beethoven
[1:16:56] if he lived in me
[1:16:59] if Christ is in you
[1:17:02] just look at yourself in God's mirror
[1:17:06] here the Bible
[1:17:08] see what some Bible character looked
[1:17:11] like see if you picked you up with
[1:17:13] Daniel
[1:17:15] with Ezekiel
[1:17:17] with the creation of the early church
[1:17:20] see if your picture you picture up with
[1:17:23] them
[1:17:25] are you worldly
[1:17:28] do you love the world all the things of
[1:17:30] the world
[1:17:32] has all that died and you become a new
[1:17:35] creature
[1:17:37] identify yourself tonight in your
[1:17:40] present State now
[1:17:42] where you are standing with some Bible
[1:17:45] character where would you been if you
[1:17:48] had lived in Noah's time
[1:17:51] where you'd have been where we would
[1:17:53] have been in the days of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:55] when he was here on Earth
[1:17:57] in his flesh what group would you be
[1:18:01] identified with tonight
[1:18:04] just think of it see what group would
[1:18:08] you been identified with when Paul was
[1:18:12] correcting them that day in conventions
[1:18:14] and for the things they were doing
[1:18:17] what group would you be identified with
[1:18:21] see just look back
[1:18:24] it's a Looking Glass
[1:18:27] we can see where we whatever we were we
[1:18:31] are now
[1:18:33] that's what we'd have been back there
[1:18:35] because the spirit that's in us now
[1:18:39] identified back there that that same
[1:18:43] spirit that was on them back there
[1:18:46] you see
[1:18:47] we have
[1:18:49] to know where we stand
[1:18:53] we have to know what we identify
[1:18:57] ourselves with because that's what gives
[1:19:01] us our nature
[1:19:04] if you want to go
[1:19:05] beyond go back to where you were
[1:19:09] you have to have been there before
[1:19:12] if you have never been there how are you
[1:19:15] going to go back in a place where you
[1:19:16] have never been
[1:19:18] you are you are not even known there
[1:19:20] who is going to welcome you there
[1:19:23] no one
[1:19:25] no one is going to welcome you where you
[1:19:27] are not belonging
[1:19:29] now what
[1:19:33] Moses if you'd have lived in the days of
[1:19:35] Moses you do have believed Moses Moses
[1:19:39] message
[1:19:40] after it had been proven and Vindicated
[1:19:42] by God
[1:19:44] but would you went with Korra and death
[1:19:46] and then and said
[1:19:49] you are not the only holy man
[1:19:54] think of it
[1:19:56] that's what God told Moses
[1:19:58] you are not the only holy man
[1:20:01] so if you do the same today that's
[1:20:05] exactly what you would have done in that
[1:20:08] same day
[1:20:09] other people can do these things that
[1:20:12] you do too
[1:20:13] see you'd have B you'd have to be one
[1:20:18] and you are one tonight
[1:20:21] so
[1:20:24] I won't be long
[1:20:28] I just want to remind you that we are a
[1:20:32] blessed people
[1:20:33] and God loves us so much
[1:20:38] that he has paid the price
[1:20:42] you have nothing to do as I mentioned
[1:20:45] earlier when you were yet dead in sin
[1:20:49] and trespasses
[1:20:52] he quickened you
[1:20:54] so what do you think he can do
[1:20:58] I told you try to go here in the
[1:21:01] cemetery talk to them
[1:21:05] if they can do something
[1:21:07] God has quickened you and he has given
[1:21:10] you all the power
[1:21:13] to lose or bind things here on Earth
[1:21:17] you're gonna do the same in heaven
[1:21:20] so you have that power right now
[1:21:25] as the prophet said how do you know that
[1:21:28] God loves you
[1:21:29] because he said so
[1:21:37] and when God loves me what else do I
[1:21:40] need
[1:21:42] what
[1:21:43] that's the most important thing you need
[1:21:45] the
[1:21:46] because when God loves you he surrounds
[1:21:50] you with all the cares you need from him
[1:21:54] nothing you can miss when God loves you
[1:21:58] don't look at what these eyes see look
[1:22:01] beyond the eyes
[1:22:03] look with the eyes of faith
[1:22:06] as I said about sister happy right she
[1:22:10] was poor
[1:22:12] even brother Branham when he
[1:22:14] when he that anointing
[1:22:16] he told her you can ask for money you
[1:22:19] can ask for a house you can ask for your
[1:22:22] sister that is sick here
[1:22:25] but this power came from God and she
[1:22:28] asked the right thing
[1:22:32] that cannot perish
[1:22:35] the salvation of her kids
[1:22:38] if you had asked for money
[1:22:41] it would have finished after some days
[1:22:44] but the Salvation did
[1:22:47] eternal
[1:22:49] so what are we looking for tonight
[1:22:53] are we looking to identify ourselves to
[1:22:59] Eternal character
[1:23:01] the character that will take us to our
[1:23:05] place of Eternal abode
[1:23:07] or we look to the world
[1:23:10] to be destroyed with this world because
[1:23:13] the world is going to pass
[1:23:15] but this word of God will live forever
[1:23:22] everything else will vanish that the way
[1:23:26] from eternity to Eternity it lives
[1:23:30] forever God bless you
[1:23:34] brother Billy
[1:23:40] should
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:44] that was refreshing a man amen is in the
[1:23:48] word of God beautiful amen
[1:23:51] my just a reminder
[1:23:53] you know
[1:23:56] as we're speaking you know
[1:23:59] when you really think about this
[1:24:02] identification
[1:24:03] even as the scripture is saying that let
[1:24:06] this mind that was in Christ be also in
[1:24:08] you
[1:24:09] mama there's so many often time we will
[1:24:13] place ourselves here and place the
[1:24:15] scripture here and try to compare well
[1:24:18] the word says this am I doing this the
[1:24:20] word says that am I doing this that's
[1:24:23] not the identification he's wanting you
[1:24:25] to do
[1:24:26] he wants you to identify with the word
[1:24:29] to understand that this is what's spoken
[1:24:31] of you
[1:24:32] when you read the Bible you're reading
[1:24:35] about yourself
[1:24:36] it's not something that that's outside
[1:24:39] of you remember varvanam says that you
[1:24:42] can never take a Kaka bird and make it a
[1:24:45] grain of wheat you can't do that you can
[1:24:48] never take something that's bone to be
[1:24:50] one and make it the other so therefore
[1:24:52] the it when you believe the word by the
[1:24:55] spirit as is spoken it's you you're
[1:24:58] identifying with what you are supposed
[1:25:00] to be in this hour it's not something
[1:25:03] outside of you you have to stop looking
[1:25:06] at it and say well I gotta be holy I
[1:25:09] gotta no Holiness is in you
[1:25:12] yeah that's right
[1:25:13] all of this characteristics is already
[1:25:16] in you because if it was in you God will
[1:25:19] not call for something that's not in you
[1:25:22] it's calling you to it because it's
[1:25:24] already you are the word you are what he
[1:25:27] has spoken and and I want you just you
[1:25:30] know to say something more when he's
[1:25:33] saying let this mind be in you that was
[1:25:35] in Christ
[1:25:36] and it continues on it says yet being in
[1:25:39] the form of the flesh or the form of man
[1:25:41] he taught it not robbery to be equal
[1:25:44] with God in other words he didn't take
[1:25:47] aside or judge himself to be lower than
[1:25:50] the spiritual things that were written
[1:25:52] in the Bible about him
[1:25:54] he didn't look at himself and say well
[1:25:56] I'm born In the Flesh and here I am and
[1:25:59] you know my mom is telling me that an
[1:26:01] angel told him and yet over here I'm
[1:26:03] hearing all this rumors that's not what
[1:26:05] he judged himself based on he took the
[1:26:08] word and he acted on it he went
[1:26:11] everywhere whatever the word Sadie will
[1:26:13] do he went and did it
[1:26:17] this is more powerful that we can
[1:26:19] understand I think we we sell ourselves
[1:26:23] short so for the tall for them because
[1:26:25] we look ourselves always through the
[1:26:27] lenses of the flesh you didn't come here
[1:26:29] because your flesh wanted to be here you
[1:26:32] you you are saved because you believe
[1:26:35] the word by the spirit the Spirit came
[1:26:39] and convicted you and you believed the
[1:26:41] word and if that's the way you came in
[1:26:44] that's the way you're gonna get till the
[1:26:46] end don't let your flesh get somewhere
[1:26:48] in between
[1:26:50] if you see yourself in the manner that's
[1:26:53] not bible-like say this is not me this
[1:26:57] is not what I was called to be that's
[1:26:59] what you have to look at and say this is
[1:27:00] not me I'm called to be what the Bible
[1:27:03] says I am I'm called to be what the word
[1:27:05] says I am and if you do that then you
[1:27:08] identifying a proper identification
[1:27:12] amen let's all stand I just I I don't
[1:27:16] know about you but every time the word
[1:27:17] comes it just stirs up something within
[1:27:20] you and say God I want to identify with
[1:27:22] what you call me to be
[1:27:24] amen amen let's keep our pastor in
[1:27:27] prayer I know
[1:27:29] you know he was able to preach this
[1:27:31] morning but we just want to make sure we
[1:27:32] continue to pray for him for that truth
[1:27:34] and amen that the Lord will continue to
[1:27:36] give him strength and take the pain away
[1:27:38] amen amen give me key of C amen amen
