sealed in a tomb it cannot be sealed all you say it's a sad time but i'm going to tell you at the side of a saint there's rejoicing why because you know it's not the end of the story amen i'm so glad this afternoon just trying to get his his heart for this evening i was just dealing you know i'm not really much of an evangelist i try to do whatever the lord asks i'm a pastor so i speak as a pastor a lot of times and tonight i know it's a wednesday and and i'm not talking about time i'm just talking about just want to allow god to talk to your hearts tonight you know i believe that you as a body that you had all of those things great great but if if our if our soul if our heart if we are not into christ heard the voice of god brother troy he he was john the baptist a prophet of god and he's seen all of the miracles and vindications of the word of god right he's seen the miracles he's seen all of those things yet somewhere along the way john's vision became blurred we find in matthew 11 2 it says now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto them art thou he that should come wait wait a minute did he not see already what who the christ was oh that well you gotta i'll tell you i thought that he i thought that he was the one now now now because he's questioned i guess he's out no john was the called prophet of god but john as a prophet of god had a moment of blurred vision aren't art thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which you or ye do hear and see go show him again what does that tell me brothers and sisters he'd already seen it you've already seen the manifestation of god you've already seen the vindication of his word you have seen the revealing word of god in this hour you have been blessed with the revelation and a vision that the world cannot have amen amen but i'm going to bring you back down to humanity and every now and then you're going to find yourself in a prison of life john didn't do anything wrong to be in that prison john john john wasn't uh he didn't deserve there if you would allow me to save brother david he he wasn't he didn't deserve to be there but he found there because of life he was actually doing the right thing he was actually serving god brothers and sisters he was you ever just said god i went to church god i've done this for you lord i've seen your vindications i've seen this why am i going through this lord i i prayed i read the word and i've done all of these things why am i going through this john hold on he didn't give up though because there was something in him that couldn't give up so he knew who to go ask what did what did he say go and show john again let's see what are we trying to look for something new to stir an emotion why are we trying to look for something new because we've left the word jesus didn't tell him go give him something new he said go show him again the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them this is not anything new this is the same word of god a vindication of the of the word of god and now john had a moment to be able to say that's the one i remember thank god so don't come to church discouraged when your vision is blurred but let god speak to you through the word of god that your vision can come open again think about it what brother branham says in 59 and who is this he says when the holy ghost come today it brings the same decisions each one of us are responsible for our decision oh it's not he did it or she made me do it or the devil didn't know we're responsible we must make it it's here by us it's here with us there's no way around it anymore there's nothing we can do about it we have to reject it or receive it listen there's no there's no uh if hands or buts about it you either are serving god or you're not if you are not fully surrendered to the power of god you are leaving yourself open to the enemy oh my the same life that was in christ jesus is in the church today it's performing the same works go and tell john again the things that i have done it's doing the same miracles it's doing everything that he did it's healing the sick raising the dead cleansing the lepers casting out devils preaching the gospel the poor is receiving blessed is he who is not offended brother brown says go show john he said these things that are done john in the prison his eagle eye had filmed over oh bless god we're an eagle yes but every now and then your eagle eye is gonna film over and you're gonna need to find your time with god again you're going to need to find your time with god to say lord i just just show me one more time i'll tell you john if john needed it i'm going to need it if brother branham needed it i'm going to need it hallelujah he said john in the prison his eagle i had filmed over his prophetic eye couldn't see like it once seen but then it could see when he said the lame walk the blind see the death here and blessed is he who is not offended in what i do and if i do not the works of my father then believe me not and if i do the works of my father if you can't believe me believe the works see he didn't belong caged up you don't belong caged up you need to be set free you need to be reminded and knowledge shall be increased you go to daniel 12 8 and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go that way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made wide and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand brothers and sisters what age are we living in we are living in brother branham tithe it has that eagle age what is that because god sent us that eagle messenger what the word comes to the prophet and what is he doing it's giving us a visual not just saying see daniel's seen far now please follow me i'm not belittling daniel but it wasn't time yet but i want you to look real quick what does it say even to until until what of the of the message [Music] are you oh boy if you love him don't you amen we fine but let this be our vision i wanna again i gotta get back to this i wanna encourage you tonight to ask god to clear my vision there is joy in him psalms 35 30 verse 5 for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning i said joy cometh in the morning if you if you don't believe it i'm just going to stand here and say it's the absolute truth i have had times of of just weeping oh god what what do you have for me what's going on all of these things and god has always proved his word time and time again hallelujah you know i i don't much get on with some of these things but being a pastor and and just you know you want to get the mind of god and i understand there's some pastors that just have it all figured out hallelujah to that maybe brother troy one day i'll get there but i don't have it all figured out i go day by day lord what do you have for me i want you to understand what i'm trying to say i i i don't doesn't mean i don't have confidence in god but i don't have all the answers and there are times things come our way and and and i'll never forget uh i was at family camp one that i think the first family came in over here in marshall area and uh and and i remember i was part of a prayer line and the first prayer line i was ever a part of in the sense of just you know so many together and things and and i was really excited about it i was just enjoying the camaraderie with the brothers brothers that i had never met before it was really refreshing to me and so at the end of the prayer line uh i i remember uh you know some of the ministers went through and i just thought to myself i said i'm going to not squat you know scorch this opportunity just to go before and just ask for a rededication for myself i don't think there's anything wrong with that so i went through and i asked for prayer and i remember god just really touching my heart and and this man comes up to me who i have no no idea at the time who he is i just know he was a minister and and you all know who he is he's actually going to minister now a part of my services brother danny steven he comes up to me for the uh and again i'm trying to point this out that god has a perfect way in many many avenues brother danny comes up to me and again i don't know who he is and i'm just you know glory hallelujah i'm going through that how many ever been that okay i hope so i was just i was on a cloud nine brother and he comes up and he says the lord just spoke to my heart and said for me to tell you that something's fixing to happen in your church and when it happens i want you to know that i will be with you and of course i'm sitting there going woo glory hallelujah you know i had no clue what was fixing to happen and i remember going home and we had some circumstances come up and and uh uh when the when the moment happened i remember going to the office in my office and i remember laying out on the floor and i was weeping so much uncontrollably before god god what did i do wrong lord where what you know i and i was placing all the i was placing it all on myself and forgetting the promises of god and and i was i was i was going through a john moment i was human i'm human and i was crying out before the lord lord what you know show me the way what did i do lord it's all my fault all of these things and all of a sudden in my heart he said remember i told you i'd be with you you never had just something you know you try to tell your kids dry it up and they don't dry it up well father god said dry it up and instantly it quickened in my heart this is that moment i stood up went over to my chair sat in that chair and i texted brother dan said brother danny what god spoke to you has happened and i want to say thank you for listening to the lord it's what i needed at that moment you see god had given at that moment now i want to tell you something that we don't live always for that you follow what i'm saying but god in our this hour does give us a vision and that there are times that god uses people in the assembly it doesn't always have to be a minister but have you ever just been sitting in the church and somebody was praying or somebody was sitting there and god began to deal with your heart would you just go and pray for him oh but then satan comes oh what will they think of me oh what about this what about that i'm going to tell you what that's the moment you immediately get up and you go do what god says to do god has given us an eagle vision let's use it for his glory you've got to be reminded that if god called you the song says he didn't bring us this far to leave us our vision must be renewed and i can tell you and i can brothers and sisters i can go time and time again where god where i was going through something as a pastor and god would send a minister or a pastor uh along my way and they would give me maybe maybe not even prophecy but that god would allow them to say something that would speak right to the moment and i'd be like god why why don't i learn why don't i learn that you're there you say why are you telling us this because i want you to know that we all go through these moments and no matter how many times god vindicates his word to us there's going to be times that we're going to be going through life and let me tell you god is telling you tonight to stop just stop for a moment come on stop martha martha stop it's time that we sit at the feet of jesus and just let them talk to us you know yes you were called to serve and you were called to do all of these things and you're doing a good job but we're getting consumed in it let's stop let's let's not be consumed in trying to figure it all out let's not be trying to be consumed listen i'm not telling you to not be be a servant anymore you know what i'm saying i'm not telling you not to do things for god but don't be so consumed by it that we miss our opportunity with god renew our vision tonight let us sit at your feet let us stop fighting a fight that's already been won let's put our swords away and quit fighting other brothers and sisters and let's come together in unity why because our vision must be renewed well we don't see eye to eye i get that we have differences and i understand that there are false doctrines don't get me wrong and we've got to stand on the word for those things but let's not be let's be careful be careful that we don't get so caught up fighting that we lose sight of his mercies come on martha that wasn't premeditated but i just felt that let's stop for a minute god sees what you're doing god knows your heart god knows how much you love him he knows how much you want to serve and he knows what you're doing is hard and and there's a lot going on and there's struggles and there's things and you feel worn out and you're tired and all of these things he's reminding you tonight stop tonight this is your moment to just sit where you're at and let the word prick your heart and just say god i trust you renew my vision don't just do because you have to do you need to get that vision back in there god i'm doing this for you but don't lose sight of his love god hebrews 16 god is more willing go away in god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath can i read this in a different uh and a different uh i don't know what the word is that i'm thinking of here but god wanted to prove that his promise was true he wanted to prove this to those who would get what he promised he wanted them to understand clearly i don't want to just be here tonight and say oh i understand and still have a clouded vision but he said i have sent to you a message i have sent to you a messenger that clearly vindicated my word he did not pull you from the word of god he pointed you to the word of god anybody can have this bible but you've got to be an eagle to see it clearly lord let it be a clear vision to this church let it be a clear vision to the bride of jesus christ let us rise up from our playing and all of the things of the word and come back to the word of god let there be a vision in the body of jesus christ lord i want to see your word more clearly not because i want to outdo you not because i want to out preach you not because i want to out vision you or out to prophesy you or out tongue you or outward you but because we need to bind together with the word of god we as eagles need to help other eagles out you know there's going to be times eagles are on the ground there's going to be times eagles are on the fence and they've just been fighting and bickering and going against one another and they're weak they don't have the strength i believe that there would be an eagle tonight that would fly over them and throw them down some meat of the word of god oh i'm going to tell you what there have been times that i was on the ground brother troy i was struggling i i didn't know brother david where to go from there i didn't know what to do and i was weak i couldn't soar the heights brother but i'm so glad somebody came along and threw me down some meat and i had a choice then brothers and sisters whether i was gonna eat it or not listen meat is not always liv you know we have to be careful we need to encourage one another and not put one another down it's not about going to someone and say you just need a little more faith that's not meat that's flesh you'll just put it where you want to put it there it's the same same but it's not the same but we need to come and say i want you to know that you can make it you're a son you're a daughter of god it's time that we get out of the ground off the ground of circumstance start eating back on this word come on put on oh some of the message of the word of god hear that voice crying out again calling you from that barnyard calling you from those doubts and calling you to a hype that no other bird was intended listen they know you can see something they know you have something but they can't figure it out and you can't make them figure it out and we should never come to a point where we put them down either you never seen your prophet do that let our vision have purpose tonight isaiah 40 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength i don't know about you but that does something for me why because i have found myself brother davey in a moment of weakness and doubt and question and i was weak and i needed it but the word says he's going to give power to me even the use shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they listen this is more than a song but they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not thank god renew our vision tonight you say you you may be weary tonight from the journey and listen i'm not just putting any amount of discouragement on you but i believe that there's times that we've got to be real with one another that we need a refreshing and i want you to know that i am not dealing with just the emotion of your flesh but that soul needs a refreshing and it's got to be more than a song it's got to be more than just a a a moment of prayer of laying on of hands i'm not getting rid of those things i still believe in those things but it's got to be something what happened to the word of god being ministered and they were pricked in their hearts they were pricked why because they were told you were the ones that crucified him you were the ones that were in error you know there was other times in the bible just speaking about this with brother davey there were other times in the bible as well where they were pricked in their hearts and then there became gnashing of teeth who are you brother david to preach that word of god well i'm brother david and i've been called to preach it now listen if brother david gets off the word then what were you going to do you're going to go tell everyone about it or you're going to pray for him i hope you don't mind me using you brother david i'm going to go into anyhow and then you can crucify me for it later that's what we're doing what happened to getting on our knees and praying for the ministry what happened we're getting on our knees i'm praying for the song leader and the musicians hey we're we're human we make mistakes we sometimes get in our listen i want to remind you in case you forgot just ask your spouse to slap you one time and you will be reminded that you are a human being and if you don't have a spouse don't ask me i'll come and slap you right now to remind you that you are a human being and you're gonna hurt and you hurt and you have pain and you have agony so you are in the flesh that did hurt you're in the flesh oh but bless god yes bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name but none of this blessed god religious mentality and attitude you're human you are a man in need of a savior you are a sister in need of a savior we are a church in need of a savior and it doesn't hurt to come before him and say god i just need a refreshing i i've been getting my eyes off of the promise listen john didn't john did not leave can i allow me to say john didn't leave the message john john didn't want to walk away john john i believe john's heart was right would you just bear with me i believe those things but he got clouded his vision got clouded and he just needed to be reminded that he was the one and so i don't care how many times you've had your cloud 9 moments and how many times the word has been revealed to you as long as you're in this flesh you're still going to need moments of renewal you're going to need moments and times of reminding god i just need to know that you're there and that's why the song leading is there that's why the worship is there that's why songs are there to remind us of his blessings and what he's done and when the word is coming forth it's what is it doing it's reminding us of all of the things of god you may be weary tonight from your journey but god knows it i think very shortly ver very quickly of two men that were walking on the road to emmaus and we find that these two men as they were walking on the road to emmaus that they actually were leaving what they were told to do brother branham uses it in a sign he said they were backsliding we only remember and i don't remember the name right now but we remember that there's one name that was mentioned i think it was cleopas we don't know the other one so really when it comes down to it they were really an unknown they're really unknown brother josh they just they just i mean who were these two men and i wanted to read i want to leave you with this i want you to i want you to know because satan likes to make you feel like you're inadequate like you're nothing you've been at times of backsliding sitting in a pew listening to the word of god and because of circumstances because it didn't go the way you thought it did we should have you started walking away notice when they were walking away they were still talking about them so their heart was still wanting it to be true but they had because of their haste because it didn't happen as quick as they thought it would happen because it didn't happen in their plan as they thought it should be they were discouraged and they were walking away and then all of a sudden in fact i believe it was even mentioned in the prayer tonight when we leave this place we can say did not our hearts burn within us she walked and talked with us along the way brother troy two backsliding men walking away on the greatest day brother matthew of history you say what do you mean the greatest day of history without resurrection we wouldn't be here today on the greatest day of history when jesus could have went to the the king's palaces and said i told you so when he could have went anywhere he and he could have been in the palaces and he could have been here and he could have been there but he showed up to two sorrowing souls on the greatest day of history don't tell me he won't be here for you tonight he loves you he cares for you and even in a sorrowing soul in a moment he will walk out of the bushes and say what's the matter that's my god he knows your moment he knows what you're going through and he could have said well you should have stayed and because you're walking away i'm not going to show up but he listen he knows who you are he knows your needs and he's stepping out tonight and he's one to commune with you and he began to ask them what's going on and they begin to preach him a sermon in their backsliding they begin to tell them have you not been here you see that's not how they said it brother jeremy i don't know i'm just being evangelistical have you not seen have you not been here well tell me and they begin to tell them what it was now notice something here he he could have just immediately went in and said oh you know oh you know and open their eyes but he had to correct their error oh fools slow i believe of heart and he began to go what did he begin to do he began to go through the scriptures and remind them wait wait when jesus does something he does it he does the same way what did he do to john go and remind him what i've done what did he do with their disciples even in their backsliding even in their despair when it didn't happen as quick as they thought it should happen that's a problem we get ahead of god let's stay with the word of god let's stand on his word listen if god has promised you something and it's from his word stand upon his word and don't get ahead of his promise stay with the word of the hour but then he once he corrected their problem you see if we can't cr if we can't have correction in the church you're you're it's i'm going to just say advil ain't fixing it it's only masking it come on you can't have an advil church and a church be healed you've got to allow the surgeon to come in and you just can't look at the face of the guy that's standing up here and say well it's only brother david it's it's only this one and it's only that one no you have to pray god i know that you're dealing with me because circumcision of the heart is still a real thing and once he corrected oh hallelujah once he corrected once he reminded them and then he begin to break the bread just as he had done before and their eyes were opened and they knew him oh let our eyes be opened tonight break the bread lord like you've done it before let there be correction in the church if there's something that's wrong in my life lord i wanted to be corrected i'm tired of masking the problem no more pretending tonight i want to be honest with you tonight lord i want to be real i am a man in need of a savior i need you lord why because my hope is in you lord renew our vision proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision the people perish you've got to have eagle vision you've got to have that eagle vision an eagle that cannot just see further but an eagle that can see it clearly now oh well brother jeremy i don't understand it all let me say i don't understand everything but oh boy make sense of this if you want to i but i understand it what what do you understand i understand that he's got it all in control and again it's more than a song he's got it all in control it's time that we just spread our wings tonight slow down musicians can come as we bow our heads this might not be for everybody maybe it's just for me would you slow down just slow down stop for a minute see what god can do we're if we're not careful i pray that you take this understanding if we're not careful eliezer's been telling us all about our isaac and all we're concerned about is walking around the tent and making sure that it's sealed and making sure there's no bugs and making sure that it's this and making sure that it's that instead of actually looking to our isaac and going into the tent would you slow down tonight stop take a breath [Music] he's got it you can't keep trying to make it work he's got it [Music] church he's got you in the palm of his hand before you were born he knew you he knew the first moment your heart began to beat and the first breath you took he knew you you didn't become a son when you came to the altar the first time you recognized who you were he's always had you you've always been his so why are we trying to make it all work stop tonight john remember his promise remember what he's done i'm not going to work with your emotions tonight but i want to ask you as your heads are bowed and your eyes are closed just talking to the lord as he pricked your heart this evening you say brother jeremy i'm going to be honest with you and i want to pray with you where you're at lord brother jeremy would you pray with me that my vision will become clear maybe i need to slow down maybe i need to stop maybe i just need to be reminded just be honest with god thank you [Music] lord jesus you've seen the hands that were raised the hearts that are standing lord lord you've come tonight and you've stepped out of the bushes and you're walking with us and you're talking with us along the way our hearts are burning lord but we need our vision opened we need to be reminded that it's you all along the message of this hour has been you all along that voice crying out lord has been you speaking through him catching our attention it's been you all along and our hearts are burning but our eyes lord have been clouded because of circumstance because we're weary we've got sickness we've got life we've got our jobs we've got our problems we've got our health we all of these things lord our questions uh lord what do you want from me what do you where what should i do lord who should i marry who should i this and who should

we're talking it over with the lord but it's a one-sided conversation it's like going to the doctor and you tell them what's wrong with you and then you tell them how you want them to treat it [Music] you know and you know a lot of years i've had a lot of people sit in my office with troubles and problems and so many times i've come to realize that all they need is [Music] a trip to the burning bush nothing else to offer just go to the bush take a moment in his presence don't say nothing [Music] just be there a while it can fix so many things but just to take a moment you know before he gets
