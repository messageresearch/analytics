[29:18] our heavenly father's been your grace
[29:22] we don't stand here by merits
[29:24] we're not here for our good works or our
[29:28] kindness or anything that we've done
[29:31] but it's been your pure grace lord
[29:34] amazing grace that you speak this out
[29:36] from the death lord from the
[29:39] to set our feet on the rock to stay lord
[29:43] we changed our garments from garments of
[29:45] shame
[29:46] and you gave us a new robe which is that
[29:49] word lord
[29:50] you took away our pride and you give us
[29:52] humility or
[29:54] you took away lord our high-mindedness
[29:57] and you led us to walk lord neatly
[29:59] before your face
[30:01] so tonight again i recognize as a man
[30:04] that lord there's nothing that i have
[30:06] nothing i can do but lord i turn to the
[30:09] cross of calvary
[30:11] because lord here's your purchased
[30:14] possession
[30:15] and i'm aware that only you can speak to
[30:17] their hearts and their needs so i pray
[30:19] that you help me step aside and let the
[30:22] holy ghost take control lord
[30:25] because their needs are your concerns
[30:28] lord your cries are in your ears lord so
[30:31] i pray that you be the one that speaks
[30:33] to us tonight
[30:35] thank you for good and david and his
[30:36] heart and the burden for the people or
[30:38] that we can be edified i pray that only
[30:41] be rewarded i pray that my contribution
[30:44] be effective
[30:45] for the glory of your name bless your
[30:47] people tonight
[30:48] we ask you in the name of the lord jesus
[30:50] christ
[30:52] amen
[30:53] you may be seated for a moment
[30:56] god bless you tonight
[30:59] i
[31:00] i've been trying to escape this moment
[31:03] but uh
[31:04] i would not be
[31:06] i was not very successful
[31:08] and where david been last time he
[31:12] called me in the office i was trying to
[31:13] run out he said come come come come
[31:16] and i said i thought well we're gonna
[31:17] meet out there he didn't even let me get
[31:19] out he said where moses i want you to
[31:21] give me your schedule
[31:23] and i thought in my hand i said i won't
[31:25] be a good thing
[31:26] i give her david the schedule i guess
[31:29] not much i can change about that because
[31:31] he's sure gonna just
[31:32] set it up
[31:34] so i've been telling christians i said i
[31:36] need to give birth david the schedule he
[31:38] said when you gonna do it
[31:40] i said soon
[31:42] and so the day i just came to church and
[31:45] i was about to leave again and i just
[31:46] disappeared as usual
[31:49] and i told him i said i want to go home
[31:50] and pick up my missionary bag and head
[31:52] to wichita falls
[31:54] and i we're getting ready i said drop me
[31:57] off real quick cause i got to be there
[31:58] by four o'clock and before we got to the
[32:01] house my phone rang and i
[32:04] said who's this and where b was calling
[32:06] me
[32:06] he said where you brother moses i said
[32:08] hmm
[32:10] i said well i'm already gone bro billy
[32:13] said well bro david looking for you i
[32:15] said oh oh
[32:17] and he said well just hold on a minute
[32:19] i knew what that meant
[32:21] oh man i got to talk to brad david
[32:24] and he said you're running away from me
[32:26] i said no sir
[32:29] he said well
[32:30] he's gonna do me something good if he
[32:31] preached tonight
[32:34] well
[32:35] i didn't say anything in the morning but
[32:37] today is my birthday
[32:45] when i woke up in the morning today he's
[32:47] my he's my roommate
[32:49] i got up i said christian i just feel
[32:51] good in my soul i told him i said i
[32:53] don't know what all's gonna happen but
[32:55] i'm just happy
[32:57] i said man i just feel so good i say i
[32:59] don't know what god's gonna do but i
[33:01] just feel real happy
[33:04] and the lord has been good to us
[33:06] because i can tell you for a fact that
[33:08] god spoke to me this morning
[33:11] god spoke to me by his word
[33:13] and he let me see some things in his
[33:15] word
[33:16] that just helps us to know that we are
[33:18] not living here this is not our home
[33:21] we are just passing through we cannot
[33:23] forget ourselves here
[33:25] i'm thankful to god for my friend
[33:27] christian that you see here
[33:30] i just want to give a short testimony
[33:32] he may not like it but i have to give
[33:34] the testimony
[33:36] christian and i went to high school
[33:37] about 15 years ago
[33:39] in cameroon africa
[33:42] and at the time i
[33:43] my dad is a preacher as a pastor for a
[33:46] long time we're basically born in a
[33:48] church
[33:49] but i never i told myself i said this
[33:52] message thing and this christian people
[33:54] their stuff is for them it's not for me
[33:56] it's for the old people
[33:58] that's what i thought in my mind
[34:00] you know your plans are one thing and
[34:02] god's plan is another thing
[34:04] and so as i got in the world i just i
[34:06] would go to church but i would not have
[34:08] any experience with god but yet i went
[34:11] to church
[34:12] and then i
[34:13] started dating a young lady that was
[34:15] christian's best friend
[34:17] and she was my girlfriend and
[34:20] christian was her best friend
[34:23] and one of christian's best friends
[34:24] really liked my girlfriend
[34:27] and so chris she he talked to christian
[34:29] and christian was trying to get them
[34:31] hooked up
[34:32] so me and christian didn't get along
[34:33] very good
[34:35] because i i i didn't like this guy
[34:37] trying to
[34:39] take away my girlfriend from me
[34:41] so me and christian didn't
[34:43] we didn't go together we can't even walk
[34:45] together
[34:47] but you know
[34:48] when the lord
[34:49] came to me in 2009 in january i was
[34:53] sitting in the back of the church
[34:55] because i always thought you know if you
[34:56] said in the back the word of god is not
[34:58] going to hit you very hard like the
[35:00] people in the front so i knew i wasn't
[35:03] right i'm not saying those in the back
[35:04] you're not good don't don't take it
[35:06] wrong
[35:06] but i was sitting in the back because i
[35:08] said well by the time the word of god
[35:10] get to me it's going to kind of dilute
[35:14] you know but that's my thinking
[35:16] but that's not what the word of god says
[35:19] it says the word of god is quick and
[35:22] powerful
[35:25] sharper than a two-edged sword
[35:28] said dividing asunder even to the joints
[35:33] and as a deserter of the thoughts and
[35:35] this
[35:36] of the infants of the heart of man
[35:38] hebrews 4 12. so the word of god is not
[35:40] less powerful in the back of the hallway
[35:44] and i was sitting back there
[35:47] and the pastor was preaching my dad i
[35:49] said well we had a party at ten o'clock
[35:52] and he kept preaching and preaching and
[35:54] preaching i said man
[35:56] does he not know we got other things to
[35:57] do
[35:59] why is he preaching long like this it's
[36:00] friday night friday night usually short
[36:02] that's what i planned it tonight
[36:05] and he just kept going
[36:08] so i said well 9 30 if he's not done i'm
[36:11] gone
[36:13] lo and behold
[36:15] nine o'clock
[36:17] the lord came back there i was sitting
[36:18] there he said you got to repent you're
[36:20] sinner
[36:22] so i look around me i said who's talking
[36:23] to me like that
[36:25] nobody he's preaching over there
[36:28] but the same word of god that was in the
[36:30] front is the same word of god that was
[36:33] in the back
[36:35] so i looked around and i said maybe it's
[36:36] just my mind playing me some tricks i'm
[36:38] gonna be okay i'll just continue on
[36:41] so you have to repent you are a sinner
[36:44] so i said let me just make a i just sat
[36:46] back here in canada
[36:48] he said nope you have been living a
[36:50] double life before these people
[36:53] make it right the right way
[36:55] and i said what
[36:57] so i took a little paper and i said i
[36:58] have a testimony
[37:00] when the deacon saw the note he said you
[37:02] have a testimony
[37:04] because i never used to be in the front
[37:06] church is over i'm gone
[37:09] so he's shocked this young man has a
[37:10] testimony
[37:12] so when i go to the front even know what
[37:14] i was gonna say
[37:16] all i remember was my shirt was wet
[37:19] my pants was wet
[37:21] and i was crying out to god for
[37:23] salvation
[37:26] and the lord came i remember my dad he
[37:28] was standing in the back he started
[37:30] crying he said lord
[37:32] i thank you because salvation has come
[37:35] to my house
[37:36] and i said so he knew all along i wasn't
[37:38] safe
[37:40] and i looked on the right side and i saw
[37:42] my mom
[37:43] she was doing like this
[37:46] i said i think she's done praying for
[37:48] salvation for me now she can go to the
[37:50] next prayer topic
[37:52] because she sure was praying for the
[37:54] lord to rescue me out of the hands of
[37:56] the devil
[37:57] and she never gave up
[38:00] moms don't give up
[38:02] dads don't give up
[38:04] it may look like it's gonna be over it's
[38:07] not over
[38:09] amen
[38:10] so when the lord came and rescued me and
[38:12] saved me from sin it started changing my
[38:14] life so everything that i like to do had
[38:16] to change too
[38:19] i said well i know i can still have my
[38:20] girlfriend i'm gonna convert her we'll
[38:22] just go to church together and then
[38:27] thank you brother i didn't have no luck
[38:29] on that one
[38:33] i said lord what am i gonna do now
[38:35] because i don't know how to tell all
[38:37] this stuff and i know i can we can't
[38:39] live the way we used to live before
[38:42] i didn't have the words i said well
[38:44] i'm gonna pray
[38:46] i started praying
[38:48] praying no appetite to eat no more
[38:50] because i had a burden on my heart i had
[38:52] to get it out
[38:54] and i stopped praying say lord give me
[38:56] the words give me the courage give me
[38:58] the time
[39:00] so one wednesday i know the lord gave me
[39:02] the courage you gave me the words to
[39:04] give me the time
[39:05] i went to when that time were in college
[39:07] i went to school i said hey you know
[39:08] what i got to talk to you for a minute
[39:10] he said okay we sat down we started
[39:12] talking
[39:14] i told her i said the lord came to my
[39:15] life not long ago
[39:18] and something has changed
[39:20] so i i we cannot live like we used to
[39:23] it's either you're gonna serve the lord
[39:25] with me
[39:26] or we just have to part our ways
[39:29] he said well we can you just do some
[39:31] christian dating type thing i say ah but
[39:34] we cannot do the things we used to do
[39:36] before
[39:37] we have to go by what the word of god
[39:39] said
[39:40] she said well you're kidding
[39:43] when she looked at me in my eyes
[39:45] she said you're not kidding
[39:47] and she started crying
[39:49] and that was over
[39:52] and that was it
[39:54] so the lord really gave me the words the
[39:55] time and the courage
[39:57] if you ask us for anything he'll give it
[39:59] to you
[40:01] and so when i traveled over here the
[40:03] lord saved me in january i traveled in
[40:05] july
[40:07] i come with still good friends so she
[40:08] texts me oh my friend christian is in
[40:10] florida i said what i don't want to hear
[40:12] about christian
[40:14] first of all he's the one who was trying
[40:15] to get you hooked up with that other guy
[40:18] and now you're telling me he's in
[40:19] florida what do i have to do with him
[40:21] she said well just look for him i said
[40:23] okay so i went to see my sister in
[40:25] florida i said where's that friend of
[40:27] yours anyway
[40:29] he gave me his address his phone number
[40:31] i called him
[40:32] and i go to visit him
[40:34] so we just started talking you know just
[40:36] talking and everything i said well my
[40:38] sister lives here if you don't mind just
[40:39] i'll show you where she lives
[40:41] and so i took her there and he and my
[40:44] sister became even closer than sometimes
[40:46] myself
[40:48] they call she calls him like his son
[40:50] they talk on the phone all the time and
[40:52] i kind of got jealous a little bit
[40:55] but god knows what he does
[40:57] and they invited him to church
[41:00] in florida so he went to church
[41:02] one year two years sometime over there
[41:04] just looking around
[41:07] and
[41:08] he was struggling because he didn't have
[41:09] a residence in the united states and he
[41:12] had played the diversity lottery program
[41:14] and he is waiting for nancy so he sent
[41:16] his a prayer request the voice of god
[41:18] said pray for me um doing this thing and
[41:21] that so they prayed for him then he got
[41:23] it
[41:24] he became a resident
[41:25] so he said this y'all's god is kind of
[41:27] serious
[41:29] y'all's god is kind of real
[41:32] so you kept going to church
[41:35] and one day my sister calls me
[41:37] she said moses
[41:39] your friend christian
[41:41] is getting baptized sunday
[41:44] and my heart i said
[41:46] lord i could never have imagined what
[41:49] you're going to do
[41:52] look at where we started
[41:54] look at where we are now
[41:56] now he's not only my brother in christ
[41:59] he's my friend
[42:01] he's my roommate
[42:03] the guy i didn't want to see before
[42:07] is god not great
[42:10] our god
[42:12] he's an awesome god erased
[42:17] from heaven above with wisdom
[42:22] and power lord our god is an awesome god
[42:28] so you're seeing a testimony right there
[42:32] amen
[42:33] here's my brother i love him i just
[42:35] wanted to share that
[42:37] next testimony

[45:59] something isn't right i know how i feel
[46:02] now i didn't want to be sick but i won't
[46:04] lie to myself either
[46:06] so i wasn't looking for sickness but i
[46:08] knew how i felt
[46:09] you have to be honest with yourself
[46:12] don't go about saying i denied the
[46:13] disease you're already sick brother
[46:16] that's why god is a healer
[46:19] don't say oh i refuse this sickness i no
[46:22] that's not what he said
[46:25] if you're sick go to him say lord i'm
[46:27] sick give me healing
[46:29] if you're not sick you don't need a
[46:30] healer
[46:31] so i said i called my hospital i said

[52:14] become negligent because of that no sir
[52:18] but we thank god for the things that he
[52:21] does to help our faith
[52:24] let's not take too much time
[52:26] it's not my fault of the services longer
[52:28] david said
[52:31] he said it i asked him i said birthday
[52:34] so let's just read the word of god we're
[52:36] not going to be long
[52:38] god will bless us this evening amen
[52:44] let's open our bibles in the book of
[52:46] john chapter 17
[52:49] and i can promise you i'm not going to
[52:50] say something new that you've not heard
[52:53] i'm not going to bring you anything
[52:55] strange
[52:56] i'll only say what has been said already
[52:59] because it's like bro david said in the
[53:01] morning
[53:02] is to bring to our remembrance the
[53:05] stirring up of her mind amen
[53:08] and that's my desire tonight that the
[53:09] lord would just bless us again
[53:12] i want us to just read in the book of
[53:14] john chapter 17
[53:16] and we're going to read from verse 14 to
[53:18] verse 18 and ask the lord for his
[53:20] blessing on the word
[53:24] this is what the word says
[53:26] i have given them thy word
[53:29] and the world hath hated them
[53:32] because they are not of the world
[53:34] even as i am not of the world
[53:38] i pray not for that thou should take
[53:41] them out of the world
[53:43] but that thou should keep them from the
[53:46] evil
[53:47] they are not of the world
[53:49] even as i am not of the world he said
[53:53] that twice
[53:55] sanctified them through thy word
[53:58] thy word is truth
[54:01] as thou has sent me into the world
[54:04] even so have i also sent them into the
[54:08] world
[54:09] lord jesus hears thy word that prophet
[54:11] said to turn the pages it requires a
[54:13] human hand but for the opening of the
[54:15] scriptures it takes the holy spirit
[54:18] so holy spirit lord take control and
[54:20] help us
[54:21] bless your people tonight in the name of
[54:23] jesus christ we pray amen
[54:26] god bless you you may be seated
[54:29] as we
[54:30] try to find
[54:33] something here in the word of god do you
[54:35] love the lord
[54:37] it's a blessing to be in the house of
[54:38] god
[54:39] david said
[54:41] one day in your house is better than a
[54:44] thousand elsewhere so why do people not
[54:47] want to come to church
[54:50] good question right
[54:52] one day in your house is better than a
[54:55] thousand elsewhere
[54:59] now let's do some math
[55:01] a little bit of math
[55:03] if you work a full-time job 40 hours a
[55:06] week you work five days a week eight
[55:09] hours
[55:11] church we have church three times
[55:14] three days a week
[55:16] one wednesday
[55:17] it's tuesday
[55:19] night and then there's service
[55:22] sunday morning sunday night
[55:24] now if we take the work hours compared
[55:27] to the church hours
[55:29] you work 40 hours
[55:31] do we go to church 40 hours
[55:34] but nobody missed work
[55:39] hey man
[55:40] we only come to church a couple of hours
[55:42] per service so if you do the ratio is
[55:45] like
[55:46] 40 on maybe let's say eight hours let's
[55:49] just say eight hours that's too much
[55:50] you're still not
[55:52] that's 32 hours working
[55:56] over
[55:57] spending time in the house of god
[55:59] but that's not the subject tonight
[56:02] but just so we can enjoy coming to the
[56:05] house of god
[56:06] amen
[56:08] i was in wichita falls
[56:10] with one brother in the church for two
[56:12] years
[56:13] me and him
[56:15] only
[56:18] some people say oh brother you speak
[56:19] spanish wonderful that's where god put
[56:21] me to school
[56:22] to learn spanish
[56:25] me and one brother he preached i said
[56:27] amen
[56:28] amen
[56:30] one day my mom came to visit me when i
[56:32] graduated and she came to the church
[56:34] there was only two cars outside
[56:37] so when i saw her walking and she was
[56:39] looking all over the place
[56:41] she sat down after trick i said mom why
[56:44] are you looking everywhere like that
[56:46] she said well when i came here and i
[56:47] always saw two cars outside
[56:50] but when i was coming in
[56:52] you always sing it like there was a
[56:53] thousand people in here
[56:55] i said mom you're making a mistake
[56:58] because the bible said where two or
[57:00] three would gather in his name he would
[57:02] come
[57:04] and does god walk alone
[57:07] she said son i never thought about it
[57:08] like that i said yep
[57:10] my god is not alone
[57:12] where two or three gather in his name he
[57:15] comes there with the host of heaven
[57:18] brother when you come into church come
[57:20] expecting to meet god
[57:23] come expecting to have an encounter with
[57:25] god come expecting that god would use
[57:28] whoever is standing here to speak to
[57:30] your life
[57:32] when somebody goes to the hospital and
[57:34] he's sick his expectation is that on
[57:37] this charge he's going home healed
[57:40] now if he goes home sick either there
[57:42] was a quack doctor or he didn't take the
[57:44] prescription
[57:46] two things
[57:49] but the doctor you are coming to me
[57:51] tonight is called doctor jesus
[57:54] he needs a resume there's no failures
[57:59] i used to walk on the cardiac floor and
[58:01] the patient would say oh i want doctor
[58:03] this because i heard he's a very good
[58:04] doctor i said sister hey i was taking my
[58:07] money if you open up his resume you're
[58:09] gonna find some cases where he didn't
[58:10] cut the vein right
[58:13] you're gonna find some people maybe he
[58:14] passed away from his surgery
[58:16] so he's not a hundred percent
[58:19] i said about the jesus i know
[58:23] he does surgery without no incisions
[58:26] hallelujah
[58:28] he does diagnosis without no blood draw
[58:31] brother
[58:33] a lady come to the prophet she's
[58:35] standing there she had a free blood draw
[58:38] she had a free lab test
[58:41] and his calories said oh sister you're
[58:43] not sick you got a potassium deficiency
[58:46] what time did he draw the blood sent to
[58:48] the lab pass through the machine get the
[58:50] result
[58:53] [Applause]
[58:55] my patients don't want to get stuck
[58:57] and so you coming again
[59:00] yeah i got to get some blood because the
[59:02] the lab needs some to find how much
[59:04] potassium you've got
[59:06] but god gives you free lab tests
[59:12] he scans you and say you're not sick you
[59:14] only have a potassium deficiency
[59:18] that would have taken a doctor's
[59:19] appointment
[59:20] a referral to the lab a blood draw sent
[59:24] for the sample check it out lab
[59:26] technician send the result back to the
[59:27] doctor he reads it sends it to the nurse
[59:29] nurse tell the patient do you know how
[59:31] long that takes
[59:35] but right there
[59:38] they get their
[59:41] they get their skin they get their lab
[59:43] tests they get the result they get the
[59:46] solution right there
[59:48] that is dr jesus now that's the kind of
[59:52] god you came to meet tonight
[59:54] you didn't come to symbolic moses i
[59:55] cannot help you don't you know me for
[59:57] all these years what have i done for you
[1:00:03] but the one that you're coming to me
[1:00:06] hallelujah
[1:00:08] his name
[1:00:09] is the mighty conqueror
[1:00:11] [Applause]
[1:00:13] so what kind of expectation should you
[1:00:15] be coming sunday morning sunday night
[1:00:18] wednesday even in your room when you go
[1:00:20] down to pray what kind of expectation
[1:00:22] should you have
[1:00:25] the brother said when you pray it
[1:00:27] doesn't bring god down no
[1:00:29] it brings you up
[1:00:31] so you can get in his presence
[1:00:34] and you can talk to him
[1:00:37] oh hallelujah that's not even the the
[1:00:40] subject tonight
[1:00:43] my brother said we'll be pulling brother
[1:00:45] i think they're pulling hard now
[1:00:48] god help me help me
[1:00:50] jesus says
[1:00:53] i have given them thy word and the world
[1:00:56] has hated them
[1:00:59] so you are not hated because of anything
[1:01:01] else but the word
[1:01:03] now is not for the knowledge of the word
[1:01:06] that you are hated no sir
[1:01:08] you are hated because when the world
[1:01:10] comes to your life
[1:01:12] the world changes you
[1:01:14] the world makes you a different being
[1:01:17] you begin to speak different you begin
[1:01:20] to act different and your actions go
[1:01:23] against the actions of the world
[1:01:26] because they have another wisdom like
[1:01:28] where they say this morning
[1:01:29] they have their intelligence their
[1:01:31] wisdom their modern things technology
[1:01:34] and those things influence them
[1:01:38] and they are living out the result of
[1:01:41] the influence
[1:01:43] now when you accept the word jesus said
[1:01:46] the word that i speak to you they have
[1:01:48] two characteristics
[1:01:50] they are spirit and their life
[1:01:54] so when those words come into your being
[1:01:56] they begin to produce within you a life
[1:02:01] brother peter went to church every day
[1:02:03] with jesus he didn't know that
[1:02:05] unconsciously he was being changed
[1:02:09] till one day
[1:02:11] when he went where he refused jesus they
[1:02:14] told him you're with him said no i don't
[1:02:16] know that guy
[1:02:19] then afterwards they say hey
[1:02:22] you're with him he said no something you
[1:02:24] speak like them
[1:02:30] so every day while he went to church
[1:02:33] his language was being changed
[1:02:37] hallelujah
[1:02:39] it was happening unconsciously
[1:02:42] but the people that saw the difference
[1:02:45] was those who were in the world
[1:02:48] your speech is different
[1:02:50] why do you wear a long skirt like that
[1:02:53] why do you let your hair grow
[1:02:55] why
[1:02:56] it's because you have received the word
[1:03:00] and that word would not give you peace
[1:03:02] in the ways of the world
[1:03:06] that word will keep you in line even
[1:03:08] when you desire to go against it it will
[1:03:11] bring you back
[1:03:15] it's a life
[1:03:17] and it's struggling to express itself
[1:03:21] hallelujah it's there
[1:03:23] he's looking to pass through the cracks
[1:03:26] of the concrete
[1:03:27] to come out
[1:03:30] and there's nothing can stop it
[1:03:34] there's nothing can hold it
[1:03:36] it's going against every odd
[1:03:39] it must manifest itself
[1:03:44] he said i have given them that word and
[1:03:46] the world has hated them so if they hate
[1:03:49] you now you know why
[1:03:53] they hate you for the cause of the word
[1:03:56] of
[1:03:56] god and he's the reason he says because
[1:04:00] they are not
[1:04:01] of the world
[1:04:04] and he
[1:04:05] he relates why they are not always
[1:04:06] saying even as i
[1:04:10] hallelujah so you are not of the world
[1:04:14] because even as he
[1:04:17] is not of the world meaning
[1:04:20] you and him were somewhere before
[1:04:24] hallelujah
[1:04:26] meaning
[1:04:28] you are not here by heroin by chance
[1:04:31] god knew the color of the clothes you're
[1:04:33] going to wear tonight he knew where you
[1:04:36] are going to be sitting he knew the
[1:04:38] shoes you would wear he knew you would
[1:04:40] say amen to the word
[1:04:44] he said even as i am not of the world
[1:04:48] they too
[1:04:49] are not of the world so the question is
[1:04:53] if you are not of the world
[1:04:55] what are you from
[1:04:59] that is a player he was praying
[1:05:02] but in the prayer he hides your your
[1:05:05] origin
[1:05:07] in the prayer he hides the place where
[1:05:09] you came from
[1:05:12] so everybody can read it oh let's be one
[1:05:14] i said we should be one but they don't
[1:05:16] even see
[1:05:18] inside their prayer the lord has hidden
[1:05:20] your origin he takes a prophet to come
[1:05:24] down
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:27] to take it out
[1:05:29] and give it a meaning
[1:05:31] and it takes somebody with the capacity
[1:05:34] to catch it
[1:05:37] the prophecy god does not send his
[1:05:39] servants to people who are not of the
[1:05:41] same caliber
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:48] he said he could not send his prophet to
[1:05:50] the woman with a woman
[1:05:53] because he told him
[1:05:55] i have prepared
[1:05:58] hallelujah he had talked to that mama
[1:06:01] before the prophet came
[1:06:03] i have prepared a woman who will feed
[1:06:06] you
[1:06:08] and the prophet said god walks on
[1:06:14] god bless you mama she said on both
[1:06:16] sides
[1:06:19] so if god walks here god was here
[1:06:26] hallelujah amen are you seeing that
[1:06:35] let's just continue it's just it's it's
[1:06:37] it's rich
[1:06:39] it's
[1:06:40] where dave asked me said you're going to
[1:06:42] say hallelujah to your preaching i said
[1:06:43] brother yeah
[1:06:45] but the thing is while i'm standing here
[1:06:47] talking to you i see my notes just
[1:06:49] getting changed and transformed so i can
[1:06:50] say hallelujah then because it's not me
[1:06:53] i'm hearing i say hallelujah praise god
[1:06:55] and i tell it to you
[1:06:57] because it's not my stuff that i got set
[1:06:59] up and all fixed up oh no no no no
[1:07:02] he doesn't work like that
[1:07:05] the brother we have to be flexible
[1:07:10] the spirit of god knows your needs
[1:07:14] and he sends a word to meet your need
[1:07:17] he sends a word to encounter your
[1:07:19] situation
[1:07:21] otherwise it is a word that comes in a
[1:07:24] season
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:29] so
[1:07:30] if you are not from here
[1:07:32] where are you from
[1:07:34] because you say oh he just prayed for
[1:07:36] the read verse 9 here see what he says
[1:07:39] i pray for them
[1:07:42] i pray not for the whole world
[1:07:49] but for them which thou has given me
[1:07:53] for they are
[1:07:56] so the prayer was specific
[1:07:59] the prayer was targeted
[1:08:02] targeted to who
[1:08:06] brought about praise his hand real quick
[1:08:09] the prayer was targeted to you
[1:08:13] he said i pray for them
[1:08:16] not for the whole world even though the
[1:08:18] bible says for god so loved the world
[1:08:20] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:08:22] was not the whole world as you thinking
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:28] jesus did not come to die to see if by
[1:08:31] chance somebody would just accept him
[1:08:35] oh i'm gonna go die there when they see
[1:08:36] me die they'll just cry did you see him
[1:08:39] dying
[1:08:40] so why are you believing
[1:08:46] we don't believe because we saw it
[1:08:49] but there is something in your soul
[1:08:52] there's something inside of you
[1:08:55] that's saying
[1:08:56] i need ye o lord i need thee
[1:08:59] every hour i need it
[1:09:02] there's something you telling you you
[1:09:04] don't come from this place don't get
[1:09:06] used to it maybe it's about where do i
[1:09:08] come from
[1:09:09] lord
[1:09:10] you guys show me
[1:09:12] if i come from somewhere show me where i
[1:09:14] come from
[1:09:16] because depending on where i come from
[1:09:19] who i have an attitude
[1:09:22] i have a way of walking
[1:09:24] the prophecy he went to the store with
[1:09:27] his wife and they saw one lady with a
[1:09:28] dress
[1:09:30] he said he was kind of shocked do you
[1:09:31] even see
[1:09:34] and his wife asked him but why do we why
[1:09:36] do we
[1:09:37] he said no
[1:09:39] we are not americans
[1:09:41] we are from heaven
[1:09:45] and because of our kingdom we have to
[1:09:48] kind of
[1:09:49] align ourselves
[1:09:51] we have to kind of dress like
[1:09:55] the ambassador of the united states to
[1:09:58] cameroon my country is not under the law
[1:10:00] of cameroon
[1:10:03] i can't even chase him into the embassy
[1:10:06] because the embassy the united states
[1:10:08] is no longer cameroon even though it's
[1:10:10] in cameroon
[1:10:13] it is the united states the flag that
[1:10:15] flies there is the united states flag
[1:10:20] and the bible say you and i we are
[1:10:22] pilgrims
[1:10:25] you and i were just crossing
[1:10:35] if we are crossing to go somewhere we
[1:10:38] need to have a flag we need to have a
[1:10:40] king we need to have somebody we are
[1:10:42] representing
[1:10:45] and the word christian means to be like
[1:10:49] christ
[1:10:51] he said i have come
[1:10:54] that they might have life and have life
[1:10:57] in abundance
[1:11:01] and david said my cup runners over he
[1:11:04] said he was full
[1:11:06] no he said my cup runners over
[1:11:12] so the life that he had was running over
[1:11:16] and jesus said i came so that they can
[1:11:18] have life and have life in abundance
[1:11:26] um
[1:11:27] somebody's happy
[1:11:30] now it takes a profit of god
[1:11:33] to calm down
[1:11:35] because the bible say as my thoughts are
[1:11:38] high
[1:11:40] as the heavens
[1:11:43] so are my ways
[1:11:45] higher than your ways
[1:11:49] and so if the thoughts of god remain up
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:53] you and i will never know what they are
[1:11:55] he takes somebody with the spiritual
[1:11:58] capacity
[1:11:59] to grab the thoughts of god
[1:12:03] and begin to tell you
[1:12:06] because god will do nothing on the earth
[1:12:10] amos 3 7
[1:12:12] without first no second first
[1:12:16] revealing is sacred
[1:12:19] revealing the hidden things
[1:12:23] to his servants the prophet
[1:12:26] now is it for the prophet to keep
[1:12:28] now let me show you scripture
[1:12:30] deuteronomy 29 says the sacred things
[1:12:33] belong to the lord
[1:12:35] but those that are revealed belong to us
[1:12:39] and to our children so we can fulfill
[1:12:42] the law of god
[1:12:44] so you cannot even know what to do if it
[1:12:47] has not been revealed to you what it is
[1:12:52] that's why we can all have bible
[1:12:54] everybody has a bible now
[1:12:56] everybody go every church of the bible
[1:13:00] but
[1:13:01] to see the mind of god in that bible
[1:13:05] he'll require god to send us a prophet
[1:13:09] and then he takes to earth
[1:13:11] and he tells you now
[1:13:13] this is what he meant here when he said
[1:13:15] this he was saying this
[1:13:21] then now hear what the prophet says
[1:13:25] we are asking where are we from then
[1:13:31] hear this
[1:13:34] oh lord
[1:13:37] hey what he says here
[1:13:39] oh i like this
[1:13:43] okay
[1:13:44] he said why in uh the invisibility of
[1:13:46] the bride of christ
[1:13:49] prague 241
[1:13:50] he said why
[1:13:52] it was put in there by predestination
[1:13:56] you were foreordained to a son of god
[1:14:00] you were in god before the foundation of
[1:14:05] the world
[1:14:06] you are only manifested in this day for
[1:14:10] his honor and glory
[1:14:14] how can you do it without honoring his
[1:14:17] word
[1:14:19] and stand with the enemy word of god
[1:14:23] he said yes sir
[1:14:25] which you are part
[1:14:27] of by the word by predestination because
[1:14:31] look
[1:14:32] the god is the word
[1:14:35] you believe it
[1:14:36] congregation says amen
[1:14:39] well then
[1:14:40] if he always was the word
[1:14:44] in the beginning was the word and if the
[1:14:48] word was god
[1:14:50] then you were in god
[1:14:55] the word the part that you are to play
[1:14:59] was in god before the foundation of the
[1:15:02] world
[1:15:03] he
[1:15:04] seen you
[1:15:06] he knew
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:09] he predestinated
[1:15:11] you to eat
[1:15:14] this morning we spoke about properly
[1:15:16] with music about the god of this evil
[1:15:19] age
[1:15:20] now god is telling us in his word you
[1:15:23] are not of this world
[1:15:25] amen
[1:15:26] you are not of this evil age
[1:15:31] but knowing from where you come from
[1:15:33] will give you a
[1:15:35] way of acting
[1:15:36] a way of behaving yourself
[1:15:39] and now the prophet takes us back there
[1:15:41] and is telling us this is where you were
[1:15:50] hear this next thing wonderful
[1:15:53] and then we're just putting a quick
[1:15:54] foundation so now the same thing is this
[1:15:58] in christ is revealed in his own word
[1:16:01] 65
[1:16:02] august 22nd
[1:16:04] 28 said now the same thing is this
[1:16:08] if you are a son of god
[1:16:11] and if i am a son of god
[1:16:13] or a daughter of god
[1:16:15] we were in god he said at the beginning
[1:16:21] and when jesus became the fullness of
[1:16:24] the word
[1:16:25] then we were in him
[1:16:29] germ form
[1:16:31] hallelujah
[1:16:34] when he was crucified
[1:16:37] we was crucified
[1:16:39] in his body

[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:09] you gotta take the whole door
[1:18:12] you believe that word till the devil
[1:18:14] can't scare you no more
[1:18:18] the prophet said jesus had to believe
[1:18:21] everything that was written of him
[1:18:24] i know there is one scripture he sure
[1:18:27] believed
[1:18:28] you know which one it was
[1:18:30] he would not leave my soul in hell
[1:18:33] neither would that let thy holy one see
[1:18:35] corruption
[1:18:37] and when they put the nail after he just
[1:18:39] remember that it was written of me i
[1:18:41] would not see corruption
[1:18:46] he had to believe it
[1:18:51] and when he was taking his last breath
[1:18:53] do you think he still believed it
[1:18:56] he still believed it
[1:18:58] and when he died that scripture came
[1:19:00] alive
[1:19:03] hallelujah
[1:19:05] that scripture left the books
[1:19:09] hallelujah and the scripture began to
[1:19:11] take form in him
[1:19:14] and before corruption say i got him said
[1:19:16] hold on
[1:19:18] you step aside from here
[1:19:21] is standing on the word of god
[1:19:24] he shall not see death he will not stay
[1:19:26] in the grave
[1:19:28] and corruption would not take a hold of
[1:19:30] him
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:32] and corruption say amen
[1:19:39] you got to believe it that way
[1:19:43] the bible said none of his bones were
[1:19:45] broken and he believed it
[1:19:49] and they broke everybody else's bones
[1:19:51] hallelujah and they got to him did they
[1:19:54] break his bones
[1:19:56] do you know how long that was prophesied
[1:19:59] hundreds of years before he even
[1:20:02] came but he could just rest
[1:20:06] like god's faithful oswald
[1:20:09] and they didn't touch one bone
[1:20:12] one
[1:20:14] so i told that brother i said thank you
[1:20:15] for your testimony i got to go back to
[1:20:17] sleep god bless you
[1:20:18] bye-bye
[1:20:21] and i'm still alive today
[1:20:24] he said when he was crucified
[1:20:27] we was crucified in his body
[1:20:29] when he arose from the dead we arose
[1:20:32] with him
[1:20:33] and now since we have recognized it amen
[1:20:40] now
[1:20:40] we sat together with him
[1:20:43] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:20:48] oh i gotta hold myself so see
[1:20:52] for he
[1:20:53] we if we are sons and daughters of god
[1:20:57] we are god's children then we are
[1:21:01] attributes of god
[1:21:03] then we wear
[1:21:05] got eternal life
[1:21:07] and god is the only eternal life there
[1:21:11] is
[1:21:12] then we were in him from the beginning
[1:21:16] and when jesus became all that word
[1:21:19] then we were part of him
[1:21:22] then amen
[1:21:24] now this is what i love
[1:21:26] he said there you are
[1:21:28] that's in there
[1:21:31] there's no devil
[1:21:33] there's no powers
[1:21:35] no nothing
[1:21:37] can ever move it
[1:21:40] they hear what you say that's the thai
[1:21:42] post of the soul
[1:21:48] just relax
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:52] the tempest is raging in there just hold
[1:21:56] on
[1:21:57] all this wow
[1:21:59] cuz deep down in my soul he told me
[1:22:04] i'm in him all as well brother do you
[1:22:06] know what that does to the devil
[1:22:16] he put his nasty head
[1:22:21] he just got to go away
[1:22:26] no
[1:22:29] next verse say i pray not that thou
[1:22:31] should take them out of the world we
[1:22:34] just read what he said there's no devil
[1:22:37] that can take it
[1:22:39] or move it
[1:22:41] and jesus is saying here i don't pray so
[1:22:44] you take them out of the world because
[1:22:45] corona came i got to get the rapture out
[1:22:47] real quick
[1:22:50] the rapture is not running away from the
[1:22:52] world
[1:22:54] the rapture is a victorious exit of
[1:22:57] overcomers
[1:23:02] you are going to overcome self
[1:23:04] the devil and the world
[1:23:07] you are not going to heaven if you don't
[1:23:08] overcome because he said for he that
[1:23:10] overcome it
[1:23:12] now that he gives you the tools to
[1:23:14] overcome
[1:23:17] our george is our lawyer
[1:23:25] he said i pray not that you take them
[1:23:27] out of the world
[1:23:29] but that thou should just keep them
[1:23:34] from the evil
[1:23:36] the enemy
[1:23:38] from the oppression one time my brother
[1:23:40] preached i remember he said
[1:23:42] the lord
[1:23:44] let the devil in his eden
[1:23:47] to cause destruction
[1:23:50] and to sow confusion
[1:23:52] now the lord is letting us
[1:23:54] in the devil's eden
[1:23:56] to show the devil
[1:23:58] there are going to be some people who
[1:24:00] would stay with the word of god
[1:24:03] so who's got the biggest blow
[1:24:08] the devil's got the biggest blow
[1:24:11] because when everything looks like it's
[1:24:13] going dark
[1:24:14] there's a spark of light here spark of
[1:24:16] light there spark of light here sparkles
[1:24:19] like that and i tell you the more
[1:24:20] darkness there is
[1:24:23] the more your light shines forth
[1:24:27] so darkness does not scare us
[1:24:30] it's gonna get bad yes it's gonna get
[1:24:32] bad and it's okay
[1:24:33] because he told me that there's no devil
[1:24:37] that can move that
[1:24:42] he said there's no devil
[1:24:44] do you know what that does to you he
[1:24:46] gives you peace
[1:24:48] he gives you calm
[1:24:50] he gives you blessed assurance
[1:24:54] jesus his mind
[1:24:57] they're hoping you're going to stumble
[1:24:59] and fall just you're still standing
[1:25:03] when the
[1:25:04] i stopped that trial was kind of big
[1:25:06] this was going to be the one taking boy
[1:25:07] no he's still standing
[1:25:10] but why
[1:25:11] is because something has anchored deep
[1:25:14] down on his soul
[1:25:15] and he's conscious that the god that
[1:25:18] called him
[1:25:19] knew him
[1:25:20] for he knew me
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:26] and he calls you because he knows you
[1:25:32] now if the god of heaven knows you
[1:25:35] he knows your address
[1:25:37] he knows your home he knows your room
[1:25:41] he knows how many hairs you have on your
[1:25:43] head
[1:25:45] even if you go to the barber
[1:25:48] now what does the number of my head
[1:25:51] matter to god for
[1:25:53] it's just hair it's going to go it's
[1:25:55] going to get gray sometimes it's going
[1:25:56] to cut it off
[1:25:57] it's just to show you
[1:26:00] how much he cares for you
[1:26:05] would somebody care for you that much
[1:26:09] if there's not a connection between you
[1:26:11] and him
[1:26:16] would somebody know how many hairs you
[1:26:18] have
[1:26:19] i don't know how many hair my wife's has
[1:26:22] i don't know
[1:26:23] i can't tell how many hairs she has but
[1:26:25] she can't blame me for it i'm not god
[1:26:31] but god
[1:26:33] knows such a detail about you
[1:26:37] how much more
[1:26:39] of the things that you carry in your
[1:26:42] heart
[1:26:43] how much more
[1:26:44] of those prayers you pray to him day and
[1:26:47] night how much more like brother you say
[1:26:49] this morning
[1:26:50] that woman went to the judge every day
[1:26:53] every day
[1:26:54] when the judges got tired
[1:26:56] say i gotta take care of this woman or
[1:26:58] she's gonna break my door
[1:27:01] and sometimes you have to push you pray
[1:27:04] until something happens
[1:27:07] you're just praying constantly i'm not
[1:27:09] saying you take a 40-day fast i don't
[1:27:10] know what i say
[1:27:12] but you bring that prayer topic to god
[1:27:15] every time you're praying lord remember
[1:27:17] this lord remember this father i'm
[1:27:20] bringing it to you again lord
[1:27:23] and something you wouldn't need to pray
[1:27:24] no more you know what it's going to come
[1:27:26] to pass
[1:27:30] but he said keep them while they are
[1:27:31] here
[1:27:32] so you and i have a special protection
[1:27:35] while we are
[1:27:37] just passing through our pilgrimage
[1:27:40] you and i have a special guidance is
[1:27:43] that the angel of the lord
[1:27:45] he comes about them that fear him and
[1:27:48] does what
[1:27:49] he delivers them from evil
[1:27:54] you have special protection
[1:27:57] he's there with you all the time
[1:28:00] daytime nighttime morning afternoon
[1:28:02] evening it's there
[1:28:06] if you could see it you wouldn't fear
[1:28:08] but sometimes because you don't see it
[1:28:10] you get a little scared
[1:28:13] was there with his servant the prophet
[1:28:15] of god
[1:28:16] he saw the army
[1:28:17] oh they're gonna kill us he's just two
[1:28:19] of us
[1:28:22] he didn't say
[1:28:23] lord let me see the angels that are here
[1:28:26] no he said lord open his eyes
[1:28:30] give him some eye self
[1:28:32] so he can see
[1:28:34] because he looks like if he doesn't see
[1:28:35] you he's going to bother me as screaming
[1:28:37] all day
[1:28:40] now do you think when he saw
[1:28:42] he was still screaming
[1:28:46] oh he just can't calm down
[1:28:49] with us
[1:28:51] more than those folks over there
[1:28:54] he's just so tired so far everywhere
[1:28:58] heaven ready to defend them anytime so
[1:29:01] man look at the kind of protection i got
[1:29:05] but the bible declares to you you have
[1:29:08] the angel of the lord that comes about
[1:29:10] you and defends you from all evil
[1:29:15] okay
[1:29:18] so
[1:29:19] the prophet said
[1:29:20] we were somewhere in the beginning
[1:29:24] i want to read one last thing
[1:29:27] and then with the help of the lord
[1:29:29] we're just going to try to see if we can
[1:29:31] close
[1:29:33] can we yes we can close we're not going
[1:29:35] to be very long
[1:29:37] so god help us
[1:29:38] i'm looking here for that message
[1:29:41] show us the father and we're gonna read
[1:29:43] something there
[1:29:44] and that's for the blessings of god
[1:29:47] okay here it is
[1:29:51] i just want to read this it's very
[1:29:53] important i wanted to really make sure
[1:29:55] we get it
[1:29:56] okay
[1:29:58] this is it thank you lord
[1:30:00] we'll read this
[1:30:02] here
[1:30:04] 176. he was either god or he was a
[1:30:07] deceiver
[1:30:09] that's right
[1:30:10] he was god emmanuel
[1:30:12] god made manifest in the flesh and dwelt
[1:30:16] among us the bible said that god was in
[1:30:19] christ
[1:30:20] reconciling the world to himself
[1:30:23] that's exactly what it was
[1:30:27] said back yonder beginning let's take a
[1:30:30] little trip
[1:30:32] when i read this i said lord i can't do
[1:30:33] it here
[1:30:34] but this man here said go
[1:30:37] he said
[1:30:38] let's take a little trip to see who he
[1:30:41] was
[1:30:43] so you can find out whether god was in
[1:30:46] his son or not let's close our eyes as
[1:30:50] it was
[1:30:51] and take a trip a hundred million years
[1:30:55] before there was a star in the sky
[1:31:00] where he said a hundred million years my
[1:31:02] mind just went black
[1:31:05] i can hardly remember what happened
[1:31:07] three years ago
[1:31:08] and then he's taking me a hundred
[1:31:11] million years
[1:31:13] before there was a star in the sky
[1:31:17] now this man can go there
[1:31:19] because he's going to reason
[1:31:22] he's going to want to figure it out
[1:31:25] but the man does his head here
[1:31:28] he said let's go i'll fly with you
[1:31:32] he just takes off because he walked by
[1:31:35] faith
[1:31:37] and he just goes there
[1:31:39] and he says
[1:31:41] let's take a trip a hundred million
[1:31:44] years
[1:31:44] before there was ever star in the sky
[1:31:47] there was god
[1:31:49] god was there then
[1:31:52] and now look in the beginning
[1:31:54] now i see the great space yonder and he
[1:31:56] begins to go into all that describing
[1:31:59] about the logos we're not going to go
[1:32:00] into that
[1:32:03] and then i want to read one more here
[1:32:06] let's just read it it's important
[1:32:08] it's important to read it
[1:32:10] he said and they come he come out and
[1:32:13] there was nothing then here comes the
[1:32:15] logos
[1:32:17] that looks like a halo hanging yonder no
[1:32:20] man has seen god at any time now eye to
[1:32:23] eye
[1:32:24] and here's the logos looks like it's a
[1:32:26] supernatural being it's a halo that's
[1:32:29] the son of god not eternal sonship
[1:32:33] because the words don't go good together
[1:32:37] that's catholic doctrine but eternal how
[1:32:41] could it be a sonship and be eternal if
[1:32:44] he's a son he'd had to have a beginning
[1:32:46] of time
[1:32:48] eternal is forever see
[1:32:50] so eternal sonship there's no such a
[1:32:53] word to make it sensible
[1:32:57] thank god for that he just blew away
[1:33:00] a whole bunch of lies
[1:33:03] so but it was the logos that went out of
[1:33:07] god and there he was playing out there
[1:33:10] in space just like a child before the
[1:33:12] door i can see him draw the whole
[1:33:14] picture in his mind of the kingdom and
[1:33:17] what it might be
[1:33:19] and then the first thing you know i hear
[1:33:22] him say
[1:33:23] let there be light
[1:33:25] and when he did
[1:33:28] an atom broken down
[1:33:32] and the sun become into existence
[1:33:35] i watched the sun burn for millions of
[1:33:38] years i pretty much how are you watching
[1:33:40] this thing
[1:33:43] but it's true
[1:33:46] he said i watched the sun burn for
[1:33:48] millions of years and the first thing
[1:33:51] you know
[1:33:53] went a clinker he stood and watched it
[1:33:56] and it it flew for a million years he
[1:33:59] stopped it and another flew and he
[1:34:01] stopped it what he was putting the solar
[1:34:04] system
[1:34:08] he was writing the first bible the first
[1:34:11] bible was written in the skies
[1:34:14] man looked up knowing god was
[1:34:18] above
[1:34:23] okay
[1:34:25] now
[1:34:26] if he says
[1:34:29] that you
[1:34:30] were is god
[1:34:33] he said a hundred million years before
[1:34:38] there was a star now there's still
[1:34:40] nothing even existing
[1:34:44] he has not even created one speck of
[1:34:46] dust
[1:34:49] he takes you on a little trip just a
[1:34:51] hundred million years back
[1:34:56] when i go back
[1:34:58] yesterday two days ago last week i
[1:35:00] started having some little laps of
[1:35:03] i started forgetting details you know i
[1:35:05] stopped forgetting stuff to happen
[1:35:08] but if you take me 100 billion years
[1:35:10] back
[1:35:12] how am i gonna remember this stuff
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:20] you don't use the memory that you got
[1:35:23] because this memory ain't no good
[1:35:27] there's another memory that you lost
[1:35:33] when the attorney said who's this man
[1:35:35] that living the seas and the waves
[1:35:38] they're saying men to him
[1:35:40] he turned to them he said men of little
[1:35:42] faith
[1:35:44] because his expectation was that they
[1:35:47] would know he had come to show them who
[1:35:50] they were supposed to be
[1:35:57] and this who's this guy
[1:36:00] and he's saying who are you
[1:36:03] don't you know who you're supposed to be
[1:36:09] then when he was here he said i am the
[1:36:11] last of the world and say amen
[1:36:14] there is about to go you say you are
[1:36:19] now the amen kind of drop a little bit
[1:36:22] he said you are the lie to the world
[1:36:26] lord
[1:36:28] that's kind of heavy stuff
[1:36:31] as long as you say he was it's cool
[1:36:35] but when he turned to me and said it's
[1:36:37] you
[1:36:40] you know why you shake like that because
[1:36:42] your memory just come look you did this
[1:36:44] you this hey remember remember remember
[1:36:46] remember remember remember remember
[1:36:48] and then you auto disqualify yourself
[1:36:52] lord
[1:36:53] don't come close to me because i'm
[1:36:55] amanda
[1:36:56] and he said coming closer
[1:37:01] lord i'm worthy he said it's okay but
[1:37:03] come here
[1:37:08] amen
[1:37:10] now
[1:37:12] if the prophet says you were in god
[1:37:15] when he had not even created
[1:37:17] nothing
[1:37:22] and then one day isaiah is looking at a
[1:37:24] vision
[1:37:26] he sees some strange fellow in heaven
[1:37:30] saying in his heart we're not going to
[1:37:31] read everything i'll just we'll just go
[1:37:32] through it but when you go home you can
[1:37:34] read isaiah 14.
[1:37:37] see this fellow in heaven saying
[1:37:40] i would
[1:37:41] i would raise my throat i'll be like god
[1:37:44] let's just read it
[1:37:50] isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 to 17.
[1:37:55] hear this
[1:37:57] how the art fallen from where
[1:38:03] from heaven
[1:38:04] so after the creation
[1:38:06] when heaven was made
[1:38:08] how god fallen from heaven oh lucifer
[1:38:11] son of the morning
[1:38:13] how thou art cut down to the ground
[1:38:16] which did weaken the nations
[1:38:19] for thou has said in then who
[1:38:22] in that heart so my father the lord god
[1:38:25] is not a designer today
[1:38:27] he started discerning way back in heaven
[1:38:34] he said you said in thine heart god saw
[1:38:37] his thought in his heart when they were
[1:38:39] still up there
[1:38:42] i will ascend into heaven
[1:38:45] i will absorb my throne above the stars
[1:38:48] now is it the stars you see here
[1:38:51] okay
[1:38:53] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:38:55] congregation
[1:38:57] but notice what he said about the
[1:38:58] location
[1:39:00] in the sides of the north
[1:39:03] we're going to continue say i will
[1:39:05] ascend above the heights of the clouds
[1:39:09] i will be like the most high so see his
[1:39:12] desire
[1:39:15] he tried to establish this desire in
[1:39:17] heaven
[1:39:18] he tried to set up his kingdom in heaven
[1:39:22] but there cannot be two kingdoms where
[1:39:24] there's already a key one kingdom has to
[1:39:28] out
[1:39:30] he say yet
[1:39:31] thou shalt be brought down to hell
[1:39:35] hallelujah
[1:39:37] to the sides of the pit so he's not
[1:39:40] going to sit in the sides of the north
[1:39:42] no siree
[1:39:44] he's going to go to hell and be in the
[1:39:46] sides of the pit i have one reminder i
[1:39:49] love to give the devil
[1:39:50] you know which one it is when i'm in
[1:39:52] trouble with affliction i said devil
[1:39:54] it's okay
[1:39:55] you have your date
[1:39:57] with hell
[1:39:58] fire
[1:39:59] you'll be chained one of these days and
[1:40:02] cast into the pit of fire do what you do
[1:40:05] now
[1:40:06] and i'll probably be there to watch you
[1:40:07] go down
[1:40:13] said they that see thee shall narrowly
[1:40:16] look upon thee and consider this saying
[1:40:19] is this the man that made the earth to
[1:40:22] tremble that the shake kingdoms
[1:40:25] so what would he have come to
[1:40:28] nothing
[1:40:30] that made the world as a wilderness and
[1:40:33] destroyed the cities thereof that opened
[1:40:36] not the house of the prisoners
[1:40:39] so his job is to make prisoners who will
[1:40:42] never be set free
[1:40:44] but my joy the job of my jesus is to set
[1:40:47] the captives free
[1:40:52] so while he was trying to set up this
[1:40:54] program in heaven
[1:40:56] the king of heaven saw it
[1:41:00] but he had one desire i want to go into
[1:41:02] kind of real quick
[1:41:05] he said
[1:41:07] i want to sit in the sides of the lord
[1:41:09] so there was an order in heaven
[1:41:12] things were set in order
[1:41:16] but when you come down to earth and you
[1:41:18] look how israel was traveling with the
[1:41:20] ark of the covenant
[1:41:22] around the ark of the covenant there was
[1:41:25] three tribes each
[1:41:28] north south east west now on the north
[1:41:33] side
[1:41:34] each the three tribes had one tribe
[1:41:37] which was their leader and each side had
[1:41:39] a banner
[1:41:42] you can find this in the book of numbers
[1:41:43] 225. you can read it at home
[1:41:46] on the north side there were three
[1:41:49] tribes
[1:41:50] there was a tribe of acer
[1:41:52] dan and naphtali
[1:41:54] and dan was the leader of them
[1:41:57] but you know what the abana was
[1:41:59] it was the ego
[1:42:02] hallelujah
[1:42:04] the devil was really desiring
[1:42:07] to sit upon the people who will be here
[1:42:09] in the end time
[1:42:11] because the prophet said in every age
[1:42:14] god sent a spirit to fight the spirit of
[1:42:18] that age
[1:42:20] and in our age what did god send us
[1:42:24] thank you brother he sent us a flying
[1:42:26] eagle
[1:42:27] and when the prophet begins to dissect
[1:42:30] what the eagle is like
[1:42:32] you're like what
[1:42:34] he said is flying way up in the heights
[1:42:37] but he can pinpoint a needle
[1:42:40] on the ground
[1:42:42] so his vision
[1:42:44] is not 20 20.
[1:42:50] it's binoculars is not adjustable
[1:42:54] it's just good
[1:42:58] and god's seeing the evil age we are
[1:43:00] going to live in
[1:43:02] the deception that has been cooked and
[1:43:04] prepared
[1:43:06] to trap the stars of god in this time he
[1:43:09] said i wouldn't leave them like that
[1:43:11] because in the time of poison they had a
[1:43:14] spirit of a lion
[1:43:16] they were born they went everywhere
[1:43:17] preaching the word they didn't care who
[1:43:19] you were they will tell you the word of
[1:43:22] god
[1:43:23] in the dark edges that there are spirit
[1:43:25] on ox
[1:43:27] sacrifice
[1:43:28] they just die cut it looks okay
[1:43:33] then came the reformers it's a man with
[1:43:36] wisdom
[1:43:38] but in your age
[1:43:41] in your time
[1:43:43] god said i got to give my kids some
[1:43:45] clear vision
[1:43:47] i got to give those ones there sight to
[1:43:49] see
[1:43:51] because they won't be able to sing
[1:43:53] loudest here i've got to give some folks
[1:43:56] eyes have so they can detect the devil
[1:43:59] in every move
[1:44:05] and so the devil was late even when he
[1:44:07] was thinking like that in heaven he was
[1:44:09] already late
[1:44:13] because god had already set him up for
[1:44:15] failure
[1:44:17] now look at the kind of god you have
[1:44:21] hallelujah
[1:44:23] amen
[1:44:25] this is the god that you serve
[1:44:29] nothing escapes his vision
[1:44:37] and jesus is praying another prayer in
[1:44:39] matthew 6 he said lord
[1:44:42] let thy will be done on
[1:44:45] as it is where
[1:44:46] now what happened in heaven before
[1:44:52] when the devil taught these things
[1:44:55] god raised up an army
[1:44:59] in this army
[1:45:01] our generals do that so who's the person
[1:45:04] trying to disrupt the council of god
[1:45:06] here
[1:45:07] bringing this order to his kingdom
[1:45:11] oh it's me so he to raise up his army
[1:45:15] and he went from india to india hey
[1:45:18] i'm setting up a little army you want to
[1:45:19] join us
[1:45:21] i got some plans we're going to get over
[1:45:23] this thing
[1:45:24] one angel say yup
[1:45:25] he go to the next one hey
[1:45:28] no
[1:45:30] man what's going on here
[1:45:32] one say yes one say no
[1:45:35] wha
[1:45:41] and when the battle happened do you know
[1:45:44] who was victorious
[1:45:47] he was at the angel michael was
[1:45:49] victorious and he cast down the dragon
[1:45:53] so from the beginning he's a loser
[1:45:58] i go back to his track record the guy
[1:46:00] lost in the beginning
[1:46:03] so my question is i want to know who
[1:46:06] made him lose
[1:46:08] because i want to be on that team
[1:46:10] but the question is you don't put
[1:46:12] yourself on that team
[1:46:15] you were always on that team
[1:46:16] [Applause]
[1:46:19] and jesus said let that will be done on
[1:46:22] earth
[1:46:23] as it is in heaven amen and the bible
[1:46:26] says for god so loved the world he came
[1:46:29] down
[1:46:30] he didn't stay in heaven
[1:46:32] because if you stay in heaven
[1:46:35] what kind of love is that
[1:46:37] you know my wife is in cameroon i met
[1:46:38] her i was talking to my mom on the phone
[1:46:41] the video thing
[1:46:43] and she just kind of passed in the
[1:46:44] background i said who's that
[1:46:48] like seven years ago i said who's that
[1:46:50] again
[1:46:51] say well it's one sister i told my
[1:46:53] little brother said babe you got to get
[1:46:54] her number
[1:46:55] you say what i said yup you said well
[1:46:57] she's kind of hard to talk to she's very
[1:46:59] serious i say oh that's good
[1:47:02] you get that number for me
[1:47:06] after a hard struggle like a week
[1:47:09] text came in i got the number i said oh
[1:47:11] yeah
[1:47:13] so i start texting the sister like bible
[1:47:15] verses
[1:47:16] god is love
[1:47:18] [Laughter]
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:23] you know
[1:47:24] you want
[1:47:28] you want to act religious
[1:47:34] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:47:35] shadow of death
[1:47:38] that's not what's going to convince your
[1:47:39] sister brother
[1:47:41] tell him what's on your heart
[1:47:43] don't be using the word of god for your
[1:47:45] fake proposition you already have a
[1:47:47] thing in your mind you're thinking to do
[1:47:49] you're gonna put the word of god first
[1:47:50] you know
[1:47:51] and then she texts me with a verse too
[1:47:53] psalms 91
[1:47:55] i said well it looks like we can get
[1:47:57] along
[1:47:57] i text the bible verse you take a bible
[1:47:59] verse so now can i talk to you oh yeah
[1:48:03] and we start talking
[1:48:05] six years just talking jose was what's
[1:48:07] up love
[1:48:09] what's up what's up what's up what's up
[1:48:13] so why after six years she said hey
[1:48:15] brother i appreciate you you good man i
[1:48:17] love you but hey
[1:48:19] time's kind of running out
[1:48:21] it's been six years
[1:48:24] what do you think about it what's your
[1:48:25] plan
[1:48:26] says sister
[1:48:28] it doesn't look like you're going
[1:48:29] anywhere because i want to marry you
[1:48:32] she look at me like you want to marry me
[1:48:34] i said hold on let me let me let me just
[1:48:36] think about that for a minute
[1:48:38] so i went home and i got me a little
[1:48:39] ring i said i gotta do this right
[1:48:42] i'm not over there so i gotta make it
[1:48:44] such a way that she can at least have a
[1:48:46] memory how to propose to her you know
[1:48:48] so i got it set up i stuck that ring
[1:48:51] under the box and i covered it up i
[1:48:52] bought some things for her set it on the
[1:48:54] box sent it home i said when you open it
[1:48:55] call me now don't open this thing
[1:48:57] without calling me she said okay
[1:49:00] three o'clock in the morning she's going
[1:49:02] through the stuff and
[1:49:03] then she just took the box oh this is so
[1:49:06] cute she put the ball i said don't throw
[1:49:08] the box away
[1:49:10] she said but there's nothing in here and
[1:49:12] then the box came fell down she said
[1:49:14] what
[1:49:18] i said can i marry you
[1:49:21] you say oh yeah
[1:49:22] but now look i was still here she was
[1:49:24] still there it wasn't palpable wasn't
[1:49:26] real
[1:49:29] so one day i told my job i said job
[1:49:32] i've made some promises to a young lady
[1:49:34] in cameroon
[1:49:36] can i get a little vacation time so i
[1:49:38] can go see her they say oh yeah
[1:49:40] we watch you suffer over here
[1:49:43] we're gonna send you home take three
[1:49:44] weeks go get married i say lord thank
[1:49:47] you
[1:49:49] so when i'm getting home i see a long
[1:49:51] text in my phone
[1:49:53] or what if you get here and you change
[1:49:55] your mind what if you don't think you
[1:49:56] think i'm i'm too short what if i was
[1:49:59] with him
[1:50:02] i told him i said man does he think i'm
[1:50:03] crazy
[1:50:05] i'm leaving my job
[1:50:07] i travel 18 hours on the flight
[1:50:10] i paid 1200 for the ticket
[1:50:14] just to come joking around
[1:50:17] he said man hold on let's get home first
[1:50:20] i said okay okay
[1:50:22] so we got home and i see her do you
[1:50:24] think my heart changed my feelings
[1:50:26] dropped
[1:50:27] no
[1:50:29] because i didn't love her for what she
[1:50:31] looked like
[1:50:32] there was something within her that drew
[1:50:35] me
[1:50:38] now she's pretty i won't tell you that
[1:50:41] very beautiful
[1:50:42] but that's not what caught my eye yeah
[1:50:46] something about her was genuine
[1:50:49] something about her was real yes
[1:50:51] so when i look at her i said what's your
[1:50:53] name again
[1:50:56] i'm just kidding
[1:50:59] and we got married
[1:51:02] but do you think that love would have
[1:51:04] been real if i stay here every day i
[1:51:05] love you i love you i love you
[1:51:08] no sir
[1:51:11] i had to prove that i loved her
[1:51:15] and because god loved you
[1:51:18] he had to come down to look for you
[1:51:25] and when he come down
[1:51:27] he begins to look for some people that
[1:51:30] he knew before
[1:51:33] he begins to walk around
[1:51:36] recruiting an army
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:41] because
[1:51:42] with his winning team before they
[1:51:44] overcame
[1:51:45] so he's got to get those folks on his
[1:51:47] team
[1:51:49] but the thing is some of these folks
[1:51:52] that were on the street
[1:51:55] living wrong
[1:51:57] some of these folks
[1:51:59] were gone out then they're taking the
[1:52:00] ways of the world some of these folks
[1:52:03] were shooting up drugs
[1:52:06] some of these folks were going to church
[1:52:07] and they never changed their lives
[1:52:10] do you think he said now we're just
[1:52:11] going to switch around
[1:52:13] we'll just change teams
[1:52:19] one day
[1:52:20] one of his team players came by and fell
[1:52:23] on his feet lord they're about to stone
[1:52:26] me
[1:52:28] and he look around he said is there
[1:52:30] anybody here
[1:52:32] don't have no scene
[1:52:34] you got it right do it
[1:52:36] the deacon kind of went back
[1:52:39] and she looked like the deacon is going
[1:52:40] away so got sins too yep
[1:52:47] and then the pasta
[1:52:50] even the pasta
[1:52:54] and then the only person that could
[1:52:57] condemn her
[1:52:59] she was just waiting for him to say
[1:53:00] something
[1:53:03] he said woman
[1:53:07] thy sins which many
[1:53:10] forgiven thee
[1:53:12] go
[1:53:13] sin no more
[1:53:15] lest the worst thing come upon you
[1:53:19] he just joined that team hallelujah
[1:53:22] praise god
[1:53:27] brother peter's over there
[1:53:29] catching his fish he just come by and
[1:53:31] say
[1:53:32] he was your brother follow me
[1:53:35] he didn't preach five hours
[1:53:37] he just told them two words follow
[1:53:40] me
[1:53:42] they left everything
[1:53:45] i have decided
[1:53:47] to follow jesus
[1:53:50] i have decided to follow jesus
[1:53:54] why would you follow somebody you don't
[1:53:56] know
[1:54:00] the prophet said he went to a junkyard
[1:54:02] one of his friends was
[1:54:04] showing him some how the junkyard works
[1:54:07] he said his friend put a big magnet
[1:54:10] going over all the cars like this
[1:54:13] and the cars begin to
[1:54:15] magnetize
[1:54:18] hallelujah and as they magnetize i want
[1:54:20] you to note the order of magnetizing one
[1:54:24] car get magnetized the next car gets
[1:54:26] magnetized on the next car
[1:54:32] and they get magnetized and magnetized
[1:54:34] and magnetized but there was one car
[1:54:36] that they didn't get out of the ground
[1:54:39] you know
[1:54:40] why did that one come out of there he
[1:54:42] said oh that one's got a big bolt like
[1:54:45] this and it's bolted down to the earth
[1:54:50] that one has gotten the influence of the
[1:54:52] god of this evil age
[1:54:55] and just feels happy around here
[1:54:58] but those ones that know they're not
[1:54:59] from here
[1:55:00] man they're just magnetizing
[1:55:04] they just go in
[1:55:06] but why are they magnetizing
[1:55:09] because in them
[1:55:11] they have a capacity to be magnetized
[1:55:16] in them they have a property that makes
[1:55:20] them to be magnetizable
[1:55:23] now in you
[1:55:25] there is something
[1:55:27] that made you
[1:55:29] answer yes to the word of god
[1:55:35] now if in the victory over there
[1:55:40] there was overcoming
[1:55:43] in the victory here
[1:55:45] what would they be
[1:55:47] for those who are on the winning team
[1:55:52] because jesus said this
[1:55:54] the bible says he shall be called
[1:55:56] emmanuel
[1:55:57] god
[1:55:58] with us but do you think that was his
[1:56:01] only happiness
[1:56:02] just come and be with us
[1:56:06] he knew there was going to be a
[1:56:09] battle
[1:56:11] and him just being with us wasn't
[1:56:13] sufficient
[1:56:15] that's how i'm going to be
[1:56:17] in them
[1:56:21] he comes and dwells in the believer
[1:56:26] that's why he said greater is he
[1:56:29] that is inside of you
[1:56:32] than the one
[1:56:36] in this battle
[1:56:38] there's somebody inside of you
[1:56:40] that has overcome the world
[1:56:43] and the only reason why you overcome
[1:56:47] is because it's inside of you
[1:56:51] and brother david said this morning
[1:56:53] terry wait for him ask him for it it is
[1:56:56] yours
[1:57:06] there was a victory
[1:57:08] we'll close before
[1:57:09] brought a job
[1:57:11] and then we closed
[1:57:13] i don't want to lie again i said we'll
[1:57:14] close before
[1:57:16] help me
[1:57:17] but somebody's pulling what can i do
[1:57:20] where a job comes to the world rich man
[1:57:23] everybody knows him the bible says the
[1:57:25] young people bow to him
[1:57:28] when he passed they bound to build a job
[1:57:31] and then one day the devil has to go and
[1:57:34] beg for permission
[1:57:38] god was even boasting about job to the
[1:57:41] devil
[1:57:42] and he tells the devil have you
[1:57:44] considered my servant job
[1:57:49] so he's god who put job in trouble
[1:57:54] but you understand why god put him in
[1:57:56] trouble
[1:57:57] so god the devil said no you have
[1:58:00] protected his house do you know even
[1:58:02] job's cows were
[1:58:04] protected the bible said you have put a
[1:58:07] hedge around him
[1:58:10] but even his cows
[1:58:12] his car
[1:58:13] his cats
[1:58:15] everything because they belong to him
[1:58:17] were protected
[1:58:20] son god of god you're not any kind of a
[1:58:23] person
[1:58:25] then the devil asked for permission to
[1:58:27] take off the hedge
[1:58:29] and i will show you he
[1:58:31] god took off the hedge
[1:58:33] he took away his children the cattle
[1:58:36] everything
[1:58:38] and then when he gets all the news so
[1:58:40] he's not even finished digesting one
[1:58:42] news they bring the next news
[1:58:45] your camels your sheep your cows
[1:58:49] all your children
[1:58:51] job just stands up
[1:58:54] said the lord
[1:58:56] has given
[1:58:58] the lord has taken
[1:59:00] blessed be his holy name
[1:59:02] how do you think his father felt i mean
[1:59:05] the one up there i don't mean he's
[1:59:06] heaven he's
[1:59:08] how do you think god felt
[1:59:11] i told the devil
[1:59:15] say let me touch him because those are
[1:59:18] his belongings that's not job
[1:59:22] those are his halves
[1:59:24] i want to touch him
[1:59:26] he said touch his body
[1:59:29] but don't touch his life
[1:59:31] so the question is
[1:59:33] is the body more important than the life
[1:59:36] and the prophet said a man that weighs
[1:59:38] about 120 pounds he's about 89 cents
[1:59:42] now you put a hundred dollar suit
[1:59:45] on 89 cents
[1:59:47] you see and then you sometimes stick
[1:59:49] your nose up in the air if it rains
[1:59:51] you're gonna drown
[1:59:56] on 89 cents so even your clothes that
[1:59:59] you wear they're worth more than your
[2:00:00] body if they had to sell you
[2:00:03] amen
[2:00:06] but the man that lives inside of you
[2:00:09] do you know his value
[2:00:13] ten thousand word
[2:00:18] he said what shall he profit the man
[2:00:21] to gain the world now let's assume the
[2:00:23] world is seven 000 trillion zillion
[2:00:26] billion
[2:00:28] now it still takes 10 000 of them for
[2:00:31] your one soul
[2:00:34] but we are in this world
[2:00:39] but that inside mind let's watch him
[2:00:43] and god said touch his body but don't
[2:00:46] touch him because job is just living in
[2:00:49] that tabernacle
[2:00:51] that's not job you're seeing now i'm
[2:00:53] seeing my brother here when i call him
[2:00:56] is the life in him that answers me
[2:01:00] because if i pass away and i'm laying
[2:01:02] here you come and call me i'm not gonna
[2:01:04] answer you why because the life within
[2:01:08] me is not there
[2:01:12] and the devil afflicted his body now he
[2:01:15] was scratching his body
[2:01:18] with
[2:01:19] pieces
[2:01:21] of clay
[2:01:23] has anybody had to do that
[2:01:25] no we all fine we got ac we got
[2:01:28] everything we don't need that
[2:01:30] but look at what he went through
[2:01:33] and while he was going through this now
[2:01:36] his mind begins to work and here what he
[2:01:38] says curse be the day i was born
[2:01:40] so when he can rewind backward
[2:01:44] that's as far back as he can go
[2:01:48] so that's where his memory ends in the
[2:01:51] unwinding just be the day i left my
[2:01:53] mother's womb why was i even born
[2:01:57] then when he goes forward he said let me
[2:01:59] even die
[2:02:02] because when i die it's over
[2:02:06] and then he began to look at how he said
[2:02:08] but
[2:02:10] when the plants die
[2:02:12] and they're cut apart
[2:02:14] they come back to life
[2:02:17] i've got to know when i go by the
[2:02:19] graveyard i haven't seen nobody come out
[2:02:21] yet
[2:02:22] but what happens to the man when he dies
[2:02:26] so something within him wanted to go far
[2:02:30] beyond death and see kind of what's
[2:02:32] after that
[2:02:34] but when he rewinds and goes backward he
[2:02:37] stops at birth
[2:02:39] so he cursed the day he was born and
[2:02:41] desired to die so it'd be over
[2:02:45] then god comes down
[2:02:48] when he's suffering i thought god would
[2:02:50] say oh he's suffering
[2:02:52] i gotta help him out let me just heal
[2:02:54] him is that what god said
[2:02:56] he says stand up like a man
[2:02:59] tie your lawns
[2:03:01] i will answer you ask your questions and
[2:03:03] you will answer me
[2:03:06] so maybe he comes just stood up and said
[2:03:08] maybe it's going to be something that
[2:03:09] i've kind of dealt with before let's
[2:03:10] kind of find out
[2:03:13] and then god begin to question brother
[2:03:15] john
[2:03:20] hallelujah somebody already said the
[2:03:21] question
[2:03:23] he asked him a bunch of ques questions
[2:03:27] and then he begins to ask him about his
[2:03:29] origins hey
[2:03:31] where were you
[2:03:34] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[2:03:43] so when i do my rewind
[2:03:45] i got my date of birth and that's it
[2:03:48] but he's taking me
[2:03:51] when the foundations of the earth's been
[2:03:53] laid
[2:03:54] can remember
[2:03:59] he said
[2:04:01] do you know
[2:04:03] who set the limits of the sea
[2:04:07] hush
[2:04:08] now we are talking about your god and my
[2:04:10] god
[2:04:14] then he keeps asking him questions
[2:04:17] then he asks you one question
[2:04:20] hallelujah he said where were you
[2:04:26] when the sons of god
[2:04:28] rejoiced
[2:04:30] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[2:04:34] so when god was laying those foundations
[2:04:37] somebody was saying
[2:04:44] hallelujah
[2:04:46] now who was it
[2:04:50] [Applause]
[2:04:54] but the prophet has told you
[2:04:57] that
[2:04:58] when you take that journey a hundred
[2:05:01] million years back
[2:05:03] you were just setting god so when god
[2:05:06] was putting those foundations there was
[2:05:09] somebody screaming hallelujah
[2:05:12] glory be to god
[2:05:14] what he said let there be light there
[2:05:16] was somebody that said hallelujah glory
[2:05:19] be to god
[2:05:20] [Applause]
[2:05:25] that's even before the devil was cast
[2:05:28] out of hell
[2:05:32] so if you go all the way back
[2:05:36] in bro begin to say what
[2:05:39] so some people were there
[2:05:41] rejoicing
[2:05:45] and god let him know
[2:05:47] brother job
[2:05:49] you were there
[2:05:55] we are in a heavenly celebration
[2:05:58] so you begin to look in that
[2:06:01] ah
[2:06:02] say but there's somebody back there look
[2:06:04] like me
[2:06:09] there's somebody saying a man right
[2:06:11] there
[2:06:12] kind of look like me
[2:06:14] but he don't have no ulcers on him
[2:06:18] he's not crying
[2:06:20] he's not cursing the day he was born
[2:06:23] he's just rejoicing
[2:06:28] all right
[2:06:29] so the confession begin to kind of
[2:06:30] change there
[2:06:32] i know my redeemer liver
[2:06:36] hell man
[2:06:38] is it even if the worms
[2:06:41] eat this body
[2:06:44] not with the pastor's eyes
[2:06:47] not with the deacon's eyes with my own
[2:06:51] eyes i will see god
[2:06:54] and brother but i'm saying the book of
[2:06:56] job is the oldest book in the bible
[2:07:01] and when job got the revelation of where
[2:07:05] he came from
[2:07:06] oh brother
[2:07:08] his confession
[2:07:10] changed amen
[2:07:12] no he won't cry no more now he won
[2:07:16] he said no
[2:07:25] wash the snow
[2:07:27] and free from all seed
[2:07:30] how we shall
[2:07:33] and i will see
[2:07:36] when the redeem
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:42] isaac was still in
[2:07:44] his father
[2:07:46] jacob was still in in in his father
[2:07:50] but when god told him he said your seed
[2:07:55] shall possess
[2:07:56] all the gates of his enemies
[2:07:59] now they were declared overcomers when
[2:08:02] they were not yet born
[2:08:06] hallelujah
[2:08:08] they were declared victorious when they
[2:08:12] were not yet born
[2:08:21] let me close this book so i don't
[2:08:22] continue
[2:08:23] close everything
[2:08:28] amen
[2:08:33] a young man
[2:08:35] in tennessee
[2:08:37] his mama loved him
[2:08:40] and raised him in the church
[2:08:42] to serve the lord
[2:08:44] then he gets a problem said bad company
[2:08:47] corrupts good manners
[2:08:49] and he gets into the world and he
[2:08:51] catches a social disease
[2:08:54] but his mama
[2:08:56] knew how to shake heaven
[2:08:59] she used god's telephone
[2:09:04] verbum calls it neology
[2:09:08] they don't teach this in college
[2:09:13] the mama used neology
[2:09:17] she began to call on god all night lord
[2:09:20] god here's my son i'm like that woman in
[2:09:23] the bible lord but where's your prophet
[2:09:26] elijah
[2:09:27] so god begin to locate brother
[2:09:32] he's got to catch his flight
[2:09:35] he tells him walk
[2:09:37] but lord i walk
[2:09:40] left
[2:09:41] right
[2:09:42] left right
[2:09:44] and the mama when she catches the vision
[2:09:49] god shows her the prophet
[2:09:52] when she sees him
[2:09:54] she just walks outside said at three
[2:09:56] o'clock in the morning setting there by
[2:09:59] faith
[2:10:03] she has not seen nothing yet
[2:10:06] but she's already positioned herself
[2:10:11] the prophet said she was sweating on her
[2:10:13] back
[2:10:14] from sitting there so long
[2:10:19] and when she saw him
[2:10:21] she gave him his id
[2:10:24] how you doing parson
[2:10:27] how you normal person
[2:10:30] he told me
[2:10:33] last night i was praying
[2:10:37] and he told me he was coming
[2:10:40] said do you know that woman in the bible
[2:10:43] and he begin to
[2:10:44] begin to tell him
[2:10:47] amen he said i asked him and i told him
[2:10:50] i said lord here i am where is your
[2:10:53] elijah
[2:10:56] saying he showed me you coming with your
[2:11:00] the way you dressed and you had on
[2:11:03] so he realized he was not in a vision
[2:11:06] but
[2:11:07] he was not the one that saw it
[2:11:11] it was that mama that had seen it
[2:11:14] because he was used to being asked the
[2:11:15] question
[2:11:16] everybody how do you know now he's they
[2:11:18] want to ask you how do you know
[2:11:22] and when they go in the room
[2:11:25] that boy on that bed
[2:11:27] was part of the army of god
[2:11:30] he was a recruit but he didn't know
[2:11:36] he said let's pray
[2:11:37] he said when she prayed
[2:11:40] i had never heard
[2:11:43] somebody
[2:11:45] praying like that
[2:11:46] he said i did need to pray long
[2:11:51] and the boy said there's light in the
[2:11:53] room
[2:11:55] there's light in the room
[2:11:57] mama
[2:11:58] this light
[2:12:04] because that young man was part of the
[2:12:08] army of god
[2:12:13] now when did you become an overcomer
[2:12:20] when did you overcome amen
[2:12:23] now if you can't trace it by the word of
[2:12:25] god you have peace in your heart
[2:12:29] because it's not your choosing
[2:12:32] it's god choosing
[2:12:35] yes
[2:12:37] and if
[2:12:38] god
[2:12:39] overcame the first time
[2:12:42] this time too
[2:12:44] he will overcome the devil
[2:12:50] but the
[2:12:51] prophet was speaking the message he said
[2:12:53] god wants to glorify himself
[2:12:56] through us
[2:13:01] when brother paul saul was persecuting
[2:13:03] the people i loved this very much when
[2:13:05] he was persecuting the people
[2:13:08] and he gets to the way to damascus when
[2:13:10] he sees the pillar fire
[2:13:12] and he falls down to the ground
[2:13:14] when he says
[2:13:15] lord who are you and the prophet tells
[2:13:18] us he cannot call that light lord
[2:13:22] unless he knew it was the lord because
[2:13:25] he was instructed in the law of israel
[2:13:28] and he knew that the pillar of fire that
[2:13:30] led israel out of egypt
[2:13:33] was that same pill of fire right there
[2:13:36] and he asked him
[2:13:37] who are you give me your id
[2:13:40] do you know what he told him
[2:13:43] he said i am jesus
[2:13:46] whom you are persecuting huh
[2:13:49] i thought jesus was already gone to
[2:13:51] heaven
[2:13:56] he said those people that you think
[2:14:00] are
[2:14:01] castaways
[2:14:03] that's me
[2:14:07] i
[2:14:08] am jesus
[2:14:10] whom you persecute
[2:14:13] so you were saying here who are you
[2:14:17] it's good to look back and say no that
[2:14:18] was for the time that paul was doing it
[2:14:23] now right
[2:14:24] now who are you
[2:14:29] i believe the world has answered you
[2:14:30] tonight
[2:14:32] and has shown you where you came from
[2:14:37] to let you know this is not our home we
[2:14:40] are just
[2:14:42] passing through
[2:14:44] but where we came from
[2:14:46] we were victorious
[2:14:49] and right now we are not going to lose
[2:14:53] that's what the bible said in isaiah no
[2:14:55] weapon
[2:14:56] that is formed against me shall prosper
[2:15:00] and every tongue that shall rise against
[2:15:02] me in judgment i shall condemn
[2:15:06] for this is the heritage of the servants
[2:15:09] of the lord and their righteousness is
[2:15:12] of me
[2:15:16] thus saith the lord
[2:15:20] he finished it up for now i was about to
[2:15:21] forget it he said thus saith the lord
[2:15:25] now that's for you
[2:15:31] that's your portion
[2:15:33] from the word of
[2:15:34] god and bible said we cannot come out
[2:15:38] losers
[2:15:41] he said we're not going to lose
[2:15:43] anyway so then what do you have to worry
[2:15:46] about
[2:15:51] that's just singing a short song as we
[2:15:55] uh bow our hearts and our heads and pray
[2:16:00] i sing that song in moments like these
[2:16:03] as we ask the blessing of the lord
[2:16:08] don't you love the word of god
[2:16:11] doesn't it give you peace in your heart
[2:16:14] it just takes away
[2:16:17] the worry
[2:16:18] it takes away the anxiety
[2:16:22] it takes away the cares it takes away
[2:16:24] everything
[2:16:25] because all it takes
[2:16:28] is just for god
[2:16:30] to show it to you
[2:16:32] to reveal it to you
[2:16:34] and that's it
[2:16:39] [Music]
[2:16:42] and that's his desire
[2:16:44] to reveal himself to us
[2:16:48] that's what he sent us the message for
[2:16:51] to reveal himself to us to make himself
[2:16:54] real to us
[2:16:57] don't you love him this new year's
[2:16:59] let's just stand as we sing that song
[2:17:02] before we pray
[2:17:08] eight more moments
[2:17:25] to jesus
[2:17:27] [Music]
[2:17:32] is
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:18:01] singing
[2:18:12] singing
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:31] moments like this one more time
[2:18:34] [Music]
[2:18:51] to jesus

[2:34:55] amen i really appreciate let's bow our
[2:34:58] heads this evening
[2:35:00] i know we're standing but
[2:35:03] maybe you'd like to use a little neology
[2:35:06] right now
[2:35:08] to lift the partition up to the lord
[2:35:12] something that you're desiring
[2:35:15] i heard the prayer request for
[2:35:17] josh going into the air force and
[2:35:21] and in my heart my heart
[2:35:24] leapt for joy i just thought it was such
[2:35:26] a good thing for him
[2:35:28] and that something really wonderful is
[2:35:30] going to come out of it and
[2:35:33] i just want to ask the lord if he would
[2:35:35] go with him
[2:35:37] and
[2:35:38] the things that the lord has prepared
[2:35:40] for him would just
[2:35:42] surround his life and
[2:35:45] and
[2:35:46] he would
[2:35:47] in
[2:35:48] this
[2:35:49] time of training that
[2:35:52] he would just
[2:35:54] receive something and call upon the lord
[2:35:57] i know he loves the lord and i know he
[2:35:58] has a tender heart so
[2:36:01] i want to ask the lord to go with him
[2:36:04] the brothers
[2:36:05] in our congregation at our home and
[2:36:09] they're going through the headaches and
[2:36:11] the backaches and
[2:36:14] as this
[2:36:18] flu passes
[2:36:21] its way we
[2:36:22] ask the lord to protect our congregation
[2:36:25] that we're not afraid of it
[2:36:27] because of god before us who can be
[2:36:30] against us
[2:36:31] and we serve a god that healeth of all
[2:36:34] our diseases
[2:36:36] and nothing could come upon us that the
[2:36:38] lord already hasn't made a provision
[2:36:42] we want to remember all them in prayer
[2:36:46] and most of all we don't want the
[2:36:48] spiritual side of this virus to take
[2:36:50] hold
[2:36:53] the lord said in his word there's
[2:36:55] neither bond nor free junior greek male
[2:36:57] nor female
[2:37:00] but we are
[2:37:02] all christs

[2:37:06] and we rest in that
[2:37:08] heavenly father

[2:37:49] us who can be against us

[2:38:02] and if i started a work i'll finish it
