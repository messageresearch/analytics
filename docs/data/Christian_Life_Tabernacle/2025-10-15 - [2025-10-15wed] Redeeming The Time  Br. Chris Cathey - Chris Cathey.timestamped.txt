[10:00] We'll ask sister Haley to come and bring
[10:01] her special
[10:33] [Music]
[10:37] testimony because he really does care
[10:41] and I've witnessed it.
[10:45] [Music]
[10:58] Life lets you down and you feel more
[11:02] broken than whole.
[11:08] When the wounds go deeper than words
[11:14] and you can't tell a soul.
[11:21] I may not know what you're going
[11:24] through.
[11:26] May not can make that high mountain
[11:30] move. But one thing I found
[11:35] that I really want you to know,
[11:42] if it matters to you,
[11:48] it matters to the master.
[11:53] He wants to share the burdens you bear.
[11:59] Whisper peace when your world gets
[12:03] shattered.
[12:05] If it's your greatest joy or your
[12:09] deepest pain or you're really needing an
[12:14] answer.
[12:16] If it matters to you,
[12:19] [Music]
[12:21] it matters to the master.
[12:28] [Music]
[12:36] Friend, do you think
[12:39] the maker and giver of life
[12:45] [Music]
[12:47] is far too busy to care
[12:52] about your struggle and trials?
[12:59] He sees the sparrow that falls to the
[13:03] ground.
[13:04] And he hears those tears that don't make
[13:08] a sound. If you only knew
[13:12] how precious you are in his sight.
[13:17] [Music]
[13:20] If it matters to you,
[13:25] it matters to the master.
[13:28] [Music]
[13:31] He wants to share the burdens you bear.
[13:37] Whisper peace when your world gets
[13:40] shattered.
[13:42] If it's your greatest joy or your
[13:46] deepest pain or you're really needing an
[13:51] answer,
[13:53] if it matters to you,
[13:58] it matters to the master.
[14:04] If it's your greatest joy or your
[14:08] deepest pain or you're really needing an
[14:13] answer,
[14:15] if it matters to you,
[14:20] &gt;&gt; it doesn't only matter to you.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; If it matters to you,
[14:30] [Music]
[14:35] It matters to the master.
[14:43] [Applause]
[14:48] &gt;&gt; How many knows that to be the truth?
[14:51] &gt;&gt; If it matters to you, it matters to him.
[14:59] Just got an announcement here. There
[15:00] will be a brother's breakfast this
[15:02] Saturday in the fellowship hall from
[15:04] 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.
[15:08] Brother David Kaku writes for brother
[15:11] Jose Martinez in need of assistance from
[15:14] God in his court case. We just heard a
[15:18] song that says, "If it matters to you,
[15:20] it matters to the master." If you've
[15:22] come into the house of the Lord with a
[15:24] request upon your heart and you want to
[15:26] make it known to him by the uplifting of
[15:28] your hands, do so knowing that he is the
[15:31] answer. We'll ask brother Tim to come
[15:33] and pray for these and may the brothers
[15:35] are taking the tithes and offerings.
[15:36] Please come.
[15:49] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[15:54] We sang the song, I feel like traveling
[15:56] on.
[15:58] Even if you don't feel like it, we're
[16:00] still traveling on. Pray the Lord will
[16:02] give you the strength tonight.
[16:06] Gracious and kind heavenly father, we
[16:07] thank you, Lord, once again for
[16:09] gathering us together, this part of the
[16:11] sheepfold,
[16:13] Lord, that you can bind our hearts
[16:16] together in faith, believing for these
[16:19] requests. Lord, that we put before you,
[16:22] Lord. Those that are unspoken, shown by
[16:25] the uplifted hand or on the hearts of
[16:27] your people,
[16:29] Lord, we just heard the the song sung,
[16:34] Lord. If it matters to us, it matters to
[16:36] you.
[16:38] Lord, there's things that
[16:41] burden us, Lord. We have compassion.
[16:45] We have feelings.
[16:49] We have needs, Lord. So, we want you to
[16:52] consider them all, Lord. Answer as you'd
[16:55] see fit
[16:57] according to your word and your will,
[16:59] Lord.
[17:02] But Lord, you said if we ask believing,
[17:04] bind our hearts together, any two or
[17:05] three agree together on any one thing,
[17:09] that you would do it.
[17:13] And we know, Lord, when you said those
[17:16] things,
[17:18] you were behind closed doors with your
[17:21] disciples.
[17:24] Those that weren't servants on the
[17:25] outside, but they were your friends.
[17:28] They were your followers.
[17:30] They were near and dear to you, Lord.
[17:33] That's where we place ourselves tonight,
[17:35] Lord. Your children.
[17:37] We come as children seeking leadership
[17:40] and guidance from a heavenly father. one
[17:42] that knows what's ahead.
[17:47] We recall how you asked Peter,
[17:51] if he loved you.
[17:54] [Music]
[17:58] Peter answered,
[17:59] &gt;&gt; "Lord, you know I love you."
[18:02] &gt;&gt; And you asked him two more times.
[18:06] That wasn't for reassurance for you,
[18:08] Lord,
[18:10] but that was to ensure that Peter knew
[18:14] he had a savior. And you told him how he
[18:16] would be dying for that savior. Lord, we
[18:20] we take up our cross willingly. Lord,
[18:23] there's there's struggles, but we know
[18:26] that the race has already been won.
[18:30] Lord, I pray that tonight we can have
[18:32] that victory. We can have that faith to
[18:33] overcome. Lord, grant it to us when we
[18:36] hear the preaching of the word. Lord, we
[18:38] can we can lay our faith there and bind
[18:41] our hearts together and say, "That's the
[18:43] truth." And see these requests come to
[18:46] pass in our lives, Lord. But it's by
[18:49] your word that you accomplish all
[18:50] things. Lord, we thank you for our
[18:53] already answered prayer for the needs
[18:55] that have been met.
[18:58] Lord, there's many more. We just pray
[19:00] that you'd answer them all. Bless the
[19:02] tithes and offerings, Lord, in this
[19:03] little service tonight, Lord. May we
[19:05] just be on the edge of our seat. Be
[19:08] listening for that portion of the word
[19:10] that's individually for each one of us,
[19:13] Lord, because we all come here for
[19:15] something. And you're going to satisfy
[19:17] that hunger. So grant it to us now,
[19:19] Lord, as we lift you up, magnify your
[19:22] name. We ask all these things in the
[19:24] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[19:26] Amen.

[32:06] best we can. And uh we just love the
[32:08] Lord with all our heart. Again, brother
[32:10] David, I just I love him and uh his sons
[32:13] and known them for many years. And uh
[32:16] but uh just just telling you I just I
[32:18] love the Lord. I love this message with
[32:20] all my heart. Um but as we go to the
[32:23] word today um we just uh we just go to
[32:27] prayer right now. Father, we just come
[32:30] before your throne tonight. Father, we
[32:32] come to hear from you. Not from a man,
[32:35] but Father, may you speak through this
[32:36] mortal clay tonight. And God, may you
[32:39] just only speak what you would have to
[32:41] speak. Father, may you just come down in
[32:44] a special way. May you calm our spirits.
[32:47] Father, may you come through every
[32:48] aisle. Father, may you touch the sick.
[32:51] Father, whatever the needs are tonight,
[32:53] may you just come down in a mighty way
[32:55] tonight. We just love you, God. We thank
[32:58] you for your many blessings. And Father,
[33:00] we'll give you the praise, the glory,
[33:02] and honor in Jesus name. Amen.
[33:06] Just want to turn tonight to Ephesians.
[33:08] This really has been on my heart. and um
[33:12] I pray it's a blessing and uh was just
[33:14] in the back praying talking to your song
[33:16] leader and and uh just great
[33:19] confirmation from the Lord. So I pray
[33:21] it's a blessing tonight. But uh we'll
[33:24] turn to Ephesians. May we stand for the
[33:25] reading of God's word as we stand for
[33:27] the flag. But there's nothing better to
[33:29] stand for the reading of God's word. So
[33:31] Ephesians chapter 5. I'll give you a
[33:33] minute to get there. Ephesians 5.
[33:37] Ephesians 5. It starts off with he says
[33:40] it says be ye therefore followers of God
[33:45] &gt;&gt; as dear children.
[33:47] It says and walk in love. And it says as
[33:51] Christ also hath loved us and has given
[33:57] himself for us an offering and a
[34:00] sacrifice.
[34:02] And it goes on verse still in verse two.
[34:05] And it goes on, giving us a sacrifice to
[34:07] God for the sweet smelling savior. Verse
[34:10] three, it goes on to say, but for uh it
[34:13] says right here, sorry, let me get to
[34:15] the next slide. It says, but fornication
[34:18] and all uncleanliness
[34:21] uh neither filthy uh uncleanliness, let
[34:24] it not be once named among you as become
[34:27] it saints. Verse four, neither
[34:30] filthiness nor foolish. Uh uh it says
[34:34] nor foolish nor justesting which are not
[34:36] covenant but rather giving of thanks.
[34:39] Verse five, for this you know that no
[34:42] mooreer nor unclean person nor covetous
[34:45] man who is an idolattor hath any
[34:47] inheritance in the kingdom of God. Uh
[34:50] verse six uh it goes on to say I just
[34:54] want to get to this tonight. Um verse
[34:57] verse six he said let no man deceive you
[34:59] with vain words for because of this
[35:02] cometh the wrath of God upon the
[35:04] children of disobedience but ye but not
[35:07] ye therefore partakers within for ye
[35:11] were sometimes in darkness
[35:14] but now you are the light in the world.
[35:17] Walk as children of the light. May God
[35:20] bless you. May be seated. And I was just
[35:22] reading this as I was sitting in there
[35:25] uh flying over here and I was reading in
[35:27] the hotel. I I really like where verse
[35:29] eight says, "For ye were sometimes
[35:32] darkness." Aren't you thankful that God
[35:35] in a dark dark world we live in today?
[35:39] &gt;&gt; That we were always sometimes darkness.
[35:41] But here we are sitting in today 2000
[35:43] 2025. Who would think we would still be
[35:46] here?
[35:47] &gt;&gt; But we're living in a dark age. We're
[35:49] living in a very dark time. Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; You're We're living in a time that you
[35:53] got to stand up for what's right.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; You got to not just quote a book or
[35:58] carry carry uh carry the book around or
[36:01] or the the message apps on your phone,
[36:03] but we but we live in a time that people
[36:06] really want to see uh God uh uh God with
[36:10] 10 on it. Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Uh we live in a time that that that that
[36:14] we live in darkness that people on your
[36:16] your job, they they they you you could
[36:19] tell them all the quotes, but they want
[36:20] to see a life that lives behind the
[36:22] name.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; We live in a time that that we we we
[36:26] really want to see Jesus with skin on
[36:28] it.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; That you're the only feet tonight.
[36:30] You're the only mouth that that he has
[36:33] to use. And he's called you out for a
[36:35] reason. Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; And as verse 9 says, it goes on to say,
[36:39] "But for the fruit of the spirit is in
[36:42] all goodness and righteousness and
[36:43] truth." And I'm just building up to this
[36:45] tonight. Verse 10 says, "Proving that
[36:48] what what is acceptable unto the Lord."
[36:51] And it says verse 10 or verse 11, "And
[36:54] having no fellowship with unfruitful
[36:56] works of darkness, but rather approve,
[36:59] reprove," another word means expose
[37:02] them.
[37:03] Verse 12. For it is a shame even to
[37:05] speak to those things which are done in
[37:08] them and speaker it, but in all things
[37:10] that are approved reproved are made
[37:12] manifest by the light. So, so what what
[37:17] I'm what I want to say tonight and bring
[37:18] it down to more of a more of a maybe a
[37:21] kindergarten education tonight. But you
[37:23] know when the light exposes the
[37:25] darkness, the the just a little bit of
[37:27] light and you can have a flashlight and
[37:29] you just have maybe just one battery, a
[37:32] couple batteries in there and you it's
[37:34] very weak, but it's still powerful in
[37:36] the presence of darkness.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; So I don't care where you stand tonight,
[37:40] where your next your neighbor to your
[37:42] left or your right is or how long you've
[37:44] been in the message. You've been in it
[37:46] two weeks. Just be a light for Jesus
[37:48] Christ. just be a light for the one that
[37:52] gave you the truth and the revelation.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; But it goes on to say, he says, "But uh
[37:58] for darkness, verse 12, for it is a
[38:00] shame even to speak of those things
[38:02] which are done of in secret, but in all
[38:04] things are reproved or made manifest by
[38:07] the light. For whosoever doeth make
[38:09] manifest is the light." But I like
[38:13] really what this says. It says, "But
[38:14] therefore," now listen to this.
[38:16] Wherefore, verse 14, he saith, this is
[38:19] the Lord speaking. He said, Wherefore he
[38:22] saith, Awake thou sleepest,
[38:26] &gt;&gt; and arise from the dead, and Christ
[38:29] shall give thy light.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; We live in a day of a time that we
[38:33] should be not sleeping.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ, we're right here at
[38:37] the climax of the time. It's time to
[38:40] wake up, Brad. It's time to rise up. I'm
[38:43] here to tell you tonight to wake up and
[38:45] realize the time we're living in.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; The young people, it's a time to realize
[38:50] and say, "Hey, the light is coming in my
[38:52] day." But what are we doing with the
[38:54] light?
[38:56] &gt;&gt; What are we where are we at? We should
[38:57] be at a higher level in in the time we
[38:59] live in. God has g opened the entire
[39:02] book from Genesis to Revelation. People
[39:05] have carried the message of the hour 30
[39:08] years and 50 years. But what are you
[39:10] doing with the lights?
[39:13] But it goes on to say here, it says in
[39:15] verse 15, "See then that we walk
[39:17] circumstantially not as fools but as
[39:20] wise."
[39:22] &gt;&gt; It says, "Redeeming the time because the
[39:26] days are evil."
[39:28] &gt;&gt; So tonight, I just want to speak a few
[39:29] minutes on redeeming the time.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; We live in a time that is a very fast
[39:35] fastpaced time. You know, when we flew
[39:38] into Dallas, it's a lot far a lot a lot
[39:41] faster than Louisville, Kentucky or even
[39:43] Campbellville. We moved to Campbellville
[39:45] and there's 28,000 people and it feels
[39:48] like people are crawling and walking and
[39:50] barely moving. But you come to Dallas
[39:52] and it's 100 miles an hour. And I
[39:55] believe that's when our spiritual walk,
[39:57] the devil wants to keep you busy in
[39:59] other things. He wants to keep you busy
[40:01] in not reading your Bible. He wants to
[40:03] keep you busy in not praying. He wants
[40:05] to keep you busy in everything else on
[40:07] your iPad and in Facebook and Instagram.
[40:11] But we got to redeem the time back that
[40:13] the devil tries to steal from you
[40:15] tonight.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; We live in a fast-paced time. And I was
[40:19] telling someone the other day, you know
[40:20] what? Busy stands for the devil wants to
[40:24] put so much thing on us. Oh, we can work
[40:27] a little bit more. But I'm here to tell
[40:28] you, when the church doors are open, you
[40:30] should be in church. Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; When in church the the pastor studied
[40:35] all day and he's made himself ready, we
[40:38] should become prayed up.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; We should come pull on the word and say,
[40:42] "Hey, I'm coming to get a piece. I'm
[40:45] coming to hear from Jesus Christ
[40:46] tonight."
[40:47] &gt;&gt; And I've changed the way I've thought
[40:49] over the years and recently of studying
[40:52] is even if I'm not speaking, I want to
[40:54] come for a fill up. Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Too many times we pass the How many
[40:58] times you pass a gas station and your
[41:00] lights on and you're like, "Hey, I got
[41:03] five miles. I've done it plenty of
[41:05] times." And you get to the gas station,
[41:07] you come up to a gas. I can make it a
[41:09] little bit more.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; I can make it a little bit more.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; I got My wife's like, "Chris, would you
[41:16] please stop? We're going to run out of
[41:19] gas.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; But have you ran out of a spiritual tank
[41:23] tonight? Have you filled up lately?
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Have you gotten to a place in your life
[41:29] that you want to take back the time
[41:30] where the devil is stealing from us? We
[41:33] live in a fast-paced world where it's
[41:35] this or that or we're on our iPad or
[41:38] we're on Facebook.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; When we live in a time that we should
[41:43] redeem the time because the days are
[41:46] evil.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Another word redeeming the time. comes
[41:50] from the Greek word and it says extrao
[41:54] it said which means to buy or purchase
[41:56] up or rescue from the lost it's I like
[42:00] what the prophet of God says he says and
[42:03] brethren we have drawn little circles of
[42:06] laws and different things and we've
[42:08] never we we still never come to the real
[42:11] colonel he said it's Jesus Christ the
[42:14] love of God the God that God wants us to
[42:17] see he said what pity. He said, "Love is
[42:21] the greatest, most powerful weapon that
[42:24] this world has ever seen
[42:27] &gt;&gt; or known of." He said, "It's a dying."
[42:29] It's a It's dying for love.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; He said the church is perishing for
[42:35] love. He says, "The love of God's waters
[42:38] of grace to flow one to another with
[42:41] confidence is restored when the justice
[42:44] is restored between us.
[42:46] The love of God that's shared abroad in
[42:48] our hearts by the denomination.
[42:51] Something sounded wrong there, didn't
[42:53] it? He said, "The love of God is shed
[42:55] abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit."
[42:58] &gt;&gt; God's loved us. And as I read that
[43:01] scripture, as I read the first scripture
[43:03] in verse Ephesians 2, it says, "But walk
[43:06] in love as Christ also loved us and he
[43:10] gave himself up to us." I'm talking
[43:12] about a true agapo love. I'm not talking
[43:15] about a filial love. I'm talking about a
[43:17] true love that Jesus Christ paid it all.
[43:20] He paid everything. And and we had a
[43:23] prophet in our day point us back to
[43:25] Jesus Christ. And he showed us the real
[43:28] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And I like to say he says, "Walk in
[43:34] love." I tell you, too many times we we
[43:36] we we as as a message believer, we got
[43:39] this quote and we got this or hey, let
[43:41] me throw this at you. But no, we need to
[43:44] pull on some love on some people
[43:45] tonight. And just put your hand to the
[43:47] right or to your left. Maybe they're not
[43:49] where you're supposed to be. Maybe the
[43:51] there's a youth tonight not where
[43:53] they're supposed to be. But hey, give
[43:55] them grace. He gave you grace.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; It's all in Jesus Christ timing. It's
[44:01] it's it's redeeming the time. But but it
[44:04] but maybe the one to your right maybe
[44:05] take a little bit longer than you.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; But he's still working on us. every
[44:11] single day he's working on us. He's
[44:14] preparing us. As you get in your word,
[44:16] as you listen to these tapes, he's
[44:19] preparing you. He's He's forming you
[44:21] into his image
[44:24] &gt;&gt; every single day.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; I like that. He says, "Walk in love." As
[44:29] Romans 5:8 says, "But but God commanded
[44:32] his love towards us. While ye yet were
[44:36] sinners,
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Christ died for us."
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when you were stuck in the
[44:41] in the maybe the ballroom tonight. Maybe
[44:44] you can say, "Brother Chris, I was stuck
[44:46] in the gutter here or maybe I was in
[44:48] this denomination. I was here or
[44:50] wherever. But while you yet were
[44:52] sinners, Christ died for you tonight."
[44:55] That's something that should be like,
[44:57] "Praise God.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; He's gave me something to be happy about
[45:01] tonight."
[45:04] Oh, I tell you, I'm tired of seeing so
[45:06] many believers walk around with frowns
[45:07] on your face because we should be living
[45:10] at a level and say, "When I get up in
[45:12] the morning, old devil, I'm coming after
[45:14] you."
[45:17] &gt;&gt; You might not know me tonight, but I'm
[45:18] telling you, I wake up that way. My
[45:20] wife's like, "Bro, guys, honey, can I
[45:23] just get a cup of coffee in before you
[45:24] get to going?"
[45:27] But I'm I'm not living off coffee
[45:29] tonight. I'm not living off things of
[45:31] the world tonight. I'm living on the
[45:34] mana from God.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I'm living on a message of the hour
[45:38] that's alive.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; I'm living in a Bible that has become a
[45:43] new book.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; 21 years ago, the Bible became a new
[45:49] book and it lives on the inside. What
[45:52] about you?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; What about you tonight?
[45:57] But God commanded his love towards us.
[46:00] While we were yet sinners, I hope it
[46:02] sinks in tonight. Christ died for you.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; The innocent one the I mean, think about
[46:11] Jesus Christ. What he did for you
[46:13] tonight. That one scripture should be
[46:16] enough for you to wake up every morning
[46:18] and say, "Yeah, why I was a sinner. He
[46:21] He had mercy that I didn't die in a car
[46:24] wreck. Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Then he didn't take my child or did
[46:27] this. He he he gave me enough grace in
[46:30] redeeming the time that once maybe you
[46:33] were in the car and you said, "Lord,
[46:34] come in my heart. It don't have to be in
[46:36] the pew."
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was on your job. Maybe someone
[46:40] witnessed to you about the message of
[46:41] the hour and you said, you know, that
[46:43] that's the truth. That I'm like Hattie,
[46:45] right? That's nothing but the truth.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you a little testimony. I came
[46:51] in, maybe you don't know me tonight, but
[46:53] I came up in a home, a very broke up
[46:55] home. And I'm here to tell you tonight,
[46:58] if you come up in a broke up home, he
[47:00] can bring, he can give you a home that
[47:02] will never be broken.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; I came in a home that didn't have love
[47:08] that that that was about drugs and this
[47:10] and uh drinking and all this. But I'm
[47:13] here to tell you, but when I heard the
[47:14] message of the hour,
[47:17] &gt;&gt; I I always tell everybody, I'm a CEO
[47:19] Christian. And I used to be
[47:22] Christmas, Easter, and other holidays.
[47:25] That's when we came to church.
[47:26] Christmas, Easter, and other holidays.
[47:29] But I'm here to tell you, it doesn't
[47:31] have to be a holiday anymore for me.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; On a Wednesday night, on a Sunday
[47:36] morning, on a Sunday night, I want to go
[47:39] praise Jesus.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; And it's an every single day.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm not just saying it's just when
[47:45] the doors are open. It's a daily walk
[47:47] with Jesus Christ. He's wanting the the
[47:51] fellowship was broke in the garden, but
[47:53] Jesus Christ redeemed us
[47:56] &gt;&gt; and he's brought back the fellowship on
[47:58] Calvary and he wants you to be a
[48:00] personal say, "Lord, I just want to
[48:02] speak to you today."
[48:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about making him a
[48:05] checklist,
[48:07] saying, "God, do this, do that." When's
[48:09] the last time you said, "Lord, I just
[48:11] want to tell you I love you."
[48:14] When's the last time you said, "Lord, I
[48:16] just want to spend as much time as I do
[48:18] on Facebook with you."
[48:22] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to me tonight, too.
[48:25] When's the last time we could get off a
[48:28] chat room or or this or that or or the
[48:31] devil likes to keep us busy?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about time tonight.
[48:35] Redeeming the time. The devil wants to
[48:37] keep our young people so busy. I'm
[48:39] seeing it everywhere. so bombarded with
[48:42] this and that and things of the world.
[48:45] And it might be a great chat room. It
[48:47] might be a Christian chat room, but
[48:49] that's all you do is just chat back and
[48:51] forth. Did you hear this? Did you hear
[48:53] that? Did you hear this?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; When you could just pick up your Bible
[48:57] and say, "Lord, I just want to fall more
[48:59] in love with you.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just here to tell you we're living
[49:04] in an evil day.
[49:06] We're living in a late hour.
[49:09] And if you just hear the message
[49:11] tonight, we're living in it says to
[49:13] redeem the time because we're living in
[49:14] the evil day. I'll read that again.
[49:17] Wherefore he saith verse 14, awake thou
[49:20] sleepest and arise from the dead as
[49:23] Christ shall give thy light. See that we
[49:25] walk circumstant not as fools but as
[49:27] wise but redeem in the time because the
[49:30] days are evil. I would say we're here.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I would say we're we're we're we're
[49:35] almost I would say we're pretty much in
[49:37] gross darkness. We're living in a grace
[49:40] period right now. We're living in a time
[49:42] that it's time to take back what the
[49:44] devil stole from you.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; We're living in a time where your your
[49:48] family's on the edge and maybe maybe
[49:50] your home's about to be broke up and
[49:52] maybe your kids want to see you read the
[49:54] Bible. Maybe your grandchildren want to
[49:56] see you get on your knees and pray.
[50:02] Because you can share them all the
[50:03] quotes in the world, but I tell you
[50:05] what, they just want you to fall in love
[50:07] with the master.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; My kids could care less if I read them a
[50:11] quote unquote quote after quote, but if
[50:14] daddy ain't living the life and say,
[50:16] "Lord, I just pour the love of Christ on
[50:18] them."
[50:21] Oh, they want a real a real man of God
[50:23] or one that will pull his britches up
[50:26] and say, "Son, we but we we're going to
[50:28] read the Bible as a family."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Too many times the devil keeps us in a
[50:34] time of busyness and distractions on
[50:37] every corner.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Every time you get on something, a
[50:41] little ad, you could be on the internet
[50:42] and the ad's after you. It's chasing
[50:45] you. Or you can look up uh if you're
[50:47] looking to buy something, it will chase
[50:49] you all day.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, am I right? It it'll chase you
[50:54] all day. You look up a a certain gun,
[50:56] that gun will follow you all day.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It'll say buy here and buy there, and
[51:01] before you know it, you're in a web. And
[51:03] that's why it's called the worldwide
[51:05] web.
[51:06] Because the devil wants to web you in
[51:08] his time.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; He wants to steal your God's time.
[51:13] But I'm here to tell you and us as the
[51:15] bride of Christ should redeem back our
[51:17] time
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I want to spend more
[51:20] time with you. I want to read the Bible
[51:22] more. I don't care what age you are. I
[51:25] want to love you more, Lord."
[51:28] &gt;&gt; He'll take whatever place you give him.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; But he wants first place.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; He wants first place. Trust me.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful for God tonight. In
[51:40] verse 17 of Ephesians 5, it says,
[51:43] "Wherefore be not one wise, but
[51:46] understanding with what will of the Lord
[51:48] is, and be not drunk with wine, where in
[51:52] the excess be filled with the spirits.
[51:54] Speak unto yourselves in psalms and
[51:56] hymns." I love this. In spiritual songs,
[52:00] singing making melody unto the Lord to
[52:02] the heart to the Lord. And I thought
[52:05] about this scripture uh for the youth.
[52:08] Sometimes they get caught up in a time
[52:10] where the devil they could listen to a
[52:13] spiritual song tonight. Taylor Swift
[52:15] ain't a spiritual song.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; We're living in a time where we listen
[52:21] to somebody and they sing two spiritual
[52:24] songs and the rest of it is trash.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know who I'm speaking to
[52:30] tonight, but I'm just here to tell you
[52:32] that's what the I don't have in my
[52:33] notes, but but I'm here to tell you
[52:35] watch what you're listening to. Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Your ears are not garbage cans tonight.
[52:41] You are the bride of Christ. He's called
[52:44] you out for a reason.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; You're living at a time where where
[52:50] where you you I'm telling you, I see it.
[52:52] Youth will come through prayer lines
[52:54] after prayer lines
[52:56] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of different music. I
[52:58] don't know why I'm going down this, but
[53:00] they but it comes to these young people
[53:02] and it just bombs bars them because
[53:04] maybe their dad don't love them like
[53:06] they should.
[53:07] Maybe the mama's too busy to do this and
[53:10] do that and they just want a little bit
[53:12] of love,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; but we're not redeeming the time. And
[53:16] the devil will, if you don't show them
[53:18] time, the devil will give them time.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; We live in a time that the devil will
[53:24] bombard you with with things and
[53:26] busyiness.
[53:28] And I wrote this down one time. I put,
[53:30] you know what stands for? Being under
[53:33] Satan's yoke.
[53:36] We live in a time where we're being
[53:37] under Satan's yoke. As verse uh 19 says,
[53:41] speaking there in psalms and hymns and
[53:44] spiritual songs, singing a melody unto
[53:46] the in your heart to the Lord. Verse 20
[53:50] it says, giving thanks always for all
[53:52] things unto God and to the father in the
[53:54] name of I tell you what, giving thanks
[53:56] always, even in your trials,
[53:59] &gt;&gt; even when the bank account's low. Come
[54:01] on.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Even when you know your bank account
[54:04] shows almost zero, saying, "Lord, I'll
[54:07] still serve you."
[54:10] &gt;&gt; There's been plenty of times my bank
[54:11] account's been low. And I'm telling you,
[54:13] two days later, I don't know where a
[54:15] check comes in the mouth.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Because he's the one that pays your
[54:20] paychecks.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; He's the one that gave you breath
[54:23] tonight.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; But giving thanks always, that's hard to
[54:28] do when you're in a battle. Maybe you
[54:30] come in tonight. You're like, "Brother
[54:31] Chris, I'm in a battle, but give him
[54:34] thanks."
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Give him thanks tonight. Say, "Lord, I
[54:38] might be in a battle, but tell your
[54:41] storm who your God is."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Start telling your storm who your God
[54:46] is.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; But it says, "Sement yourselves one to
[54:51] another in fear of God."
[54:54] I like this one translation. You
[54:56] probably don't have it, but verse one.
[54:58] This is just Ephesians 1. It says, "Be
[55:00] imitators of God in everything you do."
[55:05] &gt;&gt; It said, "For then you will represent
[55:07] your father as a beloved sons and
[55:09] daughters. Continue to walk surrendered
[55:12] to a extravagant love of Christ."
[55:16] And I'm here to tell you young people,
[55:17] maybe I'll just share it, maybe to
[55:18] encourage you. I grew up in a home that
[55:20] was very broke up. I grew up in a home
[55:23] that didn't know Christ.
[55:25] But one day, I was handed two message
[55:27] tapes. I was leaving for the military
[55:30] hand and why you're not a denomination
[55:32] Jezebel religion and then I started
[55:34] studying. I tell you we don't live off
[55:37] your family's coattails.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Don't live off because your daddy
[55:40] believes the message. You let the
[55:42] message get on the inside of you. You
[55:45] let the Bible become a new book
[55:47] &gt;&gt; and then you fall in love with the
[55:49] author.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm just speaking from experience. I
[55:54] just went to church and I just, you
[55:56] know, sometimes I feel like even in the
[55:57] message church, it's just a routine.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; It's just another Wednesday night.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; It's just another Sunday. But no, every
[56:06] time we meet is the divine appointment
[56:09] from Jesus.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe it be in your home or wherever
[56:12] it's at. Maybe it's at your kitchen
[56:14] table and you grab your family's hands
[56:16] and you starting to just read the Bible.
[56:18] Maybe it's one scripture, but it's a
[56:20] divine appointment
[56:22] &gt;&gt; that you can say, "God, speak to my kids
[56:24] tonight. Speak to me, Lord."
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But I like that said, "Be imitators of
[56:30] God in everything you do." But I grew up
[56:33] in a home that was very broke up that
[56:35] didn't have love.
[56:37] And I started looking for love in other
[56:39] places. I started filling my time up
[56:42] because daddy didn't show me love. So, I
[56:44] went looking for love.
[56:47] I'm just being real with you tonight.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; I went looking for love. I looked here.
[56:51] I looked there. I did the drinking. I
[56:53] thought that would be good love.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; And I realized the devil will fill you
[56:57] with with with sorrow and things of this
[57:00] world that ain't it's just emptiness.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And he'll put you on the side of the
[57:05] street somewhere and he'll laugh at you.
[57:07] Young people.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm here to tell you young girls,
[57:11] you stay pure.
[57:14] You look beautiful with long hair.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; You look beautiful without all this
[57:18] makeup on.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; The world won't tell you that. But I'm
[57:23] here to tell you that's what the Bible
[57:25] says.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Your mirror tonight is not the world.
[57:30] Your Bible, the mirror of your life
[57:32] should be the word of God.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever the word says, you follow it.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; If he says you're beautiful, then you're
[57:40] beautiful.
[57:42] But I got caught up in this and I got
[57:44] caught up in this and and before you
[57:46] know it, it was up in a big old web.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And he started sucking up my time. And
[57:51] before I left for the military, my
[57:53] grandmother had me two message books and
[57:55] I started to research why I believe what
[57:58] I believe.
[58:01] And then I started looking at the water
[58:03] baptism. And then I started going down
[58:04] the path. And then I went down and I I
[58:07] hope this is okay tonight, but I'm just
[58:09] being real with you tonight. And then I
[58:11] started researching why I believe what I
[58:13] believe. And then I realized I've been
[58:16] so I've been God the whole time I just
[58:18] lived off my dad was a Baptist and I
[58:21] believe it this way.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you even in the
[58:25] message churches today get a real
[58:27] revelation of why you believe what you
[58:29] believe. People are leaving by left and
[58:32] right because they never researched it
[58:34] for themselves.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And there's not another message today.
[58:41] There's not another one that's took
[58:42] their uh uh Jesus Christ has took a
[58:45] picture with our prophet.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; I never forget when I came in the
[58:50] message. I told my mom, I said, "Get in
[58:52] the car." She said, "Where are we
[58:53] going?" I said, "We're going to the
[58:54] Smithsonian. I'm going to find this
[58:56] picture."
[58:58] She said, "What are you doing? Have you
[59:00] lost your mind? I said, "Yeah." I said,
[59:01] "I found the truth, Brother Andrew.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I found the truth." I said, "I want more
[59:07] of it."
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And 25 25 years ago today, I'm still on
[59:13] fire for God. I still love the truth. I
[59:17] still love the message.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I still love the Bible.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "Well, you worship
[59:24] a man." No, I worship the God in that
[59:26] man.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, he just pointed you to
[59:30] Jesus Christ.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, you should be
[59:33] thankful that he put the bicep on you
[59:36] tonight and has gave you the light of
[59:39] the world.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; He's opened your revelation.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; But we walk around here going, "Brother
[59:46] Chris, I I just can't make it. I uh
[59:48] Brother Andrew, I'm so sorry." Every
[59:50] day, you ever been around somebody
[59:52] that's everything is negative? That's
[59:54] right.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; You ever been on the phone with somebody
[59:57] and every word out of their mouth is
[59:59] negative? Here they come and you're
[1:00:01] like, "Oh, I'm going this way. I'm going
[1:00:03] this way."
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, everything in
[1:00:06] Christ is just positive.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Even your trials you're going through
[1:00:11] tonight are positive.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; It's shaping you. It's molding you into
[1:00:16] the person God wants you to be.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; As the word of God says, it's more
[1:00:22] precious than gold. Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's hard to say when you're going
[1:00:26] through a deep trial. I'm telling you,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; that's very hard when the bank account's
[1:00:30] low. It's easy to serve him when the
[1:00:32] bank account's a lot in it.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; But what about when you don't have a
[1:00:37] whole lot and you say, "You know what? I
[1:00:38] ain't got $5. I'm going to give it all
[1:00:40] to God."
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; When you just put it in the pot and say,
[1:00:43] and watch him multiply it.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; I've done it many of times where I'll go
[1:00:48] just double check. I'm just being
[1:00:50] honest. I'll pull Hey, brother Andrew.
[1:00:51] I'll pull out $100. Well,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; and the next week I'll get 600 and $800
[1:01:00] and $1,000
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; because that's our God.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you to step out by
[1:01:07] faith and say, "Lord, I redeem my time
[1:01:10] back.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I redeem my time."
[1:01:15] We live in a time where it's just
[1:01:17] fastpaced, fastpaced
[1:01:19] every single day. But I grew up in a
[1:01:22] home that didn't know nothing about God.
[1:01:24] And when I started realizing and seeing
[1:01:27] water baptism and I got out of the
[1:01:28] Baptist church and I went into the
[1:01:30] military, I hope this was okay. But when
[1:01:32] I went into the military, I started
[1:01:34] realizing how much time how how much
[1:01:37] time we have in our life. And as I've
[1:01:39] got older, I'm here 43 years old and I
[1:01:41] realized time is precious.
[1:01:44] And God only gives you aotted time.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Every single of you tonight are having
[1:01:51] an allotted time, appointed time to meet
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; It's either heaven or hell.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; There's no in between. And I'm not here
[1:01:59] to give you a scared message tonight.
[1:02:01] I'm just giving you what the guard has
[1:02:02] put on my heart. But we all have an
[1:02:05] appointed time. There's kids in the
[1:02:07] hospital being born that maybe have one
[1:02:09] day, maybe have one minute, maybe have
[1:02:12] five minutes, maybe I won't be here in
[1:02:14] five minutes. Maybe I'll maybe I'll be
[1:02:16] gone tomorrow. Maybe you will be. Maybe
[1:02:19] this will be your only service. Maybe
[1:02:21] this will be your your last service.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you to to to find
[1:02:26] Jesus Christ.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe you just say, "Brother, I want the
[1:02:30] Holy Ghost." He wants to give it to you
[1:02:32] more than you want it.
[1:02:35] That's our God tonight. And I'm here to
[1:02:37] tell you that take back the time that
[1:02:39] the devil tries to fill it up with this
[1:02:41] and this Facebook and this and that.
[1:02:44] He's always trying to fill your time up.
[1:02:46] Maybe it's more work. Maybe you say,
[1:02:48] "Well, Brother Chris, if I go take this
[1:02:49] job over here, well, they'll pay me
[1:02:51] 200,000, but there's no church."
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; That don't line up.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That don't light up
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; because guess what? It could tear your
[1:03:02] whole family apart.
[1:03:04] Don't chase them things. I tell you, I
[1:03:06] told the boys the other day, I said,
[1:03:07] "Isaac, one thing I want you to go home
[1:03:10] with, seek ye the kingdom of before I
[1:03:13] leave this earth is you seek the kingdom
[1:03:15] of God first and everything else will be
[1:03:18] added."
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; If you could just get one thing out of
[1:03:22] this service, seek ye the kingdom of God
[1:03:24] first and everything else will be added.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Seek it with your whole heart. Don't go
[1:03:30] halfway. Don't go just a little bit, but
[1:03:33] give God all you got.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Give him everything you got. Say, "Lord,
[1:03:38] I'm tired of living here and I'm living
[1:03:40] here in the world.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; I believe the message on Wednesday and f
[1:03:45] Sunday, but people wouldn't know behind
[1:03:47] closed doors if I believe this message
[1:03:50] or I believe Jesus Christ."
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying it. I'm just
[1:03:54] here to tell you tonight, we got to take
[1:03:55] back the time.
[1:03:58] I was reading I was reading Isaiah in
[1:04:01] the hotel room. Isaiah 60 1-3.
[1:04:06] It says, "Arise, shine for thy light is
[1:04:08] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:04:10] upon thee."
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Another translation said, "Rise up in
[1:04:14] splendor and be radiant for the light
[1:04:16] has drawn and Yahweh's glory now streams
[1:04:20] from you."
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we live in a time that we
[1:04:25] should be the happiest people.
[1:04:28] You people should look at you today and
[1:04:30] I'm tell you people say, "Man, you're
[1:04:31] crazy. You I'm just leave me that way
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; because the more I hear the truth and
[1:04:38] the more revelation." Brother Re says,
[1:04:40] "Pray for revelation more than
[1:04:42] anything."
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; And it's a progression. It's it's a
[1:04:46] studying of the word. It's saying,
[1:04:48] "Lord, I want more revelation." And it's
[1:04:50] progression.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; You progress in the Lord every single
[1:04:55] day. But where have you been lately?
[1:04:57] Have you been praying? Have you been
[1:04:58] reading your Bible? We got everything on
[1:05:01] our apps. We got on the iPhone. We
[1:05:03] Everything is at our hands. But too many
[1:05:06] times we spend hours and hours on
[1:05:09] nonsense.
[1:05:12] When's the last time you grabbed your
[1:05:14] family like supper table and said, "You
[1:05:15] know what? Put the phones down.
[1:05:19] Put them over in the corner
[1:05:22] and redeem the time back."
[1:05:25] It flies like that. My son just got his
[1:05:27] license the other day. I'm telling you,
[1:05:29] it it literally hit me like a ton of
[1:05:31] bricks. He's already driving. I'm said,
[1:05:34] "Lord, this can't be." And before you
[1:05:36] know it, in a blink of an eye, you're
[1:05:38] 18, you're 20, you're 40, you're 60,
[1:05:41] you're 70. What are you doing for God?
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you tonight. I hope this
[1:05:47] is okay.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you tonight to redeem
[1:05:50] the time.
[1:05:56] As the prophet of God says, I like this.
[1:05:59] He said, "This is the hour." He said,
[1:06:01] "This is the greatest hour that the
[1:06:03] church has ever moved into." I say,
[1:06:04] "Amen."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Just before the coming of the
[1:06:09] bridegroom."
[1:06:11] He said, "Oh, the real church of the
[1:06:13] living God ought to be on fire."
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Burning with the light
[1:06:20] of the gospel, being vindicated among
[1:06:23] them."
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I read it again. The real church of the
[1:06:27] living God ought to be on fire.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Why we got a wet blanket on us tonight?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Why do we walk around all down and out,
[1:06:38] even in your trials, just praise them.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; God knows about your trials before you
[1:06:45] even get to them. Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; You might be going through a mountaintop
[1:06:49] experience. You might be in a valley
[1:06:51] tonight. But I'm here to tell you, still
[1:06:53] praise them.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I'll still praise you."
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; If you can't lift your hands up, I'll
[1:06:59] come by and lift them up for you.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe the one next to you just sometimes
[1:07:04] just budge them a little bit. Say, "Hey,
[1:07:06] are you awake
[1:07:09] or did you come to sleep tonight?
[1:07:12] Redeem the time bag." He said the real
[1:07:14] church of the living God ought to be on
[1:07:16] fire.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; This is 1964. He said being vindicated.
[1:07:20] He said be on fire. He said rise and
[1:07:22] shine for the light has come to you.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; The light has come to you.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He said the light of this day. Isaiah
[1:07:32] was the light of this day. Noah was the
[1:07:35] light of his day. Why? He had a word
[1:07:37] manifest. Do you had the word manifest
[1:07:40] to you?
[1:07:43] Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said in the gospel, the Bible,
[1:07:47] the word for this day is it is the light
[1:07:50] of this day. What a glorious time we're
[1:07:52] living.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I say amen to that.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk around with a
[1:07:59] frown and think about a bomb that
[1:08:00] Russia's got.
[1:08:02] You can look and say, "I got the best
[1:08:04] bomb shelter there is,
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris. I got the best bomb
[1:08:09] shelter when people are going to be
[1:08:10] hiding from this and hiding for that.
[1:08:12] You're under the wings of the the
[1:08:14] Jehovah tonight.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; When before the first bomb drops, you
[1:08:20] could just be on the wings and say,
[1:08:22] "Lord, farewell. Farewell, sweet hour of
[1:08:25] prayer." Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you tonight, if you
[1:08:30] haven't jumped on his wings, I'm here to
[1:08:32] encourage you tonight to jump on his
[1:08:35] wings and let them become reality to to
[1:08:37] you.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And if you lost your first love, go find
[1:08:42] your first love.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Fall back in love with the one maybe you
[1:08:48] left them on. Left you maybe wherever
[1:08:50] you left them, go find where you left
[1:08:52] them.
[1:08:54] Maybe wherever you left him, just go
[1:08:56] back and say, "Lord, I've left you." But
[1:08:58] you know what? You know the good thing
[1:09:00] about our God is he never left you.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; No matter how far you think God has went
[1:09:07] away from you tonight, he's in the same
[1:09:09] place saying, "Come home."
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Come home tonight. Redeem
[1:09:17] the time where there's time available."
[1:09:21] Maybe young people tonight say, "I'm
[1:09:22] going to wait till I get home to
[1:09:24] surrender to God." What about tonight?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; How about tonight? Say, "Lord, feel I'm
[1:09:30] not leaving this place till you fill me
[1:09:32] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; How about tonight? Don't wait till you
[1:09:37] get home. While the word's going forth,
[1:09:40] say, "Lord, that's me.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; That's me. I You just for one person
[1:09:46] tonight, it's worth it all. Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; It was for one person that is worth it
[1:09:53] all.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I thought about in time in Greek how it
[1:09:58] talks about Kronos time. And I looked
[1:10:00] that up in the Greek and that's like a
[1:10:02] time on the calendar that we measure
[1:10:04] things by. We measure by Kronos time
[1:10:07] meaning year minutes and hours and days
[1:10:10] and years. We try to measure God by
[1:10:13] that. But you can't measure God by
[1:10:15] Kronos time. Yeah,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; but we know we can look at Israel and we
[1:10:19] look at times and and and earthquakes
[1:10:21] and divers manners, but God is I wrote
[1:10:24] the I looked this up was interesting.
[1:10:26] He's in a chyros time with meaning
[1:10:29] appointed God's time. It says the Greek
[1:10:32] word is in God's season. It's God's
[1:10:34] appointed time. It's a divine
[1:10:37] opportunity where God acts or calls us
[1:10:39] to act in due season. I like this. said
[1:10:43] it's about perfect per purposeful time
[1:10:46] moments when heaven touches earth.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Moments when heaven touches earth,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; I could care less. You can say, "Bro,
[1:10:57] good. I've been the message 50 years and
[1:10:59] 30 years." Maybe that's what's wrong
[1:11:01] with you.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's time to wake up tonight and
[1:11:05] put a little joy in your step and say,
[1:11:07] "Lord, I want to be on fire.
[1:11:10] I want the Holy Ghost to fill me. I want
[1:11:13] him to refill me.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe you come in to church and I'm just
[1:11:19] barely making it.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to leave that way.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; You can accept your appointed time and
[1:11:27] say, "Devil, it's been long enough.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living down. I'm tired of
[1:11:33] living out."
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; When you can say, "Young people, you
[1:11:37] know what? My daddy won't pray. I'll
[1:11:39] pray.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; My daddy won't read the Bible. I'll read
[1:11:42] the Bible.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll be the family that turns
[1:11:47] your family around and you go home in
[1:11:49] your schools.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And you leave tonight and they say,
[1:11:53] "What's wrong with you, brother?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I ain't never seen them act like that.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; If it can last 25 years, it can keep
[1:12:01] lasting.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that we don't have to
[1:12:05] keep, oh, I keep going back and forth?
[1:12:07] God will keep filling you up as much as
[1:12:09] you'll receive.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Maybe some of you are
[1:12:14] thinking tonight, "Well, I've went too
[1:12:16] far.
[1:12:18] Brother Chris, I went too far." The
[1:12:20] prophet said, "No, if that deep call to
[1:12:23] the deep, if that deep call to the deep
[1:12:25] is responding, I'm encouraging you
[1:12:28] tonight to respond to it
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; to say, "Brother Chris, I want to
[1:12:33] respond to that. I'm tired of playing
[1:12:35] church. I'm tired of living this way.
[1:12:38] I'm tired of drinking.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, that ain't the message. Yeah,
[1:12:42] it is.
[1:12:44] We just come in here all dressed up.
[1:12:46] It's time for church.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; But too many times we just need to be
[1:12:51] real with God
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I want you to work on
[1:12:54] this guy."
[1:12:59] Too many times we give our time away to
[1:13:01] nonsense things.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; But what really matters the most is
[1:13:06] giving our time to God
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and saying God I want you I want you
[1:13:11] getting up get in the moment where I
[1:13:12] wake up in the morning say God what can
[1:13:14] I do for you?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I get up in the morning brother David
[1:13:19] and you get up in the morning you say
[1:13:21] God I'm awake what can I do for you? You
[1:13:25] awake 24 hours. I got to sleep eight all
[1:13:28] every every single day. I got to spend
[1:13:30] eight hours sleeping.
[1:13:32] Maybe you only get two. Maybe get five.
[1:13:35] Maybe you work third shift. But I'm here
[1:13:37] to tell you, do something for God.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying beat someone over the
[1:13:42] head with a with a message book. Just be
[1:13:45] uh be alive. Be salty.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; People are looking in this day and age
[1:13:51] we live in. They just want to see some
[1:13:53] salt.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; They want something to savor from and
[1:13:56] say, "I want what he's got."
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But we live in a time where it's
[1:14:08] so fast and everything is 100 miles an
[1:14:11] hour.
[1:14:13] I live in that time too that the devil
[1:14:16] wants to keep you so busy and the last
[1:14:19] thing he wants you to do is just get on
[1:14:20] your knees tonight and just thank him.
[1:14:23] Always say a little prayer. Well, you
[1:14:25] lay me down to sleep. Oh God, I got two
[1:14:28] minutes for you, but I've had all day.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't want to say. I'm
[1:14:34] just here to tell you.
[1:14:36] But I want to be in a time where I say,
[1:14:38] "Lord, I want to say I just want to talk
[1:14:40] to you every day. I want to be in a
[1:14:43] constant prayer. Not not just a not just
[1:14:45] my brother, not just not brother Andrew,
[1:14:47] not just a constant, well, I talk to you
[1:14:49] occasionally, but no, just talk to him
[1:14:51] like you talking to me.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I I love you. I got this. He
[1:14:56] already knows what you're going through.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He knows your every need, your sisters,
[1:15:02] brothers. He knows your every care
[1:15:03] before you even ask him.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Our God's a big God.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; My daddy is a big God. Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; He owns a cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; He created this universe.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; He can speak your trials out of
[1:15:21] existence. He's just waiting for you to
[1:15:24] step forward and put some faith in the
[1:15:26] action.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Stop talking about it. Just say, "Lord,
[1:15:30] I surrender to you."
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; No matter what you going through, just
[1:15:34] say, "Lord, I'm going to step forward
[1:15:36] tonight
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to put the the past in the
[1:15:39] past." But too many times we live in a
[1:15:41] time where we look to the rearview
[1:15:43] mirror.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden the brothers in the
[1:15:46] back, we live in a time where we're too
[1:15:48] worried about the what happened in the
[1:15:49] past and the future. What about now?
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; What about now? What is God doing for
[1:15:55] you now?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, he gave you breath in your body.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; He put gas in your tank to get here.
[1:16:04] Maybe you only got five miles to empty.
[1:16:08] Maybe you came in here spiritually five
[1:16:10] miles to empty.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, he wants to
[1:16:13] refill you tonight.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; As as David said, I lost the joy of my
[1:16:18] salvation. The prophet said he didn't
[1:16:20] lose his salvation. He lost the joy.
[1:16:23] Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, you came
[1:16:25] all the way here just cuz hey, I need a
[1:16:27] little bit of joy.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living depressed. I'm tired
[1:16:31] of living in anxiety. I'm tired of
[1:16:34] giving over to the devil.
[1:16:37] When all God says, "Hey, I've been
[1:16:38] waiting for you where you left me.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I've been waiting for you."
[1:16:44] Oh, think about it tonight, church. I
[1:16:46] hope this is okay. As Psalms 39:4
[1:16:51] through5 says, "Lord, talking about
[1:16:54] time, Lord, make me to know mine end,
[1:16:57] measure of my days."
[1:17:00] He says, "What is it that I may uh how
[1:17:03] frail I am be thought how how made my
[1:17:06] days as a handbreath and my age as
[1:17:10] nothing before thee."
[1:17:12] Verse uh James 4:14.
[1:17:15] It says, "Whereas you know not what you
[1:17:17] shall do tomorrow, for what is your
[1:17:20] life? It's even a vapor and appear for a
[1:17:23] little time and vanishes away." That's
[1:17:25] what he tells about your time today. It
[1:17:28] appears for a little while and it
[1:17:30] vanishes away. But I'm here to tell you
[1:17:33] that we just buried my father-in-law the
[1:17:35] other day and I preached this sermon
[1:17:38] and we had church. We didn't have a
[1:17:40] funeral. I said, "We're not having a
[1:17:42] funeral. We're going to have a
[1:17:43] celebration."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; We had straight church, man. It was
[1:17:47] great. I mean, it was so wonderful
[1:17:49] because I knew my father-in-law didn't
[1:17:50] want no sad funeral.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I told my wife, "If I die, y'all have
[1:17:54] revival." Brother David, wherever you're
[1:17:56] at, You you'll be in the revival, too,
[1:17:58] brother Andrew. Y'all come on. You You
[1:18:00] lead the singing.
[1:18:02] Y'all make sure we have revival service.
[1:18:05] I don't want to be just going over there
[1:18:06] mourning over me cuz I ain't mourning
[1:18:08] over there
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; when I met my reward. Everything I've
[1:18:14] been coming for, every time I've been
[1:18:16] pushing through all these trials, I just
[1:18:19] I'm telling you, I'm going to be dancing
[1:18:20] over there.
[1:18:22] Maybe it'd be good to let your hair down
[1:18:24] sometimes and stop being so stir sh and
[1:18:27] say, "Brother Chris, I'm just going to
[1:18:29] praise the Lord.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the person to the left
[1:18:33] thinks. I don't care a person to the
[1:18:35] right thinks."
[1:18:37] Just let it down tonight and say, "Lord,
[1:18:40] I'm tired of just living a fake life.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of hiding behind the message.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; I really want to surrender my life to
[1:18:51] God.
[1:18:52] I'm not saying you're not going to fall
[1:18:55] because I fell every day. But I'm here
[1:18:57] to tell you, what did the blood do? The
[1:19:00] blood on Calvary reaches deep.
[1:19:02] Everything that you've done, everything
[1:19:04] that all is under the blood. If you can
[1:19:07] make it right, it all paid the price for
[1:19:10] our sins. And is the same atonement is
[1:19:13] before you tonight.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; When you fall down, young people, get
[1:19:16] back up.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you, "Well,
[1:19:19] you're not saved.
[1:19:21] I hear it all the time. Well, I just
[1:19:23] don't think I'm saved, brother Chris.
[1:19:24] No, that's what the devil wants you to
[1:19:27] tell you. You're not saved. But I'm here
[1:19:28] to tell you to get back up, confess it,
[1:19:31] and say, "Lord, I'm sorry." And move
[1:19:33] forward.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; But we live in that state of mind, the
[1:19:38] busyiness where the devil wants to bring
[1:19:39] us down down that path of life. As
[1:19:42] Psalms 90:12 says, "So teach us to
[1:19:45] number our days that we may apply our
[1:19:47] hearts into wisdom." Ecclesiastes 3:1,
[1:19:52] to everything there is a season and a
[1:19:54] time and every purpose under heaven.
[1:19:57] Ecclesiastes 3:17, we're talking about
[1:19:59] time. God shall bring every work unto
[1:20:02] judgment with every secret thing,
[1:20:04] whether it be good or whether it be
[1:20:06] evil.
[1:20:07] Think about it.
[1:20:12] Galatians 6, if you can pull that up.
[1:20:14] Galatians 6:9
[1:20:17] it says, "And let us not be weary
[1:20:20] and welloing for the season we shall
[1:20:22] reap if we faint not." Verse 10, "As we
[1:20:26] have therefore opportunity,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; let us do good unto all men, not just
[1:20:33] some men." And you know, it's so easy to
[1:20:36] love the people that love you.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; It's easy. I'm telling you, I know it's
[1:20:43] easy to love someone that loves you, but
[1:20:44] what about someone that don't love you?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; What about someone that hates you? You
[1:20:50] could say, "I've been praying for you.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you, I love you
[1:20:54] today."
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We live in that time.
[1:21:02] As we as we just gear down this, I want
[1:21:05] to read what else I want to turn to this
[1:21:08] scripture if that's okay. saw. Matthew
[1:21:10] 24,
[1:21:12] Matthew 24
[1:21:15] verse 11,
[1:21:17] it says, "And many false prophets shall
[1:21:19] rise and shall deceive many, and because
[1:21:22] iniquity shall abound, and the love of
[1:21:24] many shall wax cold." I believe that's
[1:21:26] what they were living in.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; It says, "But he that shall endure to
[1:21:31] the end shall shame shall be saved."
[1:21:34] What am I saying to you tonight? It's
[1:21:36] it's we you don't have but so much time.
[1:21:39] And I'm here to tell you to endure to
[1:21:41] the end with everything you got. Give it
[1:21:44] all you got for Jesus Christ. If I could
[1:21:46] have sold out before 20 years old, I
[1:21:49] would have if id have knew what I knew
[1:21:51] today, young people, I would have sold
[1:21:52] out way before 20 years old.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have waited so long. I would
[1:21:58] have surrendered to a lot longer. If I
[1:22:01] could go back, but I can't go back. I
[1:22:03] got to stay forward
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; and just say, you know what? I'm gonna
[1:22:06] take this time that I'm living in and
[1:22:08] live it all that I got for Jesus Christ.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God goes on to say, he
[1:22:16] said, you'd ask him to, he said, you'd
[1:22:18] ask them about it. Well, we got our
[1:22:20] television.
[1:22:22] He said, that's how we find comfort.
[1:22:24] See, that's the American attitude. You
[1:22:26] see, we got television. We got plenty of
[1:22:30] money. We got fine cars. We got nice
[1:22:33] houses. Wouldn't you say amen?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "What do we need with the
[1:22:38] Lord?"
[1:22:40] He said, "We don't need that." He said,
[1:22:42] "We don't need that." He said, "That's
[1:22:44] the attitude."
[1:22:46] He goes on to say, he says, "About the
[1:22:48] only religion and salvation we have in
[1:22:50] love is amongst the real godly people."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, the Bible said that
[1:22:58] you that would happen, you Bible
[1:23:00] readers." He said, "I heard the holy
[1:23:02] amen." And you preachers back there,
[1:23:04] that's right. Love would be so far away
[1:23:06] in the last days.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; The only love there would be left would
[1:23:13] be between the elect of God's people.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's why you want to be around the
[1:23:20] elect of God's people
[1:23:23] because there's a love that we need.
[1:23:25] There's a I need you and you need me.
[1:23:28] Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; We need each other.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a time to go sit at home in a
[1:23:34] corner.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; When the Bible says come to church more
[1:23:38] in the days as the days are approaching
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; more so, not less, more.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; That's the time we're living in.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; But even the devil will try to come up
[1:23:51] and say, "Well, maybe not. Maybe no. Go
[1:23:53] to church. Get involved, young people.
[1:23:56] Be around the youth. be around godly
[1:23:58] influences. My wife got me something the
[1:24:00] other not long ago. I think it was last
[1:24:01] Christmas and I walked in the other day
[1:24:03] and it was on the wall and it said,
[1:24:06] "Keep your kids around the I'm
[1:24:08] paraphrasing, but he says basically keep
[1:24:11] your home in an atmosphere that your
[1:24:14] that your kids will want to bring your
[1:24:15] kids to."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; She put it on the wall. I walked in the
[1:24:19] other day and I said, "Wow, I love that.
[1:24:21] I love that quote because I want my home
[1:24:24] to have so much love. Maybe they don't
[1:24:26] know a quote, but they feel the love of
[1:24:28] God.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; oozing out of us that they go, "Hey, I
[1:24:33] want that real thing that he's got."
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:24:39] It's just the love of God.
[1:24:42] As the magicians come,
[1:24:45] he says, "Oh, blessed and eternal God,
[1:24:47] the prophet says, who brought again the
[1:24:50] Lord Jesus from the dead." This is in
[1:24:53] the message love. And he has now been
[1:24:56] presented to us after 1900 years yet
[1:24:59] alive and just as sufficient in his
[1:25:01] power in his presence as he was 1900
[1:25:04] years ago when he walked in Galilee. And
[1:25:08] we thank he's he's praying. He says and
[1:25:10] we thank our father because thou has
[1:25:12] done this. He says in the dark and this
[1:25:15] dark evil day that we're living when
[1:25:18] there's so much confusion on every hand.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I'm like amen.
[1:25:23] So much confusion on every hand. He said
[1:25:26] among the world and the nations in
[1:25:28] politics and every walk of life. We're
[1:25:32] talking about time.
[1:25:34] He said even to the Christian walk there
[1:25:36] is confusion. Yet there is confusion.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said but we're so glad to know
[1:25:44] that Jesus still lives.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "And as the
[1:25:49] scripture has said of him, the same
[1:25:52] yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And when you see the end approaching
[1:25:56] rapidly and the signs of the near
[1:25:59] coming, our hearts jump for joy. When we
[1:26:02] rest upon the blessed promise that he is
[1:26:05] the same, and that he loves us and he
[1:26:08] gave himself for us.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; I thought about I thought about in
[1:26:13] closing, I thought about Cain and Abel
[1:26:16] tonight.
[1:26:17] And I was back there and I kind of just
[1:26:19] started thinking about Cain and Abel,
[1:26:21] how he presented a sacrifice and they
[1:26:24] they he took his first firstlings of the
[1:26:26] lamb. And brother Bram goes on to say
[1:26:29] and paraphrasing for time. But here he
[1:26:31] goes on, he says, "Cain could have told
[1:26:32] for a year maybe and he presented it and
[1:26:36] he and he got it all ready and he waited
[1:26:38] a whole year and he he he got that's how
[1:26:40] we do sometimes.
[1:26:42] We want to know, oh well, I'm I need to
[1:26:45] wait till I wait till I'm perfect.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; God's come from unperfect people
[1:26:50] tonight. He came for me and you tonight.
[1:26:53] He wants to clean you up.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do the cleaning. You
[1:26:58] just have to do the surrendering.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; You just have to surrender to God. And
[1:27:04] you know what he said? He said, "Can and
[1:27:06] maybe they play something softly
[1:27:08] tonight, but but here here comes Cain."
[1:27:10] Think about this.
[1:27:13] He spent, he said, about maybe a year
[1:27:15] tolling, getting it all pretty. And he
[1:27:18] said, "Here comes Abel." Cain and Abel.
[1:27:20] Here comes Abel.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "He's dragging this lamb."
[1:27:25] Just picture this tonight for a minute.
[1:27:27] He said, "He's pulling this lamb." And
[1:27:30] he's dragging this old lamb. And his
[1:27:32] feet don't want to go.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Think about what our Jesus did for you
[1:27:36] tonight.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He's dragging this lamb. He said maybe
[1:27:39] he had a grape vine. He didn't have a
[1:27:42] hemp or anything. He said maybe it was a
[1:27:44] grape vine around his neck and he's
[1:27:45] pulling him and he says he gets him up
[1:27:48] to a rock and and he gets him up to the
[1:27:50] rock
[1:27:52] and he said he gets him to this rock and
[1:27:54] he maybe maybe maybe lays him down and
[1:27:56] he he grabs this rock and it's edged and
[1:27:58] he starts to beat him in his throat and
[1:28:00] he starts to beat him after one after
[1:28:02] another
[1:28:04] and he said blood's just pouring over
[1:28:06] this lamb.
[1:28:07] his white wool just becomes bloody.
[1:28:12] That's what Jesus Christ done for me and
[1:28:14] you tonight.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That's what our in the most innocent
[1:28:19] lamb has done for you tonight.
[1:28:22] We're living in a time that we should
[1:28:24] realize what God has done for me. I'll
[1:28:27] take what God has done for me. I'll
[1:28:29] share it with the world.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, I'm not a
[1:28:33] preacher." No, but you could be on your
[1:28:36] job and you could tell them about Jesus.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe they're waiting for your life to
[1:28:41] say just surrender tonight and say,
[1:28:43] "Lord,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I want to give you my time. I'm tired of
[1:28:48] living this rat race of time that I
[1:28:50] don't give God much time. I just give
[1:28:53] them what I have left.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I wait till the end of the day to say,
[1:28:58] "Here's a little bit of time.
[1:29:04] I know it's quiet, but it's real.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to me tonight, too.
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:13] But we serve a God that's rich in mercy.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; We serve a God
[1:29:21] that just says, "Come home."
[1:29:24] Young people, we serve a God that could
[1:29:27] take a broke up home that could take a
[1:29:29] boy that my mom scheduled a do a
[1:29:34] abortion one night. My dad said, "You
[1:29:36] took so much medicine, we're going to
[1:29:38] have to schedule abortion.
[1:29:43] We're going to have to set it up." So,
[1:29:44] they go through the whole thing and they
[1:29:46] set it up. They go through abortion.
[1:29:48] They get it to the end and she's like,
[1:29:50] "You know what? I'm not going to do it."
[1:29:51] He said, "Well, I will beat you until
[1:29:53] you do it.
[1:29:56] I will beat you till you until you do
[1:29:58] abortion." He won't be able to talk.
[1:30:00] They said he won't be able to speak. He
[1:30:03] won't be able to move.
[1:30:06] But we serve a God that I'm speaking to
[1:30:08] you tonight.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; I sp a godly mother that laid her head
[1:30:13] in a corner of a hospital room that
[1:30:15] said, "If you kill me, I'm still having
[1:30:18] this baby.
[1:30:21] Think about what he's done for you
[1:30:23] tonight.
[1:30:25] Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, I have a
[1:30:26] testimony. I'm going through this and
[1:30:28] maybe but you're here tonight and you
[1:30:30] say, "God, I'm tired of running.
[1:30:35] I'm tired of filling up air with this
[1:30:37] and that. He just wants your best."
[1:30:41] And you know what? You can come tonight
[1:30:43] the way you are, just like Abel did. He
[1:30:47] took his first first lings. It says in
[1:30:49] the Bible, he took just the first leaves
[1:30:51] and he said, "God, here it is. This is
[1:30:53] all I got."
[1:30:55] He said, "This is all I got." That's
[1:30:57] what he wants. You don't have to do the
[1:30:59] cleaning. He just wants what you got.
[1:31:01] He'll do the cleaning.
[1:31:04] He'll give you joy in your heart if he's
[1:31:06] gone. If you lost your motivation,
[1:31:08] you've lost some tonight. Say, "God, I
[1:31:10] want my joy back. I want the fire, the
[1:31:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost to come
[1:31:15] sweeping through my heart.
[1:31:18] And some of you, maybe you got a lost
[1:31:20] wayward kid tonight.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'm here to tell you,
[1:31:24] sister, you claim them tonight.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says they're yours.
[1:31:31] The Bible says your family, your house,
[1:31:33] your house is yours.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; But too many times we forget what the
[1:31:38] scripture says, that your house is
[1:31:40] yours. Look at Rahab. She put the
[1:31:41] scarlet cord out and claimed her whole
[1:31:44] house.
[1:31:45] You might be the very reason you've
[1:31:47] pushed to the end and all your family
[1:31:50] get in.
[1:31:52] I'm here to tell you, I'm pushing to the
[1:31:54] end. I got lost ones in my family. I got
[1:31:56] my dad and this person and that person
[1:31:58] that with a broke up home, but I'm going
[1:32:00] to press on to the high calling of God.
[1:32:03] He's gave us a message. He's opened the
[1:32:06] revelation. He's opened the Bible
[1:32:08] tonight.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it? Redeem your
[1:32:12] time back, church.
[1:32:15] with all heads bowed.
[1:32:22] Baby, there's one.
[1:32:25] However you feel led tonight,
[1:32:30] the altar's open. I know it's a
[1:32:33] Wednesday night. I'm sorry if it went a
[1:32:35] little long,
[1:32:37] but we could be on Facebook for four
[1:32:39] hours. We could be in our emails for
[1:32:42] hours. We can be at work on emails for
[1:32:44] endless hours,
[1:32:47] but then we worry about time for maybe
[1:32:49] going 20 minutes over.
[1:32:53] Maybe you say, "I'm you're speaking to
[1:32:54] me tonight."
[1:32:57] Maybe it's just for one person steps out
[1:32:58] and say, "You know what? I want that
[1:33:01] tonight.
[1:33:02] I want another refilling.
[1:33:05] I want another I I I'm tired of living
[1:33:08] this little life just a rat race to say
[1:33:11] God.
[1:33:14] I want more of you.
[1:33:17] I really want the salvation of the Holy
[1:33:19] Ghost.
[1:33:22] However you feel led tonight as they
[1:33:24] sing a song as my brother just sings a
[1:33:28] song.
[1:33:31] Maybe there's one. Raise their hand.
[1:33:32] Say, "Brother Chris, that's me." No one
[1:33:35] looking.
[1:33:37] That's me. You spoke to me tonight.
[1:33:40] Oh my. Lord, touch them. Touch them,
[1:33:43] Lord.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, you see these hands tonight.
[1:33:49] You see them in their seats tonight.
[1:33:50] Raise my hands are up. I say, "Lord,
[1:33:52] fill me again.
[1:33:54] Refill me, Lord." When the world thinks
[1:33:57] I'm not beautiful, say, "Lord, I'm not
[1:33:59] mirroring after the world. I'm nearing
[1:34:01] half the Bible.
[1:34:04] You don't have to live in that anymore.
[1:34:05] You don't have to live in depression.
[1:34:07] You don't have to live in anxiety.
[1:34:10] Just say, "Lord, here I am like Abel
[1:34:12] tonight. I just lay it at your feet. I
[1:34:15] ain't much." That's what God uses.
[1:34:20] That's what God uses.
[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:24] Oh, sing it tonight. Oh, teach.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Teach me, Lord.
[1:34:30] to wait
[1:34:33] down on.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; However you feel that tonight
[1:34:42] the time
[1:34:44] you answer
[1:34:47] my plea.
[1:34:50] Teach me
[1:34:52] to rely
[1:34:56] on my
[1:35:00] Can we stand?
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:13] That wait
[1:35:15] upon the Lord.
[1:35:18] shall renew
[1:35:21] next day.
[1:35:24] They shall mountain
[1:35:27] with me.
[1:35:35] They shall run
[1:35:38] and not be.
[1:35:41] They shall walk
[1:35:43] and not fade.
[1:35:46] Teach me Lord,
[1:35:49] teach me Lord.
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful message tonight.
[1:35:57] Amen. Aren't you thankful for the Lord?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord always giving us
[1:36:02] another reminder when we come to church,
[1:36:04] it's to take inventory. And I feel
[1:36:07] tonight that in my heart, the Lord spoke
[1:36:10] to my heart and I want to check up. You
[1:36:12] know, I want to take inventory. Lord
[1:36:14] brought conviction and I'm thankful. You
[1:36:16] could hear the spirit cry out of our
[1:36:18] brother's heart just pleading what are
[1:36:21] we putting our time into? You know, what
[1:36:23] things have alled us that has some value
[1:36:26] to to spend our time? I was thinking
[1:36:28] about redeeming things. There's so many
[1:36:31] things that we put forth on time. I will
[1:36:34] get points on this. I'll take the time
[1:36:36] to redeem points on this and that. But
[1:36:39] here's the Lord saying, "I'm over here.
[1:36:42] Will you spend a little time with me?"
[1:36:45] Oh, I think that that's the greatest
[1:36:47] thing that a believer can do is spend
[1:36:49] time with the Lord.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; You know what? What a You know, we must
[1:36:54] believe that God is and that he's a
[1:36:56] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:36:58] him. And I believe that's that's
[1:37:01] redeeming the time. I I I just feel in
[1:37:03] my heart to examine myself. What's
[1:37:06] motivating me? What's what's driving me
[1:37:08] to spend the time that I'm spending? Oh,
[1:37:11] I thank the Lord for the Isab tonight. I
[1:37:14] I I want to I want to say, God, search
[1:37:16] me. Try me. Oh God, refine me. Oh, I
[1:37:21] want to be spent for the Lord. Amen. I
[1:37:23] know that's your heart's desire. Why
[1:37:25] don't we sing that song? Let the
[1:37:27] worshippers arise. I feel like it's time
[1:37:29] to worship the Lord. What what an
[1:37:32] admonition to redeem the time. Amen.
[1:37:35] Aren't you thankful to the Lord?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; We don't have Tomorrow's not a
[1:37:40] guarantee. We've had people come through
[1:37:42] and they might have thought they had the
[1:37:44] future uh to to give to the Lord, but
[1:37:47] tonight is the night to give to the
[1:37:49] Lord. And if God gives us tomorrow,
[1:37:51] let's give uh God tomorrow. Let's give
[1:37:54] him all that we got. Let's let's have
[1:37:56] like the spirit of David is saying, "My
[1:37:58] time is in his hand." Amen. Let's sing
[1:38:01] this together.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; I see that you are drawing
[1:38:07] a line in the sand. I want to be
[1:38:11] standing on your side.
[1:38:14] Oh, holding your hand.
[1:38:17] Let your kingom come. Let it live in me.
[1:38:24] This is my
[1:38:28] This is my belief. Let the worippers.
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:37] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[1:38:45] Oh, I surrender
[1:38:47] my heart.
[1:38:53] I surrender to the king.
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:59] Oh
[1:39:01] father, I hear it growing louder.
[1:39:06] Song of your redeemer
[1:39:09] as the saints of all the nations
[1:39:13] are awakening to sing.
[1:39:16] From our hearts we come together.
[1:39:20] Oh heaven is his
[1:39:26] song to our
[1:39:30] worship.
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:36] Let the sun and the daughters sing.
[1:39:41] [Music]
[1:39:44] I surrender
[1:39:46] my heart.
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:51] I surrender to the king.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:58] Praise the Lord. As you feel on your
[1:40:01] heart to come and brother pray with you,
[1:40:05] you just want to get it settled and just
[1:40:06] say, "From this time forward, Lord, I
[1:40:08] want my time. What I have, I can commit

[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; As we prepare to dismiss you tonight,
[1:56:07] you know, as brother Chris was closing
[1:56:10] and he mentioned about his stepfather
[1:56:14] beating,
[1:56:16] beating trying to have that baby
[1:56:19] aborted. And I I just think that the
[1:56:22] enemy is trying to beat us and enslave
[1:56:25] us and be a taskmaster and a pharaoh
[1:56:28] trying to beat the Christ out of us. But
[1:56:31] I want to say tonight with every breath
[1:56:33] that I have, with every moment that I
[1:56:36] have, I'm a son of God. I want to claim
[1:56:39] the victory that Jesus Christ bought for
[1:56:42] me, that he manifested himself at the
[1:56:45] end time. and I want to go and redeem
[1:56:47] the time and go into the storehouse and
[1:56:49] claim what's mine. Amen. That's what we
[1:56:52] want to do tonight. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:56:54] hearts together.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you,
[1:57:01] God, for this wonderful time that you've
[1:57:03] given us tonight, Lord, to remind us, oh
[1:57:07] God, that this life is just a vapor in
[1:57:10] the wind and the only thing that really
[1:57:12] will matter at the end of the road is
[1:57:14] what we did for you. And Lord, it was
[1:57:18] the things that you revealed to us and
[1:57:20] how we acted upon it, Lord, that will be
[1:57:23] the things that please you, Lord. Help
[1:57:25] us to be faithful with what you've
[1:57:28] given, Lord. We just want to give you
[1:57:30] our best in everything, Father. And so,
[1:57:33] as we go tonight, Lord, we pray that, oh
[1:57:36] God, there would be opportunities, Lord,
[1:57:40] that when we face them, Lord, may you
[1:57:42] quicken to us. This is my time. This is
[1:57:45] my opportunity to claim what I believe
[1:57:48] is true and share it with somebody else
[1:57:51] and bless your people as they go, Lord.
[1:57:53] And I pray that you'd give them grace
[1:57:55] and strength and health, Lord. And Lord,
[1:57:59] just may we all return back here on
[1:58:02] Sunday and prayed up. and even this the
[1:58:05] little event on Saturday. Lord, I just
[1:58:08] pray that we go and remember our pastor
[1:58:12] and give him, oh God, strength for this
[1:58:14] weekend. We just commit all things into
[1:58:17] your hands in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:58:20] Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[1:58:25] I, you know, I just feel like singing
[1:58:27] that song, Joy is the flag. You know,
[1:58:30] the devil's tried to beat us up, but
[1:58:31] there's a joy that's been restored.
[1:58:33] Amen. God bless you as you go. Let's
[1:58:36] sing this as we go.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Joy is the flag on high from the castle
[1:58:43] of my heart. From the castle of my
[1:58:47] heart. From the castle of my heart. For
[1:58:50] you
[1:58:53] high from the castle of my heart. Cuz
[1:58:57] the king is in residence today.
[1:59:02] Let him fly in the sky. Let the whole
[1:59:07] world know. Let the whole world
[1:59:11] Let the world know. Let it fly in the
[1:59:16] sky. Let the whole world know that the
[1:59:21] king is in risk.
