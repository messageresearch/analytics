[44:31] we'll try not to be long
[44:37] tonight we'll just uh say a few words
[44:40] in Hebrews 11 uh chapter 1 it says now
[44:44] Faith verse one sorry now Faith is a
[44:47] substance of
[44:49] things hope for the evidence of things
[44:52] not seen by it the elders obtain a good
[44:55] report and through faith we understand
[44:58] that the worlds were framed by the word
[45:01] of God so that things which are seen
[45:04] were not made of things that do appear
[45:07] amen you may have your seats also uh
[45:10] let's just turn your Bibles to Luke uh
[45:13] uh chapter 4 and verse 4 I believe
[45:16] that's what we read this
[45:17] morning just read that one verse it says
[45:21] and when Jesus and and Jesus answered
[45:24] him and say it is written
[45:26] that men shall not live by bread alone
[45:29] but by every word of
[45:32] God I I just want to say uh perhaps so
[45:36] much just the recap and and and of what
[45:39] we heard this morning um I I I was as I
[45:45] was listening to the word this morning
[45:47] it's just so amazing how time and time
[45:50] again the Lord is trying to bring us in
[45:53] remembrance of the infallibility of his
[45:57] word that that to give us something that
[46:00] we know we can anchor in something we
[46:03] know that if we hold on to it will take
[46:06] us to the destination it's something
[46:08] that would never fail us Heaven and
[46:11] Earth will pass away as the scripture
[46:13] says but my word shall never pass away
[46:16] so it's something we can rest assure and
[46:19] know that if God spoke it if we can find
[46:22] it in the Bible if we heard it from our
[46:24] messenger if we heard it we can stake
[46:26] our life on it and know that it would
[46:28] produce the results that God promis will
[46:31] come to pass we don't have to add to it
[46:34] we don't have to take away from it we
[46:36] just have to take it the same way he
[46:38] spoke it if he says there will be a
[46:41] bride in the end time it doesn't matter
[46:43] what the condition looks like it doesn't
[46:46] matter if everybody fails away if God
[46:49] said there will be a bride in the end
[46:51] time God will produce a
[46:53] bride it's the same word that's spoke
[46:56] the world into existence it's the same
[46:58] word that is today there's no difference
[47:01] and so God is continuing to show us
[47:04] through what we heard this morning so we
[47:06] can rest assured that no matter what
[47:08] your condition is wherever you find
[47:10] yourself whether you are lacking whether
[47:12] do you call yourself weak with whatever
[47:15] situation you find yourself in the word
[47:17] of God can bring Restoration in your
[47:19] life and I want to say tonight whatever
[47:22] you have need of if you need healing
[47:25] take the word of God if you need
[47:27] Deliverance take the word of God if you
[47:29] need the Holy Ghost take the word of God
[47:32] why because if the word spoke it the
[47:35] word will produce it God spoke it and
[47:38] remember as we heard it this morning God
[47:40] is not in the business of speaking and
[47:43] let somebody else translate it for you
[47:45] give you the meaning of what he spoke no
[47:48] God is in the business that he speaks
[47:50] and he comes behind his word to tell you
[47:53] to show you or to bring you in the
[47:56] manifestation of what he spoke about so
[47:59] it's not two different person the same
[48:01] God so when he starts something we know
[48:04] he's going to finish it so when we take
[48:06] and I want to say this when we take the
[48:08] word of God we are taking the way of
[48:11] Victory when you take the word of God
[48:14] you stand on something that has been
[48:16] tested time and time again something
[48:18] that's stood the test of time something
[48:21] regardless of whatever the world is
[48:23] going on and whatever the condition of
[48:25] the world is in you when take the word
[48:27] of God you are taking a sure Victory you
[48:31] are taking something that it's not even
[48:33] going to be depend dependent on you it's
[48:36] going to depending on the author of the
[48:39] word that you are standing on to take
[48:41] you to the finish
[48:44] line and and that's why the devil hates
[48:47] it it will come and and as our pastor
[48:49] was speaking you go read that message
[48:51] Harvest time he will come and try to
[48:54] offer you all kinds of things things and
[48:56] it will come and on one side it will
[48:58] tell you it's not yours it doesn't
[49:00] belong to you you shouldn't claim it and
[49:03] and you know it's for other people and
[49:05] all of that and on the other side it'll
[49:06] tell you you are too good oh you've made
[49:09] it you don't need to press on anymore
[49:11] you've got it and he gives you a
[49:13] position and he gives you all of those
[49:14] things but what we understand is as
[49:16] children of God we stand up on what he
[49:19] says and we continue to praise for the
[49:22] manifestation because he will bring
[49:24] forth the result of what he promise amen
[49:28] so I as we read brother will say this in
[49:31] the invisible Union and I thought it was
[49:33] just so perfectly correct with what was
[49:36] being said this morning uh paragraph uh
[49:39] 24 and this is in the prayer it says now
[49:42] let us pray he says Dear God we have
[49:45] just read the word what we believe to be
[49:48] the sacred word of
[49:50] God and that's what we are believing
[49:53] that not one J or one title shall no
[49:57] wise pass from till until all is
[50:00] fulfilled and we believe that our Lord
[50:02] told us in revelation 22 chapter 22nd
[50:07] chapter that whatsoever it said
[50:09] whatsoever shall take one word or take
[50:11] away one word of it the same his part
[50:15] will be taken from the book of life and
[50:18] we see that by uh by and we see that by
[50:22] this representation of the word as s
[50:26] misre misrepresented it to Eve it caused
[50:29] her to doubt one word it threw the whole
[50:33] human race into a fallen chaos just one
[50:37] word and so and that's why as Christians
[50:41] we have to be careful the devil is not
[50:43] trying to cause you to disbelieve the
[50:45] whole world of God he he's just trying
[50:48] to insert doubt somewhere he's just
[50:50] trying to bring you into a condition
[50:52] where you uh something seems too great
[50:55] for you you something seems too
[50:57] impossible for you he's just trying to
[50:58] cause you to back off just a little bit
[51:01] but the word of God said it's every word
[51:03] that proceeded out of the mouth of God
[51:06] so if God spoke it we believe it so now
[51:08] he continues on he says then we see in
[51:11] the middle of the book he says came our
[51:13] lord Jesus and savior and he gave us a
[51:17] he gave us this quot quotation
[51:19] concerning it they said men shall not
[51:21] live by bread alone but by every word
[51:24] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[51:27] then the solemn warning uh in the last
[51:30] book of Revelation of Jesus Christ was
[51:33] it says whosoever shall add or take away
[51:35] one word his part will be taken uh taken
[51:39] from The Book of Life Now I want to say
[51:42] this that's why it's so important that
[51:45] we hold on to the whole word of God
[51:48] right not just the part of it we we hold
[51:51] on to the whole word of God it continues
[51:53] on it says oh oh God knowing and seeing
[51:58] how fragile it says we are knowing that
[52:01] we are walking on the uh uh uh uh B
[52:06] trads and the set of life and the moral
[52:08] life not knowing uh what time we are
[52:11] going to be uh summoned to answer on
[52:15] high let us oh Lord lay aside everything
[52:19] in our hearts and everything in our mind
[52:22] and look straight to your word tonight
[52:25] is says for you to come and interpret it
[52:29] with leaving oracles granted so God is
[52:34] The Interpreter with living oracles he
[52:37] he when he speaks it he brings the life
[52:40] of it to come to pass it's not just the
[52:43] words of man where you can come and take
[52:45] it as a human understanding but when he
[52:47] speaks it he wants the living Oracle to
[52:50] come to pass it says may your spirit
[52:53] fall upon us and and anoint the word in
[52:57] our hearts that we might go from here
[53:01] this evening better people than what the
[53:03] than we are now it says that we might
[53:06] have a close Insight on Jesus Christ
[53:09] Grant it Lord that we might understand
[53:11] that today we are living in the
[53:13] preparation of God for his people in
[53:16] this hour this great crucial dark time
[53:19] that we are living now God anoint us not
[53:22] it says not only speakers
[53:25] but here is it says and together make
[53:28] our hearts to tremble at your word that
[53:31] that the fear of God is the beginning of
[53:34] wisdom Grant it to us it says Grant this
[53:37] to us father we ask in the name in in
[53:39] Jesus name amen so yet we are people uh
[53:43] that hear the word of God and it has no
[53:45] effect on them they don't have the fear
[53:47] to to to come and to say to know oh this
[53:51] is the word of God I want to hang on
[53:53] with everything that's within me it is
[53:55] the word of God I want I want every part
[53:58] of it to play a role in my life and let
[54:00] me say this the word is the only thing
[54:02] that has the power of transformation
[54:05] amen so when you receive it that's why I
[54:09] said it's regardless of the condition
[54:11] that you are in when you receive it when
[54:14] he speaks about an overcomer he it's
[54:16] calling for an overcomer and he has the
[54:18] power to make you an overcomer so the
[54:21] receiver only the only requirement to
[54:24] the receiver is to have the faith to
[54:26] receive the word and it's up to the word
[54:29] to bring you into that Overcomer that
[54:31] it's calling for if the word is calling
[54:33] for Holiness it's not for you to go and
[54:36] try to produce Holiness in your own self
[54:38] no but it's for you to receive the word
[54:40] and say Lord you're calling for Holiness
[54:43] and I don't have it and I need it and
[54:45] it's up to the word itself to come into
[54:48] your life and begin to change your
[54:50] heart's desire begin to take away the
[54:53] things of the world and produce the
[54:55] Holiness that it's calling
[54:57] for the man shall not live by bread
[55:00] alone but by every word that shall
[55:02] proceed it out of the mouth of God I I
[55:04] was thinking about this and and I didn't
[55:07] get time to write it down you you when
[55:10] you go and you look at the Old Testament
[55:12] the scripture will tell you that
[55:14] everything that was made it was made by
[55:16] the word of God even the beginning was
[55:19] the word and the Word was with God as
[55:21] John will say and the Word was with God
[55:23] and everything was cre created by it and
[55:26] if you go and you even look you will see
[55:29] with the children of Israel God will
[55:31] tell them to go in and to plant the seed
[55:34] and they will produce forth fruits for
[55:36] them to eat and they will go and they
[55:38] will plant and and because of the law of
[55:41] the word of God it will produce for of
[55:44] fruit for them to eat but then there
[55:46] will come a time where God will tell
[55:47] them you didn't have to plant anything
[55:50] and I will eat you I will give you to
[55:52] eat the things that you haven't even
[55:54] planted yet
[55:55] so the word of God is no longer just
[55:58] govern our spiritual part even the very
[56:01] natural fruit that we eat is a product
[56:03] of the word of God because if God calls
[56:07] for a drought there's no food that's
[56:09] going to come out of the ground even the
[56:11] natural body will starve so everything
[56:14] started by the word of God everything
[56:16] it's the very word of God that even
[56:19] created the water that we drink it's the
[56:22] very word that produced the fruits that
[56:24] we eat the vegetables that we eat it's a
[56:26] very word that calls for it so man even
[56:29] it is natural he still dependent on the
[56:32] word of
[56:33] God but yet man is oblivious of all
[56:36] those things they think they have the
[56:38] strength and because they can play some
[56:40] grain in the ground but they they forget
[56:43] that they rely on the process that God
[56:45] has established there for them to
[56:47] receive the fruit you you take a sick
[56:50] person and you will go and you'll get
[56:52] operated on they will cut you open and
[56:54] they will do all those things and man
[56:56] the doctor will come and it will try to
[56:58] remove the cells that are not good and
[57:01] it will do that but the healing part of
[57:03] the body is still dependent on
[57:05] God oh my we I tell you we live so much
[57:09] by the word that we not even pay
[57:11] attention to it everything about us is
[57:13] the word of God we see because of the
[57:16] word of God we breathe because of the
[57:18] word of God everything even the very
[57:21] this man that's going to die he's still
[57:23] dependent on the things that God has
[57:31] produced he says Matthew 4 and4 it says
[57:35] and he answered and he said it's written
[57:37] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[57:40] every word that proceedeth out of the
[57:42] mouth of God butam takes that and he
[57:45] says the word is supposed to be in our
[57:52] mouths the word is supposed to be in our
[57:57] mouths in our mouths too he says now we
[58:00] know that the church is his body and
[58:04] then he says it is here taking his place
[58:07] if you can find it he says what will we
[58:11] be it says what we what we what will be
[58:14] in our mouth what will be in the mouth
[58:17] of the church he says the word what is
[58:20] it if the church is here to take the
[58:23] place of Christ and to take the place of
[58:25] Jesus the church is supposed to be
[58:27] speaking the word because Christ only
[58:30] spoke the word he knew nothing in fact
[58:33] the scripture says that he didn't write
[58:35] any books because he was the very
[58:37] manifestation of what the prophet wrote
[58:40] about that's why he didn't write any
[58:43] book so he was when he came on the scene
[58:46] all he was there to do is to know what
[58:49] is it that was written of me what is it
[58:52] that the prophet prophesy of me what is
[58:54] it it that I'm supposed to be in this
[58:56] time he was supposed the prophet said
[58:58] that it was supposed to be the Lamb of
[59:00] God he came in a manifestation of the
[59:03] Lamb the pro the word said that he would
[59:05] offer his life and and pay for the sins
[59:08] of the world and he did that and the
[59:10] same Prophet came and says now when he
[59:12] comes the words that he's speaking he
[59:14] spoke about his bride that will come in
[59:16] the end time so we too we don't care to
[59:20] write or to to write other books or
[59:22] whatever we are the manifestation of
[59:24] what the prophet talked about what is it
[59:26] it says this bride will be another will
[59:29] produce another book of act but this
[59:31] bride he says will not be the same as
[59:33] the eve before the difference is the eve
[59:36] before was a byproduct it was made so
[59:39] Satan can come in and deceive the whole
[59:41] creation but this eve the eve at the end
[59:44] time comes from Jesus Christ himself so
[59:47] as Jesus is the word this Eve is the
[59:50] word so she's here producing the same
[59:53] act the same action that Jesus Christ
[59:55] himself produced she's flesh of his
[59:58] flesh and bone of his bone no difference
[1:00:00] at all why because it's the word coming
[1:00:03] into manifestation the same Eve was
[1:00:05] created if I can say this for the
[1:00:07] purpose of falling but the eve at the
[1:00:09] end time brother says she cannot
[1:00:12] fail why because she's the word
[1:00:16] itself just as the bridegroom
[1:00:22] was he will say the scripture was speak
[1:00:26] in Peter 4 and11 it says if any man
[1:00:30] speak let him speak of the Oracle of God
[1:00:35] the word of
[1:00:37] God I and I want to just stop here for a
[1:00:39] moment and say we fell short because
[1:00:43] instead of speaking the word we speak
[1:00:45] our conditions and the things that are
[1:00:47] going on oh man I'm sick and I'm tired I
[1:00:51] can't get a job and you know we it's
[1:00:54] easy to complain we give in too much of
[1:00:58] what's not right and oh this is wrong
[1:01:01] and that's wrong and this is now if you
[1:01:03] go and you look at Jesus he never spoke
[1:01:06] any negative in fact the prophet will
[1:01:08] tell us he says don't ever have a
[1:01:11] negative thought he will
[1:01:13] say he was always positive in fact you
[1:01:16] would even take the profit of this hour
[1:01:18] things will be going sideways let me ask
[1:01:21] you this how do you take a gun you
[1:01:23] almost blow your eyesight away and find
[1:01:26] something positive out of
[1:01:31] that how do you lose your entire family
[1:01:35] your family your your your daughter you
[1:01:37] lose your wife and and yet you find
[1:01:39] something positive out of
[1:01:43] that how do you take negative things and
[1:01:47] and all kinds of things that you are
[1:01:48] subject to and all of that and find
[1:01:51] something the only thing that can do
[1:01:53] that is the word let me say that why
[1:01:55] because it was the word they there's no
[1:01:58] way anything could come out of him so
[1:02:01] whatever will the devil will throw at
[1:02:03] him he will find a way to turn it into
[1:02:05] positive whatever will come his way he
[1:02:07] will find a way to glorify God through
[1:02:11] it I was reading of Fanny Cosby
[1:02:15] Crosby and how I believe she was about
[1:02:18] six six days or six months I if I can't
[1:02:21] recall she was fine with the blindness
[1:02:25] that she couldn't see at that young
[1:02:28] age but I want let me just if I could
[1:02:30] find it just read what she said about
[1:02:34] her
[1:02:35] condition what she thought about her
[1:02:38] condition at I at at that age she was
[1:02:41] six weeks
[1:02:43] old and so she goes it says at 8 cros
[1:02:48] wrote her first palman which describe a
[1:02:52] condition she later stated
[1:02:55] it it seems intended by the Blessed
[1:02:59] Providence of God that I should be blind
[1:03:02] all my life and I thank him for the for
[1:03:06] the dispens the dispensation it says it
[1:03:10] says if perfect healthy sights were off
[1:03:14] were offered to me tomorrow I would not
[1:03:17] accept
[1:03:20] it I just want you to think about that
[1:03:22] for a moment
[1:03:25] he said she said if perfect sight was
[1:03:28] offered to me I would not take it I
[1:03:31] would not accept it it might not it says
[1:03:34] I might have not sung hymns to praise
[1:03:37] him to praise to praise to the praise of
[1:03:41] God if I had been distracted by the
[1:03:44] beautiful and interesting things about
[1:03:50] me it says she also once said when I get
[1:03:55] to heaven the first face that I shall
[1:03:58] ever glance by sight will be the one of
[1:04:02] my savior hallu oh I tell you I looked
[1:04:05] at it I said oh God help me you know we
[1:04:08] complain for a finger that hurt you know
[1:04:10] we complain we don't come to church
[1:04:12] because we woke up a little tired and
[1:04:14] because our back hurts and because of
[1:04:16] that but look at a person who was blind
[1:04:19] completely all their lives and they are
[1:04:21] saying this blindness is for me to
[1:04:23] glorify God this is whatever is
[1:04:26] happening with me is for me to glorify
[1:04:28] God why they came to an understanding
[1:04:31] that if that says God giveth and God
[1:04:34] takes away blessed be the name of the
[1:04:37] Jehovah they didn't care whatever
[1:04:39] situation was going what was on the mind
[1:04:42] is I'm here for the representation of
[1:04:44] the word of God and regardless of what's
[1:04:47] placed before me I shall do
[1:04:52] it that I will do it
[1:04:55] regardless but we find
[1:04:58] ourselves sometimes full of complaints
[1:05:03] and full of things that reasons why we
[1:05:07] cannot take the
[1:05:09] word full of reasons why we go this way
[1:05:13] and we go that way but yet the word is
[1:05:15] presented right before
[1:05:17] us but when I'm I like this and he talks
[1:05:21] about in the th seed shall possess the
[1:05:23] Gat of the enemy he said and all colored
[1:05:26] men down paragraph 45 if you can find it
[1:05:29] he said and all colored men down the
[1:05:31] South it says carry the Bible and they
[1:05:33] said why do you carry the Bible MOS it
[1:05:36] says you can't read he says I believe
[1:05:39] it it says well how do you know it's
[1:05:42] right it says well it's it's I believe I
[1:05:44] believe it from quiver to quiver it says
[1:05:47] uh it says also it's got It's got a Holy
[1:05:50] Bible written on
[1:05:52] it I like that it says it's got Holy
[1:05:55] Bible written in it and I believe it and
[1:05:58] he says I guess you believe all that's
[1:06:00] in there he says yes sir he says I guess
[1:06:03] you believe whatever God will tell you
[1:06:06] to do you will do it he says I'll do it
[1:06:10] he said so if he'll tell you to jump up
[1:06:14] through the wall through that wall that
[1:06:17] stone wall you are going to get to get
[1:06:19] through it then he said if he will tell
[1:06:23] me to jump
[1:06:24] I'll jump he'll make a hole when I get
[1:06:29] there that's a Believer right there if
[1:06:33] he tells me to jump and there's no hole
[1:06:35] on the other side I'll jump anyway
[1:06:38] because if he tells me to jump he's able
[1:06:41] to make a hole when I get
[1:06:45] there that's the word of God that's how
[1:06:48] it's given to us it's not given for us
[1:06:50] to make our own interpretation I don't
[1:06:53] know what's going to happen happen all I
[1:06:54] know is if I believe his word what he
[1:06:57] said will happen it will happen if he
[1:07:00] says when I jump I'm going to be holy if
[1:07:03] he says when I jump I'm going to receive
[1:07:05] what I need I will jump when I get to
[1:07:07] the other side it's no longer my doing
[1:07:10] it's going to be he's
[1:07:14] doing and often time God tells us to
[1:07:17] jump oh we start to think well what if I
[1:07:20] jump and it doesn't happen What do we do
[1:07:22] next right
[1:07:25] we're not supposed to do that with the
[1:07:27] word it it's God has given it to us for
[1:07:31] overcoming power it's given us let me
[1:07:34] say this the word is what's been given
[1:07:37] to us to give us access to what it means
[1:07:41] to be
[1:07:42] God it's the only thing that's given so
[1:07:45] we can get access to the divine nature
[1:07:48] of God so we no longer act or translate
[1:07:52] things like morals that we are moved
[1:07:54] from Mortals into Immortal Immortal
[1:07:57] being so when we act according to to the
[1:08:00] word we are acting as
[1:08:04] gods and we will we will receive the
[1:08:07] results of
[1:08:15] God and he says so that's right so
[1:08:19] that's the thing you do you have to do
[1:08:22] if and it says it it it is take God and
[1:08:25] believe it jump anywhere brother bam
[1:08:27] says if you it says if you know if you
[1:08:30] listen to this if you know you can
[1:08:32] explain it understand it then you
[1:08:35] wouldn't have faith you would it
[1:08:37] wouldn't be Faith No
[1:08:39] More your faith is what you believe that
[1:08:44] he has done for you your faith is what
[1:08:47] you believe that he has done for you and
[1:08:50] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:08:52] for the evidence of of Things Not Seen
[1:08:55] It says don't don't don't see it he says
[1:08:58] you don't figure it out there's no way
[1:09:01] you can figure out God you just go and
[1:09:03] believe him keep walking on he said keep
[1:09:07] walking he said so that's how I stand on
[1:09:10] the pulpit for uh on the pulpit for
[1:09:13] these Visions he says he tells me to go
[1:09:15] do a certain things that seem humanly
[1:09:18] impossible and you all know that it's
[1:09:21] humanly impossible but he said to do
[1:09:24] just go on and it says he's the one that
[1:09:28] takes care of it and he will do it yes
[1:09:31] how great thou
[1:09:35] are is the one who's going to bring it
[1:09:37] to
[1:09:39] pass our part of it is to believe the
[1:09:42] word and to walk in it our part of it is
[1:09:45] to take the word and this part of God
[1:09:49] that allows us so that he says the works
[1:09:52] that I do shall ye do also so how you
[1:09:54] going to do it is part by partaking of
[1:09:57] his word that the works that I do that
[1:10:00] he did we can also do why because the
[1:10:03] word has the power to transform Us in
[1:10:06] the message believer thou this it says
[1:10:08] now you don't go to hell because you are
[1:10:11] a sinner paragraph 13 it says because
[1:10:14] you are a sinner you go to hell because
[1:10:16] you re you refuse to accept the
[1:10:19] way the way away from hell there's a
[1:10:24] bypass that's Christ there's a bypass
[1:10:27] for your
[1:10:28] sickness it says quick death and
[1:10:31] premature grave it says that's through
[1:10:34] Christ but now you you sinner in the
[1:10:38] beginning and Christ died for your sins
[1:10:41] therefore he he saved you when he died
[1:10:44] for you he saved you he healed you when
[1:10:47] he died he took your place but now all
[1:10:50] you have to do is accept it by faith
[1:10:54] faith and you will receive it and he
[1:10:57] says what I mean he says now there's
[1:11:00] nothing more to be done because his
[1:11:03] healing his your healing is already paid
[1:11:06] for he can have it right you can have it
[1:11:10] right this afternoon he says you can
[1:11:12] have it right now this very minute when
[1:11:15] you believe it when it says when your
[1:11:18] faith meets God's requirement
[1:11:22] amen when your faith meets God's
[1:11:25] requirement to believe that Christ died
[1:11:28] for your sickness when he died for your
[1:11:31] sin he died for your sin sins and
[1:11:33] Calvary and accept it upon on that base
[1:11:37] at that moment you are healed in the
[1:11:39] sight of God then you go on testifying
[1:11:43] of it believing it he says you testify
[1:11:46] of the things that you do not
[1:11:50] see of the things that you do not see
[1:11:53] see so when we come here we hear the
[1:11:56] word of God don't be afraid to go out
[1:11:58] there and said I'm already raptured I'm
[1:12:01] already well I'm already gotten it what
[1:12:04] I need I've already gotten Deliverance
[1:12:06] I've already gotten why because you're
[1:12:08] not testifying your yourself you're
[1:12:10] testifying of what you heard God say and
[1:12:13] if you testify of what he said he's
[1:12:16] responsible to come to bring it to pass
[1:12:18] the trouble we run into is we want to
[1:12:20] see it with our sight before we can
[1:12:22] testify of it
[1:12:25] right we want to touch it feel it before
[1:12:28] we say no he wants us to testify it
[1:12:32] because we have received it from his
[1:12:38] word he
[1:12:40] says believeth Thou
[1:12:43] death paragraph 67 he says
[1:12:47] faith
[1:12:49] is an individual sense Bas B is it says
[1:12:53] is an individual senses beside uh
[1:12:57] besides any there the six
[1:13:00] sense the outside man that God put in in
[1:13:05] human
[1:13:06] flesh here he says give him five senses
[1:13:10] to contact the
[1:13:12] Earth and an inside
[1:13:15] man the spirit has two
[1:13:18] senses and a unbeliever and faith and
[1:13:22] when your faith says that you are going
[1:13:25] to be healed as same as your sight it
[1:13:29] says as same as your sights that man has
[1:13:32] a red tie and a brown suit it's it's
[1:13:36] over for faith is the substance of
[1:13:38] things hope for the evidence of Things
[1:13:40] Not Seen he says taste fill smell and
[1:13:44] hear it says there you are you believe
[1:13:47] it you can't accept it now until you do
[1:13:51] believe it it says you've got to believe
[1:13:54] it before it will
[1:13:57] act you got to believe it before you
[1:14:00] would act you see what I mean friends
[1:14:04] people stand on the platform and say
[1:14:06] well why don't why don't you say why
[1:14:08] don't you why don't you why don't
[1:14:11] something happen he says it can't happen
[1:14:14] until you first believe it and confess
[1:14:17] it right he says take a woman come to
[1:14:20] the altar here or a man he says let them
[1:14:24] be ever a vile or or they could scream
[1:14:27] and cry and walk down the alleen The
[1:14:30] Altar and say God forgive me it says
[1:14:33] forgive me forgive me say it in and say
[1:14:36] it in and out and day in and day out it
[1:14:39] says they say they keep pacing Lord I've
[1:14:42] repented I've done I've done everything
[1:14:44] I could and they keep pacing until the
[1:14:47] hour he said when their hearts now
[1:14:50] listen to this when when in their hearts
[1:14:53] they believe it they believe it and then
[1:14:56] confess it when they confess it it goes
[1:15:00] to work right on it goes to work on it
[1:15:03] he cannot intercede for you until first
[1:15:07] you confess it and it's that it's that
[1:15:10] it's already done by faith it says he's
[1:15:13] the high priest of your confession amen
[1:15:16] he says H it says I feel pretty good I'm
[1:15:20] getting late I got it says I got to let
[1:15:22] it go home so yeah years and the prophet
[1:15:25] is trying to show
[1:15:27] us the the that it's when the word when
[1:15:30] you can find it in the word when you can
[1:15:33] find it and believe it within your heart
[1:15:36] and confess it with everything that's in
[1:15:38] you it says when you do that then you
[1:15:41] allow for God to come on the scene and
[1:15:44] manifest his word into your life God is
[1:15:47] here and let me say this we have to to
[1:15:50] remember H H that we are here God didn't
[1:15:53] Place us here because the enti message
[1:15:56] brother bam says one of the things he
[1:15:58] supposed to do it says is to bring us
[1:16:00] right back to the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:16:03] to the Faith of Our Pentecostal fathers
[1:16:06] and then it says the others was to
[1:16:07] restore the mystery truth but when you
[1:16:10] talk about the Faith of Our Fathers what
[1:16:12] were they they were a people that had
[1:16:15] received the promise they received a
[1:16:17] promise and they acted based on what the
[1:16:19] promise was they went into the upper
[1:16:22] room because the word told them to go in
[1:16:23] the upper room and they waited there
[1:16:26] until they were endured with a promise
[1:16:29] that was given to them to tell them to
[1:16:31] wait in the upper room they receive the
[1:16:33] Holy Ghost by obedience to the word that
[1:16:36] was given to them and let me say this
[1:16:38] and the word at the end time is not
[1:16:40] different from that because if we stay
[1:16:43] in obedience to what he promised he will
[1:16:45] do God will bring forth the
[1:16:47] manifestations of sons in the end times
[1:16:50] but why it has to be in obedience to the
[1:16:53] word that God promis will come to
[1:17:00] pass he will
[1:17:03] say and un likee
[1:17:05] this and I'll just read part of it so I
[1:17:08] can for the second of time he
[1:17:12] says now remember we are not in the
[1:17:14] picnic we are in the
[1:17:16] battlefield many people just think that
[1:17:18] they can come when they become a
[1:17:21] Christian that they that that all they
[1:17:24] have to that's all they have to do it
[1:17:27] says that that settles it forever and
[1:17:30] they are Christians and everything is
[1:17:32] going to go easy he says don't never get
[1:17:35] that into your
[1:17:38] head that's not the goal the goal is not
[1:17:42] well I'm a Christian then if therefore
[1:17:45] everything is supposed to go easy no you
[1:17:48] I'm a Christian now I have the right to
[1:17:52] claim everything that God has promised
[1:17:55] about
[1:17:56] me now I have the right in fact I have
[1:17:59] the weapon that I can use to go in
[1:18:01] battle with right I'm a Christian it
[1:18:05] means I am now being empowered I have
[1:18:08] been given the Holy Spirit I have been
[1:18:11] given the word of God for me to go to
[1:18:13] battle with and the battle is what is
[1:18:16] that I don't want to be one to live by
[1:18:19] by what the devil is offering out there
[1:18:21] he's got a kingdom and he's got people
[1:18:23] in his kingdom he wants the Christian he
[1:18:26] wants us to live by the things which he
[1:18:28] has provided he doesn't want us to live
[1:18:31] by every word of God so when we become a
[1:18:33] Christian our heart's desire is I am
[1:18:36] here to live by the word of God and I
[1:18:39] don't want to live by the provisions of
[1:18:41] Satan I'm here to live by every word
[1:18:43] that was
[1:18:48] spoken so he
[1:18:51] said
[1:18:53] don't he says don't ever get that into
[1:18:55] your head for I become a Christian to
[1:18:58] fight to fight the good fight of faith I
[1:19:01] become a Christian to get in the battle
[1:19:03] line we says we are Christian Soldiers
[1:19:06] and we got to be trained and brought up
[1:19:09] and know the all the techniques of the
[1:19:11] enemy and to know how to
[1:19:14] Forfeit how to fortify it says out to
[1:19:17] fortify to fight to to fight a fight and
[1:19:21] then he says we can only do so as the
[1:19:24] holy spirit will reveal it to us we
[1:19:27] cannot take some other nations what
[1:19:30] other Nation tells us when we go to war
[1:19:33] some other the ideas but we got to take
[1:19:36] our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit
[1:19:39] Will direct us Oh I thought that was so
[1:19:43] in line with what we heard this morning
[1:19:45] the holy spirit is here to constantly
[1:19:48] reveal his word before us so we can take
[1:19:51] what the holy spirit is is leading us
[1:19:54] into the holy spirit that wrote the word
[1:19:57] is here to interpret the word so what
[1:19:59] the Holy Spirit Will Will direct us and
[1:20:02] what it says and what idea he would give
[1:20:05] us because he is the Commander in and
[1:20:08] chief of the army of the Christians so I
[1:20:11] want to say this it's here we are here
[1:20:14] so we can fight for the promises that
[1:20:16] were made of us for so that the word
[1:20:19] that was written of us we can eat of
[1:20:21] that word and become that
[1:20:25] word so we can receive of that word and
[1:20:29] become the manifestation of that word
[1:20:31] that was written of
[1:20:34] us he will
[1:20:36] say the prophet will
[1:20:39] say oh
[1:20:41] my notice a great storm begin to take
[1:20:51] place doubt be begin to come
[1:20:55] in frustration begin to come
[1:20:59] in it says that's what happened
[1:21:03] see hybrids hybrids back again you know
[1:21:08] what a genuine original plant you don't
[1:21:12] have to spray
[1:21:14] it no
[1:21:16] sir bugs won't even get to
[1:21:20] it it says
[1:21:23] and it's that hot house
[1:21:26] plant that you would have to
[1:21:29] spray that's what's the matter we have
[1:21:32] to spray and to baby and pet around the
[1:21:36] so-called
[1:21:39] Christian I we we just talked a little
[1:21:42] bit about fny Crosby and we we don't
[1:21:47] want to be the type of Christian that
[1:21:49] has to be baby all the time because the
[1:21:53] end time word was supposed to bring us
[1:21:56] back into the
[1:21:58] original mind of what God intended for a
[1:22:02] Christian to be and I and we can look at
[1:22:05] throughout history and see in every age
[1:22:09] what characteristics those Christian put
[1:22:12] on
[1:22:13] display if you read Hebrews 11 it will
[1:22:16] tell you about how some were son as Su
[1:22:20] how they were destitute and they were
[1:22:22] given all kinds of things they were
[1:22:24] killed and there were all kinds of cruel
[1:22:27] things done to them but they stood the
[1:22:29] test of faith why because they had
[1:22:32] something in them that was greater than
[1:22:34] what was presented to them in fact the
[1:22:36] scripture says that that they they were
[1:22:40] glad to die because they knew they would
[1:22:43] receive a better Resurrection they were
[1:22:45] happy to give the lives they were happy
[1:22:48] to lay down their lives because they
[1:22:50] knew that what was to come was greater
[1:22:52] than what they had done oh but then it
[1:22:56] comes to the end time it's no different
[1:22:58] than this time Satan is trying to put us
[1:23:00] to sleep and he's trying to cause us to
[1:23:03] live by the provisions that he has and
[1:23:05] all kinds of things that he has out
[1:23:07] there but the word of God is yet to say
[1:23:09] don't be sprayed
[1:23:12] over let's be Christian Soldiers let's
[1:23:15] be those that are dedicated to the word
[1:23:17] of God let's be those that are looking
[1:23:19] for the manifestation of the things that
[1:23:21] God promised let's be those that are
[1:23:24] continually press on it doesn't matter
[1:23:26] what condition we are in what matter is
[1:23:29] the One Promise is here to bring us to
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:34] destination but yet the enemy is here to
[1:23:37] spray and to cause to fall asleep and to
[1:23:41] be in a place where if things don't come
[1:23:44] easy then it's a problem if things are
[1:23:47] not given up fast enough then it's a
[1:23:50] problem but God is here to make us
[1:23:52] Christian soldiers like just like those
[1:23:54] that's gone before us he's here to train
[1:23:57] us so we know how to fight like our
[1:24:00] Pastor said this morning something
[1:24:01] happened you don't you don't fall apart
[1:24:04] and continue to scream out no you stand
[1:24:06] and you begin to pray to take your
[1:24:08] possession and know I'm a Son of God I'm
[1:24:12] God's extended hand and if Jesus was
[1:24:14] here what would he do he would pray to
[1:24:16] the father so the situation can change I
[1:24:19] know that Jesus is is here but he's in
[1:24:22] the of the Holy Spirit living in me so
[1:24:24] the same thing that he did I have the
[1:24:26] right to do so therefore I'll praise for
[1:24:28] the situation to change why because it's
[1:24:31] the manifestation of the same word that
[1:24:34] was in Jesus is in you producing the
[1:24:37] same
[1:24:39] thing oh he will
[1:24:42] say he will say what is a hybrid it's a
[1:24:46] hot it's a hot it's a hot bed he said
[1:24:50] plant if it isn't if if it is an
[1:24:53] original plant you have to keep spraying
[1:24:55] it all the
[1:24:58] time and I want to say this I don't want
[1:25:00] to be that
[1:25:01] way I don't want to be sprayed over
[1:25:04] every
[1:25:06] time he says to keep the bugs off of it
[1:25:11] the bugs will eat it but if it's
[1:25:13] original print you don't have to spray
[1:25:16] it a good healthy plant the bug won't
[1:25:19] crawl on it it says the that's what the
[1:25:23] matter that's what the matter we have to
[1:25:25] keep babying people in the church glory
[1:25:28] to God sister he said glory to God
[1:25:31] sister said you are hybrid you are
[1:25:34] brought you are brought in in by some
[1:25:37] other way he says you take the hybrid
[1:25:40] corn and and and plant it back and then
[1:25:43] it says what do you got nothing it won't
[1:25:45] even make nothing it says the church is
[1:25:50] is pretty today it's it's true bigger
[1:25:53] buildings than you ever had the greatest
[1:25:56] congreg the uh greatest congregations
[1:25:59] you ever uh uh uh preached to it says
[1:26:02] the better intellectual ministers
[1:26:05] ministers that you ever you ever have it
[1:26:07] says you used to have men out of the
[1:26:10] cornfield somewhere that God called out
[1:26:13] um called out there the broom Sage patch
[1:26:17] he says but now you've seen your
[1:26:20] children to you've sent your children to
[1:26:22] school and you've made you've made
[1:26:24] grandchildren out of them and come back
[1:26:27] with all the PHD and lldd even one of
[1:26:30] the greatest Pentecostal churches today
[1:26:32] before they seen they send a man to the
[1:26:35] mission field they had to stand before a
[1:26:37] psychiatrist to see if he's mentally in
[1:26:41] elected
[1:26:43] enough it says think of
[1:26:46] it the church
[1:26:51] condition
[1:26:54] but Jude is
[1:26:56] saying all that we must remember to
[1:26:59] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:27:02] once delivered right Jude will tell us
[1:27:05] that we have to fight you have to
[1:27:08] contend for a faith an original Faith a
[1:27:13] faith that's not dependent on the things
[1:27:15] around you a faith that depends on who
[1:27:18] gave you the word a faith that's
[1:27:21] dependent on where did you get what you
[1:27:23] were standing on a faith that's
[1:27:25] dependent on knowing that whatever God
[1:27:28] did yesterday he will do it today and
[1:27:30] you will do it tomorrow a faith to know
[1:27:33] that it doesn't matter if I'm in trouble
[1:27:36] if things are okay or not okay what
[1:27:38] matters is I have received the word of
[1:27:40] God and nothing will change a faith that
[1:27:43] stands in the midst of trouble a faith
[1:27:46] that will stand regardless of what I'm
[1:27:47] looking at and that faith can only come
[1:27:51] by the word of God
[1:27:56] God he will
[1:28:01] say it's by it the elders obtain a good
[1:28:08] report oh
[1:28:10] my that if we were to receive anything
[1:28:13] good it would come by
[1:28:16] faith but when I'm going say that faith
[1:28:18] is the
[1:28:19] key faith is the very key key that gives
[1:28:22] us access to the promises of God faith
[1:28:26] is the key that opens the Mysteries and
[1:28:28] the the things that God has for us
[1:28:31] without faith we cannot please God it's
[1:28:35] like if you didn't have confidence in
[1:28:37] someone you couldn't come and ask them
[1:28:39] what you had need of and even if they
[1:28:41] told you they were going to give you you
[1:28:43] wouldn't go rejoicing knowing they gave
[1:28:45] you
[1:28:47] right you would be wondering is it
[1:28:49] really going to do it is it really going
[1:28:51] to give me is he really going to say
[1:28:53] what he do what he promised he will do
[1:28:55] but when you have faith in someone you
[1:28:58] know that they will stand for what they
[1:29:00] promise they will do you know that when
[1:29:02] they give you their word regardless of
[1:29:04] what happened they will stand by the
[1:29:06] word they have given you so therefore
[1:29:08] when we come to God the scripture will
[1:29:10] say that we must
[1:29:13] believe that the things which he promise
[1:29:16] he will come to pass if the musician
[1:29:18] could
[1:29:20] come
[1:29:23] but
[1:29:26] say and when the inspiration of the holy
[1:29:29] spirit this is in the message who is God
[1:29:33] when the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:29:35] is here to inspire you remember God will
[1:29:38] make your body come into your
[1:29:41] confession it says if you say you are
[1:29:45] drunken and you want to drink don't
[1:29:48] worry you'll soon be
[1:29:50] one if you say you are a sinner and you
[1:29:54] want to sin you will be it says you'll
[1:29:57] be right on it if you say you are a
[1:30:00] Christian and you believe and you
[1:30:02] believe it all along God will bring it
[1:30:06] your testimony will bring your will
[1:30:09] bring you right into it if you believe
[1:30:12] in healing and believe that God has
[1:30:15] healed you confess it God will make your
[1:30:18] body obey your confession for he is the
[1:30:21] the high priest of your confession
[1:30:24] sitting on the right hand of the father
[1:30:26] now it says with his own blood and
[1:30:29] making intercession for any for any con
[1:30:33] confessions upon anything that he died
[1:30:36] for what is he saying if we if we ever
[1:30:39] want to receive anything from God we
[1:30:42] have to have faith in what he promised
[1:30:44] he will make of us and if we have faith
[1:30:47] in what he promised he will make us and
[1:30:49] and let me say this I didn't read it he
[1:30:51] says one place he says oh that if we
[1:30:54] will come it says to believe is the very
[1:30:59] substance to believe is the very
[1:31:01] substance uh if I can find it I believe
[1:31:04] it's in the Fist of the trumpet he
[1:31:06] speaks it says to believe is the very
[1:31:08] substance of what we're going to receive
[1:31:10] so when we come I got it here it says
[1:31:14] and Jesus says paragraph 100 it says and
[1:31:17] Jesus says As He was in the days of lot
[1:31:20] so he will be in the coming of the son
[1:31:22] uh of the son in the end in the end of
[1:31:25] the world the son of man he says not the
[1:31:27] Son of God uh with the it says when the
[1:31:31] son of man will be
[1:31:33] revealing it says had he he said hadn't
[1:31:38] had it Through the Ages see that perfect
[1:31:43] continuing continuing continuity of the
[1:31:46] scripture here we are living it he says
[1:31:50] the mystery even of the baptism of uh in
[1:31:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ away
[1:31:56] from the West idea it says these are
[1:31:59] things and how the Holy Ghost has moved
[1:32:02] that in the that that in the that in and
[1:32:07] show is show it perfectly and that the
[1:32:10] true baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:32:12] token and everything and placed it and
[1:32:15] how he placed every reformers and
[1:32:18] everything just exactly see right before
[1:32:21] our eyes it say our own eyes and then it
[1:32:23] says and it's not in the corner it's no
[1:32:28] it's World known Jesus the son of God
[1:32:32] Jesus the son of God revealing himself
[1:32:34] by the scripture making the scripture
[1:32:38] that he has been that has been
[1:32:40] predestinated to this day like it was in
[1:32:43] that day and all the others live it says
[1:32:48] and to believe it is the substance of
[1:32:51] the is the evidence of the Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit to to how did you get here it's
[1:33:00] the Holy Spirit moving you what will say
[1:33:04] he's brooding over you he's brooding
[1:33:06] constantly over you bringing you from
[1:33:08] where you were in sin bringing you what
[1:33:10] in a manifestation of the promise of the
[1:33:13] word in the end time why he bringing you
[1:33:15] why because he has something that he's
[1:33:17] trying to do with the church at the end
[1:33:19] time to believe the very word that he
[1:33:22] promised will bring about the substance
[1:33:24] of what he promised will come to
[1:33:28] pass but we
[1:33:30] cannot receive it if we keep doubting it
[1:33:35] or if we keep saying well I believe it
[1:33:37] but I don't know if I can really obtain
[1:33:39] it I I I know it's true but how do I get
[1:33:44] access to
[1:33:46] it he's here to give you access to it
[1:33:49] the person of his word is is here making
[1:33:52] his word known unto us let's all
[1:34:09] stand it
[1:34:14] says in the message show us the
[1:34:20] father
[1:34:23] the prophet
[1:34:24] said the thing to
[1:34:28] do is to know that you are coming to
[1:34:31] fulfill a
[1:34:32] promise that God Made
[1:34:36] You paragraph 71 not your own promise
[1:34:40] the promise that God Made
[1:34:43] You it says there's going to be thousand
[1:34:45] of
[1:34:48] people praying for you and when you come
[1:34:52] by the line it said by this line and
[1:34:55] when we pray lay hands on you and just
[1:34:59] as soon as the hands are laid upon you
[1:35:02] it
[1:35:04] says you just like to R to rise them to
[1:35:07] ra like raising them up out of the out
[1:35:11] of the water of being baptized you have
[1:35:15] done something that God gives you a
[1:35:20] promise what will
[1:35:22] happen he that
[1:35:25] believeth in his baptism shall be
[1:35:30] saved it
[1:35:32] says you go right out of this building
[1:35:35] testifying that you are
[1:35:38] saved what if you go out of the building
[1:35:41] saying well I don't
[1:35:44] know it says then you are not saved but
[1:35:48] God will make your body obey your
[1:35:53] confession is the high priest of all
[1:35:57] confession before you can be healed you
[1:36:01] have to confess it first before you can
[1:36:05] be saved you have to confess that you
[1:36:08] could be saved you are saved before you
[1:36:11] can obtain anything before we can go
[1:36:14] into rapture we have to believe that we
[1:36:16] are Rapture Ready why because the word
[1:36:18] is here to take you and to make you fit
[1:36:22] what God wants you to be the word is
[1:36:24] here to mold us and to bring us into it
[1:36:27] he says you have to believe that you are
[1:36:30] healed then when you believe you are
[1:36:32] healed God will make your body obey your
[1:36:36] confession so now when we come here we
[1:36:39] come by here it says let it be settled
[1:36:42] God this is your word it says this is
[1:36:45] your commandment I believe I'm Healed
[1:36:47] walk it off it says walk off the
[1:36:50] platform
[1:36:52] saying you believe that God is giving
[1:36:55] you what you have need of it's not by
[1:36:57] strength it's not by might it's not by
[1:37:00] what we can do but it's by the promise
[1:37:03] if we can only believe the infallibility
[1:37:06] of his word if we can stand of it on it
[1:37:10] every time it will produce the same
[1:37:12] result every time let's just bow our

[1:47:09] Father we so thankful to you Lord to to
[1:47:13] have heard from you tonight Lord
[1:47:16] Jesus just a reiteration Lord to just
[1:47:20] remind us once more father outside of
[1:47:23] your word what are we lord
[1:47:24] Jesus father the only reason that we are
[1:47:27] here now is because something was spoken
[1:47:29] over us thousands and thousands of years
[1:47:31] ago before the foundation of the world
[1:47:33] father you ordained all of this Lord
[1:47:35] Jesus father you don't speak your word
[1:47:37] and it go out vain Lord but when you
[1:47:39] speak your word there's a power that
[1:47:41] comes behind to bring forth the
[1:47:42] manifestation father I trust father the
[1:47:45] word that was spoken tonight and this
[1:47:46] morning Father spoken over us Lord
[1:47:49] Heavenly Father we just just want to
[1:47:50] surrender to that word that was given
[1:47:52] father and believe Lord no matter what
[1:47:54] we see like we've been told no matter
[1:47:56] what the condition is Father just trust
[1:47:58] to know that it's your promise your duty
[1:48:00] bound to bring your promise to pass
[1:48:02] father father you said in your word that
[1:48:05] us at times when we say things and
[1:48:07] doesn't go our way that we might say oh
[1:48:09] they don't believe it but your Prophet
[1:48:11] said that's not the character that you
[1:48:12] have Lord Jesus your Prophet said that
[1:48:14] when you say something you try to do a
[1:48:16] lot of different things to make us
[1:48:18] believe Lord so we could see it Lord
[1:48:20] because you don't want your word to go
[1:48:22] forth
[1:48:23] without manifesting what it was meant to
[1:48:25] manifest Lord Jesus we're so thankful
[1:48:27] for that Lord father I pray that you
[1:48:29] bless us Lord as we depart from this
[1:48:31] place Lord be with each and every single
[1:48:33] individual Lord Jesus Christ that we go
[1:48:35] forth Lord speaking your word on our
[1:48:37] lips Lord Jesus speaking positivity
[1:48:40] removing negative thoughts Lord Jesus if
[1:48:42] we could just keep our eyes stayed on
[1:48:43] you Lord Jesus we would see something
[1:48:45] happen in our lives Lord father bless
