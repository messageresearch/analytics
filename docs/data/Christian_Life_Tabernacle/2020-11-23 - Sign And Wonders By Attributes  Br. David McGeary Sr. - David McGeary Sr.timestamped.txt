[30:33] right at the beginning of uh november
[30:36] you know
[30:37] when the church closed down and we had a

[30:52] getting all the
[30:53] all the symptoms of it my chest was all

[31:00] and i had the fever and i lost my sense
[31:03] of taste i lost my
[31:04] uh my appetite i couldn't i couldn't eat
[31:08] as much
[31:10] so i was just you know taking my time
[31:12] away from work
[31:13] you know trying to stay away from as
[31:15] many people as i could
[31:17] uh but when i went and got that test for
[31:19] the first time and i told my sister
[31:22] she uh she called the whole family and
[31:24] they had this uh
[31:25] you know you know family they're the
[31:28] kind
[31:28] i mean they're the kind of people that
[31:30] you know you just love them
[31:32] but sometimes when they get bad news you
[31:34] know
[31:35] it's just it's never good so
[31:40] so i after she tells everybody
[31:45] about what i got and what we're going to
[31:48] do next
[31:49] they wanted me to live with my parents
[31:51] so i went to go
[31:52] i went to go live with my parents i went
[31:55] there the first night
[31:56] my parents were you know just like any
[31:59] other parent they want to take care of
[32:00] their k
[32:01] of their kid when they're sick so
[32:02] they're going to do everything that they
[32:04] can they
[32:04] give you all kind of medication and they
[32:06] become
[32:07] the expert of covid that that night you
[32:10] know they
[32:11] they know all the you know all the
[32:13] symptoms and everything that you need to
[32:14] take and
[32:15] and you know they just prescribed me
[32:17] some hydrotherapy
[32:19] they uh prescribed me uh they prescribed
[32:23] me
[32:24] other medicines that we used to take
[32:26] back in africa
[32:28] they call it penicillin or something
[32:30] like that and
[32:31] kimin i don't know if some of you know
[32:33] what that is
[32:35] but we used to take some of those
[32:37] medications and
[32:39] so they were like yeah you guys you guys
[32:40] used to take this when you were young
[32:42] so this is really going to help you now
[32:44] when when you're old and you got covered
[32:46] and stuff and so
[32:48] um they they
[32:51] they gave me medication i was i was
[32:53] pretty sick and so
[32:54] everything they were saying i was just
[32:56] like okay i'll take it they they came
[32:58] they gave me tea
[32:59] i was like i'll take it they gave me all
[33:01] kinds of there's like a list of like
[33:04] 17 different things that i had to take
[33:06] and i was like you know
[33:07] their parents and you know that what
[33:09] they say i just i'll just do it for the
[33:11] time being
[33:12] because i'm sick and you know i'm
[33:14] feeling pretty bad right now so
[33:16] i'll take everything that they give me
[33:18] but there was another thing that they
[33:20] said
[33:21] that really didn't stick well with me
[33:23] and it was that
[33:25] i don't know if some of you are here
[33:26] when i give my testimony about
[33:28] uh being a branimist and switching over
[33:31] to being a
[33:32] believer of the word and believing in
[33:34] jesus christ as being my savior
[33:36] i don't know if some of you were here
[33:38] but uh
[33:40] so immediately my parents saw
[33:43] that and uh you know my dad took that
[33:46] opportunity and said you know what you
[33:47] see
[33:49] it's because you switched from uh being
[33:51] uh
[33:53] you know believing in brandon was god
[33:54] and see now he's punishing you and
[33:57] and now you got covered you see and
[34:00] and you know i i didn't that didn't sit
[34:02] very well with me
[34:04] even though i took all the medication
[34:06] that's the only part that i just
[34:08] i didn't agree with him on that um i
[34:11] kept believing the way i believe because
[34:12] i know
[34:13] where i was and who saved me from where
[34:16] i was and so
[34:17] i believe in in my in my god and so uh
[34:22] uh so the first night uh i wasn't able
[34:25] to
[34:25] i wasn't able to say you know to
[34:27] anything and so uh this
[34:28] the i took everything that they provided
[34:31] for me
[34:32] and the next day i um
[34:35] they took me to a doctor doctor was
[34:37] looking at me and you know they're
[34:38] they're saying well you're you're pretty
[34:40] sick and you know you
[34:42] you got covered you got it pretty well
[34:44] and um
[34:47] so i uh you know i was like okay well
[34:51] that if that's the case then that's the
[34:53] case i don't know what you want me to do
[34:55] uh and the doctor prescribed me a bunch
[34:58] a bunch more you know other things that
[35:00] i needed to take
[35:02] uh and you know they told me to go to
[35:05] cvs and get this and
[35:07] as i was driving up to cvs i could just
[35:10] feel
[35:10] some kind of a con condemnation i would
[35:14] say
[35:14] uh some kind of like like you shouldn't
[35:16] really be
[35:18] you know you're doing all this taking
[35:20] all this medication and all this but you
[35:22] but you know there's a hillary like what
[35:25] what are you
[35:25] what are you doing you know i was
[35:28] feeling like i'm missing out
[35:30] on on true healing instead of
[35:33] you know i'm missing out on true healing
[35:35] and so
[35:37] i um
[35:40] so i i went to cvs
[35:44] i get to the store instead of walking in
[35:48] i just stood there for a while
[35:51] i just kept thinking and then i stopped
[35:53] i went
[35:54] to uh to a little park that i usually go
[35:56] to where i just read my bible
[35:59] and i pray i usually go there and just
[36:01] sit there and just pray and read my
[36:02] bible
[36:03] because i feel i'm closer to god when
[36:05] i'm just seeing the trees and the
[36:07] rivers moving and everything and so
[36:10] i just went there and prayed and just
[36:12] kept reading my bible and just
[36:14] verse after verse you know when god is
[36:16] speaking to you there's verses that are
[36:18] coming in
[36:18] and they're like exactly pointing to
[36:21] your situation right there and so
[36:23] i'm reading that and just telling me
[36:25] about uh he's the guy that heals all
[36:27] diseases
[36:27] he healed me since the foundation of the
[36:29] world and
[36:31] you know a bunch of other verses that
[36:33] are that are going along with healing
[36:35] so i saw that and i took the word and
[36:37] said well
[36:39] he said he's ill he's healed me you know
[36:41] i i don't i don't think i have to take
[36:43] all the
[36:43] all those other medications so i went
[36:45] home waited there in the afternoon
[36:48] i got really hungry so i decided to
[36:50] force myself even though i didn't have
[36:51] the appetite to eat
[36:53] i decided to force myself to go out and
[36:56] buy something to eat so i went to one of
[36:57] my favorite restaurants
[37:00] and you know they were somehow they
[37:02] happened to have closed at that time
[37:04] so i i drove over the wing stop and i
[37:07] get inside a wing stop
[37:09] and uh and there's a guy
[37:12] he's he's standing at the cashier and
[37:15] he's got no mask on
[37:17] and everybody in the restaurant's got a
[37:18] mask on i was like well this is
[37:20] this has got to be pretty good you know
[37:23] 2020
[37:24] everybody's forced to have a mask this
[37:25] guy's just standing here about 21 years
[37:28] old you know and
[37:29] blonde guy with like a sweater on and
[37:32] and some jeans just you know ordering
[37:35] his food
[37:36] i looked at that i'm like okay well i
[37:38] mean i don't
[37:39] i don't have anything against that um i
[37:42] got my mask on and i'm fine i mean
[37:45] if they're telling him to get out i
[37:46] guess he's got to get out
[37:48] there's nothing i can do about that so i
[37:50] i stand in the line
[37:51] nobody's telling him anything i don't
[37:53] even know if they're noticing how
[37:55] he doesn't have a mask on so he orders
[37:58] his food he comes back and he's walking
[38:00] towards the window
[38:01] and just you know talking i don't know
[38:03] what he's doing and then uh
[38:05] he walks pretty close and i know that i
[38:07] have covert and i have a mask on
[38:10] so i so i turn to him and say
[38:13] aren't you scared of colvin he said he's
[38:16] not a
[38:17] greater z greater is he this in me than
[38:20] he is in the world
[38:21] and so i i was like wow that's
[38:25] that's crazy i mean this guy i don't
[38:28] know who he is i've never seen him at
[38:30] any of our churches or congregation i
[38:32] don't know where he is
[38:34] but he just says that and so he walks
[38:36] back and he's just packing all his food
[38:38] and stuff
[38:39] and i'm just keeping an eye on him now
[38:41] i'm like
[38:42] there's something going on with him so
[38:44] uh you know there's people on the line
[38:47] and they go up and they're ordering and
[38:48] he's got all his food and he's ready to
[38:49] walk out
[38:50] and i'm so close to the door so he uh
[38:53] he walks over and right before he exits
[38:57] he uh he stops and he's he's now he now
[39:00] is watching me
[39:01] and he says uh so
[39:05] uh do you believe in jesus i said yes
[39:08] okay and then he immediately is
[39:12] boldly not asking if i want to get
[39:14] prayed for
[39:15] nothing he just lays his hand on my
[39:17] shoulder
[39:18] and he says a prayer repeats a couple of
[39:20] verses
[39:21] it says uh these signs shall follow them
[39:24] that believe
[39:25] they'll go into all the world and lay
[39:26] their hands on the sick and they shall
[39:28] recover
[39:29] and he just walked out and there was
[39:32] people there and i was
[39:34] i was completely just shocked
[39:39] i was i was completely shocked i was
[39:42] like
[39:43] nobody's doing nobody's doing that i
[39:46] mean not that i've seen
[39:47] uh not in this time that i'm living in
[39:51] i mean you can get sued all kinds of
[39:53] ways and stuff
[39:54] so for you you don't even know who i
[39:58] am you just walked up and you prayed and
[40:00] and you just walked out
[40:01] and so uh you know i i took that and
[40:05] i i believed right away as soon as you
[40:08] did that i was like
[40:09] the kind of boldness that would make a
[40:11] man say that and just pray for you
[40:13] i mean i knew i was healed until i mean
[40:16] all that time i knew i was healed and
[40:19] all that i had was hope
[40:20] that i was healed but as soon as he said
[40:23] that prayer
[40:24] and he walked out i had a hundred
[40:26] percent faith i was healed
[40:27] i went back home and they were looking
[40:30] at me and they're like
[40:31] banks all right are you gonna take your
[40:33] medication
[40:35] i said no i'm i'm healed when did you
[40:37] get healed you just came here about
[40:40] two days ago who healed you
[40:44] like you just you just stopped taking
[40:45] all your medication and
[40:47] you're crazy i say well i don't know how
[40:50] to explain this to you but
[40:52] i'm healed i'm already healed he
[40:56] he healed me i don't know how to put it
[40:58] in words i mean i
[41:00] all in that time when i was when i was
[41:02] telling them i was healed
[41:04] i was my chest was too congested when
[41:06] they were asking me are you here i said
[41:07] yes i'm healed but my chest was too
[41:09] congested and
[41:10] i still had fever and stuff but after
[41:13] two days
[41:14] excuse me after two days i
[41:17] um i got my my sense of taste back
[41:21] i got my uh i got the fevers gone
[41:24] i got my appetite back and and you know
[41:27] all the symptoms were just fading off
[41:29] and fading away my chest was open back
[41:32] up and i didn't have to take
[41:33] any kind of medication my parents were
[41:35] just really upset
[41:36] about the fact that i wasn't taking any
[41:38] medication and and i know that
[41:40] you know any any parent will be
[41:42] concerned about their child
[41:43] not taking medication especially when
[41:45] they're sick but i
[41:47] i knew what i just went through i knew
[41:49] what i just experienced
[41:51] and so even though i couldn't explain it
[41:54] it was true
[41:54] it was a hundred percent true and so i
[41:56] was healed and after i waited
[41:58] uh i waited a while and and all the
[42:01] symptoms were
[42:02] gone i knew that you know god had healed
[42:04] me and
[42:05] you know even though they were saying
[42:07] well you know you you switched from
[42:09] brandon and now you're
[42:11] well i'm here my god is real my god
[42:15] heals
[42:16] and i don't have to take any of your
[42:17] your medications and everything else
[42:19] that you got laid up
[42:21] i don't have to take anything i'm healed
[42:23] you know
[42:24] and it was it was pretty it was pretty
[42:26] hard for somebody to say that
[42:28] especially seeing how covet actually is
[42:31] taking people out it is it is
[42:34] killing people and it's pretty tough
[42:36] even on uh especially
[42:38] they're showing especially on like
[42:40] african americans
[42:41] uh blacks so it's pretty tough to stand
[42:45] there and say i'm not gonna
[42:46] take anything because i know that i am
[42:49] healed
[42:49] it's pretty it was it was the only thing
[42:52] that i could rely on
[42:53] uh through that time i couldn't come to
[42:55] the church because they had forced the
[42:57] brother to close down the church i
[42:58] couldn't come here to
[43:00] get prayed for how i thought i wanted to
[43:03] get prayed for you know
[43:04] my i have somebody lay their hands on me
[43:06] so
[43:07] but god made a way and he did that
[43:11] [Applause]
[43:22] you know everybody panics when they hear
[43:26] a testimony but may i just say this a
[43:29] pardon is not a pardon until it's
[43:30] accepted as a pardon
[43:34] you know what i mean and i want to say
[43:36] this on behalf of
[43:38] banks's father i
[43:41] i've meant them and anytime you meet
[43:45] anybody in their family they got the
[43:47] most wonderful spirits
[43:49] but you know they saw
[43:52] the deity that was dwelling
[43:56] in brother branham and they recognized
[44:00] that deity and they are closer to the
[44:04] truth
[44:06] they're not as far away from the truth
[44:09] as a lot of people
[44:10] who are in the message it was
[44:14] the i want to say it's a problem
[44:18] but it it it just takes the lord to give
[44:21] you
[44:22] the revelation of that was deity
[44:25] in flesh none other than
[44:28] the same jesus christ that walked here
[44:30] on earth 2000 years ago
[44:32] no difference in the ministries
[44:36] except for the physical body
[44:40] and divide that deity from
[44:44] the flesh now
[44:47] jesus you couldn't divide the deity come
[44:50] from the flesh
[44:51] because the word was made flesh
[44:56] but in us we haven't got that theory
[45:00] body
[45:01] yet we bypass that so it's still the
[45:05] deity
[45:07] but it's not the flesh hasn't fulfilled
[45:11] that part
[45:12] of it yet and so that's
[45:16] that's why uh you know so
[45:20] when they say brother branham's god well
[45:24] it's such a razor edge
[45:27] revelation so i i pray for them
[45:31] and that the balance of the revelation
[45:34] and the understanding of the deity and
[45:37] the separation of that
[45:39] but you're closer if you recognize the
[45:42] deity
[45:43] than you are if you don't and
[45:46] so i just say that on on his behalf
[45:49] because i certainly would
[45:50] uh love to um
[45:54] you know i i there's so much truth
[45:58] in the stand that they've
[46:01] taken and the things that they see
[46:05] that you don't want to speak against the
[46:07] truth
[46:08] but you trust that the word will correct
[46:11] correct
[46:12] the air so let's stand and let's read
[46:15] one scripture
[46:18] found in our bibles
[46:22] it's the first scripture in the bible
[46:25] and let's just read that this evening
[46:28] and have a time of
[46:31] fellowship together
[46:34] and around the things of
[46:37] the word and
[46:41] trust that the lord will be our
[46:44] our portion this evening amen
[46:49] it says in the beginning god created
[46:52] the heavens and the earth
[46:56] amen our gracious heavenly father we ask
[46:59] you to bless your word in jesus name we
[47:01] pray
[47:02] amen you may be seated
[47:05] and then we also like to i
[47:09] i always like to read
[47:13] in the gospel of
[47:17] saint john and the first few verses
[47:20] there
[47:23] it says in the beginning was the word
[47:27] and the word was
[47:30] with god and the word
[47:34] was god and the same
[47:37] was in the beginning with god
[47:41] you say what's the difference between
[47:43] john and genesis the first scripture
[47:46] of genesis was before creation
[47:49] and then the first scripture in john was
[47:53] the beginning
[47:54] of creation so in the beginning there
[47:57] was just god
[47:58] but creation started with the word of
[48:01] god
[48:02] and so it's the same thing and the same
[48:05] person
[48:06] picked up in two different places
[48:10] and this evening we i just want to
[48:12] fellowship
[48:15] with you and and
[48:18] as we begin to
[48:22] understand and we talked this morning
[48:26] that we understand that there's
[48:29] something going
[48:30] on and i think that we've
[48:33] tried to emphasize that this morning and
[48:36] and i think people and believers
[48:39] are beginning to recognize that the
[48:42] enemy has his hand in something
[48:47] and he's trying to force the church or
[48:50] force the believer
[48:52] or create some sort of fear
[48:55] or some sort of doubt or
[48:58] he he's got some intention
[49:02] behind the things that happened
[49:05] that nothing's happened by chance
[49:08] and we've realized that as we talked
[49:12] this morning
[49:13] that in every age every believer
[49:17] was tested we talked about peter
[49:20] and how he was tested we talked about
[49:22] paul
[49:23] how he was tested shadrach meshach and
[49:26] abednego
[49:27] daniel all down through time
[49:30] we can take if it would be a really good
[49:34] time uh for each of us to get the fox
[49:37] book of mortars
[49:39] martyrs and any mortars which you put
[49:42] rocks together with but
[49:44] martyrs apocalypse and martyrs and read
[49:47] about
[49:49] the when the great
[49:53] horse went out and decided to
[49:56] kill and the church in power joined
[49:59] their state
[50:00] joined together in power and we see the
[50:03] church and state starting to join
[50:04] together now
[50:06] the pope coming out and saying you know
[50:09] same gender marriages are okay
[50:12] if they're done in the court and pretty
[50:15] soon they're
[50:15] they're they are being now welcomed into
[50:19] the assemblies of the catholic church
[50:21] and
[50:22] and and they're willing to start giving
[50:25] him
[50:25] limited roles and participation
[50:29] and no longer speaking against
[50:32] the act or the spirit
[50:36] as any form of perversion but
[50:39] presenting it as a natural creation
[50:42] of god now remember the scripture says
[50:46] not wishing to retain god into their
[50:49] knowledge they're giving over to a
[50:52] reprobate mind
[50:54] their conscience being seared with a hot
[50:57] iron
[50:58] and so that's what the america has done
[51:01] that's what the world's done
[51:02] they no longer wish to thank god
[51:06] in their knowledge and and they they
[51:09] rely
[51:10] and have accepted the system of
[51:13] of education and science so they feel
[51:17] they're going to find their answers
[51:19] in science and that's what i thought
[51:21] bank's testimony
[51:23] i you know that god provided an angel
[51:27] you know i personally believe that guy
[51:30] never ate those
[51:31] wings i believe he's probably nowhere to
[51:35] be
[51:36] found you know
[51:39] even the description of them is kind of
[51:42] the description that the lord gives
[51:45] but that's true okay you know
[51:48] i thought the other day when we went to
[51:51] the
[51:52] gymnasium for the young people didn't
[51:54] you just love that scripture
[51:56] on their serves we would see jesus
[51:59] and there they are making their cry out
[52:02] and yet he was here in our generation to
[52:04] be seen
[52:06] and and they they chose not to listen
[52:09] if they would have stopped and listened
[52:12] and
[52:12] heard what he said and what he was
[52:14] preaching
[52:16] they would have clung to him but just
[52:19] the fact that god
[52:20] chose to come in the ministry of a
[52:24] prophet
[52:25] was to blind them you know what i mean
[52:29] if he would have came in a great
[52:31] intellectual scholarship without the
[52:34] signs and wonders
[52:36] and made some sort of presentation they
[52:39] would accepted the idea of it
[52:42] as long as they could form it and
[52:44] present it and
[52:46] practice it in their own way but you
[52:49] have to understand that we're not given
[52:51] the
[52:51] option to practice the word of god
[52:55] in our own way our our
[52:58] goal if i could use that is to practice
[53:01] the word of god just the way that he
[53:03] spoke it
[53:05] and and so we we see that
[53:08] that so there's something and we we read
[53:12] the quote several times to you
[53:14] about the natural types
[53:17] the spiritual and so what's happening
[53:20] natural there's a spiritual parallel to
[53:23] it
[53:24] and so we know that if
[53:28] there's something that is being achieved
[53:32] another there's something that satan is
[53:36] trying to achieve you understand
[53:40] with how that he's handling this plague
[53:43] what that he wants the plague to do how
[53:46] the governments which he
[53:48] is the prophet said the world got
[53:50] exactly what they needed for a leader
[53:53] it's satan you go into
[53:56] the message of the world falling apart
[54:00] and the prophet god begins to talk about
[54:02] the world is looking for a savior
[54:05] they're looking for someone a great
[54:07] somebody a great something to arise
[54:10] and to bring them a salvation to bring
[54:13] to them
[54:14] uh something that will unify them and do
[54:18] something for them
[54:19] and we see the stage of that getting set
[54:22] now
[54:22] as it just seems like the world leaders
[54:26] now are coming together
[54:28] to see what they can do as the world
[54:32] and they begin to form these bonds they
[54:35] begin to create this power
[54:37] they begin to uh take possession
[54:42] of how that they want to do things and
[54:44] so now they
[54:45] they start out feeling that this is
[54:48] what's best for you
[54:52] okay so now they've taken your destiny
[54:55] into their hands and after their motive
[54:59] uh in their thinking is the right thing
[55:03] to do
[55:04] but then they begin to extend that
[55:06] authority
[55:07] into and extend that uh uh governing
[55:10] power and so now they feel
[55:13] what's best for you pretty soon what
[55:16] it'll be what's best for you to drive
[55:18] what's best for you to eat uh what's
[55:22] best for you you know
[55:26] i i remember when they started coming up
[55:28] with these little dinky cans
[55:30] of pop i thought
[55:34] what's this all about you know
[55:37] and people buy because they decided it
[55:40] would be better for you
[55:41] if you only drank 6 ounces instead of 16
[55:46] ounces
[55:49] well for those of us who can't live on
[55:51] sixth ounces they've got
[55:53] triple the sales you know that
[55:56] i want you to see their thinking that
[55:58] get into the thinking
[56:00] you say well brother mccarrick give me a
[56:02] scripture
[56:03] the scripture tells you that that
[56:05] thinking will go
[56:06] so far that they will persecute you
[56:10] and kill you thinking that they're doing
[56:13] god
[56:14] a service so the best thing for us
[56:19] for our health the best thing for us for
[56:22] our society
[56:24] the best thing for us is to get rid of
[56:26] these disruptors
[56:29] who speak against science who who tells
[56:32] crazy stories about
[56:34] angels coming in and laying their hands
[56:37] on them
[56:38] and saying he who is in you is greater
[56:40] than he was in the world
[56:42] and praying for you and you getting
[56:44] better
[56:46] see that's something they can't sell
[56:49] without faith
[56:53] and we remember we read the quote in in
[56:57] god of this evil age they say they pit
[56:59] soul relied in their science and
[57:01] education
[57:02] that they don't need faith they don't
[57:05] need faith to operate
[57:07] look if you have no faith there's no way
[57:10] you can please god
[57:12] because you can't please god without
[57:15] faith
[57:16] you can't serve god without believing
[57:19] his word
[57:20] you can't praise god without praising
[57:22] him
[57:23] in his word you can't please god
[57:26] without having faith in his word so once
[57:29] you separate the word of god
[57:32] you've cut the only connection
[57:35] that man has with god the only
[57:38] connection that man has with god is his
[57:41] word
[57:45] and his word is his promise the only
[57:47] connection you have with god
[57:49] is that he said i'll not leave you nor
[57:50] forsake you but i'll be with you in in
[57:53] you
[57:54] till the end that is the promises he
[57:58] made to you
[57:59] and your faith in those promises it's by
[58:03] these exceedingly great
[58:05] and precious promises that we are
[58:08] partakers
[58:09] of divine nature so that's our
[58:11] connection
[58:12] our only connection is the word of god
[58:15] if we didn't have god's word
[58:18] we didn't have the promises of his
[58:20] presence we didn't have him manifesting
[58:23] his keeping his word there would only be
[58:26] one place
[58:26] left for us to turn in that science and
[58:30] education
[58:30] and knowledge which is of the devil
[58:35] so that's why that work is so important
[58:39] so we understand that god if satan is
[58:42] something that he's trying to achieve
[58:44] and he's trying to get the world
[58:48] in a condition and in a mind
[58:51] where they feel that they need this
[58:55] super savior
[58:58] and i i didn't have the opportunity to
[59:01] find a statement
[59:04] but i believe that brother branham said
[59:06] satan would give them one
[59:12] okay but i don't want to lose the
[59:14] connection
[59:15] with god's word that's what we talked
[59:18] about this morning let's don't lose that
[59:20] connection
[59:22] with god's word let's understand that
[59:24] god is trying to achieve
[59:26] something that's what he wants
[59:29] to achieve and that's what we want to
[59:31] talk about tomorrow what is it
[59:33] that's god's trying to achieve and why
[59:36] has this test come
[59:39] up upon us and we're told don't be
[59:44] don't think it's strange get the fiery
[59:46] darts of the enemy the trying of your
[59:48] faith
[59:48] because it's more precious than gold
[59:52] and the very scripture for our age is i
[59:54] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[59:57] fire
[59:58] and when we had that scripture
[1:00:01] expounded on by the messenger of the
[1:00:04] hour he said that gold tried and
[1:00:06] fire is what christ
[1:00:09] like character
[1:00:13] because our escape is
[1:00:17] if the same spirit that dwelt in christ
[1:00:21] jesus
[1:00:22] dwelleth in you it will also quicken
[1:00:26] your mortal bodies so we see
[1:00:29] the the the the great uh
[1:00:32] thing of that so many people have
[1:00:35] placed that
[1:00:39] receiving that and
[1:00:42] and coming that into a pentecostal
[1:00:46] experience
[1:00:48] and we understood that it's not based on
[1:00:52] a pentecostal experience that we even
[1:00:55] looked
[1:00:56] at it and the and the what was going to
[1:00:58] be restored the faith of our fathers
[1:01:01] it goes back before
[1:01:05] pentecost and i i hope you that this
[1:01:08] morning
[1:01:08] i made that simple enough for the spirit
[1:01:11] the word did
[1:01:12] that those people believed
[1:01:15] in jesus if they didn't have the faith
[1:01:19] in what he said
[1:01:20] they would have never went back to that
[1:01:23] room
[1:01:25] do you understand that the the pentecost
[1:01:29] and what we call pentecost it was called
[1:01:31] pentecost because it was on the feast of
[1:01:33] pentecost
[1:01:34] which was a jewish feast that followed
[1:01:36] so many days i think it's 50 days if i'm
[1:01:39] not mistaken after the passover
[1:01:41] there was a feast that they celebrated
[1:01:43] so they came together on that feast and
[1:01:46] at that feast
[1:01:47] the spirit of god came down and gave
[1:01:49] them power
[1:01:51] and an anointed them with power to go
[1:01:54] out
[1:01:55] and start preaching the gospel with
[1:01:57] signs and wonders so that gospel
[1:02:00] would be believed eck and as that gospel
[1:02:03] went out it struck
[1:02:05] believers that were predestinated to
[1:02:08] hear it
[1:02:09] they had something in them then we know
[1:02:11] that seed went into the ground
[1:02:14] and that seed came back up and took the
[1:02:16] journey
[1:02:17] and it became in justification it came
[1:02:20] forth in sanctification
[1:02:22] and then finally it came up in the
[1:02:24] restoration of gift
[1:02:26] and pentecost and then the shock
[1:02:30] which was the restoration of gifts and
[1:02:32] that experience
[1:02:35] it pushed
[1:02:38] the word out of it
[1:02:41] so there was a separation because the
[1:02:44] seed
[1:02:46] was not air with the shock
[1:02:49] so as the life came up it was in
[1:02:51] manifestation we understand that
[1:02:54] but when it got to this age it was seed
[1:02:58] form and so really what i want to
[1:03:00] fellowship with us tonight as we're just
[1:03:02] trying to grow
[1:03:04] and and put ourselves personally in
[1:03:07] to what is the achievement that god's
[1:03:10] trying to achieve
[1:03:11] for his church and for the individual
[1:03:16] so what is he uh looking
[1:03:20] for or what let's when i say looking for
[1:03:24] he can only look for his word he can
[1:03:27] only look for what he prophesied and
[1:03:30] predestinated
[1:03:31] so what is he looking that he thought
[1:03:34] and what is he looking that he
[1:03:37] predestinated
[1:03:38] so what is he looking to come to pass
[1:03:41] in this day and i think that's one of
[1:03:45] the most
[1:03:45] beautiful parts of the message of this
[1:03:48] hour
[1:03:49] is the prophecy that god spoke
[1:03:53] of what this bride church would be
[1:03:58] and so and so we we
[1:04:01] see so we read this a few statements uh
[1:04:05] uh and and this is out of thinking man's
[1:04:09] filter he said what is it so
[1:04:14] uh he said what is it
[1:04:18] it kind of in paragraph 127 what is it
[1:04:22] it's the germ seed word
[1:04:26] from the beginning that
[1:04:29] was in god at the beginning
[1:04:34] standing here drawing
[1:04:37] the seed life
[1:04:41] the seed is in your heart
[1:04:45] by for ordination
[1:04:48] hallelujah the seed is
[1:04:52] already in there by the foreknowledge of
[1:04:55] god
[1:04:56] predestinated and when it draws
[1:05:00] it can't draw through nothing
[1:05:03] else but the
[1:05:06] word amen so we know there's something
[1:05:10] in there
[1:05:11] that's drawing is that right so
[1:05:15] if there's something that's been planted
[1:05:17] there
[1:05:18] it's been planted for a purpose and
[1:05:22] therefore if it's a seed then
[1:05:25] that means it's in the form of
[1:05:29] what that god is going to transform it
[1:05:32] into
[1:05:33] so god put an apple but because that was
[1:05:37] predestinated to be an apple
[1:05:39] he knew that every fruit
[1:05:43] that was on that tree
[1:05:46] was in that seed
[1:05:49] so it was an apple
[1:05:53] therefore we call it a apple
[1:05:56] seed so this is a bride
[1:06:01] seed but it's only in
[1:06:04] in seed form therefore if it was
[1:06:07] spoken by the word and created by the
[1:06:11] word
[1:06:12] the the creator and the speaker of it
[1:06:15] knew what he had in his mind because a
[1:06:19] word
[1:06:19] is a thought expressed so he expressed
[1:06:23] the finished work
[1:06:27] in the seed so the finished work was in
[1:06:31] the seed
[1:06:33] but god had the power to transform
[1:06:37] the the seed into
[1:06:40] the finished work
[1:06:44] and he chose to do that
[1:06:47] by redemption
[1:06:51] by fulfilling the old testament
[1:06:54] through redemption and then by paying
[1:06:57] the price of calvary
[1:06:59] and then putting that seed into the
[1:07:01] ground
[1:07:02] and then letting it begin to manifest
[1:07:06] itself
[1:07:06] so there's nothing that can draw that
[1:07:09] life
[1:07:09] through to that seed but the word
[1:07:13] so he created that seed
[1:07:16] to be manifested
[1:07:19] and produce its fruit through a certain
[1:07:23] process
[1:07:24] in a natural seed it had to be in the
[1:07:26] right environment it had to be there it
[1:07:28] had to receive water
[1:07:30] there's all those things and that
[1:07:32] natural types the spiritual seed
[1:07:34] in other words that spiritual sheet is
[1:07:37] not going to draw
[1:07:38] any life that's not in the word
[1:07:42] amen hallelujah thank god for the word
[1:07:47] thank god for the opening of the seals
[1:07:51] that gave us the word of god
[1:07:54] that the last thing that was necessary
[1:07:58] for this seed to receive and draw that
[1:08:01] life
[1:08:03] okay and so so if we say now god
[1:08:08] in the this is a back again and
[1:08:10] countdown
[1:08:12] um paragraph 37
[1:08:17] he says but god in the spiritual
[1:08:20] achievement
[1:08:22] is going forward not going backwards
[1:08:27] so this is brother brandon trying to
[1:08:29] tell the church world
[1:08:32] he was telling him more than i see but
[1:08:34] he's saying we're not going backwards
[1:08:37] we're not trying to go back to
[1:08:42] pentecost and experience
[1:08:45] those gifts so
[1:08:49] what i i want to just spend a few
[1:08:51] moments this evening if you will allow
[1:08:54] me
[1:08:54] and if i was to tell to
[1:08:58] put a title on my sermon i i would call
[1:09:01] it
[1:09:02] gifts by attribute
[1:09:07] gifts by attribute restoration
[1:09:10] by attribute signs and wonders
[1:09:15] by attribute okay so we
[1:09:19] we see he says that if spiritual me is
[1:09:22] going forward and not going back
[1:09:25] he is going forward looking
[1:09:28] into the word
[1:09:32] so in order to look into the word you
[1:09:34] have to look into
[1:09:36] what did god have in his mind
[1:09:39] when he planted that seed what was the
[1:09:43] finished work of that seed and how was
[1:09:46] he going to transform that seed
[1:09:49] into the product that he planted
[1:09:55] and so we can look and we saw that
[1:09:57] justification didn't match up
[1:10:01] to the original seed nothing
[1:10:05] matched up to that
[1:10:08] masterpiece seed so he said he's going
[1:10:11] forward
[1:10:12] looking into the word and believing
[1:10:16] the promises for things that
[1:10:19] never has come yet
[1:10:26] for the spiritual revelation
[1:10:30] to manifest the spiritual things
[1:10:33] that god has promised
[1:10:38] oh my what a vision
[1:10:43] what what a thirst okay
[1:10:46] i i i i god's there's something he wants
[1:10:50] to achieve
[1:10:51] he wants us to move into something
[1:10:54] that hasn't been yet
[1:10:58] another it wasn't its time
[1:11:01] it wasn't its season the seed is coming
[1:11:04] up
[1:11:05] but that apple tree is not coming up
[1:11:08] just to be the sprout
[1:11:10] it's not looking just to be the seed
[1:11:12] it's not looking just to
[1:11:14] be the flower or the bud what it's
[1:11:17] looking for is the fruit that was
[1:11:21] in it when it was created
[1:11:29] that's what it's looking for it hasn't
[1:11:32] seen that yet
[1:11:34] but it's looking for the revelation
[1:11:40] where's the revelation that's what it's
[1:11:42] looking for
[1:11:43] it's looking for the spiritual
[1:11:46] revelation
[1:11:47] to manifest the spiritual things
[1:11:51] that god has promised
[1:11:54] so we began to look what did he promise
[1:11:58] what was his achievement what was he
[1:12:01] what was he moving towards
[1:12:03] and if we can see that the revelation of
[1:12:06] that
[1:12:06] then we can move forward because we know
[1:12:10] what we're believing for
[1:12:11] we know what we're looking to be
[1:12:13] manifested
[1:12:14] we now can have faith
[1:12:19] because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:12:21] hearing by the word of god
[1:12:23] you can't have faith in trying to
[1:12:26] reproduce
[1:12:27] something that somebody else had
[1:12:33] what's that called counterfeit
[1:12:39] amen it's like us building an ark
[1:12:45] to get out of here
[1:12:49] so we know there's something because so
[1:12:52] we
[1:12:52] we begin to take the word of god and we
[1:12:54] begin to see
[1:12:55] what what is it that god's trying to
[1:12:58] achieve
[1:12:59] how can he how can he try how can he
[1:13:03] achieve these things and then so we just
[1:13:06] take a moment and look
[1:13:07] in the message who is this melchizedek
[1:13:20] so we see in this who this malchesta
[1:13:23] deck was
[1:13:25] and we go back to the
[1:13:28] beginning and let's say paragraph 44 of
[1:13:30] who's this melchizedek
[1:13:33] he said god came down
[1:13:37] and became flesh and died the death
[1:13:41] in christ so that he
[1:13:44] could clean the church
[1:13:47] in order to get into it
[1:13:51] for fellowship
[1:13:56] god loves fellowship that's what he
[1:13:59] made the man in the in
[1:14:02] at the first time was for
[1:14:06] fellowship god dwelt alone with his
[1:14:09] serpents
[1:14:10] he says now notice he made man and man
[1:14:14] fell he came down and redeemed man
[1:14:17] because
[1:14:17] god loves to be worshiped the very
[1:14:21] word god means worship oh i mean let's
[1:14:24] just stop and look at that for a second
[1:14:27] he said god made man because
[1:14:32] he wanted fellowship right
[1:14:35] he walked with adam in the cool of the
[1:14:37] evening
[1:14:38] adam was his son everything was found
[1:14:41] and then man fell
[1:14:43] so he came and redeemed man
[1:14:47] because god loves to be worshiped
[1:14:50] he he he redeemed man so man can
[1:14:54] worship him i'm redeemed
[1:14:57] thank you lord what does redeem me
[1:15:00] it means to be brought back
[1:15:06] so god paid the price at calvary
[1:15:09] a man began to worship him because his
[1:15:12] sins
[1:15:13] were forgiven but he didn't finish his
[1:15:16] work
[1:15:17] at calvary
[1:15:22] he redeemed the seed
[1:15:25] in other words if i could say this he
[1:15:27] made the seed
[1:15:28] worthy to be planted
[1:15:33] now that seed's planted it's back
[1:15:38] to its original purpose
[1:15:44] why he spoke it in the beginning
[1:15:48] now he's on his way back to fellowship
[1:15:51] now he's on his way back to perfection
[1:15:54] now he's on his way back
[1:15:55] to where he came from so he allowed us
[1:15:58] to redeem
[1:15:59] so we could worship him we could
[1:16:02] fellowship with him
[1:16:04] and so he says now god in the beginning
[1:16:06] dwell alone
[1:16:08] as i spoke this morning in his thoughts
[1:16:11] there was nothing
[1:16:13] just god alone and his thoughts
[1:16:19] and just like a great architect can set
[1:16:21] down in his mind
[1:16:24] and draw out what he thinks he's going
[1:16:26] to build
[1:16:28] create now he cannot create
[1:16:31] he can take something that's been
[1:16:33] created and make it in a different form
[1:16:36] because god is the only
[1:16:39] because god is the only way only one
[1:16:43] can create but he gets in his mind what
[1:16:47] he's going to
[1:16:48] do and that's his thought
[1:16:52] that's his desire and
[1:16:55] now it's a thought and then he speaks it
[1:16:59] and it's a word and a word
[1:17:02] is a thought when it's expressed
[1:17:07] is a word god thoughts expressed
[1:17:11] is the word but first it has to be a
[1:17:15] thought
[1:17:16] first so it's god's
[1:17:19] attributes then it becomes a thought
[1:17:24] then the word notice
[1:17:27] those who have tonight eternal life
[1:17:31] was with him and in him
[1:17:35] in his thinking before
[1:17:38] there ever was an angel
[1:17:41] star seraphim or anything else
[1:17:45] that's eternal if you have
[1:17:48] eternal life you always was
[1:17:52] now you're beginning here but shape
[1:17:57] but the shape and the form and he says
[1:18:00] he was
[1:18:01] infinite so we know that we we
[1:18:04] we can go down that road a long time but
[1:18:06] what we just wanted to say is
[1:18:08] we know that we were in his thinking in
[1:18:12] the beginning so what was in his
[1:18:15] thinking is what that seed
[1:18:18] is going to produce now we understand
[1:18:23] this
[1:18:23] and as we just go this because we're
[1:18:25] trying to get to a little point
[1:18:27] and give some good background to it we
[1:18:30] know that god allowed adam to fall
[1:18:34] so in the beginning adam had fellowship
[1:18:36] with god
[1:18:38] and adam was created by god and we're
[1:18:42] gonna
[1:18:42] just read in the masterpiece in here in
[1:18:44] a moment
[1:18:46] but was adam was walking with god adam
[1:18:49] knew
[1:18:50] that there was a part of him
[1:18:56] that adam never knew
[1:19:00] he didn't know that that
[1:19:04] god was a healer because there was no
[1:19:08] sickness there
[1:19:12] he didn't know god there was a
[1:19:14] deliverance
[1:19:16] because he was not captive to anything
[1:19:20] if you've got a habit
[1:19:23] and and i know smoking is one of the
[1:19:26] hardest
[1:19:27] habits to break uh some people have drug
[1:19:31] addictions
[1:19:31] pain pill addictions uh they have
[1:19:35] they have anxiety medicines addicted
[1:19:39] and you're addicted when you come to the
[1:19:42] place that you don't feel you can live
[1:19:44] without it
[1:19:45] or you've got to have it you can and and
[1:19:48] then you're addicted when this thing
[1:19:51] changes the environment in which you
[1:19:53] think
[1:19:54] and and when you're not under the abuse
[1:19:57] of the substance
[1:19:58] or you're not under the influence of a
[1:20:00] substance
[1:20:01] you feel different now you've created an
[1:20:06] addiction
[1:20:06] an addiction is a bondage
[1:20:10] and man there was none of that there
[1:20:14] so he didn't know god was a deliverer
[1:20:18] and and brother man makes the statement
[1:20:20] he says
[1:20:21] god was a healer and he wanted to
[1:20:23] manifest these attributes
[1:20:25] he said now don't be children now
[1:20:29] so understand that so we sit back and
[1:20:32] say well that's not fair
[1:20:33] for god to uh to let me fall
[1:20:37] and let me sin and let me become
[1:20:39] addicted
[1:20:40] so so he can manifest his attributes oh
[1:20:45] he's more just than that he put your
[1:20:48] name
[1:20:49] on a lamb's book of life before the
[1:20:52] foundation of the world
[1:20:53] eternally secures you in him you were in
[1:20:56] his thinking
[1:20:57] in the beginning and so he knew
[1:21:01] that what that he put in you
[1:21:04] and where it would end up
[1:21:07] because he's the beginning and the end
[1:21:10] he's your alpha
[1:21:12] and he's your omega is that right
[1:21:15] and nothing ever nothing will ever
[1:21:17] change that
[1:21:19] and and so we we
[1:21:22] realized that that that's that gene seed
[1:21:24] so
[1:21:25] he goes out and so adam begins to
[1:21:28] find out
[1:21:32] that adam's alone
[1:21:36] well god was alone
[1:21:40] right so now god creates adam
[1:21:43] adam is is an image and likeness adam is
[1:21:46] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:21:48] adam's the thus a son of god
[1:21:52] and adam's alone so
[1:21:55] adam god takes from adam
[1:21:58] a part of adam and we could go
[1:22:02] spiritually in the separation of the two
[1:22:04] attributes that were in adam male and
[1:22:06] female he separates the female part out
[1:22:09] now adam's got somebody says bone in my
[1:22:11] bone flesh of my flesh
[1:22:17] and the lord tells them don't eat of
[1:22:19] this
[1:22:21] but adam doesn't know that god's a
[1:22:22] deliverer he doesn't know he's a savior
[1:22:25] he doesn't know all this sight of god
[1:22:27] so god allows eve
[1:22:31] because she's a byproduct adam would
[1:22:35] have
[1:22:35] never never never
[1:22:41] went there
[1:22:45] but eve was approached
[1:22:50] she wasn't the original creation she was
[1:22:53] part of the original creation
[1:22:57] so when satan brought reasoning to her
[1:23:00] and he showed her in a perversion
[1:23:04] all the plan that god had
[1:23:08] and and as we read it eve had the
[1:23:12] let me see if i can find that if i even
[1:23:15] brought it out here
[1:23:16] this evening uh
[1:23:20] i guess i i must have left it in my room
[1:23:23] but we read it four or five times so
[1:23:25] he said that eve had the word of god in
[1:23:28] her hand
[1:23:31] and instead of seeking the baptism of
[1:23:34] the holy spirit he was typing the church
[1:23:36] there
[1:23:36] he said she he she let satan
[1:23:40] talk him out of it and say that that was
[1:23:42] the days of the apostles
[1:23:44] well don't you think that when that
[1:23:48] when satan was tempting eve
[1:23:54] that he came to jesus
[1:23:57] with the same temptation that he gave
[1:24:01] eve
[1:24:04] showed her all the kingdoms of the world
[1:24:07] showed her what a great thing would come
[1:24:09] to pass
[1:24:10] what great science and education because
[1:24:12] remember brother brahm said that eve
[1:24:15] gave the whole world over to the science
[1:24:18] and
[1:24:19] educational system of satan
[1:24:22] believing it was the church
[1:24:28] so he he lays this whole program
[1:24:31] out there and lets her know the way that
[1:24:34] it can be
[1:24:35] achieved and that's what he said
[1:24:39] you participate in this with me you'll
[1:24:42] now
[1:24:42] enter my kingdom you'll take on
[1:24:45] forms you'll you'll grow you'll multiply
[1:24:49] and you'll be able to build this he
[1:24:50] didn't even know adam
[1:24:56] that whole type of relationship was
[1:24:59] totally hid she wasn't in those realms
[1:25:03] because he had kept him out of those
[1:25:05] realms
[1:25:08] and one day we're going to return back
[1:25:11] and find out
[1:25:12] totally what he had in mind
[1:25:17] look there she is so he says okay
[1:25:21] and he explains this to her and lays it
[1:25:24] out to her the scripture says he seduced
[1:25:27] her
[1:25:28] he beguiled her he lied to her
[1:25:32] and and told her something that she
[1:25:35] thought was god
[1:25:38] she believed satan's lie as god's truth
[1:25:43] now here's where i want to start my
[1:25:47] thought this evening
[1:25:48] she comes back to adam she talks about
[1:25:51] the serpent
[1:25:53] she talks about that adam partakes of it
[1:25:58] and he finds out
[1:26:01] that it's not
[1:26:06] the truth i wasn't there
[1:26:09] i don't know all that went on
[1:26:14] but this i know is that
[1:26:18] adam could have
[1:26:22] put eve out
[1:26:25] but adam was a son of god
[1:26:30] amen god adam was created by god
[1:26:34] in order to be created of god and god be
[1:26:37] his father
[1:26:38] adam had to have in him the attributes
[1:26:43] of god
[1:26:44] so adam the first adam
[1:26:48] was a living soul
[1:26:51] the second adam was a quickening spirit
[1:26:55] both of them were adam or if i could say
[1:26:58] this one both of them were the sons of
[1:27:00] god
[1:27:01] one was a living soul one was a
[1:27:03] quickening spirit
[1:27:04] but they were the sons of god because
[1:27:06] they possessed
[1:27:07] the attributes of god they were the
[1:27:11] gene of god god's
[1:27:14] gene another gene is the
[1:27:18] substance the makeup the transferable
[1:27:22] part from the father or the mother
[1:27:26] to the child that gives them their
[1:27:29] characteristic
[1:27:30] that gives them their features and
[1:27:33] everything my family has a gene
[1:27:35] nose
[1:27:42] and as you notice that the children that
[1:27:45] gene mixes with the
[1:27:47] mother gene and then the features begin
[1:27:49] to change
[1:27:50] you see you say oh that looks you got
[1:27:53] these features of your grandfather
[1:27:55] this looks like this but yet now they
[1:27:57] picked up the features the genes of the
[1:27:59] mother that can the features start to go
[1:28:02] forward and
[1:28:04] the transformation takes place but adam
[1:28:07] only had
[1:28:08] one place to get his gene
[1:28:13] that was god so
[1:28:16] adam had the genes of god in him
[1:28:20] so when heckle and eve when he could
[1:28:22] have put eve away
[1:28:24] he could have then adam didn't know
[1:28:28] that adam had and possessed
[1:28:31] within him the gene the
[1:28:34] attribute of forgiveness
[1:28:41] he didn't okay he had the attribute
[1:28:44] of deliverance
[1:28:48] all of a sudden he couldn't turn the eve
[1:28:51] out
[1:28:52] he he wanted to care for her he was a
[1:28:55] part of him
[1:28:56] he wasn't gonna let her go he wasn't
[1:28:58] just gonna turn her out and have her be
[1:29:00] destroyed
[1:29:01] he was gonna go out and protect her he
[1:29:03] was gonna go out and provide for her
[1:29:05] he was gonna go out and redeem her his
[1:29:07] whole purpose was to get her back
[1:29:13] why because he was of the father
[1:29:17] he had the attributes the attributes
[1:29:20] were in them
[1:29:23] they were the gene of god
[1:29:28] have you ever heard the prophet say that
[1:29:30] you are
[1:29:31] the gene of god
[1:29:34] your gene was in your father sometimes
[1:29:37] they
[1:29:37] refer to it as a jain that it was in
[1:29:40] your father
[1:29:42] you were in your father
[1:29:46] you were there so where was this seed
[1:29:52] the seed was in the father
[1:29:55] it was in the thinking of god's in the
[1:29:58] thinking of
[1:30:00] god so when he created this seed
[1:30:03] the only thing he had put into that seed
[1:30:06] was
[1:30:07] what that he was
[1:30:10] the genes of god so let's look
[1:30:13] just here at a moment and let's go to
[1:30:16] the message
[1:30:17] the masterpiece
[1:30:21] paragraph 101 and let's just have some
[1:30:25] wonderful
[1:30:28] if we could just turn over to the other
[1:30:29] page i'd like to read this
[1:30:31] quote on page 96.
[1:30:40] it says paragraph 96 the same book the
[1:30:42] masterpiece just a word
[1:30:44] quick insert of comfort remember he was
[1:30:47] the son
[1:30:48] of prosperity everything that he did
[1:30:51] prospered whether it was
[1:30:55] prison or whatever it was he'd come out
[1:30:58] right
[1:30:58] amen he said he
[1:31:02] and he hasn't he promised for his
[1:31:04] children
[1:31:06] that i believe he was talking about
[1:31:08] joseph and those things there he said
[1:31:11] hasn't he promised for his children that
[1:31:14] he'd make
[1:31:15] everything work together for the good
[1:31:18] whether it was sickness
[1:31:22] prison house death sorrow
[1:31:26] whatever it was that it would work
[1:31:30] for the good to them that love him
[1:31:34] he promised it it must be so
[1:31:38] it's got to be there
[1:31:42] it's figurative spoken
[1:31:45] to us in him he was that perfect image
[1:31:49] of god
[1:31:50] now we see here also that when
[1:31:53] he comes again and and he's going on and
[1:31:57] you can go pick that up
[1:31:59] so he's talking that that he was this
[1:32:02] perfect
[1:32:03] image of god in order for jesus to be
[1:32:06] the perfect image of god he'd have to
[1:32:08] possess what god was
[1:32:10] all that god was he poured into him so
[1:32:13] all the attributes that god had
[1:32:17] he poured into him so what i'm talking
[1:32:19] about
[1:32:20] is is gifts by attribute
[1:32:24] because everybody is talking and i got a
[1:32:27] lot of these questions
[1:32:28] when will the church be endued with that
[1:32:31] pentecostal power
[1:32:33] when's that pentecostal power going to
[1:32:35] come back
[1:32:36] that the gifts will be working in the
[1:32:38] church that the nine gifts spiritual
[1:32:41] gifts will be working
[1:32:43] that that will have anointing and people
[1:32:46] will stand up and prophesy
[1:32:48] what i'm trying to say is is that is
[1:32:50] going to return
[1:32:52] but it's not going to return in the form
[1:32:54] of a gift
[1:32:56] it's going to turn back in the form of
[1:32:58] an attribute
[1:33:00] that's exactly right
[1:33:03] amen so it's not going to be
[1:33:08] i've got this it's going to be
[1:33:11] i am this
[1:33:15] i don't have the gift of healing i have
[1:33:18] the attribute of healing
[1:33:21] it's the gene that is in me
[1:33:25] the characteristic of my father
[1:33:28] manifested in me not by gift
[1:33:32] but by inheritance
[1:33:40] he knew it was in the seed you don't
[1:33:43] think he stood there and said the works
[1:33:44] that i do
[1:33:46] you shall do also
[1:33:52] now it's simple to preach the holy
[1:33:56] spirit comes down
[1:33:57] most people in the view of a third
[1:34:00] person
[1:34:01] or anointing comes down it causes me to
[1:34:04] do this
[1:34:07] but this tree this bright tree
[1:34:12] is going to a maturity
[1:34:16] where it's beyond a gift
[1:34:21] it's now a possession
[1:34:24] they possess
[1:34:27] the matured fruit possesses the same
[1:34:31] seed that goes
[1:34:32] into the ground and can reproduce the
[1:34:35] tree
[1:34:39] so what's he trying to achieve
[1:34:44] and why is this coming on us
[1:34:50] we possess victory we possess
[1:34:52] resurrection
[1:34:54] possessors of the resurrection
[1:34:57] so let's go back
[1:35:03] to paragraph 100
[1:35:06] the next page over now we could go on
[1:35:08] and on with that
[1:35:12] but i believe you have the picture
[1:35:16] of what i mean now god building
[1:35:19] back his masterpiece
[1:35:23] so
[1:35:26] he's building it back right
[1:35:31] and so we know the story and why christ
[1:35:34] speak it comes into such a perfect image
[1:35:37] he says he takes the hammer and says
[1:35:40] speak
[1:35:43] and then in brother branham's message he
[1:35:46] says god finally got tired of me
[1:35:50] and said don't cry unto me didn't i
[1:35:53] make you a prophet do you not possess
[1:35:56] the gene do you not possess the
[1:35:59] attribute
[1:36:01] in other words take what you are take
[1:36:04] what i
[1:36:04] made you take what i said and manifest
[1:36:08] it
[1:36:09] get the revelation where you can
[1:36:11] manifest
[1:36:12] the things you haven't seen yet it's
[1:36:15] time we just keep believing
[1:36:17] believing for and we begin to find out
[1:36:20] how do we get them
[1:36:24] they asked brother branham should we
[1:36:26] seek the gifts he said no
[1:36:28] seek him
[1:36:34] am i screaming my mother always tells me
[1:36:38] you'd be a good preacher if you didn't
[1:36:40] scream
[1:36:45] i i wanted to say mama you've heard
[1:36:47] listen to those priests
[1:36:49] too long but i believe my mama's going
[1:36:51] to be there
[1:36:54] now he says
[1:36:58] but now let's not forget
[1:37:02] that in the beginning when he smote the
[1:37:06] sight of adam
[1:37:07] he took something from his side
[1:37:12] is that's up there right
[1:37:16] he's met christ for a cause
[1:37:23] that he might take from him one
[1:37:27] to be a family the bride
[1:37:30] that he might take him a bride
[1:37:34] so when his masterpiece was perfected
[1:37:38] then when he had to smite it to take
[1:37:42] from him
[1:37:43] not another piece not
[1:37:46] another creation but of the same
[1:37:49] creation in other words
[1:37:53] not another attribute
[1:37:58] not another personality not
[1:38:01] something new but a piece of the same
[1:38:05] creation so what eve was
[1:38:09] when adam looked at it he said flesh of
[1:38:11] my flesh
[1:38:12] bone of my bone a part of me i'll color
[1:38:16] a woman
[1:38:18] a from the man a part of me this is me
[1:38:24] so when he smoked christ he smoked
[1:38:26] christ for a reason
[1:38:31] my brother don't think bad at this
[1:38:36] but think a minute if he took
[1:38:39] from him the original creation to make
[1:38:44] the bride for him
[1:38:47] he never made another
[1:38:50] creation he took a part of the original
[1:38:54] creation
[1:38:56] then if he was the word
[1:38:59] what must the bride be it's got to be
[1:39:03] the original word
[1:39:07] living god in the word
[1:39:13] what was the original word the original
[1:39:15] word was what
[1:39:17] made flesh what
[1:39:20] was it before it was word
[1:39:24] attributes it was
[1:39:27] gene
[1:39:30] the makeup what he was what he possessed
[1:39:34] how he thought how he did things
[1:39:37] that's why the prophet god said if god
[1:39:39] ever does one thing one way he's always
[1:39:41] got to continually do it the same way
[1:39:43] why because it came from him
[1:39:46] as a part of him it was what he was made
[1:39:50] out of so when god made
[1:39:53] adam in his own image what that image
[1:39:56] was
[1:39:57] it wasn't that god had flesh the image
[1:39:59] was the attributes
[1:40:03] the characteristics the gene
[1:40:07] that was the image that adam was made in
[1:40:10] he possessed the same attributes that
[1:40:14] he did his father did i could have got
[1:40:17] those quotes
[1:40:18] how many have heard him you were in your
[1:40:21] father
[1:40:22] you have your gene of your father you
[1:40:24] have the attribute of his father
[1:40:30] so here we see it because oh cadaver one
[1:40:34] not a new creation that's what adam was
[1:40:37] he was the image of god he was the
[1:40:39] possessor
[1:40:40] of the attributes of god
[1:40:45] that's why in that garden he could say
[1:40:47] name the trees
[1:40:48] tell the animals he did everything
[1:40:52] he had what the father had
[1:40:56] so he makes the second adam let's just
[1:41:02] read
[1:41:10] let's just go over to paragraph 106.
[1:41:17] he said his life matched all the peoples
[1:41:22] it pleased god to smite him
[1:41:27] and now why did he smite him
[1:41:31] for the same cause that he had
[1:41:35] to smite adam
[1:41:40] to get a bride to get a family
[1:41:43] to get a part of himself that he could
[1:41:46] have fellowship
[1:41:47] that he could be worshipped
[1:41:52] he didn't take a different creation
[1:41:56] he took the attributes that were in adam
[1:42:00] and he put him in eve
[1:42:04] he says now we see him stricken smitten
[1:42:07] of god
[1:42:08] and afflicted the perfect lamb for
[1:42:11] sinners sinner slains
[1:42:12] a perfect masterpiece now for nearly 2
[1:42:16] 000
[1:42:17] years god has
[1:42:20] been again making him a masterpiece
[1:42:24] because he struck adam to get a
[1:42:27] masterpiece off of him part of him
[1:42:31] a rib to make a wife for him
[1:42:35] and now that perfect masterpiece
[1:42:40] that have been struck at calvary he
[1:42:43] got a piece off of him
[1:42:46] it's just the new testament
[1:42:50] that's all he fulfilled
[1:42:53] the old testament now it's the new
[1:42:57] testament
[1:42:58] another piece to be fulfilled
[1:43:01] so what happened in the beginning the
[1:43:04] old testament
[1:43:05] became flesh
[1:43:09] didn't it every promise
[1:43:12] everything that god said i'll put enmity
[1:43:14] between thy seed
[1:43:16] and your seeds i'll send a redeemer all
[1:43:18] the promises concerning him
[1:43:21] they were all there in the beginning was
[1:43:22] the word and the word was made flesh
[1:43:25] the attributes of god were made flesh
[1:43:28] now this bride comes forth and
[1:43:32] and the purpose of spiting this bride
[1:43:35] is so that she now if the if the
[1:43:39] old testament was made flesh
[1:43:42] he says the old testament's foreshadowed
[1:43:45] the new
[1:43:48] christ come the masterpiece
[1:43:52] to fulfill that the old testament
[1:43:56] now his bride will fulfill everything
[1:43:59] that's in the new testament another
[1:44:03] masterpiece in the making so
[1:44:06] if the first masterpiece
[1:44:11] was a possessor of the attributes
[1:44:17] he did things by the attributes that was
[1:44:20] in him
[1:44:21] you understand it was the nature that
[1:44:23] was in him
[1:44:24] it was the gene that was in him he
[1:44:27] inherited the way he does things
[1:44:35] you know i i i i excuse me
[1:44:38] uh zoey's going to get mad at me but i
[1:44:40] know she look but when i see zoe i
[1:44:42] i just crack up
[1:44:46] i see a little laura
[1:44:51] you know what i'm here
[1:44:54] you know the older you get you start
[1:44:56] seeing people and younger people
[1:44:59] i remember the first time i went back to
[1:45:01] michigan with my mom we're on the train
[1:45:03] and she going oh that's such and such
[1:45:07] i'd say mom they're only 25.
[1:45:11] you know you're 50. it's been 25 years
[1:45:15] old
[1:45:16] since you've seen them but she saw those
[1:45:19] people
[1:45:20] in those young people that come to find
[1:45:22] out some of them were relatives and the
[1:45:25] daughters
[1:45:26] and the things of her friends
[1:45:30] you see if god ever does things so if
[1:45:32] he's passing down the gene
[1:45:34] that you are into your children and he
[1:45:37] and that's the way he does things he's
[1:45:39] not going to change the
[1:45:41] program so in the beginning adam
[1:45:45] he was made in the image of the gene
[1:45:49] and attributes of god so he possessed
[1:45:52] them
[1:45:53] by attribute and by gene
[1:45:56] not by gift
[1:46:03] they possess them by gift
[1:46:09] because they're not part of the original
[1:46:15] but you don't possess the power to heal
[1:46:18] by gift
[1:46:19] you don't possess the power to deliver
[1:46:22] by gift
[1:46:26] you don't possess the hour the power
[1:46:29] to impart eternal life
[1:46:35] that day on calvary that's what he said
[1:46:37] you can impart
[1:46:39] eternal life you don't do that by gift
[1:46:44] so people are looking for the
[1:46:46] restoration of gifts
[1:46:48] god's looking for the maturity of
[1:46:52] attributes
[1:46:55] he's looking for the bride to become one
[1:46:58] with the word
[1:46:59] and possess those things by nature
[1:47:03] by gene by attribute and not by seeking
[1:47:07] a gift
[1:47:09] but by receiving the spiritual
[1:47:12] revelation
[1:47:13] to manifest what god promised
[1:47:17] and what did he promise
[1:47:20] the restoration of
[1:47:24] the bride
[1:47:32] now his bride will fulfill everything
[1:47:35] that's
[1:47:35] in the new testament
[1:47:39] if the old testament was made flesh
[1:47:44] then the new testament has to be made
[1:47:46] flesh
[1:47:48] so it's made flesh there's nothing
[1:47:52] that's in the new testament that's
[1:47:55] outside of that flesh
[1:48:00] so healing's in the word
[1:48:04] and the word is made flesh
[1:48:08] no wonder he'd look out at us and say
[1:48:10] you're the word of god
[1:48:13] you're the attributes of god you're the
[1:48:16] gene of god
[1:48:17] what was he doing he was prophesying
[1:48:20] he was telling us what we were maturing
[1:48:23] to
[1:48:24] he was telling us really what was
[1:48:28] the shock going to spill out
[1:48:33] the shock received the life
[1:48:36] by gifts
[1:48:40] but the seed didn't receive the life by
[1:48:43] gift the seed received the life
[1:48:46] because it was spoken in the beginning
[1:48:49] in them
[1:48:52] they had seed life from the beginning
[1:48:58] they were the possessors of the fruit
[1:49:04] not having the gifts of it i can give
[1:49:08] you
[1:49:08] a gift of an apple
[1:49:11] but the only way you can become an apple
[1:49:15] is if you have an apple seed
[1:49:20] not have a seed or
[1:49:23] a seed
[1:49:27] those gifts were in the seed
[1:49:32] so this was in a church so when the
[1:49:35] shock
[1:49:36] finally got up there they had no
[1:49:38] inheritance
[1:49:40] with the seed because the shack
[1:49:43] was not air to what the seed was going
[1:49:48] to get
[1:49:49] the shack was an heir to the gifts the
[1:49:52] shack was an
[1:49:53] heir to the possession of the attributes
[1:49:56] the shuck was in heir to possession of
[1:49:59] the gene
[1:50:00] only the seed was so they went back
[1:50:06] to pentecost
[1:50:10] they went back for
[1:50:13] the anointing they went back
[1:50:16] for the oil they went back to find what
[1:50:21] they could do
[1:50:21] to reproduce this and they came up with
[1:50:25] every denominational scheme
[1:50:27] every kind of program every kind of
[1:50:30] hokey oil
[1:50:31] and and stuff that they could come up
[1:50:34] with every kind of anointing
[1:50:36] raising every kind of man up but let me
[1:50:38] tell you something we saw the fruit
[1:50:41] in our generation not a man a man that
[1:50:43] possessed it
[1:50:52] made flesh the new testament made flesh
[1:50:57] so we're not looking
[1:51:00] for gifts to produce
[1:51:06] power we're not looking for gifts to
[1:51:10] heal
[1:51:12] we're looking for the attribute to be
[1:51:16] matured in us
[1:51:18] that we have such love
[1:51:25] that that we know that
[1:51:28] he is in you and with you
[1:51:32] tell the end
[1:51:35] that you possess the statue of a perfect
[1:51:39] man
[1:51:41] you mature into it you know what it is
[1:51:45] that god's trying to fulfill in you
[1:51:47] you know what it is he's trying to bring
[1:51:49] out in you
[1:51:50] he's not trying to get you to get
[1:51:52] something from the outside god
[1:51:54] remember this other spirit works from
[1:51:57] the outside
[1:51:58] to change the inside
[1:52:05] brother brown talks about the control
[1:52:07] tower
[1:52:09] okay but god works from the inside out
[1:52:13] until he can get what's on the inside
[1:52:18] the seed manifested
[1:52:21] on the outside and finally she starts
[1:52:25] burying the fruits
[1:52:26] she farts bearing the characteristics
[1:52:29] she starts
[1:52:30] bearing to the attributes she's one
[1:52:33] and she stands up and says i'm the tree
[1:52:36] that's planted i have the fruits
[1:52:42] the tree of life
[1:52:45] is in her and they're one
[1:52:49] there they are the word
[1:52:53] and we've got to end
[1:52:57] this idea of seeking
[1:53:02] an anointing to produce
[1:53:05] something when what's going to be
[1:53:10] produced is the very life that he
[1:53:13] predestinated
[1:53:14] in you and created in you and that life
[1:53:17] is making its journey in your person
[1:53:22] in your mind in your heart
[1:53:25] drawing you that seed life drawing you
[1:53:29] to where that he spoke of you and that
[1:53:33] he
[1:53:33] created you that those
[1:53:37] attributes can be
[1:53:42] made he says as it's taken him 4
[1:53:45] 000 years to make his masterpiece now
[1:53:49] he's been for nearly 2
[1:53:50] 000 years making another masterpiece
[1:53:54] a bride for christ another masterpiece
[1:53:57] in doing it he does it
[1:54:01] by his never changing method
[1:54:04] the same way he made the masterpiece his
[1:54:08] word that's the way he makes his
[1:54:10] masterpiece
[1:54:11] because he can only be a perfect
[1:54:15] masterpiece
[1:54:16] when it's perfect word
[1:54:20] he does it the same way how'd he do it
[1:54:23] in the beginning
[1:54:26] he took his attributes and made flesh
[1:54:33] how did he let adam adam know
[1:54:36] that he had those attributes because
[1:54:39] when eve went out
[1:54:41] all of a sudden adam found out he had
[1:54:43] things in him that he didn't even know
[1:54:45] there
[1:54:45] and where do you think he knew he got
[1:54:48] him
[1:54:51] have you ever realized the patience that
[1:54:54] you've got
[1:54:56] came from somewhere the love you've
[1:54:58] got's come from where
[1:55:00] the way you feel about somebody that's
[1:55:02] lost
[1:55:03] that came from somewhere
[1:55:07] oh if i could just express it
[1:55:10] we're moving to higher ground the
[1:55:13] prophet of god said if a messenger comes
[1:55:16] and preaches the same old message
[1:55:18] it's not a message from god if he came
[1:55:21] and preached the same old restoration of
[1:55:23] gifts
[1:55:23] the same old church the same old spirit
[1:55:26] moving in the congregation
[1:55:28] the people coming and getting whooped up
[1:55:31] no it's you out there with a
[1:55:35] vision and a revelation
[1:55:39] of what he was
[1:55:42] like that little eagle it looked up
[1:55:44] there and saw
[1:55:45] that's what i want to be
[1:55:48] and then that eagle cried out and says
[1:55:51] you
[1:55:51] are me you are a part of me
[1:55:55] you have in you what i have in me
[1:55:58] you have in you what it takes to fly
[1:56:03] because you came from me and because you
[1:56:06] came for me you got the attributes of an
[1:56:08] eagle
[1:56:09] you got the eyes of the eagle you got
[1:56:11] the wings of the eagle
[1:56:13] you've got a veke to eat fresh manna
[1:56:16] what do i do mama
[1:56:22] stay in the barnyard and talk about it
[1:56:31] flap the wings
[1:56:35] exercise the attribute
[1:56:40] isn't it about time we say he who is in
[1:56:43] me
[1:56:44] is greater here comes this angel that
[1:56:46] comes says
[1:56:47] remember son he was in me is greater
[1:56:51] than he was in the world
[1:56:52] goes back and preaches the great
[1:56:54] commission and disappears
[1:57:02] when are we going to flap the world's
[1:57:06] got a flapper
[1:57:09] don't you think it's about time we god's
[1:57:11] got something that's slapping their
[1:57:12] wings
[1:57:15] that in the face of the adversity brings
[1:57:18] the word of god
[1:57:20] i love it brother i'm sitting there at
[1:57:21] that state fair
[1:57:24] and he's just listening you know he's
[1:57:26] out with his kids and his kids probably
[1:57:28] think you know daddy's always having
[1:57:30] visions he's always talking to people
[1:57:32] you know
[1:57:35] you know he just wants to be a normal
[1:57:37] dad and this guy starts carrying on
[1:57:40] starts mocking job and everything
[1:57:42] birdman says i just couldn't take it no
[1:57:44] more
[1:57:46] amen wait a minute friend that was a
[1:57:49] special prepared fish
[1:57:52] wouldn't you like to sat there and got
[1:57:53] that sermon that that guy got
[1:57:58] i'm waiting for the rest of the story
[1:58:02] that's right i like to think that guy
[1:58:05] come to christ somewhere down the lower
[1:58:07] road i like that guy at the train
[1:58:12] station
[1:58:14] that little girl comes back home from
[1:58:16] college
[1:58:18] she's sitting on that train
[1:58:21] and she's with her snickerty friends and
[1:58:23] everything and they're laughing and they
[1:58:25] finally get to her stop
[1:58:27] and one of the girls that was one of her
[1:58:30] best friends sitting there says who's
[1:58:31] that
[1:58:32] ugly hag over there all crippled over
[1:58:35] and bent up and
[1:58:36] skinned ooh isn't she hideous
[1:58:42] is that girl's mother
[1:58:46] so she got off the train and wanted to
[1:58:49] pretend like she didn't know her until
[1:58:51] maybe her friends took off
[1:58:53] that old boy i always i'm just telling
[1:58:57] you how i think
[1:58:58] i always felt that conductor was that
[1:59:00] boy that got healed in memphis
[1:59:04] remember that guy because remember
[1:59:07] brother brown said that he found him at
[1:59:09] a train station someplace and said
[1:59:11] brother ben is not
[1:59:14] saved you know i always felt it was him
[1:59:19] someone that had an experience with god
[1:59:22] somebody was into and all of a sudden he
[1:59:25] got up
[1:59:26] in front of everybody and looked at her
[1:59:28] and said sister you ought to be ashamed
[1:59:30] of yourself
[1:59:33] she says let me tell you something your
[1:59:35] mother was beautiful
[1:59:37] there was nobody that could hold a
[1:59:40] candle
[1:59:41] to her beauty
[1:59:45] he said but one day the house caught on
[1:59:47] fire
[1:59:48] and you were in it and she went
[1:59:52] and became ugly and burned out
[1:59:55] so you could be beautiful
[1:59:59] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[2:00:02] christ didn't go to calvary
[2:00:06] so we could be a bunch of weak
[2:00:10] intellectual feeling bound
[2:00:13] people he went to calvary
[2:00:16] so the chip off of him would
[2:00:20] manifest and possess the gifts
[2:00:23] by attribute where he wouldn't have to
[2:00:27] keep giving it to us and giving it to us
[2:00:29] finally one day we would accept
[2:00:32] the fact that all that he was
[2:00:35] he poured into me and i have christ
[2:00:39] i have healing i have deliverance
[2:00:42] i am a possessor
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:46] of the gifts by attribute
[2:00:50] by gene by inheritance
[2:00:53] they're mine
[2:00:58] but all satan has to do is point to your
[2:01:01] little body
[2:01:02] and you fall to pieces did you hear
[2:01:04] brother branham said that god is not
[2:01:06] going to judge you by your body
[2:01:11] in other words he's not going to judge
[2:01:13] you by the sins that have gone on
[2:01:16] in your flesh he's going to judge you by
[2:01:19] your
[2:01:19] inner spirit man he's going to
[2:01:22] look to see if that seed
[2:01:25] long
[2:01:29] to be what it was created to be
[2:01:33] and all satan has to detour you
[2:01:37] is to offer you his kingdom
[2:01:42] you know you don't need to manifest that
[2:01:44] gift
[2:01:46] you know you really don't have to have
[2:01:47] that gift there or have that attribute
[2:01:50] of healing
[2:01:51] because believe it or not i got doctors
[2:01:55] nothing against doctors we had one here
[2:01:57] this morning
[2:01:59] but i've got i've got i've got
[2:02:01] substitutes for that
[2:02:06] and god says okay
[2:02:10] i i i gave them the knowledge of
[2:02:13] medicine i use doctors
[2:02:16] but when they run out you don't run out
[2:02:22] you don't believe god does miracles
[2:02:26] natalie was this big did you know you
[2:02:29] were that big natalie you were a
[2:02:31] kleenex box
[2:02:35] when i went soar in the hospital i
[2:02:36] thought my
[2:02:38] i didn't know they came that little
[2:02:42] but what do we got today a miracle
[2:02:49] nobody sent in a gift that was a mama
[2:02:53] that had healing
[2:02:55] a daddy that possessed it and they
[2:02:58] reached into what they were
[2:03:00] and claimed the promise that they are
[2:03:05] do you understand what god's trying to
[2:03:07] achieve
[2:03:08] in this mess we're in
[2:03:13] sometimes it takes the situation
[2:03:18] eve had to go before adam knew he
[2:03:20] possessed those attributes
[2:03:28] i believe adam walked out of that garden
[2:03:29] knowing he's coming back
[2:03:33] because god gave it to him
[2:03:38] and he didn't want to return there so
[2:03:41] when the second atom came
[2:03:44] he was going to quicken the seed
[2:03:49] or the gene or the attribute
[2:03:52] so that person would become an attribute
[2:03:55] and be
[2:03:56] able to walk up to his side as a queen
[2:03:59] and fellowship both of them being from
[2:04:02] the
[2:04:02] creator because it wasn't a new creation
[2:04:07] it was the same creation adam and eve
[2:04:12] both possessing the original attributes
[2:04:15] both possessing the original works both
[2:04:18] possessing the same being the same gene
[2:04:21] and the characteristics you are beyond
[2:04:25] sinners saved by grace you
[2:04:28] are the redeemed thoughts of god
[2:04:31] restored again you are a different
[2:04:35] class of people a different category
[2:04:38] you're gonna live in a different city in
[2:04:41] a different place
[2:04:43] in a different kingdom there'll be those
[2:04:45] that love you
[2:04:47] and that you love that'll be there
[2:04:49] they'll live on the side of that
[2:04:51] mountain and they'll come up and take
[2:04:53] from the tree of life
[2:04:54] a leaf that allows them
[2:04:58] under the attributes that you have to
[2:05:00] come into that
[2:05:01] city and to come in and out and have
[2:05:04] life but you
[2:05:08] are the word
[2:05:11] that was in the beginning returned home
[2:05:15] let's look for the revelation
[2:05:21] that will manifest the things
[2:05:24] that god has promised
[2:05:30] you hear what i say for the things
[2:05:34] we haven't seen yet
[2:05:38] but the hour has come the time is here
[2:05:41] that we better find our weapons because
[2:05:44] satan
[2:05:45] is out and this is the greatest battle
[2:05:50] that's ever been fought and he brings
[2:05:53] sickness
[2:05:54] fear death but god's given us the
[2:05:57] greatest
[2:05:58] weapon that he could give us not an
[2:06:01] intellectual
[2:06:02] word but a gene
[2:06:05] life amen that was there from the
[2:06:09] beginning
[2:06:10] do you love them tonight oh church we
[2:06:13] are moving into glorious things
[2:06:16] are we moving into hard times yes
[2:06:19] are we moving into testing times yes
[2:06:23] but we're more in conquerors in christ
[2:06:25] jesus
[2:06:26] the trying of our faith is more precious
[2:06:29] than gold
[2:06:30] but let faith have its perfect work
[2:06:35] because all that he's sanctified
[2:06:36] justified he's sanctified
[2:06:38] and all that he sanctified he glorified
[2:06:42] and this bride is going to come into her
[2:06:44] glory
[2:06:45] the glory of the resurrection the glory
[2:06:49] of the nature of christ
[2:06:50] the glory of the attributes and genes
[2:06:53] that they are manifested god bless you
[2:06:56] let stan billy if you'd come and help me
[2:07:04] can you believe that for yourself this
[2:07:06] evening
[2:07:08] brother branham said in pervy faith
[2:07:10] jesus had faith
[2:07:12] in what the scripture said he was
[2:07:15] can't we have faith in what the word
[2:07:19] says we are
[2:07:22] oh lord let's pray
[2:07:27] if you look across your life and
[2:07:30] you look across your mind
[2:07:34] and you know that that little spirit of
[2:07:36] doubt
[2:07:39] works if when our brother gave our
[2:07:43] testimony if you said oh he
[2:07:45] he was at this place and he shouldn't
[2:07:47] have been and oh he's a spreader
[2:07:50] and and oh my
[2:07:54] if all those other elements weren't
[2:07:56] there
[2:07:57] it wouldn't be the testimony that it was
[2:08:08] if jesus didn't go past everybody at the
[2:08:12] pool of bethesda
[2:08:14] and all those things were there
[2:08:17] [Music]
[2:08:18] the scripture said that jesus perceived
[2:08:21] that the man had
[2:08:22] faith that the lord gave him a call and
[2:08:24] vision so he went there and he asked the
[2:08:26] man sir would you be healed
[2:08:29] the man believed in healing he said sir
[2:08:34] i wait and every time the angel comes
[2:08:37] before i can get to the pool
[2:08:39] someone steps in before me
[2:08:45] he looks over look at me
[2:08:50] no doubt he began to talk to him until
[2:08:54] he contacted his spirit
[2:08:57] maybe he told him how he got sick and
[2:09:01] why what put him on that thing who
[2:09:04] brought him there
[2:09:07] and then he said arise or walk take up
[2:09:10] your palate
[2:09:13] the man left that place
[2:09:17] sometimes in order for it to be the
[2:09:20] miracle that it is
[2:09:23] the circumstances have to be present
[2:09:27] to make it a miracle
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:31] science in education and civilization
[2:09:35] wants to do away with the circumstances
[2:09:40] of miracle
[2:09:45] but our prophet said all things in the
[2:09:47] scripture says all things work together
[2:09:50] for our good even prison death sickness
[2:09:55] for them that love them lord let us not
[2:10:00] try to get rid of the circumstance
[2:10:03] let us find the victorious attribute
[2:10:07] that lies within us
[2:10:10] lord that we might be more like you
[2:10:15] if that's your desire tonight maybe the
[2:10:18] lord spoke to your heart
[2:10:20] then you would like to say lord i want
[2:10:22] to be a possessor
[2:10:25] i want to be the gifts not just
[2:10:29] receive them i want to be
[2:10:32] what they are
[2:10:37] the attributes of what you are lord
[2:10:39] that's what i want to be
[2:10:41] i want to i am the gene of god
[2:10:44] i want to start being what you created
[2:10:47] me to be
[2:10:48] a masterpiece a bride
[2:10:53] a possessor of everything that came off
[2:10:56] the original piece
[2:10:58] not a new creation but the same creation
[2:11:02] [Music]
[2:11:04] father if it takes a plague to bring me
[2:11:06] there thank god
[2:11:08] for the plague if it takes the police
[2:11:11] trying to close down our door thank god
[2:11:15] because he who is in us is
[2:11:18] greater than he was in the world
[2:11:22] god bless you tonight
